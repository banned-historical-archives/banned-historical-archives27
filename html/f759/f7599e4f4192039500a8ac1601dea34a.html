 China's Search for an
 Economic Reform Strategy:
 above objective economic criteria in decisionmaking.
 When Mao died in 1976, China's economy was riddled with waste and low
 labor productivity. Inefficiencies caused by rigid economic planning had
 been exacerbated by Maoist policies that used political campaigns in futile
 efforts to achieve economic goals and that elevated ideological orthodoxy
 Two years later, China's new leaders convened the Third Plenum of the
 1 1 th Party Congress, which made economic modernization China's top
 priority. All believed economic reform was necessary to prevent China
 from falling further behind the industrialized nations, and all were united
 in viewing reform as a limited process involving decentralization of some
 decisionmaking authority and greater involvement of scientists and engi-
 neers in the operations of state enterprises. No one advocated allowing
 market forces to play a major role in China's economic development.~~  25X1
 believed that reforms should remain narrowly focused.
 Initial incentive-based agricultural reforms proved more successful than
 anyone imagined, however, and Deng Xiaoping, Zhao Ziyang, and other
 leaders began pressing for much wider use of market mechanisms in
 China's economy. As the scope of reform broadened, the consensus about
 economic policy quickly dissolved. A split emerged between those who
 supported comprehensive reforms and more "conservative" leaders who
 These two loose groups differ in how they view three core issues:
 ? The Locus oJ'Economic Decision Making. Reformers see devolution of
 authority to factory managers and increased use of market mechanisms
 as the key to boosting efficiency and growth. Conservatives are more
 concerned about the wider fluctuations in prices and in growth rates this
 introduces, and believe that stable economic development can be
 achieved only by continuing to rely primarily on central planning.
 ? The Social Costs o./'Development. All leaders recognize the potentially
 destabilizing aspects of reform, but reformers are more willing to tolerate
 the greater income disparities and social tensions they see as the price of
 progress. As with economic performance, conservatives place a premium
 on stability.

 ? The Primacy of the Party. All agree that the party must loosen its control
 over day-to-day economic decisions, but conservatives worry that, if this
 goes too far, party control over other areas will erode and give rise to de-
 mands for political liberalization.
 [n high-level debates the reform view has generally prevailed, and, since
 the early 1980s, reformers have implemented elements of their program-
 including abolishing mandatory procurement quotas for grain; relaxing
 state price controls over vegetables, meat, and major consumer durables;
 and reducing the number of goods that are produced under the central plan
 to fewer than 60. For the future, they want to extend price reforms, allow
 state enterprises to experiment with issuing stocks and bonds, and establish
 labor, capital, and raw materials markets that will allocate a significant
 share of resources:
 ? In putting together a development strategy, reform leaders have relied on
 Chinese economists who increasingly have accepted Western economic
 theory as a guide.                         Chinese econo-
 mists-particularly young scholars at Chinese universities and govern-
 ment think tanks-demonstrate increased understanding of market tools,
 frequently use concepts from Western economic theory to illustrate
 shortcomings in their planning system, and express a willingness to
 broaden market forces in China.
 ? Chinese reformers apparently have been influenced, in part, by their
 exposure to the ideas of US officials and educators. US economic
 textbooks reportedly are popular in China, the official press often reports
 the views of US professors, and Beijing openly solicits advice from US
 Conservatives, on the other hand, seem more sure of what they do not want
 than how they would spur growth while maintaining economic and social
 control. Generally, they believe that reform has gone far enough, and what
 is needed is greater attention to the problems that it has created, such as
 inflation, runaway outside-of-plan investment, and a big jump in China's
 foreign debt. Conservative solutions to these problems include tighter

 controls on how enterprises can spend their retained earnings and sharp
 limits on the ability of local authorities to import or borrow foreign funds
 independently of the central plan.
 The debate over reform strategy may be approaching a critical juncture. In
 a speech in March 1987, Zhao Ziyang revealed that a major review of
 China's eight-year-old experiment with economic reform currently is under
 way. According to US Embassy sources, the purpose of the study is to
 develop a comprehensive, coordinated blueprint for further reforms that
 will be submitted to the 13th Party Congress in October. Reformers
 probably hope to use the study to reassure conservatives that new policies
 will be implemented prudently, while building a consensus over which steps
 to take next. Zhao's vigorous defense of price reform in recent speeches and
 advocating further experiments with ownership
 reforms in state enterprises indicate that reformers expect difficulty
 resolving these sensitive policies.
 Given what is at stake and the sharp differences in how Chinese leaders
 view the risks of further reforms, we believe that a consensus will remain
 elusive. Moreover, China remains a political system dominated by a
 paramount leader who sets the tone and resolves differences, and the views
 of that individual-whether Deng or a successor-will have much to say
 about reform strategy. In a period of leadership transition that will see
 significant turnover at the top of an aged leadership, we believe battles over
 economic reform strategy are likely to be lengthy and intense.
 Beijing's choice of a development strategy will have significant implica-
 tions for US-Chinese economic relations. A reformist strategy involving
 price reform and less government control over access to foreign exchange
 would improve the investment climate for foreign firms. Moreover, the
 reformist program-including decentralizing trade authority-probably
 would spark faster growth in bilateral trade, with Chinese imports of US
 machinery, computers, consumer goods, and scientific equipment growing
 rapidly. Because of China's strong demand for these and other products,
 China probably would register balance of trade deficits-forcing Beijing to
 step up borrowing from US banks. Diminished central control over CI}inese
 enterprises and greater incentives to sell abroad would sharply increase
 Chinese exports-particularly textiles, electronic components, and other
 light manufactures-and might disrupt US markets and cause increased
 trade frictions.

 A conservative development strategy, on the other hand, probably would
 mean slower growth in bilateral trade and less willingness on Beijing's part
 to borrow money from US banks or allow US firms to set up operations in
 China. Tightened central restrictions over trade, however, would give
 Beijing greater control over the volume and mix of Chinese exports
 thereby decreasing the probability that its exports would disrupt US
 markets.

 China's Search for an
 Economic Reform Strategy:
 Schools of Thought
 From Unity to Fragmentation
 When the Third Plenum of the 1 lth Party Congress,
 meeting in December 1978, made the landmark deci-
 sion to reject Maoist notions of class struggle and
 devote full attention to economic development, Chi-
 nese leaders, as indicated by their public statements,
 viewed reform as a way to patch up the planned
 economy and reassert the role of rationality and
 expertise in economic decision making. Although
 senior officials were unclear over how extensive the
 reforms should be, ~~o one advocated giving much
 scope to market forces.
 We believe the success of initial economic reforms,
 however, convinced Deng Xiaoping and other senior
 leaders to implement a much more far-reaching re-
 form program. In particular, raising state procure-
 ment prices and allowing rural households increased
 autonomy over production decisions proved more suc-
 cessful than Beijing had anticipated-from 1981 to
 1984 grain production shot up at an average annual
 rate of almost 8percent-apparently convincing some
 leaders that wider use of market mechanisms would
 stimulate rapid growth in other sectors. We believe
 that these leaders-at the same time-viewed diffi-
 culties with initial efforts to loosen state controls over
 enterprises as evidence that industrial efficiency could
 not be raised unless the whole urban economy was
 transformed through price, wage, financial, planning,
 and management reforms.
 On the basis of public statements by Chinese leaders,
 we believe that, as the scope of economic reforms
 expanded, the consensus about economic policy
 quickly eroded among senior officials who previously
 had been united by their opposition to Maoist prac-
 tices. Asplit emerged between those who supported
 comprehensive reform policies and party "conserva-
 tives" who believed reforms should be much narrower.
 Who Are the Players?
 Chinese leaders have denied the existence of "reform-
 ist" and "conservative" factions within the top ranks
 of the Chinese Communist Party. Although we agree
 that neither grouping constitutes a unified faction-
 members have their own interests and agendas and
 often line up differently on particular political
 issues-a large body of press            report-
 ing points to sharp disagreement between the two
 groups over the extent to which market forces should
 govern economic activity in China. Deng Xiaoping
 and other reform proponents-including Premier and
 Acting General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, Vice Pre-
 miers Wan Li and Tian Jiyun, Politburo member Hu
 Qili, and former General Secretary Hu Yaobang-
 support broadening the use of market mechanisms in
 China. Conservatives include diehard central planners
 and party ideologues-such as President Li Xiannian,
 Politburo Standing Committee member Chen Yun,
 National People's Congress Chairman Peng Zhen,
 Vice Premiers Yao Yilin and Li Peng, Politburo
 member Hu Qiaomu, and former Propaganda Depart-
 ment chief Deng Liqun-who believe that ideological
 orthodoxy and strong central controls over agricul-
 ture, industry, and foreign trade are necessary to
 maintain stability and party control.
 At Stake: Privilege, Stability, and Control
 Chinese leaders realize that individual power and
 perks, the role of the Communist Party, and even
 China's security are at stake in the reform process. At
 a party conference in January 1986, Tian Jiyun
 admitted that economic reform involves a "readjust-
 ment of power and interest" in China. Throughout the
 economy, from the head of a ministry asked to
 relinquish control of its factories, to a party secretary
 in a small state enterprise asked to cede authority over
 personnel decisions to the factory manager, reforms
 are causing a fundamental shift in the locus of

 cials realize that problems may emerge from reforms,
 but conservatives assess the risks of economic, social,
 and political instability arising from too great a
 reliance on market-oriented policies as being unac-
 ceptably high.
 Economic Control. When reforms were launched,
 conservatives warned that Beijing could lose control of
 the economy if the central planning mechanism were
 weakened, and they argued that strict limits should
 therefore be placed on decentralization. Nonetheless,
 reformers were able to sharply curtail the scope of
 mandatory planning during the past eight years, in
 part by arguing that indirect economic levers  such
 as taxes and interest rates-could be used to regulate
 economic activity outside the plan. Conservatives felt
 vindicated when, in 1985, investment spending sky-
 rocketed, inflation tripled, imports surged, and foreign
 exchange reserves fell precipitantly-and they strong-
 ly criticized reformers for excessively decentralizing
 economic decision making. In a sharply worded
 speech to the National Party Delegates Conference in
 September 1985, Chen Yun, the senior conservative
 spokesman on economic policy, warned that central
 planning was still the "essence of macroeconomic
 control."'
 Social Stability. Hong Kong press reports and public
 comments by orthodox officials indicate that conserv-
 atives believe spillovers from economic reforms-such
 as growing income disparities, inflation, and corrup-
 tion-will damage the party's image and, in a worst
 case, lead to widespread social unrest including mas-
 sive demonstrations in Chinese cities. No senior offi-
 cials support a return to strict Maoist egalitarianism,
 but conservatives believe that, by encouraging some
 people to "get rich before others," by publicizing the
 achievements of successful peasants and urban entre-
 preneurs, and by sanctioning purchases of consumer
 durables and fashionable clothing, market-oriented
 policies will create social polarization. Although re-
 form-minded journalists have identified envy as
 China's top social problem, Deng Xiaoping and his

 On the basis of public statements by Chinese officials,
 we believe that there is broad agreement within the
 leadership over some aspects of China's development
 strategy. Most significant, all leaders view economic
 reform as necessary to make China a prosperous and
 powerful nation with worldwide influence. Reformers
 and conservatives also agree on broad guidelines for
 reforms of the planning system and on investment
 priorities:
 ? The planning apparatus must be overhauled. The
 old ,system is too extensive and rigid, and some
 degree of decentralization is necessary.
 ? Output targets in the plan should be set low, and
 greater emphasis should be placed on meeting
 qualitative goals, such as improving product quali-
 ty and boosting industrial efficiency. Economic
 decisions should be based on objective criteria,
 including cost-benefit analysis. Even mandatory
 planning must take supply and demand into
 consideration.
 ? Bureaucratic interference in economic activities
 should be reduced, and responsibility systems-
 such as granting factory managers increased deci-
 sionmaking authority but holding them account-
 ablefor profitability-should be set up in industry
 and agriculture.
 supporters believe that reforms will cause general
 living standards to rise fast enough to keep social
 tensions from boiling over. Conservatives also worry
 that loosened central controls and the emphasis on
 making money have opened the floodgates of fraud,
 bribery, smuggling, black-market trading of foreign
 currencies, and graft by local officials
 Party Primacy. Conservatives fear that decentraliza-
 tion of economic decision making and increased expo-
 sure to Western ideas will give rise to demands for
 political liberalization that Beijing will have difficulty
 ? Productive capacity should be increased through
 technological transformation of existing factories,
 rather than building new factories or importing
 whole plants.
 ? Development of heavy industry, light industry, and
 agriculture should be balanced.
 ? Priority in investment spending must be given to
 developing energy, transportation, and communica-
 tions facilities.
 ? Technical expertise must be respected and reward-
 ed. Scientists and engineers should play a larger
 role in factory decision making, and the skills of

 Secret
 Last summer a US Embassy contact placed Chen
 Yun at the head of those in China who believe in the
 importance of improved state planning. In our view,
 the fact that in the late 1970s Chen was considered
 the leading proponent of an expanded role for the
 market indicntes how sharply the development
 .etrnteer debate has swung toward acceptance of
 market mechanisms
 Although Chen is considered a leading conservative,
 all Chinese leaders frequentlti~ quote his remarks to
 support their own policies  indicating that,
 he still has enormous personal
 longevity in the party  he has been a member of the
 Party Central Committee since 1931, longer than
 anyone else-and his role as China's chief economic
 troubleshooter over the past 40 years. When the
 Communists came to power in 1949, Chen ended the
 hyperirtflation then plaguing China, restored produc-
 tion, and guided the transformation of the economy
 from private to public ownership. !n 1958 Chen was
 one of the few leaders to oppose Mao's ill-conceived
 Great Leap Forward, and in 1961-62 he helped bring
 the economy back from the disaster it caused. After
 Mao died, he played a key role in reducing the
 irtffation and large budget deficits caused by Hua
 Guofeng's overly ambitious development plans. ~
 At the Eighth Party Congress in September 1956,
 Chen proposed that the market could be an important
 supplement to central planning. Over 20 years later
 he described his views on the relationship between the
 market and the plan as being like that of a bird and a
 cage: if the cage is too restrictive, the bird will
 suffocate, but the cage is too loose, the bird willhy
 away. In our view, the fact that his views are widely
 accepted by conservative leaders provides a degree of
 protection to Chinese economic theorists who-
 according to the metaphor  can argue over the size
 of the cage, and not whether the bird has a right to

 prestige. Respect for Chen probably stems from his
 maintaining one-party Communist rule, but reformers
 are more confident of their abilities to moderate
 demands for political reform, and therefore more
 willing to risk "ideological contamination" from con-
 tacts with the West.
 The "Mainstream" Reform Strategy
 Since the early 1980x, reformers have implemented an
 increasing amount of their program  and the "main-
 stream" position in the debate over reform strategy
 consequently has shifted in an increasingly market-
 oriented direction. In our view, reformers have had
 live
 success implementing their policies because of politi-
 cal victories' and rapid gains in production. Beijing's
 most notable success was increasing grain produc-
 tion  which made China a net grain exporter in 1985
 for the first time in 25 years. Moreover, gross national
 product grew at an average annual rate of about 9
 percent in real terms between 1978 and 1986, accord-
 ing to official statistics.' Although reforms have also

 instance, production of rolled steel and coal grew at average annual
 rates of 9 and 7 percent, respectively, between 19ri1 and 19t{6.~

 Beijing's Nightmare of Solidarity-Style
 Labor Unrest
 Beijing had just launched its reform program when
 the Polish Solidarity trade union movement arose in
 .full force. A variety of information, including that
 .from Hong Kong journals and speeches by Chinese
 intellectuals, indicated Beijing was deeply troubled
 ~~? the specter of widespread labor unrest being
 sparked by attempts at reform in a socialist state.
 At the time, many leaders viewed Solidarity as an
 example of what can happen the party loses touch
 with the people and fails to satisfy their desire for
 progress. The episode apparently also reirtforced the
 tears of some conservatives who believed that
 ex7reme caution should be exercised in implementing
 economic reforms.
 Although overt signs of worker unrest have been
 relatively rare in China since Beijing began imple-
 menting reforms, there have been a few notable
 exceptions. Most recently, a Hong Kong newspaper
 reported that 20,000 workers at a tractor factory in
 Henan Province went on strike for two days last
 December, protesting lew wages.
 Despite the relatively small number of incidents that
 have been reported, we believe Chinese leaders fear
 widespread labor unrest and the cycle of declining
 labor productivity and falling standards of living that
 would accompany it. For example, a Hong Kong
 journal reported that Deng Xiaoping reacted harshly
 to protests by university students in December
 because he was extremely worried that workers
 would join the students.
 sparked inflation and budget and trade deficits, Deng
 and his supporters continue to view these problems as
 secondary when compared with the overall increase in
 China's standard of living.
 On the basis of important speeches by reform lead-
 ers-particularly Zhao Ziyang's annual reports to the
 National People's Congress and his speech to a party
 conference in September 1985  we believe that main-
 stream reformers want to establish an economy in
 which the market plays a large, but not dominant,
 role. In the countryside, peasants would have wide
 latitude to plant crops or start local industries-but
 important inputs, such as fertilizer and diesel fuel,
 would continue to be distributed through state supply
 channels. The production and distribution of key
 industrial products would be controlled by the state,
 but managers of state enterprises would make all
 operational decisions, including appointing subordi-
 nates and hiring and firing workers, purchasing raw
 materials, and directly marketing a significant share
 of output. Some firms producing exports would be
 allowed to contact foreign purchasers directly.
 Unprofitable enterprises would be shut down, and
 laid-off workers could seek employment with other
 enterprises or join the service sector-and would be
 protected by unemployment insurance until they
 found a new job. Overall market activity would be
 controlled by China's central bank through adjust-
 ments in credit availability, and by changes in taxes.
 The Influence of Western Economic Thought
 We believe that a driving force in the reform program
 has been the significant inroads that Western
 economic thought has made over Marxist theory in
 the minds of China's economists, as has been evident
 in their conversations with US officials and in Chinese
 press reports. For instance, the director of the Com-
 prehensive Planning Department of China's central
 bank told US officials that policymakers in the bank
 hope eventually to control China's money supply using
 the same tools-open market operations, discount rate
 adjustments, and changes in reserve requirements-
 that the US Federal Reserve Board uses. And the
 director of the Institute for Planned Economy in
 China's conservative State Planning Commission
 reported that he favors gradually eliminating price
 controls over key products such as coal.
 On the basis of conversations between US and Chi-
 nese officials, we believe that increased familiarity
 with Western economic concepts is not limited to one
 group of scholars or bureaucrats. Growing economic
 sophistication is evident from conversations with econ-
 omists in China's central ministries and organizations,

 particularly the State Commission to Restructure the
 Economic System-a State Council think tank for
 reform policies-and the Economics Institute of the
 Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.~~
 the evolution in
 economic thought in China has been caused, in part,
 by exposure to the views of US officials and educa-
 tors. According to a knowledgeable Chinese econo-
 mist, an introductory economics textbook by a well-
 known US professor is more popular in China than
 Marxist writings.` The Chinese press reports the views
 of US professors on China's reform program, and
 Beijing openly solicits advice from US experts.
 China's central bank, for instance, invited a delega-
 tion of US financial experts-including the chairman
 of the New York Stock Exchange-to Beijing last fall
 to discuss how to run securities markets. At annual
 meetings of the US-China Joint Economic Committee
 and the Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade,
 US economists of ethnic Chinese origin have strongly
 influenced the thinking of Chinese leaders-and the
 Chinese press has reported meetings between those
 economists and China's top reform leaders.
 The Influence of the "Radical" Reformers
 A few Chinese economists have argued that Beijing
 should renounce central planning and adopt a market
 economy:
 ? Li Yining, an economics professor at Beijing
 University, told a US Embassy officer that the best
 way to improve China's industrial efficiency would
 be for the government to cede ownership of state
 enterprises to workers and managers. Li believes
 that over the next 15 years Beijing should transform
 China's state-owned enterprises into firms run by
 boards of directors whose composition would be
 determined by stock ownership. Shares in what are
 now state enterprises would be sold to workers and

 ling-though not necessarily amajority-interest.

 would be dismantled, and enterprises would com-
 pete in a market environment.
 ? Wang Jue, a senior economist at the Chinese Com-
 munist Party's Central Party School, told a US
 Embassy officer that he teaches market concepts to
 high-level party officials attending the school.
 Among other things, Wang apparently presents the
 idea that the central plan should be sharply cur-
 tailed and that prices, wages, and rents should be

 and communications.
 Even these progressive economists, however, believe
 that some type of government planning is necessary-
 for instance, to determine which industries to encour-
 age-and believe that the state should directly run
 important sectors, such as banking, transportation,
 According to the US Embassy in Beijing, these
 progressive ideas have received a hearing from reform
 leaders. Li Yining, for instance, told a US Embassy
 officer that he has briefed Zhao Ziyang on his reform
 proposals. Limited evidence suggests that Zhao may
 have been influenced by the ideas of China's most
 progressive economists. A contact of the US Embassy,
 for example, reported that Zhao is the chief sponsor of
 experiments with multiple ownership forms in state
 enterprises. Nevertheless, in conversations with US
 officials, including Secretary of State Shultz in
 March 1987, Zhao has maintained that the economy
 will remain predominantly publicly owned and that
 China will not adopt the US free market model.
 The fact that radical proposals by some economists
 received an open airing in the Chinese media last year
 indicates that reform leaders-if not necessarily
 accepting these ideas-believe that China's most mar-
 ket-oriented economists have an important role in the

 "Chao Ziyang: Innovator and Patron oJChina's

 since 1980, has been the leader most directly respon-

 In our view, Zhao is one of the strongest supporters
 within the Chinese leadership of the use of'economic
 incentives. As party secretary in Sichuan Province in
 the late 1970x, he was one of the first leaders to
 promote rural reforms linking peasant income with
 individual production. And, as Premier, he has con-

 Zhao has also been one of the chief advocates of
 practical and theoretical exploration of new reforms.
 In his speech to the National People's Congress in
 March 1986, he complained that economic theory in
 China lagged reforms, and encouraged economists to
 "boldly explore" new ideas. This exhortation sig-
 naled the start of an increasingly open debate in 1986
 in the Chinese press over the relevance of Western
 economic thought in China's reform process. Accord-
 ing to iIS Embassy contacts, Zhao listens to the
 views of China's most progressive economists and has
 protected them./rom party ideologues who in the past
 have tried to prevent them from conducting research
 on non-Marxist theories.
 We believe that Zhao has gone further than any other
 senior leader in advocating the use of market forces
 to drive China's development program. According to
 the Chinese press, when Zhao-on a visit to Romania
 last summer-was reminded of Chen Yun's birdcage
 metaphor, he replied that "a really good bird keeper
 can let a bird out and summon it back as .soon as he
 calls ... we are trying to learn just that trick. "In our
 view, Zhao's remark was a clear, and calculated,

 Herald --that published bold commentaries last year

 tailored to meet the needs of a market economy.
 planned economy.
 Reform Policies and the Conservative Agenda
 In our view, conservatives have a much clearer idea of
 what they do not like than of what they would do if
 they had the chance to implement their own program.
 Nevertheless, statements by conservative leaders indi-
 cate how their development strategy differs from
 recently implemented reforms (which are enumerated

 Secret
 The Scope of Market Forces. Because of regulations
 pro~ntdgated in 1984 that allow enterprises to sell
 over quota production at market prices, about 50
 percent of steel, 60 percent of coal, and 84 percent of
 cement are distributed outside the central plan.
 Moreover, production of fewer than 60 goods is now
 controlled through the plan. Last year, reformers
 called for the establishment of labor, capital, and raw
 materials markets, and Beijing set up experimental
 interbank loan markets, steel markets, and rudimen-
 tarr bond markets in several Chinese cities.0
 Party conservatives believe that the market has a
 small, but important, role in the economy. This view
 was reiterated in March, when Li Xiannian told
 Secretary Shultz that "the private economy can exist,
 but only as an auxiliary." In practice, conservatives
 believe that market forces should govern production
 of subsidiary agricultural products, handicrafts, out-
 put of small workshops, and minor consumer items. In
 past speeches, Chen Yun argued that about one-
 fourth of all retail sales should be permitted to occur
 completely outside government channels.
 According to conservatives, mandatory state plans
 should govern the production of important agricultur-
 al, industrial, and consumer goods  such as grain,
 steel, and cloth. They believe, however, that a large
 number of other goods can be produced under "guid-
 ance" plans set by the state but flexible enough to
 enable enterprises to adjust to changing market condi-
 tions. For instance, many enterprises in light industry
 could purchase raw materials and market some of
 their output themselves-and Beijing would use a
 combination of administrative restrictions and
 changes in tax and credit policies to regulate their
 activity. ~~
 Rural Reforms. In 1985, Beijing eliminated grain
 procurement quotas. Peasants now sign grain con-
 tracts with state supply units and have autonomy to
 sell the remaining output on the free market. Thev
 have increased flexibility to raise cash crops and
 livestock or to leave farming for rural industries. In a
 .speech to China's Rural Work Conference in Novem-
 ber 1986, Tian Jirun called for broadening market
 forces in the countr}side to commercialize Chinese
 agriculture.  ~~
 Conservatives support rural reforms that have given
 peasants increased autonomy over production deci-
 sions, but believe that administrative measures--such
 as restrictions on how much farmland can be trans-
 ferred to other uses  should be employed to ensure
 production of an adequate grain supply. In a speech at
 the party plenum in October 1984, Chen Yun touted
 policies allowing peasants who have fulfilled their
 delivery obligations to the state to sell excess grain on
 rural free markets. And at a party conference in
 September 1985, Chen praised the "household
 responsibility system" for increasing agricultural pro-
 duction and raising rural standards of living.b
 Conservatives, however, oppose policies that in the
 past two years have encouraged peasants to leave their
 land and start rural businesses and that have in-
 creased incentives for raising cash crops and live-
 stock.' In his 1985 speech, Chen complained that
 peasants are no longer interested in growing grain
 because they can earn more in rural industry, and he
 warned that a drop in grain production would lead to
 social disorder. Since then, conservatives have repeat-
 edly urged peasants not to neglect grain production.
 Open criticism of reformers' agricultural policies by
 delegates to this year's session of China's National
 People's Congress indicates that there is still a sharp
 dispute within the leadership over how much autono-
 my peasants should be given in determining the mix of
 rural production.
 Industrial Reforms. To enhance the prerogatives of
 factory managers, and the penalties for poor deci-
 sions, Beijing issued regulations last fall that allow
 state enterprises to hire new employees under renew-
 able contracts-rather than for life, as was the policy

 in the past-and approved an experimental bankrupt-
 c,y law that provides guidelines for shutting down
 inefficient state enterprises. Beijing also experiment-
 e d with new ownership forms in industry by leasing
 .cnrall state factories to individuals and allowing
 other enterprises to issue shares to their workers.
 According to conservatives, training factory directors
 in modern management techniques and promoting
 younger, better educated technocrats-not imple-
 menting sweeping industrial reforms-are the keys to
 boosting efficiency in state enterprises. They agree,
 however, that enterprises and local governments
 should be given increased decisionmaking authority.
 Enterprises producing under the state plan, for exam-
 ple, should be granted the right to make day-to-day
 production decisions, but with factory managers and
 party committees working closely to arrive at these
 decisions. They support factory discretion on spending
 retained earnings, but with strict guidelines to prevent
 outside-of-plan spending from disrupting the state's
 priority construction projects.R They do not object to
 new ownership forms in small state enterprises, but
 they believe that all medium and large enterprises
 should be state owned, and they object to sales of
 stock by these enterprises.
 Wage Policy. /n 1986, Beijing continued to urge
 factory managers to set wages and bonuses according
 to productivity, and allowed some enterprises to base
 their total wage bill on factory profitability.~~
 Orthodox officials acknowledge that material incen-
 tives can play a role in China's economic develop-
 ment. In his October 1984 speech, Chen Yun blasted
 "big pot" egalitarianism under which workers' wages
 are unrelated to individual productivity. And, in the
 past, Chen has supported the use of piece rate wages
 for coal miners. But conservatives are concerned that
 material rewards could create excessively wide in-
 come disparities and they believe that equal weight
 should be placed on altruistic incentives. In March,
 ' Outside-uf-plan investment by state enterprises made up almost 20
 pcreent of the total investment spending by state enterprises in
 1986. nccurding to the Chinese press, this outside-of-plan invest-
 ment often pulled resources away from key projects.~~
 while defending the use of wage differentials, Li Peng
 argued that workers must be motivated by "socialist
 ethics"-their love for China and respect for party
 ideals.
 Price Reforms. Beijing eased controls on the prices of
 vegetables and meat in 1985, and freed prices of
 major consumer goods-such as bicycles and refrig-
 erators-last fall. The mayor of Guangzhou told the
 US Consul General in January that Beijing had
 planned to allow the prices of key raw materials-
 such as coal, oil, and steel-to float within a broad
 range this year, but has temporarily shelved those
 plans because of concerns about the potential infla-
 tionary impact.
 Conservatives realize that China's distorted price
 system needs reforming, but they generally favor
 centrally regulated price adjustments rather than
 relaxation of state price controls. In their view, prices
 of sideline agricultural products and handicrafts may
 vary according to supply and demand, price differen-
 tials should be widened to reflect differences in the
 quality of similar goods, and price ratios should be
 readjusted periodically to encourage production of
 scarce goods.
 Foreign Trade Reforms. Last year, Beijing continued
 to experiment with policies that bring Chinese enter-
 prises, banks, and trade bureaus into closer contact
 with the West; according to the US Consulate in
 Hong Kong, for example, over 100 factories received
 authority to export their products independently of
 the state trading apparatus. Also last year, Beijing
 granted provincial units increased autonomy to raise
 funds abroad-Tor example, by issuing foreign-cur-
 rency-denominated bonds-and allowed the Shenz-
 hen Special Economic Zone (SEZJ ~ to operate a

 regulations were established offering.loreign firms
 increased inducements to invest in China  such as
 the right to hire and fire workers, and tax breaks 4T
 profits are reinvested in the joint venture. ~~
 Although cautious about opening to the West, conser-
 vatives believe that China can benefit from trade with
 capitalist countries if the central government-not
 local authorities-retains complete control over
 China's interaction with foreign corporations and
 banks. For example, they support expansion of Chi-
 nese exports as long as competition for foreign sales
 by Chinese enterprises does not lead to competitive
 price cutting. Chen Yun, Li Peng, and other orthodox
 officials have touted the benefits of imported Western
 equipment, technology, and managerial expertise-
 but they believe that borrowing money from foreign
 countries is a poor method of funding economic
 development. These reservations are based on ideolog-
 ical and practical concerns. Chinese press reports
 indicate conservatives believe that capitalists are out
 to make the most money possible from China and that
 borrowing should not exceed Beijing's ability to repay
 the loans. In particular, they oppose extending bor-
 rowing authority to local ofFicials. Li Peng reiterated
 the conservative apprehension about foreign debt
 when he told Secretary Shultz in March that China
 "would not become another Brazil."
 Conservatives also have been sharply critical of the
 SEZs. According to press             reports,
 orthodox officials believe that the SEZs have not
 attracted the type of Western investment or earned as
 much foreign exchange as reformers promised. A key
 conservative criticism has been that provincial govern-
 ments have used scarce investment funds to set up
 redundant processing industries in the SEZs to earn
 foreign exchange and take advantage of the zones'
 less restrictive import policies. In 1985, Yao Yilin
 reportedly argued that "blood transfusions" of funds
 from provincial governments to the SEZs must end.
 In our view, orthodox officials have not openly
 attacked the policy of allowing foreign joint ventures
 in China because they recognize there are certain
 areas-such as offshore oil exploration  where West-
 ern expertise and financing are necessary. Li Peng
 and other conservatives, however, have criticized the
 preponderance of foreign investment going into hotels
 and restaurants instead of high-tech enterprises. And
 Hu Qiaomu has criticized restrictions on party work
 in joint ventures in the SEZs, implying that without
 party control Chinese workers may be explojted by
 foreign businessmen.
 Signposts
 The debate over China's reform strategy took a
 conservative turn in the wake of senior-level jockeying
 for position following Hu Yaobang's ouster as Party
 General Secretary in January.'? Delegates to a
 National People's Congress Standing Committee ses-
 sion, meeting at about the same time, reportedly
 emphasized the importance of mandatory state plan-
 ning, criticized the lack of sufficient attention to grain
 production, and called for greater "coordination"
 among trade departments. The Chinese media have
 featured senior conservatives, such as Li Peng, assert-
 ing the role of the party in economic decision making
 and advocating "plain living and arduous struggle" by
 workers to build a modern China. In January some
 progressive economists broke off contact with US
 Embassy officers whom they openly met with last fall.
 Zhao Ziyang has attempted to rebuild momentum for
 reform by vigorously defending reformist policies in
 speeches this spring. In his annual work report to the
 full session of the National People's Congress in
 March, Zhao gave a spirited defense of the need for
 new price reforms, and advocated measures that
 would further decentralize economic decision making.
 For instance, he called for wider use of public bidding
 on state construction projects and ordered planners to
 shift more rolled steel from the central plan to the free
 market

 We believe the debate over reform strategy may be
 approaching a critical juncture. In his March speech,
 Z.hao also revealed that a major review of China's
 reform program is under way. A senior Chinese
 economist told the US Embassy in Beijing that Zhao
 tasked participants in the study to construct a com-
 prehensive, coordinated reform blueprint.
 the blueprint will
 be submitted to the 13th Party Congress that is
 scheduled to convene in October. In our judgment,
 reformers probably will use the study-which almost
 certainly will endorse past policies while reassuring
 conservatives of more prudent implementation of new
 measures-to try to build consensus for more exten-
 sive reforms.
 Given what is at stake and the sharp differences in
 how Chinese leaders view the risks of market-oriented
 reforms, a consensus over reform probably will remain
 elusive. Moreover, the ease with which Hu Yaobang
 was sacked-even though his supporters dominated
 important positions throughout the party hierarchy-
 underscores abasic truth of China's system: despite
 efTorts since Mao's time to institutionalize power
 arrangements in party and government positions,
 China remains a system in which one person is
 recognized as the paramount leader-and that person
 can exert strong influence over policy. In a period of
 leadership transition that will see significant turnover
 at the top of an aged leadership, battles over economic
 reform strategy are likely to be lengthy and intense.
 We believe an important indicator of the state of the
 debate over development strategy in China is Beijing's
 willingness to tackle price and ownership reforms.
 Price reform is an integral part of the mainstream
 reform program-inability to implement it will stall
 other reforms. For example, Beijing continues to
 subsidize enterprise losses; in part, because the ir-
 rational price system makes it difficult to determine
 whether firms are losing money because of poor
 management or low state-set prices. But, without the
 threat of bankruptcy, enterprises are not very respon-
 sive to economic levers. Higher interest rates, for
 instance, will not deter borrowing as long as the state
 bails out enterprises that cannot repay their debts:
 ? A State Council circular issued in January stated
 that Beijing would not free prices of any additional
 products this year. Early in 1986, Beijing also ruled
 out price reform for the year, and then went ahead
 with new reforms late last summer. Chinese econo-
 mists have explained to US Embassy officers that
 Beijing is postponing price reforms this year-not
 because of opposition from conservatives but
 because of concerns that excessive demand would
 push prices up if state price controls were removed.
 According to other US Embassy and Consulate
 reporting, Beijing has tightened credit and restrict-
 ed investment expenditures to reduce inflationary
 pressures. In our view, these measures should begin
 to work by midyear. Therefore, if Beijing does not
 ease price controls by the end of the year, we believe
 that will indicate that conservatives have enough
 influence to delay key reforms.
 Reformers continue to call for experiments with
 leasing and issuing shares by small state enterprises,
 but a contact of the US Embassy in Beijing reported
 sharp debate over whether medium and large state
 enterprises should be allowed to sell stocks to their
 workers. We believe a key test of reformers' political
 strength will be whether they are able to conduct
 experiments with stock sales by large state enter-
 prises. Significant broadening of such ideologically
 sensitive experiments-although probably unlikely in
 the short run-would indicate that the ideas of
 China's most progressive economists are making in-
 roads in the thinking of reform leaders:
 ? In our view, Beijing probably will continue with
 limited, tightly controlled experiments with stock
 sales in 1987. The State Council issued regulations

 Secret
 Deng Xiaoping: Arbitrator and Pragmatic Reformer
 Deng Xiaoping-China's paramount leader since the
 Gang of Four was deposed-has played a key role in
 convincing party members that the risks of reform are
 tolerable and in resolving top-level disputes between
 reformers and conservatives. A Hong Kong journal
 de.cc?ribed Deng's role at the Third Plenum of the
 1 ?th Party Congress in October l 984 as an unbiased
 arhitrator who listened to both sides and decided in
 fnvor c~ffurther reform while truing to keep policy
 diNerences from creating animosity between the two
 groups.
 By his own admission, Deng is a layman in the field
 of economics and is not involved in day-to-day policy-
 ntnkittg. In fact, he claimed that he did not write or
 remise a single word in the landmark "Decision on
 Reform of the Economic Structure =approved at
 in April prohibiting state-owned factories from
 issuing shares to the general public and restricting
 stock sales to a small number of enterprises. But, in
 the same week, Beijing also allowed Tianjin-a
 major industrial city-to open asmall-scale securi-
 ties market.)
 The US Stake
 We believe the outcome of the debate over China's
 reform strategy will set the parameters on US-
 Chinese economic relations in the next decade. A
 more conservative approach probably would mean
 the October 1984 Plenum-which extended economic
 reforms to the urban sector. He has been, however,
 the key champion of two politically sensitive econom-
 ic reforms-the opening to the West and the use of
 material incentives.
 Deng publicly has blamed China's backwardness on
 its past closed-door policies, and, according to Hong
 Kong media accounts, was the,first leader to propose
 establishing China's Special Economic Zones and the
 14 "open cities" that are allowed to offer special tax
 and tariff incentives to foreign investors. Deng
 believes that foreign investment is indispensible to
 China's modernization, but has reassured party
 members that, no matter how much foreign capital
 .flows into China, public ownership will dotninate and
 China will retain its socialist system. Deng continues
 to lend personal support to increased contact with the
 West, for instance, by meeting last fall with the
 chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, who was
 visiting China at the invitation of China's central
 bankl   I
 According to Deng, egalitarianism leads to "national
 pauperism" because it erodes incentives to work. He
 rejects the ideological concerns of senior officials who
 fear that wider income disparities will cause class
 polarization, arguing that the criteria for judging
 whether a policy is sound is whether it increases
 China's prosperity. Despite his pragmatism, however,
 he remains,firmly committed to party control.
 would disrupt US markets
 slower growth in bilateral trade and less willingness
 on Beijing's part to borrow from US banks or allow
 US firms to set up operations in China. Strong central
 administration of trade, however, would allow Beijing
 to control the volume and mix of goods exported-
 thereby decreasing the chance that Chinese exports

 Secret
 A reformist strategy probably would increase the
 opportunity for US firms to profit from China's
 modernization. For example, by reforming the price
 system so prices reflect relative scarcities in China-
 and bear closer resemblance to world prices-and by
 casing state controls over access to foreign exchange,
 Beijing would si nificantly improve the climate for
 US investor
 In our view, US firms also would benefit if Beijing
 expanded financial policies it has experimented with
 in the past few years. For instance, China has allowed
 a few foreign banks to set up branches in the Special
 Economic Zones. As Beijing improves its ability to
 control the economy with central bank monetary
 tools, and as it gains experience in regulating these
 foreign branches, we expect Beijing to allow more
 foreign banks in China. In addition, since 1984 China
 has issued over $2 billion in foreign-currency-denomi-
 nated bonds in Japan, Hong Kong, and West
 Germany. According to the US Embassy in Beijing,
 Chinese officials are now considering issuing bonds in
 the United States
 We believe implementation of the reformist strategy
 also would mean faster growth in bilateral trade. In
 particular, Chinese imports of US capital equipment,
 scientific instruments, data processing machines, and
 high-tech products would probably grow rapidly.
 Given the strong demand for machinery, consumer
 goods, and raw materials in China, decentralizing
 trade authority probably would cause China to experi-   25X1
 ence a series of balance-of-trade deficits-therefore,
 China probably would need to step up its borrowing
 from US banks. Moreover, with decreased central
 control over Chinese enterprises, and greater incen-
 tives to sell goods abroad, exports of particular Chi-
 nese commodities could expand rapidly-disrupting
 US markets and causing increased trade frictions."
