 BRIEFLY NOTED
 The Cuban Prison: On 20 August, a Cuban patrol boat intercepted a
 vessel of the port o La Fe, near the western tip of Cuba, which was
 attempting to take 17 Cuban refugees to the U. S. In the gun fight which
 ensued, one of the refugees was killed and two were wounded.  This merely
 serves as a reminder that, whether in Berlin or in Cuba, the authorities
 are obliged to use ruthless methods to keep the population within their
 control.  If such methods were not employed, the resulting mass exodus
 would serve as a living expression of the opinions which may not be
 expressed through a free vote.
 Russian Private Enterprise in Guinea:  Of the 3, 000 odd Soviet tech-
 nicians now engaged in various activities in Guinea, a number are in charge
 of running the nationalized diamond mines in upper Guinea.  Twenty of these
 were arrested in July 1961 after the Guinea police discovered that they were
 smuggling industrial diamonds by sending them out of the country in small
 packages of locally grown coffee beans.  The Guinean government has been
 anxious to prevent this story from being known particularly at this time when
 an effort is being made to stamp out growing corruption in the country.  The
 Russians have tried to persuade the Guinea authorities to send the smugglers
 back to Russia for detention.
 Soviet Science Stumbles:  Although the two events are not known to be
 directly ;elated in any way, we note the comeback of Trofim D. Lysenko,
 Stalin's tsar of genetics, biology, agronomy and botany and the defection of
 Dr. Mikhail A. Klotchko, outstanding Soviet authority in inorganic chemistry
 occurred within one week in mid-August 1961.  Lysenko was re-elected
 president of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences on 8 August. a position
 from which he had been removed in 1956. Lysenko's genetics, derived from
 Marxism rather than research, have earned him the contempt of the world
 scientific community.  Dr. Kiotcho's reputation, in his field, is, on the
 other hand, widely respected.  His defection on 15 August in Ottawa, Canada,
 in his own words, came about because "I could not carry out pure research
 where the scientist is constantly hampered by political considerations. "
 This contrast between the promotion of the politically sound Lysenko and
 the defection of the scientifically dedicated Klotcho affords us an excellent
 opportunity to cast doubt on the much vaunted "advanced" state of Soviet
 science.  (See ADDENDUM Sheet).

 Background: The question of Chinese representation in the United Nations
 will be twelve years old this fall.  Until now there has been little need for
 wide understanding of the question; the UN itself has preferred not to examine
 it.  But during the past year a sufficient number of UN m ember nations have
 expressed a desire for such an examination that a general debate of the question
 during the forthcoming 16th regular session of the UN General Assembly is now
 widely anticipated.
 Since the Chinese People's Republic (CPR) first raised the question in a
 communication to the General Assembly in November 1949, the issue involved
 has been over- simplified.  For the Communists, the issue is the continued merit
 of the Government of the Republic of China (GRC) versus the merit of the CPR
 as the legitimate China UN representative.  The Communist side, through the
 years, has concentrated its efforts in the argument that the CPR regime has
 completely replaced the GRC as the rightful government of China, and that the
 GRC is merely a "corpse" sustained by the US on Taiwan.  With the issue reduced
 to these terms, the relative size of the territories and populations governed by
 the CPR and GRC respectively has tended to obscrue all other considerations.
 The US, on the other hand, has claimed that the CRC is the continuing
 political entity that became a founding member of the UN in 1945 and is yet the
 legal government of China.  The US also explained that the CPR -toes not qualify
 for UN membership.  On the basis of these two fundamental arguments the US
 has successfully presented its annual moratorium against General Assembly
 debate of the China question.
 There are only two ways under the UN Charter and Rules of Procedure by
 which the GPR can gain admission to the UN: (1) admission as a new member
 nation, and (2) admission as a replacement delegation for the GRC via an
 Assembly-approved credentials decision disavowing the GRC's UN credentials.
 The CPR has consistently refused to apply for new nation membership.  Thus,
 the main Communist thrust this fall is expected to be aimed - as in all 11
 past years - at the credentials approach.
 The main Communist effort will doubtless be made in the regular session
 scheduled to begin on .1.9 September.  It is quite possible that as last year, a
 Soviet Union or Soviet-inspired request will be presented calling for inclusion
 of the China representation question on the Assembly agenda.  Stations should be
 on the alert for this Soviet action, which occurred on 5 September last year.
 This request would then be considered by the Assembly's General, or
 Steering, Committee around the time of the 19 September session  opening.  In
 the absence of a US-sponsored moratorium against approval of the Soviet request,
 the Committee will undoubtedly schedule the question for inclusion in the agenda
 for Assembly debate this fall.
 The Communists' effort to secure the CPR's admission to the UN is not a
 simple demand that it be admitted to that body as a new nation.  What they have
 insisted upon, and will probably demand this fall, is admission of the CPR as
 a replacement of the GRC delegation.  This would involve a decision by the General
 Assembly disavowing the credentials of the GRC as a charter member of the
 organization thus depriving that government of any UN-backed international

 e standing. A s sir o t~i R e, the CPR could be expected to claim China's place
 on the Security Council as a permament member with full veto power.
 Either before or at the time such a demand is made, it is probable that the
 US will counter by seeking to have the    China question declared an "important
 question" which, under UN General Assembly Rule of Procedure 18, would require
 a two-thirds vote for passage of any resolution arising from debate of the
 question. (NOTE: Please read State Action Circular 253, dated 11 August 1961,
 for full explanation of the ''important question" tactic. )

 421.  The Draft of the New CPSU Program
 Background: On 30 July, the CPSU released a 47, 000 word draft
 of its new  arty program, adopted by the Central Committee for submission
 to the 22nd party Congress, scheduled to open in Moscow on 17 October.
 Formally, this new program is to replace the old party program, which
 is now largely obsolete, adopted in 1919.  That earlier program, written in
 the midst of civil war and overshadowed by the pressing difficulties of the
 newly established Soviet regime, was in the main limited to a statement
 of general principles, followed by a fairly meager catalog of short-range
 objectives.  The new draft, however, is far more ambitious: it attempts to
 cover the past, the present and at least 20 years of the future in a great
 wealth of detail, treating political, economic, cultural and administrative
 matters.  It claims applicability not only for the Soviet Union, but for the
 other Bloc countries and the free world, too.
 The principal characteristics of the new program may be summarized
 as follows:
 1.  It reflects the dangerous over-confidence of Khrushchev and
 his followers in a language possible only in a totalitarian country,
 where a document of this kind is safe from public criticism or
 questioning--over-confidence based on the conviction that
 communism is the irresistible wave of the future and that all
 other forms of government and society are doomed, thereby
 sharply increasing the danger of war by miscalculation.
 2.  It reiterates the well-worn formula of "peaceful coexistence"
 and confirms thatwar between Communist and "imperialist"
 countries is "not fatally inevitable, " provided, of course, that
 the latter peacefully surrender.  It also endorses again "wars of
 liberation, "  alleging that all wars serving the Communist cause
 are "just. f,
 3.  It promises the populations of the Soviet Union a long, very
 detailed list of material incentives and tangible advantages, ranging
 from higher wages to better supply of consumer goods and from
 rural electrification to apartments for newlyweds.

 4.  It boasts of surpassing the capitalist countries, especially
 the US, within the next 20 years, in gross national product,
 industrial and agricultural output, productivity of labor and
 standard of living --making, however.,the fulfillment of these
 and all other material promises dependent upon peace and
 disarmament.
 5.  It stresses the leading role of the CPSU in the World
 Communist movement by (a) claiming that the Soviet Union alone is
 now "building communism" ("Communism" is considered the ultimate
 goal, while the other Bloc countries are merely building "socialism"),
 (b) minimizing the significance of the Chinese revolution and of the
 achievements of other Bloc and non-Bloc Communist Parties,
 (c) providing a blueprint for all other Communist Parties, based on
 an authoritative analysis of the capitalist world and its inevitable
 downfall, (d) omitting any reference to the Moscow Declaration 1960
 which proclaimed the independence and equality of all Communist
 Parties, on either side of the iron curtain.
 6.  It omits the name of Stalin, even in the context of actions
 for which he was unquestionably responsible and mentions only
 Lenin by name, ignoring Mao Tse Tung,  Khrushchev, or any
 other leader.
 Massive exploitation of the draft and of its alleged impact on both
 Communist and non-Communist audiences by all Communist propaganda...
 media stresse,  the fact that the Communists consider this not only an
 important text for policy direction and indoctrination of their own followers,
 but a major propaganda weapon aimed at neutral and "imper ialist"
 countries as well.  Within 24 hours after the publication of the draft,
 radio Moscow and many other Communist media started this build-up
 (disregarding the obvious fact that nobody could be expected to render an
 intelligent judgement of a paper of this length and complexity within a
 few hours after it was published).  A PRAVDA correspondent from New
 York, for instance, reported under the title "Despondency and Confusion"
 that the rulers of the Free World have no answer to the "calm and wise
 words of the draft program, imbued with an invincible faith in the triumph
 of communism. " Radio Moscow domestic service claimed:  "Comments in
 the press by representatives of U. S. Government circles and a number of othe-
 political leaders  are full of undisguised alarm and concern.  None of them
 risks doubting the reality and attainability of the plans of our people. "

 Innumerable other Communist news reports and commentaiAes
 stressed the impression the draft made in other parts of the world, not
 even omitting West Germany (even though it might have suited their
 pattern of vilification against Chancellor Adenauer better, if they could
 have claimed that his "Nazi-revanchist dictatorship" had suppressed the
 news of the program altogether.) Communist propaganda also repeatedly
 boasted of the fact that The New York Times had reprinted the full text
 of the draft--even though this might have reminded their audiences that
 they are hardly ever allowed to see the text of non-Communist documents or
 policy statements.                                                                    25X1 C10b

 422.  INTER-AMERICAN COOPERATION: The Act of Punta del Este
 Background: All members of the Organization of American States
 (OAS) signed a broad charter for economic and social reform at Punta
 del Este, Uruguay, on 17 August 1961, except Cuba, whose representative,
 Ernesto "Che" Guevara, however, attended the nearly three weeks of
 deliberation, and The Dominican Republic, which is still under diplomatic
 and economic sanctions imposed by the OAS last year.  The Act of Punta
 del Este is the most far reaching program of economic development ever
 drawn up by the United States and foreign nations.  It calls for a twenty
 billion dollar investment over a ten year period.   More than half of this
 sum, some in low interest loans, will come from the United States
 Government.  The rest will come from international agencies, Western
 European and private sources, both European and North American.  Hence,
 the plan represents not only an ambitious schedule by the United States
 Government, but is the first example of massive coordinated public and
 private Free World assistance to developing nations.
 The reform goals of the Act of Punta del Este are addressed to both
 fundamental general social needs and to certain specific problems. The
 general goals are to achieve land and tax reforms, aimed at the redistri-
 bution of land holdings, now concentrated in the hands of a minority, and
 redistribution of the national income and the sharing of the costs of social
 services by all members of the population.  The specific problems addressed
 include; six years of free schooling for all children, literacy for the-fifty
 million illiterates in the hemisphere, eradication of malaria, large-scale
 public housing, and potable water for more than half of the population now
 exposed to polluted water supplies.
 An additional feature of the Act, particularly important to most of
 the Latin American nations, deals with commodity pricing and trade
 agreements. Fluctuating commodity prices and foreign competitive markets
 are the bane of most of these countries who depend on the export of a very
 few basic crops or minerals to finance their governments and provide
 private as well as public capital.  Therefore, they seek to stabilize their
 export incomes by international agreement.  At Punta del Este, the United
 States, which consumes most of the Latin American exports, said it would
 join a new agreement on coffee, the basic export of Colombia and Brazil,
 and consider joining the agreement on tin, Bolivia's principal export.

 While the other detegates concentrated on these economic problems,
 Cuba's Economic Minister, "Che" Guevara devoted his efforts to politics.
 He attempted to convince the other Latin American representatives by
 public speeches and private lobbying, that Cuba should be treated as a
 cooperative member of the OAS community, that tI  extensive subversive
 activities of Cuba throughout the area were a figment of "Yanqui" imagination
 and that the differences between Cuba and the United States were matters of
 concern to those two countries alone and not a hemisphere problem.  This
 approach met with some success.  Guevara was praised by the Brazilian
 representative for his "constructive" work, and, following the conference,
 he received a decoration from the Brazilian government.  However, the
 Cuban currency confiscation (See Item #415, Bi-Weekly Propaganda
 Guidance #71, dated 14 August 1961) appears to have caused concern among
 foreigners about doing business with Cuba and to have revealed clearly
 that the new "reasonable" approach of the Cubans is dictated by the economic
 plight that totalitarian controls have brought to Cuba.  On 21 August, Radio
 Mambi, ordinarily one of Castro's most strident propaganda organs,
 broadcast dramatic news of the plight.  Radio Mambi pointed out that
 because of acute shortages of products and the new currency program,
 people are being forced to present only peso bills in payment even for
 small purchases.  Mambi asks, "if a person earning three pesos a day has
 to spend one peso each time he goes to the store, because no small change
 is available, how can he possibly make out?" On the same day as the Radio
 Mambi broadcast, the representatives of 26 nations maintaining diplomatic
 establishments in Havana signed a joint protest demanding the return of
 equivalent new pesos for the old pesos they were forced to surrender on
 6 August.  The Cuban government not only has held these funds for longer
 than originally promised but has announced a restrictive schedule of      25X1C10b
 repayment when such repayment actually takes place,

 42`  1CTJ Berlin Crisis: Encouraging Communist Opposition
 Background: In the morning hours of 13 August, the East German
 regime, supported by two or three Soviet divisions, used tanks, barbed
 wire and machine guns, to seal off West Berlin.  Mr. Khrushchev's consent
 to such a drastic and provocative measure, coming after several years of
 pleading by Comrade Ulbricht (who has steadfastly claimed that he could
 not compete with West Berlin as long as the Berlin escape hatch continued
 to drain the cream of his industrial and professional manpower), shows
 the extent of deterioration in East Germany.  To have risked provoking
 the West at a time when he was seeking negotiations, to invite an anti-
 Communist uprising in East Germany, and to disillusion many a hitherto
 sympathetic neutral indicate that Khrushchev considered Ulbricht's regime
 to be on the verge of complete collapse.
 While Mr. Khrushchev's precipitous action has met with the inevitable
 echoes of approbation in Bloc propaganda, it is not hard to imagine, that
 among Communist Parties e-verywhere, the idea of supporting Germans -
 albeit Communist Germans - at the risk of atomic war, will not arouse
 great enthusiasm.  Meanwhile, neutralist opinion, which prior to Khrushchev?':
 Berlin demarche had held Western intransigence as much to blame as
 Russian aggression, appalled by Khrushchev's reckless resort to force,
 has begun to regard the Western position with greater sympathy and     25X1C10b
 understanding.

 25X41f4 0bLessons from the Congo
 Background: No sooner had the Congo gained its independence on 30 Jun(:
 1960 than Soviet Russia and her satellites, Czechoslovakia in particular,
 moved in with every means at their disposal, quite certain that the extensive
 groundwork, carried out for the past few years, particularly in the field of
 penetration and subversion, would rapidly turn the Congo into another Soviet
 pawn and introduce another form of foreign domination in a newly ?independn.
 African country. Under Patrice Lt.mumba, the Congo's first Prime Minister,
 whose experience in international politics was very limited, the fledgling
 Congo government was overrun by Communist advisors and the country flooded
 with tons of propaganda leaflets and pamphlets.  Faced with an army mutiny,
 which was largely Communist inspired, and the presence of Belgian troops Tv -v-
 had entered the Congo to protect Belgian residents, Lumumba appealed on
 10 July 1960 to the UN for military assistance in the mistaken belief that he
 could use UN forces to suppress his political enemies and solidify his political
 power.  The UN, however, quite normally refused to take sides in what was a
 purely internal quarrel and, when Lumumba discovered that the UN was not
 about to act as his executive agent in order to extend his authority and dislodge
 his political opponents, he called directly upon the Soviet Bloc for assistance,
 thus providing an entering wedge for unilateral Soviet intervention.
 Calculated to undermine the effort of the UN, the unilateral policy of the
 Soviets in the Congo was designed to press their initial advantage by enhancing
 the build-up of the Communists with the addition of military support. The
 net result of this Soviet intervention and of Communist support enabled
 Lumumba to defy the UN, seriously impeding its activities and thus thwarting
 the attempts by the Congolese to develop some degree of order and working
 institutions. The final blow came in early September when Antoine Gizerlga,
 Lumumba's deputy, appealed to Communist China to send volunteers, arms,
 ammunition, planes, artillery, tanks, funds and food. The Communists thus
 overplayed their hand with such a blatant build-up and with such an obvious
 grab for power that, for the Congolese people, a change of government
 appeared to be the only way to avoid reversion to colonial status. President
 Kasavubu, in the proper exercise of his constitutional authority, therefore
 dismissed the Lumumba government and designated a new government under
 Joseph Ileo. Lumurnba and his followers were unwilling to allow presentation
 of the new government for Parliamentary approval, however, and their con-
 tinued illegal agitation against this government threatened to return the whole
 country to chaos. A military coup, designed to neutralize all factions tem-
 porarily, was therefore carried out by Col. Mobutu. on 14 September. The
 Soviets continued their determined effort to paralyze the UN by refusing to
 contribute funds for the Congo operation and by insisting on the withdrawal of
 the UN troops from that country. Conditions in the Congo remained unstable.
 Patrice Lumumba was assassin ated in early 1961 and Gizenga maintained an
 illegal separatist regime in Stanleyville.

 The basic effort of the UN throughout this entire turbulent life of the
 Congo Republic has continued to be to assist the Congolese to reunify their
 country under a government approved by parliament and to build the Congo into
 a viable and stable state, (The UN effort has also been useful in avoiding a
 clash between the major powers in the Congo.) Having realized the need for a
 unified central government, the Congolese parliament unanimously elected
 Cyriile Adoula, a progressive labor leader and ardent nationalist, on 30 July
 1961 to attempt to achieve that goal. Unfortunately, although Antoine Gizenga,
 ostensibly dissolved his dissident government in Stanleyville after the election
 of Adoula, there are indications that he is still far from willing to collaborate
 fully with the legitimate central government. A radical opportunist who first
 ;amped aboard Lumumba's bandwagon, he still appears to be under the influenc
 of the numbrous Soviet, Commu.nist Chinese, East German and other foreign
 advisors who installed themselves in Stanleyville as alleged diplomats. In
 addition, he has continued to receive supplies of arms by means of flights which
 --e not authorized by the Central government. These arms serve to reinforce
 :axe forces ci General Lundula who, although having asserted his allegiance to thv
 riew central government still refuses to integrate his troops into the National
 Army. Such clandestine arms imports clearly violate the Security Council
 resolution and are reminiscent of the early days of Congolese independence
 when the Communists flew in large quantitites of arms in order to further thei55X1C10b
 own aims.

 A FALSE PROBLEM:  THE RECOGNITION OF COMMUNIST CHINA
 by Ci tude .:,armel
 (From the French-language periodical Et et Ouest, Paris, No. 258, 16-31 May
 1961, pages 1 - 4.)
 From time to time, someone raises the question: Should the Western
 governments recognize the Chinese People's Republic? Should they accept or
 propose its admission to the UN? And each time some stalwart spirits are
 found who wonder if the answer should not be yes, if Western intransigence is
 iot unreasonable, and if the West is not once more fighting for a position
 already lost, against an enemy who has tradition, common sense, and opportunity
 on his side.
 It is in fact traditional to recognize states or governments establishedby
 force of arms against the legitimate authorities as of the moment when their
 de facto government has manifestly assumed real authority and as soon as they
 control the population and can undertake and fulfill agreements in the name of
 the country. Is it not against all common sense and logic for China to be
 represented in the UN by the Chiang Kai-shek government which rules over 6
 million people on Formosa, rather than by the Peking government which
 dominates 600 or 650 million Chinese? Does it not approach the ridiculous to
 defend the presence of Taiwan China among the "Big Five", where it has the right
 to veto UN decisions? Is it opportune to continue to exclude Mao Tse-tung's
 China while both newly formed and some older governments in Africa, Asia, and
 Latin America are establishing diplomatic relations with that country, so many
 of them doing so that there is the risk that before long the UN General Assembly
 will include more supporters than opponents of the admission of Communist
 China? And certain persons do not fail to add, that while such a change of
 attitude toward Communist China might not bring its government into closer
 sympathy with the West, it would at least weaken its ties to the Soviet government
 and encourage it to pursue an independent foreign policy, which it cannot do at
 present owing to the kind of diplomatic bloc policy it is forced to Ifollow.
 This line of argument is used largely by those who would grant the enemy
 what he demands of them in the name of their own principles, instead of refusing
 him what he wants in the light of his principles. They are mired in the concept
 of international law which they have devised for themselves, a concept which they
 alust readily admit can never be universally applied by those govern ments which
 subscribe to it, inasmuch as it is not and will not be sincerely accepted by all
 governments. Still, the devotion of these persons to their ideal, which serves
 to strengthen the Chinese Communist government in its demands, should not be
 ,:.xaggerated. Many of these idealists, the majority of them perhaps, would
 scream bloody murder if the Madrid government were to propose Spain's candida-
 c ure for admission to the UN. Nonetheless, the arguments adduced in support of
 Communist China also work for Spain; while the charges that can be levelled
 against the Franco regime (assuming them to have some validity in international
 law) are incomparably less serious than the charges which are made, by the
 very people who wonder if a representative of the Peking government should not
 be admitted to the UN, against the regime which has imposed itself on the Chinese
 mainland.
 History has a logic of its own, which does not always coincide with what we
 abusively call Cartesian logic. What seems today to be an anomaly is readily
 explained when we take into account the events of the last 20 years. Or is 20
 years too long a span for the human memory to accommodate ? Are we, by a sort
 of refusal to face the present, going to force society into a precipitate advance
 which can lead only to destruction? It is sufficient for us to remember the
 Second World War, and the presence of Nationalist China on the Security Council
 loses its supposedly artificial and arbitrary character. It again becomes intelli-
 gible. This reality is rational, to paraphrase Hegel.
 A leftover, shall we say? The institutional residue of a reality that no longer
 exists ? Perhaps. But right and justi ce are made up of just such leftovers: if this
 were not so, we would have to resign ourselves to a free-for-all. We try to create
 an international law: this requires at least that right of force and of victory be
 limited, that for might to be victorious should no longer suffice to make it right.

 No doubt the moment will always come when we will have to throw up the sponge
 and recognize, with Bismarck, that might precedes right. But at least this should
 be postponed as long as possible, until there is no alternative, and until we have
 kept the contemners of the right in purgatory long enough for them to have shed
 their old habits. And while we wait, so far from grieving over the "Chinese
 scandal", the promoters of international law among the society of nations should
 use it for the edification of their peoples.
 For the rest, anyone who is shocked by the Chinese anomaly should stupify
 himself by taking a look at any of a number of other illogical situations. The
 Ukraine is a member of the UN, as is Belorussia. Are these, then, independent
 *.)ations ? What powers have recognized them and sent ambassadors to their
 ;overnments ? The Soviet government endowed them with embryonic foreign
 ministries, but deemed it unnecessary to carry the comedy further. A fine exam-
 rIe of a left-over from the days when the credulous West believed in an incon-
 ceeivable metamorphosis of communists into liberals, and in the tranformation
 Of the supposed Soviet "federation" into a kind of Commonwealth.
 And Germany? Germany is one of the great world powers. Why isn't
 someone indignant because it is not represented in the  UN? This too is a leftover,
 one which recalls that the UN consisted in the beginning of nations "united" against
 Germany. The division of Germany has so far made it impossible to admit that
 country, since to do so would sanction a division which the Germans do not accept.
 And so we have had to stick to the status quo. But where is the logic in resigning
 ,neself to this sort of fatality when it concern s Germany and refusing to accept
 it in the case of the Chinese?
 Germany, China, Korea, and Vietnam have been partitioned, and it is the
 "communist fact" which is responsible. Let the communists themselves, then,
 accept this partition and its consequences, instead of denouncing the arbitrariness
 of the free countries. And if they urge the numerical superiority argument in
 support of Peking, let us remind them that West Germany has a greater population
 that "democratic" Germany, and that on the basis of that argument the right to
 represent all Germans in the UN should fall to the Bonn government.
 Finally, we fail to see what claim Communist China has to the Security
 Council seat now occupied by Nationalist China. This seat is reserved for a
 charter member, which is why it i s normal to see it occupied today as it was
 in the beginning, despite changes in the balance of power throughout the world.
 China is represented in this small body, which dominates or serves as a founda-
 tion for the UN, because of the achievements of Chiang Kai-shek and because of
 the role he played in the founding of this institution. We fail to see how Mao Tse-
 tung could take over the heritage of an authority whose legitimacy he not only
 genies today but has denied in the past. The departure of Nationalist China from
 the Security Council would require a complete remoulding of the organization.
 One would then logically have to take into account the current balance of power
 in reconstituting this body. And vhy, in that case, should not India be preferred
 over China, or Japan, for that matter, or Egypt; and why should Germany not
 replace France ? The moment the historical criterion is abandoned, we are left
 with other criteria which are even core arbitrary. For no one knows how to
 demonstrate conclusively which nations are the "great" nations, or which others
 are "medium" or "small" nations.
 Nationalist China's right to be one of the Big Five touches on the very
 foundation of the institution and to dispute that right is to shake the entire edifice .
 Since its government has not voluntarily renounced this right, it will not be
 possible to take it away by force without at the same time authorizing all other
 governments to consider themselves no longer bound by the agreements they have
 entered into.
 What is the objective of the Chinese communists in demanding admission to
 the UN and recognition of their gov.-rnment by the powers which are now officially
 ignoring it? Despite the claims cf t~,.ose who believe that the-e are basic differ-
 et,.cCg s between Moscow and Peking, we would not see them defending, in the UN,
 ary policies but those of the USSR; and it is certainly not for the sake of being
 able to support Soviet proposals in the Security Council and in the General
 Assembly that they find the effort worthwhile.

 What they really want is to win a victory over Chiang Kai-shek and at the
 same time over the entire free world. Mao Tse-tung and Hs colleagues refuse
 any recognition which is not accompanied by a withdrawal of recognition from
 the Formosa government. They do not say "Recognize us as the government of
 continental China, " but "Stop recognizing the government of Formosa and con-
 sider us as the legitimate government of all China, including Formosa. " In
 other words, they demand not only the legitimization of a de facto situation, but
 alsb assistance in the realization of their ambitions, ambitions against a
 government with which the West is on friendly terms.
 What a triumph it would be for the communists if they could thus prove to
 the governments of Asia and Africa how fragile is the friendship of the Western
 powers, how unreliable their word.
 What do they offer in return to those governments that would recognize
 them? Nothing. What advantages would these governments derive from the
 concession that recognition would constitute ? None. The British government,
 faithful to an empiricism which is at times cynical without. being clairvoyant,
 _'ecognized Mao Tse-Tung's government shortly after his victory. We still may
 wonder what  benefits Great Britain has realized from this: not even the benefit
 of being less injured than the rest, not even preferential treatment in trade.
 Under such conditions, recognition is a game for dupes.
 The day the Peking authorities really want to be recognized, they will let it
 be known that they are ready to make the necessary concessions. One might then
 discuss it. In the meantime it would be ridiculous and dangerous to go to them in
 order to ask them their price for consenting to be recognized, since such recog-
 nition would produce no benefit, neither for France, nor for the other free
 nations, nor yet for the cause of world peace.
 The recognition of Communist China and its admission to the UN constitute
 one of those pseudo-problems which t he communists are skilled in exploiting
 against the West. There is, of course, a certain illogic in China's current UN
 representation, as there is in the fact that Berlin represents an enclave of the
 free world in the bosom of the world of servitude. This illogic comes as no
 surprise to people who have a sense of history. The existence of the Principality
 of Monaco and of the Republic of San Marino is also illogical, anachronistic,
 and absurd; but it embarrasses no one. Similarly, the status quo could be
 indefinitely prolonged in Berlin or in Formosa, without constituting any danger to
 world order. If these alleged absesses seem today to be giving the world a fever,
 this is simply because the communist leaders (who are agitators first and fore-
 most) need to foment unrest in the free world in order to obtain profitable
 concessions on this or that point and to advance their cause. This is the whole
 secret behind these crises; one must need to be truly ill-informed to believe them
 capable of unleashing a general war.
 The West must discard the illusions of a too easy idealism and rediscover
 the old truth which taught that in the affairs of nation s, as in the affairs of men,
 a thing is no sooner finished than it must be begun all over. This bit of wisdom
 would be the best armament against the undertakings of the communists, even
 for those persons who think the West has no ideals with which to oppose
 communism. If. they want tranquility above all things and if they think they can
 get it in this world, if they are ready to make any and all concessions in order
 to solve all the problems once and for all because they imagine that all problems
 can be solved once and for all, then they may be certain that they will know no
 rest. They will no sooner have dearly bought their tranquility, than the commun-
 ists will raise new problems, just as artificial and just as irritating as ever.
 The best course, then, is simply to resign ourselves to living with these
 pseudo-problems typified by the Formosan problem; and to let them gradually
 become "good old problems", admittedly insoluble and no longer profitable
 to the Soviets because the whole world will have adjusted to them; the kind
 of problems which are far less dangerous to leave alone than to solve.
