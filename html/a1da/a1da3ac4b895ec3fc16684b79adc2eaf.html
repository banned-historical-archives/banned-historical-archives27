 a.  It will be recalled that before and after the 2lst
 Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU)
 (Moscow, 27 January - 5 February 1959) officials of the CPSU
 held secret discussions with representatives of the Communist
 parties in attendance in order to assess developments in the
 International Communist Movement since the last general
 meeting of Communist parties in November 1957.  The discus -
 sions ranged from a consideration of broad questions of
 Communist propaganda and relations between parties to an
 examination of tactics and operations.  A special clandestine
 conference of Latin American Communist party delegates
 brought out the high degree of interest of the USSR and the
 CPSU in developments in Latin America, and made more
 concrete the program of action, developed for Latin America
 in Moscow during the November 1957 special meetings.  When
 the foreign delegates later traveled to China, Chinese Com-
 munist leaders gave them strong indications of their desire to
 expand Peiping's influence, ar_.d made offers of training in
 Chinese experience              onary- tactics.  This was
 reported i                        ~ 6 April 1959. The following
 report furnishes further evidence of the importance of Latin
 America to the CPSU and the Communist Party of China, and
 of their efforts to strengthen the Latin American Communist
 parties.

 the Communist Party of Brazil (PCB)l, met with members of

 the Central Committee of the PCB residing in the area of Sao
 Paulo on 16 January 1960 to discuss the trip to Communist
 China and the Soviet Union during 29 September - 9 December
 1959 of a delegation from the PCB, consisting of Prestes,            25X1
 Carlos Nicolau Danielli, and Ramiro Luches             '
 Section VI, which has been issued separately
 of 10 March 1960), is included here for purposes
 of completeness.
 2.   The Delegation's Visit to China.
 a.   Mao Tse-tung criticized the way the CPSU-
 handled the denigration of Stalin, praised Molotov, and
 asserted that peaceful disentanglement is a theory which has
 no historical precedent and that all Communist parties
 throughout the world should be ready to fight.
 b.   The Brazilian delegation was given several
 lectures, one of them reportedly by Mao Tse-tung, on Chinese
 Communist party and governmental problems.  A significant
 point made was that the class struggle in China will not end
 for another twenty to fifty years.  The Chinese Revolution,
 and others throughout the world, are a continuation of the
 October Revolution, and China is following the struggles of
 the Communist parties in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, and
 other Latin American countries with considerable interest.

 c.   The Brazilian delegation itself gave talks and
 lectures in different places, including a school for Latin
 American Communists which formerly gave courses on an
 informal basis for visiting Communists, but has now developed
 a formal curriculum and school program.
 d.   Several meetings of all of the Latin American
 delegations were planned, but none actually took place.  In the
 course of informal talks the following was decided:
 (1)  In the event of imperialist intervention in
 Cuba, other Latin American countries, led by their Communist
 parties, will give complete support to the Castro government.
 (2)  An armed revolution in Argentina in the
 near future is inevitable and the Communist Party of Argentina
 will probably align itself with the Peronists.
 (3)  A Latin American Congress must be held
 to discuss the formation of a Latin American labor organization
 to replace the moribund Confederation of Latin American
 Workers, the regional WFTU affiliate.
 a.   The Brazilian delegation met in Moscow with
 Khrushchev and with members of the Secretariat and Presidium
 of the CPSU.  Although CPSU leaders agreed with the present
 policies of the PCB, they believed that the PCB should attempt
 to gain greater mass influence over workers and farmers and
 participate more actively in mass movements, even when it is
 unable to play the leading role in these movements at the outset.

 b. M. A. Suslov stated that the class struggle
 should be stimulated, pointing out that the principal danger of
 the PCB today is revisionism, reformism and opportunism
 because of the strong penetration of bourgeois ideology.  He
 remarked that Moscow viewed the PCB's support of the presi-
 dential candidacy of the reactionary Marshal Henrique
 Teixeira Lott as a matter of tactics rather than principle.  He
 told the Brazilians that the revolution might be carried out
 peacefully, but he added that they must "be prepared for the
 other possibility. " He stressed the need for discipline and the
 importance of elevating the prestige of the PCB's Central
 Committee since the struggle against the personality cult tends
 to reduce the prestige of Party leaders.
 c.   O. V. Kuusinen remarked to the delegation
 that it was important to remember that Brazil is not a colony
 but an independent nation reduced by imperialism to the
 conditions of a monocultured country.  He stated that he did
 not understand why the PCB's policy declaration of March 1958
 did not call for the confiscation of North American businesses
 and capital and the annulment of all treaties and agreements
 prejudicial to the best interests of Brazil.  (The above contrasts
 with the views expressed by Mao to members of the Chilean
 delegation visiting Peiping in October 1959, in which he referred
 to Latin America as a colonial area still dominated by the forces
 of imperialism and in which he urged the Latin American people
 to unite in a struggle for liberation. )
 d.   After leaving the Soviet Union, the Brazilian
 delegation visited Poland, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany.
 In Poland, Gomulka outlined some of the problems the

 Communist Party of Poland has had to face, such as farm
 collectivization and the rapid decline in coal exports which
 had created a serious economic problem.     In East Germany,
 the PCB was invited to send a journalist to co-ordinate
 propaganda and write articles about Latin America, and was
 also requested to send films showing strikes and describing
 the economic plight of the masses in Brazil.
 4. Special Treatment of Brazil.  Delegations repre-
 senting seventy-one Communist parties, including eighteen
 Latin American Communist parties, were in Communist China
 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese Communist
 revolution.  The Communist parties of the Dominican Republic
 and of Haiti were not represented.  The delegation representing
 the Communist Party of Peru arrived too late to take part in the
 ceremonies.  The ceremonies were held in the Chinese Com-
 munist parliament (apparently the Great Hall of the People --
 the assembly hall of the National People's Congress), where all
 of the representatives of the foreign Communist parties spoke,
 congratulating Communist China on its official birthday, and
 lauding the regime for its achievements.  The Brazilian dele-
 gation was treated as the representative of one of the world's
 most important Communist parties outside the Communist bloc.
 At the commemorative celebrations the foreign delegations were
 invited to speak in the order of their importance.  After the
 Communist countries came France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan,
 and Brazil.  The Brazilian delegation was treated with respect
 and deference out of proportion to that accorded to delegations
 representing other Communist parties.

 5.   Lectures Attended.   The Brazilian delegation
 attended a series of lectures on the following subjects:  the
 great leap forward, the internal party struggle, communes,
 construction of the party, the united front, relations with the
 bourgeoisie, social problems such as elimination of gangsterism
 and prostitution, hygiene and public health in Shanghai, work
 among agricultural communities, and the armed struggle. (It
 has also been reported that the PCB delegation attended three
 lectures in all during its stay in China.  Another Latin American
 CP delegation in China, that of Panama, is also known to have
 attended at least one lecture.  It is probable that other CP
 delegations besides that of the PCB were at these lectures,
 although Prestes does not reveal this information.) All of the
 lectures on the above subjects were given in either Peiping or
 Shanghai.  The Brazilian delegation also travelled to other
 cities, visiting factories, collective farms, and universities
 6.   School for Latin American Communists,   The
 Brazilian delegation gave talks and lectures in different places
 in Communist China, including one which was given at a school
 for Latin American Communists.  (The school for Latin
 American Communists is undoubtedly the one which, beginning
 in 1958, has scheduled a new course each year for Latin
 American Communist trainees.        No PCB members have been
 reported in this school to date.)  The courses offered at this
 school last between three and four months, and consist of both
 lectures and field trips.    Formerly, the trips and lectures
 were given on an informal basis for visiting Communists, but
 they have now developed into a formal curriculum and school
 program.  Lectures along the lines of those mentioned above
 are given, but they are on practical rather than theoretical

 Communist problems.  The Brazilian delegation was invited to
 send members of the PCB to this school.
 7.   Meetings with Mao.
 a.   The Brazilian delegation met briefly with Mao
 Tse -tung, who spoke almost exclusively on Communist China
 and its problems, making little mention of other Communist
 parties.  Mao did, however, tell the Brazilian delegation that
 the PCB should stress work among the Brazilian farmers,
 despite the continued industrial growth of the country.  Mao
 also mentioned the problem of internal party dissension, saying
 that many Communist parties had had to fight leftist deviation
 for so long that the  had lost sight of the necessity for curbing
 rightist deviation.
 24 February 1960, states that during its
 stay in Communist China the Brazilian delegation was warned
 by leaders of the Communist Party of China, including Mao
 Tse-tung, not to lose sight of curbing rightist deviation.  In-a
 meeting with leaders of the CPSU in Moscow, the Brazilian
 delegation was criticized for allowing bourgeois ideology to
 penetrate the PCB and for not placing sufficient emphasis on
 the class struggle and efforts to gain control of the worker-
 farmer proletarian masses.  In line with this criticism have
 been the views of a significant group of leftist members of the
 PCB Central Committee. These members do not disagree with
 the strong emphasis on the anti-imperialist struggle as out-
 lined in the document prepared by the Theses Commission for
 the 5th PCB National Congress, but insist that sufficient
 importance be given to the struggle of workers and farmers
 against exploitation by capitalists and large landowners.  They

 8.   Meetings with other Latin American Groups.  The
 Brazilian delegation also met with many members of other
 Latin American delegations. I       I another CP has
 reported that the Latin American delegates in China held a

 Chinese CP representatives were present at the conference.
 The agenda was reported as defense of the Cuban revolution,
 the Latin American Peoples' Congress in defense of national
 resources, and the peace congress.) Several meetings of all

 also believe that the basic aim of the party should be to control
 and lead the proletariat and that the PCB should not abandon
 the class struggle by overemphasizing alliances with the
 bourgeoisie for electoral and other purposes. )
 b.   Mao made the following statements to visiting
 delegations from foreign Communist parties regarding CPSU
 policies:
 (1)  The denigration of Josef Stalin was
 handled by the CPSU in a very negative and abrupt manner,
 which dismissed all the merits which Stalin had.
 (2)  Molotov is a valiant party member with a
 world of experience.
 (3)  Peaceful disentanglement is a theory
 which has no historical precedent.  Those who want peace
 must prepare themselves. for war.   All Communist parties
 throughout the world should be ready to fight.

 actually took place.  One such meeting was planned to discuss
 Cuba and the coming Latin American Peoples' Congress. (In
 late November 1959 the same source reported that Pedro
 Ventura de Araujo Pomar, a member of the CC of the PCB,
 had recently returned from a trip to Cuba, where he had met
 with representatives of the Communist parties of Cuba,
 Venezuela, Chile, and Argentina to discuss the organization
 of the Latin American Peoples' Congress.  March 1960 was set
 as the tentative date for the holding of this congress.) It was
 later decided that, since representatives of different Latin
 American Communist parties were, at that very moment,
 meeting in Cuba to discuss the same matter, it would not be
 worthwhile to hold another meeting 12, 000 miles away.

 9.   Relations between the PCB and other Latin
 American CP's,   Relations between the PCB and other Latin
 American Communist parties have been somewhat strained in
 recent years, and the PCB has been partly responsible for
 this situation.  Much of the hostility was caused by Diogenes
 Lopes de Arruda Camara, who was formerly responsible for
 dealing with other Latin American Communist parties.
 Camara was disliked by most of the leaders of the other Latin
 American Communist parties with whom he was in contact.
 The relation between the PCB and other Latin American Com-
 munist parties was improved as a result of informal talks held
 in Communist China.  Other Latin American. Communist parties
 are in accord with the present policies of the PCB, especially
 the policy of stressing the struggle against imperialism.  In
 the course of the informal talks the following was decided-

 Cuba, other Latin American countries, led by their Communist

 parties, will give complete support to the government of
 Fidel Castro.
 b.   An armed revolution in Argentina in the near
 future is inevitable.  The Peronistas are making preparations
 for this revolution, and they have the support of some of the
 military.     This revolution will be cruel and bloody.  Although
 the Communist Party of Argentina (PCA) has not yet decided
 on a definite position, it will probably align itself with the
 Peronistas, because the main concern of the PCA is to depose
 Arturo Frondizi, president of Argentina, and this can only be
 accomplished with the aid of the Peronistas.  Frondizi is
 completely controlled by the United States, as can be seen from
 his efforts to bring Argentina under the domination of the Inter-
 national Monetary Fund and the Export-Import Bank.  Unfortu-
 nately, the Peronistas will gain control of the government after
 the overthrow of Frondizi.  The PCA hopes to be able to obtain
 favor by supporting the future government in its quest for power.
 Other Latin American Communist parties will be greatly
 affected by the outcome of the struggle in Argentina, and they
 must begin to formulate a unified position.  (Since the time of
 this account, the head of the PCA, Victorio Codovilla, has
 made it clear, in an article in the February 1960 issue of
 Problems of Peace and Socialism, that the Party plans to act
 jointly with the Peronistas to counter an alleged attempt by
 "reactionaries" to establish a "naked dictatorship -- with or
 without Frondizi. "  Codovilla states that the Communists will
 take advantage of "democratic and nationalist forces" in the
 ranks of the armed services to prevent a military coup, and to
 push for the establishment of a "broad democratic coalition
 government" that will be more radical than previous regimes.)

 c.   A Latin American congress must be held to
 discuss the formation of a Latin American labor organization
 to replace the Confederacao dos Trabalhadores da America
 Latina (Confederation of Latin American Workers, CTAL).
 During a recent international trade union meeting in Chile,
 work was started on this.  (The Second National Congress of
 the Single Center of Chilean Workers (CUTCh) was held in
 Santiago from 4 to 8 December 1959, and was attended by trade
 union delegations from Argentina, Bolivia, Cuba, Czechoslovakia,
 Communist China, France, Uruguay, Venezuela, and the USSR.
 Many of these delegations included members who were also
 officials of the World Federation of Trade Unions.  During the
 course of the congress it was resolved to organize a new Latin
 American trade union federation which would be independent
 of both the ORIT and the CTAL.  At a meeting of the WFTU
 Executive Committee in Bucharest in December 1959 it was
 decided quietly to dissolve the CTAL.  A WFTU official has
 stated that the WFTU would attempt to promote the establish-
 ment of a new regional organization which would encompass
 worker groups of all political sentiments. )

 composed from notes taken on one of the lectures given in
 October 1959 in Shanghai or Peiping for the Brazilian delegation.
 (It should be noted that other Latin American CP delegations may
 have attended these lectures also.  This lecture seems note-

 a.   Help and Hindrance.  The aid that the Com-
 munist parties of the world have given the people of China in
 their struggle is greatly appreciated.    The Latin American
 Communist parties have been especially sympathetic toward
 the Chinese people, because the people of Latin America are
 also oppressed.      China continues to be oppressed in the sense
 that the western world continues to oppose recognition of
 China, and that China continues to be economically under-
 developed.  The Communist Party of China realizes that it is
 necessary to aid the masses, both during the revolution and in
 the construction of socialism.
 b.   Comparison with Brazil.   The Brazilian
 bourgeoisie is more powerful than the Chinese bourgeoisie.
 The people of Brazil have a higher living standard than that
 enjoyed by the people of China before the revolution.  Brazil
 will develop even further through socialism. Brazil now has
 problems which only socialism can solve.  For this reason,
 the leaders of the Communist Party of Brazil and of the
 Brazilian working class must strive to\reach the next step
 toward socialism.
 c.   Past Errors.   In the past, one of our mis-
 takes in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle was the
 speed with which we attempted to conquer the large cities,
 where opposition was the strongest.  We should have con-
 centrated our strength in the rural areas, where the reactionary
 forces were weakest.  From there, we should have moved on to
 the large cities.  We have since corrected this mistake, how-
 ever, and the situation has improved.                          In the beginning we were
 guilty of leftist errors in our agrarian reform movement.  We

 confiscated the land of the large landholders without returning
 any land for them to work.  In China the class struggle is very
 violent.  It cannot be said that we should only confiscate land-
 holdings of more than 500 hectares.  It is necessary to
 confiscate all land, and to redistribute this land on a basis
 whereby the wealthy farmers are given the same amount of
 land to work as other farmers.  China has a large population
 and a scarcity of land.  In China, 200 --Trillion ..of the 500
 'million  farmers have only one mou (one-sixth of an acre).
 Before the revolution, sixty percent of the land in China was
 in the hands of large landholders.  Although the poor and
 middle-class farmers made up ninety percent of the rural
 population, eighty percent of the land was in the hands of
 large landholders or rich farmers.  The agrarian revolution
 in China was, therefore, very violent.  Brazil, on the other
 hand, does not have a scarcity of land. In China there is no
 longer any problem regarding large landholders and rich
 farmers.  There is, however, a problem regarding a certain
 group of middle-class farmers who favor capitalism over
 socialism.  Rather than confiscate the land of this group, we
 must persuade it to change its way of thinking.  The Communist
 Party of China is attempting to accomplish this through the
 education of this group. We are supported by ninety percent
 of the farmers, and the other ten percent are not in a position
 to offer opposition.  The class struggle is still going on in
 China, and will not end for another. twenty to fifty years..
 Although the capitalist regime has ended, the bourgeois
 ideology remains.  Industrialization has increased greatly in
 China, and agriculture has become more mechanized.  The
 number of people's communes is increasing.  The desire to do
 things on an individual basis is decreasing.  Collective life and

 production-are becoming a custom.  Bourgeois ideology is spread
 by means of the intellectual bourgeoisie and capitalists, and, in
 rural areas, by the rich farmers and the obstinate group of
 middle-class farmers.     A long struggle will be required to
 liquidate this ideology.
 d.   The Future.   We are planning to overtake
 Great Britain in the most important aspects of industrial and
 agricultural production.  Even after doing this, however, we
 will not have solved the most important problems, because
 China has 650 million people, as compared with 50 million
 people in Great Britain.  We originally planned to surpass
 Great Britain in per capita production within fifty years, and
 ten years have already passed.  We hope that you will help us
 to carry out our plan, and that the world situation will remain
 peaceful.  We are familiar with the class struggle.  Today,
 however, we are struggling against nature, and we are not as
 familiar with this struggle.  The socialist revolution requires
 technical knowledge.  We are being aided, however, by the
 Soviet Union and other advanced socialist countries. We can
 learn from these countries, but we cannot copy everything
 because conditions in China are different from what they are
 in other socialist countries. In the past, the CCP has been
 guilty of committing dogmatic errors and of following an
 erratic line, but this has now been corrected.

 from notes taken on one of the lectures given in October 1959
 in Shanghai or Peiping for the Brazilian delegation.  This
 lecture was reported as given by Mao Tse-tung.
 a.   Preparation for the Construction of Socialism.
 The way for the construction of socialism has been opened up
 in our country in the past ten years, but the construction itself
 has just begun.  It is not an easy task to reach the point where
 the construction of socialism can be started.  Some years ago
 we experienced the old democratic revolution, which was with-
 out the direction of the working class.  This period of the
 Chinese revolution started in 1840 (Opium War).  In 1911 a
 victory was achieved against the Manchu government;  and the
 Nanking government, a bourgeois type of republic directed by
 Sun Yat-sen, was established.  The Communist Party did not
 exist at that time, being established ten years later. The
 establishment of the Communist Party changed the complexion
 of the revolution.  In the beginning, the Communist Party was
 made up of a small group of revolutionary intellectuals.  The
 first party congress was attended by only twelve delegates.
 The revolution of 1911 was a failure, and the bourgeois govern-
 ment lasted only three months.  Political power fell into the
 hands of the large landholders. Earlier, it had fallen into the
 hands of military leaders.  Neither the landowners, the
 militarists, nor the bourgeoisie granted any liberties.
 b.   The Struggle against Chiang Kai-shek.  The
 Communist Party was formed. in such an environment.        From
 1927 to 1949, Chiang Kai-shek maintained a military dictatorship
 in China.  It was a cruel dictatorship, such as is still found in
 some Asian and Latin American countries.  We co-operated

 -with Sun Yat-sen, and, after his death, with Chiang Kai-shek.
 The bourgeoisie came to power with the aid of the Communist
 Party, and, in return, the Communist Party was made illegal.
 The leaders of the Communist Party were not ideologically
 prepared, and did.not realize that friends could turn into
 oppressive enemies.  We had no choice other than to fight.
 The guerrilla wars lasted from 1927 until 1937.  When the
 Japanese invaded China, Chiang decided to co-operate with the
 Communist Party.  However, at the same time that Chiang
 was co-operating with the Communist Party in fighting the
 Japanese, he was carrying out anti-Communist activities.  The
 Communist Party was caught between Chiang and the Japanese.
 We were co-operating with Chiang and fighting him at the same
 time.  This continued from 1937 until 1945.  It was during this
 time that the necessary conditions for our assumption of
 political power were achieved.  At the end of the Second World
 War we were in a position to confront Chiang when he attacked
 us.  We were preparing ourselves ideologically.  Twice we had
 co-operated with the bourgeoisie.  The first time, we were not
 prepared, and, as a result, the party was made illegal.  The
 second time, however, we were prepared for the counter-
 attack.  The period between the summer of 1945 and the summer
 of 1946 was one of negotiations, without any violent struggles.
 We were prepared ideologically when Chiang began his general
 offensive in 1946, and we were able to run him off the continent
 and set up a popular government.
 c.   The Bourgeoisie.  Each country has its
 different conditions.  In each, however, it is necessary to
 distinguish between the two groups of bourgeoisie, namely
 the national bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie linked with

 imperialism.  In our three and one-half year struggle, our
 targets were the imperialists and the bourgeoisie headed by
 Chiang.     We never fought against the national bourgeoisie.
 Even now, the national bourgeoisie is co-operating with us and
 is represented in the government.  In China there are eight
 political parties representing the interests of the national
 bourgeoisie, none of which had liberty under the Kuomintang.
 One can see that the bourgeoisie cannot achieve victory in the
 nationalist and democratic revolution against imperialism and
 feudalism without the aid of the Communist Party and the
 working class.  Imperialism and feudalism were destroyed in
 China between 1840 and 1949.
 d.   The Dictatorship of the Proletariat.  The
 bourgeoisie participated in the revolution of 1911 and in the war
 against Japan, but was not able to establish a democratic
 republic with a broad anti-imperialist program.  Only with the
 aid of the Communist Party could feudalism and imperialism be
 destroyed.     This revolution did not infringe upon the lands of
 the national bourgeoisie or the individual farmers.  The
 bourgeois democratic revolution in China lasted 109 years, and
 opened the way for the socialist revolution.  For the past ten
 years we have been carrying on a socialist revolution.  The
 mere destruction of imperialism and feudalism does not open
 the way for a socialist revolution.  Hegemony of the working
 class and a dictatorship of the proletariat are prerequisites for
 opening the way for a socialist revolution. In referring to a
 dictatorship of the proletariat, I am referring to a dictatorship
 of the farmers and workers.  A dictatorship of the proletariat
 cannot be achieved without the aid of the farmers.  The farmers
 played an important part in both our revolution and the October

 Revolution in the Soviet Union.  Lenin pointed out the need for
 a worker-farmer alliance.   In a country such as China, where
 80 percent of the population is rural, a regime cannot be con-
 solidated without the aid of the farmers.
 e.   Economic Construction.   We have achieved
 considerable success in the past ten years.  It is generally
 said that the revolution and the construction of socialism can
 be carried out at the same time.  During our first eight years,
 however, emphasis was placed on the revolution, clearing the
 way for the construction of socialism. In the last two years we
 have concentrated on economic construction, and this economic
 construction will be our principal consideration for the next ten
 to twenty years.  Obstacles in the interior of the country have
 been eliminated.  Besides the support of the Soviet Union and
 other socialist countries, we have the support of all of the
 Communists in the world.  We also have the support of many
 people who, although not Communists, are anti-imperialist and
 in favor of peace and democracy.
 f. The Russian Revolution.   Our revolution, and
 others throughout the world, are a continuation of the October
 Revolution.  Both the Communist parties which have gained
 power and those which have not are part of the revolutionary
 forces.     Their objectives are the same.  We are following the
 struggles of the Communist parties in Argentina, Brazil,
 Venezuela, and other Latin American countries with considerable
 interest.

 today is quite different from what it used to be. There are

 Communist parties in almost all of the countries of the world.
 Of the eighty-three Communist parties in the world, seventy-
 one sent delegates to China for the commemoration of the tenth
 anniversary of the revolution.  Three others did not send
 dele-gates because the invitations were received too late.  Nine
 Communist parties which were invited to send delegates did not
 do so.  San Marino, with a population of 26, 000, has its Com-
 munist party.  Great changes have taken place in recent years,
 and even greater changes will take place in the next ten to
 fifteen years. It is possible that, even in China, further
 changes will take place.  Fourteen years have passed since the
 end of the Second World War, and we have made every possible
 effort to maintain peace during which time we can obtain more
 successes in our economic construction.  All of the Communist
 parties in the world are striving for peace.  With another
 fifteen years of peace, the socialist world, headed by the Soviet
 Union, will be far more advanced than the capitalist countries.
 There are more than one billion inhabitants in the socialist
 countries, only slightly less than half of the world's population.
 The rest of the population of the world is not united.  The
 majority of Latin Americans, Asians, and Africans are
 struggling against imperialism.  The imperialist countries
 (United States, Canada, France, West Germany, England, New
 Zealand, and part of South Africa) have only 400 million
 inhabitants in all.  Moreover, the population in these countries
 is divided into classes.  They have bourgeois and Communist
 political parties.   There are differences among the members
 of the bourgeoisie.  The bourgeoisie of England, France, and
 the United States are not the same.  We have every reason to
 be optimistic.  Our prospects are bright.  The future is for the
 Communists and not the bourgeoisie, a fact which has been
 evident since the October Revolution.

 h.   The CP of China.  Before the October Revolu-
 tion there were only isolated groups of Communists, but
 immediately before the revolution, these groups merged into a
 -great party.  The history of the Communist Party of China,
 which is thirty,-eight years old, is similar. In 1921 a small
 group of Communists elected twelve delegates to the first
 party congress.  We suffered setbacks, and we committed
 errors.  We committed our first rightist error in 1927.  The
 Kuomintang forced us into clandestinity.  We suffered our
 second setback in 1934, and we were forced to make the long
 march.   We lost our bases in the south and went to the north.
 We were guilty of leftist errors.  These errors are very
 important in the education of the party.  After 1934, during the
 period of Japanese resistance, we developed a correct political
 line in accordance with the conditions in China.  We began to
 make a distinction between the two groups of bourgeoisie,  a
 distinction which-we had been a long time in understanding.  We
 began to understand the farmers, and the distinction between the
 classes existing among this group.  We had the large landholders
 and the farmers.  The large landholders fell into three groups,
 according to the amount of land they owned.  The farmers also
 fell into three groups, these being the poor, the middle class,
 and the rich, which had capitalist tendencies.  We did not fight
 against the rich farmer at the same time that we fought the
 large landholders.  Moreover, when we fought against the large
 landholders, we left those with smaller holdings for the last.
 i. Imperialists and Landowners.  A distinction
 must be made among the imperialists.  It was a long time
 before we recognized the distinction between the masses and
 the imperialist leaders.  We must distinguish between the

 imperialists with whom we have immediate and direct conflicts
 and those with whom we do not. With regard to capitalist
 -countries, there are periods when we can fight them, and there
 are periods when we can live at peace with them.  In Brazil at
 the present time,, the farmers' principal conflict is not with the
 large landholders but with the imperialists.  There are many
 large landholders who are opposed to imperialism, and these
 large landholders should not be fought at the present time.
 V.   THE DELEGATION'S VISIT TO THE USSR AND
 SATELLITES.
 12.  Visit to the USSR.   After leaving Communist
 China, the Brazilian delegation visited the Soviet Union, arriv-
 ing there in time for the commemoration of the thirty-second
 anniversary of the Russian Revolution.  The delegation made a
 tour of Soviet factories and visited an atomic energy plant in
 the Moscow area.  Soon after its arrival the delegation met
 briefly with Nikita Khrushchev.  The Brazilian delegation also
 met with a commission made up of two members of the Secre-
 tariat and three members of the Presidium of the CPSU.
 .(According to Izvestiya of 18 November 1959, the Brazilian
 delegation was received on 17 November in Moscow by M. A.
 Suslov, Presidium and Secretariat member;  O. V. Kuusinen,
 Presidium and Secretariat member;  P. N. Pospelov, candidate
 of the Presidium and member of the Secretariat;  and B. N.
 Ponomarev, Central Committee member.)     The members of
 this commission explained that Khrushchev had gone to the
 Crimea to rest up before attending a congress of the Communist
 Party of Hungary.  Prestes was told that, if he wished to dis-
 cuss any matters personally with Khrushchev, he would be

 flown to the Crimea.  Although the leaders of the CPSU agree
 with the present policies of the PCB, they believe--that the PCB
 should attempt to gain greater mass support and participate
 more actively in mass meetings.  The PCB should actively
 participate in mass movements even when it is unable to play
 the leading role in these movements.  The PCB should not
 strive to achieve hegemony of the proletariat immediately
 where this is an impossibility. Naturally, in joining mass
 movements, the Party should seek to gain control of these
 movements but should not insist upon leadership as a pre-
 requisite for participation.  Before leaving the Soviet Union,
 Prestes gave a speech at the Higher Party School in Moscow.
 (The Higher Party School in Moscow is the CPSU establish-
 ment used for most of the training given to foreign Communists
 in the USSR.)
 13.  Visit to Poland.   After leaving the Soviet Union,
 where it had remained for twenty days, the Brazilian delega-
 tion visited Poland, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany.  The
 delegation spent about four days in each of these countries.
 In Poland the delegation was received by Wladislaw Gomulka,
 who outlined some of the problems that the Communist Party
 of Poland has had to face.  The main problem has been that of
 farm collectivization.  The piety and individuality of the Polish
 farmers make them radically hostile to a Communist state and
 to collectivization.  Many of the Polish people have refused to
 accept Soviet leadership in the Communist movement because
 of traditional hostility toward the Soviet Union.  Gomulka said
 that a serious economic problem has been created in Poland by
 a rapid decline in coal exports.  Western Europe, under pres-
 sure from the United States, has turned to the use of oil instead

 of coal for many of its fuel needs.  This has resulted in a coal
 surplus, and many mines have been forced to shut down,
 creating unemployment or the placement of miners in other
 work for which they have no skill.   Collectivization is progres-
 sing in Poland, although on a much slower scale than originally
 envisioned.  There is no solution for the coal problem other
 than developing other exports, and Poland has been quite
 successful in this.
 14. Visit to Czechoslovakia.   In Czechoslovakia the
 Brazilian delegation was received by one Novotny (undoubtedly
 Antonin Novotny, president and first secretary of the Czech
 Party).   While in Prague, the delegation met with the Soviet
 editor-in-chief of Problems of Peace and Socialism, an inter-
 national Communist publication.  This man complained that the
 PCB had not submitted articles for publication in this magazine,
 and suggested that it might be interested in contributing some
 articles for the current debate going on in the magazine on the
 bourgeoisie.  He said that a debate on contemporary colonialism
 would soon be started, and he invited the PCB to start off this
 debate by submitting an article on the colonial position of
 Brazil.  This man said that the staff of Problems of Peace and
 Socialism was satisfied with the Brazilian representative on the
 magazine, who was not a part of the editorial staff.  (A usually
 reliable source recently reported that Fued Saad, a Brazilian
 medical doctor and a member of the PCB, was in Prague as the
 head of the Brazilian section of Problems of Peace and
 Socialism, as of late November 1959.)  Prestes spoke before a
 group of CzechoslovakiaaCommunists in Prague.

 15.  Visit to East Germany.   In- East- Germany the
 Brazilian delegation met with many Communist leaders.  As
 in other countries visited, Prestes made several speeches and
 the delegation visited many factories and schools.  The East
 Germans have a tremendous propaganda machine, and one of
 the major activities of the Party is the preparation of propaganda
 to be sent into West Germany.  Refugees are now coming into
 East Germany from West Germany, instead of leaving East
 Germany as they had been doing in the past.   (Refugees are
 still leaving East Germany for West Germany although in
 smaller numbers than before.)  The PCB was invited to send a
 journalist to East Germany to co-ordinate propaganda and
 write articles about Latin America. The East German govern-
 ment offered to pay the salary and expenses of this journalist.
 The PCB was requested to send films to East Germany, showing
 strikes and.describing the economic plight of the masses in
 Brazil.  During his stay in East Germany Prestes visited the
 concentration camp where his wife died during the Second
 World War.  Prestes also laid a wreath on the tomb of Harry
 Berger, an international Communist leader who, at one time,
 served in Brazil.  The East German party is now trying to
 reclaim Berger, who was condemned by the party as a
 deviationist. Articles have recently appeared in newspapers
 in East Germany, pointing out that many of Berger's deviations
 later became party policy.

 and Central Committee of the CPSU in Moscow in November
 1959.  These remarks were made by CPSU leaders M. A. Suslov
 and O. V. Kuusinen.
 16.  Need for Closer Party Ties with Workers and
 Farmers.
 Suslov.  Soon after the Twenty-First Congress of
 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), a delegation
 representing your Central Committee (CC), headed by Carlos
 Marighella, visited our country and met with our CC.  At the
 request of this delegation, we expressed opinions on some of
 the documents of the PCB.  Our opinions were essentially as
 follows:  Some of the documents, especially the Political
 Declaration of March 1958, did not devote sufficient attention
 to the demands of the workers and farmers.  The Party cannot
 win the support of the masses in the anti-imperialist and anti-
 feudal struggle without devoting attention to these demands.
 We were afraid that the PCB would lose its link with the masses.
 We stressed the necessity for maintaining closer connections
 with the working class, because without the overwhelming
 support of the working class and the farmers, the Party cannot
 carry out its revolutionary tasks.  In order to gain this over-
 whelming support, the Party must devote sufficient attention to
 the defense of the material interests of the workers and
 farmers.  Other classes, such as the national bourgeoisie, the
 petty bourgeoisie, and the intellectuals, naturally play an
 important part in the revolution, and it is necessary to strive
 for an alliance with these classes in the anti-imperialist and
 anti-feudal struggle.  The broader this alliance is, the easier
 it is for the Party to carry out its tasks.  Even the large

 landowners and monopolists can take a certain role in the anti-
 imperialist struggle, but only in a given stage of the revolution.
 These groups cannot, however, be mixed with the working class
 or the national bourgeoisie.
 17.  Anti-Imperialist vs. Anti-Feudal Struggle.
 We familiarized ourselves with your documents
 on the international situation, the balance of discussion, and
 the labor resolution.  We were well impressed with these docu-
 ments because they indicated that your Party was seriously
 preparing for its national congress.  In general, your Party
 is well oriented.  If we were Brazilians, we would sign these
 documents and vote for them.  We do, however, have some
 suggestions as to how these documents could be improved
 upon.  You were correct in stressing the anti-imperialist
 struggle.  You must be careful in this regard, however, not
 to forget the anti-feudal struggle.  These two aspects of the
 revolution are intimately connected.    By stressing the anti-
 feudal aspects of the revolution you can win the support of the
 farmers in your anti-imperialist struggle.  It is possible that
 it will be necessary to take certain. action in the course of the
 anti-feudal struggle which will bring about the loss of support
 from certain of the large landowners.  This will result in less
 harm, however, than accepting the backward situation of the
 farmers and losing their valuable support.  You mentioned the
 necessity for stimulating the class struggle, and this should be
 done.  If the working class remains silent, without stating its
 demands, it receives no consideration whatsoever.  From this
 point of view, we were pleased with the documents on the labor
 movement and the balance of discussion.  It seems to us that

 same joint demands of the farmers and workers should be out-
 lined in order to aid them in their struggle.  When the workers
 and farmers overcome their enemies, they will have more
 consideration for our forces.
 18.  Revisionism the Current Danger.
 We would like to make a comment in regard to the
 principal danger of the Party at the present time.  Since you
 are naturally in a better position to judge this than we are, we
 do not expect you to accept our opinions without qualification.
 We have the following impression:   The principal danger to a
 Party changes from time to time.    At one time it might be
 revisionism, and another time it might be dogmatism and
 sectarianism.  In 1957 the principal danger to your Party was
 dogmatism.    Two years later leftist deviation became a serious
 problem, although dogmatism and sectarianism, which are
 never completely eliminated, still remained a problem.  A
 question comes to mind:  Has not the situation changed now?
 Are not revisionism, reformism, opportunism, and related
 problems the principal danger to your Party at the present
 time?  Your Party has been penetrated by a strong bourgeois
 ideology, stronger than that found in many Communist parties
 in capitalist countries. North American imperialists are
 making an effort to subordinate the working class to their
 influence and, through revisionism, opportunism, and
 reformism, to destroy the party of the workers.  We just want
 to plant a seed of doubt in your minds so that you will carefully
 examine your position.

 19.  Recognition of Vacillation of Bourgeoisie.
 Kuusinen.  I have something to add in connection
 with what Suslov has said.  Sectarians are not able to take
 advantage of the points of conflict existing among our enemies.
 As a rule, the sectarians are not understood by the masses.
 They are dogmatists who cannot adapt themselves to the
 peculiarities of their area. We want you to study the situation
 in Brazil.  We have always advised Party members to take into
 consideration the peculiarities of their area.  An important
 thing to remember is that Brazil is not a colony, but an inde-
 pendent nation reduced by imperialism to the conditions of a
 monocultured country.  The Brazilians are aware of the fact
 that the differences between their country and North American
 imperialism are increasing.  These differences, however, are
 complex.  It is important to take advantage of the differences
 existing among the bourgeoisie. It is wrong, however, to
 exaggerate these differences. This group will join with you
 when it is in its interest, but cannot be counted on for contin-
 uous aid, because it has its connections with the reactionary
 forces.  The bourgeoisie wants to be assured of the support of
 the masses, and, in Brazil, is attempting to assure this, to a
 great extent, through the Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro (PTB).
 The PTB is attempting to make the masses subservient to the
 bourgeoisie.  In struggling against imperialism, the national
 bourgeoisie is gaining the support of the masses.  This does
 not contribute to the advance of nationalist tasks. in the anti-
 imperialist struggle.  The PCB must always take into con-
 sideration the vacillation of the bourgeoisie.  I do not understand
 why the Declaration of March did not call for the confiscation of
 North American businesses and capital, and the annulment of all

 treaties and agreements which are prejudicial-to -the best
 interests of Brazil.  Nor do I understand why any clashes
 between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie should be con-
 sidered harmful at this state of the revolution.  Strikes are
 considered clashes with the bourgeoisie, and the PCB is
 certainly not opposed to strikes.  Certain clashes with the
 bourgeoisie are inevitable.  The desire to form a united front
 of democratic forces and to form a democratic coalition
 government is justified.  Suslov was correct in saying that
 the revolution cannot be successful without the aid of the
 masses, and this aid can only be achieved through supporting
 the daily and immediate demands of the masses.
 20.  Hegemony of the Working Class.
 Suslov,   The most important issue is that of
 hegemony.      I want to alert you to the sectarian approach to
 this issue.    The revisionists avoid the issue of the hegemony
 of the working class.    The sectarians consider the question
 of the hegemony of the working class to be one to be con-
 sidered in the beginning stages of the revolution.  This question
 of hegemony is one which must be considered in all stages of
 the revolution.  This hegemony of the working class is the
 result of the tremendous struggle of the Communist party.
 This hegemony is created in the course of the struggle.  The
 task of the Party is to work daily to gain the support of the
 masses, gaining hegemony of the working class day by day.
 You must strengthen your connections with the working classes
 and the labor unions.  You must aid the farmers and help to
 strengthen their organizations.  You must penetrate different
 organizations.  The Cubans are correct in saying that they

 must strive for the hegemony of the working class.  Even Fidel
 Castro cannot remain immune to this idea.
 21.  Support of Lott a Tactical Maneuver.
 We consider your support of the presidential
 candidacy of Marshal Henrique Teixeira Lott to be a matter of
 tactics' rather than principle.  It is. important in this class
 struggle for the Party to retain its identity, exerting its
 influence among the masses and clarifying its position before
 the masses.    If Lott is elected, even though he is a reactionary,
 the Party will gain through his election.  If Lott, on the other
 hand, were a democrat, and the Party supported him without
 clarifying its position before the masses, It would gain nothing.
 At a given moment, the Party might make a gain, but, in the
 end, the masses would not be able to distinguish between the
 PCB and the bourgeois and petty bourgeois parties.
 22.  Need to be Prepared for Armed Struggle.
 We believe that it is possible that the Brazilian
 revolution can be carried out peacefully, but you must be
 prepared for the other possibility.
 23. Need for Discipline.
 Your system of internal democracy and collective
 leadership is good.  You must not neglect discipline, however.
 Once passed, a resolution cannot be applied without discipline.
 It is important to elevate the prestige of the CC.  The struggle
 against the personality cult tends to reduce the prestige of Party

 leaders elevated through internal democracy and collective

 Party.
