HAS COME TO PREVAIL IN THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED 
STATES AND THE RUSSIANS. THE WORD "DETENTE" HAS GAINED 
ACCEPTANCE, AND IS INCREASINGLY IDENTIFIED WITH GENERAL 
SECRETARY BREZHNEV., WHEN WE SPEAK OF THE SOVIETS' POLICY 
OF DETENTE, HOWEVER, A CAREFUL DEFINITION IS IN ORDER. 
JETENTE DOES NOT MEAN A CHANGE OF HEART. OR 
DOES IT MEAN THAT MOSCOW HAS ABANDONED ITS BASIC OB-
JECTIVES. JETENTE DOES MEAN THAT THE SOVIETS HAVE 
MADE A REASSESSMENT' OF THEIR SITUATION, SORTED OUT 
THEIR PRIORITIES MORE CAREFULLY, AND ADJUSTED THEIR 
BEHAVIOR ACCORDINGLY. 
1 
THIS REASSESSMENT HAS HIGHLIGHTED TWO BASIC  
FACTS FOR THEM. ONE IS THE FACT THAT THE SOVIETS 
HAVE NOT BEEN CLOSING THE TECHNOLOGICAL GAP, THEY 
HAVE NOW ACKNOWLEDGED TO THEMSELVES THAT, IF THEY 
ARE TO BEGIN CLOSING IT, THEY NEED TO IMPORT AND AB-
SORB LARGE AMOUNTS OF WESTERN TECHNOLOGY. THE SECOND  
BASIC FACT IS HOSTILITY BETWEEN CHINA AND THE USSR. 
MOSCOW SEES PEKING AS REBUFFING ALL SOVIET OVERTURES 
FOR AN IMPROVEMENT OF SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS, AND THE 
BORDER NEGOTIATIONS REMAIN AT SQUARE ONE. 
BOTH THE ECONOMIC FACTOR AND THE CHINESE FACTOR 
ARE THUS FAIRLY LONG-TERM ONES, AND BOTH WORK IN THE

a&a. DIRECTION ON SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY. OBVIOUSLY, 
NORMAL AND AMICABLE RELATIONS WITH THE WEST ARE NECES-
SARY IF THE SOVIETS ARE TO PROMOTE THEIR ECONOMIC OB-
JECTIVES. MAJOR CONFRONTATIONS WITH THE WEST WOULD - 
UNDERMINE THE CHANCES FOR TECHNOLOGICAL GAIN. 
TENSE RELATIONS WITH THE WEST WOULD ALSO EXPOSE 
THE USSR TO THE RISK OF PRESSURE ON TWO FRONTS: WEST-
ERN AND EASTERN, SO LONG AS CHINA REMAINS ACTIVELY 
HOSTILE, THE SOVIETS HAVE A STRONG INTEREST IN KEEP-
ING RELATIONS WITH THE WEST ON AN EVEN KEEL. IN PAR-
TICULAR, THEY WANT TO GIVE AS LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT AS 
POSSIBLE TO COOPERATION BETWEEN CHINA AND THE US--
WHICH APPEARS TO THE RUSSIANS AS COLLUSION AGAINST 
THE SOVIET UNION. THERE ARE POSITIVE POLITICAL IN-
CENTIVES AS WELL, DETENTE PROVIDES A USEFUL CLIMATE 
FOR THE EXTENSION OF SOVIET INFLUENCE IN WESTERN 
EUROPE. IT ALSO SUPPORTS MOSCOW'S CLAIM OF ITS RIGHT 
TO BE INVOLVED IN ALL INTERNATIONAL QUESTIONS, SUCH - 
AS THE MIDDLE EAST. 
THESE CURRENT PRIORITIES HAVE SOME IMPACT ON RE-
LATIONS WITH THE US, MOSCOW IS NO LONGER SO AUTOMATIC 
IN OPPOSING US POLICY IN EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE. 
THIS HAS HELPED, FOR EXAMPLE, TO BRING ABOUT NEGOTIA-

TIONS IN THE HIDDLE EAST. IT HAS NOT, OF COURSE, 
SOLVED MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THE AREA, NOR DO THE SOVIETS 
INTEND TO DO THAT. 
BREZHNEV'S PERSONAL PRESTIGE IS COMMITED TO 
DETENTE. LAST YEAR HE MADE HIS BIGGEST GAINS WITH - 
HIS TRIPS TO BONN AND WASHINGTON. ALL BREZHNEV'S 
POLITBURO COLLEAGUES NOW ACKNOWLEDGE HIS PREEMINENT 
POSITION, BUT HE IS AWARE HE CANNOT GET TOO FAR AHEAD 
OF THEM, AND MUST SHOW SOME FRUITS OF DETENTE. COPING 
WITH DISSIDENTS LIKE SOLZHENITSYN POSES A CONTINUING 
DILEMMA OF HOW TO SQUARE THE NEEDS OF DOMESTIC DISCIPLINE 
WITH FOREIGN POLICY CONSIDERATIONS, ON THE ECONOMIC 
FRONT, RECORD GRAIN PRODUCTION LED TO A COMEBACK FROM 
A DISMAL 1972 SHOWING, BUT IIOSCOW'S GOAL OF OVERTAKING 
THE US REMAINS AS DISTANT AS EVER. THE USSR STILL 
PRODUCES ONLY ABOUT HALF AS MUCH GOODS AND SERVICES AS' 
THE US WITH A LABOR FORCE 50 PERCENT LARGER. 
LOGICALLY, DETENTE SHOULD ALSO LEAD TO A FURTHER 
EASING OF THE ARMS RACE. BUT THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED 
YET. THE SOVIET STRATEGIC PROGRAMS REPRESENT A 
POWERFUL COMPETITIVE THRUST IN THE AREAS NOT COVERED 
BY SALT AGREEMENTS, MAINLY IN THE AREA OF QUALITATIVE  
IMPROVEMENT, THUS FAR, 10SCOW SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT

IT CAN PROCEED ON A VIGOROUS PROGRAM OF WEAPONS MOD-
ERNIZATION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY GETTING THE POLITICAL 
AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF DETENTE. 
SO, IN HIGHLIGHTING OUR STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE SOVIET UNION, I WILL ADDRESS THREE QUESTIONS: 
--WHAT ARE THE SOVIETS DEVELOPING NOW? 
--WHAT NEW SYSTEMS WILL THEY DEPLOY? 
--WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL IT MAKE TO THE US-
SOVIET BALANCE DURING THE COMING YEARS? 
ONE OF OUR VERY RECENT JUDGMENTS IS THAT THE 
PACE AND SCOPE OF CURRENT SOVIET STRATEGIC DEVELOP-
MENT PROGRAMS IS UNPRECEDENTED, PARTICULARLY IN THE 
FIELD OF IcBn DEVELOPMENT. THE RUSSIANS ARE ENGAGED 
IN A BROAD RANGE OF PROGRAMS TO AUGMENT, MODERNIZE, 
AND IMPROVE THEIR FORCES FOR INTERCONTINENTAL ATTACK. 
LET ME PLACE THESE CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN CONTEXT: 
FIRST, THE LARGE SCALE MISSILE DEPLOYMENT PROGRAMS 
OF THE SIXTIES LED THE SOVIETS TO A POSITION OF 
OVER-ALL STRATEGIC PARITY WITH THE UNITED STATES. IN 
FACT, IT PLACED THE SOVIET UNION AHEAD OF THE US IN 
NUMBERS OF ICEI LAUNCHERS, AND LEFT THE SOVIETS IN 
THE PROCESS OF TAKING THE LEAD IN SUBMARINE-LAUNCHED 
BALLISTIC MISSILES. 
As OF THE FIRST OF THIS MONTH, THE SOVIETS HAD

A FORCE OF APPROXIMATELY 1,500 OPERATIONAL ICBH 
LAUNCHERS, IN ADDITION, ABOUT 100 MORE LAUNCHERS 
WERE UNDERGOING CONSTRUCTION OR MODERNIZATION. THE 
NUMBER OF US ICBH LAUNCHERS REMAINS AT 1,054. 
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS; THE SOVIETS HAVE BEEN 
MAKING GREAT EFFORTS IN THE NAVAL AREA. THEY NOW 
HAVE SOME 580 SUBMARINE-LAUNCHED BALLISTIC MISSILES, 
CARRIED ABOARD A FLEET OF 44 NUCLEAR POWERED SUE 
MARINES. APPROXIMATELY 200 ADDITIONAL LAUNCHERS 
ARE ON SUBMARINES NOW IN VARIOUS STAGES OF CONSTRUC-
TION. THE US POSSESSES 656 LAUNCHERS ON 41 NUCLEAR 
POWERED SUBMARINES, 
THE SOVIET INTERCONTINENTAL BOMBER FORCE) ON THE 
OTHER HAND) PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE EFFORT TO ATTAIN 
STRATEGIC EQUALITY WITH THE UNITED STATES. AND THE 
US RETAINS A GREAT LEAD IN STRATEGIC NUCLEAR WARHEADS 
AND BOMBS BY A RATIO OF ABOUT SEVEN TO TWO. 
How, IN THEIR CURRENT DEVELOPMENT ROUND, THE 
SOVIETS HAVE FOUR NEW LAND-BASED Ems IN THE FLIGHT 
TEST STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT. THREE HAVE BEEN FLIGHT 
TESTED WITH MULTIPLE INDEPENDENTLY TARGETABLE RE-
ENTRY VEHICLES--MRVS--AND THE FOURTH MAY ALSO HAVE 
A HIRV CAPABILITY. IF TESTING PROCEEDS SMOOTHLY; 
ALL FOUR SYSTEMS COULD BE READY TO BEGIN DEPLOYMENT 
IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. HARDER LAUNCH SILOS, WHICH

WILL IMPROVE ICBM FORCE SURVIVABILITY, ARE ALSO PART 
OF THIS MODERNIZATION PROGRAM. 
As FOR SUBMARINE-LAUNCHED BALLISTIC MISSILES, 
LARGER AND IMPROVED SUBMARINES, SUCH AS THE D-CLASS, 
ARE COMING OFF THE WAYS. THE D-CLASS, WHOSE DEPLOY-
MENT BEGAN IN 1973, CARRIES A MISSILE WITH AN OPERA-
TIONAL RANGE OF 4,200 NAUTICAL MILES--OVER THREE 
TIMES GREATER THAN THE ONE CARRIED IN THE Y-CLASS, 
THE SOVIET VERSION OF OUR POLARIS. THIS NEW MISSILE 
COULD REACH MUCH OF THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES 
EVEN IF FIRED FROM OR NEAR HOME PORTS IN THE SOVIET 
UNION. 
IN SHORT, SOVIET PROGRAMS OF THE SIXTIES CONCEN-
TRATED ON QUANTITY. THEIR NEW ROUND OF STRATEGIC 
SYSTEMS IS FOCUSING MAINLY ON QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENT. 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE NEW ROUND OF 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WAS CONCEIVED LONG BEFORE THE 
MAY 1972 SALT INTERIM AGREEMENT LIMITING CERTAIN 
STRATEGIC ARMS. MOST OF THE NEW PROGRAMS INVOLVED 
WERE EVIDENT OR FORSEEABLE AT THAT TIME. THOSE 
THAT WE NOW SEE DO NOT VIOLATE THE SALT ONE AGREE-
MENT. 
WHY, SOME MAY ASK, HAVE THE SOVIETS ENGAGED IN

SUCH AN ENERGETIC EFFORT, PARTICULARLY AFTER THEY HAD 
ALREADY ATTAINED A CONDITION OF RECOGNIZED STRATEGIC 
PARITY WITH THE US? 
WE JUDGE THAT MUCH OF THE ACTIVITY REFLECTS 
INTERNAL BUREAUCRATIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL MOMENTUM--
? PLUS A CONSCIOUS SOVIET LEADERSHIP DECISION TO TRY 
TO KEEP UP WITH THE COMPETITION. IN THE AREA OF 
MIRVs, FOR EXAMPLE, THE SOVIETS HAVE LONG INDICATED 
A FEELING THAT THEY MUST CATCH UP IF THEY ARE TO BE 
ACCEPTED AS FULL STRATEGIC EQUALS OF THE US. THE 
SOVIETS' EMPHASIS ON MIRVs AND OTHER ASPECTS OF WEAP-
ONS TECHNOLOGY PROBABLY ALSO REFLECTS A NEED TO PLAN 
FOR VARIOUS CONTINGENCIES--INVOLVING CHINA AND OTHER 
PERIPHERAL TARGETS, AS WELL AS THE US. 
BUT, THE CURRENT ROUND OF DEVELOPMENT ALSO IN-
VOLVES AN ELEMENT OF OPPORTUNISM--TO PRESS AHEAD, TO 
SEE WHAT THE TRAFFIC WILL BEAR, TO TRY TO IMPROVE 
THEIR POSITION RELATIVE TO THE US. TO GO BACK TO THE 
OIRV EXAMPLE, THEY SURELY RECOGNIZE THAT EXTENSIVE 
MIRVING OF THEIR ICBMs WOULD EVENTUALLY THREATEN TO 
LEAVE THE US BEHIND IN DELIVERY VEHICLES. 
NOW TO THE SECOND MAIN QUESTION: WILL THE SO-
VIETS DEPLOY WHAT THEY ARE DEVELOPING? THE ANSWER 
-8-

COULD WELL DEPEND ON THE OUTCOME OF THE SALT II NEGO-
TIATIONS. AT THE WASHINGTON SUMMIT LAST JUNE, YOU 
RECALL, PRESIDENT NIXON AND BREZHNEV AGREED TO SEEK_ 
A PERMANENT AGREEMENT LIMITING STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE 
SYSTEMS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. 
FACTORS THAT MAY INDUCE THE SOVIETS TO CONCLUDE 
A FOLLOW-ON AGREEMENT ARE: 
--A BELIEF THAT A NEW ROUND IN SOVIET DEPLOY-
MENTS ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD PROVOKE OFF-
SETTING US REACTIONS WHICH WOULD DENY THEM 
ANY STRATEGIC GAIN, AND PERHAPS EVEN WORSEN 
THEIR POSITION, AND 
--CONFIDENCE THAT THE SOVIET RESTRAINT WOULD 
BE RECIPROCATED ON TERMS THAT WOULD GIVE 
THE USSR BOTH THE IMAGE AND THE SUBSTANCE  
OF EQUALITY. 
OF COURSE, WE CANNOT PREDICT IN DETAIL THE 
SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS OF A SALT II AGREEMENT. SOME 
FORCE IMPROVEMENTS, HOWEVER, ARE LIKELY TO BE PER-
MITTED UNDER ANY PERMANENT AGREEMENT. IT SEEMS 
REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT THE SOVIETS WILL REPLACE 
MANY OF THE EXISTING STRATEGIC FORCES WITH THEIR 
NEWER, MORE ADVANCED SYSTEMS.

Approved For Release 2002/MeRploRDP8OR01731R002000090002-3 
IF A NEW SALT AGREEMENT IS NOT ACHIEVED, THE 
SCOPE OF THE FORCE IMPROVEMENT IS LIKELY TO BE 
GREATER. BUT AS I MENTIONED JUST A MOMENT AGO, A 
MAJOR SOVIET PUSH WOULD DEPEND UPON THE SOVIET LEADER-
SHIP'S ASSESSMENT OF HOW FAR THEY COULD PRESS AHEAD 
WITHOUT PROVOKING US COUNTERACTION. 
IN ANY CASE, THE OFFENSIVE CAPABILITY OF SOVIET 
MISSILE FORCES IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO INCREASE BY SUB-
STANTIAL AMOUNTS DURING THE COMING YEARS. 
THIS TAKES US TO THE THIRD QUESTION: WHAT DIF-
FERENCE WILL IMPROVED SOVIET CAPABILITIES MAKE TO 
THE WASHINGTON-MOSCOW STRATEGIC BALANCE? 
THIS IS A QUESTION OF TECHNOLOGY, OF STRATEGY, 
AND ALSO OF POLITICS AND PSYCHOLOGY, BECAUSE, IN THE 
FINAL ANALYSIS, HOW WE AND THEY PERCEIVE THE BALANCE 
IS MOST CRUCIAL TO DETERRENCE AND THE EXERCISE OF 
POWER THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. 
THE MAJOR US STRATEGIC CONCERN OVER SOVIET FORCE 
IMPROVEMENT IS HOW IT AFFECTS THE SURVIVABILITY OF 
OUR OWN STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE FORCES. THE SOVIETS NO 
DOUBT BELIEVE THAT BY DEPLOYING MORE--AND INCREASINGLY 
ACCURATE?MISSILES, THEY CAN IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY 
TO ATTACK US MISSILE SILOS.

GIVEN THE SIZE AND DIVERSITY OF THE STRATEGIC 
FORCES DEPLOYED BY BOTH SIDES, HOWEVER, WE JUDGE IT 
VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR EITHER SIDE TO ACQUIRE A 
DISARMING FIRST STRIKE CAPABILITY AGAINST THE OTHER 
IN THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE, AT PRESENT, FOR INSTANCE, 
THE SOVIETS CAN POSE ONLY A NEGLIBLE THREAT TO OUR 
POLARIS AND POSEIDON SUBMARINES. THE SOVIET NAVY 
LACKS A DETECTION SYSTEM FOR LOCATING ENEMY SUBMARINES 
IN THE OPEN OCEAN, AND ITS OWN ARE UNABLE TO TRAIL THE 
QUIETER US MISSILE SUBMARINES. SOVIET EFFORTS TO IM-
PROVE THIS SITUATION ARE, AT BEST, STILL IN THE R&D 
STAGE. 
NEVERTHELESS, THE NEW ROUND OF SOVIET DEVELOP-
MENT POSES UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE MILITARY AND PO-
LITICAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THEIR PROGRAMS. OUR EFFORT 
IN SALT II IS DIRECTED AT REDUCING THESEANCERTAINTIES 
Now, JUST A FEW WORDS ON CHINESE STRATEGIC PRO-
GRAMS BEFORE TURNING TO SOME OF THE POLITICAL DYNAMISM 
ERNING RELATIONS AMONG WASHINGTON,' MOSCOW, AND 
PEKING. CHINA IS MOVING UP, BUT WITH DELIBERATION.

WITH A 7,000 NAUTICAL MILE RANGE, HAS BEEN TESTED 
ONLY FOUR TIMES, MOST RECENTLY IN AN ATTEMPT TO ORBIT 
A SATELLITE. ONLY THE FIRST LAUNCH WAS SUCCESSFUL. 
FINALLY, IN 1972 MONTHLY PRODUCTION OF THE TU-16 MEDIUM 
BOMBER WAS CUT BACK FROM TWO TO ONE, AND APPARENTLY SUS-
PENDED ALTOGETHER IN THE LATTER HALF OF LAST YEAR, 
AFTER ONLY ABOUT 60 HAD BEEN DEPLOYED WITH OPERATIONAL 
UNITS. 
THUS, PEKING'S DETERRENT FORCE FOR THE MOST 
PART WILL REMAIN MARGINAL. As FAR AS THE US IS CON-
CERNED, CHINA'S. NUCLEAR THREAT THROUGH MID-1978 WILL 
CONTINUE TO DEPEND ALMOST ENTIRELY ON A CAPABILITY TO 
STRIKE ONLY THOSE US BASES AND OUR ALLIES LOCATED IN 
EAST ASIA. 
IN RESPECT TO THE RUSSIANS, PEKING THROUGH 
MID-1978 WILL REMAIN DEPENDENT ON A MINIMUM NUCLEAR 
DETERRENT, AND ON A DETERMINATION TO DEFEND THE COUN-

POSSIBILITY OF A CHANGE IN CHINESE ATTITUDE, JUST AS

PAINTED AS A "SELL OUT" TO THE REVISIONISTS. BUT

THEIR LEADERS' INTERESTS IN AVOIDING NUCLEAR WAR, I

MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN A HYPOTHETICAL WARSAW PACT-NATO

THAT ANY WAR INVOLVING NATO AND THE WARSAW PACT WOULD 
ESCALATE DIRECTLY TO THEATER-WIDE NUCLEAR WAR HAS 
BEEN ALTERED TO ALLOW FOR AN INDETERMINATE PERIOD 
OF CONVENTIONAL CONFLICT. SOVIET MILITARY WRITERS 
HAVE PAID INCREASED ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF 
HAVING ARMED FORCES EQUIPPED AND TRAINED FOR CONVEN-
TIONAL OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS TACTICAL NUCLEAR WARFARE, 
IN EITHER A NUCLEAR OR A CONVENTIONAL ENVIRONMENT, 
THE SOVIETS WOULD PROBABLY ATTEMPT TO CONDUCT RAPID 
OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS, IN ITS FORWARD AREAS, THE WAR-
SAW PACT MAINTAINS FORCES--SOME 33 DIVISIONS--IMMEDIATELY 
READY FOR COMBAT, BUT EACH IS MUCH SMALLER THAN A US 
DIVISION. THESE FORCES ARE DESIGNED TO BLUNT A NATO 
ATTACK AND THEN TO SEIZE THE INITIATIVE. IN ADDITION, 
THE PACT HAS ALMOST 30 MORE DIVISIONS IN EASTERN EUROPE, 
OPPOSITE THE NATO CENTRAL REGION, THESE ARE UNDERSTRENGTH 
DIVISIONS, HOWEVER, THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE FLESHED OUT BY 
MOBILIZATION. AT BEST THEIR COMBAT CAPABILITY WOULD BE 
SOMEWHAT SUSPECT, AND IF THEY WERE COMMITTED BEFORE

SHOCK POWER. THE DIVISIONS ARE HEAVILY ARMORED AND 
HAVE GOOD TACTICAL MOBILITY, ALTHOUGH LOGISTIC SUP-
PORT IS RELATIVELY AUSTERE. MAJOR GROUND FORCE UNITS 
HAVE A TACTICAL NUCLEAR CAPABILITY, MOST OF THE 
THEATER NUCLEAR FORCES BASED WITHIN THE WESTERN USSR 
ARE MEDIUM BOMBERS AND FIRST GENERATION MRBMs AND 
IRBMs, THE SIZE OF THIS MISSILE FORCE HAS BEEN 
DECLINING IN RECENT YEARS, BUT THE DECLINE HAS BEEN 
OFFSET BY THE ADDITION OF SOME SS-11 ICBMs WHICH WE 
BELIEVE ARE TARGETED ON THE EUROPEAN THEATER. 
As TO THE FUTURE COMPOSITION AND WEAPONRY OF THE 
FORCES, THE PACT IS INCREASING AND MODERNIZING TANK 
FORCES AND ITS INFANTRY COMBAT VEHICLES. DIVISIONAL 
ARTILLERY HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED IN RECENT YEARS, AND 
THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT SELF-PROPELLED ARTILLERY, NOW 
IN TROOP TESTING,WILL PROBABLY SOON BE INTRODUCED.

LIKELY TO BE DEPLOYED WITH SOVIET NAVAL AVIATION. 
TALK OF THE NATO-WARSAW PACT MILITARY BALANCE 
RAISES THE QUESTION OF THE POLITICAL HEALTH OF THE 
ATLANTIC ALLIANCE. WE READILY FIND THAT THE SAME 
TIDE OF EVENTS WHICH IS SWEEPING THE US AND CHINA 
ALONG CONGRUENT COURSES ALSO THREATENS TO WASH AWAY 
THE FAMILIAR LANDMARKS OF THE ALLIANCE. THE SOVIET 
CAMPAIGN TO MEND ITS RELATIONS WITH THE WEST--BOTH 
THE US AND EUROPE--PRESENTS PROBLEMS AS WELL AS OP-
PORTUNITIES FOR ITS EUROPEAN NEIGHBORS. 
PARADOXICALLY, THE MORE THE US AND THE SOVIET 
UNION GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF WORKING HAND IN HAND, 
THE LESS THE EUROPEANS ADMIT THE VALIDITY OF THE 
PRIORITY WASHINGTON ATTACHES TO ITS RELATIONS WITH 
MOSCOW, AND THE MORE THEY DECRY THE POSSIBILITY OF 
A "CONDOMINIUM" THAT THEY FEAR MAY SLIGHT EUROPEAN 
INTERESTS. 
IF THE EUROPEANS RETAIN THE POTENTIAL FOR A 
"SPOILER" ROLE AMONG THE GREAT POWERS, IT IS NOT BE-
CAUSE THEY CAN OUTBID THE US FOR CLOSER TIES WITH 
THE SOVIET UNION. RATHER, ONE DANGER IS THAT EUROPE 
MIGHT DIVERGE ENOUGH FROM A COMMON WESTERN LINE THAT 
THE RUSSIANS MIGHT FEEL IT POSSIBLE TO MEDDLE AND 
EXTEND THEIR INFLUENCE IN WESTERN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS.

ANOTHER DANGER IS THAT EUROPE'S CAPACITY FOR INDE-

EUROPE'S CURRENT SEARCH FOR OIL AND INFLUENCE 
IN THE ARAB WORLD ILLUSTRATES THE POINT. THE PO-

TO OFFSET--IN HOWEVER VAGUE A WAY--EXCESSIVE COZINESS 
BETWEEN THE SUPERPOWERS, 
WE SHOULD NOW ASK HOW THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS A UNITED

AND VULNERABLE--POINTS UP THE NEW DIMENSION THAT IS

TECHNOLOGY, MEDIUM-TERM AND LONG-TERM CREDITS EX-
TENDED BY THE UNITED STATES AFTER THE 1972 SUMMIT 
RESULTED IN A LARGE INCREASE IN SOVIET IMPORTS OF US 
EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY. THE RELAXATION OF SOME US 
EXPORT CONTROLS SINCE DETENTE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RISE 
IN IMPORTS, ALTHOUGH CONTROLS CONTINUE TO LIMIT ACCESS 
TO VERY SPECIALIZED AND SOPHISTICATED FOREIGN TECH-
NO LOGY. 
THE SOVIET UNION FAR OUTSTRIPS CHINA IN ITS AB-
SORBTION OF WESTERN TECHNOLOGY) BUT PEKING ALSO HAS 
GREATLY STEPPED UP ITS PURCHASES OF MACHINERY AND 
TECHNOLOGY. IN 1973, CHINA SIGNED CONTRACTS WITH 
US, JAPANESE AND WEST EUROPEAN FIRMS FOR A RECORD 
$1.2 BILLION WORTH OF COMPLETE INDUSTRIAL PLANTS TO 
BE DELIVERED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. MOREOVER, 
IN A SHARP DEPARTURE FROM A LONG-STANDING POLICY OF 
AVOIDING FOREIGN DEBT, DEFERRED PAYMENTS ARE BEING 
USED TO FINANCE TWO-THIRDS OF THE COSTS. 
DESPITE SUCH SHIFTS TO HASTEN MODERNIZATION AND 
TO ASSURE LONG-TERM SELF-SUFFICIENCY, THE REST OF 
THE WORLD WILL NOT BE STANDING STILL. IN SOME 
FIELDS--FOR EXAMPLE, THE MORE ADVANCED ASPECTS OF 
MISSILERY AND AEROSPACE, ELECTRONICS, AND LASER TECH-
NOLOGY--THE TECHNOLOGICAL GAP IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT

As BOTH MOSCOW AND PEKING TRY VAINLY TO CATCH 
UP WITH THE WEST, THE COMPETITION OF CIVIL AND MILI-
TARY SECTORS IS PROBABLY NO LESS ACUTE THAN HERE IN 
THE US. IN FACT, RUSSIAN CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN FARING 
BETTER IN RECENT YEARS. DESPITE AN AVERAGE 5 PERCENT 
GROWTH IN SOVIET DEFENSE AND SPACE SPENDING SINCE 
1960, THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN GROWING EVEN FASTER. THE 
MILITARY SHARE OF THE SOVIET GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT 
HAS DECLINED TO 6 PERCENT, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS 
GRADUAL DECLINE WILL CONTINUE. EVEN SO, DEFENSE 
NEEDS WILL STILL COMMAND RUSSIA'S BEST MATERIALS AND 
HIGHEST QUALITY MANPOWER. 
IN CONCLUDING MY SURVEY OF GREAT POWER RELATIONS, 
I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON ANOTHER AREA IN WHICH MOS-
COW, PARTICULARLY, MUST BALANCE SKILLFULLY DOMESTIC 
AND INTERNATIONAL NEEDS, I SPEAK OF THE CONFLICT 
BETWEEN DETENTE AND DOMESTIC DISCIPLINE--WHICH GOES 
TO THE HEART OF THE SOVIET SYSTEM, 
IN THE EARLY STAGES OF NEGOTIATION, WHEN THE WHOLE 
THING WAS NEW AND TENUOUS, THE SOVIETS TIGHTENED UP 
WITH A TOUGH LINE ON INTELLECTUAL DISSENT, AND ISSUED 
SHRILL WARNINGS ABOUT THE DANGER OF WESTERN IDEAS. 
MORE RECENTLY, THEY SEEM TO BE CONSIDERING THE POS-
SIBILITY THAT THEIR SOCIETY IS NOW STABLE ENOUGH TO

SURVIVE SOME VERY LIMITED RELAXATION OF CONTROLS. 
THE SOVIET LEADERS ARE STILL NOT SURE ABOUT IT, HOW-
EVER, AND ARE UNCERTAIN AS TO HOW MUCH CHANGE THEY 
CAN AFFORD. THE EXPULSION OF SOLZHENITSYN TWO WEEKS 
AGO SHOWS THEY ARE NOT READY TO GO VERY FAR. GA 
LAST SEPTEMBER, THE SOVIET UNION STOPPED JAM-
MING THE VOICE OF AMERICA, THE BBC AND THE WEST GER-
MAN RADIO, DEUTSCHE WELLE. THE RUSSIANS CONTINUE TO 
JAM RADIO LIBERTY, WHICH HAS A MORE AGGRESSIVE EDI-
TORIAL POLICY ABOUT SOVIET INTERNAL AFFAIRS THAN THE 
OFFICIAL RADIOS DO, AND THIS MONTH THEY RESUMED 
SELECTIVE JAMMING OF DEUTSCHE WELLE BECAUSE IT WAS 
BROADCASTING EXCERPTS FROM SOLZHENITSYN'S NEW BOOK, 
THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO, BUT MORE NEWS IS STILL GET-
TING INTO THE SOVIET UNION THAN DID BEFORE DETENTE 
BECAME AN ESTABLISHED POLICY. 
THE SOVIET PRESS HAS ALSO BEGUN TO CARRY SLIGHTLY 
MORE ACCURATE PICTURES OF THE WEST. FOR EXAMPLE, 
PRAVDA IN JANUARY RAN A SERIES ON THE US CONGRESS 
THAT WAS NOT TOO BAD IN TERMS OF POLITICAL ANALYSIS', 
IT WAS CERTAINLY AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE OLD STEREO-
TYPE OF "CAPITALIST-BANKERS" CONTROLLING EVERYTHING 
BEHIND THE SCENES. 
IN AN EVEN MORE CAREFUL AND UNEASY FASHION, THE 
POLITBURO HAS BACKED INTO ALLOWING SOME SELECTIVE 
EMIGRATION. SINCE 1970, ABOUT 72,000 JEWS HAVE BEEN

PERMITTED TO EMIGRATE. THE SOVIET LEADERS HAVE PER-
MITTED THIS GRUDGINGLY AND UNGRACEFULLY, AND THEY 
HAVE HELD BACK ON SPECIAL CASES, BUT THE FLOW HAS 
CONTINUED EVEN THOUGH IT ANNOYS THE ARABS AND COM-
PLICATES SOVIET POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. 
BREZHNEV AND HIS POLITBURO COLLEAGUES ARE WELL 
AWARE THAT THEIR CONTROL DEPENDS STILL MORE ON MAIN-
TAINING POPULAR SATISFACTION THROUGH IMPROVING LIVING 
STANDARDS. THE EXAMPLE OF POLISH WORKERS PROTESTING 
INCREASES IN FOOD PRICES IN DECEMBER 1970 GAVE THEM 
A FRIGHT. THE FIVE-YEAR PLAN ADOPTED SOON AFTERWARDS 
GAVE INCREASED ATTENTION TO CONSUMER GOODS AND SER-
VICES. THE HARVEST FAILURE IN 1972 FORCED CUTBACKS 
IN THE CONSUMER SECTOR, BUT THE KREMLIN IS DOGGEDLY 
STICKING TO THE PLAN'S ORIGINAL GOALS AND IS TRYING 
TO GET BACK ON THE TRACK. THE CONSUMER SECTOR HAS 
BEEN STARVED FOR SO LONG THAT MUCH OF THE POPULACE 
APPRECIATES EVEN MODEST IMPROVEMENTS, 
OVER THE LONG TERM) DETENTE IS CLEARLY GOING 
TO BRING CONSIDERABLE CHANGES TO THE SOVIET UNION--
WITH POSSIBLE DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCES FOR GREAT POWER 
RELATIONSHIPS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE AS YET 
JUST WHAT THESE CONSEQUENCES MAY BE, BUT THE SOVIET 
LEADERS ARE CLEARLY GAMBLING THAT THEY CAN DIRECT
