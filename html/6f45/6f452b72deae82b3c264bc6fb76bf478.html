 Technology Transfer Policy for China
 Our export policy toward China must reflect a balance between two
 competing objectives.     On the one hand we desire to develop a
 strong and enduring relationship with China, which in time seeks
 to align them more closely with the West.   U.S. export policy is
 a key tool to further this objective.  On the other hand there is
 a legitimate concern that the intended relationship may not mature
 favorable for the U.S.   As a result it is prudent to insure our
 exports do not contribute in a major way to that portion of China's
 military capability that if used against us, would pose a major
 national security risk to ourselves or our allies.   The formulation
 of U.S.  export policy to China must therefore contend with the
 strain caused by these competing concerns, provide the best
 balance at any one time,  and be prepared to adjust as the relation-
 ship changes.
 Significant difficulties have surfaced with the state of current
 China export policy and its execuation within the U.S. government.
 (See Tab A for expanded discussion).   Recent Chinese American dialogue
 makes  it imperative we review this policy and move forward from a
 uniform U.S.G. position.   In support of this review our interagency
 group on China has studied the issues and endorses the adoption of
 five implementation improvement options shown at Tab B.   We further
 offer for discussion two distinct policy options for future
 management control of policy and suggest a set of four possible
 statements to express the level of technology transfer to be permitted.

 I.     Management Control Policy
 Controls on dual-use exports to China,  now administered under
 the Export Administration Act, allow implementation by-either
 National Security or Foreign Policy provisions.   By their very
 nature,  these are distinct alternatives.   Absent other level
 setting direction, they provide measurably different foreign
 policy perception,  and technology transfer results.   Either
 control can be implemented with China in group P or V.
 National Security Controls
 National  Security Controls as defined by U.S. EAA law,  and as
 applied to specific countries,  requires a Presidential determina-
 tion that that country is a national security destination.   This
 carries with  it the perception that the named country is a poten-
 tially significant military threat to the U.S.  and/or its allies.
 Within the Export Administration Act and under this determination,
 DoD has a special role in implementing the ensuing controls.
 Should DoD judge that the export of a particular item of
 equipment or technology would be harmful to national security,
 it may recommend to DOC that the export be denied.   Should this
 recommendation be challenged,  as it often is,  the decision is
 escalated to the cabinet level where the Secretary of Defense
 has a statutory veto.   By law,  the Secretary of Defense
 can only be overridden by the President.   If the President decides

 or
 to override Defense, he must notify Congress of his action.
 This has never occurred,       in effect giving DoD a de facto veto
 over licenses to national security destinations.   Present U.S.
 technology transfer policy for China is implemented under National
 Security Controls.   The Department of Commerce is the executive
 administrator of the process.
 Foreign Policy Controls
 The adoption of Foreign Policy controls to China exports will
 require a Presidential declaration to Congress that China is no
 longer a national security destination.   This carries the percep-
 tion that the PRC  is no longer viewed as a significant potential
 military threat to the U.S.  and its allies.   Under this control
 policy,  DoD,  DoC and DoS would remain fully involved in the
 licensing process.   However, at the Cabinet level the Secretary
 of Commerce would be the deciding voice.   DoD,  DoC and DoS,
 retain the right to appeal any case to the President for a final
 decision.   Unlike national security controls,  the President need
 not inform Congress that he has overruled any Cabinet department
 in the process.   Foreign policy controls do,  however,  require a
 declaration and rejustification to Congress by December 31 of each
 year or expire.   This option treats China the same as other
 non-0OCOM controlled destinations.   However,  in the construct
 of this paper,  the requirement to submit export applica-tions for
 China to COCOM would remain for the foreseeable future.

 II.   Technology Transfer Levels
 With either control policy option,  it is imperative to,-provide
 guidance on the level of exports to China.   This guidance can take
 the form of a qualitative declaration or a quantitative statement
 that attempts to set the level of exports at some single numerical
 benchmark.   Both qualitative and quantitative choices are
 offered for consideration.
 Choice 1.   Maintain about the current level of control on exports
 applicable to the four special mission areas.   Relax controls
 to be equal to other friendly non-aligned countries for items
 that have little or no application in the four special mission
 areas.
 Choice 2.   Approve levels of technology currently available to
 friendly non-allied nations except for exports applicable to four
 special missions areas.   Define a short negative list of key
 equipment and technologies with associated levels that would
 significantly enhance China's capabilities in these mission areas
 and pose a credible threat to the U.S. or its allies.   Items on
 this list would be treated with a presumption of denial..   Define
 precisely a complete list of items and/or technologies and their
 associated levels in the special mission areas where controls may
 apply, depending on end use or other relevant factors-to be
 considered.   For all other items there will be a strong predisposi-
 tion toward approval.

 The intent of this option is a substantial liberalization of our
 export control policy toward China and,  in this regard, Defense
 and Commerce shall seek to substantially expand the delegation
 of--authority given Commerce so that more items may be routinely
 licensed without-referral to DoD.
 Choice 3.   Set this level at a fixed percent of the generally
 available world level.   Commerce has recommended 75%.
 Choice 4.   Allow transfer of technology at generally available
 free-world levels.   Those items already controlled to non-COCOM
 controlled countries would also be controlled to China  (i.e.,
 Nuclear weapons and their delivery systems).

 National Security Vice Foreign Policy Controls
 Given the basic definition of National Security Controls and
 Foreign Policy Controls and our history of their application,
 there is a clear and distinct attitudinal difference of
 opinion that the U.S. Government conveys to other world govern-
 ments and our own domestic institutions by the simple act of
 placing China under one or the other policy.   For most
 observers military security controls are synonymous with a
 U.S. perception that China is or may likely become a signi-
 ficant military threat to the U.S.  and/or its allies by a
 growth in capability and/or a change of intent.   This percep-
 tion is formed from the words that define National Security
 Controls;  the fact that only the President can overrule
 Defense and  its confined application to the USSR,  bloc
 countries,  other non-friendly communist countries,  and
 China.
 In contrast, Foreign Policy Controls convey a less distinct,
 and generally more friendly U.S. Government attitudinal
 view of the country in question,  although foreign policy
 controls are also used for non-friendly countries.   The
 absence of the declaration of China as a national: security
 destination with all  it implies, contributes to this other
 perception.

 What may be more important is the historical application of
 our
 olic
 p
 y.  We have and do apply Foreign Policy
 to friendly as well as non-friendly countries and tailor
 the controls as required.                                                                                   Some NATO allies,  as well as
 countries like India, Yugoslavia, and Libya, are included
 and treated with wide differentiation.   Some, like Libya
 and Iraq,  have very strict controls placed on them; many
 would say even harsher than those now imposed for China.
 Despite this mixed history, placing  a country under National
 Security Controls implies that the USG perceives that country
 as a potential threat.
 Clearly,  by changing from National Security Controls to
 Foreign Policy Controls the U.S. would send a major signal
 concerning our view of China. However,  the tone of the
 message can be significantly moderated by 1) maintaining
 COCOM controls, which is uniformly recommended in this
 paper, 2) tailoring the transfer control level through a
 clearly articulated policy statement that shows our intent
 and,  3)  retaining Defense participation in the review
 process,  albeit without quite as strong a voice.   Within
 this construct, movement of China from country group P to
 V might also be considered.
 A key issue is, what would be the effect of eliminating the
 situation whereby the President must notify Congress if he

 overrules Defense by moving to Foreign Policy Controls? We
 have recommended that,  if Foreign Policy Controls are
 adopted, Defense should continue to be given the right to
 review all cases,  and participate in all dialogue and
 cabinet level discussion. If DoD disagreed with the cabinet-
 level discussions,                            it would retain the right to appeal the
 case to the President.   The basic difference in this manage-
 ment construct from current practice is that Defense would
 be forced to clearly show cause why the transfer is a
 security risk instead of the other departments having to
 prove why it would not be.   Since Defense has the major
 expertise to know whether or not an item presents a national
 security risk,  it should carry the responsibility to make
 the case.   To depend as we do now,  on a process where
 Commerce or State has to disprove the negative and do so
 from a position of non-expertise,  is to provide in practice
 a simple Defense veto.   If a Defense veto is the desired
 tool of control,  it would be best to say this directly
 and avoid much interagency dialogue.   However,  if we
 adopt foreign policy controls and retain Defense's ability
 to review all cases and its appeal rights, we believe no
 grievous breaches of transfer will occur.   This change,  if
 adopted, would hopefully result in increased and possibly
 more consistent technology transfer policy for the PRC.

 Technology Transfer Level
 To have confidence that our future China technology transfer
 policy is implemented as intended,  it is imperative that a
 statement be issued that provides guidance as to the general
 level desired.   In the previous material, we have provided
 examples of both qualitative and quantitative statements
 that may serve this purpose.  The vast majority believe a
 rigid quantitative guidance statement is not the most
 appropriate.   All but Commerce recommend that quantitative
 choice 3 not be used,  and suggest guidance through choices
 1,  2,  or 4.   Commerce recommends choice 3.
 We believe that we can change our export policy towards
 China   in any of the ways described without substantial  impact
 on our broader COCOM objectives.   It would,  however,  have
 to be done with the full prior knowledge of our COCOM
 partners and others who have informally supported COCOM
 initiatives.   We would have to explain our reasons for any
 liberalization,  consult with them,  and emphasize that we
 would continue to honor our COCOM obligations.   We would
 emphasize that U.S.  internal liberalization of exports to
 China implied no relaxation of our efforts to tighten COCOM

 U.S. Demarche to China
 If-the decision is made to significantly liberalize our tech-
 nology transfer to China, many argue that this should initially
 be announced to the Chinese in some form of a demarche.   Some
 also argue that we should use this opportunity to get something
 from the Chinese in return, or at least let them know we have
 not taken these steps only because they have complained loudly
 and often.   That would make us look vulnerable to any pressure.
 In addition,  Demarche has the advantage of engaging both parties
 in a discussion to a common end.   We have not attempted to define
 the details of how this should be accomplished but simply raise
 it for consideration.

 Problem Discussion on Technology Transfer Policy for China
 Since formal normalization of relations in 1979, the US has
 gradually liberalized its export control policy toward China.
 In August 1979, Vice President Mondale told Vice Premier Deng
 that we were working in COCOM to establish a differential
 between those commodities which go to the USSR and to China.
 We then immediately started to approve exports of selected
 equipment and technologies not previously exportable to China.
 In March 1980, President Carter directed that China be moved
 from the same Country Group as the Soviet Union  (Group f)  to a
 unique category (Group P).   In September 1980,  the U.S.
 announced that it would no longer automatically deny a :license
 application simply because it was for a military end-use or was
 of unusually advanced technology.
 The Group P categorization was not defined until President
 Reagan's directive of June 4,  1981.   This set the technical
 level at which there would be a predisposition to approve cases
 for China at approximately twice that provided to the Soviet
 Union prior to the invasion of Afghanistan.   Also in June 1981
 COCOM members informally agreed to a more liberal China export
 policy vis-a-vis the Soviet Bloc.   Formal diferentiation has not
 been possible because the allies  (particularly France and Japan)
 -4-.1 A
 wish to treat all controlled destinations alike on paper=.   However,

 Approved For Release 2011/03/02 : CIA-RDP85M00364R000200240034-0
 the allies are also willing to informally agree to differ-
 entiate.   On May 6,  1982, Judge Clark, on behalf of the President,
 issued a memorandum reiterating and clarifying the Presidential
 Directive of June 4, 1981.  This set a predisposition for approval
 of-all cases, unless they posed a major risk in one of four
 special mission areas:   anti-submarine warfare, electronic warfare,
 intelligence gathering and nuclear weapons systems.
 Our export policy has attempted to balance two conflicting
 objectives.  On the one hand, we seek to develop a strong and
 enduring relationship with China.  We support Chinese military
 and strategic development,  insofar as they act as a counterweight
 to Soviet power in Asia.   We want China to be a stable and positive
 actor on the world scene,  promoting global and regional security.
 Over the long term we hope that China will become increasingly
 integrated into,  and aligned with, the West.   On the other hand,
 there is a legitimate concern that our exports not contribute to
 China's military capability in such a way as to pose a major
 national security risk to either ourselves or our Asian allies.
 China is independent of the USSR and.a counterweight to Soviet
 military power,  but it is communist.   It is vigorously pursuing
 a nuclear weapons program.   It can deliver a limited number of
 nuclear warheads on the U.S.   China reportedly has exported
 nuc-lear weapons technology to Pakistan and unsafeguarded nuclear
 materials to the Third World.   Chinese diversions and i=llegal

 acquisitions of U.S.  technlogy and their violation of U.S.
 controls are well documented.   Although China supports Asian
 initiatives concerning Kampuchea, most Southeast Asian-countries
 remain concerned about China as a potential enemy.   Taiwan also
 remains unconvinced by China's current peaceful posture.   Much
 of the advanced technology the Chinese do want is dual-use
 technology --  it has a benign civilian application but could
 also have military application if diverted.   In certain cases,
 identical technology is used by both civil and military end users.
 And,  in many cases, civil end users in China are subordinate to
 military research and development entities.
 Aiding in China's modernization through the export of technology
 is a key element in making China an effective counterweight to
 growing Soviet military power and strengthening strategic cooper-
 ation with China.   All of us recognize that the relationship is
 young,  and represents a radical change from the 1950's and 1960's,
 but  it is also clear that the relationship's future is uncertain.
 As a result, we must take care that our objective of protecting
 our military interests does not unnecessarily handicap our ability
 to foster a stable relationship with China.
 China is not now our adversary.   Nevertheless,  it is the only
 non-adversary nation possessing strategic nuclear capabilities
 that is not an ally.   This,  and the fact that our relationship
 is just over a decade old,  argue for prudent controls to guard
 against the danger that technology provided today might do us
 serious harm in the future should that relationship change.

 Our current policy attempts to reconcile our often conflicting
 goals by encouraging exports "at significantly higher technical
 levels than previously,  albeit somewhat below those approved for
 other friendly non-allied countries", while restricting "exports
 which would make a direct and demonstrable contribution to Chinese
 capabilities in the four special mission areas.   The current
 policy also has a "two-times" rule of thumb, meaning a "predis-
 position to approve at a technical level approximately twice
 that provided to the Soviet Union prior to the Afghanistan
 invasion."
 Thus, we have a dilemma.   In practical terms, we want to expand
 trade with China to help it modernize and to help the U.S.  cement
 a favorable long term relationship.   In symbolic terms, China is
 looking for legitimacy and recognition as a major power,  especially
 from the U.S.   But we also seek to minimize the long term risks
 to our national security by attempting to support China's military
 modernization in a way which improves their capability against
 the USSR,  but not against the U.S. or its allies.
 The problem is not of major proportions in dollar terms.   Out
 of $3.1 billion of 1982 export trade to China,  about $0.45
 billion required a license.   This $450 million represents about
 5/-6 of the dollar amount of license applications processed.

 That is, about 1/6, or $90 million, of the license applica-
 tions were denied or returned without approval.   (Those- returned
 without approval were returned usually for some administrative
 reason.)   Therefore,  less than 3% of all trade to China was denied
 a license.   However,  this can be a misleading statistic.   Some
 believe that U.S.   regulations and multilateral agreements  (i.e.
 COCOM), discourage license applications for technology which
 would otherwise be proposed for license.   Also,  because each
 commodity has its own individual threat potential, statistics
 are not the most effective way of determing the risk factor in
 total exports.
 The Commodity Control List  (CCL)  is the most comprehensive aggre
 gation of product listings which identifies products of U.S.
 strategic concern.   Of the 187 CCL entries which potentially
 pertain to China,  ten represent 80% of all license applications,
 six represent 75%.   Two CCLs represent 55% of all license appli-
 cations,  computers 40% and scientific instruments 15%.   These
 last two entries are most frequently the subjects of the hardest
 to decide cases since they have general utility in the four
 special mission areas.
 Problems With Current Policy
 A.-Chinese Perceptions
 The Chinese have expressed great disappointment with the

 availability of U.S. high technology products and processes.   It
 is logical to believe that they expected normalization to produce
 much greater liberalization of our export policy.  Deng Xiaoping
 has made clear that in exchange for strategic cooperation with
 the U.S.  he expected strong U.S.  support in the technology
 transfer area.  He has also made it clear that development of the
 overall U.S.-China relationship will be strongly affected by
 U.S.  technology transfer policy.
 Below Deng's level, the Chinese have said access to dual use
 technology  is critical to their industrial and military
 modernization.  They have pointed out the discord between our
 often stated policy of "supporting a secure,  friendly and
 modernizing China with which we share strategic interests",  and
 our actual export control policy, which applies an export
 control procedure used only with adversary nations.   They point
 out that this accords China treatment worse than the US applies
 to countries like India, which they cite as having much warmer
 relations and stronger technological ties to Moscow.
 We have contributed to raised Chinese expectations about liberali-
 zation of our export policy by repeatedly suggesting that exports
 of various types of advanced technology and equipment might be
 possible while at times attributing implementation problems to
 simple bureaucratic inertia.   The caveats  (legitimate security
 controls)  have often been lost in the positive statements

 which have left a strong impression over the past several years
 of our willingness to make available high technology.
 The Chinese also want a clear and decisive U.S. export--Policy,
 one which would help them to clearly understand how we want to
 treat them and also help the US business community know what the
 ground rules are.   This was demonstrated during Secretary Shultz's
 recent trip to China, when Fang Yi and others stated that it
 would be most helpful for the U.S.  to tell them explicitly what
 we do not want to make available to them, a very pragmatic approach.
 The Chinese also complain about being included in COCOM with
 the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries,  and about the
 pegging of the two-times rule to the USSR.
 The result as perceived by the Secretary of State,  and other
 senior U.S.G.  officials,  is that technology transfer ranks
 only behind Taiwan as an   irritant  in bilateral US-PRC  relations.
 B.   U.S.  Business Perceptions
 U.S.  business sees itself at a severe competitive disadvantage,
 in terms of sales opportunities to China vis-a-vis foreign
 suppliers. Our allies process license applications and submit
 them to COCOM much more rapidly than we,  reflecting a consider-
 ably more expeditious export policy toward China by our COCOM
 partners.  U.S.  business believes that the Chinese can often get
 competitive equipment from other suppliers if the U.S. -denies a
 license,   although other COCOM-country suppliers must have approval

 in.COCOM, where the U.S. can deny an item if it poses a security
 risk.   Some U.S. firms simply avoid the China market, claiming
 they fear refusals of an export license or do not wish 'to become
 involved in a complex and lengthy licensing process,  that can
 mean major administrative expenses that are not always realized
 in profits, and penalty fines for late delivery.   However, the
 only alternative to remove this cost of doing business in China
 would be to drop all national. security controls.
 The Chinese also pressure the USG through the business com-
 munity.   They sign contracts which contain performance :bonds,
 dependent on the U.S.  company obtaining an export license,  for
 technology exceeding current guidelines.   And,  even if there is
 no performance bond,  the Chinese often engage in contract discus-
 sions for state-of-the-art equipment because they want the best
 available,  sometimes simply it seems,  for reasons of prestige.
 But there  is also a fundamental desire to get the best product
 for the money.   Since many US companies view China as a long-term
 market, they strive to be competitive in China.  This manifests
 itself in pressure on the USG to approve higher and higher levels
 of technology.   License applications for exports to China in
 early 1983 have increased 150 % above the average rate for 1982.
 Thus, we may be facing a significantly larger licensing problem
 than we have in the past.
 Confusion with Current Policy

 There are two areas which cause confusion with current policy.
 One relates to the level of technology that we are willing to
 export; the other relates to the four special mission areas.
 Technology Level -- The broad statements in the current
 policy call for "the approval of technology to China at
 significantly higher technical levels than previously
 approved, albeit, somewhat below those approved for
 other friendly non-allied countries." But later in the
 technical guidelines it is also stated that,  "two-times ...is
 to be taken as an indicator of the technical level of
 products and know-how that imply the presumption of
 acceptable national security risk..." In many instances
 these become contradictory statements because precisely
 "two-times"  is often far below the free world level.
 There are other problems with the "two-times" rule or
 any other simple quantitative scheme to define acceptable
 technical levels for exports.   For items denied to the
 USSR,  there is nothing to take "two-times" of.   A level
 has independently been set in some cases.   For items like
 computers, many individual technical parameters synergistically
 determine the system's capability, making direct application

 of "two-times" criteria to individual parameters
 virtually impossible.   In other instances doubl-ing
 the value of a single performance parameter may-much
 more than double overall system performance.   For
 some items,  interagency agreement has thus been possible
 only at levels below the "two-times" criteria.   We
 have also often applied special conditions to approvals
 that are  not normally imposed on cases for most
 non-controlled destinations, such as periodic on-site
 inspections.
 The guidelines do envision denials to China and recommend
 that lower risk substitutes be considered where feasible.
 Defense has often recommended such substitutes.   The
 Defense Department has also granted Delegations of
 Authority to the Commerce Department for most items
 which do not require COCOM referral,  and in practice
 few licenses have actually been denied,  although many
 have been modified or delayed in the interagency review
 process.
 But these statistics can be misleading.   Many license
 applications are made expecting approval;  companies
 want to avoid formal denials because of their
 potential impact on future business with the Chinese.
 The low percentage of actual denials thus does -not

 accurately portray the levels of technology being approved
 vis-a-vis what the Chinese really want.  What.-the Chinese
 really want in some cases is far above the current level--
 providing the higher level would require dropping national
 security controls.
 The Four Special Mission Areas  -- the technical guide-
 lines state "that ur4:ess circumstances apply which entail
 major risks to national security (i.e., exports which
 would make direct and demonstrable contribution to Chinese
 capabilities in nuclear weapons and their delivery systems,
 electronic and anti-submarine warfare,  or intelligence
 gathering),  cases that meet the "two-times" rule of
 thumb s;iould be approved for sale to China.   There should
 also be a predisposition for approval of cases above the
 "two-times"  level unless the transfer poses a major
 national security risk  in the special mission area."
 These guidelines can be interpreted to mean that almost
 any item by definition poses a risk to national security.
 Extensive debate ensues about what is a "major risk" and
 what  is "direct and demonstrable"  in the special mission
 areas.   As written,  it is not at all clear why the "two-times"
 level is even mentioned here because the same criterion
 seems to apply both below and above it.   Final-ly,  the
 Department of Defense has a statutory veto authority at
 the Cabinet level on setting the "threshold." This can result
 in delays at the working and sub-Cabinet level in escalating

 problem cases for decision.   Taken together, many believe
 this combination of factors has resulted in inconsistent
 and often difficult policy application.
 The group unanimously agrees that the "two-times"
 rule has served a useful purpose to date,  but that now the
 rule per-se is no longer an effective benchmark.   It should
 be replaced by a specific China list developed by an inter-
 agency group guided by a Presidentially endorsed statement
 of control level  intent.

 Procedural Improvement Recommendations
 During the working group review, several recommendations surfaced
 which we believe could greatly enhance U.S.  execution of the China
 high technology transfer policy.   All of the following recommenda-
 tions have strong endorsements.                    Some may require additional
 resources.
 1)  Defense should immediately provide DoC a Delegation of Authority
 (DOA)  for cases whose existing technology levels are below current
 COCOM criterion for general exceptions to the international list
 of dual-use equipment.
 Rationale
 This DOA allows DoC to act expeditiously on cases historically
 approved.   This can be implemented almost immediately.
 2)  DoC in consultation with Dod and DoS should publish within
 3 months,  and update annually a China technology transfer commod-
 ities policy guideline that conveys for each CCL item the level
 of technology permissible for license approval to China  (a "green
 line")  and a level above which there will be a predisposition to
 deny the license  (a "red line").   This policy guide shall be

 Approved For Release 2011/03/02 : CIA-RDP85M00364R000200240034-0
 constructed with the intent of allowing technology transfer
 within the permissible "green line" level by DoA to Commerce.
 Above this level, case-by-case reviews including input- from
 DoD, DoS, and DoC will be the mechanism for license determination.
 The organizational administration of the review would remain the
 same as now.   ACEP (the Advisory Committee on Export Policy)
 would review U.S. cases before they go to COCOM.   EDAC (the
 Economic Defense Advisory Committee) would review foreign COCOM
 cases and coordinate the U.S.  response to foreign actions on
 U.S. COCOM cases.
 Rationale
 A published commodities list China policy guide will allow U.S.
 industries to better determine licensable commodities for sale
 to China,  allow clearer projection of policy to the PRC and
 within the U.S. Government and allow increased Delegation of
 Authority to DoC to expedite more cases.
 3)  ACEP and EDAC shall take action to ensure that all technical
 data on difficult cases is shared fully and equally before the
 case is presented to either the ACEP Operating Committee or EDAC
 Working Group #1.

 Rationale
 Inefficiencies in the current process due to an incomplete inter-
 departmental understanding of the technical merits of a case would
 be eased.  Technical differences would be either resolved or
 sharpened before cases escalate.   Interdepartment contact on a
 more substantive level will hopefully build better communication
 bridges to help in the final decision process.
 4) For those matters requiring case-by-case review, more discipline
 should be exercised  in meeting licensing deadlines.   Also,  cases
 should not be returned more than once to an exporter for redraft.
 A way to achieve this goal would be to have the technology transfer
 working group (or ACEP and EDAC, as appropriate to the case) meet
 more often with technical experts from the exporter,   instead of
 relying on written correspondence.
 Rationale
 Licensing officers desire to work out positive solutions to hard
 cases,  and this can take time.   Industry also wants positive re-
 sults,                     so they frequently encourage the licensing officer to take
 more time,  and return the application for adjustment and resubmis-
 sion,  rather than accept a denial.                     Some of this is hea1thy,  but
 it can get and has frequently gotten out of hand.   It should be noted
 that Congress was sensitive to this problem and specified in the
 1978 EAA a 180-day limit for discussion on U.S.  licenses, with few

 exceptions.   COCOM has also adopted a 90-day limit for the
 consideration of cases though exceptions are allowed f-qY
 particularly contentious exports.
 5) Negotiate a technology transfer memorandum of understanding
 (MOU) with the Chinese to provide assurances against retransfer
 of U.S.  exports and/or diversion from its originally declared
 use.   The MOU would apply between the levels of routine approval
 and predisposition of denial.   It would be a factor in the case-
 by-case review process.
 Rationale
 A technology transfer agreement is seen by many to provide suf-
 ficiently increased assurance against retransfer or diversion as
 to allow significantly increased levels of transfer.   We currently
 have such agreements with several other countries.
