 Discussions now under way in the Crimea between
 President Tito of Yugoslavia and leaders of the Soviet
 Union probably are an attempt to find at least a
 temporary solution to problems in Soviet-Yugoslav re-
 lations which have been developing this summer and
 which stem from fundamentally opposed concepts concerning
 the doctrine of "independent roads to socialism.','  Soviet
 leaders apparently feel that they must either modify
 their soft line toward the Satellites or risk loss of
 their hegemony in Eastern Europe.   Tito would be reluc-
 tant to accept any trend toward tighter controls.

 In the UN Security Council debate beginning 5 October,
 Britain and France hope to obtain substantial backing
 for a Suez settlement along the lines of the 18-nation
 plan for international control.         Six of the 11 council
 members, including Iran, support the Suez Canal Users'
 Association and can be expected to support the inter-'
 national control principle.  The position of the other
 three non-Communist members--China, Peru, and Cuba--
 remains in doubt.  The USSR will probably veto any
 Western resolution providing for international control:

 Despite indications that the USSR is attempting to
 slow the pace of liberalization in the Satellites,
 Poland shows no sign of altering its course of seeking
 increased internal freedoms and independence from the
 Kremlin.  This policy has been a factor in the conduct
 of the Poznan trials, which generally have been open
 and free, partly because of the influence of Western
 public opinion.

 Japanese prime minister Hatoyama plans to go to
 Moscow on 6 October in the hope of restoring diplomatic
 relations between Japan and the USSR without a formal
 peace treaty.  While the USSR has agreed to continue
 negotiations for a peace treaty including a territorial
 settlement after relations are renewed, this is un-
 likely to placate Hatoyama's opponents, and they may
 break away from the government party on the grounds
 that Japan's territorial claims have been sacrificed.

 Portugal is stalling on negotiations for renewal
 of the Azores bases agreement, which expires at the end
 of 1956.  Portuguese leaders excuse the delay by ex-
 pressing concern over a possible change in the American
 attitude on colonialism, particularly Goa, and by
 pointing to the shifting defense picture in Western
 Europe.
 THE TANGIER CONFERENCE .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page  5
 The Moroccan government has called a nine-power
 conference for 8 October to end the international
 regime in Tangier.  The eight foreign governments which
 have administered Tangier--France, Spain, Britain,
 Italy, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the
 United States--seek to retain an international organ-
 ization of some sort to protect their economic interests
 in the area.

 FOR AN EARTH SATELLITE .  . .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page  9
 Soviet representatives at two recent international
 scientific meetings tended to be noncommittal on the USSR U
 plans for an earth satellite.     This reticence, which
 contrasts with previous announcements, may mean that
 the Soviet Union has decided to avoid international
 commitments which would require it to reveal its
 techniques in the guided missile field, or merely that
 a detailed announcement is to be held off until a
 successful launching is more certain.  Estimates give
 the USSR the capability to launch a small earth
 satellite successfully by early 1957.

 The reactivation ofo,Soviet Communist Youth League
 (Komsomol) "light cavalry" squads in the Odessa Oblast
 of the Ukraine, announced on 23 September, highlights
 the serious problem of law enforcement in the USSR.
 One of the major functions of these units presumably
 will be to engage in surprise raids on places of
 amusement or public assembly to deal with acts of
 "hooliganism" and crime.

 In an effort to increase the supply of technical
 personnel, Peiping has almost doubled new enrollments
 in institutions of higher learning and prohibited
 industry and administrative organizations from re-
 cruiting middle school graduates capable of university
 work.   The program is a 180-degree turn from the 1955
 policy of encouraging students to discontinue their
 schooling and join the labor force.

 A new East German canal under construction since
 April will link the Elbe River and the Baltic Sea and

 Elbe-Trave canal running from the Elbe to the port of
 Luebeck in West Germany, and is further evidence that

 The composition of the Chinese Communist Party's
 governing bodies, as revealed at the party's eighth
 congress, confirms that Mao Tse-tung continues to dominate
 the party.  The proceedings at the congress also pro-
 vided nearly conclusive evidence that Liu Shao-chi and

 seek to extract the utmost in political benefit from
 controversies over reunification, rearmament and

 has waned somewhat,and his Christian Democratic Party is

 Recent indications point to intensified Soviet

 capability in this field is restricted by deficiencies
 in sanitation, public health and crop protection.      The
 Soviet Union is probably attempting to acquire a
 capability adequate for retaliation in kind against a

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 THE SOVIET-YUGOSLAV TALKS
 Discussions now under way
 in the Crimea between Presi-
 dent Tito of Yugoslavia and
 leaders of the Soviet union
 probably are an attempt` to
 find at least a temporary solu-
 tion to problems in Soviet-Yugo-
 slav relations, which stem from
 fundamentally opposed concepts
 concerning the doctrine of
 "independent roads to social-
 ism.'
 Background of the Dispute
 Although Tito's distrust
 of the USSR was not completely
 overcome during his visit to
 Moscow last June, his present
 suspicions are primarily the
 result of a series of events
 which occurred during the
 summer months.
 Despite their initial
 public concurrence with the
 Soviet line--a line which has
 since been reversed--Yugoslav
 officials apparently were dis-
 turbed at the harsh Soviet re-
 action to the Poznan riots in
 Poland.   The Yugoslavs have
 been equally concerned over
 the apparent change since June
 in Soviet propaganda concern-
 ing international Communist re-
 lations.  Tito's concept of
 genuinely "independent roads
 to socialism," ostensibly ac-
 cepted by the Soviet leaders
 in June, has, in essence, been
 contradicted by Moscow's sub-
 sequent emphasis on interna-
 tional Communist unity and by
 its outright criticism of
 "national Communism."
 The related Soviet change
 in attitude toward the Satel-
 lites in general,  however,ap-
 pears to have been the major
 area of friction.   The USSR
 this summer warned the Satel-
 lites that limits to the
 liberalization programs--pro-
 grams which apparently have
 been actively encouraged by
 Yugoslavia--had been trans-
 gressed.   Marshal Bulganin
 visited Poland in July and
 cautioned a Warsaw audience
 that "antiparty"  tendencies
 were afoot and must be halted.
 The Polish press, Bulganin
 claimed, exhibited such trends.
 In addition Bulganin stated--
 contrary to the official Polish
 view--that the Poznan riots were
 instigated by Western imperial-
 ist agents to exploit such un-
 healthy situations.
 As an apparent follow-up
 to this form of warning,  the
 central committee of the Soviet
 Communist Party on 3 September
 sent a letter to the Satellites,
 admonishing them that the USSR,
 not 'Yugoslavia, is the correct
 model to follow in building
 socialism.   According to this
 letter, the Yugoslav concept
 of the "independent roads to
 socialism" thesis is incorrect
 and is not to be accepted by
 the Satellites.
 Already upset by these
 developments, the Yugoslavs
 received an additional jolt
 in early September from what
 they considered to be un-
 warranted Soviet interference
 in their internal affairs.
 Yugoslavia this summer had
 placed on trial for treason a
 number of former Yugoslav party
 officials who had defected to
 the East after the Yugoslav-
 Cominform break in 1948.   Soviet
 and Satellite press coverage of
 these trials, considered in

 Belgrade to be unfriendly in
 tone and misleading in substance,
 was publicly attacked by the
 Yugoslavs as being "Cominform-
 ist -inspired," and as a direct
 attack on the Tito regime.
 The Soviet Dilemma
 There may be differences
 among the Soviet leaders cone
 cerning Khrushchev's over-all
 liberalization policies, but
 the hierarchy probably is un-
 animous in the opinion that
 some form of action must now be
 taken to strengthen Soviet con-
 trol over Poland and Hungary,
 to halt the trend in those
 countries toward overdemocrati-
 zation and independence.   It
 was evidently considered advis-
 able to make these impending
 changes known to Tito.
 Although presumably taken
 immediately to heart in Czecho-
 slovakia, East Germany, Rumania,
 Bulgaria and Albania, Soviet
 warnings to the Satellites this
 summer were apparently largely
 ignored in Hungary and actively
 resisted in Poland, reactions
 which must have produced pro-
 found shock in Moscow.  The de-
 mocratization trend in Hungary
 has accelerated during the past
 month and, according to the
 American legation in Budapest,
 the situation is dangerously
 close to getting out of hand.
 Poland's internal democratiza-
 tion program has gone ahead
 without visible pause; the re-
 gime is apparently encouraging
 a new and decidedly more inde-
 pendent view of Poland's rela-
 tions with the USSR and, simul-
 taneously,  a closer and more
 favorable look at both Yugoslav
 independence and economic
 practices.
 The USSR is faced with a
 dilemma of major proportions
 by these developments in the
 Satellites.   The decision to
 adopt a tougher attitude to-
 ward at least Poland and Hun-
 gary will, if it is to be suc-
 cessfully implemented, threaten
 the efficacy of the USSR's
 general foreign policy line of
 relaxation and peaceful coex-
 istence. Failure to act deci-
 sively, on the other hand, might
 inevitably lead to a not-too-
 distant choice between military
 intervention or a loss of control
 over some of the Satellites.
 Tito's Trip
 Tito's sudden trip to the
 USSR on 27 September, following
 eight days of conversations with
 Soviet party first secretary
 Khrushchev in Yugoslavia, was
 reportedly the result of an
 urgent, last-minute decision.
 According to Yugoslav officials,
 Khrushchev's attitude, as re-
 vealed during talks at Brioni,
 was uncompromising and reflected
 an almost complete reversal of
 earlier Soviet pronouncements
 concerning both Yugoslavia and
 the Satellites.   Tito reportedly
 threatened to make the whole
 dispute public; this allegedly
 was countered by Khrushchev
 with his invitation for Tito to
 visit the USSR and to hold talks
 with other Soviet leaders.
 Tito's acceptance apparently
 was predicated on his belief that
 every feasible effort must be
 made to preserve the Soviet
 "new look" toward his own country
 and the Satellites.   Before
 reaching any kind of agreement
 with the USSR, Tito, at a mini-
 mum, would.,probably insist that
 the USSR assure him of its
 genuine. acceptance of the legit-
 imacy of Yugoslavia's independent
 Communist role  and withdraw
 its recent warnings to the
 Satellites that Yugoslavia is

 not a model for these countries
 to follgow,
 The Soviet leaders, for
 their part, presumably invited
 Tito to the Crimea in order
 to persuade him that a "get-
 tough" policy toward at least
 two of the Satellites, Poland
 and Hungary, is absolutely
 necessary if Communist power
 in those countries is to be
 preserved.   Implementation of
 this new policy would be made
 doubly difficult if it were
 actively resisted by Yugoslavia,
 whose prestige and influence
 in Poland and Hungary has grown
 .considerably during recent
 months.   Yugoslav support for
 a somewhat harder policy in
 these countries, on the other
 hand, might soften the appear-
 ance of a reversion to Stalinism
 and might also, by facilitating
 the Soviet task., reduce the
 harshness of the new measures,
 If the USSR proposes--as
 some press reports allege--that
 some new form of international
 Communist organization be formed
 with Yugoslavia as a member,
 Tito would probably resist such
 a plan.   He believes he can
 exert his ideas and influence
 most effectively through bi-
 lateral relations with other
 Communist parties, rather than
 through an organization which
 the most powerful member, the       25X1
 USSR,    u   dominate.

 In the UN Security Council
 debate beginning 5 October,
 Britain and France hope to ob-
 tain substantial backing for
 a .Suez settlement along the
 lines of the 18-nation plan
 for international control.
 Six council members, including
 Iran, support the Suez Canal
 Users' Association (SCUA) and
 can be expected to support the
 .principle of international rule.
 The position of the other three
 non-Communist members,-- China,
 Peru, and Cuba-- remain in
 doubt.   The USSR will probably
 veto any Western resolution
 providing for international
 control.
 Foreign Minister Shepilov,
 who arrived at the UN on 3
 October, told reporters that
 the West's "hot-headed and im-
 practical projects" were no way
 to a solution of the Suez dis-
 pute.  He added that the Security
 Council debate could achieve
 "serious progress," if the par-
 ticipants displayed the necessary
 "realism, mutual understanding
 and trust."

 approach, at the same time
 keeping the door open to other
 means of negotiation.   Moscow's
 propaganda continues to men-
 tion, though with reduced em-
 phasJs, . a six-power conference
 and the Egyptian proposal for
 a 45-nation conference, as the
 best means for a solution to
 the Suez dispute.
 Egyptian Position
 The Egyptians have sent
 a strong delegation to the UN
 debate amid many indications
 that they hope the debate will
 provide a setting for negotia-
 tions leading to an acceptable
 settlement.  This apparent de-
 sire for negotiations is not
 accompanied, however, by any
 indication that Egypt's posi-
 tion on the canal problem has
 shifted.   Egyptian spokesmen
 still insist that Egypt must
 control and operate the canal.
 Cairo is willing to negotiate
 on details concerning inter-
 national rights of canal
 transit.
 Canal operations have
 generally proceeded smoothly.
 On 2 October, two British
 ships had accidents which
 caused minor traffic delays.
 Press reports from Port Said
 state that the first Soviet
 pilot guided a vessel in the
 canal on the same day.   Seven
 other Soviet pilots reportedly
 have passed their qualifying
 examinations.
 Canal authorities now
 claim to have a force of over
 200 pilots either on duty or
 in training.   If this claim
 is true, the Egyptian admin-
 istration has about the same
 number of pilots as the old
 Suez Canal Company just before
 nationalization, although not
 all the present pilots can
 handle large vessels.
 British and French Position
 The possibility that force
 will be employed to resolve the
 dispute seems to have receded.
 Prime Minister Eden and Premier
 Mollet have agreed that military
 action would be resorted to only
 in the event of almost total
 interruption in canal traffic
 or of developments in Egypt
 which would convince British
 public opinion of the necessity
 for military action.

 While 15 of the 18 nations
 that backed the earlier West-
 ern plan for international con-
 trol have formally joined SCUA,
 there is no agreement on how
 to bring Nasr to accept inter-
 national control.   London
 evidently has come to believe
 that the users should send a
 maximum volume of ships through
 the canal, while withholding
 tolls as much as possible, to
 test Egypt's ability to operate

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 4 October 1956
 25X1
 Tension has remained high
 along the Arab-Israeli borders
 since the Israeli attack on
 Jordan on 25 September.   After
 much debate and queries to
 Britain and the United States,
 Iraq appears to have decided
 to do little or nothing for
 the time being about Jordan's
 request for aid.   The Egyptians,
 however, have made some propa-
 ganda gains out of the situa-
 tion by expediting small arms
 and ammunition to Jordan by air.
 The Jordanian foreign
 minister's mission to Baghdad
 appears to have foundered on
 Iraq's reluctance to risk
 provoking Israel or to give
 away any of its own hard-won
 equipment.   Although Iraqi
 premier Nuri Said rejected at
 once Jordan's request for a
 division of Iraqi troops, he
 did indicate he would like to
 establish a military supply
 base in Jordan and possibly to
 send a "guard force" to look
 after Iraqi materiel.   The
 Iraqi chief of staff, however,
 has indicated that no Iraqi
 troops will be sent to Jordan
 until there has been an agree-
 ment with Amman on joint  mili-
 tary planning.   This proviso
 in itself would be likely to
 postpone any Iraqi troop
 movement indefinitely.
 SECRET
 Cairo was apparently
 spurred to at least token action
 by reports of the Jordanian
 appeal to Iraq.  Ambassador
 Mallory reported that Egyptian
 transport planes circled Amman
 ostentatiously before landing
 their cargoes of arms.   Press
 reports in addition indicated
 that still another meeting of
 Arab military chiefs was held
 in Cairo to consider helping
 Jordan, and Radio Cairo helped
 Jordan's King Hussain out by
 asserting that in the 25 Sep-
 tember raid, 200 Israelis had
 been found dead--shot in the
 back, because they were fleeing
 the fury of Jordan's defenders.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 4 October 1956
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 POLISH DRIVE FOR INDEPENDENCE
 CONTINUES.UNCHECKED
 Despite indications that
 the USSR is attempting to slow
 the pace of liberalization in
 the Satellites, Poland shows no
 sign of altering its course of
 seeking increased internal free-
 doms and independence of the
 Kremlin.  The Polish press has
 published blunt criticism of.
 ,Soviet-Polish relations, the
 leading Polish party newspaper
 has reprinted statements hail-
 .ing Yugoslav independence, and
 various groups continue to urge
 the adoption of further reforms.
 The Polish drive for in-
 dependence appears to be sup-
 ported primarily by a relatively
 small portion of Polish society
 consisting of party members,
 intellectuals and writers; it
 does not appear to have wide
 public participation.  Contin-
 uation of the drive for liber-
 alization at its present pace,
 however, may serve to spur the
 generally quiescent Polish
 public to take an active part
 in future developments.
 Demands for-Change
 Numerous articles and radio
 broadcasts have advocated the
 Yugoslav practice of establish-
 ing workers' councils with
 power to    run  the factories
 with a minimum of interference
 from the authorities.  Factories
 run by.such councils would
 have wide latitude in purchasing
 raw materials, planning produc-
 tion, and marketing the finished
 product, particularly as regards
 sales abroad.   One prominent
 Polish economist has gone so
 far as to advocate reliance on
 a market economy to guide the
 production of locally run
 factories.
 The single-list election
 system was attacked in a 25
 September article in Glos Pracy,
 organ of the Trade Union
 Federation, which called for a
 change in the law to permit the
 nomination of at least twice as
 many candidates as there are
 seats in the Sejm.  The trade
 union paper has not been a lead-
 ing critic of the regime in the
 past, which suggests that the
 idea of election reform may
 have originated with the govern-
 ment.   Such a change would not
 mean loss of control by the
 regime, as the candidates would
 still be selected by the Com-
 munist-controlled national
 front, but it.would allow the
 people to reject those candi-
 dates they regarded as least
 capable of representing their
 interests.
 Poznan Trials
 The regime's liberaliza-
 tioft policy has influenced the
 conduct of the Poznan trials,
 which generally have been open
 .and free, in response in part
 at least to the pressure of
 Western public opinion.   Show
 trials in the past have tended
 to place the necessity for
 internal security and control
 above the advantage of creating
 a favorable impression.
 The prosecution has admit-
 ted that the confessions of the
 defendants were secured by means
 of secret police strong-arm
 methods, and the court has
 invalidated them as evidence.
 Defense counsels have elioited
 admissions from prosecution
 witnesses that out of fear of
 police beatings they told the
 court what their examiners had
 told them to say.

 The judges have allowed the
 accused considerable freedom to
 describe the-background of the
 riots, including the use of
 anti-Russian slogans.   Several
 Western newspapermen, lawyers
 and diplomatic observers have
 been present at the trials and
 have conversed freely with de-
 fense attorneys.   The defendants
 are enjoying the fairest trial
 yet witnessed in a Communist
 country, although not. all the    25X1
 procedural safeguards of Western
 judicial procedure have been
 available to them.
 PROSPECTS FOR HATOYAMA VISIT
 TO MOSCOW
 Japanese prime minister
 Hatoyama now plans to go, to
 Moscow on 6 October in the
 hope of obtaining a quick a-
 greement to'normalize relations
 between Japan and the USSR.
 25X1
 25X1                          Moscow removed
 a major ,obstacle to the prime
 minister's trip by agreeing to
 a renewal of relations without
 a formal peace treaty on the
 basis of five points previously
 advanced by Japan, to which was
 added the stipulation that
 negotiations on the territorial
 problem would continue follow-
 ing the restoration of diplo-
 matic ties.
 Under the proposed agree-
 ment, the USSR and Japan would
 end the state of war, exchange
 ambassadors, and implement the
 fisheries pact.   The USSR would
 repatriate.the Japanese citi-
 zens it has held since the end
 of the war and would support
 Japan's admission to the UN.
 Even opponents of Hatoyama
 within the ruling Liberal-
 Democratic Party apparently
 consider his visit to Moscow
 inevitable.   While they still
 oppose his mission, their
 primary tactic now is directed
 toward obtaining a pledge that
 the Japanese delegation will
 insist on the immediate return
 to Japan of Shikotan and the
 Habomai Islands, an"act the
 USSR has previously made con-
 tingent on the conclusion of a
 peace treaty.
 Some Japanese Foreign-Min-
 istry officials believe that
 Hatoyama's chief lieutenant,
 Minister of Agriculture and
 Forestry Kano, who will ac-
 company the prime minister, will
 agree to this stipulation in
 Tokyo, but will maneuver as he
 pleases in Moscow.  They do not
 expect the Japanese mission to
 succeed. in obtaining a concession
 from Moscow on the territorial
 dispute, and they believe Kono
 expects to win credit for nor-
 malizing relations while leaving
 to others the onus of subse-
 quently losing the southern
 Kuriis.
 Former prime minister
 Yoshida feels he could rally
 a large body of public opinion
 in opposition to Hatoyama's
 policies toward the Soviet
 Union.   A Moscow settlement un-
 reasonably adverse to Japan
 might well cause the Yoshida
 faction to withdraw from the
 government party in the hope
 that the former prime minister's
 faction would ride to power
 under a new conservative a-
 lignment by exploiting the
 sacrifice of vital Japanese
 interests and territorial
 claims.

 PORTUGAL STALLS   ,
 AZORES BASES AGREEMENT
 Portugal is stalling on
 negotiations for renewal of the
 1951 Azores bases.agreement, due
 to expire at the end of 1956.
 Portuguese leaders excuse the
 delay by expressing concern over
 a possible change in the American
 attitude on the colonial issue,
 particularly Goa, and by point-
 ing to the shifting defense pic-
 ture  in Western Europe.
 Technical annexes with new
 provisions for American air
 transit- facilities in the'Azores
 were approved by the Portuguese
 military in August, following
 almost a year of negotiation.,.
 The major changes include per-
 mission to set up and operate
 an early warning system, to
 station an American intercep-
 tor day-fighter squadron, and
 to increase the number of
 American personnel on the islands.
 These provisions are, however,
 subject to the approval of

 course of negotiations for a
 renewal of the over-all defense
 agreement.

 gate the international regime

 end foreign domination of the
 city's government which has ex-
 isted since the eighteenth
 century.
 and Defense Minister Santos
 Costa have admitted that the
 government was stalling, but
 both expressed the. hope that
 an agreement would be reached
 by mid-November.   They cited
 "the uncertainties of Ameri-
 can policy in an election
 year" and the possibility that
 the colonial issue may be in-
 jected into the election cam-
 paign.   They are particularly
 worried about President Eisen--
 hower's renewed invitation to
 Nehru to visit the US and what
 the US may do or say on Goa.
 Prime Minister Salazar
 believes the threat of war in
 Europe is receding.   The Portu-
 guese are watching closely the
 current developments regard-
 ing the American base in Ice-
 land and the signs of increas-
 ing emphasis on the use of
 nuclear weapons in the defense
 of Western Europe.
 Lisbon probably will con-
 tinue to refuse to extend
 American rights in the Azores
 for the duration of NATO.
 Since Portugal succeeded in
 limiting the 1951 agreement
 to a five-year period, it is
 almost certain to insist on a
 similar limitation in a new
 agreement.

 ments involved--France, Spain,
 Britain, Italy,. Portugal, Bel-

 about the situation than re-
 siding minister Robert Lacoste.
 They maintain that the security
 situation has greatly worsened
 in the last six months despite
 the tremendous build-up of
 French forces.   They point to
 the spread of rebel activity
 into new areas and the multi-
 plication of attacks against
 persons and property, especial-
 ly in urban areas such as
 Algiers.
 Some responsible officials
 in Paris are also gloomy over
 the military Picture.   These
 officials admitted privately
 last month that the "pacifica-
 tion" claimed for certain areas
 was considered temporary and
 meant only that French control
 had been re-established for
 the daylight hours.   They
 acknowledged that reports they
 had received indicated that
 90 percent of the Moslem pop-
 ulation is now infected with
 the concept of Algerian in-
 dependence.
 Developments in the guer-
 rilla conflict during September
 appear to sustain these more
 pessimistic appraisals of the
 situation.   Urban and rural
 terrorism, economic sabotage,
 and ambushes of Small military"
 detachments apparently increas-
 ed as compared with the two
 preceding months, while at the
 same time the total area re-
 garded as "insecure" expanded,
 especially in the west.

 expected to step up their effort
 to widen the breach between
 the settlers and the Moslems.
 On the political front,
 Lacoste has persuaded the
 French cabinet to defer defini-
 tion of a new status for Algeria
 pending further developments
 in the Suez crisis.  Mollet
 still expects to propose a new
 Algerian regime to the National
 Assembly sometime before the
 end of October..   This plan is
 virtually certain to fall short
 of recognizing Algerian inde-
 pendence and is therefore un-
 likely either to provide a
 basis for fruitful negotia-
 tions with nationalist leaders
 or, if imposed., to gain any
 substantial measure of support
 from the Moslems of Algeria.

 DISTURBANCES LIKELY IN CUBA
 An increasing number of
 reports have claimed that rev-
 olutionary activity in Cuba
 is planned in the near future;
 and disturbances therefore
 seem likely,
 Batista probably no longer
 enjoys the solid support of
 the army,'which is a deter-
 .mining factor in the situation,
 and there is some evidence of
 dissatisfaction, particularly
 among the younger officers.
 The American embassy
 states that a movement led by
 determined military personnel,
 relying on surprise and general
 apathy, might be successful.
 25X1

 current conspiracies in Cuba
 are related to activities of
 exiles, including Fidel Castro,
 whose "26 of July Movement"
 is also active in Cuba and
 was purportedly contacted recent-
 ly by Cuban Communists.
 There are as yet. no signs
 of widespread civilian unrest.
 The comparatively prosperous
 population appears generally
 apathetic toward the political
 situation, and a movement
 relying principally on civil-
 ian support would probably
 have little chance of success.
 Discontent, however, was
 heightened by the government's
 decision to hold partial elec-
 tions in 1957 in the face.of
 opposition demands for general
 elections as soon as possible.
 Increasing resistance was
 indicated by the Barquin'con-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 SOVIET PLANS
 FOR AN EARTH SATELLITE
 Soviet representatives
 at two recent international
 scientific meetings tended to
 be noncommittal on the USSR's
 plans for an earth. satellite.
 This reticence, which contrasts
 with previous announcements,
 may mean that the Soviet Union
 has decided to avoid inter-
 national commitments which
 would require it to reveal its
 techniques in the guided missile
 field, or merely that a de-
 tailed announcement is to be
 held off until a successful
 launching is more certain.
 Estimates give the USSR the
 capability to launch a small
 earth satellite successfully
 by early 1957.
 At a meeting of scientists
 organizing plans for the Inter-
 national Geophysical Year (IGY)
 at Barcelona from 10 to 15
 September, the Soviet repre-
 sentative commented vaguely
 that "Russia is studying the
 launching of an artificial
 satellite by means of rockets."
 Previous information had indi-
 catedthat the USSR would dis-
 cuss its earth satellite plans
 in detail at Barcelona.   At an
 international astronautical
 meeting in Rome later last month,
 the Soviet delegation similarly
 made no formal announcement of
 an earth satellite program,al-
 though it did propose inform-
 ally that the USSR and the
 United States pool their knowl-
 edge  on the subject.   In
 addition, the leading Soviet
 scientist in the field, L. 1.
 Sedov, commented at the Rome
 meeting,  "I guess the United
 States is ahead, on the whole,
 of all the countries."
 The successful launching of
 an earth satellite requires
 solving many of the same
 scientific and engineering
 problems encountered in the
 development of a long-range
 ballistics missile, with the
 added requirement of a long-
 life Hower supply.  Because
 the Soviet Union has shown a
 high capability in the guided
 missile field, earlier announce-
 inents of plans to launch a
 satellite appeared feasible.
 On 16 April 1955, the USSR
 announced the formation of a
 Permanent Interagency Commis-
 sion fcr Interplanetary Communi-
 cations.  This organization,
 composed of scientists whose
 competence in such fields as
 astrophysics and nuclear.energy
 is internationally recognized,
 was given the task of organizing
 work on an automatic laboratory
 for scientific research in
 cosmic space.   In August 1955,
 shortly after the United States
 announced plans to launch a
 satellite, Sedov, the chairman
 of this commission, revealed
 that the USSR had similar plans.
 A month later, Khrushchev
 boasted to West Germany's Chan-
 cellor Adenauer, who was then in
 Moscow, that the USSR was ahead
 of America in the building of
 space satellites,   In January
 1956, Professor G. I. Pokrovsky,
 reportedly a member of the Inter-
 planetary. Communications Com-
 mission, stated in a Soviet
 newspaper that the Soviet Union
 would launch an artificial
 tellite in 1956  by a method
 different from the three-stage
 rocket launching procedure on
 which American plans are based.
 While attending a Jet Pro-
 pulsion Congress in West Germany
 in  'ehruary 1956, Soviet scien-
 tists reportedly stated that the
 USSR planned to launch 12 to 14
 satellites in their program.
 The scientists stated that mal-
 .function of components and errors
 in calculation were expected
 and that they would be satisfied
 if 50 percent of the vehicles
 launched attained their cal-
 culated orbit.  Such a program
 would be comparable to the
 American program.                        25X1

 NEW SOVIET YOUTH SQUADS
 COMBAT CRIME
 The reactivation of So-
 viet Communist Youth League
 (Komsomol) "light cavalry"
 squads in the Odessa Oblast of
 the Ukraine, announced on 23
 September, highlights the seri-
 ous problem of law enforcement
 in the USSR.  One of the major
 functions of these units pre-
 sumably.will be to engage in
 surprise raids on places of
 amusement of public assembly to
 deal with acts of "hooliganism"
 and crime.
 So-called "light cavalry"
 units of the Komsomol were first
 formed about 1928 for the pur-
 pose of aiding party and state
 organs in eliminating "bureau-
 cratism" in economic enterprises.
 Their principal function evi-
 dently consisted of flying
 raids, undertaken jointly with

 COMMUNIST CHINA
 INCREASES UNIVERSITY ENROLLMENT
 In an effort to increase
 the supply of trained technical
 personnel, Peiping has almost
 doubled new enrollments in
 institutions of higher learning.
 The regime has gone so far as
 to direct industry and adminis-
 trative organizations to release
 employees to study for college
 entrance examinations and to
 prohibit them from recruiting
 middle school graduates
 eligible for university study.
 A need for greater enroll-
 ment in institutions of
 higher. ?1earning-was first ex-
 pressed by Chou En-lai at a
 meeting of the party's central
 committee in January4  Two weeks
 later, Peiping announced that
 a 12-year education program was
 being drawn up to provide
 Workers and Peasants Inspection,
 designed to expose shortcomings
 in factories or on collective
 farms.  After having served its
 purpose as a "major form of mass
 control and criticism from be-
 low," the "light ca v/airy" was
 abolished in the mid-1930's.
 During the past two years,
 Soviet youth has been called
 upon more and more frequently
 to aid the militia (ordinary
 police) in the struggle against
 crime and delinquency.  The
 Odessa campaign is reportedly
 patterned on the successful
 one launched in Leningrad two
 years ago.  The organization of

 Peiping's announcement on
 1 Septeiykber that 180,000 new
 students--nearly twice the 1955
 figure--began the academic year,
 showed that these emergency
 measures achieved their immedi-
 ate objective.  However, the
 basic problem of a shortage of
 qualified middle school
 graduates to fill college en-
 rollment quotas remains to be
 solved.
 The regime itself is. partly
 responsible for this shortage
 through its past encouragement
 of students to join the labor
 force   As recently as July
 1955, the minister of education,
 Chang Hsi-Jo, affirmed the
 government's position that
 primary and junior middle school
 graduates should be encouraged
 to enter the labor force, in
 TRANSPORT PROBLEMS
 IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 Rail congestion and traf-
 fic tie-ups in widely. separated
 localities in 'Communist China
 ,in the past month have slowed
 freight movement and in some
 areas have temporarily reduced
 industrial output.   In his 18
 September speech at the Chi-
 nese Communist Party Congress,
 Chou En-Lai stated that the
 preseit transport situation
 was "tense."  Wang Shan-tou,
 director of the State Council's
 transport . planning office, in
 his speech before the congress
 said that Chinese transport in
 1956 was being required to
 .carry a freight volume which
 originally had been planned for
 1957 and that "contradictions"
 the belief that only a small
 portion of them could aspire
 to   further education.  With
 this sanction of the govern-
 ment, peasants took their
 children from school in order
 to increase family incomes,
 and "mass diecontinu.ations" of
 studies reached 50 percent in
 some areas.  At this year's
 session of the National
 People's Congress, however,
 Chang criticized peasants for
 the practice, saying it would
 seriously hinder the state's
 development of higher education
 and national construction
 projects.
 Continued use of this year's
 emergency measures will,probably
 be necessary to enable the
 regime to attain the 1962 enroll-
 ment goal of 850,040 set in the
 recently announced Second Five-
 Year Plan, a figure more than
 double this year's total enroll-
 ment in institutions of higher
 learning;                           25X1

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 COMPOSITION OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY'S GOVERNING BODIES
 The composition of the
 Chinese Communist Party's govern-
 ing                     bodies, as revealed at the
 party's eighth congress, con-
 firms that Mao Tse-tung con-
 tinues to dominate the party.
 The proceedings at the congress
 also provided nearly conclusive
 evidence  that Liu Shao-chi
 and Chou En-lai have retained
 the second and third positions,
 and that Teng Hsiao-ping has
 joined the top handful of party
 leaders.
 Mao has been the undis-
 puted leader of the party since
 1935.   Liu has been his prin-
 cipal lieutenant and his main
 spokesman in party affairs
 since 1945.   Chou has been
 premier of the Peiping regime
 since 1949 and has been con-
 sistently ranked third by Pei-
 ping since 1953. Teng, secretary
 general of the central com-
 mittee, joined the politburo
 only in 1954.
 Mao is to remain chair-
 man of the central committee
 and its politburo.   Liu is to
 be the senior vice chairman,
 with Chou next in line.  These
 three leaders are to be the
 top three members of the
 politburo's new standing
 committee.  Teng is to be a
 member of the standing com-
 mittee, and is the new head of
 the central committee's secre-
 tariat.
 Standing Committee
 The new six-man standing
 committee., which also includes
 two party leaders--Chu Te and
 Chen Yun--who for years have
 been formally ranked fourth
 and fifth, will probably come
 to be the center of power in
 the party and regime.   The com-
 mittee is similar in composi-
 tion to the party's old secre-
 tariat, which had evidently been
 discharging the wide powers of
 the politburo between meetings.
 Mao may turn over the direction
 of the committee to Liu Shao-
 chi, who apparently directed
 the party meetings which pre-
 ceded the congress and part
 of the congress itself.
 The new secretariat,
 under Teng,  probably will
 be confined to its constitu-
 tional role of directing the
 routine work of the central
 committee.   Teng's post will
 thus be similar to his previous
 office of secretary general.

 The central committee al-
 so elected a 21-man control
 commission which will probably
 retain its predecessor's func-
 tion of broad supervisory
 authority over the party.   The
 new body contains no major.
 figures, however, and like the
 old commission will be unable
 to take action against members
 of the central committee.
 The politburo has been
 enlarged from 13 members to
 17 full and six non-voting
 members.   Eighteen of the 23
 occupy key posts in the party
 and regime.   The politburo has
 retained four of Mao's old
 comrades who no longer seem to
 be important figures: Chu Te,
 Lin Po-chu, Tung Pi-wu, and
 Lin Piao, who is
 evidently too ill
 for any work.   One
 of the ten new mem-
 bers, Liu Po-cheng,
 appears to owe his
 politburo post to
 prestige gained as
 a military leader
 many years ago.
 Two of the key
 figures on the polit-
 buro are Liu Shao-
 chi's deputies on
 the government body
 which supervises
 Chou En-lai's State
 Council (cabinet).
 These are Peng Chen,
 who is also mayor and
 party boss of Pei-
 ping, and Lo Jung-
 huan, who concur-
 rently directs the
 political officer
 system in the armed
 forces.
 Eight important
 members of the new
 politburo.are vice
 premiers in the
 government under
 Chou En-lei.   In
 addition to Teng
 Hsiao-ping, they
 are: senior vice
 premier Chen Yun,
 an ?economic.specialist; Peng
 Te-huai,.minister of defense
 and the regime's top military
 man; Ho Lung and Chen I, one-

 been utility men for Chou; Li
 Fu-chun,. long-range planning
 .director; Li Hsien-nien,.a
 top economic co-ordinator; and
 alternate member Ulanfu, boss
 of Inner Mongolia.
 The other alternate mem-
 bers are: Cheng Wen-tien,
 Chou's senior deputy foreign
 minister; Lu Ting-i, director
 of the party's propaganda de-
 partment; Chen Po-ta, one of
 Lu's deputies and a longtime
 spokesman for Mao Tse-tung;

 gime's annual economic plan-

 secret police chief.   Kang's
 decline from sixth to twenty-
 second place on the politburo
 may reflect either the recent
 Soviet practice of excluding
 the secret police chief from
 the inner circle, or a failure
 by Kang's apparatus in the
 Kao-Jao "conspiracy" against
 other party leaders in 1954.
 Central Committee
 The new central committee,
 which has more than twice the
 membership of its predecessor,
 is likely to be little more
 important as a body.   Although
 the committee will probably
 meet much more often than in
 the past, its function will
 continue to be essentially
 that of approving the policy
 decisions taken by a small
 group of politburo members.
 The new central committee
 includes the great majority
 of the actual leaders of the
 party, government and military
 establishment.   Several persons
 have been left out, however,
 whose posts would seem to
 justify their membership, and
 many have been named simply as
 a reward for past performances
 or in deference to ethnic and
 professional groups.
 The composition of the
 committee is more significant
 as a reflection of the rela-
 tive power positions of the
 top leaders.  Mao's friends
 and proteges occupy more slots
 than those of any other leader.
 However, Liu, Chou, Teng and
 Peng Te-huai are well repre-
 sented.   Lesser numbers of
 proteges of most other members
 of the politburo can also be
 identified.
 Su Yu, the regime's chief
 of staff who has been out of
 the news for months, was elected
 to the new committee but ranks
 several slots below his deputy,
 Chen Keng, who has been identi-
 fied as "acting" chief of staff.
 Chou Shih-ti, commander of the
 air defense forces which were
 slighted in Peng Te-huai's
 speech on military affairs,
 .was not elected to the commit-
 tee, and another man has just
 been identified by a Communist
 newspaper as holding Chou's
 post.
 Almost all of the polit-
 buro members, and most of the
 97 full members of the new
 central committee have records--
 in terms of residence, journeys,
 writings or liaison work--which
 indicate strong bonds with the
 Soviet Union.   Although Mao and
 his principal lieutenants are
 not Soviet puppets, as were
 certain earlier party leaders,
 they can be expected to view
 the maintenance of the Sino-
 Soviet alliance, in Liu Shao-
 chi's words, as the party's
 "supreme international duty."

 and European integration.
 Chancellor Adenauer's
 popularity has waned somewhat,
 as recent public opinion polls
 have indicated, and his Chris-
 tian Democratic Party is con-
 sequently on the defensive.
 He will find it increasingly
 difficult to get his way in
 legislative matters and may
 have to accept compromises in-
 compatible with his previous
 strong'prb-Western stand.
 The chancellor has already
 started the fight to retain
 command of the situation.  On
 the basis of his meeting of
 29 September with Premier Mol-
 let, Adenauer is playing up
 the prospects of a Saar settle-
 ment favorable for West Ger-
 many, and in a speech in Brus-
 sels on 25 September he advo-
 cated a new and looser concept
 of European unity.
 German unification remains
 the primary concern of the
 Bonn government.  Adenauer is
 under heavy attack on this is-
 sue for inflexibility and in-
 action.    The chancellor hopes
 to meet the growing criticism
 on this score, not by any shift
 of policy, but by a continued
 exchange of notes with Moscow.
 The USSR has not yet re-
 plied'officially to Bonn's
 note of 7 September asking for
 an exchange of ideas and re-
 iterating its demands for free
 all-German elections and free-
 dom for a united Germany to
 join any alliance.  Over the
 coming months Adenauer may find
 himself more isolated in his
 own party on the freedom-of-
 alliance stand.
 The Adenauer government
 must also move to meet opposi-
 tion charges that it deliber-
 ately keeps Bonn-Moscow rela-
 tions frigid.  Bonn officials
 virtually ignored Soviet ambas-
 sador Zorin, who has not been
 replaced since his recall in
 July.  Bonn's ambassador to
 Moscow will remain in the Feder-
 al" Republic for several months
 undergoing medical treatment.
 Pressure to improve this state
 of affairs, and to adopt a more
 liberal policy on trade and
 cultural relations with the
 USSR, is likely in parliament
 and the press.
 As a move in this direction
 and against Adenauer's wishes,.
 his party has decided to join
 all other parties in accepting
 a Soviet invitation to send.
 a Bundestag delegation to Mos-
 cow.
 The government will meet
 increasing demands for a more
 radical change of policy toward
 the European Satellites.   Even
 coalition members see little
 merit in Bonn's refusal to es-
 tablish diplomatic relations
 because the Satellites have
 recognized East Germany. None-
 theless, the government is
 fearful that if it gives in on
 this score, it will encourage
 the recognition of the Soviet-
 zone regime by other free world
 states.
 While all parties agree
 that ambassadors should not be
 exchanged with East Germany,
 the government will have to
 make some concession to repeated
 demands for a more positive
 attitude toward interzonal con-
 tacts.  Many West Germans are
 genuinely worried that a, formid -
 able cultural gulf is being
 created which will enormously
 complicate a future unification.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 4 October 1956
 Rearmament
 Another matter on a par
 with unification and equally
 explosive as the election ap-
 proaches is that of rearmament.
 Although the build-up of the
 army, navy and air force is
 already  well launched, the pub-
 lic remains apathetic or skep-
 tical of the utility of the
 program in an atomic age.
 Adenauer must convince the
 West Germans that rearmament
 as presently planned is neces-
 sary, and, at the same time,
 satisfy NATO that the program
 is adequate to Western defense
 needs.
 To meet the widespread
 antipathy to conscription, the
 government decided on 27 Sep-
 tember to make the draft term
 12 instead of 18 months.   This
 decision precipitated a.special
 session of the North Atlantic
 Council, which expressed con-
 cern and asked for reconsidera-
 tion.   The government, however,
 is not likely to consider any
 change politically possible
 and is in some doubt about the
 feasibility of initiating con-
 scription before the September
 1957 election.
 The shortened draft term
 has even added to the govern-
 ment's domestic difficulties
 because the Defense Ministry
 now plans to recruit 70,000
 additional volunteers and pro-
 vide added pay incentives cost-
 ing $190,000,000--a plan likely
 to be fought by Finance Mini-
 ster Schaeffer.   He is already
 unhappy over the government's
 intention to reduce taxes and
 increase social benefits in
 an effort to win votes.
 Adenauer is particularly
 critical of the reported in-
 tention of the United States
 and Britain to shift their
 strategic emphasis from con-
 ventional to atomic weapons
 and reduce their ground forces
 in Europe.   Not only have these
 reports caused Germans to
 question Adenauer's plans for
 a 400,000-man army, but they
 are giving rise to demand for
 an army supplied with atomic
 weapons.
 Despite these complications,
 the recruiting of volunteers
 has continued at a high rate
 in recent weeks, and the De-
 fense Ministry insists that it
 will meet its goal of 96,000
 men in uniform by the end of
 1956.  The complete build-up,
 however, seems certain to be
 stretched out beyond the pro-
 jected three to four years.
 European Co-operation
 To divert attention from
 his inability to do much about,
 German unification, Adenauer
 intends to push for progress
 in West European co-operation.
 A major, obstacle to French-
 German co-operation was removed
 on 29 September when Adenauer
 and Mollet  agreed on the terms
 of a Saar settlement which will
 transfer the area to Germany
 on 1 January 1957.   This will
 add the votes of the Saarlanders
 in next year's election.   If
 Luxembourg objections can be
 met, Adenauer will have an agree-
 ment on the canalization of the
 Moselle to push through a some-
 what unwilling parliament this
 fall.
 Adenauer's principal in-
 terest in the field of integra-
 tion now is a mechanism for co-
 ordinating the policies of Euro-
 pean nations, partly to increase
 Germany's voice in world affairs.
 He cites the Suez crisis as il-
 lustrating this need.   In Brus-
 sels on 25 September, the chan-
 cellor called for a new political
 organization open to all European
 countries and having as broad a
 field of activity as possible.
 To make British membership pos-
 sible, he turned his back on
 "perfectionism," and said the
 new organization need not be
 entirely supranational.
 His new approach is an ap-
 peal to Europe to stand more
 squarely on its own feet and for
 European states to co-ordinate
 their actions in an organization
 in which the US is not a member.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The Greek government and
 the opposition are anticipat-
 ing a major crisis in November,
 which they expect to follow a
 decision by the UN General
 Assembly on whether or not to
 consider the Cyprus issue.
 Prime Minister Karamanlis is be-
 lieved to be canvassing possible
 courses of action to meet the
 test, which is bound to come no
 matter what the assembly decides,
 while opposition leaders are
 co-operating in a campaign to
 overthrow  him and force new
 elections.
 Possible Government Actions
 Karamanlis continues to
 hope for American support con-
 cerning the Cyprus issue in the
 UN, if not ultimately on a sub-
 stantive decision, at least on
 the inscription issue.  He be-
 lieves such support would en-
 able him to surmount the coming
 challenge even if Greece were
 eventually defeated and might
 substantially increase his
 support in parliament.   In
 anticipation of possible UN
 rejection of the Cyprus item,
 opposition circles and the
 press are speculating on a
 wide range of courses Karamanlis
 might adopt:  (1) the resignation
 of his government to permit the
 formation of an opposition
 coalition government;  (2) a call
 for new elections to seek a new
 mandate for his regime;  (3) the
 convocation of a crown council
 which, under the king's chair-
 manship, would determine future
 Greek policy on Cyprus;  (4) the
 severing of diplomatic relations
 with Britain or Turkey, or both;
 and (5)  the imposition of a
 personal dictatorship based on
 palace and army support.
 Karamanlis will probably
 do everything in his power to
 retain his position by con-
 stitutional means.  He has out-
 lined for the'progovernment
 press a domestic propaganda
 line regarding the appeal to
 the UN on Cyprus which assumes
 that his government need not
 resign if defeated in the UN.
 If his government seems in danger
 of falling, he may take
 dramatic steps--breaking rela-
 tions with Britain or Turkey,
 or both--to appease Greek popu-
 lar opinion.
 Oposition Moves
 Opposition leaders are
 rumored to be rebuilding the
 Popular Front coalition, which
 won a plurality of the vote in
 the February 1956 elections.
 The'Communist-front United Demo-
 cratic Left, the fellow-travel-
 ing Democratic Party of the
 Working People, the left-of-
 center National Progressive
 Union of the Center, and the
 centrist Liberal Party are
 widely believed to have agreed
 to form a new front under the
 leadership of Liberal Party
 chief George Papandreou.
 Presumably, the long-standing
 rivalry between Papandreou and
 Liberal Democratic Union head
 Sophocles Venizelos is re-
 sponsible for the absence from
 the front thus far of the
 latter's party.
 In an apparent attempt to
 neutralize the palace, which
 has consistently supported
 Karamanlis, opposition leaders
 have been co-operating in a
 press campaign to expose dubious
 business and political activities
 among members of the court, and
 a left-wing opposition deputy
 has lodged a parliamentary
 interpellation concerning the
 palace and secret government
 funds, which will probably cause
 difficulties for the government
 when parliament reconvenes on
 15 October.
 It is widely believed
 in government circles that
 neither the opposition, the

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Communists, nor Britain wants
 the Cyprus issue solved.   The
 opposition appears convinced
 that this issue will cause
 Karamanlis' downfall.   Cyprus
 has also increasingly embit-
 tered Greek-British and Greek-
 Turkish relations, causing the
 virtual demise of the Balkan
 alliance and seriously weaken-
 ing NATO unity in the eastern
 Mediterranean.  Government
 leaders profess not to under-
 stand the British attitude,
 since they feel any succeeding
 government in Athens would
 necessarily be less moderate
 on the Cyprus question and
 more inclined to reckless ac-
 Lion.
 Prospects
 Karamanlis' government prob-
 ably has a better chance than
 any successor government, under
 present circumstances, of ad-
 hering to a firmly pro-Western
 stand.  Any successor would
 likely be a weak coalition of
 conflicting factions which,
 while nominally nationalist,
 would be susceptible to Com-
 munist influence and might
 lead eventually to dictatorship
 of either the right or the left.
 Karamanlis' position at the
 moment is relatively secure,
 although it might be dangerously
 weakened by any incident involv-
 ing Britain or Turkey.

 SOVIET BIOLOGICAL WARFARE DEVELOPMENTS
 Recent indications point
 to intensified Soviet interest
 in biological warfare.   The
 USSR's defensive capability is
 restricted by deficiencies in
 sanitation, public health and
 crop protection.   The Soviet
 Union is probably attempting
 to acquire a capability ade-
 quate for retaliation in kind
 against a BW attack,
 Recent Developments
 The USSR in 1955 was for
 the first time instructing its
 troops in the defensive prob-
 lems                  posed by biological
 warfare as well as nuclear and
 chemical warfare weapons. i
 Soviet references to bio-
 logical warfare in the past
 were usually contained in propa-
 ganda statements charging other
 nations with using this "un-
 lawful" weans of warfare.  How-
 ever, Soviet defense minister
 Zhukov in addressing the 20th
 party congress in February
 stated:   "If a war is unleashed
 in the future, it will be char-
 acterized by a mass use of air
 power, various types of rocket
 weapons, and various means of
 mass destruction such as atomic,
 thermonuclear, chemical and
 bacteriological weapons."  This
 is the first known statement by
 a high-level  official to give
 bacteriological warfare a role
 in Soviet military planning.
 The Geneva Convention of
 1924, ratified by the USSR, not
 only prohibits the use of bac-
 teriological warfare, but does
 not permit its use in retalia-
 tion as it does in the case of
 chemical warfare.   The USSR has
 declared that it will not be
 bound by the latter restriction.
 The tenor of Soviet defensive
 doctrine is to treat BW as an
 expected form of attack.
