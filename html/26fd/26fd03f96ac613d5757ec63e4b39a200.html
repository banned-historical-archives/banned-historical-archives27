 Key Judgments     After a year or more of fruitless talks, the British and Chinese have finally

 conceded sovereignty-subject to Parliamentary approval-and even
 dropped their insistence on retaining a formal role in Hong Kong's post-
 1997 administration. But London still hopes to gain an unofficial advisory
 role and to conclude a treaty that will ensure that Beijing lives up to its
 promises to keep Hong Kong's socioeconomic system intact. Much hard
 bargaining remains.
 Both the British and Chinese have important incentives for reaching an
 amicable settlement. Beijing wants to:
 ? Inherit Hong Kong as a going economic concern to assist China's
 modernization.
 ? Rectify a deeply resented historical grievance at minimum cost.
 ? Show its tolerance for Hong Kong's capitalist system to induce Taiwan to
 engage in reunification talks.
 ? Demonstrate progress toward reunifying the country.
 ? Prevent problems over Hong Kong from discouraging Western invest-
 ment in China.
 The.British in turn recognize that a Chinese takeover in 1997 is inevitable
 and that an orderly transition that maintains local confidence and avoids
 turmoil is desirable. London is anxious to reach an agreement that allows it
 to withdraw with honor, while protecting the interests of the roughly 5.5
 million residents of Hong Kong. It also wants to protect Britain's political
 and economic relations with China, as well as with Hong Kong.
 As a result, we believe the chances are better than even that the British and
 the Chinese will reach an interim agreement in the next year or two. Such
 an accord would buy time for the two sides to negotiate the complex
 technical aspects of a comprehensive agreement, which the British Parlia-
 ment must then ratify. The initial reaction in Hong Kong to such an
 interim agreement probably would be favorable.
 The talks, however,-could drag on, or even break down. Under these
 circumstances, Hong Kong's economy would suffer. Emigration and
 capital flight would grow, perhaps dramatically, increasing the burden on
 Beijing and London to maintain Hong Kong's economy. Relations between
 the two also would become frayed, making it that much more difficult to
 overcome the obstacles to a settlement.

 In the most extreme and least likely case, a collapse of the talks could trig-
 ger unrest serious enough to provoke direct Chinese military intervention.
 Alternatively, the British could cave in to China's demands, or even declare
 their intention to pull out of Hong Kong well before 1997. Either action
 would set off shock waves in Hong Kong. Business confidence would
 plummet and emigration would increase sharply-leaving Beijing with
 serious economic problems to sort out, even if the British sought to help
 calm local fears.
 US interests would be best served by an interim accord. If the talks break
 down, severe strains in Sino-British relations could adversely affect China's
 attitude toward other Western states. The collapse of negotiations would
 also affect some US companies, which have an estimated $3-4 billion
 invested in Hong Kong. The United States, along with other Western
 states, would also face the problem of how to deal with the potential flood
 of immigrants.

 The Hong Kong Talks:
 Possible Outcomes
 The Sino-British talks over Hong Kong have only
 recently begun to make progress on substantive mat-
 ters. The British initially refused to acknowledge
 Chinese sovereignty, hoping to retain a formal British
 role in Hong Kong after 1997. But under persistent
 Chinese pressure, London finally acceded conditional-
 ly last summer to China's demand that Chinese
 sovereignty over the colony be recognized. After Hong
 Kong's business community began to show signs of
 panic last fall, the British made further concessions.
 In October the British dropped their insistence on a
 formal British presence in Hong Kong after 1997 and
 indicated their willingness to negotiate on the basis of
 the Chinese plan for Hong Kong.
 The Chinese initially doubted Prime Minister Thatch-
 er's sincerity. This doubt strengthened after she pub-
 licly reiterated, in late October, London's interest in
 maintaining a link to Hong Kong after 1997. An
 unproductive session followed in November. British
 reassurances finally allowed the two sides to begin
 discussing substantive issues in December.
 The British have prepared a series of briefing papers
 to "educate" the Chinese on Hong Kong's administra-
 tion. These are now being used as a basis for discus-
 sions. Thus far, the Chinese have agreed to retain
 British expatriate administrators (although they could
 not agree at what level these officials should serve),
 maintain an independent judiciary, and implement a
 uniform land leasing system for Hong Kong.
 Both sides have important political and economic
 reasons for reaching a mutually satisfactory settle-
 ment. As the eventual inheritor of Hong Kong, China
 has the most at stake. Beijing wants to keep Hong
 Kong's economy viable because of the important role
 the colony plays in China's modernization program.
 Not only does China earn about one-third of its
 foreign exchange in Hong Kong, but the colony is an
 important source of financial and technical assistance.
 This assessment speculates on the directions the
 Sino-British talks on Hong Kong could take over the
 next few years. Six possible scenarios are offered
 along with the likely consequences for each. Although
 not intended as a precise estimate, the scenarios are
 presented in rough order of probability. In the intro-
 duction the background to the talks is discussed,
 including the incentives and prospects for a settle-
 ment. (C NF)
 In developing these scenarios, we assume certain
 factors will remain constant: that no radical change
 in government will occur in either London or Beijing
 except where noted in the scenarios; that the interna-
 tional market for Hong Kong's exports will remain
 strong; that human and capital flight from Hong
 Kong will not reach serious proportions unless the
 talks turn sour. (C NF)
 Hong Kong business interests account for an estimat-
 ed one-third to one-half of foreign investment in
 China and about 90 percent of the investments in the
 special economic zones. They are also important
 middlemen in China's trade with Western companies.
 25X1
 Beijing has gone to considerable lengths to reassure 25X1
 Hong Kong's business leaders and the rest of the
 population about China's intentions. Deng Xiaoping
 and other Chinese leaders have repeatedly promised
 to leave the city's social and economic system alone-
 for at least 50 years after 1997. Beijing also has
 intervened several times over the past year to prop up
 the Hong Kong dollar and has expanded its loans and
 investments in the city to demonstrate its commitment
 to the local economy's continued vitality.

 problems over Hong Kong to trigger a pullout of
 foreign companies, or to discourage foreign invest-
 ment in China.
 Chinese leaders have informally ,floated plans for
 Hong Kong in their media outlets in the colony and in
 meetings with Hong Kong residents to test local
 reactions. They have suggested these plans be codi-
 fied in a so-called miniconstitution, which would be
 rated by China's National People's Congress only
 after consultations with the residents of Hong Kong.
 The highlights are:
 ? Hong Kong will become a special administrative
 region of China under Article 31 of the Chinese
 Constitution beginning in 1997 when Beijing regains
 sovereignty and administrative control.
 ? Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy
 with local people administering the city. Beijing has
 raised the possibility of local elections to select the
 senior local authorities.
 ? Hong Kong's present capitalist social-economic sys-
 tem will remain unchanged for at least 50 years
 after 1997.
 ? Hong Kong's legal structure will remain basically
 unchanged except that the highest court of appeals
 will be in Hong Kong instead of London.
 ? Local and expatriate civil servants, including po-
 licemen and administrators can retain their jobs.
 ? Hong Kong's status as a free port and international
 financial center will remain unchanged.
 ? The Hong Kong dollar will remain a separate and
 freely convertible currency.
 ? Residents will enjoy the right offree speech, assem-
 bly, press, and the freedom to travel.
 ? Beijing will be responsible for Hong Kong's foreign
 affairs, but will maintain its separate status in
 international organizations and in international
 agreements. It will be allowed to issue its own
 travel documents.
 ? The Hong Kong government will be responsible for
 the public security, maintained by the local police
 force.
 ? The economic interests of Britain and other coun-
 tries will be respected.
 system.
 Finally, we believe the high priority Beijing attaches
 to promoting reunification with Taiwan has and will
 likely continue to influence its moderate and concilia-
 tory approach. Chinese leaders hope Taipei will be-
 come more willing to negotiate if Beijing shows it can
 live with and even protect Hong Kong's capitalist     25X1
 Balanced against these pragmatic considerations is
 China's determination-for nationalistic reasons-to
 regain Hong Kong. A key goal of the Communist
 revolution in 1949 was to expunge China's humilia-
 tion at the hands of outside powers. We believe the
 present Chinese leadership feels equally determined
 about completing that task by reuniting Hong Kong,
 Macau, and Taiwan with the motherland. Deng Xiao-
 ping in fact has made reunification one of China's
 three major goals for this decade. Beijing probably is
 prepared, therefore, to pay a heavy economic price-
 if necessary-to regain Hong Kong by 1997.F
 25X1
 Although the British have little confidence in China's
 ability to run Hong Kong, they recognize their negoti-
 ating leverage is limited and that a Chinese takeover
 is almost inevitable once the lease on the New Territo-
 ries, which constitute about 90 percent of the colony,
 expires in 1997 (see map). Prime Minister Thatcher's
 main bargaining card is her ability to withhold the
 formal legitimacy a settlement would give China to
 recover sovereignty.                           25X1

 including the Daya Bay nuclear plant to be built near
 Hong Kong. Overall bilateral trade between Britain
 and China was about $600 million in 1983.
 Nor does London want its economic stake in Hong
 Kong threatened by instability there. Although the
 United Kingdom accounts for only about 6 percent of
 direct total investment in the colony (as compared
 with 45 percent for the United States and 30 percent
 for Japan) Hong Kong replaced Japan in 1982 as
 Britain's largest Asian market. Trade between Britain
 and Hong Kong has grown from $625 million in 1972
 to $2.4 billion in 1982. British firms have made
 sizable profits in the colony's service sector, especially
 in banking, real estate, and insurance. For certain
 British industries, such as shipbuilding, Hong Kong
 accounts for over half of all exports.
 Disagreement over these or other issues, therefore,
 could lead to a prolonged stalemate in the talks or
 even their collapse. Below we examine six different
 ways the talks could go and what the likely conse-
 quences would be in each case.
 Scenario 1-An Interim Solution
 The two sides handle the Chinese deadline for the
 talks of September 1984 by issuing an innocuous
 joint statement during that month. A preliminary
 agreement on Hong Kong's future is then concluded
 by mid-1985. Under the agreement, which is only a
 statement of principles, the United Kingdom will
 relinquish sovereignty and administrative control
 over the city in 1997. In the meantime, the United
 Kingdom will retain administrative control, but has
 agreed to turn increasing responsibility over to local
 Chinese. After 1997, local Chinese will administer
 Hong Kong for Beijing with the assistance of some
 expatriate British officials, who will be involved
 25X1
 25X1
 Prospects for Reaching a Resolution
 In our judgment, therefore, the incentives on both
 sides for reaching at least an interim agreement
 within the next year or two are strong. Reaching an
 interim agreement will not be easy, however, and no
 agreement will eliminate the possibility of a serious
 decline in Hong Kong. To come to a settlement,
 London and Beijing will be required to reach some
 basic understandings on Hong Kong's future adminis-
 tration, including the role of British expatriates, and
 guarantees designed to ensure that China honors its
 Guarantees may be particularly hard to work out. The
 Chinese will not accept any conditions that appear to
 infringe on their sovereign rights. Nevertheless, the
 British hope to guarantee a settlement by obtaining
 an informal advisory role in Hong Kong after 1997
 and by influencing the shape of the so-called minicon-
 stitution Beijing has proposed for Hong Kong-to
 ensure that Beijing cannot easily circumvent the city's
 autonomy.'
 ' The British believe that wrapping up a settlement in an interna-
 tionally recognized treaty should be a fundamental guarantee for
 an agreement. Other guarantees the British hope to arrange
 include: an independent judiciary, a locally elected legislature and
 executive, and a substantial British involvement in Hong Kong
 primarily in the financial and legal sectors.
 This accord guarantees the right of Hong Kong
 citizens to travel abroad and to maintain their exist-
 ing lifestyles. It also stipulates that the Hong Kong
 dollar will remain an independent currency and that
 Hong Kong will retain its independent status in
 international organizations, such as the General
 Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
 Beijing and London announce the establishment of
 working groups of technical experts to negotiate the
 details of a final settlement. Only then will an
 agreement be submitted to the British Parliament for
 ratification.
 Consequences. Such an accord probably would be
 initially welcomed by all sides. It would allow both
 Beijing and London to claim progress toward a satis-
 factory resolution of the problem. Moreover, it would
 buy more time to sort out the most complex and still
 contentious issues-such as the role and authority of
 British expatriates. Prime Minister Thatcher would
 particularly welcome the opportunity to report prog-
 ress to Parliament. An interim agreement-as long as

 it was solid enough-probably would also help calm
 local fears and perhaps even help to stimulate eco-
 nomic recovery in some depressed sectors of the local
 economy such as the real estate market. Probably only
 Taiwan would be strongly critical of the accord.
 Beijing would exploit the accord to increase pressure
 on Taipei to reach its own settlement with Beijing.
 Beijing would herald an agreement as paving the way
 for China's ultimate recovery of Hong Kong-gloss-
 ing over the remaining difficulties. It would give the
 Chinese an opportunity to capitalize on the initial
 positive reaction in Hong Kong to win over at least
 some residents still skeptical of China's promises.
 Beijing in fact has already begun soliciting the views
 of some of its staunchest critics in the colony. The US
 Consulate in Hong Kong reports, for example, that
 Beijing has retained a pro-British law firm to draw up
 a draft miniconstitution.
 Chinese leaders would also try to use the accord to
 demonstrate to Taiwan how reasonable Beijing could
 be in reunification talks. Although the government in
 Taipei probably would remain skeptical and unre-
 sponsive, we believe the Chinese approach to further
 talks with London probably would continue to be
 influenced by their desire to entice Taipei into a
 dialogue.
 British leaders of course would be relieved to have
 avoided serious strains in Sino-British relations and
 calamity in Hong Kong. Having conceded sovereignty
 and administrative control in principle, they also
 would hope to influence the Chinese to handle the
 remaining negotiations-even on the most difficult
 and contentious issues-with a minimum of acrimony
 to avoid the unsettling effect the earlier talks had had
 on the economy and security climate in Hong Kong.
 We believe London would still be able to exert some
 leverage because of its ability to grant legitimacy to a
 transfer of authority, instill confidence in a final
 settlement, and cooperate with the Chinese during the
 transition.
 that clarified their future. With most residents al-
 ready resigned to a Chinese takeover, they would view
 the agreement as the best solution for a bad situation.
 Much of their sense of relief would be based on the
 continued British presence, which many in the city
 view as necessary to prevent Beijing from meddling in
 Hong Kong's affairs.
 Some residents of Hong Kong would also welcome the
 opportunity to play a larger role in government.
 Under this type of agreement, the British would
 accelerate the promotion of local Chinese-presum-
 ably favorably disposed to the United Kingdom-into
 more senior positions. Pressures for greater democra-
 cy could also result in the introduction of elections for
 some seats on Hong Kong's Legislative and Executive
 Councils (the Governor now appoints all members).
 The increased certainty about Hong Kong's future
 status probably would benefit the local economy, thus
 serving both Chinese and British economic interests.
 It might boost private investment in the colony,
 earlier depressed by the world recession and uncer-
 tainty over the negotiations. The local stock market
 index might significantly improve, at least initially-
 but both the Hong Kong dollar and the stock market
 would remain subject to Hong Kong's traditionally
 volatile business cycles. An interim agreement could
 also somewhat improve Hong Kong's shaky real estate
 market, particularly if it explained how property
 leases extending beyond 1997 would be handled. F_
 Still, some of the approximately 300,000 Hong Kong
 residents who currently hold foreign passports or visas
 would choose to emigrate, mainly to the United
 States, Canada, Australia, or the United Kingdom.
 Because the United States allows only 600 Hong
 Kong residents a year to immigrate, there is already a
 backlog of some 18,000 residents holding US immi-
 grant visas
 US commercial interests would benefit from the
 improved economic climate. US firms could play a
 role in large projects the British or Chinese would be
 We believe that the initial local reaction in Hong
 Kong to such an interim agreement would be largely
 favorable. The people of Hong Kong probably would
 feel somewhat relieved that progress had been made

 undertaking, such as the Daya nuclear plant or
 possibly infrastructure improvements, such as a new
 airport. The colony's close trading relationship with
 the United States would be largely unaffected. F_
 Scenario 2-The Talks Drag On
 The Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's future enter
 their fourth year without reaching an agreement. The
 British still refuse to concede sovereignty formally
 until they reach a satisfactory agreement on Hong
 Kong's administration both before and after 1997. In
 September 1984 the Chinese make a unilateral state-
 ment on Hong Kong's future, delaying the establish-
 ment of working groups that are only now beginning
 to address such matters as the structure of Hong
 Kong's administrative and legal systems. Both sides
 decide to seek a comprehensive settlement rather
 than an interim agreement. To prevent economic
 problems from getting out of hand in the colony, both
 sides pledge to help stabilize the colony's economy.
 Capital investments are still down and the property
 market remains weak. Only the export industries are
 doing well.
 Consequences. We believe Hong Kong's economic
 problems would slowly worsen if the talks dragged on:
 ? Investment would decline, causing a net capital
 outflow. Hong Kong's Financial Secretary, John
 Bremridge, recently expressed concern over the
 impact the present decline in investment could have
 over the longer run, if not reversed in the next year.
 ? Major banks or corporate failures, such as last
 year's collapse of the Carrian conglomerate, could
 increase.
 ? The local property market would remain stagnant.
 ? A speculative run on the Hong Kong dollar could
 easily occur. This would be accelerated by traders,
 investors, and ordinary residents switching their
 accounts into US dollars and transferring some of
 their funds abroad. Both Beijing and London would
 incur financial losses.
 ? Emigration would pick up. More families would try
 to get one member abroad to arrange the emigration
 of the rest if the situation deteriorated. Hong Kong
 residents probably would lobby the United States to
 Unable to reach an agreement with London, Beijing
 probably would accelerate its efforts in the colony to
 promote its plan and increase its influence. Beijing's
 press outlets would probably issue a steady stream of
 propaganda that contrasted China's conciliatory ap-
 proach with Britain's rigidity. China would certainly
 invite more influential locals to Beijing to express
 their views. The Chinese might also offer financial
 support to troubled companies. If too heavyhanded,
 these actions could further sour the atmosphere in
 Hong Kong and harm the economy.
 The British would find Hong Kong an increasingly
 difficult problem to handle if the talks continued on
 without an agreement. We believe Prime Minister
 Thatcher would attempt to refrain from publicly
 rebuking Chinese pronouncements on Hong Kong's
 future. But if Beijing's comments became too trouble-
 some, Thatcher and other British officials might be
 provoked into responding in Parliament or the press,
 which could damage UK-Chinese relations and cause
 concern in Hong Kong.
 Prolonged talks would expose Thatcher to greater
 domestic pressure to get the talks moving in order to
 reassure both Hong Kong's citizens and the financial
 community. Much of this pressure would come from a
 minority of members of Parliament in both the Con-
 servative and Labor Parties who take an active inter-
 est in Hong Kong affairs or who favor close ties with
 Beijing. Moderates would press the government to
 make concessions to Beijing. Others (notably the Tory
 right, Thatcher's base of support) would call on the
 Prime Minister to adopt an unyielding stance as the
 only way to tie down Beijing and make the Chinese
 "see reason."
 Within Hong Kong, political ferment would increase.
 Local pressure groups such as the Hong Kong Observ-
 ers or Meeting Point (small groups made up mainly of
 professionals) would grow as they tried to promote
 and protect their interests. These groups are trying to
 promote a public debate over Hong Kong's future.
 Differences within Hong Kong's Executive and Legis-
 lative Councils could also complicate the British
 position. Both councils are made up of British and
 allow more immigration.

 local members appointed by the Governor. The Exec-
 utive Council (which includes the colony's senior
 leaders) has been the only group in the colony formal-
 ly consulted on the talks. The British are already
 worried that several factions in the Executive Council
 will air their differences in public. According to local
 officials, some hardline members of the Council be-
 lieve the British should push the Chinese, and even
 threaten to break off the negotiations, if Beijing
 remains unyielding. Others such as Lydia Dunn, an
 ethnic Chinese member of the Council, have publicly
 called for elections and termed a British presence in
 Hong Kong after 1997 as not essential.
 Scenario 3-The Talks Break Down
 China's unilateral announcement of its plans for
 Hong Kong in the fall of 1984 causes confidence to
 plummet in the colony. By mid-1985 a surface calm
 returns. There is little chance that the unproductive
 Sino-British talks -which broke off in early 1985-
 will resume soon. London is trying to "tough it out"
 by holding firm to its negotiating position. The UK is
 also trying to maintain "business as usual" but has
 imposed greater financial controls to impede capital
 flight. Beijing, meanwhile, is trying to gain the upper
 hand by increasing investments and seeking popular
 support for its miniconstitution.
 Both sides scale back their propaganda war to restore
 calm and help the economy recover. The people of
 Hong Kong learn to live with this uncertainty, al-
 though human and capital flight increase. The prop-
 erty and financial markets also remain weak. F_
 Consequences. A breakdown in the talks would im-
 pose a substantial economic burden on Beijing. In
 addition to having to spend foreign exchange to
 bolster the Hong Kong dollar, Beijing probably would
 feel compelled to invest more in the colony to help
 offset the loss of local and foreign investments caused
 by the growing uncertainty over Hong Kong's future.
 China, in fact, has already begun making such invest-
 ments in order to demonstrate its commitment to
 Hong Kong's future. Last January, China's Ever-
 bright Corporation bought a 1,200-apartment housing
 complex for $128 million '-one of the colony's larger
 real estate transactions in recent years. Beijing's
 China Resources Company recently announced it will
 open a supermarket chain in the colony. The Bank of
 China also is expanding its business in Hong Kong.F_
 The colony's economic problems probably would also
 negatively affect bilateral trade between China and
 Hong Kong, but only to a limited extent. Much of
 China's exports to the colony-which amounted to
 $5.5 billion in 1983-is in foodstuff for the local
 market and goods that Hong Kong reexports. Hong
 Kong, in fact, relies on China for half of its food
 imports. The cutback of Hong Kong investment in the  25X1
 special economic zones would also cause problems for
 Beijing.
 More important, these economic problems probably
 would force Beijing to reexamine its negotiating
 strategy. Fearing a collapse of the Hong Kong econo-
 my, some Chinese leaders might advocate greater
 flexibility. Others, influenced by strong nationalistic
 feelings, however, probably would advocate maintain-
 ing a hard line and perhaps even urge threatening the
 use of force to compel London to accommodate
 Chinese demands.
 An obvious chill would occur in Sino-British relations.
 Under some circumstances, this could affect China's
 relations with some of the Western states including
 the United States. If US firms began pulling out of
 Hong Kong, for example, Beijing might suspect the
 United States of collaborating with the British to
 force Beijing to moderate its negotiating stance.
 Australia and Japan, which have close ties with both
 the United Kingdom and China, would also be placed
 in a difficult position. Not wishing to harm their ties
 with either country or within the colony, these coun-
 tries would probably be reluctant to become involved
 in the dispute. The Japanese have already sidestepped
 a British request to help "educate" the Chinese on the
 importance of maintaining a British link to Hong
 Kong after 1997.

 Secret
 A breakdown in the negotiations might, in our judg-
 ment, also prompt London to seek Washington's help
 in convincing Beijing to seek a compromise. In Janu-
 ary the British asked the United States in effect to
 lobby the Chinese during Premier Zhao Ziyang's visit
 to Washington not to take precipitate action that
 could bring about a collapse in Hong Kong.
 Anxiety in Hong Kong, meanwhile, would cause
 human and capital flight to accelerate. That probably
 would force the British to restrict the amount of funds
 individuals could transfer out of the colony. Exchange
 controls could destroy Hong Kong's prospects for
 remaining the financial center of Asia. The colony has
 prospered because, unlike other Asian markets, Hong
 Kong guarantees the privacy of transactions and
 imposes few restrictions on financial matters.
 Hong Kong's own government would also be placed
 under increasing financial strain. The continued eco-
 nomic problems would reduce the colony's revenue
 base, causing the budget deficit to grow. The govern-
 ment ran a $410 million deficit in 1983 in part because
 of the slumping property market. The British, who
 normally do not allow the colony to run a deficit, have
 already raised local taxes and fees to offset last year's
 losses. The 1983 deficit reduced the colony's reserve
 account from $1.5 billion to $1.1 billion. With such
 limited reserves, the colony cannot afford to run
 further deficits for long.
 A breakdown in the talks would also cause serious
 problems in the local civil service. The colony's
 170,000 civil servants have already been hurt by the
 declining value of the local dollar. Many are worried
 about their pensions, prompting the Hong Kong Gov-
 ernment to deny rumors that it intends to replace
 pensionable employment with short-term contracts.
 Many civil servants probably would seek a special
 exemption from British immigration restrictions. Re-
 cruitment would become more difficult. And the
 British would increasingly have to worry about the
 loyalty of their Chinese employees in sensitive posi-
 tions. The temptation for younger ethnic Chinese
 policemen or employees of the colony's intelligence
 services to switch their loyalties to Beijing is certain to
 grow in any event. The police lost an important
 incentive to remain loyal last year when their efforts
 to obtain assurances that they could immigrate to the
 United Kingdom were rebuffed. China's intelligence
 service could easily exploit such a situation to pene-
 trate the Hong Kong police and intelligence services.
 Scenario 4-The British Cave In
 Beijing places London under intense pressure to
 concede, even making veiled threats of military inter-
 vention. After exhaustive and fruitless efforts at
 compromise, the British Government decides to ac-
 quiesce in China's main demands. Under the agree-
 ment reached in late 1985, the British will gradually
 begin turning over administrative control of Hong
 Kong to local Chinese approved by Beijing. British
 forces will be replaced in 1990 by a locally raised
 militia. China has pledged not to change Hong Kong's
 political or economic systems for 50 years after it
 formally regains sovereignty in 1997.3
 Consequences. British leaders would attempt to mask
 the extent of their surrender. Such a coverup would
 not work for long and would almost certainly badly
 damage the government's credibility. As long as it
 held a comfortable majority in Parliament, the gov-
 ernment would be in no danger of falling, but its
 standing with British voters and its allies would
 suffer.
 ' There is little reason now for London to acquiesce in Chinese
 demands. Indeed, Prime Minister Thatcher would be loath to
 surrender her "Iron Lady" reputation or her party's traditional
 claim as a stalwart defender of British interests abroad. Even a
 leftwing Labor government, unsympathetic to business interests
 and anxious to reduce commitments overseas, would not want to
 face charges of creating a massive refugee problem that Britain
 would be expected to help solve. Moreover, no British Government,
 particularly a Tory one, would willingly expose itself to rightwing
 charges of abandoning commitments to a long-held dependency-
 setting a dangerous precedent for such areas as the Falklands and

 Secret
 Chinese leaders, on the other hand, would presumably
 be delighted by the opportunity to dictate the terms of
 their takeover-especially at first. They almost cer-
 tainly would seek to enlist British cooperation for a
 smooth transition and to help calm local fears. But
 they would also seek to quickly extend their influence
 in the colony by handpicking local Chinese to assume
 administrative responsibility. The head of the Hong
 Kong Xinhua office, as the senior representative of
 China on the scene, would become virtually the de
 facto governor.
 Beijing, however, could easily mishandle the transi-
 tion arrangements. China's lack of sensitivity toward
 the concerns of Hong Kong's residents has periodical-
 ly caused unrest and dissatisfaction in the colony. In
 1982 Beijing's credibility sank after its press outlets
 tried to compare China's ability to manage Hong
 Kong with the "success" of Shanghai. This statement
 provoked a strong reaction among many businessmen
 in the colony who have bitter memories of the Com-
 munist takeover in Shanghai following the 1949 revo-
 lution. The praise Xu Jiatun, Xinhua's chief in the
 colony, gave last August to Hong Kong's Walled City
 during a visit to that slum also evoked strong negative
 emotions over the way China might administer the
 colony. This enclave in Kowloon was exempted from
 British control in the 1898 treaty establishing the
 New Territories and is one of Hong Kong's most run-
 down neighborhoods.
 Even without such indiscretions, human and capital
 flight from the colony would dramatically increase.
 The exodus would include many of Hong Kong's
 professional and business elite. The former chairman
 of Hong Kong's Bar Association predicted last August
 that a majority of the colony's lawyers and judges
 would leave the territory if the independence of the
 judiciary was compromised. The president of Hong
 Kong's Medical Association has also predicted that at
 least 80 percent of the colony's 5,000 doctors would
 try to leave if the outcome of the talks were unfavor-
 able. A poll taken in November indicated that three
 out of 10 young managers in Hong Kong planned to
 emigrate in the next five years.
 The outflow of capital would seriously affect Hong
 Kong's economy. The colony's ability to remain a
 major exporter would be stifled because funds for new
 plants and equipment would dry up. At least several
 of the colony's banks and companies would probably
 fail as a result. More firms would either begin to leave
 the colony or diversify their interests abroad. Inflation
 and unemployment probably would rise quickly, mak-
 ing the colony more susceptible to social unrest.F_
 These economic disruptions would have negative con-
 sequences for China. In addition to having to spend
 more on propping up Hong Kong's economy, Beijing's
 substantial entrepot trade through the colony would      25X1
 be harmed by the departure of local businessmen and
 their firms. The departure of much of Hong Kong's
 entrepreneurial class would also seriously affect Chi-
 na's foreign investment program. The four special
 economic zones in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces
 rely heavily on Hong Kong investors.
 The United States and other countries would both
 benefit and suffer as a result of the flight. To the
 extent that capital and Hong Kong's elite seek refuge
 in these countries, they would be welcomed. Taiwan,
 Singapore, and Thailand have already revised their
 laws to encourage capital from Hong Kong to flow
 into their countries. Singapore especially would bene-
 fit if international corporations moved their regional
 headquarters from Hong Kong. On the negative side,
 US, Japanese, and other foreign companies with
 substantial investments in Hong Kong would suffer
 losses. Even though few US firms have large fixed        25X1
 assets in the colony, the collapse of several major local
 companies or banks could certainly harm the interests
 of several large US banks operating in the colony.
 A British cave-in would almost certainly reinforce
 Taiwan's recalcitrance toward Beijing's reunification
 efforts. Taiwan could easily point to the economic and
 social problems in the colony resulting from an antici-
 pated Chinese takeover. Taiwanese investors could
 begin pulling out their relatively modest investments
 in the colony, estimated to be worth $14 million.
 Taipei would probably welcome Hong Kong investors
 and professionals who wish to resettle on the island,
 but would be reluctant to accept a larger exodus of       25X1
 Hong Kong residents.

 Secret
 Scenario 5-The British Walk Out
 China's leadership becomes more leftist, and its
 demands for British concessions increase. Simulta-
 neously, the Chinese press the people of Hong Kong to
 work with them in drawing up a miniconstitution as
 the basis for the self-administered, special adminis-
 trative region. The Chinese are also expanding the
 number of their own personnel in Hong Kong. As a
 result, the British believe the Chinese are no longer
 bargaining in good faith and are only going through
 the motions while they prepare to take over on their
 own terms perhaps even before 1997. Given their
 difficult position, the British have decided that the
 only way they can gain any leverage with the Chinese
 is to declare their intention to pull out of Hong Kong
 unilaterally within two years. The Prime Minister
 believes that even if this ploy does not force the
 Chinese to be more cooperative, it is better to pull out
 than preside over China's takeover. After the British
 announce their plan in November 1985 to begin a
 phased withdrawal, the Chinese rebuke the British
 publicly for their unwillingness to work with China.
 The Chinese, however, privately ask the British to
 extend their withdrawal period to provide a smooth
 transition.
 Consequences. Such a high-stakes gamble could easily
 boomerang on all concerned. Unless the Chinese
 quickly softened their negotiating demands and the
 British agreed to resume negotiations, London's an-
 nounced plans to withdraw would probably set off the
 kind of public panic in Hong Kong both London and
 Beijing have sought to avoid.
 For London, such a ploy would risk:
 ? Precipitating a massive exodus of refugees that the
 British public and Hong Kong's neighbors would
 not welcome.
 ? Damaging Britain's economic interests both in
 Hong Kong and with China.
 ? Provoking strong attacks from the right wing of the
 Conservative Party as ill conceived. Many conserva-
 tives recall the disastrous effects similar tactics had
 in 1947 when the Attlee government tried to force
 the pace of Indian intercommunal negotiations by
 publicly announcing its intention to end British rule
 in a short period. The subsequent violence and
 partition of the subcontinent make this a precedent
 few British politicians want to repeat.
 ? Damaging Britain's prestige.
 ? Destroying London's bargaining position with
 Beijing.
 ? Humiliation if Beijing called London's bluff.
 Beijing would be ill prepared to take over Hong Kong
 in so short a time, even with British cooperation. Its
 most difficult challenge would be reassuring the local
 population and maintaining Hong Kong security.
 Many Hong Kong residents fled from Chinese Com-
 munist rule or are the children of such refugees.
 Because most have few attractive alternatives, the
 resulting frustrations could spark sporadic violence,
 especially against foreigners. To ease this tension,
 Beijing would probably reiterate its previous public
 promise to allow Hong Kong's residents to travel
 abroad and even emigrate.
 The absence of a lengthy transition period would
 cause unique administrative problems for Beijing:
 ? It would have to replace many of the departing
 expatriate and local administrators with inexperi-
 enced officials. Beijing probably recognizes that
 bringing in too many personnel from China would
 increase local concerns.
 ? A new organic law for Hong Kong would have to be
 drafted using local help, due to China's limited legal
 expertise.
 ? Hong Kong's existing treaties and membership in
 international organizations would have to be renego-
 tiated quickly, including the city's vital textile
 agreements.
 Human and capital flight again would create a famil-
 iar litany of economic problems that would also affect
 China's own economy, causing a drain on Beijing
 reserves and the loss of valuable investment capital
 and Hong Kong business expertise.

 Secret
 Scenario 6-Hong Kong Collapses
 After the talks break off in January 1985, the
 atmosphere in Hong Kong begins to worsen. Beijing
 intensifies its media campaign to win popular support
 and to intimidate the British provoking a serious
 economic crisis. After the Hong Kong dollar drops
 below the 20-to-1 US dollar rate and the stock
 market collapses, panic sets in and capital and
 human flight accelerates to record proportions in
 March. The rioting that then breaks out forces the
 British to.fly in reinforcements to restore order.
 Beijing threatens to send in troops but does not do so.
 If further anarchy occurs in Hong Kong, however,
 Chinese troops will probably enter the city "to assist"
 the British in ending the violence.
 Consequences. The outbreak of widespread disorders
 would be a disaster for all concerned. In the short run,
 we think the Thatcher government would oppose
 Chinese intervention and could count on the full
 support of Parliament and the British public for
 whatever steps it chose to take to restore order. Once
 order was restored, however, the government probably
 would face an official inquest and tough questioning
 in Parliament about its handling of negotiations.
 Government critics probably would be particularly
 unhappy over the high costs of restoring stability. Not
 only would London have to bear the burden of
 maintaining expeditionary forces in Hong Kong, but
 it probably would have to provide emergency funds to
 help keep vital services running. The British have
 admitted they have contingency plans to use the
 resources of the Bank of England to keep the Hong
 Kong economy from collapse in just such an emergen-
 cy. London now contributes only about $50 million
 annually to help pay a quarter of the costs of station-
 ing 12,000 troops in the colony, including a regiment
 of Scots Guards and four battalions of Gurkhas. Hong
 Kong's 23,000-member police force and other public
 services in the colony are paid for out of local
 revenues.
 To help restore public confidence in Hong Kong, the
 British probably would appeal to other states for
 economic, humanitarian, and diplomatic assistance.
 London probably would prevail on Washington, in
 particular, to try to induce Beijing to adopt a more
 conciliatory posture to facilitate a settlement.

 a Not necessarily indications of instability, but common to most
 economic cycles.
 Indeed, London might try to capitalize on the disor-
 ders to promote a compromise accord with Beijing. To
 prepare public opinion in Hong Kong, British officials
 might praise Chinese restraint during the crisis to try
 to engender confidence in Beijing's promises to re-
 spect Hong Kong's special status. At the same time
 they probably would try to play on Chinese concerns
 over further disorders to press for a speedy conclusion
 to negotiations. Given the costs to the British, we
 believe London would also be inclined to adopt a more
 flexible approach to a settlement.
 We believe the Chinese would be extremely reluctant
 to send in troops during the crisis unless London
 asked, or they concluded the British could not restore
 order on their own. Otherwise, they would fear such a
 move might inflame anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong
 Kong, provoking increased violence, triggering in-
 creased human and capital flight, provoking strong

 Secret
 Western criticism, and giving Taiwan added ammuni-
 tion for rejecting any dialogue with the mainland.
 The Chinese would try to limit the damage to their
 economic interests. But the costs in terms of the loss
 of skilled and professional people, property, and fu-
 ture business prospects would be incalculable. Legal
 and illegal emigration could soar, presenting neigh-
 boring countries and Western states with a humani-
 tarian problem comparable to the Vietnamese "boat
 people." However, the British might try to stem that
 tide to avoid damaging its relations with these coun-
 tries.
 Whether the Chinese would be willing to reassess
 their negotiating strategy and adopt a more flexible
 position is less certain. Calculating the worst was
 already over, they could perceive the British as vul-
 nerable and press harder for the acceptance of their
 terms. They might even blame British intransigence
 for the breakdown in public order.
 If the worst happened and Beijing retook Hong Kong
 militarily, the British would offer little resistance and
 would activate contingency plans already in place to
 quickly exit the colony. Chinese forces would have to
 be considerably beefed up from their current alltime
 low level opposite Hong Kong prior to a takeover.
 According to one report in the Hong Kong press,
 Beijing believes the PLA could take control of Hong
 Kong within nine hours at night and 11 hours during
 the daytime.
