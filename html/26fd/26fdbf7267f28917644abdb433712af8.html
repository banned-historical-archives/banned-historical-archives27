 The Albania-China Rift:
 For Tirana, Few Options
 Central Intelligence Agency
 Directorate of intelligence
 September 1977
 Key Judgments
 The rapid deterioration of Albania's relations with Peking this year for
 the first time raises the possibility of a break between the two formerly
 close allies. Available evidence is insufficient to permit a full explanation for
 the Albanian motivation in provoking such a rupture. There are indications,
 however, that Tirana is trying to devise a strategy to follow should it lose the
 political and material support provided by the Chinese for the past 16 years.
 In view of Albania's strategic geographic location, its future course is of
 deep concern to all of its Mediterranean neighbors. The Soviet Union, which
 was allied with Tirana until 1961, might try to take advantage of a Sino-
 Albanian break to reestablish a political foothold in Albania, but Moscow
 would probably be rebuffed. Should the Soviets be successful, the status quo
 in the Balkans would be upset, and Albania's closest neighbors-Yugoslavia,
 Italy, and Greece-would perceive a serious threat to their security.
 Driven by xenophobia and radical ideological fervor, the Albanian
 leadership has kept the country in relative isolation from the outside world.
 Economically backward, it has for the past 16 years been heavily dependent
 on Chinese help for its industrial development.
 Tirana's apparent efforts to reorient its foreign policy have been accom-
 panied by signs of ferment within the leadership. The massive purges of the
 cultural, military, and economic establishments since 1973 afford ample
 evidence of internal tensions. The Communist "old guard," led by aging
 party boss Enver Hoxha, is holding on to the reins of power, but younger
 functionaries who entered the power structure in the wake of the purges can
 be expected to make their mark on regime policies before long.
 Despite our limited knowledge of developments inside Albania, sonic
 trends appear to be emerging.

 ? Although Sino-Albanian relations have fallen to an unprec-
 edented low, Tirana may still be able to avoid a final break with
 Peking.
 ? Should a break nevertheless occur, the regime would probably
 not shut itself off entirely from the rest of the world.
 ? Rather, Albania is likely to strive gradually to improve its
 relations with a number of countries, including industrialized
 Western states. There is evidence that the regime is already making
 probes in that direction.
 There are obvious limitations to forming such new relationships.
 ? Since the break with Moscow, the Albanians have been obsessed
 with fear of a Soviet threat to their security. Hoxha, who engi-
 neered the split, and the rest of the Albanian leadership are likely
 to remain opposed to reestablishing better relations with Moscow.
 ? There is no evidence that Tirana is interested in a rapproche-
 ment with the US at this time. A policy change might emerge
 gradually, however.
 ? Ideological differences, combined with ethnic and territorial
 tensions, prevent Tirana from normalizing its relations with Yugo-
 slavia-its most natural economic partner. Tito's success in improv-
 ing relations with China has doubtless aroused Albanian suspicions
 of Chinese betrayal and political encirclement, making its opposi-
 tion to Yugoslav "revisionism" even firmer.
 ? Despite Tirana's stepped-up efforts to improve relations with the
 West Europeans, the ideological rigidity of the Hoxha regime
 forecloses much progress. Under no foreseeable conditions would
 the West replace China as a "protector" against threats to Albania's
 security.
 ? Albania hopes it could compensate for the possible loss of
 (-hinese aid by increasing trade with the West. The non-Commu-
 nist world, however, is unlikely to provide enough assistance to
 enable Tirana to maintain its industrial development programs.

 Albania faces a slow and frustrating job in trying to work itself out of
 its exclusive foreign ties with the Chinese. Its alternatives to China's friend-
 ship and protection appear extremely limited.
 Hoxha's departure and the formation of a new, younger leadership-
 when it happens-may open the door to important policy changes, but our
 knowledge of Albanian political and policy forces is too fragmentary even to
 guess at their direction.

 The Albania-China Rift:
 For Tirana, Few Options
 Point of No Return?
 In the late 1960s, cracks began to appear in
 the Sino-Albanian alliance. Until late last year,
 however, disagreements were more or less cov-
 ered up by the regimes' public insistence on
 their "unbreakable friendship."
 Mao Tse-tung's death last October deprived
 the Albanian Communists of their main bene-
 factor. The Albanian leadership realized that the
 emergence of Hua Kuo-feng, a less doctrinaire
 politician, would lead to a more pragmatic polit-
 ical climate in China. The purge of the radical
 members of the Chinese leadership-the "Gang
 of Four"-whom Tirana considered as its ideo-
 logical allies, further upset the Albanians, Tirana
 expressed its dissatisfaction in coolness toward
 Hua and unwillingness to endorse the Chinese
 campaign against the radicals.
 Early this year Tirana began to use certain
 parties of the formerly pro-Peking Marxist-
 Leninist splinter movement as surrogates in its
 polemics against Peking. In response, the Chi-
 nese began to advise some other splinter parties
 of their differences with Albania in an attempt
 to prevent defections to Tirana.

 By midsummer. relations between the two
 regimes had reached an unprecedented low. In
 recent months:
 ? The Albanian press launched fierce attacks
 on the basic tenets of China's foreign policies
 as formulated by Mao.
 ? Tirana recalled military personnel training
 with the Chinese Air Force and began a
 phased withdrawal of Albanian students
 studying in China.
 ? Rumors circulated that the Albanians had
 requested Peking to withdraw its technical
 experts from Albania. Despite denials on both
 sides, evidence is mixed. While some Chinese
 technicians are returning home, allegedly "for
 vacation," others are still arriving in Albania.
 ? Tirana continued to convert Marxist-Lenin-
 ist splinter parties to its ideological line. At
 least one party quoted by the Albanian press
 has acknowledged Tirana as the sole leader of
 the Marxist-Leninist movement.
 ? The Albanians hinted that Chinese foreign
 policy principles might be as damaging to
 world revolution as Eurocommunism.
 As of mid-September, however, neither coun-
 try had engaged in public name-calling. There
 are some indications that the Albanian leader-
 ship may not be united in wanting to provoke a
 final breakdown of the partnership. An Alba-
 nian hint that the regime would be willing to
 hold talks with the Chinese could postpone a
 showdown. Peking has not as yet responded to
 this overture.
 Origins of the Alliance
 Khrushchev's theoretical innovations, as out-
 lined at the 20th Congress of the CPSU in 1956,
 met with adverse reaction in both Tirana and
 Peking. Both regimes were skeptical about the
 feasibility of the "parliamentary road" and
 viewed revolutionary violence as the only effec-
 tive road to revolution. Both considered Khru-
 shchev's policies of "peaceful coexistence" with
 the West opportunistic, and both continued to
 see the US as the main obstacle to achieving a
 worldwide victory for Communism. Addition-
 ally, fearing domestic repercussions, the Alba-
 nian leadership decided not to abandon the Sta-
 linist legacy. Moreover, in the face of Moscow's
 rapprochement with Yugoslavia in the early
 1960s, the Chinese and the Albanians shared an
 unrelenting hostility to Titoist "revisionism."
 As their ideological quarrel with Khrushchev
 mounted, the Albanian leaders increasingly saw
 the Soviet Union as a threat. One result was the
 purge of elements thought to be close to Mos-
 cow, another was reliance on China to protect
 Albania against a potential Soviet threat.
 For the Chinese, Albania's rejection of Mos-
 cow presented the first-and only-opportunity
 to rally a ruling Communist regime in support of
 their policies. Although the alliance with Tirana
 entailed some economic burden, Peking was
 convinced that the price was justified by the
 acquisition of an ally in a region that the Soviet
 Union traditionally regards as its sphere of influ-
 ence-
 The Source and Growth of the Dispute
 Differences between Tirana and Peking,
 mainly over foreign policy issues, first appeared
 in the late I 960s. China's efforts to seek closer
 international ties with an increasingly large num-
 ber of states, including NATO members, trou-
 bled the Albanians, who detected a neglect of
 revolutionary principles and a tendency toward
 opportunism.
 The differences over practical approaches on
 foreign relations were soon reflected in the ideo-
 logical formulations on which foreign policies of
 the two countries were based. Concerned over a
 Soviet military threat, Mao revised his views on
 the status of the two superpowers-the US and
 the Soviet Union. He concluded that despite the
 continuing war in Southeast Asia, the US pre-
 sented a lesser danger to China's security than
 the Soviet Union.
 The resulting rapprochement between Peking
 and Washington was condemned by the Alba-
 nian leadership, which held that it is not permis-
 sable to "lean on one imperialism to oppose the

 oft
 other." Tirana continued to equate the danger
 posed by the two superpowers and claimed that
 "collusion" existed between Moscow and Wash-
 ington at the expense of the Communist move-
 ment. The Chinese, on the other hand, main-
 tained that fundamental conflicts between the
 US and the Soviet Union would undermine pros-
 pects for lasting cooperation.
 During the 1960s and early 1970s, Albania
 was heavily dependent on Chinese economic as-
 sistance. Since 1961 this has totaled between
 $600 million and $900 million.' By 1975, how-
 1In 1970, imports accounted for more than one-fifth of Alba-
 nia's GNP. Albania must purchase abroad virtually all the ma-
 chinery and equipment, structural steel, chemical fertilizer, and
 coke indispensible for industrial development. China has pro-
 vided more than half of all imports, either directly or through
 purchases from West and East European countries. The Chinese
 have also made periodic wheat purchases abroad for Albania.
 mmun i st
 ever, signs of a reduction in Chinese economic
 and military assistance to Albania appeared.
 There is no clear evidence, however, that the
 decline-in the form of delays in the flow of
 materiel--was a conscious Chinese attempt to
 blackmail the Albanian leadership. But the latter
 probably viewed the decline as a confirmation
 of its suspicions about Peking's "opportunism."
 Despite underlying ideological differences, on
 the surface Albanian-Chinese relations remained
 cordial until the death of Mao Tse-tung. One
 month after Mao's demise, Enver Hoxha, in a
 widely publicized report to the Albanian Party
 Congress, gave a comprehensive account of Ti-
 rana's opposition to Chinese foreign policy posi-
 tions and Peking's attitudes toward the Marxist-
 Leninist splinter movement. The report did not

 directly attack China, but reiterated Albania's
 opposition to China's rapprochement with the
 West and projected the Albanian positions as
 more revolutionary than Peking's. Conspicu-
 ously absent were references to Albania's moral
 and material debt to Peking and praise for the
 new Chinese leadership.
 The extent of the decline in Albania's rela-
 tions with Peking became publicly known only
 last July, when Albanian media published a
 hitter attack on the theory of the "three
 worlds," which has been the basis of China's
 foreign policy since the late 1960s. Tirana de-
 nounced the theory as anti-Marxist and charged
 that it undermined the revolutionary enthusiasm
 of the world proletariat. Since the theory had
 been formulated under the guidance of Mao
 Tse-tung, the attack was a clear break with Ti-
 rana's longstanding recognition of Mao as the
 paramount figure of contemporary Marxism-
 Leninism, the equal of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and
 Stalin.
 A month after the first open attack, Albanian
 media began to hint at Chinese collusion with
 Eurocommunism. The Albanians charged that
 the theory of the "three worlds" was similar to
 Eurocommunist concepts in that it served to
 confuse the proletariat and divert it from the
 class struggle, thus contradicting the theory and
 practice of revolution and the teachings of
 Marxism-Leninism.
 left mainly to members of the radical faction in
 the Chinese leadership.
 In contrast, the Albanians continued to re-
 gard the splinter parties as important allies. By
 the mid-1970s, Tirana began to play an active
 role in providing organizational and ideological
 guidance to such groups, particularly those in
 Latin America and Western Europe. It sought,
 successfully, to become the spiritual center of
 the Marxist-Leninist movement, the position
 earlier occupied by Peking.
 Tirana's involvement with the splinter parties
 has further intensified this year. The Albanians
 have used Marxist-Leninist groupings as surro-
 gates in publicizing their opposition to China's
 foreign policies and were successful in splitting
 some of these parties. Sonic splinter parties re-
 cently acknowledged the Albanian party as the
 sole leader of Marxism-Leninism and rejected
 Chinese policies that were not in accord with
 Marxist-Leninist principles.
 Early this year the Chinese leaders became
 increasingly aware of the challenge. The Chinese
 explained their policies to selected splinter par-
 ties and termed the Albanian line erroneous.
 Peking now appears to be actively cultivating
 those splinter parties still loyal to it and is
 countering Tirana's activity by setting up new
 groups with direct financial assistance from
 China.
 Split in the Marxist-Leninist Movement
 Even before Mao's death, relations between
 Tirana and Peking had been impaired by con-
 flicting evaluations of the importance of the
 Marxist-Leninist splinter parties. In the early
 1960s, the existence of these parties was sym-
 bolic of Peking's success in splitting the previ-
 ously cohesive pro-Soviet Communist move-
 ment. After the Cultural Revolution, the decline
 in China's ideological fervor and Chinese efforts
 to establish ties with West European govern-
 ments lessened the importance of the Marxist-
 Leninist movement for Peking. Contacts with
 foreign Marxist-Leninists during this period were
 Motivations
 Why Albania decided to challenge Peking can-
 not be conclusively determined from available
 evidence. The Albanian actions appear less than
 prudent, in that their campaign could lead to a
 complete loss of Chinese economic assistance.
 While there appears to be no single, overriding
 motive, the following factors probably con-
 tributed to the decision.
 ? Albania's fierce sense of independence re-
 jects submission to or interference by any
 foreign power, even a close ally such as China

 their domestic affairs. Earlier this year Tirana
 came close to hinting at Chinese complicity
 with the "antiparty" elements who were
 purged in recent years.
 ? Albania may be acutely frustrated by the
 realization that its importance to China as an
 ally has been reduced. The improvement in
 recent years of China's relations with Yugo-
 slavia-whose revisionism is an anathema to
 the Albanian regime-has no doubt exacer-
 bated Tirana's frustration.
 ? The Albanians set great store in their pur-
 suit of a "principled" foreign policy in the
 face of what the Albanians consider China's
 "opportunistic" approaches to the West and
 particularly the US.
 ? Albania is reacting to economic difficulties
 caused by the delays in Chinese assistance,
 which the Albanians associated with China's
 political opportunism.
 ? Ideological messianism prompts the regime
 to challenge China as the leader of the Marx-
 ist-Leninist splinter movement. They thus
 seek to replace the "adulterated" ideology of
 the Chinese leadership with Tirana's "cor-
 rect" Marxist-Leninist line.
 Explanations for the Chinese motivations for
 tolerating the Albanian challenge are equally
 tentative.
 ? Since the early 1970s, Albania has lost its
 importance for China as its sole ally and ideo-
 logical supporter. The Chinese probably feel
 that the present relatively low cost of assist-
 ing Albania is compensated for by the politi-
 cal advantage of retaining their limited pres-
 ence there which also provides a deterrent to
 Soviet reentry.
 ? Albanian criticism of China's foreign poli-
 cies cannot distract from the overall advan-
 tages of China's pragmatic foreign policy line.
 ? In view of China's extensive contacts with
 other governments, Peking considers support
 from the basically weak and ineffectual Marx-
 SECRET
 ist-Leninist parties as less than essential. But
 since the Chinese also consider it necessary to
 portray the image of orthodoxy, Peking is
 embarrassed by the Albanian charges of polit-
 ical "opportunism." With its superior finan-
 cial resources, China has been able, in some
 cases, to outmaneuver Albanian efforts to
 split the Marxist-Leninist splinter movement
 and is already setting up surrogate puppet
 parties to advocate its policies.
 e Having feigned aloofness from the Albanian
 challenge, the Chinese have retained the op-
 tion of striking back whenever it should ap-
 pear convenient. Peking's initial response to
 Tirana is likely to be indirect, essentially a
 warning.
 Internal Albanian Upheaval
 Despite the appearance of political stability
 and totality of dictatorship, there is evidence of
 ferment within the Albanian leadership. In the
 past four years a large number of high- and
 middle-level officials, including Politburo mem-
 bers, were ousted on trumped-up charges. The
 purges, which were carried out in three phases,
 have decimated the cultural, military, and eco-
 nomic establishment.
 The full meaning of these purges is obscure,
 but they seemed to have involved the existence
 of high-level dissatisfaction with Hoxha's poli-
 cies and concern over Albania's economic diffi-
 culties which have been aggravated by the de-
 cline in Chinese assistance. Recently there have
 been indications that Tirana may be considering
 further purges. This time the victims could be
 openly identified as elements supporting the di-
 visive line.
 The party leadership is aging. Moreover,
 Hoxha's health and authority appear to have
 declined in recent months. The leadership may
 be under pressure from younger persons-still
 unknown quantities to the West-who entered
 the highest party echelons in the wake of the
 purges. While a substantial impact on policy
 may not come soon, this new generation of
 leaders is already making its mark on the politi-
 cal scene.

 Phase One: Cultural Purge
 Despite its consistent efforts, the Albanian
 leadership has not been able to seal off the
 country completely from foreign influences.
 The few instances of relaxation of barriers to
 outside contacts only prompted an influx of
 more liberal trends and the regime quickly drew
 back. The most recent such "opening," which
 occurred in the early 1970s, involved: a party
 campaign to eliminate backward social concepts
 that in the end encouraged tendencies favoring
 change and liberalism; the climate of detente
 and accompanying relaxation between the US
 and the Communist nations: China's decreasing
 hostility toward the West and particularly its
 opening to the US in 1972; and the introduction
 of television in Albania. This latter develop-
 nme n t-particularly the Yugoslav and Greek
 transmissions-allowed some Albanians to cir-
 cumvent official censorship and acquaint them-
 selves with foreign cultural trends.
 The party's ability to quickly close this open-
 ing and restore cultural and ideological ortho-
 doxy, however, proved that the totalitarian na-
 ture of the regime had not been significantly
 weakened by the temporary impact of outside
 influences. The first phase of the purges, in
 1973, targeted on those held responsible for

 "incorrect" cultural policies. Leading function-
 aries in the Tirana party organization, the state
 radio and television network, and the youth
 organization, were ousted. The entire leadership
 of the Albanian Writers and Artists Union was
 also replaced. Rigid cultural and ideological or-
 thodoxy has been maintained ever since.
 Phase Two: Military Purge
 In 1974 the regime thoroughly purged the
 military establishment. Since Albania's break
 with the Soviet Union, its defense capability had
 been dependent on Chinese supplies of military
 equipment. Fluctuations in the flow of military
 assistance in the early 1970s-including no de-
 liveries at all in 1973-probably caused uneasi-
 ness within the Albanian military establishment
 about their ability to resist aggression. The So-
 viet Union's success early in 1974 in securing
 limited naval repair facilities in Yugoslavia-at
 Tivat, some 80 kilometers north of the Albanian
 border-probably reinforced doubts within the
 defense establishment about the adequacy of
 Albania's defense structure.
 The real reason behind the purge of Defense
 Minister Balluku and his close associates in 1974
 is unclear. Charges against them, including trea-
 son and collaboration with Moscow, are not
 convincing. Balluku's close ties with the Chinese
 military leadership make it unlikely that he had
 sought to replace Chinese assistance with Soviet
 weapons. It is possible, however, that Balluku
 and other military leaders had recommended the
 broadening of economic and political ties with
 the West along the lines then being followed by
 Peking. Such a proposal, coming from the mili-
 tary, could have been interpreted by party chief
 Hoxha as an attempt to undermine the party's
 control over the military.
 Phase Three: Economic Purge
 The third and most extensive phase of the
 purges hit the economic establishment. It ap-
 pears to have been directly related to the diffi-
 culties experienced by the economy during the
 fifth Five Year Plan (FYP) period (1971-75).
 Despite large Chinese contributions in the
 form of complete plants and equipment, during
 the fifth FYP the country's economic growth
 declined. The real extent of the decline is not
 known to us, but the main indexes of economic
 development for the fifth FYP period show gen-
 erally lower percentages than those for the pre-
 vious FYP period (1.966-70). (See table). The
 delays in Chinese deliveries probably contrib-
 uted to the drop in economic growth.'
 'Among the largest projects the Chinese contracted are the iron
 and steel complex in Elbasan, two oil refineries, a chrome ore
 processing plant, a nitrogen fertilizer plant, a superphosphate
 plant, and a number of hydroelectric plants. Last June, the
 Albanians publicly blamed delays in the construction of the
 Elbasan complex and the oil refinery in Ballsh on the failure of
 "outside" sources to deliver machinery and materials.

 The full impact of the reduced assistance
 probably became clear to Tirana's economic
 planners toward the end of the plan period. It
 may have prompted some members of the lead-
 ership to advocate countermeasures, such as less-
 ening Albania's economic isolation from the rest
 of Europe. Possibly alarmed by the political
 repercussions of those initiatives, the Hoxha ad-
 ministration launched a widespread purge of the
 Albanian economic establishment in 1975.
 Hoxha and the Party Leadership
 The purges had initially seemed to strengthen
 the hands of the Party's "old guard" that was
 loosely associated with First Secretary Enver
 Hoxha. Now in his 69th year, Hoxha has been
 the acknowledged head of the party since it was
 founded in 1941. His control of the state and
 party apparatus was secured by subsequent
 purges of political opponents of all hues. The
 hardcore element of the leadership still forms
 the majority of the 12-member Politburo.
 There are indications, however, that in recent
 months Hoxha has encountered some opposi-
 tion within the leadership and his position may
 have weakened. Debate within the highest eche-
 lons of the party over economic priorities and
 consequent alternate courses is apparently con-
 tinuing. The new Albanian constitution, pub-
 lished in December 1976, revealed differences
 over the relative value of Chinese assistance and
 of self-reliance. One faction had apparently
 managed to incorporate its views on the impor-
 tance of self-reliance as the primary force in
 socialist construction without a corresponding
 reference to Chinese assistance. Iloxha, for his
 part, continued to cite the importance of "self-
 less" Chinese aid, implying his disagreement
 with those advocating sole reliance on the coun-
 try's meager resources.
 Hoxha's economic views-which show him as
 more of a realist than some of his colleagues-
 stand in sharp contradiction to his image as the
 challenger to the Chinese over the issue of ideo-
 logical orthodoxy. In any case, the divided eco-
 nomic views raise the question whether tite
 party leader. known to be in failing health,
 retains lull control mcr the regime.
 Enver Hoxha and Mehmet Shehu in 1976 photo.
 The "old guard," although still active, has
 become just that-old. Premier Mehmet Shehu,
 who has been generally considered Hoxha's
 chosen successor, is 64. His power was bolstered
 when he assumed the post of Defense Minister
 in 1974. Shehu, however, also has medical prob-
 lems that would appear to disqualify him from
 replacing Iloxha.
 We have little information on the younger
 functionaries who now occupy leading positions
 in the state and government apparatus. The Po-
 litburo has two new younger persons and there
 are quite a few on the Central Committee.3
 They were probably handpicked by Hoxha on
 the basis of their performance and personal loy-
 alt~. While their backgrounds are obscure, one
 common denominator seems to be a shared ex-
 perience in the provincial party apparatus.

 Despite the introduction of new people into
 the highest levels of the party and government,
 there has been no visible progress in solving the
 country's economic problems. Moreover, the es-
 calating differences with China could have a
 destabilizing effect on officialdom. Having
 started their political careers in an era character-
 ized by Albania's strong reliance on China, some
 of the younger leaders may be concerned about
 the consequences of provoking the Chinese. Un-
 like the "old guard," these leaders may also be
 less willing to make economic sacrifices for the
 sake of ideological orthodoxy.
 As long as Hoxha formally heads the party,
 Albania's political course is likely to reflect the
 ideological radicalism that has characterized it
 for two decades. We cannot exclude the possi-
 bility, however, that once he departs, more prag-
 matic policies will be pursued.
 Foreign Policy Options
 With their relations with Peking deteriorating,
 the Albanians have been forced to consider their
 future foreign policy options. These are limited.
 The leadership's obsession with a Soviet threat
 to its security and its fierce anti-Americanism
 constrain its turning to either superpower for
 political or economic support. Neighboring Yu-
 goslavia, which would be a natural economic
 partner, is ideologically unacceptable to the Al-
 banians, and the Yugoslavs are wary of the
 Albanian minority and influence in their poorest
 border province of Kosovo. Recent efforts to
 improve relations with certain West European
 countries suggest that Tirana is seeking political
 support against the Soviets. The regime's dog-
 matic opposition to democratic systems, how-
 ever, is likely to prevent the development of
 closer political relations. Albania's inability to
 substantially increase its exports to industrial-
 ized countries or to accept Western credits is
 bound to prevent it from replacing the role
 China played as an economic partner.
 Fear of Soviet Intervention
 Since the break with Khrushchev, the Alba-
 nians have consistently viewed the Soviet Union
 as a threat to their security. Despite recurring
 purges-which probably eliminated all elements
 sympathetic to Moscow-Tirana still insists the
 Soviets want to reestablish hegemony in Al-
 bania. The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia,
 which demonstrated Moscow's willingness to in-
 tervene militarily in East Europe, came as a
 further shock to the Albanian leadership. Tirana
 renounced Warsaw Pact membership4 and prob-
 ably also ordered a thorough reevaluation of
 Albania's strategic planning. In addition to seek-
 ing more military aid from the Chinese, the
 Albanians made some attempt to reduce their
 isolation from Balkan neighbors, including Yu-
 goslavia, and explored  contacts in Western
 Europe.
 Having personally engineered Albania's break
 with Moscow and the Albanian alliance with
 China, Hoxha has been fearful that the Soviets
 might attempt to overthrow him. The regime's
 longstanding anti-Soviet propaganda campaign is
 aimed at instilling a permanent hatred of Soviet
 "social imperialism." Although there is no evi-
 dence of any substantial Soviet attempt to un-
 dermine Hoxha, internal opponents have almost
 invariably been accused of being pro-Moscow or,
 in the case of former Defense Minister Balluku,
 of joining the Soviets in a conspiracy against the
 regime.
 Although it has diplomatic relations with all
 the East European states, Albania has since
 1961 steadfastly refused to reestablish contacts
 with the Soviet Union.' It has also invariably
 rejected frequent offers by the Brezhnev leader-
 ship to improve relations. A recent Romanian
 attempt to mediate-possibly encouraged by the
 Soviets-was also turned down by the Albanians.
 4This was a symbolic gesture as Albania had not participated in
 the Pact since the late 1950s.
 5Tirana's relations with Moscow's East European allies, although
 correct, remain low key throughout this period. Romania's
 strained relationship with the Soviet Union and friendship with
 Peking helped create better relations between Tirana and Bucha-
 rest, including exchanges of delegations and occasional party
 contacts. There is evidence that in recent years Moscow tried-
 unsuccessfully-to use the Romanians as mediators in its dispute
 with Albania. Albania has maintained a modest level of trade
 exchanges with Warsaw Pact countries but none with the Soviet
 Union. Although its exports to East European countries rose by
 55  percent  between  1971  and  1975, they grew much more
 slowly in real terms.

 Tirana uses its defiance of Moscow's "revision-
 istic" foreign policies to demonstrate the cor-
 rectness of its own ideological stance. Ironically,
 in their polemics with Peking the Albanians have
 hinted that the Chinese have been following
 policies similar to those of the Soviets in the
 1960s.
 We do not expect Albania to begin a rap-
 prochement with Moscow as long as Iioxha re-
 mains in power. After his departure there may
 be an easing in hostility toward the Soviets, but
 Hoxha's heirs will still probably view Moscow as
 a lasting threat to Albania's independence.
 Yugoslavia
 Hoxha bears a personal antipathy toward Tito
 that originated in the Yugoslav leader's support
 for one of Hoxha's rivals during the immediate
 postwar period when Yugoslav influence with
 the new Albanian Communist Party was para-
 mount. Belgrade's plans to annex Albania were
 thwarted only because of the Soviet-Yugoslav
 split of 1948, and Albanian paranoia about pos-
 sible renewed Yugoslav intervention has per-
 sisted. The large Albanian minority in Yugosla-
 via's bordering Kosovo Province and Tirana's
 periodic interventions on its behalf also trouble
 Albanian-Yugoslav relations-the more so be-
 cause Kosovo's poverty and political restiveness
 make the region a drain on and a vulnerability in
 the Yugoslav federation.
 The antipathy is also ideological. Ever since
 the 1948 Cominform resolution excommuni-
 cated Yugoslavia from the Communist camp,
 Albania's opposition to Yugoslav "revisionism"
 has not wavered. The Khrushchev rapproche-
 ment in the mid-1950s and subsequent periods
 of improvement in Soviet-Yugoslav relations
 aroused suspicions of encirclement. The com-
 mitment against "revisionism" mitigated against
 a full normalization of relations with Belgrade
 despite Albania's and Yugoslavia's mutual con-
 demnation of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslo-
 vakia.
 The  Albanian  leadership's opposition  to
 Yugoslav "revisionism" can also be explained
 partly in terms of Tirana's relations with the
 Marxist-Leninist splinter parties. In challenging
 Peking as the sponsor of the Marxist-Leninist
 movement, Tirana presents itself as the sole re-
 maining defender of "correct" Communist
 dogma. As long as Iloxha remains in power,
 ideological considerations alone will probably
 block normalization of Yugoslav-Albanian rela-
 tions.
 The Albanians probably believe that Tito's
 current visit to China will formalize Sino-Yugo-
 slav rapprochement, and Tirana will no doubt
 increase its anti-Peking polemics as well as nour-
 ish this additional reason to mistrust Belgrade.
 Albania's unrelenting hostility to the Yugosla-
 vian form of Communism is ironic since non-
 aligned Yugoslavia has long provided a buffer
 between Albania and the Warsaw Pact nations.
 In addition, Belgrade's ideological differences
 with Moscow have curtailed the emergence of
 pro-Soviet forces in Yugoslavia that could pre-
 sent a threat to Albania.
 Even though the Albanians revile Tito, Tirana
 must be disturbed by the thought of his even-
 tual demise. Tirana would view any increase in
 Soviet influence in Yugoslavia during the post-
 Tito era as endangering Albania's security. More-
 over,  possible Yugoslav apprehension over
 heightened Albanian irredentism in Kosovo Pro-
 vince after Tito's departure-a likely accom-
 paniment of any post-Tito strains in Yugoslav
 federalism-could pose a serious problem for
 Tirana.
 The ideological rigidity of the Albanian party
 has also inhibited economic contacts between
 the two countries. Although bilateral trade
 showed a sixfold increase between 1970 and
 1975, it has not reached its full potential. For
 example, a planned railroad line, connecting the
 Yugoslav rail system with the main Albanian
 line, was not completed because of the uncer-
 tain political climate. There have been no new
 Albanian initiatives toward Belgrade in recent
 months. but the possibility of losing Chinese
 assistance could prompt the regime to try to
 increase its economic ties with Yugoslavia.

 Western Europe
 Albania now has diplomatic relations with all
 West European nations except Spain, West Ger-
 many, and the UK and is currently trying to
 strengthen its existing contacts. In doing so,
 Tirana is cultivating ties not only with non-
 aligned governments, but also with NATO mem-
 bers the Albanians perceive as independent of
 the US.6
 The Albanians hope they will be able to es-
 tablish closer economic ties to compensate for
 the reduction or possible loss of economic assis-
 tance from Peking. Their meager economic re-
 sources, however, permit only a modest expan-
 sion of exports to the industrialized states. De-
 spite a fivefold increase between 1970 and
 1975, Albania's exports to the OECD countries
 amounted to no more than $50 million in 1975.
 Moreover, as long as ideological extremism
 determines policy, Albania cannot conclude
 credit arrangements with the West. The constitu-
 tion forbids borrowing from "capitalist" coun-
 tries and prohibits forming joint enterprises with
 foreign concerns.
 These restrictions seriously hinder the impor-
 tation of foreign equipment necessary to main-
 tain the industrialization program. By sharply
 reducing machinery imports, Albania could
 probably purchase the most essential industrial
 and agricultural materials. In the long run, how-
 ever, this would inevitably have a negative im-
 pact on economic development. Albanian plan-
 ners are probably also aware that the West will
 not find it expedient to replace Chinese eco-
 nomic aid and technical advisers.
 There is also some evidence that Albanian
 overtures to Western Europe involve political
 consideratiofts.
 6Italy, with which the Albanian Communists have maintained a
 special relationship since the 1950s, is an obvious exception.
 That relationship stems from historical contacts and geographi-
 cal proximity, and it has not been influenced by Italy's close
 political ties with the US.
 Fn view of the
 regime's ideological lncompatl lllty with demo-
 cratic political systems, it is not clear what sort
 of political arrangement Tirana may hope to
 establish with West European governments. The
 Albanians probably feel that the Mediterranean
 countries will want to take out some insurance
 against the possibility of increased Soviet in-
 Relations with the US
 The Hoxha regime's attitude toward the
 United States has been unrelentingly hostile.
 Hoxha and other Albanian leaders depicit Wash-
 ington as the world's leading reactionary power
 and a direct threat to Albania's security. This
 rhetoric includes elements of genuine uncom-
 promising hostility to the US, as well as con-
 siderable ideological posturing.
 Tirana went out of its way to rebuff US
 overtures in the early 1970s. We have seen no
 hint of any change in this attitude. It would no
 doubt be awkward for the Albanians to make an
 overture to the US while criticizing the Chinese
 for doing the same thing. A US connection,
 however, or the hint that one was in the making,
 might serve Tirana's interest in fending off any
 perceived threat from Yugoslavia and the USSR.
 Although the Albanians are unlikely to pur-
 sue relations with Washington as long as Hoxha
 is in power, they could indirectly signal a mod-
 eration of their anti-US stand by de-escalating
 criticism of Chinese-US contacts. Albania might
 be willing to purchase US-licensed equipment
 from West European countries, pretending not
 to notice the American connection. Tirana may
 also gradually modify the extremely hostile tone
 of its anti-US propaganda, without essentially
 changing its ideological opposition to the US.

 The Pakistan National Alliance
 Participants and Prospects
 Central Intelligence Agency
 Directorate of Intelligence
 The Pakistan National Alliance (PNA) ap-
 pears to have the edge on its opponents in the
 race for the national and provincial assembly
 elections scheduled for 18 October. The nine-
 party alliance, formed on 11 January, has so far
 maintained a high degree of unity, despite the
 deep differences among its members. It has
 done so by concentrating on the one point on
 which its members are in complete agreement-
 the need to defeat former Prime Minister
 Bhutto and his Pakistan People's Party (PPP).
 Once in power, this coalition of Islamic conserv-
 atives, secular nationalists, and provincial auton-
 omists will face issues which could quickly
 bring basic disagreements to the surface and
 threaten to split the Alliance.
 The Religious Parties
 Pakistan is 97 percent Muslim, and religion
 plays an important part in the lives of most
 Pakistanis, but the religious parties have had
 little success in their attempts to win public
 office. Pakistani voters tend to doubt the ability
 of the religious leaders to govern, and even
 many of those who favor making Pakistan a
 more Islamic country believe the programs of
 the religious parties are too extreme.
 Success for the Islamic parties has also been
 hindered by disagreements among their leaders
 which have historically prevented the formation
 of an Islamic front. Furthermore, all of the
 major religious parties are oriented toward
 Sunni Islam, which limits their appeal to the
 quarter of the population that is Shiah, the
 other main branch of Islam.
 Jamaat-i-Islami (JI). The Congregation of
 Islam, founded in 1941 by Maulana Syed Abdul
 Ala Maudoodi, is probably Pakistan's best or-
 ganized and most cohesive party. Maudoodi,
 because of his advanced age, has relinquished
 the leadership of the party to others but still
 has considerable influence. Tofail Mohammed is
 the current chairman, but another member,
 Professor Ghafoor Ahmed, the secretary general
 of the PNA, has been far more prominent in
 recent months.
 The party seeks to reorganize Pakistani soci-
 ety in accordance with a strict interpretation of
 Islamic law and custom. It tends toward a
 pan-Islamic rather than nationalistic point of
 view which, in the 1940s, lay behind its failure
 to support efforts to create Pakistan, something
 its more nationalist opponents frequently point
 out.
 Although the party is well disciplined, it has
 limited popular support and has not done well
 in elections. It is strongest in the Punjab and has
 developed some following among non-Sindhis in
 the Sind, but it is very weak in Baluchistan and
 the North-West Frontier.
 Jamiat-ul-Ulema-i-Islam (JUI). The Society
 of the Ulema (religious leaders) of Islam has its
 greatest strength in the North-West Frontier
 Province, where its leader, Mufti Mahmood,
 who is also president of the PNA, headed a
 coalition government in 1972-73.

 Like the JI, the JUI seeks to transform
 Pakistan into a truly Islamic state. Both parties
 favor free enterprise, but the JUI is more
 sympathetic toward socialism. It is, however,
 more conservative than the JI on issues such as
 motion pictures and the role of women in
 society.
 Jamiat-ul-Ulema-i-Pakistan (JUP). The Soci-
 ety of the Ulema of Pakistan, led by Shah
 Ahmed Noorani, was formed by dissidents from
 the JUI in 1969. It draws on a much more
 mystic interpretation of Islam than the other
 two major Islamic parties. Much of its political
 strength derives from the support of local pirs
 (saints), the belief in whom the JI maintains is
 heresy.
 Although also seeking to establish an Islamic
 state, the JUP is far more nationalistic than the
 JI or JUL It is strongest in the Punjab, where it
 elected four delegates to the National Assembly
 in 1970. All later defected to Bhutto's Pakistan
 People's Party, but, with Bhutto in trouble, the
 party might well regain those seats.
 Kaksar  Tehriq.  The  Kaksar  Movement,
 headed by Hadji Safaraz Khan, was founded in
 1930 as a paramilitary organization dedicated
 to Islamic dominance in the subcontinent.
 Although some of its members and sympa-
 thizers have held public office, it is not strictly
 a political party and played little part in either
 the last election campaign or in the agitation
 and negotiations which followed. Presumably it
 would have, at most, a very minor role in any
 Alliance government.
 The Nationalists
 The secular nationalist parties in the Alliance
 (as well as Bhutto's PPP) reflect the basic
 outlook of most Pakistanis, at least the 80
 percent of the population that lives in the Sind
 and the Punjab. From the time Pakistan at-
 tained independence 30 years ago, the nation's
 rulers-whether soldiers or civilians-have placed
 national interests ahead of those of the prov-
 inces and pragmatism ahead of doctrine in their
 economic and social policies. They have based
 their foreign policies on the threat from India
 and have supported Islam-although usually
 more because they see it as a force for national
 unity than because of any deep personal belief.
 The voters have supported men with such an
 outlook in the past and are likely to continue to
 do so. Policy differences among the secular
 nationalists are at times important to the voters,
 but they are more likely to base their choice on
 their assessment of the candidates' character,
 personality, and prestige.
 Pakistan Muslim League. The Pakistan Mus-
 lim League-the party responsible for the crea-
 tion of Pakistan-has fallen on hard times after
 dominating the country's politics for most of its
 first quarter century. When it ruled, its pro-
 grams were highly nationalistic, mildly socialis-
 tic, and basically secular.
 Its strength was based on the support of local
 political leaders, many of them more interested
 in the benefits of association with the ruling
 party than in its ideology. Corruption and an
 inability to solve Pakistan's economic problems
 eroded its popular support, and defections and
 divisions had reduced it to little more than a
 platform for a few aging politicians at the time
 of the formation of the PNA.
 The present Muslim League faction in the
 PNA is led by the Pir of Pagaro and has retained
 some potential as a rallying point. (Another
 faction, under Khan Abdul Qayyum Khan
 remains outside the PNA.) There have already
 been defections from Bhutto's PPP, which is
 composed largely of former Muslim Leaguers,
 but most have yet formally to join another
 party. Although membership in the more pow-
 erful Tehriq-i-Istiglal might be more profitable
 in the long run for the PPP defectors, they are
 likely to find a warmer welcome and be more
 comfortable in one of the factions of the much
 less moralistic Muslim League.
 Tehriq-i-Istiglal. The Solidarity Movement,
 founded in 1970 and still dominated by former
 Air Force commander Asgh.ar Khan, is probably
 the single most important party in the Alliance.
 During the last election campaign, Asghar
 emerged as the leading spokesman for the

 Approved For Release 2006/01/30 : CIA-RDP79B00457A000400120001-6
 opposition. Later, during the negotiations with
 Prime Minister Bhutto on holding a new elec-
 tion, he was able to convince his more moderate
 colleagues in the Alliance to go along with his
 refusal to compromise. The Tehriq will probably
 receive a significant share of the places on the
 PNA slate, and many Pakistanis see Asghar as
 the country's probable next prime minister.
 Asghar's devotion to principle and his incor-
 ruptibility are both his greatest political asset
 and his greatest liability. In a country where
 most  politicians are  regarded-usually  cor-
 rectly-as motivated primarily by self-interest
 and a willingness to do almost anything for a
 price, Asghar stands out as a man who can be
 trusted to do what he believes is right.
 Air Marshal Asghar Khan
 Tehriq-i-lstiq/a/ leader
 On the other hand, he has great difficulty
 making the deals that are the life blood of
 Pakistani politics, and at various times-such as
 when he once quit politics in disgust-he has
 appeared both erratic and ineffective.
 Asghar is a strong nationalist and an advocate
 of major improvements in Pakistan's defense
 capabilities. He favors moderately socialistic
 economic policies, although his land reform
 program would go far beyond what the Bhutto
 government attempted and could alienate many
 local political leaders, most of whom are land-
 owners.
 Pakistan Democratic Party (PDP). The Pak-
 istan Democratic Party was formed by several
 small parties, including the Pakistan Democratic
 Movement  (itself a coalition  including Na-
 wabzada Nasrullah Khan's splinter of the once
 powerful Awami League and a small religious
 party), and the Justice Party, founded and later
 abandoned by Asghar Khan.
 Much of the PDP's strength was in East
 Pakistan, and following the division of the
 country in 1971, there were major defections
 from the West Pakistani remnant because of
 disagreement over Pakistani policies toward
 Bangladesh.
 The PDP would win few if any seats running
 on its own-in 1970, the only National As-
 sembly seat it won was in East Pakistan-but
 Nasrullah Khan, the party leader and vice
 president of the PNA, probably has more
 influence in the Alliance than his party's pop-
 ular support warrants.
 The party takes a fairly moderate stance on
 most issues-regional autonomy in the context
 of' national unity, land reform which would
 hurt only the large landowners, nationalization
 of some-but hardly all-industries, and turning
 Pakistan more toward Islam, but not to the
 extent advocated by the major religious parties.
 All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference.
 The All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Confer-
 ence is technically not Pakistani, but a major
 party in Azad Kashmir, that part of Kashmir

 Approved For Release 2006/01/30 : CIA-RDP79B00457A000400120001-6
 under Pakistani control but theoretically inde-
 pendent. The party, headed by former Azad
 Kashmir president Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan,
 favors the union of all Kashmir with Pakistan
 following a plebiscite throughout the state.
 When it was in power, it generally followed the
 policies laid down for it by Islamabad.
 The Conference was the ruling party in Azad
 Kashmir in 1975, when Pakistani Prime Minister
 Bhutto engineered Qayyum's removal from the
 presidency.  Soon afterward, in an election
 which the Conference boycotted, the pro-
 Bhutto Azad Kashmir People's Party gained
 control of the legislature. The Conference ex-
 pects to regain control of the state in an
 election scheduled to be held in October.
 The Provincial Autonomists
 Punjabis have generally dominated Pakistani
 politics, even though no Punjabi has actually
 headed a government since the late 1950s.
 Although there has been some resentment of
 Punjabi dominance in the Sind, the viewpoints
 of the people in the two provinces are close
 enough so that no major problems have arisen.
 Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier
 Province, however, have a long tradition of
 resistance to control by the central govern-
 ment-the Punjabis and their Sindhi allies-and
 their efforts to seek greater provincial auton-
 omy have been a greater or lesser problem for
 all Pakistani governments.
 National Democratic Party (NDP). The Na-
 tional Democratic Party was founded in 1975, a
 few months after Bhutto banned the National
 Awami Party (NAP) and arrested many of its
 leaders including Khan Abdul Wali Khan, at
 that time the most prominent of the opposition
 leaders. Bhutto charged the party with plotting
 the secession, with Afghan backing, of Baluch-
 istan and the NWFP.
 Although Sardar Sherbaz Khan Mazari, the
 present NDP leader, was not a member of the
 NAP, most other party leaders were, and Wali
 Khan's wife plays a more prominent role in
 party affairs than Mazari. The NAP and NDP, in
 fact, are virtually identical.
 Wali Khan
 Imprisoned leader of the NAP
 The NAP historically has been three parties,
 each having little in common with the others. In
 the Sind and the Punjab, it was a small, almost
 insignificant collection of extreme leftists, de-
 spite Wali's efforts to build a national following.
 In the North-West Frontier, it was the party
 of the Pathans and the most important party in
 the province. It favored much greater provincial
 autonomy, and some of its members may have
 hoped eventually to unite the province with
 Afghanistan. Although. extreme leftists were a
 small minority in the Frontier NAP, at least one
 prominent party member was a Communist.
 In Baluchistan, the NAP was the vehicle of
 the generally conservative leaders of the major
 Baluchi's tribes. Their main objective was the
 protection of their traditional powers from
 both the provincial government-which they
 controlled until Bhutto intervened in 1973-and

 Approved For Release 2006/01/30 : CIA-RDP79B00457A000400120001-6
 from the central government. The party was, in
 fact, so thoroughly Baluch that the Pathans in
 the northern part of the province formed a
 splinter NAP of their own.
 The Allies of the Alliance
 Two other parties have announced that they
 will support the Alliance, although no formal
 arrangements have been worked out and might
 well be difficult.
 All Pakistan Muslim League (QML). The
 Muslim League faction headed by Khan Abdul
 Qayyum Khan (not to be confused with the
 leader of the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim
 Conference) had some strength in the Sind and
 Punjab, but its major support was in those areas
 of the North-West Frontier where Pakistani
 nationalism was a greater force than Pathan
 separatism. Qayyum has been a rival of the
 provincial autonomists since his successful ef-
 forts to include the Frontier Province in Pak-
 istan despite the strong opposition of Wali
 Khan's father and uncle.
 The Qayyum Muslim League's programs are
 almost indentical to those of the Muslim League
 headed by the Pir of Pagaro, but there is little
 love lost between the two groups. Qayyum
 broke with the other party in the 1960s, and his
 later service as interior minister in Bhutto's
 cabinet further worsened his relations with
 Alliance leaders. The delegate to the National
 Assembly elected by the QML in 1977, has
 announced that the party has merged with the
 Pir's Muslim League, but other party officials
 have denied this,
 Jiye Sind Mazar. It is unlikely that the
 Alliance either sought or wants the support of
 G. M. Syed's Sindhi nationalists now united
 under the name of the Long Live Sind Front. A
 rabid defender of the Sind, and one whose
 pronouncements raise some questions about his
 sanity, Syed is likely to be more of a liability
 than an asset. He might be able to win sonic
 votes from the Sindhis who have supported
 Bhutto in the last two elections, but only
 through vitriolic attacks on the non-Sindhi
 groups in the province who have previously
 been the Alliance's most dependable supporters.
 An Alliance Government
 Should the Pakistan National Alliance win
 the election in October, the government that
 would be formed would almost certainly be
 dominated by the nationalists. Although the
 nationalists would control the government in
 Islamabad, and presumably the provincial gov-
 ernments in the Sind and the Punjab as well,
 provincial autonomists would almost certainly
 gain control in Baluchistan and the North-West
 Frontier.
 Even with goodwill on both sides, some
 tension in relations between the latter two
 provincial governments and the federal govern-
 ment seems inevitable. The leaders of the NDP,
 moreover, have often distrusted Asghar and the
 Muslim  Leaguers, and  the failure of these
 Alliance spokesmen to make a serious effort for
 the release of Wali Khan has probably increased
 this hostility. Most of the politicians jailed by
 Bhutto were released either during the negotia-
 tions which preceded the military coup or soon
 afterward by the martial law administration,
 but Wali's treason trial drags on.
 Many of the nationalists would see the NDP's
 efforts for greater provincial autonomy as a
 prelude to secession, and the government might
 well find itself under pressure from the military
 to exert stronger control over provincial affairs.
 An open confrontation between the bulk of the
 Alliance and the NDP would be difficult to
 avoid, and if the Alliance's victory margin in
 October is slim, an open break could leave
 Pakistan with a minority government.
 Other threats to Alliance unity will be more
 manageable. The religious parties are certain to
 press for reforms to make Pakistan into the
 Islamic state they have long desired, and the
 nationalists will probably be willing to make the
 cosmetic changes requested. If the religious
 parties demand more basic changes-such as the
 abolition of the banking system (which violates
 Approved For Release 2006/01/30 : CIA-RDP79B00457A000400120001-6
 Approved For Release 2006/01/30 : CIA-RDP79B00457A000400120001-6
 Islamic law by paying and charging interest)-
 there would be a confrontation in which at least
 some of the religious leaders almost certainly
 would leave the Alliance.
 Asghar Khan seems likely to dominate the
 nationalists, and through them the government,
 even if someone else becomes prime minister.
 He may, however, have difficulty controlling his
 fellow nationalists, including those in his own
 party. Few of them have the strength of
 character of Asghar and will find it hard to
 resist the temptations of office. Eventually a
 major confrontation could develop either be-
 cause of an attempt to ease the too honest
 Asghar from power or because of an attempt by
 Asghar to cleanse the government.
 Foreign policy is unlikely to be a major cause
 of disagreement in an Alliance government.
 Fear of India and the need for foreign aid will
 continue to determine the direction of foreign
 relations. The religious parties, despite some
 misgivings about dealing with atheists, will
 probably not object to continued good relations
 with Peking because of the importance of
 Chinese political and military  support. All
 parties-although not necessarily for the same
 reasons-will support efforts to strengthen. ties
 with other Islamic countries. An Alliance gov-
 ernment may well be more disposed. than
 Bhutto's to maintaining good relations with the
 US, although it will be reluctant to be seen as
 bowing to foreign pressure on issues such as the
 acquisition of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant
 from France. Only relations with Afghanistan
 could cause major disagreement within the
 Alliance, but trouble with Kabul-which has
 supported the provincial autonomists in the
 past-is more likely to be the result than the
 cause of a falling out between the nationalists
 and the NDP.
 A few of the major Alliance leaders are noted
 for their political skill. Asghar has great diffi-
 culty in compromising, the religious leaders are
 prone to bitter disputes with each other as well
 as with other party leaders, and Wali Khan and
 the other provincial autonomists have used
 confrontation as a major political weapon in the
 past. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, probably a more
 skillful politician than anyone in the Alliance,
 will do his utmost to encourage their differ-
 ences.
