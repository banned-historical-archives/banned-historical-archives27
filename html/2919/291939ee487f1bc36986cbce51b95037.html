 UNIFY THINKING, CONSCIENTIOUSLY RECTIFY PARTY WORK STYLE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 5, 1 Mar 82 pp 2-13, 16
 [Speech by Wang Renzhong on 11 February 1982 at a meeting of responsible
 cadres of departments directly under the Hubei provincial authorities]
 [Text] Talking about the importance of the question concerning party work
 style, Comrade Chen Yun once said:  "The question concerning the work style
 of a ruling party is a question concerning the life and death of this party."
 That is to say, the question of party work style concerns whether our party
 will degenerate and whether our country will change its political color.
 Comrade Mao Zedong made the mistake of launching the "Great Cultural Revo-
 lution" because he wrongly appraised the situation and thought that our
 party would soon degenerate and our country change its political color.  His
 appraisal was incompatible with the actual conditions.  His wrong appraisal
 of the situation led to the adoption of wrong policies and resulted in the
 decade-long internal strife.  This was an impressive lesson.  However,
 speaking in terms of possibility, there is the danger that the party may
 degenerate and the country change its political color.  As long as imperial-
 ism and social imperialism exist and before we have achieved communism, we
 cannot say that the danger of the party degenerating and the country chang-
 ing its political color does not exist.  If we say that our party and coun-
 try are not in such a danger, we are in danger of slackening our vigilance.
 The correct attitude is to be aware of this danger and adopt.a correct
 method to overcome this danger.  Only by doing so can we ensure that our
 party will not degenerate and our country will not change its political
 color.  We have confidence in our ability to do so.
 The First Question Is What Attitude We Should Take Toward Our Party Work
 Style
 Our party work style has been appraised in two incorrect ways.  One incorrect
 appraisal is made by a few people who hold that our party has degenerated, is
 hopeless and must be toppled and it is necessary to change the regime.  They
 say that a two-party system should be adopted as in the United States and
 the two parties take the reins of government by turns, with one holding
 office and the other being out of office.   This view is held by the remnant
 forces of the "gang of four," including Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao who
 are in prison.   Echoing them in society are the heads of some illegal

 organizations and publications.  Their words and deeds are counterrevolu-
 tionary.                     We must expose and crack down on their words and deeds.  There
 are other muddleheaded people, especially some youngsters, who believe
 these words and lose their confidence in the party.  We should not label
 them as counterrevolutionaries but should warn them and educate them
 through criticism.  We should tell them to neither be taken in by the
 enemy nor to echo the enemy's counterrevolutionary words.  There were still
 quite a number of such muddleheaded people in the first half of last year.
 The conditions now have been greatly improved.  But, we cannot say that
 there are no such people at present.  We are still required to work on them.
 The other incorrect appraisal is made by another small group of people who
 hold that there is nothing wrong with our party work style.   In their
 opinion, people are trying to scare others when they say that our party work
 style is unhealthy; people are exaggerating when they say that the matter
 concerns the life and death of the party..  Some comrades even hold that the
 practices of establishing underhand connections for the sake of personal
 gain, securing advantages through pull or influence, putting up houses for
 private use, transferring rural residences to cities and seeking privileges
 in daily life are trifles.  They do not know that these trifles have caused
 the dissatisfaction of the masses with our party, harmed the image of our
 party and impaired the prestige of our party.  Moreover, these trifles are
 not few but exist rather extensively.   For example, the practice of putting
 up houses for private use is widely prevalent.  Some cadres put up houses
 for private use by adopting various undesirable means, such as encroaching
 on vegetable plots, embezzling public funds or using manpower of the collec-
 tive or the urban building construction teams.                 In some cases, very obnoxious
 practices have been involved.  Some cadres have seized houses, and not just
 one but two or three in some instances..  Some houses were intended to be
 built for workers but eventually became the leading cadres' quarters.  The
 masses were certainly critical about this.   The question of "changing agri-
 cultural population into nonagricultural population" also exists in many
 localities.   Some people took not only their wives and children but also
 their relatives and friends to the cities to consume commodity grain and
 unlawfully arranged jobs for them.  Why was it that urban population con-
 tinued to grow?  Many rural residents came to the cities through underhand
 means.  The masses also were very critical about this.  This shows that such
 phenomena are not minor problems in daily life but have posed a serious
 political problem.  Quantitative change will lead to qualitative change when
 it develops to a certain extent.   This is a basic principle of the Marxist
 dialectics.
 What especially attracts our close attention is that in our party and army,
 in the state organs and in our enterprises and institutions, there are bad
 elements engaged in smuggling, bribery, profiteering, graft and embezzle-
 ment.   Up to the present, we have not discovered any province free from
 these conditions.  Of course, conditions vary in different localities and
 may be serious in one locality and not so serious in another.   Smuggling is
 rampant to an appalling extent in some localities.   These economic crimes
 were often committed by the higher levels working in collaboration with the
 lower levels, by people at home working in collaboration with those abroad,

 by people in the interior working in collaboration with those in Hong Kong
 and Taiwan and by capitalists at home working in collaboration with foreign
 capitalists.   This is not only an economic problem but also a very serious
 political problem and reflects the class struggle at present.  Some of
 those committing these crimes were recruited by special agents; they gave
 them information and joined their secret service.  Our comrades must under-
 stand that as long as imperialism and social imperialism exist and before
 Taiwan has returned to the embrace of the motherland, they will always carry
 out espionage against us.   Of course, we should not think that all foreigners,
 compatriots from Hong Kong and Taiwan and Overseas Chinese who visit our
 country are up to no good.   But it is naive to say that none of these visitors
 is a special agent.   Therefore, we must teach our comrades not to be taken in
 by them but to heighten their vigilance against them.   Take for example the
 foreign capitalists who do business with us.  Like any capitalists, they are
 intent on nothing but profit.   Is there any capitalist in the world (except
 a few progressive ones) who does not want to make profit?  That is the nature
 of a capitalist.   Our open-door policy will not change.  Neither shall we
 change our policy of making contacts and cultivating friendship with the
 peoples and governments of all foreign countries.   However, our comrades
 must never forget that:   First, in doing business with foreigners, we should
 do our best to avoid being taken in and at least to avoid suffering great
 losses.   Second, we must pay particular attention to resisting the corrosive
 influence of the bourgeois ideology and way of life and always be vigilant
 against the bourgeoisie's attack with "sugar-coated bullets."  We must see
 that we are now facing a struggle between corrosion and anticorrosion.   With
 the increase in international communication, this struggle is becoming more
 and more complicated.   For example, a capitalist may give you television sets
 and tape recorders.  Does he give you these things for nothing?  Is he so
 .generous?  A certain comrade borrowed money from a capitalist when he was
 abroad.  Actually he was asking for money rather than borrowing money from
 others and when you sign contracts with them, you will have to agree to any
 terms set by them.   By doing so, you have made a small profit, but the state
 suffers a great loss.   Does such a man have an iota of patriotism, not to
 mention party spirit?   Some other people have collaborated with foreign
 merchants in speculation and profiteering by recklessly smuggling gold,
 silver, cultural relics and rare herbal medicine.  They deliberately broke
 the law.   Their crimes cannot be pardoned.
 The biggest criminals ever discovered in Guangdong are the director of the
 Guangzhou Telecommunication Bureau and his wife.   Is he the person of the
 highest rank involved in similar cases?  No one can guarantee that there are
 no other persons of still higher rank involved.   The CCP Central Committee
 has now decided to make a thoroughgoing investigation.   The higher the rank
 of a cadre handling the cases of graft and embezzlement, profiteering, smug-
 gling and other economic crimes is, the more strictly he should handle these
 cases.  Why?  The first reason is that he has been long educated by the party
 and tempered in the revolution and therefore should have strong party spirit;
 he is experienced in handling such cases and is not young and naive so that
 he should handle the cases strictly.  The second reason is that strict
 handling of cases involving a few leading cadres who seriously violated the
 law and discipline may create public opinion inside the party and in society

 that bureaucrats of the CCP should not shield each other and leading cadres
 should be severely punished for violating the law.   This means love for our
 veteran cadres and defends their honor.   The final results,of the investi-
 gation will show that only a very small number of our veteran cadres have
 seriously violated the law and discipline.  This will tell the masses that
 only a very small number of our veteran cadres have degenerated.  This will
 preserve the prestige of our veteran cadres and our party.  Otherwise, a
 small piece of rotten meat will spoil the whole pot of food.  Facts have
 proved that the broad masses of our veteran cadres are good and maintain
 the fine traditions of the party and that only a very small number of them
 have degenerated.   Some comrades have been tainted with bad habits and have
 made mistakes under new conditions.   They are different from those who have
 degenerated.  We believe that they will definitely change for the better
 after receiving education.
 We must correctly appraise the question concerning party work style.   On the
 one hand, we should see that our party work style has not fundamentally
 changed for the better; on the other, we should see that our party work
 style has undergone a considerably great change for the better in the past
 few years.
 What are the chief indications which show that our party work style has
 changed for the better?  First of all, we have a good party Central Com-
 mittee.  Our current Central Committee has really revived and carried for-
 ward our party's fine traditions and the work style of integrating theory
 with reality, maintaining close ties with the masses and making criticism
 and self-criticism.   It realistically acts according to the principle of
 democratic centralism and no longer follows the practice of letting one
 person alone or a few people have the say.  With the exception of some
 questions in daily work which the Central Secretariat is authorized by the
 Central Politburo to decide on and handle, the decisions made by the
 Central Secretariat on questions concerning major principles and policies
 must be approved by the Politburo or the Standing Committee of the Politburo
 prior to circulation as central instructions.   The meetings of the Central
 Secretariat are usually presided over by Comrade Hu Yaobang.  Comrade Zhao
 Ziyang also takes part in the discussion of important questions concerning
 government work and economic work.  Naturally we respect the opinions of
 both Comrades Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang.   However, a decision is never
 made by an individual but is made only after group discussion.   During these
 discussions, each comrade may give his own opinion and even those comrades
 who attend meetings of the Central Secretariat as observers may express
 their opinions.   Should there be different opinions, the Secretariat adopts a
 cautious attitude and usually postpones the making of decisions.  Whether
 during the meetings or personal talks,  the comrades of the Secretariat includ-
 ing our secretary general, always seriously make criticisms and self-
 criticisms.   The situation is the same in the Central Politburo.                         Once in a
 discussion of a very important question, a few comrades put forth different
 opinions which were later proved wrong in actual practice.   However, none of
 these comrades was ordered to make self-criticism or held responsible for
 the mistake. In fact, all these comrades who gave different opinions are good
 comrades and they are concerned with the interests of our country without any

 selfish ideas and personal considerations.  There will be no problem at all
 when they realize that their ideas are wrong and resolutely implement the
 party's decisions.  Our current Central Committee really is developing
 democracy and is indeed exercising collective leadership according to the
 principles of democratic centralism.
 Now the central authorities are taking the lead in streamlining organization,
 training cadres in rotation, raising efficiency and overcoming bureaucratism.
 This is a revolution in the state system which is of profound significance.
 Yet, instead of merely requiring organizations at lower levels to carry out
 this revolution, the central authorities are the first to do so by setting an
 example for the lower levels and undergoing experiences to be passed on to
 the lower levels.
 Regarding the actions of senior cadres in their daily life, not one leading
 comrade in the central authorities has been found to have violated the rele-
 vant stipulations of the central authorities since they were made.  In the
 past, each member at or above the level of the Politburo of the party
 Central Committee, vice premier and vice chairman of the NPC Standing Com-
 mittee had two cars.  It was then decided that each of them should have only
 one car, and this stipulation is now being observed.  In the past, leading
 comrades in the central authorities had the privilege of having a film shown
 at their own place.   This privilege has been given up in accordance with the
 criticisms of the masses.   Now when we want to see a film we have to buy a
 ticket and see the film together with other comrades.   All gifts received by
 leading comrades in the central authorities during their visits to other
 countries must be handed over to the state, except for souvenir badges.  Now
 Zhongnanhai is open to the public on Saturdays. and Sundays, and cadres and
 masses can buy tickets to visit it.  The Great Hall of the People is also
 opened to the public, cadres and masses can buy tickets to visit it, and
 mass organizations and various associations can hold their meetings there.
 All this could not have happened in the past.   Before the "Great Cultural
 Revolution," conferences were usually held every summer at Lushan or
 Beidaihe, so that central leaders could enjoy themselves at these summer
 resorts while attending conferences.   This practice has also been changed.
 Not one leading comrade in the central authorities who is in good health
 takes off for a vacation, except those who are old or sick and are allowed
 by the central authorities to leave their posts for convalescence.   Even on
 Sunday, they often do not rest but continue to work.  This is the real life
 of the party Central Committee.  However, some people are still attacking
 the party Central Committee, saying that they enjoy privileges.   They have
 even said that the Central Committee has degenerated and deteriorated.  What
 else can this be if it is not rumormongering?
 What was mentioned above shows that our party Central Committee is good.  It
 is not as bad as some people have said.  We are reasonable to say that the
 work style of the present party Central Committee is even better than that
 before the "Great Cultural Revolution."  The fine traditions during the
 Yanan period and the period of the liberation war as well as the fine tradi-
 tions during the period immediately after the founding of the state have
 been carried on in the present party Central Committee.  Of course, what is

 the most important is that a correct and Marxist ideological, political and
 organizational line which suits China's conditions has been mapped out
 since the 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th plenary sessions of the 11th CCP Central
 Committee.  The "resolution" adopted by the sixth plenary session, in par-
 ticular, summed up historical experiences of our party since the founding
 of the state and is playing an important role in bringing order out of
 chaos, in unifying the ideology of the whole party, in strengthening the
 unity of the whole party and in promoting our work.  It is of great his-
 torical significance.   Our practice over the past several years shows that
 the line, policies and principles formulated by the CCP Central Committee
 are correct.  As to some mistakes and shortcomings in our concrete work,
 they are unavoidable at present and will also be unavoidable in the future;
 they were unavoidable when Comrade Mao Zedong was alive,. and would also be
 unavoidable even if Marx were chairman of our party.
 Soon'after the sixth plenary session, a forum on work on the ideological
 front was held.  It advocated carrying out criticism.and self-criticism,.
 strengthening party discipline and overcoming laxity and weakness.   It not
 only. criticized the trend of bourgeois liberalization but also required that
 CCP committees at all levels fight against various unhealthy tendencies on
 various fronts.  Recently after making some investigations at the lower
 levels, I felt that this forum has. really played a great role.  Before I made
 the investigations I did not expect that the forum on the ideological front
 work had played such a'great role and felt that many ideological problems
 were still not solved.   But now J have realized that the role this forum
 .has played is greater than I had expected.  As everyone can see, over the
 past half year or so, we have made encouraging progress in our press, broad-
 cast, television, film and other work.  Recently I had a talk with some com-
 rades from the literary and art circles.   I found that they all have new
 plans and have made up their minds to go deep into the thick of life and
 create better literary works.
 In Guangxi, Hunan and Hubei, when I called some advanced people together and
 had a talk with them,  I found that within our party, there are still large
 numbers of good comrades who have high class consciousness, are honest and
 upright and dare to struggle against unhealthy tendencies and evil practices.
 In Hubei some veteran model workers of the 1950's whom I talked with are
 still keeping to their lofty fine qualities in ideology and in work style.
 Some of the advanced people are young people.  For example, in Guangxi,
 there is a female comrade called Zeng Xiaolian.   She is a league branch
 secretary and has a high consciousness and a good style of work.  She has
 done very well in helping some backward or erring youths.   Her mother is a
 neighborhood committee director, who has been serving the masses of people
 wholeheartedly for 30 years or so.   There is no stealing in their resi-
 dential district.  You can just leave your bicycle in front of a gate, for
 thieves dare not steal things in this district.   Both the mother and the
 daughter are advanced individuals.   As soon as I learned this, I made a
 telephone call to Beijing, inviting two writers to come to Guangxi to write
 about the advanced people and their good deeds.   The large number of good
 cadres and advanced people always act in accordance with the party. Central
 Committee's requirements, and their hearts and the hearts of the people

 always beat as one.  It is not as some people have said that, just as all
 crows are black, everyone is involved in the unhealthy practices.  Defi-
 nitely not!  Although such advanced people are few, their exemplary role is
 very important. They represent the healthy trends of our party and our
 nation!
 In Hubei, were not some female comrades labeled as the so-called "five black
 flowers" during the "Great Cultural Revolution"?  I only wrote a short
 article in the past to praise "a red flower," that is, Comrade Xia Juhua.
 However, some people in the "rebellion faction" created the "five black
 flowers."  They included not only Xia Juhua, but also Liu Feng, Chen Kuang,
 Jiang Guiying and Wang Yuzhen.  This time I had a talk with some of them
 and some other outstanding young actors and actresses who have scored
 achievements in their artistic work.  They are all loyal to the party and
 are ready to make more contributions to the party and the people before they
 become old.   This is highly commendable.  However, they feel there is insuf-
 ficient scope to exercise their abilities and nobody will listen to them.
 Although Liu Feng is a girl of strong character, she cried bitterly this
 time when she spoke.   I said, at the time when the party Central Committee
 is combating the unhealthy tendencies, you have answered the party's call
 enthusiastically and boldly struggled against the unhealthy tendencies.
 Thus you have played the role of a mainstay at the mid-levels.   Thus, our
 party is full of promise.   I also talked with some comrades from the press
 circles.  After one of the editors of GUANGMING RIBAO finished her impas-
 sioned speech, I said, you must insist on fighting; what on earth are you
 afraid of?    She said she was not afraid of anything but what she said would
 be of no use.  What conclusion can we draw from this?  It shows that we have
 many good comrades who wish to do more work for the party, but they have not
 been discovered or are being oppressed.  These good comrades and advanced
 people, as Lu Xun said, are the backbones of the Chinese nation on whom we
 place our hopes.  What action, then, should our party take to deal with
 those who oppress the newly emerging forces and who mock at or attack the
 advanced?  I think our comrades will certainly know what to do.
 The Second Question Is How To Rectify Party Work Style
 First, it is necessary to greatly strengthen communist ideological education,
 to widely publicize good people and good deeds and to greatly support the
 advanced people and newly emerging things; it is necessary to clear the way
 .for their advance and to get rid of all difficulties and obstacles in their
 work.  We would like to tell all those who do not support newly emerging
 things or who have placed obstacles in their way of advance:  We shall not
 punish you, but would you please leave your posts or be transferred to some
 other posts?  If you are old, you should retire or leave your posts for.
 convalescence.
 I spent 2 and 1/2 days listening to the report given by Xiangfan munici-
 pality.   This city has done quite a good job.   In the past, Xiangfan was a
 very backward city.   In the early years after liberation it had a little
 handicraft industry but was without other industry. Its total industrial
 output value amounted to only 50 million yuan.  This increased to 100 million

 in the early years of the "Great Cultural Revolution."  After the "gang of
 four" Vas' smashed,;,-its output value rose, to only 600 million yuan in 1978,.
 then this amount increased by 200 million yuan each year in 1979, 1980 and
 1981.  At present it has reached 1.2 billion yuan.  Taking the city's
 population as a basis for calculation, the average industrial output value
 per capita is 5,,000 yuan.  They have indeed done a good job.  Their experi-
 ences should be summed up and passed on to others.                    The first enterprise in
 Xiangfan to become well-known throughout the country was the Xiangfan tex-
 tile mill.  It"was`'already one of the five national advanced units in 1963.
 Comrade Liang Yanbin was an advanced figure of this factory.   I once wrote
 an article of several hundred words, entitled "A Red Banner," in praise of
 her.   Nevertheless, she was persecuted and afterward locked up.  Premier Zhou
 received her</div></div></div>  </div>
