 For an
 I ndia-China-Soviet Alliance
 P. C.
 On the 7th of this  month falls the most
 significant date in world history when the
 working people of Russia,  headed by the
 Communist Party and guided by their great
 leaders, Lenin and Stalin, carried through the
 victorious Socialist Revolution. For the first
 time in the history of humanity the ideas of
 genuine freedom triumphed and in a land
 backward and oppressed under the barbarous
 tyranny of Czardom power passed into the
 hands of the people- the majority of the people,
 those who work, the real people, i.e., into the
 hands of the workers and peasants.
 Thirty-four years are gone by and the
 results of the People's Revolution in Russia
 have surpassed the boldest dreams cherished
 by the daring champions of progress of all ages
 who ever protested against the social order
 based on exploitation and oppression of man
 by man.
 The emergence of the Soviet  Republic
 split the world into  two  systems: thriving
 Socialism and moribund Capitalism; and it has
 been a factor of progressive debilitation and
 disintegration of imperialism, and a powerful
 inspiration for the peoples of the countries
 oppressed by imperialism in their struggle for
 independence.
 "For a new factor has risen", said J. V.
 Stalin, "such as the vast Soviet country, lying
 between West and East, between the centre
 of financial exploitation of the world and the
 arena of colonial oppression, a country which by
 its existence is revolutionising the whole world."
 The struggle between these two systems
 is the history of our day.
 Beacon of peace
 The imperialist rulers of the world have
 never accepted the right to peaceful existence
 of the first Socialist Republic of the world.
 Just when it was born Churchill organised the
 armed  intervention of fourteen  imperialist-
 Josh i
 capitalist nations, but the infant Red Army
 successfully smashed it.  Today, once again,
 the same British Tory imperialist Churchill
 is. the arch war-monger and chief advocate
 of the "policy of strength" against the USSR,
 under the leadership of the dominant imperia-
 list power of the day, the USA.
 On the other hand it, was no accident that
 on the very morrow of the Revolution, after
 proclaiming transfer of power to the working
 people, the first job the newly established
 Soviet Government did was to pass the historic
 decree on peace and appeal to the govern-
 ments and peoples of all the belligerent coun-
 tries to start immediate negotiations for the
 conclusion of a just and democratic peace.
 The declaration of the Soviet Government
 stated among other things:                                '
 "The government  considers  it the greatest of
 crimes against humanity to continue this war for the
 purpose of dividing up among the strong and rich
 nations the feeble nationalities they have conquered,
 and solemnly announces its determination immediately
 to sign terms of peace to stop this war on conditions
 indicated, which are equally just for all nationalities
 without exception."
 Might is now on the side of Right
 Strictly adhering to the principles proclaim-
 ed in October,  1917,  the Soviet State has
 been consistently and energetically fighting
 for peace among all nations, for the security
 of the peoples against aggression on the part
 of world imperialism.
 During the inter-war years, while  the
 imperialist powers helped to build up Hitler
 with a view to diverting Nazi armies to attack
 the USSR, the Soviet statesmen consistently
 fought to build up a system of collective security
 through the League of Nations.
 During the second world war, the peoples
 of the USSR not only suffered and sacrificed
 the most, but it was the valiant Red Armv

 Approved For Release 2001/09/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415R010200020024-9
 which made the major contribution and dealt
 those decisive blows which annihilated the
 vaunted military strength of the German and
 the Japanese armies.  The outstanding role of
 the USSR in World War II demonstrated even
 to the politically backward that Soviet advocacy
 of peace was not the result of Soviet weakness
 as the imperialists had persistently preached,
 but an outcome of its own internal strength,
 its love for humanity and faith in its own destiny.
 The experience of the last war has proved
 beyond any doubt that the USSR possesses
 the, military strength to defeat the aggressive
 designs of imperialist powers.
 1-?eace-loving peoples of the world can now feel
 confident that not only right is on their side but also
 the ne?ded might.
 After World War II, while the imperialist
 rulers of the USA have donned the Hitlerite
 mantle and aided by the rulers of Britain as
 junior partners are, once again busy plotting
 and planning for another world war, an im-
 perialist anti-Soviet war, the Soviet statesmen,
 inside and outside the UNO, are repeatedly
 making proposals for the conclusion of a pact
 of Peace among the great Five Powers to guaran-
 tee world peace, reduction in armaments, prohi-
 bition of the atomic weapon and the estab-
 lishment of international control over its imple
 mentation, and have initiated the  cease-fire
 talks in Korea.  In all this, in  simple and
 noble words    they confidently express   the
 mighty will of the Soviet people and     give
 rallying slogans to the peace-loving peoples
 of the world to defend the cause of world
 peace, defeat the criminal designs of would-be
 Hiders, and save humanity from an unprece-
 dented, holocaust.
 People's camp also possesses Atom
 The latest blow for peace from the Soviet
 Union is the timely statement of Stalin on
 the atom-bomb which has successfully disrup-
 ted the plan of the American  imperialists
 who had hoped to panic the rest of the capital-
 ist world into submission by flaunting their
 monopoly of the terrible weapon. Now there
 is panic on the other side, in the camp of
 the enemies of the people, reactionary rulers
 of capitalist  countries,  allies of American
 imperialism, who  are faced  with the grim
 reality  that  their    paymaster and  leader
 no more enjoys the  monopoly of the war-
 weapon which was supposed                             to be decisive
 against any army, including the Red Army.
 Now there is greater confidence in the multi-
 millioned peace partisans all over  the world,
 NOVEMBER 1951
 in their capacity to further isolate  the im-
 perialist war-mongers and win over to  the
 peace camp the hitherto vacillating and weak-
 minded.   Another  immediate   gain from
 Stalin's intervention has been that Korea has
 been saved a second time from becoming the
 victim of atom-bomb, which the Pentagon
 Chiefs were plotting as the only way out of the
 indomitable resistance of the Korean People's
 Army and the Chinese Volunteers.
 Every time our philosopher-ambassador to
 the USSR, Dr. Radhakrishuan, has come back
 for discussions to New Delhi, he has reported
 that the dominant passion of the Soviet Govern-
 ment is to save world peace and has in sincere
 words publicly stated that Stalin wants peace.
 The  Goodwill  Mission of our  writers and
 cultural workers  that has lately  returned
 from the USSR has come back overwhelmed
 with the universal desire of our Soviet neigh-
 bours for peace.
 For peaceful co-existence
 The guiding principle of the foreign policy
 of the USSR is peaceful co-existence of the
 two systems, Socialism and Capitalism.  "The
 idea of cooperation between the two systems
 was first expressed by Lenin," said Stalin,
 "Lenin is our teacher, and we Soviet people
 are Lenin's pupils.  We have never departed
 and never shall depart from Lenin's tea-
 chings."
 At the fourteenth Congress of the Commu-
 nist Party of Soviet Union (CPSU/Bl) in 1925
 Stalin said:
 "Underlying the policy of our Government, the
 foreign policy, is the idea of peace. Struggle for
 peace, struggle against new wars,-exposing the steps
 that under the banner of pacifism screen actual pre-
 paration for war, that is our task."
 In 1939, on the eve of the second world
 war, the following emphatic pronouncement
 was made by Stalin from the platform of the
 18th Congress of the CPSU(B) :
 "We stand for peace and the strengthening of
 business relations with all countries.  That is our
 position and we shall adhere to this position as long
 as these countries maintain like relations with the
 Soviet Union and as long as they make no attempt
 to trespass on the interests of our county.
 In 1946, answering a question put to him
 by the Moscow Correspondent of the arch-
 conservative Sunday Times whether in view of
 the USSR's onward march to Communism, it

 Approved For Release 2001/09/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415R010200020024-9
 was possible for the Soviet Union to cooperate
 with the outside world, Stalin said:
 "I do not doubt the possibilities of peaceful co-
 operation; far from decreasing they may even grow."
 In May, 1948, in answer to Henry Wallace's
 open letter, Stalin wrote:
 "....the Government of the USSR believes that
 despite the differences in economic systems and ideolo-
 gies the co-existence of these systems and the peaceful
 settlement of differences between the USSR and the
 USA are not only possible but absolutely necessary
 in the interests of universal peace."
 No interference in others' internal affairs
 Marxism-Leninism  teaches  us  that  a
 revolutionary upheaval and the victory of
 Socialism in one or another country primarily
 results from the development of internal forces
 in that country.  In 1936, in a conversation
 with Roy Howard, a representative of the
 American press, Stalin stated:
 "We Marxists believe that a revolution will
 also take place in other countries.  But it will
 take place only when the revolutionaries in these
 countries think it possible or necessary.  The ex-
 port of revolution is nonsense.  Every country will
 make its own revolution if it wants to and if it does
 not want to there will be no revolution.
 "For example, our country wanted to make a
 revolution and made it, and now we are building
 classless society.  But to assert that we want to
 make a revolution in other countries, to interfere in
 their lives, means saying what is untrue, and what
 we have never advocated".
 It is an essential postulate of Soviet policy
 that the internal regime of each  country is
 primarily the concern of the people of that
 country and as long as the two systems-
 Socialism and Capitalism-co-exist, let them
 peacefully cooperate and  that  system will
 ultimately triumph which is sounder, stronger
 and more acceptable to the people.
 Ever since the birth of the USSR, the
 Soviet leadership has consistently advocated
 the policy  of  peaceful  co-existence.  This
 fact demonstrates the boundless self-confidence
 of the  Soviet leaders.  But ever since the
 victory of the Russian Revolution, the central
 guiding point of the foreign policy of imperial-
 ist powers has been to hammer together mili-
 tary and political alliances to isolate and en-
 circle the USSR, paving the way for a war of
 aggression against it, with the aim of liquida-
 ting Socialism and restoring Capitalism in
 Russia.  This demonstrates the inherent weak-
 ness and wickedness of imperialist rulers.
 The crux of the world situation as it has
 faced our generation is  that the leaders of
 world capitalism turn down Soviet challenge
 for peaceful competition on the basis of out-
 lawing war.
 Imperialist camp Immensely weakened
 It is primarily because of the existence
 and achievements of the USSR that the camp
 of World imperialism is immensely  weaker
 despite all the efforts of the imperialist rulers.
 The valour and skill of the Red Army was the
 decisive factor in World War II that le;d to
 the annihilation of three imperialist pow4-rs-
 Germany, Italy and Japan.  In the posh-war
 period, the very first major venture or the
 imperialist camp, headed by the US, has turnec'1
 into a military debacle and a diplomatic fiasco.
 The imperialist armies have been fought to
 a stand-still in Korea without the intervention
 of the Red Army.  Pressure of world opinion
 has forced America's war-mad statesmen to
 talk peace and enter into armistice negotiations.
 The American pretenders to world domina-
 tion are face to face with man-power crisis
 even during their Korean dress-rehearsal. Du-
 ring the year Chinese Volunteers have fought
 in Korea, 3,87,000 imperialist troops have been
 killed or wounded, including 1,76,000 Ameri-
 cans.  And during the second week of Octo-
 ber, the rate of imperialist casualties has risen
 to the unprecedented figure of 5,600 men per
 day. America's puppets want all the dollars
 they can get from their Washington masters
 but they just cannot persuade their people to
 become the American canon-fodder in far off
 Korea. And more, American strategists are
 even faced with an air-force crisis, because a
 total of 2,310 planes have been shot down or
 damagaed in Korea.
 Soviet strength makes peace possible
 On the other hand, the  camp of peace,
 democracy and Socialism is immensely stron-
 ger?                                                                 The   victorious  Russian  Revolution
 hoisted the Red flag over the Kremlin, thirty-
 four years ago.  It is primarily because of
 what the Russian Revolution has meant to
 the world we live in, that today the Red flag
 flies over the vast region from Peking to Prague.
 The frontiers of the Socialist world have ex-
 panded and of the imperialist world have
 correspondingly   shrunk.   Emphasising   the
 implication of this decisive shift in the balance
 of world forces, Prime  Minister of People's
 China, Chou En-lai stated on November 2,

 in his report to the National Committee of
 People's Political Consultative Council, that
 the  Western imperialist  powers will  meet
 with "total defeat," if they started World War
 III. "The  alliance between  China      and
 Russia which embraces one-third of world's
 population is an  invincible  force unprece-
 dented in history.  An utterly corrupt and
 fundamentally shaky imperialism is struggling
 for existence."
 The international weight of the Soviet
 Union makes it a mighty bastion of peace.
 If the peace-loving peoples of the world link
 their efforts with the peace policy of the So-
 viet, the diabolical aggressive plans of Anglo-
 US imperialism can be successfully disrupt-
 ed  and  reduced  into  paper plans.  The
 experience of the two world  wars in one
 generation coupled with growing faith in the
 strength, sincerity and peaceful policy of the
 USSR, has already led to the birth of a unique,
 world-wide, multi-millioned, organised Peace
 Movement.  In the first half of our  century
 the imperialist rulers could befool the people
 and were in a position to start world wars.
 In the second half of our century, however,
 advanced elements in every country are out
 to impose world peace on the rulers of all coun-
 tries -and millions upon millions consider the
 preservation of peace a practical and realisa-
 ble aim and are seeking to achieve it.
 Such is the historic turn in the situation
 that has been made possible by the consistent
 advocacy of world peace by the Soviet Union
 for 34 long years.
 An emancipatory force
 The cause of peace  against imperialist
 aggressors has been immensely strengthened
 by basing it upon support to the right of self-
 determination for every nation, its right to
 independent national existence.  Stalin states:
 "The October Revolution is the first revolution
 in the world that has broken the sleep of centuries of
 the toiling masses of the oppressed peoples of the East
 and drawn them into the struggle against World
 Imperialism."
 Czarist Russia was a prison-house of peo-
 ples.  The October Revolution boldly con-
 ceded  and  constitutionally  guaranteed  the
 right of self-determination, including secession,
 to every nationality and thus transformed the
 old decrepit Russian Empire into the Union
 of Socialist Soviet  Republics.  The rise of
 the Soviet Republics in the East in place of
 the puppet Khanates of the past became a
 miracle for the rest of the colonial world.  The
 unity of the Soviet family of nations was tested
 during World War II and it proved its worth
 by demonstrating its stability in a manner
 unknown to history so far.  From the grand
 post-war plans and projects of construction
 of the Soviet Government it is the Soviet Re-
 publics of the East which will gain the most.
 Such is the fraternal aid, from the more ad-
 vanced to the  more                                                                            backward, inside the
 USSR, in striking contrast to the American
 infliction of the Marshall  Plan on its allies.
 Simultaneously with declaring the right
 of self-determination for all the nations living
 inside the old Russian Empire, the newly
 established  Soviet  Government  renounced
 all the concessions and privilleges Czarism had
 extorted from the neighbouring countries, e.g.,
 'Turkey, Persia and China, etc.  Such unsel-
 fishness was unknown in earlier history.                                                                          It
 was practised for the first time by the first So-
 cialist Republic of the world and Marx's memo-
 rable words that a nation that enslaves another
 can never itself be free were implemented in
 real life by the victorious Russian Bolsheviks.
 The Soviet Government not only liberated
 those whom the old ruling class had subjugated
 but also went to the fraternal aid of those of
 its struggling  neighbours whom irnperialists
 sought to keep enslaved.
 To give only one example, emerging out
 of the  ashes of the   old Ottoman Empire,
 Kemalist Turkey would never have retained its
 independence except for the recognition and
 support given by the Soviet Government.
 Without the fraternal aid of the Red Army
 the nations of Eastern Europe  were in no
 position to  emancipate  themselves  from
 Hitler's clutches.  It was Soviet neighbourhood
 and prompt alliance with the USSR which
 enabled the birth  of People's Republics in
 these countries and prevented the restoration
 of old feudal-capitalist regimes as their own
 puppets by the Anglo-American armies.
 Similarly, the Mao leadership has repeated-
 ly and gratefully admitted that were it  not
 for the new light and inspiration from the
 Russian Revolution and concrete  moral and
 material aid from the Land of Soviets, the
 Chinese Revolution would not     have been
 victorious so soon.
 Influence on Indian national movement
 The impact of the  Russian Revolution
 on the Indian national movement was no
 less strong though not so decisive because the
 Indian bourgeois leadership was  too closely
 linked with the British and its fear of a real

 People's Revolution was greater than its hatred
 of the British rule.
 Lenin hailed the political initiative of the
 Indian working class when in Bombay it struck
 work, against the arrest of Lokmanya Tilak,
 early in the century.  The day the  Indian
 working class was born, the teacher and guide
 of the revolutionary working class of the world
 promptly noted its significance.
 After World War I, as the Indian freedom
 movement began  acquiring a mass    basis,
 Lenin and Stalin looked towards it with great
 hope and with prophetic vision pointed out
 that the path of our advance to victory lay
 along the lines of adopting an irreconcilable
 revolutionary line against the imperialist rulers,
 heightening the   democratic  content of our
 movement by going all out to liquidate feudal-
 ism in our land                        relations which grounded
 down the vast majority of our people, the
 peasantry, and served as the   social base of
 the alien rulers, and finally, step by step, in
 dislodging the compromising bourgeois leader-
 ship from the position. of leadership.
 It is necessary  to recall over and over
 again these historic formulations for they alone
 correctly and scientifically summate our na-
 tional experience and help to  explain the
 ignominous  debacle  of  August  15,  1947,
 symbolised in the slogans: Pandit Mountbatfm
 ki Jail Lord Nehru ki ,Jai!
 We start learning from Russia
 The failure of the        first non-cooperation
 movement under the     Gandhian  leadership
 led to the birth of a Left Wing and all sections
 of the movement began to think afresh.  After
 our own miserable failure, only  the blind
 would not have looked towards Russia., the
 land of successful  Revolution. Pandit Moti
 Lal and Jawaharlal Nehru went to Moscow
 to attend the tenth anniversary of the Novem-
 ber Revolution.  After this visit Pandit Jawa-
 harlal Nehru widely popularised the ideas
 that the Soviet Union from its very  nature
 had no aggressive designs against any other
 nation and that Lenin's heirs had all their sym-
 pathy for Indian national aims and that they
 were busy building up their country on new
 foundations.  The  interest  in "the Russian
 experiment" grew  in our country.  It was
 carried a stage further when Tagore visited
 the Soviet Union in early  thirties and his
 informative, human, and thrilling Letters from
 Russia were published.
 After the second major failure of the  Gan.
 dhian leadership, during the struggle of the
 early thirties,  the  Indian Leftists'  interest
 in the teachings of communism grew rapidly.
 The United Front line of the Seventh Cong-
 ress of the Communist International, of build-
 ing a world wide Peace Front  against                                                                            the
 rising menace of fascism  (after Hiler's rise
 to power and Jap aggression in China) and a
 United National Front in every colonial coun-
 try for national  liberation,  received  wide
 response.  The influence of this tactical policy
 of international Communism on the Presiden-
 tial address of Nehru at the Lucknow session
 of the Congress and in the documents of the
 Faizpur session was noted by reactionaries
 and democrats alike.  As a result our move-
 ment revived and  acquired a broad-sweep
 and the interest in Socialism grew on a mass
 scale.
 The political  deadlock  during the war
 years revealed  that  the  Indian  bourgeois
 leadership  had no real faith in the libera-
 tionist role of the USSR, but thought it more
 realistic to manouvre  between  the  British
 rulers and their Jap rivals and the net result
 was that the cunning British imperialist crude-
 ly provokde  and  cleverly  out-manoeuvred
 it and successfully imposed political deadlock
 throughout the war years.
 After the war, when the allied statesmen were
 discussing the foundation of the UNO and the
 British rulers had India represented by their
 stooges while they had kept the Indian na-
 tional leaders behind the bars, Molotov caused
 a   world-wide  sensation  and  thrilled every
 Indian patriot when    he  declared  that the
 Soviet Government     expected that represen-
 tatives of an independent India would soon
 be representing India in the UNO.
 After formation of Congress Government
 After the formation of the Congress Govern-
 ment, whenever Indian -representatives have
 taken a stand in defence of the democra-
 tic rights of our nationals  abroad, or in the
 interests of colonial peoples or of world peace,
 Soviet representatives have heartily welcomed
 and warmly  supported us.  Stalin's  prompt
 response to Nehru's peace initiative for ending
 the Korean War, and the Chinese gratitude for
 the Indian stand for China's rightful place in
 the UNO  exposed the aggressive and lurid
 nature of the US aims and demonstrated to the
 peace-loving and freedom-loving world how
 fraternal cooperation between India, People's
 China and the USSR could become a firm
 guarantee of World Peace and Asian freedom.
 This, however, is only one part of the picture.

 sought to assuage American imperialist fears
 by showing how Indian representatives had
 only thrice voted with the USSR as against
 so many more times with the USA and quite
 often remained neutral. For opportunist rea-
 sons the Nehru Government plays between
 the two camps, the camp of war and imperia-
 lism and that of peace and anti-imperialism.
 The possibilities inherent in the  present
 situation because of the liberationist role played
 by the USSR were vividly described by Mao
 Tse-tung :
 "Comrades, since the victory of the great October
 Soviet Socialist Revolution, a victorious situation
 has definitely been established for the people of the
 world .... If any other imperialist country tries to
 tread the old path taken by the three former aggre-
 ssors-Germany, Italy and Japan-cart we not fully
 predict the result ?  In a word, the future world
 :MUST be a people's world.  The countries of the
 world must be, governed by the people's of these
 countries themselves. The world certainly cannot
 any longer be tyrannised over by imperialism and
 its lackeys."
 Guarantee of prosperous and cultured life
 The  October          Revolution  "brought  the
 people not only freedom, but also material
 benefits and the possibility of a prosperous
 and cultured life."   (Stalin)
 The nationalisation of land, large-scale
 industry, railways and banks and the institu-
 tion                   of foreign trade monopoly-all of it
 together laid the foundation for planned social-
 ist economy.  The working peasantry received
 from the Soviet state gratis 150,000,000 hectares
 of land which before had belonged to landlords,
 bourgeoisie, the Czar's family and the Church.
 The new Socialist economy which is develop-
 ing according to plan, knows no crisis, unem-
 ployment, starvation and ruin.  It is growing
 with a tempo unknown in any other country
 before.  A steady rise in the living standards
 of the people has become a cardinal law of the
 economic development of the Soviet society.
 In the USSR, the entire national income is
 fully at the disposal of the working masses them-
 selves.                            The national income of the USSR in
 1940 was six times above that of pre-revolutionary
 times, in 1950 it was 64% above 1940 level.
 The incomes of the working people  are
 systematically growing in the USSR; wages
 of factory and office workers increased more
 than five times over from 1929 to 1940. The
 incomes of factory and office workers and
 .
 peasants in 1950 were 62% above 1940.
 working day in Soviet factories and offices and
 a seven to six hour day in a number of trades.
 A working day of four hours has been fixed
 for those engaged in injurious trades.
 An  advanced  State  Social  Insurance
 System prevails and in addition to money
 wages, the  people of the  USSR    receive
 various benefits and privileges at the expense
 of the state (free medical aid, free education,
 free technical training, stipends to students,
 allowances to mothers of large families, etc.)
 The USSR has now become a country of
 universal literacy; while on the eve of the
 Revolution in Russia only 30% of the popu-
 lation were 'able to read and write.    The
 number of pupils in general schools and special-
 ised secondary schools amounts to 37 millions,
 nearly five times as many as in Czarist Russia.
 Projects of Communism
 But all these grand achievements of Socialism
 triumphant will pale into insignificance when
 the new Stalin projects of building Communism
 are completed, when the Soviet Union success-
 fully makes the transition from the present
 stage of Socialism ("from each according to his
 capacity,  to each according to his work") to
 the stage of Communism "from each according
 to his capacity to each according to his needs".
 Socialism has released new, unprecedented,
 creative energy of the million-fold masses,
 energy capable of changing the course of rivers,
 of bringing life to deserts, reviving land, and of
 realising the most daring dreams of mankind.
 The Soviet Union has begun work on the greatest
 construction of modern times, creating a power-
 ful production-technical base of Communism.
 The huge power installations on the Volga,
 Dneiper and Amu Darya will have a capa-
 city that will exceed by far the over-all capacity
 of 30 of the biggest power stations in the USA
 which took decades to build.  Their capacity
 will be four times greater than that of all the
 hydro-electric stations in South America.
 The newly  planned Turkmenian, South
 Ukrainian, North Crimean and Volga-Don
 canals will be the greatest in the world and
 link up for navigation purposes all the oceans
 and seas that girdle the USSR.  In the next
 5 to 7 years, over 28 million hectares of land in
 the USSR will be brought under irrigation,
 that is, an area seventeen times greater than
 the entire crop area of Denmark, 30  times
 that of the Netherlands, and 53 times that
 of Belgium.  This area could   accommodate
 five such countries as Great Britain, Belgium,
 Approved For Release 2001/09/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415RO10200020024-9
 AUpproved For Release 2001/09/10
 Holland,   enmark and Switzerland taken to-
 gether. The new irrigated lands alone can pro-
 vide everything needed to ensure a life of well-
 being for a hundred million people.   The
 grandeur of these projects is seen from the fact
 that the USA after hundreds of years' work has
 but eight million hectares of irrigated land.
 The words of the great Lenin that the
 economic  policy  of  Sovietland  exerts a
 powerful influence on the development of the,
 struggle of the working people against imperial-
 ist bondage sound with particular force today :
 "All look to the Soviet Russian Republic, all
 working people in all countries of the world, without
 exception and without any exaggeration."
 Economic co-operation as equals
 Socialism has meant not only prosperity for
 the people that achieved it, but also fraternal
 economic aid to the nations that break away
 from the imperialist orbit and seek its coopera-
 tion for upbuilding their national economies.
 Unlike the reactionary  rulers of Western.
 .Europe, the leaders of Eastern  European
 states refused to accept the enslaving terms of
 the Marshall Plan and sought Soviet aid to
 rehabilitate their economies devastated during
 the war under Nazi occupation and it was
 readily given.  It is because of Soviet assistance
 that in bare six years they have passed from the
 stage of rehabilitation to that of building the
 foundations of a socialist future for their peoples.
 The leaders of New China gratefully admit
 that without the selfless assistance  given in
 the form of technicians and      machinary, the
 marvel  of Chinese  National  Construction
 would not have been possible in that record
 quick time when compared with 1949? increa-
 sed 11.4 fold, steel 7.8 fold and output of diffe-
 rent kinds of machinery has more than. trebled.
 The Indian Government's efforts to seek
 help for the  industrialisation of India are
 confined to knocking at the doors of White-
 hall and White House or their satellites in
 western Europe. The leading Indian industrial-
 ists too cannot think of others besides British
 and American monopolists for getting machine
 tools and technical assistance and are  being
 called upon to agree to fantastic and ensla-
 ving terms.  Session  after session of UNE-
 CAFE has revealed that the aim of Anglo-
 American rulers  is not to aid but to hinder
 the industrialisation of backward Asian nations
 and intensify their colonial exploitation.  The
 Colombo Plan has put in black and white
 the economic counter-part of the Mount-
 batten Plan :
 The concentrations on the "development
 CIA-RDP83-00415R010200020024-9
 of agriculture  "  without  touching  feudal
 land relations and without giving land to the
 tiller only means more intensive exploitation
 of our peasantry and retention of India prima-
 rily as the producer of raw materials and as an
 agrarian hinterland of the doininent economy
 of imperialist countries.
 The development of Indian transport only
 hnplies strengthening it for the strategic war
 purposes of the imperialists.
 Giving the last place and least attention to
 industries implies perpetuating the  existing
 economic colonial backwardness of our economy.
 Soviet offer of aid
 In the latest session of the UNECAFE, at
 Colombo on October 12, the Soviet represen-
 tative not only exposed the imperialist policy
 of perpetuating the dependent, backward and
 colonial character of the  economies of the
 Asian countries but made the declaration that
 the USSR was prepared to help the industria-
 lisation of Asian countries and the independent
 development of their national economies by
 supplying  machinery in exchange of their
 raw material produce on mutually acceptable
 purely business basis.
 It is not only a general offer but is being
 rapidly and concretely implemented and fortu-
 nately the first country to which the Soviets
 have paid attention is our own.
 The  press  reports  that  a  couple of
 Soviet ships are bringing machinery of all
 sorts as well as consumer goods to be publicly
 demonstrated in a Soviet pavillion at the
 International Industries Fair to be orga-
 nised towards the end of the next month in
 Bombay.  Those of the national capitalists of
 India, genuinely interested in industrialising
 the country, who were so for being starved of
 machinery, the know-how and the technical
 personnel by the Anglo-American monopolists,
 have now the chance of their  lives opened
 before them. The Indian people who were so far
 being fed on the myth that  the USSR was
 either unwilling or in no position to help in
 the industrialisation of India will be able to
 see through the hoax with   their own eyes
 and will be encouraged to demand the necessary
 changes in the Government policy.
 Progressive Indian opinion has noted the
 sharp difference in Soviet and American offers
 of wheat.  The Soviet Government  began
 dispatching ship-loads even before business
 terms had been settled, on the mere word of
 the Indian Ambassador that a great famine
 threatened our country and every day counted.
 American reactionary rulers sought to exploit

 our famine situation  to blackmail us into
 changing our foreign policy.  The  contrast
 in their attitude towards aiding our industrial-
 isation is still more glaring, it is the difference
 between black and white.
 It is in this backgriound that the World
 Peace Council has convened a World Economic
 Conference at Moscow on the basis that economic
 co-operation between nations is one of the
 surest guarantees of preserving world peace..
 It is reported that a fairly  influential dele-
 gation of Indian industrialists and businessmen
 is becoming interested and will respond to the
 invitation.  It is understood that the Soviet
 attitude to trade with India is :  Tell us what
 you need and sell us in return what you don't need
 for yoursef  No nation can desire a better
 offer.
 Make the choice
 Years back, in 1923, the prophetic vision
 of the great Lenin had foreseen that "in the
 last analysis the upshot of the struggle will be deter-
 mined by the fact that Russia, India and China,
 etc., account for the overwhelming majority of the
 population of the globe."
 By 1951 the imperialists have realised the
 danger to themselves in the three of us getting
 together much more clearly  than the Indian
 people yet understand the grand  prospect
 before them contained in the Leninist pers-
 pective  above.  The  central  point in                        the
 Anglo-American imperialist attitude towards
 India is to prevent at all costs such a perspective
 materialising.  That is the condition on which
 they "transferred power" on August -15, 1947,
 and ensured India's remaining within the
 British Empire.  That is why they talk of
 making Nehru their leader of Asia.  That is
 why they alternate blackmail with cajolery
 and a tough Loy Hendereson is followed by a
 liberal Bowles.
 The coming    general  elections will  be
 the first nation-wide political action of the
 Indian people.  It will be the supreme task
 of progressive Indian parties to ask the Congress
 ruling class some leading questions and call
 upon the Indian people to judge aright.
 How is the foreign policy of the Indian
 Government a genuine peace  policy  when
 the Indian representatives at the UNO take
 pains to demarcate themselves from the Soviet
 peace policy and seek to water down or
 radically amend the clear-cut peace proposals of
 the USSR representatives.  How is it not
 flirting between the camps of peace and war "?
 How is the Far Eastern and Middle Eastern
 policy of the Indian Government worthy of
 a freedom loving major Asian nation when
 it sends an ambulance to serve the American
 aggressors in Korea; when  instead of recog-
 nising the Ho Chi Minh Government it lets the
 French imperialists use  Indian air ports and
 their bases at Pondicherry, etc., to carry on their
 dirty war in Viet-Nam; when it permits Gurkhas
 to go and fight for the British enslavers in
 Malaya; when it supplies arms and ammuni-
 tions  to Thakin Nu to prosecute Civil War
 in Burma; when it remains silent over the Anglo-
 American intrigues to grab Iran's oil; when
 the Egyptian leaders have to appeal for the
 moral support of India before Nehru would
 deign to express his sympathy with Egypt?
 How is the Indian Government pursuing
 an independent economic policy when it surren-
 ders to the American ban against entering into
 closer economic relations with the USSR and
 the People's Democracies?
 The only path before India
 Our people spontaneously realise that their
 destined place is with the USSR and China
 and against the imperialist camp.  The tradi-
 tion of our national movement is also pro-
 Soviet and pro-China and anti-imperialist.
 Our people have to be roused against the
 pro-imperialist opportunist foreign policy of
 the Indian Government.  Our people have to
 be won for the policy of India-China-Soviet
 friendship.  Firm  India-China-Soviet coope-
 ration  for world  peace  will  successfully
 disrupt the Anglo-American imperialist aim
 of dragging the world into World War III and
 every nation will get the best chance to earn
 its future according to its own genius and
 strength.
 Fraternal India-China-Soviet cooperation,
 when the whole of the colonial world from
 Korea to Cairo is passing th rough an unprece-
 dented popular upsurge, can compel the im-
 perialists to quit Asia.
 Mutually beneficial India-China-Soviet eco-
 nomic cooperation can help us solve our food
 crisis and get the means to industrialise our
 country.
 The path to Indian prosperity, Asian freedom
 and world peace lies through India-China-Soviet
 alliance. On this 34th anniversary of the Russian
 Revolution, a month after the second anniversary of
 Chinese liberation and after our own four year's
 experience of the Mountbatten Plan,   this path
 stands out as the only alternative to acting  the
 miserable fly in the traditional imperialist spider's
 web.

 Electoral Situation in Bengal
 From Our Correspondent
 The  very mention  of Bengal  stirs  senti-
 ments.                        It has faced  calamity after  cala-
 mity-famine,                             epidemics     and  then  parti-
 tion.                 It is scarred with suffering and yet
 Bengal's is not a tale of tears. The Bengali
 has always fought back and in a manner as to
 command the respect of all.    If the British
 rulers inflicted the horrible famine in 1943,
 the Bengali peasant had his revenge when 60
 lakhs rose like an endless tide in the mighty
 Tebhaga movement of 1946.      If the then
 Governor Casey through his long talks with
 Mahatma Gandhi in Calcutta laid the basis
 for Mountbatten-Nehru Settlement, the patriotic
 people of Bengal unleashed the INA upsurge
 which acclaimed as national heroes the very
 persons the British wanted to shoot as traitors.
 In vain endeavour to drown popular discontent,
 the  Congress  Ministry could shoot helpless
 Communist detenus inside the jails or inno-
 cent, unarmed citizens on the streets of Cal-
 cutta but the result has been that not one of
 Bengal's Ministers dare face a public meeting
 from 1949 upto date.
 Bengal has always been more Left than the.
 rest of India.  Where does it exactly stand
 today on the eve of elections ?
 Calcutta and the industrial belt
 Bengal and its immediate neighbourhood
 is the most industrialised part of India but
 British capital dominates the main industries,
 e.g., jute, plantations, coal.  The burra sahebs
 of British Managing Agencies are  carrying
 on exactly as before, the only difference is
 that  on ceremonial occasions the Tricolour
 flies in front of their offices instead of the Union
 Jack.  They "trust" B. C. Roy more than
 they trust any other Bengali.
 B. C. Roy Ministry is a one-man show,
 other ministers are nowhere near being his
 equals. And everyone in Calcutta calls B. C.
 Roy Birla's man.  The most popular description
 of the Ministry is a gang of thieves.  There is
 a chronic food and cloth crisis and stories of
 all-round corruption are household gossip.
 Workers and employees have known no
 wage-increase after what they won through
 the first post-war strike-wave (1945-47) and
 subsequent Tribunal-Awards.  Even after the
 steep rise in the cost of living after the Korean
 War, they have not received any increased
 dearness allowance.
 Retrenchment and rationalisation is taking
 place in  every office and factory.  Nobody
 feels secure in his job.  Younger men out of'
 college are swelling the ranks of the unemplo-
 yed.
 Every housewife  curses the Government
 in juicy terms when the women start com-
 paring notes on prices of daily necessities.
 Whenever a Communist cadre meets an old
 aunt or elderly friends of the family, the inevi-
 table question asked is:  When will it end, son
 What are you doing about it ?
 Every clerk's family is in debt by the last
 week of the month.
 Thus radicalisation has spread on a mass
 scale  among  Calcutta's middle  class.  The
 common talk in local trains, trams and buses
 is that the Congress Ministry must go:   The
 weakness of the situation is that here the unani-
 mity ends.  Even the more enlightened city
 folks are not clear about the alternative. Some-
 times their attention gets diverted by what
 reaction does in Pakistan.  But life brings
 them back face to face with real issues and their
 discontent against the Congress Government
 goes on mounting higher and higher.
 In Calcutta and district towns Communist
 Party and Left meetings are best attended.
 People sit for hours listening.  They seek an
 alternative path and are trying to  come to
 their own conclusions.
 In rural areas
 The British rulers imposed on Bengal the
 most  reactionary feudal  land tenure--the
 permanent settlement. Congress Ministries in
 other provinces have at least talked of agrarian
 reforms but the Congress Ministry of Bengal
 has just sat upon the agrarian problem.
 Government procurement policy  is such
 that the peasant is denied a fair price and
 literally fleeced.  He is paid Rs. 7/ 8/ - per
 maund for his paddy but the Government
 sells it at Rs. 13/6/- to Rs. 16/- per maund.
 And when the landless and poor peasants have
 to buy rice they have to pay Rs. 25/- to 30/-
 at least.  In some areas the price goes up to
 10                                                                  INDIA TO-DAY

 gular conflict. The KMPP and CPI candidates
 between themselves polled' a total of about
 11 thousand (5 thousand and odd each).  The
 Congress candidate polled only 8 thousand
 and odd but won because of the split in the
 democratic opposition votes.
 Malda experience swung the KP/IPP to-
 wards unity with the Communists. The KMPP
 leader Dr. P. C. Ghosh, as Chief Minister
 had begun the Ordinance Raj and the lathi-
 charging and shooting of demonstrators which
 later Dr. B. C. Roy carried forward more
 cynically and  brutally.  Other  top  leaders
 of the KMPP like Dr. Suresh Bannerji, and
 Syt. Deben Sen had, as the top leaders of the
 INTUC,  slandered  Red    Flag   trade union
 leaders, helped  the Government to break
 strikes,  etc.,  etc.  But as a realist bourgeois
 leaderhip they easily saw from the victories
 of Howrah and Chandernagore and the defeat
 of Malda that without unity with the Commu-
 nists, Congress could not be defeated, nor their
 plans of forming an alternative Ministry be rea-
 lised. After long and serious discussion among
 themselves, the KMPP leadership approached
 the Communists for electoral unity.
 The Communist leadership reminded them
 of their earlier policy statements where they
 had declared that their aim was to fight the
 Communists and Communalists alike.  They
 promised to change it and on the 1st of Sep-
 tember they publicly rescinded their earlier
 stand and began advocating the need for unity
 with  the  Communists.  Their  argument is
 simple:  If we two unite we can defeat the Congress
 in Bengal.
 As united  front relations     between the
 CPI and the KMPP developed,    other Left
 parties also swung decisively for unity. Some
 of the RSP leaders had tried to forge an anti-
 Congress and anti-Communist bloc through
 the USOI but failed.  The most eager for
 unity was the Marxist Forward Bloc.  The
 USOI  could  not promptly  and decisively
 take definite positions because of the predomi-
 nance of smaller parties within it.                          So there
 was talk for a while whether electoral united
 front should not be confined to KMPP, CPI,
 FB and RSP as the four major parties who
 really matter.  This would have broken up the
 USOI and upset the smaller groups within
 it.  The CPI leadership took the wise stand
 that the four bigger parties could be the basis
 of united front but smaller parties should be
 included in it.  Discussions  were  compli-
 cated but they did lead in early October to a
 formal electoral alliance between the KMPP,
 CIA-RDP83-00415R010200020024-9
 the CPI and the USOI.
 Anti-Communist front
 It is not that there are no "Left" disruptors
 in Bengal. The Socialist  Party has linked up
 with the splinter Leela Roy Forward Biockists,
 the so-called Revolutionary Communist Party
 (RCPI-Tagore wing) and they call themselves
 the "Socialist Front" !   Their main slogan is
 "No truck with the Communists".  The people
 of Bengal don't think much of these Ameri-
 can-brand anti-Communists  for they know
 that an electoral United Front which instead
 of including  the Communists     is  directed
 .against them is dirty business. This unholy
 'Combination has not much influence either.
 Socialist Party leaders approached those
 of the KNIPP and tried to blackmail them
 with the threat: If you have united front with
 the Communists, we will expose you.  They
 ere put in their place by the KMPP people.
 Recently  when  Ashok  Metha  came to
 Calcutta, he was upset by the sight of Marxist
 classics being sold at every street-corner stall
 in Calcutta.  In his public speech he cursed
 the intellectual decadence of present  da)
 Bengal and promised the Bengalis that his
 Party will produce real educattional material
 for them.    One can imagine the devastating
 elect of such a statement on the sensitive
 Bengals intellegentia !
 Later J. P. too came to Calcutta and held
 a Press Conference and when he came io his
 favourite theme of anti-Communism the press
 correspondents put their pencils down  and
 looked either bored or amused.  J. P. lost:
 his temper and the story made the round of
 Calcutta.
 Socialist leaders  are  at  their wits' end
 discussing how to penetrate Bengali intelli-
 gentsia "corrupted                                                                                    by Communism".  Their
 American literature is not proving very helpful
 Discussion over minimum programme
 The Communist leaders suggested to their
 electoral allies  that minimum electoral pro-
 gramme be discussed.
 In informal discussions with the  KMPP
 leaders following points emerged
 Unite to defeat the Congress.
 Tight corruption and black-marketeers.
 Fight For Civil Liberties.
 Repeal Public Security Act. Release all political
 prisoners.
 Abolition  of landlordism with  compensation.

 small sum will have to be given as compensa-
 tion but it can be given in 40 to 50 yearly
 instalments.
 Nationalisation of Jute industry, with guarantee
 to Indian share-holders that they will get their
 dividends as fixed by the State.
 The KMPP leaders claim to have no love
 for the British  Commonwealth but hesitate
 to agree in writing to the demand of leaving
 the Commonwealth.  They argue that it is
 an All-India affair, and cannot be decided by
 Bengal alone. They also ask whether it is not
 more advisable to stay inside the Common-
 wealth when we can pursue an independent
 foreign policy.  They agree that they would
 not propagate for staying within the Common-
 wealth.
 'T'hey are not for confiscating but control-
 ling British capital.  They want to  ensure
 that no part of British capital is able to leave
 India.
 The Communist leaders took the stand
 that there are several points of agreement to
 form the basis of an agreed minimum pro-
 gramme but more discussions would be needed.
 The USOI parties were not keen at first
 on any minimum programme but wanted
 the electoral alliance to only arrange a division
 of seats without any political commitments.
 When the discussions began, they pressed for
 "nationalisation of key and basic industries."
 The CPI  programme  stands only  for the
 confiscation of British capital.  In these dis-
 cussions the CPI spokesmen stated that the
 CPI also stood for this demand but not in the
 last stage of the Revolution and that the
 Party will be strictly guided  by  experience.
 Let this standpoint of CPI be noted in the
 document of the minimum programme. 'Thus
 this hurdle could be overcome.
 As regards foreign policy most of the Left
 parties want to pledge friendly alliance with the
 USSR and China, but the KMPP wants to
 stick  to  neutrality.  All  except some  KSP
 leaders stand for strengthening the movement
 for World Peace.  Solidarity with China is
 the most popular item.
 Division of seats
 There are 238 seats in all and all the demo-
 cratic parties are concentrating on about 150
 seats which are in politically more advanced
 areas.  The danger lies in the fact that in the
 rest of the seats, in the darker rural regions,
 Congress may have an easy walk over.
 The one aim of the electoral united front
 is to avoid triangular conflict and face the
 Congress with a united democratic opposi-
 Approved For Release 2001/09/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415RO10200020024-9
 tion. This makes  the  division of  seats
 among the opposition parties a very tough
 affair.
 Division of seats in Calcutta is the hardest.
 Leaders of all parties want safe seats in Cal-
 cutta.                                                                   There are 26 seats in all  and the
 Left influence dominates in 12-15 constituen-
 cies.
 In the countryside all the democratic
 parties are concentrated in politically advanced
 areas and do not want to go to open up new
 areas during the elections and this brings
 about conflict of interests.
 The Communists are keenest on unity
 and are acting as the bridge  between the
 KMPP and  the USOI  parties and their
 leaders smilingly  state: All we are getting
 for our unity efforts for the time  being, is
 that the other parties want more seats at our
 cost.
 Narrow sectarianism is raising its head
 in two different forms when cadres of Left
 parties come face to face with the problem
 of division of seats.  Communist cadres ask
 their leaders:  Why should we give up our
 safe seats and why to KMPP  leaders who
 did this and that to us in the  past"  Many
 of the KMPP candidates are not very desirable
 and Communist cadres ask:     Is the united
 front to push up fellows like these? Sectarian-
 ism of other parties expresses itself in their
 hesitation to sacrifice seats but claim more
 than their real influence warrants.
 The negotiations are reaching the  final
 stage and it is hoped that the  KMPP and
 the USOI parties will not break away over
 differences over seats.
 The role of the Communist Party
 What is the attitude of the  people and
 the progressive Left parties towards the CPI
 now?  All those who are politically serious
 and have been following events are convinced
 that the CPI is making sincere  efforts for
 unity and is prepared to make the  necessary
 sacrifices.
 Not even those  who had systematically
 propagandized for some time that the CP[
 had been smashed up by repression or ren-
 dered ineffective through internal dissensions,
 now pretend to believe what they had prea-
 ched.  The CPI is generally accepted as the
 Left Party.  It is readily conceded that no
 real democratic opposition to the Congress
 regime can be organised by excluding  the
 CPI.
 The mass of the common people respect
 the CPI as a real fighting Party and thinking

 sections loo's up to the CPI as the  coming
 Party in opposition to the  Congress,  but it
 is also their estimate that it is not  yet strong
 enough to deliver the goods.
 The people are not yet . very clear about
 Communist policy.  The confusion caused by
 sectarian mistakes  of the recent      past  and
 slanderous  propaganda by reactionary forces
 has not yet been totally removed.
 The Party  is strong among  the Bengali
 workers, but weaker among the Hindustani
 workers.  In the last elections. anti-Commu-
 nist national demogogy by Nehru and others
 had misled the majority of Hindustani workers
 to voting for the Congress.  The experience
 of Congress Government has taught them a
 lot. They attend  Party rallies in growing
 numbers and are at present in a  vacillating
 mood.
 Middle-class youth is rapidly going pro-
 Party or pro-Left.                       The impact of China
 has been decisive.
 There is a definite shift towards the CPI
 in the towns.
 In  the countryside,  wherever the Red
 Flag has been active the peasantry has swung
 against the Congress and accepts the Party
 as its Party, but vast areas, the majority of
 villages, yet remain untouched by the Red Flag.
 Among the Muslims, the general senti-
 ment is against the Congress and  for the
 Party.  But the pressure of the Congress is
 being intensified.  Most  of the ex-League
 leaders have become Congress leaders today.
 Their propaganda    line  is :  Vote for the
 Congress or you will have to go to Pakistan!
 This is having some  demoralising effect in
 the villages though it is opening the eyes , of
 the Muslims in the towns.
 The Communist Party has  been tradi-
 tionally strong in Bengal.  All experienced
 and farsighted Bengalis wish it to rapidly
 regain its old strength and go stronger  and
 stronger.  It is not very difficult to see that
 it is only a rejuvenated, strong and  united
 Communist Party that can aid and       guide
 Bengal to cope with the acute problems crea-
 ted by partition, British domination of key
 industries, Marwari speculation at the Stock
 Exchange, blackmarket of all essential com-
 modities, and chronic food deficit under a
 Ministry which disdains even to talk of agra-
 rian reforms.
 The efforts of the Communist Party are
 directed to  forging such a united democratic
 coalition of popular forces that the Congress
 rulers are made to pay for their sins in the
 coming election battle.
 World Economic Conference at Moscow
 Under  the  auspices  of the World Peace
 Council, an International Economic Conference is
 going to be held in Moscow in December
 next.  The Conference will discuss (i)  the
 effects of  the  two  World  Wars on    the
 national  economy  of each country,     and
 (ii) the possible improvement in the standard
 of living of the peoples of the world, if peace
 is preserved and mutually benificient trade
 relations are established on a non-discriminatory
 basis.
 The All  India Preparatory  Committee
 formed by the Indian Peace Council is making
 efforts to ensure adequate and effective parti-
 cipation by the Indian people in the coming
 International Conference.
 It is learnt that the Indian Preparatory
 Committee's work has roused a keen interest
 among not only the Peace Partisans, but also
 wide sections of businessmen and industrialists,
 including  some  of the  topmost rank.  It
 shows that the evil effect of the Anglo-Ameri-
 can imperialist policy, further intensified by
 the latest armament programme, i.e., the denial
 of capital goods and essential raw materials
 and export of inflation, is getting exposed to
 wider  sections  of the  Indian  people.  In
 fact, a number of news-items of the last few
 weeks have clearly underlined this fact.
 Contrast between two policies
 For example:
 (i) "Mr. Mahtab (Indian Industry Minister)
 who led the Indian delegation to the recent
 Commonowealth Conference in  London on
 raw materials ..told  Mr. Jnani Ram that
 `It was made clear to the participating coun-
 tries that raw materials, especially non- ferrous
 Approved For Release 2001/09/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415RO10200020024-9
 Approved For Release 2001/09/10 :
 metals and certain chemicals, were in very
 short supply because of Western rearmament pro-
 gramme and that it would not be possible for
 India or any other country to obtain these
 goods in the same quantity to meet her restric-
 ted requirements..." (Tine Statesman, October 7;
 emphasis mine - A. R.)
 Mr. Mahtab had flown to London with the
 begging bowl, but had to return empty-handed.
 (ii) "Effective from October 1, the National
 Shipping Authority of the U. S. A. has announ-
 ced an increase varying from $ 3.50 to $ 4.50
 per ton in the rates for American Government.
 owned vessels for the carriage of grain to India.
 The new freight rates are 25 per ton from
 U. S. Atlantic coast to the Indian West coast.
 and $ 27.75 per ton to the Indian East coast.."
 (Tfte Statesman, October 14)
 The facade of Wall Street's sympathy for
 the starving millions of India is crumbling
 clown and the real face of the profiteers is
 getting unmasked.  The first instalment of
 American wheat resulted in an increase  of
 Its. 2/- a maund in price; the latest increase
 in freight is likely to further push it up by
 Re. 1/- unless with an eye to the coming general
 election, the Government of India pays it out
 of the exchequer.  That import of American
 produce means  import of inflation  should be
 clear from this.
 (iii) The contrast between the selfish im-
 perialist policies of the Anglo-American bloc
 and the genuinely cooperative hand offered
 by the Soviet Union is too glaring even for the
 kept press of the imperialists to suppress.
 "Both the British and American  delega-
 tions gave sober and rather depressing forecasts
 of the amount of goods likely to be available
 for export....
 "The Russians, on the other hand, have
 offered to  barter capital goods and consu-
 mer's articles in exchange for raw materials. . "
 (Times' report  of the recent UNECAFE
 session, quoted by The Statesman, October 15).
 The sharp contrast between the two poli-
 cies-that of denial of essential supplies and
 high profiteering by the Anglo-American War-
 Bloc and the offer of capital and consumers'
 goods on the basis of equality and with  no
 strings attached by the Soviet Union, which
 stands at the of head the Democratic Peace
 Camp, is opening the eyes of wider sections of
 the Indian people.  Let the work of the Indian
 Preparatory Committee for the coming Inter-
 national Economic conference reflect this de-
 velopment.
 CIA-RDP83-00415R010200020024-9
 The American counter show
 As a counter to the International Economic
 Conference convened  by the World Peace
 Council, the National Association of Manu-
 facturers   (NAM),  the  organisation  of the
 topmost Wall Street monopolists, is making
 hectic preparations for the "First Internation-
 al Conference of Manufacturers" which  will
 meet in the United States at the same time
 as the Moscow Conference.
 The difference in the outlook and purpose
 of the two conferences is obvious from their
 respective agenda.  The agenda of the NAM
 Conference consists of:
 "Discussion of ways to improve production
 will centre around new or improved machines
 and tools, new materials, new processes, im-
 proved plant layout and design, better material-
 handling methods,  research and invention,
 capital investment necessary for operating and
 harmonious employer-employee relations."
 (American Reporter, October 17)
 While the Moscow Conference will study the
 recent economic developments  in  advanced
 Western countries as well as backward colonial
 areas, the American Conference will confine
 its studies only to the highly advanced industrial
 countries.  While  the  main  purpose  of the
 Moscow conference  is to study    the standard
 q f living of the world people, that of the NAM.
 Conference is nationalisation; and finally, while
 in the Moscow Conference will assemble the
 representatives of not only the businessmen
 and industrialists but of workers, peasants and
 other toiling peoples too, the NAM conference
 will gather the manufacturers only.
 It is only natural that the peoples of the
 world would look up to the Moscow Conference
 with eager expectation and upon the NAM
 Conference with deep distrust.
 Significant figures
 The recently published annual report on
 Currency and Finance by the Reserve Bank
 of India says :
 Out of a total estimated expenditure of
 Rs. 735 crores of the Central and State Govern-
 ments (except Rajasthan) for the year 1951-52,
 the share of Security including Defence Services
 is Its. 310 crores while that of Social Services
 is Its. 150 crores only.
 The expenditure on civil administrati6on is
 not given here.  Even then, the amount spent
 on Police and Military alone is more than

 twice that on education and health.
 This is not only a continuation of the old
 imperialist-bureaucratic policy in the sphere of
 public finance but also conforms to the general
 line of the Anglo-American War bloc.  The
 democratic and peace forces in India, if united
 in a mighty upsurge, can change this pattern
 of anti-social, anti-national waste and employ
 this huge wealth for the betterment of the
 people's conditions.
 Misdeeds of Managing Agents
 On the eve of the parliamentary debate on
 the  Company  Law Amendments,  we had
 discussed the harmful role of the Managing
 Agency System in our economy.  In course
 of the debate itself, more damning revelations
 have been made by the official sources.
 "Replying to the debate, Finance Minister
 Sir C. D. Deshnuikh said," reported The Stalcs-
 man, that "he had before him about 100 cases,
 representative  samples  of  various  acts  of
 mismanagement by managing agents.
 "Reading out certain cases, he said that
 in one case, about Rs. 55 lakhs were lent to
 private parties without security, for purposes
 unconnected with the legitimate objects of the
 Company, which was a mill.  There were also
 several cases of issue of debentures for inAvest-
 ment in other concerns, grant of non-trading
 advances  to  nominees  of managing  agents
 or unknown parties, grants of loans and advances
 to managing agents or directors of companies
 on  current  account,  interlocking  of shares,
 accumulation of unrealised book debts and the
 like.  The amount involved ran into c.rores
 fo Rupees ......" (The Statesman, September. 8
 It may sound strange, but it is nevertheless
 a fact that even on the basis of the above evidence
 collected by its own sources, the Government
 of India did not think it necessary to issue an
 ordinance to eliminate or control the malprac-
 tices of the managing agents.`  On the contrary,
 all it did was to issue an ordinance, and later
 rush through the Parliament a bill to prevent
 the existing managing agents being dislodged
 by other upstarts.
 The thin end
 Simultaneously with  the signing ol.' the
 `Peace' Treaty with America's Japanese pro-
 tectmate, the Government of India has granted
 it fishing  concession to a Japaries firm, the
 Taiyo Fishinti Go,, Ltd., to carry on fishing opera-
 tions in Indian waters off the Bombay and
 Saurashtra coasts.
 Almost. at the same time American domina-
 ted Japanese cartel, International Silk Association,
 has initiated in India "a country-wide cam-
 paign to step up the consumption" of Japanese
 sill.. At the first instance they would spend
 2,771 or Its. 13,500 in this campaign.
 These  are  pointers  over  which  Indian
 industrialists would do well to ponder.
 A Note on Indian Shipping
 "Indian shipping",    writes the editor of
 the Investor's (India)  Tear-Book-1951, the wcll-
 known publication by the foremost brokers
 in the Calcutta Stock-Exchange, "made slow
 snit   nevertheless     steady   progress ...... I'lie
 Government of India decided to reserve the
 coastal trade exclusively for Indian shipping
 and notice was given to terminate the licences
 of the British companies within twelve months
 from August 15, 1950. When Indian owned and
 chartered tonnage was found inadequate to deal
 with the  coastal  cargo,  foreign  companies
 were permitted to berth tonnage on the coast
 under special licences granted for specific
 periods.  Analysis .... at the end  of  1950
 revealed that considerable headway had been
 made since the coastal trade was reserved for
 Indian shipping.  The  licenced tonnage of
 foreign shipping had been reduced to 48,000 tons
 compared to  1,78,000 tons two years ago.
 Coastal cargo carried by Indian shipping,
 which amounted to 53% of the total in 1948,
 rose to 62% in 1949, and in 1950, was slightly
 over 75%, against a pre-war figure of 33%,.
 Indian tonnage on coast,  or  based on it,
 owned or chartered, now stands at a little over
 2,47,000 tons.  There was a similar progres-
 sive increase in Indian shipping in the overseas
 trade.  Xo Indian ships participated in this trade
 in 1946-47, but by the end of 1950, their number
 stood at 25..."
 Though it is not known what part of the
 fleet at the disposal of the Indian  shipping
 companies is really owned by them and what
 part is chartered from foreign shipping mono-
 polists at exorbitant rates, the  advance re-
 gistered by the Indian shipping is undeniable.
 From 33% of the total in the pre-war days, the
 share of the Indian companies in the coastal
 shipping rose to over 75% at the end of 1950;
 from nil in 1946-47, the number of  Indian
 ships in the deep-sea trade rose to 25 at the end

 Real Lace of Panchayat
 in Uttar Pradesh
 Raj
 Over two years ago the establishment of
 Village Panchayats in the Uttar Pradesh was
 announced with great fanfare.   Congress
 leaders and government ministers declared
 the formation of Panchayats to be the dawn
 of a new era for the tens of millions of pea-
 sants in the state.  'their radio and the kept
 press boasted that the setting up of Pancha-
 yats was the biggest experiment in rural de-
 mocracy ever witnessed in the world.  What
 is the reality behind these loud phrases?
 Background to formation of Panchayats
 The post-war period  was a period of
 great popular upsurge.  In the wake of a
 memorable anti-imperialist general awaken-
 ing and alongside the mighty struggles of the
 Indian workers and students, soldiers and
 sailors and the state's peoples, the peasant
 masses of India too rose in mighty movements
 in several regions of the country. The peasant
 of the U. P. was also on his feet in Basti, Rae-
 barelli and other districts, militantly fighting
 back the ejectment offensive of the zamindars
 supported by police bayonets.  And, though,
 for some time,  the  frenzy of communal
 blood-baths gave the Kisan movement here
 a big setback, it never died down.
 The economic crisis grew from bad to
 worse causing appalling distress to the rural
 population.  Inflationary prices of industrial
 goods, scarcity of fodder and fuel, prohibitive
 prices of food and cloth, epidemics and floods,
 new taxes and ejectments and low wages made
 life impossible among the mass of peasantry.
 Discontent, disillusionment and unrest grew
 rapidly during the course of 1948.  There
 was a spate of spontaneous struggles of the
 agricultural labourers  and poor peasants.
 The peasant masses were beginning to realise
 the utter falsity of the promises and slogans
 of the Congress rulers.
 Real aims of the Panchayat scheme
 Congress bosses quickly saw the writing
 on the wall.  They were fully aware of the
 NOVEMBER 1951
 democratic orientation of this peasant upsurge.
 They were also aware of the deep-rooted tra-
 ditions of some kind of Panchayati set-up in
 the villages for hundreds of years and the
 growing aspirations of the peasant for some
 sort of direct and real participation in  the
 administration of the land.
 The watchful rulers understood that guns
 alone won't do.  Something more was needed
 to calm and cow down the agrarian unrest.
 So while unleashing police and goonda terror
 against the struggling peasantry, they simul-
 taneously resorted to the deceitful propaganda
 of the Zamindari abolition and the advent of
 peasant self-rule.  A whole barrage of propa-
 ganda was let loose to strengthen  existing
 illusions and to create new ones among the
 masses of peasants.  They calculated that the
 Panchayats  combined  with and supported
 by Prantiya Rakshak Dal (the Government
 sponsored, police-administered semi-voluntary
 volunteer force) would act as  brakes on the
 popular movement and that they would help
 in disrupting the fighting solidarity of the
 peasant masses and help Congress to maintain
 itself in power.
 This was the Central  objective  of the
 Panchayat scheme.  The framers so designed
 the Panchayat apparatus as to provide jobs
 to a good number of dissatisfied   Congress
 workers.  We will presently see  how these
 calculations were not wholly miscarried.
 Class  composition of Panchayats
 Despite the provision of adult franchise,
 the elections  to  the Gram Panchayats  and
 Panchayati Adalats were far from free and fair.
 Although the Congress party did not officially
 contest these elections, nevertheless, it used
 coercion,  threats, official  pressure, money
 and other unscruplous methods  to back the
 candidates of her choice  to win.  Further,
 the candidates were required to deposit elec-
 tion fees which the poor sections found di-
 fficult to afford.                                                                          Besides, in case of defeat,
 security was forfeited without any regard of

 the number of votes polled. Thus the govern-
 ment pocketed tens of thousands of rupees.
 Moreover,  educational  qualifications  were
 imposed in respect of the office of Gram Sabha
 Pradhan and the members of the Adalats which
 barred the door against many uneducated but
 honest and fighting elements.
 On top of it, the Communist and several
 other Left parties were not allowed to freely
 participate  in  the  elections.  Restrictions
 were imposed on their propaganda, meetings
 and demonstrations and a large number of
 Communist Party workers were either driven
 underground or detained. Muslim voters under
 fear voted for the Congress-favoured candidates.
 Congressmen and zamindars also did their
 worst to  exploit  the communal and caste
 instincts of the electorate.
 Thus were born the 35,000 Gram Pancha-
 yats and 8,000 Panchayti Adalats.*
 The government appointed 8 thousand
 secretaries and about 500 inspectors to run
 the whole machine.
 These Panchayats and Adalats are either
 landlord or landlord-cum-rich-peasant domi-
 nated.  There are also cases where they are
 dominated by an alliance of rich and middle
 peasants. In some places, they are under
 the domination of rich peasants alone.  Some
 of  the Panchayats or Panchayati Adalats are
 also democratically led by the honest repre-
 sentatives of the toiling masses themselves.
 In majority of cases,  however, we find the
 above class  combinations controlling and
 directing the activities of the Panchayats.  And
 though  representatives of the      agricultural
 labour, poor and small peasants and untouch-
 *The main provisions of the Panchayat Raj Act can
 be summarised as follows:           I
 The Gram Sabha is supposed to be the self-govern-
 ing body of a village or a group of villages.                   Every
 adult resident of the area concerned is a life member of
 the Gram Sabha, except, of course those of unsound
 mind or in Government service, etc.
 The Gram Sabha is supposed to hold usually two
 meetings In the year - one soon after harvesting of the
 Kharif crop and the other after the Rabi.  One-fifth
 of the members can requisition a meeting.
 Every Gram Sabha elects an Executive Committee
 which is called Gram Panchayat.  It consists of 30 to 51
 members, and is elected for a period of 3 years. The
 Gram Panchayat has been given wide powers.  It can
 make provisions for construction and maintenance, etc.,
 of public streets, wells, tanks, ponds, medical relief,
 sanitation; registering births, deaths and marriages; regula-
 tions of burial ghats and cemetries; regulation of melas;
 maintenance   of  primary  schools,  common grazing
 grounds, public properties; regulation of construction of
 new private buildings and alterations in the existing
 ones; administration of Civil and Criminal justice and
 able masses are also  found on them, they
 have no decisive voice.
 In many instances even these representatives
 serve as the agents of one or the other section
 of the dominating classes,  or play  between
 them, or in case of a more or less harmonious
 combine ruling the Panchayats, play second
 fiddle to the ruling group.
 However, we should not forget one thing
 that these Panchayats, with the exception of big
 landlords, are manned by persons belonging
 to classes which are essentially democratic, anti-
 imperialist, and anti-feudal.
 Another thing to be noted is that these
 Panchayats, while co-operating with the Govern-
 ment on many issues, also resist its reactionary
 policies.
 In fact, the present unpopular policies
 followed by most of the  Panchayati  bodies,
 the weak representation or voice of the toiling
 peasantry in these bodies, and the opportunism
 of the elected  representatives of the toiling
 stratas, is mainly due to a low stage of class
 consciousness, very weak organisation,   and
 still weaker intervention of the down-trodden
 masses.
 Recently I made a study of the class
 composition of the Panchayat of village Kaith-
 wari in Meerut district and of the represen-
 tatives of this village on the Panchayati Adalat
 of that  area.  This examination revealed
 that out of a total of 38 Panchayat  members,
 only 3 are rich peasants.  The rest    belong
 to the middle peasantry, rural artisan and
 agricultural labouring classes.  There are 2
 poor peasants.  However, despite their very
 small number the rich peasant members rule
 the day in the Panchayat.
 the election of Panches on. the panel of the Panchayati
 Adalat, etc., etc.
 In addition to the above, there are numerous dis-
 cretionary functions  of the Gram Panchayats,  viz.,
 planting and maintaining of trees; improved breeding
 and medical care of the cattle; organizing a village
 volunteer force for watch and ward development of
 co-operation; managing of seed and implement stores,
 taqavi loans, famine relief, libraries and akharas, etc.,
 The Gram Panchayat  can also  enquire  into the
 misconduct of amin, process server, vaccinator, constable,
 patwari, patrol, or peon of any government department.
 Every Gram Sabha elects five adults as Panches of the
 Panchayati Adalat.  Panches from a group of villages
 form the panel of Panchayati Adalat for that circle
 of villages and they elect a Sarpanch.
 Offences under certain sections of the Indian Penal
 Code; the Cattle Trespass Act, the U. P. District Boards
 Primary Education Act 1926; the Public Gambling Act,
 etc. are cognizable by a Panchayati Adalat, which is
 empowered to demand the execution of a bond for an
 amount not exceeding Rs. 10J for keeping the peace for a
 period not exceeding 15 days.

 And out of 5 representatives of this village
 on the Adalat, 2 are small  landlords (also
 indulging in usury), 2 rich peasants  (doing
 petty usury and black-marketting also) and
 one is a rural poor serving  them.      This
 Adalat also is controlled by two rich peasants,
 one of them being a Congressite.
 Tax, tax and tax
 You may go to any area in      the Uttar
 Pradesh and you will find peasants and rural
 workers  bitterly  complaining  against  the
 imposition of newer and fresher taxes by the
 Panchayats.  Where the Panchayats are either
 reluctant or slow in taxing, the inspectors
 pull them up and force them to do the un-
 pleasant.                           In fact, the majority of Panchayats
 have done nothing  except inventing new
 taxes.   There is no economic activity of the
 toiling population which goes untaxed. There
 are unheard of taxes! Ridiculous taxes! Just
 as in backward feudal states!!
 The following table will give an idea of
 the nature and extent of this taxation :
 Shopkeeper attending
 weekly village market
 Vendors
 Sale of cattle, etc.

 Anna 1 per rupee

 Rs. 3/- per loom
 Rs. 3/- yearly
 Rs. 8/- yearly
 As. 8 per summons.
 This is how even the poorest in the village
 are  being  burdened   with  taxes.  Besides,
 heavy fines and penalties are imposed by the
 Panchayats and Panchayati Adalats in the cases
 decided by them.  In addition to these taxes
 there are drives for "voluntary donations" launch-
 ed from time to time for different purposes.
 The heads and amount of taxes differs
 from area to area.  But one thing is common
 to all villages. The panchayats  fix  them
 without any reference to the Gram Sabhas,
 (the general assembly of village population)
 knowing as they do that unpopular taxation
 would encounter fierce resistance of the pea-
 sants.  That is also why Gram Sabha sessions
 are usually  not held at all though consti-
 tutionally it must meet twice a year.
 The amount collected through such taxes
 and fines is deposited with the treasury, while
 village wells and school buildings lie in dila-
 pidated  condition,  village lanes remain in
 a most insanitary state, men and cattle die
 for lack of medical aid, food and  fodder,
 but this money is not allowed to be touched
 in most cases.
 On. the other hand, the Panchayat Raj
 Department of the Government makes it im-
 perative for the Panchayats to subscribe for
 official papers such as PANCHATATI RAJTA
 and draws the money for the same from the
 treasury.  Some time back, the  Panchayats
 were compelled to "donate " for a newspaper
 which never saw the light of day. !
 One may see villages where some sort of
 constructive work, which benefits the entire
 village  population or part of it, was done
 under the old village or community panchayats
 and also under the Rural Development Scheme
 of the first Congress ministry in U. P.  But
 the constructive performance of the present
 panchayats, with their increased resources, is
 almost negligible.
 In service of the police
 In other spheres Panchayats have served
 as the organs of the police.  The Gram Sabha
 Pradhan is used by the police and other authori-
 ties to extort bribes in                                                                       disputes and other
 cases.  He is made to supply information to
 police officials regarding the work and acti-
 vities of political parties and mass organi-
 sations.  Panchayats are also  used  by  the
 police and landlords to sabotage rallies, etc.,
 organised by the Communist and other Left
 parties by spreading slanders and panic in
 the villages.
 Pradhans often advise tax officers of the
 District Boards to levy income tax on the
 village poor and others on the basis of wrong
 information about their incomes. They defend,
 on the other hand, the black-marketeers and
 bullies. On top of it, they themselves extort
 illegal money and service for themselves in
 various ways.
 In most of the village disputes,  which
 come under the jurisdiction of Panchayats
 and Adalats, justice is not done. Very recent-
 ly Panchayats have been empowered to bound
 Approved For Release 2001/09/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415R010200020024-9
 Approved For Release 2001/09/10
 down persons in the name of peace and order
 and in event of refusal to furnish bonds they
 can be detained by the police.  This is  a
 measure clearly aimed against the  peasant
 militants.
 Thus the Gram Panchayats have functioned,
 more often than not, as organs of intimida-
 tion, corruption, disruption and discrimina-
 tion.
 Institutions based on adult suffrage and
 directly associated with the masses and mostly
 controlled by persons belonging to anti-impe-
 rialist, anti-feudal class, thus pursuing generally
 anti-popular policies !  How shall we explain
 this phenomenon?  This phenomenon is  ex.
 plained by  the fact that  the ideological,
 organisational and united front level of the
 peasant movement in our province is still
 very low.
 Whom do Panchyats help ?
 The results of this so-called "colossal ex-
 periment in rural democracy" are the common
 talk of the villages today.  Go to any village
 and you will find peasants bitterly complain-
 ing that since the inception of Panchayats
 rivalries, feuds, factionalism and tension have
 increased tenfold.  In the absence of demo-
 cratic  intervention, Panchayats have become
 liot-beds of faction-fights, thus considerably
 disrupting the unity and solidarity of the
 peasant masses.
 And obviously, so far as the basic prob-
 lems of the peasantry are  concerned,  the
 existing Panchayats have not solved and cannot
 solve a single one of them.

 The  agricultural  labourers  and  rural
 artisans are wholly dissatisfied with them
 because they cannot ensure them land,  a
 living wage,  deliverance from indebtedness
 and social oppression.  Moreoever, they are
 angry because they are being saddled with
 taxes and fines which they are unable to pay.
 The poor and small peasants know that
 the  Panchayats can give them neither land
 and freedom from debts, nor seed, implements
 and cheap and adequate water  supply for
 irrigation.  They violently resent the Panchayat
 taxation and the discrimination against them.
 The middle peasantry  is also conscious
 of the fact that the  Panchayats cannot and
 will not save  its collapsing economy from
 further ruination that awaits it.  They too
 have gained nothing.  They are vehemently
 opposed to panchayat taxes.
 The rich peasantry also finds the Pancha-
 yats to be absolutely impotent in so far as
 their demands  against the big landowning
 class and  against the    government for just
 prices of industrial goods, etc., are concerned.
 To the rich peasants, so far, the Panchayats
 have  given   only the satisfaction of being
 called the officers of a  Government body,
 however limited its powers, and of winning
 some  petty  concessions  from  Government
 officials by virtue of their new position.
 To the untouchable and depressed sections
 Panchayats gave  a subjective self-satisfaction
 of sitting round the same table as their tradi-
 tional social superiors.  That is all.
 ONLY the big landlords are jubilant on
 account of the domination they have  been
 able to exercise and the disunity and disrup-
 tion which followed among the democratic
 masses.
 Weak popular resitance
 The people resent the pressure  of the
 Government upon the Panchayats.  The harm-
 ful policies of the latter have led to people
 losing interest in the  Panchayats, not only
 displaying  spontaneous carelessness  towards
 their functioning and deliberations, but also
 putting up resistance which, however, is still
 very weak and disorganised.
 This resistance expresses    itself in many
 forms, viz., non-payment of Panchayat taxes,
 refusal to take any notice of the summons of
 Panchayati Adalats; demand for the immediate
 use of funds at the disposal of the Panchayats;
 demand for the removal of corrupt Pradhans
 and  secretaries  and  inspectors.  Moreover,
 the Panchayats, themselves, are in some cases
 Approved For Release 2001/09/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415RO10200020024-9
 Approved For Release 2001/09/10
 offering partial opposition to the Panchayat
 Raj Act and the pressure of the Government
 exercised through the inspectors, secretaries
 and the district magistrates, is evidenced by
 the fact of certain Panch Conferences demanding
 the imposition of no taxes at all or only on the
 rich, demanding the funds to be left at the
 absolute disposal of the Panchayats themselves,
 demanding the salaries of the secretaries to be
 paid by the Government.  These Conferences
 have also raised the demand of the Government
 to leave one-fourth of her total village revenue
 for the development of the village and have
 resented and opposed official interference in
 their work.  The Pradhans have  demanded
 freedom to join political parties and extention
 of Panchayat rights.
 As yet this resistance has been very mild
 and weak and based only on few sections of
 the entire Panchayat orgainsation; but once
 the democratic and united peasant movement
 takes up the issues in right earnest the scales
 will be tipped in favour of the people.
 Therefore, it will be a suicidal sectarian
 -;stake for the peasant movement to boycott
 ,se Panchayats.  We have to be in them and
 ern to  utilise them for  people's interests.
 We would be poor revolutionaries, indeed, if we
 fail in this urgent task.
 Utilise Panchayats for people's benefit
 Obviously it will be a tough battle between
 the peasant movement and the Government.
 The ruling class will try more and more to
 utilise the  Panchayats  as its  helping hands
 through village Congressmen, opportunist ele-
 ments, landlords and also the rich peasants.
 To counter this we must build up broadest
 united front inside the Panchayats and isolate
 the Governments, the big landlords and their
 reactionary henchmen.
 We should start on the basis of the follow-
 ing tasks :
 We must launch united front campaign from
 inside and outside the Panchayats for an extension
 of their democratic rights and powers.
 We must expose continually the aim of the ruling
 class behind the Panchayats and its reactionary efforts
 in converting them into police organs.
 We must work for the defeat of people's enemies
 inside the Panchayats.
 We must see that the panchayats pass resolutions
 and send memorandums against police zoolum  and
 for common demands of their areas to begin with.
 CIA-RDP83-00415R01 0200020024-9
 We must expose the anti-democratic policies of
 the Government from the Panchayat platform.
 We must fight against taxation inside them.
 We must draw them into the Peace movement.
 We must insist and campaign to hold Grain
 Sabha sessions regularly.
 We must activize and democratise the Panchayats

 We must back up the Panchayats on all demo-

 The successful fulfilment of  these tasks

 our competence to win all our allies and to
 isolate the Government and the big landlords.

 Songs of the West Indians
 We West Indians can
 be proud of our peo-
 ple and of our past.
 I think of my country-
 men as some of the
 finest types, physically
 and  otherwise, that
 can  be  found  any-
 where, and although
 we   are not  taught
 much about the history
 of our own people in
 the  schools, stories
 LEON FUNG is a, young singer and com-
 poser from Jamaica whose Chinese surname may
 remind us that the West Indies have old links
 with Asia.  The delegations of West Indians
 and Africans to the Berlin Youth Festiaual made a
 special contribution to the musical and cultural
 side of this great demonstration of international
 friendship. Here Fung explains the national
 traditions of his art and shows the way in which
 music can serve the peoples' cause.-Editor
 and traditions get handed down from parents
 and older people, making us conscious of the
 sufferings of our people.
 Among the enslaved Africans brought by
 force from their native land to these Islands,
 were many people of noble birth and many
 others of high intellectual attainment.  The
 names of Toussaint L'Ouverture, Henri Chris-
 tophe, Dessaline and many others will always
 be remembered.
 Music of victory and independence
 Among the Maroons in the mountains of
 Jamaica there was plenty of courage and intel-
 lect.   Dessaline and his comrades by sheer
 brain power and organisational ability defeated
 the once invincible fleet and army of Napoleon
 in the West Indies and declared the indepen-
 dence of Haiti in 1804. They ripped the white
 stripe out of the French flag and joined the blue
 and red to form the flag which still to-day
 represents Haiti.  After this  extraordinary
 achievement of inexperienced   men  against
 well trained and organised troops, the new-
 born citizens of Haiti on the 2nd of January,
 1804, settled upon to celebrate their victory
 and the newly won freedom with the music of
 drums and dancing.  And what extraordinary
 rythm they can produce on their drums ! One
 can imagine the incomparable rythxns and
 ecstatic dancing inspired by victory, and. while
 they beat out their measures on Haiti, the
 slaves on the other islands were carrying out a
 similar struggle.
 Many of the slaves could not practice their
 art as openly as the free people of Haiti. They
 resorted to producing rythm by their voices.
 Hundreds of varieties
 of song sprung up and
 died away, but many
 survived and are well
 known   to-day-the
 Buroo, the Mento, the
 Meringue,  the  Son,
 the Conga, the Rum-
 bah, the Pickon, the
 Calypso and     many
 others.
 -      _--------       The Calypso
 It is in the last named form that I have
 somewhat specialised myself.  Calypsoes are
 sung in most of the islands, but the inhabitants
 of Trinidad have a special weakness for themx
 The Calypso generally had an erotic charactc
 but singers also use themes from individua
 life, events in national history and above all
 political subjects.  Almost any incident can
 go into a Calypso, and a number of highly
 developed political Calypsoes have become
 popular.  Some have been published in Ameri-
 can collections of songs.
 Some Calypso singers think that the tradi-
 tional four-verse form should not be altered,
 "but for my part I think that" it would be
 putting the  Calypso in a strait jacket  to
 stick rigidly to such rules.  It should be a
 medium of free expression and I believe it is
 capable of great development in the service
 of the people.  I want to use the Calypso
 to stir my people out of their lethargy, to
 inspire them and instil in them the revolu-
 tionary idea,                                                                          the desire for freedom  and
 independence.
 We must defend our national art
 It is my earnest desire to get as many people
 as possible to sing Calypsoes reasonably well.
 Everything else has been forcibly taken away
 from us, the coloured people, by our "protec-
 tors"-except our music.  That has remained
 and we should be glad that we still possess
 something  of which these gentlemen were
 unable to relieve us.  This bit of Negro cul-
 ture, like the drumming in Haiti and Africa,
 has remained faithful to us.  We should want
 to share it with our friends in all lands.  In

 some of the islands of the West Indies to-day
 there are snobs among us who go all out to
 please the Yanks and to imbibe their empty
 tin music. Such people decry true folk art,
 the art of their forefathers.  While I do not
 believe that this decadent music can ever
 kill the virile folk-song and Calypso, we have to
 fight consciously for our national art and its
 development, just as we have to fight for other
 rights and needs.
 It is much more difficult to explain the
 musical character of the Calypso.  Like the
 Sambah the rhythm is negroid.      The only
 difference is that the Calypso rhythm cannot be
 written, it must be felt.   Try to write it, and
 all you get is another stereotyped, lifeless corn-
 mercial hash.  I am not saying that an approxi-
 mation of the notation could not or should not
 be attempted, but in order to sing it, the rhythm
 must first be felt.  Perhaps this is the nature of
 all true folk-song.    While it is correct to say
 for instance that the Sambah is on the beat,
 it is also true to say that the Calypso is generally
 off the beat, but I'm afraid that if I attempted
 to describe its musical character more closely
 in words, I should not be able to give my
 readers  any clearer impression.  And yet,
 although the Calypso is something so cha-
 racteristic of my own country and so typically
 part of our Negro culture, it seems to have an
 almost universal appeal to people everywhere
 once it can be heard, as my recent experiences
 at the Berlin Youth Festival demonstrated.
 Calypsoes at the Berlin Festival
 I was singing not only with the West Indians
 and West Africans who attended the Festival
 but also with the English cultural group, and
 I was kept busy from the time I arrived to the
 time I left. Although I had been singing much
 more than was good for my voice in France
 before coming to Germany and my voice was
 not in really good form, I was amazed to find
 that I was in great demand to sing on every
 occasion.  My Calypso on Korea, which had
 made something of a hit at London, seemed
 to have an even greater effect in Berlin.
 Every time I stopped in the street, a crowd
 seemed to gather round to ask questions about
 my country and to get autographs. When I got
 through answering their questions and asking
 my own questions, I would ask the people to sing
 some of their German folk-songs.  Then they
 would ask me to sing the songs of my native
 land.  Sometimes I would start to show them
 our folk-dances and then they would show
 theirs,. And so it went on. Sometimes a loud-

 CIA-RDP83-00415R010200020024-9
 speaker van came along and provided music
 for us to dance in the streets, and sometimes
 after the dancing they would again ask me to
 sing, and I would mount the top of the van and
 sing from there as a platform.
 There were always thousands of young
 people who would collect and listen.  One
 evening it seemed to me that the crowd I had
 collected was blocking up the highway to the
 inconvenience of the traffic and I asked the
 people to move into a side street where we
 would cause less obstruction.  This they accor-
 dingly did very readily.  And this is how I
 come to have a very unusual souvenir from
 Berlin, because the German police apparently
 appreciated this consideration of their diffi-
 culties and showed it by sending me a present-
 a police badge attached to a handkerchief-
 with their thanks and good wishes.
 I was asked to sing in most of the big theatres
 and every day and every night I sang to large
 audiences either in some theatre, or in the
 Treptower Park or in the streets.  I and a
 Trinidadian also taught some of the children
 the ring dance in the Young Pioneer Central
 House of Culture, near Stalin Alley, while the
 children in their turn taught us some of their
 folk dances.
 Folk dance versus neurotic jitterbug
 All this was a unique opportunity for ex-
 change of ideas and learning something of
 one another's art. I noticed for instance that
 when in the streets some rather decadent
 looking  "spiv"-type  youngsters  started up
 American dances like the "Jitterbug", the
 majority of East Berliners did not regard this
 at all favourably.  These incidents only em-
 phasised the contrast between the neurotic
 American dances and the healthy folk-dance.
 It is quite clear that even here all sorts of
 attempts are made to foist this decadent and
 spurious American "culture" onto the German
 people but it was also quite clear that the
 Germans' own folk-dances and art gave them far
 more real pleasure and the "Jitterbuggers" just
 seemed quite out of place in that atmosphere.
 There seems to be a real renaissance of true
 German culture with a new spirit.  I came
 away impressed by the healthy  signs that
 show that the German people have all the
 talents needed to win again a leading position
 in the world of true and progressive culture
 and that they need certainly never succumb to
 the cheap American variety of "civilisation".
 One of the songs which I was asked to sing
 again and again and which was always under-
 stood and applauded explains why.  Here it is:

 the Early British Labour Movement
 "When first the West its warrior march began

 Rolls the fierce torrent of a people's rights.

 In 1857 Ernest Jones could claim that his
 Revolt  of  Hindustani, written  in  prison
 between 1848 and 1850, had been prophetic.
 Were he alive to-day he might claim even
 greater insight for seeing where the betrayal
 of democracy in "Man's sanctuary, America"
 would lead.  The introduction to the poem
 on India explains why mankind had to look
 elsewhere for the realisation of freedom as
 the Chartists understood it, and here addres-
 sing America he writes :
 "But not the black alone the wrong shall feel,
 The white man sinks the prey to blood and
 steel; ii
 For Victory carries Glory in her train
 Which dark behinds her drags a lengthening

 Soon rivet links on misery's limbs at  home;
 The taste for conquest brings the taste for
 more;

 the class character of the bourgeois republic and were
 associated in the Chartist press with the old "blot"
 of negro slavery.

 :national movement and indicates the position
 of the English progressive movement at that
 time already forced to consider its stand in
 relation to wider issues, such as the practical
 effects of colonisation on the conditions of
 the masses, and what its vague and abstract
 internationalism might really  mean  on a
 world  scale.  Jones-and  the  Chartists in
 general-represented a transition from Uto-
 pianism to a more scientific approach.  He
 shows mystical trends, errors of judgement,
 and idealism in the understanding of national
 questions.  But those Utopians who in time
 and in direction were really forerunners of
 scientific socialism, should never be belittled.
 Jones' "prophesies" are striking because he
 viewed the future of India from the perspective
 of a distant future when a vast "federated
 Republic" would use all the means discover-
 able by science-including  "the  explosive
 mineral's propelling force"-to benefit man-
 kind, and then-

 But 'twixt  this  dust  and heavens  o'er
 arching span

 Jones' forecast of India's future
 Nevertheless The Revolt of Hindostan belongs
 to the period of the "pre-history" of Com-
 munist theory. India's liberation from foreign
 domination did not, according to this story,
 result in a free republic, but produced a
 strong, centralised semi-feudal national state,
 introducing certain reforms  that made it
 possible to develop a capitalism similar to that
 which already existed in Europe.  In.  this
 part of his poem, Jones described at length
 the stage of social development from feudalism
 to bourgeois capitalism, the birth of the middle
 and working classes, the ever increasing struggle
 of the people against a series of oppressors,
 very much as English history had been in-
 terpreted.  He presented the matter as though
 each nation had to pass through almost an
 identical process, until, at the critical point
 when "monopoloy" became rotten ripe, some-
 where the vast mass of people. would revolt
 and break the vicious circle of the repeated
 rise and fall of nations. Hindostan, therefore,
 was fated to repeat the "mistakes" of Europe,
 but-for reasons that are not at all clear in
 the  poem-she not  only  grew  her  own
 "Chartist"  movement,  but achieved real
 emancipation.  Once that had happened in
 one country, all the peoples of the world, the
 most backward and the most highly civilised
 alike, would rise one after another and throw
 .ofl' their chains.
 Abstract internationalism
 Now in all this,-among other shortcomings
 of political philosophy-the possibility of any
 closer interaction of peoples, of any concretely
 interrelated world history, is scarcely hinted.
 Common cause against common oppressors
 is the underlying moral of the whole poem,
 of course, but there is no suggestion of any
 effective international  co-operation  of the
 oppressed before the world revolution of the
 future.  This ommission alone would show
 us the difficulty of arriving at a world outlook
 in  the eighteen-forties.  An ultimate unity
 of aim; fellow-feeling for democratic move-
 ments abroad; declarations of moral support
 and fraternal greetings, were current among
 the Chartists, even on the "right wing", but
 this internationalism was generally somewhat
 abstract.
 By 1857 Jones' own ideas had broadened.
 In the interval he had reviewed at length
 the experience of the preceding period, seek-
 ing for the causes of the decline in the popular
 movement after 1848.  He was largely res-
 ponsible for drafting the Chartist program
 of 1851, intended to turn the movement into
 a broader, more organised type of political
 party.  One of his formulations precipitated
 a somewhat controversial discussion of the
 colonial issue as a whole,  perhaps for the
 first time in the history of Chartist conventions,
 if we exclude the debates on Irish indepen-
 dence.                                                                         It may be gathered from some of
 his writings that he saw colonial expansion
 as a strenghtening of  the  position  of the
 bourgeoisie against the forces of progress and
 as a danger of the "English system" engulfing
 the whole world unless it were killed early
 in its career.  He began to write articles
 in which he related the colonial question to
 home affairs and working class interests, and
 others in which he spread information as to
 the  conditions in the Col' nies themselves.

 Jones' articles on Indian Revolt of 1857
 Most important of all, in these years he
 had come into direct personal contact with
 Karl Marx.  We need not discuss the history
 of this connection, which is well known, but
 it seems likely that they must also have dis-
 cussed Indian affairs and perhaps collabora-
 ted.  The articles written by Marx between
 May and July 1853,  published in the New
 York Daily  Tribune, cover much the same
 ground and use much the same  material
 as a series of articles published by Jones,
 partly about the same time and partly earlier.
 The probable explanation is that Jones, who
 had obviously read a good deal  of Indian
 history much earlier and had far better oppor-
 tunities of following the affairs of the East
 India  Company,  may have        handed  over
 notes or suggested sources to Marx.  In any
 case it is extremely instructive  to read the
 two sets of articles side by side.  The data
 is all much the same; the presentation and
 conclusions  characteristic  of the  writers'
 differences  in  theory,  temperament     and
 approach.
 In Jones' articles during the Indian war of
 1857 and in some earlier ones, there is an
 attempt to relate the fate of India to the
 interests of the working class in Europe. Jones
 greeted the outbreak of the revolt in 1857 as
 a great event in international struggle against
 oppression-no less significant than that of
 the Polish people against Czarist reaction. He
 took  this stand before the only news reports
 available spoke of anything more serious than
 local mutinies in the army.  All too readily,
 perhaps, he read into Indian events the signs
 of a revolutionary upsurge in the world at large
 and he called on the English workers to seize
 this opportunity for a renewed attack on the
 privileges of their common enemy, the English
 capitalist class.
 New questions
 Jones attempted to answer new questions
 that now presented themselves.  True,  he
 often put them in an ethical rather than a
 political form and his answers were not always
 very adequate, but on the whole they were
 good questions.  Some of them should still
 be thought about seriously.  What should be
 the attitude of the British working class to the
 war in India?  How would an Indian victory
 help the cause at home?      Were the people
 better off for colonial possessions or would they
 benefit by their loss?  Is not the Indian war
 CIA-RDP83-00415R010200020024-9
 as "holy" and just as the national cause of
 the oppressed  peoples of  Europe?  What
 is the class structure in India itself, can a
 peasant  population  achieve a democratic
 order?   What about the feudal princes who
 in the main have betrayed their own people?
 Are they the only leaders?  How is effective
 unity to be reached in    India in order to
 carry out a successful campaign against foreign
 invaders?  Was     Hindu-Muslim unity  rea-
 lisable ?  Are the people of any class better
 off under British rule, as we have been told,
 or are they suffering from the ever increasing
 drive for profits ?  What is the true position
 of peasant expropriation, what really under-
 lies the policy of government and traders?
 What is the truth of the  atrocity stories ?
 Finally :  how can the workers in England
 make common  cause with the  people of
 India and give aid ?  It is noteworthy that
 any English newspaper put such questions
 at that date.  It is not to be confused with
 the liberal or labour  "sympathy" for the
 Indian nationalist movement in the Congress
 phase, but this forgotten page of history does
 reveal the historical reason that afterwards
 obliged any party that made pretensions to
 a progressive and popular platform to give
 at least lip-service to the principle of colonial
 independence.
 Search for a popular basis
 At the same time, Jones  searched for
 every scrap  of news  that  might  reveal  a
 popular basis of the movement in India, for
 signs that something different from the old
 order would have to emerge for the struggle
 to succeed.  He  attempted  to judge     the
 character of the rising and the chances of

 lse whatever middle class radioal opinion
 could be moved to protest against the excess
 of blood vengeance, which he soon realised
 was a mistake.  Week after week in his paper
 and often at public mettings he had driven
 home the main lessons, declaring that the
 cause of freedom was indivisible, exposing
 the policy of the government at home and
 abroad and its responsibility for the fictitious
 role of the East India Company and ended,
 as he had begun, by laying the burden square-
 ly on the shoulders of the capitalist class-free
 traders, pacifists, radicals and mercy-mongers
 included.
 Decline  of Chartism
 Now in these years the organised Chartist
 movement was in decline and disrupted from
 within. Jones himself was in a state of anxiety
 and confusion, committed mistake after mistake
 and became temporarily involved with Bright
 and the radicals in opportunist negotiations
 for an alliance on the franchise question.  At
 that time Marx wondered whether Jones was
 a renegade or only a big fool.        Factions
 within  the  remaining  Chartist leadership
 united to isolate him.  There is no doubt
 now that some of the individuals concerned
 were encouraged from outside.  It is possible
 that anxiety as to the effect of Jones' propa-
 ganda about India when the frenzy of chau-
 vinism fostered by atrocity stories subsided,
 may have hastened the final blow.  Early
 in 1858 Jones faced political bankruptcy and
 financial ruin.  When he was obliged to sell
 his newspaper, he was tricked into an agree-
 ment which he thought guaranteed him a
 partial control of its policy.   No sooner
 was the contract signed than he discovered
 his mistake.  The paper which he had built
 came out openly as his chief slanderer, and
 then ceased publication.  In the last issue
 we may read, side by side Jone's exposure
 of this dirty treachery, his last article on
 India-a bitter exposure of the farce of the
 "mercy" policy designed for the Queens' pro-
 clamation.  The Chartist party was formally
 dissolved.
 Beginning of "connivance" at colonial spoils
 It was no accident that the first serious
 colonial revolt went down to the swan-song
 of Chartism.  The consolidation of British
 capitalism in its leading position in the world
 had to be secured by the repression of the first
 working class movement, which up to 1848 had
 really menaced its stability, and of the colonial
 revolt of 1851.  During those ten years, on
 the basis of an expanding market, liberal-
 radical demagogy had also made some head-
 way among the masses.  Although it was
 still possible to gather some very large meet-
 ings and demonstrations, and on economic
 issues there was some renewal of workers'
 activity from time to time, there was nothing
 of the nation-wide unrest and broad response
 that had, in spite of all its limitations, made
 Chartism a national movement.  The atmos-
 phere was quite unlike  that of the thirties
 and forties.  There was no longer a coherent
 body of opinion to respond to any appeal and
 even the circulation of Jones' articles was
 limited to a small  minority.  In October
 1858 Marx wrote that Jones' mistakes and
 failure were "bound up with the fact that the
 English proletariat is becoming more and
 more bourgeois,  so that this most bour-
 geois of all nations is apparently aiming in
 the end at the possession of a bourgeois aris-
 tocracy and a bourgeois proletariat as well
 as a bourgeoisie."  Up to that point Marx
 himself seems to have had some faith that
 the Chartist movement could rally, in spite
 of the changed conditions.
 In so far as Chartism, vague  and fluid
 as its theroies might be, did lead and colour
 opinion in the working class and petit bour-
 geois masses for two decades (and even those
 historians who try most  earnestly to ridicule
 the Chartist "episode" admit that its influ-
 ence penetrated deep into the remotest corners
 of England, Wales and Scotland), and in so
 far as it had, if not a precise program at any
 rate a defined attitude towards colonial prob-
 lems, whenever they came to the surface of
 consciousness, the lack of protest against the
 "reconquest of India" could almost date the
 beginning of "connivance" at the colonial
 spoils of the ruling class.  Up to then there
 had been vocal disaproval of actions which
 the disenfranchised working class regarded
 as solely in the interest of the wealthy, in-
 cluding the Afghan and Sikh wars. Naturally,
 it serves no purpose to exaggerate the extent
 to which the views of advanced individuals
 or even of the Chartist convention  were
 shared by the rank  and file, nor may we
 speak of "connivance" in any but an abs-
 tract sense.  India herself has borne part of
 the historical inheritance, for no colonial
 country perhaps gained less from the experience
 of the European  proletariat  and inter-
 national movement until comparatively recent
 times.

 Colonial policy of labour movement
 There is a long history behind the ideas
 of the Revolt of  Hindostan and the People's
 Paper. I think that there is sufficient evidence
 to show that the conception of colonial in-
 dependence which the  Chartists associated
 with "social justice" and "democracy", with
 the  interests  of "producers  of  wealth"
 as opposed to the interests of the capitalists
 and aristocracy, was not simply handed on
 from the early middle class liberal reformers,
 republicans or radicals,  who at one time
 condemned the "burden" of colonies or the
 monopoly of the East India Company, when
 a large section of them were cut oil' from the
 benefits of colonial profits. On the contrary,
 an internationalism and a colonial policy
 of a different order developed with and within
 the democratic and early working class move-
 ment and its development was linked with
 the sharpening of conf3cit between the class
 forces in England.  I suggest  that distinct
 phases of this development can   be clearly
 traced in the radical press between 1793 and
 1848, and that the right of colonial peoples
 to full self-determination became one of the
 points  commonly  shared   by Chartists  or
 "democrats",  Owenites or  "socialists", and
 most of those peculiar small  groupings  of
 semi-religious communists  that  sprang up
 in the thrities and forties in England.  All
 these trends contributed to the ideas expressed
 in The Revolt of Hindostan and it is noteworthy
 that  among  the  few   supporters  of Jones'
 1858 Indian peitition are to be found the
 names of many of the middle class one time
 supporters of "moderate"  Chartism and of
 the veteran Owen himself, who were amongst
 the greatest opponents  of the Chartism of
 ,Jones' type.
 Colonial  conquest  was  a  sufficiently
 alive issue at the end of the eighteenth and
 beginning  of  the  nineteenth  century.  It
 brought wars; it had its obvious effects on the
 bread and butter problems of new industry;
 it was reinforced by the interested propaganda
 of the slave emancipationist and anti-mono-
 poly doctrines of middle class parliamentary
 reformers and then by the free traders and
 Leaguers.
 Even in the days of the London Correspon-
 ding Society there is a difference of opinion
 that corresponded not to the division of a Right
 and Left wing attitude to parliamentary re-
 form, but between the main body of leaders
 and the handful of' democrats who wanted
 more than parliamentary reform or who did
 NOVEMBER 1951

 not regard the corruption of the constitution
 as the real cause of social grievance.  Spence,
 most gifted of all our Utopians, regarded
 the monarchy or even the organization of
 the State as secondary considerations.       He
 summed up the difference between his views
 and those of the  Painite  republicans, by
 remarking that the latter could afford to be
 republicans because they did not hope ever
 to be kings, but that they opposed the common
 ownership of land rents and capital goods
 because they could hope to become landlords.
 Consequently his clearly put international-
 colonial policy was also different. The equali-
 ty of nations was a first principle.                                                                       The
 right   of'  self-determination  for colonies
 was based on the right of all to the fruits of
 the  land on  which they  live,  but could
 only be effective in those countries where
 Spensonian society had  been  established.
 Similarly    William Thompson's  important
 contribution to the colonial problem grows
 out of his analysis of the irreconcilable conflict
 between private property and the right of the
 producers.   He  takes  India  itself as the
 illustration for a long analysis of' the typical
 evils of "monopoly"-that is,  the monopoly
 of wealth and power,    not Lite monopoly of
 trade as  opposed to free trade.  The first
 important grouping  to   announce its  class
 character and class aims as such, with the
 remaining anti-Reform Bill Radicals, included
 in their Manifesto a colonial clause based
 on the literal interpretation of the old Rights
 of Man, but in the context of a document
 that has the seeds of a class movement. From
 this followed. throughout the publication of'
 the Poor Man's Guardian, a clarification of the
 ideas of an international common cause of
 the oppressed classes in all countries, a consis-
 tent exposure of free trade doctrines and fairly
 frequent references to events and conditions
 in colonial countries by way of illustration and
 protest.  In 1831 also we meet the first pro-
 gramatic demand for the right of self-deter-
 mination, as distinct from rights of represen-
 tation,  self-government  or  participation                                                                        in
 reforms, for  Ireland  and  all colonies. We
 may also find that when these loose and vague
 statements were interpreted to apply to the
 protection of European colonists only,  such
 interpretations were challenged.  Throughout
 the Chartist conventions there were discus-
 sions and resolutions intended to clarify that
 particularly urgent problem of the relationship
 of the English and Irish peoples, and in this
 form some of the principles of colonial policy

 are first made more concrete.  But whereas
 the history of intermingling populations and
 closer economic and cultural ties made the
 discussion of some form of union more com-
 plex, and the solution was sought in the founda-
 tion of an independent Irish Chartist move-
 ment to act in concert with the English move-
 ment for mutual aid and emancipation, we
 have to conclude from all the evidence available
 that the main body of Chartists envisaged sim-
 ply the evacuation of the more remote colonies
 by British troops, leaving them to their own
 devices, and a vague idea that somehow they
 too  would  come  "under  the  banner  of
 Chartism".  The controversy with O'Conne-
 lites is a most instructive source for differences
 between Chartist  views and bourgeois na-
 tionalism.                             Hence in the forties, while we
 usually associate  the  Fraternal Democrats
 chiefly with the closer connections with conti-
 nental revolutionaries; support of democratic
 nationlist movements in Europe; new ideas
 of possible organisational unity and the agree-
 ment on common aims and principles, that body
 wished to extend its programme to colonial
 countries and made it clear that basic princi-
 ples should be applied universally.  At one of
 the early meetings the discussion was devoted
 to Indian problems in particular. The fact
 that even the existence of any sort of Chartist
 colonial policy has scarcely been recognized
 by later historians, much less studied in greater
 detail, illustrates how completely this tradition
 was obliterated in the second half of the
 nineteenth century.
 Need to study works of British democrats
 During the  conquest of India and the
 post-Reform period,  a powerful democratic
 opinion existed in England which included
 a t,_rudimentary democratic colonial  policy.
 But although the history of modern India
 came to be written so often as an appendage
 to English interests and institutions, the works
 of democrats were never consulted.  Evidently
 they do not seem to contain new "facts", like
 the sacred scriptures of government records
 and the memoirs of Governor-Generals. Yet
 they do contain facts, of a different order,
 essential for evaluating the results of conquest
 for the peoples of both countries and for
 understanding  the process  of international
 developments.  For the study of the back-
 ground of the Indian nationalist movement,
 too, they contain valuable background for
 the European contacts and allies of that move-
 ment and for evaluating the character of that
 movement itself, its place and role in the whole
 liberation  struggle of colonial  peoples,  its
 standards in relation to what is progressive at
 a given period. The old recipe for concocting
 modern Indian history was to concentrate
 on the history of British policy and administra-
 tion in India, and as though this were not
 bad and narrow enough, British policy was
 treated more or less as the personal records of
 Vice-Roys and Generals (with clashes between
 them and the authorities that had appointed
 them, if you pleases).  This is done without
 any reference to the first great clashes of labour
 and capital which shaped the course of Bri-
 tish history as a whole, or to how this problem
 was "solved" by the British bourgeoisie, which
 in turn determined the methods of co-ordina-
 ting colonial resources.  If the British priod
 as a whole cannot be seriously studied without
 bearing in mind all the time that India was
 then drawn into the world market and into
 world  politics,  despite the artificial segre-
 gation, it is also impossible to understand the
 social internal changes that took place as a
 result of that process.
 I have felt for a long time that a better
 co-ordination of the English and Indian as-
 pects of the development towards imperialism
 should be illuminating, disconnected as the
 old writing of history has made them appear.
 The more convinced one may be that India
 has her own national history and destiny,
 the more important it  is to examine  and
 understand the facts of 200 years of foreign
 domination.  It is even more urgent to study
 India from the standpoint  not  merely . of
 British but of world history and external
 relations, to know her international role, both
 passive and active, and to include in that
 world backgorund those progressive and de-
 mocratic forces developing within it as a whole.
 The  differences  in  origin  and  course of
 development of the modern working class in
 Europe and Asia none the less left us with a
 closely  related  destiny  and eventually a
 common struggle towards emanicpation, but
 from the historian's point of view we have not
 yet answered satisfactorily that question of
 interrelation posed one hundred years ago.

 Some notes on the
 Genesis of Indian bourgeoisie
 Suni! K. Sen
 The bourgeoisie has been inseparably linked
 up with the national movement from the very
 beginning.  The democratic evolution of India
 began under British rule when she attained a
 measure of political unification which she never
 did before. The origin of the Indian bourgeoi-
 sie also starts from this period.  The role of
 the Indian bourgeoisie can only be understood
 through a study of its economic development.
 It arose from the specific social and economic
 forces generated within  Indian society under
 conditions which are peculiarly Indian.   The
 evolution of this process of development should
 be studied historically.   I, therefore, begin
 from the beginning.
 Where did Indian Capitalist spring from?
 When England was passing through the
 Industrial Revolution a reverse process of'
 "de-industrialisation " was going on in India.
 After 1757, the East India Company embarked
 upon a systematic policy of destroying India's
 trade  and  manufacture.  The process was
 complete by  1800.  India was transformed
 into an agrarian appendage to Britain, a source
 of raw materials and a market for her ma-
 nufactured goods.  The Indian traders and
 manufacturers  could not  secure  even  the
 middlemen's profits, because the export trade
 was the monopoly of the East India Company
 and conducted in English ships.  The ruined
 traders and manufacturers accepted the job
 of Gomashtas and agents of the British factories
 with which India was dotted.  In 1874 we
 read of a memorial being sent by the Man-
 chestor Chamber of Commerce to the Secretary
 of State pointing to the growth of the Indian
 textile industry and pleading for the abolition
 of the import duties.  From the growth of the
 textile industry dates the emergence of the
 Indian bourgeoisie.    Where did the Indian
 bougeoisie spring from? In other words, what
 is the genesis of the Indian bourgeoisie?
 From the womb of merchant capital
 The Indian bourgeoisie was born, as in
 other countries, in the womb of merchant
 capital.   The Indian bourgeoisie made the
 primary accumulation of  capital  through
 commerce.  The  Tarsi sections invested this
 capital in the building up of modern industry.
 The  Banias, who belonged to the  Marwari
 and Gujrati communities remained as  mer-
 chants and developed as the commercial bour-
 geoisie.
 Marxist terms are not empty words. Each
 term bears a distinct historical connotation.
 The term industrial bougeoisie refers to those
 sections who are associated with modern factory
 industry and should be distinguished from
 the commercial bourgeoisie, whose operations
 remain principally confined to trade, commerce
 and money-lending.   However, a section of
 the Banias, the Gujrati merchants and bankers,
 did invest money in the building up of cotton
 mills in Ahmedabad while simultaneously carry-
 ing on trade and banking operations.
 The Parsi merchants
 The Parsis migrated from Persia sometime
 in the eighth century and settled on the west
 coast of India above Bombay in Surat and
 Broach.  They began to  settle in  Bombay
 when Surat and Broach decayed and Bombay
 took their place as the' commercial centre
 of western India.  They did not  come with
 money and many of them had humble begin-
 nings. We know of one Mr. Framjee Bottlewala
 who was dealing in 1798 with empty bottles
 which was " then a lucrative trade." Kamaji
 Kuver jee, founder of the famous Cama family,
 served as a clerk in the Government Treasury
 in Bombay and rose to a well paid position.
 Mr.  Jamshedji Wadia was building in 1814?
 first class frigates for the  Indian Marine.
 Mr. Nusserwanji Tata, father of Jamshedji
 Tata, began his carrer as a clerk in a country
 Before partition, SUNIL K. SBN was the
 leader of the strong kisan and democratic
 movement in Dinajpur district of Bengal. Now
 he is a refugee in Calcutta and is devoting his
 time to making a study o f the development of
 Indian Capitalism.  This article is an introduc-
 tion to a bigger study on The Evolution of
 the Indian Bourgeoisie.-Editor

 bank at Navsari.
 It was, however, through commerce that
 the Parsis accumulated the necessary capital
 for the building up of modern industry.  "The
 East India Company's ships employed Parsi
 dubashis or agents to manage their investments."
 (Edwards: The Rise  of Bombay).  With the
 growth of the cotton trade, the Parsis came
 to act as brokers for the European importers.
 In 1812, "many of them were very opulent,
 and each of the European houses of agency
 has one of the principal Parsee merchants con-
 cerned with them in most of their foreign spe-
 culations." (Milburn: Oriental Commerce).
 Opium and cotton trade with China
 The removal of the monopoly privileges
 of the East India Company in 1813 gave a
 great impetus to the export trade in raw cotton
 which rose from 30 million lbs. in 1809 to 90
 million lbs. in  1816.  The  Parsis began to
 participate in this expanding  export  trade.
 They built up a network of mercantile firms
 in Bombay  such  as  Messrs.        Hormashji
 Manchesji  Cama's sons;      Messrs.  Dinshaw
 Rustamji & Co.; Nusserwanji & Kaliandas (the
 firm of J. N.  Tata).  't'hey exported mainly
 cotton and opium and the principal customer
 was China. The importance of the China
 trade is evident from the fact that the Parsis
 had  firms at Canton      and  Shanghai.  Mr.
 Rustamji worked as a partner in Messrs.  Rat-
 tanji Hormashji Cama & Co. at Canton.                              Mr.
 Jamshedji Tata opened a firm in China in
 1859 under the name of Jamshetji and Arde-
 shir, and a branch office at Shanghai.                            They
 dealt  mainly in  cotton  and  opium.      In
 return they sent to India consignments of tea,
 silk-goods, camphor, cinnamon, copper, brass
 and china-gold.  (See Mr.  Harris's Life of
 ,7..N. Tata)
 In     1855  Mr.  Rustamji Cama       founded
 the first Indian business house in London.
 The Parsi firms were doing very good business
 and competed with the principal Europeans
 firms of Bombay like Forbes & Co.; John
 Mitchel & Co. etc. In 1848, we read of a memo-
 randum being sent to the Bombay Government
 to inquire into the causes of the decline of the
 cotton trade on behalf of Messrs. Remington &
 Co F orbes & Co. and Jamshetji Jeejeebhoy,
 Sons & Co.-a fact which conclusively proves the
 great importance of the Parsi firm.  By the
 way, Jamshtji Jeejeebhoy was the first Indian
 to be raised to Baronetcy in 1857.
 The godsent opportunities
 In the eighteenth century, the famous inven-
 32
 tions-Hargreave's spinning jenny, Crompton's
 mule, Kay's  flying  shuttle,  Watt's  steam
 engine came in a throng and effected a tech-
 nical revolution in England's textile industry.
 The mass production of goods began, and
 Manchester began to consume an unprece-
 dented quantity of raw cotton.                                                                        The Napo-
 leonic Wars came in 1805.  This was a god-
 sent opportunity for  the Indian  merchants
 who took advantage of the dislocation of the
 European supply and began to export cotton
 in huge quantities. The biographer of Jamshet-
 ji Jeejeebhoy, Mr. Kooverji Sorabjee, writes:
 "During the Napoleonic Wars he shipped
 thousands of bales of cotton.  `Nothing venture,
 nothing win, hazard all, and gain all' was
 his  watch-word."   Between  1807  to  1822,
 Jeejeebhoy amassed two crores of rupees. Then
 came the American Civil War in 1861 which
 shut off Lancashire's supply of raw cotton.
 Prices of Indian cotton reached the skies. The
 export of raw cotton from Bombay rose from
 180 million lbs. in 1850-55 to 424 million lbs.
 in  1863-68. The  export  brought  in large
 amounts of fluid capital. The  total value of
 export  in  one  year,  1864-65 amounted to
 x;30,370,482 sterling.  (Imperial  Gazetteer of
 India, Vol. III).
 The first cotton mills
 The Napoleonic War and the American
 Civil Wars were, therefore the periods of the
 accumulation of capital by the Indian bour-
 geoisie. The first cotton mill was started in Bom-
 bay in 1854 by Cowasji Nanabhoy Davor. By
 the end of 1861, there were nine mills in Bom-
 bay and in 1865, 13 mills in the Bombay Presi-
 dency.                                                                 The boom ended in 1865 with the
 termination of the Civil War.  The nineteenth
 century South Sea Buble burst and crash
 followed.  The "mushroom" companies col-
 lapsed and then came a period of depression.
 After 1875, there was again a veritable boom,
 the number of mills increasing to 51 by 1877.
 If any date is to be emphasized, the year 1877
 marks the turning point in the rise of the
 Indian  bourgeoisie.  Rapid  construction  of
 mills  began  in  Nagpur,    Ahmedabad and
 Sholapur. An array of factory chimneys sprang
 up in   Bombay:   its population   increased.
 Bombay emerged as the capital of the Indian
 bourgeoisie.
 The history of the House of the Tatas whose
 name is associated with the founding of heavy
 industry in India tells the same tale.    The
 Tatas also started as merchants and made
 money in the China trade. The Empress

 Mills, opened in 1877 and named after Queen
 Victoria, who was formally proclaimed Empress
 of India in the same year, and the Swadeshi
 Mills of 1886-so called because of the Swadeshi
 movement, "India for the Indians," which was
 gaining ground since the  foundation of the
 Congress, made unprecedented profits.  Money
 came pouring in, and the Tatas accumulated
 the necessary capital for the building up of
 modern heavy industry like the Jamshedpur
 Iron Works.
 Banias started with hoarded wealth
 The Marwari and Gujrati Banias did not
 lag behind the Parsis in getting rich and accu-
 mulating capital.  But they did it in a different
 way.  While the Parsis became enterprising
 merchants, the Banias flourished as bankers.
 Unlike the Parsis the Banias started with hoard-
 ed wealth.  When  the glory of Rajputana
 vanished, the Rajputs migrated to western
 India and brought with them lumps of gold.
 In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
 a large proportion of the payment for exports
 was taken in gold and silver resulting in huge
 accumulation of bullion.  Gold and silver thus
 accumulated went underground or were con-
 verted into ornaments.   (Leading authorities
 are unanimous on this point.  Even to-day
 the practice of hoarding is inherent among
 tribal races.  There is an interesting chapter
 on  Hoarding in Capital, Vol. III,  Section :
 Money)
 That there were very rich men among
 Banias is evident from the Income-Tax returns
 of Ahmedabad, Surat, Broach, etc., in the
 period 1869-73 (and the Income-Tax returns
 cannot be regarded as exact because the Banias
 must have learnt to evade income-tax even in
 those early days of the British rule) which
 show  that  there were men even after the
 depression of 1865 who  possessed 0100,000
 to #-120,000.  (Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. 4).
 The earliest indigenous bankers
 The Banias are the      earliest indigenous
 bankers of India. During the reign of Aurang-
 zeb we hear of Manek Chand Seth, the most
 eminent banker of his time. Seth Manek Chanel
 had no issue.  He adopted his nephew Fateli
 Chand, who was himself an influential banker
 in Murshidabad, Bengal.  This Fateh Chand is
 no other than the famous (or notorious?) jagal
 Seth-a title which means " world banker".
 The Seths issued hundis or bills of exchange
 which were honoured throughout India.  The
 Bania bankers built a network of banking
 houses in such commercial .centres as Surat,
 Cutch, Bombay, Calcutta, etc.  The difference
 between these bankers and the money-lenders
 is too fine to recognise.  The big shrofs lent
 money to the second class bankers from whom
 the village mahajan borrowed money and these
 "cannibalistic" creatures simply ate up the peas-
 ant once he was in their grip. The indigenous
 bankers held their ground when the Europ-
 ean banks were established.  This was possible
 because the  European  banks financed the
 external trade while the indigenous bankers
 employed their capital in loans to the peasants
 and in financing the internal trade.  (Jain:
 Indigenous Banking in India).
 Agents of the Bombay firms
 Unlike the Parsis , the Banias did not go in
 for commerce, but acted as agents in the pur-
 chase of cotton for the Bombay firms.                                                                        During
 the cotton season they spread out in the cotton
 growing districts and carried on a brisk trade.
 In the early nineteenth century, they also ven-
 tured into opium investments , which speedily
 assumed huge dimensions because of the China
 market.  In 1819-20, they netted one crore of
 rupees.  In 1849, the trade employed fifty
 lakhs of rupees.   (Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. 4).
 It is evident, therefore, that Bania capital was
 derived from money-lending, usury, and middle-men's
 profits in the cotton and opium trade and should be
 distinguished from Parsi capital which was essen-
 tially merchant capital.                                                                       And it was with this
 capital that the Ahmedabad Banias built the
 four cotton mills during 1861 to 1878.
 It is impossible to compute any figures on
 the primitive accumulation of capital by the
 Indian bourgeoisie.  But the capital invested
 in industry was ridiculously small. Probably
 only a small quantity of the hoarded wealth
 came in the market. The total capital of the three
 Ahmedabad mills amounted to merely about
 eighteen lakhs of rupees and the first class
 Empress and Swadeshi mills of the Tatas started
 with only 25 lakhs of rupees. Well, it is a drop
 in the ocean compared to the colossal capital
 accumulation in England derived from the
 loot and plunder of India.  No wonder that
 England became "the workshop of the world"
 in the nineteenth century and India remained
 an agrarian appendage to    that workshop.
 Army of cheap labour
 Capitalism invariably creates a home market
 and an army of free labour. In India the job was
 done by native capitalism.  British manufactur-
 ed goods flooded the Indian market  and
 destroyed the hand-loom industry which was a
 national industry in India and employed thou-

 sands of men and women. The Bombay, Baroda
 and Central Indian Railway with 421 miles
 open and the G. I. P. Railways with 1,287
 miles by 1880-81 not only dealt the final blow
 to the native handicrafts, but also vastly ex-
 panded the market.  On the other hand, the
 string of unsuccessful land-experiments  and
 land settlements resulted in the expropriation
 of the Indian people from their land and the
 creation of an army of landless labour.  The
 rate for agricultural day-labour as quoted in
 the Magistrate's Returns in 1821 and again
 in 1849 was 2 annas per day.  Rice was cut at
 Re 1-8 as. per acre.  The monthly wages of
 male adult operatives in the Ahmedabad mills
 varied from Rs 6 to Rs 7.     (Bomay Gazeteer,
 Vol. 4).  In the Bombay mills "the average
 wages per month are for a girl 10 shillings;
 a woman 16 shilling; a man # 1 12 sh."  This
 was in 1881.  (Imperial Gazetteer of India, Vol..
 III). Indian labour is  not  only  cheap, it is
 the   source of  "super-profits.   In 1881, the
 cotton mills were    paying hundred per cent
 dividends to their share-holders ! Factory laws
 did not bother them and as yet there were no
 trade unions.
 Land relations remained feudal
 Capitalism  developed  simultaneously  in
 agriculture  and  industry in      England. In
 India, however, the cotton mills developed
 on capitalistic lines  while feudal relations
 remained in land.      Cotton cultivation will
 serve as an illustration. Cotton became a
 commercial crop.  The area of cotton culti-
 vation extended from 59,487 acres to 78,079
 acres in Surat and from 66,607 acres to
 124,965 acres in Ahmedabad (Cassels : Cotton in
 Bombay). But cotton was grown not in consolida-
 ted farms, but in innumerable scattered small
 peasant holdings.
 There is an inherent tendency in capitalism
 to expand.  But how is it that Indian capi-
 talism remained mostly confined in 'western
 India till the close of the nineteenth century
 and did not grow in Bengal?  Why is it that
 the Bengali traders and manufacturers,  with
 serveral centuries' experience of trade and
 commerce, could not develop as an industrial
 bourgeoisie like the Parsis or the Banias? Was
 it a national vice ?  No; the reason for it should
 be sought in the      imperialist stronghold in
 Bengal where the British assumed Dewani as
 early as 1765 and completed the land settle-
 ment in 1713.
 The peculiar development in Bengal
 Between 1850 and 1860, foreign imperial-
 ism had established its octopus-grip over coffee
 and tea plantations, on coal mining and on
 jute. And the ruined traders and manu-
 facturers of Bengal acted as agents and gomashtas
 in these foreign industrial undertakings. A good
 many invested money in  land and formed
 the nucleus of the " class of gentlemen pro-
 prietors", a new class of sharks and rapacious
 businessmen who took over the estates of
 the old benevolent Zemindars.  The example
 of  Sir  Dwarkanath  Tagore,   ancestor  of
 I' abindranath, serves as a pointer to this process.
 Dwarkanath had a vision of industrial develop-
 nnent of Bengal.                                                                        He was the owner of a col-
 liery and founder of many indigo-factories;
 he introduced sugar cultivation and founded
 a sugar mill; he promoted the cultivation of
 flax.  By 1834, all his industrial undertakings
 had failed.  With grim  frustration he casti-
 gxated the                                                                        British "for having taken away all
 that the natives possessed;  their lives, liberty
 and property; and all were held at the mercy
 of the Government." Dwarkanath ended as
 a. landlord.  In Bengal there emerged not
 a class of industrial bourgeoisie, but a class
 of petty-bourgeoisie, the sons and grandsons
 of Zemindars who acted as the representatives
 of the educated middle-class.  This was the
 general pattern of Bengal's economic develop-
 ment.  Sir R. N. Mukherjee was only an
 aberration.
 The rise of the bourgeoisie in Europe was
 a revolutionary process, the bourgeoisie rock-
 ing the Ancient Regime, sweeping away feudal
 relics and throwing "career open to talents."
 Blood flowed; Kings and Queens and nobles
 lost their heads.  In India there was no such
 development.       The Indian bourgeoisie arose
 not in opposition to feudalism.  Men with
 money themselves became transformed into the
 new class of landlords  (Dwarkanath Tagore,
 the Rays of Bhagyakul;  the  Chettys;  the
 Sowcars, etc).     Hence the unbroken fraternal
 relations between the two classes.
 First rumblings of discontent
 In the beginning of'its career, the Indian
 bourgeoisie presented a picture of entente cor-
 diale with foreign imperialism.  They traded
 in British ships.  Their mills were fitted with
 British machinery and the mill-managers and

 Hajrah Bedglum
 The silent town
 It was in Mau, Azamgarh District, that the
 unnatural quiet of  the streets, struck me.
 A small town of some 30,000 inhabitants, mostly
 weavers, living in congested mohallas, Mau
 should have been ringing with the laughter
 and shouts of children. I asked my companion
 the reason for this hush over the city.
 "During the last month or so, about 4,000
 children and older persons have died of small
 pox," was the reply, " `Hardly a house has
 escaped."
 Aghast I stared at him.  More than  a
 tenth of the population wiped out in a month?
 Could this not have been prevented?
 "We have no hospital for women and
 children."  My companion quietly replied :
 "Last year nearly Rs 80,000 were willingly
 contributed by the  weavers' families for a
 women's hospital, but no one knows what be-
 came of that money, we have not even seen
 the blue-print of a hospital yet!"
 12 thousand women belonging to the fami-
 lies of the weavers work in Mau from morn to
 night, 12 thousand pairs of hands send  the
 shuttle  flying back  and forth so that the
 people of this country may be clothed.  The
 weavers are Muslims and the lives of the women
 are confined to the mud enclosures round the
 looms which are their homes.  The houses
 are damp and dark, there is no sanitation, no
 drainage in the town.  Can one then wonder
 at the high incidence of disease?
 Why is there no provision of a hospital,
 a lady doctor, a midwife in this place?  What
 became of the 80,000 rupees collected? What
 happened to the lakhs collected in the name
 of Kasturba ? What became of the Congress
 pledges for building a happy and prosperous
 free India?
 Shyamratti, the mother of heroes
 In the gateway of the District Jail, Ballia,
 a little boy of six was playing with pebbles.
 "What is your  name?  "I asked him.
 "Shyam Narain". His smile was shy yet it
 had a gleam of impishness.
 "Where do you live?"
 "In the Jail"
 NOVEMBER 1951
 "What do you get to eat in the jail?
 "Dal Bhat"
 "Don't they give you gur?"
 "Sometimes,  when someone  deposits it"
 His eyes were wistful.
 Later I met his mother,  Shyamratti, who
 along with her two sons Phool Badan and
 Kapil Dev is amongst the accused in the Ballia
 cases.
 How did it come about that this elderly
 woman, mother of three sons, with an intelli-
 gence not above the average, with no educa-
 tion, came to be involved in political cases
 of this nature?
 Kapil Dev was interested in the Kisan
 Sabha.  He had worked in Calcutta and came
 in touch with the Red Flag.  The blind Kisan
 leader of Ballia, Baijnath Sharma used to visit
 him often and the Zamindars' goondas knew
 of this. One day they waylaid him and start-
 ed beating  Sharmaji.   Kapildev when he
 rushed  to the rescue, was  also  subjected
 to lathi blows.  The youngest brother Shyam
 Narain on hearing his brother's cries rushed
 out and caught hold of the Zamindar's legs.
 The Zamindar Saheb threw the boy on the
 ground and put his foot on the little chest.
 Shyamratti had seen all this.  The  iron
 had entered her soul.  Never more would
 she submit to the tyranny of the Zemindars.
 Next time when the    Zemindar's  men,
 .thinking the property to be unprotected came
 to plough up Kapil 1)ev's fields, it was Shyam-
 ratti who rushed out at the Zemindar Saheb.
 Only by smashing her skull and rendering
 her unconscious could the zemindar's men get
 rid of this fury of outraged motherhood.
 A new faith springs up in women's hearts
 Shyamratti, Singhasini,  Sukhvansa, Kusmi
 and several others, illiterate  peasant women,
 harijans and khet mazdoors, founded their Jan-
 wadi Mahila Sangh and challenged the world.
 Numerous are the stories of how the jathas
 of women toured entire  areas, rousing  and
 mobilising men and women for the defence
 of the land, for a higher daily wage, for pro-
 tecting the honour of women.
 In Kasmabad, Ghazipur district, the peo-

 ple still recall with a smile how the village
 women taught a lesson to the thanedar who
 dared enter a house and lay hands on the
 mother of the family.  With their broom-
 sticks and rolling pins, the women drove out
 the thanedar while the children of the village
 made free with his horse.
 In Ballia it was the fisherwomen who had
 refused to accept the imposition of a fresh tax
 on the village pond by the zemindar.  When
 the police  arrived in the  village  at the
 urgent summons of the zemindar, they could
 see no sign of the zemindar who was locked
 up in his pukka house nor could they think
 of some  cogent reason for arresting the un-
 armed women surrounding the house and
 demanding the withdrawl of the taxes.
 The militant participation of the women's
 jathas in the strike of the khet-mazdoors for higher
 wages, their rousing songs, their courage and
 daring in the face of police provocation are
 byewords in the Eastern Districts.
 A new courage, a new faith was inspired in
 the hearts of women.
 Sukhva nsa-the symbol of courage
 Swift was the action of the government.
 In village after village the armed police force
 swooped down.  They rounded up, beat up,
 and arrested as many militant kisan and Khet-
 mazdoor workers as they could. They took as col-
 lective fines and bribes as much money as could
 be squeezed out of the impoverished villagers.
 They took away all they could and what they
 could not take away they wantonly destroyed.
 Kerosene oil was poured onto bags of grain
 and jars of ghee were smashed on the ground.
 In Jaunpur, Sultanpur, Ghazipur, Ballia,
 Azamgarh, Gorakhpur, and the rest of the
 Eastern Districts in the first half of 1950, a reign
 of terror prevailed.  Hundereds were arrested,
 hundreds hid from the terror.  The biggest
 manhunt in the history of the Eastern districts
 was on.
 Did a single woman betray ? Did any one
 break down ?
 Murli's mother nursed her son back to
 consciousness.  Once the sturdiest peasant in
 the village, he was rendered a cripple now
 because of the repeated blows on his instep.
 "Where is Sarju Pandey ?"  Was what the
 police wanted to know.  One word from
 Murli's mother could have saved her son a
 lifetime's torture but the word was not uttered.
 From Pali's house they snatched up a three
 days old baby and dashed the soft body on
 the ground.  The baby died within three days
 but neither then nor later did Pali utter a word
 of complaint or waver in her determination
 to fight for a happier future for all kisan child-
 ren.
 Kusmi's children were just rescued from the
 fire which razed her house to the ground.
 Again and again the zemindar and the autho-
 rities demanded :"Give up the fight for land and
 bread, denounce your comrades and you shall
 be rewarded."  Kusmi withstood the beating
 and torture, and with greater vigour joined in
 the campaign against repression.
 Sukhvansa's name was a symbol of daring
 courage in Basti and the neighbouring areas.
 No zemindar's goonda dared lay hands upon
 her, no policeman relished facing this impetuous
 young Harijan girl.  Lithe as a finely tempered
 steel blade Sukhvansa time and again  faced
 the police and the zemindars' lathials. Bare-
 handed she would turn upon the armed men
 and dare them to shoot a woman, would shame
 them into lowering their loaded guns; would
 rally the wavering crowd of men behind her.
 Sukhvansa did not take into account the
 bravery of Lal Bahadur Shastri, his  daring
 which could even sanction firing on unarmed
 women.  With a bullet in her leg Sukhvansa
 was carried to the thana.  For months she lay
 in hospital, her life hanging in the balance.
 Due to negligence gangerene had set in and
 her leg was amputated.     They maimed the
 lioness but they could not break her spirit.
 Even when she was dangerously ill the
 rigorous restrictions placed on her were not
 relaxed.
 "Once a nurse whispered to me that a man
 from my village had come to the hospital to see
 me.  She pointed to the window and I made an
 effort and raised myself.  A friend from my
 village was truly outside, but the sentry saw my
 movement and blocked the view."
 Sukhvansa told me this when I met her in
 the Ballia court-room.
 "Sukhvansa," I said "Women from all over
 the province greet you and are proud of you."
 "Sukhvansa had tears in her eyes.   "I did
 nothing which I would not gladly do again."
 She said, "But I have grown so weak.  The
 loss of blood .... "  I saw that she was trem-
 bling.
 Can repression stop revolt of the hungry?
 Four hundered men and women in Ballia,
 two hundred and fifty in Ghazipur, and several
 others in    Sultanpur, Gorakhpur, Jaunpur,
 Azamgarh, Basti, are facing trials arising from

 skirmishes between the kisans and zemindars.
 Lal Bahadur Shastri and his minions had tried
 to quell the movement of the kisarrs of the
 Eastern Districts  by posting  armed  police,
 imposing collective fines, and putting an iron
 curtain around the entire Eastern districts. But
 even the Congress government cannot hide
 facts.
 The food minister is forced to declare that
 the food situation in Eastern U. P. is critical,
 The newspapers publish figures of the cloth
 shortage which has made it impossible for
 women to stir out of their houses.  The wage
 for a day's work is still two pice to three pice in
 Ballia, Ghazipur and Sultanpur.     Small-pox
 together with the usual diseases-malaria, phila-
 ria and berry-berry has played havoc with the
 families of the kisans.  No alternative occupa-
 tion in the shape of industrial labour is avail-
 able to the land hungry peasants.
 Can repression stave off the revolt of the
 hungry and the naked?
 Already the signs of a new movement for
 democratic liberties are visible.  To demand
 the release of their beloved leaders the peasants
 of the Eastern Districts are collecting funds,
 putting up posters, chalking up slogans and
 holding conferences and rallies.
 Undaunted the women are in the forefront
 of this movement.

 Krishan Chandar's Art

 Short Stories and Sketches by Krishan Chander.
 Publisher:  Current Book House,  Bombay.
 Pages 99 ; price Rs. 2/4
 Krishan Chander today is one of the most
 notable progressive writers in India, and a
 translation of his representative work into
 English and other foreign languages was long
 overdue as a step towards his introduction to a
 wider international audience.  His Letter lo a
 Dead Man coupled with his work for the Peace
 Movement had aroused much curiosity about
 his work among foreign democratic circles and

 Manatora of Sultanpur
 To me the future of this movement is symbo-
 lised by Manatora of Sultanpur.  This young
 peasant girl, a picture of strength and vibrating
 vitality had helped to organise a meeting of
 three thousand kisan men and women in Kadi-
 pur for demanding withdrawal of the Ballia
 cases and had gone from door to door to collect
 money for the Relief Fund.  At night there
 was the women's meeting which finished by
 about midnight.  Manatora's home was on
 the other bank of the Gomti.
 "How will you go back, Manatora ?"  I
 asked her, "Is there some one to take you home
 at this time of the night ?"
 Manatora's white teeth flashed in a brilliant
 smile.  "How will I go home ?  I shall row
 myself across.  Many's the time when I rowed
 across comrades from one bank of the river
 to the other at dead of the night. What have
 I to be afraid of ? Do I not know every twist
 and turn of the river and the banks here?
 Does not every man and woman know me?"
 Indeed our workers are known and are dear
 to the heart of every man and woman in their
 villages.  When  Manatora's  brother-in-law
 protested at her activities saying that it was
 shameful for Manatora to go from door to door
 begging for funds, it was Manatora's mother
 who rebuked him.
 "It is not shame that Mantora brings to your
 household;" she said, " It is honour, my son."

 come very necessary. We, therefore, welcome
 this little book as the first of a series introdu-
 cing India's younger generation of outstanding
 writers to international circles.
 Early writings
 Krishan Chander has now been writing
 for well over fifteen years.  He first made his
 mark as a writer of elegant, satirical sketches
 notable for their feline grace and beauty.
 There was in them an undertone of discontent
 with the existing state of thing, but a certain
 cynicism and ennui as well.  There were in
 them dreams of love and beauty, but it
 appeared there was no hope of ever realising
 them in life.  When Krishan Chander was

 Approved For Release 2001/09/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415R010200020024-9
 writing these early stories of his, he had already
 been drawn into  the  drogressive Writers'
 movement and was functioning as the Secre-,
 tary of its Lahore unit.  This was in the
 Thirties, when the movement was still young.
 Since then Krishan Chander's art has
 moved forward with rapid strides  towards
 greater freedom and power.   He plunged
 himself increasingly into social and cultural
 movements, and his art has gained thereby
 immense range, variety and depth. Krishan
 Chander was one of the chief organizers and
 sponsors of the Indian Anti-Fascist Writers'
 Conference held at Delhi in May 1943.  He
 was in that period showing some leaning to-
 wards Royism, but fortunately soon recovered
 himself.  The example of Agyeya, the well-
 known Hindi writer who organized the noto-
 rious Freedom of Culture Conference recently
 shows where this inclined plane of R'oyism
 leads ultimately in art.as well as politics.
 From victory to victory
 Krishan's art after this phase moves for-
 ward from victory to victory.  He wrote his
 long short-story Annadata during the days of
 the Bengal Famine, later translated into Eng-
 lish under the title I Cannot Die.  During the
 great Indian naval uprising he wrote Three
 Goondas which movingly describes the stirring
 scenes  in  Bombay  during  that  event.
 Peshawar Express included in this volume was
 written during the communal holocaust which
 followed the partition of India.  He main-
 tained this tempo in his writing,                        pouring
 out one story after another as terror and
 repression gripped the land.  The Progres-
 sive Writers' movement made serious mistakes
 in this period, from which it has been making
 earnest efforts to recover.   Krishan Chander
 helped to rehabilitate the Peace Movement
 which had assumed a very narrow base in this
 country.  He became the Secretary of the All
 India Preparatory Committee and has made
 remarkable  contribution      in  widening the
 movement and giving to it a genuine national
 character.
 To this last phase of his work belong such
 stories as Queen of Hearts and Letter to a Dead
 Man.  The   other  stories  included in this
 volume belong to the years just proceeding
 the outbreak of war in Korea.   This volume
 Flame and the Flower gives one a very good. idea
 of the kind of work Krishan Chandar is doing
 to-day.
 Included in this  volume are stories on
 foreign themes-the    Korean war and the
 Franco torror  in Spain;  sketches like The
 Flowers are Red and The Bridge of Mahalaxmi
 which are cross-sections from the life of the
 working class in a big industrial city like Bom-
 bay; there are wonderful pictures of the ro-
 mance and beauty of this world, also its sorrows
 and tears, such as The Night of the Full Moon
 and the The Poet, the Philosopher and the Clerk.
 Intense social awareness
 There is in these stories much native strength
 and power.  They have in them an intense
 social awareness and an earnest desire to use
 the artist's gift for the service and betterment
 of the people.  Krishan Chander speaks out
 boldly on behalf of oppressed humanity in this
 land.  Examples of such writing are The Flo-
 wers are Red and The Bridge of Mahalaxmi.  In
 the latter story he speaks of six saries, symbolical
 of the life of toil and drudgery of Indian wo-
 manhood from the lowest social sub-stratum.
 He speaks with similar passion about the suffer-
 ing of people in other lands.  His passion is a
 blazing fire, a flaming sword, for his tears have
 all dried up in his hatred for oppression and
 cruelty.  In his Letter to a Dead Man he says:
 "Only now I have no tears for you, I have shed
 my tears a long time ago, because I have seen
 a great deal of misery and social injustice in my
 own land.  Let me assure you that I have
 nothing but a flaming anger and a pure hatred
 against the men who sent you to death in Korea.
 The words in which Krishan Chander des-
 cribes the song of the blind boy would also be
 very telling description of the passionate human-
 ism of his own work: "Then I took this thirsty
 and starved and  naked song to my blind
 friend.  And in this song of ours he put all the
 insight of his blind being, all the anguish of
 his suffering soul, all the light of his  dark
 work.    And then the song became a sword.
 And when he sang the song, it was like a thou-
 sand naked swords dancing before the mill."
 There is in the art of Krishan Chander
 great and overflowing love of the land, its rich
 brown and green earth, its golden corn, its
 great rivers, its songs of the loves of Heer
 Ranjha, Sohni and Mahinwal, its dark-eyed men
 and women with their dreams and sorrows.
 The course of his stories is like the course of
 a song which conjures up ancient memories,
 present woes and future hopes.
 These future hopes are uttered in the fol-
 lowing eloquent words:  "This earth of ours,
 though peace lies thinly and precariously over
 it, is a vast big and a very beautiful place. We
 can all live happily here.  It has vast fertile
 plains, rich in wheat, oats, maize and cotton,

 large undulating hills and mountainous regions
 abounding in wild life, mineral ore and timber,
 great rivers and lakes hiding hydroelectric
 energy in their bosom. We could all live here
 happily in evergrowing luxury and comfort."
 (Letter to a Dead Man.)
 Such art is a powerful weapon in the move-
 ment  for Peace extending in ever-widening
 circles all over the world.  Krishan Chander
 tears off the mask from the cruel, mean faces
 of the war-mongering Mac Arthrurs and creates
 in the hearts and minds of the readers a healthy
 contempt and hatred for them.
 Vivid historical imagination
 Among the most notable features of Krishan
 Chander's art are his vivid historical imagina-
 tion which enables him to recall without effort
 the ancient past of makind with its memories
 of struggle and victory, defeat and progress;
 his mastery of the lively detail which creates
 a picture with an utmost economy of strokes;
 his overflowing love of nature  which bursts
 repeatedly  through his  narrative, painting
 lively scenes of this land and others - America
 with its "vast  plains, and millions of clean
 hands   working  to its  mighty  rhythm in
 the  great  American     hinterland". Africa
 "of dark forests and green prrots, blue lakes
 and  colourful giraffes", and the beauty of
 Kashmir and  the  Panjab painted  through
 many    rich, memorable  pasages.   Above
 all there is the gift of his imagination which
 enables him to create vividly scenes and people
 never seen, but made to live in an unforget-
 table manner.                       This enables him to   create
 Korea more richly and vivdly than anything
 done by people who have seen and experienced
 the living horror in their own person. This
 enables  him to describe the barbaric descent
 of Punjab to the lowest depths of degradation
 and shame, and many other similar  things
 burnt into  the   Indian  memory  through
 these last years. The secret of this success
 lies in his extreme sensitiveness and quick
 response to impressions.
 Great command over language
 Among the assets of Krishan Chander's
 art, mention should be made of his great com-
 mand over language.  In the original                       Urdu
 his prose has a rare, superb quality.  His vo-
 cabulary is rich in variety and range of in-
 flexion.  It has a tender, lyric tone on occasion,
 as in his descriptions of love and the beauty
 of nature.  Such is the quality of his prose in
 The Night of the Full Moon.  It can be biting

 and satirical and achieves great denunciatory
 power when occasion demands it.  It is a most
 supple and nervous prose, sensitive and strong,
 and in his command over the magic of words,
 their beauty, music and power lies one of the
 main charms of Krishan Chander's writings.
 In the English translation the innate quality
 of his prose has been adequately preserved,
 though the full flavour and  beauty  of the
 original can never be  completely realised.
 Some have  complained  at  times  that
 Krishan Chander builds too much on imagi-
 nation.  Krishan  Chander                                                                      has       now been
 writing for almost two   decades.    By all
 standards he is a modern  Indian Classic.
 Through these years his art has continually
 gained in stature, till it has become reprsen-
 tative of all that is best and                                                             ablest in our coun-
 try.   But we would like him to                                                                          move still
 nearer to Mother Earth, so that we may have
 from his pen more  and more living portraits
 of our peasant masses and proletarians as well
 as those of the oppressed, spiritually hungry
 intellgentsia.  We also hope that he  would
 now begin to build on the grand scale instead
 of working only in  miniature.  This we say
 with a full appreciation  of  his  manifold
 achievements and with no small admiration for
 his work done so far.
 Genesis of Indian bourgeoisie

 heads of departments were mostly British. The
 mercantile restrictions no longer operated and
 British free trade capitalism was in its heyday
 of prosperity.  Britain was the most dominat-
 ing power in international trade, exporting
 70 per cent of the cotton cloth entering the
 world market.   In the closing years of the
 nineteenth  century,  the  monopoly position
 of Britain was being seriously threatened by
 new rising nation-states like Germany  and
 Japan.  Free-trade capitalism gave place to
 finance-capitalism. In 1882, the import duties
 on cotton were abolished. The first rumblings
 of discontent of the Indian bourgeoisie begin
 to be heard.   They had already established
 themselves in the Indian market and had at
 their command huge capital resources. And the
 number of cotton mills increased to 58 in 1880.
 In. 1885, the Indian National Congress was
 formed which was to be the platform of opposi-
 tion of the rising bourgeoisie in the subsequent
 period.  In 1886, Tata christened his new co-
 tton mills as Swadeshi Mills.  The basic econo
 mic conflict between imperialism and the colo-
 nial bourgeoisie had begun to unfold itself. ,.

 Parties and Politics
 The Patiala and East Punjab States' Union
 (PEPSU)  comprises of. eight East  Punjab
 states--Patiala,  Nabha,  Jind, Kapurthala,
 Faridkot, Malerkotla, Kalsia and Nalagarh.
 It is spread over an area of 10,119 sq. miles.
 The population, according to  1941 census,
 was 34.24 lacs.   With the migration of Mus-
 lims to Pakistan, the population came; down
 to 2511 lacs.     The total number of refugees
 settled in these states is in the neighbourhood
 of 61 lacs.  The up-to-date population of the
 PEPSU, after exchange of refugees following
 partition of India, is, according  to  census
 figures of 1951, about 33 lacs.
 Annual treasury receipts in the PEPSU
 amount to about Rs. 5 crores.      Nearly ten
 per cent of the budget receipts, Rs. 50 lacs,
 are paid in the form of pensions and privy
 purses to sustain eight princely families.  Two
 major sources of state revenue in the PEPSU
 are land revenue and excise tax.  Rs. 1
 crores are realised from Excise alone!
 General Elections on basis of adult fran-
 chise will be a novelty in this small border
 union where democratic institutions are com-
 pletely unknown so far.  It would be the first
 chance for the people here to go through the
 experience of exercising the right to  vote to
 elect their representatives for running the
 parliamentary institutions.  About 18 lacs of
 voters from 38 towns, big and small, and
 6,166 villages would be electing 60 represent-
 atives for the State Legislature and five for
 the House of People.  Out of sixty seats of
 the PEPSU State Assembly, 10 have been
 reserved for the scheduled castes.
 Post-war upsurge
 As elsewhere in princely India, mighty
 people's movements swept over East Punjab
 States in the post-war period.  These :move-
 ments suffered serious set-back when following
 the  partition, princes, jagirdars and their
 imperialist masters fomented, organised and
 conducted communal disturbances to divide,
 uproot and destroy the people's unity in their
 struggle for political and economic emanci-
 Tara Chand Gupta is the Convener of the
 People's Democratic Front of the PEPSU.-Editor
 in PEPSU
 Pation.
 By  the beginning  of the  year  1948,
 the communal frenzy had died down and
 people were  again  settling  down  to their
 daily  life of toil and labour. The snapp-
 ed                                                                      thread  of struggles  was   taken  up
 and surprisingly enough even after the havoc
 wrought by post-partition riot-wave, people's
 movement again gathered momentum within
 the brief' span of a few months. The peasants
 marched on the capital -city of Faridkot and
 captured  the  Secretariat.   Thousands  of
 villagers surrounded the Dadri fort in Jind
 state and forced the military unit to uncondi-
 tionally  surrender.   Militant                                                                          tenants  of
 Patiala state mustered in their thousands.
 They held mass demonstrations in the streets
 of Patiala demanding liquidation of Maharaja's
 autocratic rule.  Even the  might of Patel
 was proving ineffectual in shielding the princes
 from the rising tide of mass anger of the states'
 people.  So the eight princely states of East
 Punjab were lumped together and formed into
 a union with Maharaja of Patiala crowned
 as the Rajpramukh.
 In the initial stages when  the  Punjab
 Riyasati Prajamandal was christened into the
 PEPSU Provincial Congress Committee, there
 was an influential section of kisan workers in
 the organisation.  After the formation of the
 PEPSU the right-wing Congress leaders tried
 their best to strike bargain with the Maharaja
 but the kisan leaders having links with peasant
 masses stood in their way, so much so that
 Patel set up a care-taker ministry with the
 Maharaja's own uncle as the Chief Minister.
 The Right-wing Congress leaders, however,
 continued playing at their favourite game of
 channelising  the  agrarian unrest  and  the
 general feeling of frustration into the narrow
 mould of constitutional agitation for their
 ministry formation.     The Maharaja bought
 over a couple of extreme right-wing Congress
 leaders and Patel set up a new hybrid ministry.
 This ministry, with  Maharaja's  uncle  still
 as the Chief Minister, ushered in a reign of
 terror.  Half a dozen tenants were shot dead
 at Kishengarli.  But the kisans refused to be
 terrorised.  .They fought back..  Even the poor

 town-dwellers were roused to militant action,
 so much so that a notorious Sub-Inspector
 of Police at Malerkotla who had criminally
 assaulted a minor virgin girl fell a victim to
 an angry crowd of citizens. Warrants of arrest
 were issued for left-wing Congress leaders.
 They were forced to go underground.  Many
 were detained.
 Such was the universal hatred against this
 ministry that Patel had to wind up the show
 ten months after, in November, 1949. Another
 caretaker ministry on the basis of 50:50 re-
 presentation between the Maharaja and the
 States Ministry dragged on in isolated existence
 for over 15 months till in May this year,
 after the death of Sardar Patel, Nehru installed
 the three-group Congress ministry in power
 with  the notorious  imperialist agent Col.
 Raghbir Singh as the Chief Minister.  The
 express purpose of this on-the-eve-of-elections
 ministerial set-up is to manoeuvre the elections
 for the Congress Party through the agency
 of official heirarchy.
 Misdeeds of Congress
 Congress rulers, through their patronage
 of Rajwara-shahi have helped in the conso-
 lidation of the extreme Right-wing communal-
 cum-fascist organisations.  Akalis were  the
 first to go into action aganist the foisting of the
 anti-people ministry of the PEPSU Congress
 leaders.  Their action, of course, was frothy
 and their slogans hollow. But they took ad-
 vantage of the situation and organised huge
 anti-ministry demonstrations.  Effigy of the
 ministry was taken out in procession, beaten
 with shoes and burnt at Patiala, Bhatinda and
 Sangrur.  Black flag demonstrations were held
 against ministers wherever they went.
 Hot-headed, arrogant, but essentially weak and
 corrupt Brish Bhan, State Congress leader, fairly
 popular among the city middle class before he became
 the Deputy Chief to Col. Raghbir Singh, proved
 to be a source of weakness rather than strength to
 the new ministry.  Tormented with internal con-
 flict, bossed over by the ICS Regional Commissioner,
 gripped by the mortal fear of dismissal at any moment
 and lacking support of any section of the population,
 the ministry lives on newsprint publicity in the
 isolated `grandeur' of their bungalows in Baradari
 gardens at Patiala.
 No wonder then that the police baton has
 been in frequent use to break up demonstrations.
 Men and women have been thrashed, arrested
 and locked up in prison.  Civil liberties have
 been blotted out.
 In every part of the Union thousands  of
 tenant families are being ejected from fields,
 they have been tilling fbr generations. Police
 and the goonda squads of landlords go about
 striking terror in the countryside. Three kisans
 were shot dead recently at village Bishenpura,
 allegedly  by  the  Mukhtiar  of  Biswedar
 Jaswant Singh Jeji. Tenant Jai Singh's minor
 daughter Tej Kaur was reported to have been
 criminally assaulted by a police constable at
 village Narendrapura in Mansa Tahsil.  120
 men, women and children were taken into
 police custody  at village Bakhora.  Bare-
 headed women with their hands tied behind
 their backs were marched through village
 streets.  Eighteen-year-old Hamir Kaur was
 removed to Sangrur and thrown by the road-
 side to shift for herself along with her baby,
 hardly three weeks old.  Biswedar Teja Singh
 was reported to have employed 40 goondas
 armed with guns to drive off several tenant
 families from village Chonegra in  Patiala
 district.
 Labour in the factories at Hamira, Phag-
 wara, Rajpura, Surajpur, Nabha, Dadri, Bha-
 tinda, Malerkotla and Patiala is at the mercy
 of monoply-capitalists Dalmia, Birla, Karam.
 chand Thapar, Seth Gujarmal Modi of U. P.
 and others like them.  Trade Union legislation
 remains only on paper.   The proprietors are
 minting millions, but the workers are forced
 to work for long hours on starvation wages.
 Education accounts for 15 per cent of the
 budget,  whereas the expenditure on police
 exceeds 19 per cent.     Fees are high but teaching
 arrangements  are        altogether  unsatisfactory.
 Bhatinda Intermediate results this year were
 9%!
 Having lost face in municipal elections,
 the Congress Ministry has decided to have no
 more elections.  It is busy smuggling undesir-
 able persons in town and city municipalities
 through nomination !
 Alliance with feudal, communal forces
 The Congress in the PEPSU, therefore, is
 functioning through three different bodies to
 `capture'  power in the coming  elections.
 There is the official Congress, purged of all
 progressive elements  and with opportunists
 in leadership, trying to establish perpetual
 control over the P. C. C. machine.   Then,
 there are the landlords.   Thirdly, the Akalis
 will contest seats only to join the Congress
 Assembly Party after elections are over. In
 spite of wordy swordrattling against communal-
 ism, Congress rulers are mighty glad that

 Akalis still have some sort of slippery hold on
 the middle class Sikh youth and a substantial
 section of rich peasants. Master Tara Singh
 has established his headquarters at Patiala.
 A few weeks back, he staged the big show of
 Mahasamagam when some 75 thousand Sikhs
 gathered at Patiala to revitalise `spiritualism'!
 Landlords and the Princes  are in this
 way trying to impress upon  the  Congress
 .rulers their  influence with the Sikh masses
 with a view to drive as hard a bargain with
 their erstwhile patrons as possible.
 Formation of People's Democratic Front
 It is a pity that it took full three months
 to work out the idea of People's Front into
 concrete reality in the PEPSU.  Had  the
 front been in existence at the time of the for-
 mation of Congress  Ministry in May last,
 the Congress could have  been smashed to
 pieces.  There was a stage when 80 Congress
 leaders met in a convention at Patiala and
 decried the formation of the ministry in al-
 liance with Colonel Raghubir Singh.  But
 they had no place to go to.  There was no
 transitional  organization  which  they could
 join in order to fight against the reactionary,
 corrupt Congress leaders.
 But in spite of it all, it is nothing short
 of a miracle that the    People's Democratic
 Front has been brought into existence in the
 PEPSU.  The two Communist Parties,  Lal
 and the official, had bitter memories offratricidal
 quarrel. Such, however, is the demand of the
 hour that every section of radicals mustered
 promptly at the very first call of the Commu-
 nist Party to unite popular forces against Cong-
 ress misrule.  On the 19th of August, about
 150 prominent publicmen of the PEPSU came
 together at Sangrur and decided to lay the
 foundations of the People's Democratic Front.
 The front is a coalition of the Communist
 Party, Lal Communist Party, Forward Bloc,
 former  Congressmen who had recently  left
 Congress as a protest against the betrayal by
 the  PEPSU  Congress leaders,  independent
 radicals and Left Socialists.
 The Programme of the Front
 It is an electoral coalition on the basis of
 a concrete  programme.   The     programme
 includes:
 (1)  Abolition of Biswedari without com-
 pensation.
 (2)  Distribution of lands  belonging to
 jagirdars and princes  among poor peasants
 and Khet Mazdoors on the principle of `Land
 to the Tiller'.
 (3) Higher wages for  factory and office
 workers and recognition of trade union rights.
 (4) Repeal of Sales Tax Act.
 (5) Free elementary education for all, reduc-
 tion in education fees and provision of stipends
 for needy students in institutions of higher
 education.
 (6) Ensuring supply of cheap raw  mate-
 rials and otherwise protecting small factory-
 owners against the competition of monopoly
 capitalists.
 (7) Re-settlement  of refugees  on land,
 in. business and starting of new industries to
 absorb the unemployed.
 (8) Ensuring price stabilization and en-
 forcing price control and adoption of effective
 measures against corruption.
 (9) Abolition of Raja-shahi; pensions and
 privy purses of princes and their relatives to
 be stopped and their capital and lands to
 be confiscated. '
 (10) Creation of provinces on the language
 principle.
 (11) Repeal of Safety  Acts,  release  of
 political detenus and  prisoners, and with-
 drawal of punitive police posts from tenancy
 villages.
 (12) (a)  Withdrawal  of India From the
 British Commonwealth of Nations and re-
 moval of all Britishers from the armed forces.
 (b) India to work for  world  peace in
 alliance with the peace-loving Governments
 and peoples of Russia, China and the coun-
 tries of Eastern Europe.
 Bringing together all the radical elements
 on one common platform on the basis of a
 concrete programme of action is a solid achieve-
 rrient.   The response has been tremendous.
 It is for the first time that a planned campaign
 of mass political education has been launched
 in the PEPSU in a methodical way.
 Bright future ahead
 The task ahead, no doubt, is uphill.    Big
 chunks of city youth are still under the spell
 of fascist ideologies of the R. S. S. and the
 Akali Dal.  Nearly 30% of the arable land
 in the PEPSU belongs to a handful of jagirdars
 and the seven princely families.  Maharajas
 of Patiala, Kapurthala and Faridkot,  these
 three alone, own capital of about two crores
 in the form of extensive farms, tea and fruit
 gardens, palaces, and shares in industrial con-
 cerns  and  banks.  Congress  ministers                                                                       are
 openly corrupting the public life by utilising
 the services of Government officials to collect
 funds for the Congress Party.

 Thirty-fourth anniversary
 of November Socialist Revolution
 Smiling wheat bags from USSR-prompt and disinterested Soviet aid to India
 Defender of Nations' Freedom
 Acardinal principle of the Soviet Union's
 foreign policy, a principle it has unalterably
 followed since  the first day  of its exis-
 tence, is to work for the independence and
 sovereignty of peoples and states and  for
 non-interference in their internal affairs, to
 work against national oppression and colonial
 enthralment in any form.
 This principle was proclaimed by       the
 Soviet Government on November 8,     1917,
 in its Decree on Peace.  And in V. I. Lenin's
 and J. V. Stalin's Address of December 3,
 1917, To All Toiling Moslems of Russia and the
 East, it was stated that the Soviet Republic
 was tearing up all unequal treaties concluded
 between the Tsarist government and the coun-
 tries of the East as well as the treaties with
 the imperialist powers providing for the parti-
 tioning of the countries of the Fast.
 NOVEMBER 1951
 The proclamation by the Soviet State of
 the new principles for its relations with the
 countries of the East, principles founded on the
 recognition of their sovereignty and indepen-
 dence, strengthened the struggle for national
 liberation conducted by the peoples of China,
 India, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan and other
 countries in Asia and made it difficult for the
 imperialist powers of the West to continue to
 pursue their old policy in the East.
 Protector of Afghanistan's independence
 In 1919, when Amanullah Khan, the new
 Emir of Afghanistan, proclaimed his country's
 complete  independence,  the Soviet Govern-
 ment unreservedly recognized the sovereign
 rights of independent Afghanistan and agreed
 at once to establish diplomatic relations with

 Approved For Release 2001/09/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415RO10200020024-9
 that country. And in connection with the
 establishment of diplomatic relations between
 the two countries, the  Soviet Government
 stated that
 `from the first days it had taken the power
 it had announced to the whole world its desire  not
 only to recognize the self-determination of all peo-
 ples, great and small, but also to give its                        support
 to all peoples fighting for their independence and
 for the right to order their internal life as they deem
 best without interference from the big and mighty
 imperialist governments."
 In 1921, the Treaty of Moscow was con-
 cluded between Afghanistan and Soviet Russia
 ,,with the aim", as it was stated in the pream?-
 ble, "of ' consolidating the friendly relations between
 Russia and Afghanistan and protecting Afghanistan's
 real independence." The Treaty of Moscow was
 a. decisive factor in ensuring  Afghanistan's
 independence.  The hostile actions of Britain
 which stubbornly  refused to reconcile itself
 to the existence of an independent Afghan
 State, were without avail.
 Loyal friend of China and Mongolia
 In the middle of 1919, the Soviet Govern-
 ment took steps to establish friendly relations
 between Soviet Russia and China.  It add-
 ressed  a statement to the  Chinese  people
 and the governments of North and South
 China in which it reaffirmed its renunciation
 of all conquests of the Tsarist government
 in China and Russia's share of the indemnity
 for the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. The Soviet
 Government also announced the abolition of.
 all  special  privileges enjoyed by Russian
 citizens in   China,  underscoring  that any
 Russian subject meddling in China's internal
 affairs or committing a crime should be justly
 tried by a local court.  "There should be no
 other power or court in China," it was said in the
 statement, " than the power and the court of the
 Chinese people."
 The Soviet Government informed the Chi-
 nese Government that it was ready to establish
 official relations between the two countries and
 to nullify once and for all acts of violence and
 injustice committed by the Tsarist government
 against China.
 At the very outset of their war of libe-
 ration, the Mongolian people found in the
 Soviet State a loyal and reliable friend.  In
 its declaration to the Mongolian people made
 in 1919, the Soviet Government stated :
 "Mongolia is a free country.  All power in the
 country should belong to the free people. No f oreigner
 has the right to interfere in Mongolia's internal affairs."
 Not only was the Soviet Land the first to
 recognize the independence of the Mongolian
 People's Republic, but it also helped the lat-
 ter successfully defend its freedom from en-
 croachment by the imperialists.
 Helped in preserving Iran's freedom
 The victory of the Great October Socialist
 Revolution in Russia was of  exceptionally
 great importance for the destiny of the Iranian
 people.  As early as December 3, 1917, the
 Soviet Government  announced that it was
 cancelling the treaty on the partition of Persia.
 that had been concluded by the Tsarist govern-
 ment with the imperialists of Britain and
 France and that it recognized the right of the
 Persians freely to determine their own fate.
 When, following the withdrawal of Russian
 troops from Iran, Britain occupied the country
 (" swallowed all of Persia," to use Lenin's
 expression) and forced on Iran the enthralling
 treaty of 1919, the Soviet Government stated
 in an announcement to the Iranian people
 that it did not recognize the oppressive Anglo-
 Iranian Treaty, considering it a scrap of paper
 without legal force.
 The declaration re-affirmed renunciation
 of all unequal treaties with Iran or  those
 concerning Iran, of intervention in the internal
 affairs of Iran and the title to Russian property
 in that country.
 On February 26, 1921, a Soviet-Iranian
 Treaty was signed, in which the Soviet Govern-
 ment solemnly announced its abandonment
 of the policy that had  been pursued  in
 Iran by the Tsarist and Provisional govern-
 ments, and the treaty also annulled all agree-
 ments and  conventions infringing  on                                                                      the
 interests of the Iranian people.
 The Soviet-Iranian Treaty of 1921 played
 an  important  part in  preserving Iran's
 independence.  The British imperialists were
 forced to withdraw their troops from Iran
 in the spring of 1921.
 Assisted Kemal Ataturk
 Soviet  Russia  played a major  role in
 safeguarding Turkey's independence.   The
 Treaty of Sevres, signed by Turkey at the
 dictation of the Entente imperialists, left the
 Turks the Central and Northern parts of Asia
 Minor only, which in fact, were turned into
 a colonial region.  The policy pursued in
 Turkey by the imperialists of the  United
 States, Britain, France and  Italy brought
 about the growth of the Turkish    peoples'
 national  liberation movement,  which was
 heartily supported by the Soviet people.

 Towards the end of April 1920, Kemal     Selfless aid to People's Democracies
 Ataturk appealed to the Soviet Government
 for help to the Turkish national liberation
 movement. The Soviet Government expressed
 its readiness to establish normal diplomatic
 relations with  Turkey  and displayed  the
 liveliest sympathy for the struggle waged by
 the Turkish people.
 On  March  16, 1921, a Soviet-Turkish
 Treaty of Friendship and Fraternity was signed.
 The Soviet Government did not recognize the
 capitulation regime and renounced all privi-
 leges and all debts due from Turkey.  The
 treaty with Soviet Russia was a major factor in
 Turkey's preserving her independence, in the
 Turkish victory over the Anglo-Greek inter-
 ventionists.
 Soviet foreign policy has always firmly
 opposed colonial regimes and  upheld the
 right of the peoples of colonies and dependent
 countries to self-determination, and to inde-
 pendent statehood.  On entering the League
 of Nations in 1934, the Soviet Government
 made the reservation that it did not recognize
 the so-called system of mandates, which was
 a screen for a regime of colonial exploitation.
 In the United Nations, the Soviet Govern-
 ment has vigorously insisted that the inter-
 national trusteeship system be so applied as
 to help the peoples of dependent  countries
 gain self-government and independence.
 Stalin's programme for post-war world
 During the Great Patriotic War, J. V.
 Stalin, speaking of a democratic programme
 for the post-war organization of the world
 stressed that there should be ensured
 "abolition of racial exclusiveness; equality of
 nations and inviolability of their territories; liberation
 of the enslaved nations and the restoration of their
 sovereign rights; the right of every nation to manage
 its affairs in its own way; economic aid to nations
 that have. suffered and assistance in establishing
 their material welfare; restoration of democratic
 liberties; destruction of the Hitler regime."
 The world-historic victory of the Soviet
 Union over Hitler Germany and imperialist
 Japan was of decisive  importance for the
 preservation of the peoples' independence.
 The defeat of Hitler Germany and the libera-
 tion of a whole number of countries in Central
 and South-Eastern Europe by Soviet troops has
 permitted the peoples of Poland, Rumania, Bul-
 garia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Albania,
 who previously had been under yoke of German
 fascists to take power into their own hands and
 for the first time in their history establish their
 real national independence.

 The Soviet Union has concluded with all
 the Peoples's Democracies in Europe economic
 and political treaties founded on the principle
 of complete equality of both parties.
 The Soviet Union was the first to recognise
 the Chinese People's Republic and vigorously
 to defend her sovereign rights. Article 5 of the
 Soviet-Chinese Treaty of Friendship, Alliance
 and Mutual Assistance, signed in Moscow on
 February 14, 1950, reads as follows:
 "The two Contracting Parties undertake in a
 spirit of friendship and co-operation, and in accordance
 with the principles of equality, mutual interest and
 mutual integrity and respect for their state sovereignty
 and  territorial  non-interference  in the internal
 affairs of the other Pary, to develop and strengthen
 economic and cultural lies between the Soviet Union
 and China, to render each other all possible economic
 assistance and to carry out necessary economic coopera-
 tion."
 The imperialists of the United States, Britain
 and other countries are trying by every means
 to rob the People's Democracies of the freedom
 and independence gained by them. To this end
 they make use of the reactionary forces inside
 those countries, to which they also send their
 spies and saboteurs.
 In contrast to the policy pursued by the
 imperialists,  Soviet foreign policy  respects
 national rights and the  national aspirations
 of the peoples.  When entering into relations
 with other countries and peoples the great
 Soviet Union invariably treats them as equals.
 Stalin on equality of nations
 A profound       scientific  substantiation  of
 this principle adhered to by the Soviet Union
 was given by J. V. Stalin at the      reception
 in honour of the Finnish Government       dele-
 gation on April 7, 1948.  Stalin said:
 ".Many people do not believe that the relations
 between a big and a small nation can be equal.
 But we, Soviet people, hold that such relations can
 and must exist.  Soviet people hold that each nation
 whether big or small has its own distinguishing
 qualitative features, its own specific nature which
 it alone possesses and other nations lack.   These
 distinguishing features constitute the contribution
 that each nation makes to the common treasury of
 world culture and that supplements and enriches
 it.  In this sense, all nations-big and small-are in
 a similar position, and each nation is equivalent to
 every other nation."
 The Soviet Union came out against the
 Marshall Plan for the reason that the American
 imperialists have made its main objective
 the destruction of the national sovereignty of
 Approved For Release 2001/09/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415R010200020024-9
 the European peoples and their enslavement.
 Against the  Marshall Plan the  Soviet
 Union put forward a programme of economic
 co-operation based on equality of rights and
 respect for the national aspirations and in-
 dependence of the peoples.
 The whole world knows what a great fight
 the Soviet Union has been conducting in the
 United Nations in defence of the national rights
 of the peoples of Iran, Greece, Indonesia,
 Syria, Lebanon, China and Korea. The Soviet
 Union's fight in defence of representation in
 the United Nations of the China's People's
 Government and the expulsion of the Kuomin-
 India's Socialist neighbour
 tang remains of American imperialism is a
 fight in defence of the U.N. Charter, and in
 defence of peace and the national interests of
 the Chinese people.
 The Soviet Union has established diploma-
 tic relations with India, Pakistan, the People's
 Republic  of Viet-Nam,  Burma,  and  the
 Indonesian  Republic, whose peoples for a
 long time were under the heel  of foreign
 oppressors. The Soviet Union is developing
 its relations with these states on the principle
 of full equality, respect for their national
 sovereignty and  non-interference in  their
 internal affairs.
 Soviet Tajikistan
 (Progress in the
 The  Supreme Soviet of the Tajik Soviet
 Socialist Republic in August  1946,  dopted
 the republic's post-war Five-Year  Plan for
 the rehabilitation and further development
 of its national economy.   Under this plan
 Tajikistan was in the first five post-war years
 (1946-1950) not only to attain  its pre-war
 economic level, but also to exceed it.
 With the aid of the peoples of the fraternal
 Republics of the Soviet Union, the working
 people of Soviet Tajikistan have successfully
 fulfilled their post-war Five-Year Plan.
 Industries
 Soviet Tajikistan has made great progress
 in its further industrialization.  It has rapidly
 developed its numerous industries that came
 into being under the Soviet        system:   coal
 and ore-mining,  cotton-ginning,  the  light
 and food industries, production of building
 materials.  There have  been       erected    and
 put into operation a foundry and      engineering
 works, a fluorite mill,  a number of ore mines
 and concentrate factories, cotton ginning mills,
 a  silk  weaving  mill,  a sewing  and  kni-
 tted goods factories, a woodworking                              plant,
 two oil mills, seven creameries and a number
 of other establishments.  Construction of en-
 terprises has been launched to handle Tajik-
 istan's own jute crops, the cultivation of which
 began but recently.
 A number of existing industrial establish-
 ments have been reconstructed.  The capacity
 of textile, cotton ginning and silk mills has
 five post-war years)
 been  considerably increased.  For example,
 at the Stalinabad Textile Mill  22,500 spindles
 'were put into operation instead of the previous-
 fly planned 18,500.
 Coal output has more than doubled com-
 pared with pre-war. The  output of the non-
 ferrous metals industry has gone up one and a
 half times, and of electric power 27. times.
 A considerable increase of output has been
 registered in the major lines of the food and
 the light industries.  Compared with pre-war
 1940, production of vegetable oil has increased
 4 times; meat one  and a half times; canned
 foods more than double; and so on all along
 the line; output of shoes nearly doubled,  that
 of silk fabrics increased 38. times. Production
 of cotton textiles has increased five times during
 this five-year period.
 Mechanised, socialist agriculture
 The past five post-war years have been
 a period of new progress also for Tajikista.n's
 Socialist agriculture whose  technical facilities
 have been growing year after year. The capa-
 city of just the tractor fleet of the machine-
 and-tractor stations which serve the republic's
 farms has in the course of the Five-Year Plan
 increased 38 per cent. Pre-sowing cultivation,
 sowing and tending of the cotton plants is
 almost fully mechanized.  On  the fields of
 the state farms and collective farms, cotton is
 harvested by machines.
 Particularly great progress has been regis-
 tered in the republics's major line of farming-

 cotton-growing. The area under cotton has
 in the course of the post-war Five-Year Plan
 increased here by 31 per cent and far exceeded
 the pre-war figure.  During this period, the
 gross cotton harvest has increased 3.3 times,
 including a fivefold increase in the production
 of fine-staple  varieties.  Now, high-yielding
 cotton varieties developed by Soviet breeders
 are widely used on the plantations of the Tajik
 collective farms and state farms.
 The area under other industrial crops
 (besides cotton) has increased by 46 per cent
 and that under fodder crops by 43 per cent.
 New fruit orchards and vine-yards have been
 planted over large areas.  New crops:  jute,
 citrus fruits, essential oil-bearing plants and
 other formerly unknown cultures in Tajikistan
 are now being successfully cultivated here.
 Compared with pre-war  1940, per hectare
 grain yields in 1950 went up 38 per cent and
 the gross harvest, 34 per cent.
 Thousands of hectares of formerly barren,
 waterless land in  the Vakhsh and  Gissar
 valleys and other districts of the Tajikistan
 have been brought under cultivation.  New
 irrigation systems have been built and existing
 ones reconstructed.  Work is nearing comple-
 tion on the construction of the Unjin pumping
 station to mechanize irrigation;  the Yangi-
 Chairikaron Canal;                               the irrigation network
 in the Verkhni Koktash lands, etc. Compared
 with pre-war, the number of rural electric
 stations has more than doubled and their
 capacity increased more than threefold.
 Tajikistan has made notable progress also
 in animal husbandry.  It has overfulfilled its
 Five-Year Plan for increasing the head of com-
 monly owned livestock. Compared with pre-war
 its number of cattle increased 2.7 times, sheep
 and goats 3.3 times, and poultry nearly 4 times.
 Education; culture; health
 Public education is successfully developing
 in Tajikistan.  In 1950, its elementary, junior-
 secondary and complete secondary schools were
 attended by 309,000 children, or 69, 000 more
 than was envisaged by the post-war Five-Year
 Plan.  Instruction in the schools is given in
 the native language of the population. Three
 times as many lads and girls attended rural
 evening schools as in 1945. 7,500 young peo-
 ple (or three times as many as in 1940) attend-
 ed colleges,                      and 10,800 attended secondary
 specialized schools.  The  republic's  higher
 and secondary educational institutions gradua-
 ted more than 10,000 specialists :                      teachers,
 agronomists, doctors, etc. In the course of
 the  post-war  Five-year  Plan 548  schools
 have been built and equipped here at state
 expense; the republic opened its own Slate
 University and eight new secondary specialized
 schools. The number of scientific research insti-
 tutions and their staffs of scientific workers has
 increased.
 Compared with pre-war, the number of
 clubs in towns and rural communities increased
 4.5 times, the number of motion picture pro-
 jection installations 2.3 times, and the num-
 ber of public libraries 2.4 times.
 New medical service establishments have
 been opened in the towns, industrial settlements
 and rural communities.  The republic now has
 twice as many doctors as it had before the war.
 Remarkable rise in living standards
 The standard of living of the Tajik popula-
 tion steadily advanced in  the course of the
 postwar Five-Year Plan, real wages of factory
 and office workers continued to rise and so did
 the incomes of the collective farmers.
 In the course of 1947-1950, the Government
 of the Soviet Union three times in succession
 reduced  prices  of general  consumer goods
 and prepared the conditions for the fourth
 price reduction effected on March  1, 1951.
 The price reductions have sharply increased
 real wages of workers, office employees and
 the intelligentsia and yielded a great saving
 to  the  peasants  in purchasing  cut-priced
 manufactured goods.
 The population of Tajikistan received at
 the expense of the  state  allowances from
 social insurance fund for factory and office
 workers ; pensions from the Social Mainte-
 nance Fund; accommodations in sanatoriums,
 rest homes and child institutions free of charge
 or at reduced rates; allowances and grants for
 mothers of large families and lone mothers; free
 medical aid; free education and  professional
 and vocational instruction; students' stipends
 and a number of other payments and benefits.
 Trade has expanded at a rapid pace. The
 retail trade turnover in the state and co-opera-
 tive network has considerably surpassed the
 pre-war 1940 level.  A considerable increase
 has been registered in the sale of food and
 manufactured  consumer  goods.
 Local Soviets, state enterprises and ins-
 titutions and also the population of towns
 and industrial settlements assisted by govern-
 ment loans on easy terms have built dwelling
 houses with a total living floor space of 504,000
 square metres.  In the  rural  communities
 41,000 houses have been built.

 Soviets remake Geography
 and Climate
 V. Kovda
 In August last year the Soviet Government
 passed a decision providing for the cons-
 truction of gigantic hydro-technical works on
 the Volga.
 Russian science has always been distin-
 guished by its progressive outlook and optimis-
 tic faith in the ability of human reason, science
 and technology to master the elemental forces
 of nature.  The discoveries and deductions
 of Mendeleyev, Dokuchayev, Timiryazev, Mi-
 churin and Voyeikov were a reply to those
 scientists who asserted that in his struggle
 against nature man is an impotent pigmy.
 From its very inception, the Soviet State addres-
 sed itself to the task of refashioning nature, of
 removing the causes giving rise to drought and
 crop failure, and thus making the earth yield
 its bounties to the full.
 Miracles of Socialist agriculture
 That vast social reform effected in the
 Soviet  Union--the  conversion  of tens  of
 millions of small peasant husbandries into
 large collective farms, amply supplied with
 first-class machinery, fertilizers and scientific
 guidance-has, coupled with a planned nation-
 al economy, created huge  potentialities                      for
 increasing the productivity of labour in agri-
 culture.
 A constant and steady rise of fertility and
 increasing output of food and raw materials
 is an inherent feature of the Socialist agricul-
 ture of the Soviet Union.  Russia in the Tsarist
 clays used to produce 64-80 million tons of
 cereals annually; the figure today in the Soviet
 Union  is  112-128  million  tons.  In  Soviet
 times the area of irrigated crop-land has increased
 by 50 per cent, the cotton crop five-fold, and the
 crop of oil-bearing plants three-fold.
 This unparalleled increase of soil fertility
 and of agricultural output disposes of the
 assertion of the neo-Malthusians that a process
 of gradual and universal exhaustion of the
 soil is inevitable, and that therefore measures
 must be taken to restrict the growth of the
 world's population. The trouble, quite obvious-
 ly, is not a general decline in the fertility of the
 soil, but the fact that it is being exploited waste-
 fully and improvidently.
 Contours of a great plan
 The Soviet people are now engaged on a
 grand programme of engineering measures,
 designed completely to eliminate the causes of
 the droughts that afflict the South-Eastern
 areas of the European part of the USSR and to
 irrigate vast expanses of desert and wasteland.
 In 1948, the Soviet people began work on a
 plan initiated by J. V. Stalin, providing for
 the planting of trans-continental shelter belts
 following the watersheds and the valleys of the
 bigger rivers, and also for the afforestation of
 the dunelands and black-earth steppelands in
 the South-Eastern part of the country.  These
 forest belts will protect the fertile lands border-
 ing the Volga against the dry, destructive winds
 that blow from the deserts of Central Asia.
 A good fifth of the 15-year programme for
 the planting of forest belts has already been
 completed.
 In 1950, work was begun on the construction
 of five gigantic hydropower stations and new
 irrigation systems on the Volga, the Dnieper,
 the Don and the Amu-Darya.  From five to
 seven years are planned for the completion of
 these works, which will increase the annual
 power output of the Soviet Union by approxi-
 mately 23,000 million kilowatt-hours and the
 area of irrigated arable land by 6,000,000
 hectares.
 Simultaneously, sand-fixing operations will
 be carried out in the Kara Kum desert (Turk-
 menistan) and over a vast area of the Caspian
 lowland, and water will be brought to 22

 million hectares of land in the cattle-breeding -
 regions. The completion of this grand pro-
 gramme will make it possible to increase the
 output of cereals, cotton, vegetable oil and
 animal products three or four times over.
 This gigantic plan for the remaking of
 geography and climate is called by the Soviet
 people after its author and initiator J. V.
 Stalin.  The motive force of the Stalin Plan
 is the desire to harness the forces of nature and
 create an abundance of agricultural produce
 for the promotion of man's welfare.
 Scientists lend their aid
 The Stalin Plan is an embodiment of the
 finest progressive traditions of Soviet science.
 It is based on the accumulated experience and
 achievements  of hydro-engineering in the
 Socialist State.
 A regular army of scientists, engineers,
 agronomists and researchers in the most diverse
 fields are co-operating with the Soviet people
 in these grand construction projects of Com-
 inunism.  Hundreds of scientific expeditions
 have launched an assault on the Kara Kum
 and Caspian deserts and the barren steppe-
 lands of the Volga and South Ukraine.  Much
 has already been accomplished.  Charts of
 natural conditions have been drawn up and
 methods revised for bringing the land under
 ?   cultivation.  A pretty good idea has been
 obtained  of its  chemical composition and
 latent water resources, the behaviour of the
 ground waters and the atmospheric dynamics
 in the areas.  New and powerful excavating
 machines have been designed, and extra-tough
 materials and new alloys invented for them.
 Super-powerful turbines and the most delicate
 automatic-control instruments are in the course
 of construction or designing.
 Soviet scientists consider it their prime
 duty to contribute to the work of remaking
 nature.  Committees to advise and assist the
 Stalin projects have been set up by the Academy
 of Sciences, the Moscow University and other
 scientific and academic bodies.  Their pur-
 pose is to make the latest discoveries and
 inventions available to the builders with the
 least possible delay.
 World's longest canal
 In June of last year I went to the Trans-
 caucasus to supervise the research work in con-
 nection with drainage and irrigation projects
 in the lowland areas of the Kura and Araxes
 rivers.  On the Kura,  near  the village of
 Mingechaur, Azerbaijan, a big hydro-electric
 station is being built, which, with its dam,
 will make it possible to irrigate some 500,000
 hectares in the Kura-Araxes basins.
 In August, after my return to Moscow,
 I was informed by telephone that a scientific
 committee had been set up to study projects
 for irrigating new areas in Turkmenistan.
 The committee included scientists and engi-
 neers.
 Two of my fellow-researchers in the Aca-
 demy of Sciences and I were requested to
 prepare data on natural conditions in the
 Turkmen Republic and to suggest suitable
 sites for the future irrigation systems.
 The Main Turkmen Canal is to be comp-
 leted by 1957.  It will be the largest in the
 world, 1,100 kilometres long, and will be able
 to provide 600 cubic metres of water per second,
 enough to irrigate 1,300,000 hectares and to
 supply needed water for another 7,000,000
 hectares.
 I recently spent two months as scientific
 chief of the Academy's big Aral-Caspian ex-
 pedition which is plotting the route of the
 Main Turkmen canal, and was able to observe
 how swiftly the work is proceeding.  Hundreds
 of scientists, engineers and technicians atta-
 ched to twenty expeditions  appointed by
 various ministries and scientific institutions
 are busily at work along the route of the future
 canal.
 The first results of our investigations show
 that, if necessary, the Main Turkmen Canal
 will be able to irrigate an area twice as large
 as was originally planned.  At the village of
 Takhia-Tash, where the dam on the Amu
 Darya is to be built, housing settlements for
 the workers, as well as a temporary wharf,
 have already been built, the laying of the
 approach roads and spur lines is nearing comp-
 letion, and a wood-working and a concrete-
 making plant will soon be ready for operation.
 Work on the irrigation systems in the lower
 reaches of the Amu Darya will be started in
 1952.
 World's biggest hydro-power project
 Work was also begun this year  on the
 Volga hydro-technical projects, near the cities
 of Kuibyshev and Stalingrad.  For its scale,
 excellence of engineering conception and rapid
 pace of construction, the Kuibyshev Hydro-
 Electric Station* will be the biggest hydro-

 power plant.
 This project will at once solve a whole
 range of major national economic problems.
 With a capacity of close to 2,000,000 kilowatts,
 the hydro-electric station will have an annual
 output of approximately 10,000 million kilo-
 watt-hours in years of average waterflow.
 It will transform industry and agriculture
 over a vast area adjoining the Volga, and will
 for ever rid the Trans-Volga collective farm
 peasantry of the devastating droughts and
 and winds.
 The rise of the river's level due to the
 Kuibyshev and Stalingrad dams and also
 huge storage reservoirs and locks will radi-
 cally change shipping conditions on the Volga.
 Shallowing of the river will stop.  The river
 will become full-flowing and on it big passen-
 ger boats and freighters will freely navigate with
 out fear of shoals and banks.  The Kuibyshev
 Hydro-Electric Station will produce more than
 5 times as much electricity as all the electric
 stations of Russia before the Revolution  or
 half as much as is generated by all the electric
 stations of Italy.   Its capacity will exceed
 several times that of Europe's hitherto biggest
 Lenin Hydro-Electric Station on the Dnieper.
 The Kuibyshev Hydro-Power Project in-
 cludes: the hydro-electric station,  a con-
 crete overflow weir, an earth dam, and navi-
 gation locks.  Their construction requires the
 removal and laying of 150,000,000 cubic
 metres ' of earth, pouring of 6,000,000 cubic
 metres of concrete, installation of 200,000
 tons of metal structure, and a vast amount
 of building work.  Each hour, more than a
 thousand cubic metres of reinforced concrete
 has to be laid on this project.
 Use of most modern technique
 This scale of building work requires the
 use of most modern technique.  And Soviet
 industry is supplying  the builders of the
 Kuibyshev project with the most varied and
 efficient high-capacity machines. There are
 at work here powerful suction dredges that
 shift thousand of cubic metres of earth an
 hour; powerful electric excavators with a cap-
 acity of 200 to 300 cubic metres an hour,
 and a vast array of other machines.   The
 construction works will have its own huge
 concrete plants with a daily capacity of 4,000
 cubic metres of concrete.
 In designing this mammoth project the
 engineers had to solve many difficult prob-
 lems.  For example, in selecting the building
 site, our specialists  succeeded in  avoiding
 the possible flooding of fertile land of some
 districts.  Notwithstanding established tradi-
 tions, our Soviet engineers  have  decided
 to reject rocky foundations. Relying on the
 rich experience of Soviet hydro-engineering,
 our specialists have found it possible to erect
 the dam on a soft foundation.  This will
 save a lot of money and time.
 Saving of 20 million tons of fuel annually
 For fuel stations to produce the amount
 of electric power that will be generated by
 the Kuibyshev Hydro-Electric Station, it would
 require the annual transportation and con-
 sumption of no less than 10,000,000 tons of
 fuel.  By the use of the electricity that will
 be generated by the Kuibyshev Hydro-Electric
 Station, industry, the transport services and
 agriculture will save approximately 10,000,000
 tons of fuel.  Thus,  the total saving of fuel
 accruing from the Kuibyshev Hydro-Electric
 Station will run into a good 20,000, 000 tons
 a year.
 Of the  10,000        million  kilowatt-hours
 which the Kuibyshev Hydro-Electric Station
 will generate, 1,500 million is intended f'or
 the irrigation of the Trans-Volga steppes,
 where an irrigation system is being built on
 an area of 1,000,000 hectares.
 Besides irrigation, it is planned extensively
 to electrify farm work in the Trans-Volga
 area.  This will considerably increase pro-
 ductivity of labour, reduce consumption of
 liquid and solid fuel, and make easier the
 work of the collective farmers.
 Six thousand million kilowatt-hours annua-
 lly will be transmitted to Moscow. To send such
 huge quantities of electric power over a distance
 of more than 800 kilometres, powerful high
 voltage  transmission lines will be erected
 over which 400,000 volt electric current will
 flow.  The transmission of such high tension
 current over such long distances is being
 undertaken here for the first time in world
 history.
 The  Moscow  power  system connected
 with the Volga systems will become the big-
 gest in the world.
 I should observe that the problem of irriga-
 ting the Volga region has interested  many
 Soviet scientists. In the thirties, Academi-
 cians L.  Prasolov, B.  Polynov, B.  Keller
 and myself, all novices at that time, made
 a study of the natural conditions in the mid-
 dle and lower Volga areas from the point
 of view of the possibility of large-scale irriga-
 tion work.  Following this, a number of irri-
 50                                                                  INDIA TO-DAY

 gation systems were built on the smaller rivers
 in the region.  The experience in irrigation
 farming gained since has been put to use in
 projecting much bigger irrigation develop-
 ments on the Volga. I summed up the results
 of these investigations in a recent book called
 The Soil of the Caspian Lowland, where the
 prospects of irrigating this area were dis-
 cussed.  We,  scientists, believed  that this
 would be a matter of the distant future, but
 the construction of the Kuibyshev and Sta-
 lingrad power plants on the suggestion of
 J. V. Stalin, has placed the irrigation of the
 middle and lower Volga regions on the order
 of the day.  Some 14 million hectares of
 arid land in this region will receive water
 within the next few years.
 Last year a group of engineers  of the
 USSR Ministry of Agriculture, headed by
 hydro-technical engineer Lyuber, drew up
 a project for  the irrigation of the vast dep-
 ression lying to the North of the Caspian
 Sea.   This gignatic drought-ridden area is
 capable of producing enormous quantities
 of grain, fruits and  vegetables, all  that it
 needs  being water.   Now  it will get  the
 {   water  Sim It      1     h
 u aneous y,   t e  details were
 worked out of the Stalingrad hydro-power
 plant and the Stalingrad canal, which will
 cut through the Caspian lowlands from the
 Volga to the Ural river.
 Both projects were scrutinized very thoro-
 ughly by an expert committee composed of
 prominent scientists and engineers from the
 Academy of Sciences, the Moscow University,
 Higher  Engineering School  and  Moscow
 Power Institute.  The experts  made some
 critcisms and suggestions, which were accepted
 by the authors, but in general the committee
 approved both projects, and the work will
 start in the very near future.  The excavation
 of the cofferdam for foundations of the Stalin-
 grad Hydro-Electric  Station is being started
 right away.
 However, the problem of irrigating the
 Caspian wastelands cannot be regarded as
 solved. The Academy of Sciences has there-
 fore appointed a large and all-round scientific
 expedition,   headed  by  the  well-known
 scientist Vladimir Sukachev, to render per-
 manent assistance to the planners and buil-
 ders.   The                           detachments and  provisional
 stations of this expedition are investigating
 the areas of the national shelter belts planted
 in 1949 and 1950, as well as the sites of the
 future irrigation systems in the Caspian area.
 Volga-Don Canal
 I write these lines with the impressions
 still fresh in my memory of a visit I paid
 to the site of another big construction  pro-
 ject-the  Volga- Don Canal.  The                                                                                 canal,
 as well as the Tsimlyanskaya hydro-power
 plant connected with it will be in the main
 finished this year, and with.the disappearance
 of the ice next spring it will be opened for
 navigation. By next  year,  too,  the   first
 100,000 hectares of desert land will be irrigat-
 ed, and the figure will increase in the corning
 four years to 750,000 hectares.   When this
 canal is opened  for navigation, five seas-
 the White, the Baltic, the Caspian, the Azov
 and the Black-will be connected with navi-
 gation water routes.
 The construction of these new irrigation
 systems in so short a period will naturally be
 no easy matter.  The  irrigation canals in
 the Don steppe are already in course of cons-
 truction; but, for the water to be able to flow
 to  its  destination, large  areas will have
 to be levelled,  hundreds of smaller canals
 and distributing installations built, and, in
 addition, the collective farmers will have to be
 taught the  technique of irrigation.  This
 task has been    entrusted to the scientists
 of the  Novocherkassk  Land    Reclamation
 Institute, a famous Soviet higher educational
 institution.  They direct the agronomists and
 engineers who are supervising the building
 of the irrigation networks in the Don steppe,
 and train collective farmers to be professional
 irrigation supervisers.
 Large-scale construction work is also in
 progress in the South Ukraine and the Crimea.
 Here, too, large prospecting and research ex-
 peditions are at work, composed mainly of
 scientists from the Ukrainian Academy of
 Sciences and the Crimean branch of the USSR
 Academy of Sciences.

 Dreams come true under Socialism
 In 1920, a committee of scientists and
 engineers working under the guidance of
 Lenin and Stalin, drew up the first  state
 plan for the  electrification  of Russia. It
 envisaged  increasing  the  country's power
 output from 2,000 million to 8,800 million
 kilowatt-hours in the next 15 years.  When
 H. G. Wells was told of the project he referr-
 ed to Lenin as the "dreamer in the Kremlin",
 and predicted that nothing would come of
 the plan.  He was mistaken.  By 1940 the
 Soviet  Union  was producing at        the rate
 of 40,000 million kilowatt-hours of electricity
 a year,  more  than any   other   European
 country.. Today, after the first post-war Five-
 Year Plan; the Soviet Union is generating at
 the annual rate of more than 80,000 million
 kilowatt-hours, and is the second largest power
 producer in the world.
 These figures should be sufficient answer to
 those who doubt the feasibility of the new
 plans, the  plans for the remaking  of geo-
 graphy and climate.  They rest upon a granite
 foundation-Socialism.
 These great hydro-engineering works are
 being built by the free people of the Soviet Union, by
 the whole Soviet State, backed by the might of its
 heavy industry. The machine-building indus-
 try of the Soviet Union is capable of producing
 all the equipment necessary for the comp-
 lete mechanization of the labourious processes
 of excavation, concretelaying and construc-
 tion.                  I have seen at the construction sites
 powerful excavators,  among  them giants
 with shovels of 14-cubic metre capacity,
 25-ton tip-trucks, huge scrapers and bull-
 dozers, first-class transporters and graders.
 The plants of the Urals, the Donbas, Moscow
 and Leningrad build-super powerful machi-
 nes of the most diverse type, each of which
 can do the work of thousands of labourers.
 The demand for crude manual labour in these
 great construction projects is relatively in-
 significant.
 If Goethe were alive to-day
 As I  write this I cannot help recalling
 Goethe's wise old Faust, who, in his declin-
 ing years, after he has lost his son Euphorion,
 comes to the  conviction that the human
 intellegence can have no loftier  aim than
 to harness the forces of nature for the benefit
 of man.  He conceives a plan for reclaiming
 the seashore and, already blind with age,
 proceeds to carry it out.   But Mephistopheles
 -the symbol of stern reality-deceives  him.
 The Lemurs dig not a drainage canal, but a
 grave for Faust, in which they bury his remains.
 The great poets's moral is that the world
 of his time was powerless to master the natural
 elements.
 I should have liked Goethe to have lived
 to our day; he might then have written a
 different Faust.
 The great construction projects of Com-
 munism will be completed by the Soviet State
 in the amazingly short period of five to seven
 years.  They will work radical changes in the
 physical and economic geography of the Soviet
 Union. New " seas "and "rivers" and countless
 ponds and reservoirs will appear, and the soil
 will acquire a new vegetative surface.  The
 climate at ground level will change.    New
 cities, new railways and new ports will come
 into being.  Half the generated power will
 be used for the broad electrification of agri-
 culture and of river  and  road                                                                          transport.
 New and colossal wealth will be produced
 by the peaceful constructive labour of the
 Soviet people, enormous quantities of food-
 stuffs and industrial raw materials, plants
 and animals, will be made available for the
 country's food industry and light industries.
 Big new advances will be made in the gradual
 transition of Soviet society from Socialism
 to  Communism.   And  all for the greater
 welfare of man !
 Parties and Politics in PEPSU

 the services of Government officials to collect

 The broad masses of PEPSU, led by the
 militant Kisan movement, which in its turn
 is guided by votaries of Marx, Lenin and
 Stalin, are marching ahead with amazing self-
 c:onfidenec. The united might of the people did
 beat back the repression at Kishengarli and
 Bakhora.  The same thing can and  should
 happen in every corner of the PEPSU.  We
 are fortunate in one respect.  The Right-wing
 Socialist leaders count for next to nothing in
 the socio-political life of the PEPSU. Only
 a powerful democratic movement of all the
 exploited sections of society  can provide
 sanctions for  creating conditions in which
 the people will be able to return their genuine
 candidates in the coming elections.

 Allies or Satellites?
 IN an editorial  com-
 bining the minimum
 of logic with the maxi-
 mum of insinuation, The
 The distinguished authority on Soviet and
 European affairs--author of the recent Pelican
 "A History of the U. S. S. R."-analyses the
 economic relations between the People's Demo-
 Times wrote on June 13                           cracies and the U. S. S. R.
 _                          - " - -
 that the economic pro-
 of Hungary is "geared to the demands
 gramme
 of the Soviet Union" and that "heavy industry
 is being expanded with little regard to the
 needs of the mass of consumers and at the
 expense of labour standards."
 You would have searched the editorial
 columns of  The Times in vain, before 1939,
 when Hungary was ruled by the terrorist
 dictatorship of the big landowners and finan-
 ciers, for any similar worries about "the needs
 of the mass of consumers"-the impoverished
 illiterate majority of Hungary's peasants-or
 about the "labour standards"  (presumably
 this means the working and living conditions)
 of Hungary's factory workers. At that time
 British big business-so eminently represented
 on The Times' board of directors-was backing
 the Horthy dictatorship for all it was worth.
 The admitted past
 Yet at that time Hungarian economy was
 notoriously "geared  to  the  demands"-of
 Hitler.  Already in 1938 an important League
 of Nations Report on Exchange Control (C.232,
 M.131) was contrasting the "impoverished"
 agricultural countries of South-East and Eastern
 Europe with the industrial countries, "with
 their more varied economies and their more
 substantial resources" (p. 6), and showing how
 the first group inevitably fell into dependence
 on the second, particularly on Germany (pp.
 38-9,53)-which tended "in the long run to
 obstruct their economic development" (p. 42).
 This picture was drawn in still greater
 detail in 1940, in the Royal Institute of Inter-
 national Affairs book South-Eastern Europe.  It
 stated:  "The cardinal facts about the countries
 under survey are... that they are agricultural,
 over-populated and poor" (p. 85), and that
 their industrial development "cannot be said
 to be great" (p. 100)-with the result that
 they were economically dependent on Western
 countries,  particularly  Germany  (p.  103).
 If they remained peasant countries after the
 war, there would still be great "opportunities
 for  exploiting them-"
 (p.  122):  and indus-
 I trialisation  was  their
 "chief hope of better-
 ment" (p. 135). To pre-
 vent these "economical-
 ly weaker States of Europe" falling once again
 "into a state of economic servitude to Germany"
 -said the Royal Institute's Problem of Germany,
 in 1943--"their greater industrialisation " was
 essential (pp. 44-5).  And in Occupied Europe--
 a study published in 1944-the Royal Institute
 of International Affairs even suggested that
 Germany ought to be "called upon to provide
 at least some machinery," by way of repara-
 tions, for this purpose-since "even before
 the war it was generally recognised that in the
 less industrialised countries of even Eastern and
 South-Eastern Europe, owing to the excessive
 density of' agricultural population, there was
 an acute economic problem" (p. 70-1).
 Only way out: industrialisation
 If any lessons stand out from this testimony,
 it is that
 (i) "the needs of the mass of consumers"
 in such countries depend for their satisfaction
 in the long run upon industrialisation;
 (ii) so does their prospect of economic
 independence;
 (iii) no  known  way of industrialisation
 exists except through the expansion of heavy
 industry-since no other way can provide a
 country with the ability at any moment to manu-
 facture the industrial equipment it requires,
 without having to ask for help from outside,
 on terms which can be dictated by the supplier.
 The main question
 Leaving aside the question  of "labour
 standards"-British trade unionists who have
 been to the People's Democracies have every
 opportunity of comparing those with what
 existed in pre-war days-The Times in its edi-
 torial therefore very skilfully evaded the main
 question :
 - Is the Soviet Union helping the People's Democra-
 cies towards the economic development so long recog-
 nised as desirable or is it obstructing them ?
 Does The Times' ambiguous phrase "geared
 to the demands of the Soviet Union" mean

 tied once more as Malaya and the Gold Coast
 and Ireland are tied to industrial Britain--as
 dependent suppliers of raw materials and
 foodstuffs to a dominant industrial Power-or
 "geared" as independent, industrially develop-
 ed countries are linked with each other: for
 mutual benefit ?
 That is the issue-and that issue no propa-
 gandist of hatred and war on the People's
 Democracies has yet dared to face.
 What are the facts?
 For what are the facts ?  So far as Hungary
 is concerned, Matyas Rakosi, General Secre-
 tary of the Working People's Party, gave them
 in the report* to his Party Congress on Feb-
 ruary 25, 1941:
 "The Soviet Union helps us in the build-
 ing of our most modern factories, gives us its
 best machines, most up-to-date manufacturing
 processes and, what is no less important, puts
 its best scientists and ace workers at our disposal.
 The best engineers and  technicians of the
 Soviet Union, led by Academician Bardin, the
 world-famous foundry expert, have visited us,
 people whose advice and guidance means a
 service to us which cannot be over-estimated.
 "Comrade Bikov was here and passed on
 his experience in the field of fast cutting. Com-
 radeZuravlyov taught our foundrymen the
 method of quick smelting.  Comrade Petrov,
 the chief foundryman of the Stalin Automobile
 Factory, passed on his experience in the fields
 of casting  and  foundry   work.  Comrade
 Dubyaga helped us to transfer to the multi-
 machine system in the textile industry.                       Com-
 rade Annanyeva taught our spinning workers
 how to decrease scrap to the minimum in the
 spinning mills.  Comrade Shavlyugin taught
 our bricklayers the fast bricklaying method.
 Comrades Maximenko, Koba and Zuycv deve-
 loped a whole team of Stakhanovites among
 our building workers.  Comrade Panin taught
 the Hungarian engine drivers to increase the
 average  speed  of our railways.  Filirnonov,
 Padgarov and Logvinyenko gave help to our
 miners in acquiring methods of handling mining
 machinery, and so on......
 "The transplantation of the highly deve-
 loped Soviet Socialist methods of production
 to Hungary is being speeded by visits of our

 Union, and by students studying at the univer-

 sities of that country, through whom the know-
 ledge of the most recent achievements of socialist
 construction is coming in a continuous stream
 to our country.
 "There is no field of our economy and,
 I may add, of our entire socialist life, which
 has not yet received, and which is not con-
 tinually receiving, support from the Soviet
 Union which cannot be over-estimated.  We
 are now gradually passing on to making that
 immeasurable treasure house of experience
 which is in Soviet technical literature, accessible
 and applicable to our socialist construction.
 During the last year, and especially in recent
 months, a real siege of Soviet technical litera-
 lture started.
 "Our engineers and technicians are only
 now beginning to realise those tremendous
 advantages  which the knowledge of Soviet
 technical literature means to them, and an
 indication of their thirst for knowledge can
 be seen in the fact that there was a sudden
 huge shortage of suitable technical translators.
 It might be said that our technical intelli-
 gentsia, and beyond them the entire Hunga-
 rian intelligentsia, is only now beginning to
 discover the Soviet Union in  this respect.
 They are only now beginning to grasp the
 true importance of the limitless scientific and
 experimental equipment of the Soviet Union,
 its leading position and its fruitful effect"
 This is what The Times editorial called.
 "the subservience of the Hungarian economy
 to the calls of the Soviet Union" !  Naturally,
 its readers are not called upon to remember
 the very, different language of days gone by,
 when Hungary's agrarian and backward econo-
 my was really subservient to a foreign Power-
 and when The Times wrote complacently (after
 Munich) of Germany's "peculiar interest as an
 industrial power in the agricultural and other
 markets  of Central and  Eastern  Europe"
 (October 17, 1938).
 What Soviet aid means for Poland
 Or take another example of "gearing"--
 the Six-Year Trade Agreement between Poland
 and the U.S.S.R.,  signed on June 29, 1950.
 Of this arrangement Deputy Prime  Minister
 Mine said on July 2 the same year (Polish Facts
 and Figures*, July 8, 1950) :
 "What does  it mean to Poland ?  It is
 common knowledge that,  according to the
 Six-Year Plan, the output of Polish industry

 should increase by over 150 per cent.  The
 increase in industrial output demands steadily
 increasing supplies  of raw  materials and
 industrial goods, which we lack in our country.
 The new Agreement will ensure deliveries of
 the raw materials and goods that we need in
 quantities which will take into account the
 great increase in output during the Six-Year
 Plan.  At the same time these  agreements
 regulate the export of our own goods to the
 U. S. S. R.  In this way, a strong and solid
 basis is laid for our Six-Year Plan.
 "The agreements will increase our inde-
 pendence in relation to capitalist countries
 and will render ineffectual their attempts to
 discriminate against our foreign trade.  They
 mean that the implementation of our Six-
 Year Plan will be based upon the granite-like
 foundations  of planned  economic   relations
 between the Soviet Union and Poland.
 Capital equipment from U.S.S.R.
 "In addition to general trade agreements
 an agreement has been signed on the delivery
 of capital equipment from the U.S.S.R. to
 Poland in the years 1951-58.  This equipment
 will be supplied to about thirty new and impor-
 tant industrial establishments in Poland.  As
 is generally known, the Soviet Union is already
 supplying capital equipment to Poland under
 the 1948 agreement.  Among other things, the
 leading project of the Six-Year Plan, a new
 big steel works near Cracow, is being built
 with Soviet equipment, with Soviet blueprints
 and  with  Soviet technical  assistance.  Now
 capital goods deliveries will be greatly expanded, and
 will constitute about 40 per cent. of all Soviet exports
 to Poland.
 "This means that, thanks to the brotherly
 help of  the  U.S.S.R., the  speedy indus-
 trialisation of Poland is assured.                             It means
 that the Soviet State has grown into a power
 of such magnitude that it can put a most
 modern and complex technique at the ser-
 vice, not only of its own gigantic and steadily
 growing economy, but also at the service of the
 young, new and resilient countries of People's
 Democracy.  It means that we are building
 our Six-Year Plan on unshakable foundations
 of Soviet technical and economic assistance.
 It means that the victory of socialist construc-
 tion in Poland is certain..."
 Why should The Times object to this mani-
 fest fulfilment of what Chatham House* was
 advising as recently as 1944 ?  Can it be
 * The Royal Institute of International Affairs
 because, at that time, the hope was that "the
 British Commonwealth and the United States
 will probably have to play a major part by
 providing  capital goods on a basis of long-
 term credits"  (Occupied Europe, p  71) ?  In
 other words, having supported for six years the
 vain efforts of the British and U.S. Govern-
 ments to bully,  blackmail and blockade the
 People's   Democracies  into  surrender to
 capitalism, can The Times be possibly calling
 "sour grapes"?
 The new pattern of foreign trade
 The new pattern of Czechoslovakia's foreign
 trade, again, was analysed in revealing fashion
 by Minister of Planning Dolansky at the Central
 Committee of the Communist Party of Czecho-
 slovakia  on February  22,  1951  (Information
 Bulletin, No. 6, March, 1951).  Ile pointed
 out that Czechoslovakian lorries and machine
 tools were being exported to the Soviet Union,
 while the latter was sending caterpillar tractors
 and combine harvesters-the kind of relation-
 ship that exists between expanding industrial
 economies.  And on the long-term trade and
 economic agreements which Czechoslovakia
 was concluding he had this to say (illustrating
 with many details) :
 "The significance of these agreements lies
 in the fact that in this way the mutual exchange
 of goods is increased and guarantees the growth
 of national economy and the speeding up of
 industrialisation; in that the socialist trans-
 formation of industry and agriculture in the
 People's Democracies is secure as well as the
 raising of the technical level of the  whole
 economy; in that firm foundations for stable
 economic relations between our countries are
 thus created, protecting us from the effects of-
 fluctuation developments on capitalist markets
 and offsetting to a considerable degree the
 effects of the  discriminatory policy carried
 on by the American imperialists and their
 satellites; it lies in the fact that our countries'
 economic independence of the capitalist states
 is strengthened and thus the countries in the
 camp of peace and socialism are better capable
 of self-defence. Finally the significance of these
 agreements lies in the fact that they represent
 a form of planned dovetailing of the national

 that of the U. S. S. R. and of each other, in that
 they represent a form of co-ordination of long-
 term plans for the development of our national
 economy and thus strengthen the principle
 of planned national economy in the People's
 Democracies.

 Czech-Soviet trade agreement.
 "A classical example of such an agree-
 rnent is the long-term  Soviet-Czechoslovak
 trade agreement signed in November, 1950.
 According to this agreement, the Soviet Union
 will deliver such important raw materials for
 our basic industries as iron ore and non-ferrous
 ores, such textile raw materials as cotton, such
 foodstuffs as grain, meat and fat, important
 machinery such as mechanisation equipment
 for the mines, for the expansion of our foundries,
 and for heavy industry, and highly produc-
 tive  machinery for  the  mechanisation  of
 agriculture and the building industry.
 In addition, under this agreement, the
 Soviet Union will give us wide technical help in
 building  a number of important factories
 which we could otherwise not build so rapidly,
 and apart from this the Soviet Union will help
 us to introduce the production of new goods
 and to improve our existing production.
 " According to this agreement, Czechoslo-
 vakia will deliver to the Soviet Union mainly
 machinery and equipment for the most part not
 produced here before, and made according to the
 most up-to-date Soviet designs.  This means that
 the Soviet orders will ensure a long-term pro-
 duction programme for our heavy industry
 and especially our engineering industry, and
 will lead to the raising of the technical level
 of our industry; we shall learn to produce
 important new kinds of machinery and equip..
 ment and in the case of certain products we
 shall go over from individual to semi-serial or
 serial production."
 So it turns out  that the Soviet Union
 supplies raw materials and capital goods to
 its alleged "satellites"-and they do the same
 for  their  partner. Was  there  ever  such
 "subservience"
 Testimony from Bulgaria
 No less striking is the evidence from Bulgaria,
 Rumania and Albania.  Here is a Bulgarian
 testimony :
 "Were it not for the import of Soviet cotton,
 Bulgaria would have failed to revive its major
 industry-textiles-which was brought to a
 standstill during the period of fascism.
 "Without Soviet ferrous and non-ferrous
 metals and the import of building materials,
 machines and fittings, our country would have
 failed to develop its heavy industry and begin
 new construction.
 "Without petroleum derivatives, lubricating
 oils and transport facilities imported from
 the Soviet Union, our auto transport and railway
 traffic would have been impossible.
 "Without Soviet tractors, spare parts and
 other agricultural machines, tools and artificial
 fertilisers, Bulgaria would never have pro-
 ceeded to the establishment of co-operative
 farms on a mass scale, to the mechanisation and
 modernisation of our primitive agriculture.
 "Without the import of medicines, instru-
 ments and medical apparatus from the Soviet
 Union, no broad and extensive health  plan
 for the people could have been adopted.
 "The rubber, paper, cellulose and chemi-
 cals which were imported from the Soviet
 Union contributed to the further development of
 printing and publication, to the revival of the
 Bulgarian rubber industry.
 "Without different kinds of iron, tin, non-
 ferrous metals, machines, installations and fit-
 tings sent from the U.S.S.R., the construction
 of factories, dams, power projects and that of
 municipal and other administrative buildings,
 combines, baths, bakeries and laundries would
 not have been possible.
 "Without the electric building materials and
 ready-made fittings imported from the Soviet
 Union,  without  the  assistance  of  Soviet
 specialists in assembly and construction work,
 T.E.T.S. (the State Power Project)    would
 not have been established, electrification and
 the electrical industry in Bulgaria would have
 been impossible."
 Recognise the facts
 These are new relationships in the world
 of international politics-relationships in which
 a Great Power and smaller countries stand
 upon a footing of equality. They were never
 intended to be exclusive : it was the sustained and
 vindictive hostilitiy of the British and United
 States Governments after the war that has
 nearly killed all trades.  Even today peaceable
 relations could be established between East and
 West in Europe which would be beneficial to
 both sides. But they would have to accept as a
 fundamental that the socialist system in the
 People's Democracies has come to stay, and
 that they will never go back to being "agricul-
 tural, over-populated and poor."
