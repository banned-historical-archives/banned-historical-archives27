 I.  THE COMMUNIST BLOC
 Chinese Communist Defense Changes Strengthen Mao's Position
 The Peiping regime announced on 17 September personnel
 .changes in three of the most important defense and security
 posts.  Lin Piao replaces Peng Te-huai as minister of national
 defense, the top military post.  Lo Jui-ching replaces Huang
 Ko-cheng as chief of staff, the post probably second in impor-
 tance.                         Hsieh Fu-chih replaces Lo as minister of public security.
 All three of the new appointees have been close to Mao Tse-tung
 and the "party-machine" group of his lieutenants--that is, those
 party leaders whose importance derives principally from their
 positions in the central organs of the party rather than from,
 posts as government administrators, economic specialists, or
 military leaders.
 Lin Piao, whose long illness may have kept him from being
 named minister of defense years ago, has long seemed to be
 Mao's favorite military leader and was added to the party's po-
 litburo's standing committee last: year. Lo Jui-ching has ap-
 peared to be a protege of Mao throughout his career, and as
 minister of public security for the past ten years has been as-
 sociated with the party-machine leaders who supervise both
 overt and covert security work.  Hsieh Fu-chih, a provincial
 party boss for the past six years, has long been a lieutenant of
 two important politburo members regarded as party-machine
 figures.
 These changes may reflect recent and continuing opposi-
 tion by military figures to some of the policies affirmed by
 the dominant leaders at the party plenum last month- -policies
 which have been stridently defended by Peiping in recent weeks
 against critics in the party and abroad, including the Soviet party.

 In this connection, it is of interest that the two senior foreign
 ministers, Chang Wen-tien and Wang Chia-hsiang, long re-
 garded as particularly responsive to Soviet positions, have
 apparently also been replaced.
 Less dramatically, the changes may simply represent a
 continuation of the process--begun last October with the re-
 placement of chief of staff Su Yu--of strengthening the party's
 control over the armed forces.  There have been indications
 throughout the past year that the armed forces had remained
 insufficiently responsive to the dominant party leaders.  In
 either event, Mao and the party-machine figures, including
 Liu Shao-chi, appear to be the beneficiaries.
 Peng Te-huai, whose position as one of the party's top
 ten leaders has seemed to be based primarily on his Defense
 Ministry post, has almost certainly declined in power.    He
 apparently remains a vice premier, however, and there is no
 indication in the current announcement that he will be dropped
 from the party politburo. F7                              I

 Poland's Unorthodox Agricultural Program Criticized in Bloc
 Recent criticism of Poland's- unorthodox agricultural pol-
 icies- by some other satellite regimes probably reflects, their
 concern over the potentially divisive effect of these policies on
 their parties.  During Khrushchev's. July 1959 visit to Poland,
 he endorsed Gomulka and his agricultural policy, thereby pos-
 sibly encouraging those officials in other satellites who favor
 a moderate approach to agricultural collectivization.
 A Polish Ministry of Agriculture official who returned to
 Poland from Budapest on 11 September told the American charge
 in Warsaw that Hungarian agricultural officials had accused the
 Poles of "dragging their feet" on collectivization,  The Polish of-
 ficial said. that the Hungarians were calling the Poles "traitors"
 to socialism and added that East Germany had recently made the
 same accusation.  Czechoslovak representatives in Warsaw have
 also criticized Polish agricultural policies, according to US Am-
 bassador Beam.                             The Polish official asserted "We tell them that
 socialism is our goal, but that we will attain it in our own way;
 they try to force us to collectivize their way."
 Poland's new agricultural program announced by Gomulka in
 June is based on the nationwide expansion under party control of
 the agricultural circles- -voluntary co-operatives of independent
 peasants- -rather than on the establishment of collectives as in
 other satellite countries.

 Afghanistan Requests US Assistance to Build New Dam in
 Helmand Valley
 Afghan.Prim.e Minister Daud has formally requested Ameri-
 can assistance for a new $10,000,000 dam project in the Helmand
 Valley.  The dam would apparently be located on the lower reaches
 of the Helmand River in southwest Afghanistan about 45 miles from
 the Iranian border.
 Daud and other Afghan officials have recently expressed con-
 cern over American comments that major new Soviet economic
 aid projects accepted by Kabul seem to signify the end of Afghan-
 istan's neutrality policy. Daud probably hopes his request will
 emphasize his government's desire to retain US interest in Af-
 ghanistan.
 The Afghan prime minister said he is so determined to see
 the dam built that, if a grant cannot be arranged, he is prepared
 to accept a long-term loan.  His statement of determination may
 also have been intended, however, as a strong hint that he would
 turn to the USSR if US aid were refused.
 Daud probably also hopes, by building a dam which would
 enable Afghanistan to withhold waters from Iran, to force Iran
 to settle the long-standing dispute over the division of the Helmand
 River waters.  The Iranians have refused an offer by Afghan
 King Zahir of an agreement guaranteeing Iran a flow of 26 cubic
 meters of water per second, four more than the 22 suggested
 by the Neutral Commission of 1950.
 Iran probably would regard construction of the proposed
 dam as aimed at forcing it to accept what it regards as an un-
 satisfactory distribution of the Helmand River waters.  Tehran
 would also view such a dam as detrimental to its plans for de-
 veloping lands bordering on Afghanistan unless this were part
 of a broader plan involving both countries.

 The Situation in Portugal.
 Growing tension within Portugal's military establishment
 increases the possibility of a coup d'etat in the event of the
 death of Salazar or a recurrence,.of his serious illness of
 last January.  Generals Lopes da Silva and Beleza Ferras
 are considered possible "front men" for a junta which would
 be controlled by Under Secretary of the Army Francisco
 Costa Gomes, regarded as one of the most intelligent mem-
 bers of the military opposition, and Marshal Craveiro Lopes)
 (The 65-year-old Marshal Lopes was President of Portugal
 for the term ending in August 1958, but--apparently at Salazar's
 behest--was not renominated by the government party. Lopes
 has seemed a likely candidate to succeed Salazar in view of
 his popularity in military circles, as compared to the two
 most frequently mentioned contenders, Santos Costa, former
 defense minister, and the present defense minister, Botelho
 Moniz)
 (Lopes is said to have made several contacts with General
 Delgado, the unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1958.
 Delgado polled a remarkable number of votes for an opposi-
 tion candidate in Portugal, but his subsequent "intemperate"
 actions seem to have lost him popular prestige.  He now is
 in exile in Brazil)
 (At present, coup planning is reported to be directed not
 against Salazar but rather against "do nothing" ministers of
 the government.  The military are highly conscious of their
 determinative role in Portuguese politics

 The initial French domestic reaction to President De Gaulle's-
 new program for Algeria has been generally favorable, with pub-
 licly expressed opposition limited to the extreme right and to Com-
 munists,.  Louis Terrenoire, president of the Union for the New
 Republic, hailed the program as a "noble charter of French good
 faith," and the senior Independent party statesman, Paul Reynaud,
 also praised it.  De Gaulle's strongest support thus far has come
 from the center and non-Communist left, with the Catholic Popular
 Republican party expressing "unreserved." and the Socialists "a
 large measure" of approval.
 Evidence of French Community support came from one of
 the African leaders whose position had been most in doubt--Modibo
 Keito, president of the Mali Federation--who welcomed the speech
 as an alternative to war in settling the Algerian dispute.
 Although the press has reported. bitterness among junior
 French army officers in Algiers, over "shedding our blood and
 then abandoning Algeria," General Challe's, public pledge of the
 army's loyalty to De Gaulle's authority and the immediate imposi-
 tion of military censorship on any inflammatory public expression
 of opposition suggest that no army support for any extremist Euro-
 pean settlers is likely.    her opinion in Algeria has .been largely
 confined to disapproval by veterans' organizations, and some Euro-
 pean newspapers.  However, a few Moslem officials, including
 one senator, have commented favorably.
 Foreign press reaction is divided between France's European
 allies, all favorable, and the Arab nations, which generally are
 withholding comment pending reaction from the Algerian rebels.
 (The American Embassy in Paris believes that by making a
 sharp break with the past and staking his personal reputation on
 the new plan, De Gaulle has cut the grounds for objection from un-
 der all but the most extreme elements and now stands- a good. chance
 of "winning his gamble." The embassy also commented, however,
 that his increasingly desperate domestic French opponents could
 enormously complicate his position)
 Paris has welcomed President Eisenhower's 17 September
 statement as a "serious blow" to the insurgent leaders.
