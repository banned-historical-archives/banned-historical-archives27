 FAR EAST
 Sharp disputes evidently continue among top
 leaders in Peking,  even though open conflict and
 violence in the provinces have been much reduced.
 Differences may include the precise role of the army
 in civil affairs, particularly the critical agricul-
 ture problem,  and the balancing of rival interests
 in the new administrative machinery based on the
 three-way alliance of party organization,  army,  and
 pro-Mao militants.   Posters and parades are again
 being used to vilify those in disfavor in Peking.
 At the same time,  Sino-Soviet relations have
 taken a new turn for the worse.   In an unprecedented
 affront, Peking has expelled two Soviet diplomats
 for allegedly mistreating Chinese employees, and
 street demonstrations have again been mounted in
 front of the embassy,  though not on the earlier mas-
 sive scale.   Although this turn of events seems
 closely related to internal developments, Peking may
 also be reacting to Moscow's strident propaganda
 campaign against China.
 In South Vietnam,  the Constituent Assembly has
 completed almost all of the draft constitution. The
 assembly leaders probably will succeed in resolving
 the remaining differences with the military leaders
 informally before the draft is formally presented
 to the Directorate on 27 March.
 Indonesians apparently have calmly accepted
 the congressional decree declaring Sukarno incapable
 of fulfilling his presidential duties and naming
 General Suharto as acting president.   Suharto's
 military-dominated government now can focus on the
 county  's massive economic Problems,

 VIETNAM
 South Vietnam's nine-chapter
 constitution is nearing comple-
 tion following the Constituent
 Assembly's approval of a preamble
 on 14 March. Although differences
 with the Military Directorate
 over some provisions are still
 being worked out,  a final assem-
 bly vote on the document as a
 whole is still expected to take
 place in the next week or two.
 Chief of State Thieu has publicly
 predicted that the constitution
 will be promulgated by 25 April,
 and government leaders expect to
 hold the presidential election
 by September.
 Some of the democratic con-
 cepts embodied in the constitu-
 tion are in marked contrast to
 the traditional Vietnamese toler-
 ance of autocratic rule and of
 corruption as a way of life.   It
 makes the president,  legislature,
 and province chiefs responsible
 to the electorate.   It guarantees
 the rights of political parties
 and encourages a legal opposition.
 And it provides for a system of
 some checks and balances for the
 executive branch,  the legislature,
 and the independent judiciary,  as
 well as for special agencies to
 deal with official malfeasance.
 likely to function successfully
 only with the support of the mil-
 itary establishment.
 The outcome of the talks
 now under way between the Direc-
 torate and assembly members may
 in fact affect the final shape
 of the constitution.   The Direc-
 torate has proposed several
 changes in the draft,  including
 elimination of the legislature's
 present limited power to bring
 down the president's cabinet,
 and of the Constituent Assembly's
 assumption of legislative author-
 ity until the constitutional
 law-making body is elected.
 The assembly may be willing
 to yield its claim to act as an
 interim legislature,  and some
 compromise may be reached on the
 other issues. Otherwise the Di-
 rectorate may invoke its power--
 derived from the decree which
 established the assembly--to re-
 vise the constitution.   The as-
 sembly would have to muster a
 two-thirds majority to reverse
 such changes.

 In addition, Viet Conq forces
 appear to have intensified their

 ities of the South Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment.   Attacks of this type in
 part reflect heightened interest
 in disrupting any work associated
 with the Revolutionary Develop-
 ment  (RD) program.   Last weekend,
 for example, Viet Cong forces
 penetrated district-level instal-
 lations in three provinces,  in-
 flicted casualties,      and withdrew.

 VIETNAMESE COMMUNISTS ARRESTED IN THAILAND
 The Thai Government, con-
 cerned over increased Communist
 activity among the 35,000 Viet-
 namese refugees in northern
 Thailand, has extended its anti-
 subversive campaign there.   The
 arrest in mid-February of 79 sus-
 pected Comiiunists marked the
 largest step to date in an effort
 which began last fall and is ex-
 pected to continue.
 In recent months Bangkok
 has shown concern over the:;e
 Vietnamese Communists'  increased
 propaganda and recruiting efforts.
 The Vietnamese, who are refu-
 gees from the 1945-54 Indochina
 war,   live primarily in the larger
 towns of northeast Thailand and
 exert considerable economic and
 political influence in the area.
 Most of them are sympathetic to
 the Hanoi regime,  and Thai offi-
 cials estimate that ten percent
 are hard-core Communists.
 Bangkok's decision to move
 against the Vietnamese ref:,_ects a
 growing confidence in its rjeneral
 countersubversion efforts.   Last
 October a special committee was
 set up to deal with the protblem.

 RENEWED CONFLICT WITHIN CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP
 Open conflict and violence
 have largely been curbed in China,
 but new poster attacks and mass
 rallies denouncing several senior
 officials reveal that conflict
 among top leaders in Peking con-
 tinues.   It is possible that the
 army's role in the administration
 of civil affairs, particularly
 the vital area of agriculture, has
 become the subject of sharp dis-
 agreement.  Another source of
 dissension apparently is the dif-
 ficult
 problem of establishing
 the relative roles to be played
 by military commanders, party
 workers,  and militant "revolution-
 aries"                         in the new "three-way al-
 liances" to direct "revolutionary
 committees" which are to replace
 the old party structure through-
 out China.
 During the past two weeks
 Peking has been shifting away from
 the policy adopted in early Feb-
 ruary--and associated primarily
 with Premier Chou En-lai--of eas-
 ing the pressure on officials who
 had come under fire. According to
 a Red Guard newspaper distributed
 in Peking on 10 March, nine sec-
 ond-level officials were dragged
 out and humiliated before a rally
 of 100,000 Red Guards, workers,
 and troops on 25 February.   For-
 eign newsmen report that since 9
 March Peking has again been
 plastered with posters and wall
 newspapers denouncing men holding
 important positions.
 The main target has begin
 Vice Premier Tan Chen-lin,  _he
 politburo's agricultural sp,2~cia-
 list.    Well-organized demonstra-
 tions against Tan and a few
 other leaders were held in 'eking
 on 11,  14,  and 15 March. Tai now
 has been thrust into the same
 unredeemable category as fo rnier
 party leaders Liu Shao-chi, r'eng
 Hsiao-ping,  and Tao Chu.
 Tan and several other rice
 premiers were defended from Red
 Guard criticism in early January
 by Premier Chou and Madame Kao.
 Chou, who runs the State Co a cil,
 complained on 1 February to  ,
 group of "revolutionary reb_s"
 that the council was "short of
 hands" because it had only s---x
 working vice premiers left,  __n-
 cluding Tan.    According to ai
 current poster, however,  Chi
 Pen-yu,  a senior Cultural R volu-
 tion Group official now is  Saying
 that previous defense of Tai by
 officials has been withdrawn.
 On 15 and 16 March two
 other vice premiers--Li Fu-shun
 and Li Hsien-nien--were mildly
 criticized in posters, but others
 went up defending them.   Man-
 defensive-sounding posters as-
 serting that Chou "follows the
 revolutionary line laid down by
 Chairman Mao" were displayed in
 Peking on 16 March.

 The main charges against
 Tan are that he "deceived" Chou
 En-lai and tried to curb the
 Cultural Revolution in the
 countryside.   This suggests that
 Tan is a casualty of a high-level
 dispute in late February over
 agricultural policy and the army's
 role in this critical area.   On
 23 February the army was ordered
 to supervise spring farmwork where
 :Local farm leadership was "weak."
 large
 numbers of rural party function-
 aries are demoralized. A People's
 Daily editorial on 12 March de-
 scribed what probably is the sit-
 uation in many areas:   it said
 that some officials, who have been
 "criticized by the masses because
 of their mistakes,  are afraid of
 this and that and filled with re-
 sentment, maintain a negative at-
 titude, deliberately slow down
 the work,  and even care nothing
 about the work."
 Serious trouble is also ap-
 parent in strengthening adminis-
 tration at the provincial level.
 With the help of the army, dis-
 order and conflict has largely
 ended, but little headway has been
 made toward the positive goals of
 rebuilding effective governing
 institutions.   Peking has been
 trying to set up the new "revolu-
 tionary committees," but thus far
 only five have been publicized at
 the provincial level,  and none in
 the past two weeks.   They are
 clearly provisional organizations
 and their top membership has not
 been revealed.
 The only areas where the old
 provincial leaders have been en-
 dorsed as "good cadres" are the
 strategic border regions of Sin-
 kiang and Tibet and Heilungkiang
 Province in the northeast.   The
 first secretary of the Northeast
 party bureau has also been praised.
 Some others doubtless will sur-
 face--perhaps in lesser positions---
 but the great majority of first
 secretaries have been denounced by
 Maoist leaders or by authoritative
 Red Guard newspapers as "reaction-
 ary revisionists" or "counter-
 revolutionary coup plotters," and
 probably have been brought down.
 The failure to announce their
 successors suggests that leaders
 in Peking are unable to reach
 agreement on new appointments.
 This is indicated by a major Red
 Flag editorial broadcast on 9
 March, which retreated from the
 conciliatory position taken during
 February toward old party offi-
 cials.   The editorial,  admitting
 that few satisfactory "three-way
 alliances" had been set up, com-
 plained that militant revolution-
 i aries were not being given a
 strong leadership role and that
 too many party officials,  includ-
 ing "class enemies," were partici-
 pating.   Red Flag again emphasized
 the key role of -the military in

 CHINA STEPS UP CAMPAIGN AGAINST USSR
 After a month of relative quiet
 the Chinese have resumed their ef-
 forts to humiliate Soviet officials
 in China.   It is unclear whether
 this latest campaign will reach the
 proportions of anti-Soviet demon-
 strations last month when the Soviet
 Embassy in Peking was under a vir-
 tual state of siege for more than
 two weeks.   Current tactics suggest
 that,  for the present at least,  the
 Chinese intend to keep the campaign
 in low key.
 On 11 March,  China expelled two
 Soviet Embassy officials in an un-
 precedented diplomatic affront.
 Peking alleged that they had in-
 sulted and threatened the Chinese
 employees of the embassy,  all of
 whom had been fired after walking
 off their jobs during the violent
 demonstrations in February.   After
 the Soviet staff rebuffed their re-
 peated attempts to return to the
 embassy, the Chinese staff an-
 nounced its "collective resigna-
 tions" on 6 March.   This will make
 day-to-day :Living and operation of
 the embassy even more difficult for
 the Russians.   Since then new dem-
 onstrations have been staged in the
 street in front of the Soviet Em-
 bassy,  although on a much smaller
 scale than the earlier ones.   Peking
 has also formally protested a recent
 incident in which Soviet frontier
 guards allegedly seized copies of
 Mao's works on a Chinese train en
 route to Moscow.
 Peking's resumption of its
 anti-Soviet campaign is probably
 related,  at least in part,  to Chi-
 nese internal developments.   Mod-
 eration of open, vituperative
 attacks against Soviet personnel
 last month generally coincided
 with surface appearances of a more
 restrained internal polic,,.   China's
 latest anti-Soviet moves coincide
 with indications of renewer dissen-
 sion and instability among the top
 leaders in Peking  (see preceding
 article).
 The latest moves are probably
 also a response to Moscow's in-

 China.   The USSR has recently in-
 creased the number of Mandarin
 broadcasts to China which cive
 heavy play to continuing bitter
 opposition within China to the

 INDONESIA FORMALIZES "NEW ORDER"
 The "new order" in Indonesia
 was formalized on 12 March when
 congress unanimously passed a
 decree declaring Sukarno "no
 Longer capable" of fulfilling his
 presidential duties and naming
 General Suharto acting president.
 Suharto was installed in his new
 post the same day.
 The compromise decree with-
 draws all constitutional authority
 from Sukarno and, by prohibiting
 his participation in political
 activity until after the next
 election,  appears to remove any
 possibility that he can stage a
 political comeback.   To avoid
 offending Sukarno's supporters,
 the president was not specifically
 dismissed,  and even the suspension
 or retention of his title was not
 made explicit.   The decree im-
 plies that Sukarno will not be
 brought to trial as demanded by
 students and other activists.  It
 requires a judicial "settlement"
 of Sukarno's past activities but
 :Leaves its implementation to Su-
 harto, who has publicly opposed
 a trial.
 Reaction by both pro- and
 anti-Sukarno elements has been
 restrained.   No violence has been
 reported from East or Central
 Java,  the areas of Sukarno's
 principal support.    The pro-
 Sukarno National Party newspaper
 in Djakarta accepted the decree
 and called for renewed efforts
 to ensure national unity.   Anti-
 Sukarno student leaders, although
 disappointed that the decree
 avoided blunt language, know that
 they have achieved their main
 goal.
 Little further change in
 the composition or practice of
 government seems likely for the
 present.   Sukarno is said to
 have no present intention of re-
 shuffling the cabinet,  and he
 apparently plans to retain com-
 mand of the army, which will
 continue to determine national
 policy and to occupy significant
 posts at all levels of govern-
 ment.   Civilians may well resent
 the growing pervasiveness of
 military influence, but they
 have little capability to trans-
 late their feelings into signif-
 icant political action.
 Suharto has set economic
 improvement and the holding of
 national elections as the gov-
 ernment's major targets.   Voters
 are scheduled to choose the par-
 liamentary and congressional
 membership no later than. mid-
 1968;  congress in turn will. elect
 the president and vice president.
 The deteriorated economy
 remains the nation's major prob-
 lem.  A stabilization pl.a.n which
 is being gradually implemented
 retarded the rate of inflation
 during the last quarter of 1966,
 but increased government. expend-
 itures in December and the an-
 nual rice shortage during the past
 three months have spiraled prices
 up again.   International. Monetary
 Fund advisers to the Djakarta
 government believe that the sta-
 bilization program should grad-
 ually evolve toward a comprehen-
 sive development. program which
 would be implemented after the
 present inflation has been con-

 EUROPE
 The disarmament talks in Geneva continue to be
 stalled while the US is attempting to clear up
 European reservations about the draft nonprolifera-
 tion treaty.
 The treaty also fiqures in the slight coolness
 which appears to be afflicting Soviet-French rela-
 tions.   Moscow suspects that the French may be en-
 couraging Bonn to oppose the treaty.   The Soviets are
 also irritated by the French pledge to back the Ger-
 mans'  diplomatic initiatives toward Eastern Europe
 and by De Gaulle's refusal so far to sign the outer
 space treaty.   For his part De Gaulle may be miffed
 by signs that Moscow is wooing the British more
 ardently than it is the French.
 The French Government was rudely jolted by the
 results of the recent elections for the National
 Assembly, which brought heavy leftist gains at the
 expense of the Gaullists.

 economic and social programs
 should be oriented more to the
 left to beat the PCF and the
 Federation at their own game.
 With almost 200 seats,  the
 left was the main beneficiary
 in the election.   The 75-percent
 increase in Communist seats,
 however, was not the result of
 a net gain in the PCF vote but
 of a cooperative exchange of
 votes with the Federation;  the
 stronger   left candidate in in-
 dividual districts received the
 support of the other party.   On
 the first ballot, the Communists
 got 22.4 percent of the vote,
 as compared with 21.8 percent in
 1962.   On the second ballot,
 they dropped to a fraction below
 the 1962 figure.
 The PCF over the past sev-
 eral years has gained a measure
 of respectability which was con-
 siderably enhanced by its tac-
 tical electoral agreement with
 the Federation.   The lesson that
 left-wing unity was the key to
 election successes will not be
 lost on the Federation and should
 give the Communists a formidable
 voice in determining the outlook
 of the left.   The status of the
 PCF is further enhanced by the
 fact that a large number of
 Federation seats were won with
 PCF votes and because virtually
 all  orominent non-Communist
 leaders of the left own the .r
 seats to Communist backing.
 The tactical unity acn3_eved
 by the Federation and the "CF
 for electoral purposes will be
 hard to preserve in the assembly
 because the two are still  =acr
 from agreeing on a common program
 for action in the parliament.

 some degree,  there is small chance
 that they could effectivel" chal-

 sues the two might unite against
 the government but would be un-
 ikely to pick up much support
 from the center, whose views more
 closely parallel those of  -I.e
 government.   Under the French
 system,  the only way the assembly
 can oust the government is by
 passing a motion of censure by
 a majority vote.
 Jean Lecanuet's Democratic
 Center failed to muster ever. the
 30 seats necessary for recocni-
 tion as a parliamentary group-
 ing--a prerequisite for corlmittee
 assignments.   Lecanuet is claim-

 detach from his camp the depu-
 ties who owe their seats to

 EAST GERMAN FRIENDSHIP TREATIES WITH POLES AND CZECHS
 East Germany on 15 March
 signed a treaty of friendship and
 mutual assistance with Poland and
 is scheduled to sign a similar
 pact with Czechoslovakia on the
 17th.   These treaties are part of
 a continuing effort to prevent
 East Germany's isolation within
 the Warsaw Pact and to strengthen
 Eastern European resistance to
 ';Nest German diplomatic initia-
 tives.
 After Rumania established
 diplomatic relations with West
 Germany without conditions on 31
 January,  the East Germans and
 Eloies engaged in a series of dip-
 lonatic moves designed to obtain
 Warsaw Pact agreement on how to
 respond to Bonn's overtures. When
 the pact's foreign ministers
 .Failed to agree at a meeting in
 early February, Poland, East Ger-
 many,  and a somewhat hesitant
 Czechoslovakia devised a scheme--
 a series of bilateral treaties--
 .intended to strengthen the status
 quo in central Europe.
 Although all other Eastern
 European nations have such treat-
 ies with one another,  these are
 the first that East Germany has
 concluded with any country other
 than the Soviet Union.
 On 1 March the Poles and
 Czechs renewed their bilateral
 alliance, while attacking Bonn and
 stressing that East Germany is a
 sovereign state.   The treaty of
 15 March between Poland and East
 Germany reaffirms the permanence
 of their frontiers,  conditions
 German reunification on a "normal-
 ization" of relations between the
 two Germanys,  and specifies that
 West Berlin is a separate polit-
 ical unit. The Czech - East German
 treaty probably will contain sim-
 ilar provisions.
 East German leader Ulbricht
 has hinted that he might: seek ad-
 ditional. bilateral treaties, pre-
 sumably with Hungary and Bulgaria.
 The effort to make the facade of
 Eastern European solidarity on
 the German question more impres-
 sive was certainly the main aim
 of Polish leader Gomulka's 8 March
 visit to Budapest.   His planned
 trip to Sofia in April will. un-
 doubtedly have the same objective.
 These efforts to blunt Bonn's
 initiatives, however,  are not
 likely to be successful in the
 long run.   The Czechs have not
 joined Ulbricht and Gomulka in
 posing conditions for diplomatic
 ties with West Germany and report-
 edly intend to continue negotiat-
 ing with Bonn.   West Germany ne-
 gotiations with Hungary and Bul-
 garia--the weakest links in bloc
 solidarity on this issue--are un-
 likely to be more than delayed by
 their allies' moves.   Even the
 Poles have been taking sensitive
 probings of West German intentions
 in an effort to avoid eventual
 isolation with the Ulbricht re-
 gime.   These probin s will likel
 be intensified.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 French officials now believe that French
 Somaliland voters will opt to remain with France by
 a margin of 55-65 percent.   Should the vote go
 against France, De Gaulle threatens to pull out of
 Somaliland,  and Ethiopia might take some military
 action to prevent a Somali Republic take-over of
 the territory.   Eastern Nigeria has moved   erilously
 closer to seceding from the Federation,
 In South Asia, Indira Gandhi's new government
 had to impose direct rule in Rajasthan State when
 the local Congress and the opposition parties were
 unable to form a government amid considerable vio-
 lence there.   Congress is hoping to avoid a similar
 situation in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh.
 Pakistan has been negotiating with France for a
 wide range of military equipment,  including jet
 aircraft and submarines,  and deliveries may have
 already begun.
 In Greece,  attention has again focused on the
 treason trial of officers involved in last year's
 "Aspida" affair,  and on 16 March 15 officers were
 sentenced to prison terms ranging from 2 to 18 years.
 The officers intend to appeal. There is still spec-
 ulation in Athens that a general amnesty might yet
 be granted.   Those who earlier dismissed amnesty as
 "unthinkable" now see it as a good way to maintain
 an atmosphere of "normalcy" until the May elections.
 The Arab Defense Council, which ended its ses-
 sions in Cairo on 14 March, apparently decided to
 withhold further monetary aid to Jordan, but re-
 jected a proposal to condemn strongly the boycott-
 ing states of Jordan, Saudi Arabia,  and Tunisia.

 MRS, GANDHI FORMS A NEW INDIAN GOVERNMENT
 Indira Gandhi again has been
 chosen by Congress Party leaders
 as India's prime minister,  after an
 abortive bid for the job by aging
 party stalwart Morarji Desai.   After
 failing to gain much support from
 either the party's bosses or its
 members of parliament,  Desai, a
 sharp critic of Mrs. Gandhi's last
 government, withdrew his candidacy
 on the eve of the 12 March party
 parliamentary caucus.
 Although Mrs.  Gandhi's 19-mem-
 ber cabinet contains a number of
 new faces,  the major portfolios of
 home, defense, externa-l'affairs
 and planning did not,change hams'.
 Her most important change was nam-
 ing the 71-year-old Desai as deputy
 prime minister--an office vacant
 since the death in 1950 of the pow-
 erful Sardar Patel.   Desai,  leader
 of the conservative wing of the'
 Congress Party, was also given the
 finance portfolio, which,he held
 in one of Nehru's cabinets.
 The new food and agriculture   -
 minister is Jagjivan Ram,  an almost
 perennial cabinet fixture who is a
 leader of the north Indian untouch
 Several of the lesser portfo-
 lios will be held by younger men
 in their first cabinet posts.
 The most influential of these is
 41--year-old Minister of Commerce
 Dinesh Singh,  a :Leftist-oriented
 confidant of Mrs..  Gandhi who held
 a :junior ministerial position in
 her first government.   Two other
 new ministers are regarded as ex-
 perts in their assigned fields--
 transport and shipping,  and edu-
 cation.
 Rising prices,  inflationary
 pressures,  a foreign exchange
 shortage,  and unemployment are
 only a few of the more critical
 problems that will require the
 new government's immediate atten-
 tion.   The food situation, despite
 substantial assistance from
 abroad, will remain extremely
 tight at least until the autumn
 crop is harvested.   In the polit-
 ical sphere,  the government will
 have to deal with severa:L strongly
 anti-Congress state administra-
 tions and an enlarged and em-
 boldened opposition in parlia-
 ment.
 These problems, mays create
 tension within the new cabinet
 in which widely disparate ideo-
 logical views are represented.
 Moreover,  the strained personal
 relationship between Mrs.  Gandhi
 and Desai could prove difficult.
 Radical shifts in established
 government policies, however,
 are not expected--at least in
 the short run.   Like its pred-
 ecessor,  the new government will
 be more concerned with domestic
 than international affairs,  con-

 DISSIDENCE INCREASING IN ETHIOPIA'S ERITREA PROVINCE
 Dissidence in the separatist-
 minded province of Eritrea has
 become the Ethiopian Government's
 number one internal security
 problem, primarily because the
 Eritrean Liberation Front  (ELF),
 the principal separatist organiza-
 tion, has stepped up its terrorism
 over the past year.   The ELF has
 been increasingly successful in
 hit-and-run raids against Etili-o-
 pian military forces,  and range
 freely in large areas of wesern
 Eritrea, particularly along she
 Sudanese border and the Red :yea
 coast.   The ELF also has beer
 gaining sympathy among the Eri-
 trean populace,  to whom banditry
 is an accepted way of life,  and

 hostility to the dissident Addis
 Ababa government is widespread.
 The ELF has expressed no
 clear ideas on how an independent
 Eritrea would be governed,  and
 it has no single,  strong leader,
 although Idris Mohamed Adum, an
 exiled former high Eritrean of-
 ficial,  is the acknowledged head.
 Its members are largely Muslims,
 but it is trying to gain support
 among Eritrea's Christians--some
 of whom are already in the ELF
 high command.   Estimates of the
 number of hard core ELF insurgents
 range from 600 to a possible
 1,500.
 The key to ELF success is
 the support of outside sources,
 ;mostly Arab states.   Syria,  the
 principal supplier of arms,    and
 Iraq provide training to ELF in-
 surgents who have begun returning
 to Eritrea in increasing numbers.
 Saudi Arabia has given financial
 backing,  and Somalia offers what
 limited support it can.   The Com-
 munist countries too give covert
 encouragement
 Much of the ELF's success
 can also be attributed to the
 inept handling of the insurgency
 problem by the Ethiopian admin-
 istration and military.   Emperor
 Haile Selassie has generally
 ignored advice to initiate social
 and economic reforms which prob-
 ably would have gone far to
 soften discontent with his regime.
 Moreover,  in their heavy--handed
 operations against the ELF,  the
 6,300 army troops and paramilitary
 police within Eritrea often deal
 brutally with the civilian popu-
 lation.
 The increasing insurgency
 could pose problems for Kagnew,
 the vital US communications sta-
 tion in Asmara.   The US may come
 under increasing pressure to
 assist Haile Selassie in meeting
 the ELF threat; he has already
 asked for helicopters.   Any US
 assistance could provoke ELF re-
 taliation against Kagnew or its
 personnel by the ELF, which has
 not shown itself to be anti-
 American.   Since early 1967, ELF
 leaders have assured a number of
 US representatives abroad that
 the insurgent activities are not
 aimed at the US presence in
 IRAN'S ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST COUNTRIES
 Iran's economic relations
 with the Communist countries are
 expanding at a modest rate.   The
 importance Moscow attaches to
 this trend is indicated by the
 fact that Minister of Foreign
 Trade Patolichev himself recently
 went to  Tehran  to sign a new
 $540-million,  five-year trade
 agreement.   This will presumably
 include the Iranian exports of
 natural gas scheduled to begin
 in 1970.   Although nothing defi-
 nite has emerged,  the minister's

 party probably also discussed
 the eventual marketing by the
 USSR of Iranian offshore Caspian
 oil--a project now being devel-
 oped with Soviet assistance but
 still in the exploratory stage.
 There are currently over
 400 Soviet engineers and tech-
 nicians in Iran engaged in vari-
 ous projects.   In addition to the
 Caspian oil survey,  the projects
 include exploration of the Kerman
 coal fields and related surveys
 connected with the steel plant

 Aras River, which forms part of
 the Iranian-Soviet border.   The
 Soviets have begun building the
 division roads at the dam site
 and a bridge connecting Soviet
 and Iranian territory,  and So-
 viet trucks, bulldozers,  and
 drilling machines needed for con-
 struction of the dam itself have
 arrived.
 Bulgaria and Rumania re-
