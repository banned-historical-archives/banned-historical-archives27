 Saigon
 Buddhist leaders in Saigon apparently have con-
 vinced their more militant followers to accept for the
 time being the government's pledge to expand the Di-
 rectorate                                 (National Leadership Committee) by 6 June.
 Thich Ho Giac apparently addressed some 2,000 persons
 at the Buddhist Institute today urging them to give the
 Directorate until Monday to add ten civilian members to
 it,  according to press reports.   Signs of opposition to
 Ho Giac's statement of acceptance were noted, however,
 Some members of the Buddhist Monks and Nuns Association
 reportedly condemned the move and indicated more suicides
 as a protest.   During a funeral procession for two im-
 molated Buddhists led by Tam Chau today, marchers re-
 portedly beat a plainclothes security agent but did not
 demonstrate.
 In the opinion of General Khang, one of the more mil-
 itant Directorate members,  the Buddhists are suffering
 from a "severe" power struggle and are losing popular
 support.

 General Nhuan, the 1st Division commander, moved
 back into Hue along with several disparate military ele-
 ments of the 1st Division who are supposedly loyal to
 the government.   According to the Consular officer, how-
 ever,  the loyalty of these troops would probably be to
 the struggle forces in the event of a showdown.   The
 situation is similar to that of a few days ago when Colonel
 Khoa moved a supposedly loyal battalion of the 3rd Regi-
 ment into the city to guard US installations only to
 have them capitulate in front of the struggle students
 who burned the Consulate building.     The Consular of-
 ficer fears renewed violence in Hue and feels that the
 situation will continue to deteriorate given government
 vacillation.
 Thich Tri Quang's only reaction so far to the Bud-
 dhist-government compromise was in the form of a message
 to President Johnson.   Quang said the attack on Thich
 Thien Minh was organized by the Ky-Thieu regime.   He
 made no mention of the meetings in Saigon between Bud-
 dhist Institute leaders and government officials.

 (Information as of 1:30 AM EDT)
 1.    The cautious compromise worked out between govern-
 ment and Buddhist leaders should quiet the crisis
 atmosphere in Saigon for at least the next few days.
 A.   Buddhist leaders in Saigon have generally
 restrained excessive reactions by their fol-
 lowers to the attack on militant bonze Thien
 Minh on 1 June.
 B.   They have also cautioned their followers to
 avoid excessive agitation against the regime
 until it is clear how the agreement on expan-
 sion of the "war cabinet" leadership bodies will
 be carried out.
 II.    The Buddhists apparently agreed to dampen their
 agitation in return for implementation of recently
 announced government plans to expand the present
 National Leadership Committee (NLC).
 A.   Ten civilian representatives--presumably in-
 cluding spokesmen for the Buddhists--are to be
 added before 6 June.

 B.    The chairman of the NLC,  General Thieu, will
 apparently resign as agreed by the members at
 yesterday's meeting.
 C.    The enlarged NLC will "make an effort" to set
 up a "civilian and armed forces council" prior
 to 19 June to "assist" the Central Executive
 Committee,  chaired by Ky.
 1.   It is not clear whether references by gov-
 ernment leaders to the "National Leadership
 Committee" are synonymous with Buddhist
 references to the "Directorate."
 III.    It appears that the accord to enlarge the NLC was
 agreed upon without too much reaction from the Direc-
 t+Orate generals.
 A.   It is possible that they feel their positions
 as daily executors of Directorate policy will not
 be significantly threatened.
 IV.    Some agitation may occur during the celebration of
 Buddha's birthday on 3 June.
 A.   There are indications that some Buddhist groups
 hope to conduct the observances with dignity and
 without political overtones.
 B.   There is other cvidence that efforts are being
 made,  possibly with some Buddhist connivance,  to
 organize strikes and demonstrations on 3 June.

 V.    In Hue, meanwhile,  progovernment troop units
 moved in today without any resistance.
 A.   Government sources said the radio station
 and key points of the city have been secured
 without a shot 'being fired so far.
 B.   It is not clear,  however, whether the troops
 will obey orders to prevent further violence
 by the dissident forces or participate in any
 effort to disarm or overpower the rebels.
 1.   Some "struggle" troops obtained supplies
 of heavy caliber automatic weapons during
 the violence in the city on 1 June.
 VI.   Only light contact with the Viet Cong has been
 reported during thepast several days.
 A.    Border surveillance patrols are continuing in
 allied Operation PAUL REVERE,  a major sweep
 operation in western Pleiku Province.
 B.    All other operations involving US personnel
 continue without significant contact with the
 enemy.
 VII.    There are continuing indications that the Com-
 munists are moving substantial numbers-of reinforce-
 ments into northwestern Pleiku Province.

 in Paragraph V below
 I.    Only fragmentary returns from yesterday's elec-
 tion are available.   Vote totals have been
 coming in slowly and it may not be possible to
 discern any clear trend until late today.
 A.   With an estimated 50 percent of the expected
 Santo Domingo vote of 240,000 reported:
 1.   Dominican Revolutionary Party candidate
 Juan Bosch appears to be leading with
 about 59.4 percent of the vote.
 2.   Reformist Party candidate Balaguer has
 38.8 percent of the vote.
 3.   Bonnelly trails with only 2.2 percent.
 B.   In 1962,  Bosch captured 78 percent of the
 capital's vote,  and without a similar margin
 will have difficulty overcoming the lead
 Balaguer is likely to develop elsewhere.
 Scattered returns from the interior show
 Balaguer doing extremely well.
 II.    No significant instances of fraud or violence
 marred the election, which foreign observers
 lauded as "exemplary."

 B.    None of the political factions has levied

 III.   Favorable weather aided in promoting a good-
 sized turnout--estimated at 1.2 million,  or 65
 to 70 percent of the eligible voters.
 IV.   The turnout and the relatively large number of
 women who cast ballots are thought to favor
 Balaguer's chances.
 V.   As of 0900 AM EDT unofficial returns show
 Balaguer with 168,366 votes while Bosch is
 trailing with 122,078    The two Santo Domingo

 Dominican Election Situation Report No.  12
 (As of 5:45 AM EDT)
 1.   Radio Santo Domingo's tabulation of the vote
 count has fallen considerably behind tallies reported
 by the press services.   At 0230 local time, Reuters
 credited Balaguer with 154,110 to 133,498 for Bosch
 in the total national vote.
 2.   Radio Santo Domingo's tabulation, which provides
 a breakdown by polling place,  shows Bosch carrying the
 National District by 57.5 percent--a drop of 20 per-
 centage points below his 1962 margin.   Bosch's share of
 the National District vote has declined slowly but
 steadily during the night.
 3.   Scattered returns from outside the capital
 indicate that Balaguer is doing extremely well;  even in
 areas where Bosch is leading,  the PRD candidate's total
 is down markedly from four years ago.
 4.   According to the press,  an unidentified high
 official of Bosch's party has said that if the PRD wins,
 it will do so b  a narrow margin.

 v     GONFI DENTI AL
 COMMUNIST CHINA -- DEVELOPMENTS IN
 LEADERSHIP STRUMP-
 (since last   rid ing on 26May)
 1.     A shake=up of Mao Tse-tung's inner circle of ad-
 visers definitely appears to be taking place.
 A.    Last week we told you that we had been de-
 tecting signs that a behind-the-scenes power
 struggle was under way.
 B.    Mao Tse-tung's personal position still seems
 to be secure.   His grip probably was loosened
 for a time during his recent 52 month absence
 from public view, but he appeared to be healthy
 and alert in movies taken in early May.
 C.    This is what we now think about the status
 of his five top advisers:
 1.   Peng Chen, sixth in the power structure,
 has probably been the victim of a power
 play engineered by his old rival Teng
 Hsiao-ping.   He is still out of-eight
 and a Rumanian official in Peking told
 a British diplomat on 26 May that Peng
 has lost his positions.

 2.            Teng is the powerful general secretary.
 Peng's removal would strengthen his po-
 sition and likely weaken that of Liu
 Shao-chi who has been number two in the
 party since at least 1945.   It is even
 possible that the highly militant and
 vigorous Teng has supplanted the color-
 less Liu as Mao's chosen successor.
 3.      The flexible Chou En-lai--China's Mikoyan
 --appears thus far to have managed to
 stay aloof from the fray.   He is a useful
 technician and as such has a good chance
 to survive.
 4.      Contrary to Western press speculation,
 Defense Minister Lin Piao probably is
 not a contender for power.  His name is
 often used to reinforce Mao's authority,
 but he has been chronically ill for
 nearly 30 years.   Lin seemed to be ex-
 tremely frail in recent movies taken
 with Mao Tse-tung.   He probably does
 not aspire to the top job.
 II.   The Chinese Communists still haven't named any

 B.   The Rumanian official I mentioned earlier
 also said that Lo Jui-ching had been removed
 as army chief of staff two months or so ago.
 Lo,  a top security man as well as chief of
 the army,  is one of a group of key officials
 who have been out of public view for many
 months and who may have been casualties of
 the struggle.   Others on the list are the
 head of the central committee's propaganda
 department and the commander of the Peking
 Military Region, who is Yang Yung.
 C.   On 26 May a deputy director of the Central
 Committee Propaganda Department was accused
 of backing an "antiparty" play produced in
 Shanghai.   Certain other "muddleheaded" high
 officials were also said to have supported
 the play.
 D.    A new nationwide campaign has been develop-
 ing this past week against unnamed high of-
 ficials who have ridiculed the practical
 value of Mao Tse-tung's political tracts.

 DCI BRIEFING NOTES
 INDONESIA
 1.   The new Indonesian Government is embarking on a
 moderate course in both domestic and international
 affairs.
 A.     Indonesia's three major leaders now are General
 Suharto, Foreign Minister Adam Malik,  and the
 Sultan of  Jogjakarta,  who directs economic
 matters.
 1.    They are giving top priority to solving
 domestic problems.   This means, first of
 all,  trying to put Indonesia's long misused
 economy on a more rational basis.
 2.    Malik and the Sultan have stated publicly
 that they will accept aid from any country.
 The US is sending 50,000 tons of rice--a frac-
 tion of Indonesia's need--in the near future.
 3.    Malik has announced that Indonesia will return
 to its former neutral path in international
 affairs,  and has expressed an intention to
 return Indonesia to the United Nations.
 II.   Sukarno is still president and prime minister, but
 his de facto power is slight.

 A.    He continues to maneuver to regain at least
 the appearance of political initiative.   His
 assets have been so greatly reduced,  however,
 that at most he should only be able to ob-
 struct the government's new policies tem-
 porarily.
 B.    Some of General Suharto's advisers are sug-
 gesting that he depose or exile Sukarno;
 Suharto, aware of Sukarno's continuing popu-
 larity in parts of the nation,  apparently
 prefers to do neither.
 III.    While relations with the West have improved, re-
 lations with Communist China are at an all-time
 low.
 A.    Anti-Chinese activity has mounted throughout
 Indonesia.
 1.   Overseas Chinese schools have been closed,
 and many Chinese businesses have been con-
 fiscated by anti-Communist Moslem groups.
 2.   In mid-April,  in the most extreme of many
 attacks on official Chinese installations,
 the Communist Chinese Embassy in Djakarta
 was sacked.

 B.    The new Djakarta regime, by its failure to curb
 this activity,  appears to be pushing relations
 with Peking to the breaking point.   Neither Peking
 nor Djakarta appear willing to initiate a formal
 break, however.   Continuing propaganda warfare
 between Peking and Djakarta is likely to become
 more and more abusive.
 C.   Foreign Minister Malik and other leaders have
 expressed a desire to end Indonesia's
 confrontation with Malaysia, but there are no
 firm indications that the new government is ready
 to accept the present composition of the Malaysian
 federation.
 1.     Confrontation,  therefore,  is likely to con-
 tinue on a political level, while its military
 aspect,  already at a low level,  gradually
 diminishes.
 2.     Djakarta's announcement that it will soon
 recognize Singapore is viewed primarily as an
 effort to bolster the Indonesian economy by
 resuming the once-lucrative trade with Singa-
 pore.   At the same time, Djakarta's overture
 to Singapore has already served to widen the
 breach between Malaysia and Singapore--an
 extra dividend for Indonesia.

 3.   Talks in Bangkok on 30 April and 1 May
 between the Indonesian and Philippine
 foreign ministers produced an understand-
 ing that the Philippines will recognize
 Malaysia in early June and that Indonesia
 will recognize Singapore shortly there-
 after.
 4.   Malik has told a Malaysian official that
 Indonesia would like another survey of
 public opinion in Malaysia's Borneo
 territories as to whether people want to
 remain under Malaysian administration.

 1.   The plot which the Congolese army foiled on
 30 May was less significant than President
 Mobutu's reaction to it.
 A.   The four main plotters were all run-of-
 the-mill civilian politicians.   None had
 any particular political power, none had
 shown any conspiratorial skills, and the
 plot was never a real 'threat to Mobutu.
 B.   Mobutu nevertheless ordered their summary
 trial and public execution.
 1.    This is in line with other indications
 of a growing authoritarianism as Mobutu
 wrestles with the problem of making his
 authority felt throughout the country.
 II.    In breaking up the plot,  the top ranks of the
 army once again proved their loyalty to Mobutu,
 but at the same time they demonstrated the degree
 to which Mobutu           must cultivate that loyalty in
 order to stay in power.

 N"W             S. JC'K.I'1,                    -14610,
 A.   Mobutu and his officers will probably remain
 interdependent for some time, with neither
 willing nor able to challenge the other.
 B.   The officer corps will probably assume an
 ever-larger role in Congolese political life
 and will reinforce Mobutu's own authoritarian
 tendencies.
 III.    Some members of the                               Belgian
 Embassy in Leopoldville apparently were involved
 to a minor degree with the plotters,  although no
 foreign embassy gave the plot any active support.
 A.   The Belgian involvement will aggravate Mobutu's
 current animosity toward Belgium.
 B.   His attitude may be reflected in a harder Con-
 golese line in the current economic talks with
 Belgium,  now recessed after two weeks of in-
 conclusive negotiations.

 I.   Fidel Castro's recent actions appear to result
 from deepening personal frustrations over the
 regime's continuing inability to surmount basic
 economic and administrative problems.
 A.   The administrative purge of a number of
 medium-level officials in the ministries of
 foreign affairs,  foreign trade,  and CUBANA
 airlines was designed to restore dynamism
 to Castro's regime and to revive revolution-
 ary enthusiasm.                                       It may have had the opposite
 effect, however.
 1.   The March 7 to March ll,trial of Major
 Rolando Oubela, sentenced for plotting
 to assassinate Castro, probably had the
 same goal, as well as the aim of deter-
 ring other would-be plotters.
 2.= Armed Forces Vice Minister Ameijeiras was
 dismissed on March 17.
 he had long been in
 disfavor with the regime.   Several top

 reshuffled since the first of the year;
 the principals involved were not cashiered
 and retain their prominence as political
 bureau members of Castro's Communist
 Party.
 B.    In his speech on March 13 at Havana University,
 Castro hurled new insults at Peking and charged
 that the Chinese leaders,  in their old age,
 have confused Marxism-Leninism with fascism.
 The attack was essentially a reiteration of
 Castro's earlier statements and came exactly
 one year after his first criticism of China.
 1.   For the first time Castro has denounced
 President Eduardo Frei of Chile and his
 Christian Democratic Party.
 a.    He said that in Chile "the only way
 to win the revolutionary struggle
 will be by armed struggle," and he
 denounced Frei as a coward, a liar,
 and a reactionary.   Havana radio has
 begun beaming a special:'~propaganda
 program to Chile attacking Frei and
 his government.
 b.    The attacks reflect the same mili-
 tancy displayed at the January

 Tri-Continent Conference and indicate
 that Castro is losing interest in co-
 existence and compromise in the hemi-
 sphere.
 C.    The state of alert declared throughout Cuba
 on May 27 was ostensibly a Cuban reaction to
 US moves,  the most outstanding of which was
 the killing of a Cuban soldier by a sentry
 at the Guantanamo Naval Base on May 21.   In
 reality,  there are indications that Cuba in-
 tended to provoke an incident with the US in
 order to reinforce its "anti-imperialist"
 posture and to divert the attention of the
 people from current economic difficulties.
 1.   The soldier was shot and killed by the
 US sentry after penetrating the base per-
 imeter during a reconnaissance of a newly
 laid minefield.   Such penetrations of the
 base perimeter have continued--presumably
 at the direction of the Cuban Government.
 Any additional incidents will further
 heighten the already tense situation on
 the island and provide the Castro regime
 with additional "justification" to demand
 greater sacrifices of the people.

 2.   The alert also is probably intended to
 test the efficiency of the Cuban defen-
 sive system, provide realistic training
 for armed forces personnel, and flush out
 "counterrevolutionaries" unfortunate
 enough to misjudge the reasons for the
 alert.
 II. Despite Castro's deepening frustrations,  his po-
 sition in Cuba remains pre-eminent.
 A.   The large and efficient military and security
 forces under Raul Castro are strong and loyal
 to the regime.   We think they are more than
 adequate as a defense against insurrection
 or invasion--barring substantial US assistance.
 B.   The 55,000 members of the Cuban Communist Party
 are drawn from an elite core of Castro's most
 militant supporters.   They form the regime's
 inner bureaucracy.
 1.   Last October Castro announced the formation
 of a political bureau, a secretariat,  and
 five standing committees within a 100-man
 central committee.
 2.   The party controls provincial and local
 affairs, education and indoctrination,
 and the mass organizations.

 3.   About one fifth of the party members and
 two thirds of the central committee mem-
 bers are from the Cuban armed forces.
 C.      Factionalism in the regime appears to be at
 its lowest level since Castro came to power.
 1.   Nearly the entire top civilian and mili-
 tary leadership is included in the central
 committee.
 a.   About 20~prominent "old" Communists
 have gained added stature thrdttgh
 membership.
 b.   There are no adherents of the eco-
 nomic policies of Che Guevara on the
 central committee.
 D.    Despite these factors contributing to the re-
 gime's stability,  there is no doubt that the
 over-all political climate in Cuba has shifted
 somewhat in the past year.   An air of uncer-
 tainty is prevalent in Havana which--if not
 checked--could lead to further disenchantment.
 III.   Castro recognizes that he has no alternative to
 continued large-scale aid from the Soviet Union.
 As a result, he has continued to move closer to
 Moscow, and has cooled toward the Chinese.
