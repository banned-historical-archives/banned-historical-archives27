 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Egypt Carries On
 The nomination of acting president Anwar
 Sadat to replace Nasir appears to solve the im-
 mediate succession problem, but further shifts in
 the Egyptian hierarchy can be expected.
 Sadat's selection by the executive committee
 and the central committee of the Arab Socialist
 Union (ASU), Egypt's only legal political organi-
 zation, as well as his official nomination by the
 National Assembly on 7 October, virtually assures
 him the presidency. His name is to be submitted
 to a national referendum, tentatively set for 15
 October, but this should be a mere formality
 because government control of the election proc-
 ess in the past has been complete.
 As a member of Nasir's Revolutionary Com-
 mand Council after the 1952 revolution that over-
 threw King Farouk and because Nasir named him
 vice president in December 1969, Sadat brings an
 aura of legitimacy to his new position. He is
 apparently an extreme nationalist; in the past he
 has severely castigated both the UK and the US
 for their actions in the Middle East. Because he
 criticized Egypt's acceptance of the US peace
 initiative this summer, Sadat reportedly fell into
 disfavor with Nasir for several weeks.
 Sadat lacks Nasir's charisma and authority,
 and he probably owes his nomination as president
 to other influential Egyptian political figures such
 as Minister of the Interior Sharawi Jumah, Minis-
 ter of State Sami Sharaf, and War Minister Mu-
 hammad  Fawzi.  Rumors  circulating  in  Cairo
 allege that Jumah is eventually to be appointed
 head of the ASU and that former vice president
 Ali Sabri will be named prime minister. In any
 case, further changes in the line-up can be ex-
 pected over the next few months as the new
 leadership settles in.
 Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Mahmud Riad's
 outline of present Egyptian policy, delivered in a
 television interview on 6 October, indicates that
 Cairo is not likely to exhibit much flexibility in
 the near future. Riad denied that Egypt had vio-
 lated the cease-fire and said that Cairo "will not
 move a single missile back." Riad also stated that
 Egypt would not agree to a permanent cease-fire,
 but he did suggest that Cairo was willing to con-
 sider extending the present one for a specific
 period, possibly three months. This extension,
 however, would be agreed to only on the condi-
 tions that a serious effort be made toward a
 peaceful solution and that UN mediator Jarring
 continue his mission of implementing the UN
 Security Council resolutions of 1967 on the Mid-
 dle East.
 The Israelis probably will observe a cease-fire
 from their side as long as there is no renewal of
 Nasir's "war of attrition." Prime Minister Meir^25X1
 was in Israel's interest to
 cease-fire as long as pos-
 sible.  She  cautioned,
 however,  that Israel
 would have to re-exam-
 ine this stand if it had
 proof Egypt was prepar-
 ing to resume hostilities.

 ably  more provocation.
 Israel is almost certain to
 use the missile deploy-
 ment issue as a suitable
 excuse  not  to  resume
 peace talks, however.

 Moscow is probably satisfied with the selec-
 tion of Sadat as Nasir's successor, a choice sug-
 gesting a collective leadership inclined to continue
 Nasir's policies and offering some measure of sta-
 bility. Nevertheless, the Soviets will watch closely
 to detect any hint that the new leaders are devi-
 ating from  the strategy worked out between
 Moscow and Nasir. The appointment of Vladimir
 Vinogradov, a deputy foreign minister and Middle
 East specialist,  as  new  ambassador to Cairo
 further suggests that Moscow intends to keep
 itself well-informed while making its own voice
 heard in Egypt.
 Jordan: Uneasy Calm
 The cease-fire  has continued to hold in
 Jordan, and relative calm prevails.
 Nasir's death has created a degree of confu-
 sion and uncertainty among both the fedayeen
 and the Jordanians; each side will probably be
 hesitant to undertake any new moves against the
 other until the situation in Egypt becomes clearer
 and both sides are surer of where they stand.
 Neither wants to be the first to resume any large-
 scale fighting for fear of appearing clearly at fault
 in the eyes of other Arabs. Furthermore, the
 Jordanian Government and the fedayeen are still
 exhausted from the last round, and both would
 probably welcome a breathing spell.
 Most uniformed fedayeen have left Amman,
 apparently without incident, but the process of
 withdrawal  has extended  beyond the original
 deadline. Some militiamen have remained in the
 city, but they have either given up their weapons
 or have hidden them. US Embassy personnel have
 been able to drive unescorted through the city
 since 4 October; they have reported that the task
 of cleaning up is progressing apace and that water
 and electricity have been restored in some areas.
 dissatisfaction among a few Jordanian officials
 The north has remained quiet since 5 Octo-
 ber, when the guerrillas claimed they had clashed
 with the army. Some Jordanian authorities have
 apparently moved into Irbid and Ramtha, and are
 attempting to restore utilities and other services
 there. The fedayeen are pulling out, albeit slowly,
 ]nd some Palestine Liberation Army elements
 have been reported moving across the border into
 Syria.
 Although there is a general air of optimism
 in the government toward the cease-fire, King
 Husayn's patience with the fedayeen-despite the
 slow pace of their pull-out-has produced some
 The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)
 reported that 25 percent of the dwellings in the
 largest refugee camp in the Amman area have
 been damaged beyond repair. Although it does
 not believe the damage is as extensive in other
 camps, UNRWA estimates it will cost $2 million
 to  provide adequate shelter for the  refugees
 around Amman and another $1 million to replace
 schools and other installations.

 An indication that the Arabs are attempting
 to maintain a semblance of neutrality in the
 Jordan crisis came on 4 October when a plane
 carrying 43 guerrillas landed at Beirut airport.
 Lebanese authorities refused to allow these mem-
 bers of the Iraqi-backed Arab Liberation Front to
 enter Lebanon, saying that, under the terms of
 the 1969 agreement in Cairo between the Leb-
 anese Government and the Palestinian organiza-
 tions, Beirut airport is a civilian installation and is
 not to be used for fedayeen action. The Lebanese
 appealed to Arab ambassadors in Beirut to apply
 diplomatic pressure, and after several hours the
 plane departed for Baghdad.
 Did the Jordanian Army Really Win?
 The Jordanian Army employed about a third
 of its 58,000-man force during the hostilities in
 September. King Husayn chose not to use the
 other two thirds, mostly Palestinians, whose reli-
 ability in battle against the fedayeen was con-
 sidered uncertain. Although, the King's forces suf-
 fered only minimal losses in battling the Syrians
 to defeat and the fedayeen to a draw, the army
 nonetheless appears to have achieved only an in-
 conclusive military victory under special circum-
 stances.
 On 17 September Husayn moved his military
 forces against the fedayeen in Jordan. Three days
 later two Syrian armored brigades invaded north-
 ern Jordan for the ostensible purpose of "help-
 ing" the fedayeen. The Syrians probably hoped,
 however, that together with the fedayeen and the
 Iraqis they could gain possession of northwest
 Jordan, including Irbid, and even bring about the
 overthrow of the King.
 The Syrians, with about 250 tanks and ac-
 companying  artillery, took the northern Jor-
 Soviet party chief Brezhnev, speaking on 2
 October on the recent civil war in Jordan, made
 the toughest comments on the Middle East sit-
 uation by a Soviet leader in several months. He
 admonished his listeners that, in the event of a
 new "imperialist" intervention in the Middle East,
 "one could not only burn one's fingers, but-who
 knows-even lose an arm." He also warned that
 "any foreign intervention in the events in Jordan
 is absolutely inadmissible"a declaration seem-
 ingly aimed as much at Syria as at Israel and the
 US. Brezhnev decried the "fratricidal" conflict in
 Jordan, and claimed that it had "inflicted no
 small harm on the Arab cause."
 danian cities of Ramtha and Irbid on 20 and 21
 September after a one-day battle with Jordanian
 armored units. The Jordanian forces, employing
 artillery, some 75 tanks, and no more than six
 Hawker Hunter aircraft at any one time, repulsed
 Syrian attempts to move farther south and forced
 the Syrian troops to retreat to Dar'a. Almost half
 the Syrian tank force was disabled. Jordan lost
 only a small number of tanks, and two Hunter
 aircraft were damaged.
 Damascus apparently believed the Jordanian
 forces would be easily pushed aside by the Syrian
 armored units and that the fighting would be over
 quickly. The Jordanians, however, fought well,
 and equipment held up because of comparatively
 good maintenance. In contrast, the Syrian forces
 did not perform well and lost considerable equip-
 ment because of poor maintenance as well as in
 combat with the Jordanians. By 23 September
 Syria was faced with the alternatives of retreating
 or increasing its commitment. Damascus almost
 certainly decided against sending additional forces
 to Jordan in the belief that such action might lead

 to a protracted and costly war and to intervention

 The Jordanian Army units in the north de-
 feated a Syrian force more than twice their size.
 It is doubtful, however, that this would have been
 the outcome if Syria had introduced its air force
 into the battle.
 An additional advantage for the Jordanians
 in the hostilities during September resulted from
 the fact that the 20,000-man Iraqi force stationed
 Libya: A New Era?
 The marked success in recent oil negotia-
 tions, the juggling of the cabinet, and the death of
 Nasir all suggest that a new era lies ahead for
 Libya. Tripoli, however, must overcome its still-
 unresolved domestic problems and avoid rash in-
 volvement in foreign affairs. It must also bring
 order and direction to the volatile and erratic
 Revolutionary Command Council (RCC).
 The last month has seen real progress for
 Libya, even if it was marred by some naive adven-
 turism. The drawn-out wrangling with the oil
 companies met with great success; firms respon-
 sible torabout half of Libya's oil production have
 agreed to the government's terms, and the four
 major  companies  still  holding  out-two  US
 (Mobile and Esso) and two British-are almost
 certain ultimately to reach an agreement approxi-
 mating Libyan demands.
 In addition, the government has made cabi-
 net changes that appear designed to cope with the
 country's important problems. Deputy Premier
 Jallud, the key official in the oil talks, was ap-
 pointed minister for industry and economy, a
 posting  that  placed the problem of internal
 reform squarely on the RCC official most com-
 petent to handle it.
 in Jordan did not intervene. Although the Iraqis
 remained an uncertain menace to the Jordanian
 Army-because  of  repeated  threats  of  inter-
 vention from Baghdad-they did little more than
 patrol the roads in the Mafraq area.
 The Jordanian Army is now being resup-
 plied, primarily by the US. How effective it will
 be in future hostilities will depend, more than for
 most armies, on those special circumstances and
 advantages created by its neighbors.
 Nasir's death, on the other hand, has re-
 moved a steadying influence. There is now no one
 in the Arab world, especially among military
 chiefs off state, to whom the young officers of
 the RCC are apt to turn for leadership. The simi-
 larity, however, between the petroleum policies
 of Libya and Algeria has led some observers to
 speculate that, with success in the oil talks, Libya
 might now become increasingly attracted to a
 closer political relationship with an increasingly
 stable Algeria.
 Libya's fortunes, however, remain in the
 hands of the disunified and immature RCC. Dur-
 ing the Jordanian civil war, Libya rashly declared
 for the fedayeen,  rushed military aid to Da-
 mascus,                                                                                 and  broke  diplomatic relations with
 Jordan. Much of this fervor arose from Libya's
 failure to participate in the June 1967 war and
 the desire of its young leaders to side with what
 they considered the wave of the Arabs' political
 future. But their timing was poor, and little seems
 to have been achieved, for Libya or for the feda-
 yeen.
 The new cabinet shifts appear, for all prac-
 tical purposes, to have left Premier Qaddafi in
 control of foreign affairs. The RCC must seek to

 pervasive and the mini-state's ties with the West
 have been seriously eroded. Both trends stem
 directly from the mercurial President Macias' con-
 tinuing preoccupation with consolidating his posi-
 tion and protecting Guinea's sovereignty against
 largely imaginary threats.
 Macias' feelings of insecurity arise in large
 part from his fear that Spain, which did not
 support his candidacy in preindependence elec-
 tions, is trying to remove him. The seat of govern-
 ment, moreover, is situated on the economically
 more advanced island of Fernando Po, inhabited
 by the chief rivals of Macias' mainland Fang
 tribe-the separatist-minded Bubi and Fernando
 peoples-and a large population of Nigerian con-
 tract workers.
 To ensure his personal survival. Macias has
 brought government to a near halt while elimi-
 nating rivals and creating a one-party police state.
 The prevailing atmosphere underscores the ex-
 cesses of his ill-disciplined security forces and the
 frantic jockeying for favor by his confidants.
 Macias is now bent on filling all key posts with
 fellow Fangs and organizing his single party at the
 grass roots.
 Development remains at a standstill, while
 the economy stagnates and inflation worsens.
 I-tandouts extracted from local businessmen have
 with Western investment, and the death of Nasir
 has given the Libyans a chance to be their own
 bosses. It now remains for the leadership to seize
 this opportunity and to make a concerted effort
 to carry out the remaining promises of their revo-
 lution,
 made corruption a way of life. Islanders fear that
 their cocoa plantations, the source of most of the
 country's export revenues, will be nationalized.
 The Nigerian laborers face replacement by na-
 tives, and many discouraged foreign technicians
 and Spanish merchants are leaving.

 Macias, swayed by his anti-Spanish bias and
 by extremist advisers, has moved closer to radical
 African and Communist countries. Relations re-
 main severely strained with Spain, the country's
 main source of aid and investment, and Madrid is
 losing patience with repeated coup charges and
 other abuse. In fact, it has so far failed to under-
 write this year's large budget deficit. At present
 Macias appears to rely heavily on radical advisers
 from Guinea in the Foreign Ministry and has
 shown a preference for technical assistance of-
 fered by leftist African regimes. He has also estab-
 lished ties with the USSR and North Korea and
 has accepted modest help from both.
 The outlook is dim for any lasting improve-
 ment in relations with the West even though none
 of  the  Communist  countries seems eager to
 assume Spain's burden. Domestically, Macias has
 no organized opposition, and he is likely to re-
 main in office for some time, barring assassination
 or a palace coup by disenchanted cabinet cron-
 ies.                                      25X1
 CONGO (KINSHASA): Preparations are under

 since President Mobutu seized power in 1965. His
 official party, the Popular Revolutionary Move-

 will be the sole candidate in the presidential elec-

 leader Ojukwu was ordered this week to leave
 Ivory Coast, where he has been living since the
 Nigerian civil war ended last January. As of 8
 October, it was not known where he would re-
 locate. The expulsion follows a recent press in-
 terview in which Ojukwu made statements that
 Abidjan apparently considers a breach of his
 promise to refrain from all political activity while
 in Ivory Coast.
 There are some  indications that the in-
 terview--the first Ojukwu has  given  in  Ivory
 oast--was in fact arranged to provide Ivorian Presi-
 dent Houphouet-Boigny a pretext for getting rid
 of Ojukwu. His continued presence complicates
 current moves toward a full reconciliation be-
 tween Nigeria and Ivory Coast, one of the four
 African states that recognized Biafra. The rap-
 prochement between the two countries should
 now move ahead to an early re-establishment of
 diplomatic relations.                        25X1

 FAR EAST
 Laos:  The Going is Getting Tough
 Government forces are encountering heavier
 opposition throughout the country as they at-
 tempt to sustain limited offensive operations in
 the waning days of the rainy season. General
 Vang Pao's irregulars, still trying to improve the
 defenses of their Long Tieng base area before the
 anticipated enemy attacks this fall, have gained
 no new ground during the past week. Elements of
 the North Vietnamese 316th Division have turned
 back the latest attempts to seize Ban Na and have
 also thwarted a parallel government move toward
 Muong Pot. Failure to control these tactically
 important sites on the northern approaches to
 Long Tieng will complicate the government's de-
 fensive efforts during the dry season ahead.
 The operations southeast of the Plaine des
 Jarres initiated late last month to divert Commu-
 nist forces from the defense of Ban Na have not
 yet produced significant results. The base camp at
 Khang Kho continues to be harassed by small
 enemy units, and forays out of Khang Kho in
 search of Communist supply caches have turned
 up relatively little. A government battalion that
 has successfully completed a sweep to the north-
 east of Khang Kho ran into very few enemy
 troops.
 To the west of the Plaine, a 1,200-man gov-
 ernment force continues to be stymied in its
 effort  to  retake  the  former neutralist head-
 quarters at Muong Soui. Forward positions have
 been established less than a mile from the town's
 airstrip, but opposition from what is believed to
 be only a small enemy force has so far blocked
 the government's main units from advancing. On
 5 October, Communist defenders beat back an
 attempt by the irregulars to get into the town,
 killing the battalion commander, his deputy, and
 four company commanders.
 In the Laotian panhandle as well, the sub-
 stantial  government  forces  operating  in  the
 vicinity of Muong Phine and Toumlane are find-
 ing the going increasingly rough. For the past two
 weeks, two battalions of government irregulars
 have been frustrated in their efforts to cross a
 rain-swollen river about ten miles northwest of
 Muong Phine and have been under increasing pres-
 sure from small North Vietnamese units. Recently
 re-enforced by a third battalion, these govern-
 ment troops began to receive heavy mortar and
 rocket attacks on 6 October. For the first time
 since last winter, the enemy appears to be em-
 ploying 122-mm. rockets, which are playing a
 part in making the government's position in this
 area increasingly difficult. Intensive mortar fire
 has also been brought to bear on the three ir-
 regular battalions in the vicinity of Toumlane,
 and these units are preparing to withdraw.
 On the Bolovens plateau, North Vietnamese
 and Pathet Lao troops are maintaining the pres-
 sure on government outposts from which raids are
 made on enemy supply lines along Routes 23 and
 16. So far, however, they have been unable to
 dislodge the irregulars from Site 26, the recently
 recaptured base near Attopeu. Farther to the east
 along the Ho Chi Minh trail, elements of two
 government battalions are currently involved in
 mining and in otherwise harassing Communist
 logistic lines in the vicinity of Ban Bac and
 Chavane. Enemy reaction to these incursions has
 been scattered so far, but it is anticipated that the
 irregulars will be confronted with a major Com-
 munist clearing operation in the near future.  j

 Cambodia: ANewBeginning
 After a series of false starts and prolonged
 debate, the Cambodian Government is scheduled
 to proclaim itself a republic on 9 October.. ending
 many centuries of royal  rule. The change is
 largely symbolic, inasmuch as the throne has not
 been a powerful force for many years and has
 exercised almost no influence on the country's
 affairs since Sihanouk's ouster.
 l he excesses of Sihanouk and the royal
 family made the move toward a republic almost
 inevitable. Conditions in Cambodia were such
 that little or no thought was given to the possi-
 bility of retaining the throne as a symbol of the
 nation, as a unifying force, and as a source of
 legitimacy, much in the way that Thailand re-
 tained the monarchy after the 1932 revolution.
 For most influential or politically aware Cam-
 bodians, the monarchy was too closely associated
 with Sihanouk and with the anachronistic feudal-
 ism by which Cambodia was governed to allow
 any such compromise.
 The abolition of the monarchy signifies that
 Phnom Penh now is more confident of both its
 international  and  domestic  positions.  Earlier
 popular enthusiasm for the formation of a re-
 public was dampened by a number of key of-
 ficials, who argued successfully that such a change
 could  raise  painful  problems  of    diplomatic
 recognition  among countries whose initial ac-
 ceptance of the Lon No[ regime had been tepid,
 at best. They also urged that the peasants, many
 of whom retain a deep respect for the throne,
 have more time to absorb the shock of Sihanouk's
 fall before being confronted with yet another
 change.
 The birth of "la republique Khmere" should
 strengthen  Lon  Nol's position, particularly in
 Phnom Penh and other urban centers, and may
 also help refire any sagging revolutionary spirits.
 The rural reaction to the republic will be more
 difficult to gauge, but Communist organizational
 efforts among the peasantry probably will get a
 boost from Phnom Penh's move.
 Military Action Remains Light
 Government troops involved in the Kom-
 pong Thom relief operation have continued to
 indoctrinate villagers along Route 6, and have
 shown no signs of renewing their march north
 beyond Tang Kouk. Communist attacks on the
 task force increased, but were beaten off with the
 aid of air strikes.
 There have been indications, however, that
 even heavier enemy attacks against the column
 may be in the offing.
 In addition, large numbers of enemy troops
 have been spotted west of Route 6 for the first

 time.  Nonetheless, the Cambodian troops still
 outnumber the Communists, and their morale re-
 mains high.
 Northwest and southwest of Phnom Penh,
 the enemy sustained its pressures designed to
 disrupt government control over Routes 4 and 5
 by carrying out new harassing attacks along these
 vital roadways. More activity by the Communists
 also was reported in Battambang Province, and
 their capture of two villages within 15 miles of
 Battambang city prompted provincial officials in
 the area to take new precautionary steps to
 improve local defenses.
 Vietnam:  ThrustandParry
 Vietnamese Communist negotiators at the
 Paris talks on Thursday brushed aside President
 Nixon's  five-point  initiative  as a pre-election
 "gimmick" and an attempt to "legalize American
 aggression" and camouflage its "neo-colonialist"
 ambitions in  Indochina, but they characteris-
 tically                              stopped  short  of  outright  rejection.
 Madame Binh leveled her major attack on the
 proposition that a cease-fire should precede a
 political settlement. The Viet Cong, she recalled,
 have advocated that an accord on "basic issues"
 must come first and she charged that a reverse
 sequence robs her side of its "legitimate right of
 self-defense against aggression."
 A Polish diplomat seasoned in Vietnamese affairs
 said recently that the Communists now are more
 realistic than before about the situation in South
 Vietnam, including the balance of political forces.
 One of his colleagues claimed that Communist
 bargaining with the Thieu leadership is possible,
 Madame Binh's explicit disavowal of this course
 notwithstanding. A Swedish diplomat suggested
 that the way to break the impasse in Paris was
 through the troop withdrawal question on which,
 he asserted, the Communists will bend.
 Military Actions Unimpressive...
 The Communists obviously will have more
 to say in the weeks ahead; Madame Binh has
 already  promised  "detailed  comments  later."
 Coming only hours after the President's address,
 their initial reactions no doubt are meant to dull
 the impact of the US move while Hanoi sorts out
 the implications of Washington's latest propo-
 sition.
 The Communists are likely to continue tout-
 ing Madame Binh's own eight points. Despite
 their apparent firmness, some observers close to
 Hanoi profess to see flexibility in the Viet Cong
 proposal and are urging close American scrutiny.
 Peace pretensions aside, the Communists
 kicked off a new phase of harassing attacks early
 in the week, but the effort was lackluster and
 allied  casualties  appear  generally  light.  Most
 enemy shellings took place along the populated
 central coast. There also was a handful of signifi-
 cant enemy ground attacks and terrorist incidents
 at scattered points throughout the country. More
 sporadic action of this kind can be expected in
 coming weeks as the Communists try to maintain
 some momentum while generally conserving their
 forces in South Vietnam.
 Meanwhile, the Communists' effort to re-
 build their grass-roots apparatus continues  in

 many parts of the country. The South Vietnam-
 ese, abundantly aware of this enemy campaign,
 have called for countermeasures, but it is not
 clear how this clandestine struggle is going. It is
 evident, however, that although the enemy's local
 military forces and infrastructure have been weak-
 ened, they are still intact in many areas, and that
 the Communists retain a deeply entrenched base
 of popular support in some provinces.
 The Communists appear still to have their
 strongest  popular  support  in  old  Viet Minh
 strongholds such as Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh
 provinces along the central coast and Kien Hoa in
 the upper Mekong Delta. In these areas, govern-
 ment security forces often are reluctant to move
 against known Communists because of old family
 ties and fears of retaliation. The Quang Ngai Prov-
 ince chief, for example, recently reported that
 more than half the families in his province still
 have relatives serving in both government and
 Viet Cong organizations. In Kien Hoa, the prov-
 ince chief said that some 15 percent of the
 elected rural officials are Viet Cong sympathizers.
 In  both  provinces,  the  Phoenix Committees,
 which are supposed to oversee government opera-
 tions against the Viet Cong underground, are
 rated by US advisers as particularly ineffective.
 The government is doing better in some
 other parts of the country, however. In Da Lat,
 operations by South Vietnamese police and para-
 military forces during the summer led to the
 apprehension of nearly 40 Communist sappers,
 intelligence agents, and political cadre who had
 been operating in the city. Clandestine assets like
 these no doubt played an important role in the
 spectacular Communist raid that penetrated and
 heavily damaged Da Lat last spring. The South
 Vietnamese have conducted similar police work in
 and around other larger cities, such as Saigon and
 Da Nang.
 In the capital itself, the officer in charge of
 the city's defenses recently said that he was con-
 cerned that the Communists were being assisted
 in their local rebuilding by sympathetic village
 officials. If a cease-fire was arranged right now, he
 warned, the Communists would claim control
 over a considerable part of the capital military
 district. This account may be somewhat over-
 drawn;                              government
 security forces have made it difficult for the
 enemy to recruit, tax, and move about near the
 capital. It does illustrate the kind of struggle that
 is now going on in much of South Vietnam,
 however, as the conventional military war con-
 tinues in low key.
 Saigon Reforms Its Currency
 Money, not subversion, captured Saigon's at-
 tention last week- The government implemented a
 series of economic reform measures designed to
 contain inflation by curbing speculation by im-
 porters. There is to be a limited devaluation of
 the piaster, higher taxes on imports of luxury
 goods and agricultural materials, and removal of
 restrictions on import licensing. The official ex-
 change rate, which still applies to most imports,
 was not changed from the present 118 piasters
 per dollar, but a second rate of 275 piasters per
 dollar was established for purchases of piasters by
 American personnel in Vietnam. This rate also
 applies to exports and imports of luxury goods.
 To head off an adverse reaction to the meas-
 ure,                                                          the  government  also announced an  im-
 mediate pay raise for armed forces and civil serv-
 ice personnel and promised controls to prevent a
 rise in food prices. Nevertheless, some prices have
 gone up sharply, causing anger in some quarters.
 A number of Saigon political figures have asserted
 that the measure demonstrates South Vietnam's
 increased dependence on American aid, while
 others commented that it was inevitable and may
 be overdue. The government's ability to limit
 price increases over the next few months will
 probably determine whether it can avoid further
 political difficulties such as last fall's trouble over
 the austerii t  tax isue.

 Communist China: Frustration Amid Fanfare
 The regime's continued frustration over per-
 sistent domestic political problems was clearly
 visible last week in Peking's subdued approach to
 the celebrations of the 21st anniversary of Com-
 munist rule. Echoing some of last year's sober
 themes, the editorial marking the occasion called
 attention to the difficulties in getting an effective
 performance from China's local governing organs
 and projected no quickening in the tortuous proc-
 ess of reconstituting the shattered Chinese Com-
 munist Party apparatus. Chou En-lai and Lin Piao,
 in brief National Day speeches, mentioned that
 the fourth  five-year economic  plan is in the
 works, but they failed to convey any new policy
 guidelines or to give any further indication of
 when Peking will convene the long-delayed Na-
 tional  People's Congress. The conspicuous ab-
 sence of two politburo members at the rally in
 Peking as well as the regime's coverage of the
 event suggests that  behind-the-scenes political
 maneuvering may be inhibiting movement on
 some personnel issues to be settled at the con-
 gress.
 The failure of Hsieh Fu-chih, public security
 minister and boss of the Peking municipal govern-
 ment, to accompany the other top leaders who
 appeared with Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao offered
 further evidence that a major break in ranks has
 occurred within the ruling politburo. Hsieh has
 been out of public view since last March, and it
 now seems certain that he has become the first
 high-ranking purge victim since acting chief of
 staff Yang Ch'eng-wu fell in 1968. There is little
 evidence that would provide a plausible explana-
 tion for Hsieh's political demise; rumors did circu-
 late briefly in Peking immediately after his dis-
 appearance alleging that he had alienated some of
 his fellow politburo members by his handling of
 some issues left over from the Cultural Revolu-
 tion. The regime has been careful, however, not
 to reveal any shifts in the balance of forces within
 the  politburo  that  must  have resulted from
 Hsieh's f a l l . I n fact, overt signs of ferment at the
 top have been tenuous at best.
 Another notable absentee at  last week's
 celebrations was politburo standing committee
 member Ch'en Po-ta, Mao's long-time personal
 secretary and top party theoretician. Ch'en's close
 association with Mao makes it difficult to believe
 that he too has been victimized in some muted
 behind-the-scenes squabbling,  but he has now
 been out of sight for two months and the regime's
 reluctance to account for his absence is puzzling.
 Peking's insistence on publishing the names of
 those leaders who did attend the celebrations in
 alphabetical order rather than by rank appears
 deliberately  calculated  to  obscure the actual
 power relationships within the ruling elite and
 raises suspicions that some jockeying  is con-
 tinuing.
 Policy  and  personnel  strains revealed  in
 Peking's coverage of National Day also continue
 to affect performance at the lower echelons of
 government. The authoritative anniversary edi-
 torial strongly emphasized the need for more
 competent local leadership, implying that both
 high-ranking civilian and military administrators
 are often out of step with Peking's policies and
 are having difficulty reconciling "the thousand
 and one things they have to do." The extent of
 the regime's concern over such issues has been
 further evident in propaganda output in recent
 weeks. There have been complaints of infighting
 in  revolutionary  committees,  strained  civil-
 military relationships, deficiencies in the army's
 political  performance,  and  resistance  to the
 authority of the party committees that are only
 slowly being established at the local levels of
 administration.

 China:  Harvest Prospects Good
 Favorable weather and continuing new in-
 vestments in agriculture appear to be paying off
 in another year of good harvests. The regime's
 general satisfaction with the agricultural situation
 is reflected in national anniversary pronounce-
 ments, which boasted of an "excellent" harvest
 for 1970 while virtually ignoring all other eco-
 nomic matters.
 The claim also was made that there have
 been "good" harvests for the previous eight years,
 but this is not accurate. The 1960s began with a
 food crisis following the collapse of the Leap
 Forward and food supplies were barely sufficient
 during several years. Peking, however, did effect a
 steady improvement in food production by per-
 m itting  material  incentives  for  peasants  and
 making agriculture second only to weapons de-
 velopment in the allocation of resources. Not
 even the Cultural  Revolution was allowed to
 change these priorities.
 ficient to keep pace with population growth. Per
 capita caloric intake is still slightly below the level
 of the late 1950s before the Leap Forward, but
 there has been a compensating improvement in
 the quality of the diet, which now includes more
 fruit, vegetables, meat, and eggs, predominantly
 from private plots. The few food complaints in
 letters now sent abroad center on government
 attempts to siphon off increases in production
 with extra levies-often in the name of "war
 preparations."
 Little change is expected in Peking's pur-
 chase of foreign grain. Wheat imported in 1970,
 reflecting contracts concluded in 1969, will prob-
 ably amount to about 4.6 million tons. This com-
 pares with 4 million tons delivered last year and
 an average of about 4.5 million tons during earlier
 years.  Canada  and  Australia  continue to be
 China's main sources for wheat.
 The total grain harvest for 1970 will prob-
 ably be larger than for 1969, or substantially over
 200 million tons. Increased supplies of imported
 and domestic chemical fertilizers remain a major
 factor in boosting farm output.
 Over-all gains in food production during the
 past two or three years have probably been suf-
 With world wheat stocks at record levels,
 China is in a good bargaining position for its 1971
 imports.

 probably continue to be used to maintain present
 consumption levels in China's cities and to enlarge
 stockpiles.
 Fiji: New Nation in the South Seas
 Nationhood came late to the South Pacific,
 and few of the many island groups have any real
 chance of surviving as viable states. Three have
 already attained independence-Western Samoa,
 Nauru, and Tongo-and they are to be followed
 on 10 October by Fiji. After nearly a century of
 British rule, Fiji was reluctant to break away
 because of serious communal problems between
 the Fijians and the now more numerous Indians.
 Aside from this, however, the island nation faces
 a reasonably bright future.
 The Indians were originally brought in by
 the British as indentured cane-field laborers. Un-
 der British rule, political supremacy by the Fijians
 over the more aggressive Indians was assured by a
 complicated electoral system weighted in their
 favor. Similarly,  legal  strictures were enacted

 against the transfer of Fijian land, an arrangement
 that created a potentially explosive tenancy situa-
 tion. Indian sugar-cane farmers predominate, yet
 own only 2 percent of the land, and as tenancy
 contracts terminate, Fijian landlords are now in-
 clined not to renew.
 The Fijians were for years reluctant to ac-
 cept independence on terms that might weaken
 the safeguards against Indian domination. Con-
 versely, the Indians insisted on a one man - one
 vote system as the price for their agreement to
 independence. An interim solution establishing
 equal representation for the Fijian and Indian
 communities in the first House of Representatives
 to be elected after independence was reached last
 spring.  The more numerous Indians, however,
 have not abandoned their goal of a voting system
 that disregards ethnic orgin, and they can be
 expected to engage in political obstructionism
 should the Fijians stall in meeting this demand.
 Fiji's first prime minister, Ratu Sir Kamisese
 Mara,  head  of  the Fijian-dominated Alliance
 Party, comes to his post with experience and with
 high family position, important in the tribally
 oriented Fijian  society.  The Oxford-educated
 Mara gained experience as chief minister during
 the final three years of British rule that may ease
 the transition to independence. The opposition
 will come from the basically Indian National
 Federation Party, led by S. M. Koya, a lawyer
 The good
 working relationship that has developed between
 Mara and Koya, in sharp contrast with the Fijians'
 difficulties with  Koya's  abrasive  predecessor,
 which resulted in a near confrontation in 1968,
 holds promise for an amicable solution of the
 question of political representation. The inbred
 hostility between the Fijians and the Indians,
 however, suggests that relations between the two
 communities  will  remain  strained  and  oc-
 casionally volatile.
 Fijian leaders recognize their inexperience in
 foreign affairs and will initially limit the country's
 diplomatic contacts. They will probably rely on
 the good offices of New Zealand, which has also
 given unobtrusive assistance to Western Samoa
 and Tonga. Fiji will become a member of the
 Commonwealth of Nations and of the UN-Mara
 is scheduled to speak at the UN later in October----
 but does not now plan to open an embassy in
 Washington. Relations with the US are neverthe-
 less friendly, a pleasant holdover from World War
 II when a major US base was sited there. The
 current US presence consists of a consulate, a
 Peace Corps contingent, and a small US Air Force
 station.
 New Zealand, which has a strong interest in
 the stability of the islands to its north, will prob-
 ably take on some of the advisory responsibilities
 relinquished by the British and will continue to
 lend a brigadier to command Fiji's smai'I military
 force. Fiji is inclined to identify itself more with
 New Zealand than with Australia, whose size it
 finds  overwhelming  and  whose economic in-
 fluence in the islands has provoked resentment.
 Fiji's economy is based on sugar and tour-
 ism. Earnings from tourism, which now offset a
 chronic  trade  deficit,  show  promise  of  a
 continued sharp upturn and may in fact overtake
 sugar as the largest foreign-exchange earner, as
 expanded air service to the South Pacific attracts
 more visitors. There were some 85,000 of them
 last year, mostly Australians and New Zealanders.
 The social impact of tourism could add to Fiji's
 problems, however, and the Fijians have already
 expressed concern that their traditional way of
 life is being debased for the benefit of tour-

 SOUTH KOREA: The New Democrats, the coun-
 try's only  significant  opposition  party,  con-
 founded the government last week by nominating
 a credible candidate to run against President Pak
 Chong-hui next year. He is Kim Tae-chung, a
 respected National Assemblyman and a former
 leader of the now-defunct political party that was
 ousted from power by Pak in the 1961 military
 coup. His candidacy will appeal most strongly to
 those  reform-minded  minority  elements-stu-
 dents, intellectuals, and some members of the
 country's new middle class-that are most critical
 of government corruption and authoritarianism.
 --        ? ?
 President Pak is generally conceded to be a
 shoo-in next year, but a strong campaign by his
 opponent could cut into the government party's
 margin of victory in the National Assembly elec-
 tions that follow. The New Democrats hold only
 42 of the Assembly's 175 seats, compared with
 the government party's 112 seats. Government
 machinations to finance the nomination of a less
 able contender than Kim had threatened to split
 the opposition party and make a farce of the
 elections.                                      25X1
 EUROPE
 West Germany:  Follow-up on the Moscow Treaty
 While awaiting the results of the quadri-
 partite talks on Berlin, Bonn is following up its
 political treaty with the USSR by negotiating
 with Moscow in other fields. The West German
 ministers of economics and of science and educa-
 tion, Karl Schiller and Hans Leussink, each toured
 the Soviet Union in late September, discussing
 trade relations and technical-scientific coopera-
 tion with their Soviet hosts. Although neither side
 obtained all it wished from these visits, further
 contacts are planned for the months to come.
 Schiller and Soviet Foreign Trade Minister
 Patolichev agreed that, assuming the necessary
 authorization is granted by the European Com-
 munity, their governments would start talks in
 mid-November on a long-term trade and coopera-
 tion agreement. These negotiations may be held
 up, however, if the two sides fail to agree on some
 form of "Berlin clause" that would include West
 Berlin in the arrangements. Schiller suggested a
 new formula on this, but the reaction of the
 Soviets was apparently quite cool. Bonn has held
 out for such a clause since 1963 but Moscow has
 refused to agree.
 Schiller stressed, probably to the disappoint-
 ment of the Soviets, that the West German Gov-
 ernment is not in a position to provide credits at
 below-market interest rates; he argued, however,
 that high interest might be balanced by other
 considerations, such as delivery terms, quality,
 and price. Schiller only touched on the question
 of a deal between the Soviets and Daimler-Benz
 for the construction of a truck factory, because a
 Soviet delegation was negotiating simultaneously
 on this in Stuttgart. The Daimler-Benz talks have
 not yet reached a concrete stage, but both sides
 are making optimistic press statements.
 Leussink signed an agreement for the annual
 exchange of  16 scientists between the Soviet
 Academy of Sciences and the German Research
 Society,  which  represents West  German uni-
 versities and research institutions. Leussink tried
 to obtain an explicit reference to Berlin in the
 agreement, but the Soviets refused. The arrange-
 ments do provide for cooperation in 12 areas of
 science and technology, including data processing
 and some aspects of nuclear technology; the West
 Germans have told US officials that they are
 aware of the sensitivity of these areas and of their
 responsibility not to pass on strategic hardware. A
 first meeting of technical experts will take place
 in November, on high energy and plasma physics,
 and a second session, on physical chemistry, is

 scheduled  for  January.  Vladimir  Kirillin, the
 chairman of the Soviet Committee on Science and
 Technology, is to return Leussink's visit during
 the first half of 1971.
 In the realm of unofficial politics, Soviet
 political commentator Yuri Zhukov completed a
 lecture tour in West Germany in September, con-
 veying the message that, although the USSR
 recognizes cultural and economic ties between
 West Berlin and the Federal Republic, the idea of
 political ties is "a completely unrealistic matter."
 Contradicting Chancellor  Brandt's public posi-
 tion, he asserted strongly the Soviet argument
 that a Berlin solution is contingent on the ratifica-
 tion of the West German - Soviet treaty and said
 that  Brandt  had  agreed to this  in Moscow.
 Zhukov failed to realize one of the principal aims
 of his trip: organizing a West German - Soviet
 parliamentary  group.  This  foundered  on the
 USSR-Berlin: The Soviets have moved to quicken
 the pace of the Berlin negotiations. At the last
 four-power meeting on 30 September, Soviet
 Ambassador Abrasimov proposed that the date of
 the next formal session be moved up to 9 October
 and that it be preceded by a working-level meet-
 ing of political advisers. Even though Moscow is
 obviously eager to avoid being blamed for the
 lack of movement in the talks, progress on sub-
 stantive issues has not yet matched the procedural
 acceleration of the talks. The Soviets are still
 holding firm to their insistence that West Berlin
 must be accepted as an "independent political
 entity," although they have hinted vaguely at a
 willingness to bargain for something less.
 OSTPOLITIK: All indications point to the re-
 cently concluded sixth round of Polish - West
 German political talks in Bonn as the final nego-
 tiating session. Although a German spokesman
 said that significant textual problems are not yet
 resolved, their solution should come during the
 scheduled visit to Warsaw of West German For-
 eign Minister Scheel in early November. In the
 meantime, West German - Czechoslovak talks will
 begin in Prague on 12 October-a step considered
 preparatory  to  negotiations.  In  the  dialogue
 between East and West Germany, neither side
 appears eager at this moment to resume talks. The
 East Germans are using the present "pause for
 thought" to strengthen their position by seeking
 diplomatic  recognition  and  entry  into  inter-
 national organizations. They also began during
 the past week light harassment of West German
 traffic to and from Berlin, a clear reminder to
 Bonn and to the quadripartite conferees that the
 East Germans can ultimately control access to the
 city.

 Yugoslavia Plans Sweeping Changes
 President Tito's proposal on 21 September to
 create a collective presidency for Yugoslavia was
 apparently just the first of a number of proposed
 changes in the system of government. Speaking to
 the party presidium on 4 October, Edvard Kardelj,
 Tito's close adviser and probable political heir, gave
 his peers a glimpse of what lies ahead.
 According to Kardelj, Belgrade is faced with a
 number of basic problems that must be quickly
 overcome. These include a clear definition of the
 relationship between the Yugoslav federation and
 its constituent republics, as well as a delineation of
 the limits on the authority of the self-managing
 organizations on the one hand, and government
 executive and administrative bodies on the other.
 With an eye to the future, Kardelj also indicated
 Tito is thinking about altering the Yugoslav parlia-
 mentary system, the structure of self-management,
 and the role and position of the party and mass
 organizations, in order to assimilate them into the
 proposed new system of government.
 The new collective presidency would combine
 the functions of the president with some of the
 duties of the Federal Executive Council (currently
 responsible for executing the policies established by
 the Federal Assembly). As a result, the Council's
 responsibilities will  be trimmed down to well-
 defined administrative duties. Kardelj implied, as
 had Tito earlier, that the presidency will have the
 right to initiate certain laws without prior recourse
 to the Federal Assembly, but he was not specific as
 to their nature. The new presidency also will work
 directly with republic authorities in establishing a
 unified foreign policy and in matters affecting na-
 tional defense and security.
 The numerical composition of the presidency
 is still open to discussion, but Kardelj said that no
 matter its size, it will be based on equal representa-
 tion from all the republics. From among these
 representatives a president of Yugoslavia will be
 chosen for a short term (perhaps one year). The
 Page 19
 SECRET
 post of titular president will be rotated among the
 republic members of the presidency.
 Kardelj then dispelled speculation that Tito
 was stepping aside by noting that it is necessary to
 make a constitutional "exception" in the person of
 Tito, whose participation in the new body is very
 much needed. Tito's presence on the new body
 underscores his determination to set the wheels of
 succession in motion while he is still able to oversee
 and manage the process to avoid a crisis once he is
 gone.
 Changes on the magnitude outlined by Kardelj
 call for constituional revision, and are bound to
 infringe on the rights and privileges of those at-
 tached to the present system. With these individuals
 in mind, some of whom have already been critical
 of the new scheme, Kardelj denied what is appar-
 ently the basis of their criticism-that the new presi-
 dency would give a monopoly of power to a few.
 He said that there would be built-in checks on the
 new body.
 Kardelj's defensive comments may have been
 meant primarily for Slovenian ears. Speaking to the
 presidium, Slovenian party boss Franc Popit agreed
 with Kardelj's statement on the problems that exist,
 but said that there is no need to change the con-
 stitutional system. The following day, moreover, in
 reporting back to the central committee in Ljub-
 ljana, Popit supported the presidium's endorsement
 of the presidency, but without making any refer-
 ence to changes in the constitution. He further
 implied that nationalist tendencies in Slovenia must
 be subordinated to the interests of the federation as
 well as to the proposed creation of the collective
 presidency.
 The next discussion of the proposed new exec-
 utive body will come on 29-30 October when the
 first nationwide party conference will be convened
 in Belgrade.

 European Community Commissioner to Visit US
 Trade relations between the EC and the US
 will come under close scrutiny during two days of
 talks with EC Commissioner Rolf Dahrendorf in
 Washington on 15-16 October.
 The discussions come at a time of increasing
 malaise on both sides of the Atlantic over protect-
 ionist trends. They also coincide with the EC's
 enlargement  negotiations and rising European
 concern that the US may be reassessing the politi-
 cal advantages it has traditionally expected would
 flow  from greater European  integration. The
 Commission therefore hopes next week's talks
 will initiate a permanent dialogue, for-even apart
 from immediate and pressing trade problems-the
 Community's plan for monetary union and an
 industrial policy will require continuing US-EC
 consultations if friction is to be kept to a mini-
 mum.
 From the Community's point of view, the
 most urgent matter is pending US legislation that
 would restrict the import of textiles, shoes, and
 other goods, and Dahrendorf has been instructed
 to express the EC's grave concern. The Com-
 munity, however, is also trying to come up with
 proposals that might ease the US textile problem.
 the EC pres-
 ently is thinking ot retreating trom- its previous
 position which  would  have sought protection
 against Japanese textile exports diverted to Euro-
 pean markets?should Japan agree to limit textile
 exports to the US. The Community would hope
 in this way to encourage Tokyo to reach such an
 agreement with the US and also to gain time for
 the EC to develop a trade liberalization package.
 German efforts to encourage the develop-
 ment of a liberalization package to head off US
 protectionism so far have not borne fruit. Al-
 though a committee of Community trade officials
 has been charged with draftinq liberalization pro-
 posals, Paris may prove a stumbling block. The
 French  have  already  cautioned  Dahrendorf
 against "going too far" in his Washington talks,
 s:nd they were instrumental in postponing--at
 least until after he returns-a Council agreement
 in principle to renew talks in Geneva under GATT
 auspices between the US, the EC, UK, and Japan.
 Even the Germans, moreover, are wary of domes-
 tic opinion and hope that any suggestions for
 concessions on trade in agricultural and textile
 products can be attributed to the Commission.
 Agriculture is in fact prominent on the
 agenda  for the Washington talks. Agriculture
 Commissioner Mansholt is willing to consider con-
 cessions, but it seems doubtful the Commission
 will be able to go very far now, before it knows
 whether it can hold down Community price levels
 and begin instituting new measures to accelerate
 modernization of community farming.
 On the increasingly contentious issue of the
 EC's association and preferential trade agreements
 with nonmembers-which have recently taken a
 heavy drubbing in GATT--Dahrend orf will prob-
 ably again ask US "understanding" of the Corn-
 munity's special relationship with Africa and the
 Mediterranean. However, he may also offer to
 discuss specific US problems arising from some of
 the recently concluded arrangements.
 On the question of EC enlargement and how
 best to handle discussions with the US on this
 issue as the entry negotiations proceed, the Com-
 mission can be expected to be very sensitive.
 Although it recognizes that the US will have to
 look out for its trade interests in an expanded
 Community, it no doubt is nervous lest US con-
 cern complicate the entry talks. It may also fear
 that EC-US consultations could be taken by other
 affected countries as an invitation to become, in
 effect,   arties  to  the  enlargement  negotia
 tions.

 Brazil: Ship Purchases
 A Brazilian delegation led by the finance
 minister signed a contract in London last week
 for six frigates, according to press reports con-
 sidered substantially correct by US military group
 officers in Brazil. The package-reported to be
 priced at more than $240 million-is the largest
 sale of military equipment to a developing coun-
 try by Great Britain. The frigates will be of a new
 "Mark-10" design and will be armed with tor-
 pedoes and with "Seacat" sea-to-air missile sys-
 tems. In addition, four will be outfitted especially
 for combating submarines and will carry anti-
 submarine missile systems.
 Payment is to be made over eight years at
 5.5-percent interest; a British firm reportedly has
 agreed to finance 80 percent of the price. Four of
 the ships will be built in the UK by Vosper
 Thorneycroft and the other two will be built in
 Brazil with British technical assistance. Delivery
 of all is to be completed by 1979.

 Colombia: President Faces Congressional Opposition
 President  Pastrana's two-month period of
 grace may be ending. It is already clear that the
 administration's lack of a majority in either the
 Senate or the Chamber of Deputies will make the
 passage of government-sponsored legislation diffi-
 cult, and that the National Front, under whose
 auspices Pastrana was elected, needs support from
 other congressional blocs.  If too much of his
 legislation is blocked, however, he can adopt a
 traditional  method  used   by Colombian  presi-
 dents-rule by decree.
 The first real test carne on 30 September
 when the Chamber failed to elect a comptroller
 general of the republic. In the first ballot Antonio
 Ordonez, the candidate of defeated presidential-
 hopeful Rojas Pinilla's National Popular Alliance
 (ANAPO), received 115 votes and the official
 Liberal candidate, Alfredo Cadena, secured 89. In
 the second round, Ordonez received 116 votes
 and Cadena 91. Although the Chamber agreed to
 hold another vote on 21 October, it seems un-
 likely that either of these two candidates will be
 elected at that time because a two-thirds vote is
 required for election. Analysis of the 30 Septem-
 ber balloting indicates that ANAPO voted as a
 bloc and that the followers of defeated presiden-
 tial randidates Sourdis and Betancur split, with
 some National Front deputies also voting for the
 ANAPO candidate.

 Pastrana lacks three votes in 118-member Senate to achieve 50% plus one. In 21(1-member
 chamber he lacks 12 votes for 50% plus one.
 Pastrana's position is much stronger in cases
 where only a majority is required. Nevertheless,
 ANAPO partisans in the Chamber control three
 important committees dealing with foreign af-
 fairs, defense, education, public health, labor and
 social assistance-all areas of major interest to the
 Pastrana government. In the Senate, a complete
 breakdown is not available, but ANAPO controls
 at least two committees dealing with constitu-
 tional  reform and congressional relations, and
 with foreign affairs and defense.
 Pastrana's difficulties will not be limited to
 the National Congress. Of the 22 Departmental
 Assemblies, only six are under the control of the
 National Front. In Cundinamarca, the department
 in which Bogota is located, the assembly elected
 an Anapista as president, a Betancur follower as
 first vice president, and a Communist as second
 vice president- The other departmental assemblies
 appear to be under the control of various combi-
 nations of Anapistas and followers of Betancur
 and Sourdis. The 1968 constitutional reform re-
 moved many powers from the assemblies and
 made them administrative bodies. They still retain
 the power, however, to supervise the apportion-
 ment of the assembly budget and to appoint
 individuals to various positions, especially in the
 area of fiscal control.
 I he governors will be able to carry out their
 governmental functions, but the assemblies can
 make their tasks more difficult. The assemblies
 can be utilized as a base for political demogogy
 by the opposition and to attack the departmental
 and national government. Whether the alliances
 between the three groups will remain in effect on
 natters of substance is not clear, but it appears
 likely that appointee positions will be divided
 among them to the virtual exclusion of National
 Front supporters. The opposition groups stand to
 henefit by having their members appointed to
 positions within  the  governmental  structure,
 thereby strengthening their political power bases

 Chile:  Christian Democrats Will Support Allende
 Salvador Allende now is virtually certain to
 be confirmed as president in the congressional
 runoff on 24 October. After an acrimonious and
 divisive struggle, the national congress of the
 governing Christian Democrats (PDC) on 5 Octo-
 ber committed the party to support Allende, ask-
 ing only limited negotiations in return.
 The PDC's abandonment of its bargaining
 position amounts to capitulation to Allende by
 Chile's largest political party and the only possi-
 ble center of political opposition to him. The
 move has been hailed by spokesmen of Allende's
 Popular Unity (UP) coalition as a positive move
 and an explicit recognition of his victory-claims
 no one can dispute. The PDC representatives
 named to the negotiating committee with the UP
 are all advocates of accommodation with Allende
 and are unlikely to challenge the UP statement
 that the committee's jurisdiction is restricted en-
 tirely to points on which both sides agree.
 The outcome of the PDC congress has in-
 creased and deepened divisions, irreparably weak-
 ening the PDC. The Marxist press is crowing that
 the crucial 271-191 vote there signifies the vic-
 tory of defeated presidential candidate Radomiro
 Tomic over President Frei within the party. There
 are, however, several active "accommodationists"
 who consider Tomic discredited as a leader and
 see themselves as strong contenders for the role.
 President Frei's failure to give open support
 to the anti-Allende forces at the congress, despite
 his personal fear of a Marxist government, was a
 strong factor in their defeat. Some of the most
 courageous of this group represent the PDC grass-
 roots-labor, peasant, slum dweller, and women's
 organizations-and they are likely to pay dearly,
 both politically and personally, for their hard
 fight.
 Until the eve of the PDC congress, Allende's
 initial refusal to discuss the party's demands for
 democratic  guarantees  had  increased  pressure
 within the PDC against supporting him. The UP's

 Panama: Two Years o,' General Torri jos
 Sunday will mark the second anniversary of
 the "revolutionary" government dominated by
 General Omar Torrijos. The occasion will be
 celebrated with speeches magnifying past "suc-
 cesses" and renewing the regime's commitment to
 social reform and economic development. The
 government has few laurels to rest on, however.
 In the coming months, its attention is likely to
 focus on growing budgetary difficulties and the
 desire to readjust to its own advantage the treaty
 relationship with the US.
 F orrijos has managed to win a measure of
 popular support and is so little worried about
 dangers from the left that exiled Communist
 Party members reportedly now will be allowed to
 return home. Nevertheless, considering the plot-
 ting that has occurred within the Guard and
 within the oligarchy, and the continuing efforts
 of deposed President Arias and his supporters to
 regain power, the biggest accomplishment of the
 two-year-old regime is, indeed, that it is two years
 old. Although current plotting is given  little'
 chance of success, the threat of assassination still
 hangs over Torrijos, and tight political control is
 likely to continue. Press censorship remains in
 effect, political parties are not allowed to func-
 tion, and meaningful elections are far in the
 future.

 Bolivia: General Torres Wins Out
 General Juan Jose Torres declared himself
 President of Bolivia's "revolutionary government"
 on 7 October after dislodging the military junta
 that had replaced President Ovando only the day
 before. Torres' government will include civilians
 and military officials and is expected to take a
 sharp turn to the left.
 The rather confused series of events that led
 to Torres' assumption of power was initiated on 4
 October when a group of middle-level army of-
 ficers, led by army commander General Miranda,
 issued a demand for President Ovando's resigna-
 tion and an eventual return to constitutional gov-
 ernment. Ovando refused, and government and
 military officials loyal to him tried to isolate the
 Miranda-led rebels.
 Ovando retained the loyalty of the presi-
 dential guard in La Paz, the air force, and the elite
 paratroop units headquartered in Cochabamba-
 Bolivia's second largest city. Miranda, however,
 obtained  the  backing  of the more powerful
 armored units in La Paz and the majority of
 commands elsewhere in the country. Negotiations
 led to an agreement to abide by the vote of
 officers in the La Paz area on a resolution of the
 crisis, but Ovando then rejected the vote, which
 called  on both the President and Miranda to
 resign. Faced with the determination of those
 bent on his removal and the apparent superiority
 of Miranda's military strength, Ovando finally an-
 nounced his resignation on 6 October "to avoid
 bloodshed."

 manders of the three armed services and resigned

 same time, however, General Torres, a close sup-
 porter of Ovando, grouped those military units
 that had remained loyal to Ovando and from El
 Alto Air Force Base declared himself the new
 "revolutionary president." Torres obtained the
 support of extreme leftist leaders of labor and
 students, and following the bombing and strafing
 of government buildings in La Paz, the new junta
 began to crumble. The aerial attack caused little
 damage, but it apparently convinced some mem-
 bers of the new government that Torres would
 use further force if necessary.
 On 7 October General Torres marched tri-
 umphantly into La Paz and swore himself in as
 the new president. His victory, however, came not
 through obtaining the full support of the armed
 forces,  but rather through

 leftist leaders of labor, the universities, and sev-
 eral political parties including the pro-Moscow
 and pro-China Communists, and was presented
 with a list of 20 demands on which their con-
 tinued support apparently hinged. The demands
 reportedly included the removal of foreign mili-
 tary missions, the abrogation of the compensation
 agreement with the US-owned Gulf Company
 whose property had been expropriated last Octo-
 ber, the nationalization of foreign banks and the
 US-owned Matilde Mines, and the establishment
 of diplomatic relations with "all socialist coun-
 tries." On more-domestic  issues, the group de-
 manded amnesty for political prisoners, worker
 control of private industry, and the establishment
 of "workers' militias."
 Torres  demonstrated  ultranationalist  and
 leftist tendencies when he served as Ovando's
 armed forces commander. At that time he was
 reported to be the prime mover in the expropria-
 tion of Gulf. His final victory in the contest for
 power this week depended heavily on leftist labor
 and student support, and he is likely to accept at
 least some of their demands. In fact, Juan Lechin,

 PERU: President Velasco's speech on 3 October,

 to reviewing his major reforms and accomplish-

 on the "reactionary oligarchy," to which he con-
 signed those persons and newspapers that have
 been critical of his reforms. He made no specific
 mention  of the US, although Communist-led
 workers used the occasion to chant "Yankees out
 of Peru" and to display anti-US placards. The
 Communist labor confederation played a major
 role in organizing the celebration, and the Com-
 munists were probably taken aback when Velasco
 noted that they are supporting the revolution in
 the mistaken belief that it prepared Peru for an-
 other revolution in the future. He said that no
 other revolution is necessary, but that "now it is
 imperative to create the mechanisms and the in-
 stitutions that will make it possible to achieve
 popular participation upon permanent and con-
 structive bases." Another celebration will be held
 on 9 October-the anniversary of the expropria-

 Malawi: Pawn of White Southern Africa?
 My first duty is toward my own people. If, in order to look after my people, I
 have to deal with the devil, I will do so.
 President Hastings Banda
 Geographic location and economic imperatives have largely determined
 Malawi's relations with its neighbors in southern Africa. Impoverished and
 landlocked, Malawi is dependent on white-ruled Portuguese Mozambique for rail
 outlets to the Indian Ocean. Rhodesia and South Africa provide employment for
 Malawi's large surplus of manpower and are also important contributors of
 foreign exchange. Moreover, South Africa has become an increasingly significant
 source of development capital for projects that Malawi has been unable to
 finance elsewhere.
 President Banda's policy of open cooperation with the white states* has
 earned him the title "Odd Man Out" in Africa. Malawi is the only black African
 state that has official relations with South Africa, Portugal, and Rhodesia. The
 President's outspoken defense of his ties with these "racist regimes" has resulted
 in his isolation from other black African leaders and has strained Malawi's
 relations with most black states. Banda, however, sweeps aside all criticism,
 arguing that dialogue will bring about change where violent confrontation has
 failed.
 A politician of consummate skill, President
 Hastings Kamuzu Banda has a deceptively mild
 appearance that masks an explosive temper and a
 demagogic,  overbearing  manner.  He  enjoys
 enormous prestige within his country as the man
 who took the former  British dependency of
 Nyasaland out of the unpopular Federation of
 Rhodesia and Nyasaland and to independence as
 Malawi. Ironically, Banda at that time was con-
 sidered  a  strong  spokesman  for  African                            na-
 tionalism.     Dr.  Banda had led an unsuccessful
 campaign  in  London
 from 1951-53 to keep
 Nyasaland out     of  the
 proposed  federation,
 fearing  domination by
 Southern  Rhodesia.  I n
 July  1958,         Banda re-
 turned home to a tumul-
 tuous welcome and as-
 sumed the leadership of
 the  Nyasaland      inde-
 pendence movement.
 *The white-ruled governments of southern Africa include the Republic of South Africa, South-West Africa, Rhodesia,
 and the Portuguese African territories of Angola and Mozambique.

 Banda was named prime minister when the
 colony achieved internal self-government in 1963,
 and one year later he became president of the
 independent state of Malawi. Since independence,
 Banda has completely dominated Malawi, relying
 primarily on British expatriates to keep the civil
 service, army, and police effective and loyal.
 Through a mixture of paternalism and force,
 Banda maintains firm control of the government
 machinery and of the only legal political party; he
 makes all major and many minor decisions. Be-
 cause of this dominance he has unfettered author-
 ity to push ahead with Malawi's policy of co-
 operation  with  the  white  governments  of
 southern Africa. This policy has generated some
 opposition among the few educated Malawians,
 but Banda's forceful personality and authoritarian
 rule have deprived them of any significant role.
 Malawi's foreign policy toward the white
 redoubt reflects Banda's own philosophy on how
 to cope with the racial problems of southern
 Africa. He is convinced that his approach is more
 realistic than the strategy of "boycott, isolation,
 and  violent  confrontation" espoused-at  least
 verbally-by many black African states. While
 Banda opposes all forms of racial discrimination,
 he also believes that violence will only aggravate
 what he considers its root cause-the white man's
 fear of the black majority. Instead, Banda argues
 that through contacts and dialogue, black and
 white leaders can gradually develop respect for
 each other, thereby paving the way for peaceful
 and evolutionary change. He admits that eradica-
 tion of black-white hostilii:ies is an exceedingly
 difficult and distant objective and that his ap-
 proach may take several generations to achieve.
 Nevertheless, Banda is convinced that the alterna-
 tive black African solution, relying on the use of
 force, has even less chance of success.
 Malawi thus is the only African state that
 has full diplomatic relations with South Africa,
 consular relations with Portuguese Mozambique
 as well as a nonresident ambassador to Lisbon,
 and a government representative in Rhodesia.
 President Banda has welcomed these relations not
 Special Report
 only because of the economic benefits but also
 because of his wish to be a "bridge-builder" be-
 tween the races of Africa.
 Malawi's Economic and Geographic Imperatives
 In addition to his personal convictions, the
 pragmatic Banda realizes he must deal with white
 Africa because of Malawi's economic weakness.
 With few exploitable natural resources and with
 90 percent of its 4.5-million people engaged in
 agriculture, the country is one of the poorest and
 most densely populated states in Africa. Its man-
 power  surplus  is  manageable  only  because
 Rhodesia and South Africa annually employ ap-
 proximately 255,000 Malawians, nearly twice the
 number of Malawian wage earners at home
 Malawi also occupies a strategic position be-
 tween Zambia and Tanzania-the two most active
 supporters of African liberation movements-and
 white-ruled Mozambique. Should Malawi become
 a major infiltration route for African militants, it
 would complicate the insurgency problem for the
 Portuguese in Mozambique and in turn cause dif-
 ficulties for Rhodesia and South Africa. Con-
 versely, denial of the use of Malawian territory to
 the guerrillas would make it even more difficult
 for them to operate effectively. The white govern-
 ments accordingly have attempted to cultivate
 Malawi as a means of restraining it from granting
 black African insurgents a base of operations.
 South Africa: Moving Outward via Malawi
 South African Prime Minister Vorster's of-
 ficial visit to Malawi Iasi: May was a victory for
 Banda and a high point in relations between the
 two countries. President Banda touted the pres-
 ence of the apartheid leader as vindication of his
 policies and expressed the hope that it would
 result in even closer relations.
 As for South Africa, the state visit con-
 firmed Vorster's intention to proceed with his
 "outward policy" of establishing friendly rela-
 tions  with  neighboring  black  African  states.

 Although this policy has not yet gotten much
 beyond Malawi, Pretoria hopes it will eventually
 improve South Africa's image in the West, defuse
 black African hostility, and win acceptance of the
 status quo in white-ruled Africa.
 In addition to these political contacts, over
 the past three years there has been a significant
 increase in Malawi's economic ties with South
 Africa concurrently with a decline in assistance
 from the UK-still Malawi's main benefactor-and
 from other Western sources. The lack of com-
 petition from other Western nations and Banda's
 unswerving  opposition to accepting aid from
 Communist states have given South Africa the
 opportunity to fill the aid vacuum.
 President  Banda  has been especially ap-
 preciative of South African assistance for two of
 his pet goals. The first project, announced in
 1968, involved two loans totaling $15.4 million
 (Banda Reassures Vorster on Critics in South Africa)
 "Sonic of niy best friends are White!"
 Special Report
 President Banda and Prime Minister Vorster exchange views
 for rolling stock and construction of the Malawi
 portion of a rail link leading to the Mozambican
 seaport of Nacala. The same year, Banda also
 obtained an $11.2 million loan for construction
 of the first phase of a new national capital at
 Lilongwe. Both of these projects had been re-
 jected by traditional Western aid sources as un-
 necessary. The still largely uncompleted capital,
 which may cost more than $50 million to finish,
 may enable South Africa to increase its political
 leverage on Banda because Pretoria is the only
 likely source of additional aid. These projects will
 give Malawi few immediate economic returns, but
 Banda insists they are necessary for his country's
 long-range growth and its balanced development.
 Trade with South Africa will probably de-
 cline in the future, however. Malawi has doubled
 its imports from South Africa since signing a
 bilateral trade agreement in 1967 (to approxi-
 mately 15 percent of total imports in 1969), but
 the bulk of this increase is related to Pretoria's
 financial assistance and is therefore a temporary
 phenomenon.

 Portuguese Mozambique: Vital
 Economic Lifeline
 Good relations with Portuguese Mozambique
 are a matter of economic survival because all
 imports and exports are transported via the Beira
 and Nacala rail lines. Since independence, Banda
 has avoided doing anything that would provoke
 the Portuguese into closing these lines. Addi-
 tionally, he has forbidden nationalists of the
 Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO), who
 operate principally out of Tanzania, to stage
 armed raids into Mozambique from Malawi or
 even to transport arms through his country. As a
 result, FRELIMO has been forced to keep its
 armed activity in Malawi to a minimum, although
 the guerrillas often use remote border regions for
 refuge and staging bases. Because of these un-
 authorized  activities,  Blantyre  has  generally
 acquiesced to recurring but minor border viola-
 tions by Portuguese counterinsurgency patrols.
 As in the case of South Africa, Portuguese
 cooperation extends into several areas. In early
 1970, Lisbon agreed to its first major loan of $6
 million for a new highway. Portugal has also given
 Malawi two boats and has trained seamen for
 patrolling Lake Nyasa. Both regular and informal
 contacts are maintained by administrative, mili-
 tary, and security officials on both sides of the
 border. The interest of the Portuguese in support-
 ing Banda's continued rule became evident in
 1967, when they allegedly offered military as-
 sistance to help him defeat an abortive uprising.
 Rhodesia: Mecca for Malawian Labor
 Malawi's relations with Rhodesia are pri-
 marily economic. An estimated 155,000 Mala-
 wians are employed each year in Rhodesia, and
 the wages they bring home contribute a substan-
 tial amount of foreign exchange. In addition,
 Malawi has good trade connections with the Ian
 Smith  regime; in  1969, about 17 percent of
 Malawi's imports came from Rhodesia. Neverthe-
 less, Banda does not condone "sanction-busting"
 activities within his country, primarily because he
 does not want to aggravate his relations with the
 UK. The sanctions against Rhodesia have actually
 benefited  Malawi, by driving up the price of
 tobacco, its major cash crop.
 In the political field, Malawi has resisted
 Rhodesian overtures to establish diplomatic or
 consular relations, or alternatively to accept a
 resident Rhodesian representative. Malawi main-
 tains an official representative in Salisbury, how-
 ever, as a liaison between the Rhodesian Govern-
 ment and Malawian laborers.
 Malawi's open cooperation with its white
 neighbors has strained its relations with most
 other black African countries. Altho' gh nomi-
 nally remaining a member of the Organization of
 African Unity (OAU), Malawi's contacts with this
 organization and most of its member states have
 gradually lessened. Banda refuses to support the
 African Liberation Committee* of the OAU and
 since 1965 he has boycotted the annual OAU
 summit conferences by scheduling a  national
 party  convention  for  the  same  time. When
 Malawian delegations do attend OAU ministerial
 meetings, they usually abstain or express reserva-
 tions on southern African issues.
 Banda's public statements have been almost
 as big an obstacle to better relations with black
 Africa as his policies have been. Indeed, he some-
 times seems to take perverse pleasure in making
 sarcastic remarks about the "idle childish threats"
 of the OAU and in expressing his contempt for
 *The African Liberation Committee, set up in 1963 to channel funds to the liberation movements, has received little
 support from the black African states. In 1968-69 it received only some $0.6 million of its budget of $1.9 million,
 because only five states paid their full assessments, and 20 paid nothing at all.

 the idea that combined black African forces could
 prevail against South Africa and Rhodesia.
 Black African attitudes toward white south-
 ern Africa cover a broad spectrum and a number
 of states have come to share some of Banda's
 views.  Rulers  of  Ivory  Coast,  Gabon,  and
 Madagascar speak privately of South Africa as a
 possible source of aid and as a bulwark against the
 spread of Communism in Africa. Prime Minister
 Busia of Ghana has stated publicly that the dcor
 for dialogue with South Africa should be left
 open. These and other black states maintain un-
 publicized trade with southern Africa.
 Y,arnbia and Tanzania: Banda's Militant Neighbors
 Malawi's policies have been criticized most
 severely by neighboring Zambia and Tanzania.
 Blantyre has never had diplomatic relations with
 Dar es Salaam and only recently established them
 with Lusaka. Both Zambian President Kaunda
 and Tanzanian President Nyerere bitterly resent
 Banda's embrace of the white redoubt. They have
 sharply criticized him for refusing to assist in tie
 liberation struggle, for going far beyond what is
 necessary for economic survival, for grossly over-
 estimating  his ability to  influence the white
 regimes, and for giving verbal support to black
 Africa's enemies.
 Since 1964 when several dissident ministers
 fled Malawi for Tanzania and Zambia, Banda has
 suspected both governments of giving support as
 well as refuge to his opponents. Both govern-
 ments did in fact grant Malawian dissidents po-
 litical asylum, and Tanzania also supplied them
 with limited arms and training from 1964-67.
 Although neither country now gives the dissidents
 any assistance, Banda remains suspicious, espe-
 cially of Tanzania.
 In 1969, however, Malawi initiated the latest
 of several attempts to improve relations with its
 black neighbors. Bilateral negotiations were he d
 with Tanzania in May and July, the occasion for
 the latter's first ministerial-level visit to Malawi
 Special Report
 since 1964. Although little progress was made at
 the talks, both countries agreed to refrain from
 publicly attacking each other. In an unusual ad-
 dress the following September, Banda emphasized
 his desire to improve relations with neighboring
 black states. Shortly thereafter, he attempted to
 demonstrate his "bridge-building" role by inter-
 ceding with the Portuguese for the release of
 several Zambians held prisoner in Mozambique.
 The South African prime minister's visit last
 May seems to have offered only a temporary
 setback to Malawi's efforts to establish better
 relations with its black African neighbors. The
 government-controlled  press  in  Zambia  and
 Tanzania once again took up the cudgels, pointing
 to Vorster's visit as further proof of Banda's col-
 laboration with the white regimes, but it soon
 lapsed  into  silence.  And in  mid-September,
 Zambia and Malawi finally established diplomatic
 relations.
 As long as President Banda remains on the
 scene,  Malawi will almost certainly follow its
 present policies. Banda will continue to argue that
 dialogue and contacts with the white governments
 are the most realistic means of eradicating racial
 discrimination in southern Africa, and that the
 insurgent movements are doomed to remain inef-
 fective for the foreseeable future. Blantyre will
 probably maintain its present level of relations
 with Rhodesia and Mozambique. Relations with
 South Africa may expand, at least over the short
 run, in view of Pretoria's willingness to fund
 Banda's costly new capital. Nevertheless, this is
 unlikely to undercut seriously Malawi's freedom
 of action, and Banda in the final analysis will
 continue to be his own man.
 Banda will also continue his efforts to im-
 prove relations with other black African states.
 Barring a modification of the white governments'
 racial policies or of black Africa's animosity to-
 ward the white regimes, however, his aspiration to
 an international role as the "bridge-builder of
 Africa" seems likely to remain only a dream.

 The future of Malawi's foreign policy largely
 depends on the continuing leadership of Banda
 himself, however. The able President is at least 64
 and may be several years older. The next genera-
 tion of Malawian leadership will probably be
 more in tune with black Africa and less zealous in
 maintaining  ties  with  the  white  states.  Par-

 ticularly, Malawi's considerable reliance on South
 Africa for economic and technical assistance
 might be sharply reduced after Banda departs.
 Nevertheless, any future Malawian government
 will face the same limitations and realities that are
 now imposed on it by geography and economic
 necessity.
