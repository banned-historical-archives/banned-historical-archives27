 THE TRANSFORMATION OF NATURE IN CHINA
 SUMMARY
 Agriculture is a critical element in China's present
 and future.  A key question -- and problem -- is the
 ability of the, People's Republic of China (PRC) to in-
 crease agricultural output sufficiently to keep pace with
 the annual rate of population increase.  The answer is
 complex, but an important factor is China's progress in
 the protection, improvement, and management of its land
 resources.  Maximum benefits must be realized from
 increased use of chemical fertilizers, larger supplies
 and improved distribution of water for irrigation, new
 crop varieties, and other technological advances.  Although
 the PRC's land area of 3.7 million square miles is exceeded
 only by the USSR and Canada, its agricultural land resources
 are subject to major limitations.  Specifically:
 The amount of cultivated land is virtually
 static; a number of reasons, mostly physical,
 suggest that this will continue to be true for
 the foreseeable future.
 Much 'land now cultivated is of average to
 low productivity.

 Climatic conditions, particularly in North
 China, are highly variable, specifically in the
 amount, distribution, and intensity of rainfall,
 with resultant serious effects upon agricultural
 output.
 A sizable proportion of the land now tilled
 is subject to yearly damage from drought, flooding,
 erosion, and waterlogging.
 Environmental improvements were implicit in the major
 river basin and other water conservancy programs begun in
 the early years of PRC rule.  Additionally, China's rural
 labor was mobilized periodically to engage in local compaigns
 of ditch digging, tree planting, and a host of other activities
 designed to improve agricultural conditions through the up-
 grading of environmental resources.                                Peking characterized
 these menial tasks as an opportunity to "remake nature" and
 to put an end 'to natural calamities.  Nature, or the
 physical environment, was labeled an "enemy" that caused
 drought, floods, privation, and famine.
 Mastery of nature has not been an easy task, even to

 Water impoundments, canals, and related
 water control and storage facilities have been
 built by the millions, though most are small
 and many inadequate for intended needs.
 The Huang Ho (Yellow River) project, the
 most widely publicized and largest in scope of
 the river basin projects, has been scaled back
 drastically and altered -- principally because
 of the lack of effective anti-erosion work.
 Some improvements in the Huai and Hai basins
 apparently have been made; serious flooding is
 less likely and damage from waterlogging probably
 reduced.
 Millions of young saplings have been planted,
 but results in terms of original goals have been
 a patchwork of success and failure.
 The PRC has not claimed complete victory in its battles
 with nature, but some improvements in the overall picture
 are undeniable.  That more has not been accomplished and
 initial goals have not been reached is due not to a lack of
 incentive or official dedication to the tasks at hand, but
 rather to the reliance upon mass labor, lack of technically
 trained personnel, failure to coordinate related projects,
 overall managerial weaknesses, and the immensity of the
 problem.

 The Good Earth?
 1.  The amount of cultivated land in China is
 relatively small -- approximately 11 percent of the
 total area -- and no sizable tracts of good agricultural
 land remain unused.  The physical constraints that account
 for this situation can be summarized simply but aptly:
 most of China is too steep, too high, too cold, or too
 dry to support intensive, Chinese-style agriculture.
 2.  Hills, mountains, and high plateaus comprise
 more than two-thirds of the Chinese landscape -- land-
 forms ill-suited to intensive, Chinese agricultural
 practices (Map A).

 Much of China is at comparatively hitch elevations: about
 one-third of the land is above 6,600 feet and two-thirds
 exceeds 3,300 feet.  The lower summer temperatures,
 shortened growing season, and steep slopes usually found
 at these hioher elevations combine to preclude much agri-
 culture (Map B).  Nevertheless, the pressure for additional
 agricultural land has been so severe in China that sizable
 upland areas have been painstakingly and laboriously
 terraced to obtain additional fragments of agricultural
 land.
 3.  Nearly half of China receives so little rainfall
 (15 inches or less annually) that crops cannot be grown

 unless under full irrigation (Map C).  Areas of deficient

 ern China, but they contain overall only about 4 percent
 of C H na's total cultivated acreage.  Although additional
 supplies of underground water probably can be tapped, no
 major areas of cultivated land are foreseen being developed
 there.
 4.  Of greater agricultural importance is the seasonal
 amount, variability, and intensity of rainfall in the major
 grain producing provinces.  In North and Northeast China,
 where annual precipitation averages only 25 inches (about
 the same as central Kansas), 60 to 75 percent of this total

 is concentrated in only 3 summer months.* This concentration
 in so short a period poses an annual threat that meager spring
 and early summer rains will stunt the growth of spring-sown
 crops or that too much summer rain in too short a period will
 damage crops by local flooding and erosion.
 5.  The variability of rainfall also is a crucial factor
 in the major grain growing areas (Map D).  The most serious
 In Kansas only about half the yearly rainfall is recorded

 conditions exist in North C,ii na , where annual variability
 (departure from normal rainfall) ranges from 20 to 30 per-

 yields are considered unstable when departures from normal

 especially critical and is extremely high on the North China

 immense in North China:  I;' ai -feng has received as much as
 19.5 inches of rain in July and as little as 1.6 inches,
 and at Tientsin the range is from 15 inches to 1.6 inches.
 Finally, how much rainfall occurs during any one "rain" is
 another significant indicator of agricultural stability;
 here again, Ncrth China is frequently subject to brief
 gully-washing rains that cause flooding and erosion and
 damage water control works.  Many of the weather stations
 in North China, for example, have recorded as mach as 9 to
 10 i nc'ies of rain during a single 24-hour period.*
 6. Not only is most of China's land poorly suited
 for agriculture because of terrain and climatic factors,
 but even the presently cultivated area possesses inherent
 physical liabilities.  Only an estimated 31 percent of
 China's cultivated land is classified by PRC officials as
 "fertile," and of the remainder, 40 percent is "ordinary"
 and 29 percent "low-yielding."  Although the precise
 meaning of these terms is unclear, they at least suggest
 the shortage of good land and the predominance of ordi nary
 and relatively poor agricultural land.  The Chinese also
 have been explicit in stating that sizable percentages of
 their cropped land are subject to a variety of environmental
 hazards, all of which threaten yearly crop output and over-
 all economic stability.  Again, evaluation of these assertions
 is difficult, but they do emphasize the necessity for the
 careful management and control of China's physical resources.

 averages about the same number of days of recorded rainfall
 but its total for the month is only 4.Z5 inches.

 7.  Harmony between man and nature was a basi c
 philosophy of ancient China, originating in Chinese
 folklore with elaborations from those philosophical-
 ethical precepts of Taoisi,i and huddhism that were
 assimilated into Chinese culture.  Practical observations
 of what happened when man tampered with his environwent
 undoubtedly helped strengthen these philosophical under-
 pinnings, as suggested by the following armorial of
 Ch'eng Hao to Emperor Shen-tsung, ca. A.D. 1075, which
 stated:
 It is not merely that the natu re
 of things has been violated, but
 that the mountains from which
 forests and woods grow have all
 been laid bare by indiscriminate
 cutting and burning.  As these
 depredations still go uncurbed,
 the fish of the stream and the
 beasts of the field are cut
 short in their abundance and
 the things of nature are be-
 coming wasted and exhausted.
 What can be done about it?
 8.       The belief that China had achieved a harmonious
 relationship with the earth reinforced the belief of 18th
 century Western humanists in the superiority of Oriental
 culture in general and Chinese culture specifically.
 Chinese philosophical views toward nature were contrasted
 to those of Western man, conditioned by his Judeo-Christian
 heritage: man is created in God's image, he has been given
 dominion over the earth, and he shall subdue nature so that
 progress will continue and a better tomorrow he realized.
 9.  In spite of official injunctions against actions
 "contrary to nature," the Chinese in the course of more
 than three millennia of intensive occupance of their land
 probably altered their environment to a greater extent than
 has any other civilization.  This record is impressive
 whether measured by the changed appearance of the Chinese

 landscape or by the immense physical labor involved and
 the massive amounts of earth materials removed and re-
 shaped.                    The North China Plain, for example, has been
 under intensive cultivation for so long that its "natural"
 vegetation still is a subject of scholarly debate.  Some
 2,000 years ago almost a';1 of the lower Yangtze Valley
 was chokeu with thick forests and extensive swamps; several
 centuries of clearing and drainage work were necessary
 before the regulated, almost geometrical landscape of
 the present day c!nerged.  Although continued tillage and
 expansion of cultivated land produced an often dramatic
 physical modification, the process itself was viewed as
 part of a never-ending cycle of life.  The constant working
 and re?oork i ng of the soil, with continual return to the
 earth of its products in the form of compost and fertilizer,
 renewed the soil's abilit+,' to produce again sustenance for
 mankind.
 10.  Man thus was a much more active participant in
 altering the physical landscape of China than Western
 humanists realized.  The Chinese recognized that environ-
 mental mastery was not only a legacy of their legendary
 founders but also a necessity.  The manipulation and
 management of the environment were viewed, however, not as
 subjugation of nature but rather as cooperation with and
 adjustment to natural conditions.
 11.  A significant change in man-land relationships
 became apparent by the mid-19th century.  The physical
 resources upon which agriculture depended had been stretched
 to the breaking point, and, increasingly, erosion and
 flooding damaged cropland, famine became more common, and
 the general standard of living of the peasantry declined
 markedly.*  Much of this breakdown can be traced directly
 or indirectly to the rapid increase in population that had
 taken place since the beginning of the 18th century --
 from about 150 million to perhaps 430 million by 1850.
 Other factors such as bureaucratic corruption cntd
 inefficiency, military ineffectiveness, the impact of
 the Western nations, and fiscal problems also played
 important roles.

 Although increased agricultural productivity was recorded

 vide sufficient food for tho. rapidly cirow'inq population.
 Most of this new land was in South China, where sett.l ers

 corn and sweet potatoes.*  But careless tilling of the
 uplands speeded erosion, which in turn led to more frequent
 and serious -fl ood i ng in the valleys and plains, as indicated
 by a contemporary 19th century source:
 Formerly the bed of the Hsiang River
 [a tributary of the Han River located
 in south.:estern Honan and northern
 Hupeh] was several tens of feet deep.
 Ever since the systematic deforesta-
 tion consequent upon maize growing,
 the topsoil has been washed down by
 torrential rains     . .  The further
 upstream one goes, the shallower the
 ri""er bed becomes.  Small wonder that
 from 1821 to the present [ca.1838]
 there has hardly been a year in which
 the Hsiang River did not flood.
 12. Pessimism permeated the reports of both Western
 and Chinese earth scientists who in the 1912-1949 period
 investigated the status of China's physical resources and
 probl ems .  The more striking and serious problems were in
 North China.  Although locally some progress had been made
 to combat erosion through contour plowing of slope lands
 and the construction of terraces, erosion was so widespread
 and so little ground cover remained that improvement seemed

 impossible without major capital-intensive projects under
 governmenL auspices .  In contrast, management of land re-
 sources in the lowlands of South China was more successful
 principally because rice -- the dominant crop -- required
 the leveling and diking of small parcels of land and a
 carefully regulated flow of water into the fields (Figure 1).
 Consequently, irrigated rice farming produced an agricultural
 system that maximized the use of available land resources
 and minimized damage to them.  Reckless use of nearby unland
 fields continued, however, and erosion often was so rapid
 that some land had to be abandoned because of exhausted soil
 fertility after no more than two or three seasons of culti-
 vation.                   By the end of Manchu rule in 1911 and the opening
 of China to wide-scale modernization, damage to the
 environment had so worsened that traditional methods cf
 combating these problems no longer were effective.  The
 lack of technical knowledge of how best to combat environ-
 mental difficulties remained a serious drawback, and the
 lack of a truly effective national government prevented
 the introduction of enough technical advisors and sufficient
 capital to initiate large-scale land and water conservancy
 programs.

 13.     Since 1949 China's millions have been enjoined to
 "conquer" and "transform" nature, to "harness" the deserts,
 and in other ways to alter the physical environment for the
 benefit of man.  Chairman Mao, the oft-cited source and in-
 spiration for these admonitions, over the years has issued
 a series of exhortations demanding fulfillment of a variety

 of environment-related tasks.  Recently, the "changing
 nature" theme has reappeared in the Chinese press, which
 features articles centered around Mao's instructions, in-
 dicati ng progress made and work currently underway.
 14.  The view of nature as an "enemy" and the
 glorification of man as an instrument of change contrasts
 with traditional Chinese views of adjustment to and
 harmony with nature.  The aggressive tone of the PRC
 leaders' rhetoric is in keeping with Marxist-Maoist views
 that conflict, contrail-i ;Jon, and the struggle are the
 proper condition of society and, indeed, its most i im-
 portant dynamic.  The emphasis in Chinese tr.,atment of
 its environmental problems has been on what man can do,
 under the guidance of the Party, to initiate change and
 bring about improvement.
 15.  Major Chinese efforts have focused on water
 conservancy and protective afforestation, including both
 large-scale state-directed and -financed projects and a
 host of local works involving little investment but
 massive amounts of rural labor.  During the early years
 of economic rehabilitation (1949-52), emphasis was on
 repair of dikes, irrigation canals, locks, and similar
 facilities.  Additionally, work commenced almost im-
 mediately on two major flood control projects, the Huai
 River and the Ching -- the latter name applied to that
 portion of the middle Yangtze River down to southern
 Hupeh.*  Later, when the First Five-Year Plan (1953-57)
 was announced, a modest amount of state investment was
 allocated to initiate major, long-term programs designed
 to control the perennially unruly rivers of North China --
 the Huang, the Huai , and the Hai (Map F) .
 The Ching project involved the construction of dikes
 and sluice gates to provide a flood retention basin for
 the Yangtze south of Sha-shih.

 16.  More specific plans relating to protection and
 improvement of the physical environment were incorporated
 in the Twelve-Year Plan (1956-67) of the National Agri-
 cultural Development Program, adopted in 1958.                                                                                                                                               These
 included such basics as increased development of water
 conservancy works, irrigation, and flood and drought
 control projects, with emphasis upon small and medium-
 sized projects, soil improvement, extension of soil and
 water conservation practices, promotion of afforestation,
 and expansion of the network of meteorological and
 hydrological stations.  Use of the commune and its
 organizational structure to mobilize the rural masses
 was the principal means specified to implement the
 objectives of the Plan.
 17.  Planning and work on some early projects was
 hampered by an inadequate data base and the lack of
 scientifically trained personnel.  Tc remedy the situation
 China's scientists undertook, with some Soviet help, a
 series of major surveys designed to inventory, describe,

 specific problems.  Priority was given to studies of the
 loess areas of the middle Huang Ho (Yellow River) basin
 and the extensive arid areas of western China.  By the
 late 1950's the results of some of these efforts were
 beginning to be published in the form of major monographs
 and articles in technical and professional journals.
 More specific technical material undouhtedly was forwarded
 to appropriate ministries in Peking for use in particular
 projects.
 Controlling the Huang Ho
 If you zazit till the Huang 11o i
 clear, hots old will you be?
 --Chinese Proverb
 18.         Matteo Ricci, the pioneer Jesuit missionary
 to China in the late 16th century, remarked that:  "The
 Yellow River has no respect at all for Chinese law and
 order.  It comes from a barbarous region and    . fre-
 quently ravages whole districts of the realm, silting
 them up with sand, and changing its course at will ."
 Though news to Europeans, Father Ricci 's description and
 characterization of the river merely reiterated what the
 Chinese had know-,n since earliest times:  control of the
 turbulent Huang Ho was the most persistent and serious
 environmental problem in all of China.
 19.  The PRC leadership placed a high priority on
 a plan to permanently control the Huang, eliminating its
 periodic floods and erratic changes in course and at the
 same time more fully utilizing the river both for power
 generation and as a source of irrigation water.  Ac-
 cordingly, in 1955 the "Report on the Multi-Purpose Plan
 for the Permanent Control of the Yellow River and
 Exploitation of Its Water Resources" was presented to the
 National People's Congress.  The plan, ambitious in concept
 and massive in scope, was based upon earlier studies and
 recommendations, plus post-1949 investigations.  It called

 for construction of a series of multi-purnose dams desi 'ned
 for flood control , power generati on, irrigation , and navi
 gati on purposes .  The most t~ubl i ci zed project was the
 building of a giant hydroelectric dam at San-men (Three
 Gates), a point on the Huang upstream a few miles from
 where the river and its volley widen before emerging on
 the North China Plain (Hap F) .  Smaller dams were planned
 upstream from San-men, including two on the upper Huang
 near Lan-chou, plus a series of reservoirs on principal
 tributaries.  But the key to success was, in the words of
 the plan, the necessity    . . to develop at the same time
 large-scale water and soil conservation works in Kansu,
 Shensi, and Shansi Provinces and other loess regions."
 Numerous soil and water conservancy targets were spelled
 out in the plan (Figure 2).
 20.  It probably was inevitable that the massive
 physical changes required to reduce soil erosion did not
 in fact occur to any significant degree, given the short
 time schedule for construction of the San-men project
 (1957-61), the inmense size of the soil and water conser-
 vancy tasks (only 5 percent of the loess area was covered
 by trees), and the dizzying rural organizational changes
 of the period.  The San-men Dam was essentially completed
 in 1961 and a mamnoth reservoir was to have been filled,
 taking several hundred thousand hectares of cropland out
 of production (Figure 3).  But it was soon discovered that
 the silt load of the river had not been measurably reduced:
 by 1963 the penstocks were: clogged with mud.  Since then
 the gates have remained open and the Huang Ho continues as
 before -- transporting its heavy burden of silt seaward.
 21.  Mention of the Huang Flo project, and particularly
 of San-mein Dam, virtually ceased in the PRC press after 1961.
 In late 1963 and continuing until the advent of the Cultural
 Revolution in 1966, an occasional article appeared on proper
 techniques to reduce erosion and soil and water losses in
 the middle Huang Valley.  Only recently have press items
 reappeared commenting on the overall problem of the Huang.
 Progress is related in general terms, usually tied to one
 or more of Chairman Mao's statements, but specific references
 are to small-scale local achievements rather than a review of
 accomplishments throughout the Huang Ho basin.  No mention,
 for example, is made of the 1955 plan nor of the great mass
 of concrete at San-men.

 22.  It is clear that Chinese planners grievously
 underestimated the importance of systematic, long term
 soil and water conservancy work in the loess-mantled
 middle reaches (Shensi , Shansi , and eastern Kansu) of the
 Huang, origin of almost nine-tenths of the sediment load
 of the river.  Press reports of 1963 and later clearly
 indicated that diverse physical factors present in the
 middle Huang Valley had not been taken into account.  A
 December 1963 People's Daily article stated that hence-
 forth "geographical considerations based on actual practice"
 would be the criteria to be followed in future local land
 and water conservancy projects.  Earlier, for example,
 projects suitable for a particular physical environment had
 been imposed on other areas with differing physical
 conditions -- with predictable results.  In the future,
 according to the article, ". . . preventive measures [soil
 and water conservancy projects] should be geared exactly to
 the problems as they exist."

 23.  Two other problem rivers, the Huai and Hai ,
 received early attention from PRC leaders.  Both river
 basins suffered from excessive loads of silt and from
 their inability to discharge through their silt-clogged
 channels a sufficient volume of water to prevent flooding
 during periods of heavy rains.  Although flood prevention
 was the most immediate problem, other objectives included
 water for irrigation and the generation of electricity.
 24.  Early work on the Huai consisted principally of
 repair and rehabilitation of existing facilities.  Because
 considerable engineering data were available from pre-1949
 studies on control of the Huai , the PRC was able to shift
 quickly into a comprehensive program involving the building
 of new outlets, straightening river courses, and the con-
 struction of reservoirs.  The pace, direction, and emphasis

 of the plans, however, frequently changed.  Announced
 successes were often followed by later admissions of
 failure.  Familiar problems arose -- uncoordinated efforts,
 incompetent planning, hasty work, poor maintenance of com-
 pleted works, and failure to complete basic erosion control
 in headwater areas.
 25.  By late 1972 a Chinese article proclaimed that
 the basin "   . . had been transformed."*  The construction
 work of over two decades certainly has superficially trans-
 formed the Huai basin landscape with new reservoirs, new
 river channels and outlets, and a host of lesser works
 ;.impleted.  Whether the transformation has completely
 eliminated the chronic problems of the Huai awaits the test
 of prolonged heavy rains and lengthy dry spells before a
 final verdict can be reached (Figure 4).
 26.  The Hai River, a short but important stream in
 the northern port-ion of the North China Plain, serves as
 the outlet for five major streams that wind across the
 northern Plain and which unite just west of 'Tientsin.  This
 portion of the Plain long has been subject to serious
 flooding and its agricultural potential limited by consider-
 able amounts of waterlogged and alkalinized or salinized
 land.  Although some flood control projects were completed
 during tip,: 1954-1960 period, very serious flooding in 1963,
 when all five rivers overflowed, prompted a decree from
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung that "The Hai Ho must be brought under
 permanent control."  (See Chronology of Water Control
 Projects and Problems . . . following text.)
 27.  A variety of projects were subsequently under-
 taken, including major drainage projects that have involved
 the digging of new channels and providing new outlets.
 Nevertheless, an April 1973 broadcast from Anhwei told
 of the "first stage" of a Huai project calling for a
 123-km canal and the construction of bridges, regulators,
 and navigation locks to relieve some 400, 000 hectares of
 cultivated Zand from the threat of flooding.

 and reclaiming additional land.  The area of alkaline land,
 according to recent reports, has been reduc:od by half.
 Overall, the amount of work done in the llai basin is
 impressive (flap G).
 28.  Although the probability of scri ous flooding in
 the Ilai basin certainly  has been greatly reduced, the long
 term success of the present programs will depend upon
 efficient management of the newly created control and
 drainage systems.  Dikes must be inspected and strengthened,
 protective ve,:-tation on the dikes maintained, water seepage
 from streams to areas of sandy soil control lei:, dr' dgi ng
 continued, and pumps continually maintained and repaired.
 Improved crop yields can be expected over the next few years
 from land that previously had been waterl ogped , although
 salinized soil must be leached fur years before it becomes
 fully productive.  Some successes have been achieved in
 reducing the area of alkaline land, but the complicated
 network of new channels must be operatively synchronized
 to prevent the development of additional problems of water-
 logging and salinization following periods of above-normal
 rainfall.
