 ISRAEL-LEBANON:   Stalemate Still Continuing
 (Information as of 0030 EDT)
 The Israelis kept up their psychological pressure yesterday
 on West Beirut amid signs that the Lebanese-PLO talks have essen-
 tiaZZy reached an impasse.                         The PLO continues to show no sign of
 compromise on its demand to be allowed to keep at least a symbolic

 Comment:   Israel's mock air attacks on Beirut and
 its closure of the main highway east of the city yester-
 day were intended to signal the Palestinians and Syrians
 in West Beirut that time is running out.   In the six days
 since the cease-fire, Israel has been assembling and
 equipping its task force on the periphery of Beirut for
 an eventual assault on the western sector of the city.
 These forces are now prepared for the attack and ready to
 Comment:   The Palestinians are continuing to hold
 firm to their demand for at least some remaining military
 presence in Lebanon and appear to believe the Lebanese
 Government will eventually accede.   Palestinian forces
 in West Beirut have made preparations for an Israeli
 assault, but their poorly contrived defenses will do
 little to stop a massive Israeli air and ground

 Comment:   Jumayyil's trip to Saudi Arabia is his
 first major political visit in the Arab world and is a
 further indication that the Saudis, and probably other
 moderate Arabs, recognize his emergence as Lebanon's
 leading political figure and the need to establish formal
 contact with him despite his ties with Israel.   The Saudis
 will urge Jumayyil to allow the PLO an "honorable" settle-
 ment in Beirut and to reconcile with Lebanese Muslims.
 In return, they will probably try to facilitate direct
 talks between him and Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam on
 The invasion has cost $1 billion in direct costs
 and an additional S1.5 billion in lost output, according
 to Chairman Lorincz of the Knesset Finance Committee;
 Finance Minister Aridor has put total costs at $2-3 billion.
 Lorincz said a supplemental budget will be needed to cover
 war costs and higher inflation.   The military has in-
 creased the length of duty of regular forces to release
 Comment:   The Israeli Government apparently is pre-
 paring the public for new taxes in addition to those im-
 posed last month.   Aridor probably wants to mitigate the
 impact on inflation by raising taxes as much as is politi-
 cally feasible, but the deficit for the current fiscal
 year will still be larger than originally planned.   The
 The Soviets called on the Arabs in a TASS commentary
 yesterday to use the "oil weapon" against Israel and the
 US.    Another TASS report has publicized a Jordanian news-
 paper's commentary that defended the USSR's cautious re-
 sponse to the crisis.   It replayed statements that Moscow
 has never promised that the USSR would send Soviet armies
 to defend any Arab country and that it never claimed it
 Moscow has also sought to rebut the widespread
 criticism of Syria's Soviet-made weapons by asserting
 that Soviet ground equipment had demonstrated its effec-
 tiveness during the fighting.   It did not mention surface-

 appeal during the current crisis for an oil embargo.

 The defensive tone and bluntness of the other TASS
 articles reflect heightened sensitivity to the more fre-
 quent Arab charges that the USSR has not supported Syria
 and the Palestinians and that its weapons are inferior.
 The Soviets probably are also concerned that the criti-
 cism of their weapons could undermine hard currency arms

 conditions under which Moscow might end its moratorium on INF
 //Last March, President Brezhnev stated a moratorium

 Comment:   //The Soviet representative's statement
 suggests the USSR is planning to continue its moratorium
 into at least early 1983.   The Soviets want to maintain
 their pressure against US INF deployments, and they prob-
 ably will continue over the next few months to be delib-
 erately vague in their public comments on the conditions
 for continuing their moratorium.//
 //As the scheduled delivery dates for the missiles
 approach, however, the Soviets may threaten to terminate
 the moratorium when the missiles arrive.   This would be
 especially the case if they are not satisfied with the
 A People's Daily editorial, yesterday commemorating the 61st
 anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party set
 party priorities for the rest of the year and announced plans for
 the Zong-awaited 12th Party Congress.
 //The editorial reported government and party reorgani-
 zation and the crackdown on corruption will continue to
 receive top priority.   The party congress will be held
 before the end of this year and will be followed by a
 rectification campaign.   Party Chairman Hu Yaobang re-
 cently told foreign visitors that the congress would
 convene in September or October.//
 Comment:   The congress, originally intended for
 early 1981, was delayed repeatedly while Vice Chairman
 Deng Xiaoping and his associates sought agreement on key
 reform issues and maneuvered to ensure their political
 dominance.   The government and party reorganization in
 May helped clear the way for Den    but much work remains
 before the congress can be held.
 Hard bargaining will be required to get party con-
 servatives to agree with moderate leaders on the member-
 ship of a new Central Committee and Politburo.   In addi-
 tion,                         the credentials of provincial delegates selected
 earlier will have to be reexamined and dele at es opposed
 to the reform policies will be replaced.
 The rectification drive will be aimed at purging
 remaining "Gang of Four" sympathizers and other politi-
 cally unreliable officials.   Official guidance has
 stressed that party rectification will be a long, slow
 process and that care must be taken to avoid disrupting

 with Argentina, when he generally supported the Thatcher
 government while Jenkins remained silent.//
 Comment:   //Jenkins and Owen disagree on what direc-
 tion to steer the party, which had made inroads against
 Labor and the Tories until infighting and the crisis over
 the Falklands intruded.   Jenkins favors close ties with
 the Liberals and wants the Social Democratic - Liberal

 seniority in national politics would allow him to coop-
 erate more readily with Liberal leader Steel.//
 //Owen's strategy probably offers more promise for
 long-term Social Democratic gains.   His policy views,
 reputation for arrogance, and junior standing would make
 cooperation with the Liberals more difficult.//
 //If Owen wins, he may come under pressure to find
 a compromise by offering to support Jenkins as leader
 of the alliance, while he and Steel become deputies.

 policy leftward, cultivating special relationships with France and
 The government has announced that it intends to
 pursue a policy of nonalignment but claims it will main-
 tain good relations with traditional Western friends.
 It will, however, also support various liberation move-
 ments.   Indian Prime Minister Gandhi and French Minister
 of Cooperation and Development Cot will visit Mauritius

 would be allowed to make port calls.   He noted that

 Prime Minister Jugnauth, whose party received exten-
 sive Libyan aid during the election campaign, plans to
 Comment:   The regime's leftist ideology is tempered
 by a pragmatic recognition of the country's economic
 straits and its need to avoid alienating potential Western
 aid donors.   The government recognizes the Soviets are
 unwilling to provide significant help,  and it probably
 hopes to win new aid and diplomatic support from both
 Paris and New Delhi.   It also expects Gandhi's visit to
 calm fears of the island's Hindu majority that government
 policies will be pro-Libyan and pro-Muslim.
 The new policy on naval ship calls will leave the
 US without naval access to any of the island states in
 the southwestern Indian Ocean and the USSR with only
 limited access in Seychelles.   Mauritius is likely to
 link its naval access policy with its call for eventual
 demilitarization of Diego Garcia and support for the
 Indian Ocean zone-of-peace concept.   The government prob-
 ably believes limited criticism of the US military pres-
 ence will not cause Washington to cut off economic aid,

 //A member of the Central Committee of the East German
 Communist Party reportedly told party functionaries in
 mid-June that Soviet oil deliveries would be cut by
 another 20,000 barrels per day.   Along with previous
 cuts, this will reduce deliveries to 320,000 barrels per
 day--less than 85 percent of the amount originally
 planned for this year.   Drastic reductions in fuel con-
 sumption have already been ordered, and party Secretary
 Mittag has described energy conservation as the country's
 Comment:   //This reduction suggests the Soviets intend
 to increase their own sales for hard currency despite a
 leveling off of production.   The Soviets also may be
 making additional cuts in deliveries to Czechoslovakia

 would further aggravate economic difficulties in Eastern
 General Bignone, who assumed the presidency yesterday, faces
 a nation disillusioned and divided over the loss of the Falklands
 and suffering economic distress.  Moreover, public confidence in the
 government has been eroded by the military's incompetence in waging
 the war.  Civilians are highly suspicious of Bignone, and he has
 managed thus far to buy their support only with firm promises to
 schedule elections and Lift the ban on political activity.
 The military is divided over Bignone's selection.
 The Air Force and Navy, who opposed his appointment over
 civilian candidates, have dissociated themselves from
 the regime.   In the Army, splits have developed between
 Bignone has not yet spelled out his policies, but his
 first steps suggest he will try to chart a moderate course.
 His cabinet is composed largely of civilians, man  of whom
 have good connections with political parties.
 The President has not been able to bring the Navy
 and Air Force back into the junta, but his policy changes
 have earned at least their tacit approval for his admin-
 istration.   Dagnino Pastore, Bignone's choice to revive
 the economy, reportedly has adopted balanced measures to
 promote exports, grant moderate wage hikes, and increase
 social assistance spending.
 Nonetheless, a smooth transition will be increas-
 ingly difficult.   The Multipartidaria, a coalition of
 five leading political parties, will demand more populist
 The military will urge increased spending to rearm.
 Business will lobby for faster growth, increased state
 intervention, and more nationalistic economic policies.
 External creditors will demand continued economic
 restraint to restore Argentina's international credit-
 worthiness.)
 Growing criticism of the military's performance dur-
 ing the war will almost certainly cause civilians and
 dissident officers to put more pressure on Bignone to
 purge members of the high command who put him in office.
 Newly formed political parties, with no target other than
 the military government, are likely to be less accommo-
 dating, especially if the government is forced to back
 away from even modest concessions.   Public demonstrations,
 if repressed, will further isolate the regime and threaten
 Economic woes will add to Bignone's problems.
 Argentina's severe recession--economic activity declined
 6 percent in the first quarter--has worsened in the face
 of export disruptions, investment slowdowns and capital
 Moreover, increased military spending, the relaxa-
 tion of tight money policies and the recent devaluation
 will push inflation beyond the current 140-percent level.
 The loss of foreign exchange reserves and the near cessa-
 tion of longer term foreign credit continues to imperil
 the country's ability to service its debt, which is mainly

 smooth initial discontent.   But it would set the stage
 for even higher inflation--possibly to the record levels
 of the mid-1970s--that would further erode Bignone's thin

 Argentina reportedly is anxious to normalize rela-
 tions with the US, but its experiences during the con-
 flict probably will move the government toward closer
 ties with the Third World and other nonaligned countries,
 especially in multilateral forums.  US commercial inter-
 ests would be adversely affected by continued Argentine
 import restrictions, possible reprisals against multi-
 national firms, or debt rescheduling.
 To help calm criticism of the Army, Bignone is
 likely to maintain diplomatic pressure on the UK over
 the Falklands.   In addition, he may stall negotiations
 To recoup national prestige, Bignone or another
 successor regime could accelerate efforts to develop a
 nuclear weapons capability.  Argentina's search for new
 and advanced weaponry could provoke an arms race through-
 out South America.   If unable to obtain these weapons from
 Western sources, the Argentines might consider selectively
