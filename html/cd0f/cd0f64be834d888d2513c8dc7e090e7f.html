S. -SOVIET RELATIO S 
MOSCOW HITS TRADE BILL RESTRICTIONS, AVOIDS THREATS 
In Lid comment on Congressional passage of the trade bill on 
20 December suggests that Moscow wants to avoid any further 
escalation of its recent protest over the linkage of the bill to 
Jewish emigration. Although the comment echoes the indignation 
over the issue expressed in the TASS statement of 18 December, 
it contains no substantial hints that Moscow is contemplating 
anything more than rhetorical protests at time. This 
appears to confirm the impressions of Westerr observers that 
Moscow's protest over the issue was essentially a face 
saving maneuver designed to extricate the Soviet Union from an 
embarrassing public position. 
THE 18 DECEMBER DOCUMENTS The TASS statement issued on the 18th 
danounced the efforts allegedly 
being made in the United States to tie the trade bill to conditions 
affecting Jewish emigration. Moscow also issued a letter from 
Foreign Minister Gromykb to Secretary of State Kissinger, dated 
26 Octcber, which purportedly detailed the extent of the under-
standing reached between the two governments on this issue 
The TASS statement was carefully contrived te convey a maximum of 
indignati-ai with a minimum of specific commitet. No.:Mg that 
the "uuderstanding in principle" reached in 1972 had called fcr 
the removal of "discriminatory resLietions" in 11S. tade 
legislation, the statement declared that pi-ogress in dis direction 
had been systematically stalled and hampered in the Ur,.:ted States. 
Ascribing this obstructionism to unnamed "o one a normaliza-
tion of Soviet-American trade," denounced the .!':1Toc:s allegedly 
being made in the United States to attach 'reseIvatio-as and demands" 
to the trade bill as a "gross interference in Lhe 50-,--int: Union's 
internal affairs." It went on to warn that tie adcption by the 
U.S Congress of such limiting conditions would "run directly counter 
to the clear obligations of the parties to the 1972 trade agreement." 
Although this statement carries an implied th.-zat of reteliaLory 
action, the immediately following paragraph wiichseems to he the 
operative one, watered it down considerably. It sulted that the

"leading circles" of the Soviet Union categorically reject as 
"inadmissible" any attempts to interfere in affairs that are 
entirely within the internal competence of the Soviet state. The 
ascription of the rejection to "leading circles" is normal in 
TASS statements and in effect leaves the Soviet Government 
uncommitted. 
Gromyko's letter to Kissinger contested the accuracy of statements 
allegedly made in the United States regarding the nature of the 
understanding reached between the two governments on Jewish 
emigration, asserting that the Soviet Union had not only not 
agreed to any liberalization in this regard, but had actually 
informed the U.S. Goverment that the trend in Jewish emigration 
would be likely to go down. Since the statements in question 
included the assurances given to Senator Jackson by Secretary 
Kissinger, the letter amounts in effect to a questic-ing of the 
Secretary's accuracy. Such a breach of diplomatic etiquette 
suggests that the Soviet Government believed that countervailing 
needs were compelling. The Soviet Government may have felt that 
a clearing of the record was required to assure domestic or 
foreign communist party critics that the Soviet leadership had not 
knuckled under to Western pressure. 
COMMENT ON TRADE BILL The comment on the passage of the trade 
bill has included a spate of items which 
generally reiterate the substance of the 18 December documents. 
The most substantial comment to date was a Moscow observers' 
roundtable discussion on 22 December which reinforced the substance 
of the official protest by drawing on Brezhnev's speech in Moscow 
to the U.S.-Soviet Trade and Economic Council on 15 October. One 
of the commentators drew attention to Brezhnev's discreet reminder 
that restrictions on U.S. trade would make the United States less 
competitive than other Western countries as a trading partner for 
the Soviet Union. The comment has contained no substantial 
indications that the Soviet Union is contemplating anything more 
than rhetorical protests at this time. One exception was a routine 
radio commentary to North America which warned against misjudging 
the Soviet protest as an empty gesture. This, however, can be 
safely discounted as a serious expression of official views.

ARAB-ISRAEL ISSUE 
USSR MARKS GENEVA ANNIVERSARY WITH BARBS AT QUIET DIPLOMACY 
Moscow has marked the first anniversary of the 21 December 
opening of the Middle East peace conference in Geneva with 
renewed calls for speedy resumption of the talks, continued 
accusations of Israeli efforts to undermine the conference, 
and further digs at the U.S. preference for phased negotiations. 
The anniversary prompted a 20 December commentary by TASS' 
Yuriy Trushin, articles by Tsaplin in PRAVDA on the 21st and 
by Kudryavtsev in IZVESTIYA on the 22d--both reviewed by TASS--
and a Medvedko radio commentary on the 21st. 
Trushin's TASS commentary, like other recent comment, repre-
sented the Soviet-U.S. and Soviet-;French communiques on 
Brezhnev's talks with Presidents Ford and Giscard d'Estaing 
as having stressed the "pressing need for speediest resumption" 
of the Geneva talks. (Both communiques said only that the 
conference should "resume its work as soon as possible.") 
Doubt that the United States was supporting the conference 
in the spirit of the U.S.-Soviet communique was suggusted 
in a Moscow domestic service commentary on 15 December. The 
broadcast asserted that Israeli Foreign Minister Allon during 
his Washington talks a few days earlier had "foisted on the 
White House" his own conditions "which clearly go against 
the decisions of the Vladivostok meeting." Citing the 
Washington POST, the broadcast said that the United States 
had "agreed umaJlingly" to Israel's procedure for separate 
talks although this effectively postponed the convening of 
the Geneva conference. 
The anniversary comment repeated past Soviet complaints that 
Israel and its "traditional patrons abroad" were seeking to 
replace a general political settlement with "talks between 
groups or bilateral talks" to effect partial agreements 
aimed at weakening the unity of the Arab countries. Tsaplin 
in PRAVDA declared Soviet opposition to attempts to "stop at 
half measures" which would only create an illusion of solving 
the conflict. Medvedko and Trushin both credited the two-day 
Geneva conference last year with laying the groundwork for 
disengagement on the Sinai and Golan fronts; Medvedko blandly 
went on to assert that subsequent efforts to follow up 
disengagement with "other steps" had proved the "ineffectiveness" 
of quiet diplomacy.

IZVESTIYA's Kudryavtsev, reiterating the line that Israel was 
trying to split the Lab community, asserted by way of illus-
tration that "the Israeli aggressors and their international 
instigators" were trying to persuade Egypt into separate 
negotiations and agreements, "hinting that Egypt will, you 
see, have the captured lands in Sinai returned in exchange 
for a final agreement with Israel." 
CAIRO "CLARIFICATIONS" Egyptian sensitivity to any such 
hints of a sellout of Cairo's Arab 
allies, particularly Syria, was promptly reflected in leading 
articles in AL-AHRAM and AL-AKHBAR, as reported by the MIDDLE 
EAST NEWS AGENCY on the 23d. The papers may also have read 
in Kldryavtsev's comments a veiled warning against Egyptian 
acceptance of a second round of U.S.-sponsored negotiations 
with Israel over Sinai. President as-Sadat has declared, 
with some urgency, his readiness to move in that direction, 
presumably hoping to have some progress in hand before welcom-
ing Brezhnev to Egypt. 
The Cairo press response to IZVESTIYA aimed at dispelling 
any erroneous impressions about Egypt's commitment to Arab 
solidarity that "the organ of the friendly Soviet Government" 
might unwittingly have conveyed. AL-AKRBAR chief editor 
Musa Sabri, quoting the offending IZVESTIYA passage, offered 
assurances that Kudryavtsev's remarks were undoubtedly well 
intended but said he nevertheless felt impelled to provide 
a "sound clarification" since the IZVESTIYA article might 
give an opportunity to "those who try to distort Egypt's 
firm national stand, to misconstrue these words and come 
out with interpretations which we believe the Soviet Govern-
ment paper did not intend." 
Musa Sabri affected a tone of sincere desire to correct any 
wrong impressions arising from the IZVESTIYA article at a 
time when Egypt "is preparing to receive Brezhnev and con-
siders his visit a turning point toward the further 
strengthening of relations" between the two countries 
and peoples. AL-AHRAM's editorial approached the subject 
somewhat more cautiously, but also pointed out that Egypt 
attached "extreme importance" to Brezhnev's visit, and 
expressed confidence that "the Soviet friends are fully 
aware" of Egypt's role in the Middle East and its willing-
ness to suffer not only for the sake of Sinai but for all 
the occupied territories.

President as-Sadat, in a Chicago DAILY NEWS interview reported 
by Cairo radio on the 24th, said there was still an opportunity 
to find a settlement "on the basis of Kissinger's formula," 
but indicated that there could be no delay. The United States 
"must move quickly" to prevent the danger of war, he said, 
adding later that "we must work in a speedy way." While 
declaring that he was still optimistic, he said that "however, 
this is a turning point; I want the officials of the U.S. 
State Department to realize this."

I/13FR 
PACT SAYS NEXT MOVE UP TO NATO, CHARGES "CONCEPTUAL INERTIA': 
The public assessment by Moscow and its East European allies of 
the fourth round of the Vienna force reduction negotiations (MBFR), 
now in recess until 27 January, places the responsibility for the 
lack of progress after more than a year of talks squarely on 
the NATO side. Comment has taken the Western participants to 
task repeatedly for allegedly not offering any substantive 
changes in their original November 1973 proposal, while crediting 
the Warsaw Pact states with "flexibility." The Pact has been 
praised for trying to break the impasse by introducing such 
"compromise" moves as the call for initial step reductions in 1975. 
Another Pact proposal--for a freeze on armed forces and arms in 
the area under negotiations while the talks are in progress--has 
also now been acknowledged, at the lowest level of Soviet comment, 
in a Moscow Radio Peace and Progress commentary in German on the 
17th. 
Chief Soviet delegate Oleg Khlestov, in a TASS interview on the 
13th, the day after the last plenary session before the recess, 
repeated the long-standing charge that the basic NATO negotiating 
position was "unrealistic" and based on an "unjust approach." A 
Semenov TASS commentary on the 12th, published in PRAVDA the 
following day, conveyed the general attitude that "it is now up 
to the West." Warsaw's prominent MBFR commentator Andrzej Rayzacher, 
in an article in the daily ZYCIE WARSZAWY on the 18th, summed up 
the East's view in observing that the Western participants were 
suffering from "conceptual inertia," 
At the same time, there have been some hints of guarded optimism 
for progress in the fifth round, perhaps related to the possibility 
that the NATO participants might introduce the issue of U.S. nuclear 
forces in Europe, a subject which the Pact since the beginning has 
adamantly demanded be included in the talks. Rayzacher in his 
article on the 18th called the news reports on statements by 
Secretary Kissinger and the Dutch defense minister at the recent 
NATO Brussels meetings regarding the extension of MBFR to tactical 
nuclear weapons as "harbingers" for the fifth round. Secretary 
Kissinger was cited as saying that although it was "necessary" to 
extend the framework of the MBFR talks, "the proper time 'has not 
arrived for it yet."

CO IMUN IS I RELATIONS 
EUROPEAN PARTIES REMAIN SPLIT ON FORTHCOMING CONFERENCE 
The 19-21 December Budapest meeting of European communist parties 
has apparently failed to reconcile the differences over the 
format and agenda of the forthcoming European regional con-
fetence, scheduled for East Berlin in 1975, which were registered 
at the Warsaw consultative meeting of the same parties in 
October. The issue of majority rule versus the unanimity 
principle again emerged as a bone of contention, with the 
Moscow-leaning parties lining up against the independents, 
Romania and Yugoslavia. And the question of whether the con-
ference should take a stand on China was again passed over in 
silence, a sure sign of deep-seated differences over the issue. 
Judging by the communique of the meeting and the leading 
speeches, the positions of the contending sides on these 
issues have hardened rather than softened with the passage 
of time. 
The communique appeared to register an agreement to disagree 
pending further study of the issues. It announced that an 
editorial commission, open to "all" participating parties, 
had been set up to prepare the agenda for next year's con-
ference. While it described the atmosphere of the meeting 
as one of "mutual understanding, equality, and proletarian 
solidarity," it also noted that there had been a "wide-ranging 
exchange of vies-9." Moreover, unlike the Warsaw communique, 
it did not describe this exchange as "friendly," ner did it 
say that the proceedings were pervaded by a spirit or 
"democracy." 
KADAR SPEECH As the host of the conference and the keynote 
speaker, Hungarian party first secretary Kadar 
appeared to assume the role of hcaest broker between 'Le 
contending sides. He paid deference to the views ot the 
Romanians and Yugoslays by acknowledging that there was no 
"center or leading party" in the communist movement, but he 
took the majority position in insisting that the forthcoming 
conference should reach joint decisions. Reminding that the 
Comintern had been dissolved decades age, Kadar asserted that 
the parties were indeed independen' but then declared flatly 
that this was "not enough," and that the parties should meet 
from time to time to "coordinate their actions-" These

remarks were presumably in response to those by Yugoslav 
delegate Grlickov at the Warsaw cons-atative meeting in 
October to the effect that there mu-.t no longer be, as in 
the past, any direction of the communise. movement from "one 
center." Repeatedly emphasizing unity, joint action and 
collectivity, Kadar pointed out that, while each party 
would participate in the conference in accordance with its 
own circumstances, it must be "imbued by responsibility for 
the common cause." Each party's success or failure is 
inextricably intertwined with that of the whole movement, 
he declared, and a strong European communist movement will 
not only strengthen European peace and security but also 
the prestige of each communist party on the continent. 
Kadar's remarks on the absence of a leading center and on 
the Comintern, included in the MTI prerelease of the speech, 
were omitted from TASS' report. 
PONOMAREV SPEECH The speech by Soviet chief delegate 
Ponomarev on the 20th was, judging by 
the TASS report, a more hard-line statement than the one he 
made at the Warsaw meeting in October. The European CP's, 
he declared, must adopt "principled, class positions," in 
line with the stance of the Soviet side in the East-West 
summit meetings in recent years, and they can best serve 
European peace and security from a base of unity and cohesion 
on ikirxist-Leninist principles. In an implicit swipe at 
Peking, Ponomarev stressed that the European CP conference 
must take a stand against all purveyors of auticommunism and 
anti-Sovietism "in Europe and beyond it." 
As in Warsaw, the China issue was generally avoided, and there 
was apparent silence this time regarding the goal of a world 
communist party conference as a followup to the European one.* 
The inevitability of a world conference was, however, implicitly 
stressed by Tellalov, representing the Bulgarian CP, who 
asserted that the 1975 East Berlin conference must take into 
account that Europe "cannot be separated by a 'Chinese wall' 
from the rest of the world." 
* At Warsaw, the only publicized mention of a world conference 
was one by Yugoslavia's Grlickov, who stressed that there were 
at present no conditions warranting the convening of a world 
conclave.

ROMANIA, YUGOSLAVIA Andrei and Grlickov, who again represented 
the Romanian and Yugoslav parties, respect-
ively, continued in their speeches on the 20th to withhold any 
commitment by their parties to participate in the further 
preparations or to attend the final European CP conference. 
The two independents were more explicit than they had been at 
Warsaw in insisting that the main document to be issued by 
next year's conference must represent a "consensus" of all 
the participating parties, thus ruling out a document adopted 
by majority vote which could be repugnant to the independents 
Romanian CP Secretary Andrei, as reported by AGERPRES on the 
21st, went to the lengths of remarking that his party saw no 
absolute need to have any final conference document other 
than a brief communique, stressing that the important thing 
was rather to get the statements by each of the conference 
delegates on public record. The RCP, he added, was willing 
to go along with a consensus final document, provided that it 
did not include "tasks" for the participating parties or other-
wise infringe upon their autonomy. 
Similarly, LCY Secretary Grlickov declared that :here was room 
in the final conference document only for "those assessments, 
attitudes and proposals which are acceptable to all" the con-
ference participants, and that it must be prepared and adopted 
only by consensus. He added the demand that the draft of the 
final document be given to the leaderships of the paiticipating 
parties for their consideration well in advance cr the conference 
A talk by Zagreb radio commentator Sundic on the 21st, pertraying 
a harder-line atmosphere at the Budapest meeting than at Warsaw 
two months ago, was restrained in remarking only that there 
were "no grounds to cast cl.?.uhts" on the bc1:ess oi the editoLlal 
commission set up at the latest meeting ar,d that the pa(ttcipating 
parties' differences were not "in;uperable obstacles" to convening 
next year's conference. 
On the 23d, Sundic critically noted, withut mentioning Ponomatev 
directly, that the CPSU had equated anti-Sovietism with anti-
communism at the Budapest meeting, Sundic interpreted this as 
an unacceptable Soviet ploy to get the China issue on -the agenda 
of the European CP conference,

HANOI MEETING MARKS 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF NOR1H VIETNAMESE ARMY 
North Vietnam's celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding 
of the Vietnam People's Army (VPA) was highlighted by a 22 December 
"grand meeting" in Hanoi attended by First Secretary Le Duan and 
other top leeders of the Vietnam Workers Party (VWP). In addition 
to the keynote address by Defense Minister Senior General Vo Nguyen 
Giap, the meeting heard the usual brief opening statement by 
Premier Pham Van Dong, and National Assembly Standing Committee 
Chairman Truong Chinh presented the VPA with an award. 
In his speech to Lhe anniversary meeting, Giap maintained that 
the "revolutionary forces" in Vietnam at present "are definitely 
stronger than the counterrevolutionary forcesIf and will continue 
to increase in strength. Leaving open the possibility of a 
political solution in South Vietnam, he warned that the United 
States must choose between "two paths," either implementing the 
Paris agreement and ending "military involvement" in Vietnam or 
inviting "increasingly heavier and more disastrous setbacks" by 
following iLs past course, "sabotaging" the agreement and "clinging" 
to Thieu. Giap also wrote a lengthy "essay" on the occasion of the 
anniversary which was published in installments in the Hanoi press 
on 20 and 21 December and broadcast by Hanoi radio. The essay, 
entitled "Invincible Strength of the Vietnamese People's War in 
the New Era," is not yet available in translation. 
VPA anniversary festivities also included receptions in honor of 
visiting military delegations--one from the Sovjni Union, led by 
Chief of the General Staff General V.G. Kulikov, and one from Laos, 
led by Thao Mun, chief of the Lao People's Liberation Army logistics 
department. Perhaps because the Chinese sent no delegation to 
balance Kulikov's presence, Hanoi dispatched a delegation to 
Peking for the anniversary, led by Major General Nguyen Quy2t--
identified b7,- Peking as political commissar of the VPA military 
college.* The 20th army anniversary in 1964 prompted no such 
exchanges of delegations. 
* Nguyen Quyet was identified as recently as lasc May as the 
political commissar for the Third Military Region--see the TRENDS 
of 15 May 1974, page 11.

NFLSV CELEBRATES 14TH ANNIVERSARY, HOLDS PRESIDIUM MEETING 
Ceremonies marking the fourteenth anniversary of the 20 December 1960 
founding of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front (NFLSV) 
were similar to other nondecennial celebrations. The meeting in 
the "liberated area" was held at an unspecified location in Quang 
Tri Province on the 19th and was attended by NFLSV Chairman Nguyen 
Huu Tho, who delivered the main address, Vietnam Alliance Chairman 
Trinh Dinh Theo, the Provisional Revolutionary Government's Vice 
President Nguyen Doa, and other NFLSV and PRG officials. PaG 
President Huyen Tan Phat was not reported as attending for the 
first time in at least five years. The DRV celebration in Hanoi 
was held as usual the day before, on the 18th. Sponsored by 
the Vietnam Fatherland Front (VFF) and the PRG special representa-
tion in the DRV, the meeting's participants included Politburo 
member Hoang Van Hoan, Vietnam Workers Party Central Committee 
Secretary Xuan Thuy, and VFF official Hoang Minh Giam, who was 
the main speaker.* 
PRESIDIUM MEETING Coincident with the obFervance of the NFLSV 
anniversary, the NFLSV eenvened an "enlarged" 
meeting of the Front Central Committee Presidium on 13 and 14 December. 
According to a Liberation Radio report on the 17th, the conference 
was attended by all members of the Presidium and Secretariat and 
"many members" of the NFLSV Central Committee_ With Nguyen Huu Tho 
presiding, the conferees heard reports on the situation in the 
Scut', the war, the building of the liberaed areas, the struggle 
movement in the cities, and the diplomatic efforts cf the PRG. As 
at the anniversary celebration, Huyen Tan Phat was nat reported in 
attendance?his presence was neither noted by media reports nor 
the conference's 15 December communique, The Presidium is on 
record as having met on four previous occasions in the past six 
years?in early December 1-68, in early August 1969, on 1.-2 November 
1972, and on 2-3 November 1973--and Phat was reported as participating 
in all but the 1968 session. 
PRG'S ADMINISTRATIVE, The Press and Information Department of the 
TERRITORIAL CLAIMS PRG Foreign Ministry has issued a lengthy 
"basic document" whose 5 December eelease 
date suggests timing in preparation for the NFLSV anniversary. Entitled

People," the document is largely a replay of standard arguments 
on the PRG's legitimacy. 
In recapitulating the administrative breakdown under the PRG, 
the document referred to a supraprovincial level of authority--
the region (khu). The first known such reference was last 
October in a Liberation Radio report on the establishment of 
a "regional people's revolutionary committee" for Western Nam 
Bo (the southern most region of South Vietnam.) According to 
the October broadcast, the decision to "transform the PRG 
regional representations into regional people's revolutionary 
committees" was contained in a PRG Council of Ministers resolution 
adopted in July--a resolution not known to have been publicized. 
Following the October broadcast on the establishment of the 
committee for Western Nam Bo, the media have announced similar 
committees for Eastern Nam Bo and Southern Trung Bo, the two regions 
directly north of Saigon. 
The document's discussion of the administrative subdivisions 
in the South stated that the "rwolutionary administration" 
has a "power apparatus" of five levels: the central government, 
regional, municipal and provincial, district, and village or 
urban ward. These levels have, according to the document, been 
set up in six regions, 44 provinces, six major municipalities, 
200 cities, district capitals, or townships, 230 districts, and 
2,500 villages. Except for the newly announced regions, similar 
claims have been made in the past. For example, PRG Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Thi Binh in a June 1973 interview with a Hanoi 
newspaper declared that the PRG had administrations in "44 
provinces and six major municipalities." 
PRG territorial control in the South has once again been pegged 
at four-fifths of the entire area. In claiming this amount 
of territory for the communists, the document--and a 20 December 
LPA editorial marking the anniversary--has revived a figure often 
used prior co 1971 for describing the extent of PRG supremacy. 
Since then, territorial claims have customarily been couched in 
nonspecific generalities such as the "greater part of the South," 
and "vast areas." However, Mme Binh in interviews with the 
foreign press--the Swedish paper VAN on 7 February 1974 and the 
Bulgarian paper RABOTNICHESKO DELO on 13 August--declared that 
the liberated zone covered three-quarters of South Vietnam.

HANOI CONVENES FIFTH SESSION OF FOURTH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
Hanoi media have reported the opening of the fifth session of the 
DRV Fourth National Assembly on 23 December, noting that the National 
Assembly Standing Committee Chairman Truong Chinh delivered his usual 
opening address and that Vice Premier Le Thanh Nghi read the Counci,. 
of Ministers report -on the direction and tasks of the 1975 state 
plan." Truong Chinh somberly observed, without elaboration, that 
the session was being held at a time when "our people are ending a 
year replete with hardships and difficulties." Despite these unnamed 
adversities, he leelared that "great achievements" had been scored in 
all fields. He also said that the current session will "resolve 
certain problems" concerning preparations for the election of the 
Fifth National Assembly to take place in 1975. Holding the elections 
next year conforms to the constitutional provision that a new national 
assembly be elected every four years--the last having been elected in 
April 1971. 
Le Thanh Nghi's speech--which has thus far only been received in brief 
summary--recounted the "successful" implementation of the 1974 state 
plan, set forth the main economic tasks for 1975, and discussed measures 
to improve socialist production relations and management of the state 
and the economy. i?dmitting that North Vietnam is facing "many 
difficulties," Nghi at the same time asserted that thereare also "many 
basic advantages" and went on to predict "even greater successes" in 
building the North, completing the southern revolution, and advancing 
toward national reunification. Ng11. was essaying the role of main 
speaker at the National Assembly for only the second time, having 
replaced the traditional keynoter, Premier Pham Van Dung, at the last 
assembly session in February 1974. 
Hanoi reported that other officials at the session included President 
Ton Due Thang and Politburo members Le Dnan, Pham Van Dong, Vo 
Nguyen Giap, Nguyen Duy Trinh, and Hoang Van Hoan. A communique of the 
National Assembly Standing Committee broadcast by Hanoi radio on 
16 December gave the first indication of the new session when it reported 
that a regular meeting of the committee held that same day had approw2d 
preparatory plans for the fifth session, but without specifying when it 
would be held. According to the DRV constitution adopted in 1959, the 
National Assembly should meet twice a year--a principle that has razely 
been honored since the escalation of the war in 1965. The periodici-y of 
the r .ssions has been closer to an annual basis than semiannual; for 
example, the Fourth National Assembly was convened in June 1971, but the 
second session did not meet until March 1972, the third (a special session 
to mark the signing of the ralis agreement), not until. February 1973, 
and the fourth, a full year later in February 1974.

HANO I CHARGES , "PROPAGANDA CAMPA I NV ON MISSING PERSONNEL 
Hanoi has reacted in standard fashion to recent U.S. urgings that 
more information be released on U.S. personnel missing in action. 
A mildly-worded 23 December DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's 
statement protested toot the United States has launched a 
"distorted propaganda campaign" which accuses the DRV and PRO 
of failing to cooperate in the search for the missing personnel. 
According to the statement, the United States government is 
motivated in this effort by a desire to divert U.S. public opinion 
and conceal its "sabotage" of no Paris agreement, its "involvement" 
in South Vietnam, and its attempts to aid the GVN. 
While not directly denying the veracity of the U.S. charges that it 
described, the statement sought to leave an impression of DRV 
compassion for the relatives of the men missing by recounting Hanoi's 
willingnes, in letting the United States leceive the remains of its 
Pilots who died while captive in the North. A similar tack was 
taken last August in DRV media comment in response to what was then 
termed "slanderous statements" by U.S. officials on the issue of the 
missing in action. At that time, the propaganda was likewise at 
pains to defend the DRV's "long-standing humanitarian policy" with 
regard to POWs and those missing in action.* 
The current statement concluded by pointing out that the four-party 
Joint Military Commission has not yet worked out an agreement on the 
principles and specific procedures needod for effecting the searches 
and implied that, unless the United States fulfills the main 
provisions of the Paris agreement, it must bear the responsibility 
for the lack of progress ?obtaining information on the missing.

personnel, see the TRENDS of 7 August 1974, pages 21-22.

KOREA 
DPRK ATTACKS U.S. "NUCLEAR WAR PREPARATIONS," ROL.E AT UNGA 
Pyongyang's low-key allegations concerning the presence of U.S. 
our weapons in South Korea?initiated in early Octobec?were 
raised to an ofl icial. level with the release of a DPRK Foreign 
Ministry spokesman's statement on 20 December. The statement 
cited "recently published" U.S. Congressional testimony to 
document its charges that the United States has (let) toyed 
"numerousnuclear warheads and nuclear weapons" near the truce 
line and is planning to turn Suth Korea Into a "nuclear attack 
base." KCNA on the same day said the "recent" Congressional 
testimony had been given before a stdwomittee of the House Foreign 
All Committee and made public on 9 Decelifoer. KCNA reported 
that the North Korean representative at the Military Armistice 
Commission meeting that day also had denounced the "U.S. -lmiperialist 
aggressors" for "preparing for the provocation of a nuclear war in 
Korea by storing nuclear warheads and nuclear bombs in South Korea." 
Pyongyang's first comment on the nuclear issue had been sparked by 
the release in early October of Congressional testimony by retired 
U.S. Admiral La Rocque regarding U.S. nuclear weapons in Asia. In 
addition to radio and press commentaries in the ensuing weeks, 
Pyongyang reported the raising of the issue at the last throe 
Military Armistice ConunIssion meetings. And in late October, the 
North Korean-Chinese side of the commission sent protest letters 
on the subject to the UN Command and to the Neutral Nations 
Supervisory Commission. The campaign waned in November, and the 
nuclear issues was given virtually no at tn routine DPRK 
comment on President Ford's trip to South Korea an 22-23 November 
However, the Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on the nucloar 
issue did in fact bring in the President's trip. 
After asset ting that tae world now knows that the United States 
has long been bringing tactical nuclear weapons into South Korea, 
the spokesman said: "Just a short time ago, Ford, the chieftain 
of the U.S. imperialists, sneaked into South Korea, where, cDm.)Letely 
discarding his mask of peace, he actively goaded the South Korean 
bellicose elements into war pr(nocations." The statement !hen went 
on to charge that South Korea was planning to procure an "atomic 
reactor needed for the production of nuclear weapons." Pyongyang 
first raised this issue on 20 November, when KCNA repeated similar 
charges made by a Japanese organization concerning Secall's Aleged 
attempt to borrow money from Japan for the purchase of Canadian 
reactors. A 16 December statement issued by several North Korean

political groups had also made the connection between a reactor 
and nuclear arms for the South. A 14 December.NODONG SINMUN 
commentary and a 17 December Pyongyang radio commentary, however, 
had said only that the reactor would produce "nuclear material," 
without specifying weapons. Unlike these two commentaries, the 
foreign ministry spokesman's statement did not link Japan with 
the South's procurement of a reactor. 
U.S. ROLE IN UN A second foreign ministry spokesman's statement, 
issued on 24 December in connection with the 
conclusion of the UN debate on the Korean question, largely echoed 
previous Pyongyang media comment in criticizing the U.S. zole. 
The statement called the 9 December tie vote in the General 
Assembly's First Committee on the North Korean-backed resolution a 
heavy "political and moral defeat" for the United States. It 
claimed that until U.S. troops are withdrawn from South Korea 
there cannot be peace or security in either Korea or Asia, and 
thanked the cosponsors of the resolution for their support. 
The statement adopted an approach not seen before in the Ncrth's 
comment on the issue in claiming that the United States, unable 
to justify its presence in the So,,th under UN aegis, had 
"reluctantly" introduced a resolution "pretending" to look toward 
discus,siens on dissolving the UN Command. Without elaboration, 
the statement protested that since the U.S.-backed resolution 
referred the question to the UN Security Council, it only revealed 
the "unchanged ulterior desiga" of the United States to avert 
withdrawing its troops from the South. Echoing earlier Pyongyang 
comment on the final vote, the statement vowed the DPRK would 
"never tolerate" any UN resolution justifying U.S. troop presence 
in South Korea.

CHINA 
YANG CHENG-WU, C1HERS NAMED AS DEPUTY CHIEFS OF STAFF 
Yang Cheng-wu, PLA acting chief of staff until his purge In 1968, 
was identified as a deputy chief of staff by NCNA on 21 December, 
in reports of Peking festivities hailing the 30th anni.ersary of 
the Vietnam People's Army. Yang appeared on several occasions 
during the celebrations and hosted a banquet for the visiting 
DRV military delegation.. Yang's return to the PLA general staff, 
which has had no chief since the purge of Huang Yung-sheng in 
1 97I, had been signaled by NCNA on 7 December when it placed 
Yang at the top of a list of PLA leaders attending a funeral, 
directly ahead of two deputy chiefs or staff. 
Also on the 21st, NCNA named Ho Cheng-wen, a deputy military 
region commander in Chengtu, as a deputy chief of staff Ho Was 
a Chengtu deputy commander prior to the cultural revolution, but 
dropped out of sight during the cultural. revolution and did riot 
reappear until April 1977 in Chengt.u. He has spent most of the 
past year in Peking, but was identified as a Chengtu deputy 
commander as recently as October. Two other deputy chiefs of 
staff have been identified in the past two weeks. Wang Shang-jung, 
general staff operations director prior to the cultural reolution, 
was cited in the post by NCNA on 9 December, and on 16 Deember 
NCNA referred to Hu Wei, who was first identified as a leading 
member of the PLA on Army Day this year after serving as a civilian 
leader in Shensi, as a deputy chief of staff. 
The new appointments, building up the central military command 
structure, seem likely to further reduce the influen7:e of the 
military region c.ommanders, whose power was already much lessened 
last year when most of them were transferred out of their bascs 
to new commands, No regional commander now holds the concurrent 
post of provincial party chief. In che two provinces where new 
party first secretaries have been designated, Kwangtung and Shantung, 
the posts were given to civilians. The same pattern seems to have 
been followed in Kiangsu, where civilian Peng Chung was identified 
as chairman of the revolutionary committee by NCNA on 19 December, 
All provincial party chiefs now hold that office concurrently Peng 
has served as a deputy party secretary and revolutionary committee 
chairman in the province and jumped over two senior party secretaries 
with military connections to gain the top post.

Perhaps coincidentally, the two provinces where new civilian 
secretaries have replaced departed commanders recently 
instructed field armies to follow the lead of provincial 
party committees. Field armies are under military region 
jurisdiction, and were not known to be subordinate to any 
provincial-level authority. But on 21 November a Canton NANFANG 
DAILY editorial ordered field armies to follow provincial party 
direction in handling militia aFfail:s. More recently, a Shantung 
PLA circular broadcast by Tsinan radio on 16 December told field 
armies to "consciously accept the leadership of the provincial 
party committee" when carrying out work in the localities.

SUPPLEHENTARY ARTICLE 
PEKING SIGNALS APPROVAL OF OPEN DEBATE ON HISTORICAL FIGURES 
For the first time since the cultural reyojutjon purges began in 
1966, Peking has ...ignaled approval of open debate on the role of 
historical figures. The public go-ahead for sea a debate, 
involving contentious evaluations of leaders from the past and 
often obscure allegorical references to current PRC leaders, 
came in an NCNA report of 11 December on the contents of a new 
journal, soon to be released, entitled HISTDRICAL STUDIES, 
NCNA noted that the journal would adhere to the lines of "making 
the past serve the present" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom 
and a hundred schools of thought contend." The hundred flowers 
theme was used by Mao in 1957 to spark debate, but was soon 
followed by a severe crackdown on debaters who went too far; 
in the period since the cultural revolution the "hundred flowers" 
phrase has appeared occasionally, but there has been Little 
evidence of any widespread debate. The NCNA report stated that 
the journal's .first issue would include articles presenting two 
different views of Tsao Tsao, a Three Kingdoms era leader who has 
been favorably appraised during the anti-Lin and Confucius campaign, 
and would begin "a discussion on the appraisal of Tsao Tsao." 
The revival of pubPc debate on history is consonant with a general 
shift in the ant -Lin and Confucius campaign away from mass struggle 
to academic struggle. At the same time the campaign has turned to 
a new emphasis on unity and economic production. The debate over 
hjstory seems intended to keep the ideological struggle going, thus 
meeting the needs of Maoist theory, while not allowing to affect 
conditions necessary for economic gains at a time when many provinces 
have already called for a new economic "leap forward." 
Historical debate in China has a pattern of spreading far beyond 
academic fields, however. The use of analogy between figures of 
past and present leaders has been especially controversial. Most 
major PRC political movements have followed hard on the heels of an 
academic debate, and the cultural revolution itself was sparked by 
an attack on a historical drama which seemed to assail Mao by 
analogy. Even without public debate, the anti-Confucius campaign 
literature has provided diverse opinions of historical characters 
and incidents, some of which seem to refleu: current struggles 
Two articles which appeared n PRC periodicals in November 
illustrate the problems involved in using historical analogies to

elucidate current debates. An article by Chai Ching in the 
Shanghai journal STUDY AND CRITICISM that favorably assessed 
the role of Taoism dlring the early Western Han dynasty seemed 
on its face to plead that Mao's wife Chiang Ching be allowed 
the title of ruler in return for agreeing to give power to 
Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping. An article by Lo Szu-ting in 
RED FLAG (No. 11) seemed on the other hand to accuse Chiang of 
collusion with regional leaders and the Russians. 
Closer examination of the article and of previous works by the 
two authors, however, casts doubt on both interpretations. Chai's 
article in STUDY AND CRITICISM seemed to furnish clear analogies 
with current personalities in discussing the succes1 leadership 
succession system of the early Han, the dynasty credited by PRC 
historians with consolidating the overthrow of the slave system 
by the feudal system. Chai recalled the achievements of dynastic 
founder Liu Pang and his Prime Minister Hsiao Ho and noted that 
after their deaths Liu's widow Empress Lu, "according to Liu 
Pang's wishes," appointed Tsao Shen as second prime minister of 
the dynasty. Tsao, one of Liu's generals who changed his 
political views while holding a previous civil post, "made no 
changes at all" and closely followed the rules of his predecessor. 
Liu Pang's son, the young Emperor Wei, who "failed to understand" 
Tsao's purpose, was allowed no power. 
The historical analogies seem clear--Liu Pang is Mao; Hsiao Ho 
is Chou; Empress Lu is Chiang Ching; Tsao Shen is Teng Hsiao-ping; 
and Emperor Wei would probably be either Yao Wen-yuan or Wang 
Hung-wen. But Chai's message is less certain. The content of 
the article and Chai's previous published articles make it seem 
unlikely that he is one of the Chiang Ching's cultural cadres plear'ing 
that she be allowed titular leadership in return for not inter-
fering in the affairs of state. Chai wrote several previous 
articles during the ideological campaign, including a previous 
STUDY AND CRITICISM article in May 1974, a RED FLAG article in 
Novembe- 1973, and a PEOPLE'S DAILY article in August 1974. The 
latter two articles dealt with teaching materials and the theory 
of knowledge, stressing the importance of book learning while 
noting that such knowledge must not be divorced from practical 
application. Chai's previous STUDY AND CRITICISM article, a study 
of the legalist Han Fei of the Warring States period, concentrated 
on Han's administrative reforms. 
Lo Szu-ting's article, in RED FLAG No. 11, noted that Sung Empress 
Dowager Kao supported those who opposed the reforms of Prime 
Minister Wang An-shih, and that those "diehards" whom she supported

were responsible for abandoning large tracts of land to aggressors 
on the northern borders. The analogy would thus seem to 'indict 
Chiang Ching for supporting forces advocating conciliation of the 
Soviet Union. However, Lo has at least twice referred favoi-ably 
to the role of the Empress Lu, and in RED FLAG No. 8 he specifically 
noted the opposition of Liu Pang and the Empress Lu to local 
secessionist forces who wanted to surrender to the "slaveowner 
aristocrats of the Huns to the north of China." Thus either Lo has 
made a very abrupt about-face, or not all of his references to 
empresses refer to Chiang Ching. 
CHAI-LO DIFFERENCES While it is inconclusive whether Chai and 
Lo disagree on the status of Chiang Ching, 
there are decided differences between the two on the historical 
role of Taoism, a debate with general imp1i2ations for the question 
of successfully handing down power. Lo's three articles on the 
Chin- early Han period concentrated on the Chin's failure to be 
sufficiently harsh, and they condemned compromise. Chai's current 
article, on the other hand, makes a virtue of eclecticism and 
argues strongly that consolidation of a regime following the transfer 
of power from one class to another requires stability. Chai's 
emphasis on stability seems generally conscnant with Peking's recent 
stress that the ideological campaign turn toward unity and production, 
but he skirts dangerously close to dispensing with Mao's theory of 
intraclass contradictions. 
Chai traces the history of the early Han--with special mention given 
to the role played by yet another empress dowager--to illustrate 
that the system worked; he declares that the Marxist assessment of 
a theory is determined by how well it meets the requirements of 
social practice. He concludes that the Han system of legalism under 
the cloak of Taoism met "the objective condition in which a stable 
situation was needed by the landlord class to consolidate its 
position," Chai pulls back from presenting the situation as completely 
stable, however, noting the occurrence of "zigzag struggles" and 
criticizing "local secessionist forces." 
Chai's specific approval of Taoism as a means to an end, and his 
sanctioning of the doctrine of inactivity, even for a special case, 
puts him out of the mainstream of comment during the anti-Lin and 
Confucius campaign. According to Chai, Taoism originally appeared 
during the Spring and Autumn period, when it represented the "lower 
stratum" of the slaveowning class which was opposed to the 
Confucianism of the slaveowning aristocrats. To drive home his 
point, Chai stresses Laotzu's opposition to Confucianism, states

that "in criticizing the Confucianists at this point" the Taoist 
and legalist schools were relatively close together, and even 
claims that "the legalists approved of Taoism, while the 
Confucianists opposed Taoism." 
Chai's assessment is completely at odds with that of Lo Szu-ting, 
who warned in RED FLAG No. 4 of 1974 against eclectic, 
reactionary trends of thought. While Lo has not specifically 
addressed himself to Taoism of the .2.ar1y Han period, his comments 
on Taoism generally, including mentions of Laotzu and Cl-in 
dynasty Taoism, vary sharply from Chai's assessment. Lo'F. 
article in RED FLAG No. 4 attacked the Taoist idea of "doing 
nothing" and presented it as an ally of Confucianism because it 
reflected a desire to return to the past. Lo recalled that one 
of Emperor Chin Shih Huang's prime ministers, Lu Pu-wei, asked 
the emperor to become an inactive puppet and allow Lu to rule. 
With obvious reference to attempts to get Mao to retire, Lo 
pointed out that such an action would have paved the way for the 
return of Confucianism. Lo also showed little respect for 
stability, criticizing the nominalist school of thought for 
saying that "when the country is governed in the nominalist and 
legalist way, nothing will be disturbed." According to Lo, this 
illustrated the nominalist fault of "reconciliation and compromise." 
Lo's first article during the anti-Confucian campaign, 'in the 
same November 1973 issue of RED FLAG as Chai's first article, had 
also criticized Lu Pu-wei, noting that he superficially 
accommodated all schools of thought but essentially represented 
the Confucian school "and also adopted the Taoist school." That 
article also presented both schools as essentially favoring the 
continued rule of the decadent slaveowning class.
