 August 1,2, 1966         CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 of both capital investment and consumption
 in the economy.
 PRAYER AMENDMENT NOT NEEDED
 Mr, TURT E.    Mr. President, the
 Subcommittee on Constitutional Amend-
 ments, presided over by my junior col-
 league from Indiana, has been holding
 hearings this week and last on the Dirk-
 sen resolution to send to the States for
 ratification an amendment dealing with
 school prayer.
 It was my privilege to testify on that
 resolution on Monday, at which time I
 pointed out that in three successive Con-
 gresses I have offered' a Senate resolu-
 tion to clarify the misunderstanding sur-
 rounding the Supreme Court ruling, and
 to state that it is the sense of the Senate
 that any public school system may pro-
 vide time during the school day for
 prayerful meditation, if no public official
 prescribes or recites the prayer which is
 offered.. To do so, I am convinced, is
 perfectly proper, and it has so been held'
 by a considerable number of constitu-
 tional authorities, relying upon the views
 Of the Supreme Court itself.  I com-
 mended to the subcommittee considera-
 tion of my resolution, Senate Resolu-
 tion 248, and stated, "I do not believe
 there is a -necessity for an amendment
 to the Constitution of the United States.
 in order to permit `voluntary participa-
 tion by students or others in prayer'" in
 our schools.
 The Evansville Courier, in its August 7
 Issue, discussed the same question and
 took the same point of view, heading its
 editorial "Amendment Not Needed." Mr,
 President, I ask unanimous consent that
 this editorial and my testimony before
 the Judiciary Committee may appear in
 the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 and statement were ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:
 AMENDMENT  NOT  NEEDED
 There is no need for an amendment to the
 Constitution permitting voluntary prayers
 in the public schools.  On the contrary,
 there are most persuative arguments against
 thus meddling with the sound doctrine of
 the separation of church and'state.
 That doctrine has served the nation well.
 It has safeguarded against both state in-
 terference in religion and church interfer-
 ence in the affairs of government.  Religious
 freedom has been assured by the provision
 that "Congress shall make no law respecting
 an establishment of religion, or 'prohibiting
 the free exercise thereof."
 Senator DIRKSEN's proposed amendment
 would  imperil  this  historic  freedom by
 weakening the First Amendment guarantee.
 Specific authorization for prayer in  the
 schools  would  undermine  the    Supreme
 Court's ruling on this subject, which upheld
 the First Amendment guarantee by banning
 use of state institutions and facilities-that
 is, the schools-to foster religious worship.
 This position is not tantamount to being
 against worship, against religion.  Not at all.
 It is every American's constitutionally guar-
 anteed right to worship as he pleases, and
 not to worship if he pleases. He can pray at
 home, in church, at his job, in the street-
 in short, anywhere.  But to authorize prayer
 or other religious exercises as a part of the
 public school routine would be to in ject,
 the state, into this private matter of con-
 science and belief,
 No. 133--4
 This is not to say that Senator BAYH'S
 judiciary subcommittee should not hold its
 scheduled hearings in August; of course it
 should hold them,  Those on both sides of
 this issue should be given full opportunity to
 be heard.  It is hoped that, once this has
 been done, the wisdom of preserving)the his-
 toric doctrine of the separation of church
 and state will be more widely appreciated.
 STATEMENT BY  SENATOR VANCE HARTKE BE-
 FORE THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE ON CON-
 STITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS, AUGUST 8, 1966
 Mr. Chairman, I am happy to come before
 this subcommittee, presided over by my col-
 league from my own state of Indiana, in
 order to speak briefly on the question of
 prayer in the public schools.
 I share with Senator  DIRKSEN  and with
 most Americans not only our common Amer-
 ican heritage of religious traditions but a
 -personal religious faith.  I believe in the
 values of religion, and I believe those values
 should be inculcated in the young.  I also
 believe in the wisdom of the framers of the
 First Amendment, in the correctness of the
 Supreme Court's interpretation of it in the
 decisions which have inspired the Senate
 Joint Resolution now before you, and in the
 desirability of prayer, each in his own way.
 The first of the so-called school prayer
 decisions came during 'the 87th Congress.
 Following it, I first introduced a Senate
 Resolution, S. Res. 356, expressing the sense
 of the Senate that the Supreme Court's de-
 cision in no way interfered with the right of
 public school systems to set aside a time dur-
 ing the school day for prayerful mediation
 so long as no public official prescribes or
 recites a prayer which is offered.
 In the succeeding 88th Congress, I again
 offered substantially the same resolution, S.
 Res.  164.  Since no consideration was af-
 forded it by the Judiciary Committee in
 either case, I again presented it as S. Res.
 248   of  the  88th  Congress.  Thus  I have
 taken the same position on this matter con-
 sistently and officially since 1962.
 I realize that this resolution is not before
 this subcommittee, since it is not a consti-
 tutional amendment, but rather a simple
 resolution expressing the sense of the Senate.
 However, I note that after four years since
 its original introduction an increasing num-
 ber of persons, including witnesses before
 this committee, have taken essentially the
 same view.  In particular, James V. Panoch,
 who also happens to come from Indiana but
 with whom I have not consulted on the mat-
 ter, devoted a good deal of his testimony to
 support of the principle that a period of med-
 itation, such as my resolution speaks of, is
 not only permissible under the Supreme
 Court interpretation, but a desirable option
 which avoids the pitfalls of the proposed
 amendment.
 Likewise, Professor Paul A. Freund, who
 teaches constitutional law at Harvard Uni-
 versity, testified here on August 1 directly
 in line with the Senate Resolution which
 has now been before the Judiciary Commit-
 tee in three successive Congresses:
 "But in any event, if a period of brief
 prayer is wanted, there is a simple way to
 have it: A moment of silent meditation, dur-
 ing which each pupil may commune either
 in prayer or other form of solemn thought,
 as his upbringing and his spirit may prompt.
 This would be a truer form of religious vol-
 untarism than  any schoolroom prayer in
 unison."
 Other distinguished lawyers, such as Dean
 Willard Heckel of Rutgers Law School, in
 the 1964 hearings before the House Judiciary
 Committee, have held that a time for silent
 prayer or meditation is not a violation of the
 Constitution or_the Supreme Court's rulings.
 At least threeg State Attorneys General have
 eressed, themselves as in agreement with
 the .positp V  my, resolution sets forth.  Robert
 18363
 Matthews, Kentucky, has found nothing ob-
 jectionable in a student saying a prayer,
 either silent or vocal, "during a period of
 meditation."  Pennsylvania's Attorney Gen-
 eral Walter E. Alessandroni finds no restrain-
 ing upon  "unorganized,  private,  personal
 prayer" in school, such as brief meditation
 period would give a minute for doing. Mas-
 sachusetts       Attorney  General  Edward      W.
 Brooke found that there is no constitutional
 bar to the law passed by the Massachusetts
 state legislature earlier this year, under which
 at the beginning of the school day every
 Massachusetts teacher "shall announce that
 a period of silence not to exceed one minute
 in duration shall be observed for medita-
 tion."
 Mr. Chairman, I do not believe there is a
 necessity for an amendment to the Constitu-
 tion of the United States in order to permit,
 in the language of the Dirksen resolution,
 "voluntary  participation  by  students  or
 others in prayer" In "any school, school sys-
 tem, educational institution or other public
 building,"  Rather, as others have pointed
 out before this body, the wording of the
 proposed amendment, and particularly the
 words "providing for" such "voluntary par-
 ticipation" on the part of school authorities,
 may well cause confusion and violation of
 the  traditional separation  of  church  and
 state.
 Consequently I commend to you as an al-
 ternative recommendation by the Judiciary
 Committee of S. Res. 248, whose text I would
 like to have appear in the hearings at the
 end of this statement.
 CHINA AND VIETNAM
 Mr. McGOVERN.  Mr. President, the
 istinguished scholar and author, Mr.
 Edgar Snow, has written a significant
 piece entitled "China and Vietnam"
 which appears in the July 30, 1966, issue
 of the New Republic: The article opens
 with the arresting statement:
 The United States is at war with China-
 a proxy war now but perhaps a war of irre-
 versible expansion.
 I ask unanimous consent that Mr.
 Snow's article be printed at this point in
 the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 7
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 CHINA AND VIETNAM
 (By Edgar Snow)
 GENEVA.-The United States is at war with
 China-a proxy war now but perhaps a war
 of irreversible expansion.
 I hope this view may be proved mistaken,
 but it seems that history may date the onset
 of  a  Sino-American  war  from  President
 Johnson's fateful decision, soon after his
 inauguration in  1965, to reject a neutral
 Saigon (then in the offing) and to forestall
 it by an air invasion of North Vietnam, cov-
 ering a large-scale U.S. occupation of Viet-
 nam's hinterland.
 Hanoi and Peking regard American leaders
 as rational, though wrong, so they concluded
 that the American objective was political
 hegemony over Vietnam.  It was logical for
 them then to anticipate eventual bombing
 of metropolitan Hanoi and Haiphong, which
 events in June confirmed.  The June bomb-
 ings in turn have probably sealed off remain-
 ing possibilities of intervention by nonin-
 volved powers to bring about a cease-fire.
 There is no known way to restore broken
 eggs or remake history.  With the crippling
 of North Vietnam's main industrial bases,
 Ho Chi Minh has little alternative other
 than commitment to a protracted war of re-
 sistance.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE          August 12, 1966
 Increasingly, Ho must perforce integrate
 his efforts with Chinese strategy, and China
 itself now has no choice but to provide Ho
 with support bases to compensate for con-
 tinuing American attrition and devastation.
 That means that the political and military
 center of resistance is shifting to China, as
 earlier it shifted from South Vietnam to the
 North.
 Finding the United States to be an aggres-
 sor in Taiwan, in Vietnam, and in other
 "neo-colonial" positions in Asia, Peking has
 formally proclaimed a doctrine of moral and
 legal  rights  of _ "counter-aggression".  No
 early dramatic swooping down into South-
 east Asia of "hordes" of Chinese troops is
 likely, however.  Just as there has been no
 single moment when the American people
 understood that they had gone to, war against
 Vietnam, the war against China may be with
 us for months or perhaps years before direct
 combat occurs between the two forces.  For
 the present China will probably concentrate
 on improving logistical means: the develop-
 ment of new feeder roads into Southeast
 Asia, the supply and replenishment of food
 and weapons, replacement and expansion of
 technical personnel, and volunteer manpower
 on demand.  U.S. sanctuaries in Thialand,
 Laos, Taiwan, Korea, Hongkong and perhaps
 Japan, may all be faced with the new prob-
 lems of a political or para-military character.
 China will do what it can to demonstrate that
 the American task is not simply to "seek,
 find, and destroy" those who resist, but how
 to reduce the mounting demands of an un-
 ending occupation.  Not how to get more
 troops into Asia but how to limit the com-
 mitment.  And not how to win military vic-
 tories but how to locate a center of political
 decision to  contain Asian history under
 American control. The American problem
 will be a great magnification of what is al-
 ready is today: in brief, how to disengage.
 Mao Tse-tung probably has no illustion that
 effective "counter-aggression" may not, in
 the end, result in an extension of Johnsonian
 punishment to China Itself.  China's partici-
 pation in the war will therefore continue to
 be cautious, with maximum effort withheld
 until or unless Chinese territory comes under
 direct American attack.
 Above all, Ho and Mao probably count on
 Practical Politics (much as Russia relied on
 Old Man Winter against Hitler) as their best
 ally in the long pull.  The unpopular war is
 costing, according to Secretary MacNamara's
 understatement, a billion dollars a month, or
 about $400 a second, yet 90 percent of South
 Vietnam is still unoccupied by the Ameri-
 cans.  The North's human reserves have
 scarcely been tapped; behind them lies a sea
 of Chinese manpower.
 Britian  cannot-not  even to  save  the
 pound-go along much longer, Wilson having
 been obliged to remove the "Anglo" sign be-
 fore new American escalations.                  A swollen
 U.S. war budget, accompanied by inflation, a
 steady gold drain, and widespread public fear
 of a dollar-pound devaluation, are paralleled
 by political second thoughts in the homes of
 unwilling draftees and a nervous down-trend
 in Wall Street.  Even if the war can be con-
 fined to Vietnam during the next two or three
 years, ever rising costs necessary to begin to
 stabilize the occupation and keep the satel-
 lite generals in nominal power in Saigon will
 total somewhere between 50 and 100 billion
 dollars-quite enough money to bring to a
 standstill what remains of the Great Society
 operation, just at the time Mr. Johnson must
 once more appeal to the national electorate.
 True, some wry satisfaction may be derived
 from the ruins of North Vietnam's industrial
 beginnings. But inherently well-intentioned
 Americans must feel uneasy at the thought
 that these "successful strikes" are achieved
 in a gamble that at any moment could pro-
 voke cataclysmic reprisals on American air-
 craft carriers by Soviet bombers, than only
 the absence of pressure on a button in Mos-
 cow prevents that retaliation, and that, If it
 came, no law exists to condemn such action
 which has not by now been repeatedly vio-
 lated by the United States.
 Cruel as the punishment has become :for all
 Vietnamese, bleak as the outlook is for any
 early surcease of pain, illusory or distorted
 as their analyses of Mr. Johnson's internal
 difficulties may prove to be, they would. seem
 to have not more to lose now by waiting for
 time either to reveal an eventual American
 repudiation of the whole disastrous adven-
 ture by voting in a change of Administration,
 or for the harassed President to fulfill his
 threat to carry on a protracted war for years
 rather than withdraw.
 And yet, China would have had it other-
 wise,  As late as January, 1965, both Ho Chin
 Minh and Mao Tse-tung probably still be-
 lieved that a protracted war with the United
 States could be avoided.  In that month Mao
 himself told me that he recognized the possi-
 bility of convening an international confer-
 ence to enforce terms of the Geneva Treaty
 of 1954 without the prior withdrawal of
 American personnel then in South Vietnam.
 A neutral independent Saigon government
 would then have been acceptable to Peking.
 Mao's  expectations  were  upset  when  the
 United States transformed Vietnam's civil
 war into international war.  Since then the
 Chinese Communist leadership has engaged
 in a deep and bitter debate.
 In December, 1964, Premier Chou En-lai
 had promised the National Congress that
 China's draft Third Five Year Plan would
 be submitted for public examination early
 in 1965.  That plan was already being dis-
 cussed among higher party echelons before
 and after China tested her first nuclear de-
 vice, and it was known that no great increase
 in the defense sector was indicated.  After
 February, however, press references to the
 Third Plan ceased to appear.
 Apart from revamping the economy to de-
 vote a major sector to defense industry, great
 questions faced Peking's leadership.  What
 should be the character of China's military
 strategy against the United States?  If war
 was unavoidable, would it not be prudent to
 mend fences with Russia?  China's own de-
 fenses were not adequate to protect her urban
 industrial bases against heavy American air
 attack.  What would be Russia's price for
 providing an air defense umbrella?  To sub-
 mit to Moscow and revisionism was unthink-
 able; to subject to American destruction the
 results of nearly two decades of sacrifice to
 modernize China was also unthinkable. Yet
 both had to be thought through.
 Acceptance of the Russian line would mean
 a compromise in Vietnam which would leave
 the United States firmly planted in Southeast
 Asia. If Vietnam were surrendered, why not
 Taiwan?  And if Taiwan were abandoned,
 why not concede American dominance In
 general, accept a secondary role for China,
 and seek alms from the United States, like
 India?  This reverse view of the dominoes,
 collapsing inward on China, could lead to the
 conclusion that capitulation to Russian. pres-
 sure was synonymous with capitulation to
 the United States abandonment of the revo-
 lution as well as vital national interests-
 and suicide for the Chinese party leadership.
 Between such  extremes,  however there
 exist various possibilities of limited Chinese
 compromise with the Russians in order to
 secure  minimum  guarantees  of  support
 against the  United  States. Marshal Lin
 Piao has emerged as the spokesman for the
 dominant view, which simply invokes all the
 experienceof the Chinese revolutionary wars
 to prove Mao's old thesis, man is more im-
 portant than weapons; the only kind of war
 China could fight and win, alone, is a pro-
 tracted war dependent essentially on man-
 power, space, and resolute social revolution-
 ary leadership based on unrevised Ma~rxist-
 Lenninism.  The presence of large American
 armies in Asia makes Mao's kind of war pos-
 sible, and the more Americans the better.
 China would suffer, there could be no doubt
 about that, but there could also be no doubt
 (according to Lin) about the ultimate vic-
 tory.
 Today one sees in China a process called
 "the great cultural revolution."  Its aim is
 completely to unify theory and mass prac-
 tice based on the thought of Mao-Tse-tung.
 Those who took up losing positions during
 the critical debate concerning correct policy
 toward the VS and Russia must now submit
 to a remolding of their thinking.  They em-
 brace  party  members.  How  many?  Not
 more than five percent, according to the of-
 ficial press, and yet already these include two
 members of the Polithoro.  The charge is
 "revisionism." Used against veteran Corn-
 munists long indoctrinated by Mao's teach-
 ings, and with a lifetime of practice in the
 politics of the Chinese revolution, "revision-
 ism" can only be regarded as a euphemism to
 describe an intra-party opposition defeated
 on a major decision, which could have in-
 volved a transfer of power.
 An American victory in Vietnam for want
 of aid from Russia and China would not only
 impose  a profound  loss of  prestige from
 which the whole world socialist movement
 might   never  recover,  but conceivably  it
 could lead to wars between socialist national-
 isms.                                                                                                                                       China could blame Moscow for a de-
 feat in Vietnam, but that could not alter Its
 shattering effects not only on Mao's prestige
 as a world revolutionary leader and doc-
 trinaire, but also on the future of China as
 a major power with vital national interests
 at stake.  That is why, even without Russia,
 China probably cannot permit the United
 States to decide the fate of East Asia by
 intensified bombing of Vietnam-or, for that
 matter, of China Itself.  In the latter event
 the war would Indeed "know no frontiers,"
 as Ch'en Yi has said, and the Chinese under-
 stand that in the end the Russian Commu-
 nists themselves could not survive the de-
 struction of China.   The outcome of that
 brutal dilemma could be world war.
 Meanwhile, what of the many peace plans
 advanced to prevent further "widening of the
 war"?  The trouble with them is that those
 liked by President Johnson are conditioned.
 by negotiations to be conducted while Ameri-
 can troops occupy large areas of Vietnam,
 while those liked by all Vietnamese leaders
 in. the unoccupied areas require an uncon-
 ditional guarantee of United States with-
 drawal and respect for other terms of the
 Geneva Treaty of 1954 violated by the Ameri-
 can presence.  For the Vietnamese to accept
 Mr.  Johnson's  conditions  would  concede
 legality to the American occupation, while
 for Mr. Johnson to accept Vietnamese con-
 ditions would mean abandonment of the
 objectives of the intervention.  That is why
 the war goes on and will likely expand.
 EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION
 Mr. MAGNUSON.  Mr. President, at
 the close of last session, I submitted a
 progress report on the development of
 educational television in which I set forth
 the problems and progress as well as the
 facts and figures relating to educational
 television.
 The Educational Television Facilities
 Act, which I sponsored and which was
 enacted in 1962, has made possible direct
 Federal support for educational televi-
 sion stations.  Grants have been made
 on a matching basis with States for de-
 veloping new stations and for expansion
 of existing facilities, and almost 100 ap-
 plications have been accepte since that
 time.
 I stated then that educational televi-
 sion had passed through two important

 Their argument was, In part ? that it
 would cost more than high schooltrain-
 Ing for young men of high school age.
 My reply then was the same as it is
 tonight: "What 'do you think it costs
 to keep a young man who is not rehabil-
 itated in prison?  How much do you
 think it costs to take care of years of
 public welfare? How much  do you
 think it costs as a result of the loss to
 society of the economic contribution he
 can make to our economy if he has de-
 veloped into a sound, wage earning
 citizen?"
 I am not moved by the argument that
 some of these job training centers to
 rehabilitate young men to make them
 useful citizens cost more in some in-
 stances than it would cost if they did
 not need rehabilitation and went to a
 standard high school.
 Mr. President, this happens to be a
 serious social problem that confronts us.
 I insist that it is a wise investment to put
 these young men through the type of job
 training centers, under the program
 being  developed,  of  which  Sargent
 Shriver is the head.  Regardless of the
 cost, it is an economic investment, and
 it is one that we ' should be willing to
 invest in.
 My answer to these critics is that every
 cent we invest in a worthwhile project
 which gives true recognition to human
 values and which prepares these young
 people for useful roles in our society is
 worth the cost even though it may be
 higher than that which is computed in
 educating young people who enjoy the
 good fortune of not being afflicted with
 poverty, and who have not lived in an
 environment that has produced the prob-
 lems that have been produced in these
 young people we select to put through
 these job training centers.
 It is becoming more and more evident
 that the Tongue Point Training Center,
 although confronted by enormous prob-
 lems at the outset, Is now beginning to
 demonstrate its real value to our society.
 In that connection, Mr. President, I was
 pleased to read an article which appeared
 in the July 26, 1966, issue of the Los An-
 geles Times, entitled, "Hopes Look Up for
 Job Corps Camp in Oregon."  I com-
 mend this article to the attention of my
 colleagues because I think it points up
 the importance of the fine work that is
 being done at present at Tongue Point
 and the extremely encouraging prospects
 for even greater contributions from this
 Job Training Center in the future.
 In addition, I would riot wish to let this
 occasion pass without paying tribute to
 the fine staff of educators and admin-
 istrators who are performing such dedi-
 cated and outstanding work at the Job
 Corps Training Center.
 I ask unanimous consent to have the
 article to which I have referred inserted
 There being no objection, the article

 OIEGON-SECOND YEAR OF OPERATION FINDS
 DECLINE , IN  DROPOUTS,  MORE            QUALIFIED
 (By Ed Meagher)
 TONGUE POINT,OREG.-The first-year record
 of the Job Corps 'Center here could hardly
 have been worse-162 boys were graduated,
 compared with 534 who quit or were thrown
 out as too tough to handle.
 Racial violence broke out at the center,
 and in nearby Astoria, student brushes with
 police were all too frequent.
 But now, halfway into its second year, the
 record is a little brighter.  Costs, which in
 the first year amounted to about $12,500 a
 boy, are dropping, and the ratio of grad-
 uates to dropouts is rising.
 However, the center, one of eight estab-
 ished by the Office of Economic Opportunity,
 still has a long way to go before breaking
 out of the experimental woods.
 HARD-CORE UNEMPLOYABLES
 Operated under government contract by
 the  University of Oregon and the Philco
 Corp., the center was envisioned as a place
 to provide school dropouts with basic educa-
 tion and a vocation to move them out of the
 ranks of hard-core unemployables into the
 respectable mainstream.
 The trouble is, thus far, fewer than a third
 of the students have made the leap.  Not
 only that, critics say, but the center's costs
 are out of line.
 Douglas V. Olds, director of the Tongue
 Point center, believes the program is worth-
 while.
 "We expect," he said, "soon to be grad-
 uating from 75 to 100 students a month.
 They will thereafter be off the welfare rolls,
 with prospects good that their children will
 not be on them later as adults.
 "Usefully employed graduates will have an
 estimated life expectane   f $100,000 in earn-
 ings. Some of this will be returned to society
 in taxes."
 MANY BUILT-IN PROBLEMS
 Any program that could effect such a social
 transition in a substantial way would seem
 to be a bargain, regardless of cost.
 But Tongue Point and the other Job Corps
 centers, investigation indicates, have so many
 built-in problems that critics believe they
 should be returned to the drawing board or
 scrapped entirely.
 The Office of Economic Opportunity's de-
 termination to bring about instant integra-
 tion to the centers may be blamed for one
 of the problems.
 The Tongue Point center (and the others
 as well) was established as an interracial, in-
 tercultural and interregional melting pot.
 Students come from all 50 States. Almost
 half, 43%, are Negroes.  Seven per cent com-
 prise Mexican-Americans, Indians and Ha-
 waiians.
 FROM  DIVISIVE  BACKGROUNDS
 They arrive from such divisive backgrounds
 as city slums and the hills of Appalachia,
 from small towns and isolated farms.
 The only things they have in common-
 poverty, ignorance and too often a festering
 problem of Immaturity-are hardly the in-
 gredients to promote togetherness.
 Other built-in problems, in center director
 Olds-' view, have to do with the roinimuxri
 age of 16, which he believes is too low, and
 the screening of applicants which, while im-
 proving, still leaves much to be desired.
 The screening is done at youth opportunity
 centers   and   state   employment   offices
 throughout the country.
 "Screening seems to be improving gen-
 erally."                                                                                Olds said, "but recently we were
 sent a youth on parole following his con-
 viction on auto theft and assault charges.
 Another came from a mental Institution."
 Trainees are supposed to have had at least
 a fifth grade education, but, according to
 --Olds, a number of illiterates have been sent
 to Tongue Point.
 -      SOCIAL OUTLETS
 Still  another  problem  inherent  to this
 center is the unavailability of social outlets
 normal, to young men.
 Astoria is a small town of less than 10,000.
 Most residents are fishermen and their fam-
 18435
 flies  are  of  Scandinavian  and  Finnish
 descent,
 No Negroes live within its boundaries.
 Thus, out of necessity, social affairs for
 the trainees are centered almost entirely in
 Portland, about 100 miles away.    Because
 of the distance, students are restricted to one
 weekend visit there a month.
 Transportation and lodging at the YMCA
 are provided by the government and dances
 and other mixed social gatherings are ar-
 ranged under auspices of the Portland Urban
 League and other organizations.
 However, center officials admit that oppor-
 tunities for the students to make outside
 contacts are too limited.
 DRAWN FROM SCHOOLS
 Olds was recruited by the university from
 the Springfield (Ore.) School District, where
 he was assistant superintendent. Most of his
 staff were drawn from Oregon schools.  Few
 had experience with students such as those
 who came to Tongue Point.
 "Academic and vocational training of the
 students is comparatively routine," Olds said.
 "Trying to make responsible men out of some
 of them is what takes most of our time and
 understanding and patience."
 "There    is no doubt, however," he con-
 tinued, "that most of these boys are well
 worth saving.. It is tremendously satisfying
 to see young men develop skills and exhibit
 definite leadership qualities within a matter
 of a few months."
 Dale Owen, head of the center's art depart-
 ment, agrees.  One of his students, Paul Mc-
 Caskill of Miami, is an inspired professional
 painter, to be taken seriously right now, ac-
 cording to Owen,  The University of Oregon
 invited McCaskill to exhibit his works at a
 one-man show.
 Neither Arthur S. Flemming, president of
 the University of Oregon, nor Olds denies
 that the first year's costs seem unreasonable.
 But both have pointed out that substantial
 amounts were needed to meet nonrecurring
 expenses and predicted that expenses per boy
 will be more than halved during this fiscal
 year,  to  about  $5,300,  when  enrollment
 reaches capacity of 1,250 students this fall.
 "Although this may seem too high," Olds
 said, it must be remembered that we operate
 the year around and pay all of the students'
 expenses, including medical and dental."
 But reducing the center's other problems
 to a reasonable size remains to be accom-
 plished.
 The age minimum should be raised, Olds
 recommends, and students should be as-
 signed to centers in their own region.
 Olds does not see Job Corps centers as the
 ultimate answer to the problem of salvaging
 school dropouts.
 "In time," he said, "I think their function
 should be turned over to the nation's public
 schools.   But, meanwhile, the centers are
 building up a body of knowledge and expe-
 rience that will be invaluable to any program
 that follows.
 "I believe they are worthwhile," Olds said,      y

 HIS EXCELLENCY,

 Cambodia.
 DEAR  SIR:      Your  cablegram commending
 my statement of July 25 was deeply appreci-
 ated.              Be assured that I greatly admire your
 efforts to maintain the sovereignty and dig-
 nity of your country, and the safety of your
 people, amid the trespasses and provocations
 being committed against Cambodia.
 It remains my hope that the nations of
 the world still on the sidelines will step in
 to stop the war in Vietnam before it engulfs
 more people.  The parties to the war seem
 no longer to have the capacity either to stop
 it or to limit its scope.
 Respectfully yours,
 WAYNE MORSE.
 Mr. MORSE.  Both documents speak
 for themselves, but in view of the fact
 that the head of the Cambodian Gov-
 ernment referred to a public statement
 that I made at a press conference, I ask
 unanimous consent that there be printed
 in the RECORD at this point a copy of the
 press release which I issued on July 25,
 when that group of American citizens
 who call themselves "Americans Want
 to Know" held a press conference before
 they left for Cambodia.
 There being no objection, the press re-
 lease was ordered to be printed in the
 RECPRD, as follows:
 STATEMENT BY ,SENATOR  MORSE  ON  "AMERI-
 CANS WANT To KNOW" TRIP TO CAMBODIA
 "Americans Want to Know" are to be com-
 mended for undertaking a fact-finding mis-
 sion to Cambodia to determine whether the
 war is spreading to that country, and if so,
 at whose instigation.
 We have the tragic picture in Southeast
 Asia  of  American  financial  and  military
 power being brought in in massive quanti-
 ties on the ground that the United States
 must stop Chinese aggressiod on the borders
 of China. 'How many millions of people and
 how many nations are to be made party to
 this endeavor is a question no American out-
 side the inner councils of the Administration
 can really answer.
 We hear daily rumors of intrusions into
 Cambodia by the Vietcong and by American
 forces in pursuit of them.  We already know
 that Thailand is for all practical purposes
 swallowed up in the American encirclement
 of China.  We know that the 1962 Accord on
 Laos is a thing of the past, observed only in
 diplomatic lip service.
 The tragedy of Belgium, which twice was
 trampled in contests between great powers,
 is being repeated in Southeast Asia.  Fortu-
 nately, there are still some Americans who
 believe that the many countries who rank
 below the great power level are entitled to
 exist without serving as steppingstones for
 great powers.
 The record of the last five years demoll-
 strates, that far from preserving the right
 of these Asians to live their own lives and
 run their own countries, we are competing
 with the Communists in trying to take them
 over before the other does.  We and the Com-
 munists have dragged Laos into the war;
 we and the Communists are dragging Thai-
 land into the war; we and the Communists
 are  endangering  the Philippines over the
 war; and we and the Communists apparently
 are determined that Cambodia will not fall to
 the other if her sovereignty and soil have to
 be destroyed to prevent it.
 The pious cloak of humanitarianism with
 which the Administration seeks to disguise
 our nationalist aims in Southeast Asia is
 belied by the facts.  The facts are that we
 are not bringing any Great Society to Asia;
 we are destroying the societies of Asia, great
 and small, that existed long before our own.
 A nation that has not yet created a Great
 Society at home, nor produced progress by
 alliance in Latin America, is hardly the coun-
 try that is  going to  remake  Asia  except
 through air power and artillery.
 Many of as hope that Cambodia can yet
 be saved from the fate of South Vietnam,
 North Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand. I com-
 mend these Americans for their effort to
 preserve the truth in a welter of nationalism,
 jingoism,  and  flag-waving.  I congratulate
 them and I wish them well in their journey.
 Mr. MORSE.  I await with great in-
 terest the official report of this group of
 American citizens upon their return to
 the United States. I have been reading
 the newspaper stories about their visit
 to Cambodia, and what some of them
 have said, or allegedly have said, in var-
 ious interviews in Japan and elsewhere
 But I shall await their official statements
 upon their return to the United States
 with great interest.  Apparently their
 visit to Cambodia was approved by the
 head of the Cambodian Government, and
 I judge that they were given complete
 access to take trips wherever they wished
 within that country while they were
 there.
 THE AIRLINE STRIKE
 Mr. MORSE.   Mr. President, :1 ask
 unanimous consent to have printed in
 the RECORD an editorial entitled "Still
 No Planes," published in the New York
 Times of 2 days ago, and an article en-
 titled "Are Mechanics Overpaid?" writ-
 ten by Stanley Levey, and printed in the
 Washington Daily News of Thursday,
 August 11, 1966.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 STILL No PLANES
 The  chance  that  strikebound  airliners
 might get back aloft on the wings of a volun-
 tary arbitration agreement seems to have
 been shot down even before the union rank
 and file is asked to pass on it.  Strike lead-
 ers, still staggering under the membership's
 overwhelming rejection of the wage agree-
 ment they joined President Johnson in en-
 dorsing, obviously have no appetite for going
 back to the strikers now with the arbitration
 proposal made by Chairman Staggers of the
 House Commerce Committee and accepted at
 once by the employers.
 Putting the disputed wage issues up to
 an impartial board for review represents the
 soundest road now open for resolving a con-
 flict in which layer after layer of governmen-
 tal intervention has effectively eliminated
 any possibility of return to "free collective
 bargaining."  The union has already turned
 down a Presidential emergency board's rec-
 ommendation of increases that exceeded the
 old anti-inflation guideposts.  It has spurned
 a pact calling for much higher increases ne-
 gotiated at the White House.                                                                                    In turning its
 back on arbitration, it plainly counts on the
 Administration to use its influence with the
 tightly regulated airlines to go higher still-
 no matter how much of a shambles it makes
 of the whole stabilization program.
 The only defense against the success of
 this tactic lies in passage of the back-to-
 work bill now awaiting action in the House.
 Acceptance of voluntary arbitration would
 have averted the need for another step to-
 ward compulsion in labor relations, but the
 union preferred economic muscle to reason.

 IT'S   NOT  A     NUMBERS   GAME  TO   AIRLINE
 STRIKERS: ARE MECHANICS OVERPAID?
 (By Stanley Levey)
 The current rage here is playing the num-
 bers game with wage rates.  Depending on
 your point of view, you can prove that strik-
 ing airlines mechanics are overpaid, under-
 paid, or paid just right.
 But to members of the International Asso-
 ciation of Machinists it's not a, game.  And
 because they rejected the White House set-
 tlement 2 weeks ago and will service the
 planes when they fly again, their sentiments
 carry clout, in the Washington idiom.
 Airlines mechanics believe they are under-
 paid-not in general, not on the average, and
 not statistically.  Specifically, they feel they
 are getting less money in cities where they
 are concentrated than workers with compa-
 rable- or lesser skills and responsibilities.
 Of the 35,000 striking workers, 19.000 are
 mechanics.  Of the latter 12,000 are licensed
 by the Federal Aviation Agency and must sign
 out (or certify) the engines, electrical equip-
 ment, and frames of planes they repair.
 FIGURES CITED
 These employees-the most vocal and mili-
 tant in the union and in short supply-cite
 the following figures to prove they are under-
 paid at the present rate of $3.52 an hour, or
 would be under the rejected White House
 settlement which would have raised their
 hourly rate to $4.08 by mid-1968.
 In New York City, garbage truck mechanics
 for the Sanitation Department receive $4.53
 an hour.  In Denver the rate for city auto and
 truck mechanics is $4.05; in San Francisco
 it is $3.91.   Greyhound mechanics in the
 West now get $4.61, and in 1968 will get $5.09.
 Greyhound machinists rates will go to $5.21
 in 1968 from the current $4.74.
 San Francisco auto and truck mechanics
 are paid $4.33 an hour.  Electric utility main-
 tenance mechanics in Chicago earn $4.10.
 The same clagses of workers receive $4 in
 New York, $4.14 in Detroit and $4.10 in St.
 Louis.
 UNION FEELING
 The union contends there has been a sharp
 rise in wages for construction workers in
 major population centers where its members
 perform comparable duties at generally lower
 rates.  In Denver, for example, the current
 hourly rates for seven unionized building
 crafts, not including employer-paid fringe
 benefits, are:                         -
 Bricklayers, $4.70; carpenters, $4.41; elec-
 tricians,  $4.77;  painters,  $3.97;  plasterers,
 $4.55;  plumbers, $4.51;  laborers, $3.02. In
 other cities, such as Chicago, Los Angeles,
 Miami, Minneapolis, New York, San Fran-
 cisco and Washington these rates are even
 higher.
 Sen. WAYNE MORSE (D., Ore.), chairman of
 a presidential Emergency Board which rec-
 ommended other settlement terms in the air-
 lines dispute that were rejected by the union,
 recently had printed in the CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD  a memorandum comparing airline
 rates with those of comparable industries.
 The report sought to counter IAM claims
 that airlines workers are underpaid.

 The interesting thing is that the
 American troops have replaced South
 Vietnam troops to a striking degree.
 The South Vietnam troops have been too
 busy quarreling among themselves.  But

 can troops into North Vietnam.
 There was a press conference some
 days ago with Mr. Dean Rusk.  Again I
 say that if one wishes to know what Rusk
 says in a press conference, one should
 pay more attention to what is between
 the lines than what is on the lines, for
 one always has to be ready for double-
 talk.         In that press conference the Sec-
 retary of State refused to exclude the
 possibility of sending American troops
 into North Vietnam.
 May I say to the American people that
 that is the beginning of this administra-
 tion's propagandizing you to get ready
 to put American ground troops into
 North Vietnam.
 If we do, Mr. President, we increase
 the danger of an all-out war in Asia. I
 do not intend to support it. It is not jus-
 tified. It is immoral, obviously illegal.
 Mr. President, we have to get back to
 the framework of international law. We
 cannot follow this unilateral aggressive
 course of action. When I say unilateral
 and aggressive, I mean with respect to
 the ___at powers of the world who .are
 for marching into North Vietnam.
 I hope that the leaders of my Govern-
 ment will recognize that, after all, we
 ought to place our professings about re-
 ligious principles above the immoral
 course of conduct that, as a nation, we
 are following in Asia.

 LAKE MICHIGAN POLLUTION MUST
 BE HALTED
 Mr. HARTKE.  Mr. President, during
 the last few days, a matter of serious
 concern has been brought to me as the
 Senator from Indiana; a matter of con-
 cern to the people of my State; and
 certainly to all the people of the Great
 Lake States.  The Army Corps of Engi-
 neers is dumping at least 75,000 yards
 and perhaps as much as 160,000 cubic
 yards of polluted filth into a 70,000 acre
 area of Lake Michigan.   This recent
 "sludge" has been dredged from the
 North Branch of the Chicago River. The
 corps, for navigation purposes, is remov-
 ing it to increase the depth of the chan-
 nel from 9 to 12 feet in some areas
 and 21 feet in others.
 The dumping of this "sludge," some
 13 miles off the shoreline into Lake
 Michigan further increases the pollution

 upon Chicago to do so.
 As to the total problem of water pollu-

 that situations such as the dumping from

 Dismal Swamp Plays Vietnam Role
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. HARRY F: BYRD, JR.
 OF VIRGINIA
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Friday, August 12, 1966
 Mr. BYRD of Virginia.  Mr. President,
 I ask unanimous consent to have printed
 in the Appendix of the RECORD a news
 article published in the Baltimore News
 American on Friday, July 29, 1966, en-
 titled "Dismal Swamp Plays Vietnam
 Role." This article was written by Ruth
 Montgomery of the Hearst Headline
 Service.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 DISMAL SWAMP PLAYS VIETNAM ROLE
 (By Ruth Montgomery)
 GREAT DISMAL SWAMP, VA., July 29.-In this
 primeval jungle once partly owned by George
 Washington,  paratroopers  are  now  being
 trained in survival techniques before tackling
 the similarly swampy terrain of Vietnam.
 This 750-square-mile swamp, consisting of
 dense  forests,  an  eeirie mirror-lake and
 feeder canals, is unique on the North Amer-
 ican continent.                    Within its mysterious con-
 fines, some of it so impenetrable that it has
 never been explored by men, are ancient trees
 which were probably alive at the time of
 Christ.
 The,  cypress  and  juniper  trees  which
 abound in the swamp and even grow in Lake
 Drummond itself make the waters too acid
 for bacterial growth to develop.  Thus the
 dismal swamp is one of the few still-develop-
 ing peat bogs in the nation.
 Among the more curious aspects of this
 wilderness is the huge lake, which is like a
 round dimple in the earth's crust.  Higher
 than the surrounding land on three sides,
 and totally isolated from the fashionable
 tidewater area by dense jungles, it was prob-
 ably formed 6,000 years ago when the eastern
 continental shelf sank beneath the sea for
 the last time.
 Its water is the color of dark topaz but so
 pure that in the days before refrigeration sea-
 men filled their casks from the lake because
 the water remained fresh for months at sea.
 Reached by boat from the Intercoastal
 Waterway, through a tree-shaded canal sur-
 veyed by George Washington, Lake Drum-
 mond is no more than three feet deep at any
 point. Its water is said to have such thera-
 peutic qualities that during early Virginia
 history serious thought was given to develop-
 ment of, the swamp as a health resort.
 In  1763 Washington and  five  partners
 formed a company called "Adventures for
 Draining the Dismal Swamp," and acquired
 40,000 acres of the best land.
 Credit for digging an access canal goes to
 Patrick Henry who, as governor of Virginia,
 persuaded the assembly to finance the build-
 ing of the waterway, with locks to lift boats
 to the higher-lying lake.
 Today, as then, Great Dismal teems with
 black bears, deer, foxes, bobcats, opossums,
 rattlesnakes, cottonmouth moccasins, bats,
 heron, other wild birds of every description,
 and grey moss.  It is a hunters' paradise-
 and a veritable Garden of Eden for ornothol-
 ogists who gather each spring and fall to ob-
 serve the bird migrations.
 As is inevitable in today's world, the serene
 wilderness is threatened with despoilment by
 avaricious man.  A company which bought a
 four-square-mile portion of the swamp has
 recently  stripped  it  bare,  felling  all  the
 juniper trees to make fence posts-and de-
 stroying the cover for wild life.
 Sportsmen and bird watchers are fighting
 a commercial attempt to build a track and
 grandstand for stock-car racing.        Business
 interests are hungrily probing Great Dismal
 Swamp with an eye to potential industrial
 development, and some land companies are
 draining and developing acreage for farming,
 recreation and housing projects.
 Such encroachment by spectator sports-
 men, industrialists, hot dog operators and
 litterbugs would endanger one of our few
 remaining unspoiled  areas  which has  inL
 spired many romantic legends and lyrical
 writings by Henry Wadsworth    Longfellow,
 Harriet  Beecher  Stowe  and  Sir   Thomas
 Moore.
 Among  the  hardy conservationists, who
 hope to save the virgin wilderness is Mary
 Tayloe Gwathmey of Virginia Beach, a direct
 descendant of the distinguished Tayloe fam-
 ily which built Octagon House, the historic
 mansion occupied by President James (and
 Dolly) Madison after the British burned the
 White House.
 The rescue of Great Dismal Swamp from
 the developers would be a worthy project
 for Lady  Bird Johnson,  whose  laudable
 beautification program is trying to restore
 beauty already debased by men.
 Surely it would be even better to rescue
 a natural wilderness before it is despoiled.
 No. 1 Efficiency Rating Awarded to VA
 Office,  Waco,  Tex.,  Jack  Coker,
 Manager
 SPEECH
 OF
 HON. WRIGHT PATMAN.
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, August 2, 1966
 Mr. PATMAN.                                     Mr. Speaker, seldom
 do our public officials receive the recogni-
 tion they deserve.                                                                                                 For that reason, I was
 delighted that one of the best, Mr. Jack
 Coffer, manager of the VA Regional Of-
 fice at Waco, Tex., and his outstanding
 staff, who serve over 700,000 veterans,
 were recently awarded the No. 1 effi-
 ciency rating for achieving the highest
 productivity rate of any VA office in the
 United States.  The fine work that tie
 Waco office performs daily in behalf of
 veterans is well known to me and other
 Members served by this regional office,
 and we have long been grateful for the
 services of Mr. Coker and his excellent
 team.
 The Waco Tribune-Herald of July 31
 took note of this award-winning per-
 formance, and.under leave to extend my
 remarks, I include the article at this
 point:
 WACO  VA  OFFICE  MOST  EFFICIENT
 WASHINGTON.-The       Waco Regional  Office
 of the Veterans Administration has achieved
 the highest productivity rate of any VA of-
 fice in the United States, it was revealed to-
 day by Congressman OLIN E. TEAGUE.
 The top productivity rating, which means
 greatest efficiency in operation, was for the
 fiscal year which ended June 30.
 Representative  TEAGUE,  chairman of the
 House Veterans Affairs Committee, wired his
 congratulations to Waco VA Manager, Jack
 Coker.
 "Your efficient and effective management
 of matters pertaining to benefits to veterans,
 their dependents and war orphans, is to be
 highly  commended,"  TEAGUE's  message  to
 Coker said.
 "This   achievement is all the more sig-
 nificant because of the unique and difficult
 problems the Waco office has faced in the
 past several years, not the least of which
 were a major consolidation and a move to
 new quarters.
 "Your  effectiveness in better serving the
 veterans of Texas at less administrative cost
 to the taxpayers is especially appreciated by
 your elected representatives who must answer
 to the people for the efficiency of their gov-
 ernment.                                                                                                                                    You have established an outstand-
 ing example of efficiency and economy for all
 in government to follow.  Please extend my
 personal congratulations to every  employe
 of your operation in making the Waco VA
 Regional Office the outstanding office in the
 country," TEAGUE'S telegram said.
 The congressman added:  "I have always
 harbored a belief that Texans can do almost
 any job better, and your outstanding per-
 formance despite major handicaps, strength-
 ens  that  conviction.  Keep  up  the  good
 work."
 Congressman W. R. POAGE of Waco wired
 Coker:
 "The Waco VA office long has had a fine
 record of productivity.  I was not therefore
 surprised  to  learn     that  your  office  was
 selected  as  the  outstanding  office   in the
 United States having the highest productiv-
 ity rating in the nation.  I congratulate you
 and I look forward to the establishment of
 even greater records.    Please extend my con-
 gratulations                                                                                                                                           and  best wishes  to      all your
 employes . . .
 The productivity rating of VA offices is
 based on the amount of work turned out in
 every phase of operation, from top manage-
 ment to messenger service.
 The Waco Regional Office, which covers one
 of  the  largest  land  areas  (two-thirds  of
 Texas) and administers one of the heaviest
 loads of benefits (over 700,000 veterans)   of
 any VA office, is ranked No. 1 in competition
 with all VA offices in the United States.
 William J. Driver, administrator of -vet-
 erans affairs in Washington, announced the
 top rating earned by the Waco VA Regional
 Office.  "The result of efficiency of operations
 is better service to the veterans of this na-
 tion, who so ably served their country in
 time of need," Driver said.
 Waco Manager Jack Coker said that "I am
 extremely proud of our employes and their
 achievements  and  the  top  productivity
 rating.

 "This record resulted from the dedication
 of every employe in the organization to do a
 better job.  They have a great capacity for
 excellence and recognition."
 Since 1963 the Waco VA office has con-
 solidated regional offices formerly located at
 Dallas and Lubbock, both of which were
 larger than the original Waco VA office.
 The Waco VA office only this year moved
 into new quarters on Valley Mills Drive, a
 building which was dedicated formally by
 Administrator Driver.
 The man-hours of work required by con-
 solidation and moving were not subtracted
 in the efficiency calculations, Driver said, but
 were included  in  computing the rating,
 which makes the achievement even more
 outstanding.
 The Waco VA Regional Office administers
 to  164  Texas counties,  extending  from
 border to border.  VA offices in Dallas, Lub-
 bock, El Paso and Midland are supervised
 by the Waco staff. Contact offices at Vet-
 erans Hospitals in Waco, Dallas, Amarillo,
 Big Spring, Marlin, Temple and Bonham also
 are under Waco regional office supervision.
 More than 500 employes staff the regional
 office, according to Ray Todd, assistant man-
 ager.               Be said the new GI Bill, adding Viet
 Nam and those who served after Korea, has
 increased  the  workload  which  is  being
 handled by the existing Waco work force.
 David Goodwin, management analysis offi-
 cer, said many new management techniques
 instituted by the Waco VA office have helped
 to increase productivity.
 John R. McCarroll, chief, administrative
 division, said that there  are more than
 675,000 veterans' files utilized in the work
 of the Waco office.
 Coker said copies of Congressman TEAGUE's
 telegram will be forwarded to all VA offices
 In the region.
 Glyndon Hague, former manager of the
 Waco office and now special assistant to the
 chief  benefits  director,  praised  Manager
 Coker and the employes of the Waco office.
 There is no doubt about it," Hague said,
 "Jack Coker is one of the outstanding execu-
 tives in the federal government and the em-
 ployees of Waco VA have virtually performed
 miracles during the past four years.  If
 every government office did its job as well as
 Waco VARO the administrative problems in
 government would all but disappear. These
 people are tremendous."
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. STROM THURMOND
 OF s6trru CAROLINA
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Friday, August 12, 1966
 Mr.  THURMOND.   Mr.  President,
 there appeared in the Saturday, Au-
 gust 6, 1966, issue of the Charleston
 News and Courier an editorial entitled
 "Firearms Control." In view of the in-
 creased public interest in this area, I
 wanted to call attention to this editorial,
 as it strikes at the heart of this issue in
 a brief and concise way. This is a sub-
 ject which concerns all of us, ancc I can-
 not help but feel that these comments by
 News and Courier editor, Thomas R.
 Waring, are worthy of consideration by
 all Members of the Congress, as well as
 the American public.  Therefore, I ask
 unanimous consent to have this editorial
 printed in the Appendix of the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 FIREARMS CONTROL
 Gov. John Connally has very sensibly, in
 our view, declined to add his voice to those
 demanding a control law on firearms,
 No sooner had the massacre occurred at
 the University of Texas campus than advo-
 cates began to plead their cause.  But Gov.
 Connally, whg was seriously wounded by Lee
 Harvey Oswald when President Kennedy was
 assassinated, said that none of the laws Con-
 gress is considering would have kept Charles
 J. Whitman from getting the weapons he
 used In his rampage.
 Had a firearms registration law been in
 effect in Texas, Charles J. Whitman would
 have qualified for the purchase and posses-
 sion of weapons.  He was a good short, hav-
 ing been trained in the Marine Corps.  He
 was instructing Boy Scouts in the use of a
 rifle.  He was a university student with a
 good record.
 If supporters  of a firearms control law
 could   demonstrate  that  legislation would
 keep weapons out of the hands of psycho-
 paths, they would be heeded.  The slaughter
 in Austin does not buttress their ease.  Like
 prohibitionists who insist that sin is in the
 bottle, these advocates blame the gun in-
 stead of the finger on the trigger.
 Constructive Peace Suggestion
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. DONALD RUMSFELD
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 1, 1966
 Mr.                                        RUMSFELD.  Mr.  Speaker,  a
 suggestion for exploring the possibilities
 of peace in Vietnam was made some 6
 weeks ago by Mr. Charles H. Percy of
 Illinois.
 On July 2, 1966, Mr. Percy stated in
 part :
 America's escalation of the war in Vietnam
 in ? recent days makes it imperative that we
 now quicken and intensify our efforts to
 seek a just peace ... If we must accelerate
 the war-as the Administration believes we
 must--then let us also accelerate the pur-
 suit of peace.
 As we all know, the enemy has indicated
 that he Is not prepared to negotiate directly
 with the United States.  Therefore, I urge
 a new approach to end this tragic war.
 I earnestly suggest that a conference of all
 Asian nations be called to work toward a
 settlement of the Vietnam war.  I further
 suggest that such a conference could  be
 called by U Thant, Secretary-General of the
 United Nations.  Himself an Asian, U Thant
 enjoys the confidence of both East and. West,
 and would exert an influence clearly free of
 national self-interest.
 No one could guarantee the success of such
 a conference, but it is an approach worth
 trying,.
 Mr. Speaker, the concept of Mr,?.Per
 cy's suggestion has since gained the sup-
 port of former President Dwight D.
 Eisenhower,  Senate  Majority  Leader
 MIKE MANSFIELD of Montana, Foreign
 Minister Thanat of Thailand, Senator
 THRUSTON B. MORTON of Kentucky, and
 various other leading Americans and
 foreign diplomats.
 I offer for the RECORD comment on the
 Percy  peace  proposal  by  Columnist
 Charles Bartlett as follows:
 [From the Washington Evening Star, Aug. 11,
 19661
 SEPARATING STATECRAFT, POLITICS
 (By Charles Bartlett)
 The outsider's predicament in separating
 statecraft from politics and gimmickry from
 diplomacy in the public dialogue on Viet
 Nam will become acute before the 1966 con-
 gressional campaign grows much older.
 The problem is illustrated by events that
 have flowed from a July 2 statement by
 Charles Percy, the Republican candidate for
 the  Senate  in  Illinois.  Percy  gave  voice
 that day to an idea developed by him and his
 staff.  He proposed a conference of Asian na-
 tions to work towards a solution in Viet
 Nam.
 "No one could guarantee the success of
 such a conference," Percy declared, "but it is
 an approach worth trying.  Perhaps an Asian
 conference would be only a beginning.  But
 let us begin.
 The Percy proposal did not create any im-
 mediate stir.  His opponent, Sen. PAUL DouG-
 LAS, brushed it off as "half-baked."  But on
 July 8 Dwight Eisenhower, contacted by in-
 termediaries, wrote Percy a short letter in
 which he praised his idea as "worthy of seri-
 ous consideration."
 At the last minute on July 12, President
 Johnson expanded a scheduled speech to the
 American Alumni Council in West Virginia
 into a national telecast.  He talked at length
 of building political and economic strength
 among the Asian Rations and declared that
 these nations  "must pull together in the
 same broad sweep of history."
 On  July  20,   Sen.    THRUSTON   MORTON,
 persistently concerned with the fortunes of
 Republican candidates, put Percy's proposal
 in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD with the com-
 ment that an Asian initiative towards peace
 might bring Hanoi to the negotiation table.
 On Aug. 3, Thanat Khoman, the foreign
 minister of Thailand, called on the Asians
 "to take our destiny into our own hands" and
 to convene a conference, in Asia not in Ge-
 neva, to thrash out a settlement of the war.
 This will be the first time in history, Thanat
 said, that the Asians have taken "full charge
 and responsibility for their affairs."
 On Aug. 6 Secretary of State Dean Rusk
 described Thanat's proposal as a "construc-
 tive  suggestion"  whose  development                                                                                                                                     the
 United States will follow with interest. On
 Aug. 8, the Democratic leader in the Senate,
 MIKE  MANSFIELD, said  the idea was  "ad-
 mirable."
 On the same day the Percy camp released
 Eisenhower's  letter and the  Republicans
 moved toward making the Percy proposal a
 party position.
 It is impossible to assert flatly that the ad-
 ministration persuaded Thanat to take this
 initiative in order to blunt the political ef-
 fectiveness of Percy's proposal. One point can
 be made, however.  Nothing like this has
 ever come out of Bangkok before.  The Thais
 are deeply committed to a thesis that the
 only way to win the war is to wage it.
 The Percy-Thanat proposal was put for-
 ward at a time when there has been abso-
 lutely no hint from Hanoi of a readiness to
 negotiate.  The uselessness of convening a
 conference at this stage has been implicit in
 the response to Thanat's invitation by most
 of the Asian nation's, especially North Viet
 Nam and Communist China, who rejected it
 flatly.
 Percy's timing had obvious motivations.
 His statement coincided with the intensifica-
 tion of his political campaign and the accele-
 ration of the bombing in North Viet Nam.
 Thanat's timing did not seem to concur with
 any particular? developments In Asia.  OE-

 destroy Greek culture nor extinguish the
 Greek determination for freedom. That
 spirit, has revitalized the history of
 Greece this past century and a half.
 Nineteen years ago the ties between
 Greece and these United, States were
 sealed in this Congress when the Truman
 doctrine came into being.
 We declared it to be our enduring
 policy everywhere to support free peo-
 ples who are resisting attempted sub-
 jugation by armed, minorities or by out-
 side pressures.
 In 1947 our power and our purse were
 opened to Greece to turn back the tide
 of communism that threatened to engulf
 that land-and we lifted a great country
 out of the depths of despair and set it
 anew on the course of its realwdestiny.
 In some measures we repaid our cen-
 turies-old debt to Greece.. So here in the
 Capital City of Washington there is a
 greeting especially warm for those who
 by their blood look back to that storied
 land-and today by their splendid citi-
 zenship help to maintain America as a
 land that cares-a land that dares to
 care for people who want to stay free.
 So I say again-welcome to the Order of
 AHEPA.
 Mr. MAGNUSON.  Mr. President, I
 heartily subscribe to everything  the
 Senator said.
 Mr. PASTORE. I thank the Senator.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, while the
 Senator from Rhode Island is still in the
 Chamber, I, too, would like to pay a word
 of tribute to the Order of AHEPA, the
 great organization of men and women of
 Greek extraction who will be meeting in
 Washington next week; and also to pay
 my tribute to the spirit of freedom in
 Greece today, which in the Greek-
 Turkish aid program of 1948, when I
 served in the other body, I had a small
 hand in helping.
 I should like to tell my good friend
 from Rhode Island, however, that we
 have also modernized our interest in
 Greece.  I have the honor to be the
 chairman of a committee of the NATO
 Parliamentarians Conference for Greek-
 Turkish Economic Cooperation.  I also
 have the honor to inform my colleague
 that this committee is adequately fi-
 nanced by a contribution from the Ford
 Foundation and from American business
 in the amount of $300,000, and that it
 is working extremely effectively in co-
 operative projects, such as the one in
 Mauritius in northern Thrace which is
 underway.  I have every hope that if
 the situation in Cyprus does not prevent
 us, we will be able to bring about a really
 historic institutionalization of economic
 cooperation between these two countries,
 in the great spirit of the Venizelos-
 Ataturk accord which, for over 30 years,
 Skouras, of New York, serves on the ad-
 visory board which has been put togeth-
 er to deal with this matter.  I thought,
 in the spirit of the occasion, with the
 fine leadership of my beloved friend the
 Senator from Rhode Island, he might
 be interested in these facts.
 Mr. PASTORE.  I certainly ani, and
 I want to thank the Senator from New
 York for bringing them out.
 I reiterate that_ the Senator from. New
 York is a great American, a great hu-
 manitarian, and I am proud to have his
 friendship,
 Mr. JAVITS.  I thank my colleague.
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio.  Mr. President,
 I wish to associate myself with the elo-
 quent statement of the distinguished
 senior Senator from Rhode Island [Mr.
 PASTORE]  in paying tribute to an out-
 standing organization, the  Order of
 AHEPA, on the occasion of its 44th su-
 preme convention to be held in Wash-
 ington, D.C., next week.
 AHEPA, the American Hellenic Educa-
 tion and Progressive Association, is the
 leading organization in this country of
 Americans of Greek descent.  In. wel-
 coming the members of this fine orga-
 nization to Washington, I pay tribute to
 the millions of Greek-Americans who
 have  contributed   immeasurably  to
 American culture, and to their ances-
 tors who fought hard for the independ-
 ence of their native land.
 AHEPA is an organization devoted to
 44 years of progress and accomplish-
 ments in the fields of American citizen-
 ship, education projects, and charitable
 endeavors.  The AHEPA fraternity is an
 object lesson in successful cooperation.
 Mr. President, in Ohio there are thou-
 sands of citizens of Greek descent, many
 of whom are among the outstanding
 leaders in all fields of endeavor.
 Recently, it was my privilege to rec-
 ommend to President Johnson that he
 nomination as U.S. judge for the north-
 ern district of Ohio, Judge Thomas D.
 Lambros, of the court of common pleas
 of Ashtabula County, Ohio.  He is the
 son of Demetrios P. Lambros and the late
 Panagoula K. Lambros, who both emi-
 grated to the United States from Greece
 in the early 1900's.  When he assumed
 the office of common pleas judge in Jan-
 uary 1.961, Thomas Lambros became the
 youngest, common pleas judge in Ohio.
 In 1964, he was named one of the out-
 standing young men in America by the
 U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce. He
 is an outstanding example of the great
 promise of our Nation.
 Mr. President, our country's present
 greatness is the result of our ability to
 Educational Progressive Association.
 The Order of AHEPA and its auxil-
 iaries, Daughters of Penelope, Sons of
 Pericles, and Maids of Athens, is an or-
 ganization dedicated to foster and per-
 petuate the ideals and principles of Hel-
 lenic art, philosophy, and culture in
 America. AHEPA has over 700 chapters
 in 49 States and in Canada. I am proud
 to state that I have been a member of
 this outstanding organization for many
 years.
 As a nation, we are indebted to ancient
 Greece, for it was from that civilization
 that our own forefathers drafted the
 concepts of liberty, freedom, and de-
 mocracy. The style of our architecture,
 our theater, our literature, abounds in
 the tradition of Hellenism.  Socrates,
 Plato, Aristotle, Pericles, Homer, Sopho-
 cles, Aristophanes, and a host of other
 ancient Greek names echo our linkage
 with the past.  Even the concept of the
 atom was first perceived by the philoso-
 pher Democritus.
 We have come to be a mighty force,
 but we still are indebted to the con-
 temporary sons of Greece, who were the
 first to stop Mussolini and his Fascist
 hordes as they invaded the Balkan Pe-
 ninsula. It has been stated, and properly
 so, that this was a feat comparable to
 the defense of Thermopylae by Leonidas
 and his 300 valiant Spartans.  The
 Greeks for the first time had shattered
 the myth of Axis invincibility and, as a
 direct result, the Allies were given a
 much needed opportunity to regroup
 their forces.
 Today modern Hellenes continue to
 uphold the classical tradition of excel-
 lence in the fields of science and art.
 Dr. Papanicolaou, one of the world's
 foremost authorities in the detection of
 cancer, and Georgios Seferis, winner of
 the Nobel Prize for Literature, are among
 many of the modern Greeks who have
 been true to their heritage.  The list of
 those successful in all fields of endeavor
 is endless.
 The essence of AHEPA and what its
 membership stands for is perhaps best
 exemplified in the AHEPA creed:
 Promote loyalty to the United States of
 America;
 Respect the inalienable rights of mankind;
 Strive for the betterment of society;
 Abhor all political corruption;
 Defend and protect all oppressed people
 everywhere;
 Cultivate the noblest attributes and high-
 est ideals of true Hellenism;
 Labor for the perfection of a moral sense,
 the spirit of altruism and true benevolence;
 Champion the cause of education;
 Love God and man, and hope for happi-
 ness.
 blend the aspirations of peoples from    Ahepans are to be commended for their
 every land toward the advancement of     use of these noble precepts and lofty
 common goals.  This country Is very      ideals as guidelines for the practical im-
