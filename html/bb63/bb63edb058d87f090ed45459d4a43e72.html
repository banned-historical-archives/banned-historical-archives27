 EAST-WEST RELATIONS
 BITTER MOSCOW PEKING RECRIMINATIONS FOCUSED ON TEST BAN TREATY
 The conclusion of the partial test ban treaty evokes an out-
 pourifig  of acrimonious propaganda, with Moscow citing the
 treaty as concrete proof of the correctness of the Soviet policy
 of peaceful coexistence and Peking characterizing it as a
 nuclear fraud perpetrated with the imperialists to maintain
 the nuclear monopoly.  The increasingly vitriolic exchange is
 climaxed by the 31 July CPR Government statement which charges
 the USSR with betrayal of the Soviet and other socialist people,
 and the 3 August Soviet response which characterizes the CPR
 statement as "impudent" and again accuses the Chinese of trans-
 ferring ideological differences to the realm of state relations.
 This bitter propaganda exchange is followed by a direct and
 violent confrontation at the Hiroshima anti-nuclear weapons
 conference.  The Chinese delegate, according to NCNA, went so
 far as to charge that the USSR cannot be trusted to live up to
 the 1950 treaty of mutual alliance.  This charge is the more
 brazen coming after the Soviet Government statement had pointedly
 asserted that its nuclear shield insures the security of the
 socialist countries "including the CPR."
 Moscow points up the "isolation" of the Chinese opponents to
 the treaty by stressing the overwhelming worldwide approval
 it has received, and Khrushchev at the 5 August signing
 ceremonies in Moscow said that many states, "including those
 in Asia and Africa," have expressed readiness to sign the ac-
 cord.  Propagandists claim that in addition to the Chinese,
 the treaty is opposed only by some "wild men" in the United
 States and by Bonn and Paris.  All of the pro-Soviet satellites
 promptly expressed their intent to sign the treaty.  However,
 Hanoi has joined Pyongyang and Tirana in echoing the Chinese
 argument that a partial ban is militarily advantageous to the
 west.
 Mo5cad Claims Soviet Initiative on Test Ban
 In line with the attempt to portray the test ban agreement as a result of
 Soviet "initiative," Khrushchev in his 26 July PRAVDA-IZVESTIYA interview
 speaks of the "many years" the USSR has been striving for a ban.  At the
 same time, he states that U.S. and British negotiators should be given

 their "due," a graceful gesture which he repeats at the 5 August signing
 ceremony, and leaves it to his propagandists to document in detail that
 it has been the Soviet Union which has led the way in test ban proposals,*
 Consistent with this claim of "initiative," Moscow, of course, obscures
 the similarity of the present treaty with the U,S,-British proposal
 of last Augusto  And predicatably the account of the President's 26 July
 TV speech omits his recollection that Washington and London had proposed
 limited test ban treaties in 1959, 1961 and 1962, as well as his ref-
 erence to U,S, attempts to control nuclear weapons dating back to the
 Baruch plane  Peking, of course, highlights the similarity between the
 treaty signed in Moscow and proposals advanced by the West to support
 its charge of Soviet capitulation,  And to further document the Soviet
 reversal, Peking media published textually past Soviet statements$ in-
 cluding those by Khrushchev himself, criticizing a limited test ban,
 In keeping with Moscow's cautious optimism about a further relaxation
 of tensions and agreement on at least partial measures, propagandists
 indicate that it is only isolated circles in the United States which
 oppose a detente,  Noting that some "wild men" in the United States are
 opposing the test ban treaty, commentators refer to the "Pentagon" and
 single out for special criticism Teller, and Senators Goldwater, Jackson,
 Dirksen and Thurmond,
 In keeping with the circumspect treatment of the President, the sub-
 stantial TASS account of his 26 July TV speech omitted passages bearing
 directly on the cold war such as his reference to the United States'
 having stood on the verge of direct military confrontation with the
 Soviet Union in Laos$ Berlin and Cuba,  TASS also omitted his statement
 that Western policies have sought to persuade the Soviet Union to forego
 direct or indirect aggression;** a home service commentator, however,,
 did say that his words about improving relations are incompatible with
 his "slander and attacks" directed at the Soviet Union, and specifically
 his statement that the USSR and other socialist countries should "re-
 pudiate their aggressive plans,"  But commentators for the most part
 .; Soviet audiences do not hear detailed accounts of past efforts for
 disarmament and a test ban,  But a 28 July commentary to Germany says
 it was not the "notorious" Baruch plan but the 1956 Soviet proposal
 which was the first imitative,  And a broadcast to Britain the day be-
 fore goes on from the 1956 proposal to list the May 1957 Supreme Soviet
 appeal, the 1 March 1958 Soviet unilateral moratorium, and the Soviet
 "initiative" on a test ban in November 1961,
 The NCNA account of the speech, which was interlarded with editorial
 comment calculated to point up Khrushchev's "capitulation," included
 this passage,

 played up his expression of hope that the test ban agreement would be
 followed by progress on other disputes.
 CPR Says USSR Agreement to Test Ban "Betrays" Soviet People
 While Moscow stresses Soviet initiative in achieving the test ban agree-
 ment and says that-it is proof of the correctness of its coexistence
 policy, Peking's attack on the Soviet role in perpetrating the nuclear
 fraud becomes steadily more acriminous and voluminous,  Thus, the
 31 July CPR Government statement--which continued to be rebroadcast
 through 6 August--goes beyond past indictments of the USSR to charge
 that it has betrayed the interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union,
 of the peoples of the socialist camp, including China, and of all the
 peace-loving people of the world,  The statement blatantly goes on to
 characterize Soviet policy as one of
 allying with the forces of war to oppose the forces of peace,
 allying with imperialism to oppose socialism, allying with the
 United States to oppose China, and allying with the reaction-
 aries of all countries to oppose the people of the world.
 Making explicit earlier clear implications that Peking would not be
 deterred from developing a nuclear capability, the Chinese statement
 says of the treaty that "it is unthinkable for the Chinese Government
 to be a party to this dirty fraud;"  However, there has been no echo of
 Kuo Mo-jo's 26 July statement that "it will not be long" before the
 nuclear monopoly is broken,* Consistent with propaganda since the 19 July
 PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial, the CPR statement points up the Soviet's
 about-face in agreeing to a partial test ban.  Thus, it again quotes
 Kuznetsov's 29 August 1962 Geneva statement that the U,S,-British partial
 test ban proposal would give them a one-sided military advantage, since
 it 'legalized" underground tests by which the United States could continue
 improving its nuclear weapons,  The Chinese statement also recalled Khru-
 shchev's similar remarks of 9 September 1961--after the Soviet decision
 to resume nuclear testing.
 A Prague broadcast in Serbo-Croat sees a discrepancy between this state-
 ment and the CPR proposal for destruction of all nuclear weapons,  Prague
 adds that.I'it is even stranger when we take into account the Sino-Indian
 conflict and Chinese maps of Asia with large territories of neighboring
 countries indicated as parts of China."  Peking has lashed out at Soviet-
 oriented parties for their attacks on the CPR, and the press and NCNA
 have carried detailed-reports of statements by the French, Italian, Czech,
 Bulgarian and GDR parties.

 The charges against the USSR voiced in the CPR statement are echoed
 in the 3 August PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial--blatantly entitled "This Is
 a Betrayal of the Soviet People"--which says that by its 180-degree
 turn, Moscow has betrayed not only "their own correct stand and the
 interests of the Soviet people, but also all those who had supported
 them."  The editorial in addition to repeating past public Soviet
 statements opposing a partial test ban, claims that this appeared to
 be the Soviet position "even up to early June this year,"  PEOPLE'S
 DAILY says that after the agreement to hold the tripartite Moscow
 test-ban talks, the Soviet Government had "formally" notified the CPR
 that the Western countries'position "could not serve as a basis for
 reaching an agreement" on a test band  The editorial goes beyond the
 CPR statement in its frontal attack on Khrushchev.  After saying
 that it is obvious that the treaty is aimed at tying China's hands,
 PEOPLE'S DAILY says
 Recently, while fraternizing with U0S, imperialism on the
 most intimate terms, the Soviet leaders and the Soviet press
 have gnashed their teeth in their bitter hatred toward
 socialist China,  They use the same language as U.S, impe-
 rialism to abuse China,  This is a U.S.-Soviet alliance
 against China pure and simple,
 Since the beginning of the talks, Peking has made sure that its audi-
 ence is informed about the warm friendly atmosphere in Moscow.  Thus,
 the 17 July NCNA dispatch on the opening of the negotiations quotes
 Western press reports at length on Khrushchev's good humor and con-
 viviality.  The NCNA press review for 29 July pointedly notes that
 PEOPLE'S DAILY publishes a picture of Khrushchev embracing Harriman,
 NCNA on 6 August cites REUTERS for the report that during the signing
 ceremony Khrushchev was "bubbling over with good spirits," and that
 he "went into a comic routine, pretending that his view of the signing
 was blocked by the six foot aide of Lord Home."  And a 7 August NCNA
 report that Secretary Rusk had accepted an invitation from Khrushchev
 to join him at a Black Sea resort says according to Moscow reports,
 Rusk was gratified by the warm reception he received in Moscow.  NCNA
 concludes with the information that "when Rusk and British Foreign
 Secretary Lord Home entered a Kremlin reception with Khrushchev on
 5 August, the band broke into 'Love Walked In,' by American composer
 George Gershwin,"
 CPR Pro uses World Disarmament Conference:  Peking's concern over the
 world wide approval which woul  greet a -test ban and China's isolation
 in opposing it is pointed up by the call, in the CPR statement, for a
 world summit conference to discuss nuclear disarmament.  As specific
 documentation of the claim of a consistent struggle  for peace and

 disarmament, the statement says that "as is known to the whole world,"
 the CPR long ago proposed the establishment of a nuclear free zone in
 the Asian and Pacific regions.  NCNA on 1 August carries Senior General
 Lo Jui-ching's statement of PLA support for the world conference pro-
 posal, and on 4 August Peking releases Chou En-tai's letter to the
 heads of all states formally advancing the proposal.
 The only major propaganda followup comes in the 2 August editorial
 ostensibly directed against the United States for saying that the
 Chinese proposal is so "sweeping and unrealistic" that it stood little
 change of being considered seriously.  PEOPLE'S DAILY says that all
 those who are sincere in defending world peace will welcome the proposal,
 and "only U.S, imperialism and its collaborators fear it," Earlier,
 the editorial says that U.S, dismissal of t e proposal shows U.S. in-
 tent to use, export, manufacture, test and stockpile nuclear weapons,
 And it adds that "the very words prohibition of nuclear weapons are
 not found in the much vaunted treaty."  The Soviet Government statement's
 dismissal of the proposal as "propaganda" has so far occasioned no
 direct reply from Peking,
 USSR Calls Chinese Charge of Betrayal "Impudent"
 Moscow did not acknowledge the CPR Government statement until it re-
 leased its scathing response on 3 August which characterized as "impu-
 dent" the charge that Moscow has "betrayed" the interests of the Soviet
 people.  The statement is published in all Moscow papers and PRAVDA and
 IZVESTIYA carry the text of the Chinese statement as well, with the
 prefatory note that the "shameful" document is unworthy of space in
 the Soviet press but is being carried so that the Soviet people may
 see "how far the Chinese leaders have gone."
 The Soviet statement says the Chinese have provided one more bit of
 evidence that they have transferred ideological differences to state
 relations, and that the USSR and "other socialist countries" regard
 the CPR attack as an unprecedented? most regrettahla act,  As though
 to point up the "correct" Soviet behavior, the statement in two separate
 passages notes that the Soviet nuclear shield has insured and will
 insure the security of the CPR as well as other socialist countries.
 The statement reveals some sensitivity, however, to Peking's charges
 of the reversal in the Soviet position on a test ban when it says that
 the CPR "in artificially selecting quotations,..forgets that science
 and technology are developing tempestuously, and what was unacceptable
 only yesterday might prove most useful today,"  Moscow says sarcastically
 that the test ban treaty can only be objected to by people who "cover up
 with flashy phrases about the most radical disarmament measures their
 lack of desire or readiness to achieve disarmament."

 The Chinese position on the test ban treaty was scored in a Yuriy.
 Zhukov article published in PRAVDA.. an__29 July' which expressed "astonish-
 ment" at "responsible" Chinese leaders acting in concert with the
 French to defend nuclear testing,  After the Zhukov article, a steadily
 increasing volume of radio and press commentary attacked the Chinese
 position,
 Moscow Says Nonaggression Pact Next Logical Step
 Moscow's elite and routine propaganda continues to give wide play to
 the notion that the test ban agreement should be followed by a NATO-
 Warsaw Pact nonaggression agreement,  Thus, Khrushchev in his 26 July
 interview places it in "first place" and--putting his own interpreta-
 tion on the 25 July communique--says agreement was reached in Moscow
 that after both sides had consulted with their allies, discussion should
 be continued with a view to reaching an accord,*  This interpretation
 was repeated in a 28 July home service broadcast, and in the 29 July
 PRAVDA editorial,  In his remarks, at the signing ceremony on 5 Augusts
 Khrushchev describes the nonaggression pact as the "next step," and
 the 3 August Soviet Government statement speaks of it as a "primary"
 task,
 While Khrushchev (and the 3 August statement) expresses concern for
 settlement of the German problem, he as well as lesser propagandists
 remain vague on the relationship between the nonaggression pact and
 this issue "on which the liquidation of international tension most
 depends,"  Reporting President Kennedy's 1 August press conference,
 TASS includes his remark that "we must,,,discuss the nonaggression

 discussed.  Khrushchev in his interview with PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA merely
 lists these measures (without specifying that the measures to prevent
 surprise attack include the establishment of ground control posts)
 and in his 5 August remarks he alludes only to "specific problems"
 which he has mentioned recently "more than once."  According to the
 TASS account of the 30 July plenary session in Geneva* Tsarapkin listed
 all of Khrushchev's partial measures with the exception of that for
 surprise attack.  And the account of the 1 August session notes the
 Bulgarian representative's suggestion that the Geneva negotiators dis-
 cuss a nonaggression pact, the proposal for the reducing of military
 budgets, and the creation of nuclear-free zones--which scattered com-
 mentaries continue to press as a desirable measure.
 Although proposals for a nonproliferation agreement are not pressed
 in current comment, Moscow has acknowledged various suggestions to this
 effect.  The TASS account of the President's 26 July speech includes his
 reference to the desirability of a further. limitation on the dissemina-
 tion of nuclear weapons.  And TASS on 30 July says that Lord Home
 indicated that along with surprise attack measures,"'!the next=.lggicil
 step" would be a nondissemination agreement.  Moscow also reports a
 similar statement by Macmillan.
 Although Khrushchev failed to mention underground tests in his 26 July
 interview, other propaganda including the 8 August PRAVDA editorial
 lists such a ban among problems that remain to be settled.  In his
 3 August message to the Hiroshima conference Khrushchev perfunctor.i}y
 spoke of the need to ban "all" tests.  Reportage on the Geneva talks
 includes expressions of interest by various delegates in banning under-
 ground tests.

 IIIROSHIMA CONFERENCE SCENE OF VIOLENT SINO-SOVIET DEPATE
 The 5 August Hiroshima anti-nuclear weapons conference was
 witness to the most severe public vituperation of the Soviet
 Union by China to date,  In unprecedentedly frank and detailed
 reports, both Peking and Moscow media have described a climactic
 verbal bout between their respective delegates in which the
 Chinese representative all but rejected the CPR's alliance with
 the Soviet Union and accused the Soviets of helping another
 country to attack them,
 At the same time, the Hiroshima conference revealed the disintegra-
 tion of the "peace movement" in the wake of the heightened
 Sino-Soviet dispute,  The conference was divided at its in-
 ception by a break in the tenuous alliance of the Japanese "left",
 as the socialist and Sohyo delegates withdraws in protest of
 communist manipulations, to form a separate conference.  Like-
 wise in. a dilemma over the widening Peking-Moscow rifts the
 Chinese-oriented Japanese Communist party showed signs of con-
 fusion over its own stand on the test-ban treaty,
 In view of the Moscow-Peking propaganda exchange over the test ban treaty,
 a debate at the Hiroshima conference was to be expected; however, the
 degree of bitterness of the exchange, acknowledged in broadcasts from
 both'. sides, is unprecedented,  Apparently Soviet delegate Yuri Zhukov
 replied to a Chinese attack on the test ban treaty by using the Cuban and
 Taiwan crises as examples of how the Soviet Union's nuclear might has
 protected the security of the 'bocialist camp"; he claimed that "more than
 once" we have "saved":the CPR from "attempts at aggression by Taiwan,"
 and he recalled that "we said bluntly that we would use atomic weapons
 to defend China,"
 In response, Chu Tzu-chi is reported by NCNA to have asserted, in party
 the following points:
 +  that the Chinese won their revolution "mainly by their own efforts,"
 and have "relied  on their own strength" to "discourage U,S, imperialism
 from attacking their country,"
 +  that "Zhukov's claim that the Soviet Union managed to protect China
 with its nuclear weapons was an insult to the Chinese people',"
 +  that Korea was strictly a Chinese victory and that the Soviets comma
 mited both the errors of "adventurism" and "capitulationism" in Cuba,

 4  that the Soviets not only do not help China but that they "and U.S.
 imperialism have been helping a third country with arms to attack
 socialist China,"
 +  that China cannot trust the alleged protection of Soviet nuclear
 power because the Soviets have "violated Lenin's teachings and the
 interests of the Chinese people, the socialist camp, and the people
 of the world," and have "betrayed the interests of the Soviet people,"
 +  that, by voting in favor of the dispatch of U.N. troops to the
 Congo, the Soviets "helped ...in the murder of Patrice Lumumba."
 +  that while the Chinese "can list 100 cases of your capitulation to
 imperialism," the Soviets will never be able to give a single case of
 Chinese capitulation.
 +  and? that the Soviets "show far less; courage, if any, than the
 Japanese religious circles."
 Moscow  Peking Pre-Conference Maneuvers:  In the 19 July PEOPLE'S
 MILY editorial Peking had revealed its concern that the conclusion
 of a partial test-ban treaty could cause the CPR to be estranged from
 the peace movement.  The editorial noted that "some kind-hearted
 people" may view even a partial test ban as a "step forward"; but
 that the imperialists must not be allowed to exploit the people's
 desire for an end to tests.  Peking's resolution to attempt to use
 the conference to garner opposition to the treaty was evident from
 the fact that Chinese speakers at the 1 August Peking rally supporting
 the Hiroshima conference concentrated on attacking the test ban treaty,
 The Soviet delegation seemed initially to be willing to try to avoid
 a direct battle with Peking,  However, after failing in an apparent
 attempt, through the efforts of the representatives of the World Peace
 Council, to give all overseas delegates the status of observers,
 rather then delegates, the Soviet delegation countered the-Chinese
 offensive by urging the conference to endorse the test ban treaty,
 Each side claims to have succeeded in its aim--Peking media emphasize
 the anti-imperialist content of the final conference report (which
 makes no mention of the test ban treaty); and Moscow claims$ in a
 7 August commentary on the conference, that the majority of the
 authentic representatives of the world's people supported the treaty
 and that the Chinese delegates "looked particularly out of place."

 fesse  to be neutral in the Sino- Quiet conflict but has in fact backed

 Peking's stand on important issues,  On the question of the merits of
 the test ban treaty, a particularly sensitive issue in Japan, the JCP
 has been inconsistent and seems to be attempting to avoid a direct
 rejection of the treaty,  Reflecting the dilemma;, a 24 July JCP AKAHATA
 editorial implies some credit for the expected test ban agreement is
 due the 1962 anti-nuclear weapons conference whose declarations and
 recommendations "have made great contributions to the suppression of
 imperialism,"  And a 29 July AKAHATA editorial declares that "the
 nuclear test ban agreement will have posit.va significance if it is the
 first step toward a world ban on nuclear weapons,"
 The 3 August JCP statement on the Hiroshima conference presents a
 position differing in emphasis significantly from the previous modicum
 of optimism by declaring that the view that "the treaty represents a
 'first stee  toward a reduction of the threat of nuclear war and to-
 war               wor   peace with a total ban on nuclear weapons'" does not "ac-
 cord with world reality in Japan,"  The JCP acknowledged its political
 problem when it proposed in this same statement that the conference
 "should not be forced" to pass a resolution supporting or opposing the
 treaty, "for the sake of preserving unity,"  The JCP's basic desire
 to maintain the unity of the Japanese groups in the anti-nuclear
 weapons movement was also given by the statement as the reason why
 the conference should similarly avoid a position on the question of
 opposing nuclear tests by "any" country--the issue which split
 last year's meeting,
 Having been unsuccessful in its attempt to prevent the polemics at
 the conference and to avoid the disintegration of the Japanese "peace
 movement," the JCP has publicly ignored the conference chaos,  Thus,
 the JCP statement on the "successful opening" of the conference passes
 briefly over the socialist-Sohyo walk-out of the first day, appealing
 to both to safeguard unity; and, AKAHATA has made no mention to date of
 the bitter Sino-Soviet exchanges,
 Peking has reproduced in its press JCP statements, editorials and
 leaders' remarks on the conference and the test-ban to give the
 impression that the JCP favors the CCP's views,  The Chinese and JCP
 positions while close, are not identical.  Peking obviously would have
 prefered the conference to have opposed the treaty--Chu Tzu-chi de-
 clared that the treaty was a "crime" and that the conference should
 "repudiate and oppose it resolutely,"  Moreover, Peking did not echo
 the JCP concern over the socialist-Sohyo departure from the conference--
 CPR media, in fact, welcomed the absence of the "trouble makers,"
 Moscow, while at odds with the JCP on most issues, has attempted to ob-
 scure the differences,  A 1 August PRAVDA article implied that the JCP

 should agree with the test ban treaty.  The article declared:
 The position of the Soviet Government on the question
 of the banning of nuclear tests is wholly in accordance
 with the demands of the previous international forums
 of peace partisans, and also the demands put forward by
 peace partisans of various countries in the course of pre-
 paration for the Ninth World Conference against Atomic
 and Hydrogen Weapons....  As confirmation of this we can
 cite the program of the Japanese peace partisans expounded
 recently in AKAHATA, the organ of the Central Committee
 of the Japanese Communist Party.
 Generally, Moscow media seem to avoid as much as possible any comment
 on the internal difficulties of the Japanese "peace movement" and JCP
 policy,
 Prague in a rare attack upon a party for allying itself with Peking,
 one  August lauded the Japanese Council Against Atomic Weapons- which,
 it said had been "practically destroyed" by the Chinese and JCP--and
 condemned the JCP for trying to "force" its opinions on others "at
 all costs."  The Czech radio commentary openly declared the JCP to
 be "one of the the very few communist parties supporting the views
 of the Peking leaders,"
 The Czech broadcast is particularly remarkable when compared with a
 Prague CTK commentary on the previous day which blamed the conference
 difficulties on the "wrecking activities of the rightwing leaders of
 the Japanese Socialists Party" and attacked the socialists for at-
 tempting "to force their views on the conference."  Thus the Czechs ap-
 pear to have made a complete reversal in picturing the JCP as the
 villain of the Hiroshima conference.
 PYONCYANC, HANOI ENDORSE CPR STAND OTT TEST BAN TREATY
 Peking's apposition to the test ban treaty is seconded by North Korea and
 the DRV, as well as by the Indonesian Communist Party.  Characteristically,
 Pyongyang provides the most outspoken support, although Hanoi joins it in
 echoing Chinese assertions that the separation of the test issue from
 nuclear disarmanent strengthens the imperialists while nonproliferation
 provisions are aimed at weakening the bloc.
 After initial Pyongyang propaganda which characterized the treaty as a
 "sinister machination of U.S. imperialists,"   leading DPRK dailies
 published the text of the 31 July CPR statement (Pyongyang has apparently
 ignored the 3 August USSR statement)..  This was followed on 4 August by

 a NODONG SINMUN editorial(rebroadcast by Peking in Russian) which charged
 that the treaty provides the United States with ":Favorable conditions
 for attaining nuclear supremacy," and cites Harriman for the comment that
 the treaty could enable the United States and USSR to "work together to
 prevent China from getting nuclear capability."  Echoing proposals of
 the CPR statement, the editorial calls for destruction of all nuclear
 weapons and their removal from overseas bases.  Indirectly endorsing
 Peking's call for a world conference, the editorial asserts that matters
 of nuclear disarmament "cannot be discussed and solved only by a few
 countries."
 Hanoi Reactions  After reporting the initailing of the treaty, Hanoi on
 31 July broadcast to the home audience a series of news-reports obviously
 tailored to underline the advantages of the treaty to the United States,
 and to point up U.S. intentions of increasing its nuclear strength.  How-
 ever, Handi's'first independent comment came in a 6 August NHAN DAN
 editorial (carried in the Peking press on 8 August)describing the partial
 test ban as enabling imperialists to perfect "such nuclear weapons as
 they deemed necessary for their war plans,"
 Attacking the nonproliferation provisions, the editorial asserts that in
 the absence of disarmament, attention should be paid to strengthening
 convential and nuclear defenses of the socialist camp.  In its sharpest
 slap at Soviet participation in the treatye e itorial declares that
 the United States "cannot deceive the whole of the socialist camp and
 the whole of the communist and workers movement; it cannot deceive all
 the peace-loving people of the world."
 The editorial, ostensibly pegged to the anniversary of the Hiroshima
 bombing, managed to avoid any specific reference to the treaty itself--
 aside from a brief allusion to the Moscow talks.  While NHAN DAN echoes
 the CPR call for a complete nuclear weapons ban and other of the proposals
 advanced in the CPR statement, it does not mention the call for a world
 nuclear disarmament conference.
 The Hanoi press and home service broadcasts on 7 August carried the text
 of the treaty together with excerpts of about equal length from the CPR
 and USSR statements,  Hanoi's fairly full version of the Chinese statement
 is notable  for its omission of the most blatant. attacks on the Soviet
 Government for making an  "about-face" on the test issue, for "selling
 out" the interests of Soviet and world peoples, and for allying with the
 United States and reactionaries to oppose China and the "people of
 the world."  Detailed information on Hanoi's version of the Soviet state-
 ment is not yet available; however, apparently it does contain the charge
 of. CPR aggressiveness,

 LATIN AMERICA
 With newly restored confidence in the protective deterrence-cover of
 Soviet military prowess following his USSR visit? Castro on 26 July
 delivered his most militant call to revolt in Latin America since
 January.  In two speeches in January he had revived from the Second
 Declaration of Havana the maxim that the duty of a revolutionary is not
 to sit passively in his doorway and "watch the corpse of imperialism
 go by," but to actively make revolution.  In his July anniversary
 speech, he now enlarges repeatedly on the notion that it is the
 "duty" of the revolutionary to act, and he adjures Latin American
 revolutionaries "not to wait for a change in the correlation of forces
 to produce the miracle of social revolution."
 Asserting that "a revolution is inevitable" in Latin America, Castro
 ticks off a list of 10 hemisphere nations--"and any other countries
 I may have forgotten"--as ripe for revolt, exempting the five that
 still recognize his regime.  He singles out Venezuela and Guatemala
 for special attention, offering a "greeting of solidarity and co-
 fraternity to the heroic Venezuelan revolutionaries" as well as to
 the "heroic guerillas of Guatemala."   He claims that revolutionaries
 "do not need anyone to send money from abroad when they are fighting,
 nor do they need anyone to send them weapons."  And he mocks "impe-
 rialist" concern that Cuba "exports its revolution":  "We only expose
 our ideas," he says; "We share our ideas with revolutionaries from
 anywhere in the world."
 While Castro lambasts President Kennedy in sharper language than
 usual in the course of a diatribe against "U.S. imperialism" (Cuban
 commentator Gomez Wanguemert says Castro's "harsh language" in re-
 ferring to the President "shocked" U.S. news agencies), he reiterates
 Cuba's readiness to hold discussions with the United States provided
 the latter puts an end to its "aggressive schemes."  He had been more
 frank in remarks to the Middle East News Agency (MENA) in an interview
 on 25 July.  Practically admitting that it was at Soviet insistence
 that he had recently adopted a more conciliatory position toward the
 United States, Castro recalled "contacts for the improvements of
 Washington-Havana relations" before his departure for Moscow and
 declared that "this visit was a turning point in those contacts."  How-
 ever, he said, "miserable America" maintained its hostile attitude and
 "thus hindered these contacts." He added:  "We are happy about America's
 hostile policy, since it has enabled us to proceed on our path and do
 whatever we wish."

 Moscow's Handlin. of Castro Speech:  Moscow acknowledged Castro's
 26 My speech in a 450-word- A   account on 27 July which disposed of
 Castro's inflammatory calls to arms in the bland statement that he
 "dwelt at length on the significance of the heroic attack on the
 Moncada Barracks for the development of the revolutionary struggle of
 the peoples of Cuba and all Latin America,"  TASS noted Castro's com-
 ment on Soviet power as a deterrent to the United States, on Soviet
 economic aid to Cuba, and on the certainty that "the USSR and the
 socialist camp" will support "any people doing what the people of Cuba
 have done,"
 PRAVDA on the same day published an account of the speech similar to
 the TASS release,  It received no further publicity for four days, when
 PRAVDA's issue of the 31st gave "almost two full pages to Fidel Castro's
 speech" in "abridged" form, according to the TASS press review,  Co-
 incident with the PRAVDA publication, versions of the speech were
 broadcast some 50 times in various languages.  PRAVDA's abridgment
 made no effort to suppress Castro's call to arms in Latin American
 giving in full his remarks concerning revolutionary "duties" and the
 inevitability of revolution in Latin America,  Passages concerning
 Cuban grievances against the United States were muted, and PRAVDA
 softened the attacks on Venezuela and Guatemala through omission or
 condensation of Castro's remarks,
 While the text of Castro?s glowing 4 June report on his USSR visit had
 been broadcast in Mandarin and Korean, in installmentsq with lengthy
 excerpts provided for the Albanians from 17 through 22 June, no such
 special treatment is given to the 26 July speech in these three language
 services,  (The 4 June speech had also been promptly published in full
 in PRAVDA and given as prompt broadcast dissemination in summary form,)
 Pekin 's Treatment of Castro:  Peking, which conveyed its reaction to
 as ra s     une trip report  y ignoring it, recounts this speech
 promptly and at length in the domestic service as well as via  NCNA,
 Peking's account concentrates on Castro's outline of the duty of revolu-
 tionaries in a hemisphere ready for revolt, and picks up his comment
 on the Moncada Barracks attack as showing how "people" can defeat a
 modern army.  Singling out his remark that "revolutionaries should not
 make the path of Yankee imperialism easier" (omitted in PRAVDA's abridg-
 ment), Peking rephrases it with pointed applicability to the Sino-Soviet
 dispute in reporting that he said revolutionaries "should not facilitate
 the tactics used by U0S0 imperialism,"
 But the Chinese have clearly not forgiven Castro for his USSR visit,
 He is not once mentioned in remarks by Chen I and Kuo Mo-jo (as re-
 ported by NCNA ) at a Cuban embassy reception, or in PEOPLE'S DAILY
 and TA KUNG PAO editorials on the 26 July anniversary.  (PRAVDA referred

 and published articles by Dorticos, Raul Roas and Carlos Rafael
 Rodriguez.)  And where the CPR leaders' greetings message on 26 July
 1962 had applauded Castro's "correct leader'ship," this year's message
 mentioned him only once, noting that "Comrade Fidel Castro" led the
 attack on the Moncada Barracks 10 years ago and crediting everything
 since then to "the Cuban people."  (In direct contrast, where last
 year's Khrushchev-Brezhnev message referred only to "Comrade Fidel
 Castro" leading the Cubans at Moncada, this year's calls Castro an
 "outstanding revolutionary.")  The 1962 CPR message (from Liu Shao-
 chi and Chou En-lai) extended "warm fraternal greetings" from the
 Chinese people, governments "and on our own behalf" to Dorticos and
 Castro personally, "the Cuban people, and the Government of the
 Republic of Cuba"; the present message (from Mao Tse-tung, Liu Shao-
 chi? Chu Teo and Chou En-tai) sends "warm greetings" on behalf of
 the Chinese people, the CCP, and the Chinese Government to the "heroic
 Cuban people;s  the United Party of the Socialist Revolution of Cuba,
 and the Cuban Revolutionary Governments" omitting the personal saluta-
 tions.
 Havana Poses as Sino-Soviet Neutral
 Still striving to maintain a carefully neutral attitude in the Sino-
 Soviet disputes Havana media balanced publicity for the activities of
 the CPR and Soviet delegations to the anniversary receptions  Broad-
 casts prior to the anniversary reported that pictures of Khrushchev
 were displayed in Cuba alongside those of Castro, Marx and Lenin.
 On the other hand, PRENSA LATINA on 1 August distributed a summary of
 a speech by Gen, Liu Ya-lous leader of a CPR military delegation, in
 which he described as an "immutable truth" the claim that "imperialism
 and all reactionaries are paper tigers."  And PRENSA LATINA announced
 on 4 August that the Cuban ideological magazine CUBA SOCIALISTA in its
 August edition carried texts of both the CCP 14 June letter and the
 CPSU's 14 July reply, while Che Guevara, addressing U.S. students
 visiting Cubas said he found "the attitude of Cuban students correct
 when they do not comment on Sino-Soviet ideological differences, which
 are also among the most important matters for us as well."
 That overtones of the polemic were nevertheless present at the celebra-
 tion is indicated in an article by Soviet editors Adzhubey, Pavel
 Satyukov, and Dmitri Coryunov of the Soviet delegations who accused their
 "Chinese comrades" of "grossly and deliberately distorting the truth"
 in regard to the Caribbean crisis.  They noted that "when Fidel Castro
 said that in their revolutionary struggle the people of Latin America
 will find a loyal comrade and friend in the great country of Lenin,"
 this promise was roundly applauded by the Havana audience, "but the
 Chinese delegates would not even remove their hands from their pockets."

 CPR CONTINUES ROUTINE ATTACKS ON INDIAN "AGGRESSIVENESS"
 Contemptuous of Indian "stories" of Chinese troop concentra-

 of Indian aggressive intent,  Peking's propaganda, routine
 in tone and moderate in volume, does not threaten retalia-
 tions nor appear to be building a case as a pretext for
 counteraction,  Last fall, a month before large-scale fight-
 ing broke out, Peking was charging India not only with border
 intrusions but also with armed clashes, and NCNA gave plain
 warning that India's "nibbling" at Chinese territory created
 a "dangerous situation in which armed conflict may be touched
 off at any time, rr
 While Moscow shows concern at the effect on Indian neutrality
 of the air defense agreement with the West and. the VOA agree-

 peace in Asia, and routinely charges that the agreements

 CPR, in increasingly bitter tones, castigates Soviet aid to
 India,
 Peking Denies Reports of Troop Concentrations
 Ridiculing the recent spate of Indian "wild stories" of massive Chinese
 troop concentrations on the border, NCNA on 3 August quotes foreign
 press reports attributing the rumors to an attempt to distract Indian
 public attention from the government's political difficulties and to
 obtain more aid from the West and the USSR,  On 27 July NCNA specifically
 attributes the reports to an attempt to make the "military collusion"

 exercises, by mountain road-building, by enlarging the army, by reorganiz-

 CPR Foreign Ministry Notes Carry Standard Charges
 Of the five notes to India publicized by Peking since 12 July, three
 are concerned with border incidents,  A 31 July note denies an Indian
 charge (in a 5 July note) of a Chinese intrusion in June across Natu La
 into Sikkim; Peking's note claims that no CPR forces have ever crossed
 into Sikkim, and implies a difference between India's and Sikkim's
 foreign relations by saying that "China and Sikkim have always lived
 together in peace" and by charging that Indian military structures
 around Natu La have interrupted normal traffic between Sikkim and Tibet,
 Another CPR note on 31 July, also concerning the Natu La area, reiterates
 an earlier charge (denied in a 15 June Indian note) concerning Indian
 military structures on, and troop occupation of "Chinese" territory be-
 yond the watershed defining the Sino-Sikkim boundary,  This note demands
 a joint Sino-Indian investigation of the military structures to clarify
 their location and to show "who is confusing world public opinion,"
 A 30 July CPR note accuses Indian troops of two intrusions in July into
 Hsialinkung terrance (in the eastern sector of the border) north of
 the 7 November 1959 line of actual control (which India does not
 recognize) for reconnaissance of a CPR civilian checkpost and for the
 erection of military structures on "Chinese" territory,  The note goes
 on to accuse India of "deliberately creating tension" by its alleged
 repeated intrusions in the western sector of the border and recently
 extended intrusions in the eastern sector, in violation of the pledge
 not to take any action impeding the unilateral CPR ceasefire and with-
 drawal,  The note demands an end to the "intrusions" but does not
 threaten retaliation--nor do the other protest notes,

 Taiwan collusion and India's persecution of its overseas Chinese popula-

 from Taiwan by Nehru and other government officials, and charges
 that the Indian government "has completely gone back on its oft-repeated
 pledge to the Chinese government that it recognizes only the People's
 Republic of China and is opposed to 'two Chinas,"'  A 31 July note
 announces that Peking will send a ship for the fourth time to repatriate
 more interned and otherwise "persecuted" Chinese nationals, despite

 Indian rumors of a secret Sino-Pakistani defense pact and plot to
 divide Kashmir,  Indeed, Peking circumspectly avoids the Kashmir
 issued    And Peking does not directly acknowledge Pakistani Foreign
 Minister Bhutto's warning on 17 July in the National Assembly that "any
 attack on Pakistan will no longer concern only the security and ter-
 ritorial integrity of this country but will involve the largest state
 in Asia" (as reported in Karachi radio's domestic service), and that
 "China would come to Pakistan9s aid if it were attacked by India"
 (as reported by REUTERS' correspondent in Rawalpindi, who added that
 Bhutto declined to say whether Pakistan had a secret pact with the
 CPR),
 In what is apparently a diluted paraphrase of the 17 July Bhutto state-
 ment, the PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial of 28 July says that Bhutto "pointed
 out recently that a heavily armed India would always be a threat, not
 only to Pakistan but to the whole continent."  According to NCNA on
 26 July, Bhutto declared on 24 July that Pakistan had received an
 assurance from "our friend" (not identified by NCNA, but identified by
 Karachi radio as the Western powers) and from "other countries" that
 they would "help Pakistan in the event of aggression,"  Thus while
 Peking is apparently not averse to rumors of a defense agreement with
 Pakistan, it is careful to remain noncomittsl.
 CPR, Soviet Reactions to Joint Air Exercises and VOA Agreements
 The 28 July PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial assails the air defense agreement
 as a "grave step taken,,,to menace the peace of Asia," and claims that
 the agreement constitutes a political and military alliance with the.
 United States and an attempt to revive tension on the border,  It is
 thus "new proof," the paper says, of India's "rejection of a peaceful
 settlement" and should be brought to the attention of the Colombo con-
 ference nations,  Should India "take rash actions ? .and create new
 conflicts," concludes the editorial, "it must bear responsibility for
 all consequences."
 The Soviet reaction to the air exercises plan evinces serious concern
 about the consequences for Indian neutrality;  In a Moscow broadcast

 contiguous areas, the defense of which is under the actual control of
 Pakistan," and specifies that after the settlement of the Kashmir dis-
 pute between Pakistan and India, the CPR will reopen boundary negotiations
 with the "sovereign authority concerned."

 hinder Soviet-Indian cooperation" because the "imperialists" are
 well aware of "how important Soviet-Indian friendship is to consolida-
 tion of the independence of young states and the strengthening of peace,"
 Western military aid to India, supplied under the "pretense of defend-
 ing India from aggression," is designed to force India to relinquish
 its sovereignty and is thus "causing anxiety among India's friends,"
 TASS on 7 August quotes Nehru as saying that the Voice of America trans-
 mitter agreement "runs counter to the policy of nonalignment" and was
 signed "without being preliminarily studied by the government," and
 that therefore talks are in progress to amend the terms of the agree-
 ment,  Moscow has strongly attacked the agreement:  The Polyakov com-
 mentary called it "not only an unprecedented concession to the impe-
 rialists but a step toward political and ideological cooperation with
 them,"  It stopped just short of calling it an unfriendly gesture by
 India toward the USSR:
 The aims pursued by the Voice of America are well known,
 Its subversion against the national liberation movement,
 peace supporters, and the USSR are well known,  Making the
 domestic service of the Indian radio available for VOA
 broadcasts can be considered an unfriendly gesture toward
 the countries of Southeast Asia and the Far East, which are
 defending their independence, and of course a blow to Indian
 sovereignty,  It can in no way be associated with the policy
 of nonalignment which Prime Minister Nehru has mentioned so
 often and so clearly,
 Peking treats the VOA agreement as merely additional evidence of U,S6-
 Indian alignment,  NCNA on 18 July says sarcastically that the Indian
 press is worried that the agreement will explode India's "nonalignment
 myth," and quotes one Indian paper as saying that the VOA broadcasts
 must be confined to "anti-China propaganda" so that "not even the
 slightest mention" will be made of the USSR,  A few days later, NCNA,
 while citing Indian press attacks on the agreement, also quotes an
 INDIAN EXPRESS argument that there should be no Soviet objection to it
 since Radio Moscow, the Voice of America, and All-India Radio are all
 engaged in attacking Peking.
 Peking Vents Bitterness Over Soviet Aid to India
 After a long period in which CPR media only implied Peking's displeasure
 over Soviet-Indian relations, and in which Moscow propaganda discreetly
 played down the Soviet position, both sides in July made their opposing
 views more explicit,  Thus Moscow put on an unusual display of friendliness
 for India, with Khrushchev personally opening the Indian exhibition in
 Moscow and with the welcoming of a number of official Indian visitors, in-
 cluding a delegation seeking expanded Soviet military aid.

 Peking's more direct attacks on Soviet-Indian relations date from the
 polemical 16 July PEOPLE'S DAILY Observer article which proclaimed that
 Nehru has "not without success" pursued the strategy of "poisoning Sino-
 Soviet relations,"*  PEOPLE'S DAILY also quoted Nehru as saying that
 "Soviet neutrality in the India-China conflict is of greater help to
 India than all the military aid received from the West" at the time of
 the fighting,  And it warned that while the "nonalignment signboard
 can still hoodwink some people," Soviet aid cannot change India's status
 as a U.S, "protege"--for-!'can the investment of one dollar outweigh that
 of 10 dollars?"
 Since the Observer article, Peking has continued its attacks on Soviet-
 Indian relations, using the device of quotat dns, from the Indian press:
 +  NCNA 31 July:  "Had Russia not befriended India and were the combined
 might of the communist bloc directed against India, no amount of military
 aid from the United States would have been of any avail,"
 +  NCNA 4 August:  The Indian Government is very grateful for Soviet arms
 aid because it came despite Soviet misgivings about the air excercises
 and VOA agreements, and despite "open Chinese diatribes against Moscow as
 aiding and abetting India in its armed encounter with China," and because
 the arms aid list "covers weapons which are conventionally called of'fen-
 sive,"
 +  NCNA 7 August:  Moscow's cooperating with India is "no longer inhibited,"
 a fact which "explains the reported large measure of success of the
 Boothalingam arms mission to Moscow,"  However, "more important than these
 material gains are recent Khrushchevian gestures in public of continued
 affection and sympathy for the Indian Prime Minister,"
 NCNA says on 6 August that according to an AFP report, Indian Foreign Sec-
 retary R,K, Nehru, asked at a Moscow press conference "whether his govern-
 ment was as sure of receiving material aid from the USSR as from the United
 States in case of hostilities with China," replied that he was certain the

 MOSCOW PRESSES "TROTSKIYISM" CHARGE AGAINST PEKING
 While Moscow and Peking are currently absorbed in hostile exchanges on
 the test-ban treaty, the charge of "Trotskiyism" against Peking is pressed
 more and more openly in the CPSU's continuing campaign against the positions
 of the "Chinese leaders," The charge, which was first bruited in the pro-
 paganda as long ago as 1960, was renewed by Khrushchev last December, with-
 out, however, an explicit naming of the Chinese, and again in the 14 July
 CPSU open letter which accused the Chinese of consorting with Trotskiyites
 in Ceylon.  Now the charge is leveled directly at Peking in articles com-
 memorating the 60th anniversary of the formation of the Bolsheviks under
 Lenin (30 July), and is further documented in press accounts of Chinese
 collusion with Trotskiyites in various countries.
 The charge--among the gravest in the lexicon of communist heresies--is
 well suited to the current Soviet strategy against Pekingb   The labeling
 of the Chinese as Trotskiyites--advocates of world "revolutionary war" in
 the official terminology--serves both the prime Soviet effort to portray
 the Chinese as the warhawks of world communism, and the attempt to build
 the case against them as representatives of a classic communist "deviation"
 deserving of exclusion from the ranks of orthodoxy.  While the emergence
 of the Trotskiyite theme provides but one more sign of the deepening of
 the conflict since the break-off of the Sino-Soviet talks last month,
 Moscow continues to refrain from the logical next step of demanding formal
 expulsion of the Chinese from the communist movement and persists in the
 anachronism of referring to the Chinese as "comrades."
 "Old Bolsheviks" Letter:   Moscow uses the 60th anniversary of the Second
 Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party, which marked
 the formation of the Bolsheviks under Lenin, to denounce the Chinese as
 Trotskiyites.  PRAVDA on 30 July publishes a letter signed by a group
 of more than one hundred "Old Bolsheviks" who say they "kneI'Leninm  They
 declare that it is "sacrilege" to argue that Lenin would have condoned
 the Chinese neo-Trotskiyite line on "revolutionary ware"  Expressing the
 hope that the Chinese will publish their letter, they accuse Peking of
 resurrecting old heresies they helped Lenin suppress,-and declare that
 many of the "theses" of the 14 June CCP letter to the Soviet party
 "simply repeat the A-B-C" of Trotskiyism.  According to the "Old Bolsheviks,"
 The leaders of the Chinese Communist Party advocate a revolutionary
 war, but 45 years ago, during the party's struggle for the Brest
 peace, the necessity of such a war was being propagated by Trotskiy,

 Bukharin, and left communists,  Why don't you, comrades of the
 Chinese Communist Party, say how Lenin branded them and others
 as archrevolutionary leftists?
 The "Old Bolsheviks"--retired party figures whom the Soviet regime often
 calls upon to give the stamp of orthodoxy to its policies--combine appeals
 to the "Chinese comrades" to see the error of their ways with merciless
 criticisms of the Chinese positions along the lines of the CPSU's 14
 July open letter.
 Pos  lov Article:  Along with the Old Bolsheviks' letter, PRAVDA carries
 a Bolshevik anniversary article signed by Pospelov reinforcing the
 Trotskiyite charge.  Pospelov asserts that the Chinese have exposed their
 Trotskiyite colors by complaining that the Soviet party "forgets" revolution,
 Pospelov, who has previously issued warnings to the Chinese in the form of
 historical accounts of how Lenin purged leftist factions from the Bolshevik
 fold, warns that the Chinese leaders--"whether they want to or not"--are
 colluding with the "ideologists of extreme reaction."  Thus he says.,
 In the past few months the Chinese comrades have slanderously
 accused the CPSU of burying revolution in oblivion.  There
 is nothing original, however, in this slander:  the Trotskiyites,
 too, said this and wrote in this fashion.  Today they repeat this
 slander in anti-Soviet books published in West Germany by fascist
 revanchist publishers.
 In other propaganda, Moscow provides cases in point to document the Trotskiy-
 ite charge.  Among the numerous repotts'in the-Soviet media describing CCP
 divisive activities in various countries are references to Peking's commerce
 with Trotskiyites.  Thus Moscow has publicized the Canadian party's com-
 plaint about Chinese links with Trotskiyites in Canada, and most recently
 a TASS report of the Hiroshima anti-nuclear weapons conference pictures the
 Chinese delegates along with "Trotskiyites" and "rightwingers" as among
 the disrupters of the meeting.
 KOMMUNIST Assails CCP Leaders' "Deviation"
 The CPSU's principal journal KOMMUNIST (No. 11) develops the theme that the
 Chinese party has become a full-fledged "deviationist" faction within the
 world communist movement.  Thus KOMMUNIST's lead editorial, according to
 a 6 August TASS review, assails the "deviation of the CCP leadership" in
 seeking to force a "revision" of the entire course of world communism.
 While repeating in detail the charges that have now become standard in the
 propaganda since the release of the CPSU open letter, the journal conveys
 to Soviet readers a notion of the massive effort being undertaken by the
 Chinese to produce an all-encompassing ideological and political literature

 designed to counter the standard Soviet texts.  According to KOMMUNIST,
 the Chinese comrades are completely revising from left opportunist
 and nationalistic positions the policy declarations of the world
 communist movement on all main questions, namely, the nature of
 the present era and its principal contradictions, the role of the
 world socialist system, war and peace, the development of the re-
 volutionary process and forms of transition to socialism, the
 national liberation movement, international experience in socialist
 construction, principles governing relations among communist parties,
 the struggle against the cult of the personality, and other problems.
 To date most of the voluminous Chinese tracts countering Soviet positions
 have been withheld from Soviet readers--though Peking has assiduously
 reprinted the Soviet materials and has dared Moscow to follow suit.  Con-
 ceivably, KOMMUNIST may now be preparing Soviet readers for eventual re-
 lease of some of the major Chinese documents in the USSR.
 The specific charges KOMMUNIST lodges against the Chinese leadership are
 blunt and scathing.  The "Chinese leaders" are accused of pursuing their
 present line to distract the Chinese masses from the "actual causes" of
 domestic setbacks which, according to KOMMUNIST, are the direct result
 of the implementation of the "erroneous preconceptions" of the CCP0  The
 Chinese communists are depicted as having lost confidence in their own
 capacities and, in desperation, resorted to stimulation of Chinese nationalism
 and racialism,   And once more the Chinese are accused of a deliberate in-
 ternal campaign to arouse anti-Soviet sentiments and hostility toward other
 bloc countries and parties in the capitalist countries,
 Moscow Defends Record on "National Liberation Movement"
 While Moscow presses its offensive against the Chinese on the war and peace
 issue, the current propaganda betrays Soviet defensiveness in the face of
 the Chinese charges that the Soviets have forsaken the national liberation
 movement,   Moscow thus stresses the theme that the USSR has been and re-
 mains the "bulwark" of the national liberation movement and argues in the
 KOMMUNIST   editorial that the CCP's theories stressing the revolutionary
 primacy of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are really aimed at reducing
 and denigrating the USSR's role in these areas.  And a large part of the
 7 August PRAVDA, for example, is devoted to a defense of the Soviet record
 and an indictment of the "Chinese leaders" for taking a "monstrous" and
 "unthinkable" stand on the issue,  The paper's editorial and editcrial'
 article elaborate the charge that the Chinese are seeking to draw the.
 national liberation movement away from the Soviet bloc, and numerous items
 are published to demonstrate the extent of the USSR's support--"including
 open military support"--for "anticolonial" and "anti-imperialist" movements.

 CEMA MEETING:  AUTONO   ISSUE  GITATES SO   '' B      On
 The top-level CEMA meetings in Moscow (24-26 July) attended by
 bloc leaders and convoked in the wake of the break-off of the Sino-
 Soviet talks implicitly underscored Communist China's economic,
 as well as political, isolation from the Soviet orbit.  However,
 the communique on the meetings failed to register any impressive
 gains for Moscow in its effort to accelerate the integration of the
 individual economies of the CEMA countries.  In addition, the
 Soviet bloc propaganda connected with the occasion conveyed
 the impression that the issue of national autonomy within the
 CEMA framework--raised most openly by the Rumanians of late--
 remains very much alive and that Peking's exploitation of the
 issue against Moscow has had effect among some of the satellites.
 Conference Communique Skirts Autonomy
 The CEMA meetings attended by bloc party and state leaders--announced on
 the same day (20 July) as the break=off of the Sino-Soviet talks in Moscow--
 produced a communique which hailed in general terms CEMA's progress in
 coordinating and specializing bloc economies since the organization adopted
 resolutions on these matters in June 1962;`  However, the specific areas
 of progress to which the communique refers are.only in the field of bilat-
 eral economic projects, not in multilateral coordination, where most of
 CEMA's unfinished business lies.  The goal of CEMA's future multilateral
 efforts, according to the document, is the coordination of the economic
 plans of all member countries in the 1966-1970 period.  But along with
 the communique's rededication of CEMA to multilateralism, it also places
 conspicuous stress on the "bilateral" concept and says that "bilateral
 consultations" among member countries "create the best possible basis
 for the multilateral coordination of plans."  Beyond these statements,
 the communique does not broach the question of the extent of economic
 and planning autonomy retained by the individual CEMA countries,
 While the Soviet bloc propaganda has also generally skirted discussion
 of the autonomy issue, the Rumanians, a 23 July Yugoslav dispatch from
 Bucharest asserted, approached the conference with the viewpoint that
 within CEMA "decisive competence in working out details of plans" should
 remain in the "corresponding executive institutions of each of these
 countries."  Although Bucharest's SCINTEIA editorial of 31 July spoke
 of Rumania's "wholehearted approval" of the CEMA meeting's decisions,
 On 30 July Tirana lodged the complaint that Albania, "a full member of
 both CEMA and the Warsaw Pact, was neither informed nor invited to par-
 ticipate in" the Moscow meetings of these bodies.  Tirana issued a similar
 statement last year regarding its absence from'the June 1962 meetings.

 the contents of the CEMA meeting communique do not necessarily conflict
 with the Yugoslav description of the Rumanian position prior to the
 meeting.  The communique had spoken only of a generalized agreement on
 "terms of coordinaiton of plans" made at the Moscow meeting.
 However, the only recent clear reference to Rumania's independent stance
 in CEMA from satellite sources appeared in a Bratislava PRAVDA editorial.
 article shortly before the Moscow meeting.  The article, pegged to the
 anniversary of a Czech-Rumanian mutual aid pact, unmistakably aimed a
 barb at Rumania when it said that "isolation...autarkic national economies...
 and neglect of duties resulting from proletarian internationalism are
 equally harmful for Rumania-  and Czechoslovakia."
 Soviet Bloc Responds to CPR's Anti-CEMA Sallies
 Following the conclusion of the CEMA meeting in Moscow, Soviet and satellite
 propaganda sought to counter Peking's recent charges that CEMA is a Soviet
 scheme for exploiting and dominating its neighbors.
 On 31 July both TRUD and PRAVDA responded to the Chinese sallies,   TRUD
 denied the allegation contained in the CCP's lu June letter that the
 USSR uses the "international socialist division of labor"--specialization--
 to impose its will on and exploit other socialist countries.   PRAVDA in
 its turn asserted that the application of the Chinese economic theories
 to socialist countries is nothing but "an attempt to undermine the unity
 of the socialist comity."  Like the TROD article, PRAVDA replied to
 Chinese charges in kind, claiming that it is the Chinese who are trying
 to force their economic tenets on other countries.  Extending its attack
 on the Chinese position, PRAVDA added that China's preaching of the
 doctrine of self-containment among the newly "liberated" countries only
 leads to wasted labor, slowed growth rates, and "splitting the peoples in
 the face of the united front of imperialist forces."
 Various satellite organs also joined Moscow in striking back at Peking's
 criticisms.*  The 1 August TRYBUNA LUDU, for example, in an article on
 the 60th anniversary of RSDWP congress, denounced the CCP's "hostile and
 groundless attacks" on the CPSU and declared that
 we cannot agree to the principles of relying mainly on one's
 own resources in economic building.   This principle is shortsighted,
 ., Tirana, largely ignored in the polemical exchanges between the CEMA
 countries and the CPR, as usual stridently resonates Peking's charges.
 Thus on the eve of the CEMA meeting, ZERI I POPULLIT charged that the
 USSR under Khrushchev's leadership is "exploiting the international division
 of labor...in order to impose his will on the other countries... tie their
 hands and feet, violate their sovereignty-and reap the biggest possible
 profits."

 it contradicts the interests of every socialist country and
 the entire socialist community; it is autarchic and separatist
 in its character.
 And on 6 August, Sofia's TRUD carried an article denouncing the Chinese
 leaders for their concept of "relying on one's own forces."      It added
 that prospects for development of the world socialist system "cannot
 be found along the road of mechanically piecing together different
 national economies."
 S i g n s of Concern over Domestic Impact of Peking's Char es:  Prior to the
 opening of the Moscow cow CEMA meetings, the East Germans and Czechs, in
 particular, betrayed their concern over the impact of Peking's charges
 on domestic opinion.  Thus, shortly after Moscow's release of the CCP's
 14 June letter which charged Moscow with economic exploitation through
 CEMA, the GDR's JUNGE WELT bristled at a reader who, while saying that
 the Chinese leaders "exaggerate" when they say the USSR takes unfair
 advantage? asked if tis was not in fact the case in regard to the GDR's
 abandonment of the aircraft industry.  The editors fired back that the
 Chinese charge was a "lie," not an "exaggeration ," and that the CDR alone
 and in its own interest gave up aircraft production.  And Czech Deputy
 Premier. Simunek, in his press conference in Prague on 23 July, denounced
 similar allegations, attributed to "Western" sources but implicit in the
 Chinese attacks, that "our credit policy" of extending large sums of
 credit to other bloc countries "is one of the causes of our present
 difficulties."

 THE USSR
 MEETING IN SUPREME ECONOMIC COUNCIL UNDERLINES; CHEMICAL PRIORITIES
 The announcement by PRAVDA on 3 August of a two-day con-
 ference "In the Supreme National Economic Council of the
 USSR, of the USSR Council of Ministers," provides further
 evidence of Khrushchev's drive to consolidate revisions
 of the seven-year plan aimed at releasing greater investment
 funds for the chemical, agricultural, and consumer goods
 industries.  The 1-2 August meeting, which discussed ques-
 tions on drafting the national economic plan and drawing
 up capital construction lists for 1964-65, follows a meet-
 ing on the same questions which had been reported in PRAVDA
 on 4 June,  The shift in economic priorities apparently
 registered by these meetings was attended by a political
 mystery--the present status of D. Ustinov, the titular head
 of the Supreme Council of the National Economy,  In neither
 of these important meetings dealing with subjects which fall
 fully within the administrative purview of the supreme
 economic organ was there any indication of Ustinov's participa-
 tion or attendance.
 Additional Investment Resources Soupt Frorn Construction
 At the 1-2 August meeting, which included members of the Presidium
 of the Council of Ministers, heads of the USSR planning organs, and
 other high party-state leaders, Khrushchev spoke on "definite tasks for
 the fundamental improvement of the planning of capital construction,"
 introducing proposals aimed at speeding activation of production capaci-
 ties and a more effective utilization of capital investments,  Other
 speakers included planning chiefs Lomako, Dymshits, Novikov, and
 Rudnev; Brezhnev, Kirilenko, Rudakov, and Shelepin were reported as
 participants,  The meeting, which published no formal directives or
 decrees,, was presumably a followup of the meeting in the Council of
 Ministers reported by PRAVDA on 4 June and chaired by Khrushchev.
 At the earlier meeting, a number of "guidelines" were issued, based on
 Khrushchev's proposals, calling for a preferential development of the
 chemical industry and specifying the fertilizer and consumer goods
 industries as principal beneficiaries of the shift in emphasis.  Pro-
 posals were also made to delimit a large proportion of capital

 investments to the technical reequipping and reconstruction of exist-
 ing enterprises, with the aims presumably, of freeing additional in-
 vestment funds for the commissioning of what Khrushchev described as
 "'progressive'" enterprises,
 Gostroy Chairman I. Novikov, in an article which appeared in PRAVDA the
 following day, 5 Junes added specifies to Khrushchev's proposals by
 stating that 1,000 construction projects had been excluded from the
 1963 title lists, and by pointing out that these "freed" investment
 funds would be allocated to "key and holdover construction sites,"
 Ustinov Position Remains Ambiguous
 Curiously, the name of D. Ustinov, the head of the Supreme Economic
 Council, is again, as on 4 June, omitted from the list of speakers
 or participants at the August meeting--an omission adding to a growing
 list of indicators that Ustinov's position has become a political
 issue in the Soviet leadership.  Elsewhere in the 3 August issue of
 PRAVDA$, Ustinov is again--as in a series of PRAVDA references in July--
 incorrectly identified as "deputy chairman" rather than "first deputy
 chairman" of the Council of Ministers--although in this case his name
 is placed first, out of alphabetical order, before deputy chairmen
 Lomako and Rudnev.
 Indications that Ustinov's position is somehow related to a political
 issue in the Soviet leadership were first noted on 30 April, more than
 a month after his promotion to first deputy prethier.  and chairman of
 the Supreme Economic Council and two weeks after the incapacitation
 of Kozlov,  At that time, PRAVDA incorrectly identified Ustinov as
 a deputy chairman in noting attendance at a luncheon for Castro,  In
 succeding weeks, however, Ustinov was accorded preferential treatment
 in the press:  he was reported in attendance with top . leaders at a
 dinner for the Uruguayan CP delegation on 11: May, and he was reported
 as accompanying Khrushchev on a tour of Moscow building sites on
 14 May--events which gave rise to speculation that Ustinov would be
 promoted to the Presidium at the June plenum.
 In the weeks following the plenum, however, a series of press indica-
 tors suggested that Ustinov's position had again become a focal point
 of contention,  Thus, on 20, 21, and 23 July, PRAVDA "erred" in
 identifying Ustinov in protocol listings as a "deputy chairman" of the
 Council of Ministers,  On 23 July, SOVIET RUSSIA, in reporting the
 arrival of the Mongolian CEMA delegation, incorrectly identified USSR
 Sovnarkhoz chairman Dymshits as chairman of Ustinov's Supreme Economic
 Councils although PRAVDA, on the same days carried the correct identi-
 fication,  On 24 and 27 July, PRAVDA again accorded Ustinov his

 correct title of "first deputy chairman,"  On 29 July, Ustinov ap-
 peared without title at the end of a listing of Presidium and Sec-
 retariat members,  But on 3 and 5 August Ustinov was again incorrectly
 identified by PRAVDA as a mere "deputy chairman,"
 One possible explanation for the Ustinov mystery might be found in the
 changes which have taken place in Soviet policy since his agency, the
 Supreme Economic Council, was established in March of this year.  The
 indications were strong at that time that the new agency was being
 established to preside over a "hard" orientation of Soviet economic
 policy and that the arrangement was being imposed upon Khrushchev
 rather than being engineered by him.  That the new agency was invested
 with powers which seemed to undercut the rationale of much of the ad-
 ministrative reforms carried out since the November plenum, and that
 Ustinov himself was, by background and association, a representative
 of heavy industry interests, were only two of a number of indicators
 that could be cited to support this interpretation,  In brief, Ustinov
 and his Supreme Economic Council could be regarded as the political
 offspring--and instruments--of a particular policy orientation inimical
 to Khrushchev's interests,
 Against this background, the current tergiversations around the name
 of Ustinov could be interpreted as mirroring the fallen fortunes of
 the policy that he symbolizes,  The only indications that are available
 regarding Khrushchev's attitude toward Ustinov are compatible with
 this interpretation,  In his 24 April speech, Khrushchev referred to
 Ustinov in demeaning terms, ridiculing Western rumors that Ustinov's
 promotion signified a major reallocation of resources in favor of
 defense,  Cautioning Ustinov's successor, Smirnov, Khrushchev warned;
 "We shall be able to shake him just as hard as we used to shake Comrade
 Ustinov when he was responsible for the development of the defense
 industry,"
 There are some loose ends in this interpretation.  One is the fact
 that the strongest indications of Ustinov's political favor came in
 May when Khrushchev's authority was well on the mend.  The other is
 that it does not account for the curious announcement which appeared
 in the first Sunday edition of IZVESTIYA on 20 April, under the caption
 "In the Supreme National Economic Council of the USSR," that an addi-
 tional 1 billion rubles had been allocated to consumer goods,  But
 there are indications that this item was itself a reflection of politi-
 cal infighting:  it was not carried in the regular second edition of
 IZVESTIYA on that day, and although the report ostensibly dealt with a
 decision of the Supreme Economic Council, another organization and
 another man, the USSR Sovnarkhoz and its head, Dymshits, were much more
 prominently displayed in the article.

 COMMUNIST CHINA
 PEOPLE'S DAILY CRACKS DOWN ON HISTORIAN'S VIEWS OF CONFUCIUS
 A long article in PEOPLE'S DAILY of 18 June strikes out at an
 obscure history professor's views on Confucius in a manner which
 seems to portend the inauguration of a tougher line by the party
 toward the seemingly harmless pursuits of its intellectuals,  For
 quite some time classical scholars--with the party's encouragement--
 have "bloomed and contended" over such issues as the "class stand"
 of Confucius, the progressive or reactionary character of his
 teachings, and so forth.  Now, however, PEOPLE'S DAILY clearly
 indicates that professor Liu Chieh overstepped the bounds by stub-
 bornly denying the relevance of Marx and the concept of class
 struggle to the study of China's classical history.
 History, the article warns, plays strange tricks on people who
 lose themselves in ancient papers; it leads them from one closet
 to another.  In espousing the "nonclass" character of Confucius,
 the historian has put himself in the same closet with all the
 modern revisionists who preach class harmony and peaceful co-
 existence$ and who betray communism.  The paper leaves little
 doubt that it regards Liu Chieh as a witting agent of modern
 revisionism.
 Liberal Line on Study of Confucius Tightens
 W WYe+q                                       P
 The first hint that the hard line on class struggle--introduced by the
 party plenum last September--augured ill for the relatively more liberal
 line which had encouraged diverse interpretations on the historical role
 of Confucius, appeared in the journal NEW CONSTRUCTION in January., The
 journal's editorial department complained that "unhealthy tendencies"
 among some scholars caused them to praise Confucius, and worse still,
 to give him credit for scientific epistemology, for the unity of theory
 and practice, and for dialectical materialism--some 2,300 years before
 Marx.  The editors warned that this method of interpreting the CPR's
 historical legacy would cause people to look backward to "feudal and
 bourgeois ideologies," and to revere the ancients blindly.  Another un-
 healthy tendency, said the editors, was to ascribe a supraclass character
 to the teachings of Confucius, making it a philosophy suited to all classes
 indiscriminately.  While declaring all these tendencies to be wrong, the
 journal was quick to add that its criticism was open to discussion and
 those with contrary views were entitled to stick by them,  The journal

 said that its views were in no way meant to hinder the "contention of
 100 schools of thought"; in academic research, it said, not even scholars
 of Marxism can declare their views to be absolutely right and suppress the
 views of others.
 But the more authoritative and far more caustic personal attack on Liu
 Chieh in PEOPLE'S DAILY in June makes no pretense of preserving a facade
 of academic freedom,  Purporting to review a recent essay by Liu--"How
 History Should Be Studied in Order to Make it Serve Current Politics"--
 PEOPLE'S DAILY critic Chang Yu-lou actually calls all of Liu's recent
 work to account, and sarcastically observes that it "bears distinctive
 colors" and "deserves attention from the public,"
 What provokes Chang the most is what he describes as the fearless obstinacy
 and cunning in Liu's work,  The critic notes that Liu exultantly "refutes"
 Marxism, that his theory is in "unequivocal opposition" to the use of
 class struggle for historical research, and that Liu says that to ascribe
 class character to all facets of history is a method which is dogmatic,
 mechanical, and "too anemic" for good historiography.  Chang also charges
 that Liu poses as a self-styled expert who says that Marxism is applicable
 to foreign history but not to Chinese history,, to economic history but
 not to ideological history, to modern history but not to ancient history,
 Chang seeks to refute the thesis that Confucian laws of benevolence and
 propriety are humanist, abstract concepts of man's nature common to all
 classes at all times, by adducing the standard Marxist refrain that
 there is no love, no truth, and no justice that transcends class interest.,
 all such concepts are "merely the terse political slogans inscribed on the
 banners of every class for use in the class struggle,"  To the historian's
 query--if Confucius was but a tool of the ruling classes, why was he
 persecuted by them and why did he counsel them to promote the interests
 of the whole people?--Chang retorts that in all societies based on private
 ownership there is wrangling among the rulers themselves, and that
 Confucius' so-called regard for the people was only the Machiavellian
 ruse known to all traditional ruling classes--to feign benevolence in
 order to preserve their rule,
 Historian's Theory on Confucius Linked to Modern Revisionism
 Chang charges that Liu is deliberately vague as to the application of his
 theories on classical history to modern politics.  According to Chang,
 Liu implies that the notion of class struggle is as irrelevant to the
 present era as it is to history,  If, for example, Liu says a "proper"
 study of ancient history can shed a great deal of light on present politics--
 and his proper study of the past excludes class struggle--, can we not see,
 asks Chang rhetorically, "what sort of current politics Mr, Liu Chieh wants
 to serve in his historical research?"

 In praising Confucius, Liu appears to advocate the universal application
 of the Confucian version of the golden rule:  "Do not do unto others what
 you would not have them do unto you."  Such ideas have no application to
 the modern period, Chang avers; in dealing with our enemy
 we think that we should do to him what we do not wish to be done to
 ourselves, that is, we should overthrow him, destroy him, and give
 him a dose of his own medicine,
 Worse still, according to Chang, Liu has craftily sought to propagate the
 modern revisionist line under the pretext of studying the historical legacy
 of Confucius.  In the broader context of what the consequences will be
 for those who abandon the concept of class struggle, Chang makes the un-
 usual observation that "if struggle id eliminated and completely suppressed,
 then some sort of slave system will be permanently preserved, no advance,
 will be made in history, and mankind will never be liberated."  Past
 Chinese attacks on what they have called the Soviet abandonment of the
 principle of class struggle have invoked the specter of "capitalist
 restoration," but never permanent slavery--an image which seems wholly
 inconsistent with every communist assumption about the dynamics of
 history.
 The rationale for Peking's tougher line on the intellectuals is not hard
 to find.  A characterization of Marxist ideology as "foreign" at a time
 when Peking is locked in ideological struggle with the Soviet Union could
 give rise:to confusion in the academic community.  The historian's appeal
 to the universal, humanist elements in traditional Confucianism could
 encourage sentiments incompatible with the militant mood which the regime
 evidently wishes to encourage.  Stubborn individualists like Liu Chieh
 often carry more influence among the generally cowed intellectuals in Com-
 munist China than their positions in the political substratum would seem
 to warrant.  Regime propaganda often testifies to this phenomenons  The
 relentless hounding of the venerable rector of Peking University, Ma Yin-
 chu, for his forthright opposition to the economic rationale of the leap
 forward, was one case in point.  The current attack on Liu Chieh is
 probably calculated to cast a chill of conformity over all the wayward
 Confucians in the academic community.

 THE FAR EAST SATELLITES
 RECIPE REACTS SHARPLY TO NOVEL'S "SOUR CRITICISM"
 Hanoi has instituted a bitter counterattack against North Vietnamese
 writers who have strayed from the party line in literature, pegging the
 assault to a recently published novel by Ha Minh Tuan, "Her First Job."
 The novel tells the story of Miss Sen. a schoolgirl, who apparently
 bolts from a "forced and commercial" wedding and runs away to Hanoi.
 There she finds work at a factory construction site in order to live
 "a more significant life," and at the novel's end she becomes a good
 worker, even a production-line militant.  The story line, NHAN DAN
 notes, is acceptable:  It could "instill in a reader even more con-
 fidence in our regime and socialist construction."  But what is
 objectionable is the satirical, and sometimes bitter, criticism of
 life in the DRV, its revolutionary achievements, various government
 organs, and the party itself.
 According to a letter to the editor of NHAN DAN on 13 July, the novel
 is filled with confused., negative, disgraceful, and frightening scenes.
 It not only shows a lack of sincerity and respect for the great successes
 of the revolution, the letter says, but it fails to eulogize the regime
 or contribute to the safeguarding of the regime.  Quite the contrary, it
 continues:  the novel attacks each step of the revolution, distorts the
 truth, besmirches the regime, and arouses the remaining backward elements
 to resentment against the regime.
 The novel apparently advances in a graphic manner "sour criticisms of
 the many daily shortages, worries, and grudges" occasioned by life in
 Hanoi.  The excesses of the sacrosanct revolutionary achievement of land
 reform are blasted by the author by means of the character Hieno who
 had been a good soldier in the "war of resistance" against the French,
 but whose father was unjustly judged in the subsequent land reform and
 hanged himself.  Hien loses his "revolutionary character" and falls
 into "bad thoughts and actions," forever plagued by the memory of seeing
 his father "with his tongue hanging out."
 Various government organs are also criticized. NHAN DAN on 29 June charges
 that the novel gives rise to "a whole heap of antipathy and prejudice"
 against leading cadres, a number of important institutions--such as in-

 dustrial branches, the state trade-organ, the press, and propaganda organs--
 and important organs of "our people's democratic dictatorship,"  'including
 the security service.
 Even the heinous crime of criticizing party leadership is ascribed to the
 novelist.  Although his alleged target is "bureaucracy," notes the letter
 published in NHAN DAN, the author "attacked the party leadership under
 the form of an 'antibureaucratic struggle."'  NHAN DAN comments that,
 even when convenient opportunity was lacking, the author still voiced
 his "deep-rooted antipathy against the leadership,"
 Hanoi is clearly apprehensive of the effect that the book may have, and
 plainly intends to totally suppress the novel,  NHAN DAN asks:  !'After
 reading 'Her First Job,' what does a reader retain in his mind as the
 most striking impression?"   And it answers:
 Embarking on the road of life consists purely of catastrophes
 and sophisticated tragedies in which one's personal happiness
 is broken.  There is still room for the free development of
 dishonesty and debauchery in our society--and in places where
 order and security should be insured, particularly in cities
 and factories.  The living standard of the people. and workers is
 still poor and miserable; here and there the masses sporadically
 voice grudges and sarcasm.  Leadership everywhere is bureaucratic;
 the leaders have no concern for the life of the people--all they
 know is empty politics, one-way propaganda, and persuasion.
 There has not been a literary protest of such magnitude in the DRV since
 the "Nhan Van-Ghai Pham" incident in l9580's  Although Ha Minh Tuan is the
 only writer now being criticized, NHAN DAN indicates that this intellectual
 questioning may not constitute an isolated case.  Labeling his whole ap-
 proach as "bourgeois individualism," the paper says that the author
 has expressed this current of thought in his work.  This
 current, under circumstances easier for it to soar than before,
 has become vehement and brazen and has conspicuously appeared in
 the resentful and angry view and attitude of the author in his
 novel.
 Another manifestation of, this "current" may be the fact that the novel was
 even allowed to be published.  A writer in NHAN DAN asks:  "How could such
 a bad, hostile, and seriously harmful book slip through the net and reach
 the hands of readers?"  NHAN DAN asks if the officials of the Van Hoc
 Publishing House have "now seen all their responsibilities toward the
 Hanoi's suppression. of literary dissenters at that time is discussed

 party, people, and art."  Six days later, the journal VAN NGHE publishes
 the "self-criticism" of "the former Van Hoc Publishing House editorial
 board."   Upon rereading the book, the editorial board states, it discovered
 serious shortcomings'in the board's past work:  "Opinions voiced by readers
 and the press have pointed out to us our weakness.   This is a precious
 experience for us, from which we can learn so as to improve our editorial
 work still further,"
 The campaign against the book rages in the DRV press only; it has not
 been reflected in any VNA transmissions or-radio :broadcasts from Hanoi.
