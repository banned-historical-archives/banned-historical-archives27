 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 1.  USSR.  Comment on renewal of Soviet charges concerning Trieste:  In its
 18 November note to the US, UK, and France concerning Trieste, the USSR
 renews.long.standing charges that the three powers are violating their com-
 mitments under the Italian Peace Treaty,  The note resembles recent Soviet
 attacks on NATO in that it claims that the West is adapting Trieste re-
 sources for NATO purposes and is securing a permanent military and naval
 base on the Free Territory.
 The note further states that the Western Powers are planning to
 divide the territory illegally between Italy and Yugoslavia,  The USSR
 calls for another attempt by the UN Security Council to appoint a governor,
 probably in an effort to interfere with any possible bilateral settlement
 between Italy and Yugoslavia.
 2.        Rotation of military personnel under wa  to and from Soviet Zone of
 25X1     Germany:                                                the influx of recruits
 from the USSR increased in volume at the beginning of November when the
 return eastward of military personnel awaiting discharge was resumed.
 Between 3 October and 10 November, 16 trains with recruits were observed
 arrivin  in the Soviet Zone while eight trains with dischargees:leftthe
 25X1     zone,
 Comment.  The arrival of additional recruits for integration into units
 after the end of all maneuvers follows the practice of previous years.  The
 departure of trained personnel in the Soviet Zone had apparently ceased
 during the summer, presumably ih order to retain seasoned personnel for the
 training of recruits who had arrived in the spring.  The excess of arrivals
 over departures had resulted in an increase of strength estimates of Soviet
 ground forces in Eastern Germany by approximately 60,000 men. Information
 is not available to determine whether the current rotation will have any
 effect on the total of Soviet army strength in Germany.
 3,        Soviet press briefly reports new edition of Mao?s works:  The publi-
 cation in Chinese of the first volume of a new edition of the Selected
 Works of Mao Tse-tung on 12 October received only one brief report in the
 Soviet press on.the following day.  During the past year, particularly in
 anniversary greetings and references to Communist China, there has been a
 noticeable absence of Soviet praise for Chinese Communist ideological
 achievements.  However, the US Embassy feels that this is not due to any
 coldness between the two countries, which diplomatically and militarily
 are firmly aligned, but to the importance the USSR attaches to reserving
 for itself authority on all matters affecting Communist doctrine.

 Comment:  It is true that Soviet publications do not often praise
 .Mao's contributions to Communist theory.  However, Mao has been praised
 in the Soviet press, through the frequent republication of Chinese
 Communist articles and in Soviet editorials on them, for his achievements
 in adapting Marxism-Leninism to China. Moreover, Moscow has repeatedly
 recommended the adoption of Mao's program by other "liberation" movements
 in Asia,
 5.        Bulgarian note condemns Turkish border closure.,  On 15 November
 Bulgaria presented the Turkish Charge in Sofia with a note strongly pro-
 testing against the "unjustified and unilateral" closure of the Turko-
 Bulgarian frontier on 8 November.  Branding the border closure as an
 "arbitrary act which proves again the unwillingness of the Turkish authori-
 ties to abide by the Turkish--Bulgarian Convention," the Bulgarian note

 lowed to cross into Turkey without further hindrance.
 charges Turkey with responsibility for the consequent suspension of services
 by the Orient Express and for the detention of 1,500 Turks at the Bulgarian
 border city of Svilengrad0  The note concludes with a demand that Turkey
 immediately take all necessary steps to restore regular railway transport
 operations, and that emigrants carrying regular passports and visas be al-
 Comment:  It would appear that the present border closure came as a
 result of difficulties similar to those which led the Turkish Government to
 close the Turko-Bulgarian frontier from 7 October to"2 December 19500  In
 both cases considerable friction had developed as a result of the inclusion
 of non-Turkish and improperly documented elements among bona fide immigrants
 appearing at the border.
 Rail traffic between Turkey and the West is presently. routed via
 Greece.
 6. CZECHOSLOVAKIA-  Augmentation of materiel pool suggests expansion of Prague
 AAA defenses:   The US Military Attache in Prague reports that the anti-
 aircraft materiel pool near Bohnice in the outskirts of.Prague has been
 augmented by additional motor transport and has been provided with sentry
 25X1     boxes for security.
 Comment-  In a 2 November message the Military Attache reported
 counting 103 88 mm guns under tarpaulin in this storage space. The pooling
 of AAA materiel in such quantities indicates the probability that an ex-
 pansion of AAA defenses in the Prague area is contemplated.
 7. YUGOSLAVIA.  Yugoslav terms for a Trieste settlement reportedm
 25X1                                     Yugoslav officials are concerned over possible
 political repercussions from the US if a Trieste settlement is not reached,
 and thus are willing to cede to Italy Zone A and possibly certain portions
 of Zone B in an effort to reach an agreement.
 Yugoslav claims in Zone A are said to include certain well-defined
 rights in the port of Trieste, the entire Slovene area of Villa Opicina,
 and a connecting corridor from Zone B to the port of Trieste itself.  The
 Yugoslav Government prefers delaying serious negotiations until the elec-
 tions in Trieste have been held.

 TOP SECRET
 Comment:  The concessions which the Yugoslav Government will demand
 in Zone A are likely to be similar to the ones outlined above.  There are
 indications that the Yugoslavs may be willing to yield the predominantly
 Italian coastal city of Capodistria  in Zone B, if they are given certain
 areas and rights in Zone A.
 AMG postponed the elections in order to prepare the ground for direct
 negotiations.  All except the pro-Italian parties in Zone A opposed this
 postponement in a belief that election results would show a trend away from
 the Italians.
 8.         Yugoslav officials object to Western press criticism: According to the
 US Embassy in Belgrade, recent news dispatches playing up peasant resistance
 and economic difficulties within Yugoslavia have caused a serious rift be-
 tween Yugoslav authorities and Western press representatives.  Yugoslav
 officials have objected to those .news stories on grounds that they not
 only provide Cominform propaganda but, more importantly, jeopardize Yugo-
 slavia's standing with parliaments and peoples of Western countries.
 Comment:  Receht speeches by Tito and other Yugoslav officials have
 shown an increasing sensitivity to Western criticism of the regime and its
 policies. Yugoslav leaders are no doubt fearful of the effects that an
 unfriendly Western nreds may have on the large-scale Western military
 and economic aid program.
 9.         Yugoslavs report increased planting of grain:  Yugoslav officials
 report that the sowing of the important winter wheat crop in the Republic
 of Serbia, which normally produces a surplus of grain, has shown a sub-
 stantial improvement during the past few weeks -- 76.2 percent of the plan
 for the Republic.  Continued mild weather for the next two weeks would give
 the peasants and the collectives. an opportunity to complete the sowing plan
 throughout Yugoslavia.
 Comment:  Because a poor winter wheat crop would pose a serious threat
 to the economy and thus to the stability of the regime, the Yugoslav press
 had complained that winter wheat sowing was far behind the schedule and
 urged the peasants and the cooperatives to disregard unfavorable climatic
 conditions in order to fulfill the sowing plans.
 Unfavorable weather conditions, rather than reported widespread peasant
 opposition, were probably primarily responsible for a postponement of sowing.

 2.   LEBANON.  Lebanon concerned over stronj Egyptian opposition to the
 riddle East  .roman     ggyypt  is exerting  tremendous pressu relt?
 persuade the Arab delegations to the UN General Assembly to issue a
 joint statement this week endorsing Egypt?s abrogation of the 1936
 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and its subsequent rejection of the Middle East
 Command proposals.  The Lebanese Minister to the USE, Charles Malik, in
 transmitting this information, warned that the US should not be deluded
 by the efforts of the Iraqi  Prime Minister to compose the current situation,
 since Iraqi  public opinion :would force the Premier to yield to Egyptian
 demands.
 The Lebanese Minister expressed his belief that King Ibn Saud of
 Saudi Arabia holds the key to the present situation.  He accordingly
 urged that the US request Ibn Saud's assistance in countering the
 demands of the Egyptian Foreign Minister that all the Arab States publicly
 support Egypt's position.  The Lebanese Foreign Minister is so violently
 op7:,osed to Egyptian tactics that he is ready to resign.
 Comments  While Ibn Saud is probably the only figure in the Arab
 world w o m ght exert some influence on Egyptian policy, there is little
 evidence to indicate that the aging Saudi Arabian monarch wishes to
 become embroiled in a disputp, with his Egyptian friends.

 .maneuvers is that Arab public opinion generally supports Egypt's nation-
 alistic demands.
 3.   W.    mall quantity of tin "lat    .1           Iran.-  The US is making
 available to Iran 270 tons of tinplate for the first quarter of 1952.
 Commen 4  This tin is needed by Iran for packaging petroleum products
 for internal distribution.  A month's supply is on hand, but the distribution
 of packaged oil products from the refinery at Kermanshah has been held up by
 the closing of the tin can factory due to a shortage of material.
 4.  INDI, a r portal    an win a,plebiscite in Kashmir.-  The US Embassy,
 chiefs of other diplomatic missions, and American press representatives in
 25X1   India now believe that India can win a UN-sponsored plebiscite in Kashmir.
 The Embassy reports that Premier Sheikh Abdullah's land and tax reforms are
 responsible for his growing strength in the state.
 Gomm~nta  This belief in an Indian victory is contradictory to that
 held as recently as last summer.  Abdullahes ruthless suppression of politi-
 cal opposition and UN delay in settling the Kashmir case have probably helped
 to develop a feeling on the part of Kashmiris that it is futile to combat in-
 creasing Indian control.
 5.         Kashmiri Prime Minister postpones  ,rip to Paries  The Indian press
 reported on 15 November that Sheikh Abdullah, Prime Minister of Kashmir,, who
 25X1   was to have gone to Paris to participate in the UN discussions on Kashmir,
 has abandoned his trip.  It added that he may go later "if his presence there
 is considered necessary."
 QoMMpat,o  Prime Minister Nehru of India presumably believes that the
 Kashmir affair is proceeding satisfactorily enough in India?s favor to'make
 Sheikh Abdzllahas persuasive oratory before the Security Council unnecessary.
 6. Details of food barter a    went with      revealed.-  On 15 November
 officials of the Indian Food Ministry revealed the details of the May 1951
 barter agreement with the USSR.  One hundred thousand metric tons of Soviet
 wheat are to be delivered by March 1952, in exchange for 5,000 tons of raw
 jute, 2,500 tons of shellac, 5,500 tons of tobacco and 1,850 tons of tea.
 Freight is to be paid'by open market purchases'of pepper.

 been signs of increasing Malayan guerrilla activity on the Thai side of
 the border.  A captured Chinese arms runner has confessed that there are
 several smuggling channels from Bangkok to Malaya involving arms.9 clothing,
 food and medicine.  There have also been a number of reports of bandit camps
 being discovered by both British and. Thai police forces in the Thai-Malayan

 guerrilla operations in Thailand may forbode worsening conditions in the

 16.       A11e~ed Commuist Air Force intenions9  A Chinese Communist document
 presented as genuine by. the Chie ? of Staff of the Chinese Nationalist
 Air Force lists the following Communist intentions-  (1) the Chinese
 Communists'"may" continue the polio  of not attacking UN ground forces by
 air, for fear of US retaliation- (2) the Chinese Communist Air Force will
 be used against Indochina and Formosa in the futureg
 (3) Communist to capture all Southeast Asia eventually- and(         SSR China
 agreed to assist in Korea and Indochina with airaforce(andtairUtrraansport
 units.
 In addition, the document states that the Chinese Communist Air Force
 is an integral part of the Soviet Air Force, an "international Volunteer
 Air Force" has been in existence for some time under Soviet command., the
 Communists have been unable to maintain airfields in North Korea, and the
 Chinese are irritated bar total r m adequate  Soviet support of the Chinese
 .Communist Air Force. l
 gamal_s  It is doubtful if Taipei sources have access to Communist
 documents of this nature, and it is probable that this report consists of
 Chinese Nationalist speculation.
 The Communists have maintained airfields in North Korea for over a
 month.9 and there is no evidence that Soviet material support of the Chinese
 CommunistAir Force has been weak or that the Chinese are dissatisfied
 with the extent of Soviet support.
 17.   CHINA KiEA?  Chou En=1ai summarize s Peininos  oeition on Koreas  Chinese
 Communist Premier Chou En-1ai, in a Long statement of 19 November endorsing
 the Soviet Unionts "peace proposal" at the Uhl General Assembly, reviewed
 Peiping's position on Korea.  Asserting that the Chinese love of peace is
 exceeded only by the Chinese love of justice, Chou claimed that Peiping's
 intervention in Korea was impelled by US "occupation" of Formosa, "'invasion"
 of Korea, and advance toward Manchuc?is.  Referring explicitly to Malik's
 proposal of June 1951 that both belligerents withdraw from the 38th
 Parallel, Chou reaffirmed the Chinese and Korean Communist desire for a
 "peaceful settlement."  Noting that no agreement has been reached in four
 months of negotiations, Chou concluded that it is "possible" to arrive at

 an armistice agreement "as the first step" in a Korean settlement if the
 US will be "fair and reasonable,"
 Comment.-  Chou's statement is simply a summary of his and Mao
 Tse?tung?s pronouncements of 1 October,  The American press has presented
 Chou's reference to Malik?s proposal of June 1951, particularly as regards
 the 38th Parallel, as evidence that Peiping has returned to an intransi-
 gent position on this issue,  However, Chou fails to mention this issue in
 his remarks on the current situation,  At,the same time., Chou?s list of
 reasons for Peiping's original intervention suggests that, even if a
 cease-fire is achieved, Peiping intends in subsequent negotiations to
 bring forward its past demands for withdrawal of foreign forces from
 Formosa as well as Korea,
 18,   KOREA,.  Communist night air ativity further restricts UN over north-
 western Kgr     While Communist night interceptor aircraft have been
 encountered in limited numbers over North Korea since December 1950, until
 recently no UN aircraft was known to have been damaged in such meetings.
 On the night of 16 November a UN light bomber., flying at 6,000 feet near
 the Chongehon river, was caught in a light cone from 15 searchlights and
 was immediately attacked by two conventional fighters which inflicted
 "major damage."
 The Far East Command observes that the "skilled manner in which the
 pilots combined attacks with the use of radar-directed searchlights in-
 dicates a high degree of proficiency,"
 Anticipating an increase in both the number and effectiveness of
 enemy night interceptions, FECOM believes that the enemyes capability
 to. restrict UN night operations has considerably improved and may be
 expected to be a limitin  factor on future UN night a~.r activity north
 .of the Chongehon river,
 C       o'  Many of these night. interceptors are believed to be LA-11
 penetration.  fighters based in Manchuria,
 If the Communists fully attain the capability to deny the air over
 northwestern Korea to UN night bombers, it will. permit the nearly un-
 molested comple&-ion of their program of basing jet and conventional air,
 craft on airfields ,within Korea,

 installations and communications."
 This heightening of guerrilla activity is best illustrated by their
 successes on 12 and 14 November.  During this period a small village ln ar
 ra
 t
 ive
 Kwangju was raided and occupied by the enemy, and three effec
 were made on UN transportation installations in southwestern Korea with
 Comment.,  The increased efficiency and declining strength of the
 guerrillas probably stems from the winnowing out of reluctant South
 Korean civilians who had been coerced into joining the guerrillas.  In
 view of the inaccessibility of the enemy partisan strongholds in the Chiri
 and T aebak mountain ranges, the active cooperation of local inhabitants
 with UN forces remains the key to control, of these groups
 20.         u  ri    situation worries Rc1u~?    After considerable
 press and National Assembly agitation for a government explanation of
 the continued existence of a serious guerrilla situation in South Korea,
 the ROK Army Chief of Staff and other internal security officials appeared
 before the National Assembly in closed session on 31 October.
 Symptomatic of this concern, on 6 November the National Assembly
 voted to express "non?ccnfidemc-0. in the ROK Minister of Home :affairs,
 whose police forces are apparently unable to cope with the guerrilla
 situations
 Co  .eat.., It is anticipated that ROK countermeasures against the
 growing effectiveness of the guerrillas will increase when army command
 posts, to direct anti-guerrilla operations, are wet up in the affected
 areas of the Chiri and Taebak mountains.
 21.             UN field a=re   f food oLgup in SouthKorea completed  The US
 Embassy in Pusan rEports that a recent UN food crop survey reveals that
 available grains and vegetables in South Korea will provide a minimum
 ration for the entire populatiG,, through June 1952.  Grains and vegetables
 total 3,549,000 metric tons, whereas total consumption requirements are
 3,694,000, for a deficit of 145,000 metric tons.  However, the "consumption
 requirements seem generous," accordi   to the UN officials, as population
 figures used "are considered high."
 Cow'. The consumption. 'requirement, which may appear "generous,"
 is more than offset by the fact that the rice requirement (more than
 60 percent of the total figures) is computed at one pint per person daily--a
 subsistence level menu.,  The ROK Government?s figures on the same crops,
 however, show a deficit approximately six times that of the UN, presumably
 in an attempt to influence the UN fora import program.

 22i - JAPAN.  Left-winR Socialists plan Asian Councils  Left-wing Socialist
 leader Mosaburo Suzuki announced on 19 November that he is planning to set
 up an Asian Council to promote an economic tie-up with Southeast Asia and
 Red China.  He stressed that Red China, India and Japan should take the
 initiative in promoting economic and political activities in Asia.  Concrete
 Mans are being studied by Suzuki and Ambassador Chettur, head of the Indian
 Liaison Mission in Japan.  Represenkatives of Southeast Asian countries
 wi 1 be invited to Ja an soo  for the establishment of the council.
 Gomm. to  The left wing.of the Socialist Party indicated last Sep-
 tember its intention to align Japan with third force elements throughout
 Asia and to enlist their aid in building up Japan-Communist China trade.
 The lure of pan-Asianism and strong desires for increased trade with Commu-
 nist China give this program considerable appeal within Japan, and could
 do much to restore the Party's currently low prestige following its
 unpopular anti-peace treaty campaign.  Japanese Government officials re-
 portedly are incensed over the Indian representative?s dealings with this
 minor, anti-government political group.

 bungled the job in March by precipitately ordering the dismissal of

 dismissals.  Sit-down strikes among these officials ensued., and the
 Soviet Headquarters asserted that it would not recognize the dismissals
 which occurred in its zone.  Fearing that the Soviet authorities might
 establish their own police, the Ministry of Interior quickly adopted a
 "go-slow" policy and abandoned the purge.-
 The quick reaction of the Soviet headquarters to the renewed efforts
 of the Austrians to cleanse the police force suggests the importance
 they attach to this infiltration.

 uncontrolled exports of Austrian goods, the Austrian Government has
 frequently complained of the exhaustion of oil and forest resources,
 the loss of taxes normally paid by the USIA and SMV properties, and
 losses to Austrian establishments because of the competition of the
 expanding number of Soviet retail stores.  US officials estimate the
 value of industrial installations dismantled and removed by the Soviet
 Government from Austria in 1945 and 1946 at 200 million dollars.  The
 respected Austrian Research Institute for Economics and Politics places
 the replacement cost of machines and equipment removed, however, at one

 3.   NETHEt1LANDS.  Dutch-Indonesian relations at impasse over West New
 Guinea question:  The Dutch Foreign Minister, discussing with US
 representatives in Paris the current impasse between the Netherlands
 and Indonesia over West New Guinea sovereignty, requested US support
 in the event Indonesia unilaterally abrogates the Netherlands-Indonesian
 Union and probably other agreements negotiated by the two countries in
 1949.  He emphasized that transfer of New Guinea from the Netherlands
 to Indonesia at present is a political impossibility.
 to accept a-Dutch proposal to negotiate a bilateral treaty to replace
 the 1949 agreements and then allow some time to lapse before considering
 Meanwhile, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, also in Paris, has
 proposed a de jure transfer of sovereignty over the area with a
 guarantee of national treatment to Dutch subjects and the extension
 of certain privileges to the Netherlands for a period of twenty-five
 years.  No Dutch comment on his proposal has been received.  The
 Indonesian Foreign Minister doubted that his government would be willing
 the New Guinea question.
 Comment:  The Dutch and Indonesian attitudes on New Guinea are
 forcing'
 orcingng both governments into relatively uncompromising positions.
 Continued intransigence from both governments could lead to a break
 in Dutch-Indonesian relations.  The Dutch, who have continually sought
 postponement of action on Dutch-Indonesian issues until after the 1952
 parliamentary elections, are not expected to give way to Indonesian
 demands.
 The question is further complicated by the attitude of Australia,
 which has always opposed the transfer of West New Guinea sovereignty
 to Indonesia.

 4.    ITALY.  Anti-Communist union expresses reservations regarding; collabo-
 ration with  overnment:  Pastore) leader of the Confederation of Labor
 Unions  CISL , declared in a speech at the organization's recent
 congress in Naples that the CISL would cooperate with the government
 only if the latter's program provided for adequate socio-economic reform.
 He stated that labor was sick of mere words like "brotherhood" when
 people were poor and hungry, and that the government and employers
 should realize political democracy was meaningless without social and
 economic democracy.  Referring to the proposed labor law prohibiting
 strikes by government workers, he declared strikes should not be banned
 in any field.  He asserted that the CISL would resort to strikes only
 when necessary but reserved the right to take such action in any field
 where social and economic justice was not otherwise attainable.
 Comment-.      This is the strongest statement of opposition to the
 restrictive labor law yet made by the leader of the Christian-dominated
 CISL who has consistently criticized the government for its uncooperative
 attitude toward labor.  His assertion of the organization's independence
 from party and government control is clearly designed to strengthen
 its appeal to unorganized labor, which regards CISL as controlled by a
 clerical government, and to prevent a possible withdrawal of the
 democratic Socialist members to the Italian Union of Labor
 and other European industrialists with the National Association of
 Manufacturers in New York, the speech implied a close and harmonious
 views on increasing industrial productivity.  In defense of the existing
 restrictive business practices;, he points out that excessive competition
 destroys capital and thereby reduces productivity.  He rejects the
 thesis proposed by ECA that labor should participate in benefits of
 increased productivity; the Italian industrialists.suggest instead
 that labor should get those benefits only as consumers through reduced
 prices.
 Intended as a forerunner to the ECA-sponsored conference of Italian

 relationship between Confindustria and ECA.
 ,Comment: The position taken by Confindustria on productivity is
 indicative of its extreme reluctance to adopt labor practices on US
 standards.

 hundred thousand acres of land have been inundated and thousands of

 emergency bill for reconstruction of the flood-damaged areas in northern
 and southern Italy.
 Comment:  The heavy damage caused by the floods in Italy will be an
 additional burden on the I"t-.alian budget and may set back the investment

 a
 s
 gate at the US-Japan-Canada fisheries conference in Tokyo repor
 the 16 November meeting made substantial progress, with a large area of
 agreement on conservation principles indicated.  He reports that the
 Japanese strongly desire to avoid any implied rtwaiver" of rights, and to
 emphasize the equality of application of corservation,principles.
 Comment:  American and Canadian fishing interests are concerned lest
 the Japanese fishing fleet upset established conservation plans of the
 North Pacific fishing areas.  Japan, while in agreement on the need for
 conservation, has been insistent that the principle of freedom of high
 seas fishing be maintained in order not to weaken its position in future
 negotiations with other nations.  The proposed US draft reportedly prevents
 Japanese fishermen from taking salmon, halibut, herring or pilchard,
 although it permits all other types of catch.
