DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
USSR-Iran: Khrushchev, 
with the Shah, apparently repeated standard Soviet 
eman s for concessions by Iran as the price of "normal" 
relations,   he also 
evived a proposal�previously described by the Shah as 
meaningless--that the two countries withdraw their troops 
from along their common frontier. The Shah and other lead-
ing Iranian officials are maintaining their opposition to con-
cessions to Moscow, but are continuing to seek a means of 
Improving relations, 
he and 
Acting Foreign Minister Afshan took a firm position in ex-
changes of views with Pegov on 28 and 29 September.  
that such talks. "if they encounter no obstacle, will be prom-
ising." 
 III. ASIA-AFRICA 
uth Korea: Army Chief of Staff Lt, Gen. Choi Kyong-
nok believes that the dismissal of top general officers associ-
ated with the corruption of the Rhee regime is the basic re-
uirement for eliminating dissatisfaction among junior officers 
nd restoring discipline in the armed forces. Choi believes 
hat failure to take early action on this problem will create 
he real possibility of a revolt supported by the great majori-
y of officers, who as yet have not agitated. While contending 
that a coup is not the proper solution, Choi noted that military 
rule has been suggested by civilian as well as military elements.

Laos: A showdown may be approaching between Captain 
Kong Le and the Souvanna Phouma government following Kong 
Le's apparent refusal to abide by the cease-fire reached be-
tween Souvanna's military commanders and General Phoumi's 
Savannakhet Revolutionary Committee. While Souvanna has 
publicly rebuked Kong Le, his ability to bring Kong Le into 
line is still open to serious question. 
(Page 2) 
Morocco-France: Moroccan Acting Deputy Premier 
Ab elkhalek Torres--the ranking executive in Morocco in 
the absence of both the King and the crown prince--reportedly 
will order military action against the French Army in Algeria 
if alleged recent border violations continue. Torres is said 
to have the King's permission for such extreme action if 
necessary. Torres is reported to believe that Moroccan mil-
itary counteraction would create an international incident on 
the basis of which Morocco could request the intervention of 
UN forces. Such intervention is the avowed aim of the Al-
gerian rebels and seems to be the motive underlying Tunisian 
President Bourguiba's interest in "close union" of the Tunisian 
and Algerian rebel governmentsj (Page 4) 
*Republic of the Congo: Katanga President Tshombe's 
refusal on 30 September to attend the forthcoming political 
round-table conference in Leopoldville appears designed to 
emphasize ICatanga's political independence of the Congo. In 
Leopoldville, Mobutu is continuing his efforts to discredit Lu-
mumba by emphasizing the ousted premier's dependence on 
foreign support. However, his charge that Lumumba success-
fully solicited a loan from Communist China is unsubstantiated. 
Lumumba continues to have the active support of rUAR7 
Ghanaian, and Guinean representatives in the Congo.   
instructed the UAR ambassa-
dor to urge that Lumumba emphasize that he is prime min-
ister, especially while the General Assembly is in session, 
by making a large number of declarations, statements, and 
press conferences and other similar acts within his power."

III. THE WEST 
Berlin: Some NATO governments are refusing to cooperate 
inflinposing travel restrictions on East German officials as a 
countermeasure to recent East German interference with access 
to West Berlin. Denmark has stated that trade considerations 
and the importance of cooperation between the Danish and East 
German railway systems prevent it from concurring in the re-
strictions placed by the Allied Travel Office in West Berlin on 
travel by semiofficial or trade representatives. The Dutch 
Government has relaxed its travel ban on East German officials 
in response to urging by the KLM airline that these officials 
would merely use alternative routes to Western countries. 
*On 30 September Bonn denounced the 1961 interzonal 
trade pact with East Germany, over the apparent opposition of 
Britain and France. The West German move will not affect 
interzonal trade before the end of the year. East German offi-
cials who have threatened Bonn with retaliations for such a 
step now may feel compelled to take some action. Possibly 
aware that Western countermeasures were being contemplated, 
Foreign Minister Gromyko stressed to British Foreign Secre-
tary Home on 28 September that Moscow was "fully aware" of 
recent East German actions and warned that if a crisis devel-
oped it would be the fault of the West. He indicated, however, 
that Khrushchev was prepared to resume negotiations on Berlin 
after a new American administration took office.

Euro ean Confederation: The initial hostility to French

LATE ITEM 
*USSR-China: There is accumulating evidence that a high-
level Soviet delegation--including Presidium members Mikoyan 
and Suslov--has been in Peiping since mid-September holding ,4,Lat 
discussions with Chinese leaders. In addition to attempting to 
work out an agreed position prior to the forthcoming meeting of �' 
all Communist parties in Moscow this November, such a delega-
tion may have been sent to China to determine if a meeting of 
Chinese leaders with Khrushchev during his planned visit to North 
Korea this month would be possible and fruitful. Recent Chinese 
propaganda suggests that this attempt at reconciliation has been 
as unsuccessful as earlier attempts were.

Purge of Tovievenerals in South Korean Armtmoi 
South Korean Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen, Choi Kyong-nok 
believes that the "one-shot" dismissal of top general officers 
associated with the corruption of the Rhee regime is the basic 
requirement for eliminating the dissatisfaction among junior 
officers and restoring discipline in the armed forces. Prime 
; Minister Chang Myon, faced with disunity in the Democratic 
party, also favors removal of these generals, believing they 
might align with opposition political leaders. The purge prob-
ably will, include Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt, Gen. 
Choe Yong-hui, First Army Commander Lt. Gen. Kim Chong-o, 
Second Army Commander Lt. Gen. Chang To-yong, and others 
senior in rank to Choi. 
Choi said that he also recognized the necessity of disciplin-
ing junior officers who, hoping for promotion, are agitating 
for the ouster of senior commanders. He added, however, 
that failure to remove the generals in the near future could en-
courage a revolt supported by the great majority of officers 
who as yet have not agitated. He intimated that the intensity 
of the feelings of Korean junior officers on this issue is not 
fully appreciated outside Korean circles. 
The junior officers concerned recently visited Chang and 
the minister of national defense to present their demands. Of-
ficials of the ministry, 
 believe that these officers are becoming increasingly con-
fident of their influence, that the prime minister is afraid of 
them, and that the officers believe they can take over the gov-
ernment if the situation warrants. 
Choi noted that a military coup had been suggested by well-
informed civilian as well as military elements to restore politi-
cal stability to the country. Students of two leading Seoul uni-
versities are reported to support Choi's program to remove the 
general officers. One group indicated it would not oppose a 
military coup by voune. honest officers to restore stability in 
South Korea.

The Situation in Laos  
An app rently rancorous exchange between Premier Sou-
vanna Phouma and Captain Kong Le in two separate press con-
ferences indicates that a showdown between the Vientiane gov-
ernment and the paratrooper may be imminent. Kong Le an-
nounced that he would continue his offensive against the Phoumi 
forces east of Paksane despite the cease-fire reached at Luang 
Prabang and accused Souvanna of being "very soft." He warned 
that the "people" would have to remove Souvann if he did not 
"lead his country in the right direction." He also made slurring 
remarks about General Ouane, the armed forces commander 
and his ostensible chief. Souvanna subsequently retorted that 
Kong Le "was making up stories. Do not talk about him. That 
will be decided by army headquarters." 
icr 
It is problematical whether Souvanna's top commanders-- 
Ge al Ouane and General Amkha, the Vienti ne garrison 
commander--could win in any test of strength with Kong Le. 
Although the bulk of Kong Le's 2nd Paratroop Battalion is now 
outside of Vientiane, he probably can count on the support of 
the numerous irregulars he armed in the period immediately 
after his 9 August coup d'etat. He is also believed to have gen-
erated considerable popular support in the capital. In earlier 
phases of the crisis, moreover, neither Ouane nor Amkha 
showed much appetite for action against Kong Le. The scales 
might be tipped decisively against Kong Le, however, were 
Phoumi's forces east of Paksane to unite with Amkha's units 
in Vientiane 
� 
-.4 
Phoumi's Radio Savannakhet, meanwhile, has issued an 
ppeal "to our foreign friends" for help in the face of the al-
eged presence in Laos of three North Vietnamese units. 
ch statements, whether true or not, would be calculated to 
excite Thai Premier Sarit and would possibly be used by him 
to justify increased support.,:7he Thai general staff is reported 
to have a plan for direct Thai intervention if its becomes clear 
that the Communists have taken over Vientiane. 
British Ambassador Addis in Vientiane reports being in-
formed by Souvanna that the USSR has accepted Laos' proposal

ahat nonresident diplomatic relations be established. Souvanna 
claimed all he needed now was the approval of the King. Under 
Souvanna's proposal, the Soviet ambassador to Cambodia would 
also be accredited to Laos, while the Laotian ambassador to 
France would be accredited to the USSR. The King's decision 
could well be delayed pending the outcome of political discus-
sions that may result in a new government.7 
The Soviet counselor in Peiping recently told 
that Peiping did not intend to intervene. in Laos, but if the 
Chinese should decide to send troops to counter a United Na-
tions move into Laos, the USSR would support Peiping "even 
to the extent" of sending Soviet troops. The US consul gen-
eral in Hong Kong points out that the authority of the Soviet 
counselor is probably limited but that his statement is indica-
tive of the impression Moscow wants conveyed to the West. 
Moscow propaganda has emphasized the gravity of the La-
otian situation and, together with Peiping and Hanoi, is making 
an effort to forestall intervention by Laos' pro-Western neigh-
bors or the United Nations while avoiding any specific threat 
of bloc counteraction.

Moroccan Government Seeks New Means of Embroiling UN  
In Algerian Question 
The Moroccan Government is reported to have protested 
sharply several recent incidents of alleged shelling by French 
military units in Algeria of Moroccan territory along the east-
ern border of Morocco where several thousand armed Algerian 
rebels are based. Such incidents occur fairly regularly, but 
are seldom publicized. Abdelkhalek Torres�Morocco's acting 
deputy premier and, in the absence of both King Mohamed V 
and Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, the ranking Moroccan offi-
cial--is reported to have decided that should similar incidents 
recur he will order the Moroccan armed forces to take military 
action against the French. 
Such a Moroccan counterattack would be designed to cre-
ate an international incident enabling Morocco to request the 
Intervention of the United Nations, General Ben Hamou 1Cettani, 
commander of Morocco's forces in the Congo, returned to 
Rabat on 29 September and may have been summoned to ad-
vise Torres on this question. Torres is said to have the King's 
permission to take even such extreme measures as military 
retaliation. 
Torres has recently held talks with Algerian rebel leaders, 
who may have sought to enlist Morocco's support in enlarging 
the Algerian conflict just before the question is debated by the 
UN General Assembly. 
Meanwhile, the Tunisian Government is exploring ways 
to implement the Algerian-Tunisian "union" which President 
Bourguiba suggested on 3 September might be formed if such 
an action "would hasten the end of the war." Bourgruiba de-
signed his announcement as a gambit to break the Algerian-
French deadlock resulting from the failure of the Melun talks 
last June and is aware that any such "union" would entail the 
risk of war with France. 
North African leaders apparently consider the use of the 
United Nations forces to restore and maintain order in the

independence if De Gaulle cannot be induced to open negotia-
tions with the rebel leaders. There have been North Africa 
overtures to some of France's NATO allies to exert pressure 
on De Gaulle to reopen talks with the Algerians.

(Allied Regtrictions on Travel by East German Officials 
Some NATO governments now are refusing to cooperate 
in imposing travel restrictions on East German trade and 
travel representatives as a countermeasure to recent East 
German interference with access to West Berlin. Previous-
ly, the Benelux governments had given support to the re-
strictions by a tentative decision to withhold visas from East 
Germans who had not been cleared through the Allied Travel 
Bureau in West Berlin. The Netherlands even suspended 
short-stay permits for those in transit to other countries. 
The Danish Government has informed the American Em-
bassy in Copenhagen that because of trade considerations and 
the importance of cooperation between the Danish and East 
German railway systems, it is unable to concur in the proposed 
restrictions. There is evidence that since early this year, 
the government has been under considerable pressure from 
Danish trade and travel interests to expand contacts with 
East Germany. Despite reported opposition from the justice 
and defense ministries, the Foreign Ministry has acceded to 
certain East German requests for privileges and permitted 
the East German railways to open an office in Copenhagen. 
The Dutch Government has modified its travel ban as a 
result of pressure from the KLM airline on behalf of an East 
German official en route to Cuba, and it now appears likely 
that entry will be granted to East Germans making a stopover 
in transit to other countries. The airline argued that if the 
Netherlands refused such entry, the East Germans would 
merely use alternate routes. 
On 30 September Bonn denounced the 1961 interzonal 
trade pact with East Germany, over the apparent opposition 
of British and French officials. The West German move will 
not affect interzonal trade before the end of the year. Bonn's 
move may compel the East Germans to give meaning to the

hasten the measures needed to make West Berlin a free city." 
Possibly aware that Western countermeasures were being con-
templated, Soviet Foreign Minister Grornyko stressed to Brit-
ish Foreign Secretary Home on 28 September that Moscow was 
"fully aware" of recent East German actions and warned that 
if a crisis developed it would be the fault of the West. He indi-

Opposition tO De Gaulle's European Confederation Plan Lessening  
Hostility to De Gaulle's proposals for a confederation of the 
six Common Market countries, which he first publicly outlined 
in his 5 September press conference, appears to have moderated 
considerably in the past few weeks. Opposition is still strong to 
De Gaulle's related ideas for a revamping of NATO's structure to 
permit France to "speak for" a Continental bloc, but several of 
the Common Market countries seem prepared to accept the con-
federation plan itself as a basis for negotiation. 
Typical of this more receptive attitude is the Italian posi-
tion as outlined by an Italian Embassy spokesman in Washington 
on 26 September. According to him, Rome "strenuously op-
poses" creation of a "restricted steering group" in or outside 
NATO but feels De Gaulle's "proposed version of Europe could 
be accepted in principle." The spokesman explained that Italy 
believes it is impossible to make progress toward political in-
tegration without France and without extending integration be-
yond the economic field. 
Luxembourg's prime minister, who visited Paris in mid-
September, is said to have been "relieved and encouraffed" by 
De Gaulle's exposition of the French position.  
the Belgian foreign minister has also said he agrees with the 
objectives of the De Gaulle plan, which is being considered 
with a "favorable preconception." 
Paris has been attempting since De Gaulle's press con-
ference to give the impression that his plan is open to nego-
tiation and would not weaken the Common Market, Foreign 
Minister Couve de Murville, for example, has publicly re-
ferred to the Common Market as the "cornerstone of the 
European edifice." Considerable interest has also been 
aroused in the Common Market by a series of press articles j

confederation's decisions might ultimately be reached by ma-

To find out whether France is prepared in fact to make any 
such far-reaching concessions will probably be Bonn's major 
objective during French Premier Debre's visit on 7-8 October. 
Adenauer, whose position will be crucial, has remained pub-
licly noncommittal on the confederation plan, but has implied 
certain reservations about it and has freauent17, reiterated his 
strong support of NATO.

Sovi6t Delegation Visits Peiping  
A high-level Soviet delegation has been in Peiping since mid-
September holding discussions with the Chinese on the "ideological 
issue," 
Ovlet Ambassador to India Benediktov 
Informed Indian Party General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh that the five-
man delegation included Presidium members Anastas Mikoyan and 
M. A. Suslov, as well as candidate Presidium member P. N. 
Pospelov. 
Ambassador Thompson reported on 27 September that a rumor 
was circulating in Moscow that Mikovan and Suslov were visiting 
Communist China.   There have been several 
unscheduled VIP -associated flights from Moscow to Peiping, one 
on the 15th of September and another on the 27th. 
A delegation of this stature, including Suslov, the Soviet Union's 
top ideologist, would be empowered to conduct serious negotiations 
with the Chinese in an effort to bring their positions closer together 
so that the forthcoming meeting of Communist parties in Moscow in 
November would not result in the same impasse as the Bucharest 
meeting of last June. The Soviet party may have felt that its efforts 
of the last two months to marshal support for its own views and thus 
isolate the Chinese within the world Communist movement would 
induce the Chinese to adopt positions closer to those of the Soviet 
Union. In addition, the delegation may have been sent to China to 
determine if a meeting of Chinese leaders with Khrushchev during 
his planned visit to North Korea in October would be possible and 
fruitful. 
Recent Chinese propaganda suggests that this latest attempt at 
reconciliation has been as unsuccessful as were earlier attempts 
to resolve the dispute. On 29 September, two weeks after the talks 
were reported to have begun, the CCP Central Committee, in a 
commentary on a new volume of Mao Tse-tung's works, issued its
