 DCI CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING
 THE SOVIET UNION AND DETENTE
 I. Mr. C1-airman, before discussing Soviet strategic
 weapons,      I would like to say a few words about
 the Soviet foreign policy developments we have
 come to call detente.   The Russians are still
 holding to this policy, which is increasingly
 identified with General Secretary Brezhnev.
 When we speak of their policy of detente,
 however,  a careful definition is in order.
 Detente does not mean a change of heart.   Nor
 does it mean that Moscow has abandoned its
 basic objectives.
 1.   We see continuity most clearly in the
 strategic field, as will become evident
 when I discuss weapons development.
 B.   Detente does mean that the Soviets have made a
 reassessment of their situation,  sorted out
 their priorities more carefully, and adjusted
 their behavior accordingly.

 II.   This reassessment has highlighted two basic facts
 for them.
 A.    One is the fact that they are not closing the
 technological gap.   They have now acknowledged
 to themselves that, if they are to begin closing
 it, they need to import and absorb large amounts
 of Western technology.
 1.   They are trying to do this in a number of
 ways.   One is normal trade.   Another is the
 project method, in which a Western firm
 contracts to build and bring into operation
 an entire plant.  A third is the exchange
 of technological data with individual
 Western companies.
 2. As one measure of this effort, Soviet
 orders for Western machinery and equipment
 hit $2.5 billion last year--a 60 percent
 increase over 1972.   The US is a major
 recipient of such orders, but we by no
 means monopolize the field.   Only some
 $435 million of that $2.5 billion was
 placed with American firms.

 TOP SECRET
 Approved For Release 2006/03/17 : CIA-RDP79RO1099AO02200010001-2
 B.   The second basic fact is that Moscow sees
 China as holding a single-minded hostility
 toward the USSR.
 1.    Peking has rebuffed all Soviet overtures
 for an improvement of Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions, and the border negotiations remain
 at square one.
 2.    China devotes the energies of its new
 diplomacy to countering Soviet policy in
 every area of international politics.,
 3.    Moscow realizes that this attitude is not
 just a peculiarity of Mao's personality,
 which will disappear when he does.
 III.    Both the economic factor and the Chinese factor
 are thus fairly long-term ones,  and both work in
 the same direction on Soviet foreign policy.
 A.   Obviously, normal and amicable relations with
 the West are necessary if the Soviets are to
 promote their economic objectives.   Major
 confrontations over Berlin, or Cuba, or the
 Middle East would undermine the chances for
 technological gain.

 TOY SECRET
 Approved For Release 2006/03/17 : CIA-RDP79R01099A00220001.0001-2
 B.   Tense relations with the West would also expose
 the USSR to the risk of pressure on two fronts:
 Western and Eastern.   So long as China remains
 actively hostile,  the Soviets have a strong
 interest in keeping relations with the West
 on an even keel.
 1.   In particular, they want to give as little
 encouragement as possible to cooperation
 between China and the US--which appears to
 them as collusion against the Soviet Union.
 C.    There are positive political incentives as
 well.  Detente provides a useful climate for
 the extension of Soviet influence in Western
 Europe.   It also promotes the concept of So-
 viet equality with the US and Moscow's claim
 of its right to be involved in all interna-
 tional questions.
 IV.  These current priorities have some impact on re-
 lations with the US.   Moscow is no longer so ac-
 tive and automatic in opposing US policy in every
 corner of the globe.
 A.   This has helped, for example, to get a Viet-
 nam settlement and to bring about negotiations

 T6,9T/  ECR

 in the Middle East. It has not, of course,
 solved major problems in either area, nor
 do the Soviets intend to do that.
 B. Brezhnev's personal prestige is commited to
 detente.   Last year he made his biggest gains
 with his trips to Bonn and Washington.
 1.  All Brezhnev's politburo colleagues now
 acknowledge his preeminent position but
 he is aware he cannot get too far ahead
 of them, and must show some fruits of
 detente.
 2.  Coping with Solzhentsyn and other dissi-
 dents poses a continuing dilemma of how
 to square the needs of domestic discipline
 with foreign policy considerations.
 C.    Record grain production led the economy to a
 comeback from a dismal 1972 showing, but Mos-
 cow's goal of overtaking the US remains as dis-
 tant as ever.   The USSR still produces only
 about half as much as the US with a labor
 force 50 percent larger.
 V.  Logically, detente should also lead to a further
 easing of the arms race.   But this has not happened

 Approved For Release 2006103/17 : CIA-RDP79RO1099AO02200010001-2
 yet.   The Soviet strategic programs which I shall
 describe do not violate the SALT agreements, but
 they represent a powerful competitive thrust in
 the areas not covered by those agreements, mainly
 in the area of qualitative improvement.
 A.   Thus far, Moscow seems to believe that it can
 proceed on a vigorous program of weapons
 modernization while simultaneously getting
 the political and economic benefits of detente.
 B.   The Russians will probably hold to this course
 unless they are persuaded of two things:
 --that if they try to push past a relationship
 strategic equality, they will provoke US reac-
 tions which will deny them any strategic gain
 and perhaps even worsen their position; and
 --that Soviet restraint would be reciprocated
 on terms that would give the USSR both the
 image and the substance of equality.

 DCI CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING
 SOVIET DEFENSE EXPENDITURES
 I. I would like to conclude this overview of the So-
 viet military effort with a brief discussion of a
 subject that this committee is familiar with--the
 costs of military programs.   Our evidence indicates
 that the Soviet leaders,  too, pay close attention
 to their defense spending.   They apparently be-
 lieve, however, that their economy is capable of
 sustaining or even accelerating the pace of defense
 spending.
 A.  Our calculations of the absolute values of So-
 viet defense costs contain uncertainties, but
 we can depict overall trends in defense spend-
 ing with some confidence.   Since 1960, the
 trend has been generally upward, increasing
 at an average annual rate of about 3 percent.
 1.   For the last few years, however, ruble
 spending has remained at essentially the
 same level, reflecting the fact that the

 USSR is between major strategic procure-
 ment cycles.
 a.   Procurement of weapon systems developed
 in the 1960s, and now deployed, was
 largely completed by the end of 1970,
 and procurement of the strategic sys-
 tems now under development has not
 yet begun.
 2.   The USSR recently announced that defense
 spending would decline by about one per-
 cent in 1974.   We regard this announced
 cut as largely a political gesture, rather
 than an indicator of actual spending.
 3.   Our estimates of Soviet spending for 1974--
 which are based on observed and projected
 changes in military and space programs and
 forces--show a slight increase in total
 defense outlays.
 4.   Moreover, we expect to see--if not a spend-
 ing splurge--at least a substantial upswing
 in Soviet expenditures for procurement in
 1975 and 1976.   By then, production of the
 new strategic systems now under development
 should begin.

 TOP SECRET
 Approved For Release 2006/03/17 : CIA-RDP79R01099A002200010001-2
 5.  The share of total defense funds allo-
 cated to military R&D and space has
 grown steadily over the last five years.
 In fact, outlays for these purposes have
 been the fastest rising element of de-
 fense spending and now account for about
 one-third of the total.   We expect growth
 in military R&D to moderate over the next
 few years, however,  as the USSR begins
 procurement of new strategic systems.
 6.   As for manpower, the Soviets devote less
 than 40 percent of their defense spend-
 ing to this purpose--as opposed to more
 than 50 percent for the United States.
 The shares for active duty pay and al-
 lowances,  however, are much closer.   Never-
 theless, the Soviets are able to keep 65
 percent more men under arms--simply by
 paying their conscripts much less than
 we pay our soldiers.
 II.  We measure the Soviet defense effort in dollars-
 calculating as if their purchases had been made
 in the US--in order to compare the magnitude of
 Approved For Release 2/'93/   CC"&P79R01099A002200010001-2
 TOP SECRET
 Approved For Release 2006/03/17 : CIA-RDP79R01099A002200010001-2
 their defense effort with ours.   By this calcula-
 tion, the defense efforts of the two countries
 are about the same size.
 A.   From the. late 1950s until 1970,  the dollar
 value of US defense outlays exceeded those
 of the USSR.   Since 1970 the Soviet effort,
 measured in dollars, has exceeded that of
 the US.
 1.   This catching up is a result of steady
 increases in Soviet spending, while US
 spending--measured in constant prices--
 has been declining since 1968.
 B. In terms of the structure of defense spend-
 ing measured in dollars, the US and USSR
 present a similar picture.   In 1973, the
 amount of resources allocated to procurement
 was about the same.   The dollar value of So-
 viet spending for operating their forces ex-
 ceeded US expenditures slightly.  We estimate
 that the dollar value of the Soviet R&D ef-
 fort also exceeded that of the US in 1973.
 1.   I would point out, however, that Soviet
 R&D spending is more difficult for us to

 measure precisely than other defense ex-
 penditures because of the fragmentary data
 available in this area.
 C.  While the comparison between the dollar values
 of Soviet and US spending reflects levels of
 effort, I want to emphasize that spending is
 not the sole measure of military capabilities,
 and does not necessarily result in equal ef-
 fectiveness of troops or equipment.

 DCI CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING
 CHINA
 I. One can hardly mention the Soviet Union without
 thinking of China.   I would like to bring you up
 to date on the internal political situation,  for-
 eign policy trends, the progress the Chinese are
 making toward a nuclear deterrent, and chances of
 hostilities with the Soviet Union.
 The Domestic Scene
 II. As you know,  the Tenth Party Congress took place
 last August, and it has given us a new basis for
 assessing the domestic political scene.
 A.   The congress was the shortest since the Com-
 munists gained power in 1949, suggesting that
 the leadership wanted to avoid a full discus-
 sion of many controversial policy issues.
 The meeting focused on reconstructing the top
 organs of the party after the disruptions of
 the Lin Piao affair and the earlier Cultural
 Revolution.

 TOP SECRE
 Approved For Release 2006/03/17 : CIA-RTP79R01099A002200010001-2
 1.   The congress adopted a revised party con-
 stitution, which deleted a specific refer-
 ence in the previous version to Lin as
 Mao's designated successor but did not
 name a new heir.
 C.   The new Politburo, like its predecessor, had--
 until very recently--21 full members and four
 alternates.   It is a mix of moderate officials,
 radical ideologues, military men and elder
 statesmen--a coalition of divergent interests
 that seems roughly balanced between moderates
 and ultraleftists.
 1.  All of the active members of the previous
 Politburo retained their positions, and
 nine new faces appeared.
 2.  Within the last two weeks, one more name
 has been added.   Teng Hsiao-ping, a former
 secretary-general of the party who was
 purged during the Cultural Revolution and
 then rehabilitated last year, regained
 the seat he used to have on the Politburo.
 a.   His reinstatement is an indication
 that other rehabilitated party and

 government officials who were vic-
 tims of the Cultural Revolution will
 again be given positions of respon-
 sibility.
 D.   Chou En-lai is clearly the number two man in
 China, but he is only one of five vice chair-
 men elected at the congress.
 1. The others are two military men, an aging
 radical who is largely inactive, and the
 rising young official from Shanghai, Wang
 Hung-wen.  Wang is only in his mid-thirties,
 and was a radical during the Cultural Revo-
 lution.   His elevation is the leadership's
 acknowledgement that there must be new blood
 in the highest councils.
 2. This group presumably will serve as a col-
 lective leadership when Mao dies, although
 the revised party constitution did not so
 stipulate.
 III.   The army's role in politics has been a controver-
 sial issue.
 A.   Army leaders were thrust into politics simply
 because the party and civil administrations

 were shattered by the Cultural Revolution.  As
 soon as the dust of that phenomenon began to
 settle, and particularly after the Lin Piao
 affair, the civilian authorities started to
 reassert their control over the military.
 B. On New Year's Day Peking revealed a massive
 reshuffle, affecting the commanders of seven
 of the 11 military regions and the head of
 the army's General Political Department.
 1.   The transfers separated the leaders from
 their provincial power bases in which all
 but one had concurrently headed the pro-
 vincial party committee.
 C.  The reinstatement of Teng Hsiao-ping also is
 important to this move as he has been assigned,
 even though a civilian, to the party's Mili-
 tary Commission.
 IV.   Let me,  finally,  say a few words about "Confucius."
 A.  In August 1973 Peking's major propaganda out-
 lets began to feature articles attacking the
 ancient sage Confucius  (around 550 B.C.) and
 his followers.   They were depicted as conser-
 vative, tradition-bound forces who were

 successfully opposed at crucial periods of
 Chinese history by more progressive elements.
 1.  It is clear that this campaign has direct
 relevance to what is going on-today in
 China, and that "Confucius" is some actual
 person.   There is much speculation among
 China specialists--and among the Chinese
 themselves--about the purpose of the
 whole affair.
 2.   Some observers see the campaign as an
 attempt to reinvigorate the populace with
 the "revolutionary" spirit so dear to Mao.
 3.   Another view holds that the campaign is
 part of a bitter feud between radical
 and moderate forces in the party's top
 leadership.   The radicals--led by Madame
 Mao--are said to be attacking Chou En-lai
 in an effort to protect the leftist poli-
 cies of the Cultural Revolution.
 4. Our analysts see the campaign as the open-
 ing round in the succession struggle.   They
 believe Chou En-lai and Madame Mao differ
 sharply over the conduct of foreign and

 domestic policy, and see the campaign as
 Chou's effort to keep Chinese policy on
 the moderate course that he was able to
 set--with Mao's support--after the Cul-
 tural Revolution.
 5.  Madame Mao has limited political power
 of her own, but is apparently the rally-
 ing point for disaffected elements in
 the power structure, especially those
 military leaders who are unhappy over
 their diminishing political power.
 B.   The campaign is of major political importance,
 but we do not believe it will escalate into
 the chaos of another Cultural Revolution.
 1.   Chou En-lai is in the strongest position
 of his long political career, and is
 firmly opposed to excessive measures.
 The 75-year-old Chou, however, will not
 be around indefinitely.
 Chinese Foreign Policy
 V.   In foreign policy, Peking remains on the course
 mapped out two or three years ago.   The main con-
 cern of Chou En-lai is to counter Soviet efforts
 to isolate China.

 A.  One of his and Mao's main weapons is "detente"
 with the United States.
 1.    Secretary Kissinger's visit last autumn
 gave Peking an opportunity to demonstrate
 the importance it attaches to detente.
 2.    Mao's long meeting with the Secretary--
 nearly two hours--set the seal of high-
 est authority on the policy of continuing--
 and improving--relations with Washington.
 B.   The Chinese also seem anxious to forestall
 any significant improvement of relations be-
 tween Japan and the Soviet Union.
 1.   Peking would like to limit possible So-
 viet-Japanese cooperation in exploiting
 economic resources in Siberia.
 C.   In Indochina, Peking seems to be trying to
 reduce the potential for friction with the

 military presence in North Laos.
 D.   US actions and attitudes during the recent
 Mideast fighting seem to have favorably im-
 pressed the Chinese.
 1. Behind the scenes, they have urged re-
 straint and caution on the Arabs in po-
 litical and military matters, as well
 as on the question of the oil embargo.
 E.      Peking has been particularly concerned over
 the possible effects of the embargo on West-
 ern Europe.   The Chinese do not want to see
 this area weakened as a counterweight to the
 Soviet Union.
 1. Chinese diplomats continue to caution
 European governments against Soviet
 blandishments, and are stressing the
 importance of NATO in the world balance.
 Chinese Strategic Weapons
 VI.   Turning to the Chinese military establishment,
 we see that the strategic weapons program which
 has moved forward, although not forcefully, over
 the years.   Today China is a nuclear power.   It
 can deliver nuclear weapons against targets on

 Will There Be War With Russia?
 XI.     The question naturally arises as to whether these
 Chinese weapons programs are increasing the likeli-
 hood of war between China and the Soviet Union.
 :Last month Premier Kosygin aptly described Sino-
 Soviet relations as "frozen," and Moscow makes
 frequent references to "the Chinese threat."  On
 the other side, there is genuine fear in Peking
 that the Soviets might spring a surprise attack.
 In spite of all this, we do not foresee a major
 military move by either side.
 A. Chinese deployments show an awareness of So-
 viet military superiority,  and are focused
 on defense.
 1.      Having learned the virtues of restraint
 from their difficulties along the border
 in 1969,  the Chinese seem likely to re-
 sist any temptation to test Moscow's
 tolerance.
 B.   From the Soviet side, there are strong mili-

 tary and political considerations that would
 make a premeditated attack unlikely.
 1.   Moscow has told its people that a dis-
 arming nuclear strike against Chinese
 strategic missile launchers would not
 be without retaliation.
 2.   A land invasion could very well get
 bogged down.
 3.   Politically,  a major Soviet move would
 end any possibility of reconciliation
 with China, and could jeopardize detente
 with the US.
 C.    On a lower level of combat, however, the So-
 viets might try to punish and humiliate Chi-
 nese border forces patrolling in disputed ter-
 ritory.

 DCI CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING
 THE MILITARY SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST
 I.     When the Israeli-Egyptian disengagement agreement was
 signed last week,  the armed forces of both countries
 were deployed on a war footing.   They may well remain
 in this posture for some time, while preparing for
 actual disengagement.

 OTHER ARAB STATES
 I.   Looking elsewhere in the Middle East, we see that
 Libya's potentially troublesome.   President Qadhafi
 is isolated as a result of the Arab decision to go
 to Geneva.   Nevertheless, his history of erratic
 behavior suggests that he will find some way to
 rock the boat.
 A.    His denunciation of the conduct of the war,
 the acceptance of the cease-fire, and the
 disengagement talks,  have strained his re-
 lations with Egypt.
 1.   An open break has been avoided, but the
 merger is dead.  Libyan aid to Egypt and
 military cooperation has dwindled.
 2.   His latest merger proposal--with Tunisia--
 will probably never get off the ground.
 3.   Qadhafi's extreme position has reduced
 his influence in other Arab capitals.
 B.      Libya, however, has drawn closer to radical
 fedayeen elements,  and may have increased its

 aid to them.   Specifically, the Libyans are
 being linked to the terrorist attack at Rome
 airport last December.
 1. Qadhafi formerly favored terrorism aimed
 directly at Israel, but now seems to ap-
 prove of anything that might sabotage a
 negotiated settlement.
 II.      Within Libya, Qadhafi's policies are seldom
 challenged by his colleagues on the ruling
 Revolutionary Command Council.
 A.   President Sadat--once a moderating influence
 on his neighbor--now appears too occupied
 to help control Qadhafi's activism.
 B.   Even if Qadhafi were replaced, his most logi-
 cal successor--Prime Minister Jallud--shows
 signs of being only slightly more manageable.
 III.   We are also concerned about the Persian Gulf
 area.   Its vast oil reserves make its stability
 a matter of great importance to the United States.
 A.   Saudi Arabia and Iran are relatively stable,
 and probably will remain so for the next sev-
 eral years.   Both countries. have made succes-
 sion arrangements,  and their polices probably

 will not change greatly after the present
 leaders disappear.
 B. The picture in the smaller gulf states is
 mixed.
 1.     Oman is facing an active rebellion by
 a group of Marxist guerrillas, who are
 heavily supported by neighboring Yemen
 (Aden)  and have received arms indirectly
 from the USSR.
 2.     The United Arab Emirates--now two years
 old--looks more viable than many expected.
 Its seven sheikdoms--pasted together by
 the British just before their departure--
 have been in continual rivalry.   A recent
 governmental shakeup, however, holds at
 least the promise of a more effective cen-
 tral government.
 3.   Bahrain has recently elected its first
 parliament, and it has a large leftist
 contingent.  Hence the decision taken
 during the Middle East war to terminate
 the agreement by which US naval forces
 in the area can use the former British

 base is unlikely to be reversed.
 C.    Elsewhere on the Arabian Peninsula,  the sit-
 uation between the two Yemens--Sana and Aden--
 remains troubled, although less so then in
 the fall of 1972 when war seemed possible.
 D.    Countries in the Persian Gulf have taken some
 hesitant steps toward regional security coop-
 eration, partly in response to our prodding.
 But the old rivalries and cultural differences
 die very slowly.
 1.   The Saudis are suspicious of Iran's inten-
 tions on the Arab side of the Gulf, while
 the smaller Arab states fear that any re-
 gional security arrangement would be dom-
 inated by Saudi Arabia or Iran, and swallow
 them up.
 E.    The USSR has a growing interest in the Gulf,
 fanned by Western dependence on oil and pos-
 sibly by interest in Iraq's shore facilities
 for Soviet naval forces.   Moscow has tried--
 unsuccessfully--to establish relations with
 the Saudis or to open diplomatic posts in
 the lower Gulf States.

 F,   Iraq, however, receives substantial economic
 aid and is almost entirely dependent on the
 Soviets for major military hardware.
 G.   In addition to their activities in the Persian
 Gulf, the Soviets keep a modest naval force
 (usually a destroyer or cruiser, a diesel
 submarine, and a few minesweepers and auxil-
 laries) in the Indian Ocean.  They demonstrated
 a capability to increase this presence during
 the Indo-Pakistani war in 1971, and in the
 aftermath of the Middle East war last fall.
 1. The Soviets have broad cooperation treaties
 with India and Iraq, and "arrangements"
 with South Yemen and Somalia.  They have
 built naval support facilities near Berbera,
 in Somalia.
 2. We expect this Soviet naval present to grow
 gradually--regardless of whether the Suez
 Canal is reopened.   The Indian Ocean is not
 a high priority area for the Soviets, how-
 ever, and how they expand their presence will
 depend, in large measure, on what the US does.
 We believe they would make every effort to
 match a US buildup.

 DCI CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING
 THE OIL SITUATION
 I.  You of course noted that in discussing the sit-
 uation in the Middle East,  I made scant refer-
 ence to the oil problem.   Let me now point out
 some of the ramifications of the Arab' use of
 oil as a weapon.
 II..  Arab oil production is now up slightly,  and there
 are some prospects for an end of the embargo.
 Consequently,  the high price rather than the supply
 of oil becomes the most important energy problem
 facing the United States and the other consuming
 nations.
 A.   The Persian Gulf producers have raised taxes
 to about $7.00 a barrel--up 360% in less than
 one year.
 1.   The other major exporters have also upped
 taxes.
 B.   This year's world oil bill will increase by
 $70 billion,  to a total of over $110 billion
 at current production levels.
 1.   The United States' bill will rise by

 $16 billion,  to $25 million this year.   For
 Western Europe,  the jump will be $33 billion
 to $55 billion, and Japan's price will increase
 by $11 billion,  to $18 billion.
 2.    It will be difficult for consuming coun-
 tries to provide this purchasing power,
 and some industrial countries may not meet
 the challenge.
 C.   Some lesser developed countries will be ex-
 tremely hard hit.
 1.    Oil payments will take 40% of India's ex-
 port earnings,  for example.
 2.    The oil states have initially turned a deaf
 ear to pleas from these countries for lower
 prices, but they may provide some fi-
 nancing aid.
 D.   While the consumers are shelling out, oil
 revenues of the OPEC countries will nearly
 quadruple this year--$90 billion,  compared
 with about $25 billion in 1973.
 1.   The Arab countries alone will receive al-
 most $50 billion even if their production

 remains at the current level.   They may
 end 1974 with a current account surplus
 of about $40 billion--much of which will
 be deposited in Western banks.
 E. Prices may be lowered later in the year if
 a world-wide recession appears in the offing.
 1.   The Shah of Iran was largely responsible
 for the record price hikes, but it was
 Saudi acquiescence that made them stick.
 2.   The Saudis feel the price is much too
 high and will have disastrous effects
 on the world economy.
 3.   The Saudis could eventally force prices
 down by raising output substantially.
 Other producers are pleased with present
 prices and any move to reduce them would
 be politically unpopular.
 F.   The economies of the oil importing nations will
 be severely strained by the massive price increase.
 Oil importing nations face reduced rates of
 economic growth and increased unemployment unless
 expansionary measures are taken.

 1.   Governments will be cautious in inflating
 demand, however, because of the already
 high inflation and the uncertain impact
 of the energy supply constraint on produc-
 tive capacity.
 2.   Major governments will be hesitant to
 move forward on reform issues until
 economic prospects become clearer.
 3.   Attempts to improve deteriorating trade
 balances--through import restraints or
 competitive devaluation--could aggravate
 international economic tensions.
 III.   The use of cutbacks in oil production as  a political
 weapon is being undermined by oil company diversions,
 and is slowly being abandoned.
 A.     The world-wide rationing system instituted
 by the oil companies has greatly reduced the
 difference between "hostile," "neutral," and
 "favored" nations.
 1.   The Netherlands,  theoretically embargoed,
 has not been hit much harder than other
 European countries.
 2.    The United States is receiving more oil
 than would be the case if the embargo

 ware fully implemented.
 3.   On the other hand, many favored countries--
 particularly Spain and those of Black
 Africa--have complained that they are
 not receiving their full share of imports
 as promised by the Arabs.
 B. There has also been some leakage of Arab oil,
 but we do not know the exact amounts.
 1.   Libya, for example, with no interest in
 promoting a .Middle East settlement, may be
 allowing some of its oil to reach the United
 States through Caribbean refineries.
 C.   The steady expansion of the Arabs' favored
 nation list will soon require production in-
 creases if all of these nations are to re-
 ceive the promised amounts of oil.
 1.   The list now includes France, the United
 Kingdom,  Belgium, Spain, Japan, Brazil,
 India,  the Philippines,  Taiwan, all Mos-
 lem nations, and those African states
 that have broken with Israel.
 2.   The Arabs are allowing oil to transit
 Rotterdam, and may allow the Dutch to
 refine Arab crude for other countries.

 D.   Several Arab leaders have'stressed that the
 oil weapon is a temporary diplomatic maneuver
 that will be modified as soon as progress is
 made on Arab-Israeli issues.
 1.      There are persistent rumors that the
 Saudis may unilaterally drop the embargo
 against the United States.
 E.   if the embargo against the United States and
 the Netherlands is dropped, those against
 South Africa, Rhodesia, and Portugal may be
 maintained as a favor to the Arabs' African
 supporters.
 IV.   Moscow, for its part, undoubtedly sees benefits in
 the Arab oil boycott, but also has some misgivings.
 A.   The Soviets had virtually no control over
 the Arab decision to curtail oil flow.
 1.   Soviet propaganda has hailed the action.,
 however,  and-encouraged nationalization
 of more Western holdings.
 B.   The Russians have welcomed strains in US
 relations with Europe and Japan caused by
 the boycott and price increases.
 1.   They have also pointed to the boycott
 as another reason for Western firms to
 help develop Soviet energy resources.

 C.   Moscow is concerned, however, that the oil
 weapon could backfire and harm relations with
 the US and Europe.
 1.   The Soviets have testily denied specula-
 tion that they are behind the Arab ac-
 tion,  and have not been gloating over
 the problems it has caused in the West.
 2.   They have kept up their oil deliveries
 to Western Europe despite Arab cries
 that they are undercutting the boycott.
 V.   As for future oil developments, we believe that
 there is a better than even chance that in 1974:
 .-Production will exceed the 1973 level.
 --A marked slowdown in economic activities world-
 wide will put substantial pressure on the oil
 producers to lower prices.
 --There is likely to be a new polarization;  the
 oil producers with their enormous new wealth on
 one side and the consuming world on the other.
 --The national scramble for oil will continue as
 countries seek assured supplies.   These countries
 cannot,  however, protect themselves from the im-
 pact of high oil prices.

 DCI CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING
 US -EUROPEAN RELATIONS
 I.   Mr. Chairman,  I would like to touch on US-Euro-
 pean relations.   These relations are, of course,
 a compound of political,             security,  economic, and
 monetary concerns--all inter-connected. Our prob-
 lems with the Europeans will not be sorted out
 either easily or quickly.
 II.    The ambivalence in our current relationship with
 Europe was illustrated by the sharply differing
 responses of Europe and the US to the Mid-East
 conflict.   Our differences in this crisis ac-
 celerated reassessments of Atlantic solidarity--
 reassessments which had long been under way.
 A.   Both sides saw new reasons for questioning
 the adequacy of existing consultation pro-
 cedures.
 1.        The Europeans claimed the US took action
 that could have endangered their security
 without consulting them.

 2.   The US felt the Europeans did not sup-
 port measures to counter a Soviet threat
 to both American and European interests.
 B.   The frequent US-Soviet communications dur-
 ing and after the conflict created further
 doubt in European minds as to whether the
 US still gives priority to the Alliance over
 US-Soviet arrangements.
 III.      Nevertheless, the reciminations of last fall have
 now moderated in the face of widespread desire to
 keep Alliance relations from deteriorating further.
 A.   Soviet actions in the Middle East have reminded
 the Europeans of the Russian threat--and the
 basic purpose of NATO.
 B.   The December NATO meetings in Brussels helped
 to improve the atmosphere.
 1.   New procedures for NATO political consul-
 tations--although perhaps not exactly
 what the US has suggested--may result.
 C.   Work on two Atlantic declarations--one to be
 issued with the European Community and one
 the result of NATO deliberations--is again
 proceeding.

 between East and West.
 C.   In the Vienna force-reduction negotiations
 the Allies maintained a united front during
 the first round, but West European skepticism
 about the venture has increased.
 1. Many Europeans once viewed the negotia-
 tions as a good opportunity to reduce
 their own forces, but now most are con-
 cerned that the negotiations could con-
 strain future European cooperation on
 defense.
 2. The Soviets interest in cutting West Ger-
 man forces has made even the detente-
 minded Germans more cautious about the
 extent to which West European forces
 should be included in'the reductions.
 3. Given these concerns,  the Europeans can
 be expected to favor a go-slow approach
 to the negotiations.

 very difficult problem of finding a valid inter-

 institutional basis--despite the determina-
 tion of the Community to increase coordina-
 tion of foreign policies on such matters as
 Atlantic relations,  the Middle East, and
 East-West detente.   Consequently "European"
 positions are often the lowest common denom-
 inator of the various national positions.
 B.    Furthermore, many of the European governments
 are in poor health politically.
 1.   Germany, which will chair the EC's in-
 stitutions during the next six months,
 hopes to get things moving, but recently
 the steam seems to have gone out of Willy
 Brandt's government.
 2.   France's political malaise reflects a

 4.   Italy's coalition government system is

 ness of the EC as an agent of unified action,
 there is strong sentiment in Europe for unity.

 DCI CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING
 INDOCHINA
 Vietnam
 I.   Turning to Indochina, Mr. Chairman, we see that
 the war in South Vietnam still sputters a year
 after the Paris accord was signed.
 A.   It is worth noting, however, that the level
 of fighting has dropped since the signing of
 the accord.
 1. Casualties in the last year,  for example,
 while still high, were down significantly
 compared with the previous year.
 a.   On the Communist side, they declined
 from over 160,000 to about 41,000.
 b.   Government losses dropped from 36,000
 killed to around 15,000.
 B.   Significant fighting continues, however,  and
 engagements are sometimes intense.
 1. Two of the peak periods last year were
 just after the cease-fire was signed on
 January 28th,  and just before the second
 agreement on June 15th that tightened it up,

 TOP SECRET
 Approved For Release 2006/03/17 : CIA-RDP79R01099A002200010001-2
 2. In both periods, the fighting resulted
 largely from last-minute Communist ef-
 forts to grab additional territory that
 they hoped to keep permanently if the
 cease-fire proved effective.
 3.    In most cases, however, the South Viet-
 namese were able to push the Communists
 back, and Saigon probably controls more
 territory today than it did a year ago.
 C.   The larger battles have been fought primarily
 over remote government outposts in areas
 the Communist use for supply movements.
 II. The question remains whether the North Vietnamese
 will launch a major offensive in the current dry
 season, which ends in May.
 A.   Hanoi's intention to gain control of the South,
 by military force if necessary, remains unchanged.
 B.   Late last year we concluded, after a thorough
 examination, that it was a close choice whether
 an offensive would occur this dry season.
 C.   Since then, although analysts still differ,
 there is general agreement that the chances of
 an offensive have declined.

 Approved For Release 2006/03/17 : CIA-RDP79R01099A002200010001-2
 D.   Our evidence over the past several months
 has had many conflicting strands.
 1. On the one hand, Hanoi has moved large
 quantities of war materiel into South Vietnam.
 It also has more troops in the South than
 it did at the start of the 1972 offensive.
 2. On the other hand, infiltration of replacements
 for anticipated losses,. which in previous years
 has been one of our most dependable indicators
 of Communist intentions--has been less this
 dry season than we might have expected.
 a.   So far only about 22,000 regular combat
 troops have set out for South Vietnam--
 mostly for the central highlands and the
 southern part of the country.
 b.   Infiltration rates have fluctuated
 greatly in earlier years, but they
 have not been this. low at a
 comparable point in the dry season
 for at least five years.
 c.   Moreover, it appears that the mili-
 tary conscription effort in the North
 was smaller in 1973.

 d.      Hanoi could still move enough troops
 south to sustain an offensive this
 dry season.   In fact, since the first of
 the year troops have been moving through
 the infiltration system at a fairly brisk-
 pace--approaching 500 men a day.
 3.   Inside South Vietnam, Communist briefers
 have recently asserted that no offensive
 is planned.
 III.      The level of fighting is likely to increase as both sides
 probe for weaknesses along the ill-defined lines that
 separate them.
 A.   The danger of heavy combat is greatest in the
 far north of the country where the Communist forces

 are strongest, and in the central provinces where
 they are seeking better access to populated areas.
 B.     For its part, the government is thinking of
 recapturing land lost in the western border regions
 last year.   The Communists are sure to resist
 especially at strategic locations and along
 key transport routes.
 IV.       Talks on a political settlement between the Thieu
 government and the Viet Cong have made little
 headway.
 A.    Both sides have been mainly concerned with
 gaining propaganda advantage, and have
 shown little inclination to compromise
 their positions.
 V.         The Thieu government has improved its
 position vis-a-vis its Communist and non-
 Communist opponents during the past year.
 A.    Senate elections last summer gave Thieu
 firm control over both houses of the
 legislature for the first time.
 B.    The President has continued to develop his
 Democracy Party to strengthen his political
 apparatus throughout the country.

 Approved For Release 206/03117 CCIA RDP79R01099A002200010001-2
 C.    A presidential decree on political parties
 early last year has served to further
 weaken the already factionalized
 opposition parties.
 D.    The opposition has been unable to do much more than
 complain loudly about three constitutional
 amendments enacted last week.   These will permit
 Thieu to run for a third term,  and strengthen
 the powers of the presidency.
 E.    The government is implementing a broad
 program of admimistrati?ve reforms to
 improve its performance and standing in
 rural areas, although the program is be-
 hind schedule and its scope has been
 reduced.
 VI.      The most serious problem is in the country's economy.
 A.    South Vietnam still depends heavily on
 foreign economic aid, although it has
 been trying to diversify its sources of
 aid through agreements with countries
 such as Japan and France.
 B.  Inflation is a chronic problem, and prices
 rose some 67 percent last year.
 C.  The government, however, staved off the

 most severe threat of serious rice shortages
 late last year.
 Cambodia
 VII.      In Cambodia, the Khmer Communists continue to
 threaten the Lon Nol government's survival.
 They are now in the first phases of their dry
 season offensive.
 A.  Fighting has centered in the immediate Phnom Penh
 area, particularly against the capital's north-
 western defenses.
 1.   Government forces have contained this effort,
 but the city and its airport still get sporadic
 -rocket and mortar fire.
 B.   The Communists, meanwhile, are preparing for a
 major move against Phnom Penh's southern defenses.
 1.   They are planning coordinated attacks along a
 ten-mile front below the city.
 2.   The Communists'. deadline for these attacks
 has already slipped, however.
 3.   Many Communist units in this sector have had serious
 manpower problems, and have suffered from supply
 shortages.
 4.   The Cambodian Army is shoring up its southern
 defenses in anticipation of the Communist
 attacks.

 C.   In the countryside, the Communists'  strategy
 of cutting off Phnom Penh's overland supply
 lines has had considerable success.
 VIII.        The Communists' dry season combat capabilities
 have been improved by a recent substantial
 delivery of Vietnamese Communist military
 equipment.
 A.   Hanoi is giving the insurgents 900 tons of
 arms, ammunition, and other equipment, plus
 296 trucks, in exchange for 5,000 tons of
 rice.
 B.   The evidence suggests that the equipment
 is the bulk of North Vietnam's contribution
 to the Khmer Communists for this dry season.
 1. Hanoi may Judge that this'-level of
 support is enough to retain its
 leverage with the insurgents--but not
 enough for a decided military edge over
 Phnom Penh.
 Laos
 IX.       In Laos, the coalition government called for
 by the September protocol to the February 1973
 peace agreement is nowhere in sight.   The cease-
 fire, however, is holding remarkably well.

 A.   Prime Minister Souvanna is doing all he
 can to get negotiations on track.
 1.      He has been communicating with his
 half-brother, Lao Communist leader
 Prince Souphanovong,  and trying to
 get the Pathet Lao to negotiate seriously.
 2.      He believes, however, that Hanoi will
 keep the Pathet Lao from negotiating
 seriously until the end of the current
 dry season, because of the importance
 of the Ho Chi Minh trail supply
 network in support of Communist
 military activities in South Vietnam
 and Cambodia.
 B.   The delay in formation of the new government
 has produced growing frustration and un-
 easiness on both sides.
 1.    Coup rumblings allegedly involving
 disgruntled conservatives have been
 making the rounds in Vientiane, but
 there is no hard evidence.that any
 serious plotting is underway.
 C.      Hanoi has withdrawn some of its forces since the

 1.   As many as three North Vietnamese combat
 regiments have redeployed from southern
 Laos--at least one back to North Vietnam.   There
 are indications that additional redeployments
 may soon occur.
 2.   More recently, the first significant withdrawals
 of North Vietnamese combat units from northern
 Laos were detected.   Major elements of the North
 Vietnamese 316th Division returned to the
 fatherland in December.
 3.   However, an estimated 62,000 North Vietnamese
 troops are still in Laos--33,000 in combat
 units, and another 29,000 in logistic and
 administrative outfits.
 D.   The Chinese have also begun to scale down their
 military presence in northern Laos.

 their air defense troops have returned to
 China, and there are preparations for the
 withdrawal of the two infantry regiments which
 have provided ground security for Chinese

 X.       Although Thailand, strictly speaking, is not part
 of Indochina, I would like to touch on recent
 developments in that country.
 A.   Prime Minister Sanya's new civilian government
 has made slow but steady progress toward
 constitutional government since the student
 uprising ousted the Thanom-Praphat military regime
 last October.
 1.   A constitutional drafting committee was quickly
 formed, and the government apparently intends
 to live up to promises of early promulgation.
 2.   The King's appointment last month of a broadly
 based interim assembly promises to broaden
 popular participation in the emerging civilian
 political system.
 B.   The King's unprecedented emergence into the political
 arena is a salient feature of the new situation.
 1.   His immense prestige will help the still
 somewhat timorous civilian administration in
 guiding Thailand toward a more democratic
 system of government.

 C.   The military appears resigned to a diminished
 role, and has shown a willingness to give the
 new government time to prove itself.
 D.   Preoccupation with domestic problems has caused
 Bangkok to limit its foreign policy initiatives to
 the resumption of a dialogue with China.   Bangkok
 is heartened by a friendly Chinese attitude, but
 still seems inclined to defer diplomatic relations.

 DCI.CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING
 A GLANCE AT LATIN AMERICA
 I. I would like to conclude this prepared statement
 with a short overview of Latin America, covering
 the relations of these countries with the US as a
 group.   Then, very briefly, I will discuss develop-
 ments in a few of the countries.
 A. During the question period this afternoon, I
 will be glad to return to these countries in
 more detail, or look at others not mentioned
 this morning.
 II. Latin Americans hope that regional relations with
 the US, in their view far from fruitful over the
 last few years, are about to improve.   In general,
 they have felt excluded from the range of US interests.
 A.   Secretary Kissinger's offer to meet with their
 foreign ministers is guardedly interpreted as a
 signal that the US is now ready to give serious
 attention to hemispheric concerns.
 B.   The Latin Americans regard their "Document of
 Bogota"--hammered out last November for the

 meeting with Secretary Kissinger--as a useful
 contribution toward a constructive dialogue.
 (It did produce an unusual consensus for a
 responsible position paper.)
 C. Opportunities for a sustained exchange are
 seen in the February conference with Kissinger,
 a possible Kissinger follow-up trip through
 Latin America, and the meeting of the OAS
 General Assembly in Atlanta in April.
 III. Most of the larger, more important nations are
 primarily interested in bilateral relations with
 the US, and in some cases relations have, in fact,
 improved during the past year.
 A.   Chile's strongly antagonistic stance has changed
 under the military junta that overturned Allende.
 B.   The long controversy with Mexico over the salinity
 of the Colorado River was settled last summer.
 C.   Prospects for a new Canal treaty have toned
 down the anti-US rhetoric from Panama.
 D.   Serious problems remain to be solved, however,
 involving such matters as protection of US
 investments, territorial seas issues, including
 fishing rights, and narcotics enforcement.

 Chile
 IV. In Chile, the armed forces and police have been
 consolidating their hold since seizing power last
 September.  The government is dealing sternly with
 those who oppose it. Supporters of the late
 President Allende are reorganizing,  but resistance
 to the new government has been limited to sporadic
 acts of sabotage and scattered attacks on security
 forces.
 A.   There have been some signs of minor friction among the
 junta members, but junta President Pinochet appears
 firmly installed as "first among equals."
 B.   Personal conflicts and different opinions on
 how to reach vaguely defined goals have begun
 to surface at lower levels of the regime, but we
 do not expect to see serious rifts.
 C.   Considerable progress has been made toward
 restoring economic order and returning the
 country to a market economy.
 1. Several hundred private businesses are being
 returned to their owners.  Of the 45 US firms
 expropriated by Allende, 12 have been returned.
 The economic recovery program has been harshly
 austere and the burden is being borne primarily

 by the poor and the lower middle class.
 1.   Food prices have risen by 200 to 400 percent
 since the coup.
 E. The government recognizes that resentment of its
 economic policies could build to the point of
 precipitating worker protests.
 1.   Wage increases of 60 percent effective this
 month will bring some relief, even though
 they fall far short of the rise in living costs.
 Mexico
 V.   In Mexico President Echeverria is now at mid-point in
 his six-year term.   During the past several months he
 had to face bitter criticism from the business
 community, and an upsurge in urban guerrilla
 violence.   Both have subsided in recent weeks.
 A.   It is clear, however, that the important and
 influential business sector is still discon-
 tented,                                     and suspicious of Echeverria because
 of increasing terrorism and some government
 policies considered inimical to business
 interests.
 B. More kidnappings,  killings,  and other acts
 of violence by guerrilla groups are likely
 and they will continue to cause embarrassment

 to the Mexican government.
 C.  There are still enormous problems of poverty
 and uneven development, aggravated by rapid
 population growth.   Any substantial reduction
 of poverty will take decades, perhaps generations.
 D.  Of more immediate concern is increasing inflation.
 The cost of living in Mexico City rose 21 percent
 during the first 10 months of 1973.  A campaign
 to do something about this began in September,
 but has made little progress.
 E.  Good relations with the United States are
 still of paramount importance.   Close to 70
 percent of Mexico's exports go to the United
 States, and this dependence is likely to
 continue despite efforts to diversify the
 export market.
 1.   Recent foreign investment laws potentially
 expand government control over foreign
 business.   Echeverria gives every indica-
 tion,  however,  that enforcement will be
 moderate and that foreign investment will
 be welcome as long as it is channeled into
 areas where development is most needed.

 "s      Panama
 VI.   Panama's General Torrijos is pleased over progress
 being made toward solving his most pressing
 problem--the canal issue.   He considered Ambassador
 Bunker's designation as negotiator to be"a sign of
 US seriousness.
 A. He believes a new canal treaty would have broad
 benefits, beyond assuring him a high place in
 the list of national heroes.
 1.     Increased revenues from the canal would
 provide funds for domestic reform programs,
 and make it easier to service the foreign
 debt.
 B.    Ambassador Bunker's visits in November 1973 and
 this January produced an agreement on eight
 broad negotiating principles,  and signs that
 the Panamanians may moderate some of their
 previous demands when detailed negotiations
 begin.
 C.   The central Panamanian goal of early and full
 sovereignty over the canal is unlikely to
 change, however.   Torrijos' nationalism and
 his concern about signing a treaty which his
 critics could label a "sellout" are likely
 to remain the biggest obstacles.

 Argentina
 VII. In Argentina, Peron's return to power has by no
 means brought renewed stability.
 A.  Terrorism, particularly as directed at foreign
 businessmen, impedes efforts to revive the economy.
 B.  Deep rifts in Peron's own disparate movement show
 no signs of healing.
 C.  Above all, there is uncertainty over how long his
 health will permit him to lead the country.  Now
 78, he was seriously ill in November, and has a
 number of chronic ailments.
 Brazil
 VIII. In Brazil, the military leaders are maintaining a
 stable security situation and the country's economy
 continues to grow.
 A. Urban terrorists have been routed, and potential
 political opponents are generally apathetic.
 B.   The economy has been growing by about 10 percent
 a year, and inflation kept down to about 15 percent--
 low for Brazil and for much of Latin America.
 C.    President Medici will be succeeded in office by
 General Geisel on March 15, but we anticipate no
 significant policy changes.

 Peru
 IX.       With Allende gone from Chile, Peru's military govern-
 ment is the most radical in South America.
 A.    Under Moscow's first arms agreement in the
 hemisphere (except for Cuba), Peru received some
 Soviet medium tanks last November.
 1.  The Peruvians are interested in getting other
 military equipment from Moscow, but President
 Velasco apparently wants to keep open the
 Washington option.
 B.    Contention could grow over the succession to
 Velasco, who was seriously ill last year.
 1.  The more radical officers are apprehensive over
 the rise of the moderate former finance minister
 General Morales Bermudez, who is designated
 to become prime minister at the end of this year.
