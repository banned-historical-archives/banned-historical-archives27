 'AMERICAN' ARMED .
 INTERVENTION
 IN KOREA
 STATEMENT BY A. A. GROMYKO
 A. A. Gromyko, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R.,
 issued the following statement on American armed intervention in
 Korea on July 4:
 THE events now taking place in Korea broke out on June 25
 as the result of a provocative attack by the troops of the South
 Korean authorities on the frontier areas of the Korean People's
 Democratic Republic.                   This attack was the outcome of a
 premeditated plan.
 From time to time Syngman Rhee and other representatives
 of the South Korean authorities had blurted out the fact that the
 South Korean Syngman Rhee clique had such a plan.
 As long ago as October 7, 1949, Syngman Rhee, boasting of
 success in training his army, stated outright, in an interview given
 to an American United Press correspondent, that the South
 Korean Army could capture Phyeng-yang in the course of three
 days.
 On October 31, 1949,  in Sell Mo, Defence Minister of the
 Syngman Rhee Government, also told newspaper correspondents
 that the South Korean troops were strong enough to act and
 take Phyeng-yang within a few clays.  Only one week before the
 provocative attack of the South Korean troops on the frontier
 areas of the Korean People's Democratic Republic, Syngman
 Rhee said, in a speech on June 19 in the so-called "National
 Assembly" where Mr. Dulles, adviser to the U.S. State Depart-
 ment, was present: "If we cannot protect democracy in the cold
 war, we shall win in a hot war."
 It is not difficult to understand that representatives of the
 South Korean authorities could only make such statefnents be-
 cause they felt that they had American support behind them.

 19, 1950, Mr. Johnson, chief American administrator of aid to
 Korea, told the American Congress House of Representatives

 goes to show that the United States Government is
 more and more into war, but, com-
 pelled to._reckon rvlth the unwillingness of the American people
 to be involved&,__  w military adventure, it is gradually impel-
 ling the country step by step towards open war.
 The United States Government tries to justify armed inter-
 vention against Korea by alleging that it was undertaken on the
 authorisation of the Security Council.  The falsity of such an
 allegation strikes the eye.
 What really happened?  It is known that the United States
 Government had started armed intervention in Korea before
 the Security Council was summoned to meet on June 27, with-
 out taking into consideration what decision the Security Council
 might take.  Thus the United States Government confronted the
 United Nations Organisation with a fait accompli, with a viola-
 tion of peace.
 The Security Council merely rubber-stamped and back-dated
 the resolution proposed by the United  States Government,
 approving the aggressive actions which this Government had
 undertaken.  Furthermore, the American resolution was adopted
 by the Security Council with a gross violation of the Charter
 of the United Nations Organisation.
 In accordance with Article 27 of the United Nations Charter,
 all Security Council decisions on major issues must be adopted
 by an affirmative vote of not less than seven members, including
 the votes of all the live permanent members of the Security
 Council, i.e., of the Soviet Union, China., the United States, Great
 iritain and France.
 However, the American resolution approving the United States
 armed intervention in Korea was adopted by only six votes-
 those of the United States, Britain, France, Norway, Cuba and
 Ecuador.  The vote of the Kuomintangite Tsiang Ting-fu, who
 unlawfully occupies China's seat on the Security Council, was
 counted as the seventh vote for this resolution.
 Furthermore, of the five permanent members of the Council
 only three-the United States, Britain and France--were present
 at the Security Council's meeting on June 27. Two other perma
 nent members of the Security Council--the U.S.S.R. and China
 --were not present at the Council meeting, since the hostile atti-
 tude of the United States Government towards the Chinese
 people deprives China of the opportunity of having her legitimate
 representative on the Security Council, and this made impossible
 the Soviet Union's participation in the meetings of the Security
 Council.

 It is also known that the United Nati P(?e*r*"envisages
 the intervention of the Security Council only in those cases where
 the matter concerns events of an international order and not of
 an internal character.        Moreover, the Charter directly forbids.
 the intervention, of the United Nations Organisation in the inter
 nal affairs of any State when it is a matter of an internal conlhct
 between two groups of one State.  Thus the Security Council
 its decision of June 27 violated also this most important principIh
 of the United Nations Organisation.
 It follows from the aforesaid that this resolution, which t1ie
 U.S. Government is using as a cover for its armed intervention
 in Korea, was illegally put through the Security Council with r
 gross violation of the Charter of the United Nations Organisa
 lion  This only became possible because the grass pressure of
 the United States Government on the members of the Security
 Council converted r-he United Nations Organisation into a kind
 of branch of the U.S. State Department, into an obedient tool
 of the policy of American ruling circles who acted as violaitrrr,,
 of peace.
 The illegal resolution of June 27, adopted by the Securrr,,
 ('ouncil under prcisure trom the United States Governmenr
 shows that the Security Council is acting, not as a body which
 is charged with the main responsibility for the maintenance ol
 peace, but as a tocl utilii,ed by the ruling circles of the Unircj
 States for unleashing war.  This resolution of the Security
 Council constitutes a hostile act against peace.
 It' the Security Council valued the cause of peace, it should
 have attempted to .cconcile the fighting sides in Korea before
 it adopted such a scandalous resolution.  Only the Securilr
 Council and the United Nations Secretary-General could h.ase
 done this.  However., they did not mtrke such an attempt, c' i
 dently  knowing.  that  su::h  peaceful  action  contradicts   ihr
 aggressor's plans.
 It is impossible not. to note the unseemly role played in th,
 whole affair by the United    Nations Secretary-General,      M
 l'rygve Lie.  Being under the obligation, by virtue of his p "
 lion, to observe the exact fulfilment of the United Nations
 Charter, the Secretary-General, during discussion of the Korean

 pkoblem in the ? ecurity ,Council, -far from fulfilling his direct
 ,duties, on the contrary obsequiously helped -a gross 'violation
 -el' the Charter to be committed by the Government of the United
 States and other Security Council members.
 There-by the Secretary-General showed that he is concerned,
 not so much with strengthening the United Nations Organisa-
 tion and with promoting peace, as with how to help the United
 States ruling circles to carry out their aggressive plans with
 regard to Korea.
 , At a press conference on June 29, President Truman denied
 that the United States, having launched hostilities in Korea, was
 in a state of war.  He announced that this was only "police
 action" in support of the United Nations Organisation and
 alleged. that this action was aimed against a "group of bandits"
 from North Korea.
 It is not difficult to understand the untenability of such an
 allegation.
 It has long been known that, in undertaking aggressive actions,
 an aggressor usually resorts to this or that method of camou-
 flaging his actions.
 Everyone remembers that when, in the summer of 1937, mili-
 tarist Japan started armed intervention in North China with the
 campaign on Peking ,it announced that this was solely a local
 "incident" for the sake of maintaining peace in the East, although
 no one believed this.  The military operation which General
 MacArthur has now undertaken in Korea upon the instructions
 of the United States Government can be regarded as "police
 action" in support of the United Nations Organisation to just
 the same extent as the war started by the Japanese militarists
 against China in 1937 could be regarded as a local "incident"
 for maintaining peace in the East.
 As is known, the operations of the United States armed forces
 in Korea are commanded, not by some police officer, but by
 General MacArthur. However, it would be absurd to admit that
 the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces in
 Japan, General MacArthur, is directing, not military operations,
 but some sort of "police action" in Korea.  Who will believe
 that MiacArthur's armed forces, including military aviation, down
 to Flying Fortresses and jet planes, which attack the civilian
 population and the peaceful cities of Korea, the navy, including
 cruisers and aircraft carriers, as well as ground forces, were
 needed for a "police action" against a "group of bandits"?
 This is something that even quite naive persons will hardly
 believe.

 when t e Peoples?Liberation Army of China was fighting against  -
 Chiang Kai-shek's armies, which were equipped with America
 certain people also called it "groups of
 Lry technique
 mili t?
 ,
 ,
 bandits."  What the reality turned out to be, however, is some-
 "groups of bandits" not only expressed the fundamental national
 interests of China, but also constituted the Chinese people. Those
 whom the ruling circles of the United States thrust upon China
 as a Government turned out to be in reality a handful of bank-
 ruptadventurers and bandits who traded the national honour and
 independence of China right and left.
 What are the real aims of American armed intervention in
 Korea?
 Eyidently, the point is that the aggressive circles of the United
 States violated peace in order to lay hands, not only on the South,
 but also on North Korea. The invasion of Korea by American
 armed' forces constitutes open war against the Korean people.
 d
 t
 o pre-
 ence,
 Its goal is to deprive Korea of her national indepen
 vent the formation of a united democratic Korean State and
 forcibly to 'establish in Korea an anti-popular regime which would
 allow the ruling circles of the United States to convert the
 coinitiy'into their colony and use Korean territory as a military
 ,and. strategic springboard in the Far East.  In ordering the
 United States armed forces to attack Korea, President Truman
 at the same time stated that he had ordered the American Navy
 "to prevent any attack on Formosa," which means the occupation
 by American armed forces of this part of China's territory.
 This move of the United States Government constitutes out-
 right aggression against China.
 This move of the United States Government furthermore con-

 Agreements concerning Formosa being Chinese territory, agree-
 merits which bear the signature of the United States Government
 too, and is also a violation of the statement made by President
 Truman on January 5 of this year to the effect that the Americans
 would not intervene in the affairs of Formosa.
 President Truman also stated that he had instructed American
 armed forces to be increased in the Philippines, which aims at
 intervention in the domestic affairs of the Philippine State and
 at kindling an internal. struggle.  This act of the American
 Government shows that it continues to regard the Philippines as
 its colony and not as an independent State, which, furthermore,
 is a member of the United Nations Organisation.
 President Truman stated in addition that he had issued- an
 instruction that so-called "military assistance" to France in Indo-

 Thus .,president Truman's statement of ~June 27 means that

 There is no small number of historical examples of cases
 where, by means of intervention from without, the attempt was
 l
 made to throttle the struggle waged by the peoples for nationa
 unity and for 'democratic rights.
 In this connection one could recall. the war between the
 Northern and Southern States of North America in the 'sixties
 of the fast century.  At that time the Northern States, headed
 by Abraham Lincoln, waged an armed struggle against the slave-
 owners of the South for the abolition of slavery and for the
 preservation of the national unity of the country'  When
 attacked by the South, the armed forces of the Northern States
 did not, as is known, limit themselves to defence of their own
 territory, but transfered military operations to the territory of
 the Southern States, routed the troops of the planters and slave-
 owners who did not enjoy the support of the people, smashed
 the slave-owning system existing in the South and created the
 conditions for establishing national unity.
 It is known that at that time certain Governments, as for
 instance the British Government, also intervened in the internal
 affairs of North America in favour of the South against the
 North and against national unity.  Despite this, victory was won
 by the American people as personified by those progressive forces
 which headed the struggle of the North against the South.
 t 'will, not be amiss to recall also another lesson of history.
 the reactionary Tsarist - generals, _ having dug themselves in on
 the outs`irts of Russia, rent Russia asunder, the Government
 of the United States, together with the. Government of Britain,
 France and certain other States, intervened in the domestic
 affairs of the Soviet country and came out on the side of the

 reactionary Tsarist generals in order to preve   the unification
 of cur Motherland under the aegis of" the Soviet Government.
 The United States Government also did not shrink from armed
 intervention, sending its troops to the Soviet Far East and to the
 Archangel area.  Together with the troops of certain. other
 countries, the American troops actively helped the Russian
 Tsarist generals-Kolchak, Denikin, Yudenich and others-in
 their struggle against the Soviet power, shot Russian workers and
 peasants and plundered the population.
 As we see, in this case, too, the ruling circles of certain foreign
 States, violating peace, tried by armed intervention to turn back
 the wheel of history, tried forcibly to impose on the people the
 much-hated regime they had overthrown and tried to prevent the
 unification of our country into a single State.
 It is universally known how this interventionist adventure
 ended.
 It is useful to recall these historical examples because the
 events now taking place in Korea and certain other countries of
 Asia, and the aggressive policy of the United States as regards
 these countries, are in many respects reminiscent of the above-
 mentioned events from the history of the United States and
 Russia.
 The Soviet Government has already expressed its attitude
 towards the policy which is being pursued by the United States
 Government, a policy of gross intervention in the domestic affairs
 of Korea, in its reply of June 29 to the statement of the United
 States Government, dated June 27.
 The Soviet Government invariably adheres to a policy of
 strengthening peace the world over and to its traditional principle
 of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States.
 The Soviet Government holds that the Koreans have the same
 right to arrange at their own discretion their internal national
 affairs in the sphere of uniting South and North Korea into a
 single national State as the North Americans had in the 'sixties
 of the last century when they united the South and the North of
 America into a single national State.
 From all the aforesaid it follows that the Government of the
 United States of America has committed a hostile act against
 peace and that it bears the responsibility for the consequences of
 the armed aggression it has undertaken.
 The United Nations Organisation will fulfil its duties of main-
 taining peace only in the event that the Security Council demands
 the unconditional cessation of American military intervention
 and the immediate withdrawal of American armed forces from
 Korea.

 SOVIET GOVERNMtNT'S REPLY TO
 UNITED STATES
 r On June 27, Mr. A. Kirk, United States Ambassador, forwarded
 an 'alde-memoire to A. A. Grornyko, Deputy Minister of Foreign
 Affairs of the U.S.S.R., containing a statement of the U.S. Govern-
 ment of the following content:
 Government has instructed me to call your attention to
 the fact. that North Korean forces have crossed the 38th
 parallel and invaded the territory of the Republic of Korea in
 force at several points.  The refusal of the Soviet representa-
 tive to, attend the United Nations Security Council meeting on
 June 25, despite the clear threat to peace and the obligations of
 a member of the Security Council under the Charter, requires
 the Government of the United States to bring this matter directly
 to the attention of the Government of the Union of Soviet
 Socialist Republics. In view of the universally known fact of the
 close relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
 and the North Korean regime, the United States Government
 asks an assurance that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
 disavows responsibility for this unprovoked and unwarranted
 attack, and that it will use its influence with the North Korean
 authorities to withdraw their invading forces immediately.
 On the instructions of the Soviet Government, on June 29 A. A.
 Gromyko stated to Mr. A. Kirk the following:
 IN connection with the statement of the Government of the
 United States of America forwarded by you on June 27, the
 Soviet Government has instructed me to state the following:
 1.  According to reliable data of the Soviet Government, the
 events taking place in Korea were provoked by the attack of
 troops of the South Korean authorities on the North Korean
 border regions.  Therefore responsibility for these events rests
 with the South Korean authorities and with those who stand
 behind their backs.
 2.  As is known, the Soviet Government withdrew its troops
 from Korea earlier than this was done by the Government of
 the United States of America and thereby confirmed its tradi-
 tional principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of
 other States.  The Soviet Government continues to adhere to
 the principle of the impermissibility of interference of foreign
 Powers in the internal affairs of Korea.

 SOVIET GOVERNMENT'S, REPLY TO
 MR. TRYGVE LYE
 The following is the text of the communication from Mr. Trygve
 Lie, Secretary General of the United Nations, addressed to the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R.:
 I HAVE the honour' to inform you of the following text of a
 resolution adopted by the Security Council at its 474th meeting,
 June 27, 1950:
 "The Security Council, having decided that the armed attack
 on the Korean Republic by troops from Northern Korea con-
 stitutes a violation of peace; having called for the immediate
 cessation of military operations; having called on the North
 Korean authorities immediately to withdraw their .armed forces
 to the 38th Parallel; having noted from the report of the Korean
 Commission of the. United Nations Organisation that the North
 ,Korean authorities have not ceased military operations .and have
 not withdrawn their armed forces to the 38th Parallel, and that
 urgent military measures are required for the restoration of
 international peace and security; noting the appeal of the
 Korean Republic to the United Nations Organisation for imme-
 diate and effective steps to safeguard peace and security;
 `'Recommends that the members of the United Nations organ-
 isation give the Korean Republic such aid as may be necessary
 to repulse the armed attack and restore international peace and
 security in this area."
 The following is the text of the Soviet Government's reply of lime

 T? the Secretary General of the United Nations Organisation,
 Mfr. Trygve Lie, in New York.
 The Soviet Government has received from you the text `of the
 Security Council's resolution of June 27 calling on United

 The Soviet Government states_tliat this resolution was adopted
 by six votes with the participation of a seventh, the Kuomin-
 tangite Tsiang Ting-fu, who has no lawful right to represent
 China.   But,  in  accordance with  the  Charter  of  the
 United Nations, to adopt decisions the Security Council needs
 seven votes, including the five Permanent Council Members,
 namely-the U.S.A., Great Britain, France, the' U.S.S.R. and
 China.
 It is also known that when the said decision was taken, two
 Permanent Members. of the Security Council, the U.S.S.R. and
 China, were absent.  But, in accordance with the United
 Nations Charter, the Security Council can take a decision on
 important issues only if unanimity is expressed by all five Per-
 maneiit Council Members namely-the U.S.A., Great Britain,
 Prance, the U.S.S.R. and t `hina.
 In view of the above. stated, it is quite plain' that the said
 decision of the Security Council on the Korean problem has

 AMERICAN RULING CIRCLES HAVE
 GONE, OVER TO DIRECT ACTS OF
 AGGRESSION
 Editorial Comment in " Pravda," June 28
 ON June 27 President Truman of the United States of America
 issued a special statement on the events in Korea.
 The events in Korea, which have occupied the centre of atten-
 tion of world public opinion, reveal with all clarity that the
 imperialist warmongers will not stop half way in pursuit of their
 objects.  As is known, on June 25, the provocative actions of
 troops of the puppet Government of South Korea, directed
 against the Korean People's Democratic Republic, unleashed
 military operations on the territory of Korea. In reply to this,
 Security Detachments and troops of the Korean People's Repub-
 lic undertook active measures and, carrying out their Govern-
 at',; orders, went over to the counter-offensive, transferring
 fniltary operations to the territory south of the 38th parallel.
 tt Government of the Korean People's Democratic Republic
 has tb~een aide repeatedly- to demon%trate its consistency in defence
 of the interests of the Korean people, their democratic develop-
 ment, their independence, their patriotic aspirations for unity.

 Assembly' of Korea in Phyeng-yang, expressing the will of the
 Korean people, came forward with a proposal to carry out the
 peaceful unification of the country.
 The South Korean clique of Syngman Rhee answered this
 proposal on June 25 by beginning internecine, fratricidal war.
 The Syngman Rhee clique has taken the path of military
 adventure.  It relied in advance on military aid from its over-
 seas masters.
 The aggressive plans of its protectors are now beginning to be
 disclosed.
 As is clear from the afore-mentioned statement by Truman,
 he has instructed the air and naval forces of the United States
 to give armed "support" to the army of Syngman Rhee, the
 traitor of the Korean people.  At the same time the American
 President has instructed the American Seventh Fleet to "prevent
 any attach on Formosa," which is an order for the actual occupa-
 tion. by American awned forces of part of the territory of China.
 This order signifies that the Government of the United States of
 America has undertaken a direct act of aggression against the
 Korean People's Democratic Republic and against the People's
 Republic of China.
 Truman's statement and actions, unprecedented in international
 relations of the post-war period, constitute further evidence that
 the American ruling circles no longer confine themselves to the
 preparation of aggression, but have gone over to direct acts of
 aggression. But have they gone too far? The American Govern-
 ment, with its characteristic unceremoniousness as regards inter-
 national law, is grossly trampling on the United Nations Charter,
 acting as though the United Nations Organisation did not exist
 at all.
 The question arises, who authorised the American Government
 to take this step? In bringing its armed forces into action, did
 the United States Government reach agreement on its policy
 with the United Nations Organisation, about their loyalty to
 which Truman and Acheson are so vociferous? Where and when
 did the Security Council take a decision giving the United States
 Government a free hand in the acts of direct aggression under-
 taken by it?
 As is known, neither the United Nations Organisation nor
 any other international body has authorised the Government
 of the United States of America to undertake those actions with
 regard to Korea and China which Truman announced yesterday.
 In undertaking its openly aggressive act the American Govern-
 ment evidently set itself the aim of confronting the United
 Nations Organisation with a "fait accompli."

 BROADCAST BT KIM IR SEN
 On the morning of June 26, Kim Ir Sen, Chairman of the Cabinet
 of Ministers of the Korean People's Democratic Republic, made the
 following statement over the radio to the people:
 DEAR countrymen! Dear brothers and sisters, men of our
 People's Army and partisans operating in the Southern part
 of our Republic! On behalf of the the Government of the
 Korean People's Democratic Republic I address you.  On June
 25, the army of the puppet government of the traitor Syngman
 Rhee began an offensive against the territory North of the 38th
 Parallel.  In fierce battles, the border guards, fighting courage-
 ously, parried the blow and stopped the offensive of the troops
 of the Syngman Rhee puppet army. Having discussed the situa-
 tion, the Government of the Korean People's Democratic Re-
 public gave an order to our People's Army to begin a resolute
 counter-offensive and to rout the armed forces of the enemy.
 Carrying out the order of the Government of the Korean People's
 Democratic Republic, the People's Army threw back the enemy
 from the territory to the North of the 38th Parallel and advanced
 10-15 kilometres to the South, liberating the towns of Ongjin,
 Enan, Kaiseng, Piakchen and a number of other towns and
 populated centres.
 The treacherous Syngman Rhee clique unleashed the anti-
 popular internecine war despite the fact that the patriotic demo-
 cratic forces of our country fought for the unification of the
 country in a peaceful way.  The whole world knows that the
 Syngman Rhee clique which opposes the peaceful unification of
 the homeland has, .for a long time, prepared for fratricidal war.
 While the people of South Korea were starving, the puppet Syng-
 man Rhee Government spent a great part of its budget funds,
 forcibly extracted from the population by unbearable taxes, for
 armament and preparations for fratricidal war. Striving to un-
 leash internecine war the reactionary Syngman Rhee clique
 hastened to prepare its rear for this.  It established a reaction-
 ary police rdgime in South Korea.  To justify the preparations
 for internecine war, the Syngman Rhee clique constantly pro-
 voked military clashes along the 38th Parallel, creating an at-
 mosphere of disquiet in the country and seeking to place the
 responsibility for these provocations on the authorities of the
 Korean People's Democratic Republic.  In the course of the
 preparations for the "march to the North", the traitors, acting
 on the orders of the American imperialists, were not ashamed
 to enter into a conspiracy with the hateful enemies of the Korean
 people-the Japanese militarists.

 Kim Jr Sen then dwelt on the extremely  t  a    c
 situation of South-Korea into which it was plunged by the anti-  -
 popular Syngman Rhee clique.
 Dear countrymen, the Government of the Korean People's
 Democratic Republic, together with all patriotic democratic
 ;parties and public organisations, together with the people of
 the whole of Korea, made every effort to avoid the calamity of
 fratricidal war and to unite our country in a peaceful way, with-
 out bloodshed.  As far back as April 1948, the joint meeting
 of the representatives of parties and public organisations of
 North and South Korea made the first attempt to ensure the
 peaceful unification of the country.. However, this attempt was
 frustrated by the Syngman Rhee clique who, in May 1948, by
 carrying out, with the help of the American imperialists and
 their instrument-the U.N.O. Commission for Korea-separate,
 falsified elections in South Korea, intensified preparations for
 an armed attack on the Northern part of the country.
 11 To achieve the peaceful unification and full independence of
 the country, seventy-one patriotic parties and public organisa-
 tions rallied in the United Democratic Fatherland Front of
 Korea and, in June last year, advanced a proposal concerning
 the peaceful unification of the country by holding a general
 election.  This proposal was warmly supported by the entire
 Kot!ean people.  However, the realisation of this proposal was
 again frustrated by the perfidious Syngman Rhee clique.
 Expressing the opinion of the people striving for a peaceful
 unification of the country, the United Democratic Fatherland
 Front, on June 7, 1950, advanced a proposal to effect the unifi-
 cation of the country in a peaceful way. However, the treacher-
 ous Syngman Rhee clique prevented the realisation of this pro-
 posal by the United Democratic Fatherland Front also, declaring
 that it would regard as traitors all those who participated in
 n ensures aimed at carrying out the proposal concerning peaceful
 unification.
 Taking into account the firm will of the Korean people for
 unification, independence and democratic development of the
 country and also taking into consideration the desire of demo-
 cratic political parties and organisations, the Presidium of the
 Supreme People's Assembly of Korea proposed on June 19 to
 effect the peaceful unification of the country by uniting the
 Supreme People's Assembly of the Korean People's Democratic
 Republic and the so-called National Assembly of South Korea
 into a single legislative organ for the whole of Korea. But the
 Syngman Rhee clique, to whom the interests of the Korean
 people are alien, replied to the proposal for the peaceful unifica-

 3 n of the. country, for which the entire people are war ing,
 starting a fratricidal war:  By means of fratricidal war, the
 Syngman Rhee clique is seeking to establish in the Northern part
 of the Republic, the reactionary anti-popular regime which
 existed under the Japanese and which exists at present in the
 Southern part of the Republic; to liquidate the Korean People's
 Democratic Republic and take away from our people the suc-
 cesses achieved by them in the matter of democratic transforma-
 tions. The Syngman Rhee reaction seeks to take away from the
 peasants the land received by them free of charge in the Northern
 part of the republic as a result of land reform, and to give it
 back to the landlords.  The treacherous clique seeks to abolish
 all deal, cratic liberties and rights gained by the Korean people
 in the Northern part of the Republic. The treacherous Syngman
 Rhee clique wants to turn the whole of the country into a colony
 of the American imperialists, and the Korean people into slaves.
 Dear brothers and sisters!  A great danger hangs over our
 homeland and the people. What is needed in order to end this
 danger?  In this war waged against the Syngman Rhee clique,
 the Korean people must defend the Korean People's Democratic
 Republic and its Constitution, liquidate the anti-popular fascist
 puppet Syngman Rhee power established in the Southern part of
 the Republic, liberate the Southern part of our country from the
 domination of the Syngman Rhee clique, and restore there,
 people's committees- real organs of power.  We must, under
 the banner of the Korean People's Democratic Republic, com-
 plete the unification of the country and form a united indepen-
 dent democratic state. The war which we have been compelled
 to wage is a just war for the unification and independence of
 the homeland, for freedom and democracy.
 Kim Ir Sen then called upon the People's Army and the
 border guard detatchments boldly to defend the gains of demo-
 cracy.
 Our People's Army is reared in the spirit of respect for the
 people and the country. It is equipped with modern technique
 and is fighting for the interests of the people and of homeland.
 Further, Kim Ir Sen called upon the people in the Northern
 part cif the Republic to switch all work to a military basis, to
 mobilise all forces for a merciless and rapid destruction of the
 enemy.
 It is necessary to subordinate all work to war needs and the
 task of smashing the enemy, to organise all-out aid for the
 People's Army, secure constant reinforcements for its ranks,
 to supply the front with all necessary materials, to ensure speedy
 delivery to the army of armaments and munitions and to arrange
 for help on a wide scale to wounded soldiers.  It is necessary

 Kim Ir Sen called upon them to give active aid to the People's
 Army, to widen the common national struggle, to annihilate the r?
 enemy, to disrupt his communication lines and to restore the
 people's committees.
 Kim Ir Sen called upon the workers, peasants, owners of
 enterprises and the intelligentsia of South Korea actively to help
 in liberating South Korea.
 Addressing himself to the officers and men of the so-called
 army of national defence, Kim Ir Sen urged them to turn their
 guns against the enemies of the Korean people--the perfidious
 Syngman Rhee clique-and, by doing so, to take their place in

 Dear fellow citizens, the Government addresses itself to all
 the people of Korea with the call to rally still closer around

 KOREAN PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC
 REPUBLIC
 The following statement by Pak Hen Yen, Minister of Foreign
 Affairs of the Korean People's Democratic Republic, was broadcast
 from Phyeng-yang on the night of July 1:
 ON June 27 President Truman of the United States said that
 he had ordered air and naval forces of the United States to
 enter into hostilities in Korea on the side of the South Korean
 puppet rdgime which had unleashed internecine war in our coun-
 try at the bidding of the American imperialists.  On June 30
 Truman announced that American ground forces had been sent
 to South Korea.
 American planes are subjecting our peaceful population to
 piratical bombing, making raids on Phyeng-yang and other
 places in North Korea, as well as on liberated towns in South
 Korea, attacking units of the People's Army in order to prevent
 the victorious advance to the south.
 Thus the policy of enslaving the Korean people and turning
 Korea into a colony which has been pursued by the American
 imperialists has now assumed the form of open armed inter-11 vention against the Korean People's Democratic Republic.
 For a long time the American imperialists have dreamed. of
 establishing their domination over the Far East. Formerly, how-
 ever, they had to reckon with the imperialist interests of Britain
 and Japan and other Powers, and had to extend their positions
 in the Far East by deals with these Powers at the expense of
 the enslaved peoples of Asia.  Thus, the Korean people will
 never forget that in 1905, in order to strengthen its domination
 over the Philippines, the United States entered into a treacherous
 deal with Japan and assisted in the establishment of a Japanese
 protectorate over Korea.
 After the Second World War, which resulted in the rout of
 Japan and the weakening of Britain, the American imperialists
 decided to take their place in the countries of the Far East, seek-
 ing to turn the Pacific Ocean into an American sea and the people
 of the Pacific countries into the slaves of the American mono-
 polies.  However, the consolidation of the forces of the demo-
 cratic camp, the development of the national liberation move-
 ment in the countries of Asia and especially the great victory of
 the Chinese people smashed to smithereens the perfidious schemes
 of the American imperialists.
 The Korean people have experienced the whole burden of
 the colonising policy of the American imperialists.  Having rid

 with enslavement. , Seeking to keep South Korea, the American
 imperialists stubbornly prevented the unification of the Korean
 people. They thwarted the establishment of a single democratic
 Government of Korea on the basis of the Moscow decision of
 the Foreign Ministers of the U.S.S.R.., the United States and
 Britain. They refused to withdraw their troops from Korea until
 they had turned South Korea into their colony with the help of
 the puppet Syngman Rhee Government which they set up.
 Now it is clear to every Korean that even after the withdrawal
 of American troops South Korea was administered by the Ameri-
 can, imperialists.  It is they, together with the Syngman khee
 clique, who bear the full responsibility for the crimes of the
 military police regime they instituted in South Korea, for the
 shooting and murder of tens of thousands of sons of the Korean
 people destroyed by the Syngman Rhee clique on the orders of
 its American masters, for the torments of hundreds of thousands
 of patriots thrown into prisons and subjected to brutal tortures,
 for all the suffering of the people of South Korea.  The hands
 of the American imperialists are steeped in the blood of the
 Korean people.
 But they did not succeed in enslaving the Korean people. This
 was prevented first of all by the democratic system established
 in North Korea.  North Korea became a powerful base of the
 Korean people's struggle for unity, independence and freedom.
 Its successes in peaceful construction demonstrated the superiority
 of the democratic system over the anti-national military police
 regime of South Korea, inspired the Korean people to struggle
 against the attempts of the American imperialists to colonise
 Korea and instilled in the people confidence in final victory.
 This is the reason why the American imperialists and their
 South Korean lackeys, who have hated the Korean People's
 Democratic Republic for a long time, plotted to strangle it by
 means of war. They prevented the realisation of the proposals
 for the peaceful unification of Korea which were repeatedly
 put forward by the democratic parties and public organisations,
 as well as by the Government, of the Korean People's Demo-
 cratic? Republic.
 With the support of the United States, the Syngman Rhee
 "Government" for two years openly prepared the attack on the
 North, boasting that its army would capture Phyeng-yang and
 Wonsan in a day and that it only awaited the order to go into
 action.
 Having obtained a promise of military support from the
 United States, the Syngman Rhee "Government", on the orders
 of its American masters, unleashed internecine war in Korea on

 The United States is trying to cover up its intervention in

 to all that the American imperialists confronted the United
 with the "fait accompli" of armed intervention, calcu-

 lating that by means of the votes of countries dependent on
 the United States they would succeed in covering up with the
 name of the United Nations any unlawful action, even after
 such an action had been committed.
 The resolution dictated by the Americans to the Security
 Council is based on one-sided, falsified information, is invalid
 and is contrary to the United Nations Charter, since it was
 taken without the participation of the representatives of the
 Government of the Korean People's Democratic Republic, and
 also without the participation of the representatives of two great
 Powers which are permanent members of the Security Council
 -the U.S.S.R. and the Chinese People's Republic.
 The members of the Security Council who voted for this
 resolution once again showed that they were ready to sign any
 document dictated to them by the United States, without regard
 for the rights and interests of peoples.  In this connection one
 cannot but mention the fact that the pro-American majority in
 the United Nations, now displaying such feverish activity to save
 the bankrupt Syngman Rhee regime, ignored the repeated
 appeals to the United Nations made by the Government of the
 Korean People's Democratic Republic and by public organisa-
 tions of Korea regarding the atrocities and military provocations
 of the Syngman Rhee regime.
 It also ignored the repeated appeals of Korean public organisa-
 tions containing concrete proposals for the peaceful unification of
 Korea, thereby encouraging the adventurist measures of the
 United States and its South Korean stooges for fomenting inter-
 necine war in Korea.
 The American imperialists and their South Korean stooges who
 unleashed internecine war in Korea have gravely miscalculated.
 The Syngman-Rhee troops received a deserved rebuff and under
 the blows of the People's Army, which went over to the counter-
 offensive, are fieeeing southward in disorder.  The valiant
 People's Army, upholding the freedom and independence of the
 Korean people, continues to pursue the enemy.

 Republic and liberated Seoul, the capital of the Motherland.
 Everywhere the people are greeting their Army which has brought
 them. liberation from the horrors of the Syngman Rhee regime, and
 are rendering it active assistance in the liberation of the country.
 The heroic guerillas of South Korea have developed military
 operations on the enemy's lines of communication. They have
 cut the main railway line running from the Port of Pusan, and
 in co-operation with the population that has risen they have
 liberated a number of towns in South Korea.
 The flight of the Syngman Rhee Army and the people's
 activities in its rear provide fresh evidence of the decay and doom
 of the anti-national regime of the American puppets in South
 Korea. The full bankruptcy of the Syngman Rhee regime has
 now become obvious.  The American imperialists, seeing that
 their plans for colonising Korea are collapsing, are intensifying
 armed intervention against the Korean people.  They want to
 drown the freedom of Korea in the blood of its patriots. But
 they will not daunt the freedom-loving Korean people.
 In reply to the insolent aggression of the United States, the
 Korean people will rally still more closely under the banner of
 the_Korean People's Democratic Republic. They will intensify
 their sacred struggle for the freedom, unity and independence of
 the Motherland.
 The Government of the Korean People's Democratic Republic
 and the whole Korean people resolutely protest against the
 barbarous bombing of Korean towns and villages, against the in-
 human murder of peaceful inhabitants.  We are confident that
 all honest people of the world will indignantly condemn the
 aggression of the American imperialists against the freedom-
 loving Korean people. We are confident that our just cause will
 find fervent sympathy in the hearts of all peoples.
 MESSAGE OF KOREAN PEACE
 COMMITTEE
 On June 30 the Korean Peace Committee decided to send the
 following message to the Permanent Committee of the World
 Peace Congress:
 IN an endeavour to let loose a new war for the achievement
 of their aggressive aims and the conquest of world domina-
 tion, the American imperialists, through the hated enemies of
 the '.Korean people, the treachous Syngman Rhee clique, have
 unleashed civil war in Korea.  Already, before the publication

 imperialists had begun making barbarous air, raids on peaceful
 Korean towns and villages. This armed aggression and military
 intervention of the American imperialists shows that they have
 not only provoked civil war in our country, but have proceeded
 to active military operations against the Korean people in order
 to seize the whole territory of our country.  This fact proves
 also that the armed aggression of the American imperialists and
 the igniting of civil war by the treacherous Syngman Rhee clique
 was prepared a long time ago....
 American bombers have raided Kaiseng, Yoenpu, Chunchen
 and other liberated towns, mercilessly killing civilians-women,
 old men and children. On June 29, aircraft of the American
 imperialists made a raid on Phyeng-yang and other populated
 ted
 places situated north of the 38th Parallel.  By their aggressive
 actions in Korea the American imperialists have violated inter-
 national law and the U.N. Charter. In their endeavour to carry
 out their aggressive plans with regard to the Korean People's
 Democratic Republic, the American imperialists are hoping to
 restore their so-called "international prestige", which was under-
 mined by the victory of the great Chinese people.  .
 They are using the war in Korea for aggression against the
 Chinese People's Republic and the suppression of the national
 liberation movement in Viet Nam, the Philippines and other
 parts of South-East Asia, as well as in Japan. . . . The anger
 and hatred of the Korean people towards the American impe-
 rialists is very great. When they have destroyed the Syngman
 Rhee clique, the Korean people will very quickly end the civil
 warfare unleashed as a result of the intervention of the Ameri-
 can imperialists.
 The Korean people are fighting with all their might for a
 speedy cessation of civil warfare.  In response to the heroic
 offensive, the patriots of the Motherland have made an upris-
 ing in Tegu and Kvandiu and have launched partisan warfare
 and uprisings in many other towns and populated places in
 South Korea.
 In reporting the above-mentioned events to the Permanent
 Committee, the Korean Peace Committee asks the Permanent
 Committe to examine the question of American aggression in
 Korea and to adopt, in this connection, all measures the Com-
 mittee may deem expedient. The Korean Peace Committee is
 confident that the World Peace Congress, and all peace sup-
 porters throughout the world, will raise their voices in protest
 against the aggression of the warmongers in Korea, in defence
 of the Korean people who are fighting for the unity, freedom
 and independence of their Motherland.

 On Jung 28.Chou 'En-lai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese
 People's Republic, made the following statement:
 HAVING instigated the South Korean puppet Government of
 Syngman Rhee to provoke civil war in Korea, Mr. Truman,
 President of the United States, made a statement on June 27 that
 the U.S. Government had decided to obstruct by armed force our
 liberation of Formosa. On Truman's order the American Seventh
 Fleet moved to the Formosan coast.
 On behalf of the Central Government of the Chinese People's
 Republic I declare that Truman's statement of June 27 and
 the American Navy's actions constitute armed aggression against
 Chinese territory and total violation of the United Nations
 Charter.
 This violent predatory action of the U.S. Government comes as
 no surprise to the Chinese people but only increases their anger;
 because the Chinese people have, over a long period constantly
 exposed all the conspiratorial schemes of American imperialism
 directed towards aggression against: China and towards the
 forcible annexation of Asia. .
 All Truman's statement does is openly to expose his pre-
 meditated, plan and put it into practice.
 In fact, the attack of the puppet Korean Government of
 Syrigman Rlee on the Korean People's Democratic Republic,
 made on the bidding of the U.S. Government, was a premeditated
 move' of the U.S.A. designed to create a pretext for United States
 invasion of Formosa, Korea, Viet Nam, and the Philippines.
 It is precisely a further act of intervention of American im-
 perialism in Asian affairs.
 On behalf of the Central People's Government of the Chinese
 People's Republic I declare that, no matter what obstructive
 action the American imperialists may take, Formosa is part of
 China and will remain so, for ever.
 It is not only a historical fact; it has also been confirmed by
 the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations and conforms to the situa-
 tion, since the surrender of Japan. All the people of our country
 will certainly fight as one man for the complete liberation of
 Formosa from the grasp of the American aggressors.
 The Chinese people, who defeated Japanese imperialism and
 Chiang Kai-shek, the hireling of the American imperialists, will
 surely be victorious in driving off the American aggressors and
 recovering Formosa and all other territories. belonging to China

 Republic calls upon all supporters of peace, justice and freedom

 capable of burying the vicious and hated American imperialist
 warmongers once and for all in the course of the struggle for
 national independence.
 STATEMENT BY MAO TSE-TUNG
 Speaking at the meeting of the Central People's Government Council
 held on June 28, Mao Tse-tung, Chairman of the Central People's
 Government Council, made the following statement:
 THE Chinese people have already affirmed that 'the affairs of
 the different countries throughout the world should be run
 by the peoples of the respective countries themselves, and Asian
 affairs should be run by the Asian peoples themselves and in
 no way by the U.S.A.  The U.S. aggression in Asia will only
 arouse the extensive and resolute resistance of the Asian peoples.
 On January 5, 1950, President Truman stated that America
 would refrain from interference in Formosa. Now Truman has
 torn to shreds all international agreements regarding non-inter-
 ference by the U.S.A. in China's internal affairs.  This open
 exposure by the U.S.A. of its true imperialist face is beneficial
 to the Chinese people and to the peoples or Asia.
 There is no ground for American intervention in the internal
 affairs of Korea, the Philippines, Viet Nam and other countries.
 The sympathies of the people throughout China, and of the
 broad masses all over the world, will be on the side of the
 victims of aggression and certainly not on the side of American
 imperialism. They will neither be bought by American imperial-
 6tnnbr be duped by it.
 Imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly feeble, because
 it has no support among the people.
 People throughout China and the world l  Unite and prepare
 adequately to defeat any provocation of American imperialism!

 KOREA VIOLATES U.N. CHARTER
 Statement by International Association of Democratic
 Lawyers
 The International Association of Democratic Lawyers issued the
 following statement on July 1:
 ON June 25 the Security Council passed a resolution saying
 that the actions of the armed forces of North Korea constitute
 a breach of peace. This resolution was taken in violation of
 the United Nations' Charter. Paragraph 3 of Article 27 requires
 that such decisions of the Security Council should be made by
 the affirmative vote of seven members, including the con-
 curring votes of five permanent members.  But the representative
 of the Soviet Union-a permanent member of the Security
 Council-was not present at this meeting.
 On the other hand, Article 39 of the Charter, entitling the
 Security Council to determine the existence of a threat to peace
 or a breach of peace, refers to the existence of aggression on an
 international plane and not to an internal conflict between two
 opposing groups in one and the same country.  Such a conflict
 comes within the jurisdiction of the given country and therefore
 a resolution taken on the basis of Article 39 of the Charter cannot
 be justified. -
 Finally, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers notes
 that:
 In accordance with Articles 42 and 43 of the United Nations
 Charter, the Security Council alone can take the necessary action
 to maintain or restore peace. The United Nations' members may
 have recourse to armed intervention solely on the proposal of
 the Security Council or by agreement with it, but by no means
 of their own volition.

 NAVAL BLOCKADE OF THE KOREAN
 A COAST "A NEW ACT OF AGGRESSION"
 Soviet Reply to U.S. Note
 On July 4, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R. received
 from the United States Embassy - the following Note:
 THE Ambassador of the United States of America presents his
 compliments to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union
 of Soviet Socialist Republics, and, in accordance with instruc-
 tions, has the honour to inform the Minister that the President
 of the United States of America, in keeping with the United
 Nations Security Council's request for support to the Republic
 of Korea in repelling the North Korean invaders and restoring
 peace in Korea, has ordered a naval blockade of the Korean
 coast. This is effective immediately.
 On July 6 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R. forwarded
 to the United States Embassy a Note of the following content:
 T HE Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Social-
 ist Republics acknowledges receipt of the Embassy's Note
 of July 4 of this year, and on the instruction of the Soviet Govern-
 ment has the honour to state the following:
 In the Note mentioned, the Embassy announces that the Presi-
 dent of the United States of America has ordered a naval block-
 ade of the Korean coast, alluding to the Security Council's
 resolution on the Korean question.
 The Soviet Government, in its reply of June 29 to the message
 of the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Trygve Lie, has
 already stated that the resolution mentioned of the Security
 Council on the Korean question, adopted in violation of the
 United Nations Charter, has no legal force and consequently
 cannot serve as a legal basis for taking any measures whatsoever
 with regard to Korea, including a naval blockade of Korea.
 The blockade of Korea constitutes a new act of aggression.
 This blockade is just as incompatible with the United Nations'
 principles as is the entire armed intervention of the United States
 in Korea.
 Owing to the aforesaid, the Soviet Government will consider
 the Government of the United States of America responsible for
 all the consequences of this act and for all damage to the interests
 of the Soviet`Union which may be caused in connection with the
 carrying out of the above mentioned blockade.

 STATEMENT ON KOREA BY
 SECRETARIAT OF WORLD PEACE
 COMMITTEE
 THE Secretariat of the Permanent Committee of the World
 Peace Congress has published its answer to the appeal of the
 Korean Peace Committee. In its answer the Secretariat notes
 that::.
 1.  The Government of the U.S.A. is responsible for military
 -intervention in Korea by its land, naval and air forces;
 2.  The American Air Force is en
 a
 ed i
 g
 g
 n mass bombing of
 the Korean civilian population;                 .
 3.  in order to .justify this intervention the U.S. Government
 and other Governments have violated the United Nations Charter
 based on the rule of the unanimity of the five great Powers. This
 action seriously encroaches on the authority of the United
 Nations;
 4.  These Governments, in particular, have violated the prin-
 eiple of the United Nations Charter according to which the
 People's Government of Korea should have been heard before
 any decision was taken;
 5.  Moreover, the U.S. Government has decided to despatch
 its fleet to Taiwan (Formosa), to reinforce its troops in the Philip-
 pines and to send a military mission to Indo-China, i.e. to inter-
 vent also in the affairs of three other peoples of Asia.
 The Secretariat stresses the increasing threat of an extension
 of the conflict.  It exposes the criminal proposals on using the
 atom bomb and expresses its ardent sympathy and solidarity
 with the Korean people, which is achieving its national unifica-
 tion in the struggle against foreign intervention.
 The Secretariat demands the cessation of the military inter-
 vention of th@ U.S.A. in Korea so that the Korean peoples
 thenlseJyes may become masters of their own destiny and achieve
 unlf'tci}fiQn; freedom and independence.
 The ,Secretariat calls upon all supporters of peace throughout
 the world to intensify their activity in collecting signatures to the
 Stockholm Appeal which is increasingly becoming the chief
 means for achieving a decrease in international tension and for
 achieving peace.

 THE CHINESE PEOPLE ARE
 DETERMINED TO LIBERATE TAIWAN
 :. Chou En-Tai's Message to Trygve Lie
 CHOU EN-LAI, Foreign Minister of the Chinese People's Republic,
 has sent a message to Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the
 United Nations, for transmission to the members of the Security
 Council.  The message states:
 ON behalf of the Central People's Government of the Chinese
 People's Republic I declare that the resolution approved by
 the Security Council on June 27, through the instigation and
 manipulation of the American Government, which called on
 members of the United Nations to render aid to the South
 Korean authorities, was adopted with the aim of supporting
 American armed aggression and constitutes intervention in the
 internal affairs of Korea and also a violation of peace throughout
 the world.
 This resolution, having been adopted, moreover, in the absence
 of two permanent members of the Security Council, the People's
 Republic of China and the U.S.S.R., is obviously illegal. The
 United Nations Charter stipulates that the United Nations shall
 not be authorised to intervene in matters which are essentially
 within the internal jurisdiction of any State, whereas the resolu-
 tion of the Security Council on June 27 precisely violates this
 important principle of the United Nations Charter.  Therefore
 the resolution of the Security Council with regard to the Korean
 question is not only devoid of any validity, but does great harm
 to the United Nations Charter. The action by Mr. Trygve Lie,
 Secretary-General of the United Nations, on the Korean question
 still further increases this harm.
 Meanwhile the statement by the United States President Tru-
 man on June 27 on the prevention by force of arms of the libera-
 tion of Ta.iwan* by the Chinese People's Republic, together with
 the action of the United States Navy in invading Chinese terri-
 torial waters around Taiwan, constitutes an act of open aggres-
 sion which clearly violates the principle of the United Nations
 Charter forbidding any member to use force against the terri-
 torial integrity and political independence of any other State.
 Taiwan is an inseparable part of the territory of China. This
 is not only an historical fact recognised by the whole world, but
 is also confirmed by the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declara-
 tion and the situation since the surrender of Japan. By keeping
 silent on this act of open aggression by the United States Govern-
 *Taiwan (Formosa).

 steps taken by the United Stages Government, the Chinese people
 are filled with determination to liberate Taiwan without fail.
 APPEAL TO ALL THE KOREAN PEOPLE
 By Kim Ir Sen, f.ornrnander-in-Chief of Korean
 eople's Army
 Phyeng-yank radio has broadcast an appeal in  the Korean people
 made by Kim Ir Sen, Commander-in-Chief of the Korean People's
 .Army.  The appeal says:
 J)EAR. compatriots!                              Beloved brothers and sisters!  Glorious
 men and commanders of the People's Army!                                        Men and
 women guerillas operating in the South!       The American im-
 perialists have begun an armed attack against our country, on
 our people.  Their air force is barbarously bombing our towns
 and villages, killing the peaceful population.  Naval squadrons
 of the American imperialists, wh!ch illegally intruded into our
 territorial waters, are mercilessly firing on our coastal towns
 and villages. Units of American ground forces landed on
 territory still not liberated in the South of our country, and
 are trampling the soil of our Motherland under their blood-
 stained feet.
 Why did the American imperialists send their troops to our
 beloved land?  Why did they attack our sacred soil like
 brigands? Dreaming of world domination, the American im-
 perialists have done this in order to turn our Motherland into
 their colony for ever, and us, the people, into their slaves. Such
 is their object.
 For its achievement the. American imperialists in the South
 of our Motherland placed in power the rabid enemy of the
 Korean people, Syngman Rhee, and installed a puppet Govern-
 ment in Southern Korea.  For the achievement of their object
 the American imperialists, by means of terror, murders, threats
 and deception, prevented and thwarted the peaceful unification
 of our Motherland.  They egged on their agent Syngman Rhee
 to the kindling of civil war and brutally attacked its with their
 armed forces.
 The American imperialists have r.o regard for the real rights
 of the Korean people, the freedom and independence of our

 and    hey  o not consider Koreans to  a poop e.     e
 American brigands think that the Korean people have no other
 fate than to be colonial slaves, in order to fill still more the
 blood-stained pockets of the Wall Street traders.
 The American. imperialist invaders are turning our peaceful
 towns and villages into their military bases and places d'armes
 for practical military operations, and our children, women and
 old folk into targets for aerial gunfire and bombing.
 North of the 38th Parallel, the towns of Phyeng-yang, Chin-
 nampo and others, as well as suburban villages, have repeatedly
 been subjected to bombing.  South of the 38th Parallel, the
 already liberated town of Seoul and numerous other towns
 and villages are being subjected to fierce bombing by American
 military planes.
 The murderers are machine-gunning women who are work-
 ing diligently in the paddy-fields and are dropping bombs on
 the heads of children and adolescents.   The American im-
 perialist invaders, barbarously murdering the population, are
 employing the methods of the hiders and their fascists and
 the brigand Japanese imperialists.
 The American imperialists attempt to cloak their barbarous
 armed agression in Korea by the decision of the Security
 Council on the so-called Korean question.  The so-called
 decision of the Security Council was adopted in violation of
 the United Nations Charter, without the participation of repre-
 sentatives of Korea, and also without the participation of repre-
 sentatives of the Soviet Union and China.
 The object of the American imperialist armed attack on
 Korea is clear to people throughout the world. No one will be
 deceived by the statement of the American imperialists that
 American troops, in the name of the United Nations organisa-
 tion, are carrying out  "police"  functions  in Korea.  The
 American imperialist invaders, under the flag of the United
 Nations Organisation, are carrying out raids against our towns
 and villages; they are making war in order to kill our people
 who desire freedom, unity and independence.
 In dropping their bombs on the heads of the Koreans the
 American imperialists also say that they do this in the name
 of "peace".  But they will deceive no one by this.   These
 aggressive methods have already been widely employed by the
 fore-runners of American imperialism - the Hitlerite fascists,
 and the Japanese imperialists.  As the entire world knows,
 Hitler said, "When I speak of peace I think of war."
 The Japanese imperialists cloaked their aggression with false
 declarations about "peace in Asia".  On August 29, 1910, the

 annexing Korea in order to establish enduring peace in tb,e
 East, explaining the annexation by alleging that Korea was
 supposed to be a threat to peace in the East.
 Today the American imperialists who are attempting to take
 away the independence of our Motherland for the purpose of
 turning it into their colony, like the Hitlerite fascists and the
 Japanese imperialists, shamelessly endeavour to cloak their
 armed intervention in the internal affairs of our Motherland
 and their barbarous bombing of our peaceful cities by declara-
 tions about peace.
 The armed attack by the American imperialists on Korea is a
 wicked violation of international law and' the United Nations
 Charter.
 Although the American imperialists have perpetrated an
 armed attack against us, they cannot smash the fighting spirit
 of the Korean people, who are devoted to the freedom and in-
 dependence of people, Motherland.  The entire Korean people,
 roused to the common war fortl~.e honour, freedom and itrde-
 pendence of their Motherland, will fight to"the death against the
 aggression of American imperialism, and will achieve victory.
 Our People's Army, fighting for the liberation of the Mother-
 land, despite its youth and inexperience, it displaying courage,
 devotion and heroism and has already achieved considerable
 successes.
 The troops of our army are fig~ting not. for dollars and not
 in order to subjugate other peoples, as the American hired mur-
 derers are doing, but in order to defend their Motherland, to
 defend the freedom and indepen 5ence of their people.  Our
 fighters are imbued with the spirit of  atriotism, heroism and,
 courage.  The troops of the American aggressors are fighting on
 foreign territory. -Our People's Army, enjoying the love, concern
 and support of all the people, is fighting a  the territory of its
 Motherland.
 The army of the American aggressors isj hated by the whole
 of our people.  At each step vengeance awaits it for the crimes
 it has committed.  The armed intervention of the United States
 of America in Korea has brought to the limit the wrath of the
 Korean people and their hatred of the American imperialist
 aggressors and colonisers and their South Korean hirelings.
 Our heroic youth in a wide stream are voluntarily flocking to
 the People's Army, and the number of volunteers has exceeded
 500,000. In the districts liberated by the People's Army the en-
 tire population gives a warm welcome to tic glorious People's
 Army which has liberated it from the Syngman Rhee police
 regime.  The liberated people are r-storing the people's commit-
 tees which were disbanded by the reaction and are putting into

 ec~ a   ons i u u         e    e
 Republic, which ensures the freedom and rights of the people.
 The peasants of the liberated districts, by Decree of the
 Presidium of the Supreme National Assembly of the Korean
 People's Democratic Republic, are starting to carry out land re-
 form: All the land belonging to the American imperialists, the
 Syngman Rhee puppet' Government, Korean landowners and
 national traitors, is confiscated and is transferred to the perpetual
 use of the peasants without compensation.
 . The victories of the People's Army, the unanimous support
 given it by the entire Korean people, prove the stability of, the
 Korean People's Democratic Republic and bear witness to the
 fact that the entire Korean people fully supports the policy
 of the Government of the Korean  People's  Democratic
 Republic, which is defending the unity, freedom and indepen-
 dence of our Motherland against the infamous design of the
 American imperialists to enslave our Motherland and deprive
 the Korean people of independence, and against their armed
 invasion of the territory of our Motherland.
 In order to save the Syngman Rhee clique, which carried
 out the American policy in Korea and has now suffered defeat,
 the American imperialists are intensifying armed aggression
 against the Korean people.  Were it not for the direct armed
 intervention by American imperialism, the civil war provoked
 in our country by the servitors of American imperialism would
 long since have ended. The unification of our land would have
 long since been completed and the population of Southern
 Korea would have long since completely liberated itself from
 the reactionary police regime of the Syngman Rhee traitors.
 The armed attack by the American imperialists on Korea has
 aroused the indignation of democratic public opinion through-
 out the world. Our great and just cause enjoys the ardent support
 and sympathy of the peace-loving people of the entire world.
 Dear compatriots!   Brothers and sisters!   The malicious
 enemies of the freedom and independence of the Korean people,
 the American imperialists, have stretched out their tentacles to _
 our Motherland in order to enslave her.  The entire Korean
 people, united like one man, must answer by a decisive blow,
 the blow of the American imperialists. The American imperial-
 ists will undoubtedly learn how great and inexhaustible is the
 strength, and how unshakable is the fighting spirit, of the Korean
 people, fighting for the freedom and independence of their
 Motherland.
 Our people will under no circumstances once more become a
 colonial slave. All who hold dear the glory, freedom and inde-
 pendence of their Motherland must rise against the armed attack

 of the American imperialists.  All must take part in the sacrr3
 war of liberation of our Motherland.
 Kim Ir Sen called on the people of Korea, the men and cotn-
 rnanders of the People's Artny, men and women guerillas, to
 multiply their efforts for the complete defeat of the enemy, and
 concluded by saving:
 Let us wage our just liberation struggle to the end. Forward
 to victory!  Long live free and independent Korea!
 SYNGMAN RHEE'S PREPARATIONS FOR
 TIl E ATTACK ON NORTH KOREA
 Revelations by his "Minister of the Interior"
 KIM I SEK, until the spring "Minister of the Interior"  of the
 puppet Syngrnan Rhee Governrnent, has broadcast over Seoul radio
 an exposure of the treacherous  activity  of Syngrnan Rhee,  who
 unleashed war in Korea on Washington's direct bidding.  Kim I Sek
 declared:
 IT is well-known that Syngman ;Thee became President of the
 puppet Government under the slogan "Offensive against the
 North." The Syngman Rhee clique, already shortly after the
 holding of the falsified separate elections; intended to launch
 an offensive against the North.  I directly participated in the
 preparations for this offensive, which was scheduled for July 15,
 1949.
 At that time Syngrnan Rhee ordered Kim Sek Won to attack
 the North in the area of Ongjin and to capture Phyeng-yang,
 and Tsai Ben Dek to command the central front.  However,
 this plan could not, be realised owing to the greatly intensified
 guerilla struggle.  If it had not been for the energetic actions
 of the guerillas, who threatened the rear, and if there had been
 sufficient forces available at that lime, the offensive against the
 North would have started in July of last year.
 Despite the fact that the plan of the July offensive of last
 year was disrupted the Syngman Rhee clique did not for a
 moment halt their preparations  for an offensive against the
 North.  In the preparations for this internecine war I also
 took an active part.  As is well known, on General MacArthur's
 invitation Syngman Rhee visited Japan this spring.  There he
 received an order from  MacArth _ir to put his army at Mac-
 Arthur's disposal for the duration of the "campaign against
 the North" and to conduct joint trsining of officers of so-called
 "army of national defence" and those of the Japanese Army.
 Syngman Rhee complied with tha order, being convinced that,

 Approved For Release 2001/12/05 : CI -FtQP? rgP4 5PAQfa900090001
 vsihen he 'started his campaign agai s
 and
 receive the support of
 Japan, and hate he was bound to
 an Army of volunteers the,
 win the war.
 That is why Syngman Rhee ordered Kim Sek Won and Tsai
 Ben Dek at dawn on June 25 to launch an offensive against
 North Korea. According to the words of Kim Sek Won him-
 self, the plan of operations consisted in advancing from Ong
 jin to capture Hai Chiu (Kaisu) and later Phyeng-yang, and in
 support of this operation to start an offensive on the eastern
 front extending over the whole of the 38th Parallel.
 Despite all this it is being declared that the war was started
 by North Korea. This is an unpardonable lie. This is a base
 provocation of the American imperialists and the Syngman
 Rhee clique who want to saddle others with the responsibility
 for the war that they themselves unleashed.
 The entire responsibility for the present war rests with Syng-
 man Rhee's clique and his masters, the American imperialists.
 For a long time I fabricated false rumours about Northern
 Korea, without understanding the real conditions there.  Now
 I can see the happy life of the people liberated from the terror
 of the barbarous clique of Syngman Rhee.
 In conclusion, Kim 1 Sek called on all those who had pur-
 sued the road of treason to admit their guilt before the people's
 power and to start a new life.

 :LAND REFORM DECREE FOR
 SOUTHERN KOREA
 The Presidium of the Supreme National Assembly of the
 Korean People's Democratic Republic has passed a Decree on
 conducting a land reform in the Southern part of the Republic.
 On the basis of Article 7 of the Constitution of the Korean
 People's Democratic Republic, the Decree says, land reform
 will be carried out in the Southern part of the Republic. This
 reform is to be carried out on the principle of the confiscation
 of land without compensation and its distribution free of charge
 among the landless and small peasants.
 In accordance with the Decree, all land owned by the
 American imperialists, the Syngman Rhee Government and its
 organs, firms and companies, the estates of Korean landowners
 as well as plots of land rented out permanently, regardless of
 their size are subject to confiscation. The renting out of land is
 abolished forever.
 The confiscated land is to be distributed among small and
 landless peasants and to agriculaural workers.  Land can be
 owned by anyone who tills it himself.  All debts for land are
 cancel led.
 The Decree stipulates the abolition of all taxes which existed
 under the puppet regime and lays down that the peasants in
 the, Southern part of the Republic: are to pay to the State only
 one single tax of the same amount as already established in
 the Northern part of the Republic.
 With a view to raising as quickly as possible the living stan-
 dards of the peasants in the liberated areas, the Presidium of
 the Supreme National Assembly of the Korean People's
 Democratic Republic instructed tiie Cabinet of Ministers con-
 siderably to reduce the amount of tax paid in kind for 1950. The
 Decree establishes the order in which the reform is to be
 effected and charges the Cabinet of Ministers with the working
 out of special instructions on putting this Decree into practice.

 MR. TRYGVE LIE
 Concerning Security Council Resolution of July 7
 Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations Organisation,
 forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the U.S:S.R. the
 following telegram, communicating the text of the resolution adopted
 by the Security Council on the Korean problem:
 HAVE the honour to communicate the following text of
 the resolution adopted by the Security Council at its 476th
 meeting held on "July 7, 1950:
 "The Security Council, having determined that the armed
 attack upon the Republic of Korea by forces from North
 Korea constitutes a breach of peace, having recommended
 that the members of the United Nations furnish such assis-
 tance to the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel
 the armed attack and to restore international peace and
 security in the area,
 "1. Welcomes the prompt and vigorous support which the
 Governments and peoples of the United Nations have given
 to its resolutions of June 25 and 27, 1950, to assist the
 Republic of Korea in defending itself against armed attack
 and thus to restore international peace and security in the
 area,
 "2. Notes that members of the United Nations have trans-
 mitted to the United Nations offers of assistance for the
 Republic of Korea,
 "3. Recommends that all members providing military forces
 and other assistance pursuant to the aforesaid Security Council
 resolutions make such forces and other assistance available
 to the unified command under the United States,
 "4. Requests the United States to designate the Commander
 of such forces,
 "5. Authorises the unified command, at its discretion, to
 use the United Nations flag in the course of operations against
 the North Korean forces concurrently with the flags of various
 nations participating,
 "6. Requests the United States to provide the Security
 Council with reports, as appropriate, on the course of action

 Trygve Lie:
 MR. TRYGVE LIE, Secretary-General of the United Nations
 Organisation, New York.
 The Soviet Government has received your telegram 'which
 gives the text of the Security Council's resolution of July 7
 with regard to placing armed forces and other means at the
 disposal of the so-called "Unified Command under the United
 States",  to requesting the United States to designate the com-
 mander for such forces and to using the United Nations flag
 passed with the same gross violations of theUnited Nations
 Charter as was also the Security Council's-'
 ouncil's resolution on the
 Korean problem of June 27.  This resolution was taken in the
 absence of two permanent memhers of the Security Council-
 the Soviet Union and China--and furthermore by only six votes,
 with the participation of a seventh-a Kuomintangite--who has
 no lawful right to represent Chira.
 In view of the said circumstances it is clear that this decision
 of the Security Council cannot have legal force either.
 Furthermore, the Soviet Government deems it necessary to
 call attention to the following:
 The aforesaid resolution of the Security Council aims at un-
 lawfully using the United Nations flag to cover the armed actions
 of the United States in Koren, which constitute direct aggression
 on the part of the United States with regard to the Korean
 people.
 All. this gives ground for the Soviet Government to declare
 that the Security Council's decision of July 7 is, firstly, unlaw-
 ful and, secondly represents direct support to the armed aggres-
 sion against the Korean people.

 Baku, Tbilisi, Tashkent, Riga, Stalingrad, Novosibirsk, Sverdlovsk,

 Soviet women and youth warmly approve the peaceful policy of
 the Soviet Government and proclaim the unanimous readiness
 of the working people of the U.S.S.R., together with the peoples

 dcuction costs.  In the districts of the country where the harvest
 has begun State grain deliveries ahead of time are being
 organised.
 The successful course of the collection of signatures to the
 Stockholm Appeal in the U.S.S.R. is a powerful demonstration
 of the moral and political unity of Soviet society, of the devo-
 tion of the Soviet people to their Government, the Bolshevik
 Party and the great standard-bearer of peace, Comrade Stalin.
