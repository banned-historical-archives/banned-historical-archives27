 This is t wo:?lt+nl, paper,  reflecting; information available
 through May 1960.
 The Slno-Soviet Studies Group would welcome either written
 or oral comment on this paper.
 The writer desires to acknowledge the valuable assistance
 given by analysts in other officers.  Special mention must be
 made of the Foreign Manpower Rasea.;ch Office of the Bureau of
 the Census, which provided many source and bibliographic ma-
 terials for this study.
 A contribution which saved weeks of spade work was the
 draft of a manuscript on Chinese population policy prepared by
 John Aird of the Foreign Manpower Research Office.   Apart from
 the cogent presentation of issues in Mr. Aird's work, his
 voluminous footnotes directed attention to source material that
 would otherwise have been missed.  Later, he a.nd
 the Office of Research and Reports--                      con-
 cerned with population issues in Communist China--reviewed this
 study in detail.   As a result of their suggestions, portions of
 the original text were revised.

 The generosity must also be acknowledged of Leo A. Orleans
 of the Air Research Division in the Library of Congress, who
 furnished copies both of his published articles and of a manu-
 script still in draft.   The manuscript will appear as an article,
 "Birth Control in China," in the summer 1960 issue of China
 Quarterly.
 the Office of Research and Reports went
 over the text and was part4.cularly helpful on the subject of
 Chinese agriculture.

 the Office 25X11
 of Research and Reports also went over the text and made important
 corrections in the section on China's economic prospects.
 Although the suggestions of these analysts have in general
 been incorporated into the study, they do not share responsibility
 for all the views expressed. The conclussions are those of the writer.

 IMODUCT ION AND SUMMARY
 This study is addressed to  the political developments
 attending rapid population incroase in Communist China. The
 survey is not exhaustive but rather directed to two main
 areas of examination.,  (1) the varying attitudes of the Chi-
 nose Communist leaders, ;and (2) the impact of China's popu-
 lation problem on the Si.rno-Soviet relationship.  Although
 these terms of reference are political, the study opens with
 a review of the Chinese demographic setting and its economic
 correlates.  This review presents the projections that eco-
 nomic intelligence currently accepts as authoritative or
 reasonable.
 It is possible to demonstrate mathematically that, at
 the current rate of population growth, the Chinese would
 number some eight billion persons a hundred years from now--
 more than 2.5 times the present population of the earth. For
 three reasons, a look so far into the future is not attempted
 in this study.   First, economic and other circumstances will
 probably limit population growth long before China becomes
 this coTwded.   Second, population projections beyond a few
 decades are notably unreliable.  Third, the immediate intel-
 ligence need is for a shorter-term study.
 However, the compass of a study on population should be
 longer than the five years or so customary to strategic esti-
 mates.  For the moment at least, economic progress in Commu-
 nist China is keeping pace with and in some sectors running
 ahead of population growth.  But demographic factors, like
 those disabilities which do not diminish the talents of ath-
 letes in their py ime,  are persistent and long range.  Thus
 this study looks forward 25 years to 1985.
 The prospect for continued Communist domination in China
 rests to a large extent on the regime's ability to cope with
 the economic problems that Population pressure will generate.
 While the economic aspect of the problem is not central to
 this study, it is pertinent; the political analyst should ap-
 preciate that China's (economic growth may well be adequate to
 the task of sustaining the rapidly expanding population. The
 judgment is admittedly qualified, simply because the demo-
 graphic and economic projections discussed in Sections I and II

 arc not firm.   But if the projoctions are accoptod as reason-
 ablo working hypotheses, it follows that the resource/popula-
 tion ratio in itself will not necessarily be so unsatisfactory
 as to topplo the Communist regime in the period under review.
 It may, however, be a persuasive factor in politburo discus-
 sl.ons and eventuate in a more forceful birth control program
 than the Communists have so far considered.
 The political analysis proper begins in Section III,
 which discusses the regime's irresolute measures to popular-
 ize birth control in China.  There is evidence that the Com-
 munists were troubled by the difficulties of reconciling
 Marxist dogma and economic logic,  and it appears likely that
 the advisability of birth control was debated in the party
 hierarchy from the politburo down.  The differences were not
 so serious, however, as to lead to irreconcilable divergencies
 among the most important leaders.   Mao Tse-tung and the likely
 rivals for the succession, Liu Shao-chi and Chou En-lai, have
 all shown interest in birth control, although Mao and Liu may
 have been a bit more scrupulous than Chou in clinging to Marx-
 ist and anti-Malthusian standpoints.
 The possibilities of doctrinal divergencies between the
 Chinese and Soviet Communists on the issue of population lim-
 itation are examined next.  The dominant strain in Communist
 polemics on population is a vitriolic hostility to Malthusian
 arguments.  The Communists tolerate no suggestions that the
 escape from mass poverty is blocked ultimately by biologic
 rather than institutional barriers.   It is shown, however,
 that the orthodox texts are not entirely devoid of indications
 that policies to limit population size are acceptable in cer-
 tain stages of development.   If the Chinese party is at all
 scrupulous in its doctrinal formulations on the population
 question (and it has spoken with due care so far), the Soviet
 leaders may have their private reservations but will be reluc-
 tant to take open issue.  This judgment is buttressed by Soviet
 taciturnity to date, not only with respect to China's popula-
 tion policy, but in connection also with birth control programs
 adopted in Eastern Europe.  The Russians themselves, moreover,
 have gone on record since Stalin's death in favor of easing re-
 strictions against abortions and contraception.
 The geopolitical as distinct from the doctrinal aspect is
 examined in the final section.   It is concluded that the danger
 to the Soviet Union of land-hungry Chinese seeking lebensraum
 in the Siberian "vacant lot" is minimal within the next 25 years.
 China's large population nevertheless remains a major element
 in its strategic stature; as the spokesman of most of the people

 SrECTTi;T
 In the Communist camp, Peiping is accorded due hearing and
 deference in bloc councils.   It now speaks for two-thirds
 of the population.   By 1985, the proportion will be closer
 to three-fourths, and Soviet loaders may view with misgiv-
 ings the effect on the balance of forces within the bloc.
 Soviet loaders publicly dismiss as provocative any sug-
 gestions that Chinese hordes pose a long-range threat to the
 USSR.   The Russian man in the street has been franker to voice
 his misgivings, and there is evidence that his expressions of
 apprehension reflect influential viewpoints, however  impo-
 litic it may be to express such viewpoints officially.  To
 many thoughtful persons in the USSR, the ever-swelling num-
 ber of Chinese is stirring up a cloud from the east that must
 progressively darken the prospects for harmony in the Sino-
 Soviet relationship.

 Communist China is by far the most populous country in
 the world.   Its rate of population increase, moreover, is one
 of the world's fastest.'
 Census and vital figures
 According to Communist statistics, the population of
 mainland China as of 30 June 1953 was about 533,000,000 peo-
 ple.                    The figure--some 100,000,000 higher than most estimates
 at the time--now is generally, if not universally,  accepted as
 reasonably accurate.  Although Peiping had to settle on esti-
 mates for some of the ethnic minorities in remote areas, it
 claims that 574,000,000 people were counted by direct enumera-
 tion in the 1953 census; errors for the relatively few not
 reached by the census takers should not affect the general re-
 liability of the count.
 While the difficulties of enumeration in an area like
 China preclude the degree of accuracy possible in Western cen-
 suses, the schedules and procedures used indicate that Peiping
 made an earnest effort to conduct the country's first nation-
 wide count by modern methods.   As a check on the reliability
 of the census, the Communists resurveyed some 9 percent of the
 people.  This sample survey yielded relatively small discrep-
 ancies from the census count.
 In the absence of good vital statistics, the Communists
 conducted a special enumeration of 30 million persons during
 the census in an effort to come up with reliable figures on
 births and deaths.  The Chinese birth rate, according to the
 results of this enumeration, was 37 per thousand (37 babies born
 annually for every thousand people in the population); the death
 rate was given as 17 per thousand.  These figures,  in contrast
 to the over-all population total, are suspect.  An analysis of
 the census tabulation of children under five years of age indi-
 cates that 37 per thousand is a considerable understatement of
 the birth rate.   It has been suggested that both the birth and
 death rates given by the sample survey err on the low side.
 However, the difference between the two rates--20 per thous-
 and or 2 percent compounded annually--may be a fair approxima-
 tion of the rate of population increase in the early 1950s.   It

 is on the order of twice previous estimates, but not out
 of lino with demonstrated achievements after World War II
 in other Asian areas.   Starting out with very high birth
 and death rates, these areas have effected sharp reductions
 in death rates attendant upon dramatic progress in sanita-
 tion and public health.  The sharpest cuts seem to have been
 made in infant mortality.   "About two million more infants,"
 claims Peiping,  "survive annually than in pro-liberation days,
 as a result of the wide application of modern midwifery."
 The Communists themselves show no disposition to dis-
 count the 2-percent growth rate.   On the basis presumably of
 the more and more nearly complete birth and death registra-
 tions in their regimented society, the Communists have in fact
 steadily raised the figure.   In their most recent statements,
 a 2.5-percent rate of natural increase has been mentioned. On
 the basis of a 2- to 2.5-percent rate of increase since the
 1953 census, China's population today (1960) is estimated at
 possibly 690 million.  By way of comparison with the next-
 ranking countries of the world in population size, mainland
 China has 1.7 times as many people as India, some 3.2 times
 as many as the USSR, and 3.8 times as many as the United
 States.  And with its higher rate of natural increase,  China
 leaves the others farther behind every year.
 The population outlook
 A growth rate of 2 percent confronts the Chinese Com-
 munists with the necessity of developing resources to support
 well over a billion people by the year 1935.   If the growth
 rate is taken as 2.5 percent, the population will number some
 1-1/4 billion in 1985.
 These figures are not to be taken as forecasts.   No mat-
 ter how fast water levels may be rising, they will go only so
 high unless the dikes too are being built up.  The population
 levels given for 1985 suggest what can happen only if economic
 output in China is adequate to support the number of peepl a
 postulated by the projections.   If such is not the case and
 the birth rate continues high, a situation analogous to water
 spill-over will obtain.  Famine, deficiency diseases, and the
 other correlates of deepening goverty will raise the death
 rate and stabilize the population at a level that the economy
 can support.
 The alternatives presented to the Chinese Communists then
 are: expand economic output or cut. the birth rate.  (The two
 choices are of course not mutually exclusive.) The economic

 outlook is discussed in the next section.   Inso:tar as the birth
 rate is concerned,  the following factors a: re likely to be gov-
 orning up to 1985:
 1.  Birth control is neither widely approved no:. prac-
 ticed.  Even if the Communists revive and intensify earlier
 efforts to popularize contraception, the results should take
 years to become evident.  A particular handicap is the pre-
 dominantly rural character of the Chinese population; unre-
 sponsive as China's urban residents showed themselves to
 birth control propaganda, the countryside is even more re-
 sistant.  Judgments here, however have to be qualified by
 reservations relating to changes now under way in the social
 organization of Chinese rural society.   On a priori grounds,
 extension of the "free supply" system of payments or partial
 payments by the communes on the basis of need would seem pro-
 natalist in effect, relieving heads of large families from
 many economic anxieties.  On the other hand, the family sys-
 tem has been the institutional basis of high birth rates in
 China, and the breakdown of old values is one of the declared
 purposes of the communes.   If regimentation in the countryside
 takes forms envisaged by the more extreme elements in the party,
 there will be some additional disorganization of family units
 as a result of communal messes, rearing of children away from
 their parents, separation of aged from their relatives, and
 mobilization of man for work on distant projects.  As Commu-
 nist administration reaches deeper into rural life, the old
 adage "Heaven is high and the Emperor far away" will lose more
 ~_?rd more of its force.  With a blurring of the lines differ-
 entiating peasant from urban worker, both may become almost
 equally responsive to official and general social pressures
 making for lower birth rates.
 2.  Projections of the Chinese population by age groups
 have not been worked out for the next 25 years, but when com-
 pleted, they may show a downward force on birth rates during
 some of the period because of a falling proportion of females
 of child-bearing age.  On the other hand, there has probably
 been a rather precipitate decline in infant mortality recently,
 and this should increase the proportion of females of child-
 bearing age in the 1970s.  However effective birth control
 propaganda and other social pressures are in cutting into
 family size, they may have to work against  n, mericu.l  fac-
 tors tending to keep up the birth rate during at least some
 of the years in the period under purview.
 3.  Even if the birth rate should decline, the total
 Chinese population will probably still increase rapidly. The

 reason is that the death rate is oxpect3d to decline too. Re-
 cent experience in other Asian countries is indicative of po-
 toatialitles that may well be realized during the next two
 riacades, if not sooner, in Conuiiun:ist China through the spread
 of inoculations, wider applications of Insecticides,  and other
 advances in public health.  Average death rates for 1'335-39
 in Ceylon, Taiwan, Malaya, and Singapore (the only four non-
 Communist areas of the Far East  where  official death regis-
 trations approaci completion) ranged from 20 to about 25 per
 thousand.   Fifteen years later, the death rates for these four
 areas ranged from 10 to 14 per thousand; they are still less
 today.   While the Chinese birth rate may eventually move close
 to the falling death rate, the experience of other countries
 suggests a time lag.   The expectation is for no closing of the
 gap sufficient to prevent a large increase in the population
 within the n(,xt 25 years.
 The a priori judgments implicit in this presentation of
 the demographic vectors are numerous.  Events may not work out
 as the mathematics foretell; indeeed demographic projections
 constructed in recent years have proved embarrassingly wide of
 tho mark.  The error, however,  is as likely as not to be an
 underestimate of later population growth.  A billion-man China
 is an unsettling thought,       but the burden of evidence indicates
 it to be a likely eventuality if the fore^s now at work con-
 tinue to be operative.

 II. THE ECONOMIC PROSPECT
 While economies like Japan's have been able to sustain
 larger populations than agricultural resources permitted, the
 Chinese are apparently determined to stay self-sufficient in
 food. The decision is neither arbitrary nor irrational.  De-
 pendence on food imports to feed as little as 10 percent of
 China's present population would requx,e about $2 billion in
 foreign exchange outlays, equal to the value of all the in-
 dustrial equipment and other goods the regime now buys abroad.
 To date, the-Communist record in keeping pace with popu-
 lation growth has been creditable.  Taking over an economy
 that was a net importer of food, the regime has turned the
 country into a net exporter, although per capita consumption
 remains at subsistence levels.   The First Five-Year Plan ended
 in 1957 with the amount of food available per capita as high as
 or barely higher than it was in 1952. The "leap forward" of
 1958 increased production of food grains by about 15 percent
 over 1957, but there may have been a 10-percent drop back in
 1959.
 a)
 The food outlook
 The Chinese are clearly counting on further successes in
 expanding food output.  A 12-year plan of agricultural devel-
 opment drafted in 1956 contained no specific goals, but polit-
 buro member Chen Po-ta said that agricultural output could be
 doubled in teat years. In the same vein, economic planner Li
 Fu-chun in October 1959 urged the technical modernization of
 Chinese agriculture within some ten years.   "In this way," he
 concluded,  "we shall be able to doubla and redouble our agri-    lJ
 cultura.L production under conditions where, agricultural lp.bor
 productivity is enormously increased while the total manpower
 used on agricultural production is substantially reduced."
 The  ?roj actions of economic intelligence and Western agri-
 cultural analysts are more sober.  The shock efforts of 1958
 produced impressive results, but the inability to proceed to
 higher levels the next year demonstrates the very real limits
 imposed by weather, by the scarcity of arable land, and by
 technological backwardness.   The expectation is that food pro-
 duction will go up by possibly 3 percent a year over the next
 decade.  This would be somewhat bette;' than the rate of popu-
 lation
 growth and perhaps barely enough to provide for the

 changes in consumption patterns asL,aciated with increasing
 urbanization of societyf.                                                                It would not afford much margin
 for the incentives needed to kindle the best production ef-
 forts of peasants and workers;                                                                                                and the regime would have
 compelling reasons for implementing and considerably strength-
 ening its declared policy of encouraging, birth control in China.
 The rose.rvatic :s expressed in, the preceding section with
 rospect to the predictive value of denograp,phic projections ap-
 ply with still greater force to projections of food production.
 The variables are so many as to discourage extension of the
 3-percent ?-per-year projection down to 1985.  A groat deal de-
 pends on decisions the regime will make with respect to the
 distribution of new investments between industry and agricul-
 ture.  Apart from the direct investments in agriculture, par-
 ticular importance will attach to funds allocated for the ex-
 pansion of such support industries as chemical fertilizer,
 farm machinery,  electric power.   Decisions relating to the
 distribution of consumer goods between town and country may
 also be important.
 Perhaps the factor of overriding significance will be the
 stage of China's industrialization after 1970--a state of ad-
 vance that will permit the regime far greater latitude to in-
 crease investments in, say, chemical fertilizer plants than it
 enjoys today.   The concluding pages of this section discuss the
 prospects for the industrial sector of the economy; it suffices
 here to note that some extraordinary advances are projected by
 economic intelligence.  China's annual electric power produc-
 tion, for example,  is estimated to go as high as 315 billion
 kilowatt-hours by 1970, about 15 percent above the current
 level in the USSR.  There are grounds for estimating,  there-
 fore, that the regime will be able to increase substantially
 the allocations to agriculture and agricultural support indus-
 tries after 1970 and that the subsequent expansion of food pro-
 duction for some years thereafter will be at a rate of growth
 higher than that achieved in the 1960s.  Daeprooted convictions
 on the point are not justified, ho x.:giver, since higher alloca-
 tions to agriculture may be called for merely to maintain the
 earlier growth rate.
 Lines of probable development in aR?rlculture
 When the Communists consider themselves in a batter posi-
 tion to direct more funds to agriculture, the expansion of
 crop acreage is a likely developmen't'.   Only 11 percent of Chi-
 na's land is now under cultivation.   Expansion of acreage to
 13-15 percent of the area is considered economically practical
 in conservative calculations; much of the remaining land area

 is doomed entirely unsuitt.d for cultivation barring a major
 revolution in agricultural technology.   In thu frontier areas,
 Manchuria is regarded as pa-ticularly promising.  The com-
 plotion of the railroad through Sinkiang in 1961 will open
 up now lands in the far West as well.   Closer to home, there
 are economic possibilities in the reclamation of denuded hilly
 lands.   The investment outlays required for expanding acreage
 are considerable however; in the competition for limitoc' cap-
 ital, the Communists will be disinclined in 'the next few years
 to give highest priority to a now-lands effort.  Farm spokes-
 man Tong Tzu-hui intimatad in 1957 that better returns on
 capital were for the present obtainable from other programs.
 "It can be mentioned here," he observed,  "that some difficul-
 ties have been encountered in the :Largo-scalp wasteland recla-
 mation program in our country as a whole."
 China's most important recourse, oven before acreage is
 expanded toward its outer limits, is to increase yiolds.   Con-
 siderable progress has already been made along lines recom-
 mended by Nationalist technicians working with US advisers
 after the end of World War II:
 1.   Extension of multiple cropping areas.  The Communists
 claim that 40 percent of the farm land now yields more than
 one harvest. Further progress is promised.
 2.   Improvements in irrigation and flood control.  Ambi-
 tious water conservancy projects now under way involve con-
 struction of some of the world's largest dams in the Yellow,
 Yangtse, and other major riverways.   On a smaller scale, local
 government units are financing the construction of numerous
 wells, ponds, and irrigation works.
 3.   Control of animal and plant diseases and insect pests.
 Prewar losses from insects, destructive birds, and other an-
 imals were serious; 12,000,000 tons were lost from damage by
 insects 41one.  The Chinese at present do not have sufficient
 quantitites of cheap insecticide.; and fungicides and equipment
 for applying these materials on a massive scale.
 4.    Improvements in seed strains and livestock breeding.
 The Nationalists introduced new varieties of cotton, wheat,
 rice, and tobacco and conducted some promising research in
 soybeans, millet, kaoliang, and potatoes.   The Communists are
 carrying on this work with a view to developing strains which
 are quicker maturing, larger yielding, and more resistant to
 disease.   Communist research activities are also directed to
 the problem of infectious diseases in animals, which before

 aroas can "reduce yields appreciably.  The doanands of harvest
 time and need for quick irrigation of fields during dry spells
 also occasion labor shorta;;ns that may seriously impair yiolds.
 In the col:loctivo and later the eowfwane forms of organization,
 the Communists claim to have organizod .rural labor much more
 efficiently than was possible in "pre-liberation" years and
 thereby minimized losses from temporary labor shortages.
 6.   Ex,ansion of fertilizer production.   Projected in-
 creases in food production to keep pace with probable popula-
 tion growth over the next decade would boost annual require-
 ments of chemical fertilizer to perhaps 25,000,000 tons.  By
 contrast, present applications total about 3,000,000 tons.
 However, the Communists are planning to turn out as much as
 7,000,000 tons in 1962, and are looking forward to 20,000,000 tons by 1969.   There is some doubt that this last figure will
 be reached, but if domestic production is supplemented by some \ (J
 imports, fertilizer availability may come within the general
 range of estimated requirements.
 The over-all picture is one of Communist vigor and determi-
 nation to expand food production at least as fast as population
 growth in the coming decade.   In a sense, the Communists will
 be conducting a holding operation in agriculture during these
 ten years, throwing their greatest energies into the heavy in-
 dustry sector.   In the 1970s and 1980s, they will not be able
 to put off progressively larger investments to increase agri-
 cultural output    (e.g. in fertilizer plants); but `heir record
 so far and their prospective industrial capabilities as de-
 scribed below suggest that the Communists may well make the
 decisions to increase the outlays when necessary.   Since the
 authorities seem disposed to defer such decisions, they will
 presumably continue to view with some favor the idea of a
 curb on population growth.   Possible technological break-
 throughs (hydroponics, unicellular plant organisms, harvest-
 ing of the sea, solar energy for irrigation purposes, or
 other lines of advance conjectured by anti-Malthusian opti-
 mists) would of course facilitate matters for the regime and
 weaken the pressures for implementing a population limitation

 Industrial outlook
 Food supplies constitute a limit oii population size, but
 techniques of cultivation and levels of investment in agri-
 culture are closely rolatod to the state oU industrial tech-
 nology.   It is the industrial societies (even those that are
 self-sufficient in food production) that can support large
 population densities comfortably, and it is in the industrial
 sector that the Chinese Communists have made their most im-
 pressive achievements.   Steel ingot production, which stood at
 1-1/3 million tons in 1952 before the First Five-Year Plan,
 came to over 13,000,000 in 1959.   Electric power output rose
 from 7 billion kilowatt-hours to 39 billion.  Railway trans-
 portation, coal mining, cement, machine tools, all made giant
 strides.  Over-all industrial production went up on an average
 of 20 percent per annum.
 The rapid industrial growth has contributed to a rate of
 increase in gross national product that comes to 9 percent
 since 1952, well above the 2- or 2.5-percent rate of popula-
 tion increase.  The channeling of national product into in-
 vestment funds has kept standards of living very low for most
 of the people but is sustaining a development that is likely
 to make China the dominant industrial power in Asia well be-
 fore 1985.
 The high percentage increases in China are not altogether
 attributable to the low absolute levels on which the calcula-
 tions are based.   In key segments of the industrial sector
 (steel, coal, electric power), the Chinese have for several
 years now been past the line from which the USSR started in
 1928.  The Chinese continue to expand production as fast as
 or faster than did the USSR.
 The thesis has been advanced that the need to meet the
 bare subsistence requirements of a rapidly expanding popula-
 tion will eventually force the regime to cut back on new in-
 vestments and stifle further industrial growth.  Whatever the
 ultimate validity of this viewpoint, the accepted projections
 do not bear it out for the shorter term.   Investments in Com-
 munist China, which ran around 17 percent of gross national
 product under the First Five-Year Plan, now come to about 33
 percent.   In 1970, the regime is expected to allocate 40 per-
 cent of the gross national product to investments.
 As the dynamics work out, gross national product will go up
 by about 8 percent a year over the next decade.   Industrial
 production will increase 14 percent per annum.  By 1970, steel

 production in China is expected to go above 40,000,000 tons,
 the level of Soviet production in 1954; electric power at 315
 billion kilowatt-hours will exceed today's level of Soviet
 output; petroleum production at 36,000,000 tons will come close
 to the Soviet level of 1950.  The structure of the industrial
 economy in the 1970s and 1980s is more difficult to foresee;
 the consensus, however, is that industry in China will not be
 the limiting factor on population growth during this period and
 ,that industry will be, in    an increasingly good position to sup-
 port the agricultural sector with supplies of fertilizer, irri-
 gation machinery, tractors, other farm equipment, construction
 materials, and pesticides.

 III.   131 1TH CONTROL IN CHINA
 The Chinese Communists, wrote Liu Shao-chi in October
 1959, have been "flexibly applying the general principles of
 Marxism-Leninism in the light of the concrete conditions in
 China."   As a characterization of Peiping's approach to the
 population question, the statement could be improved by sub-
 stituting the word "irresolutely" for "flexibly."  The rea-
 son is in large part reluctance to admit previous error. The
 "concrete conditions" of high population pressure had al-
 ways been articulated in greatest detail by non-Communists,
 men whose formulations did not place on capitalism and im-
 perialism the prime responsibility for mass pauperism in
 China.   In the orthodox tradition that flowed from Marx's
 origia%n1 fulminations against Malthus, the Communists re-
 torted'that a recast social order would release society's
 productive energies and provide amply for China's millions.
 The definition of position was vehement, so that the Commu-
 nists were left with only limited room for doctrinal maneuver
 when the responsibilities of office forced them to examine
 the issue anew.
 The attitude in the early years
 It took several years of office for the "concrete con-
 ditions" to impress themselves on Chinese Communist thinking.
 The early statements reflected official confidence that the
 size of the population was a major ingredient of national
 strength rather than weakness.   With pride and no trace of
 misgiving, Mao referred to China in 1949 as "forming one-
 quarter of mankind."  The official New China News Agency af-
 firmed at this time that China's population was a "very good
 thing."  The Communists could cope with a population many
 times the present size.   "All pessimistic statments are ground-
 less."  As late as April 1952, the official party newspaper
 People's Daily, denounced birth control as a "means of kill-
 ing off the Chinese people."
 The arithmetic of national accounting probably had an
 all-important influence in modifying official thinking.   De-
 termined to maximize capital accumulation, the Communists had
 nevertheless to allow some part of the national product for

 th
 e most favorable milieu for birth control programs.
 After the middle of 1953, the economic as compared with
 strictly military rationale became more persuasive.   In
 August 1953, the Government Administration Council headed
 by Premier Chou En-lai (the present State Council) issued
 a directive that the Ministry of Public Health "help the
 masses excercise birth control."  The directive expressed
 ing
 the
 tion
 to contraception and abortion.   Only four months earlier,
 local authorities in Canton had prohibited the importa-
 of contraceptives, even those prescribed by physicians.
 L`)
 The authorities may have been newly impressed by the
 economic arguments, but they moved with caution.   There had
 been no effort as yet to reconcile the contradictions with
 previously expressed positions on the virtue of a large popu-
 lation, and the directive to the Ministry of Public Health
 was given no publicity.   In fact, it was not until 1957--four
 years later--that the public media made any reference to the
 directive.
 The re-examination of traditional viewpoints on birth
 control received fresh impetus when the results of the 1953
 census was tabulated in 1954.   The public commentary on the
 census results hailed the totals and used the occasion for
 attacks in the old vein against defeatist Malthusians. But
 with the total population now revealed as 100,000,000 above
 the previous estimates and increasing by 12,000,000 or so
 every year, the demographic-economic calculus apparently
 persuaded all but the extreme doctrinaires that a campaign
 to limit births was in order.
 current consumption.   In the predominantly agricultural set-
 ting characterized by much rural underemployment,  the national
 product seemed a derivative more of acres cultivated than
 of numbers of persons working.   Total consumption, on the
 other hand, depended on population size.   At the current
 stage of national development,  the economic planners may
 well have concluded that fewer people would not,reduce
 national product but would cut total consumption and there-
 by permit a lamer amount for capital accumulation.
 This line of reasoning would have car.,.?ied the greatest
 conviction after the end of the Korean fighting.   Wartime,
 when national security seems closely related to the size
 of armies that can be mustered, does not generally provide
 approval of the Ministry's relaxation of regulations relat-

 The Campaign begins
 The party moved gingerly; it was prepared, if reluctant,
 to encourage birth control, but it was by no means willing
 to concede any merit to Malthusian viewpoints.   When British
 Labor party loader Clement Aitlee visited China in the sum-
 mer of 1954, Mao is said to have acknowledged the dbsirabil .
 ity of birth control after the population reached 7'10,000,000.
 But in the meantime there was no ostensible disposition to
 question the value of rapid population growth.   The Chinese
 reaction to mention of the problem by any member of the Brit-
 ish delegation was to shrug  it off indifferently.
 The first public appeal for birth control was in the
 nature of a trial balloon. The party still shied from espous-
 ing population limitation.  The call was sounded by Shao Li-
 tzu, a non-Communist "democratic personage," in September
 1954 at the First National People's Congress and again in a
 newspaper article the following December.   Shao tried man-
 fully to show that there was no contradiction between birth
 control practice and anti-Malthusian doctrine.
 Its extensive territory and huge population, said Shao,'
 made China a powerful nation.   But the past had left a legacy
 of backwardness which would take years to overcome.   In the
 meantime, there was a lack of educational facilities, and too
 many children meant that too many went without schooling. A
 further consideration was the danger to the health of mothers
 weakened by frequent childbirth.   Shao reached out for what-
 ever support he could find in the sacred texts and in Soviet
 practice.   Lenin, he observed, favored the annulment. of
 legislation that penalized the dissemination of birth control
 information.   And in the USSR, the sale of drugs for birth
 control "is not prohibited."
 In the China that had not yet experimented with "hundred
 flowers," it is probable that Shao Li-tzu made his proposals
 only after prior assurances from the authorities.  The un-
 publicized. 1953 directive to the Ministry of Public Health
 cited above showed the turn official thought was taking. And
 Shao disclosed that in July 1954, prior to his own public
 remarks, the Ministry had already submitted some birth con-
 trol proposals for approval by the Government Administration
 Council.

 The malt response to Shao Li-tzu's remarks was not uni-
 Cormly favorable.   It is pnssil)1.e that the pro and con dis-
 cussions which wore' allowed in 1954, and indeed in the years
 that followed, reflected uncertainties and disagreements at
 the top'leddership:   There was the customary display of mass
 participation in the attainment of consensus decided in the
 final analysis by the leadership, but there was considerable
 inconstancy in the characterization of correct and incorrect
 standpoints.   Shao originally opposed raising the age of mar-
 riage, for example; he later espoused the idea.  There were
 similar turnabouts before reaching settled positions on abor-
 tion and sterilization.
 Pending a crystallization of official doctrine, the par-
 ty continued to stay aloof from the issue.   Liu Shao-chi   '
 called a symposium on birth control in December 1954, and it
 was agreed that research groups on the subject would be or-
 ganized under the State Council.   But it was not until 1957
 that Liu's convocation of the symposium and the subsequent
 organization of the research groups were mentioned in the
 press.   In March 1955, a national party conference expressed
 the party's endorsement of birth control "to a certain ex-
 tent," but again the Communists did not publicize their action
 at the time.   Undecided on its interests in the matter, the
 leadership may have awaited general reaction at home,  (and
 perhaps official reaction in Moscow) before definitely arti-
 culating its own stand.
 Throughout most of this period, events went little beyond
 the examination and discussion of issues.   Beginning in 1955,
 however, instructional articles on contraceptive techniques
 appeared in party and semi-official journals.   The educational
 effort fell far short of a mass propaganda campaign, for the
 authorities still felt constrained to establish first the
 doctrinal legitimacy of population control.   Those who sought
 invariable guidance in Soviet practice were enjoined in Feb-
 ruary 1955 by China Youth (organ of the Young Communist League)
 to note that the USSR ecognized the practice of contracep-
 tion as a democratic right."  After the socialist economy had
 developed, the USSR had indeed "found it possible to...en?.
 courage the breeding of mo-e people," but even so, the Kremlin
 authorities did not ban contraception.
 Above all, the Communists were anxious to avoid the
 least imputation that they were borrowing from Malthus.

 The theoretical journal Study addressed itself with charac-
 teristic venom in October 3W 55 to unregenerates who now said,
 Kook.  The Communists too need Malthus no less than they
 need Marx."  Birth control, affirmed the journal,  "has nothing
 ht all in common with Malthus."  Personal and family consid-
 erations rather than the broader interests of state and society
 were emphasized as the reasons for smaller families.
 The c,tinpaign under way
 The campaign seemed unusually long in the making--re-
 flecting perhaps the indecision at the top--but by August
 1956, it was well under way.   The Ministry of Public Health'
 in that month issued a directive calling for technical guid-
 ance, training of cadres, and establishment of birth control
 clinics.   And at the eighth party congress in September, speak-
 ers came out unequivocally in support of family limitation. The
 old saws about protecting women. and children were repeated, but
 these probably never gave full satisfaction to the Communist
 ideologists, whose terms of reference were really social rather
 than individual.  Premier Chou En-lai indicated the nature of
 the social interest in his Report on the Proposals for the
 Second Five-Year Plan for Development of the National Economy.
 "We must understand," he said, "that in a country like ours
 where the economy is backward and the population is large,
 shortages of materials will occur frequently for a long time
 to come, whereas any surplus will be transient."  The'surplus
 that Chou sought was necessary for capital accumulation. The
 thesis had long been expressed in non-Communist circles; its
 invective against Malthus notwithdtanding, the party could
 only come up with a formulation that was cast pretty much in
 terms that were later to be characterized as neo-Malthusian.
 The ideology was unsatisfying but the bureaucracy was
 energized.   In the later months of 1956 and in 1957, the
 activists at local levels got into gear with promotional
 activities to popularize' birth control.   Illustrative posters
 and .Modd~ls,,?'-embatragsingly -graphic to some Western observers,
 illustrated contraceptive techniques.  Apothecaries featured
 large displays of birth control devices to the public.   Dis-
 cussion meetings, lantern slides, all the customary vehicles
 of mass propaganda were employed to bring the message  to the
 people.   Training programs in birth control were set up for

 cadres.   Clinics  to furnish information on the subject were
 established.   The method was persuasion; it was not politic
 ,it this stage to incorporate the elements of coercion commom
 to other nass movements.           But it was clear enough that popu-
 latt:ion limitation had become official policy.
 Hundred Flowers
 In the :first half of 1957, the birth control advocates
 in China advanced to highly exposed tin-Marxist positions--a
 development best understood in the context of the post-Stalin
 liberalization which Mao Tse-tung characteristically modified
 with his own Chinese accents.   In the spring of 1956, Mao is-
 sued his appeal to "let a hundred flowers bloom together, let
 a hundred schools of thought contend."  Communist commentary
 in the weeks that followed endeavored to convince the wary in-
 of permissible debate, if not of
 acceptable doctrine, would be sustantially enlarged.   True,
 freedom of thought would be confined "inside the camp of the
 people"; "only dialectical materialism is the truth," and de-
 bates would lead to the truth.   But the authorities seemed
 genuinely interested in evoking at least the display of more
 vigorous discussions.   The role of puppet parties in voicing
 the interests of the nonproletarian classes was emphasized.
 Intellectuals were assured that any fresh formulations in the
 natural sciences would not be labeled with the epithets feudal
 or capitalistic.   University curricula were broadened to al-
 low lectures on the philosophies of Hegel and Bertrand Russel,
 on Anglo-American law, on Keynesian economics.
 The intellectuals--cowed by earlier campaigns against
 nonconformity--at first declined the invitation to bare their
 necks.  Mao re-extended the invitation in his February 1957
 "secret" speech on contradictions, which distinguished be-
 tween antagonistic and nonantagonistic contradictions.   He
 stressed the nonantagonistic character of contradictions in
 present-day China and urged that these were best resolved by
 free discussion, not terror.  The edited version of the speech,
 which the Communists published in June, contained reservations
 which were not in the original; the effect of the original re-
 marks and of the extensive propaganda that followed was to
 elicit livelier debate than the authorities had counted on, A
 heated literary controversy attended the publication of a

 the discussions on population, the proponents ofbirth con-
 trol, both in and out of the party, were finally emboldened
 to elaborate their arguments along lines that were awkwardly
 near to Malthusian propositions.   The humanitarian grounds
 of mother and family welfare gave way to frankly economic
 considerations.
 The new tenor of the discussions was evident in the re-
 marks of ethnologist Wu Ching-ohao at a meeting of labor cadres
 in Peiping on 15 February.  The growth of population, said Wu,
 was outstripping the gains in employment.   There were 12,000,-
 000 more people in the population every year, some 6,000,000
 more in the labor force.  Only a million was being absorbed
 by industry.   It  "as impossible to open up enough new land
 to absorb the remainder in agriculture.
 Carrying the discussion to other ground, but with clear
 if unconscious affinity for neo-Malthusian logic, the China
 Youth Daily on 23 February observed that food production had
 increased 5 percent annually since 1949.   About a third of the
 increase, however, had gone simply to maintain existing stand-
 ards of consumption.   It was further noted that it had been
 necessary to divert output to such nonproductive outlays as
 creches, schools, and other facilities to care for the young.
 A symposium on birth-control convened by the authorities
 in Peiping on 20 February indicated the topic that would en-
 gross many of the delegates to the Chinese People's Political
 Consultative Conference in March.   The health of mothers re-
 ceived scant attention at the conference sessions; speakers
 dwelt rather on the need for birth control to cope with em-
 ployment problems, shortages of investment funds, and other
 economic difficulties.   Chung Hui-lan,  :superintendent of the
 Central People's Hospital in Peiping, sought to appall the
 delegates by the projection of a l0-billion-man China in 144
 years if the population increased by 2 percent annually; at
 3 percent, he warned, it would take only 96 years.    He dis-
 puted the view that virgin lands could take care of the pop-
 ulation increase.   He urged research to ascertain an optimum
 population size and an optimum rate of population growth for
 China.   It was clear in any event, he went on to say, that
 the population was growing too fast, and the birth rate should
 be brought down to the level of the death rate.  By 1972, he

 Chung Ilui-lap's views apparently reflected influential
 opinion in the party and government.   When the Minister of
 Public Irijalth addressed the delegates, she acknowledged that
 China was indeed an "overpopulated country."  Without birth con-
 trol, the country! Could not quickly becomer prosperous find string.
 The ministry, she said, Would relax earlier restraints on
 induced abortion and sterilization.  This announcement she
 made "with the greatest reluctance," in view of popular feel-
 ings on the subject.   In the milieu of "hundred flowers," a
 later speaker felt bold enough to voice his continued opposi-
 tion to abortion and sterili.,,,ation practices.
 Malthus' "moral restrain" against early marriage had an
 obvious appeal to some of the delegates.   The Marriage Law of
 1950 had set the minimum age of marriage for females at 18
 years of age, for males at 20 years.   (The comparable figures
 under the Nationalists had been 16 and 18.)   Li Chien-sheng
 expressed the conviction that "society should be made to fa-
 `or late marriages... the young boys should thus be ideolo ical-
 ly indoctrinated."                                                g
 Within and outside the sessions of the conference, the
 refrain "we are not Malthusians" was recurrent.   As the offi-
 cial People's Daily explained it in March, "pzoper" birth con-
 trol was  iame7trically opposed to Malthusianism; the Commu-
 nists wanted to accelerate the improvement of living standards
 not prevent their deterioration.  The admission that popula-
 tion increase had a depressant influence on living standards
 was in fact in the Maithusian rather than Marxian tradition.
 Yet  (or perhaps on that account), the disclaimers of Malthusian
 sympathies were vehement.
 Turnabout
 Liberation in China was over by the summer of 1957.   In
 hindsight, the intellectuals who took seriously the invitation
 to "let a hundred schools of thought contend" seem naive indeed.
 They had been wary enough at first, but once they found their
 tongues they began to let loose what Peiping was to describe
 as "frantic attacks" on the Communist system.   The Communist

 Disaffection at some schools culminatcd in student demonstra-
 tions and riots.
 The memory of Hungary was still fresh, and the regime
 felt impelled to launch a "life-and-death struggle" against
 the rightists."  Criticism,  the press affirmed, was a priv-
 ilege reserved to the people, not to enemies of the people.
 On the population question,  the Malthusian cast of some of
 the recent utterances was roundly condemned.   The category of
 "rightists," it was made clear, included all those who took
 the stand that a huge population meant a low rate of economic
 growth.   It was not admissible to sow such doubts about the
 possibility of building China into a strong socialist power.
 One research worker had gone so far, the indignant Communists
 averred, as to envision a situation in which China's burgeon-
 ing population brought a deterioration in well-being, whole-
 sale rioting by mothers, storming Of schools whose facilities
 were insufficient to accommodate all would-be entrants, and
 a desertiou of the land by rural youth frustrated by over-
 crowding.
 The changed climate discouraged further free examination
 and discussion of the population issue.  There could be no
 sympathy, according to an article published the Peoples Daily
 in October 1957, with those who took advantage of the popula-
 tion problem to bring assaults on the party and on socialism.
 The theory that overpopulation was a fundamental problem of
 society was an enemy weapon "to paralyze the revolutionary
 consciousness of the working class."  However, an editorial
 in another issue of the paper that month came out with a
 strong defense of birth control.   The editorial this time
 based its logic on the old familiar ground of family welfare.
 Evidently considering that this ground alone did not make for
 an entirely convincing argument, the daily acknowledged on
 1 February 1958 that population policy was based also on the
 limited capabilities of the national economy.   It was empha-
 sized, however, that these limitations- were transitory.   A
 large population in itself was by no means "absolutely a bad
 thing."

 The apprehensions about the resource-population balance
 which had induced the Communists to accept a birth control
 campaign in the beginning were evidently still strong. These
 antedated the period of "hundred flowers" and continued to
 suggest the wisdom of pursuing policies to curtail population
 growth.   It was too early for figures of the 1957 harvest, but
 the outlook in grains was for no significant increase over the
 previous year.
 So the discussion was pulled back from advanced stand-
 points, but the frank anatomical models remained on exhibi-
 tion.   Pictorial pamphlets on birth control were printed in
 quantity.   The cooperatives, women organizations, trade un-
 ions, and medical associations were all enlisted in the cam-
 paign to get the word to the masses.   At the Pugwash Confer-'
 ence in Nova Scotia in the spring of 1958, the Chinese Com-
 munist delegate presented a paper in which he expressed con-
 fidence that "within a reasonably short period  our  c   la-
 tion will become stationer .?'
 Effectiveness of the birth control campaign
 The difficulty in clarifying their theoretical position
 probably reflected the real reluctance with which the Commu-
 nists had approached the issue of population control in the
 first place.   Their promise had been to release productive
 energies that were stifled under the old society,   It was dis-
 appointing to have to admit--even with the excuse that the
 situation was temporary--that the release of energies would
 not quite cope with the consumption needs of a growing pop-
 ulation.   It is likely that the leadership was generally hope-
 ful that a surge forward in the economy would soon take place
 to vindicate Communist theses and permit progress under posi-
 tive rather than negative slogans.
 Perhaps because of this attitude, the Communists seem to
 have pushed the birth control bandwagon with something less
 than a full heart.   In 1956, birth control advocate Shao Li-
 tzu charged the propaganda was inadequate, and officials of
 the Ministry of Public ri,'alth made the same point.   In 1957,
 demographer Chen Ta declared, "I have great respect for the

 Whether a more forceful campaign would have elicited a
 much more positive response from the people is uncertain. As
 it happened, the campaign seems to have had no significant          ll
 effect on the birth rate.   Shao Li-tzu in 1956 commented on
 the widespread ignorance of birth control techniques that he
 found during an inspection trip in the countryside.   In 1957, another writer observed that the use of contrace

 was still mainly limited to government workers.   A People's
 Daily editorial at this time acknowledged, "Of course, we
 have to take fully into consideration the fact that the propaga-
 tion of birth control among the masses may meet with many dif-
 fi
 "
 culties.
 A European who visited China in September 1957
 had a difficult time finding a birth control clinic in the
 countryside.   At one collective farm, he asked the peasants
 whether they had heard anything about birth control; he was
 answered with uncomprehending states.   There is evidence that
 the Communists did get around eventually to bringing the mes-
 sa-e to much of the countryside, where contraceptives were
 offerer,  or sale.   "Very few people used them," was the typical
 remark of peasants to Western interviewers.
 Leap forward
 Given the anti-Malthusian tradition and the Communist
 faith in the high productive potential of a socialist society,
 it was perhaps inevitable that the birth control campaign
 would slacken once the faith seemed close to vindication.   By
 the summer of 1958, the "leap forward" was in full trajectory,
 and the leadership was confident that the extraordinarily am-
 bitious economic targets it had set for the country would be
 realized in the main.   As it turned out, they were generally
 realized in industry while falling far short of realization
 in agriculture.   But in both sectors, there was indeed a
 genuine leap not merely in the economic aggregates but in
 per capita achievements as well.
 The leap forward movement set out to demonstrate that
 miracles of production could be achieved if China's manpower

 wore properly organized and inspired.   What amounted to labor
 armies were sot lip for water conservancy and other :.'oral proj-
 ects.   In the countryside, primitive industrial plants were
 introduced that would, with a minimum of capital investment,
 occupy the vast pool of underemployed peasantry.   The newly
 organized communes enlarged the size and areas of akricultural
 enterprises and permitted the ready transfer of farm labor
 from project to project with a minimum of idle time.   Beth in
 city and on farm, the hortatory slogans (e.g. "Catch up with
 Britain in 15 years") aimed to raise the popular tolerance for
 long overtime hours and speed-up techniques.
 Not all the energy was transformed into matter. But de-
 termined to get all hands occupied, the Communists at times
 found an insufficiency of hands for all the :-.activites they
 introduced--deep plowing, sparrow killing, backyard steel
 furnaces.   The apparent labor shortages were sometimes cited
 in support of the thesis that China needed more Ltather than
 fewer people.   "Because of careful cultivation and tilling,
 the need for manpower has been doubled," averred the People's
 Daily.
 The objective of Communist planning during the leap for-
 ward year of 1958 was "to bring into play the activism and
 creativeness of the broad working masses."  The theoretical
 journal Study in Mar
 h 1958
 c
 published Po I-po's strictures
 against the 'rreverse effects" induced by conservatism in plan-
 ning, by uncourageous striving for "b9lance."  The times were
 no longer encouraging for those who were still concerned with
 the population-resource-balance.   Birth control advocates had
 to guard against the "reverse effects" of their cautionary
 statements.   They must on no account depress the modd of the
 Peking University students, whose wall newspapers affirmed
 that "if they are adequately mobilized and organized, the 600,-
 000,000 people will emit inexhaustible light and heat such as
 are released during a nuclear explosion...a large population
 is net a stumbling stone to the progress of science, but on
 the contrary, a tremendous force."                  -

 gime's birth control policy as a decision to h

 hygiene, political study.   When a campaign is under way, you
 are not allowed to forget it for an hour.   All the mass media
 harn;ner the point away unkelentingly.   "But this was not now
 the case with family planning."  The poster exhibitions had a
 neglected appearance; the crowds were uninterested.   The re-
 sponse of those Chinese he queried was, "Of course the campaign
 continues, but it has not been a great success."
 As the ideologists worked it out, the proper standpoint
 now was one which stressed that the population problem in
 China was not basic, that the economy could in fact support
 ma'.zy times the present 650,000,000, but that birth control
 was nevertheless an appropriate policy for a planned society.
 The position was most explicitly set forth by Shu  hung, writ-
 ing:in People's Daily on 6 June 1958 and in the July Peking
 Review.    ~e Fater~of  population increase in our country,"
 said Shu proudly, "is the highest..in the world, and itsipop-
 ulation is also the largest in the world."  By the end of the
 Second Five-Year Plan in 1962, he foresaw a Chinese population
 in excess of 700,000,000.  Five years later, it would approach
 800,000,000. But the hlalthusians were being disproved by
 events; industry and agriculture were being developed at un-
 precedentec; speed.
 This does not mean, continued Shu, that the regime would
 allow population to grow "in a blind, uncontrolled way."  On
 the contrary, population increase would be planned just like
 the other variables; of the economy.   In time, Shu was con-
 fident, the populace would be highly responsi?'e to the demo-
 graphic ?cargets set by the regime.   "With culture and scienti-
 fic knov,ledge spreading on a mass scale, the prospect is that
 planned birth will be progressively understood and accepted
 by the people."
 As the matter stands now, the practice of bi,tth control
 has official sanction.  The means are available to those who
 want them and can afford to buy them.   But the leadership,
 exhilarated by the agricultural and industrial advances of the
 last two years, is apparently unwilling to return to birth
 control as an active propaganda theme until the economic growth
 curve  shows  : signs of flattening.

 IV.  POSITIONS OF TIII  PARTY LEADERS
 Chinose Communist statements, about population have been
 hi,;?hly,  although not perfectly,  correlated with the character
 of economic, programs in force or under consideration.  The
 ::~tcp-up of birth control propaganda from late 1956 to mid-1957
 coincided with    a  osriod of concern over the strains attending
 tho 1956 "u?psurge" and with the subsequent "ebb tide" in 1957.
 Conversely, the slackening of birth control propagnda since
 1958 has been associated with "leap forward" targeting in
 agriculture and inudstry.   On a priori grounds,  it seems prob-
 able that advocates of comparatively moderate economic programs
 (e.g., Chen YUn, Li Fu-chun, perhaps Po I-po) would be most
 disposed to favor measures to limit population increase.  Those
 who are more congenial to ambitious targeting (e.g., Liu Shao-
 ch:i, Tong I-Isiao-ping, Tan Chen-lin) would, on the same ground,
 seem likely to prefor a muting of birth control propaganda and
 a stress on the economy's ability to advance faster than the
 rate of population growth.
 The record bears out the a priori judgment broadly, but
 not perfectly.  The record is complicated by the fact that
 leaders in both groups have shown some appreciation of the
 population problem, speaking out with varying degrees of frank-
 ness on some occasions but inclining generally to silence on
 the subject since 1958.  The review of individual positions
 presented below suggests that there may indeed have been some
 debates on the population question within the politburo but
 that all the Communists at this level approached the issue
 discreetly.   If a split should occur eventually in the leader-
 ship,              it is possible indeed that the contending group will
 cite "errors" of viewpoint on the population question.   It
 seems likely, however, that the charges and countercharges will
 revolve primarily around issues on which the Chinese leaders
 have spoken out with more conviction than on population.
 Mao Tse-tung
 The utterances of Mao on the population question are re-
 flective of the party's generally ambivalent attitude on the
 subject--reluctance to appear defeatist about the economy's
 ability to keep pace with population increase, coupled with
 uneasiness at the magnitudes that 2.5 percent compounded an-
 nually ultimately come to.   As the undisputed leader of the

 party,  Mao could readily have squelched the regime's birth
 control propaganda that had its beginnings in 1954, that
 reached its full flower in 1957, and that reappears occasionally
 even in i:he period of leap forward.   Clearly he condoned if
 lie did not endorse the propaganda.   His own public statements
 evidence an evolution of attitude that has not yet fully formed.
 He has of course been unequivocally hostile to sugges-
 tions that the Communists Might prove unequal to the task of
 supporting the over-expanding population.    A Red Flag article
 in June 1958 recalled Mao's reaction in 1049 to Dean Acheson's
 allusions to overpopulation in China.   "Among all things on
 earth," said Mao,  "man is the most precious.   Under the leader-
 ship of  'he Communist party, all miracles can be created so
 long as there are men.  We refute Acheson's reactionary theory.
 We believe that revolution can change all things.   A new
 China with a vast population, rich rescurces, well-off liveli-
 hood, and flourish.    culture will materialize before long.
 All pessimistic views are utterly groundless."
 In the liberalization period of early 1957, Mao apparently
 took a more definitive stand, but again the evidence is not
 firsthand.   Birth control proponent Chung  Hui-Ian, speaking
 at the sessions of the Chinesee People's Political Consultative
 Conference in March 1957, alluded to "the wise directive of
 Chairman Mao concerning the need of planned birth control to
 regulate the population of China."  The details of the direc-
 tive were not described, and Mao himself apparently recoiled
 from the spotlight.
 The reference to Mao"s "wise directive" may be an allu-
 sion to remarks made ii his "secret speech" on contradictions
 in February 1957.  A version of the speech which circulated
 SF'ruFT

 in Warsaw had it that Mao onlarged upon the problems that at-
 tended too rapid population growth and that he strongly
 advocated limitations on the size of families.  The edited
 version of the speech released in June, after liberalization
 had run its course,  omitted this and other statements which
 Polish revisionists had found so appealing.  As the official
 version of the speech put it, Mao made no statement favoring
 birth control.   He did concede that China's large population
 gave rise to some "difficulties," but he was critical of those
 who resisted efforts to turn "negative factors into positive
 ones."  More explicitly, he chided those who argued that "the
 fewer the people...the better."
 As far as the open record goes then, Mao (and the party
 along with him) has shied from close identification with the
 proponents of population limitation.   His off-the-record re-
 marks reflect some awarenenss of demographic realities, but'
 he does not seem fully persuaded that an all-out birth control
 campaign would be opportune now, however necessary it may
 become later.
 Liu Shao-chi
 During "hundred flowers" in early 1957, the Chinese press
 divulged the fact that I,iu Shao-chi had convened a symposium
 on birth control back in December 1954.   He has thus evinced
 an interest in the question of population limitation, but he
 is not on record as supporting birth conrtol in public state-
 ments.                       The issue is possibly one that is not fully resolved

 s own mind and on which differences of view within the
 party are admissible in accordance with the principles set
 forth in his 1941 article on ",C?onflicts in the Party."  As Liu
 stated it, if after full discussion "a minority of comrades

 As one of the chief doctrinaires, he has probably been
 most concerned about maintaining the purity of the party's
 position against Malthus and neo-Malthusians.  At the second
 session of the eighth party congress in May 1958, Liu leveled
 his sharpest criticism at the pessimistic scholars who "argued
 that as the population grows, consumption will increase. and
 there won't be much of an increase in accumulation."  Their
 views, said liu, "go counter to Marxism-Leninism."  The great

 forward leap "has not only completely knocked the bottom out
 of their contention that agriculture cannot make quick progress
 but also blown sky high their argument that a big population :i.
 impedes accumulation."
 The plausible surmise is that Liu, along with Mao and
 probably the majority of the leaders,  is appreciative of the
 race between economic growth and population increase.   Deep-
 rooted Communist that he is, he has a strong predilection for
 emphasis on methods that promise to accelerate economic growth.
 But,   to borrow a slogan that the rgime now employs in another
 context,  Liu would acknowledge that it is best to advance by
 "walking on two legs" and would not reject out of hand ap of--
 fort to curb the birth rate.   He would simply disavow formula-
 tions on the population issue that call into question the poten-
 tial for economic growth or seem likely to dampen the popular
 ardor to realize this potential.   If forced to the choice, he
 would perhaps say that it is better to leap forward on one leg

 regions into cultivation.      Chou also mentioned the birth con-

 in the fall of 1955.   Chou 25X1

 Peiping were in the same vein.   Population was a problem but
 one which the Communists were confident they could handle.
 Again, Chou alluded to the reclamation of waste lands and the
 actvities to promote birth control.
 Interviewed by a Indian visitor in the summer of 1956,
 Chou is said to have used the word "overpopulated" in dis-
 cussing the bond of common interests between India and China.
 A few months -later, he told                              that China

 At the eighth party congress in September 1956, Chou
 spoke in favor of a "reasonable amount" of birth contrcl.   He
 declared that there must be frequent shortages of materials
 and only transient surpluses in a backward economy like China's
 where "the population is large"--a presentation from which a
 more meticulous ideologist like Liu Shao-chi would probably
 have shied as bordering on un-Marxist pessimism.   It is poste
 sible that Chou at this time was indeed more susceptible than
 Liu to the influences of Ma Yin-chu and other neo-Malthusians
 (by Communist designation), who belabored the paint that rapid
 population growth impeded the accumulation of surpluses for
 capital investment.   Ma has alluded to a personal friendship
 with Chou, and it was through Chou's influence that Ma is said
 to have obtained release from a Nationalist jail duriL,g World
 War II.
 It would be easy to overanalyze the differences between
 Chou En-lai and Liu Shao-chi on the population issue.   Chou
 has been somewhat less guarded in his remarks, but these were
 made in a period when the regime's interest in birth control
 was more avowed than it is today.   When he spoke,  it was in
 the general tenor of the party line at the time, which Mao
 and Liu may have had more to do with setting than Chou.   He
 is not on record recently as speaking in the vein of 1956.
 On population, as well as other issues generally, Chou seems
 to fall in gracefully with the party line of the moment.
 Others of the inner circle
 In addition to the three discussed above, the topmost
 echelon known as the Standing Committee of the Politburo in-
 cludes Chu Te, Chen Yun, Lin Piao, and Teng Hsiao-ping.
 .Evidence on the attitudes of these men is-scanty.   As a
 group, they presumably approved the regime's birth control
 propaganda.   Individually, they adhered to a circumspect
 taciturnity in their public comments, however vocal some may
 have been in the secret Standing Committee discussions.
 The record of Chu Te on the subject is a blank.   If he
 has any convictions at all,  they would possibly be shaped by
 his military bent; Chinese military doctrine still attaches
 great.importance to size of armies.  As Chief of Staff Su Yu
 worded it in 1957, "It must be admitted that nuclear weapons
 have the destructive power to kill huge numbers of people, but
 they cannot achieve the object of occupation and less still

 the object of subjugation....In the end, the deciding factor

 It is plausible to deduce that the Chinese marshals, like
 their military counterparts the world over, are uneasy about
 programs to limit the population.   Framing their values in
 terms of national power rather than individual welfare, military
 man tend to associate declining populations with social decadence
 and expanding populations with national vigor.   In this line of
 -thinking the marshals are of course not alone, but are in agree-.
 merit with many civilian statesmen who aspire to great power
 status for their countries.   Sun Yat Sen (whose position on
 thrr population issue was not consistent over the years) took
 alarm on one occasion when estimates seemed to show that China's
 population was declining.  Apprehensive that such a develop-
 ment would lessen the chances for China's restoration to
 great power standi:.g, he declared:
 About', century Ago, France,-: acting on?,thes:belief
 that she had already reached the blalthusian limit,
 began to practice family limitation.   Today,  the
 French people are reaping the painful effects of
 a declining population and are encouraging the in--
 crease of numbers to ensure France's permanent place
 among the nations of the world.   Nowadays in China,
 some young men are also influenced by Malthusianism
 and commence to control births.
 The other marshal in the Standing Committee,  Lin Piao,
 made only rare appearances (probably because of illness) between
 1953 and 1959.   There is thus no record of his attitude during
 the years when the Chinese Communists were frankest on the
 birth control issue.  A man whose outlook is decidedly military,
 he pr-,-sumably shares with Chu Te and other marshals some
 sense of disquiet about measures to limit population s:ze.
 This is a judgment, however, which rests wholly on grounds of
 plausibility rather than evidence.

 Clion Yun, who has loaned to comparative moderation in
 economic planning, attaches considerable importance to the
 maintenance of living standards.   A statement ascribed to him
 in June 1957 had it that "we must first make arrangements for
 the people's livelihood, second those for production, and
 las t those for capital construction."  The aprangeinents for
 the people's livelihood he evidently thought would be compli-
 cated by too rapid population growth, for his report on the
 state of the economy in March 1957 included the observation
 that "a large population and a high rate 'of consumption are
 the diffiuclties in our economic life."
 His most explicit statement on birth control was made in
 September 1957 before the Third National Congress of Chinese
 Women:'
 In order to protect the health of women and children,
 to improve conditions for the rearing of children,
 to improve family.;life, and to speed up socialist
 construction, we will continue the promotion pf planned
 childbirth on a nationwide scale--excluding areas
 of the national minorities.   This implies promotion
 for the ddoption of planned childbirth among the
 broad masses of people according to their own wishes
 and circumstances.
 Chen's phrasing was in harmony with that of the Corm unists
 generally at the time.   He may in private have gone further
 and conceded validity to the formulations of Ma Yin-chu and
 the other "neo-Malthusians," but the point is speculative.
 Some of his comments in December 1956--supporting trade in
 "free markets" and production by private enterprise in "secret
 workshops"--do suggest a susceptibility to economic as distinct
 from purely doctrinaire arguments.
 The seventh man of the standing Committee, Secretary
 General Teng Hsiao-ping, delivered the preliminary report on
 the completion of the census to the Governmqnt Administration
 Counbil in 1954.   He offered no interpreti?a commentary apart
 from expressions of pride in the quality of the census work.
 He has taken positions clearly opposed to Chen Yun's on economic
 issues such as free markets and blandestine factories, and the
 inference--but not firm conclusion--would be that Teng has
 stronger reservations about birth control than Chen.   A man
 whose record shows a partiality to "upsurge" and "leap for-
 ward," Teng would share something of Liu Shao-chi's attitude:
 grudgingly accepting perhaps that population limitation was
 necessary in practice but seeing a deleterious negativism in
 the birth control arguments.

 Other politburo members
 In the case of 'host other politburo members, there are
 no public statements to indicate how they feel on the popu-
 lation issue.   Inferential judgments of their positions can
 bo drawn on the basis of their group affiliations or gen+Dral
 social outlooks (as was done with Chu To,  Lin Piao, and Teng
 Usiao-ping above).   The remarks that follow will be confined
 to. the few individuals on whom the evidence is direct or
 reasonably circumstantial.
 Li Fu-chun, Chairman of the State Planning Commission, is
 credited with a sober appreciation of the economic realities.
 He is also, however, alive to the political realities, and his
 views on the population question have been car~?fully phrased
 to accord with the prevailing party line.
 Insofar as personal associations are indicative, it might
 be noted in passing that Li's wife, Tsai Chang,  is a fairly
 high-ranking party official in her own right (head of the
 Women's Work Committee of the Central Committee) and is on
 record as saying in September 1955 that the party favored
 birth control "to a certain extent."  Li himself, speaking to
 the All-China Congress of Trade Unions in December 1957, called
 China'?s population a great asset but acknowledged that "of
 course there are bound to be difficulties."  As he put it,
 "With a big population... there will be certain limitations on
 the growth of our financial and material resources for some
 years."
 In his Red Flag article of October 1959 "On 'the Big
 Leap Forward,   Lj's emphasis was entirely the other way.   Man,
 as he now explained,  is society's most precious asset.   With
 the elimination of capita.ist exploitation,  it had become
 possible to bring into full play the strength of more than 600,-
 000,000 people.                          He criticized those with "right opportunist"
 ideas who looked on China's big population as a heavy burden
 which prevented rapid economic advance.
 Financial expert Li Hs.ien-nien is cast in pretty much the
 same mold as Li Fu-chun.   In September 1957, Li Hsien-nien was
 sufficiently impressed with the population problem to observe
 that "agricultural production falls behind the people's needs."
 In February 1958, on the other hand, he of course saw leap for-
 ward as "entirely possible."  The two Lis are obviously both

 practical politicians, and their inner convictions are only
 imperfectly reflected in their public statements.   Experts in
 economic arithmetic, the two seem reasonably sensitive to the
 problem of population growth in China.
 Tan Chen-lin has in recent years replaced the more moderate
 Teng Tzu-hui as the regime's spokesman on agricultural policy.
 Apparently anxious to extract the largest possible amount for
 the regime from the countryside, Tan has been particularly
 critical of those who took it upon themselves to deplore the
 low living standards of the peasants.   In a People's Daily
 article of 5 May 1957, he- decried the "super  c a  comparison"
 that showed peasant earnings to be less than urban wages.   The
 thought may have occurred to Tan that a population limitaton
 program would alsc serve to increase the amount of grapin that
 could be taxed or bought at artifically low prices by the regime,
 for he conceded that "China is overpopulated.'.'  Tan did not
 go on record as an individual in favor of birth control, but
 Abe has associated himself with the.rggime's policy on the
 subject as set forth,in the Draft 12-Year Agricultural Program.
 He submitted the program for official approval on two seaparate
 occasions:.  The first in September 1957 to the central commit-
 tee and the second in April 1960 to the National People's
 Congress.   Section 29 of the program contained the pertinent
 statement on birth control.
 With the exception of the minority nationalities
 areas, birth control should be publicized and
 popularized in all densely populated areas.   Family
 planning should be promoted to prevent the develop-
 ment of excessivly haavy burdens on families and
 to enable children to receive better education and
 have better employment opportunities.
 The draft program had been first formulated in January
 1956, and it is uncertain that Tan had much of a hand in the
 wording of all the provisions--in particular the section on
 birth control.   In view of his official preoccupation with
 rural problems, however, Tan would perhaps be more disposed
 than other ardent leap forward proponents to concede some
 merit to population limitation arguments.   In the opinion of
 the US Consulate General in Hong Kong, Tan's speech to the
 National People's Congress in 1960 "betrayed an undertone of
 uneasiness.. and some doubt as to whether sheer manpower alone
 will be enough to meet production needs."

 Among the alternate members of the politburo, propagandist
 and party theoretician Chen Po-ta--long a spokesman for J1Iao--
 has been the most explicit on the population question.   His
 formulations are wholly anti-Malthusian.   Speaking to the
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in February
 1956, he :fumed at "Malthus' preposterous theory of overpopulation. "J
 There was,  in fact, no sign of overpopulation, he asserted.
 There was,  he conceded, a food question, which would be solved
 by the transformation of agriculture from individual to coopera-
 tive organizational forms.
 The ling-up
 If any significant point emerges from a review of polit-
 buro members' views on the population issude, it is that all
 have taken fairly safe positions,  at least as far as their  .
 public statements go.   People's Daily and other party publi-
 cations have gone into far more  a tail in discussions of the
 issue than any of the major leaders.   The ostensible protag-
 onists in the debates have been non-party or lesser party
 figures.   If there is any line of division at the politburo
 level, it does not seem to divide zealous proponents from
 opponents of birth control.  The encouragement of birth control
 is official policy, and no one speaks against it.
 Some are,  however, more disposed to speak for it than
 others.   The theoreticians of the party--Mao Tse-tung,  Liu
 Shao-chi, Teng Hsiao-ping, Chen Po-ta--all or almost all must
 have supported the decision to inaugurate a birth control
 campaign.   Liu Shao-chi, for one, and perhaps some of the
 others as well, even took some personal initiative to get
 the camaign under way.   But as a group,  they are distinguished
 by a clear reluctance to make individual statements that would
 in the least seem to compromise their uncorrupted Marxism.
 The government administrators, particularly those with
 economic outlooks--Chou En-lai,  Chen Yun, Li Fu-chun, Li
 lisien-nien, for example--have been more disposed to make
 personal statements that explicitly or implicitly favor birth
 control.  This was done only when the regime was pushing birth
 most actively.   When the life went out of the birth iuntroi
 most campaign--even though i  Leruained official policy--the
 government administrators, like the party theoreticians, called
 atteiltioii 'to the virtiie-s 'of: a,:'large p'opu'lation. - , .

 The military figures in the politburo have kept their
 tongues.   Because of misgivings on the presumed effect of
 population limitation on national power,  they are probably
 no more enthusiastic about birth control than the party
 doctrinaires.   But their record is not indicative of strong
 opinions on the question.
 In sum,  the leaders have differed in degrees of enthusiasm
 (or, better said,  lack of enthusiasm) rather than convictions.
 The task may not so much be to resolve differences among the
 leaders as to settle on a satisfactory and satisfying theoreti-
 cal position.   In the meantime, all must couch their utterances
 in carefully guarded phrases.

 V.   POPULATION DOCTRINE AND THE SINO-SOVIET RELATIONSHIP
 Chinese Communist theoreticians fool bound to develop
 propositions that are broadly acceptable to Communists abroad
 no well as at home.  Some foreign Communists are of course
 more equal than others; the Russian nod in particularly im-
 portant.  When vital interests of national policy are involved,
 however, or when the immodest desire to assert a doctrinal
 authority equal to Moscow's is not contained, Peiping has
 taken theoretical stances at odds with the Kremlin's : witness
 the dissonance over contradictions, over communes, and over
 global strategy.   Since the doctrinal issues have their bear-
 ing on the solidarity of the Sino-Soviet relationship, it is
 in order to examine the Kremlin's reaction to Peiping's
 treatment of the population question.
 Marx and Malthus
 The Communist impatience with "population explosion"
 propositions is long-standing.  As Malthus presented his
 theory--that population tends to increase faster than the
 available food supply--the phenomenon of mass pov,rty
 transcended the particular social order.  He advanced a
 proposition that was held to be true whatever the reformers
 did about the Poor Laws, whatevever the revolutionaries did
 about feudalism and capitalism.   T  Marx, the Malthusian
 theory was sheer apologia for the status quo, and he reacted
 with the venom that has become so characteristic of Communist
 polemics., Malthus was not merely wrong but, dishonest:
 Malthus was altogether a plagiarist by profession.
 One has only to compare the first edition of his work
 on population with the work by the Reverend Townsend
 to become convinced that he does not use the latter
 as raw material, as an independent producer would,
 but that he copies and paraphrases him, like a slavish
 plagiarist although he nowhere mentions him, keeping
 his existence a secret.
 When he brought the argument from ad hominem to
 substantive grounds, Marx took the position that there was
 no absolute law of population that was valid for all

 societies.   If there was in his day a surplus of workers, the
 overpopulation was relative.   The apparent manpower surplus
 was not merely a derivative of the capitalist order; it was
 the very essential of a viable capitalism, constituting the
 "Industrial reserve army" that forced the workers to accept
 less, than the value of their production.   As Marx saw it,
 the situation became progressively worse for the masses
 under capitalism.   His abstruse argument made the demand for
 labor dependent on the supply of "variable capital," which
 tended with time to fall relative to the magnitude of fixed
 capital.   The outcome was for the laboring population to
 become "relatively superflous. "
 The threads of Marx's arguments are never easy to follow;
 the relevant point for this study is mainly that he conceded
 no validity to the Malthusian theory, either as an explanation
 of poverty under capitalism or of the limitations on progress
 under socialism.   It is possible that he took so uncompromis-
 ing a stand on tactical rather than logical grounds.   The
 ends of the class struggle would hardly be served by con-
 ceding merit to an argument that seemed to him in the main
 so hostile to revolutionary aspirations.   Viewing the po-
 ten?;:ials of a socialist society as some optimists today
 anticipate the effects of dramatic technological break-
 throughs, Marx possibly felt like them that "population ex-
 plosion" arguments were trivial for the present (if not
 harmful), however pertinent they might become for the con-
 ditions of a later era.
 He did not consider it useful to elaborate on the future.
 But inwardly he may have realized that population could not
 go on expanding forever.   It would not go on expanding
 forever, he intimated at one point, under the civilizing
 effects of the socialist order.   The high fertility of the
 proletariat was evidence of the degrading effects of capi-
 talism; he saw an analogy to the fecundity of those animals
 that are preyed upon by other species.
 Engels was no less hostile to Malthus, and for the same
 reason.   In 1844, he affirmed that population pressed, not
 against the means of subsistence, but against the means of
 employment.   In other words, capitalism set limits to popula-
 tion growth that fell short of the strictly technological
 capabilities of society.   Like Marx, Engels apparently
 advanced his argument mainly to discredit Malthus, not as a
 statement of the ultimate Communist position on the population

 question.   Nearly 40 years later,  in a :lottor'to Kautsky, he
 wrote niche -frankly:
 If, at some stage, communist society finds itself
 obliged to regulate the production of human beings,          U.

 tion of things, it will be precisely this society,
 and this society alone, which can carry it out with-
 out difficulty.
 (h several. occas.jons,' Chinese have alluded to this remark of
 Engels' as doctrinal justification for the birth control
 campaign.   In general, the Chinese approached the matter
 with due respect for the sacred texts.   They were duti-
 fully hostile to Malthus and sought support for birth control
 in postulates (health of mothers, etc.) which were largely
 specious but acceptable on Marxist grounds.   The Chinese
 understood that the situation had a certain delicacy.  Apart
 from a few loose statements made during the liberalization
 period of early 1957, they tried earnestly to express their
 doctrine and policy in a manner that would not give offense
 even to strict constructionists in the Kremlin or elsewhere.
 The Soviet Viewpoint
 Two considerations shaped the early Russian formulations
 on the population question.  First, it was incumbent on
 party spokesmen to reject Malthus, to adhere firmly to the
 Mar:cist standpoint that the revolutionary upsurge of energies
 under Communism could be counted on to provide for all.
 Second, it was mandatory to criticize the man-dominated
 family, to favor the emancipation of women.   If contraceptive
 practices furthered this second objective, it was necessary
 to make clear that they were not condoned because of any
 apprehensions about over-all population growth.   "We are
 unconditional opponents of neo-Malthusianism," said Lenin,
 but "this does not prevent us in the slightest from demanding
 the abolition of all laws which place penalities either upon
 abortion or upon the circulation of medical writings dealing
 with methods of preventing conceptions or similar laws."
 Soon after the revolution, abortion waG legalized, the
 sale of contraceptives authorized, and the laws on family re-

 lationships made extremely liberal by Western standards.
 Divorce, for example, was readily granted on the request
 of either party.   The quantitative effect of these enact-
 ments on the birth rate is indeterminate, but the general
 encouragement for women to fulfill their roles outside the
 traditional home -tended presumably to reduce the size of
 families.   The grounds, however, were feminist, not Malthusian.
 As was to be the case in China some 30 years later, the
 new sanctions for birth control for a time emboldened a
 few academicians to advance neo-Malthusian concepts.   This
 limited license was ended under Stalin.   In the middle 1930s,
 there was a tide of denunciation against the expositions that
 showed any sign of Malthusian taint; Soviet demographers
 elaborated the propositon that fertility decline was
 associated with a decaying society.  On the legislative and
 administrative fronts, abortions were first restricted a ' d
 then forbidden entirely except on medical and eugenic grounds.
 No further effort was made to promote contraceptive practices.
 With a new emphasis on the virtues of the socialist family,
 the Communists adopted measures to make divorce more difficult.
 Financial assistance to mothers was extended.   Maternity and
 nursery facilities were enlarged.
 It is likely that Stalin's apprehensions of a shift in
 the European power balance to the detriment of Russian
 national interests was a key factor in the turn of Soviet
 population policy.   The apprehension was made all the more
 acute after the accession of the Nazis to power and their
 institution of measures to encourage rapid population growth
 in Germany.  Against this background, Stalin probably viewed
 with deep misgiving the precipitate drop in the Russian birth
 rate during the preceding ten years (from perhaps 45 per
 thousand to some 30 per thousand).  Another consideration
 was the "excess mortality" of the period (deaths may have
 exceeded births in number during some the the years) arising
 from famine, undeclared civil war in the villages, and other
 consequences of the forced collectivization and hasty
 industrialization.

 If Stalin associated the long-range maintenance of
 the USSR's power position with demographic factors, the
 c!ffects  of World War II must have given him further dis-
 tress.                        The separation of soldiers from their wives cut
 sharply into the birth rate, and the heavy losses at the
 front of men of marriageable age seemed likely to have a
 depressant effect on births for several years after the
 war ended.   The result was the enactment of measures de-
 sif;ned to promote female interest in childbearing.
 The elaborate system of awards set up in 1944 stip-
 ulated a range of honorifics for mothers with five children
 on up:   Motherhood Medal (First and Second Class); Order
 of Glory of Motherhood (First, Second, and Third Class);
 and Order of Mother Heroine  (Gold Star), with Scroll from
 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.   The
 financial allowances to mothers were  most liberal (they
 had to be cut back later), ranging up to 5,000 rubles up-
 on the birth of the 11th child and 3,600 rubles annually
 for a certain number of years thereafter.  As a further
 inducement to childbearing, discriminatory taxation was
 levied on men and women with fewer than three  chil-
 dren.
 The post-Stalin era brought a modification but not
 reversal of Soviet outlook on the population question.
 Khrushchev,  like the Soviet demographers of Stalin's
 day, associates an expanding population with a vigorous
 society.   Speaking to Komsomol members in January 1955,
 he warned, "if each family has only one or two children,
 the population of the country will not grow but will be
 on the decline.   And we must think about the develop-
 ment of society."
 Unlike Stalin, however, the more recent leadership
 seems disposed to recognize the humanistic considarations

 that impelled Lenin to approve such measures as the legal-
 ization of abortions in the 1920s.   Criminal sanctions
 against pregnant women who procured abortions were discon-
 tinued in 1954.   The remvining prohibitions against abor-
 tions were repealed in 1955.   It is difficult to evaluate
 quantitiatively the effect on the birth rate of these en-
 actments, which to some extent merely legalized what 'as

 the USSR in 1957, abortions ranged from 30 to 85 per-
 cent of live births in individual hospitals.
 After the birth control campaign got well under way
 in Communist China, statements in Soviet media favoring
 contraception seemed to increase somewhat--whether by co-
 incidence, in sympathy, or possibly in competition with
 some of the Chinese propaganda is not clear.   In the mid-
 dle of 1957, Soviet doctors were urging the establishment
 of speipal women's clinics to give birth control advice.
 They also advocated pamphlets and posters on cont

 and an expanded supply of contraceptives.   Later in the
 year, the Soviet Minister of Health urged "serious scienti-
 fic researt;h to discover new contraceptives" since the
 widespread practice of abortion tended to promote gynecol-
 ogical disease.   A Moscow broadcast in July 1958 to South-
 east Asia was critical of a French demographic journal for
 the statement that Marxists opposed birth control propa-
 ganda.  The Soviet state did indeed encourage a high birth
 rate, but individuals were free to choose; contraceptives
 were available in any chemist's shop and freely advertised
 in the medical journals.   It was necessary to oppose the
 "anti-scientific and reactionary" theory of Malthus, but
 this was not to preclude "a realistic and truly humane
 policy on the question of population  under  socialism."

 In Summary,  Soviet population policy and commentary
 under the post-Stalin leadership took a turn which reduced
 the room for doctrinal controversy with China.  Had Stalin
 lived,  it is possible that Peiping's birth control campaign
 would have occasioned greater distress to the Kremlin, for
 the blatant pro-natalist line of his time suppressed the
 fo.minist and humanistic considerations that were modifying
 influences under Lenin.   But as Khrushchev apparently viewed
 Chinese population doctr th  and policy, they called for no
 comment from Moscow.  The Chinese were obviously more con-
 cerned about population growth in China than a good Commu-
 nist would be about population growth in the USSR.  While
 the Russians condoned birth control, the Chinese advocated
 and encouraged it.  The differences of attitude and approach
 made perhaps for some awakwardness, but they did not oc-
 casion the snide comments from top Soviet officials that
 were engendered by other Chinese doctrinal initiatives, e.g.,
 on contradictions and communes.  Basic to the preservation
 of accord was Peiping's scrupulousness in seeking grounds
 for birth control that were by and large in harmony with
 current rationales in Moscow.
 The East European experience
 There remains still another indication of Soviet dis-
 inclination to take issue with Peiping's handling of its
 population question:   the USSR acquiesces in the population
 limitation measures adopted in other bloc capitalis.  Warsaw
 has taken a particularly advanced position.   With the highest
 birth rate on the European continent next to Albania, Poland
 came to the decision in the middle 1950s that a cutback in
 the rate of population growth was essential both to maximize
 the amount of funds that could be directed into investments
 and to avoid a deterioration of per capita incomes.   In April
 1956, the Polish Sejm legalized abortions under certain con-
 ditions.   In January 1960, abortions were authorized virtual-
 ly at the will of the applicant.  The sole requirement was
 a simple declaration by the woman that "she is in particularly
 difficult material conditions justifying interruption of
 pregancy."
 By 1958, a Birth Control Association and planned parent
 hood centers had been established in the country.  The propa-
 ganda took on strong antireligious overtones. In August 1958,,_

 for example, the party daily T_rybuna Ludu carried a long
 article which charged the clergy with encouraging believers
 to break the civil edicts pertaining to marriage, birth
 control, and divorce.  This lino of attack continues.   In
 January 1960, Trybuna Ludu charged that the clergy had or-
 ganized a campaign against planned parenthood, abortions,
 and the sale of contraceptives and had further blackmailed
 pharmacists into refusing to sell contraceptives.   The daily
 took Cardinal Wyszynski to task for asserting that the
 Polish people had no reason to fear high birth rate,.   It
 was the State, not the Church, retorted the daily, that
 would have to build schools, houses, and factories for ad-
 ditions to the population.
 Repent Polish commentary implicitly impugns the state-
 ments of Soviet demographers that high birth rates are to be
 associated with dynamic societies.  The illustrated weekly
 Swiat put it as follows in April 1958:
 Let us reject the fictitious suggestion that a high
 birth rate is proof of improvement in the standard
 of living.  One should admit boldly that the exces-
 sive birth rate is one of the factors which adversely
 affect the standard of living and is even...the
 cause of misery...
 As the Poles became increasingly frank in giving their
 real reasons for favoring population limitation, they took
 up positions from which the Chinses carefully shied.   Job
 opportunities, it was stated, were not sufficiently numerous
 to take care of all new entrants to the labor force.   Speak-
 ing to the central  committee in October 1959, Gomulka at-
 tributed the meat shortage in part to the high birth rate.
 Speaking to the same audience in January 1960, chief of the
 Planning Commission and politburo member Jedrochosi observed
 that Poland's high birth rate forced the regime to invest
 more than countries with low birth rates in industries that
 served consumers.  As he foresaw it,.over a third of .net
 investments over the next five years would have to be ear-
 marked for the purpose of merely maintaining existing per
 capita levels of consumption.   This line of argument by Ma
 Yin-chu in China had cost him position and friends.
 In Hungary, the Communists have taken their position
 on the more acceptable feminist ground.  As Radio Budapest

 framed the rationale in September 1959, "Since the constitu-
 tion grants complete social, political, and economic equality
 to our women, it would be an infrimgemer.t of their rights not
 to allow women to dc& ide whether they should bear children
 and how many children they should-, have."  Not that the broader
 national economic interest was denied; the party newspaper
 rrjna bbaadsag acknowledged in May 1058 that "the growth of
 population is also an economic problem."        This thesis was
 illustrated by references to classroom and housing shortages,
 rathor than by any developed argument to show that population
 Growth hindered investment and national economic growth.
 Nevertheless the regime had clearly departed from earlier
 positions banning abortions and the sale of contraceptives.
 Under the terms of the decree promulgated in June 1956,
 doctors were permitted to perform abortions at the request
 of mothers even if the pregancies did not endanger the mothers'
 health.  The result of this measure was a rise in the number
 of legal abortions from some 35,000 in 1955 to 120,000 in
 1957.  Although the increase represented in large part merely
 the legalization of what had been illegal practice before,
 the authorities were appalled at the numbers and decided to
 encourage publicity for contraception as the better method
 to prevent unwanted births.   Leaflets were printed on the
 techniques of contraception, and prenatal and women's clinics
 were instructed to give women advice on how to prevent preg-
 nancies.
 In Czechoslovakia, the law forbidding abortions was
 liberalized in December 1957.   The following year there were
 about 38 legal abortions for every 100 births.  A birth con-
 trol center opened in Prague in 1957 gives advice'on contracep-
 tion.  The low birth rate in Czechoslovakia (17.4 per thousand
 in 1958), however, exerts no real pressure on the authorities
 to encourage contraception except as the preferred alterna-
 tive to abortion.
 Although East Germany and Albania have not legalized
 abortions, it is evident from the programs of the other
 countries that Chinese population policy has not been a
 cross-current in the Communist mainstream.  The Chinese ran
 for a time well ahead of the other currents (with the excep-
 tion perhaps of Poland's) but this did not occasion any in-
 trabloc polemic on Peiping's course.  The one prevailing
 feature in population policy and doctrine throughout the
 bloc has been the insistence oi-, retaining Malthus as the
 Lucifer of the plot. Beyond this, the Communists have tacitly
 accepted variety in the population programs that may be
 followed in the different countries.

 VI.  THE GEOPOLITICAL CONSIDERATION
 Moscow's failure to take issue with the Chinese policy
 on birth control reflects more than a disinclination to pub-
 licize doctrinal divergencies with an important ally.  There
 is evidence that the Russians, sharing a long common frontier
 with the Chinese, have their moments of "yellow peril" anxiety.
 This is an aspect of the long-range national interest that
 has apparently suggested to Kremlin leaders the rationality
 of taking satisfaction rather tiian displeasure in policies
 to curb population increase in China.
 Chinese internal migration
 Inner Mongolia,  Sinkiang, Tibet, and the Tibetan-populated
 province of Tsinghai comprise more than half of China's land
 area.  They hold perhaps 3 percent of China's population. The
 image of teeming hordes is applicable to the areas of China
 east of a line drawn from Manchuria southwest to Yunnan Prov-'
 ince.  Elsewhere, China has some of the- world's emptiest
 spaces.
 As buffers to absorb Chinese population increase before
 it presses against the Sino-Soviet border, these spaces give
 dubious comfort to the USSR.   In the first place, very little
 in-migration of ethnic Chinese is sufficieut to swamp the
 local minorities which have often been responsive to Soviet
 influence.   Sinkiang particularly was a sphere of Soviet in-
 fluence in the late 1930s and early 1940s.   In the early post-
 war period, the Russians were able to sponsor and support a
 revolt against the Nationalists in the Ili area of Sinkiang;
 after 1949 they retained a measure of economic influence for
 several years by operating oil, nonferrous. metal, and civil
 air enterprises jointly with the Chinese CommunSsts.   In the
 case of Inner Mongolia, the influx of Chinese and the polit-
 ical redrawing of boundaries have made the Mong')ls a minor-
 ity in theiq own "autonomous" territory; they .r.ow are out-
 numbered seven to one by the Chinese.   If these is in this
 Chinese population movement toward the border any ultimate
 implication for the Soviet position in Outer Mongolia, it
 is perhaps intimated in the irridentist sentiments Mao once
 expressed to Edgar Snow:

 When the people's revolution h^,s been victorious in
 China, the Outer Mongolian Republic will automatically
 become a part of the Chinese federation of its own
 will.
 As matters turned out, the Kremlin was able to obtain the Chi-
 nasc                      government's recognition of Outer Mongolian independence
 before Mao came to power, but the Chinese Communists still
 publish maps that dispute Ulan Batnr's and Moscow's versions
 of the China-?dongolia boundary line.
 In the second place, the migration of Chinese into the
 border areas does not have the compensating advantage For the
 USSR of significantly easing population pressure in China at
 large.   The population carrying capacity of the border areas
 is low.   The terrain and climate, though varied, are uniform-
 ly unfavorable to large-scale agricultural resettlement;

 The "blind infiltration" into the cities has led the authori-
 ties at various times to tighten controls on travel.  Cer-
 tificates of employment from urban labor agencies, certifi-
 cates of acceptance from schools, or other such guarantees
 have to be presented before permission is granted to peasants
 to migrate to the cities.   These measures prove ineffective
 to stem the flow when "spring famine" in the countryside
 reaches disaster proportions.   In the spring of 1960, a
 hundred thousand and more peasants swarmed into each of
 such major cities as Peiping and Canton.
 As most observers evaluate the prospects,  it is the

 the development of the border regions that will continue to
 afford the more impcvtant outlet for China's surplus peoples.
 The flow to the border areas will be statistically signifi-
 cant in relation.to their present populations and will tend,
 therefore, to eliminate the vestiges of Russian, Mongol,
 Tibetan, and other non-Chinese influences in those areas.
 This interregional flow, however, will remain minor by
 comparison with the high volume of natural increase in the
 country as a whole.  Even considered in conjunction with the
 flow to the cities, it will not allay the qualms of those
 individuals who apprehend eventual Chinese demands for
 lebensraum.
 The population of the Soviet lands adjoining China in
 the Far East is about 6,000,000.  On the other side of the
 boundary line, Manchuria has perhaps 50,000,000 Chinese.
 The presumed danger from the population disparity notwith-
 standing, the Russians agreed in the 1950s to work jointly
 with Peiping on projects that would in fact seem to facilitate
 rather than discourage migration toward and to the USSR.
 The two countries cooperated,  for example, to construct the
 railroad from China to the USSR that transverses Outer Mon-
 golia.  After the line was opened on 1 January 1956, there
 was a visible expansion of Chinese contacts with the Outer
 Mongolians; Peiping extended technical aid to Ulan Bator,
 and some 10,000 Chinese are said to have gone to Outer Mon-
 golia to work on construction-projects.-
 Further to the east, the Russians agreed to a project
 for joint research and exploration in the Amur basin during
 the years 1956 to 1960.   Joint field studies began in 1956
 with a view to developing plans for the development of hy-
 droelectric power, waterways, and flood ^ontrol.   According
 to a Pravda news account of 12 November 1956,  "large masses
 of virgin land were found to have climatic conditions very
 favorable for the development of agriculture."  There are
 obvious benefits that will accrue to Russian districts
 around the Amur; the point is that these benefits (and the
 general advantages to Moscow of promoting Sino-Soviet
 harmony) for the present seemed to outweigh apprehensions
 about Chinese spillover across the border.

 , A
 If the Kremlin's anxieties for the near future have not
 boon acute, there is fairly good reason.   First, there has
 been no objective sign of Chinese Communist inclination to
 push a mass migration across the border in search of arable
 land.  The Soviet Far Eastern provinces--lightly populated
 as they are--are barely self-sufficient in food grains. Even
 in their southern sectors, the winters are severe, although
 tie growing period is long enough  or certain crops.   Farther
 north the farmers are limited to the cultivation of a few quic:k-
 ;rowing varieties.  Permafrost is the land feature of most of
 the area north of the 55th parallel.  The region has not at-
 tracted Russian tillers.  Until technological innovations bring
 precedent-breaking changes, it will have very limited attraction
 for Chinese farmers.
 Second,  "land hunger" is not a predominant motivating
 force in Chinese migration anyway.  The bulk of migration
 within China under the Communists has been from farm. to city
 or from city to city.  Emigration abroad in the last century
 has also been prompted in the main by the desire to take ad-
 vantage of nonagricultural opportunities in foreign lands. An
 influx of Chinese into Siberia during the next 25 years is im-
 probable if Moscow does not allow them to take up jobs in the
 factories and other Soviet enterprises.                         25X1
 To say that the Russians are not overly concerned about a
 Chinese influx within the next 25 years is not to say that they
 will, during this period, be insensitive to changes that might
 eventuate later.

 A further indication that
 a'.zalyses are not completely ou  o  line with Communist think-
 ing comes from some remarks of Chang Kuo-tao, a former member
 of the Chinese Communist politburo.   Speaking to a visiting US
 official in Hong Kong, Chang said that population pressure in
 China could not occasion Sino-Soviet conflict for "at least
 scores of years."  Chang evidently intended to belittle the is-
 sue but could not exclude its ultimate relevance for Sino-Soviet
 relations.
 Finally, the historical record may afford some intimation
 of present attitudes.  The population disparity between the
 Russian Far East and Manchuria occasioned grave concern in Rus-
 sian circles both before and after the Revolution.  The ratio
 was 30,000 to 9,000,000 at the turn of the century, 1,000,000
 to 19,000,000 after World War I, over 2,000,000 to 40,000,000
 at the beginning of World War II.  The Chinese who crossed over
 into Siberia were few but unwelcome.   In 1900, the Russian author
 ities in the Amur;         region pushed the Chinese back across
 the frontier; nearly 5,000 lost their lives near Blagoveshchensk
 when driven into the Amur River.

 In the Soviet era, the Russian interest in peopling the
 Far East continued and was implemented under the Five-Year Plans.
 After Japan seized Manchuria, the question became all the more                                                      LJ

 were dependent on supplies from Europe, would be an obvious
 handicap in a two-front war.  Ten percent of the total budget
 in the Third Five-Year Plan (1938-1942) was allocated to the
 development of the Soviet Far East and East Siberia.  The eth-
 n .+c composition of the peoples of the area was considered to
 .have its bearing on national ,security; by 1939, the prudent
 authorities had removed the Koreans and Chinese to Central
 Asia.

 Tho defeat o:E Japan has brought no 11minution of the
 Soviet drive to people the Far Past with Europeans.   Finan-
 ci:al inducomonts to por.suade farmo:s to colonize Primorsky
 Kral on tho Chinese border :In 191.57 included free transpor-
 tation for tho family, cash paymont3 based on family mizo,
 crod:its to build homes and to ::;cock farms, and n;cemption from
 ta,cos and stato grain procurement for five years.
 The skein of considerations that have impelled the Rus-
 sian authority os to encourage European migration eastward of
 course include threads of economic interest as distinct from
 tho problems of military security.  Were thorn no Japan or
 China, an overland migration toward the Pacific would prob-
 ably have occurred anyway.  The record suggests, however, that
 national security interests have carried considerable weight in
 the past and that the size and racial composition of the pope--
 lation in the Soviet Far East remain matters of importance to
 military as well as economic planners in the Kremlin.  There
 seems to be no groat worry that the Chinese will want to push
 into the area to take up farm lands in this generation; but the
 growing number of nonfarm Job opportunities in the Soviet Far
 East would certainly attract many Chinese if the barriers against
 population movement across the border were led down.  The Rus-
 sians presumably still recall the need to relocate suspect pop-
 ulations during World War II, and they are making no move to let
 the barriers down.
 The balance of forces
 The more sophistic?3ted fozsbodings of population expansion
 in China do not envisage the mere swarming of Chinese masses
 across frontiers.  For all the "living space" arguments of
 Japanese militarists in the 1930s, the seizure and development
 of Manchuria resulted in only limited Japanese emigration.  (Some
 800,000 Japanese lived in Manchuria in 1940.)   In the modern
 world, militant industrial societies can extend their areas of
 economic and political hegemony without expo.ting much manpower.
 The presumed danger to the USSR is not so much from the inflow
 of hungry Chinese as from Peiping's ever growing ability to as-
 sort its political and economic interests as a world power.
 It seems probable that Soviet thoughts now and then dwell
 on this danger since so many Soviet formulations explicitly re-
 late population size to shifts in the international balance.

 November 1957,  "is the 'transition from capitalism to so-
 c:t.tlism. .  .  .                         Today more than a third of the population
 o1 the world--over 950,000,000 people--have taken the road
 of socialism."      In addition, "over 700,000,000 people have
 sliakon off the colonial yoke,'  Moscow left unstated--but
 probably not unconsidered--the numerical distribution within
 the bloc; some two out of three persons in the bloc were
 Chinese.  By the end of the 1960s the demographic ixir]icated the                                              projections proportion would be around 70 percent.   It was
 cli:fficult to say with much assurance what would happen in the
 years beyond, but one could hardly exclude the possibility
 that three out of every four persons in the bloc would be
 Chinese sometime in the 1980s.  China would add about three
 Soviet Unions to its population by 1985.   Striking as the
 national totals were, one had further to consider that the
 population disparity would be particularly zreat in the Tar
 East--remote from the main centers of Soviet power, on the
 very doorstep of China.
 Considerations such as these, unarticulated perhaps but
 nonetheless sensed, may lie behind the comments of the every-
 day Russians who on occasion talk frankly to Americans. Robert
 C  N
 C
 th
 r
 .   o    , writing in The Reporter of 5 March 1959, recount,;
 the incident of an American in Moscow explaining the attitude
 of New Yorkers toward the influx of Puerto Ricans.   "...sup-
 pose planeload after planeload of Chinese were du
 d i
 mpe
 n Mos-
 cow."  The American apparently made his point, for the response
 was said to be,  "Yes, yes, now I understand."  And North quotes
 an agronomist in Moscow,  "...in China we Russians have a tiger
 by the tail
 W
 '
 .
 e
 ve got to hold on.  There's no letting go."
 Sentiments in this vein were also heard by a US Embassy
 officer in Moscow who attended a lecture on "The Economy and
 Culture of thE, Chinese People's Republic" in December 1959.
 The lecturer alluded to the fact that China's population was
 approaching 800,000,000.  At this point, one of the Russians
 in the audience muttared, "Yes, and soon they'll turn them
 loose."

 Pensive ruminations about the Chinese hordes seems to have
 had just this danressing effect upon one of the functionarios in
 trig Soviet Ministry of Culture.  After imbibing perhaps a little
 too much at a reception in December 7.959, he carne over to a US
 Embassy officer and enlarged on the necessity of Soviet-American
 friendship; as far as the friendship with China went, well, the
 United States had once been a friend of China's too.  The Amer-
 ican observed that Sino-American conflict had been tempered some-
 what by the facts of geography--the ocean between.   "Yes," re-
 plied
 the Russian,  "but we do not have this ocean. We have a
 long land frontier instead."

 There is not of course complete uniformity of attitude in
 Russian circles toward the eventual danger posed by a China with
 the industrial strength necessar  to make its vast manpower re-
 sources militarily effective.
 Popular distrust of the Chinese is apparently reinforced
 by reflections on the problem of surrvival in nuclear conflict.

 The humor is possibly tailored from cloth supplied by the

 It was possibly to this po3'ion that Tito
 was referring when he spoke to 50,000 people at Labin in
 795x:
 It is interesting that the Chinese leaders also
 assail us because of our foreign policy, the
 policy of coexistence of states and peoples with
 different social systems...they are bothered by
 our peaceful policy, our policy of peace, our pol-
 icy of coexistence.  But difficulties in building
 socialism are not solved by war, even if a country
 has 600,000,000 inhabitants as some of their people
 like to point out--in a war still about 300,000,000
 Chinese would survive.
 Cr.
 The indictment of Tito's and the misgivings voiced or in-
 timated by some Russians may have run also through the private
 though?cs of the top Soviet leaders; they have not admitted to
 them publicly.   In December 1955, Khrushchev took occasion in
 Rangoon to scorn the warnings of one "bourgeois leader" who
 compared China's 600,000,000 people to Russia's 200,000,000
 and suggested that aid to China would build up an eventual
 menace to the USSR.  Khrushchev disdained the warning as ten-   Q_i
 dentious,  "not prompted by good intentions."
 When interviewed by prominent Americans a few years later,
 the Soviet leader was equally vehement in rejecting the idea
 of a Chinese population threat.  To Eric Johnston in 1958,
 Khrushchev averred, "China is a great country.  By the year
 2000 it may have a billion people, but Communist states never
 think of going to war with each other...there is no fear of
 China."  Walter Lippman the same year and Averell Harriman the
 following year received similar responses.  To Harriman, how-
 ever, the Soviet leader added some comments that may have re-
 flected inner uncertainties.  The Chinese people, he said, pre-
 sented a special and delicate situation since they had their
 own way of looking at problems, and the Soviet Union did not
 want to tell them how to run their own country.
