 THE FAILURE OF MAOIST IDEOLOGY
 MEMORANDUM FOR RECIPIENTS
 This study examines the causes and course of
 the fairly dismal attempt of China;, during the height
 of its Cultural Revolution, to export Maoist radicalism
 abroad,  The study concludes that this advance found
 its source in domestic conflict;, its retreat in foreign
 affairs concerns -- especially the rising Soviet threat?
 The study also finds that radical Maoism has won its
 greatest support not, as anticipated by Peking, as a
 guide to the practical problems of various underdeveloped
 societies, but as simply one article of mystical faith
 among certain revolutionary extremists in the world s
 advanced industrial states.
 The study has met general agreement among China
 specialists within the              of Intelligence.

 THE FAILURE OF MAOIST IDEOLOGY
 IN FOREIGN POLICY
 Summary
 If Maoist ideology is defined loosely as a
 body of ideas derived from Marxist-Leninist doctrines
 and shaped by half a century's experience of the
 Chinese Communist revolution, it is the international
 impact of the more extreme version of Maoism which
 culminated in the Cultural Revolution with which
 this paper is primarily concerned.  Although the
 international impact of this appeal to continue the
 revolution both at home and abroad provides the
 central theme, this paper also discusses the
 reciprocal impact of developments abroad upon Maoist
 ideology.
 It is a thesis of this paper that the more
 extreme Maoism which began to appear in the fall
 of 1962 was intended primarily to justify and
 legitimize Mao's rule in the face of domestic
 opposition within China.  But while this particular
 variant of Mao's ideology and the claims made for
 it as the acme of Marxism-Leninism in the present
 era may have performed a positive function in
 enhancing the authority of Mao within China, the
 increasingly radical character of this ideology
 and its claims resulted externally in (1) affronting
 foreign Communist Parties intent upon following
 their own "national roads" to socialism; (2) alarming
 national bourgeois governments of Asia, Africa and
 Latin America; and (3) reducing China's international
 prestige to its lowest point in two decades.

 The strategy employed in the first stage of
 this swing to the Left (1963-1964) was, in retrospect,
 relatively flexible and pragmatic.  Mao's revolu-
 tionary doctrines appealed, moreover, to the leader-
 ship of a number of Communist Parties who, viewing
 the Soviet emphasis on "peaceful coexistence" as
 harmful to their own revolutionary interests, were
 attracted by the anti-colonial, anti-imperialist and
 anti-American core of Maoist strategy.
 Mao's decision in the winter of 1964-1965 to
 intensify the struggle against Khrushchev's successors,
 however, had profound consequences.  It dictated
 the adamant refusal to join the Soviet Union in any
 form of "united action" in aid of North Vietnam,
 a refusal justified by the unconvincing and paradoxical
 argument that in order to oppose successfully "United
 States imperialism," it was first necessary to oppose
 "modern revisionism."  Reflecting an unrealistic and
 distorted view of the outside world, this was a policy
 of opposing simultaneously and with equally acute
 antagonism both the United States and the Soviet
 Union, a policy so extreme that within a matter of
 months China's only ally in what Peking described
 as "the broadest possible united front" was mighty
 Albania.
 If the primary purpose of the Cultural Revo-
 lution?(formally initiated in May of 1966) was to
 restore Mao"s political and ideological authority
 within China, an important means to this end was a
 concerted effort to demonstrate that Mao's thought,
 as the highe::t form of contemporary Marxism-Leninism,
 was held in high esteem throughout the rest of the
 world.  This undertaking to transform the Cultural
 Revolution into "a revolution of an international
 order" embroiled China in controversy with nearly
 every important government in the world.  Within
 two years time, the extremism, violence and utopian-
 ism of the Cultural Revolution left China almost
 completely isolated, dependent for visible signs
 of support from the outside world on Albania, an

 ill-assorted group of "Marxist-Leninist" splinter
 parties, and student revolutionaries of the New Left.
 The issue of the exportability of Mao's thought
 lay at the very heart of the struggle between the
 "revolutionary Left" and the professional diplomats
 within the Foreign Ministry throughout the Cultural
 Revolution.  With the Left firmly in command, China's
 foreign relations in the spring and summer of 1967
 were characterized by a series of developments
 repeated with little variation in a number of
 countries:  the transformation of the Embassy and
 New China News Agency into centers for the propaga-
 tion of Mao's thought, and the distribution of badges
 and other symbols of Mao's personality cult; an
 ensuing clash when local government authorities
 moved to curtail or prohibit these practices; various
 forms of retaliation by Peking ranging from sponsor-
 ship of Communist armed revolt (as in Burma) to,
 more commonly, Red Guard harassment of, and physical
 attacks against, the embassies and diplomats of the
 offending governments; and, in some cases, suspension
 of diplomatic relations.  Reflecting the claim of
 universal validity for Mao's thought, this missionary
 effort encompassed hostile, neutral and friendly
 countries alike, the latter exemplified by North
 Korea and North Vietnam, both of which protested in
 Party publications against this attempt to impose
 Maoist ideology on their own national movements.
 One of the many ironies of the Cultural
 Revolution is that the effort to propagate Mao's
 thought and thus promote revolution abroad should
 have its greatest impact not in the countries of
 the Third World (developing the national liberation
 movement), nor in the countries of the socialist
 camp (strengthening the "Marxist-Leninist" forces)
 as predicted, but rather in many advanced indus-
 trialized countries of the world where the Chinese
 Communists had seen little or no chance for revolu-
 tionary uprisings.  Attracted by the elements of

 utopianism, anarchism and student elitism in Mao's
 Cultural Revolution, the rebellious students of the
 New Left in France and Japan who rose up to seize
 control over their university campuses as a first
 step toward "revolutionizing" society were protest-
 ing what they considered to be serious defects in
 the organization and functioning of their highly
 complex societies.
 It is easy to exaggerate the influence of
 Maoist ideology on the student revolutionaries
 of the New Left.  In searching examinations of the
 intellectual roots of the New Left, Richard Lowenthal
 and other knowledgeable observers have traced the
 principal characteristics of this new type of revolu-
 tionary movement (a faith in utopia and a cult of
 violent action) as much to the writings of Che Guevara
 and Regis Debray (the theorists of "Castroism"),
 and of Herbert Marcuse (the American ideological
 critic), as to those of Mao Tse-tung.
 If the turn to the Left in Maoist ideology
 which began in 1962 was basically a response to
 domestic political pressures, the turn to the Right
 which began hesitantly in the fall of 1967 and has
 proceeded through several fairly well-defined
 stages up to the present appears to have been
 stimulated to a significant extent by external
 pressures, specifically the growing military threat
 to China posed by the Soviet Union.  The realiza-
 tion that, as a result of the provocative and self-
 defeating foreign policy of the Cultural Revolution,
 China stood isolated in the face of a major threat
 to its national security has had a particularly
 sobering effect on the Chinese leadership.
 The emergence in Peking of a "nationalist
 model" approach to foreign policy in the past two
 years constitutes a sharp turn away from the "re-
 volutionary model" which had dominated China's

 foreign relations during the Cultural Revolution.
 Instead of a policy proclaiming the need to promote
 revolution abroad in imitation of the Chinese
 model of armed struggle, Peking now poses as the
 champion of national sovereignty.  Instead of a
 policy directed at a largely fictitious constituency
 of "revolutionary Leftists" throughout the world
 committed to the Maoist goal of violent revolution,
 Peking has now reverted to the pro-Cultural Revolu-
 tion Maoist concept of developing a broad inter-
 national united front composed of governments and
 peoples against what it likes to call the "super-
 power hegemony" of the United States and the Soviet
 Union.  Instead of a policy relying heavily on
 ideology (the export of Mao's thought) to promote
 China's revolutionary objectives, Peking now relies
 on the more conventional weapons of great-power
 diplomacy, including such material incentives as
 economic aid and trade, to project its influence
 abroad.
 The shift to the Right in domestic and
 foreign policy had become so pronounced by the fall
 of 1970 that it was necessary to explain to both
 domestic and foreign audiences why this shift had
 taken place.  In time-honored fashion, it was
 decided, apparently at the Second Plenum of the
 new Central Committee held in late August and
 early September, to explain the excesses and violence
 arid attendant policy failures of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion as the work of an "ultra-Leftist group" headed
 by the leading Chinese Communist ideologue and long-
 time confidant of Mao, Chen Po-ta.
 It waz symbolic that Chen Po-ta (the
 ideologue exemplifying the forces of the "revolu-
 tionary Left") was now replaced by Chou En-lai
 (regarded as the foremost exponene of pragmatism
 and moderation within the top Chinese leadership).
 It was also indicative of the extent to which Maoist

 ideology, having veered sharply to the Left during
 the Cultural Revolution in an attempt to revolu-
 tionize Chinese society -,nd in time the world, has
 once again (as it had a decade earlier) been forced
 to swing back sharply to the Right in adjusting to
 reality.
 The basic cause for the failure of the
 Leftist ideological offensive which Mao had initiated
 in 1962 was the complexity and intractability of
 the real world.  Although all the returns are not
 yet in, the end result of Mao's attempt to revolu-
 tionize his own society by intimidation and coercion
 appears to be, as one observer has put it, a "utopia...
 run by the army."  Although again all the returns are
 not yet in, the end result of the concurrent attempt
 during the Cultural Revolution to revolutionize the
 world appears to be that the outside world, by e'ert-
 ing a moderating influence on that ideology, has
 triumphed over the utopian version cf Maoism.

 THE FAILURE OF MAOIST IDEOLOGY

 Introduction
 Actually the situation within the
 socialist camp is quite simple.   The

 -- a question of struggle between the
 proletariat anc the bourgeoisie, a
 question of struggle between Marxism-
 Leninism and a.tti-Marxism--Leninism, a
 question of struggle between Marxism-
 Leninism and revisionism.

 Committee Plenum, 24 September 1962?
 The  ueetion of claea struggle
 in  [China] is [aleoj a question of
 struggle between Marxism and revi-

 to rename Right opportunism as revi-
 sioniem in China.

 the more extreme version of Maoism which began to emerge
 in the fall of 1962 and which would culminate in the
 Cultural Revolution with which this paper is primarily
 concerned.  In common with other ideologies, this more
 extreme variant of Maoism consisted of (1) a theory of
 the nature of society (which explained human conduct as
 largely determined by "class nature");  (2) a program
 of social and political change (featuring, as suggested
 by the quotations cited above, "class struggle"); and
 (3) a call to action (a call addressed, in addition to the
 domestic audience, to a foreign audience composed variously
 of governments, Communist Parties, revolutionary groups
 and other "revolutionary Leftists" presumed receptive
 to this more militant version of Maoism).  Although the
 international impact of this appeal to continue the revo-,
 lution both at home and abroad provides the central theme,
 this paper will also discuss the reciprocal impact of
 developments abroad (the reaction of this diverse foreign
 audience) upon Maoist ideology.
 It is a thesis of this paper that the m ee extreme
 version of Maoism which began to appear in the fall of
 1962 was intended primarily to justify and legitimize
 Mao's rule in the face of domestic opposition within China.
 But while this Leftist variant of Mao's ideology and the
 claims made for it as the acme of Marxism-Leninism in the
 present era may have performed a positive function in
 enhancing the authority of Mao within China, the increas-
 ingly overt and extravagant nature of these claims had
 the negative effect externally of affronting foreign Com-
 munist Parties intent upon following their own "national
 roads" to socialism.  While the accompanying ideological
 and organizational challenge to the Soviet Union for
 leadership over the international Communist movement may
 have aroused a patriotic response and thus strengthened
 Mao's political position at home, the extreme lengths tc
 which Mao was prepared to carry this challenge had the
 negative effect abroad of alienating friends and neutrals
 until China stood virtually alone among her former Com-
 munist allies.

 Similarly, while the widely publicized view accompany-
 ing this challenge that a revolutionary upsurge featuring
 armed struggle and employing Maoist strategy was imminent
 in the underdeveloped world of Asia, Africa and Latin
 America might again have been functional in the sense of
 elevating Mao's prestige in China, the net effect of this
 more militant revolutionary posture abroad was to alarm
 the national bourgeoisie governments in these areas,
 especially in Africa, dissipating the assets and goodwill
 built up laboriously over a decade by means of economic
 assistance, trade and conventional diplomacy.  Finally,
 although the utopianism and violence of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion could be justified as essential to overthrow Mao's
 opposition entrenched within the Party bureaucracy at home,
 the overall effect abroad of this spectacle of licensed
 anarchism was to reduce China's international prestige to
 its lowest point in two decades, with only the student
 radicals of the New Left responding favorably to this
 anarchic element in Mao Tse-tung's thought.
 If Mao's obsession with "class struggle" in the fall
 of 1962 (e.g. his statement at the Tenth Plenum:  "From now
 on, we must discuss classes and class struggle every year,
 every month, every day.") reflected also a genuine concern
 for continuing the revolution both at hone and abroad, the
 opposition engendered by this simplistic and distorted view
 of the nature of human society drove him further and further
 to the Left in search of allies.  By drawing ever more rigid
 and restrictive lines of demarcation based upon a meta-
 physical concept of class nature, Mao and his supporters
 found themselves increasingly isolated within the interna-
 tional community, the international Communist movement and
 within China itself.  To correct this "ultra-Leftist" devia-
 tion, it was finally deemed necessary to point out (at
 another Central Committee plenum held eight years later in
 September 1970) that, in addition to its "class nature," an
 equally important characteristic of Mao's thought was its
 "practicality."

 (1) to explain why Maoist ideology has changed (moving
 first to the Left, then even further Left during the
 Cultural Revolution, and finally back toward the Right)
 over the past eight years, (2) to assess the international
 impact of the more extreme version of Maoist ideology

 In proclaiming his own "general line" for the Com-

 society).  In place of the false "revisionist" line of
 Khrushchev, Peking offered an authentic "Marxist-Leninist"
 general line for the international Communist movement
 embodying what Benjamin Schwartz has called Mao's "optimum
 global vision" -- a world Communist movement reconstituted
 under Chinese leadership and dedicated to promoting revolu.
 tion based on China's "revolutionary model" in the under-
 developed and oppressed areas of Asia, Africa and Latin
 America.  Implicit in this polemical attack was Mao's
 prescription of the proper way to build socialism after
 the seizure of power, a prescription also based in large
 part on China's own revolutionary experience in Yenan
 featuring class struggle, heroic poverty and collective
 enthusiasm.  This attempt to recast Marxism-Leninism in the
 image of Mao's own revolutionary experience in both revolu-
 tion and construction would, by provoking further opposition
 at home and abroad, lead in time to the violence, extremism,,
 and pariah-like isolation of China during the Cultural
 Revolution.
 The strategy employed in the first stage of this
 swing to the Left encompassing the years 1963-1964 was,
 in retrospect, relatively flexible and pragmatic.  In its
 ideological and organizational challenge to the Soviet
 Union for leadership over the international Communist
 movdnent, Peking throughout this period championed the
 national independence of Communist Parties, offering in
 place of Soviet domination a more benign organizational
 model for the movement in which China's leading role would
 be recognized voluntarily by the other parties.  The same,
 at least nominal, reliance on persuasion characterized the
 Chinese approach to "the great debate on Marxism-Leninism"
 with the Soviets throughout this period, viewed by Peking as
 an international rectification campaign designed to convince
 "the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
 to correct its errors and return to the path of Marxism-
 Leninism..."
 Mao's revolutionary doctrines appealed, moreover,
 to the leadership of a number of Communist Parties who,

 viewing the Soviet emphasis on "peaceful coexistence" as
 harmful to their own revolutionary interests, were at-
 tracted by the anti-colonial, anti-imperialist and anti-
 American core of Maoist strategy.  This was particularly
 true in Asia, where by the end of 1964 the great majority
 of Communist Parties (including the important Parties in
 Indonesia, North Vietnam, North Korea and Japan) had
 opted for Peking's more aggressive revolutionary strategy,
 in which United States "imperialism" was the main enemy
 and in which elimination of American power and influence
 from Asia was the common goal.  Despite a number of prob-
 lems -- logistical (distance), organizational (the pro-
 Soviet complexion of existing Parties) and ideological
 (the competing revolutionary doctrine of "Castroism"),
 some progress in setting up pro-Chinese Communist Parties
 (e.g. in Brazil and Peru) was also achieved in Latin America
 during this early period.
 In Africa, however, even in this early period,
 Peking's attempt to project its influence abroad by
 advocating revolution based on the Chinese model received
 its first setback.  As the second most important area
 of Chinese foreign policy, the newly independent nations
 of Africa had, up to this time, been cultivated by a broad-
 gauged program combining political blandishment, economic
 and technical assistance and cultural diplomacy.  But
 Peking's ideological pronouncement in late 1963* that
 "socialist countries were duty bound" to serve as "base
 areas" in support of "armed struggle" in "the extremely
 favorable revol tt'.onary situation [which] now exists in
 Asia, Africa  and Latin America," followed shortly by
 Premier Chou En-lai's observation on completing a tour

 of 10 African countries* that "revolutionary prospects are
 excellent throughout the African continent," could only
 be regarded with suspicion by Africa's new leaders.**
 It was a natural reaction for leaders of national bourgeois
 governments (e.g. the leaders of the government of Kenya)
 to question whether they themselves were the object of
 the "armed struggle" emphasized in China's revolutionary
 model, the more so since that model called for "proletarian"
 leadership of the revolution at some point.  In addition
 to this perceived threat of subversion, the new leaders
 of Africa were increasingly suspicious of Peking's efforts
 at this time to form a Chinese-led international "united
 front" directed at both the United States (imperialism)
 and the Soviet Union (revisionism) when their own national
 interests dictated non-alignment and the acceptance of
 economic aid from both.
 Paralleling this undertaking to promote revolution
 abroad, the first stage of a "socialist education" campaign
 within China -- a campaign designed to persuade the Chinese
 Communist Party and the Chinese people once again (after
 three years of privation and ignominious retreat from the
 original goals of the Great Leap Forward and commune pro-
 grams) of the validity of Mao's approach to building
 socialism -- was also relatively moderate.  As revealed
 *At a 3 February 1864 mass rally in Somalia.
 it is interesting to note that Foreign Minister Chen
 I (in analysing the reasons for a number of international
 setbacks encountered by Peking) subsequently characterised
 this visit by Chou En-tai to Africa in the winter of 1963-
 1964 as a watershed in China's relations with the Third
 World.  Before Chou's visit, according to Chen, these
 nations thought of China as "a comparatively mild Commun-
 ist country," but after Chou's visit and the accompanying
 shift of the "revolutionary center of Communism" from
 Moscow to Peking, these countries now thought of China
 as "a comparatively violent Communist nation."

 in Mao's speech at the Tenth Plenum in September 1962,
 it was agreed that for a time economic reconstruction
 would take priority over political and ideological
 reform ("We must not allow the class struggle to inter-
 fere with our work.")                  In this interim period extending
 throughout 1964, the "socialist education" campaign was
 focused on the countryside in a joint effort to re-instil
 a "revolutionary spirit" of self-sacrifice in the Chinese
 people and to re-establish control over agriculture as a
 prerequisite for new economic development.
 Two developments in the winter of 1964-1965 fore-
 shadowed an impending shift further to the Left in both
 domestic and foreign policy.  As Lin Piao would sub-
 sequently point out in his political report to the Ninth
 Party Congress, the first of these occurred "at the end of
 1964 [when] Chairman Mao convened a working conference of
 the Central Committee... [at which]...he denounced Liu
 Shao-chi's bourgeois reactionary line...[and]...clearly
 showed the orientation for the approaching great proletarian
 cultural revolution."  Convinced that the "socialist
 education" campaign had failed, Mao then began to plan a
 Cultural Revolution in pursuit of the same goals, but
 under new management (Lin Piao?and others) and employing
 new methods (coercion and violence).
 The second development was the confrontation in
 Peking between Chairman Mao and Premier Kosygin on 11
 February 1965, during which Mao asserted that if necessary
 China would continue the struggle against the Soviet Union
 "for 10,000 years."  Perhaps based on the assumption that
 his previous ideological assault had (as a subsequent
 Chinese editorial of 11 November 1965 put it) "hastened
 the bankruptcy of Khrushchev's revisionism and... [driven] ...
 its founder into the grave," Mao's decision at this time
 to intensify the struggle against Khrushchev's successors
 would have profound consequences.  It dictated the adamant
 refusal (announced the following month in the joint People's
 Daily and Red Flag editorial article, "A Comment on the
 arch Moscow 1Neeting") to join the Soviet Union in any
 form of "united action" in aid of North Vietnam, a refusal

 justified by the unconvincing and paradoxical argument
 that in order to oppose successfully "United States
 imperialism" it was first necessary to oppose "modern
 revisionism."
 What is more, since in Chinese eyes Mao was now
 the fountainhead of authentic Marxism-Leninism, it was
 incumbent upon "all Marxist-Leninist parties," as
 emphasized in the major editorial of 11 November 1965,
 to accept this position    "to draw a clear line of
 demarcation both politically and organizationally between
 themselves and the revisionists, who are serving United
 States imperialism, and to liquidate Khrushchev revision-
 ism in order to welcome the high tide of revolutionary
 struggle against United States imperialism and its lackeys."
 Reflecting an unrealistic and distorted view of the out-
 side world, this was a policy of opposing simultaneously
 and with equally acute antagonism both the United States
 and the Soviet Union, a policy so extreme that within a
 matter of months China?s only ally in what Peking described
 as "the broadest possible united front" was Albania.*
 If this constituted a clear-cut example of "Left"
 deviationism in "united front" theory, the intensified
 effort at this time to promote revolution abroad patterned
 after the Chinese revolutionary model constituted a form
 of "Left" adventurism -- namely (as defined by the Chinese

 themselves), an attempt to encourage "launching of a
 revolution before the objective conditions are ripe."
 The assertion in Lin Piao3's famous treatise on people?s
 war, published on 3 September 1965 that "today the con-
 ditions are more favorable than ever before for the
 waging of people?s wars by the revolutionary peoples of
 Asia, Africa and Latin America" was followed within a
 month by the disastrous coup attempt by the Indonesian
 Communists (in which Peking apparently was not directly
 involved). resulting in the virtual liquidation of the
 largest non-bloc Communist Party in the world.   It was
 just at this time, moreover, that the Chinese Communists
 began to insist that their revolutionary model be fol-
 lowed not only in underdeveloped areas,, but also in such
 advanced industrial nations as,Japan.  As the Secretary-
 General of the Japanese Communist Party has recently
 charged (at the 11th Party Congress in July 1970), the
 Chinese Communist Party was guilty of "ultraTLeft oppor-
 tunism" when it attempted in 196S-1966 to impose a strategy
 of "armed struggle" on the Japanese Communist movement.
 The final instance of a turn to the Left in
 foreign policy in 1965 was the Chinese resort to arm.-
 twisting and threats against Asian and African heads of
 state in an effort, first to hold a Second Bandung Con-
 ference from which the Soviet Union would be excluded,,
 and then to cancel this conference when it was discovered
 that the Soviet Union could not be excluded.  In this
 attempt to coerce foreign governments in the summer and
 fall of 1965,, there was a hint of the violence and
 extremism of Red Guard diplomacy soon to appear as the
 hallmark of the Cultural Revolution in China's foreign
 relations.

 in high esteem throughout the rest of the world.  This
 undertaking to transform the Cultural Revolution (a dis-
 tinctively Chinese phenomenon reflecting a domestic power
 and policy conflict) into "a revolution of an interna-
 tional order" would embroil China in controversy with
 nearly every important government in the world.  Within
 two years time, the extremism,. violence and utopianism
 of the Cultural Revolution would leave China almost com-
 pletely isolated, dependent for visible signs of support
 from the outside world on Albania: an ill-assorted group
 of "Marxist..-Leninist" splinter parties, and student
 revolutionaries of the New Left.
 With the unveiling of the Cultural Revolution at
 an expanded Politburo session in May 1966, it was revealed
 that the main source of Mao''s "revisionist" opposition
 within China was located at the highest level of Party
 leadership.  Addressing a number of these top leaders
 in July, Mao disclosed that revolutionary students and
 teachers (che precursors of the Red Guards) were going
 "to impose revolution on you people because you did not
 carry out the revolution yourselves."  In this sense, then,
 the Cultural Revolution can be understood as Mao's last
 desperate attempt to seize by force what he could not
 gain through persuasion from his Party and society at
 large.
 In carrying out this new type of forcibly imposed
 rectification campaign, the principal criterion differ-
 entiating "genuine" from "sham" revolutionaries and
 "Marxist--Lenir,ists from revisionists" was "one's atti-
 tude towards Mao's thought."  As spelled out by Lin
 Piao in his keynote  speech at a Central Committee plenum
 in August 1966, the Cultural Revolution was conceived
 as "a general examination, a general alignment, and a
 general reorganization of the ranks of party cadres"
 directed at (1) "those who oppose the thought of Mao
 Tse-tung"; (2) "those who upset political-ideological
 work"; and (3) "those who have no revolutionary zeal."

 In addition to these (Rightists) who were "to be dis-
 missed from their posts," there were those in an "inter-
 mediate state" (the center) who had made mistakes but
 who, "provided they accept education and resolutely
 repent," would be retained in their posts.  The third
 category (the Leftists), those who eagerly studied Mao,
 attached great importance to political-ideological work
 and were filled with revolutionary zeal, were to be
 "promoted."  As also indicated by Lin Piao, this under-
 taking to "revolutionize" the Party apparatus by promot-
 ing Leftist cadres loyal to Mao to positions of leader-
 ship would be supervised by a newly formed Cultural
 Revolution Group composed of such top-level Leftist Party
 leaders as Chen Po-ta, Kang Sheng, and last but not
 least, Mao's wife, Chiang Ching.
 With this background in mind, it is easier to
 understand the momentous consequences which Mao's
 decisions (noted above) to "revolutionize" the foreign
 affairs apparatus would have for China's foreign rela-
 tions during the Cultural Revolution.  The decision to
 "revolutionize" the foreign affairs apparatus within
 China would lead to the establishment of a "revolution-
 ary rebel liaison station" within the Foreign Ministry
 assigned the dual function of investigating the loyalty
 (i.e. their "attitude towards Mao's thought") and
 supervising the work performance of veteran cadres and
 diplomats, including nearly all of China's ambassadors
 recalled at the end of 1966 to take part in the Cultural
 Revolution.  As the principal spokesman for the career
 diplomats (e.g., his complaint in February 1967:  "Look
 what has happened to the ministry; there is no order,
 no organization and foreign affairs secrets have been
 taken away."), Foreign Minister Chen I would be sub-
 jected to a year-long campaign of Red Guard denunciation
 and attack for his courageous but unavailing effort to
 limit the authority of the "revolutionary Left" within
 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

 Of far greater import for China's foreign rela-
 tions during the Cultural Revolttion, however, was
 Mao's second decision to "revolutionize" the foreign
 affairs apparatus abroad.-' The effect of this decision,
 at least during the more extreme phases of the Cultural
 Revolution, was, in somewhat simplified terms, to con-
 vert China's embassies into centers for carrying the
 Cultural Revolution abroad.   This concept of "revolution-
 ary diplomacy," in itself a contradiction in terms, is
 so extraordinary that it deserves further discussion.
 To the extent that there is a reasoned, coherent
 explanation for this practice of revolutionary (or
 Red Guard) diplomacy, it appears to be integrally related
 to the rationale underlying the Cultural Revolution within
 China.  That rationale, as suggested earlier, was to
 explain opposition to Mao's thought and policies within
 China in terms of its "revisionist"/"capitalist" class
 nature, opposition which was therefore both illegitimate
 and, in the nature of things, bound to fail.  By analogy
 and extension, the opposition to Mao's revolutionary
 goals and ideological pretensions outside China (an op-
 position which by the fall of 1966 included practically
 every major government in the world) was explained in
 terms of its class nature as "capitalist," "revisionist"
 or "reactionary" and as therefore also illegitimate and
 bound to fail.  Both contributing to and resulting from
 China's position as an outcast in the international
 community, Mao's view of the world more as an arena of
 ven  a ore the Cultural Revolution was formally
 initiated, this decision was reflected by Chen I when
 he stressed (in a February 1986 speech to an ambassa-
 dorial-level conference in Peking) the need to indoctrinate
 Foreign Ministry personnel so that they would "remember
 that they are sent abroad to bring about world revolu-
 tion."

 "international class struggle" than as a community of
 nation states would dominate China's foreign relations
 during the Cultural Revolution.
 The new militancy of China's foreign policy
 stance was revealed in the 12 August 1966 communique
 adopted by the Central Committee plenum which formally
 initiated the Cultural Revol!ll ' ion.   In contrast with the
 more pragmatic and flexible formula advanced by Peking
 in June 1963 as the "general line for the foreign
 policy" of all socialist countries (a formula which
 in featuring "peaceful coexistence" as one of three
 "interrelated and indivisible" principles represented
 an adjustment to the realities of the nation-state
 system), this communique emphasized that "China's
 foreign policy" would be "guided" thereafter by the one
 "supreme principle" of "proletarian internationalism"
 (defined as "support for the revolutionary struggles
 of the people of all countries.")  That the new leader-
 ship selected at this Central Committee plenum favored
 a more active policy of promoting revolution abroad
 was also suggested by the central charge brought sub
 sequently against Liu Shao-chi in the field of foreign
 policy -  that prior to the Cultural Revolution he
 had advocated a "pacifist line" in foreign policy of
 "extinguishing the national liberation movement."
 The major premise underlying China's foreign
 policy during the Cultural Revolution .,,  that it would
 be possible by means of the extensive dissemination of
 Mao's thought to stimulate and promote revolution
 abroad -?  reflected a basic idealistic tendency in
 Maoism to overemphasize the role of consciousness
 and the subjective factor in the unfolding of history.
 This emphasis on "the active role of the ideological
 factor in the progress of history" was hailed by Chinese
 propagandists during the Cultural Revolution (e.g., the
 editorial in Red Flag, No. 15, 1967) as one of Mao's
 great contribuon.s-To the development of Marxist? Leninist

 manifesto, Lin did not discuss, however, the practical
 problem of how to persuade the peoples of these countries
 to "grasp" Mao's thought.
 The issue of the exportability of Mao's thought
 lay at the very heart of the struggle between the

 Reflecting the claim of universal validity for
 Mao's thought, this missionary effort encompassed
 hostile, neutral and friendly countries alike, the
 latter exemplified by North Korea and North Vietnam,
 both of which protested publicly in Party publications
 against this attempt to impose Maoist ideology on their
 own national movementso
 Expressing
 the same inner logic of the Red Guard movement within
 China, Peking's resort to Red Guard diplomacy appeared
 in essence to be an attempt to secure by intimidation
 what could not be gained through persuasion    namely,
 acknowledgement by the international Communist move-
 ment and the revolutionary peoples of the world of
 "Comrade Mao Tse-tung" as "the greatest teacher and
 most outstanding leader of the proletariat in the present
 era" and of "Mao Tse-tung's thought" as "Marxism-
 Leninism at its highest in the present era."
 The unfolding of Mao's Cultural Revolution had
 brought China by the summer of 1967 to the brink of
 anarchy.  A sharp turn even further to the Left in
 foreign policy (blamed subsequently on an "ultra-
 Leftist" seizure of power in the Foreign Ministry)
 culminated in the ransacking and burning of the British
 Chancery and the manhandling of the British Charge on
 22 August.  In domestic policy, the damaging effects
 of the new militancy of the revolutionary Left were
 equally if not more serious, threatening the unity and
 stability of the People's Liberation Army.  There was
 no choice in late August but to apply the brakes, pull
 back, assess the damage and initiate a trend toward
 moderation in the Cultural Revolution.
 One of the many ironies of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion is that the effort to propagate Mao's thought and
 thus promote revolution abroad had its greatest impact

 not in the countries of the Third World (developing the
 national liberation movement) nor in the countries of
 the socialist camp (strengthening the "Marxist-
 Leninist" forces) as predicted, but rather in the
 advanced industrialized countries of the world where
 the Chinese Communists had seen little or no chance
 for revolutionary uprisings,,  Still another is that the
 period of greatest influence of Maoist ideology on
 the student revolutionaries in West Europe and Japan
 came at a time (the spring and summer of 1968) when
 most of the radical elements in this ideology which
 particularly appealed to the forces of the New Left
 in the West had already been repudiated as "ultra-
 Leftist" and cast aside in China.
 Attracted by the elements of utopianism (the
 attacks on functional specialization, inequality, and
 the pursuit of self-interest), anarchism (symbolized by
 the slogan "to rebel is justified"), and student elitism
 (the vanguard role assigned to youthful Red Guards) in
 Mao's Cultural Revolution, the rebellious students of
 the New Left in France and Japan who rose up to seize
 control over their university campuses as a first step
 toward "revolutionizing" society were protesting what
 they considered to be serious defects in the organization
 and functioning of their advanced industrial societies,
 It was of little consequence to the leaders of the New
 Left that Mao's radical prescriptions were addressed
 not to the solution of these problems but rather toward
 solving a constellation of political, economic and
 social problems (in particular, the problem of restoring
 his own political and ideological authority) within
 China.
 Further illustrating the fortuitous nature of the
 influence of Maoism on the New Left, the anarchistic
 element in the Cultural Revolution which the revolutionary
 students found so appealing as an inspiration and
 justification for their own rebellion was directed not
 against bureaucratism and established authority as such,
 but against a specific example of bureaucratism -- namely,

 the unresponsiveness of the Chinese Communist "party
 machine" to Mao's revolutionary policies and programs.
 Also, the vanguard role which Mao assigned the Red
 Guards in the Cultural Revolution was both temporary
 and controlled, an example of directed "revolution
 from above" rather than of spontaneous "revolution from
 below."  Once they had performed their assigned function
 of exposing, criticizing and intimidating Mao's opponents
 within the Party (and had got clearly out of hand), Mao
 then ordered the Red Guards to be packed off unceremoniously
 to the countryside.
 Indeed, it is easy to exaggerate the influence
 of Maoist ideology on the student revolutionaries of
 the New Left.  In searching examinations of the intel-
 lectual roots of the New Left in the West, knowledgeable
 observers have traced the principal characteristics of
 this new type of revolutionary movement (a faith in
 utopia and a cult of violent action) as much to the
 writings of Che Guevara and Regis Debray (the theorists
 of "Castroism") and of Herbert Marcuse (the American
 ideological critic) as to those of Mao Tse-tung.*
 Analysis of the radical student movement in Japan,
 which resembles in many ways that of the New Left in
 the West, reveals, moreover, that its ideology has
 been influenced by Trotsky as much as or more than by
 Mao.**

 The most exaggerated estimates of the influence
 of Maoism on the New Left have been made by the Chinese
 themselves, eager to claim credit for the student
 rebellions in France (and elsewhere) as both confirming
 Mao's prediction that "a great new era of world revolu.,
 tion" was at hand and validating their undertaking during
 the Cultural Revolution (according to the People's
 Dail  editorial, "A Great Storm," 27 May 1     to "spur
 t e  evelopment...of the contemporary world revolution...
 [through]...the extensive dissemination of Mao Tse-tung's
 thought..."  But these claims, accompanied by a series
 of mass demonstrations in which 20 million Chinese
 participated, reflected the continuing effort by the
 revolutionary Left to use foreign events and the reaction
 of peoples abroad to help legitimate and support Mao's
 (and their own) claim to power within China,  It was at
 this low point in the international prestige of China
 and of Maoist ideology (its influence confined to
 Albania., a congery of "Marxist-Leninist" splinter parties
 and a portion of the New Left) that, as subsequently
 revealed, the Chinese leadership first gave serious
 thought to remedying what had become an intolerable
 position of isolation and weakness for China in a hostile
 world.

 The Turn to the
 Right
 Postscript to the Cultural. Revolution
 [They eay]...I am also one who 'would
 not change direction until he comes to
 the end of his wrong course' and 'once
 he turns, he turns 180 degrees.'
 -- Mao Tse-tung, Comment at the Lushan
 Conference, 1S August 1959.
 Chairman Mao teaches us:   'The
 Marxist philosophy of dialectical
 materialism has two outstanding
 characteristics.  One is its class
 nature...The other is its practicality.'
 -- People's Daily Editorial, "Conscien-
 tious y study ~iairman Mao's Philosophic
 Works," 30 October 1970.
 The turn to the Left in Maoist ideology which
 began in 1962 was basically a response to domestic poli-
 tical pressures., The turn to the Right which began
 hesitantly in the fall of 1967, and which has proceeded
 through several fairly well-defined stages up to the
 present, appears to have been stimulated to a significant
 extent by external pressures, specifically the growing
 military threat to China posed by the Soviet Union.  Al-
 though mounting pressure to solve a host of domestic
 political, economic and social problems no doubt played
 a more important part, the realization that, as a result
 of the provocative and self-defeating foreign policy of
 the Cultural Revolution, China stood isolated in the
 face of a major threat to its national security has had

 a particularly sobering effect on the Chinese leadership.
 As a result, Peking's propagandists in their interminable
 discourses on doctrine no longer emphasize the revolu-
 tionary, class-struggle aspect of Maoist ideology but
 rather (as noted above) its "practicality."
 The first stage in this painful and protracted
 process of retreating from Left to Right extended from
 the fall of 1967 through the summer of 1968 and was
 marked by the return of Premier Chou En-lai to a dominant
 role in foreign affairs.  Speaking to workers in this
 field in December 1967, Chou reminded his listeners that,
 like it or not, Peking had no choice but to deal with
 other countries primarily as sovereign states and govern-
 ments.  "In international relations," Chou said, "there
 are certain norms which we must respect.  A majority of the
 countries we deal with are imperialist, revisionist or
 reactionary, not Leftist."  Chou also quoted Mao as
 admitting (in a conversation with the Prime Minister
 of the Congo [B]) that China during the preceding summer
 had in its foreign relations been guilty of "great-power
 chauvinism."
 1 Peking Review discontinued publication
 of i s weekly column entitled "Mao Tse-tung's
 Thought Lights the Whole World."  Still another sign of
 Peking's growing sensitivity to foreign opinion was the
 admission not long thereafter in a National Day editorial
 (instead of insisting on the universal validity of China's
 revolutionary model) that it was necessary to "learn from
 the experience of revolutionary struggles of the peoples
 of all countries."

 The second stage in the trend toward moderation
 in Maoist ideology lasted from the Soviet invasion of
 Czechoslovakia in August 1968 to the first Sino-Soviet
 border clash in March 1969.  Peking's initial response
 to the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia was, in fact,
 in the extreme ideological and confrontationist tradition
 of the Cultural Revoluion,, consisting of an intensified
 attack on the Soviet leadership (now excoriated as "social-
 imperialist and social-fascist") and a solemn declaration
 (subsequently identified as Maoist) of the arrival of
 "a new historical stage of opposition to United States
 imperialism and Soviet revisionism."  At the same time,
 betraying apprehension that this Soviet military action
 in the name of safeguarding the interests of the "social-
 ist commonwealth" set a precedent which might later be
 used against China, Premier Chou En-lai asserted (in a
 2 September 1968 speech) that "the socialist camp" no
 longer existed and that it was therefore no longer pos-
 sible to "talk about the defense of 'socialist gains' and
 the 'socialist community."'  Peking's expression of will-
 ingness not long after this (in a 26 November Foreign
 Ministry statement) to resume talks with the United States
 at Warsaw, though tentative and later withdrawn, also
 revealed concern about the possibility of a military
 confrontation with the Soviet Union and the desirability
 of adopting a more flexible foreign policy stance at a
 time of national danger.
 The third stage, extending from the spring of
 1969 to the spring of 1970, encompassed a series of
 border clashes with the Soviet Union which appeared to
 confirm Peking's worst fears that a general military
 showdown with its powerful "revisionist" neighbor was
 at hand.  More than a decade earlier, Communist China
 had sought to persuade Moscow as leader of the socialist
 bloc to adopt a more militant policy against the United
 States (the main enemy).  This was followed by the
 increasingly Left extremist line of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, which had elevated the Soviet Union to a position
 rivaling the United States as China's principal enemy.
 Now the Soviet Union had replaced the United States as

 Chinas number one enemy, with up to a million men arrayed
 menacingly (as the Chinese would publicly protest) along
 the Sino-Soviet border.
 Reacting to this military threat posed by a vastly
 superior technologically modern army, Lin Piao revealed
 at the Ninth Party Congress in April 1969 Peking's inten-
 tion to return to the more flexible, multi-faceted "general
 line" which had characterized China's foreign policy be-
 fore the Cultural Revolution.  Lin pointed out that, in-
 stead of sole reliance on "proletarian internationalism"
 (the "supreme principle" which had guided China's foreign
 policy during the Cultural Revolution), Peking was now
 returning to the more broadly-based foreign policy formula
 of the June 1963 "general line" comprised of three "inter-
 related and indivisible" principles.  In addition to
 "proletarian internationalism" and support for the revolu-
 tionary struggles of oppressed peoples and nations, the
 third principle (the one of most immediate importance)
 was that of "peaceful coexistence" with countries having
 different social systems.  The utility, not to mention
 flexibility, of this concept of "peaceful coexistence"
 (based on mutual respect for territorial integrity and
 sovereignty) at a time of national 'weakness was soon
 demonstrated, when in October 1969 the scope of its ap-
 plication was extended to apply generally to all countries
 and in particular to the Soviet Union.
 Thus developments in 1969 support the judgment
 that the principal consideration prompting the Chinese
 Communist leadership to shift from a "revolutionary model"
 (featuring revolutionary armed struggle based on the
 Chinese model against bourgeois nationalist governments)
 to a "nationalist model" (featuring an international
 "united front" with bourgeois nationalist governments
 against a presumed common enemy) approach to foreign
 policy was a perceived sense of national weakness.  This
 shift would be completed in the fourth and final stage
 of what might be called post-Cultural Revoluion foreign
 policy, a stage beginning in May 1970 and extending down
 to the present time in which the features of China's
 new "nationalist model" of foreign policy making would
 be fully revealed.

 The emergence of the "nationalist model" approach
 to foreign policy in the past 18 months constitutes in
 important respects a "turn of 180 degrees" from the "revo-
 lutionary model" which had dominated China's foreign rela-
 tions during the Cultural Revolution.  Instead of a policy
 proclaiming the need to F:crnote revolution abroad in imita.,
 tion of the Chinese model of armed struggle, Peking now
 poses as the champion of national sovereignty, claiming
 (e.g. in the 23 January 1971 People's Dail  editorial)
 that it has always in its relations wit oer nations
 "faithfully abided by" Mao's injunction (delivered 14 years
 ago) to "practice the well-known Five Principles of mutual
 respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-
 aggression, non-interference in each others internal af-
 fairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexist-
 ence."  Instead of a policy directed at a largely fictitious
 constituency of "revolutionary Leftists" throughout the
 world committed to the Maoist goal of violent revolution,
 Peking has now reverted to the pre-Cultural Revolution
 Maoist concept of developing a broad international united
 front composed of governments and peoples (including, as
 witness the recent venture in "ping-pong diplomacy," even
 the people of the United States) against what it likes to
 call the "big nation hegemony" of the United States and
 the Soviet Union.  Instead of a policy relying primarily
 on ideolo?y (the export of Mao's thought) to promote
 China's revolutionary objectives, Peking now relies
 heavily on such material incentives as economic aid and
 trade to project its influence abroad.  Finally, instead
 of a policy based on such braod ideological considerations
 as promoting revolution abroad, Peking now pursues a policy
 defined more narrowly and pragmatically in terms of its
 own national interest.
 Despite the many parallels, it should be noted
 that China's present course in foreign policy has turned
 ever further to the Right than in the years immediately
 preceding the Cultural Revolution.  It is clear, for
 example, that Peking has profited from some of the mistakes
 it made in the Third World, especially in Africa, during

 this earlier period, and is now concentrating (as indi-
 cated by Kang Sheng in a mid-1970 briefing of foreign
 Communist Party leaders) more on diplomacy and state
 relations and less on insurgency and pro-Peking revolu-
 tionary groups in these areas.
 There are indications, moreover,that Peking in
 its rapprochement with North Korea and North Vietnam
 and Romania (not to mention the recent revival of diplo-
 matic and economic relations with that arch-revisionist
 nation, Yugoslavia) is adjusting to the reality of national
 Communism and is no longer exerting a major effort, as
 it did in the mid-1960's, to organize a new Internationale
 composed of Communist Parties subordinated to the ideological
 authority of a single center in Peking.  Illustrating this
 new appreciation of the realities of the international
 Communist movement, Peking no longer characterizes the
 Cultural Revolution as "a revolution of an international
 order" but as one largely confined in-its application to
 China.  What is more, authoritative ideological treatises
 on the status of the world Communist movement (e.g., the
 joint People's DailZ  Red Fla  and Liberation Arm  Daily
 editoria'-~"Lng Live tTie     ory of the Dicta ors ip of
 the Proletariat," 17 March 1971) now stress that for a
 revolution to be successful every "proletarian party" must
 "make concrete analysis of the present conditions and
 the history of its own country, and solve the theoretical
 and practical problems of the revolution in epen ent y.
 (underlining supplied)
 Although further to the Right than in the immediate
 pre-Cultural Revolution period, Communist China's current
 foreign policy strategy still differs in important respects
 from the "nationalist model" in what might be called its
 classic form during the period (1955-1956) when the "Bandung
 spirit" was at its height.  Whereas the original Bandung
 strategy called for a "united front from above" at the
 national level (with local Communist Parties instructed
 to seek a common front with the ruling national bourgeoisie)
 and thus implied the possibility of a "peaceful transition"

 to socialise,., Peking continues to insist today (as in the
 joint 17 March 1971 editorial noted above) that "violent
 revolution is a universal principle of proletarian revolu?,
 tion."  And despite the professed intention to conduct
 relations with all nations on the basis of "the Five Prin-?
 ciples of peaceful coexistence" (which exemplified the
 Bandung spirit) China still asserts (in the same joint
 editorial) that its foreign policy is also based upon the
 contradictory principle of "proletarian internationalism"
 that is,, "supporting... the revolutionary struggles of
 the people of other countries."
 The shift to the Right in domestic and foreign
 policy had become so pronounced by the fall of 1970 that
 it was necessary to explain to both domestic and foreign
 audiences why this shift had taken place.  In time-honored
 fashion  it was decided
 late August and early September 1970,   25X1
 to explain the excesses and violence and attendant policy
 failures of the Cultural Revolution as the work of an
 "ultra-Leftist group" headed by the leading Chinese Com-
 munist ideologue and long-time confidant of Mao, Chen Po-
 ta.  Resembling the political indoctrination campaign
 undertaken in the early 1960's to extricate Mao Tse-tung
 from personal responsibility for the Great Leap Forward
 debacle, a new campaign was initiated at the Second Plenum
 for the whole Party "to study Chairman Mao'-c philosophic
 works."  It was pointed out during this campaign (as, for
 example, in the 1 October 1970 National Day editorial) that
 "senior cadres" had been guilty of "idealistic and meta-
 physical" errors in their understanding of Mao's works
 and as a result had promoted an "ultra-Leftist" line during
 the Cultural Revolution.  This error of "Left opportunism,"
 according to an earlier definition by Chairman Mao, results
 generally from failure "to start from real life, to link
 oneself closely with the masses, to constantly sum up the
 experience of mass struggle and to examine ones work in the
 light of practical experience."  More succinctly and speci-
 fically, as indicated in an authoritative 30 October 1970

 People's DDaiil  editorial on the "study Mao" campaign, this
 error of "Leff opportunism" during the Cultural Revolution
 had resulted from the failure to realize that "the Marxist
 philosophy of dialectical materialism" (for which read
 Maoism) is characterized not only by "its class nature"
 but, of equal importance, by "its practicality."
 While the domestic audience could only piece to-
 gether what had happened by a close reading of murky
 ideological tracts, foreign audiences were treated to
 a much more revealing, if tendentious, account of recent
 Chinese Communist history in a series of interviews
 granted Edgar Snow by Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Premier
 Chou En-lai in the fall and winter of 1970.  In a fascinate
 ing discussion of his "cult of personality;," Mao described
 it as functional in origin, created "in order to stimulate
 the masses to dismantle the anti-Mao party bureaucracy"
 and thus enable him to regain "effective control" (which
 he had lost by 1964) over the Party and state administrative
 apparatus.  The cult had "of course...been overdone;" the
 extravagant claims made for Mao had been "a nuisance;"
 and he had countenanced some of the more extreme manifesta-
 tions of the cult (the slogans, pictures and plaster
 statues), it was implied, only because the Red Guards
 had "insisted."
 In addition to disavowing the excesses of the
 personality cult, Mao also emphasized that he had "highly
 disapproved" of the violence, the factional armed struggle
 and the resulting "great chaos" during the Cultural Revo-
 lution, much of it caused by the deceit and "lying" of
 those around him.  Another thing which had made the Chair-
 man "most unhappy" was "the maltreatment" of Party cadres
 by Red Guards and others during the Cultural Revolution,
 a prrct; ce which among other things "had slowed the re-
 building and transformation of the party."  Since Chen
 Po-ta, as head of the Cultural Revolution Group, had been
 entrusted with the task of purging and rebuilding the
 Party, the implication was clear that he, not Mao, had
 been responsible for much of the violence and extremism of
 the Cultural Revolution.  This implication was strengthened

 by the disclosure in another Snow article that "the task
 of reconstructing the dismantled state and Party adminis-
 trative apparatus" had now been entrusted to ("fell heavily
 on") Chou En-lai.
 Although it is hazardous to attempt to assign indi-
 vidual leaders to fixed positions in the Chinese political
 spectrum, it was symbolic that Chen Po-ta (the ideologue
 exemplifying the forces of the "revolutionary Left")
 should now have been replaced by Chou En-lai (regarded as
 the foremost exponent of pragmatism and moderation within
 the top Chinese leadership).  It was also indicative of
 the extent to which Maoist ideology, having veered sharply
 to the Left during the Cultural Revolution in an attempt
 to revolutionize Chinese society and in time the world,
 has once again (as it had a decade before) been forced to
 swing back sharply to the Right in adjusting to reality.

 function of Marxism-Leninism once it becomes the official

 of legitimizing the regime and its authority in the eyes
 not only of the Communist rulers themselves but of the

 becomes a self-justifying dogma, with doctrine manipulated

 the increasingly revolutionary and activist version of
 this doctrine which culminated in China's Cultural
 Revolution constituted a sharp swing to the Left.  The
 revival and intensification to unprecedented heights
 of a "cult of personality" which accompanied this shift
 to the Left exemplified, according to Chairman Mao him-
 self, the third function of Marxist-Leninist ideology of
 legitimizing and authorizing Mao Tse-tung's political
 rule in China.
 It would be a mistake, however, to think that Mao
 in the Cultural Revolution was only manipulating doctrine
 in order to outmaneuver and discredit his "revisionist"
 opposition.  There were genuine policy differences in the
 conflict between Mao and his opponents, differences
 which resulted from a divergent view of the nature of man
 and human society.  At issue was a fundamentally differ-
 ent assessment of the extent to which the human factor
 (man properly motivated) rather than the material factor
 (objective conditions) should be relied upon in making
 revolution and building socialism.  Since it is commonly
 recognized that there is a basic idealistic tendency in
 Maoism it is fair to conclude that, even though he has
 shown tactical realism in the face of necessity, Mao in
 this sense has always been a Leftist.
 In domestic policy, the dispute centered on the
 crucial question of whether it was possible to apply the
 same "mass line" approach which had proved so successful
 in the political and military struggles of the revolution
 to the more complicated task of attempting to modernize the
 backward economy and traditional society of China.  When
 (as Mao pointed out in a talk with foreign visitors dur-
 ing the Cultural Revolution) his "revisionist" opponents
 within China criticized this approach in the early 1960's
 as "anachronistic," Mao responded (in the joint People's Daily and Red Flag editorial article, "On Khrushc eTi s
 Phoney Communism and Its Historical Lessons for the World,"
 14 July 1964) by reasserting the necessity of "adhering to
 the mass line, [of] boldly arousing the masses and unfolding

 mass movements on a large scale...in both socialist revo-
 lution and socialist construction."  When carried to an
 extreme, this  Leftist "mass line" became the "ultra- Leftist"
 line, characterized by violence, armed sturggle anO near
 anarchy, of the Cultural Revolution at its height.
 In foreign policy, the dispute centered on the
 feasibility of attempting to promote revolution abroad
 by, among other means, exporting Mao's thought.  The
 abortive attempt to revive China's "revolutionary model"
 as a major instrument of foreign policy suggests that
 this Maoist model, in its failure to account for the
 basic factor of nationalism in the contemporary world,
 is also anachronistic.
 Although a secondary issue, there also appears to
 have been a difference of opinion concerning the proper
 tactics for conducting the Sino-Soviet dispute, with Mao
 insisting on more extreme measures (e.g. a complete rupture
 of relations and the establishment of a new Peking Inter-
 nationale) than his domestic "revisionist" opponents.  The
 failure of this attempt to reestablish a centralized inter-
 national Communist organization, the result of not recogniz-
 ing the reality and strength of national Communism, suggests
 that this Maoist model for organizing the world Communist
 movement is also outmoded.
 The basic cause for the failure of the Leftist ideo-
 logical offensive which Mao initiated nearly a decade ago
 was the complexity and intractability of the real world.
 Although all the returns are not yet in, the end result of
 Mao's attempt to revolutionize his own society by intimida-
 tion and coercion appears to be, as one observer has put
 it, a "utopia... run by the army."  Although again all the
 returns are not yet in, the end result of the concurrent
 attempt during the Cultural Revolution to revolutionize
 the world appears to be that the outside world, by exerting
 a moderating influence on that ideology, has triumphed over
 the utopian version of Maoism.

 But what are the future prospects in the continuing
 interplay between the international impact of Maoist
 ideology and the reciprocal impact of developments abroad
 upon the substance and political coloration of that ideology?
 In the short term, there are still opportunities for
 Chinese diplomatic gains which Peking could achieve rather
 easily by persisting in its present course in foreign pclicy
 characterized by the pragmatism and maneuverability that
 have been so apparent since mid-1970.  In time, however,
 it should become apparent that these diplomatic victories
 will not in themselves significantly enhance China's
 capacity to project its influence abroad in the manner
 of a major power.  In view of the limitations (e.g. economic
 underdevelopment and domestic political problems) which
 will continue to restrict China's influence in the inter-
 national community, there may be yet another turn to the
 Left (especially if Mao continues to dominate the govern-
 ment and people of China) in an attempt to surmount these
 limitations and advance once again toward Mao's revolu-
 tionary goals.
