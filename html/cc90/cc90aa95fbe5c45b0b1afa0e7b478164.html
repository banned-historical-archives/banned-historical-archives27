 VIETNAM
 Communist negotiators in Paris this week dis-
 played a readiness to move into substantive
 talks as soon as possible.   They refrained from
 delaying tactics, agreed to compromises on pro-
 cedures and proposed the meetings get under way
 immediately.   Their propaganda campaign tactics
 are directed against Saigon, clearly to isolate
 the government from its people and from Washing-
 ton.   In Vietnam, President Thieu plans to make
 some cabinet changes, and to stage elections in
 villages and hamlets; both plans with the idea
 of strengthening the government.

 CONFUSION MOUNTS IN PEKING
 Political affairs in Peking are being con-
 ducted with unusual secrecy, raising suspi-
 cions that major, unpublicized shifts are tak-
 ing place.
 PEKING IMPROVING ITS COASTAL DEFENSE FORCES
 New hydrofoil gunboats and torpedo boats of
 native design are being built, and some may
 be deployed later this year.   They can operate
 at high speeds in moderately rough seas while
 remaining relatively stable.

 NATO DEFENSE MINISTERS REACH ONLY LIMITED AGREEMENT        12
 It was clear at the NATO defense ministers'
 meeting in Brussels last week that the Czecho-
 slovak crisis has not overcome allied inertia.
 Although the 14 participating governments ap-
 proved NATO force levels through 1973 and the
 establishment of an on-call naval force for the
 Mediterranean, they left a number of substantial
 problems unresolved.
 DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY FOR A MIDDLE EAST SETTLEMENT
 MOUNTS
 France, pushing for four-power talks, has sug-
 gested the US, UK, USSR, and French Security
 Council representatives meet to consider ways
 of implementing the Council's Middle East reso-
 lution.
 SOVIETS PRESS BONN ON ELECTION PLAN
 With varying degrees of subtlety,  the Soviets
 have stepped up their diplomatic pressure on
 Bonn and the Allies to get West Germany to back
 off from its plans to hold an election in Berlin
 on 5 March for a federal president.
 CZECHOSLOVAK POPULAR PROTESTS POSE DOMESTIC CRISIS          15
 Dubcek and his colleagues have become embroiled
 in a potentially dangerous situation as a result
 of anti-Soviet demonstrations which may reach a
 climax in the next few days and get out of con-
 trol.

 The successful flights of Soyuz 4 and 5 have
 demonstrated that the Soyuz vehicle could be
 used in future operations related to manned
 orbital space stations, and that the vehicle
 itself is ready to be used as a small space
 station.
 POLISH PARTY CHIEF DEALS WITH NATIONALIST CHALLENGER       18
 Gomulka is moving to reduce the power and in-
 fluence of his main rival, the hard-line na-
 tionalist, Mieczyslaw Moczar.   Personnel changes
 in conservative provincial party organizations
 and the reported ouster of various Moczar sup-
 porters from the Interior Ministry probably re-
 flect his reduced influence in the ministry he
 once headed.

 ANTI-US SENTIMENT GROWING IN NIGERIA
 Anti-US sentiment is growing in federal Nigeria
 as a result of the Biafran relief issue.   On
 the war front, a new federal offensive is pend-

 INDIA INTENDS TO STRENGTHEN ITS HELICOPTER FORCE
 India wants to increase its helicopter force
 from 175 to 300 aircraft by the mid-1970s to
 acquire a multimission capability useful against
 tribal rebellions in the northeast and for inci-
 dents with Pakistan and China.
 INDIA AND IRAN MUTUALLY BENEFIT FROM SHAH'S VISIT           23
 India's extravagant and carefully calculated re-
 ception for the Shah capped a year of mutual ef-
 forts toward improved bilateral relations and
 served the desires of both governments to make
 an impact on the regional diplomatic scene.
 SHAH AWAITS ARAB RESPONSE TO PERSIAN GULF GAMBIT
 The Shah's announced willingness to compromise
 on Iran's claim to the island of Bahrain has not
 generated any motion toward a general settlement
 of the conflicting territorial claims in the
 Persian Gulf area.

 Communist negotiators in Paris have indicated both in public and
 private that they are ready for serious discussions. Withdrawal of US forces is
 Hanoi's primary interest, but the Communists maintain that military and
 political problems must be considered together. Hanoi's spokesmen also
 uniformly stress that the present Saigon government must be replaced by a
 "peace cabinet."
 Stepped up Communist attacks in South Vietnam during the past week
 were presumably intended to project an image of strength as the new US
 administration took office and new meetings began in Paris.
 President Thieu plans to make some changes in the South Vietnamese
 cabinet within the next month or two to strengthen the government while it
 participates in the Paris talks. He mainly wants new men in ministries that
 deal with the domestic economy. Prime Minister Huong will apparently stay.
 The usual secrecy with which political affairs are being carried on in
 Peking has raised suspicions that major, unpublicized shifts are taking place.
 Peking is full of rumors about ferment within the inner circle of leaders. It is
 likely that the ninth party congress now may be postponed until late spring;
 Mao is said to have favored a meeting as early as February.
 In Laos, the military situation was generally quiet this past week. Only
 patrol and light probing activity occurred as the Communists prepare for the
 next round of their dry season offensive.
 Violence at Japanese universities may develop into a major challenge to
 Prime Minister Sato's government. Mounting public concern stems not only
 from the breakdown of order that has disrupted operations at 50 schools
 throughout the country but also from the very real threat to students'
 careers posed by the violence. The most radical student agitators are using
 the struggle with school authorities to test tactics for their planned campaign
 of violence against extension of the US-Japan security agreement in
 1970.

 VIETNAM
 Communist negotiators in
 Paris again this week displayed
 a readiness to move into substan-
 tive talks as soon as possible.
 Their performance at the proce-
 dural meeting on 18 January fur-
 thered the impression that the Com-
 munists believe the time is ripe
 for taking up the specifics of
 a negotiated settlement.   The Com-
 munist side refrained from delay-
 ing tactics, readily agreed to
 compromises on procedures, and
 proposed that the new meetings
 get under way immediately.
 Influential members of the
 Hanoi delegation in Paris have
 privately begun to pass the word
 that the Communists are prepared
 for serious and constructive dis-
 cussions about both political and
 military matters.   They tell
 friendly journalists that they
 are prepared to be flexible and
 reasonable, and that they will
 entertain suggestions and "pack-
 age deals" from all sides.   They
 stress that withdrawal of US
 forces is Hanoi's first and pri-
 mary interest, but Ha Van Lau re-
 cently indicated that military
 and political problems must be
 considered simultaneously.
 These Hanoi spokesmen also
 uniformly stress that the present
 Saigon government must be replaced
 by a "peace cabinet."  Their tac-
 tics clearly are designed to iso-
 late the South Vietnamese Govern-
 ment, both from its own consti-
 tuency and from Washington, by
 portraying the leadership in Sai-
 gon as the only obstacle to peace.
 The spokesmen are suggesting
 bluntly that it is in the US in-
 terest to change the composition
 of the South Vietnamese Govern-
 ment and that progress in the
 negotiations probably will hinge
 on such change.   This propaganda
 campaign is being authoritatively
 expounded as Communist strategy
 in the coming months and it is
 accompanied by strenuous efforts
 to step up pressures on the Thieu-
 Ky regime.
 Political Developments in
 South Vietnam
 President Thieu is planning
 to make some cabinet changes
 within the next month or two to
 strengthen the government while
 it participates in the Paris talks.
 He mainly wants to put new men in
 charge of ministries such as agri-
 culture and public works that deal
 with the domestic economy.   He
 reportedly is less concerned about
 those ministries dealing with se-
 curity matters,  such as defense
 and foreign affairs.   Although
 rumors of such impending cabinet
 changes are fairly widespread in
 Saigon, Thieu is keeping his cards
 close to his chest.
 Prime Minister Huong has some
 powerful critics, including Vice

 President Ky, but he apparently
 will stay.     Thieu trusts Huong
 and has developed a good working
 relationship with him,  and Thieu
 wants to minimize any appearance
 of instability at the top.!
 Ky is expected to return to
 Paris for the beginning of the
 substantive meetings there.   He
 may, however, stay for only a
 week or so because he would like
 to be in Saigon to exert more in-
 fluence when any new appointments
 are made.
 Although Thieu and Huong
 seem to agree that men with more
 political prestige should be
 brought into the government, it
 will be difficult to find such
 men who also possess the neces-
 sary administrative abilities.
 The field of prospective appointees
 will be further narrowed by the re-
 quirement that they help the gov-
 ernment's ongoing effort to re-
 duce corruption, especially in
 those ministries dealing with the
 domestic economy.
 Thieu hopes to strengthen the
 government's position in the coun-
 tryside by staging elections for
 some local officials.  All vil-
 lages and hamlets having temporary
 administrative committees in the
 relatively secure and contested
 areas are scheduled to hold popu-
 lar elections to choose new local
 officials.   These would be the
 first such local elections to be
 attempted since early 1967.
 Military Developments in
 South Vietnam
 Ground action picked up con-
 siderably during the week as the
 Communists staged mortar and rocket
 barrages and small ground probes
 in several parts of the country.
 The attacks were presumably
 intended to project an image of

 Communist strength as the new US
 administration took office and
 the new meetings began in Paris.
 The Communists probably also hope
 that these actions will help
 them regain the initiative in
 the countryside, where allied
 pacification efforts have been
 making progress in recent months.
 The main weight of the enemy
 attacks was felt in the provinces
 northwest of Saigon.   From 16 to
 19 January, nearly 25 separate
 shellings were reported against
 allied outposts  in Tay Ninh Prov-
 i_nce alone.   Elsewhere,  there
 were a number of mortar and
 :rocket attacks and the Communists
 probed several. US and South Viet-
 namese installations near Da Nang,
 Ban Me Thuot,and Loc Ninh with
 sapper attacks.
 Allied casualties,  196 US
 and over 300ISouth Vietnamese
 soldiers killed in the week end-
 ing 18 January, were higher than
 in recent weeks, even though many
 enemy barrages were executed
 hurriedly.   Damage caused by the
 attacks was generally light ex-
 cept in the delta, where more
 than 60 US helicopters were
 damaged or destroyed by Viet Cong
 mortars.   The Communists are re-
 lying mainly on such shellings
 in the current offensive phase
 and,  in an apparent effort to
 conserve manpower, have not com-
 mitted any large main force units
 to ground assaults.   Neverthe-
 less, enemy losses for the week,
 about 2,700 dead, were higher
 than they have been for nearly
 two months.
 Although some            have
 reported that the Communists in-
 tend to follow up the recent at-
 tacks with thrusts at Saigon and
 other major cities, they do not
 appear to be in position to carry
 out such an offensive soon.   In
 III Corps, main force regiments
 continue to edge closer to Saigon
 but allied spoiling operations
 are causing them considerable
 difficulties.   The Communists
 are capable of launching strong
 assaults in northwest III Corps
 with little warning, however, and
 there are persistent reports of     25X1''
 enemy attempts to infiltrate sap-
 pers and agitators into Saigon
 and other cities.

 COMMUNIST MILITARY ACTIVITY IN LAOS IS IN A LULL
 The military situation is quiet
 as the Communists prepare for the
 next round of their dry season of-
 fensive.
 Only light skirmishing and
 patrol activity has taken place dur-
 ing the past week near the Bolovens
 Plateau, where the heaviest fight-
 ing of the two-month-old Communist
 offensive has taken place.   Three
 North Vietnamese battalions remain
 dug in around Ban Thateng, but no
 effort has been made to bring ad-
 ditional pressure on the base's
 tired defenders.  Heavy air strikes
 and government guerrilla operations
 are helping to keep back the Com-
 munists; the North Vietnamese may
 not be willing to run the risk of
 another costly all-out assault.
 In the north, small numbers
 of Communist troops have been prob-
 ing outlying government positions
 defending the key guerrilla base at
 Na Khang.   The guerrillas have re-
 sponded by clearing the enemy from
 some positions which were able to
 hit the base's airstrip with mor-
 tars, while a government spoiling
 operation south of the base has
 temporarily blunted a Communist
 push between Na Khang and the Plaine
 des Jarres.
 Meanwhile, the Pathet Lao mis-
 sion in Vientiane received some
 rough treatment last weekend.   Up-
 set over the embarrassing ease with
 which the Communists blew up a ma-
 jor ammunition dump outside the cap-
 ital last week, Vientiane commander
 General Kouprasith had a grenade
 thrown into the Pathet Lao compound
 and several Pathet Lao security
 troops severely beaten.
 It is not clear whether Prime
 Minister Souvanna sanctioned these
 activities, although he apparently
 has formally asked the International
 Control Commission to request the
 withdrawal of the Pathet Lao from
 Vientiane.   It seems likely, how-
 ever, that cooler heads will even-
 tually prevail and the harassments
 will be called off.   The Pathet Lao,
 who have suffered similar abuse in
 the past, have asked for increased
 protection from the control com-
 mission, but so far give no evi-
 dence of wanting to quit the cap-
 ital.

 STUDENT STRIFE POSES HAZARDS FOR JAPANESE GOVERNMENT
 Violence at Japanese univer-
 sities may develop into a major
 challenge to Prime Minister Sato's
 government.
 Radical factions of the Zeng-
 akuren, a leftist student con-
 federation, regard the struggle
 with university authorities over
 educational policies and adminis-
 tration as only a preliminary
 skirmish in their battle with the
 Japanese "establishment," their
 main target.   In provoking campus
 disorders throughout the current
 academic year, Zengakuren mili-
 tants are testing tactics for
 their planned campaign of vio-
 lence against the extension of
 the US-Japan security agreement
 in 1970.
 A long-standing rivalry
 within Zengakuren has again
 erupted into a bitter power strug-
 gle between those supporting the
 Japan Communist Party and those
 backing more extreme Trotskyite
 tactics.   In an effort to isolate
 their radical rivals, pro-Commu-
 nist Zengakuren factions have
 joined with politically neutral,
 moderate elements of the student
 body in seeking an accommodation
 with school authorities.   Thus
 far, however,  the Trotskyite fac-
 tions have prevented any easing
 of the situation.
 SECRET
 Students are currently dis-
 rupting normal operations in some
 50 schools throughout the country,
 including Kyoto and Tokyo uni-
 versities;  the latter is Japan's
 most prestigious educational in-
 stitution.   Public concern is
 increasing because of the break-
 down of order at the schools and
 the very real threat to students'
 careers posed by the wave of vio-
 lence.  Although the police suc-
 cessfully quelled disorders at
 Tokyo University last weekend,
 the school has been heavily
 damaged and the government has
 been forced to cancel examina-
 tions for the next freshman class.
 The importance which the
 Japan Communist Party attaches
 to gaining control of the student
 movement was underlined by the
 party's heavy funding of the pro-
 Communist student group at Tokyo
 University and the personal di-
 rection by Secretary General
 Miyamoto of the students' tac-
 tics during the disturbances.
 By calling for an end to the
 confrontation with school author-
 ities, the factions controlled
 by the JCP are seeking to create
 a moderate and responsible image
 for the Party to strengthen its
 influence among students, intel-
 lectuals, and the general public.

 CONFUSION MOUNTS IN PEKING
 Political affairs in Peking
 are being conducted with unusual
 secrecy, raising suspicions that
 major, unpublicized shifts are
 taking place.   The inner circle
 of leaders around Mao Tse-tung
 continues to be out of public
 view; they have not made a col-
 lective appearance since the Na-
 tional Day period last October.
 Peking is full of rumors about
 ferment within this group.
 a     op
 leaders, except Mao and his chief
 inquisitor Kang Sheng, confessed
 to errors at a rally held in early
 January to mark "the beginning of
 the conclusion of the Cultural
 Revolution."  Defense Minister
 and heir apparent Lin Piao said
 that people had been purged who
 should not have been, and all ma-
 jor figures there, including Mao's
 wife, admitted that mistakes had
 been made in the Cultural Revolu-
 tion.   The intent of these state-
 ments presumably was to lay the
 groundwork for reversing the main
 thrust of the Cultural Revolution
 and closing it out.   To underscore
 this point, one speaker reportedly
 produced at the rally was former
 party general secretary Teng
 Hsiao-ping, who has been fre-
 quently reviled in official prop-
 aganda, along with the "villain-
 ous" Liu Shao-chi, as a "top party
 person taking the capitalist
 road."
 The symbolic rehabilitation
 of Teng, who was stripped of au-
 thority in the summer of 1966,
 would encourage other party offi-
 cials victimized during the Cul-
 tural Revolution to seek redress.
 Arguments over possible re-
 habilitations and other conten-
 tious issues may have forced post-
 ponement of the ninth party con
 gress.   Mao Tse-tung is said to
 have personally favored holding
 the congress in February and prep-
 arations for a meeting at an early
 date continue to be noted.   Some
 reports, however, state that the
 date has now been put back--pos-
 sibly until late spring.
 Recent outbreaks of fighting
 have been reported from several
 provinces where order was restored
 last fall.   The renewed fighting
 presumably is a direct reflection
 of political struggles going on
 at the provincial level.   These
 struggles were muted last fall,
 when Peking was insisting on a
 show of unity, but were never far
 below the surface.   It is likely
 that top men in the central govern-
 ment have been too preoccupied in
 recent weeks with their own dis-
 agreements to keep the lid on pro-
 vincial disputes and, as a result,
 open conflict has broken out in
 some areas. F_                   I

 PEKING IMPROVING ITS COASTAL DEFENSE FORCES
 Communist China is continu-
 ing to improve its coastal de-
 fense forces by building new
 hydrofoil gunboats of native de-
 sign.   Production is now under
 way, and some of the new patrol
 boats--designated the Shan-tung--
 probably will be deployed with
 coastal defense forces later
 this year.   The Shan-tung may
 have a top speed of about 50
 knots and probably will gradually
 replace slower motor gunboats
 built until the early 1960s.
 Testing of hydrofoil boats
 of unique Chinese design began
 several years ago.   Hydrofoil
 torpedo boats, designated as
 Hu-chwan, have been in series
 production since at least 1966,
 and about 65 have been deployed
 to the three fleet areas.
 Both the Shan-tung and the
 Hu-chwan are equipped only with
 forward foils and can perform
 better than nonhydrofoil craft.
 They can operate at high speeds
 in moderately rough seas and re-
 main relatively stable while
 doing so.   In time, the Chinese
 may incorporate this principle
 on other types of small coastal
 defense craft.
 The Chinese coastal defense
 force, charged with defending
 against raids and attacks and
 protecting China's coastal
 shipping and fishing fleets, has
 improved steadily since the
 early 1960s.   By the early 1970s,
 the force will be equipped with
 several hundred modern patrol
 craft, including the hydrofoil
 gunboats and torpedo boats,
 guided missile patrol boats,
 and fast patrol boats.                  25X1

 The Soviet leaders returned from vacations this week to face a variety
 of problems. The situation in Czechoslovakia-where the popular temper
 seemed close to getting out of control-has put the Soviet policy of slowly
 applying political pressure to a severe test. Thus far, Soviet occupation
 troops have stayed clear of direct involvement, but there was some evidence
 that they had made themselves ready if called upon.
 Meanwhile, Moscow issued a relatively warm greeting for the new US
 administration. It took the opportunity to publicize again Soviet readiness to
 discuss a limitation on strategic arms.
 The shock of the week was the shooting in Red Square which took the
 sheen off a highly publicized ceremony designed to emulate the US welcome
 of its astronauts. Facts on the shooting are few, but since the bullets hit the
 second car in the parade rather than the open first car carrying the cosmo-
 nauts, the target may actually have been the Soviet leaders. There is no
 evidence to refute Soviet claims that this was the act of a single individual,
 but repercussions may be broad. Not the least of these will be the damper it
 puts on Soviet propaganda exploitation of similar events in the US.
 The timing of planned Warsaw Pact and CEMA summit meetings is still
 up in the air. The most recent story, provided by the Polish ambassador in
 Bucharest, has the Pact meeting taking place by the end of January with the
 economic summit to follow at a later but unspecified date. The CEMA
 Council and Executive Committee began meetings in East Berlin on 21
 January. They will probably try to accommodate the divergent views of
 members on economic integration in order to prepare for the summit
 meeting.
 President de Gaulle promptly spiked rumors that he might step down
 by announcing that he intends to remain in office until his term expires in
 1972. The rumors had been set off by former premier Pompidou's statement
 that he would be a presidential candidate when the general retires.

 NATO DEFENSE MINISTERS REACH ONLY LIMITED AGREEMENT
 It was clear at the NATO de-
 fense ministers' meeting in Brus-
 sels last week that the Czech-
 oslovak crisis has not overcome
 allied inertia.   Although the 14
 participating governments approved
 NATO force levels through 1973
 and the establishment of an on-
 call naval force for the Mediter-
 ranean, they left a number of
 substantial problems unresolved.
 Despite their support for
 the on-call naval force, the al-
 lies agreed only "to remand for
 further consideration" the crucial
 issue of its control.   Most of
 them were ready to adopt "activa-
 tion procedures" similar to those
 which govern the existing on-call
 force for the. Atlantic, where an
 ally may take limited initial
 action under NATO auspices with-
 out prior collective approval.
 force must be subject to allied
 political control at all times
 inasmuch as it would serve largely
 as a "political gesture" demon-
 strating allied solidarity.
 Most of the allies pledged
 some defense improvements for the
 1969 period beyond what had been
 envisaged before the invasion of
 Czechoslovakia, but none were
 particularly interested in im-
 proving mobilization and rein-
 forcement procedures.   Britain's
 Defense Secretary Healey, more-
 over, raised questions about the
 real value of further conven-
 tional contributions.   Apparently
 to improve his image as a "good
 European" he repeated the view-
 point so often heard on the con-
 tinent that NATO would in fact
 have to resort to tactical nu-
 clear weapons soon after the out-
 break of a major conflict.
 Somewhat paradoxically, he
 also echoed a familiar German
 refrain calling for a complete
 assessment of relative NATO - War-
 saw Pact capabilities before any
 change in allied troop levels.
 The Germans, whose support London
 seeks in its drive to get into
 the Common Market, have recently
 stressed the need for this in an
 effort to delay consideration of
 mutual NATO - Warsaw Pact force
 reductions.
 Healey also used the occasion
 to promote the idea of a European
 caucus for NATO, which Britain
 has long supported as a means of
 improving its ties with the conti-
 nent.   His efforts to please
 everybody, however, may have
 created new complications.   In
 an effort to allay German fears
 over a possible fragmentation of
 NATO he proposed that any future
 European grouping be expanded
 to include Greece and Turkey as
 well as the Scandinavian NATO
 members.   In so doing, however,
 he abandoned the original con-
 cept of the caucus as a meeting
 ground for EEC members and those
 countries which had applied for
 membership.   This in turn may
 lead to greater diversity in the
 purposes envisioned for the Euro-
 pean grouping and perhaps a duplica-
 tion of NATO agencies and activ-
 ities.

 DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY FOR A MIDDLE EAST SETTLEMENT MOUNTS
 There has been increased
 diplomatic activity for a polit-
 ical settlement in the Middle
 East, amid some signs that Arab
 expectations of an imminent Is-
 raeli attack are diminishing.
 France suggested last week
 that the Security Council repre-
 sentatives of the US, UK, USSR,
 and France meet later this month
 to study ways to implement the
 Council's Middle East resolution
 of 22 November 1967.   The French
 note singled out the Soviet "peace
 plan" of 30 December as one sub-
 ject of the big-power talks.
 Paris has been pushing for four-
 power action since the 1967 war,
 hoping to play a major role in
 any Arab-Israeli political set-
 tlement.
 The Soviet Union quickly
 agreed to attend, although Mos-
 cow probably still favors bilat-
 eral talks with the US.   The
 French proposal would accommodate
 Arab interests, however, and a
 Soviet diplomat in Paris told the
 US deputy chief of mission there
 that Moscow had accepted "to
 please" the French.
 Actually, the Soviets would
 view British and French participa-
 tion in any discussion of a set-
 tlement as a way to put additional
 pressure on Israel as well as the
 US.   Britain's interest in the
 reopening of the Suez Canal, and
 France's wish to score diplomatic
 points in the Arab world are not
 lost on the Soviet Union.   Above
 all, Soviet prestige would be
 greatly enhanced if such talks
 led to a softening of the Is-
 raeli position.
 On the same day that the
 Soviets accepted the French pro-
 posal, they called in US, UK,
 and French diplomats to pass along
 an Iraqi report of an imminent
 Israeli attack, and to query the
 Western nations on Israeli inten-
 tions.   The Soviets may have been
 playing on tensions to elicit a
 favorable response to their "peace
 plan," and the French suggestion
 for four-power talks.   Recent Is-
 raeli military exercises probably
 also contributed to the sharp in-
 crease in Arab nervousness.   It
 is not clear to what extent the
 Iraqi report was based on Soviet
 information.
 In any event, claims of an
 Israeli buildup   are unfounded,
 and there are some indications
 that the tenseness in the Arab
 countries is easing.                    25X1_

 SOVIETS PRESS BONN ON ELECTION PLAN
 The Soviets have stepped up
 their diplomatic pressure on Bonn
 and the Allies in an effort to
 get West Germany to back down on
 its choice of West Berlin as the
 site for the election on 5 March
 of a new federal president.   Mos-
 cow, at this stage, appears pri-
 marily interested in playing upon
 West German and Allied differ-
 ences over the issue.
 The familiar Soviet practice
 of differentiating between the
 Allies has been evident, begin-
 ning with the low-key oral pro-
 tests on 23 December to the US,
 British, and French ambassadors
 in Moscow.   The statement to
 France was even more moderate
 than those given the US and UK.
 It softened a reference to the
 possibility of retaliatory meas-
 ures by adding that the Soviets
 preferred that events not move
 in that direction.   A Soviet For-
 eign Ministry official casually
 mentioned the election again when
 the Franco-Soviet "Grande Commis-
 sion" met in Paris earlier this
 month.
 The Soviet ambassador in
 East Berlin rhetorically asked
 the outgoing US ambassador to
 Bonn why the US permitted Bonn
 to use the election to sow dis-
 cord between Moscow and Washing-
 ton.   He gave an impression of
 Soviet restraint, but did not ex-
 clude a "strong reaction" to the
 event.
 The Soviets were also even-
 handed in contacts with the West
 Germans in Moscow and Bonn.   They
 reiterated their objections to
 the election, but hinted as well
 at an improved dialogue with Bonn
 on other matters, including a
 civil air agreement and the ex-
 change of declarations on nonuse
 of force.
 As the election date draws
 closer, Moscow's protests grow
 stronger.   The Soviets told West
 German Foreign Minister Brandt
 on 10 January that the election
 would "aggravate relations" be-
 tween Bonn and Moscow.   On 14 Jan-
 uary they asked the British am-
 bassador in Bonn to intercede with
 Brandt and to warn him that the
 election was likely to provoke So-
 viet reprisals.
 The Soviets seemed concerned
 during these contacts that Bonn
 might misinterpret the lack of
 harassment of West German politi-
 cal and parliamentary meetings in
 Berlin last fall.   Moscow clearly
 fears that its forbearance at that
 time has been read in the West as
 Soviet acquiescence in West German
 activities designed to demonstrate
 Bonn-Berlin ties.
 A factor certain to weigh
 heavily in Moscow's plans will be
 its assessment of the new US ad-
 ministration's attitude toward
 the election and the effect of
 serious Berlin troubles on the
 US-Soviet dialogue Moscow is
 seeking.
 In the end, the Soviets may
 settle for some West German po-
 litical concession to "counter-
 balance" the election.   An East
 European diplomat suggested that
 Bonn might find in its civil air
 talks with Moscow an opportunity
 to win Soviet tolerance of the
 election.

 CZECHOSLOVAK POPULAR PROTESTS POSE DOMESTIC CRISIS
 Dubcek and his colleagues have
 become embroiled in a potentially
 dangerous situation as a result of
 anti-Soviet demonstrations which
 may reach a climax in the next few
 days and get out of control.   Stu-
 dent demonstrations between 18-20
 January and an alleged suicide pact
 among Czechoslovak youths, who in-
 tend to set themselves ablaze to
 protest Soviet interference in do-
 mestic af fairs, ended a period of
 relative calm in Czechoslovakia.
 Thousands of disaffected youths,
 joined by some workers and univer-
 sity officials, marched on 20 Jan-
 uary in memory of Jan Palach, a
 21-year-old student who committed
 suicide by fire to protest censor-
 ship and the continued existence of
 an illegal pro-Soviet publication.
 His martyrdom has aroused the en-
 tire population,  sparking other pro-
 tests and bringing more demands.
 Palach will be given a hero's
 funeral on 25 January--apparently
 a concessionary gesture by the re-
 gime--and  be  buried in an exclu-
 sive area alongside the country's
 greatest composers,  intellectuals,
 and writers.   The ceremony, which
 may draw as many as 100,000, will
 attract youths from all over the
 country who are intent on demon-
 strating in Prague.   Three other
 self-immolation attempts--even
 though apparently for personal
 rather than political reasons--
 have added to popular tensions.
 Top party and government lead-
 ers, who met with university offi-
 cials in an effort to mollify the
 students, must come up with some
 type of compromise satisfactory
 to the students, or face the pos-
 sibility of other suicide attempts
 and demonstrations.
 In an attempt to discourage
 further public gatherings,  the
 popular and respected President
 Svoboda has warned that riots and
 strikes could cost thousands of
 lives and could bring down the
 Dubcek leadership.  Premier Cernik
 branded some of the student ac-
 tions  "antisocialist" and said
 that the security police would
 have to clamp down on any anti-
 Soviet disturbances.   Defense Min-
 ister Dzur implied that the armed
 forces were ready to put down any
 outbursts.
 The students, who have the
 support of the workers and the in-
 tellectuals, met with trade union
 officials this week to coordinate
 future activities.  The student
 actions thus far have been non-
 violent, but the authorities can
 no longer count on this to con-
 tinue.  The unexpected return to
 Czechoslovakia of two popular pro-
 gressives--economist Ota Sik and
 former writers' union president
 Goldstucker--may have some posi-
 tive effect on efforts to calm
 the students.
 The Soviet press reported the
 first immolation on Tuesday with
 brief news items.   It also charged
 that "antisocialist forces" were
 trying to exploit the situation,
 and quoted Czechoslovak officials
 as saying that the demonstrations
 were "directly contrary" to norma-
 lization efforts.   Pravda said, how-
 ever,  that the Czechoslovak lead-
 ership was determined to take stern

 action to quash further disturbances.
 This formulation carried an implicit
 warning that Prague had better do
 just that and the Soviets are keep-
 ing a close eye on the situation.
 Thus far there has been no reaction
 by Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia
 but that prospect is always present
 if the situation should get out of
 the control of the Czechoslovak au-
 thorities.
 SOVIETS MOVE TOWARD SPACE STATION CAPABILITY
 The docking of two manned
 spacecraft, the testing of new
 equipment for extravehicular
 use, and the transfer of crew-
 men from one spacecraft to an-
 other during the flight of Soyuz
 4 and 5 last week demonstrated
 the capability of the Soyuz ve-
 hicle to participate in future
 operations related to manned or-
 bital space stations.   In addi-
 tion, the Soyuz spacecraft it-
 self is now ready to be used as
 a small space laboratory.
 Without resupply, a single
 manned Soyuz probably could re-
 main in orbit for approximately
 40 days.   Two vehicles linked to-
 gether--another possible config-
 uration for a small Soviet space
 laboratory--could sustain three
 men in orbit for about three
 months without resupply.
 a Soyuz-type
 space station could be resupplied
 by other Soyuz craft, thereby
 extending the lifetime of an or-
 biting laboratory.   By mid-1971,
 the Soviets probably will be
 able to orbit a large space sta-
 tion  (on the order of 50,000
 pounds)  capable of remaining in
 orbit for much longer periods,
 and the Soyuz could be used to
 resupply it.
 The Soyuz 4 and 5 operation
 was the first time that the So-
 viets have undertaken a manned
 flight in mid-winter with the
 recovery of the cosmonauts com-
 in   in subzero temperatures-

 POLISH PARTY CHIEF DEALS WITH NATIONALIST CHALLENGER
 Gomulka is moving to reduce
 the power and influence of his
 main rival, the hard-line nation-
 alist, Mieczyslaw Moczar.   Person-
 nel changes in conservative pro-
 vincial party organizations and
 the reported ouster of various
 supporters from the Interior Min-
 istry probably reflect Moczar's
 reduced influence in the ministry
 he once headed.
 Rumors concerning Moczar's
 troubles peaked last week when
 his absence from public view for
 more than two weeks prompted the
 story that he was under house ar-
 rest.   He appeared on 17 January,
 however,  to address a meeting of
 the Warsaw regional veterans'
 congress.   Deputy Interior Minis-
 ter Tadeuz Pietrzak, who was also
 rumored last week to be in trou-
 ble, was re-elected chairman of
 the Warsaw veterans'  organization.
 Moczar appeared again at a cere-
 monial occasion on 18 January.
 The removal of Moczar's sup-
 porters reportedly began last
 month following a speech by Rys-
 zard Gontarz,  an anti-Semitic
 journalist in the Interior Minis-
 try.
 Gomulka is said to have es-
 tablished an investigatory com-
 mittee headed by Kliszko immedi-
 ately after the meeting to deal
 with the dissidents.  f
 All of the individuals ru-
 mored to be in trouble in the In-
 terior Ministry are known as strong
 anti-Semites, suggesting that the
 pressure on Jews that followed the
 Arab-Israeli crisis in 1967 may be
 relaxed.   A further indication
 that the Moczar-led anti-Semitic
 campaign may be waning is the com-
 paratively light sentences given
 two Warsaw University lecturers
 who were charged with having en-
 couraged the student riots last
 March.
 These events probably signal
 further efforts by Gomulka to re-
 gain and consolidate some of the
 power which Moczar and his forces
 wrested from him last year.   Go-
 mulka may be successful in finally
 settling some old scores with
 those hard liners who openly sought
 to depose him, but it remains to
 be seen whether he can, or wishes
 to, move against Moczar himself,
 and thus mar the image of post-
 congress unity within the leader-
 ship.   Moreover, Gomulka must ob-
 tain at least the tacit support
 of the younger generation, whose

 Rumors persist in the Arab capitals that Israel is planning a new attack,
 despite a complete lack of any specific indications of such activity. The most
 vociferous rumormongers are the Iraqis, who have cast themselves in the role
 of the most militant of the Arab states. In Lebanon, Premier Rashid Karami
 has at last put together a cabinet. As anticipated, the new government's
 initial utterances have a pronounced flavor of Arab militancy.
 Pakistan's new united opposition movement had some success last week
 in its first attempt to stage nationwide protests. In West Pakistan, turnouts
 were sizable and peaceful; in Dacca, East Pakistan, police moved in to
 prevent the marches from getting under way and clashed with rebellious
 students in the process. Student rioting continued in Dacca for four days.
 Further trouble is expected when President Ayub visits the eastern wing in
 early February. Some possibility of government-opposition compromise may
 be in the wind
 The Shah of Iran's recent visit to India satisfied the desires of both
 governments to make a diplomatic splash in regional affairs. In the Persian
 Gulf area, however, Arab leaders have been slow to respond to the more
 moderate posture the Shah has adopted since his meeting with Saudi King
 Faysal.
 Extremist acts are continuing intermittently in Turkey, and unless the
 government pushes its new "get tough" policy, the situation probably will
 become increasingly violent. During the past week, leftist student demon-
 strators in Istanbul burned an American flag, and the following day a bomb
 was exploded at the US military headquarters in Ankara. US Sixth Fleet
 units scheduled to visit Istanbul next month will almost certainly become
 the target of leftist protest actions.
 In Nigeria the Biafran relief issue continues to exacerbate anti-US
 feelings.
 On 21 January at Kinshasa, the French-oriented African and Malagasy
 Common Organization (OCAM) began its annual foreign ministers' working
 conference, which will be followed on the 27th by a gathering of heads of
 state. The 14-country grouping has been buffeted by squabbles among
 central African members, and two countries have declined to be represented
 at Kinshasa. The conference is primarily concerned with economic matters,
 however, and political problems will probably be glossed over in order to
 produce the usual facade of unity.

 INDIA INTENDS TO STRENGTHEN ITS HELICOPTER FORCE
 India hopes to have a multi-
 mission helicopter force of about
 300 aircraft by the mid-1970s.
 At present there are about 175
 helicopters in the Indian Air
 Force used mainly for transport-
 ing equipment and for carrying
 out resupply missions.
 The impetus for an expanded
 helicopter force comes largely
 from the Indian Army, which wants
 helicopters for armed reconnais-
 sance and troop transport.   The
 army believes that helicopters
 will provide a better capability
 to cope with tribal rebellions
 in the northeastern border areas.
 Part of the existing helicopter
 fleet may be converted to serve
 initially in these new roles.
 Over the longerterm, a strength-
 ened helicopter force would also
 improve India's capabilities in
 the event of incidents with Paki-
 stan or Communist China.
 India is seeking helicopters
 in the US and the UK.   Official
 interest has been expressed in
 INDIAN HELICOPTER INVENTORY
 Transport Helicopters             Utility Helicopters
 UH-19 (US)
 Amphibious
 S-62B (US)
 the US Huey Cobra attack and re-
 connaissance helicopter, the
 Chinook all-weather transport and
 assault support helicopter, and
 the Hughes OH-6A light observation
 and liaison aircraft.   India is
 also continuing to negotiate with
 the USSR for military equipment
 and Soviet MI-8 helicopters are
 among the items of interest.
 In addition, India plans to
 modify some of its present heli-
 copters--probably some of its
 Soviet MI-4s and its French
 Alouettes--to carry the AS-11
 missile, an air-to-surface ver-
 sion of the French SS-11 antitank
 guided missile.   The Indians
 ordered about 3,600 SS-lls from
 France in 1963 for use on heli-
 copters and tanks.   Some have been
 installed on tanks, but none are
 known to be on helicopters.l
 The largest helicopter in
 the Indian Air Force is the So-
 viet MI-4, which the Indians
 have found to be inadequate for
 transporting heavy equipment.
 The much smaller Alouette is
 manufactured in India under a
 license granted by France in 1964.
 Of the 100 units called for in
 the contract, only about 15 have
 been produced to date.   India
 acquired 35 of its present Alouettes
 through direct purchase from

 INDIA AND IRAN MUTUALLY BENEFIT FROM SHAH'S VISIT
 The Shah's recent state visit
 to India has given more impetus
 to the gradual broadening and
 deepening of Indo-Iranian rela-
 tions.                        The 12-day visit, which
 included talks in New Delhi and
 a carefully staged week-long tour
 of India, capped a series of high-
 level Indo-Iranian exchanges over
 the last year.
 The Indians have been culti-
 vating Iran since early 1967 as
 a means of undermining the rela-
 tively close Iranian-Pakistani
 relationship.   The Shah, desiring
 to redress the asymmetry in Iran's
 relations with India and Pakistan
 and to establish his credentials
 as a statesman, has been cautiously
 responsive.
 The Indians gave the Shah a
 plush red carpet treatment which
 he found "fantastic."  On policy
 matters, they played down Iran's
 continuing support for the UN
 resolutions on Kashmir, Iranian
 membership in CENTO, and the
 Shah's close personal relation-
 ship with President Ayub Khan of
 Pakistan--all major irritants in
 their cool relations in the past.
 Early in the visit, the Shah
 publicly offered his good offices
 to help improve Indo-Pakistani
 relations.   Pakistan's response
 was favorable, but the Indians
 gently turned him down on the
 basis of their long-standing posi-
 tion that these matters should
 be handled on a strictly bilat-
 eral basis.   The Indians did,
 however, at the risk of damaging
 their highly valued relations
 with the Arabs, recognize that
 the "preservation of peace and
 stability in the Persian Gulf is
 the exclusive responsibility of
 the littoral states."  The Shah,
 in turn, in the final communique,
 recognized the pre-eminence of
 bilateral negotiations in the
 settlement of international is-
 sues--undoubtedly a gesture much
 appreciated in New Delhi.
 On the economic front, it
 was agreed that "immense" possi-
 bilities exist for closer col-
 laboration, especially in the
 petrochemical field.   Closer
 cooperation in science, tech-
 nology, and industry were promi-
 nently mentioned as a means of
 hastening economic growth in
 the region.   A joint ministerial
 commission is to be established
 to consider these and other areas
 of cooperation.
 The Shah's visit to India
 appears to have been successful
 for both sides.   For the Indians
 it represented a major and
 largely symbolic step toward
 wooing Iran away from the embrace
 of Pakistan.   It is also part of
 larger efforts by India to mend
 its neglected diplomatic fences
 with neighboring states and to
 establish a more influential
 Indian role within Asia.   For
 the Shah, whose approach to
 world and regional problems im-
 pressed the Indians, it was an
 important exercise in balancing
 his relations with two antago-
 nistic neigobors and in estab-
 lishing his image--especially
 in nonaligned circles--as a
 regional and world statesman.
