 DIRECTION OF PL&NHING &ND ECONOMIC DEVILO.PMx"NT IN INDIA
 AND CHINK*
 India and China .G, the two largest countries in the underdeveloped
 3
 part of the world       with a combined population of close to one billion
 and an economic inheritance compounded of many analogous elements, are
 both pursuing programs of economic development within the context of
 their first Five-Year Plans.  Whatever the parallelism in the drive for
 e.cmpomic. growth which motivates,_:the. ie4er..s and the peo.nle: of the two
 countries, the paths which each intends to follow are markedly dissimilar.
 These oaths represent, in a very real sense, two vastly different
 types of approaches to economic development.  India is usually cited as
 the orototyoe of democratic planning in an underdeveloped area, while
 China is the carrier of the communist model in Asia.  This dichotomy
 inevitably poses a host of questions as to the power implications and
 the political aopeal of the two models.  Within this broader context, this
 paper will focus upon an analysis of actual plan performance in agriculture
 and industry against the background of the two development models,

 Communists envisage a development focused on the rapid expansion of
 prgducerss goods and defense industries.  This is to be accompanied. by
 a more modest rate of growth in the manufacture of textiles needed for
 barter with the countryside.  At the same time, agriculture is to be
 developed primarily through mobilization of underemployed farm labor
 for water conservation and other labor-intensive projects.
 In essence, it is a model which envisages industrial development at
 the expense of agricultural development.  Industrialization is accelerated.
 at the outset, by virtue of the very fact that since agriculture is kept
 on, a short investment ration, a larder share of investment resources can
 be concentrated in industry.  This policy,' in turn, sets up ?-its own vicious
 circles; just because agricultural development Is sluggish,, while the
 demand for farm products grows - owing to an increasing population,
 urbanization, and exports   the regime is forced to extract a rising
 proportion of farm output if this demand is to be met.  This very
 process, however, further interferes with agricultural development so that
 the screw must be apulied even tighter and under such circumstances ear;a
 output is sacrificed for control and strong compulsions are set in force
 that drive the system towards collectivization,
 Within the framework of this tyre of a development model, the
 state provides a guaranteed market for the goods and services produced
 so that deficiency in effective demand is not one of the factors limiting
 a
 erowth, except possibly in` short-run frictional sense.  On the contrary,

 the more effectively consumption can be kept in check the higher will be
 the rates of growth under cater is   ribus asenmotions.  Under such
 conditions, government nolcy will be dedicated to keeping consumption at
 the lowest levels compatible with (a)  political stability, i.e.
 maintenance of the regime in power and (b)  the requirements of raising
 nonfarm labor productivity.   Thus, in this type of a totalitarian
 model,, changes in consumption need not be a function of changes in income
 even in a long-run sense.
 The Indian path, on the other hand, is based upon a more or lees
 democratic framework. Consequently, freedom of consumer choice and
 resource allo cation through the pricing and market mechanism plays a
 much more important role.  This, in turn, yields a number of corollary
 effects.  Thus, great reliance is placed upon voluntary saving.  The
 nationalized sector of the economy is much teller and generally the
 state's participation in the economy Is much more modest.
 As a general rronasition# one may consider the Chinese Communist
 Program as primarily oower.orientede i.e. designed to maximize the rate
 it which internal control is extended and consolidated while the external
 'u "maki.ng, defense, and international political -potential is augmented,
 he central focus is upon the develipment of heavy industry, with a
 ower order of priority assigned to consumer Foods industries and
 agriculture.  In contrast, the Indian -orogram is largely-welfare-oriented,
 th one of its central objectives the, improvement of rural welfare.
 is necessarily implies a high order of priority for agricultural develop-
 vent and the expansion of industries serving agriculture, with less
 emphasis upon industrialization .    ,fie,  Thus, while in the Chinese case
 %e central objective is to maximize the rate of industrial, growth, the
 Rndian focus is upon maximizing the rate of improvement in standards
 of living.
 Apart from these broad ideolog.ct1 considerations there are
 certain specific factors which account for the much greater rural
 emphasis in the first Indian .Five Year Plan at least.  One of these in
 certainly the whole C,a dhian tradition and influence.  i.nother0 is the
 serious food shortage problem facing India after Partition.  And a third
 is the comparatively low crop yields per unit of land in India,   or
 instance, rice yields were half, wheat yields were about two-third, and
 cotton yields were at about 40 per cent of the Chinese mainland levela1
 Therefore, the opportunities for raising yields relatively ra,)idly,
 through improved farm practices and extension of the irrigated area are
 much better for India than for China.
 The differing roles assigned to aPriculture and industry in the-
 development plans of India and China may -oerhaps best be illustrated by
 a comparison of the pattern of investment allocation in the two countries.
 This comparison is based on 1934-38 yields for India and 1931-37 yields
 for 9? provinces of China.

 Before apnraising these figures, it must be pointed out that they
 are not completely comparable.   In China, public investment through the
 state budget is virtually equivalent to total investments it of course
 excludes self financed outlays by small entrepreneurs and farmers, however
 these could not have constituted a very significant item by 1953-54.
 On the other hand, in India,, about 40 per cent of planned investment was
 to come from the vrivate sector. As a matter of fact, there are no
 reliable estimates for private investment, planned or actual, so that the
 only firm items are planned government outlays.  Moreover, sector defini.
 tions are somewhat different in India and China and the planners in the
 two countries work with somewhat varying investment concepts.  However,

 even if one discounts for all of these possible sources of error, the
 differences in the two investment patterns are striking.  In China,
 industry?s share of investment resources is twice as high as in India,
 while the position of agriculture is exactly reversed.
 A similar picture emerges if one looks at the reverse side of the
 coin, namely the land tax burden borne by agriculture.  In China apnroxi-
 mately 15 to  '0 per cent of net agricultural product goes into direct
 1
 taxes, while in India the corresponding share is only 1 to 1;5 per cent,
 plan Performance in Agri. culture
 The differences in the roles of the rural sector in the development
 of India and China have been greatly reinforced by the patterns of
 p^oduction as they actually emerged during the first planning years.
 Thus, in the case of India, agricultural -production targets were markedly
 exceeded, while in China farm outout has been lagging below planned levels,
 By the end of the third planning year (1953-54). Indian grain production
 targets for the whole Five Year Plan period were exceeded by 50 per cent.
 By the same time, three fourths of the cotton output increase programmed
 for 1955/56 was attained.2  In China, on the other hand, on the basis of
 official figures, the output of grain ro se only by about 4 per cent in two
 years, as compared to a highly unrealistic five year expansion target of
 30 percent.  For instance, the official  1953 -production figure is 165
 1
 These percentages do not, of course, measure the total tax burden borne
 by agriculture, since they leave out of account proceeds from indirect
 taxes and quasi--taxes.  While there is no way of measuring this total burden
 with the limited data available, indirect tax rates in India would have to
 be much higher than in China to make up for the much lower yield from direct
 taxes.  On basis of all of the available evidence this does not seem to be
 the case.  The estimate for China is based oh the Chinese Communist budget
 figures adjusted for under-valuation of the tax grain price and on the author s
 estimate of national -product..  For India it is based on aggregate_ land and
 agricultural income tax revenue of the States, given in the   an Prr}rrens

 million tons compared to an annual target of 175 million.  In cotton,
 1
 output actually declined between 195> and 1954,
 It would, of course, be erroneous to ascribe these divergent tendencies
 exclusively to "differences in vlanriing techniques or patterns of invest-
 ment allocation.  India, after several successive droughts, was blessed
 by two exceptionally favorable monsoons.
 App
 4cco rdi ng to the Planning
 Commissions  own tentative estimate, "out of the total increased productio3
 of foodgrains of 11.4 million tons, something like 5 to 6 million tons
 represent a more or less permanent gain" attributable to an extension of
 irriga tion and land reclamation and to growing use of fertilizer.   There
 may also have been some increase in "invisible" investment in Indian
 agriculture, i.e. investment which is non-monetary in character, performed
 with materials and labor available on the farm.  These are the types of
 Investment that are very difficult to measure and thus tend to be greatly
 underestimated in the national accounts for most of the underdeveloped
 areas. They are the kind of investments that may be uarticularly responsive
 to changes in the structure of incentives.  `While there are no data that
 would hermit one to really document this, given the general orientation
 of planning, the emphasis upon village development, the beginnings of,
 land reform, and the favorable weather conditions, it would indeed be
 surprising if there had been no rise in peasant. Incentives in India.
 On the Chinese mainland, the pattern was almost exactly reversed;
 three increasingly favorable crop years were followed by a bad drought
 in 1953 and a very serious flood in 1954.  However, just as in India
 larger inputs of capital and production requisites contributed to the
 improvement, so the failure to aprly similar measures in China - on any-
 thing approaching a comparable scale - was undoubtedly a factor in hampe-
 ring agricultural growth there.

 3o  Plan Performance in Industry
 Quite a different picture emerges if one eomnares industrial per-
 formance under the two plans.  As is shown by the data in Table III  o::
 all products listed - except for cement =- growth was significantly more
 rapid in China during two years than in India during three.  This does
 not gainsay the fact that in some fields such as textiles and cement
 significant advances have been registered in India.  However, moot of the
 increase in India could be attained with better utilization of previously
 underutilized capacity.  In China, on the other hand, capacity limits
 were being approached on the eve of the plan, so that the increases for
 1953 and 1954 reouired rapidly expanding capacity.

 Thus, the differing rates of industrial expansion reflect to a
 large extent the differing investment policies pursued in the two
 countries.  Just for purposes of illustration, 1954 industrial Invest-
 ment in India may be roughly estimated at less than 2 per cent of GNP,
 For China, on the basis of rather crude calculations, it may be placed
 at about 6 per cent.
 Perhaps it may be fair to say that in some respects the Indian
 plan has been an outstanding success, in that during the past three
 years output has been appreciably raised in all commodity sectors.
 However, there is a real question as to what extent the Plan or planning
 can take credit for these favorable developments, and whether this could
 not have been accomplished in the absence of a live Year Plan.  In a
 very real sense, the investment program represents the core, the major
 strategic lever of an economic plan.  However, this is precisely the
 field in which there is a significant shortfall with only about 40 per
 cent of the total outlay programmed for the five year period, actually
 Invested during the first three years.
 For industrial investment, plan fulfillment was even lower, less
 than one-third of expenditure proerammed for the plan period was dis-
 bursed by the end of the third year.  It is particularly notable that
 the governments investment plan, which was quite modest to begin with,
 fell far behind the much more sizable private investment program.
 A case could be made for the view that the Indian eovernment's economic
 policy places it in a position where it lives in the worst of two

 possible worlds.  On the one hand, it has pursued a very cautious and
 orthodox monetary fiscal and balance of payments policy, has been quite
 conservative in its own investment commitments, and on the other hand
 it has done very little to encourage and foster private investment.
 Behind Indian fiscal and monetary management there always seemed to lur.:
 the shadow of a feared inflation.  Actually, it is very questionable
 whether an active and vigorous development policy, doesn't almost
 tably bring with It a certain measure of inflationary pressure,   n upward
 pressure on prices of modest and gradual proportions need not necessarily
 bring with it the usually cited maleffects inherent in runaway infla-
 tion.
 However, there are definite signs that Indian government policy
 is gradually changing in this as well as in some other respects.,
 Possibly were one viewing this period from a perspective of say 1960 or
 1965, one might date development planning in India as beginning in the
 fourth year of the first Plan and then merging into the second Plan.
 These indications seem to point to a less orthodox fiscal and monetary
 policy, combined with higher levels of government investment, and with
 greater emphasis placed upon industrialization.
 In the past, the Indian government's policy towards private
 enterprise has been suite ambivalent.  To some extent it is based on a
 mixture of socialist and populist attitudes, combined with a certain
 mistrust of the Indian entrepreneur, a fear of large concentrations of
 private wealth and power, counterbalanced by a recognition of the
 important managerial and technical contribution to be made by the
 .: erttrepreneur1,   Actually, however, it would be very difficult to establien
 whether these government attitudes really play a major role in shaping
 private management and investment decisions.  It would seem that

 insufficiency of effective demand, the narrowness of the market, plays
 a much more important role than government-enterprise relations.  One
 could go even further and maintain that in a rapidly expanding economy
 the gains to be made by getting on the bandwagon would more than outweigh
 the fears and suspicions of private entrepreneurs.  In effect, I would
 argue that the crux of the problem is more active government participa-
 tion in the Indian economy, both as an investor and as a buyer.                          Such
 a policy would not only stimulate growth in the public sector  but would
 also tend to contribute to a much more favorable vrivate investment
 climate, therefore, it need not be incompatible with objectives of
 democratic planning or of private entrepreneurial activity.
 Of course, these are problems which the. Chinese Communist planners
 need not face.  They are, an the other  ?.;:i;, confronted with difficulties
 of an almost opposite kind.   That is, the Chinese Communist economy is
 permanently on the verge of inflation, which is however arrested through
 a wide network of economic controls.  This state of chronic repressed
 inflation is of course a function of a number of factors.  However, the
 high rate of investment and military expenditure combined with a very
 marked concentration upon investment in producer goads industries is
 undoubtedly the most Important single factor contributing to an imbalance
 between the flow of money income and the flow of goods and services
 available for consumption.  More generally, the economy and the whole
 society is constantly driven to operate at the very limits of its
 capacity.  Programs are formulated in terms of maximum objectives, with an
 attempt made to proceed on all fronts at once.  In other words, it is an
 economy and society which is permanently overextended in relation to its
 stage of development and the human resources at its disposal.  All of this

 is then reflected in chronic economic and social strain and in structural
 bottlenecks.
 0 nclusions
 The foregoing analysis has been focused upon an appraisal of
 agricultural and industrial performance in Tndia and China against the
 backdrop of the economic development models implicitly or explicitly
 formulated within the context of the two Five Year.Plans.  It was shown
 that the agricultural sector is assigned a very important role in India,
 while in China development is identified with industrialization in the
 narrow sense, with a major emphasis placed uoor the expansion of producer
 mods Industries.  These divergeiatFpatterns of planning have been
 reinforced in practice by the vagaries of weather and a shortfall in
 industrial investment in India,  On the whole, the Indian Plan has been
 a modest one, while Chinese Communist targets are very ambitious.  This
 should naturally facilitate plan fulfillment in India as compared to
 China.
 What impact do these trends have upon the aggregate rates of growth
 in the two countries, and what are their implications for an assessment
 of the economic race -- real or imagined -- between India and China?
 In looking at the two countries, it is natural to focus on the most
 dramatic, i.e. the rapid rate of industrial advance in China.  It is
 essential, however, to bear in mind that the moddtrn industrial sector is
 suite small in both countries.  It contributes less than 10 per cent to
 national product, and possibly its relative size is smaller in China than

 more rapid in China, this does not necessarily mean that in the short
 run the economy as a whole Is growing more rapidly.  Since we have as

 yet no firmly based measures of Communist Chinas GN? for successive
 years, all statements in this realm are necessarily speculative.
 However, in view of the marked agricultural expansion in India, it is
 perfectly conceivable that the increase in India's GNP was greater than
 that of China's during the past two years,
 on the other hand, we may be confronted with an entirely different
 outlook in the long run.  Unless the present gap between the rates of
 investment in the two countries is narrowed, the Chinese economy as a
 whole is bound to grow much more rapidly than the Indian.  Moreover,
 in China the whole process of economic growth is intimately and consciously
 linked to rapid and far-reaching changes in the social' structure,  One
 could say that the Chinese Communist regime is bent uuon systematically
 undermining and bombarding traditional social institutions in order to
 extend its controls and bring about changes in the society.  It to a
 orocesss in which the whole system is gradually changed through the
 interaction of social, political and economic dynamism mutually reinfor-
 cing each other?  Thus the institutional barriers to economic growth are
 Preatly diminished.
 A system such as this, pursuing the types of-polities the Chinese
 Communists are engasred in, in obviously faced with a number of ?roblemss
 the most crucial in our context here involves agricultural development,
 In a more or less closed economy, where rates of population growth are
 high and increasing economic growth continuously focused upon industrial
 development to the neglect of agricultural expansion will tend to strain
 the economy to a point at which a major crisis may be in the making,
 In India, this whole process of change is proceeding at a much
 more leisurely pace.  The comparatively low rate of saving and investment
 is but one of its economic symptoms as well as one of its determinants,

 long-run perspective may perhaps be stated in form of a question;   Are
 current plans and governmental measures of a sufficient scope and mag-
 nitude to impose the kind of all.pervading dynamism in the system which
 is one of the prerequisites for sustained economic growth?
 In a sense. one could view the Chinese Comr.-unist and Indian develop-
 ment models as representing two extremes.   The first involves such high
 rates of aggregate and industrial investment that there is not too much
 room left for agricultural development and for raising per-capita
 standards of living,  Moreover, such a pattern threatens to undermine
 peasant and worker incentives and tends to subject the Tsystem to severe
 structural strains.  In the Indian case, the problem is almost reversed.
 Rates of aggregate investment may be too low to insure a sustained rise
 in per-capita product and consumption amidst rapid rates of population
 growth.  At the same time, industrial investment may be too low to permit
 a rate of industrial expansion sufficient to provide an avenue for
 relieving agricultural population pressure, the relief of which is an
 essential prereouisite for the-very program of agricultural development.
 Beyond this, one may legitimately question whether the aggregate
 rate of growth as reflected in GNP is the sole or most relevant criterion
 for comparing performance in two or more countries.  Obviously, from the
 standpoint of military and war waging potential, the rate of industrial
 growth is of prime importance.  From an economic welfare point of view
 the rate of growth in per-canita personal consumption may be the most
 meaningful criterion.  In terms of political appeal, both, rising standards
 of living and dramatic industrialization programs accompanied by an
 aggressivenower posture may be competing with each other.  Thus the out-
 come of an India-China eomnarison may yield different results depending
