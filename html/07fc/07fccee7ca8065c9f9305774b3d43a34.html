 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
 The Hua-Deng Relationship
 The unusual circumstances surrounding the elevation
 of Hua Guofeng (Hua Kuo-feng) in 1976 to the posts of party
 chairman and premier form the basis of an uneasy relation-
 ship between the younger Hua and the hard-nosed veteran
 Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-ping).  Htia's career had flourished
 in 1975 under Deng's de facto stewardship of both the party
 and government, but Hua would not have risen so far so
 fast had Deng not been upended by the leftist Gang of
 Four in April 1976.  Official Chinese decisions at that
 time established a clear link between Hua's rise and
 Deng's fall.   This link remains a sore point in the
 relationship between the two men, but there are differences
 as well over the implementation of specific policies and
 active competition for control over the instruments of
 power.   The relationship has evolved through several
 stages and now seems to have settled into one in which
 the two leaders will cope with their differences in some-
 what more muted fashion than has been the case in the
 past.   With Deng's preeminence clearly established,
 neither seems prepared 'to attempt to oust the other from
 power.
 This memorandum was prepared by the East Asia-Pacific Division
 of the Office of Regional and Political Analysis in response to a
 request from the Department of State.  Questions and comments may
 be addressed to

 Background
 The Chinese now freely admit that with the declining
 health of Premier Zhou Enlai (Chou En-tai) in 1975,
 and the frail condition of Chairman Mao Zedong (Mao
 Tse-tung), Deng, then fifth ranking party leader and
 senior vice premier in the government, was in de facto
 charge of the party and government.   In early 1975,
 Hua, who had come to the capital in 1971 from Mao's home
 province to assume a role in the national leadership,
 was named a vice premier, put in charge of security, and
 maintained an active role in overseeing agricultural
 and scientific work.   He was clearly being groomed for
 bigger things, and this process was carried out, with no
 apparent discord, under Deng's leadership.                              25X1
 After Zhou Enlai's death in January 1976, the Gang of
 Four, which had been opposing Deng on personal and policy
 grounds for several years, stepped up its efforts to
 prevent his succession to the premiership.   In this,
 they may have had at least the tacit approval of Mao.
 The party was sharply divided--Deng had almost as many
 enemies as friends in the leadership at the time--and
 could not agree to name either Deng or the Gang of Four's
 candidate to the premiership.   Hua was chosen as a compromise
 and named "acting" premier.
 The Gang of Four then escalated its attacks on Deng,
 and by late March it became necessary for the party to
 decide formally on Deng's fate.   Deng's supporters organized
 a show of support on Chinese memorial day in the guise
 of commemorating the late Zhou, Deng's patron.   The Gang's
 intervention in this endeavor led to rioting by millions
 of people in the capital.   The rioting was blamed on
 Deng and was the official reason for his ouster.   The Gang
 was nevertheless thwarted in its efforts to profit by
 Deng's demise when Hua was named premier and "first"
 vice chairman of the party, thus making him the logical
 choice to succeed the ailing Mao as chairman.   When Mao
 died in September, Hua became chairman, the only person
 in Chinese communist history to hold both the party chairman-
 ship and the premiership.

 Had Deng not overplayed his hand by organizing a
 public show of support, he might have weathered the Gang's
 April assault and could then have become premier.
 Although Hua was by then an important figure, he clearly
 rose higher as a result of Den is ouster than he would
 have otherwise.
 Deng's Return
 Deng's return was a foregone conclusion once the
 Gang of Four was arrested in October 1976.   The process
 was made difficult, however, by the opposition of some
 who had crossed swords with Deng in the past and were
 afraid that the always vengeful Deng would take action
 against them.   These people formed a natural alliance with
 Hua, who was a pleasant change from Mao: unassuming in
 his ways, his accessibility, low-key in his approach.
 Hua's personal traits, however, were not enough to win
 him large numbers of political supporters throughout
 the party hierarchy.   He knew he was no match for Deng,
 whose forceful personality and huge network of personal
 and political allies throughout the nation could enable
 him to eclipse Hua.   The new chairman, realizing he could
 not block Deng's return--indeed that would only add to
 his problems if he tried--stalled for time in order
 to more firmly lay down roots within the party.   Others
 uneasy about the prospect of Deng's return may have been
 bolder in actually trying to prevent it.   In any event,
 the delaying tactics were added to Deng's list of grievances
 against some in the leadership and probably did not serve
 to endear Hua to him either.
 Deng returned in July 1977, in advance of a timetable
 established by Hua earlier in the year.   The party adopted
 resolutions restoring Deng to all the positions he had
 held before his 1976 demise and confirming Hua as party
 chairman.   The adoption of the two resolutions at the
 same time was ipso facto acknowledgement that Deng's
 return had raised questions about the legitimacy of
 Hua's position, questions related directly to the decisions
 of April 1976 ousting Deng and elevating Hua in his stead.

 Deng had to agree to some conditions upon his return.
 He pledged his loyalty to Hua as party chairman--although
 not as premier--and announced that he was Hua's "good
 assistant," thus subordinating himself to Hua but under-
 scoring his own vital role.   He also agreed to refrain
 from seeking revenge against those who may have opposed
 his return or who had differed with him in the past.
 The latter stipulation was important to Hua, not necessarily
 because he had reason to fear that Deng would try to unseat
 him but because those Deng was likely to turn against
 were Hua's main supporters in the upper reaches of the
 party.   That these people were united more in their
 opposition to Deng than in their loyalty to Hua was
 less important than their ability to furnish Hua with
 some measure of support at crucial party meetings.
 Open Differences
 After an initial display of solidarity, Hua and
 Deng began to openly show their differences.   Some of
 these moves were symbolic, others were more substantive.
 Included in the symbolic gestures were the failure of
 the two to appear together and the publication in the
 party's official newspaper of a photograph in which the
 upraised arm of Hua completely blocked from view the face
 of Deng.   Such gestures are designed to send signals to
 others in the party and do not occur without careful
 staging.
 On a more issue-oriented level, Hua and Deng differed
 over the scope of the campaign against followers of the
 Gang of Four.   Hua wanted a limited effort, not only
 because he feared creating a volatile political situation
 but also because many would-be victims, having risen to
 prominence like him during the Cultural Revolution, were
 potential supporters.   Consequently, he repeatedly inter-
 vened to support Beijing  (Peking)  party boss Wu De
 (Wu Te), who was under Deng's fire for being the last
 senior official to attack him by name in 1976, for having
 called a halt to the demonstrations in April 1976, and
 probably for attempting to forestall his return.   Wu
 had been in political trouble at least as early as January
 1977, even before Deng's return, but Hua's apparent support
 for him and other beleaguered officials slowed Deng's

 In public forums Deng and Hua made speeches that took
 sharply different tacks. At a science conference in
 March 1978, Deng virtually relieved scientists of any
 responsibility to prove their political reliability
 and gave them carte blanche to pursue research unencumbered
 by party regulation; Hua reiterated the more standard
 line that scientists must follow the correct political
 line to remain in good standing.  At a conference in
 June, Deng unveiled his own "ideology"--one that in fact
 eschewed rigid adherence to any ideology but put a
 premium instead on practical approaches to problem-solving.
 In this, he outlined the need to revise or ignore the
 teachings of Mao or other communist theoreticians.   This
 speech was the basis of the upswing in the effort to
 desanctify Mao.   Hua has been less willing--for the obvious
 reason that he is the embodiment of the Mao le acy--to
 cast Mao's teachings to the winds.                                      25X1
 Unequal Partnership
 Today the two men seem willing--perhaps in the
 interest of economic progress--to air their differences
 in more subtle ways.   At a central committee plenum last
 month, for example, an unpublished speech by Hua called
 for "closing" the campaign against Gang of Four followers
 and "shifting" work to the economic modernization  pro ram
 positions probably not endorsed by Deng.                                25X1
 Deng wants a sweeping purge of those he fears do
 not fully support the modernization policies.   He is
 willing to risk the instability this could cause in the
 short term to insure the continuation of the modernization
 drive in the future.   The more cautious Hua seems less
 willing to take the immediate risk.   He also may be more
 reluctant than Deng to embark on certain controversial
 economic policies--particularly those calling for large
 foreign involvement--for fear that a backlash could develop
 if the economic program does not make the hoped-for gains.
 The plenum dealt at length with the modernization question
 but did not publicly endorse the specific foreign trade
 policies China has been considering.                                     25X1

 The communique released at the conclusion of the
 plenum seemed to issue a rebuke to Deng by warning that the
 personal views of leading officials must not be regarded
 as   instructions.   Often Deng has issued instructions in
 his own name on personnel and other politically sensitive
 matters and has made decisions without consulting with
 others.   On the other hand, the plenum's call to lower the
 profile of individual leaders has affected Hua more than
 anyone else--he has not been called since the plenum by
 his usual title "wise leader."   Thus, the slimmist trngs
 of a personality cult have been denied him.              a   i            25X1
 The treatment of visiting foreign dignitaries
 indicates that Hua and Deng occupy separate but roughly
 equal slots in the leadership.   Unlike the practice in
 Mao's day when first Zhou Enlai and later Deng would
 accompany the visitor to his session with Mao, thereby
 acknowledging Zhou's and Deng's clear subordination to
 him, Deng does not accom an  visitors to their meetings
 with Hua.
 The  appointment of a close Deng associate, the 63
 year old Hu Yaobang (Hu Yao-pang), as secretary-general
 of the party sheds further light on the Hua-Deng relationship.
 Hu is now in charge of the party's daily affairs.   If
 Deng had full confidence in Hua, he would not have felt
 a need to. put his own protege into the post.   Hu is in a
 strong position to pose a serious challenge to Hua after
 Deng's passing.
 Ironically, Deng's current position in the leadership
 could be more useful to Hua than will be Deng's death.
 Neither Hu nor anyone else will challenge Hua with Deng
 around;  that is Deng's role and he has performed it well.
 But the one factor that made Hua an ideal compromise choice--
 his lack of a huge personal power base--will leave him
 vulnerable to threats to his position over the longer
 term.
 Deng's public disavowal of his interest in the
 premiership, while it does not in itself preclude a
 move against Hua, makes one less likely.   At this point,
 Deng hardly needs the title, although he undoubtedly wanted
 it very much in the past.   The fact that the 74 year old

 Deng is ma)Cing the long trip to Washington rather than
 the 57 year old Hua is proof enough of who the more
 important man is.   Deng's public comments on the need
 to have the younger Hua as premier leave the impression--
 probably not unintended--that Hua in fact serves by Deng's
 leave.   Therefore, so long as Deng does not mount an
 effort to unseat Hua, his position is secure.   it will
 be less secure when this unusual "protector" leaves the
 political scene.
