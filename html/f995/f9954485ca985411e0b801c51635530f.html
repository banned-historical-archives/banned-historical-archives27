 Mr. President, the grab bag of Com-
 munists and Socialists whom I have men-
 tioned and who are mentioned in the
 American Security Council report, will
 probably seem mild by comparison with
 some of the radicals who may show up
 and foment disorder during the Novem-
 ber moratorium.
 If the "Weatherman" faction of S?DS
 joins the moratorium, it is almost cer-
 tain to mean trouble. Last month, Mark
 Rudd and a few hundred "Weathermen"
 went to Chicago and engaged in violent
 confrontations with police there.
 These young revolutionaries went on
 a wild rampage which resulted in wide-
 spread damage to property of the citizens
 of Chicago. Three of the "Weathermen"
 were shot by police.
 -A group of women, led by "Weather-
 man's" Bernadine Dohrn, threatened to
 destroy an Army Induction center. They
 gathered in a park, sang praises to Ho
 Chi Minh and Mao Tse-tung, and then
 charged into police ranks trying to kick
 the officers in the groins. Illinois Gover-
 nor Ogilvie called up the National Guard
 and before it was over, police arrested
 more than 200 demonstrators.
 If the extremists of the New Left can
 cause that much trouble in Chicago
 without a mob to exploit, imagine what
 they might do in a crowd of moratorium
 demonstrators, many of whom will be
 charged up emotionally over the war.

 $40 million, was finally agreed to in the
 sum of $40 million.
 On the Conus air defense intercepter,
 for which the House authorized $18.5
 million and the Senate $2.5 million, the
 conferees agreed to the lower Senate fig-
 ure.
 There are other items that I will an-
 swer questions about, if desired. How-
 ever, I will not delineate them now.
 On the general provisions, the con-
 ferees agreed upon a modified version of
 the amendment authorizing a GAO study
 of defense profits. The modification
 makes it clear that the information re-
 quired from a contractor's records will
 be that obtainable from the records he
 keeps in the normal course of business.
 It also takes away the subpena power
 from the Comptroller General and con-
 templates that the House and Senate
 Committees on Armed Services would
 issue subpenas in necessary cases when
 requested.
 That was a hotly contested item on the
 floor. It concerned the granting of sub-
 pena power and involved the changing
 of the nature of the GAO.
 We strenuously urged the adoption of
 the Senate amendment because I thought
 the restrictions on the subpena power
 were adequate and had been properly
 phrased and took care of it all right.
 However, the House never did yield with
 reference to the subpena power on either
 one of these two items. And there was no
 way to get them to yield. But they did
 yield and agree to this modification that
 I have discussed.
 On the financial disclosure amend-
 ment, the Rouse receded from its objec-
 tion to section 403 of the Senate bill
 with an amendment. This section con-
 tains the financial disclosure provisions
 for former military officers and civilians
 involved in defense procurement matters.
 The House added a provision for a
 new Assistant Secretary-Assistant Sec-
 retary of Defense Health Affairs. That is
 a matter that they have added in several
 bills in recent years. We finally agreed
 to include that provision. I think that
 there is rather strong argument in favor
 of it and that the work can be central-
 ized there.
 At one time it was offered in such a
 way as to crowd out the Assistant Sec-
 retary on :Systems Analysis. We never
 would agree to it in that form, because
 any Secretary of Defense is entitled to
 the very best personnel he can get. And
 it helps to rave status in these matters of
 procurement and systems analysis eval-
 uation.
 We had a very complicated amend-
 ment considered on the Senate floor
 regarding independent research.  The
 amendment was offered by the distin-
 guished Senator from Wisconsin.
 We finally agreed that the Senator
 would introduce a bill on that subject.
 The committee recommended a 20-per-
 cent reduction in funds. That passed the
 Senate in that form.
 That amendment was very stoutly re-
 sisted by the conferees on the part of the
 House. Some rather complicated matters
 came up concerning it. However, after a
 os thorough conside>iatlon, we ageo
 ment that would not disturb existing
 contracts' and there would be an overall
 reduction of 7 percent in new contracts
 made for the rest of this year, the idea
 being that that is a temporary settlement
 of the matter and that we are getting
 into the field more explicitly, we hope to
 have better guidelines possibly by statute
 in the next year.
 Mr. PI#,OXMIRE. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. STENNIS. I am glad to yield to
 the distinguished Senator from Wiscon-
 sin. He is the author of the amendment
 to which I have just referred, and he
 did a great deal of fine work on it.
 Mr. PROXMIRE. I want to say a num-
 ber of things later, but first I want to say
 that I am very grateful to the Senator
 from Mississippi for the excellent job
 he did with regard to the amendments I
 introduced. I think he made a fine fight.
 I know it was not easy. I should like to
 ask' him about this amendment.
 Does the Senator agree that the effect
 of the amendment retained by the con-
 ference placed this practice of independ-
 ent research-what I have in mind are
 loose rules and regulations-for the first
 time under the scrutiny and examination
 of both the Pentagon and. Congress?
 Mr. STENNIS. Yes. That is a correct
 statement. It will now have to be under
 the strict surveillance of the Pentagon,
 and this is a start whereby we can have
 legislative surveillance.
 Mr. PROXMIRE. Is the effect of the
 amendment to limit the funds which the
 Pentagon allows to be written off by
 contractors for this purpose to 93 per-
 cent of the contemplated level of allow-
 ance for future contracts? In other
 words, there Is at least a 7-percent cut
 in the amount which would otherwise
 be allowed in future contracts.
 Mr. STENNIS. That is correct. The
 language, appears a litttle odd, but that
 is the way it had to be drawn.
 Mr. PROXMIRE. Does the Senator
 agree that this amount would be a cut of
 at least $40 million to $50 million over
 what it would otherwise have been and
 that it might in fact be more?
 Mr. STENNIS. Yes, I think that is ap-
 proximately correct. We found that there
 was no way to be accurate on that be-
 cause of various conditions. I think I
 said at one time that it would run from
 $30 million to $40 million to $50 million,
 but I think $40 million to $50 million is
 more nearly accurate.
 Mr. PROXMIRE. I understood the
 Senator to say that this is a beginning.
 As I understand it, the Senator intends
 to hold hearings on this question and his
 committee intends to go into it in con-
 siderable detail.
 Mr. STENNIS. That is exactly what
 we propose to do. It must be evaluated;
 it must be understood. I think it must
 be regulated somewhat, although I am
 impressed with the need for some opera-
 tion in this field.
 Mr. PROXMIRE. Would the Senator
 not also agree that the effect of the
 amendment is to give a clear notice to
 the procurement officials in the Defense
 Department ,that, some past practices ag-
 ar to h   of u , who have examined
 e.lns~eti> and that
 there needs to be a tightening of the reg-
 ulations and controls under which this
 procedure has been practiced?
 For example, my office was- unable to
 find out from the Department of Defense
 or to find in the armed services procure-
 ment regulations any clear definitions or
 regulations which involved funds in ex-
 cess of a half billion dollars a year.
 Is this amendment not a clear notice
 to the procurement officials and to the
 Comptroller of the Pentagon that this
 entire area must be re-examined, tight-
 ened, and brought under control?
 Mr. STENNIS. That is what we in-
 tend to do. We are going to follow that
 up by letter. No corruption or anything
 like that was found there.
 Mr. PROXMIRE. l agree.
 Mr. STENNIS. It was the inadequacy
 of the system and an application of that
 system. It is just intolerable, as I see
 it. It is an important field, however.
 The committee will not bring in a rec-
 ommendation again until we get a better
 system and a better understanding. That
 would be my position.
 Mr. PROXMIRE. I should like to ask
 the Senator another question about this
 item and about the dollar amounts
 involved.
 In the original amendment, it was
 considered that under the authorization
 some $585 million originally would have
 been available for the independent re-
 search and development. We cut that by
 20 percent, or one-fifth; and, as the
 report points out, the language "was in-
 tended to provide a reduction of approxi-
 mately 20 percent in the funds which
 would otherwise be expended for this
 purpose during fiscal 1970."
 The effect was to limit the total to $468
 million, or 20 percent of $585 million.
 The effect of the new amendment is to
 make a 7-percent cut, rather than a 20-
 percent cut.
 By my calculations, this would be
 $40.95 million, and would limit inde-
 pendent research and development ex-
 penditures to approximately $544 million
 for next year. Is that not correct?
 Mr. STENNIS. I think that is approxi-
 mately correct. That is the best we could
 get at this time, with the lack of a system,
 and they do not know the extent of these
 contracts as yet. We could not be exact.
 The estimates on it went up. The gross
 estimates on the amount that could be
 involved went up.
 Mr. PROXMIRE. I have some addi-
 tional questions, but I will defer those,
 if the Senator wishes, while other Sen-
 ators who are members of the committee
 speak. I will do whatever the Senator
 desires. I want to accommodate him.
 Mr. STENNIS. I thank the Senator.
 The Senator from New Hampshire is
 versed in this matter. as are others. This
 matter was handled. however, as an
 amendment on the floor of the Senate,
 and I think we all are familiar with it.
 Does the Senator have further ques-
 tions on this matter?
 Mr. PROXMIRE. Not on this matter.
 I have questions on other matters.
 Mr. STENNIS. I would rather finish
 now. I thank the Senator.

 of the
 I think that was. the main point. The
 main point on which the House objected
 was the lack of hearings in such a far-
 reaching policy question, without a de-
 lineation of the various parts, and so
 forth.
 Mr. President, that was the overall
 reason that the House did not accept
 the amendment.
 Mr. COOPER. I assumed that would be
 the reason.
 Mr. STENNIS. Yes.
 Mr. COOPER. I would like to discuss
 this matter for a few minutes.
 Mr. STENNIS. Certainly. I yield to the
 Senator from Kentucky.
 Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, the Sen-
 ator from Mississippi was kind enough
 to call me several times after the con-
 ference. I was not in Washington. I was
 in Kentucky. He told me that he wanted
 to discuss with me the action of the con-
 ference on the amendment. I appreciate
 his consideration very much.
 Mr. STENNIS. The Senator is certainly
 entitled to that consideration. I wanted
 him to be informed,, and I wanted him to
 be here when we took up the report, and
 it was only after we knew he would be
 here that we went ahead.
 Mr. COOPER. The Senator is not only
 courteous but also very fair. I appreciate
 his consideration very much.
 The information offered publicly to the
 country since August 12, when I first of-
 fered the amendment, gives more impor-
 tance to the amendment. Before August
 12, after I had studied the bill and had
 noted that in title IV the language which
 authorized funds for the use of U.S.
 troops in assistance of local forces in Laos
 and Thailand, two questions arose in my
 mind because of the language. The first
 -question was a constitutional question,
 and that is always arguable, as to wheth-
 er the President and I spoke of the Office,
 has the right to use combat troops in an-
 other country without the approval of
 Congress. I had thought that was a per-
 tinent question because the Senate re-
 cently agreed to a national commitment
 resolution, which was supported by all
 Members except seven. I remember that
 the Senator from Mississippi spoke in
 support of the resolution.
 The more substantive and immediate
 question was whether the United States
 would, by use of its combat forces, move
 into a new war in Laos and Thailand.
 At the time I did not have any absolute
 information as to what the United States
 was doing in Laos. There were rumors,
 but I must say I had no firm informa-
 tion. Since that time a series of articles
 has been published in the New York
 Times going into some detail about the
 involvement of the United States in
 Laos. In addition, the Senator from Mis-
 souri  (Mr. SYMINOTON)  has been very
 ably conducting a series of hearings on
 our foreign commitments. I shall not
 comment on what .has been happening
 in that committee. Although I am a
 member of the committee, the hearings
 have been secret and I do not intend to
 comment upon any information that has
 been developed in the hearings. I shall
 follow the chairman, Senator SYMINGTON.
 I must say I rely chiefly on the articles
 from the New York Times. Also `I rely
 upon the statements which Secretary of
 State Rogers has made to the press. If
 he is correctly reported, he said he
 thought Members of Congress or some
 Members know about the U.S. involve-
 ment.
 I know that our activities in Laos are
 related to our operations in the war in
 Vietnam. For example, if we bomb the
 Ho Chi Minh Trail from bases in Thai-
 land that is an operation supporting our
 forces in Vietnam. It is to deny the move-
 ment of supplies and forces down the Ho
 Chi Minh Trail.
 In the debate on August 12 and on
 September 17, I did not question the
 right of the President, as Commander in
 Chief, to conduct activities in Laos which
 are directly related to the war in Viet-
 nam; but I did question then and I ques-
 tion today the authority of the Presi-
 dent-and again, I am not directing my
 remarks to President Nixon but to the
 office of President-because if these
 activities have been occurring, they have
 been occurring under the Presidents and
 they were initiated, according to the
 newspapers during the administration of
 President Kennedy. The activities in-
 creased under the administration of
 President Johnson.
 If the newspapers are correct, the ac-
 tivities have been carried on under the
 administration of President Nixon.
 The point I make is that no President
 ever declared to the American people or
 to Congress that the United States was
 assisting in combat activities in support
 of local forces in Laos. The forces of
 Laos are engaged in a civil war in Laos.
 The Pathet Lao are engaged and have
 been engaged for years in an attempt to
 strike down the established Government
 of Laos. The Pathet Lao has been as-
 sisted by the North Vietnamese forces,
 and, I assume, by Chinese work bat-
 talions.
 The circumstances under which these
 activities began as in Vietnam were in a
 framework in which the United States
 was concerned about the Communist
 takeover of Southeast Asia. There was
 great  concern  about  this  possibility
 which many people do not remember
 today.
 But the point I made when I offered
 the amendment, and the point I try to
 make now is that no President as Com-
 mander in Chief, has ever announced to
 the American people that he is using
 what he might consider to be his con-
 stitutional powers and that we were in
 combat activities in support of local
 forces in Laos. Certainly, Congress has
 never been informed or approved such
 actions.
 We  can  agree to resolutions until
 doomsday and they will have their moral
 effect upon the President or upon Con-
 gress or upon the American people, but
 all such methods other than the certain
 constitutional method we might use-
 and the Senator from Mississippi knows
 this well because he is a great lawyer-
 are doubtful.
 There is only one method which is
 certain and that is' the prohibition of
 appropriations. That was the purpose of
 my amendment: To deny appropriations
 to carryon the use of American combat
 troops to support local forces in Laos or
 Thailand.
 e was as to the meaning of
 and that was in contest
 of the Senate. I have not
 discuss this matter with
 Mr. COOPER. I do not intend to dis-
 cuss  the  conference  action  on  the
 amendment at great length at this time,
 but I should like to ask the Senator
 some questions.
 Mr. STENNIS. I yield to the Senator
 for such questions as he may have.
 Mr. COOPER. I understood the Sen-
 ator to say that disagreement in the
 conference arose over the meaning or
 the intention of, the language. Would
 the Senator speak in more detail of
 disagreement.
 Mr. STENNIS. As I recall, the ques-
 tion. was whether it put a limitation on
 all the funds of the Department of De-
 fense, or whether it was just on this
 $2.5 billion.
 With great deference to the Senator,
 I thought his language applied only to
 the $2.5 billion, and the contention of
 the Senator from Kentucky was that it
 applied to all the funds appropriated for
 the Department of Defense. It is a very
 broad and a very far-reaching question,
 and we just could not make any head-
 way with the House on that question.
 It pertains to war, some possible exten-
 sion of the war.
 Mr. COOPER. To try to secure as pre-
 cise an answer as I can, I ask this ques-
 tion: Was the discussion in the con-
 ference, and particularly the objection
 of the House conferees, directed to the
 question, which we debated at great
 length on the floor of the Senate, that
 is-to whether the amendment I offered
 applied only to the $2.5 billion which was
 authorized in the bill? That is an argu-
 able question, and we debated it at some
 -length. But the more substantive ques-
 tion, and the chief question, is this: Was
 there argument in the conference-did
 the question arise, as to whether funds
 should be appropriated for combat use
 of our troops in support of local force in a
 war in Laos?
 That is the chief and substantive,ques-
 tion, and that was my point.
 Mr. STENNIS. This matter came up
 many - times during the conference. The
 amendment had two phases: one was
 the ceiling and the other was the Sen-
 ator's limitation. I recall that it was dis-
 cussed  from  virtually  every  angle.
 I recall speaking with Representative
 RiVExs about it in one. of our con-
 ferences on ,tFhe items tllat were not

 Mr. President, I have almost completed
 my speech now. Remarks on the chemical

 Hampshire (Mr. MCINTYRE).
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 An 11-percent cut: Mr, President, in
 summary terms the bill provides for a re-
 duction of 11 percent in research and de-
 velopment funds in the budget request as
 compared to an average of about 12 per-
 cent in the Senate version and 10 percent
 in the House version. In addition, Mr.
 President, I wish to emphasize that the
 military science budget activity was re-
 duced in a manner which will give com-
 plete effect to the total reduction of some
 $45 million adopted on the Senate floor
 relating to the Federal research centers,
 behavioral sciences, and certain other
 activities.
 SPECIFIC RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ITEMS
 NEW ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH AFFAIRS
 The Senate agreed to a House pro-
 vision providing for a new Assistant Sec-
 retary of Defense for Health Affairs with
 the added proviso that the number of
 Assistant Secretaries would be increased
 from seven to eight. This provision which
 was also contained in last year's procure-
 ment bill, but rejected by the Senate,
 was strongly insisted upon by the House.
 INDEPENDENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 Mr. President, as the Senate may re-
 call, the House version contained no
 language in its bill on the business of
 independent research and development.
 The Senate version contained a section
 limiting this activity to $468 million for
 fiscal year 1970, representing a 20-per-
 cent reduction in this program, A com-
 promise was adopted by the conference
 under which for new contracts incurred
 after the effective date of this act the
 Department of Defense is directed to

 of the Department of Defense based on
 the limited attention we were able to ex-
 tend to it this session. At one point the
 Senate Committee was advised that
 about $580 million would be expended
 out of the authorized funds for fiscal
 year 1970. The House Committee some
 weeks later was advised that about $702
 million might be expended for this gen-
 eral purpose. The simple truth is I do
 not believe the Department knows how
 much money will be spent in the general
 area of independent research and devel-
 opment, bid and proposal, and other
 technical effort. While I am sure there
 is much good work accomplished under
 these programs, it is at the present time
 beyond the decisionmaking process in
 the Congress in terms of the budget.
 The Congress therefore has no means of
 evaluating  or  controlling these  large
 sums to any precise degree.
 It would appear that the only means
 of bringing this matter under any con-
 trol would be to have it as a line item in
 the budget in order that it can be pre-
 sented and justified in the normal way. I
 point this out in order for the Depart-
 ment of Defense to be on notice with
 respect to the intention of the committee
 of having detailed hearings and bringing
 about some change in the way this mat-
 ter is presently being handled.
 SUPPORT FOR SOUTH LAST ASIA FORCES
 Mr. President, the limitation of $2.5
 billion contained in the Senate version
 of section 401 was retained by the con-
 ferees. The added language regarding the
 use of these funds for the support of local
 forces in Laos and Thailand was rejected
 by the House conferees because of its
 ambiguity. As the Senate may recall, this
 latter item was Senator COOPER's floor
 amendment, which was adopted.
 NUCLEAR CARRIER STUDY
 The House version contained no pro-
 vision similar to the Senate version re-
 quiring a study for the CVAN-70 prior to
 any authorization. As finally adopted
 there will be a joint study by both the
 committees prior to the authorization of
 any additional carrier.
 EXPANSION OF AUTHORIZATION AUTHORITY
 The House version would have ex-
 tended the requirement for authoriza-
 tion legislation prior to appropriations to
 ",all other vehicles, weapons and ammu-
 nition." This matter was compromised
 by the adoption of language limiting this
 expansion to other weapons with this
 term being limited principally to artil-
 lery, rifles, small weapons, and the like,
 as defined specifically in the statement
 of managers.
 TROOP STRENGTH CEILING
 The conferees adopted the House ver-
 sion an the active duty ceiling which pro-
 vides that after July 1, 1970, not more
 than 3,285,000 personnel may be on ac-
 tive duty in the Armed Forces unless a
 Presidential exception is made.
 CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WARFARE
 Mr. President, the conferees agreed to
 what might be considered a compromise
 in both the House and Senate versions of
 this matter. Senator MCINTYRE will ex-
 plain this matter fully, but I would point
 out that the new language requires the
 following :

 First, that Congress bQ_kept informed
 of, all expenditures relating, to, chemical
 and biological warfare.
 Second, that the program, including
 testing and transportation, be conducted
 in amallner gorisist nt with a due regard
 for public health and safety.
 Third, that. the program be conducted
 in a mariner".which respects the sover-
 eign independence of other nations and
 U.S. ,obligations under internatioal law.
 Ili addition, it prohibits procurement of
 systems specifically -designed for dis-
 seminating lethal chemical and biologi-
 cal agents except with the approval of
 the President. The bill underscores con-
 gressional determination to keep this
 program under firm control by directing
 $10.5 million reduction in the program's
 research and development funds.
 GAO AUDIT AND REPORT LANGUAGE
 Mr. President, I regret to say that the
 House was adamant in its refusal to
 adopt the Senate provision requiring
 quarterly reports by the General Ac-
 counting Office of major defense con-
 tractors. This amendment, as we know,
 was offered by Senator SCHWEIKER. The
 -House felt, however, that except for the
 subpena power, existing procedures al-
 lowing this type of reporting was not
 justified.
 PROVISIONS IN THE HOUSE BILL NOT ADOPTED BY
 CONFEREES
 .Mr. President, in order that there may
 be a record on the cooperation between
 the two groups I would like to point out
 the provisions contained in the House
 version which were dropped altogether
 by the conferees: Language requiring for
 the mandatory procurement and storage
 of supplies for Reserves; a Deputy As-
 sistant Secretary of Defense for Dental
 Affairs; lieutenant general rank for the

 Chief of the National Guard Bureau and

 Reserve; language requiring a travel al-
 lowance for overseas travel for military
 dependents attending college; a special
 provision regarding retired pay; special
 language requiring destroyer construc-
 tion in at least three shipyards, and lan-
 guage which would have required report-
 ing to the Senate and House and a 60-
 day waiting period for all research and
 development contracts with colleges and
 universities.
 I cite the foregoing, Mr. President, to
 indicate the fact that although the Sen-
 ate did not retain all of its provisions the
 House likewise did not prevail in many
 of the items adopted by that body.
 There being no objection, the fiscal
 data charts were ordered to be printed in
 the RECORD, as follows:
