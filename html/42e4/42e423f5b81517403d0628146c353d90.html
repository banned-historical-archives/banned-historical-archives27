 Nigeria's military leaders reportedly have decided to provide non-military aid to
 the Luanda-based Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola regime. Lagos
 recognized the regime last month in reaction to South Africa's much publicized
 support for the Movement's rivals.
 A Popular Movement delegation led by the prime minister of the Luanda
 regime, Lopo de Nasciemento, recently visited Lagos and met with Head of State
 Brigadier Muhammed. The Nigerian government later released a statement pledging
 Nigeria's moral and material support for the Popular Movement until "victory over
 racists and their imperialistic supporters" is won. Nasciemento, on returning to
 Luanda, told reporters that the talks laid the "political foundations" which could
 lead to the conclusion of agreements with Nigeria in the economic, commercial, and
 technical training fields.
 Apparently the Popular Movement delegation explored the possibility of
 Nigerian military assistance as well. The ruling 22-man Supreme Military Council
 reportedly has decided, however, that Nigeria would not provide troops under any
 foreseeable circumstances, nor any military equipment for now. Foreign Minister
 Garba has also stated publicly that his government does not foresee at this stage any
 possible involvement of its troops in Angola.
 Despite its support for the Popular Movement, Nigeria apparently still holds
 out some hope for the formation of a government of national unity as a way of
 ending the fighting inasmuch as no one Angolan group can claim a majority of
 popular support. Nigerian delegations currently are touring all African capitals to
 explain Nigeria's position on Angola and to exchange views on how to stop the
 fighting in Angola.
 The Nigerians recognize that a major obstacle to a political solution is the
 intransigence of the Popular Movement itself. By providing appreciable aid, Lagos
 may hope to gain greater leverage with Popular Movement leaders and thereby
 encourage them to adopt a more accommodating attitude toward a political
 settlement. It seems unlikely, however, that the Popular Movement could be
 persuaded to become any more forthcoming.

 Lagos may also see economic aid as a way of enabling the Popular Movement to
 resist Soviet domination. The Nigerians regard the Popular Movement leaders, for all
 their Marxist rhetoric, as pragmatic African nationalists who will not willingly foster
 a client state relationship with the Soviet Union. The extensive Soviet involvement
 in Angola on the Popular Movement's behalf deeply concerns the Nigerians, and
 Lagos reportedly is determined to do what it can to prevent the Popular Movement
 from  becoming  irretrievably mortgaged to  Moscow.

 The Soviets yesterday outlined a five-year plan for 1976-80 that commits the
 country to lower, more realistic goals, according to most of the indicators made
 available.
 The highest targets are in the agricultural sector: investment is to be further
 increased, and the annual grain harvest is set close to the record level. Thrift,
 efficiency, and quality of production are stressed, and there is little encouragement
 for the consumer to expect anything more than a gradual increase in the standard of
 living. This was foreshadowed in the 1976 plan announced earlier this month.
 The new plan figures highlight the following increases projected over the
 five-year period:
 --Agriculture-14-17  percent versus 37-40 percent originally planned  for
 1971-75. The goal for grain is set at 215-220 million metric tons a year, a
 harvest achieved only once before. The already heavy investment program in
 agriculture will be further emphasized, rising from 131 billion rubles in
 1971-75 to 172 billion rubles in 1976-80.
 --Industry-35-39 percent versus 47 percent originally planned in 1971-75.
 Heavy industry is to grow by 38-42 percent and light industry by 30-32
 percent. The 1976-80 plan thus continues the midterm reversal of the current
 plan, which had promised to accelerate the production of consumer goods
 faster than that of producer goods.
 --National Income (roughly comparable to the Western concept of gross
 national product)-24-28 percent compared with 39 percent originally set for
 1971-75.
 --Wages-16-18 percent for salaried workers, with earnings of collective farmers
 to increase by 24-27 percent in line with the current policy of reducing the
 discrepancy between the two groups.
 --Foreign Trade-30-35 percent in volume, roughly comparable to the increase
 planned for 1971-75.
 The 1976-80 preview, while acknowledging the negative impact on the
 economy caused by weather-connected harvest failures, criticized production
 shortfalls and other shortcomings in the non-agricultural sectors as well. The report
 also carried a formulation that made official the 1975 harvest figure of 137 million
 tons, which  had  been derived  from a statement made earlier this month.

 Heavy fighting continued in Beirut over the weekend. Radical leftist forces
 under the control of Ibrahim Qulaylat yesterday continued their efforts to drive
 Christian militiamen from the Holiday Inn, the last Phalangist foothold in the hotel
 district. The Phalangists have denied leftist claims that they are surrounded and
 claim that their forces are advancing into the nearby Jewish quarter, which changed
 hands twice last week.
 According to a press report, the leftists on Saturday offered to withdraw from
 the hotel and commerical areas if the Phalangists and Lebanese army units in the
 two areas were replaced by internal security forces. A Phalangist official reportedly
 described the leftist proposal as a "political maneuver" and insisted that the army
 remain in position.
 Fighting also continued in other areas of the country. Muslim and Christian
 forces clashed in the Tripoli-Zagharta area, and fighting continued in Zahle.
 Christians in the Baalbek area were reportedly attacked by Muslims in retaliation for
 attacks last week by Phalangists.
 The failure of the latest cease-fire-announced Friday-to take hold is due at
 least in part to the inability of the Palestine Liberation Organization to exercise
 control over radical Muslim elements.
 Damascus may itself again be attempting to find a political solution. Former prime
 minister Abdullah Yafi, a traditional Muslim leader, flew to visit Damascus over the
 weekend after meeting with Karami. Other reports indicate that leftist leader Kamal
 Jumblatt has been summoned to the Syrian capital. This activity may be in
 preparation for another attempt by Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam to mediate
 the crisis. According to press reports, Khaddam is scheduled to visit Beirut early this
 week, perhaps today.

 The EC is making good progress on Greek accession but faces new difficulties
 in its relationship with Turkey.
 A favorable EC Commission opinion on Greek membership is virturally assured,
 even though some delay is being caused by the number of Commission officials who
 want to put forth their ideas on the philosophy underlying the expansion of the EC.
 The technical work is going smoothly. A favorable decision in principle on Greek
 membership seems likely next March or April.
 The next step will be to draw up a negotiating mandate. If the Commission and
 all nine member states participate in the negotiations, as is likely, the mandate can
 be fairly general and could be ready in September. Athens is so eager for an accord
 that the Greeks have indicated they may not even cause problems in the touchy area
 of meeting EC requirements on farm trade. Negotiations will nevertheless take at
 least a year, and must be followed by ratification of the member states and the
 Greek parliament.
 Progress toward Greek accession will accentuate EC problems with Turkey,
 which is concerned about what precise political and economic advantages Greece
 will derive from accession. The Turks are already worried by an erosion of Turkey's
 benefits under its association agreement with the EC, and a group of businessmen
 will visit Brussels next week to discuss the problem. In the first six months of 1975,
 Turkey's exports to the EC fell 40 percent, while imports from the EC rose 45
 percent. The remittances of Turks working in Europe have fallen about 7 percent
 this year.
 The issue of Turkish workers in Europe is likely to pose an especially difficult
 problem. Ankara believes the ten-year period under the association agreement for a
 gradual granting of free movement of Turkish workers to the Community must be
 reduced. It wants the Turks to be given the same rights as nationals of the EC Nine
 in the shortest possible time. The Greeks will have these rights with accession.
 A few Turks already question whether Ankara might gain more economic and
 political advantages by closer relations with Middle Eastern countries rather than
 with the EC.

 West Germany reportedly has decided to give the Portuguese air force six G-91
 jet trainers. According to the US defense attache in Bonn, the story appeared in the
 press during the first week of December, when the decision reportedly was made. An
 article in the December 12 edition of Die Welt discussed the transfer, and added that
 five Portuguese pilots would be trained by the Luftwaffe at no cost.
 The G-91s, now being phased out of the West German air force, offer Bonn a
 cheap but effective means of providing military security assistance to a NATO ally in
 need. The gift is another example of Bonn's efforts to cultivate relations with the
 Portuguese, and particularly the military, with an eye toward  influencing
 developments in Lisbon. Last week, the West Germans signed an agreement under
 which they will grant Portugal about $27 million in capital aid.
 The G-91 is an old but reliable trainer and light ground-attack aircraft that will
 be a welcome addition to Portugal's obsolete air force. The US defense attache in
 Lisbon reported in early October that the air force's pilot-training program has been
 suffering because of a lack of flyable training aircraft.
 The G-91s should not only help improve Portuguese air force morale, but will
 also strengthen the position of anti-Communists who wish to re-establish strong
 military ties with NATO.

 London recently informed the US that it intends to sell Peking 50 Rolls Royce
 Spey 202 engines-the engine used in the British version of the F-4 Phantom
 fighter-and to pass on the technology necessary to manufacture the engines.
 The sale is the result of negotiations over the past three to four years between
 the two countries. Objections to the sale have previously been made by the US
 within the Coordinating Committee on Trade with Communist Countries, but the
 US will not try to block the sale. The Soviets also have complained in the past
 through diplomatic channels.
 London, however, is determined to proceed with the sale, believing that the
 Chinese gain is not great since they would gain only two or three years in the
 development of a similar engine. Additionally, London believes that the sale will not
 significantly effect the strategic balance and that the technology to be transferred is
 not new or unique. The UK stated that the engine being sold is only a more
 powerful version of the Spey 512, which powers the Trident aircraft already in the
 Chinese civil air fleet.
 The acquisition of this engine and the related technology will, however, give
 the Chinese an advanced technology base for future systems and shorten the
 development time for certain advanced weapons systems. The elimination of
 deficiencies in some current Chinese programs will represent a considerable savings.

 ANNEX
 China's Tachai Campaign
 China has undertaken a massive campaign aimed at achieving major increases in
 agricultural production.
 The new campaign, which has come to dominate Chinese press and radio and
 shape much of the activity on the political and economic scene, appears at this early
 stage to be a greater effort to galvanize the countryside than any since the ill-fated
 great leap forward of 1958-1959.
 The campaign is being carried out under the banner, "Learn from Tachai."
 Tachai is the name of a poor production brigade in a commune in Shansi Province. It
 was held up ten years ago as a model for the nation for the great strides that it had
 made in increasing production without state aid.
 The new campaign is essentially an effort built on the Tachai experience, to use
 China's human resources to provide irrigation and drainage to a much larger area of
 land. The goal is to extend these facilities to one third of China's counties by 1980.
 If this can be done, China could be producing agricultural surpluses by 1980.
 Chinese leaders have repeatedly pointed to the importance of such a surplus to their
 long-term goal of modernizing China's industry, defense, science, and technology.
 The blueprint of the Tachai campaign was approved at a national conference on
 agriculture convened in September, attended by most of China's top leaders. Since
 then domestic media have focused almost exclusively on Tachai-related activities.
 In Vice Premier Hua Kuo-feng's speech at the meeting as well as in the media
 after the meeting, the Tachai campaign has been placed on a par with the land
 reform and agricultural collectivization movements of the 1950s. A Chinese official
 in Hong Kong recently went so far as to describe the campaign as a "historical
 turning point for China."
 The concepts involved in the campaign are not new but are a blending and
 modifying of past agricultural policies. Tachai counties will be subsidized, at least in
 part, from Peking's coffers. In this respect the current movement is similar to a
 program during the mid-1960s that channeled state investment into limited areas
 offering the greatest potential for quick, cheap, and secure returns.

 There is, however, an important difference. Under the earlier program the state
 absorbed most of the expenses, whereas under the Tachai concept the state will pay
 only a small share of the costs.
 The rest will have to come from the mobilization of agricultural labor for such
 things as the construction of water control projects, the digging of wells, and the
 leveling and terracing of land. The Chinese press is again stressing the importance of
 not relying on the state for financial aid.
 Another, but lesser campaign-the dictatorship of the proletariat-is in part
 aimed at ensuring that enough labor will be available for these collective activities.
 Permissive policies introduced in late 1970 that relaxed controls over private
 activities in the countryside have apparently gotten out of hand, and Peking is now
 cracking down in an effort to channel energies back into collective activities.
 The Tachai campaign's emphasis on better performance from rural party
 workers-particularly at the county level-is no doubt related to concerns about
 private enterprise and corruption in the countryside. More ambitious agricultural
 goals would, in any event, have called forth a tightening of the rural party apparatus.
 In an apparent effort to increase the quality of leadership in the countryside,
 urban party workers are being sent down to work alongside their rural colleagues.
 The New China News Agency recently reported that more than one million cadres in
 12 provinces have gone to the villages.
 If the new program is to succeed, productivity of rural laborers will have to be
 raised. To this end, "basic mechanization" has been singled out for special emphasis.
 By "basic mechanization" the Chinese mean the use of machinery to supplement
 labor during peak farming seasons.
 Hua Kuo-feng has said that mechanization of tilling, drainage, irrigation, and
 transportation would amount to a doubling of China's rural labor force. China,
 despite its millions, does suffer acute seasonal shortages of farm labor caused by
 increasing the scale of multiple cropping and construction projects.
 An effort of the magnitude of the Tachai campaign is probably only possible
 because of the general strengthening of the party apparatus, which was crippled
 during the cultural revolution. The campaign's emphasis on tighter party discipline
 and better performance suggests that Peking not only expects to capitalize on the
 recent strengthening of the party apparatus but to further this process in the course
 of the campaign.

 This approach-and indeed the tenor of the Tachai campaign in general-is
 strongly reminiscent of the great economic campaigns of the mid-1950s and of the
 style and methods of Teng Hsiao-ping, who, together with Hua Kuo-feng, appears to
 be the major force behind the effort.
 A Dependence on Weather
 Can the goals of the admittedly ambitious Tachai campaign be attained?
 One thing is clear: Chinese agriculture is still dominated by traditional,
 labor-intensive cultivation techniques and will continue to be so dominated despite
 accelerated investment in industries that support agriculture. Harvests will still
 depend on the weather.
 Thus far, the Tachai campaign is emphasizing a sober, step-by-step approach
 and a strict accountability of lower to higher authority. But the scope of the
 campaign, the emotional undertone of the exhortations, the brake on material
 incentives, and the grandiose goals are all reminiscent of the great leap forward.
 It is thus possible that the Tachai campaign could get out of hand, as did the
 great leap, the cultural revolution, and the anti-Confucius campaign. This would
 amost certainly ensure an eventual backlash and consequent retrenchment. The
 dominant leaders in Peking will guard against such a possibility.
 If the Chinese can improve water management and supply the needed mix of
 manufactured items for agriculture, they could perhaps achieve rapid production
 increases by the end of the decade.
 This would fall short of a real breakthrough, which would require substantial
 improvement in number and quality of China's corps of agricultural scientists.
 Peking reportedly has drawn up a new plan for education, but time is far too short
 for China to produce by 1980 anywhere near the number of scientists needed. This
 plan also ignores the time required for a concerted program of basic research to bear
 fruit.
 The massive redirection of farm labor from private plots and sideline
 production to collective activities will be at the expense of the peasants' standard of
 living. If the campaign is conducted with a degree of restraint, the gains in the
 productivity of land over the long run will make these short-run costs worthwhile.
 If, on the other hand, new policies are carried out harshly, peasant morale will be
 adversely affected, the rural economy dislocated, and agricultural production
 reduced.
