 13 JANUARY 1971
 INDOCHINA
 Sec,A.etary Laird's trip to Saigon provides a current peg for
 Vietnamese communist charges that the United States is intent
 on continuing aggression in Indochina through Vietnamization
 and the Nixon Doctrine.  President Nixon's remarks in his
 4 January TV interview as well as Laird's statements continue
 to be cited as evidence of U.S. hypocrisy regarding a
 political settlement of the Vietnam issue.  And there is
 routine stress--at the Paris talks and in comment--on the
 basic demand that the United States agree to a timetable for
 a total troop withdrawal.
 Propagandists continue to deplore U.S. "threats" of air strikes
 against the DRV, and on 11 January the DRV Foreign Ministry
 spokesman protested U.S. action on the 8th in which planes
 "fired rockets on an area three kilometers off the coast
 of Ha Tinh Province."
 Routine Moscow comment also scores both the President and
 Secretary Laird for only paying lip service to peace while
 continuing to expand aggression.  Soviet commentators say
 that a prime motive of Laird's trip was to implement the
 Nixon Doctrine of "using Asians to fight Asians."
 Peking's reaction to the President's 4 January rem:.rks on
 Vietnam is limited to a single NCNA commentary, carried only
 in the news agency's Chinese-language transmission on the
 9th.  NCNA rejects the President's statements about U.S.-DRV
 understandings in connection with the Lalt to U.S. bombing
 of the North and denounces the President as a "war criminal."
 EVIDENCE OF "AGGRESSION" SEEN IN REMARKS BY PRESIDENT, LAIRD
 President Nixon's remarks on Vietnam in his 4 January TV
 interview were scored at the 98th Paris session on 7 January
 along the lines of initial Hanoi and Front comment, with
 both DRV delegate Xuan Thuy and PRG Foreign Minister Mme. Binh
 casting doubt on his sincerity regarding a political settle-
 ment.  The VNA account notes that Mme. Binh questioned how
 the President could state that the United States was "on the
 way out of the Vietnam war in a way that would bring a just
 peace" when, she claimed, he in fact "has turned Johnson's

 13 JANUARY 1971
 war into his own and has even extended it to the whole of
 Indochina."  According to the account, Xuan Thuy said that
 the President in his TV interview and Secretary Laird at
 his Paris news conference on the 6th "made a wholly
 erroneous analysis of the Vietnam problem, or to be more
 precise, gave a tendentious assessment of it."
 VNA also reports Thuy's complaint that the President spoke
 only of the withdrawal of combat troops, not of all. troops,
 and of ending the U.S. combat role, not the U.S. '!military
 occupation," and that Laird "said explicitly" that a number
 of infantry as well as air force and logistic units will
 remain.  The President's remarks on the troop-withdrawal
 issue are also scored by NHAN DAN on the 7th and 8th, with
 a Commentator article on the 7th complaining that the
 President "still refuses to announce a definite deadline
 for the withdrawal of all troops" and observing that after
 May 1971 there will still be 280,000 U.S. troops in South
 Vietnam.  Unlike other reaction to the interview, Commentator
 acknowledges that the President was asked whether the United
 States would intervene after the bulk of U.S. troops were
 withdrawn if--as Commentator puts it--the Saigon Administration
 were in danger of being overthrown."  Commentator says the
 President's "evasive" answer demonstrated his policy of
 prolonging the war, his refusal to witndrww U.S. troops, and
 his "persistent effort" to support the GVN.
 Commentators and the delegates at Paris also took issue with
 the President's account of U.S. achievements in South
 Vietnam.  VNA. reports that Mme. Binh countered by noting
 that 11420,000 enemy troops, including. 110,000 GI's, were
 put out of action in.1D70."  These statistics from the PLAF
 Command's year-end communique--although Mme. Binh did not
 identify them as such--are cited in much of the comment in
 rebuttal of the President.  Xuan Thuy in his statement not
 only cited the 1970 statisticG but recalled the allegation
 that in 1969 the communists "put out of action" 640,000
 troops, including 230,000 U.S. and other foreign forces.
 The VNA account, however, does not report this.
 Like earlier Hanoi comment on the President's interview,
 Xuan Thuy referred to the "myth about an understanding,"
 saying that although the DRV has rejected it, the President
 "persevered in reiterating it to have a pretext for resuming
 air attacks on north Vietnam."  VNA does not note his

 13 JANUARY 1971
 citation of the President's remark that if the DRV says there
 is no understanding then "there is no restraint on us," which
 Thuy labelled even more "cynical" than the "understanding myth."
 The NHAN DAN Commentator article of the 7th also notes that
 the President "brazenly" repeated the allegation about an
 "understanding" which the DRV has rejected.  It adds that
 the President said that the United States will continue
 reconnaissance flights and that if these aircraft are fired
 upon, U.S. planes will strike at DRV anti-aircraft positions.
 But like earlier comment, the article glosses over the
 details of the President's explanation of his understanding.
 Both Hanoi and the Front continue to comment on Laird's
 trip to Southeast Asia, with a QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article on
 the 13th saying he acted as an advertiser for the President's
 professed "peaceful desire."  But commentators uniformly
 see the true purposes of the tour as connected with the
 effort to step up Vietnamization and with a quest for ways
 to improve Cambodia's "deteriorating" situation and to
 increase U.S. military aid to Thailand.
 MEDIA IGNORE DRV SPOKESMAN ON POW LIST. KOSYGIN INTERVIEW
 POW ISSUE     The VNA account of the 7 January Paris session
 does not mention that Ambassador Bruce again
 raised the question of U.S. POW's held in the DRV.  In
 keeping with standard practice, Hanoi media have not
 publicized the post-session briefing by DRV press spokesman
 Nguyen Thanh Le in which he brought up the question of the
 POW list given by the DRV last month to Senators F'.ilbright
 and Kennedy.  Thk3 VNA account of the session merely notes
 that the U.S. and GVN delegates "again resorted to perfidious
 allegations to plead for their aggressive stand."  It thus
 ignores Ambassador Bruce's criticism of the DRV's "cynical
 exposure of prisoners of war to public curiosity for
 propaganda purposes" as demonstrated by the recent film
 made by a Canadian television correspondent.
 Nguyen Thanh Le in the post-session Paris briefing on the 7th,
 transmitted in VNA's Paris-to-Hanoi service channel the next
 day, betrayed sensitivity t,) U.S. charges that the list of
 prisoners of war held in the DRV is incomplete.  Le said
 that in response to requests "we provided a full and complete

 list of U.S. pilots captured in North Vietnam," and he went
 on to rebut U.S. references to inconsistency with a previous
 list.
 The last known mentions of the POW list in DRV media were in
 the statement by the DRV spokesman in Paris released 26 Deuftmber
 and in a NHAN DAN Commentator article of the 27th which scored
 remarks by Secretary Rogers at his 23 December press conference.
 KOSYGIN        Both Hanoi and Front media carried brief reports
 INTERVIEW      of some of Kosygin's remarks on Vietnam in his
 written response to the Tokyo ASAHI, but they do
 not acknowledge his assertion--reported by TASS on 2 January--
 that "the Soviet Union is ready, on its part, to further
 facilitate the attainment of a political settlement in
 Indochina."
 DRV press spokesman Nguyen Thanh Le was not directly responsive
 to a question about Kosygin's.remark at his press briefing on
 the 7th, saying only that "in many statements the USSR has
 shown the United States the way to extricate itself from the
 Vietnam quagmire, namely to withdraw all its troops."
 DRV PROTESTS AIR STRIKE, RELEASES WAR CRIMES COMMUNIQUE
 On 11 January a statement by the DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman
 charged that on the 8th U.S. planes "fired rockets on Rn area
 three kilometers off the coast of Ha Tinh Province to the east
 of the Cua Sot rivermouth, North Vietnam."  The statement
 "sternly condemned that act of war" of the United States and
 routinely warned that DRV territorial waters, land, and
 airspace are inviolable.  It expressed the determination of
 the Vietnamese people "to punish any U.S. encroachment on
 DRV sovereignty and security and any acts of war against it."
 This incident appears to be one belateily acknowledged by
 the U.S. Command in Saigon on the l2th.*  Hanoi has apparently
 *  A U.S. spokesman said that u Shrike missile was fired at
 an antiaircraft missile site--whose radar was tracking an
 unarmed U.S. reconnaissance plane and its fighter escort--
 100 miles north of the DMZ but that the missile missed the
 site and landed in the sea.

 not acknowledged another incident on the 8th in which,
 according to the U.S. Command on the 9th, a U.S. strike was
 made in the DRV east of the Mugia Pass and some 55 miles
 north of the DMZ.
 WAR CRIMES     VNA on 8 January released a communique of
 COMMUNIQUE     the DRV War Crimes Commission listing alleged
 U.S. war crimes during December in North and
 South Vietnam.  The charges are for the most part routine,
 and there is the familiar complaint that U.S. "crimes" were
 intensified during the month.  In South Vietnam, the
 communique enumerates such "crimes" as those committed
 during pacification operations and bombings, the supplying
 of U.S. naval equipment to the GVN navy, and "intensified
 activities of U.S. warships."
 VNA says the communique "denounced with particular
 vehemence the intensified U.S. air reconnaissance flights
 in Ncrth Vietnam and the encroachments on DRV sovereignty
 and security."  In addition, it lists alleged U.S. tactical
 air raids against Lai Chau, Ha Tinh, and Quang Binh
 provinces and tactical and strategic B-52 raids against Vinh
 Linh area.
 MOSCOW SAYS REMARKS BY PRESIDENT, LAIRD MEAN MORE ESCALATION
 Moscow continues to score U.S. "aggression" in Indochina in
 routine-level comment on President Nixon's 4 January TV
 interview and Secretary Laird's trip to Paris, Bangkok, and
 Saigon.  An 8 January SOVIET RUSSIA article assails the
 "hypocrisy" of the President's comment that "we can now
 see the end of America's combat role in V.Ietnam" and observes
 that on the eve of the interview U.S. planes, including B-52's,
 carried out heavy strikes on South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia
 and that there are continued U.S. "threats" to renew bombing
 of the DRV.  A 10 January PRAVDA article includes Laird's
 trip among "international developments in the first 10 days
 of 1971," saying that it has no connection with "genuinely
 peaceful efforts" and may even be "linked with reports of
 preparations for a resumption of widescale U.S. air operations
 against the DRV."
 TASS on the 6th, reporting Laird's press conference in Paris,
 noted that he praised Vietnamization and expressed "pessimism"
 regarding the prospects of a peace settlement at the Paris

 talks.  Reporting his press conference in Saigon, a domestic
 service broadcast on the 11th said that he indicated that the
 United States will step up its Vietnamization program but
 that he avoided specific numbers when he spoke of the
 "gradual withdrawal" of American troops.
 Other comment also stresses that Laird's trip was aimed at
 assessing the progress of Vietnamization and at implementing
 the Nixon Doctrine.  A domestic service broadcast on the 7th
 quoted Laird as saying "frankly" upon his arrival in Bangkok
 that the aim of his trip was to strengthen military aid to
 Washington's allies in Southeast AbIS and that this was what
 the President meant when he spoke of Vietnamization in his
 IV interview.  In thi: connection, a Moscow broadcast in Thai
 on the 8th said that American officials visiting Saigon
 inevitably stop off in Bangkok, not merely because it is en
 route but because they believe the success of the Vietnamization
 program depends on how much support Thailand gives the Saigon
 government.  Commentaries have also cited U.S. aid to Cambodia
 as further evidence of plans for continued aggression in the
 area, and Moscow on the 10th said that the Chairman of the
 Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Moorer, was being sent
 "urgently" to Cambodia to study the military situation there.
 PEKING SCORES 4 JANUARY NIXON STATEMENTS ON "UNDERSTANDINGS"
 Peking's only comment on the President's statements about
 Vietnam in his 4 January television conversation comes in a
 9 January commentary by NCNA correspondent Ou Ping, transmitted
 only in the news agency's Chinese-language service.  The NCNA
 correspondent routinely rejects the President's assertion
 that there is an "understanding" allowing unhindered aerial
 reconnaissance over the DRV.  He notes derisively that the
 President, in addition, "nonsensically dished out a kind of
 new 'understanding"' that "only the U.S. aggressor troops
 are allowed to remain in South Vietnam, but the Vietnamese
 people are not allowed to oppose aggression," and that the
 DRV will be bombed if the security of U.S. troops is not
 insured.
 Ou Ping maintains that "the Vietnamese people, the Indochinese
 people, and the world's revolutionary people will not now and
 can never reach an 'understanding' with the U.S. aggressors--
 an understanding of the theory that it is right to commit
 aggression and the theory of aggression for security."

 Deriding President Nixon for citing the word of members of the
 former administration to document the existence of a U.S.-DRV
 understanding, Ou Ping says he used as witnesses "a group of
 stinking war criminals."  The commentary lists President
 Johnson and Secretar es Rusk and Clifford but does not mention
 that the President also cited Amba'sador Harriman in this
 context.
 LPA COI41UN I QUE CONDENIVS ALLIED `VIOLATIONS' OF CEASE-FIRES
 Liberation Radio on 7 January broadcast an LPA communique of
 that date accusing the allies of committing 303 violations of
 the communists' three-day cease-fir's over the Christmas and
 New Year holidays.*  LPA charges that the allies "brazenly
 violated" the PRG cease-fire order on a "widespread basis"
 and even conducted sweeps on Christmas day when the allied
 truce was in effect.  The communist forces strictly observed
 the cease-fire order, according to the communique, and did
 not take the initiative in attacking.  Numerous specific
 allied actions during the two cease-fires are charged in the
 communique, which declares that "the PRG severely warns the
 U.S. Government and its puppets about these crimes and that
 they will Continue to be punished appropriately."  The
 communique reiterates the PRG order for a four-day cease-fire
 over the Tet holiday--fror^ 26 to 30 January.

 MIDDLE EAST
 MOSCOW CAUTIOUS ON PROSPECTS FOR JARRING CONTACTS
 Commenting on the resumption of the Jarring talks, Moscow con-
 tinues to profess the opinion that "full objective conditions"
 exist for the success of the mission, but cautions that serious
 difficulties lie ahead.  Propaganda asserts that Israel is making
 prior conditions, unacceptable to the Arabs, and is continuing to
 evade implementing the "main condition" for a settlement, that of
 full Israeli withdrawal.  A panelist on the 10 January Moscow
 domestic service commentators' roundtable maintains that success
 of the Jarring mission depends wholly on the approach of the two
 sides to the "key clause" of Security Council Resolution 242 on
 withdraw t, and routinely contrasts UAR and Jordanian positions
 .ith Israeli insistence on the impossibility of returning to old
 i :-ontiers .
 Treating the two sides' attitudes in more detail, a Lunev domestic
 service commentary on 6 January noted that the UAR and Jordan are
 ready to end the state of war with Israel and sign a "corresponding
 multilateral document" with the "necessary condition" of full
 Israeli withdrawal.  Isra:,I, however, demands a revision of borders
 and insists on the conclusion of bilateral treaties with each Arab
 country separately, the commentator said, "although discussion of
 this question is not even within Jarring's competence."
 JARRING       Dealing with Dr. Jarring's 8-9 January talks in Israel,
 IN ISRAEL     Moscow cites unspecified press comment and journalists'
 views to the effect that Israel is trying to replace
 substantive discussions with procedural issues.  TASS' New York
 correspondent Pivovarov on the llth says journalists at the United
 Nations believe the Israeli leaders have taken a stand which cannot
 facilitate a peaceful settlement, and he refers to press reports that
 Jarring was presented with "ultimatums" and a map of the Arab
 territories Israel intends to keep.  A foreign-language commentary
 by Tsoppi on the 11th asserts that U.S. and Israeli propaganda is
 trying to create the impression that Jarring was given a "brand new
 and very constructive plan" for settling the Middle East question,
 but that the Western press has reportedtthere is nc real change in
 Israel's stand.
 TASS on the 9th asserted that Israel was pressuring Jarring in
 order to channel the talks in the direction it wanted, that of
 indefinite prolongation of the cease-fire agreement and transferral
 of the contacts from New York to the Mediterranean,  Noting that "a

 certain mechanism" for carrying out the talks had been formed
 at the United Nations, it characterized the demand for a change
 of venue as an effort to disrupt the talks.
 The issue of the level of the talks as well as the venue is
 raised in a Moscow domestic service broadcast of a dispatch by
 Cairo correspondent RE.ssadin on the 8th:  It says that Israel's
 desire "to take the talks away from UN control" is shown by its
 proposal to transfer them to Cyprus and hold them at foreign-
 minister level.  On the other hand, TASS on the 9th reported with-
 out comment that UAR Foreign Minister Riyad in his Paris press
 conference said that he was empowered to hold talks with Jarring
 and "at the latter's suggestion their meeting is to be held in New
 York."  (A Moscow Arabic-language broadcast, as well as Cairo radio,
 had reported Riyad's 23 December meeting with Jarring while in
 Moscow as a member of 'Ali Sabri's delegation.)
 CEASE-FIRE     While Moscow has seemed reluctant to publicly express
 EXTENSION      its views on the desirability of a cease-fire exten-
 sion, panelist Beglov, on the commentators' roundtable
 on the 10th, notes that the cease-fire period will end in less than
 a month, on 5 February, and comments that "it is clear that the
 Jarring mission can work only when the guns are silent."  He goes on
 to cite UAR Foreign Minister Riyad as saying that if Israel is prepared
 to implement the Security Council resolution, the cease-fire agreement
 "could be extended for an unlimited period."  TASS on the 6th had
 reported Riyad as making this remark at a London press conference;
 on the 9th it cited him as telling newsmen in Paris that it would
 be vain for Israel to hope for an "endless prolongation" of the
 cease-fire, which would mean permanent occupation of Arab lands.
 TASS in reporting recent speeches by UAR President as-Sadat has
 pointed up remarks to the effect that Egypt does not seek to
 initiate military action after the expiration of the cease-fire
 agreement on 5 February.  Thus it quoted him as refuting, in a
 speech to Asyut University professors on the 10th, "bellicose
 statements attributed to me in the Western press" to the effect
 that Egypt's intention not to prolong the cease-fire agreement means
 the UAR will declare war on 5 February.  TASS cited him as stating
 that he never said he would declare war on this date, but only
 that "after this date we shall not consider ourselves bound by
 the cease-fire agreement."  And in briefly reporting his speech
 at the Supreme Court in Cairo on the 12th, TASS highlighted his
 remark that "he and the government of the republic 'will make
 every effort to avoid bloodshed' after the expiration of the

 term of the cease-fire agreement."  The MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY
 (MENA)--to which TABS attributed its account--merely reports
 as-Sadat as saying that "it was announced in the United States
 that I am prepared to go to the end of the world if this pre-
 vents one of our soldiers from being wounded."  This remark is
 not linked to the cease-fire expiration.
 Since the Ponomarev communique of 20 December endorsed the idea
 of a withdrawal timetable, Moscow has given little further publi-
 city to Cairo's variously stated call for a timetable, either
 for Israeli withdrawal or for implementation of Resolution 242, as
 a condition for further extension of the cease-fire agreement.
 .PASS on the 11th did note as-Sadat as saying in his recent CBS
 interview that "if no settlement is reached" during the Jarring
 contacts, the UAR will not agree to prolongation of the cease-fire
 agreement.  And in a speech at an Asyut rally on the 11th, accord-
 ing to TAGS, he called for a "clear-cut plan" for withdrawal as
 the condition for an extension.
 UAR ON BIG FOUR,      Moscow has also failed to give propaganda
 SECURITY COUNCIL      support to the Egyptian call--explained by
 AL-AHRAM on 13 January--for Big Four direc-
 tives to Jarring* calling for a timetable for implementation of
 Resolution 242 or, failing this, for a Security Council meeting
 before the end of January to discuss implementation of the resolu-
 tion.  TASS' short reports on recent as-Sadat speeches do not
 touch on his proposals for the Big Four or the Security Council
 to guarantee a withdrawal timetable (Cairo University on the 8th),
 to intervene to implement Resolution 242 (to Asyut University
 professors on the 10th), to agree with Jarring on a timetable to
 implement the resolution  (Asyut rally on the 11th), or to
 guarantee "specific steps" and a timetable (at the Supreme Court
 in Cairo on the 12th).  Reporting the last speech, TASS merely
 cited the initial part of his remark, that the cease-fire agreement
 would not be prolonged if the Jarring mission "fails to produce
 serious results."
 *  As recently as 4 December, a PRAVDA article by Glukhov noted
 that Cairo supports continuation of the four-power consultations
 with the aim of formulating plans for implementing Resolution 242.
 TASS last summer had cited Nasir as stressing, in his;23 July
 anniversary speech, that Jarring should receive instru tions from
 the Big Four.  And Belyayev, in an article in the 7 4ugust.NEW
 TIMES, had declared it would be "perfectly logical" to activate
 the four-power consultations "to formulate coordinated?recommenda-
 tions" to Jarring.

 Similarly, TAGS in reporting UAR Foreign Minister Riyad's recent
 statements in London and Paris did not mention his remarks along
 the same lines or his comment in Paris, reported by AFP on the
 9th, that the UAR wants Big Four participation in a peacekeeping
 force and "the Soviets, British, and French have shown under-
 standing on the matter,"  (A broadcast in Arabic on 7 August
 last year--apparently Moscow's sole propaganda reference to the
 idea of a joint U.S.-Soviet peacekeeping force--had rejected a
 Washington POST suggestion on a Big Two peace force, calling
 this an attempt to "drag the Soviet Union into U.S. diplomatic
 ways and methods alien to the Soviet Union.")
 NIXON INTERVIEW,     NOVOSTI commentator Katin, in an 8 January

 Nixon's remark in his 1 January television
 interview that the key to peace in the Middle East i.. in the
 hands not only of the two sides directly involved, but also the
 Big Four.  Observing that this is not a new idea, Katie added
 that it is however a "just one," and said that it applied first
 of all to the United States itself.  He made no reference to
 the President's additional remark that "if the Soviet Union does
 not play a conciliatory peace.-making role, there's no chance for
 peace in the Middle East."  But he indirectly responded in going
 on to assert that the Soviet Union from the outset of the con-
 flict had been "tirelessly" making every effort to achieve a
 just solution, and had contributed a "carefully and thoroughly
 drawn up plan for a political settlement."
 Nor did Katin mention--in keeping with Moscow's long silence on
 the question of an embargo on arms to the Middle East--President
 Nixon's further comment on the importance of the Big Four joining
 together in a process of "not having additional arms and additional
 activities go into that area."  Katie did note that the President
 said the United States would continue to support Israel and that
 he recalled that tYa Administration had just provided Israel with
 a $500 million aid program.  This "vast sum" will be used to buy
 arms, Katin said., "inflaming the atmosphere" in the Middle East.
 PODGORNVY ATTENDS ASWAN DAM CELEBRATIONS IN UAR

 a demonstration of the Egyptian people's "loyalty to the road of

 Moscow in its Arabic-language service had broadcast features,
 radio quizzes and other material lauding the high dam.
 Podgornyy's delegation, according to TASS, includes the minister
 and first deputy minister of electric power development and
 electrification and the chief engineer of the Aswan project,
 as well as chairman of the USSR state foreign economic relations
 committee Skachkov, first deputy defense minister Sokolov, and
 deputy foreign minister Rodionov.
 On arrival in Cairo, Podgornyy is reported by Cairo radio as
 saying that during the coming meetings with UAR leaders the sides
 will "exchange views" on f>rther strengthening the "friendship
 and comprehensive cooperation" between the Soviet and Egyptian
 peoples and will discuss "vital questions" in general and pro-
 blems connected with the Middle East situation in particular.
 MOSCOW BLAMES JORDAN CLASHES ON "IMPERIALIST AGENTS"
 As during the fighting in Jordan last September, Moscow reportage
 treats the Jordanian-Palestinian clashes which began on 8 January
 in essentially even-handed fashion, with TASS generally ignoring
 Arab criticism of the Jordanian Government.  Limited comment from
 PRAVDA's Cairo correspondent, and in a foreign-language commentary
 by Tsoppi, professes to see "imperialist agents" behind the incidents.
 And both Moscow's domestic service and TASS report Palestinian
 Liberation Organization (PLO) official Ibrahim Bakr as blaming
 the CIA for the latest events.
 TASS, following developments in Jordan and Cairo, noted as-Sadat's
 call to Arab heads of state to send representatives to Amman for
 an emergency conference.  Sudanese and Libyan leaders were reported
 in one dispatch as viewing the clashes as a violation of the Cairo
 agreement on normalization of the situation in Jordan; while this
 item failed to mention their criticism of the Jordanian Government,
 a subsequent report from Khartoum noted "strong criticism" by
 Sudanese officials of the actions of the government and the Jordanian
 army commaad.  TASS on the 12th reported the joint statement by
 Bnkr and Jordanian Premier at-Tall calling for a cease-fire and
 subsequently reported from Beirut on the 13th that Amman was calm,
 and from Cairo that firing had continued overnight in the Jordanian
 capital.

 MOSCOW       PRAVDA's Glukhov on the 10th cited UAP sources to the
 COMMENT effect that the fault lay with the  Jordanian authori-
 ties," quoting AL-AIIRAM as reporting that the Jordanian
 army had been instructed to "conduct wide-scale operations" against
 Palestinian camps, and noting that an official UAR announcement
 said the "surprise operations" of Jordanian troops were conducted
 "without any justification."  On the 11th, reporting further
 developments, Glukhov found it "impossible not to agree" with the
 Cairo press conclusion that the skirmishes serve only the purpose
 of the Arabs' enemies.  Asserting that there are "serious grounds"
 for supposing that the situation was provoked by imperialist agents,
 Glukhov pointed out that the flareup coincided with the resumption
 of Jarring's mission, which aims at realization of Security Council
 Resolution 242 envisaging Israeli withdrawal and "the just settle-
 ment of the problem of the Palestinian refugees."
 Similarly linking the renewal of clashes with the Jarring mission,
 the Taoppi foreign-language commentary on the 11th recalled that
 Jordan is a party to the talks and more pointedly observed that
 the incidents "are distracting Jordan's attention from the problem
 of providing an overall political settlement within whose framework
 the Palestinian question could also be solved."*  Tsoppi likewise
 attempted to lay the blame on "imperialist agents" with the aim of
 creating inter-Arab friction. Noting that the UAR took the lead in
 proposing collective Arab efforts to eliminate the dispute, he ex-
 pressed the hope that the Arabs "will become friends again" in the
 shortest time.
 *  Moscow had used the same argument last summer in bolstering
 Nasir's acceptance of the U.S. initiative in the face of Arab
 charges of a sellout on the Palestinian issue:  A broadcast in
 Arabic on 4 August had explained that implementation of Resolution
 242 was bound to "make Tel Aviv take into consideration the
 legitimate rights and interests" of the Palestinian people,
 and the next day the same service insisted that realization of
 Resolution 242 "would be an important step along the path of
 completely solving the Palestinian question."

 SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS
 MOSCOW PROPAGANDA SEEKS TO COUNTER CHINESE CHALLENGE
 In the wake of the authoritative polemical exchange triggered by
 the Polish troubles, Moscow has moved to defend its claim to
 authority in the communist movement and to take the measure of
 Peking's more flexible tactics in the ongoing Sino-Soviet rivalry.
 Moscow has recently made special use of the Hungarians as
 spokesmen in its behalf, presumably calculating that the
 Hungarians have the most independent reputation among those
 of its allies willing--as the Romanians would not be--to play
 such a role.  The Romanians, in fact, appear to be a prime
 object of Soviet concern over the impact of Peking's political
 and diplomatic advances.
 Following up its 31 December editorial article responding to
 Peking's anti-Soviet comment on the Polish situation, PRAVDA
 on 6 January belatedly carried a Hungarian assessment of
 Chinese foreign policy that had been published before Peking's
 outburst.  The Hungarian view--that Peking has changed its
 tactics in order to better pursue its "basic course" of
 rivalry with the-Soviet bloc--accords with the line taken in
 Moscow's broadcasts to the Chinese.  In departing from its
 previous practice of restricting comment on China (apart
 from rejoinders to specific attacks) to these broadcasts
 and to weekly publications, Moscow has underscored its
 concern and impatience over Peking's challenge.  Similarly,
 the 31 December editorial article represented a more
 authoritative response than the Mikhaylov PRAVDA article
 on 20 September which answered Chinese attacks on the
 Soviet-FRG treaty.
 In another use of the Hungarians as proxy spokesmen, Moscow
 has broadcast an article by the Hungarian official in charge
 of interparty relations, Z. Komocsin, who played a central
 role in the preparations for the 1969 Moscow international
 conference and who commented on current relations with China
 at the Hungarian party congress last November.  In an other-
 wise unidentified article broadcast by Moscow to various
 communist countries, including Romania, Komocsin looked
 ahead to the forthcoming CPSU congress as an occasion for
 acknowledging Moscow's pre-eminent authority in the communist
 movement.  He invoked the 1969 conference in stressing the
 importance of a party's correct--duly dependent--relationship
 with Moscow.

 13 JANUARY 1971
 Recent Soviet comment has similarly sought to reinforce Moscow's
 claim to primacy and to demand cohesion against the Chinese.
 An 8 January PRAVDA article by I. Pomelov, a discourse on
 Soviet patriotism at a time of Jewish protest, referred to
 Maoism  as exemplifying the danger of nationalism in the
 communist movement.  The article aimed an indirect rebuke
 at the Romanians for selectively determining the extent of
 their cooperation with their Soviet bloc allies.*  In the past
 year Bucharest has enhanced its leverage by means of added
 political and economic support from Peking.
 On another front of the Sino-Soviet contest, an article in the
 Soviet weekly NEW TIMES (No. 1, 1971) took sharp issue with
 the Australian CP for assuming an independent stance in the
 communist movement and for demonstratively--as a show of
 independence--deviating from Soviet-style orthodoxy on such
 crucial issues as the Czechoslovak reform iovement.  The
 article expressed resentment over the Australians' failure
 to criticize Peking's "splitting and adventurist" course.
 Peking's continued development of a more flexible and less
 sectarian line will make it increasingly difficult for
 Moscow to sustain this portrayal of Chinese policy. That
 the Soviets are intent on maintaining their ideological
 pressure is reflected in the article's e^,.,rtion that the
 struggle for Marxist-Leninist purity "has special meaning"
 at the present time.
 HUNGARIAN    PRAVDA on 6 January reprinted substantial excerpts
 ARTICLE    of an article by F. Varnai published in the
 Hungarian party daily NEPSZABADSAG on 20 December.
 An indication of the concern underlying the article--and of
 Moscow's motivation in reprinting it in PRAVDA--is contained
 in Varnai's observation that an assessment of Peking's
 current foreign policy is essential because "some people"
 are inclined toward "far-reaching conclusions" on the basis
 of initial favorable developments.  In noting changes in

 and its establishment of diplomatic relations with Canada and
 Italy.  The account suggests, in line with an earlier article
 in NEW TIMES (No. 47, 1970), that the Nixon Administration,
 inhibited by domestic political constraints from acting on
 its desire to improve ties with Peking, is "for the time beirg"
 leaving the initiative to the NATO allies.
 According to the article, Peking's "basic course" ::?emains
 unchanged, since it bases relations with the Soviet bloc on
 the same principles as govern normalization of its relations
 with the capitalist states.  The article welcomeF measures to
 improve relations with the PRC, although limited by Peking to
 state and trade ties; but it stresses that readiness to
 develop relations on the basis of anti-imperialist unity in no
 way signifies baste ideological concessions.
 The PRAVDA account is notable for what it omits from the article
 as well as for the above points inclLdec; in the excerpts.  Thus,
 PRAVDA deletes the article's statement that although Peking
 refuses to consider interparty relations "as yet"  (it was
 announced at the Hungarian congress that the CCP had rejected
 an invitation to attend), "we nevertheless regard it as a
 promising sign and a good beginning that after the past
 decade we can look forward to the prospects of drawing closer,
 rather than farther, from each other."  This was also the line
 taken by Komocsin at the congress, but at that time PRAVDA
 duly reported the Hungarian assessment. The change in PRAVDA's
 treatment may reflect a darker atmosphere following the recent
 troubles in Sino-Soviet relations.
 PRAVDA's editing exhibits Soviet sensitivity over comment
 regarding factions within the Chinese leadership.  The
 account omits a paragraph in the Hungarian article that
 refers to the emergence into prominence in P'king of
 "some people" who, while also guided by "nationalist
 and great-power interests," are beginning to assess matters
 "more realistically" and to "redress the mistakes" previously
 made.  PRAVDA also omits a passage which contains a
 provocative reference to "the Mao Tse-tung group."  Still
 another deleted passage mentions "armed provocations" by
 the Chinese on the border in 1969--a sensitive subject
 which Soviet media carefully avoid.

 TASS ON NPC     In another sign of heightened Soviet attention
 to China, TASS on 11 January reported on
 preparations for an overdue session of the Chinese National
 People's Congress (NPC). The report was printed in PRAVDA
 on the 12th.  Although couched in nonpolemical terms, the
 report noted that the four-year term of the NPC delegates
 had expired in 1968 and that the NPC chairman, "Marshal
 Chu Te," and the PRC chief of state, Liu Shao-chi, had fallen
 victim to the cultural revolution.
 The reference to Chu Te's military title has provocative
 overtones in that military ranks were abolished by the
 Chinese in 1965--a move with anti-Soviet implications
 that struck a blow at elements in Peking, notably then Chief
 of Staff Lo Jui-ching, who favored an accommodation with
 Moscow for security reasons--and in light of the sympathy
 shown for Chu in Soviet comment on the cultural revolution
 purges.  Whether or not Moscow's reference to the old marshal
 represents a signal of interest in the Chinese :military as a
 group favoring a reduction in Sino-Soviet tension, it has
 been the military--particularly the current chief of staff,
 Huang Yung-sheng--who would seem to fit the NEPSZABADSAG
 article's description of newly prominent elements in Peking
 who view matters more realistically.
 Comment broadcast in Radio Moscow's Mandarin-language program
 for the PLA has persistently lectured on the perversion of
 the PLA's role in Maoist campaigns, the threat posed to a
 vulnerable China by the United States, and the benefits in
 modern weaponry available to socialist countries on good
 terms with the Soviet Union. A recent broadcast in this
 grogram, on the 12th, deplored Mao's recurrent purges of
 the PLA--Lo Jui-ching, Peng Te-huai, and Ho Lung were
 named as victimized heroes--and said discontent is-rife
 over the PLA's role as a gendarmerie, its poor equipment,
 and its separation from the armed forces of the Soviet
 Union and other communist states.

 JEWISH QUESTION
 SOVIETS EVINCE CONCERN OVER CENSURE OF TREATMENT OF JEWS
 Concern over the possible impact at home and in the inter-
 national communist movement of foreign censure of the
 treatment of Jews in the Soviet Union is reflected in a
 lengthy theoretical article by I. Pomelov in the 8 January
 PRAVDA which invokes Marxism-Leninism to rationalize the
 present "class" approach to the Jewish question.*  The
 article is in large part devoted to indoctrinating Soviet
 citizens in the proper attitude toward Soviet "patriotism,"
 a concept that encompasses love of country and communism
 and eschews "local nationalistic tendencies."  But Pomelov's
 emphasis on the organic relationship of patriotism to inter-
 nationalism and his condemnation of "revisionist" as well as
 imperialist propaganda on the question suggests that the
 article is also aimed at communist critics who have aired
 independent views on the Jewish question and whose "nationalist"
 approach to the subject could impair international communist
 unity.  Radio Moscow broadcast the article widely in its
 foreign-language services, including its services in Romanian,
 Slovene, and Italian.  The article comes against the background
 of criticism of the Leningrad trials by the Italian Communist
 Party and a blast against Soviet anti-Semitism in the Yugoslav
 press, as well as a 5 January CBS telecast on the freedom
 Romania accords its Jews to practice their faith or emigrate to
 Israel.
 The Pomelov article, entitled "Soviet Socialist Patriotism,"
 perceives an intensifying campaign by "imperialist" propagandists
 and their "revisionist accomplices" to provoke discord among
 0
 *  I. Pomelov has been a previous contributor to PRAVDA's
 "Questions of Theory" column.  In a 20 February 1967 article,
 a disquisition on the leading role of the party in socialist
 countries, Pomelov followed a polemical approach similar to
 his current one:  The 1967 article combined an indirect rebuke
 aimed at one country--in that case Yugoslavia--with a direct
 attack on Mao's China as the prime example of deviation from
 the orthodox policy line.

 "certain" Soviet nationalities and to "undermine Soviet
 patriotism" in general.      In particular, Pomelov rejects
 "imperialist arguments" that the Jews' motherland is Israel
 and that there are "indissoluble ties" among Jews everywhere.
 Pomelov argues from a class position that "the interests of
 working Jews, no matter what country they may be citizens of,
 are opposed to the interests of the Jewish capital magnates,
 bankers, and entrepreneurs, no matter where they may live."
 Soviet patriotism, Pomelov continues, eschews "narrow-minded"
 concepts "divorced from social systems and ideology"; trum
 patriotism means "not only loyalty to one's native land a'id
 definite historical values but also loyalty to the most
 progressive socialist social system and to Marxist-Leninist
 ideology."
 In effect holding up the Soviet view of patriotism and inter-
 nationalism as the only acceptable one for the international
 movement, Pomelov further argues:  "In the Marxist-Leninist
 concept, which expresses precisely the coincidence of vital
 national interests and the common interests of the working
 people of all countries, patriotism and internationalism are
 inalienable aspects of the single ideopolitical position of
 the working class; and any belittling and, all the more so,
 any discarding of one of the aforementioned aspects signifies
 an undermining of this position, a slipping back to the
 platform of nationalism, national egoism or national nihilism,
 and wounding of national interests and feelings."
 Pomelov censures only China by name, referring to "Maoism" in
 passing as an embodiment of the evils of nationalism, but his
 discourse has evident implications for the Italia" communists,
 the Yugoslavs, and particularly the Romanians.  Recalling that
 the parties which attended the 1969 international communist
 conference in Moscow had concluded that "the defense of socialism
 is an internationalist duty of communists," Pomelov goes on to
 assail those 'who emphasize national pecularities and "disregard
 the regularities of socialist development."  In a passage that
 seems directed especially at the Romanians, he lectures:  "The
 Leninist principle-of the unity of patriotism and internationalism
 is incompatible with the slightest weakening of links between any
 fraternal country and its natural and reliable allies--the
 socialist states and Marxist-Leninist partieP."  It is also
 incompatible, he says, "with a limitation of the sphere of
 cooperation merely to questions which are allegedly 'beneficial'
 at the given moment or to any attempt to use the contradictions
 between socialism and capitalism for national egoistic aims . . . .

 In a passage that could apply to the Italian communists, who
 have disclaimed any anti-Soviet sentiments but have been
 critical of the Leningrad trials, Pomelov warns the Soviet
 "patriot" to distinguish "true from false and friendly foreign
 propaganda from hostile, no matter how well the latter is
 concealed by illusory 'objectivity' or assurances of 'good'
 feelings toward our people."
 ITALIAN PARTY, YUGOSLAV PAPER CRITICIZE LENINGRAD TRIALS
 Apparently anxious to get its critical view of the Leningrad
 trials on the public record for domestic political purposes,
 the Italian Communist Party (PCI) issued a communique on
 6 January, published in L'UNITA, recalling that following
 the Leningrad verdict the PCI had called on "interested
 parties" to commute the death sentences and had also raised
 issues of "a more general nature."  The party said it was
 issuing the communique in response to a letter from 93 Soviet
 Jews, published in the Western press, which among other things
 accused the PCI of indifference to the fate of Soviet Jews.
 While disclaiming knowledge about the authors of the letter,
 and hence by implication begging the question of its
 authenticity, the communique said the party had taken these
 allegations into account and had used the appearance of the
 letter as an occasion to define its attitude on the question
 of Jews in the USSR and in "certain other socialist countries."
 It did not elaborate.
 The PCI's public stand on the Leningrad trials was set forth
 in a 27 December article in L'UNITA.  While defensively
 disclaiming any intention of taking part in an "anti-Soviet
 campaign," the PCI organ objected to violations of the legal
 rights of the accused, termed the death sentences imposed on
 the two hijackers "incomprehensible," and "demanded" that
 they be commuted.
 Although the Yugoslav party has remained silent on the
 Leningrad trials, an article in the Ljubljana (Slovenia)
 DELO on 30 December took the Soviet Union to task for
 practicing anti-Semitism from the time of the "Tsarist
 pogroms" to the prosecution of the Leningrad hijackers.  It
 observed that in his day Stalin "took care to insure that
 Yiddish culture and schools would languish" and that "one

 year before his death he had two prominent Yiddish writers
 executed by firing squads."    It went on to charge that
 although the present Soviet leadership does not officially
 encourage anti-Semitism, "a furious a~tti-Israeli campaign
 serves as a cover for it" and "unofficial outbursts of
 anti-Semitism are not curbed in any way."  The Leningrad
 trials, it said, are designed as "exemplary punishment"
 and as "a warning" to Jews who wish to emigrate.
 ROMANIAN PRESS REPORTS LENINGRAD VERDICT WITHOUT COMMENT
 The Romanian regime, which has long insisted on a strict--
 essentially self-serving--policy of noninterference in other
 countries' internal affairs, has abstained from comment on
 the question of Soviet Jews.  The Romanian press confined
 itself to brief factual reports of the death sentences passed
 on two of the hijackers in Leningrad and on the subsequent
 commutation of the sentences. But Bucharest may have aroused
 Moscow's ire by allowing a CBS news team to film a special
 report on Jews in Romania, telecast in the United States on
 5 January.  In sharp contrast to the situation of Soviet
 Jews, the Romanian Jews were depicted as practicing their
 religion, learning Yiddish, and freely emigrating to Israel.
 The CBS commentator made the point that the news team was
 permitted to travel anywhere it wished in Romania, unescorted,
 and emphasized Romanian pursuit of an independent line with
 respect to the Jews both domestically and internationally.

 U.S. -SOVIET  RELATIONS
 MOSCOW CHARGES U.S. "CONNIVANCE" IN HARASSMENT BY ZIONISTS
 The 8 January bombing at the Soviet embassy annex in Washington
 prompts a "resolute" statement of protest from the embassy
 which is summarized by TASS that day.  Three days before the
 bombing a Soviet embassy statement to the State Department
 had warned that the USSR Government could no longer assure
 the preservation of normal conditions for U.S. institutions
 in the Soviet Union in view of the continuing hostile anti-
 Soviet campaign being carried on in the United States by the
 Zionists with the "virtual connivance" of U.S. authorities.
 A TASS commentary on the 8th cited U.S. press charges of
 alleged threats to U.S. diplomats in Moscow.  But Soviet media
 have not acknowledged the harassment in Moscow of U.S.
 diplomats and newsmen or the U.S. embassy protest on the
 11th over the harassment.
 Soviet propaganda has given no undue attention to the latest
 incidents in the United States.  But TASS on the 12th
 reported receiving letters and telegrams expressing "indigna-
 tion at the hooligan actions of Zionists," a step which may
 be a prelude to protest meetings in the Soviet Union."
 The Soviet embassy protest on the 8th and supporting comment
 blames the "notorious 'Jewish Defense League" (JDL)--"a mob
 of fascist thugs, little different from Hitlerite storm
 troopers"--for the bombing as well as the other threats and
 intimidations of Soviet personnel in both Washington and New
 York.  JDL leader Kahane's trip to Israel provided the peg
 for the charge by commentator Ryzhikov on the 12th in the
 domestic service that "the whole activity of American
 Zionists is directed from Tel Aviv" through the Israeli
 embassy in Washington.  Citing Kahane's statement that
 the JDL's purpose is "to provoke a crisis in Soviet-
 American relations," Ryzhikov asserted that Israel sought
 to sabotage the possibility of U.S.-Soviet cooperation
 regarding a Middle East settlement.
 *  Soviet reports of meetings in the USSR demanding the return
 by Turkey of two hijackers of a Soviet plane on 15 October had
 been preceded by central press reports of receiving a flood of
 letters and telegrams.

 Ryzhikov attributed the "obvious indulgent attitude" of U.S.
 authorities to the fact that the incidents distract the
 American public's attention from Indochina, inflation, and
 the threat of economic crisis.  The commentator pointed out
 that the Zionist campaign had "already been instrumental in
 he recent curtailment of the planned U.S.-Soviet cultural
 exchange program"* and warned that the Zionists, encouraged
 by their ability to "act with impunity," had decided "to
 assail the vhole spectrum of relations between the two
 states."  A 10 January "mailbag" program, bruadcast in
 English to North America, noted that although the Soviet
 Union favored a wide exchange in both cultural and scientific
 fields "a lot depends on the international climate" anu,
 citing the recent harassment and bomb!.ng, observed that
 "you cannot expectucultural exchange to go on under
 conditions such as these."                  I
 TASS on 11 December 1970 reported a foreign ministry
 representation to the U.S. ambassador in Moscow informing
 him that inaction by U.S. authorities regarding provocations
 had rendered impossible the "implementation of the 1971 tours
 to the United States by the Moscow Bolshoy Theater's ballet
 and opera troupes."

 SOVIET ANTI-MISSILE DEFENSE
 FIRST DIRECT PROPAGANDA MENTION OF SOVIET ABM'S SINCE FEBRUARY
 An article in the journal. USA:  ECONOMICS, POLITICS, AND IDEOLOGY
 (Fn. 12 for 1970) by retired Soviet Air Force Maj. Gen. B. L.
 Teplinskiy contains the first direct--albeit passing--reference
 in Moscow propuganda to a Soviet ABM capability since last
 February on the occasion of Soviet armed forces day.  The article,
 signed to the press on 9 December, reviews U.S. military strategy
 and weaponry, including development of the Safeguard ABM system
 and multiple independently targeted reentry vjhicles (MIRV's).
 With regard to the latter, Teplinskiy asserts that Secretary
 Laird and the "entire reactionary American press" has sought
 to justify the expenditures on these weapons on the grounds
 that the USSR "is allegedly 'creating forces for a preemptive
 strike' arid that the MIRV program is supposedly the answer to
 the development of the Soviet ABM system."  Teplinskiy does
 not go on, however, to comment on the references by Laird
 and others to Soviet development of an ABM system.
 Articles last February by Defense Minister Grechko, Chief of
 the General Staff Zakharov, and Kazakh SSR Military Commissar
 General Beykenov had broken a two-year pattern of reticence
 on the part r  Soviet spokesmen to claim a capability to
 destroy incoming enemy missiles.  The Zakharov article, in
 IZVESTIYA on 22 February 1970, was notable for reintrodu:tion
 of the April 1966 Malinovskiy formulation that the USSR's
 air defense forces have the means to insure the destruction
 of "any aircraft and many rockets" of the enemy.

 BERLIN
 GDR PROTESTS FEDERAL REPUBLICS ACTIONS IN WEST BERLIN
 A GDR Foreign Ministry spokesman on 5 January "resolutely condemned"
 the "official" Presence of Federal Ministers Jahn and Genscher in
 West Berlin and a meeting of the Bundestag's penal commission
 there as representing "new illegal claims" by the FRG against West
 Berlin which violate the city's status and the "legitimate
 interests of the GDR and other states."  Demanding an end to
 these recent "illegal state activities" by Bonn in West Berlin,
 the spokesman said they are detrimental to the interests of the
 West Berliners, who are interested in normalizing relations
 "between their city and the GDR."
 Two days after ADN releesed this protest, Moscow's PRAVDA and
 RED STAR reported it without comment in a TASS dispatch citing
 ADN.  IZVESTIYA, however, published a brief comment by
 V. Kukushkin, who remarked that Bonn was beginning a new fear
 by again flaunting its "illegal claims" on West Berlin, "which
 has never belonged and never will belong to the FRG."  Going
 beyond the GDR protest, Kukushkin added that "such visits are
 far from conducive to success" for the four-power talks on
 normalization of the situation in West Berlin.
 GDR RESPONSE TO     Answering West German government spokesman
 AHLERS' CHARGES     Ahlers' charges on 11 January that the GDR
 is responsible for the lack of progress in
 the four-power talks, East German radio commentators the next
 day accused Bonn of delaying any development in the efforts
 toward European detente by linking the issues of a European
 security conference, ratification of the Moscow and Warsaw
 treaties, the four-power talks on West Berlin, and specific
 GDR proposals--especially on GDR-FRG relations.  The only way
 for the Federal Republic to show its good will, one commentary
 concluded, is to abandon its "nonsensical and inadmissible
 demands and preconditions."

 POLAND
 PARTY LEADERS TRAVEL ABROAD AS DOMESTIC TENSION PERSISTS
 Six days after their one-day visit to Moscow, Polish First
 Secretary Gierek and Premier Jcuroszew'cz turned up in East
 Berlin on the 11th for another one-day "friendly" visit.
 Their trip to the GDR had been preceded by a 6-8 January
 visit there by Foreign Minister Jedrychowski; GDR Foreigr
 Minister Winzer had then flown to Moscow where he presumably
 reported on his talks with hiu Polish opposite number,
 described as "cordial and comradely" in the communique
 published in NEUES DEUTSCHLAND on the 9th.
 Also on the 9th, the Warsaw domestic service reported that
 during the period 4-8 January "representatives of the
 Secretariat of the PZPR Central Committee paid friendship
 visits to the Central Committees of the fraternal parties
 of the socialist countries."  The radio listed PZPR
 Secretary Tejchma as visiting the SED, Olszowski the
 Hungarian and Romanian parties, and Moezar the Bulgarian
 CP.  The Prague domestic service reported on 10 January
 that.PZPR Secretary Kociolek had paid such a visit to the
 Czechoslovak capital on the 5th.  Like the Warsaw radio,
 the Prague broadcast said the purpose of the series of
 visits was to "exchange information about current
 political problems and cooperation."
 GDR-POLISH     Held against the background of reports in
 COMMUNIQUE     Western as well as Polish media indicating
 continued tension in the northern seacost
 region, the talks on the 11th between Gierek and Jaroszewicz
 and their East German opposite numbers, Ulbricht and Stoph,
 produced a communique virtually identical in length and
 phraseology to the 5 January statement on the Polish leaders'
 talks in Moscow.  As broadcast by the East Berlin radio late
 on the 11th, the communique says the talks in the GDR took
 place in an atmosphere of "cordial friendship and mutual
 understanding" and "demonstrated complete identity of views
 on all questions discussed."  The two sides are pledged
 to strengthen cooperation bilaterally and within CEMA
 and the Warsaw Pant, to strengthei, the unity of the
 socialist. states and the world communist movement, and to
 support "ratification and entry into force" of the Soviet
 and Polish treaties with the FRG as well.as full diplomatic
 recognition of the GDR by all European states, including
 the FRG.

 Like the Moscow statement six days earlier, the communique
 registers no specific endorsement by the hosts of the new
 Polish leaders' reform measures taken to assuage the
 current crisis.  It says "the Polish comrades gave informa-
 tion about the present situation in the social develop-
 ment of People's Poland" and about the resolutions adopted
 by the 20 December PZPR plenum "in the interest of the
 working class and the entire Polish people, in the interest
 of the further socialist construction of People's Poland."
 While the talks in Moscow had also been attended by high-
 level Soviet economic figures, the East Berlin communique
 lists only high-level SED leaders--Ulbricht, Stoph,
 Honecker, and Axen, the SED Secretary in charge of
 international party affairs who was promoted to full Politburo
 membership in December.
 POLISH MEDIA REPORT EXPRESSIONS OF POPULAR DISSATISFACTION
 Polish media have yet to confirm or deny Western news reports
 of a new work stoppage in the Gdansk shipyard.*  The only
 indication in Polish media of any possible current work
 stoppage has been a brief report in the Szczecin domestic
 service on the 9th to the effect that "the management of
 the port of Gdynia"--in the Gdansk-Sopot-Gdynia tricity
 complex--"is recalling the entire reserve of port workers
 on all shifts beginning Sunday, 10 January at 2300 hours."
 There was a candid report, however, in the Gdansk, Szczecin,
 and Koszalin domestic service on the llth of a stormy
 meeting then in progress between the Gdansk voivodship
 party committee leadership and the aktiv of the Gdansk
 harbor party organization.  The announcer remarked at the
 outset that it was impossible to mention "in an orderly
 manner at this early hour" the "many essential problems"
 which had been raised at the meeting, but the broadcast
 included recordings of two frank protest statements:  A
 female voice said "we feel not only like managers of our

 appearance of PZPR First Secretary Gierek in Gdansk.

 enterprise, but also in part like co-managers of our country"
 and "as such, we want to know-what is happening in this
 country."  A male voice aimed critical remarks at an aspect
 of the international socialist division of labor under CEMA,
 declaring that "we have raised objections so often regarding
 our contract under which we are getting 'Rekord' loading
 machines from Bulgaria."  The speaker continued:  "Let us
 take a look at this equipment.  Is it suitable to work with
 it here, where we are transloading general cargo?  There
 are parts missing, and spare parts are unobtainable."  In
 late 1967, a Prague commentator had similarly ventured into
 this sacrosanct area, questioning the building of a certain
 plant in Czechoslovakia by the Poles when the Czechoslovaks
 were themselves building the same kind of plant in other
 countries.
 The interim radio report of the 11 January Gdansk meeting
 wound up with the observation that the shipyard workers
 "realize the difficulties of our country and are able to
 understand them, but they believe that one must speak
 frankly of them."
 Also on the 1lth, the Gdansk, Szczecin, and Koszalin domestic
 service carried a report of a meeting the previous day
 between the Szczecin voivodship party committee and "student
 groups," recounting tough stands by the students regarding
 the party leadership and the official news media.  The
 report said the students "stressed that those responsible
 for creating a situation in which the working class had to
 protest were not only those who have left the party leader-
 ship; the guilty ones should be sought at all levels of
 the party apparatus and of administrative and economic
 management."  It added that "many sharp words were addressed
 to the press, radio, and television," whose "silence or
 omission are creating information gaps which are then
 filled by foreign propaganda."
 Presumably as a direct result of this confrontation, PAP
 late on the llth reported the "resignation" of Szczecin
 voivodship party organization first secretary Walaszek
 "because of difficulties experienced in directing the
 voivodship committee's work," as well as of secretary Huber
 of that committee, who had addressed the 10 January
 meeting with the student groups and borne the brunt of
 their "questions."

 An 11 January report by the radio of Bydgoszcz--some 90 miles
 south of Gdansk--reflected the incidence of unrest outside
 of the coastal area as well.  Recounting a meeting of Bydgoszcz
 city party aktivs with first secretary Majchrzak of the voivod-
 ship party committee, it cited ", critical attitude" toward
 phenomena "hampering" labor organization and industrial
 production--the bonus system, for example--and toward the status
 of housing construction.  Questions from the floor, it added,
 "mainly emphasized the need to restore links be+ween the party
 and the workers' class."
 MEETINGS OF     The PZPR has continued its series of gestures
 SECRETARIAT     toward making the party decision-making
 process more accessible to the party rank-
 and-file and the populace:  A discussion on party work
 carried by the Warsaw domestic service on 10 January included
 the statement that henceforth meetings of the PZPR Secretariat
 would be held every Friday and that the population would be
 informed of the meeting results the following day.  In late
 December the Politburo had announced that "short reports"
 of its proceedings would be made public.
 Like the CPSU and most of the other East European ruling
 parties, the Polish party heretofore has regularly publicized
 only plenary sessions of the Central Committee.  Normally
 there have been no announcements of Secretariat or Politburo
 meetings.  The Czechoslovak party, however, has continued
 the pra:tice--begun in 1968--of fre ucntly publicizing the
 results of meetings of the latter two bodies.

 USSR  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 LINK SYSTEM OF FARMING AD'JAMCING RAPIDLY IN RSFSR
 The link system of farm labor organization continues to make
 headway on the local and regional levels of the USSR even in
 the absence of all-out support from Moscow.  The most
 significant breakthroughs, however, have occurred in the
 RSFSR where Politburo member Voronov--the only public
 supporter of the controversial innovation in the top leader-
 ship--presides.  In the RSFSR full-scale conversions to the
 link system, which in the past were limited to individual
 farms or individual rayons, are now scheduled to take place
 on the oblast level as well.
 According to a report in SOVIET RUSSIA on 7 January, the
 Orel obkom decided at a "recent" plenum to convert all
 farms in the oblabto to the link system in the next two
 tc three years.  As a preliminary, each farm in the oblast
 was ordered to form one or two "unregulated" mechanized
 links this year.  The Orel decisioa, which was called "bold"
 by the SOVIET RUSSIA correspondent, was said to be based on
 the results of several successful link experiments conducted
 there in recent years.  Reportedly, the obkom decided in
 favor of the link system as a means of raising farm labor
 productivity, overcoming a labor shortage, and redeploying
 the farm labor force.
 Similar though le--s spectacular breakthroughs have been
 reported in o.    parts of the RSFSR.  For example,
 Kalinin obkom fi:.-st secretary N. Korytkov reported that
 the number of mechanized links had increased fivefold in
 his oblast during the past three years, reaching a level
 of more than 3,000 (SOVIET RUSSIA, 21 November).  "The
 future," Korytkov declared, "is theirs."  This sentiment
 was apparently shared by P. Yelistratov, first secretary
 of the Mordovian obkom, who revealed that his obkom had
 recommended the link system to all farm party organizations
 in the oblast (RURAL LIFE, 27 October).

 Reports of conversions to the link system in other parts of
 the RBFSR and Belorussia have appeared in PRAVI)A (6 December,
 8 January), SOVIET RUSSIA (3 November), RURAL LIFE (1 January),
 KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (15, 30 December) and PARTY LIFE No. 21
 (20 October).  At the same time, articles publicizing the
 productive feats of mechanized. links have appeared in PRAVDA
 (17 October), IZVEBTIYA (11 October, 31 December), SOVIET
 RUSSIA (15, 23 October, 4 November), RURAL LIFE (9, 16 October,
 17 December) and RED STAR (11 October).  SOVIET RUSSIA hae'also
 continued to plug the reform editorially (2, 17 December).
 Despite the steady flow of favorable commentary on the link
 system in the central press, continued resistance to the
 innovation may be inferred from some of the complaints raised
 by link spokesmen.  (SOVIET RUSSIA, 29 October, RURAL LIFE,
 10 November, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, 8 December).  They center
 on the continued failure of the agricultural establishment to
 prepare guidelines for the implementation of the reform--
 guidelines originally scheduled to appear by the end of 1969.

 PRC  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 SHANGHAI SETS UP PARTY CCNr1ITTEE, FIFTH IN NATION
 Shanghai established its party committee at the conclusion of
 a congress held from I to 10 January, according to NCNA on
 13 January.  It is the fifth such new committee to be organized
 at the provincial level of administration in China since the
 first one was set up in Hunan on 4 December.
 The 1,000 delegates elected 59 members and 17 alternates to
 the Shanghai CCP Committee--somewhat larger than the
 precultural revolution committee of 41 members and 15
 alternates.  The top leadership group of seven secretaries--
 all chosen from among the leaders of the Shanghai revolutionary
 committee--is smaller than the former 13-man secretariat.
 Politburo members Chang Chun-chiao and Yao Wen-yuan, numbers
 one and two on the Shanghai revolutionary committee, were
 named first and second secretary respectively of the party
 committee.  (No second secretary has been specified in the
 case of the other provincial-level party committees; perhaps
 it was thought necessary to grant Yao the title because of
 his Politburo standing.)  Chou Chun-lin, commander of the
 Shanghai garrison, was named secretary, the only military
 man on the committee.  Mao Tien-shut and Hsu Ching-hsien,
 two former secretaries on the old Shanghai party committee,
 were also named as secretaries as were two worker representatives,
 Wang Hung-wen and Wang Hsiu-chen, both full members of the
 Central Committee.
 Although Shanghai set up the first party committee on the
 factory level in the nation on 21 June 1969, it seemed to
 lag behind other areas in rebuilding the party above the
 basic level.  Throughout the nearly two-year drive to rebuild
 the party, only three of the 10 counties  within the
 municipality have claimed rebuilt committees.
 PROGRESS      The rate at which party committees are now
 ELSEWHERE     being established suggests that most areas
 will set up party committees by the 50th
 anniversary of the party on 1 July.  There is, however,
 no indication that provinces with serious unresolved
 problems are being forced to set up committees on the

 basis of a central deadline.  All the provincial-level
 committees set up so far have been in the relatively
 advanced East and Central-South regions of China.  Two
 other eastern provinces, Anhwei and Chekiang, have
 established party committees in their capital cities,
 and provincial committees will probably follow in the
 near future.
 The Northeast region also seems a likely candidate for
 a provincial CCP committee in the not too distant future:
 Shenyang, capital of Liaoning, has a municipal committee,
 and Heilungkiang, a traditional cultural revolution pace-
 maker, has announced 15 county party committees.  Outside
 these areas the most likely prospects for a provincial
 committee would seem to be Tsinghai, which was among the
 leaders in forming a revolutionary committee in 1967 and
 recently announced party committees in two of its six
 autonomous districts, and Kansu, which on 26 December
 proclaimed that  in many counties and municipalities"
 new party committees have been formed.
