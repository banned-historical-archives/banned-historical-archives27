FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
CHINA: Peking radio's 
casual acknowledgement 
on Thursday that Hua 
Kuo-feng had been ele-
vated to chairman of 
the party Central Com-
mittee and of the Mili-
tary Affairs Commission 
and that the leftist 
quartet on the Polit-
buro had been "struck 
down" still falls short 
of a formal announce-
ment of Hua's confirma-
tion by the Central 
Committee. 
The broadcast moved closer to a full 
account of the charges against the 
leftists, but a detailed descrip-
tion of the machinations of the 
four has yet to be made official. 
Nor has a new Politburo, to re-
place that elected at the last 
party congress three years ago and 
now depleted by death and purges, 
been revealed. The elevation of 
Li Hsien-nien to the post of pre-
mier--generally assumed in Peking 
to be imminent--also has not been 
announced, but Hua is now being 
identified as chairman rather than 
premier. 
Many of these formal announcements 
may be made this morning during a 
television broadcast from Peking, 
which is to be transmitted abroad. 
In any event, the new Chinese lead-
ership appears anxious to under-
line the legality of its actions--
in contrast to the moves earlier 
this year against Teng Hsiao-ping, 
which many Chinese considered "il-
legal." 
Formal endorsement of the new 
shape of political affairs requires 
action by the Central Committee 
and other national bodies. A Cen-
tral Committee plenum may still be 
in session; large numbers of offi-
cials who were flown to Peking 
shortly after the arrest of the 
leftist quartet still appear to be 
in the capital. 
No formal announcement today or 
during a broadcast scheduled for 
transmission abroad next Monday 
would suggest that problems had 
arisen in sorting out a new lead-
ership and formalizing a new set 
of programs. The events of the 
past two weeks, however, have 
clearly been welcomed widely 
throughout China and the current 
leadership appears to be acting 
with great confidence.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
Even without the final, 
formal announcements, 
Hua's enhanced position 
and the arrest of the 
leftists seem irrevo-
cable. 
Hua appears to have the firm back-
ing of the bulk of the military--
a fact underlined in the demonstra-
tions and in Chinese propaganda 
since the arrests. 
One informal and unofficial ac-
count of the events surrounding 
the arrests portrays Defense Min-
ister Yeh Chien-ying--a close as-
sociate of Chou En-lai and an out-
spoken critic of the fallen left-
ists--as the prime mover in the 
showdown and the man who convinced 
Hua to act. This report states 
that Hua decided to move after an 
attempt was made on his life on 
the morning of October 6 by an un-
named individual instigated by the 
leftist quartet. Hua is reported 
to have had the support of 8 of 
the 11 powerful military region 
commanders, suggesting that the 
others remained passive or sup-
ported the left. 
One probably was Li Te-sheng, com-
mander of the Shenyang Military  
Region (Manchuria).  
Nearly all accounts of the turbu-
lent month following Mao's death 
indicate that the leftist quartet 
was counting on some sort of mili-
tary support. Some of the indi-
viduals who supported "radical" 
Red Guard groups during the Cul-
tural Revolution have not been 
weeded out of active service. How 
to handle these men could be a del-
icate problem for the leadership, 
particularly those in the army. 
It is possible that the army high 
command is now grappling with this

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
There may be some con-
cern over how fast to 
move against individuals 
in Peking and the pro-
vinces who have long 
espoused leftist posi-
tions. 
Other possible problem 
areas are the exact 
composition of a recon-
stituted Politburo and 
the question of whether 
or not to close out the 
campaign against Teng 
Hsiao-ping quickly. 
LEBANON: Relative calm 
prevailed throughout 
Lebanon on the second 
day of the cease-fire 
yesterday. 
and other immediate problems--the 
appointment of a new chief of 
staff and a new head of the gen-
eral political department. 
Some 500 people reportedly were 
arrested in the provinces on the 
night of October 6-7, but a hand-
ful of left-leaning province chiefs 
and other prominent officials are 
apparently still at large. No ex-
tensive arrests seem to have been 
made in the propaganda apparatus, 
long a leftist stronghold. 
One Politburo member, Wang Tung-
hsing, initially rumored to have 
falled with the leftist quartet, 
appears not to be in political 
trouble. Wang had been suspected 
by many Chinese and foreign ob-
servers to have leftist sympathies, 
but he seems to have cast his lot 
with Hua. Security forces, in Pe-
king, which are under his control, 
were warmly lauded during a recent 
demonstration in the capital. 
Hua and some of those close to 
him, however, may prefer not to 
move too quickly in "reversing the 
verdict" on Teng, whose shoes Hua 
has in effect filled. 
The general quiet in Beirut, the 
Mount Lebanon area, and northern 
Lebanon was interrupted only by 
occasional firing. Action was 
somewhat heavier in the south near 
the Israeli border, where Chris-
tian forces aided by Israeli ar-
tillery have been moving on Pales-
tinian positions for the last sev-
eral days.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
At the summit in Cairo, 
Arab League Secretary 
General Riyad will in-
vite all Arab states to 
indicate whether and in 
what numbers they wish 
to contribute to the 
expanded force. 
The joint Palestinian-leftist com-
mand met Thursday night to discuss 
the resolutions approved by Riyadh 
and issued a statement declaring 
that it will not respect the cease-
fire where Israeli forces are in-
volved. 
The leftist command under Kamal 
Jumblatt reenforced the threat 
with a unilateral declaration last 
night of its intention to launch a 
"large scale armed struggle against 
the Israeli incursions" if the 
Arab summit conference in Cairo on 
Monday does not handle the issue. 
The Arab League security forces 
yesterday reestablished check-
points to supervise the cease-fire 
along the line dividing east and 
west Beirut. A security force 
spokesman discussed with Lebanese 
and Palestinian leaders arrange-
ments for !additional checkpoints 
and a buffer zone as interim meas-
ures before the arrival of the ex-
panded peacekeeping force. 
The final selection of additional 
contingents will be left to Leba-
nese President Sarkis, who is to 
have overall control of the eace-
kee in troo s 
Saudi Arabia is expected to aug-
ment its contingent and other 
troop contributions are antici-
pated from Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco, 
and possibly Kuwait.

IRAQ: The statement 
issued Thursday by the 
Iraqi regime denouncing 
the agreement reached 
at the mini-summit re-
flects the Iraqis' 
sharp annoyance with 
Arab sanctioning of 
Syria's military inter-
vention in Lebanon. 
* * * 
The Iraqis probably feel betrayed 
by Egypt which, until recently, 
has been collaborating with Iraq's 
effort to strengthen Palestinian 
and Lebanese leftist forces ar-
rayed against the Syrians. 
If Iraq attends the Arab summit 
conference in Cairo, its perform-
ance may give some hint as to 
whether it will try to obstruct 
implementation of the agreement. 
Despite their opposition to the 
pact, the Iraqis may begin to re-
duce their own involvement in Leb-
anon if they believe that Lebanese 
leftists and the Palestinians in-
tend to observe the truce. Forces 
controlled by Baghdad in Lebanon 
are not strong enough to provoke 
a renewal of full-scale fighting 
although they could spark inci-
dents. 
Iraq, having apparently parted 
ways with Egypt on policy toward 
Lebanon, may now be seeking a com-
mon approach with Libya. The Lib-
yans have announced they will not 
attend the Cairo summit and are 
probably urging Baghdad to boycott 
the conference, too. 
PLO Chairman Arafat, during his 
visit to Baghdad this week, prob-
ably pressed the Iraqis to attend 
the summit in spite of their mis-
givings. Arafat will probably 
urge the Iraqis to offer to send

President Eanes seems to be wor-
ried about the current situation 
on several counts: 
--He believes Prime Minister 
Soares is not doing enough to 
tackle Portugal's serious eco-
nomic problems. 
--He fears an attempt on his 
life by leftists, who would try 
to pin the blame on the right. 
--He may be concerned that right-
ists in the military are bidding 
effectively for greater influence. 
--He may also fear that recent 
protests by conscript officers 
over pay and promotions are 
weakening a military long 
plagued by internal feuding.

RHODESIA: Most of Rho-
desia's white popula-

idly behind Prime Min-
ister Smith's policy 
of seeking an accommo-
dation with the black 
nationalists. 
Eanes has not settled on a course 
of action, however.  
* 
* 
The Prime Minister reportedly is 
reassuring the whites that the 
civil service is the key to carry 
ing out any government's policies 
and it is likely to remain in the 
hands of whites well into the fu-
ture. Smith is saying that since 
the blacks are not known to have 
any programs for taking over the 
civil service, the blacks could 
assume the top ministry posts 
while the middle and lower level 
white civil servants remain. 
- 
Smith's optimism may be misplaced 
Once a black majority government 
takes power in Rhodesia, it is 
likely to move quickly to gain 
control over all aspects of the 
bureaucracy. There are more edu-
cated blacks in Rhodesia capable 
of assuming bureaucratic respon-
sibilities than has been the case 
with other former British colonies 
at independence.

USSR 
The Supreme Soviet is scheduled to con-
vene in Moscow next Wednesday to approve 
the new five-year plan and the plan and 
budget for 1977. There is a rash of ru-
mors of impending changes in the top 
leadership. These rumors are prompted 
by uncertainty about Premier Kosygin's 
health and the expectation that the Su-
preme Soviet session will be preceded by 
a meeting of the party's Central Commit-
tee--the forum for important personnel 
changes. 
For two years, the question of General Secretary 
Brezhnev's health dominated the rumor mill in Mos-
cow, but he now appears in better health than he 
has been in a long time. Since he returned from 
vacation in September he has been very active, and 
rumors, so common earlier, that his .retirement is 
imminent have ceased. Instead, attention has 
shifted to Kosygin. 
The Premier's convalescence from his illness or ac-
cident last summer was a long one, but he looked 
fit when he reappeared in public on October 18 to  
meet the visiting Mongolian party boss.  / 
The hallmark of this regime has been stability 
within the senior ranks of the leadership. Despite 
rivalries and differences, each appears to have 
seen his own security as dependent on the security 
of the others. What changes have been made have 
been in the direction of preserving the old guard 
and holding off the intrusion of younger men. 
Youth--in the relative sense--particularly when 
joined with ambition, has not been well rewarded.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
This was evident in the response to Kosygin's ill-
ness. In early September, Deputy Premier Nikolay 
Tikhonov, a 71-year-old crony of Brezhnev from his 
Dnepropetrovsk days, was elevated to first deputy 
premier. By that time, it had probably been deter-
mined that Kosygin's recuperation might be lengthy, 
and Tikhonov was presumably appointed to assist 
Kirill Mazurov, until then the only first deputy 
premier, in handling some of Kosygin's workload. 
Tikhonov's position entitles him to a seat on the 
Politburo, and he may receive it at the plenum next 
week. Another change expected at the plenum is the 
pro forma removal of Politburo member Ustinov from 
the party Secretariat. It is not customary for an 
official to hold both a full-time party job and a 
government post, and Ustinov has not been identi-
fied in his Secretariat post since he was named 
Minister of Defense in April. These may be the 
only personnel actions to come out of the plenum. 
If Kosygin Does Retire  
In the less likely event that Kosygin has decided 
to retire, it is not at all clear who would replace 
him. Tikhonov would seem to lack the credentials 
for the post. His appointment as first deputy pre-
mier may turn out to have been a spoiling operation 
to damage Mazurov's chances. 
As the only first deputy premier for several years, 
Mazurov had established the clearest claim of any-
one to succeed Kosygin. His difficulty is that of 
all the younger ambitious Soviet leaders--to culti-
vate a public image is to arouse the suspicions of 
the seniors, while to seek anonymity is to risk 
being forgotten. Mazurov has not written a major 
article or given an important speech aside from  
obligatory ones, in four years.  
One other possible candidate to succeed Kosygin is 
party secretary Kirilenko. Although his name has 
not been included in the rumors, his selection 
would fit the pattern of keeping the top post 
within the ranks of existing senior Politburo mem-
bers. It would place in the top government post 
a long-time associate whom Brezhnev knows better

than he knows Mazurov. It would also serve to re-
move Kirilenko from the line of succession to the 
post of general secretary, a development that Brezh-
nev may no longer be reluctant to see. Kirilenko 
might object, but it would be difficult for him to 
refuse such a responsible post. 
Kirilenko has been one of Brezhnev's closest asso-
ciates since the two served together in the Dnepro-
petrovsk region in the Ukraine. He has for a num-
ber of years acted as Brezhnev's unofficial deputy 
on the party Secretariat. He has filled in for 
the party boss in his absences, specifically dur-
ing Brezhnev's long illness during the winter of 
1974-75. Kirilenko has long been viewed in party 
circles as the most likely candidate to succeed 
Brezhnev should the latter step down in the not 
too distant future. 
Yet Kirilenko has never been publicly recognized 
as second-in-command in the party and continues to 
be ranked in protocol listings behind veteran ide-
ologist Suslov. The two have been engaged for many 
years in desultory rivalry, a situation that Brezh-
nev has seemed content to allow to continue. In 
the last year there have been signs that a little 
of the warmth may have gone out of Kirilenko's re-
lationship with Brezhnev. 
There is some evidence suggesting that contacts be-
tween Brezhnev and Kirilenko on matters of party 
business may have fallen off in the past year. 
Brezhnev seems to have increasingly insulated him-
self behind bureaucratic layers of personal aides 
and Central Committee staff members. He seems to 
be relying particularly on Konstantin Chernenko, 
who as head of the Central Committee's General De-
partment, serves as the top executive aide to the 
Politburo. 
The elevation of Chernenko to the party Secretariat 
at the 25th party congress last spring formalized 
his special standing and must have caused Kirilenko 
some concern. The close relationship between Brezh-
nev and Chernenko was publicly demonstrated two 
months later when Brezhnev in an unusual gesture

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
took over President Podgorny's function and person-
ally presented Chernenko with an award for services 
to the party. 
Kirilenko's curious speech last week at the cere-
mony honoring him on his 70th birthday may reflect 
some uneasiness about his chances at the succession. 
He seemed to go out of his way to prove his loyalty 
to Brezhnev by a lengthy eulogy of his accomplish-
ments. Yet Kirilenko combined this praise with a 
quite extraordinary recital of his own achievements. 
The Succession Issue  
Even if, as seems likely, Kosygin stays on as pre-
mier and the plenum brings no changes in the top 
leadership, Kosygin's illness must have raised 
again the need to take some steps toward the even-
tual rejuvenation of the top ranks of the leader-
ship. All the senior members of the Politburo ex-
cept Brezhnev are over 70, and Brezhnev will be 70 
this December. 
Brezhnev appears to be in good form now, but it is 
safe to assume that the pattern of wide fluctua-
tions in the state of his health will continue. 
Uncertainty about his health has contributed as 
much to the near paralysis of political life in 
Moscow as has the seniors' preference for the sta-
tus quo. Brezhnev has not for several years been 
sufficiently well long enough to provide consis-
tently dynamic leadership, nor has he been sick 
long enough to force the succession issue. 
Some New Factors  
This pattern may well continue, but there are new 
factors that could bring some movement on the po-
litical scene. Even if reports of a cooling be-
tween Brezhnev and Kirilenko have been exaggerated, 
Kirilenko's age becomes an increasing liability 
for him and there is a growing likelihood that 
Brezhnev will start to look elsewhere for an heir. 
If the leaders wish to attempt to control the suc-
cession process to any extent they will have to 
place their candidates in responsible positions 
where they can gain vital national experience and 
recognition.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
With the exception perhaps of Mazurov, there are 
no leaders in their 50s or 60s who are now in the 
right spot with the right qualifications to have a 
good claim to any of the top posts. A number of 
qualified leaders on the national scene who once 
seemed to be possible contenders for higher office 
are now seriously hampered in one way or another. 
--Andropov is an experienced and well-connected 
party official, but he would have to put some 
distance between himself and his present KGB 
post before he could be considered. 
--Kulakov is in an advantageous position, rank-
ing after Kirilenko in the party Secretariat, 
and he seems to be a favorite of Brezhnev, 
but he has for too long been too narrowly fo-
cused on agriculture. He was released from 
the position of head of the Central Commit-
tee's Agriculture Department last May presum-
ably to allow him to take on wider responsi-
bilities, but there is no evidence that he 
has yet acquired any important new assignments. 
The two most favored contenders at the moment ap-
pear to be Ukrainian party boss Shcherbitsky and 
the head of the Leningrad regional party organiza-
tion, Romanov. All have strong support in Moscow, 
but they are all severely hampered by lack of ex-
perience at the national level. 
Shcherbitsky, another member of the Dnepropetrovsk 
group, is Brezhnev's closest protege. Unlike his 
predecessor as Ukrainian party boss, Shelest, 
Shcherbitsky has avoided making enemies in Moscow 
by assiduously putting the national interest above 
local concerns. After several years of being troub-
led by factionalism in the Ukrainian leadership, he 
now seems to have strengthened his local base of 
support sufficiently to feel free to accept a Mos-
cow post. 
Romanov's elevation to full membership on the Pol-
itburo at the 25th Party Congress tagged him as a 
comer, and his name has been mentioned frequently 
in the current round of rumors of leadership 
changes. He is evidently a favorite of Suslov, an 
important voice in any succession question. Sus-
by oversaw his appointment to the Leningrad post 
six years ago. Suslov's appearance with Romanov 
at a recent award ceremony in Leningrad again

called attention to their good relationship. Ro-
manov has also worked out a close and mutually ad-
vantageous relationship with Brezhnev; Kosygin, as 
a fellow Leningrader, presumably views his candi-
dacy favorably. 
If, as seems the case, these men are viewed in Mos-
cow as the most promising candidates eventually to 
succeed the seniors, it seems imperative that they 
soon be brought to Moscow to gain experience. It 
would make sense to bring them in as a group and to 
place them in responsible though not front-running 
jobs. The senior members of the Politburo would 
probably find it easier to agree among themselves 
if a package deal were involved. The candidates 
could continue to compete and would be protected 
from the dangers that await an anointed heir appar-
ent. 
There are at least two leadership positions that 
could be filled--party secretary for the defense 
industry (vacated by Ustinov) and head of the trade 
unions organization (vacant for 18 months). 
Next week's meetings will offer yet another oppor-
tunity for the seniors to begin to lay plans for 
an orderly succession. They have passed up numer-
ous opportunities to do this, but while to do noth-
ing may politically be the easiest course, it is 
not entirely neutral. It works to the benefit of 
those already well-placed on the national scene, 
such as Kirilenko, Mazurov, and Kulakov.
