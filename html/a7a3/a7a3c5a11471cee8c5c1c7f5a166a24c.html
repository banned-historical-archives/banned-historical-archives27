 heady cry goes out nightly from a radio

 the "Voice of El Fatah," speaking for
 the Arab commando organization whose
 bands of raiders cross each  night into
 hated Israel, bent on bringing death, de-
 struction and terror. To Arabs huddled

 ring, the Israelis so fair refuse to give
 up any of the occupied territories with-
 out  guarantees  of  progress  toward  a
 full Middle East scttlcmcnt. The Arabs
 in turn so far refuse to talk about a sct-
 tlcmcnt until the Israelis return the Arab
 lands.
 At times last week it seemed that the
 area's fourth war in two decades was al-
 ready in progress. Israeli and Jordanian
 artillery opened  up on two successive
 days. Far the firti~ time, Israelis also hit
 at the 15,000 Iraqi troops stationed in
 Jordan, who recently started firing their
 long-range, 122-mm. Russian heavy guns
 into  Israel.  Israeli  jets  dashed  across
 the cease-fire lints three times to bomb
 the area around the Jord^nian town of
 Irbid and hammer at the artillery po-
 sitions of the 421st Iraqi battalion. Dccp
 inside Jordan, Israeli commandos hlew
 up  two  vital  hridgcs  connecting  Am-
 man and the port of Aqaba (see Harp}.
 In the past, the United Nations has
 merely  cp ore  vro ahons o   e  race
 and urg~eid alla~pa~ryti~.es to get on with ~n,,er,~-
 ,i c T~.~~c~rc4~Fitie~t~~~4r4~20
 concern that the fighting might get out
 of hand. Russia publicly urged a polit-
 ical scttlcmcnt, declaring far the first
 time that it would not "permit" a re-
 sumption of war-whatever that meant.
 Washington registered its anxiety by call-
 ing in  the Israeli and Jordanian am-
 bassadors.  They  were warned  against
 the dangers of continuing to violate the
 tattered cease-fire agreement that ended
 the Six-Day War.
 It is in  this  tense  milieu  that the
 Arabs' "men of sacrifice" operate, in a
 defiant effort to exploit its instabilities
 io their own ends. The fcdaycen, who
 owe no fealty to any government, are rc-
 sponsible only to themselves, and vices
 any scttlcmcnt as a betrayal and a di-
 saster. They possess the power to sting Is-
 rael  into  repeated  reprrsals,  and  per-
 haps to whip Arab popular opinion to
 such a pitch that not even Nasser with
 all his prestige might dart a scttlcmcnt
 with Israel: In Jordan, their primary stag-
 ing area, they constitute virtually a statc-
 within-a-state and could probably topple
 King Hussein and take over his splin-
 tercd kingdom if they chose. And their
 power and inttuencc arc increasing all
 the time.
 The Palestinian Diaspora
 The   primary  sources  of  fcdaycen
 strength  are  the  Palestinian  rcfugccs,
 now 1,500,000 strong, who for 20 years
 have been a scattered and forlorn pco-
 plc,  possessing  neither  a  country  nar
 any say in the harsh events profoundly
 atTccting  them.  Dispossessed  of  their
 homes, lands and sense of nationhood
 when Jsrael was founded in 1948, they
 dispersed throughout the >ttiddlc East,
 They endured the scorn of  their host
 populations toward outsiders, although
 the most skilled and educated came to
 dominate  many  areas  of  Arab  intel-
 lectual and commercial life. Those that
 did  not  assimilate  settled  in crowded
 camps, mostly in Jordan and the Gaza
 Strip, where they lived a miserable, sub-
 sistcnce life, fed by the United Nations
 Relief and Works Agency.
 For 20 years they have been pawns
 in Arab politics, naurishcd on promises
 of  a  return  to  Palestine  and  a  pas-
 sionate hatred of Israel. Today the camps
 house 540,000, including 350,000 new
 rcfugccs who fled the occupied territories
 after the June War. The camps seethe
 with frustration and anger, and provide
 a rieh? source of Fecruits for fcdaycen.
 Says  the  mother  of  one  dead  com-
 mando: "I am proud that he did  not
 die  in  this  camp.  The  foreign  press
 comes here and takes our pictures stand-
 ing in food queues, and they publish
 them and say `Look at this nation of beg-
 gars.' This is no life. I  am  proud to

 of wealthy civilians in Damascus. Nor
 dots anyone really know very much
 ? about Yasscr Arafat, though everyone
 in the Arab world knows who he is. As
 E(Fatah grew and felt the need (or a visi-
 ble spokesman,  he became  its  ambas-
 sador extraordinary to the Arab world,
 its chief fund raiser and its field com-
 mander in Jordan. Arafat (his code name
 is Abu Amm:tr) sits at a wooden desk
 in his headquarters in Amman, dealing
 with a procession of couric~s like a gen-
 eral on a field of  battle,  which  in  a
 sense he is. When a guerrilla comes in
 to report a successful raid, Arafat's eyes,
 bulging almost to the panes of the dark
 glasses he wears day and night, dance
 with delight. He speaks softly and turns
 aside  all  questions  about  himself:
 "Please, no personality cult. I am only
 a soldier. Our leader is Palcstinc. Our.
 road is the road of death and sacrifice
 to win back our homeland. If we can-
 not do it, our children will, and if they
 cannot do it, their children will."
 Arifat's career in a way mirrors the
 history and thrust of the fcdayccn. E?orn
 in Icrusalem, he spent his tarty child-
 hood in a house within a stone's throw
 of the Wailing Wall, The area today is
 marked by the Israelis for bulldozing.
 Of that prospect, Arafat says bitterly:
 "We will sec  that our homes arc  re-
 built." Descended from Palestinian no-
 bility,  Arafat  learned  early  what  dis-
 possession meant. According to one story
 widely told in the l~fiddle East, his fam-
 ily has been disinherited of enormous
 wealth for 150 years through a legal tan-
 gle that deprived it of land ones owned
 in downtown Cairo. Arafat's father spent
 a lifetime trying to reclaim the land in
 the Egyptian courts but was overruled
 first by King Farouk and then Nasser.
 There are those who suspect that that
 may  be  one  factor in Arafat's occa-
 sional lack of enthusiasm  for Egypt's
 ruler.
 A teen-age gunrunner in the 1948
 war with Israel, Arafat afterward en-
 rolled at Fuad I (now Cairo} University,
 whcrc he majored in civil enginecring-
 and in Palestinian nationalism as presi-
 dent of the Palcstinc Student Federation.
 After graduating, he worked in Kuwait,
 editing an ultranationalist magazine on
 the side. In 1955, he appeared in Cairo
 attending officers' school, whcrc he spe-
 cialized in explosives. He graduated as
 a lieutenant just in time to share in an-
 other Arab defeat, at Sucz a year later.
 That debacle only confirmed Arafat's
 conviction that the Arabs could never dc-
 fcat the Israelis with conventional ar-
 mies. Throughout .the  1950x, he had
 organized "cells" among Palestinian stu-
 dents abroad and studied the techniques
 of Algerian guerrillas. At that time, Nas-
 ser had ? organized forerunners of  to-
 day's fcdayccn among Palestinians  in
 the Gaza Strip, and used them to stir
 up the bottler, a role they took on with
 sutlicicnt enthusiasm to help bring about
 istte!'s decision to launch the 19SG w?ar.
 After Sucz, EI F:ttah" was founded. as
 a strictly Palestinian force outside Nas-
 ser's reach.

 '
 pcrimental  era," recalls  Arafat,  when
 El Fatah staged only one raid a wcck,
 . testing  out  attack  techniques,  taking
 notes on Israeli defenses and rcactinn
 __
 times, and filing away the information
 to be used in future battle plans. "We
 were  also  experimenting  with  public
 opinion all through this period," Ara-
 fat's top aide told TtMt: Correspondent
 Edward Hughes last wcck. According
 to the' dictum of Mao Tse-tung, guer-
 rilla fighters must be able to live among
 a friendly population tike fish in water.
 But El Fatah at that time "had no au-
 dicncc. Without the people to listen to
 us, we had no sea to swim in-the fish
 had no oxygen."
 7ho Expansion of the Wor
 After last year's war, EI Fatah found
 itself not only swimming in popular sup-
 port but also possessed of a sudden be-
 quest of weapons left by the retreating
 Arab armies. The battlefields were lit-
 fcrcd with arms, and for two weeks, El
 Fatah teams took camels into the Sinai
 desert to collect machine guns, rifles, gre-
 nades and b;,zookas before the Israeli
 salvage squads. Four heavy trucks were
 found in Golan, along with two tons of
 ammunition and weapons. A Bedouin of-
 fercd to sell 150 Kalashnikov rifles for
 $140. EI Fatah gave him twice as much.
 Another Bedouin found a Syrian hel-
 icopter and built a tent to hide it for
 the EI Fatah men. But when they arrived,
 tlicy h:,d no helicopter pilot along, so the
 craft was clestroycd. A cache of eight
 tons of T'NT, too heavy to carry away,
 was buried in the Sinai: "We don't have
 to carry explosives into that area. It's
 there waiting for us," Araf:-t says.
 By August 1967, El Fatah was ready
 to try to launch an underground revolt
 among the Arabs on the now occupied
 West  Bank.  Hundreds  of  guerrillas
 trekked across the Jordan  River, only
 to be rounded 'up by Israeli. forces. To
 head off  any future attempts, the Is-
 raelis blew up the homes of any Pal-
 estinians who cooperated with Arafat's
 men. El Fatah's next phase was a cam-
 paign that sent smaller groups to hide
 in caves or live with sympathetic Ar-
 ahs,  and venture out at  night  to set
 mines or time bombs. Israel hit back at
 their riverside guerrilla camps, forcing
 El Fatah to move its bases farther in- '
 land. Despite these setbacks, the feda-
 yccn have bccn able to step up their
 operations to as many as two dozen a
 day. Though EI Fatah hotly rejects be-
 ing called terroristic, it has also turned
 increasingly to attacking lsracl's civilian
 population. The methods are brutal and
 indiscrinunate, random terrorism fot ter-
 rorism's sake without any military value

 FEDAYEEN GIRL PRACTICES RIFLERY
 Breaking the chains.
 -a bomb in a crowded cinema, a grc-
 nadc thrown in a schoolyard, a mint
 planted for anyone who comes along.
 Last wcck a 17-year-old Los Angcics
 girl, Sari Roberta, who had gone to Is-
 rael to serve  as  a volunteer worker,
 lost her right leg when she stepped on
 a mint.
 By laying down a strict policy of stay-
 ing out of Arab politics on the ground
 that, as Arafat says, "one enemy at a
 titnc is enough," EI Fatali has so far
 bccn able to operate independently in
 the host Arab countries-cl~ic(ly Jordan.
 Disputes with rival fedayecn organiza-
 tions arc another matter, and on one oc-
 casion  two groups  of  raiders  almost
 shot it out, each thinking the other was
 Israeli. Last month, the fcdayeen set up
 a council to coordinate raids between
 El Fatah and its two chief rivals, the Pal-
 estine Liberation Force and the Pop-
 ular Front for the Liberation of Pal-
 estine, or P.F.L.P. (incvitahly pronounced
 "flop" by Westerners on the scent), a mil-
 itantly leftist mcrgci? of several splinter
 organizations on the scene.

 universities that arc often staffed with
 zealous Palestinian professors, come a
 steady stream  of  several  hundred re-

 Fatah can handle. It accepts Palestinians

 pass rigorous medical tests and an ex-
 amination by a team of psychiatrists. A
 recruit  must also pass a final, brutal
 test of fortitude. He is handed a large
