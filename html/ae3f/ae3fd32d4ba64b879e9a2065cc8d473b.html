Ten years . ago on Independence Day, 
1966, President Johnson signed' the Free-
?dont of Information Act with a ringing 
...statement about the importance Of open-
ness in government. vs. 
3 The new statute went into effect a 
'.year later under Justice Departnient 
guidelines asserting that disclosure of 
,government documents was to be "the 
, general rule, not the exception.? 
"If government is to be truly of,by, 
and for the people, the 'people must 
, know in detail the activities of govern-
..rnent," Attorney General Ramsey Clark 
? said at the time. "Nothing so diminishes 
. democracy as secrecy." 
"-,- The trouble was that the law didn't? 
',work. It contained no deadlines for. com-
pliahce and no penalties for violatien. 
?With few exceptions, the federal bu-
reaucracy responded with stalling tactics, 
excessive fees for copying and docu-
ment searches and ether dodges. Some 
critics 'began calling it a "freedom from 
information" law. 
Congress tried again in 1974 with ? a 
string of amendments designed to close 
the biggest loopholes. The potential im-
epact of the changes on bureaucracy's 
customary ways was reflected in the -ade 
verse reaction from the White House. 
His promises of an "open" adminis-
? tration notwithstanding, President Ford 
vetoed the bilL He maintained that it 
would be unworkable and even "uncon, 
stitutional"?too much of e burden on 
government agencies and too much of 
ean encroachment on executive authority. ,

Act was passed again over his veto, S

To suggestions that the law is CoSten.

-the cassettes and the 'pamphlets the e 
? 'government puts out by the billions 
and which cost far more than the Free-
dom of Information Act." ' ; 
;?. House Government Information 
committee staffer Ted Jacobs predicted. 
,the costs will go' down once the back-
: log of requests is out of the way. He 
said of the claimed expenditures, many,:1 
',of which were attributed to the time et 
is Spent by high-priced officials in re- t 
t viewing requested documents: "I think,,.. 
f, frankly, that these agenciei have want- e 
ed to-show how expensive Freedom of 
:Information could be. But anyway,-,i 
there are so many worthless tasks be-
ing done by the government. Here's a 
^ worthwhile one." . 
i The top official in charge of the 
FOIA" at the Justice Department, Dep.- e' 
uty Attorney General Harold R. Tyler . 
; Jr, says he feels "there are valuable 
and important societal benefits cm-
' 
bodied in the Freedom of Informationl 
? . 
But, he adds, "I ant loath, to believe.-
, that the tremendous diversion of re-
sources . to . this area of operations, 
within 'the Department of Justice' 
alone, is a reasonable price for our: 
f society to pay for' the actual benefits:a 
being achieved or which can be ' 
? realistically anticipated in the , fore-, 
seeable- future." 
By contrast, the Defense Depart-
etnent,d which has. a much heavier 
freeclom-of-inforination workload, re-
ports no such ,misgivings. Officials ? 
there agree that the freedom-of-infore 
matron law imposes heavy demands,-
especially on high-level officials whose 
j expertise is needed to determine t, 
whether previously classified docu-
ments can be safely, released. But they 
think .it worth the effort. '. 
"We'i-e determined to make it work," 
, Pentagon freedom - of -information di-".. 
rector Charles W. Hinkle says of the. 
Last February, for instanae; former , 
, Defense Department- executive Morton ' 
s Halperin asked for copies of 'what 
-various -Secretaries of; Defense Pad ' 
said in, their classified annual state-. t 
ments about -Soviet and Chinese stra-
:tegic .forces. . 
It cost an estimated $16,688 in staff 
time for specialists who reviewed 
: what was still sensitive and what could 
tbe made public, according to a Penta-
gon spokesman. ? ? . 
?Because of past abuses, the new ... 
FOIA doet not permit the government 
fair trial. The old law had' exempted 
:---such files from disclosure. 
..A -so-called "national security" ex- ". 
emption for classified documents was 
also trimmed back in response to a' 
1973 Supreme Court decision holding 
?"?: that not, even" federal judges could 
-emestioneethes wisdom' of, the "top 
esecret," and "confidential"' 
e labels on :classified documents. In 1974 
Congresi passed freedom-of-informa-
tion 'amendments authorizing judicial 
review to determine whether such 
documents 'are, in fact, properly cies-
.L; sified. - ? 
, _ - ? 
Another key provision Of the 1974 ? 
1 -amendments called for disclosure of 
whatever documents and portions of-. 
documents that were- "reasonably se-
:gregable" from otherwise secret rec-
ords. Pages, paragraphs, even sentences 
must be made public, according to an 
updated set of Justice Department 
f- guidelines,--if they are "at all intern-
,- gible." ? 
Is The new rules produced a surge of 
demands throughout the government 
,and proved especially unsettling at 
1' places like the FBI and the CIA, agen-
cies that had been able in iarge,mea- ' 
P' 
4 sure to ignore the old law. - 
t,.. "We hit the peak in July of last,. 
4 year," says Gene Wilson, .the CIA's 
1, Freedom of Information Act and Pri-
vacy Act coordinator. ,The report of'' 
the' 
the Rockefeller Commission on the : 
CIA's domestic spying and harassment 
-.of American citizens had just come . 
t.Out: Congressional investigations were 
;: multiplying.. 4 I.:. , 
The-'backlog a requests waiting to , 
be answered at the CIA reached 2,400- . 
the new law's deadlines of 10 
working days for the government's de-
cision on whether to comply with, a ! 
request and 40 working days for final 
't.administrative action on any. appeals. , 
Wilson estimated that the CIA 'haS 
= the equivalent of 100 persons working 
full time on information requests, but 
_ 
'.he said it still takes one month to six 
weeks :to-respond to a, routine ? re-
qtresta ? 
At the CIA, he said, "often the 
right hand doesn't know what the left 
i ? 
, hand is doing. You can't go to a corn-
:* puter and just push a button. You 
have, to go off in four or -five direc-
tions." - 
; 
The CIA logged 6,609 Freedom-of-, 
, Information-Act requests last year and ( 
to charge for review time. Officials 'a , 
Can charge for the expenses of finding ? 
a and copying requested documents, but - 
these, too, can, be waived when dis-
. 'closure is deemed to be "in the public ? 
,einterest." 'Halperin got his bundle of 
cleared material, free. - ? ? : 
.The new law requires 'disclosure of 
' investigatory , files unless it , would , 
cause one or more of six speci has-
i 
amis. such as depriving someone of 
another '552 under the Privacy Acte 
which went into effect last September. 
',It gives 'citizens a right to see' and 
correct their own files (by and large; 
they .already had a right to see them 
under the FOIA).. The backlog has 
been cut down by now to -about 1,000 
cases, but Wilson said, "we'll never be 
current." He added that the ? agency ; 
has allocated what it thinks is a suf-
ficient* amount of money to the task 
and said it probably will not spend I 
more to do it faster. ? i 
Under the new FOIA guidelines pro-
mulgated in February, 19'75, Attorney 
General Edward H. Levi declared: 
"Needless to say, 'burden is no excuse 
for intentionally disregarding or slight- , 
ing the requirements of the la', and, 
where necessary, additional resoinces. 
should be sought or provided to 
achieve full compliance." 
The Justice Department, however, 
2 
- Approved For Release 2004-108/08: CIA-RDP77-00432R000100390004-1 
appears to be taking that advice With 
a grain of salt...Instead of more money 
and manpower, Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral Harold R. Tyler spoke?in the de-
partment's first annual report on the 
new law?in terms of changing it 
Tyler said "reformulation" of the, 
law was necessary to, -permit .a sub-
stantial portion of the personnel now 
working in this area to return to the 
, traditional substantive missions of the 
Department of Justice, while continu-
ing to meet the principal goals of the 
Freedom of Information Act." , 
Tyler did not 'spell out all th 
changes he thought were needed, but 
he made clear that .he felt an easing 
of the deadlines?at least for compli 
cated requests?was essential. 
The Justice Department received 
some zo,000 disclosure requests in 
1975 under' the Freedom of Informa 
tion and Privacy Acts, a number, Tyler 
said, "far in excess of what anyone 
anticipated." Of that total, 14,478 were 
addressed to the FBI. The pace, this 
year?has not subsided. 
. The bureau says it has nee' rly 200 
persons,. including 25 special agents, 
. working full time on public requests 
for its documents. "That's larger than 
56 of our field offices," says POIA 
t.Privacy Section Chief James' Powers; 
,Despite its large FOIA staff, the 
bureau is just now getting requests 
made last October and November. The', 
? Mammoth logjam is getting worse 
rattle than better. What was reported 
as a seven-month backlog in May is 
? now approaching a nine-month back-
log. 
Nine members of the Nouse with 
FBI oversight duties, led by .Rep_ 
Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.). have , 
asked the General Accounting Office. 
? Congress' investigatory arm, to probe 
"the FBI's difficulty in meeting its 
. statutory requirement for timely 
processing." Rep. Bella S. Abzug (D-
'N.Y.), chairman Of the, House Govern-
ment' Information Subcommittee, 
s asked the GAO to determine whether 
the FBI has engaged' in. "delaying 
tactics." 
Assistant FBI Director John J. Mc-
' Derm'ott Says, "We're not out to evade 
the lati, but we have to prioritize our 
work." He maintained at a recent court 
hearing that the best solution would 
be a bill sponsored by Rep. Andrew J. 
Maguire .(D-N.Y.) with drafting help 
from the Justice Department. It would 
permit slower reading at the FBI and 
any other agency devoted to "criminal 
investigation"?sat the rate of 60 days

dismissed the- notion that Congress 
meant to give priority to those who 
take their freedom-of-information cases -

' He said that Congress did intend to 
give priority to those who file lawsuits 
under the Freedom of Information Act

test of their motives or need, "... (1): 
debt is not paid when due, the creditor 
who goes to court will receive priority 
over a creditor who watts, for whatever 
reason,7,..Lercnthal observed. e ? ? . 
Justice Department 'lawyers were de-
lighted with the Wilkey opinion and 
vowed to apply it to all other applicable 
cases,. including Tom Hayden's. (Hay-
den's lawyers said he filed suit only 
after discovering that the FBI had quiet-. 
3 
ly abandoned work on his request last 
November after reviewing 900 pages of 
documents?out of 18,000.) 
, 
. "We will be letting the courts knoiv 
-,..[About the decision] 'as Soon as we can 
get it Xeroxed," Jeffrey' F. ..Axelrad, 
. chief 'attorney' in ,the Justice Depart-
. :nient's information and: privacy section, 
'said shortly after the ruling. 
. He said the lawyers in his section 
? would renew their opposition, to court-
-imposed deadlines in freedom-of-infor-
mation cases wherever those deadlines 
. do not 'give what the government con-'? 
-siders enough time to permit "orderly 
processing or requests." 
Freedom-of-information advocates- ac-
knowledged the circuit court ruling was 
a serious .setback. 
? "It's going to cause a lot of prob-
lems," said Mark Lynch, director of the 
Freedom of Information Clearinghouse, 
which was established in 1972 as a part ? 
of Ralph Nader's Center for the Study 
of Responsive- Law. Lynch said a major ? 
problem with the Open America ease 
was the lack of any' evidence about 
shortcomings of the FBI's methods. 
"They've got a system that's guaran-
teed not to work within the time lim-
its," Lynch contends. "They've got a 
never-ending succession of review . 
We've got to get a case_ where we can 
depose all those [FBI]. guys- and lay it? 
all out." 
Axelrad's section, which has nine law-
,yers. represents most government agen-
cies in freedom-of-information litigat ion.. 
He estimated that there arc aPProxi-
mately 45n suits pending filptig with an-. , 
other .50 'reverse FOIA" cases where 
outside interests arc suing the govern-
ment. to prevent the release of informs-, 
,tion. 
"Only 20 per cent 'of on; POI eases 
arc for the FBI, hut the bureau is still 
our largest single client," Axelrad says. 
"Next, I would guess, is the CIA." 
Proponents of the new freedom-of-. 
information law, which vent into effect 
in February, 1975, say the new dead- ? 
lines were one of the keys to shaking 
the government out of its long lethargy. 
? Another' key, they said, was the 
"sanctions provision" calling for dis-
ciplinarY proceedings by the Civil 
Service Commission whenever a judge

? provision and selling Sen.. Edward M.

. steered the-bill through' the Senate as

and Procedure Subcommittee. - 
"I don't know of any other provision

recalls of the sanctions measure. "Torn

; 'Well, it'd be nice, but it could sink tee

which the courts have recommended a-

tice Department lawyers are trying to 
? 'prevent it from teking place. ? 
-" 
The dispute involves a State De-
partment official, Norman Holly, who 
was 'returning from the Far East On 
Dec. 29, 1974, when he landed at Seat-
tle International Airport and was hus-
tled off to an interrogation room hy 
'Customs 'agents. 
e, According to Holly; he was forced to 
leave'his baggage behind him where.it 
could have been stolen, and then he 
was subjected to "degrading and 
abusive" interrogation about a minor 
.. discrepancy involving some articles he 
had bought overseas: He said one 
;Customs agent .confiscated 'his drivel's 
license and automobile registration. 
Holly demanded an investigation in 
a letter.to Custoins Commissioner Ver-
non Acme and then, in May of 1973; 
asked for the records of the inquiry: 
. Customs officials, denied him the 
documents, saying it was "not our poi-
- icy" to provide 'them. Holly kept press-
ing, capping the effort with an appeal 
7 to Acree last September stating, "1 
,believe that your office has behaved in 
an arbitrary and capricions manner." 
The Customs Service did not sup-
ply .the records he sought until last 
January, about a month after he filed 
suit in U.S. District Court. Then they 
. were turned aver to him "subject to 
certain deletions." Among the dele-
tions were the names of the Customs 
agents, which were withheld on the 
_grounds that "their disclosure would 
, endanger the life or. physical safety of 
: 
law enforcement personneL":. 
? Holly's suit was assigned to Judge 
Bryant, who found no justification for 
these or several other deletions. In a 
ruling March. 29, he also held that "the 
circumstances surrounding the with-
'holding of this information raise ques-
tions as- to whether agency personnel 
.acted .arbitrarily or .capricicesly with 
respect to the withholding of the , re-
juested informatien." 
Accordingly, he ordered the' U.S. 
marshal hue to serve a copy of his 
findings on the chairman 'of the Civil 
Service Commission "so that he might 
promptly -initiate 1 proceeding to de-
termine whether disciplinary action is ' 
warranted against those primarily re-
sponsible for the , illegal withhold-
ing . . .7

At the -sarne tirne clepertment offi- ? 
cials deny any antipathy toward the 
spirit of freedom of information and 
openness in government, but gadflies 
such as Nader maintain that their an-
tagonism toward the law is plain. 
The Justice Department, Nader 
charged recently in a speeeh to the 
Federal Bar Association, is "dedicated 
to undermining rather than imple-
menting" the act. He said the depart-
ment often pursued litigation in de- ? 
fense of secrecy "when in many cases 
? there really are no ground's for a legit-
imate defense.". 
"The charge is as 'Valid as the source," 
replies Quinlan Shea Jr., head of the 
Justice Department's Freedom of Infor-
mation ? Appeals Unit. "I consider it an 
invalid charge . . He [Nader] is just 
shooting off his mouth." 
Shea maintained that the Justice 'De-
partment, including the FBI, was doing 
its best to comply with the law in the 
midst of a sea of sensitive documents. 
"I'm not saying we're perfect." Shea ? 
said. "I'm not trying te be perfect. I'm

Third in a series 
By George Lardner Jr. 
Washington Post. S:aCn Writer 
. Food and Drug Commis-
sioner Alexander M. 
Schmidt is unhappy over 
'the way the freedom of in-
formation law has worked at 
his agency. ? 
"About 90. per. cent of the 
requests for disclosure of 
-documents, according to 
Schmidt, support what he 
calls "industrial espionage?

tion about their competitors 
?and not the public's right 
to know." 
L.) 
The charge that corporate 
America has commandeered 
the freedom of information 
law for its own purposes has 
become a comireen theme 
since the adoption of amend-
ments in 1974 promised 
quicker and fuller access to 
government files. 
"Open Files: Letthig 
Exxon In," intoned a head-
line in The Washington 
Monthly. "Why Many Bush 
ncss Secrets Arc Now In 
Danger," proclaimed one In 
e're "very few" withholdings for Out: 
sake of withholding in the Justice De= 
partment. ? 
. He acknowledged, however, that they
does sometimes make frivo-
lous, claims on behalf of secrecy and 
that the Justice Department does' 
sometimes carry them into court On: 
behalf of other agencies: with 'a - 
straight face. For instance, he :said 
in an interview, he would not try'. 
to justify the National Security 
Council's insistence that not a line. of-
its lone-secret directives _could safely be. 
released. 
Shea suggested that Justice Depart-
ment, support of wrong decisions is often:: 
inescapable. 
"Everybody in government ? is con-
stantly trying to get Congress to let his. 
agency represent itself," he said. "Jus-; 
tice opposes that . . . What's a poor 
Civil Division lawyer [at Justice] sup-
posed to do? He's not an expert on clas-
sification. Sure they [the NSC] were 
stonewalling. It's incredibly stupid.. 
Sometimes we defend legal positions we 
wouldn't take for the [Justice] Depart-
meat. But if you won't defend your 
client and you won't let your client de=' 
? fend himself, you've just got a lot of,--
angry clients." . _ 
? Only' once, it seems, has the Justied" 
Department used its clout on freedom-, 
of-information issues and refused to rep-
resent a federal agency that- persisted 
in withholding information. 
? According to a government -lawyer 
'familiar with the details, the refusal oc-
curred seve: al years ago when the Agri= 
culture Department refused to make: ? 
'public some statistics from tests on the: 
. fat content of hot dogs-Lon the grounds 
that the tests were investigative records. 
Justice Department lawyers told offi-
cials at Agriculture to make the infor-
mation public or take the risk of going 
to court without a lawyer. Agriculture 
ignored the warning and suit was filed. 
"Counsel was withheld," the government ? 
lawyer said, "and Agriculture had to 
. give in." 
Axelrad, however, apparently does not 
consider it his job to override the deci-
sions of other agencies. He told the Fed-. 
eral Bar Association that he and his 
section simply did not have the. person-
nel to make a complete review of the 
merits of every case that .cornes their:, 
way. 
"The agencies are responsible for ad-
ministering the act," he said. "We have-
no inonopoly on knowledge at the .Jus-.

"It's going to cause a lot of prob-

Freedom of Information Clearinghouse, 
which was established in 1972 as a part 
of Ralph Nader's Center for the Study 
of Responsive' Law. Lynch said a major 
problem with the Open America ease 
was the lack of any evidence about 
? shortcomings of the FBI's methods.

At the Federal trade Corn-
mission, attorney Jeffrey S. 
Edelstein said companies 
often file massive requests 
-that not only give them 
"double discovery" oppor-
tunities in FTC administra-
tive proceedings; but serve 
to "harass agency complaint 
counsel" who are suddenly 
saddled with the chore of re-
viewing 
i thousands of ex-
traneous documents. 
In one case, the FTC 
sued a complaint involving 
s the alleged sale of millions 
of dollars of worthless land. 
"The company asked for all 
(PTC) documents relating to 
I land sales," Edelstein said. - 
, "And the requester refused 
to narrow the request. It in-
volves' more than 400,000 
documents. The agency coun-
sel [assigned to the corn-
- plaint] had to* spend 75 per 
cent of their time [review-
ing the documents] because 
only they were in a knowl-
edgeable position to review ? 
them." 
More than two-thirds of all -1 
freedom - of -information re-
quests and more than 60 per - 
cent of the administrative ?

were made by corporations _ 
or law firms representing a

At the CIA, the agency 
actually charged less than 
$2,000' in search and copy-

but CIA freedom-of-informa-

Recently, they've started to

they've already dug up for 
congressional committees." 
Wilson insists that the 
CIA is improving 'even"; 
though outsiders might not 
notice. "They teach you here 
for 20 years how to keep in-
formation secret, how to 
keep it within the walls," 
he said, "and then along 
comes a law that says, 
-Turn around, review what 
can go out, make it public." 
He said the agency is start-
ing to do that, although per-
haps not too perceptibly. 
"If I were with the Amer--

up that body of specially tail-
ored law?when secrecy is 
in order?than to stake out 
new, broadly worded exemp-
tions (there are nine now, 
including one for "national 
security") in the law itself. 
For the present, the law 
is, as Susman puts it,' in "a 
shakedown period." 
Except for a House in-
quiry into the FBI's mam-
moth backlog, no congres-
sional hearings on how the 
law is working are contem-
plated until next year. By

According .to Quinlan complete: . 
Shea, head of the Justice 
Department's Freedom of 
Information Appeals Unit, 
even a little publicity about 
the law touches off a rush of 
requests for records. 
A persistent bureaucratic 
_claim has been that laws 
such. as the Freedom of In-
forraatipn Act would inhibit 
bold decisions, put a chill on 
the exchange of free and 
candid advice within the 
government, deter officials 
from speaking up for fear 
that what they say will be 
made public. 
Most of those conversant 
with the law, including 
Shea, say they have noticed 
no sudden- shyness among 
government officials. 
But archivist of the 
United States James B. 
Rhoads says he's still wor-
ried that historians of the 
future may wind up with 
Rhoads said he wasn't 
speaking of routine govern-
ment paperwork?of which 
there is always too much?
but rather of documents re-
fleeting important govern-
ment decisions and actions. 
"My concern is that it [the 
information law] might cre-
ate a less full, informative, 
rich record of what the gov-
ernment has done," Rhoads 
said. "Society as a whole is' 
the loser if that results." . 
The archivist acknowl= . 
? ? edged, however, that he was 
speaking primarily from 
"instinctive feeling," and , 
that it would be 15 to 20 
years before his suspicions 
? could be shown to be, right 
? or wrong. 
"Typically, ,records don't 
come to us until they're-
? about 20 years old," Rhoads 
said. Despite his concerns, 
he said he was 'still in favor 
? of the "basic philosophy un-
' denying the Freedom of In-
: formationAct. 
, "Many agencies have been . 
far too 'restrictive" in what 
? they make public, he said. "I 
think government can per-.

" greater degree."

is, I think, still substantially

For; some members of the

as a protective device?is 
also one of the unintended 
- drawbacks of the Freedom

A Soviet charge that American Central Intelli:

tempted io recruit him as a double-agent :is the . 
latest episode in the Washington-Moscow chill. 
The accusation surfaced this week in a dramatic 
cloak-and-dagger article in the Soviet publication,

The weekly, the official organ of the Soviet

The CIA in 1953 discussed purchase 
lof 10 kilograms of LSD ? enough for 
t 100 million doses -- worth $240,000 for 
fuse in  
n its drug experimentation pro-
gram on animal and human subjects, 
according to newly released agency 
?-documents. ?? 
The documents were Made avail-
- able to reporters yesterday by John 
D. Marks, director of the CIA project 
at the Center for National Security 
Studies, after he obtained them from 
the CIA under the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act._ _ 
The documents show that the pur--
? echase of the '10 kilos of LSD was 
recommended by CIA officials but do. 
not establish whether a purchase of 
:"that quantity was ever made. ? 
ONE REASON for the large CIA' 
purchase proposal was to preclude 
other countries from controlling the 
supply, the documents indicate.: 
'Some unspecified quantities of LSD 
were purchased from the drug's 
prime manufacturer, Sandoz Labora-
tories of Basel, Switzerland, ,the 
documents indicate.?
'The 59 documents display a 
sketchy pattern of widespread 
behavior modification experimenta-
tion on .humans through the use of 
drugs, radiation and other methods 
during the 1950s and 1960s by the 
CIA. 
? One question raised ? and- left 
unanswered by the documents ? is 
how many people received drugs 
without their knowledge during CIA 
experiments which have not been 
publicly detailed. 
The documents link drug experi-
ments recently disclosed by the 
Army to a CIA-controlled interagen-
cy project which also "informally" 
involved the FBI. the Department of 
Agriculture, the 13ureau of Narcotics, 
the Food and Drug Adminstration, 
state and local agencies, hospitals, 
universities and privately controlled 
foundations. 
DR. SIDNEY COHEN, professor of 
psychiatrity at UCLA and a leading 
expert on LSD experimentation, said 
yesterday that he knew of perhaps 
25,000 doses of the drug being admin-
,istered to humans since testing 
began by goverment and private 
agencies in the late 1940s. 
Cohen and another UCLA expert, , 
Dr. Thomas Ungerleider, said an 
average LSD dose was 100 micro-
grams or 10,000 doses per gram. - 
Both men said that with proper stor-
age laboratory-grade LSD similar to 
that purchased from a Swiss compa-
,ny by the CIA does not disintegrate 
-.easily. 
, Cohen, a former government drug 
program officer, said he was aware 
that LSD experiments had been con-
!ducted on inmates at the Vacaville, 
Calif., medical prison but that he was 
unaware, until told of the documents, 
that the CIA has been involved in 
testing. The documents also say that 
testing was done on human subjects 
at "such institutions as the U.S. Drug 
Treatment Center in Frankfort, Ky." 
The documents do not disclose 
what has happened to the CIA's vast 
store of LSD and other hallucinogens 
derived from mushrooms and other 
plants. 
The documents say no CIA drug 
experimentation has been conducted 
since 1967 without full knowledge of 
the experiment by persons being 
tested. 
AMONG THE 139 drugs tested by 
the CIA were sodium pentathol, 
sometimes called truth serum; co--
caine; marijuana; coffee; - alcohol; 
insulin; and antropine, a widely used 
anidote to some nerve gas weapons. 
While many names have been 
"sanitized" by the CIA from the 
documents, it is clear that the CIA 
project, first code-named "Blue-
bird," then "Artichoke," involved 
many citizens who were unaware of 
CIA participation or that they were 
being given drugs. 
During the last year, both the 
Army and the CIA have disclosed 
that persons died as a 'result of drug 
experiments in 1953. 
After unwittingly taking a dose of 
LSD disguised in a glass of Coin-
treau. Frank R, Olson, a biological 
warfare researcher, leaped 10 stories 
to his death from a New York hotel 
window. 
Harold Blauer, a tennis profession-
al, also died after receiving a 
mescaline-derivative as a result of 
an Army-sponsored experiment at 
tlic New York State _Psychiatric 
Institute.-
ME DOCUMENTS released yes-:: 
terday show that CIA Director Allen 
Dulles admonished CIA officials for ' 
their "poor judgment" in the Olson 
case and experimentation involving.: 
unsuspecting individuals. The CIA - 
recently paid the. Olson family $1.25 
million. ? 
arks said yesterday he filed his 
freedom-of-information request 
June 25, 1975, just-15 days after the , ? 
Rockefeller. Commission report _ on 
CIA activities said, "The drug pro- , 
gram. was part of a much larger CIA' 
prograth to study possible means for 
controlling human behavior. Other 
studies explored the effects of fladia-
lion, electric shock, psychiatry, sod-
ology and harassment substances." 
Marks sought details of the various 
experiments, but the documents he 
received yesterday covered little 
some aspects of CIA work, such as 11 
radiation experimentation. 
The Rockefeller report noted that 
in 1973, 152 files of CIA records on 
behavior modification programs 
were destroyed. 
The documents released yesterday 
disclose that the shredding of the 
files was ordered by Richard ?M. 
Helms, director of central intelli-
gence shortly before his resignation, 
despite the written protest of at least 
one other CIA official. 
CIA IFIEARS THAT Russian, North 
Korean and other intelligence agen-
cies were using mind-bending drugs ? 
to elicit secrets - from American 
agents and others in the late 1940s 
prompted the agency to begin its 
behavior modification studies pro-
gram, according to the documents 
and earlier references in the Rocke-
feller report. - 
The documents disclose that the 
CIA decided it needed the behavior - 
control program after studies of 
testimony at Russian-directed trials, ; 
such as that of Josef Cardinal Minds-
zenty in Hungary in 1949, raised the 
specter of "bizarre confessions" and 
unnatural human behavior. 
The testimony of Mindszenty and 
memory lapses about a trip across 
Manchuria by U.S. soldiers who were 
Korean POWs convinced CIA offi-
cials that foreign intelligence serv-
ices were conducting behavior con-
trol experiments with numerous 
techniques using drugs, electric 
shock, sound waves and other meth-
ods.

? termeasures to such tactics and to 
use techniques to exercise absolute 
control over its own employes. 
THE DOCUMENTS disclose that 
CIA officials were anxious to experi-
ment with the, Korean War POWs to 
determine whether the foreigners 
had tampered with the minds of the 
imprisoned Americans. ? 
The documents mention CIA wari-
ness of possible public reaction to 
such experimentation with POWs 
recuperating at a military hospital in 
Valley Forge, Pa. No mention is 
made about whether testing was 
later performed with the POWs. 
Another case referred to is that of 
Associated Press correspondent Wil-
liam N. Oatis, the AP bureau chief in 
Prague, Czechoslovakia, who was ar-
rested in April, 1951, by Czech au- I 
thorities and imprisoned for more 1 
than two years on "espionage 
charges." 
. ? 
One document said that the CIA 
approached the AP for cooperation in 
testing Oatis when he returned in 
May of 1953 but that Oatis was being 
held "practically incommunicado' 
by the AP and was unavailable-for 
testing because the AP was "down on 
this agency." 
? Another document said a discus-
sion by a CIA doctor with an un-
named AP executive gleaned "cer-
tain facts," including the information 
that Oatis was in "surprisingly good 
condition at the time of his release" 
from the Czech prison. 
? 
FRANK J. STARZEL, general 
manager of the Associated Press at 
? the time, said yesterday, "That's 
ridiculous. He wasn't being ? held 
incommunicado. His being in good 
health was a lot of nonsense. When he 
came back, he was as foggy as they 
come." Starzel said he did not recall

The purchase of LSD was discussed 
in a conference report dated Oct. 22, 
1953. It referred to an "alleged offer 
of the [named deleted] Company" to 
. sell 10 kilograms at a price "estimated 
to be $240,000 or less." 
The conferees agreed the drug 
should be purchased "if possible," the 
report said, but the documents do not 
reveal Whether such a purchase ? was 
actually made. 
One month later, in November, 1953, 
Dr. Frank Olson, a civilian biochemist 
at Fort Detrick, Md., committed sui-
cide in New York after drinking an af-
ter-dinner 'cordial which the 'CIA, 
without his knowledge, had laced with 
LSD. 
In a "Memorandum for the Record"

Most of the research and develop-
ment was contracted out to other gov-
ernment and private agencies, includ-
ing academic and industrial institu-
tions, the memorandum said. 
Another document said the final 
phase of MKULTRA testing involved 
"application to unwitting subjects in 
normal situations commencing in 1955 
under an informal arrangement with 
individuals in the Bureau of Narcote 
ies, under which two of its employees 
on the West Coast conducted tests. A 
similar arrangement was made for the 
East Coast in 1961." 
That document does not say where - 
the tests were conducted. 
- "In a number of instances the test 
subject became ill for hours or days, 
including hospitalization in at least 
, one case," it notes. 
A third document says: "Testing 
was . . . often carried out at such fa-
cilities as the U.S. Drug Treatment 
Center in Frankfort, Ky., and the Cali-
fornia State Prison in Vacaville. In all 
cases that I am aware of, testing was 
done using volunteer inmates who 
were witting of the nature of the test 
program but not the ultimate sponsor-

of significant progress in the Mkultra

All Mkultra records and files were 
destroyed Jan. 31, 1973, at the instruc-
?tions of a' Sidney Gottlieb, former 
chief of t -r.A branch having juris-
diction over the project. 
A memorandum addressed to the 
CIA Inspector General says that all 
CIA experimentation with drugs to in-
fluence behavior ended in? 1967 and 
that the agency's indirect involvement 
with such programs ended in August, 
1973. 
A July 26, 1963, report to then CIA 
director John A. McCone said, "The 
concepts involved in manipulating hu-
man behavior are found by many peo-
ple both within and outside the 
agency to be distasteful and 
unethical . . ." 
? An Aug. 14, 1963, "report of inspec-

testing phase also "... places the 
: rights and interests of U.S. citizens in 
jeopardy." 
It said even though Mkultra worked 
with "an inventory of discrediting,. 
disabling and lethal substances," in-
spection of the program was ham-
pered by a lack of records. Only two 
unnamed, "highly skilled"? individuals 
"have full substantive knowledge of

CIA (INVESTMENTS) 
'-SOUTHERN Capital '? and-
Management is What is 
known in the irutelligence 
trade as a " proprietary " ? 
a wholly owned and operated 
subsidiary of the US Central 
Inteligente Agency.. 
S ) far as is -known, South-
ern Capital is the CIA's . 
lar-
gest remaining Proprietary. 
Its work in manag,ing the 
CIA's $30 million investment 
"portf?olio is so secret that the 
agency persuaded ? the 
Senate intelligence corn-
Inittee "not to press for the 
company's actual name, 
. instead calling it "the 
insurance complex." 
For more than' 20. years, 
the CIA has made extensive 
use of proprietaries, like 
Southern capital, to hide 
operations under the mantle 
of private enterprise. To 
incorporate and - run this 
"business" empire, the 
agency has relied on lawyers 
.who perform secret services 
for the agency's.overlapping, 
interlocking network of front 
companies. ? 
Southern Capital takes the 
CL.. straight to Wall Street. 
It is the investment arm of 
an assortment of proprietary 
financial companies, located 
mainly in tax havens, such 
as the "Bahamas, Bermuda, 
the Cayman Islands, and 
r ',enema. . 
Southern Capital was 
-created in .1062 as a front 
, insurance company to pro. 
- vide coverage for agents and 
equipment involved in covert 
operations ? particularly 
:those connected with CIA= 
owned airlines. "The 
insurance complex" then 
brandhed . out into other 
entrepreneurial ventures. It 
received money from CIA 
%insurance premiums, . from 
'!deductions taken from secret 
;agents' pay and ? at least 
once in the past 10 years, 
according to a CIA budget - 
specialist ?, from hands left 
;over from the agency's con-
gressional appropriation. 
By the late 1960s, Southern 
,Capital had on hand between 
$25 million and $30 million 
which it invested in a mix 
of stocks, bonds, and other 
"securities ? both foreign and 
domestic. During the early 
years, investment decisions 
were made largely by a 
larokerage firm. ? ? 
But in either'1969 or 1970, 
,an internal CIA study con-
eluded that the agency would 
receive a higher profit if CIA 
experts decided what to buy 
and sell. A special CIA board 
:of directors, chaired by the 
_then general counsel, Mr 
:Lawrence Houston, took over 
:the selection of securities for 
-Southern Capital. 
On this committee ? 
-which ? was called the MH 
Mutual Group ? say the 
?CIA's chief of budgeting, the 
director of finance, and the 
head of the office of economic 
research. 
This last member was par-
ticularly important, according 
to an inside CIA source, 
i because he erablecl Southern 
Capital to "draw on the 
; advice of the (CIA's) econo-
mic research people. Any 
stockbroker would like 300 
trained experts giving advice. 
If it was not a conflict of 
ze ye! 
interest, it, at -least should 
have been offered to the 
public." . 
The proprietary's ? best 
earner was Eurodollar. depo-
sits made through the 
Morgan Guaranty Bank's 
Brussels. office with a return 
of 13 per cent at one point; 
a former employee recalls. 
After the mutual committee 
took over, Southern Capital 
branched ? out from its' 
normal blue chip purchases 
to More speculative fields, 
including . short-term buys 
' of Swiss francs and several 
hundred thousand dollars 
in Mexican pesos. " 
Another source reports 
that during the early 1970s, 
when the CIA was working 
secretly with ITT to keep 
President Allende from 
power in Chile, Southern 
Capital owned some ITT 
-
stock. Mutual's.chairman told 
the Senate committee : 
Well, a couple of times our 
investment adviser recom-
mended a stock which I knew 
? we had big contracts with, 
and 1 told the board no, this 
involvers a conflict of 
interest. We won't touch it." 
The net profit on Southern 
Capital's portfolio in 1074 
was more than $1.5 millions, 
' according to toe Senate 
eeoort. Most of that money 
never found its may on to 
Southern's balance sheets,

Mr Nelson, now 69, has set 
ep 16 airlines in his time' 
and has run his own supple-
mental carrier. Sometimes he 
has cooperated with' the CIA. 
? but vehemently states he 
has never 'been under the 
agency's central. He will not 
tell which Of , his airline deals 
involved the CIA. He does 
say, however, that US 
Government involvement in 
foreign airlines is as great 
as ever. ? . 
? Some of America's com-
mercial airlines have worked 
closely -with the CIA in -the I 
past. A retired CIA official 
with 20 years' 1 of field 
experience recalls: " When 
we wanted something from. ' 
Pan Aim, we went right to 
Juan Tripe" (the corpora-
tion's 'ex-chief). In Panama, ? 
tee former official says, the 1 
agency had a deal with Pan' 
Am in the mid-1950s under 
.which CIA num could rum-
mage through baggage during 
transit stops.' The airline' 
even provided them with 
mechanics overalls. . 
United- Business Associates 
had 'other ways of getting 
informatilon from, foreign 
'farmer -President now living, 
'told the Senate committees in 
a written response to questions 
that he did not recall ever hav-
ing received information while 
President that the C.I.A. or any 
other Government agency was 
engaged in opening mail with-
out the authority of a judicial 
warrant. 
' Asked how the Justice De-
partment lawyers had squared 
their conclusion about the ex-
istence of continuing Presiden-
tial authority with Mr. Nixon's 
denial of any such knowledge, 
the official replied that the de-
partment had "looked at more 
than that [the denial] in "draft-
? ing its recommendation. 
He declined, however, to 
characterize the additional evi-
dence examined by the lawyers. 
Mr. Nixon's purported igno-
rance of the C.I.A. mail-inter-
cept program was a main point 
at the Senate Committee's hear-
ings, and . the committee staff 
rebuked some of Mr. Nixons' 
aides for having advised him 
in 1970 that such coverage had 
been discontinued when it had 
not. 
Although Mr. Levi has not 
yet decided whether to accept 
the recommendation of his 
criminal division lawyers not 
to prosecute those who took 
part in or had knowledge 'of 
the mail openings, the recom-
mendation was believed to in-
crease the likelihood that no 
C.I.A. employees will face 
: qtVRDP77-00432R0001 
countries and planting agents 
in key places. An' ex-
employee remembers: "We 
were miming companies all 
over the world as a manage-
ment concern. We would hire 
and place a manager into a 
company, and he would then . 
report back to us as far as 
' the financial recorse . were 
concerned. In turn, we would 
report .back to the investor.'1 ? 
The investor was the cm. 
Similarly, in recent years, 
the CIA has set UP manage-
ment consultant firms in the 
international' energy field. An 
executive at one of Wall 
Street's most ',important 
investment banks confirms. 
that certain consultant firms, , 
with ties- to US intelligence, , 
win , governmental and pri-
vate contracts in the Middle 
East as management experts 
and use these positions to 
gather secret economic intel-
ligence. The investment 
banker reports that this data 
is then passed on, at least 
in part, to American com-
panies in a position' to profit 
'from 'it. 
' From the ? CIA's point of 
view, of course, the principal 
value of the proprietaries' 
penetration. of 'international 
business comes from the 
knowledge and consequent 
leverage flowing bark to the 
agency. It has gathered volu-
minous information, on both 
Americans, and foreigners ? 
information which is pre-
served in orange ,cardboard 
folders, known as "201 files." 
The 201 file on the interna-
tional stock manipulator, Mr 
Robert Vesco, for instance, is 
more than six inches thick.

Criminal Charge's as a result of 
the various investigations of the 
agency's activities. ? 
The criminal division, headed 
by Assistant Attorney .General 
Richard L. Thornburgh, has 
been sifting evidence of C.I.A. 
wrongdoing assembled by 
President Ford's commission 
set up last year to look into 
the agency's domestic opera-
tions and material assembled 
by the Senate intelligence com-
mittee on some of its foreign 
activities. 
Mr. Thornburgh has previ-I 
ously recommmended to Mr. 
Levi that no indictments be, 
sought in the C.I.A.'s various 
plots in the' early 1960's against 
the life of Prime Minister Fidel 
Castro of Cuba and of the late 
Congolese leader, Patrice 
Lumumba. 
' A third major aspect of the 
Justice Department's investiga-

After the party arrived at the grass airstrip

on any item of intelligence." .

Influencing the news 
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, George Bush, 
told representatives or the National News Council .Tune 24 
that no newsman affiliated in any way with an American 
news organization would be hired for any purpose by that 
agency. This applied to full-time employes,?foreign nationals 
Working for a U.S. news agency, stringers,, and free lance 
writers. Any affiliate falling into these categories has been. 
.or'would_be teprninated as a CIA employe, he said. 
Furthermore, CIA .will not use news reporting or jour-
- nalism aS,a. "cover" for any of its operatives. . 
We welcome this assurance after many months of state-
ments from CIA director Bush that be "wouldn't" hire full-
time or part-time correspondents and then a Senate Select 
Committee report that it was still being done. E&P on May 1 
? demanded CIA cut out the "double-talk." 
:Now, we wait and see if it "sticks." 
This proclivity of CIA to Use journalists and a newsman's 
"covet"' to cloak the work of its agents probably already has 
had a disastrous effect on the reputation of U.S. news ser-
vices and their representatives abroad. It is partly respon-
sible, undoubtedly, for the. fin-illation of a new propaganda 
network of official government press agencies just- or-
ganized at a meeting in New Delhi. 
It must be remembered, also, that the 58 deveroping coun-
tries that formed the pool of government press agencies, "to 
liberate their information and mass .media from the colonial 
legacy," believe that only their own definition of "news" is 
correct and legitimate. 
If this arrangement is adopted, as it probably will.be, at a 
meeting of the heads of state of these third-world nations 
next month, it will inaugurate an era of rapid deterioration 
of what was once proudly called "world freedom of informa-
tion." The authenticity of news from those nations will be 
greatly suspect. The "news" will be only the official version. 
Independent newsmen and news agencies will be restricted; 
and probably denied- access to those countries. 
The New Delhi proposal is right in line with that being 
considered at a UNESCO- meeting in Costa Rica this week 
for establishment of a Latin American news agency com-
posed of official government information (or propaganda) 
agencies. 
Most of those nations involved in the New Delhi and the 
Costa Rica proposals have already suppressed the free press 
within their borders. Their people will be spoon-fed the 'offi-
cial version of the news and their ruling parties, cliques, or 
juntas, will perpetuate themselves in power because of it. 
Government f L'Aws? 
. _High Government . officials are, often afflicted with 
? strange advice, but one of the most bizarre submissions 
to a Cabinet officer in recent years must be the recom-
mendation from Justice Department -lawyers- to Attorney 
.General Levi that the Government.. not prosecute .the 
?Central. Intelligence Agency officials , responsible for 
"Operation HT Lingual." To those ,unfamiliar with the 
agency's .secret lingo, "HT Lingual" is' the code name for 
? the 20-year program of opening mail in transit 
between the United, States.. and Communist countries. 
I UnderFederal law, tampering with first-class mail' in this 
?country is- a criminal. offense; but under a theory .con-
cocted by Justice Department lawyers,?"a.continuum of 
Presidential authority" gave legality to the program, no 
matter what the law said.? 
This notion amounts to the assertion that Presidential 
knowledge of a crime is sufficient to revoke the opera?
tion- of the law, or in other words, a crime is a crime 
ekcept when a number of Presidents wink at it. 
Not even Richard Nixon in extremis went that far. 
When the Supreme Court ruled that his claim of execu-
tive privilege was subordinate to the requirements of 
the criminal processes of the United States, he turned 
over tapes that he had clearly been advised would sink 
him. Indeed, it is hard to imagine any President making 
the power-grab that Justice Department lawyers are now 
upholding: that the Chief Executive had the authority 
to exercise secretly a power that has no basis in the 
Constitution or the law and that he would not have dared 
.to claim publicly. Thus to place the President above 
the law is. an unacceptable extension of the American 
constitutional system.

CIA 
Has the controversial Central In-
telligence Agency?the CIA?been 
PHOENIX reformed after the scandalous ex-
? posure hi Congress of the cloak-
and-dagger agency's illegal and often criminal 
activities? Not at all. Those unsavory activities 
are going on as usual, and include assassinations 
of political opponents. 
_ 
The 'Main locale of those assassinations cur-
.rently is Argentina and the victims are, More 
often than not, the die-hard supporters of Maria 
Estela (Isabellita) ,Peron, the constitutionally 
-elected President of Argentina.. Mrs. Peron suc-
ceeded to the Presidency after the death of her 
husband, President Juan Domingo Peron. She had 
been elected Vice-President of Argentina on her 
husband's ticket. 
Currently- she. is being held prisoner by the 
CIA-sponsored military junta in Buenos Aires, - 
-headed by General Jorge Videla, a CIA pet. The 
assassinations of the Latin politicoes which are 
now going on at -a fast clip are carried out by 
the Videla regime, which the U.S. Government 
, ..is financing-with your tax money. - 
Most recent information to. WO is that the 
CIA-sponsored military dictatorships. of Argen-
tina, Chile and Uruguay are cooperating in a CIA-
instigated terror campaign against political re-
fugees, Argentine dissidents and some 20,000 
? exiles who have sought. shelter in Argentina while 
that country will still ruled by Presidents Juan 
Domingo and Maria Estela Peron. 
? Now, those refugees have nowhere to go, ex-
cept to the bleak Falkland Lianas off Argentine 
Patagonia, becan.ce the military regimes in con-
tiguous Brazil, Bolivia and Peru are also under 
the CIA aegis. This kind of information, dramatic 
as it may be, of the current plight of the hot-
headed Latin politicos, who have committed no 
crime and are being exterminated by goons bank-
rolled with your tax dollars, you will not find in the 
?gresponsible" news media. However, newspapers 
from Madrid, T.ondon and Stockholm often con-
tain facts regarding what is going on iii our own 
backyard. 
- "The sight ? was -far from unusual in today's 
Argentina," reads a dispatch from its Holmberg, - 
.the South American correspondent of Dagens 
Nybeter of -Stockholm (Monday, May '24, 1976): 
Four bodies in a car parked in the center of Buenos 
Aires, all of them with their hands tied behind their 
?back and riddled with bullets. .. William Whitelaw 
and his wife Rosario Barred', Whitelaw. from Uru-
guay, and two Uruguayan senators, Zeirnar Miche)ini ? 
and Hector Guttierez Ruiz had been kidnapped in 
Buenos Aires by armed men who showed official 
documents indicating they were Government police ? 
officers. The four people were taken away in broad 
daylight and amid a wild uproar, with street crowds , 
watching as the three men shouted in protest. Senora 
Whitelaw cried for help and . her three children-4-
year old Gabriela, 16 months old Maria Victoria and 
2 months old Maximo?just cried. The public ap- ? 
parently knew it was a Government operation and 
did not intervene as the four adults and the three 
infants were Abducted. The authorities waited for 
two days before acknowledging the discovery, of the. - 
four adultahduCtees.... The official note was mum 
about the abduction of the three Whitelaw children 
?and about their fate. Military sources privately 
indicate that the four weredoneaway by special naval 
"commandos"?Arg,entine Navy personnel who have 
been especially selected by the regime of General 
Jorge Videla to liquidate political opponents and - 
their most dangerous supporters. . . .? 
WO readers should not mistakenly ,conclude 
that CIA projects have anything- whatsoever to 
do with the national interest or, whether their tar-
gets are communist, non-communist, anti-corn-
?. 
inunist, right-wing, left-wing, conservative, social-
1st, monarchist or whatever. The aim of the CIA 
is' Simply and consistently to do what is in The 
best interests of the international banks and 
multi-national corporations?with particular rcL. 
ference to the securing of the oil and mineral re-?. 
sources of the world. 
Take the situation- in Argentina, for example. 
The issue there is primarily the vast oil deposits 
lying off the coast. The Peronist regime did not 
want to turn the exploitation of this national re-
source over to Bockefeller. 
Shortly after the accession to power of the 
Videla regime, it was quietly announced that 
? Exxon?the flagship of the multinational Rocke-
feller operations?would he permitted to re-
turn to Argentina from whence it was thrown 
b-
out by General Peron in 1974. And the regime also 
announced that the multinational oil companies - 
will shortly be invited to explore the vast oil de-
posits off the Argentina continental shelf. 
According to a U.S. Geological Survey report, . 
there are 200 billion barrels of oil in these off-. 
share deposits, more than the reserves in Saudi 
Arabia. This does not include the oil in continental 
Argentina or the possibly even larger deposits 
around the Falkland Islands.

Schorr has refused to say

The Ethics Committee is 
in the final phases of a 
fourth-month, $150,000 
investigation into the 
source of Schorr's leak. The 
House voted earlier this 
year to suppress the contro-
versial intelligence report 
until President Ford could

source he refuses to identify

much of it verbatim.

have testified they suspect-; 
ed the CIA gave Schorr the 
report in an effort to dis-
credit the Intelligence 
Committee's work, but 
Stanton was the first to re-
port information attributed 
to Schorr himself. 
Under questioning by 
Ethics Committee counsel 
John Marshall, he said 
Schorr raised the subject 
himself during a casual 
conversation in the House 
Speaker's Lobby sometime 
in February. 
"He indicated on that 
Intelligence Committee has testified 
that unauthorized White House per-

to the press. 
"I know of friends in the White 
House who had absolutely nothing to 
do with intelligence who saw it," A. 
Searle Field told House investigators 
yesterday. The Ethics Committee' 
investigators are trying to determine 
who leaked the report to CBS report-
er Daniel Schorr. 
"Who were they?" counsel John 
Marshal asked Field. 
"I'LL TELL YOU in executive 
(closed) session," Field replied. 
Field, who ran the staff of the now 
defunct intelligence panel, was the 
occasion he had received 
the report from the CIA, 
and he volunteered this," 
Stanton said. "I was sur-
prised." 
He said Schorr did not 
say who in the CIA alleged-
ly gave him the report. The 
congressman said he did 
not ask and never again 
discussed the matter with 
Schorr. 
LATER, REPORTERS 
asked Stanton whether he 
thought Schorr was being 
serious when he volunteer-
ed to disclose the source of 
the leak ? a secret that has 
rankled Congress and i. 
fueled Washington gossip 
for months. 
"I never know when he's 
serious," Stanton replied. 
Another witness, former 
Intelligence Committee ; 
counsel Aaron Donner, said 
it was "unfair" to keep 
staff members of the now-
defunct intelligence panel 
under suspicion when the 
committee could ask Schorr 
himself who the sonrce of

er this year completed its probe of 
CIA covert activities with a report 
filled with classified information and 
severely critical of U.S. spy opera-
tions. The House voted to keep the

The ?unpleasant .likelihood that the famous., "leak". of 
'the suppressed ? House Select Conunittee on Intelligence 
report came from the executive, rather than the legisla-
tive,?branch of our government has been vastly strength-
ened in recent days. The theory that this might :be so is 
not new. As I.F. Stone and others, including this maga-. 
zinc, have observed, the leak perfectly served the ends 
the CIA. . 
There has been so much leaking, counter-leaking, 
obfuscation, incompetence and plain lying about this af-
fair that it is worth rehearsing the bare facts of the case 
before making a judgment on the latest. developments: It 
will .be recalled, shat, in Watergate's wake, :Congress 
blossomed with righteous indignation at the abuses of the 
"intelligence 'community" which peeped out from under 
all the attempted Cover-ups. The Congressional pose was 
that it never knew about all these scandalous activities by 
the imperial spies, even though ?several members of both 
houses had all the access to the essential .information. 
that they needed?all they lacked was the:Will' to do 
something about it. ? . 
There came a proliferation of . committees to probe 
and pry and tell all. One of them was. the House Select 
Committee on. Intelligence, headed by Rep. Otis Pike 
(D., N.Y.). The Pike committee spent months on the 
job, not to mention $1 initlici?, and finally came up with, 
a. report. This committee was more free-swinging and less 
"statesmanlike" than its sober-sided Senate equivalent, 
headed by Sen. Frank Church (D., Idaho). In its rather 
brawling way, it. poked into darker corners of the spy 
world, thars.,411sac herch .group felt comfortable doing. 
Whereas Chtirehandhis colleagues worked hand in glove 
with the executive departments to produce a "respon-
sible" reformist report (shocking as even that was), the 
Pike 'committee :took an adversary stanee almost from 
"Absolutely not. I did not provide a 
copy of the report to anybody." , 
David Bowers, the Ethics Commit-
tee's director of investigation, had 
identified Miss Parker on Monday as 
secretary to 'Clay Felker, editor-in 
chief of the Village Voice. Bowers 
said Felker sent Miss Parker to 
Washington on Feb. 6 to get the 
Schorr copy. 
"She ?went to an unrecalled ad-
dress where she picked up a package 
from a maid and returned to New.. 
York by shuttle flight. . . aware the-
package contained a copy of the Se-
lect Cornmmittee report,"? Bowers 
had said Monday. 
DURING the afternoon ?sessionl

Bit by bit, it Managed to extract-nuggets of informa-
tion on the blacker arts of spying, domestic and foreign, 
as practiced by the CIA and the FBI; among other 
agencies of the United States. The agencies dragged their 
feet, of course, resisting with all their considerable might 
the quite reasonable requests for enlightenment that came 
from the Pike committee. At last the committee produced 
a report, or rather several versions of a report, based 
on the scraps of inforrnation it had been able to wheedle 
and force out of the ;Ty agencies. 
From the CIA's standpoint, after all the battles over 
classification were done, the worst thing about the Pike 
report was the picture of bumbling ineffectiveness which 
emerged. The illegalities' and ,outrageous subversions of 
constitutional government that were writ large in it they 
yesterday, Field took exception to an 
Ethics Committee investigator's re-
port that the intelligence panel had 
lax security standards. 
"We had better security than the 
CIA and FBI," he said. "I was not 
impressed by the FBI and CIA staff-
ers who we worked with. They were 
incredibly sloppy." 
He said agents would walk up to 
him in the House corridors, ask 
someone to identify him and "give 
me a bunch of classified documents." 
He said his staff handled 75,000 
classified documents and evey one 
was accounted for and returned to 
the CIA and other agencies that sup-
plied them.

And so the central Intelligente ?Agency conspired (not 
too strong a word) with the rest of the executive branch. 
and ?with its friends in Congress to have the Pike corn-
:mittee report suppressed.. All this, of course,' was in' the 
interests of "national security" and of an "eft:sc. 
sponsible intelligence system." It was .the ultirnate cover-
up. 'Incredibly, the .House went along with it: The full. .

ttxred itself as unable to conduct the business of this coun- ? 
try abroad if an -"irresponsible" Congress could not be 
trusted with the secrets necessary to our survival as a 
nation. And so on. At last Schorr found himself apparent-
ly in ?sole possession of a copy of this hot potato. Rather 
than burn or bury it, or. hide it in his chimney, Schorr ? 
took on himself the responsibility to decide, contrary to 
the cowardly vote in the House, that the document should ? 
be made .public, and it was (improbably, in New York's 
Village Voice). ? . - 
The House, offended and made to look ridiculous, 
decided to do something about this ultimate leak. It has 
spent four months. and SIAM.? trying to find out .where 
Schorr got his -copy. Quite properly, Schorr and the 
other reporters who at. one time or another had the docu-
ment in their bands are refusing to .reveal their sourcrs 
(and CBS', which has suspended Schorr from all report-
ing, is supporting him in that position). It seems 'in-
creasingly doubtful that the House investigating com-
mittee will ever solve the mystery.. ? 
We now come full circle back to the question of who 
had a motive for letting the report out and thus tarnish-
ing Congress with the reputation. for being a bunch of 
blabbermouths who can't be trusted with the nation's . 
secrets, Along comes Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.) with 
the revelation, or admission, that he gave a copy of the 
final Pike committee report to the CIA. Aspin says that, 
after all, the information in the report came Iron; the in-
telligence agencies, and he adds the curious, but probably 
accurate, statement that what he did "was not done with 
authority (from Congress) and it was rot done without 
authority."

1 meats. 
Ford is contending that to do so 
would "risk disclosure of extremely 
. sensitive foreign intelligence and 
counterintelligence information that 
would be damaging to the national 
security." 
Lee told Gasch that this was a 
"rare case, only the second time in 
history where the president has as-
serted executive privilege in the sub-
poena of documents by the Con-
gress." 
The first instance, he noted later, 
was the battle by Senate and House 
committees investigating the Water-
gate scandal to obtain President 
Richard Nixon's White House tapes.

lows weeks of unsuccessful negotii-
: tions between the White House and 
, the subcommittee chairman, Rep. 
-John E. Moss, D-Calif., in an effort 
to resolve ?the problem. Moss had 
noted that only two days after the 
subpoena was issued, he was visited 
by two of Ford's closest advisers ? 
Philip W. Buchen, counsel to ceptable risks"' to- national 
the President and John 0. security. 
He presented as an alter-
native a plan under which 
I the FBI would separate 
documents held by AT&T 
relating to domestic tele-
phone surveillance from 
those dealing with foreign 
intelligence surveillance 
, and provide the former to 
the subcommittee.' 
Under Ford's offer, for-
eign intelligence documents 
from any two years also 
could be obtained by the 
_ 
subcommittee, but they 
would be "edited" to 'delete 
"names, addresses, line or 
telephone numbers and 
other information which 
would disclose targets of 
the surveillances, sources 
of information about the 
targets, and methods of 
surveillance." The docu-
ments would disclose, how-
ever, whether the targets 
were U.S. citizens. 
LEE ARGUED before 
Gasch that if the unedited 
letters were sent to the sub-
committee, the surveillance. 
targets would become 
known.

Investigating charges that a 
'paid FBI informer burglar-
, ized Socialist Workers Party 
? offices in Denver on July 7 t 
in connection with his as-
signment to spy on the left-
wing organization. 
Assistant -Attorney Gen-
eral J. Stanley Pottinger 
said yesterday that the de-
partment's Civil Rights Divi-
sion is looking into the alle-
gations "as part of an on-
going investigation" into 
charges that bureau agents 
.conducted illegal break-ins 
during the last five years, 
long after the FBI said such 
burglaries had ended. 
In an action related to the 
case, U.S. District Court 
Judge 'Thomas P. Griesa 
ruled yesterday that SWP 
lawyers could go to Denver 
with a subpoena demanding 
that the reported informer, 
Timothy ? J. Redfearn, give 
a? deposition Friday on his 
alleged role in the burglary. 
The Socialist Workers 
Party, has . also asked that 
Theodore Rosack, the FBI 
agent...in charge in Denver, 
give a deposition in the ease. 
The SWP has filed a $37 
million civil damage suit 
against the federal govern-
ment alleging that the FBI, 
CIA and other intelligence 
agencies' sought to harass 
the party through . break-ins, 
electronic surveillance and 
infiltration by informers. 
In another action yester-
day regarding the suit, filed 
in New York City, Judge 
Griesa asked the CIA to 
turn over to him all unex-
purgated documents relat-
ing to overseas surveillance 
of the party's members. 
CIA Director George 
Bush said in a sworn state-
ment made public nearly 
two weeks ago that the CIA 
had overseas surveillance 
files on SWP members. 
However, Bush said the 
agency could not provide 
BAKFRSFIFLD, CAL. 
CALIFORNIAN

the court with complete 
files because of national se-
curity considerations. 
? Griesa said yesterday that 
the documents given to him 
by the CIA were, in some 
cases, "90 per cent deleted," 
making it "very hard to deal 
intelligently" with the issues 
in the SWIP suit. 
FBI officials in Denver 
and at the agency's national 
headquarters in the District 
of Columbia refused to com-
? ment on the charges involv-
ing Redfearn. Redfearn, 'in 
-a telephone conversation 
Tuesday declined to discuss 
the SWP burglary. ' 
According to Denver par-
ty coordinator Ruth Getts, 
, Redfearn admitted to her 
and several other party 
members that he received ? 
about $400 monthly for sev-
en months to !spy on the 
Denver branch of the Young 
Socialist Alliance, the par-
ty's youth arm. Getts said 
Redfearn made the admis-
sion following the appear-
ance of Denver media stor-
ies identifying him as the 
suspected burglar of the 
SWP headquarters. 
Denver Police Chief Ar-
thur Dill said yesterday that 
Redfearn was linked to the 
SWP burglary?in which the 
party's membership, phone 
and meeting Lii e s were 
taken?after being arrested 
July 14 in connection with 
another burglary that occur-
red in late June. 
Dill said Redfearn was 
picked up on a warrant July 
14 after returning to Den-
ver from Texas. "He [Red-
Learn) signed a sear ch 
waiver and we went to his 
place and found a couple of 
items from the first bur-
glary," Dill said. 
Dill said the FBI called 
the Denver police later that 
day to'say that the bureau 
believed Redfearn also pos-
sessed items taken in the 
SWP burglary., 
The police chief said he 
"didn't get into" the ques-
tion of why the FBI believed 
Redfearn had materials 
stolen from the SWP. He 
said Denver police made a 
second search of Redfearn's 
apartment building where, 
Dill said, the SWP files were 
found in several cartons in 
a storage area.

much wider Cointel program recently 
detailed by Congressional investi-
gators. 
All of this has followed the forced 
resignation of L. Patrick Gray 3d as 
Bureau director, for complicity, in the 
Watergate cover-up, and further Con-, 
gressional disclosures concerning the 
F.B.I.'s campaign to discredit Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King Jr., its inadequate in-
vestigation of President Kennedy's 
assassination, and its frequent use for 
secret political purposes by Presidents 
going back to Franklin Roosevelt. 
Various investigations are going for-
ward within the Justice Department, 
and apparently are being pushed with 
more zeal than ' is Usually the case 
when one bureaucracy investigates an-
other. But even without such inquiries, 
at least three reasons why. the F.B.I. 
accumulated so much dirty linen over 
its "untouchable" years can be dis-
cerned. 
The. first, of course, is the long 
tenure and the sanctified status at-
tained by J. Edgar Hoover in his un-
paralleled half a century as F.B:I. di-
rector?owing as much to his bureau-
cratic and public relations mastery 
as to his control of the F.B.I. files 
of secret and personal information. 
This prime fact led directly to a 
second?that in the Hoover years there 
was literally no Congressional over-
sight of the F.B.I. Its budget requests 
at one time were not even subjected 
to line-by-line analysis, but simply ap-
proved without question. 
The .F.B.I., moreover, has semi-. 
? 
autonomous status. Technically. it is 
an arm of the Justice Department and 
subordinated to the Attorney General, 
but in practice the latter official can-
not conceivably control or even moni-
tor all F.B.I. activities. One inevitable 
result is that a direct line of authority 
runs informally from any President to 
the F.B.I. director, opening up?as 
Watergate showed?all sorts of du-
bious possibilities. 
To some extent, these problems have 
been dealt with by exposure of past 
excesses, by the law requiring a nomi-
nee for the director's job to be con-
firmed by the Senate, and by new 
Congressional arrangements that theo-
retically subject the bureau to more 
stringent oversight, both as to its 
_budget and its operations. A single, 
fixed term of eight years or less for 
a director was recommended by the 
Intelligence Committee; and whoever 
appoints Mr. Kelley's successor prob-
ably would do well to nominate a total 
outsider with authority, enough to 
dominate the bureau's old-boy net-
work and Hoover traditionalists. 
Administrative responsibility for the 
F.B.I. seems more troublesome. Giving 
greater authority over the bureau to 
the Department of Justice, as recom-
mended by the Intelligence Committee, 
may be sufficient in the bureau's 
present shattered condition, and with 
an attorney general of Edward Levi's 
stature in- the Ford Administration. 
1 In other administrations and with a 
I more pliable attorney general, how-
ever, that course could give a Presi-
dent even greater ability to make the 
F.B.I. his political instrument. Circum-
stances are easily imaginable, in fact, 
where the F.B.I. ought to be free to 
investigate the Justice Department or 
the President himself without admin-
istrative inhibition. 
What may really be needed is less, 
not more Presidential control?which 
can too easily become political direc-
tion?over the Government's most 
powerful investigative arm. But if so, 
V:here is administrative responsibility 
for the F.B.I. to be lodged?

U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT, Aug. 9, 1976 
SPECIAL REPORT In Next Decade 
EA UP 
OF COMMUNIST WORLD? 
Steady disintegration lies ahead for the international 
Communist movement, already fractured by the split 
between Russia and China. That split will persist, 
whoever comes to power in Peking and Moscow. 
Western Europe's Communist parties, in or out of 
government, will hold Moscow more and more at arm's 
length and support NATO for self-protection. Uneasy 
Soviet domination of Eastern Europe will? be main-
tained through the 1980s only by the continued pres-
ence of a big army of occupation. 
That is the picture that emerges from a sweeping 
three-hour briefing by senior Government analysts for 
editors of U.S. News & World Report?an authoritative 
look at the world in which the U.S. must operate 
during the next decade. 
Among other key conclusions: 
A new global order. It will come after five to 10 
years of "great uncertainty," with this country still 
capable of restraining Soviet ambitions and limiting 
international conflict 
Spread of nuclear weapons. As many as 20 nations 
may join the "nuclear club," but odds are that these 
weapons will not be used in this century, except 
possibly by a terrorist gang bent on blackmail. 
Soviet-American d?nte. A major change will 
take place in Russian leadership, but the aims of 
Kremlin foreign policy will remain the same through 
the 1980s: co-operation with the U.S. to gain economic, 
political and military advantages, combined with con-
trolled rivalry to expand Moscow's influence. 
Third world. It will be the weakness, not the 
strength, of developing countries that will worry Wash-
ington. These nations, dependent on the US. for food, 
technology and peace, will have little success in an 
attempt to blackmail America with commodity cartels 
or embargoes. 
What follows are details given by the panel of 
analysts who specialize in political, economic and 
strategic affairs. 
RUSSIA vs. CHINA: An Unending Conflict 
. A continuing struggle is foreseen' between _Russia and 
China?one that the U.S. will be able to exploit to gain 
leverage with both Communist powers. Some improvement 
in relations between Moscow and Peking is anticipated after 
Mao Tse-tung passes from the scene. But: 
"We see the conflict as a problem that is really not going tc 
be solved. There are too many things separating these 
countries, too many elements working at cross-purposes. I 
don't think they will ever get back to where they were in the 
'50s when they had a Sino-Soviet friendship treaty, thousands 
of Soviet technicians in China and other close ties like that." 
The analysts note this suprising feature of the Sino-Soviet 
c, millet: China is "an extremely underde,eloped country 
with modest power, and that is not going to change in the 
near future." Yet, the Russians, with all their power, are 
more apprehensive about China than vice versa. 
In fact, a "grand paranoia" is noted in Moscow concerning 
the Chinese and the 4,500-mile border that separates the two 
countries. One specialist puts it this way: "The Soviets don't 
understand the Chinese. They don't know what they're up 
to. They just can't fit them in. The old-time Soviet leaders 
are worried about the Chinese constantly." 
Another expert expresses the view that, "on an emotional 
level, China is probably a far greater concern to Soviet 
leaders than the fear of an American nuclear attack against 
the Soviet Union." 
The meaning of all this for the U.S.? From a specialist in 
international politics: -The mutual fear and distrust that the 
Soviet Union and China harbor toward each other will keep - 
them sufficiently apart so that the U.S. can operate as a kind 
of catalytic element between the two." 
In short, American planners reckon that the triangular 
Moscow-Peking-Washington relationship that is a corner-
stone of U.S. foreign policy will continue for the foreseeable 
future with no real reconciliation between the two Commu-
nist powers. 
EURO-COMMUNISM: How Dangerous for West? 
The analysts are in sharp disagreement with Secretary of 
State Henry Kissinger over the rise of Euro-Communism. 
Mr. Kissinger has warned that the participation of Com-
munists in the government of a major Western European 
country would be disastrous for the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
Not so, according to the panel of official experts. They say ? 
that if Communists gain a role in the Italian Government, for 
? example, they will want to preserve the Alliance for their 
own self-protection, no matter what headaches they create 
for their non-Communist allies. In the words of the panel's 
political specialist: 
"National interest will dominate, whether there are Corn-
munists in the Government or not. I don't see any disintegra-
tion of NATO, not to the extent that it can be exploited by ? 
the Warsaw Pact. I'm inclined to think that the Communists 
in Western Europe say, in an Italian Government?will 
want some sort of pact with the West, with the U.S. in 
particular, as a deterrent to any Soviet threat to overrun 
their country." 
The breakup of a Communist world under Soviet domina-
tion will be accelerated by the rise of national Communism 
in Western Europe. Thus: "If the Communists do come into 
power in Western Europe, you will have a different brand of 
Communism than you have in the Soviet Union, just as you 
already have a different brand in China, Yugoslavia, Vietnam 
and North Korea. I don't think the Soviets will dominate the 
Italian or French Communists in office any more than they - 
dominate them now." 
In fact, the case is made that the Russians will be happy to 
maintain the status quo in Europe. They are doing well in 
their dealings with the existing non-Communist govern-
ments in Italy and France and don't necessarily see any 
immediate advantage in having Communists share power in 
these countries, especially Communists that they do not 
completely control. 
A Soviet foreign-policy specialist goes further: "The Rus-
sians have no particular desire to break up NATO. Because of 
paranoia among the leaders about the dangers of a reunited 
Germany, they regard NATO as a highly desirable organism 
for the Soviet *Union." 
Growing Western European Communist defiance of the 
Kremlin raises questions about Russia's future hold over 
Eastern Europe. Recent riots in Poland dramatized the 
dangerous pressures that can boil up in these countries. The

Approved For Release 2001/08/08: CIA-RDP77-00432R000100390004-1 
experts say that the Soviet leaders can maintain their grip 
over Eastern Europe during the decade ahead only with the 
presence of a strong army of occupation. That force current-
ly numbers 31 divisions. 
RUSSIA vs. U.S.: Return to Cold War? 
Looking ahead into the 1980s, no change is foreseen in 
current Soviet policy that would reignite the cold war. 
Rivalry between the superpowers will continue. Both will 
engage in probing operations. And there is always the 
danger of miscalculation in a crisis involving "client states." 
But, on balance, the experts are reasonably confident that 
Soviet-American d?nte will remain a central feature of the 
international landscape well into the future. 
From a specialist on Soviet foreign policy: "Over all, I see 
nothing that makes me fear that the Soviet Union is going to 
change course and take a different direction in relations with 
the U.S. I think the Russian leadership considers that things 
are going pretty much their way now. Despite temporary 
setbacks, such as their harvest failure, they see a fair number 
of successes in the world and, as they view it, 'the correlation 
of forces' seems to be moving in their favor." 
The crucial question: Can Moscow get political mileage out 
of its growing military power? A strategic expert says that 
there is a widespread perception that Soviet military power 
is greater than America's. And, in his view, that perception is 
at least partly accurate: "The good old days of 10 years ago 
when we clearly were on top are over. The parity or 
superiority question is iffy, depending on the subject or the 
area you want to pick. But it's no longer so clear-cut." 
The U.S. retains an indisputable lead in technology, and 
doubts are strong that the Russians will be able to match the 
West in this field. Reason: "Their system doesn't seem to 
? provide the necessary incentive for innovation and initiative 
to develop advanced technology." 
However, two factors are cited which offset this Russian 
handicap. One is the fact that the "United States is fairly 
compliant in providing advanced technology" to Moscow. 
The other is the battlefield reliability of Russian weapons in 
comparison with the performance of America's more techno-
logically advanced equipment. 
Russia's rulers may be counting on a third advantage?
confused U.S, leadership and an unwillingness to compete in 
a continuing contest for global influence. They will be intent 
on "preventing us from gaining the upper hand anywhere 
and will be alert to targets of opportunity." A direct Soviet 
challenge to U.S. power in areas of vital interest is discount-
ed: But America still will face more tests in peripheral 
areas?"more Angolas"?where the Kremlin may feel it can 
make gains without provoking a reaction from Washington. 
The experts maintain that the Russians, in attempting to 
expand their influence to distant regions, will expect to use 
native populations to promote their influence rather than 
intervene directly with their own military forces. A Soviet-
affairs analyst says the Russians "don't have a long-range-
intervention capability, and there is no sign that they are 
building significant forces that would enable them to inter-
vene at long distance in a conflict situation." 
How will Soviet foreign policy be affected by the demise of 
Communist Party leader Leonid Brezhnev and the rise to 
power of a new generation in the Kremlin? Not much if at 
all, in the opinion of the analysts. Their judgment: "The 
people corning up don't seem to be all that different from 
? the people who already are there." 
NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION: Can It Be Checked? 
The spread of nuclear weapons to more and more nations 
is inevitable and unstoppable in the decade ahead. 
In the words of the panel's scientific specialist: "To suggest 
that there really is any feasible way of halting the spread of 
nuclear weapons is just a forlorn hope. We must face up to 
the fact that in five to 10 years there will be a significantly 
larger number of nations than now with some kind of 
capability to detonate a nuclear device." 
He adds that such nuclear devices "won't necessarily be 
what we call 'weaponized'?not something in the front end 
of a sophisticated missile. But it will be something that will 
go 'bang' and at first probably will be used for prestige 
purposes." 
A significant- spread of nuclear weapons is considered 
inevitable "because there are too many different actors 
getting on the stage - vvbo are able to. offer the necessary 
technology needed to pro a weapon -or an explosive 
As for the scale of nuclear proliferation, here is the picture:. 
In addition to the six present members of the nuclear club?
the U.S., Russia, Britain, China, France and India?there are. 
at least 15 "near members." By the end of the century, an 
estimated 40 countries will have nuclear reactors. The ability 
of these countries to "go nuclear" will depend on whether 
they can be prevented from extracting plutonium produced 
in their reactors. With that, they can manufacture nuclear 
devices or weapons "the size of an automobile trunk, and 
fairly easily." 
With nuclear reactors spreading on such a vast scale, what 
are the risks of an accident? The judgment of one expert: 
"The likelihood of a serious reactor accident which would kill 
or severely affect large numbers of people is very low." 
NUCLEAR WAR: The Ultimate Nightmare 
Despite the "inevitable" spread of nuclear weapons, the 
danger of nuclear war in the next quarter century is rated as 
a minor risk, especially as far as the U.S. is concerned. One 
view: "The likelihood of a nuclear war between the great 
powers is small for the next 10 years and, I'd say, pretty small 
for the next 25 years. If anything, nuclear weapons have 
created an atmosphere of stability." 
From a Soviet-affairs expert: "I would have to go down on 
the side of the optimists?on the basis of everything we know 
about the attitude of the Soviet Union toward nudear war." 
As for a nuclear conflict initiated by other countries 
besides the superpowers, a third expert gives this assessment: 
"If you rule out irrationality, I would say that for the next 10 
years or more the odds are 1 in 100,000--even 1 in a 
million?that a nuclear weapon will be used by one nation 
against another deliberately." 
Neither the U.S. nor the Soviet Union is likely to allow a 
client state to drag it into a nuclear conflict. The mutual 
interests of the superpowers on this issue supersede any 
interest they may have in a client. The Russians are de-
scribed as even more reluctant than the U.S. when it comes 
to transferring to other countries nuclear technology that 
might be used for developing weapons. This was a major 
factor behind the bust-up between Peking and Moscow. 
Further deterring smaller states from using nuclear weap-
ons against a neighbor is the knowledge that, in the end, they 
probably would gain nothing since the two superpowers?"if 
they get angry enough"?can control the political outcome 
of any such conflict. 
What about a state, such as Israel, that might feel its very 
survival threatened and contemplate the use of nuclear 
weapons in desperation? It's the consensus of the analysts ' 
that "the Soviet Union and the US. in most cases can see that 
these situations don't play out in a way that would drive a 
, country to such an act of desperation." 
The conclusion of the panel's strategic specialist in sizing 
up the danger of nuclear war in the decade ahead: "The , 
consequences of nuclear war are so horrendous that it's 
something we think about constantly. But I think we're off 
on the wrong track in speculating on this possibility. I don't 
see nuclear weapons as being particularly viable as some-
thing that nations actually would use to resolve conflicts." 
NUCLEAR TERRORISM: The Real Danger 
While the threat of nuclear war through the 1980s is 
discounted, nuclear terrorism is viewed as a growing threat_ 
An intensive study of the problem by Government analysts. 
points up this conclusion: It is the- ''psychotic, anarchical 
groups," whose behavior is entirely unpredictable, that pose - 
the real danger when it comes to nuclear blackmail. 
The more established, better organized terrorist groups 
that seek defined political objectives?such as the Palestine 
Liberation Organization?will be deterred from going this 
route. The reason: They would realize that it would prove 
counterproductive in view of the inevitably adverse world-
wide reaction that would be set off by the explosion of a

Approved F.orRelease 2001/08/08.: clA,RDP77700432R000100396004-1 
nuclear weapon. 
A nuclear-arms specialist on the panel makes the point: 
"The only thing that gives you some feeling of serenity is that 
it is still not all that easy to acquire a nuclear weapon, move 
it secretly and use it. And the groups that have the greatest 
ability to do it are precisely the ones that have the least 
? motive to do it." 
More likely than a nuclear explosion detonated by terror-
ists is the seizure of a nuclear power facility and the threat to 
pollute a city with radioactive material. 
? The panel's scientific expert sees a different threat from. 
terrorists and criminals: "If your aim is to blackmail a 
government or to establish the seriousness of your purpose, 
it's a lot easier to use chemical and biological contaminants. 
These are easier for terrorists to acquire, easier to move 
secretly and easier to use in a controlled way than nuclear 
weapons." 
The over-all danger of a nuclear weapon being detonated 
in the years ahead by a terrorist or criminal gang is summed 
up by the panel's arms analyst: "It's like Russian.roulette. But 
instead of six chambers in the gun, there are perhaps 100 
chambers. So maybe we can get by.'' 
FOOD POWER: An Uncertain Asset 
The U.S. today stands out as the breadbasket for the world, 
one ? of the' few remaining areas' that produces big food 
surpluses. But it would be easy to exaggerate the amount of 
global political influence that this country can derive from its 
agripower. The experts stress this point: A distinction must 
be drawn between power and leverage. 
There's no doubt, they say, that America's "relative pow: . 
? 
em" will increase in coming years in view of the enormous 
growth in world population, the inability, of many poorer 
countries to expand their agriculture production adequately 
and hence their dependence on U.S. food surpluses to avert 
hunger -and even famine from time to time. "But whether 
we will be able to use this power effectively for political or 
diplomatic purposes is more questionable." 
Why not? The panel's international specialist says that 
some nations may become more resentful toward the U.S. 
because of their dependence on American food. In some 
countries, Washington, through the use of food, may gain 
influence but only at the cost of antagonizing others. 
In fact, the experts emphasize the agonizing dilemmas 
that will confront Washington: '"It's going to be a very great 
burden deciding who is to get American food and who is not, 
whether to sell it to nations that have money or to give it to 
countries with greater need but no money." 
The analysts even question whether this country can get 
any political mileage out of the fact that Russia has become a 
major importer of American grains. To quote a Soviet-affairs 
specialist: "It gives us certain power, but I'm not so sure that 
it gives us all that much leverage in our dealings with the 
Soviet Union. They may find it a little easier to buy from us, a 
little more efficient. But, if necessary, they could get the 
grain elsewhere?in Canada or Australia." 
Washington's ability to use the nation's food surpluses to - 
gain political leverage is severely inhibited by domestic 
factors, too. A political expert spells out the problem: "Sure, 
you can write a position paper on how it should be done. But 
given the social-political-economic realities that dictate the 
way this country functions, the simple truth is that no one is 
going to give the President or the Secretary of State the kind 
of authority that it would take to use our food as a political 
weapon in bargaining with the Russians or anyone else." - 
NORTH vs. SOUTH: Strength Through Weakness 
There is a popular theory that the U.S. and its industrial 
allies in the decade ahead will face the threat of blackmail 
from a whole string of new OPEC's?corn, 
modity cartels organized by developing 
countries. 
That, in the opinion of official Washing-
ton analysts, is almost 100 per cent wrong. 
The real danger of international instability 
stems from the weakness of the developing 
countries rather than from the danger of 
embargoes by the producers of zinc, cop-
per or bauxite. 
In the words of the panel's international-
economic specialist: "Over the next 10 
years, there may be a few occasions when 
for a period of six months or so we will face 
the discomfort of adjusting to a cartel or 
embargo. But taking the over-all picture, 
it's going to be the weakness of third-world 
countries which is going to concern us and 
not their ability to turn any kind of screw." 
Though the U.S. will become increasing-
' ly dependent on imported raw materials in 
the future, the developing countries' de-
pendence on the U.S. for food, technology 
. and peace will be greater than America's' 
dependence on them for raw materials. 
Result: The Western industrialized nations 
will retain access to these raw materials on 
terms that are reasonable but not as favor-
able as those that prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s. "We will 
have the strong cards in North-South negotiations," says an 
economic expert. 
America's bargaining position, the Government analysts 
say, is strengthened further by "our ability to adapt and to 
develop substitutes to meet our needs. So in a ,test of 
economic strength we can outlast the third-world countries." 
, Oil is a special case?at least for a time. In the.absence of 
eConomic pressures that would force the U.S. to develop 
alternative sources of energy, this country has failed to take a 
political decision to pursue that course. But specialists on the 
official panel maintain that "in the long run, the oil problem 
can be solved in a number of ways?by .adaptation and by 
' change." 
The oil embargo in 1973 and early 1974 gave developing 
countries a "false sense of power." But .now, to quote an 
international economic specialist: "You can see a growing 
awareness of where power really lies over the long term. The 
1 heady feeling that the poorer, countries had in '73 and '74 is 
' receding. Rhetorically, they will make noises about forcing 
us to accept a new international order on their terms. But 
when it gets down to hard bargaining, they know that we 
have the power." 
In dealing with the third world over all in the decade 
ahead, the analysts warn that Americans face this paradox: 
"There is a very large element of power that the third world 
has, and that is its actual powerlessness. Despite their eco-
nomic, political and military weakness, these countries have 
the great strength that stems from appealing to the moral 
and ethical conscience of the powerful West." 
' The official forecast: "In ongoing negotiations, the U.S. will 
make generous concessions to the developing nations, not 
because of the fear of economic blackmail," but in an effort 
to build a stable and more secure international system. 
Over all, the panel of official analysts who briefed the 
magazine's editors sees ahead a period of five to 10 years of 
floundering and uncertainty as a new world order is formed. 
In the view of the experts, the extent of instability and 
conflict involved in this process and the ultimate shape of the 
new world order will depend largely on the role that 
, America chooses to play.

EAST-WEST 
Taking the Measure of Helsinki 
? Amid glowing pledges to promote 
"better relations among nations," 35 
? heads of government* gathered in the 
capital of Finland one year ago this week 
? to sign a document that a small army 
? of negotiators had taken two years to 
. prepare. Today the . vaunted Helsinki 
. agreement remains what it was from the 
start: more ceremony than substance. 
There has been so little improvement 
in Fast-West relations that can be cred-
.f ited to the accord that the spirit of 
Hel-
sinki has become increasingly dispirited. 
1 
The anniversary is being observed 
enthusiastically enough in the Soviet 
;* Union, which is celebrating the occa-
? sion with special television programs, 
endless newspaper articles and the pub-
lication of a book. After all, the Rus-
sians were the original sponsors of Hel-
sinki, and their dominance of Eastern 
Europe and the Baltic states, a fact for 
more than a generation, was legitimized 
by the accord. This kind of quasi-jurid-
ical sanction had long been a major goal 
of Kremlin foreign policy. 
Unfounded Fears. In the West, 
and most notably the U.S., where Pres-
ident Ford has banned the word detente 
from his political year lexicon, the an-
niversary is being all but ignored. One 
reason is that some of NATO's initial hes-
itations have been justified: the gains of 
? Communists in Southern Europe are 
partly attributable to the post-Helsinki 
mood, in which the threat of interna-
tional Communism has appeared to be 
further diminished. Yet the West's main 
' fear, that a Helsinki-inspired euphoria 
I Would lead to sharp cutbacks in defense 
; spending by NATO nations, seems so far 
1 to have been unfounded. 
In return for the West's ratification 
of Soviet post-1945 territorial gains, 
*Representing every European state (except Al-
bania), as well as the U.S. and Canada. 
Moscow and its allies had to pledge, 
among other things, increased East-
West cultural and human contacts. Cul-
tural exchanges have indeed burgeoned, 
as measured by the rising -East-West 
traffic in groups involved in sports, art 
and other fields, and tourism within the 
Soviet Union is being expanded. But 
Western scorekeepers fault the Soviets 
in other areas, notably human rights, in-
cluding the treatment of political dis-
sidents and would-be emigrants. Al-
though the Kremlin has cut the price of 
emigration visas by one-fourth, to 300 
rubles ($405), and allowed some dissi-
dents and relatives of those outside to 
emigrate, people who apply for the vi-
sas are usually penalized immediately by 
a loss of their jobs. 
After a period of petulance over crit-
icism of its record on human rights, Mos-
cow early this year switched to a policy 
of visible compliance with Helsinld 
through what are known in diplomatic 
parlance as "small steps," such as eased 
travel restrictions on foreign newsmen 
and inviting Western observers to So-
viet military exercises. More recently, 
the Soviets have been marking time on 
new Helsinki initiatives of their own, 
while rapping Radio Liberty and Ra-
dio Free Europe, which broadcast into 
Russia and Eastern Europe, and Wash-
ington's public opposition to Communist 
participation in Western European gov-
ernments, as violations of the Helsinki 
pledge of noninterference in other coun-
tries' affairs. Another complaint: the dif-
ficulty European Communists have in 
visiting the U.S. Concedes one U.S. of-
ficial: "Our self-righteous position is not 
as credible as we'd like to think." 
That reflects what many regard as 
the Helsinki accord's main value: as a 
yardstick for measuring East-West re-
lations, and thus part of the process of re-

fining them. The accord's clearest fail-
ing has been its inability to bring East 
and West any closer to reducing or lim-
iting their levels of armaments. The 
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, for ex-
ample, have been almost completely 
deadlocked since President Gerald Ford 
and Soviet Party Boss Leonid Brezhnev 
met at Vladivostock in November 1974. 
There also has been little progress in 
the three-year-old Mutual and Balanced 
Force Reductions (stunt) talks in Vi-
enna between the twelve NATO nations 
and the seven Warsaw Pact states. It 
has been the dual aim of the NATO ne-
gotiators to reduce the number of trpops 
based in Central Europe and crate par-
ity between East and West in that re-
gion. But even as the MBFR talks have 
been in session, there has been a build-
up of armed forces in that area?almost 
all by the Soviets.. 
In what some observers view as a 
sign of progress, Moscow for the first 
time revealed the pact's force levels in 
Central Europe: 965,000, v. 977,000 for 
NATO. This means that parity already 
exists. NATO experts, however, question 
the Soviet figures and reckon that the 
pact really stations some 1,125,000 
troops in that region. Until both sides 
agree on how large the pact's forces are, 
there may be little progress with MBFR. 
Moscow may be tempted to make 
some concessions soon, in order to show 
progress in arms limitation in time for 
next June's Belgrade conference, at 
which the first two years' experience of 
the Helsinki accord is to be assessed. 
Unless there is progress on SALT or MBFR 
and an improvement in Soviet treatment 
of human-rights cases, it is likely, as a 
West German official predicts, that the 
"tone of the Belgrade meeting is not go-
ing to be very upbeat."

Russia: Anot

On the fourth of July, the Soviet Un-
ion exploded a little firecracker in 
honor of Uncle Sam's 200th birthday: 
an underground explosion well over 
the limits agreed to by the U.S. and the 
U.S.S.R. in their Much publicized new

It was no accident: An even larger So-

nated July 29, just a week after the 
treaty was submitted to the U.S. Senate 
for ratification. Those two blasts infuri-
ated U.S. scientists and military offi-
cers who understood the Russians had 
agreed to obey the initialed treaty even 
before U.S. ratification would formal-
ize it.

sions except in classified documents.

can delegates in Jackson, Miss., July SO; 
President Ford praised Soviet compli-
ance with past arms control agree-
ments. Clearly, neither Mr. Ford nor 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 
wants any unpleasantness about Soviet 
treaty violations to interfere with their 
forthcoming big push for a new Strate-
gic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT) 
agreement. 
An honest division of opinion exists 
Inside the administration over how se-
rious the Kremlin's bad faith really 
was, particularly since chances of early 
Senate ratification are poor. Some 
hard-liners believe that Soviet fudging 
on this relatively minor, unratified 
treaty does not compare with flagrant 
cheating on the major, ratified SALT I 
Treaty (a violation again stubbornly de-
nied by Mr. Ford in Mississippi July 30). 
Nevertheless, serious government 
scientists closest to the program are in-
furiated. They say both the U.S. and the 
Soviet Union agreed to follow the 150 
kiloton ceiling on peaceful nuclear ex-
plosions set forth in the treaty initialed 
? by Mr. Ford and Chairman Leonid 
Brezhnev May 28. The U.S., in fact, 
obeyed that limit in its one explosion 
since then and will do so in the future. 
Not so the Soviet July 4 blast. While 
publicly ignoring the explosion.. the 
ing ii Even secret documents circu-
lated inside the government listed the 
blast vaguely as 100 kilotons-plus, in 
contrast to the past practice of precise 
estimates. 
Such imprecision seems more the 
product of diplomatic subtlety than sci-
entific caution. US scientists, as famil-
iar with the geologic formations of the 
Soviet Underground testing areas as 
they are with the backs of their own 
hands, are confident the explosion eas-
ily exceeded 200 kilotons. ' 
Ignoring this excess, Mr. Ford on 
July n sent to the Senate for ratifica-
tion two treaties: the peaceful Nuclear 
Explosion Treaty he had initialed in, 
May and the Weapons Test Ban Treaty, 
also setting a 150 kiloton limit, that was 
initialed by Brezhnev and President 
Nixon July 3, 1974. 
One week later Came the July 29 
blast, also exceeding 200 kilotons but at 
first confused by seismic experts with 
an actual earthquake near the Caspian 
Sea. Skeptical U.S. scientists believe the 
Soviets took advantage of the earth-
quake to detonate their device in hopes 
it would not be noticed, but knowledga-
ble officials here scoff at this notion as

It is revealing to see what has hap-

human contact and informational and 
cultural exchanges in the "Final Act" 
of the Conference on Security and Co-
operation in Europe, signed in Helsinki 
' a year ago today.

tactics designed to minimize Russian 
compliance with these proposals. Even

more discouraging, the West has been 
reluctant to develop strong initiatives 
to capitalize on Basket III. 
As chairman of the U.S. Advisory 
Commission on International Educa-
tional and Cultural Affairs, I travelled 
to the Soviet Union and East Europe 
after Helsinki and returned with no il-
lusions that there would be a dramatic 
increase in contacts. The Soviet Union 
had resisted the inclusion of specific, 
binding language. I doubted that the 
agreement's expression of good .inten-
tions would cause the U.S.S.R. to alter 
basic policies. Nevertheless, I felt that 
'the agreement offered opportunities 
for positive action in this field. I made 
this point, together with specific rec-
ommendations, upon my return. 
Since then, many of the fears about 
Soviet intentions have been realized. 
Soviet officials moved to muffle the re-
verberation of Basket III at home. They 
trotted out the old arguments against 
?"ideological relaxation." A get-tough 
policy has just been instituted against 
dissidents or other Soviet citizens who 
had hoped that contacts with the West 
might be eased. For example, require-
ments for exit visas were changed; a So-
viet citizen must now give up his apart-
ment before applying to emigrate. So 
15 Soviet Jews wrote U.N. Secretary 
General Kurt Waldheim: "If a visa is de-
nied, which is the usual procedure of 
the Soviet government, the applying 
family is left. .. without shelter from 
the elements." 
The Soviet government instituted a 
very selective policy of "compliance" 
with Basket III proposals. For example: 
Travel restrictions on foreign journal-
ists were somewhat relaxed; they now 
have about as much freedom as diplo-
mats?which is not excessive. (This, in-
cidentally, is one Basket DI issue on 
which the U.S. government has made 
strong, effective representations.) Cop-
ies of more Western newspapers have 
been put on sale at Moscow newsstands; 
this is a practice that predates Helsinki, 
but is now.trumpeted abroad by Tass as 
a gesture "in the spirit of Helsinki." 
At the same time, the Soviet Union 
has mounted a heavy propaganda cam-
paign accusing the United States and 
other Western nations of violating the 
Basket III agreements. The campaign 
has included charges that we restrict. 
circulation 4:1 Soviet films and books. 
And Soviet commentators have said. 
with straight faces that U.S. shortwave 
news broadcasts beamed toward the 
U.S.S.R. are i: violation. 
Congress rac ted to this situation sev-
eral months ago. It established a-15- ? 
member commission to monitor the 
Helsinki accord: six congressmen, six 
senators, and three officials of the ex-
ecutive branch. Although the President 
signed the bill on July 3, the executive 
branch was clearly unenthusiastic. 
While the congressional move is im-
portant, the basic initiative in this field 
must come from the executive branch. 
What can be done? 
First, we should make clear that the 
United States gives the subject the very, 
highest priority. 
Second, we should put forward spe-
cific proposals for implementing Bas-
ket III. These proposals should be publi-
cized widely in this country, in Europe, 
and to audiences in Communist coun-
tries. Our proposals should be more ? 
pragmatic, realizable, designed to at-
tract the support of influential young 
professionals in Communist lands who 
want more "windows on the West." 
What proposals? 
?Expanded cultural and educa-
tional exchange. Perhaps the clearest 
impression that I received in talks with 
Communist officials was their willing-
ness to step up academic and other pro-
fessional contacts. During the past , 
year, however, there have been no pro-
posals to expand significantly the State 
Department's exchanges with Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union. The ad-
ministration pleads a tight budget and 
other priorities?and indeed knocked 
$5 million from the appropriation for 
the department's Bureau of Educa-
tional and Cultural Affairs. 
?Encouraging the flaw of inform-

tion. There is a tremendous demand for 
Western publications, films and other 
media in Communist countries. During 
the 1960s the U.S. Information Agency 
operated an innovative program 
known as the Informational Media 
Guarantee Program, which allowed 
some Eastern European countries to 
. purchase American media materials 
' with their own currencies, and at little 
'or no cost to the United States. I rec-
ommended that this program be rein-
stituted. Subsequently, the proposal 
was endorsed by the Government Advi-
sory Committee on International Book 
and Library Programs. But no imple-
mentation has been started. 
?Increased circulation of "Ameri-
ca" magazine. This publication, put 
out by USIA, has been an effective in-
terpreter of American ideas and events 
to the Soviet Union for over 30 years. 
? Demand for copies far exceeds the sup-
ply we are allowed to sell (60,000 per 
month). It would seem logical to press 
the Soviets to allow, "in the spirit of 
Helsinki,"an increase in circulation.

Law Lets Radio Resist Pressures . . 
Voice of 
By Richard M. Weintraub 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
, Almost unnoticed, Con-
gress has 'Put into law a 
?Voice of America charter, 
giving independence to writ-
ers and editors of the offi-
cial United States overseas 
radio system in their selec-
tion and play of news. 
President Ford signed the 
Foreign Relations Authori-
zation Act on July 12, but.a 
White House press release 
did not mention that the 
measure gave legal sanction 
for the first time to the 
VOA charter, which previ-
ously lacked the backing of 
law. 
Many Voice of America 
employees now say that for 
the first time they have a le-
gal basis to resist pressures 
from the State Department 
or VOA's parent organiza-
tion, the U.S. Information 
Agency, to soften or omit 
news items. 
The new charter requires 
VOA: 
* to be a "consistently re-
liable , and authoritative 
source of news" that is 
"accurate, objective and 
comprehensive." 
e to "represent America, 
not any single segment of 
it," and to present a 
"balanced and comprehen-
sive projection of significant 
eri 
_ 
American thought and insti-
tutions." 
? to present the "policies 
of the United States clearly 
. and effectively" and also to 
"present responsible discus:.-
sion and opinion on these 
policies." , 
? Officials of USIA say that 
the change in the VOA char-
ter's status makes no differ-
ence in day-to-day opera-
tions. 'VOA's director disa-
grees, however. 
'We will always have 
bitzers and suggested guid-
ance, and we, don't object to 
t'that as long as it is enlight-
fened. Now we have some 
thing to measure it against," 
Kenneth R. Giddens, assist-
ant USIA director in 
charge of VOA, said in an 
interview. 
.; "I think it is-an immense 
step forward,". he said. 'We 
knew our general direction,,_ 
but it never had the force of . 
law.. . so we :would be Pro-, 
tected." 
t Reporters and editors at 
VOA have chafed for years 
under what they view as un-
warranted interference in 
the reporting of the news, to 
the detriment of VOA's 
credibility among its listen-
ers overseas. 
Sen. Charles H. Percy (R-
IM) charged during hear-
ings last year, for example, 
that VOA was in violation 
of Its charter by suppressing , 
which they can contribute to programs, 
or collaborate on activities, that might 
lead toward Basket III goals. : ? 
, There a-e. of course, many other , 
ways we implement Basket III. , 
There is now some urgency to our ac-
tions. Next year there will be a follow-
up conference in Belgrade to review' 
steps taken by all signatory countries to 
carry forward the recommendations 
made at Helsinki. A preparatory meet-
ing to organize the follow-up confer-
ence is scheduled for June 15, 1977. The 
Soviet Union can be expected to pre-
sent a well-documented case to demon- : 
strate its "achievements" in complying 
.with Basket III, and an equally shrill 
one on our alleged violations of it.,Wee 
must be prepared to respond. . 
What we need is a, positive policy; 
backed up by concrete action, to chal-
lenge the U.S.S.A. on the real issue, the 
opening of all borders to more human 
and informational contacts, which are 
central to the development of peaceful 
relations. Our purpose should not be 
simply to rack up a good score in the 
Basket III League. It should be to prove_ 
that we have put the Helsinki princi-
ples high on the agenda of East-West 
relations, not simply as a diplomatic ex-
ercise but as a part of our historic com-
mitment to the free movement of men 
and ideas.

U.S. involvement in the Viet-
nam war. The charter, which 
was drawn up in 1959, had 
not then been enacted into 
law, although the language 
was the same. ? 
USIA officials said yak 
editors and writers were 
limited to official state-
ments because the radio was 
'listened to in Saigon 'and 
other reports could have 
caused violence _ and 
bloodshed. Critics countered 
that everything that VOA 
was suppressing was being 
reported regularly by other 
news agencies and radios. 
By design or by coinci-
dence, Democratic presiden-
tial candidate Jimmy Car-
ter's campaign issued a posi-
tion paper on the issue of in-
ternational broadcasting as 
! the 'charter' was being 
turned into law. 
"The Voice of America ... 
has been entangled in a web 
of political restrictions im-
posed by the Department of 
State, which seriously limit's 
; its effectiveness," the Carter 
; paper says. 
Carter criticized the Ford 
administration for its "in-
ability . . to appreciate 
the importance of pn open 
foreign policy and a free 
flow of Information and 
Ideas through mass commu-
nication." 
A -Senate aide said that 
'the Foreign Relations Au- . 
thorization Act gives Con-

"The purpose of putting 
the charter into law is to, 
strengthen the tendency to-
ward standard news judg-
ment. 'When incidents do ar-
ise, when news might be 
slanted, this will give a 
chance to place what has 
been done against a legal 
standard."

however, that nothing is 
changed by making the 
VOA charter law. ' ? 
"I'm not aware of any pro-

Law of the Sea: no U.S. rudder 
The importance Of the Conference on the 
- Law of the Sea, which reconvened on Monday 
for its fifth session since 1973, does not seem to 
be widely understood. Yet through it some 150 
nations are negotiating to create a new regime ._ 
for 70 percent of the earth's surface. 
The need to do so arises out of changed con-
ditions: many new coastal states, growing de-
, mend for resources and food, and new tech-
nologies for exploiting the ocean. A new sys-
tem is essential .to prevent conflict and vio-
lence in the years ahead over fishing, offshore 
oil and gas, deep-sea mining, and pollution as 
well as navigation and research. It is espe-
cially vital for the United States which has the 
largest stake in the ocean, with the most ad-
.vanced technology and with critical security 
needs for use by its strategic submarines and 
Navy. 
With so many participants and such complex 
issues, the conference has inevitably moved 
slowly, but it has made progress toward re-
solving many of the thorny issues._ Those still 
remaining, especially deep-sea mining, will 
; take persistence, hard work, and goodwill in 
order to complete a treaty within another year 
or more. Clearly the negotiations are now in 
the critical stage which will determine their 
success or failure. 
' Accirdingly, one would expect that the U.S. 
would be entering this phase well organized 
, And prepared to provide constructive lead-
ership. If so, one would be quite mistaken. Wil-
liars Clements Jr., Deputy Defense Secretary, 
calls the U.S. situation "a first-class mess." 
1:According to him. U.S. policymaking "hasn't 
had the direction and management that it 
:should have had." And John N. Moore, former 
By Robert R. Bowle 
chairman of the National Security Council task 
force for the conference and deputy head of 
the delegation, who resigned in March over 
policy issues, concurs. Indeed the facts speak 
for themselves. 
? For well over a year, the U.S. has not had 
effective leadership for the negotiations. For 
many months the top post in the delegation-
was vacant and _then was filled in December 
with a business executive who had no ex-
perience with the oceans, foreign affairs, inter-
national negotiations, or law. Aside from two 
speeches, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 
has given minimum attention to the subject. 
? Worse yet, in April the U.S. undercut the 
conference by legislation unilaterally extending 
its fishing jurisdiction to 200 miles effective in - 
March, 1977, in violation of its treaty, obliga-
tion. Yielding to pressures from fishing inter-
ests, the administration did not exert itself to 
head off the bill in Congress or to push other 
remedies for Japanese and Soviet overfishing 
which would be compatible with inter-
national law., Unilateral action by the US. in-
vites similar claims by others harmful to its 
security and other interests, complicates the 
negotiations, and jeopardizes broader coopera-
tion. 
? Finally, the administration has apparently 
not kept the Congress adequately abreast of 
the negotiations. As a result, Moore fears that 
the Senate might reject the ultimate treaty. 
Secretary Kissinger will attend the current 
-conference session, and will doubtless make a 
well-written speech. But that is no substitute 
for adequate policymaking. 
The case of the oceans is riot unique. They, 
are merely one example of the manifold global * 
problems which must be regulated or managed

A Nuclear Cop t? 
President Ford has just an-
nounced a full-scale White House 
'review of nuclear export policy, and 
we hope the President and his aides

their own review. They confront not 
some kind of public relations prob-
lem; 'but a vastly important policy 
oUt of control. 
This review will go far toward 
'determining how many 'additional : 
''nations will acquire nuclear weep-
,ons over the next decade, or two. 
'Nuclear power reactors have now; 
spread to some 45 nations. More 
importantly, we have just witned?
,the first purchases of reprocessing 
' technology, which extracts pinto-. 
niurn 'from spent power-reactor 
'use 
the plutonium ostensibly is for 
. use as further reactor fuel but can 
r be converted almost at a moment's' 
' notice into nuclear bombs. Thus un-
less a decision is made almost fin-
mediately, we will lose our last 
thence to erect meaningful barriers 
to the spread of nuclear weapons: 
A decision will, be easy to post-
pane, since even the most important 
matters of 15 years hence tend to 
got,b0st in the rush of government, 
jointly. Cooperative means for this purpose are 
required for energy, food, resources, trade 
and money, nuclear proliferation, pollution, 
and North-South relations generally. These are 
the substance of "world-order politics" to 
which Jimmy Carter would assign much higher 
priority. - 
For these issues one-man diplomacy is ir-
relevant, and indeed a serious obstacle to con-
structive action. Rjeads to substituting rheto-
ric for policymaking. Over the last year, the 
Secretary of State has made speeches on many 
of these issues of interdependence. However 
well they may read, they have seldom been re-: 
fleeted in active policy. That would require an 
entirely different system of policymaking. 
Effective solutions of such problems can 
only be worked out by reconciling or com-
promising conflicting interests and approaches 
both in domestic polities and internationally. 
That can only be achieved by patient and per-
sistent effort at many levels as well as lead-
ership and direction from the top. When Secre-
tary George Marshall made his famous speech 
at Harvard in 1947, for example, it set in mo-
tion a major organized effort in the executive 
branch. and Congrea,s- t?copvert the idea into

Very little of that kind of coordinated work 
has been done in any of these fields. The 
truth is, the United States does not now have 
practical policies to back up much of the rheto-
ric. And it cannot have them without radical 
changes in the methods of making policy.

strumental in creating the interna-

lies to play such dangerous games 
for fleeting commercial advantages, 
and encourages the feebleness at 
the IAEA. For the U.S. has never 
really been serious about prolifera-
tion dangers in nuclear exports, and 
if the leading nuclear nation is not 
serious, why should the others be? 
Consider the case of India, which 
actually did build a nuclear bomb 
with materials and technologies 
supplied for peaceful purposes. It 
happened that the Indians used a 
Canadian reactor to make pluto-
nium for its bomb, but the reactor 
employed U.S. heavy water, like

terial" limited by treaty to peaceful 
uses. Indian compliance with this 
provision consisted of labeling their

he eanadian reaction was to 
halt work on two power reactors in 
India, demand tough new safe-
guards, and when these were not 
.forthcoming to halt all sales and 
shipments of nuclear materials for., 
? India. The U.S. State Department's 
reaction has been to make excuses 
C for the Indians. 
? The U.S. did announce that ship-
ments to India would be suspended 
pending -agreement that henceforth

;'peaceful uses" would not include . 
explosions. In fact, even this wrist-
?slap was not carried through; a , 
shipment of nuclear fuel for Ameri-
can-built reactors in India went out' 
a 
a month after the explosion. Then 
State asked the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission to expedite licensing of 
new shipments to India on the 
grounds that the American-built re-
actors were ?running out of fuel., 
, Persistent questioning determined 
that the reactors had a two-year 
fuel supply on hand. 
State even accepted the Indian 
argument that its reactor leaked 
heavy water at the rate of 10% a 
year, and that since the U.S. heavy 
water had been supplied more than 
_ 10 years ?ago it was not actually 
used. The 10% leakage is almost 
certainly a lie to begin with, but 
even if it were true it would not 
have exhausted the U.S. heavy wa-
ter?unless, as one witness put it, 
"the heavy water molecules in an 
Indian reactor do not follow the 
laws of physics but a caste system 
? under which only American-sup-
plied molecules are allowed to leak. 
The NRC has granted one of two 
pending licenses for exports to In- , 
dia, under State Department warn- , 
-iings that, as it and presumably the 
Indians read the treaty, interrupt-
in fuel supplies would be a U.S. vi-
olation freeing the Indians to use all 
the spent fual for bombs. Under 
pressure from the NRC and others. 
State hE agreed to approach the 
Indians about returning the spent 
fuel to the U.S. These negotiations 
ill probably be handled the way 
past ones have been. 
With leadership like this, little 
wonder the State Department has 
had little success in persuading the 
West Germans and French to limit 
their own nuclear sales. It will be 
quite a different matter if the new 
White House review comes 'up with 
a pkilicy concentrating on a few fun- . 
damentals: That the U:S. will con-
trol .any reprocessing of spent fuel ? 
from American-built reacthrs; that 
in any event reprocessing remains 
economically dubious at this stage; 
that the U.S. will not supply nuclear 
materials to any nation that holds. 
open the option of a weapons pro-
gram; that the first step in imple-
mentation must be following the 
Canadian example on India. 
*Making anti-proliferation policy 
truly effective will of course require 
.similar policies from other export-
ers. But such agreement will be far 
easier to achieve if the U.S. refuses 
to cop out, if it comes up with a se-
rious policy befitting a serious na-
tion. 
- ? ? 
' It is encouraging that public attention has 
begun to focus on the spiraling of American 
'arms sales abroad. Congress, for one, is 
watching this development like a hawk. But 
the fact remains that there is yet no serious ef-
fort within the government to look at what is 
being sold all over the world and to evolve a 
sensible policy for bringing arms sales under 
control. The new administration will have to 
give this matter the highest priority. 
'It should be no source of pride to the United 
States that it has become the largest arms 
seller in the world. Government-to-government 
-exports totaled about $1.5 billion annually a de-
cade ago; the level is now a staggering $9 bil-
lion to $10 billion a yeart?Moreover, the U.S. is 
no longer peddling hand-me-downs but the new-
est and highly advanced weapon systems, such 
' as supersonic planes, submarines, and antiship 
'missiles. 
Ironically, the United States may be defeat-
ing its own goal of enhancing security through-
-out the world. Not only does this massive out-
pouring of arms fuel possibilities for regional 
conflict. As military and diplomatic experts 
are beginning to realize, and with some alarm, 
it will become increasingly difficult for the 
U.S. ? or the Soviet Union ? to play the role of 
peacemaker. The ability of the superpowers to 
maintain world stability is thus being eroded. 
Iran is an illustration of .the dangers of un: - 
restrained arms selling. A just-released study 
by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
notes that the Iranians do not even have the 
skills to operate the sophisticated U.S. weap-
onry they now have and would be totally de-
pendent on U.S. personnel if they decided to go 
to war. By 1980, the report estimates, there 
could he as many as 50,000 Americans in Iran 
involved mostly in arms programs. 
It is doubly disturbing that there has been no 
close scrutiny of this program because of a se-
cret, decision by President Nixon in 1972 to sell 
Iran all the modern conventional arms it 
wanted. When one considers the volatility of 
the Kiddie East and the potential for wars and 
oil embargoes in the region, it is astonishing 
the U.S. has such an open-ended commitment. 
Other arms programs are equally question-
able. The Saudi Arabians are asking for as 
many as 2,000 Sidewinder interceptor missiles 
for their F-5s, when experts agree such a num-
ber is excessive for the country's defense. For-
tunately, as a result of public outcry, the ad-
ministration will probably scale down its arms 
request to Congress. ? 
Nor is the Persian Gulf the only turbulent 
area where arms are accumulating at fast 
rate. An arms race is under way in black Al-
i: rica, where the United States is eager to bol-
ster its allies and counter . the Soviet arms 
buildup in Somalia, Uganda, and Angola. And 
many "third-world" countries are acquiring 
submarines and missile-armed patrol boats 
that could be used to impede shipping. 
This is not to suggest a criticism of legiti-
mate arms programs. It makes sense for the 
U.S. to help friendly countries build up their 
forces so they can defend themselves. There 
is merit in fostering regional defense systems. 
Arms agreements often. serve valid security 
objectives ? perhaps they do in most cases. 
But to accept the present government view 
of "the more the better" (and the Pentagon, 
especially, argues that arms sales help the bal-
ance of trade and keep unit costs down) is to 
head down a potentially dangerous path. Some 
hard thought ought to be given to the nature Of 
the weapons supplied. Are the most lethal 
arms going to unreliable clients? To .what ex-
tent are they truly defensive? If they can be 
used As offensive weapons, what quantity can 
be justified as needed? 
Arms Are like shiny toys these days. Every-
one wants them. But, as the major supplier in 
the world, the United States ought to take the 
lead in showing that it daes not intend to turn 
the world into an arsenal of weapons that could 
have disastrous consequences.

Undiplomatic Furor in Belgrac1?
By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, July 
25---The case of a United States 
citizen who was jailed by Yugo-
slavia . for nearly, a year has 
drawn attention to divisions 
ong American policy-makers 
? - and especially to 
? Ambassador Lau-
News rence H. Silber-
Analysis man. By enunciat-
ing a viewpoint' 
? that has beer. 
growing among Americans, as 
Yugoslav policies have turned 
increasingly against the United 
States, the Ambassador has 
angered . both the authorities 
here and the Eastern European 
section of the State Depart-
ment. , 
Mr. Silberman's viewpoint' is 
that the anti-Americanism 
should be resisted. As a result, 
he appears to have annoyed 
Yugoslav Government and Com-
munist Party officials more 
than any other American. 
Belgrade officials have at-
tacked him particularly for the 
support he gave Laszlo Toth, 
the . Yugoslav-born American 
who was 'released here Friday 
after having been jailed on 
unconvincing. spy charges. By 
[vigorously supporting Mr. Toth, 
the Ambassador collided -direct-
ay with Yugoslavia's supreme 
leadership; its judicial system 
and its police establishment. 
, Mr. Silbermare a 40-year-old 
lawyer and fonner Assistant 
Attorney General, was appoint-

his Republican Party' connec-

Yugoslavia has had the biggest 
single injection of American 
capital in in its history. 
BuriVIr. Silberman has alsce 
striven to blunt Yugoslav dip-, 
lomatic offensives against the 
United States, and has resisted 
Yugoslavia pressures toward 
forcing American cooperation 
in areas that conflict with 
American. principles. 
The quarrel in the Toth case 
came :to public light in the 
Yugoslay. resort town of Bled 
on June 7, where ? Ambassador 
Silberman had- egreed to 'ad-

Belgrade had not heard such 
talk from an American Am-

reacted angrily. 
A protest was lodged with 
Washington that "undue pres-

Yugoslavia in .a most un-
diplomatic way. 
The Eastern Europe Desk of 
the State Department, to which 
Ambassador Silberman is tech-
nically responsible, evidently 
agreed. It recommended that

Some American officials,

have become increasingly dis-

We doubt if the issue is quite that

concerned in its own way about the 
fate of citizen Toth, and quiet diplo-

rocking the boat. Moreover, not 
even the U.S., which puts a higher 
premium on individual initiative 
than most nations, can afford to 
have individual ambassadors deter-

plomacy has its limits, boat rocking 
has its- advantages, and too often 
the State Department appears not 
to know the difference.

far Yugoslavia's own national inter-

the Russian orbit, though its repres-
sive internal policies are not all that 
dissimilar from Moscow's, at- least 
during those periodic crackdowns 
on critics and dissidents. But Amer-
ican sufferance has scarcely ad-
vanced U.S. foreign policy, since 
Belgrade has gone out of its way to

Text of Comments by U.S. Ambassador' 
Soedat to The New York Times 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, 
July 23?Following is the text 
of remarks made today by 
Laurence H. Silberman, Unit-
ed States Ambassador to 
Yugoslavia, on the release of 
Laszlo Toth, an American 
citizen who had been jailed 
in that country. The remarks 
were transcribed py The New 
? York Times. 
. He is no more a spy of 
any kind than my Aunt Ma-
tilda or my 10-year-old 
daughter. As far as I'm con-
cerned, I have always felt, 
and my conviction is doubled 
after talking with him, that 
he's as innocent as the driv-
en snow. 
. Now let me say a couple. 
? more things. 
.. As is no secret, I have had 
, my disputes with -the Eastern 
_ European Section of the State ? 
Department concerning this 
case. I have always felt?and 
incidentally after talking 
. with him feel it even mete 
, strongly?that the United 
NEW YORK TIMES 
1 AUG 1976 
States Government owes 
complete support to its citi-
zens in situations like this. 
I know the President and 
the Secretary feel ? the same 
way. 
Whe we get to the point' 
where we don't care about an 
American citizen innocently 
imprisoned, then . we're not 
much of a country any more. 
'Difficult to -Convince' 
It was, always difficult to 
get people in this country to 
understand why we cared so 
much about Laszlo Toth, Oft-
en I was asked, well, how 
can you care that much about 
this man? 
And I must say it was dif-
ficult:, sometimes, to convince 
the Eastern European Section 
of the State Department of 
the same thing. And it was; 
On occasion, -mentioned that 
. he was only a recent citizen. 
He only became a citizen in 
1973. ` ? . 
Well, to people who ask 
that question; I refer them ta 
Henry Grunwald's piece in? 
Time magazine on the Bicen-. 
tenniel,--on loving America. 
As far as rm concerned, the 
fact that he became a citizen 
in 1973, immigrated to the 
United States in 1967, doesn't 
make him one wit less pre-
cious than any other Amer-
ican. 
And after talking with him, 
I'm damn proud to be an 
American. ? 
Criticism of Envoy 
Now, I was criticized by 
the Eastern European Section 
for being too zealous in this 
case. It said I was undiplo-? 
matic for pressing the case 
as hard as I did. 
To these people diplomacy. 
apparently is the passive pur-
suit of American interest. 
And I. don't accept that. 
I was criticized for per- I 
mitting the press to have in; ' 
-formation on this case 'as' - 
per my discussions at your - 
[correspondents'] request last 
December. ' 
I was criticized for refer-
ring to it in a speech at Bled, 
in an address to the joint 
Yugoslav-American Chamber 
of Commerce?by our own I? 
people in the Eastern Euro- . 
pean Section of the State % 
Department. And as I've in-
dicated, the Eastern Euro-
pean Section asked that I be 
reprimanded for undiplomatic 
conduct, but the Secretary 
turned down that recommen-
dation and supported me. 
As far as I'm concerned 
the release of Toth by the 
Yugoslav Government is a 
recognition on their part that 
we do care deeply about the 
capricious imprisonment of 
an American. ? 
And I think . that's- all to 
the good, in terms of build-
ing and solidifying our rela-
tionship with Yugoslavia. 
They must understand 
what's in our vital interest. 
And the well-being of Ameri-:-
can. citizens is our vital in--
terest. ? I think they -.under-'. 
stand it now. . ? 
So I feel that with the re-
lease of Toth, the relation-
ships..with this countfy are 
better and, indeed,. I would 
say that the relationships 
with this country are based 
on certain fundamental, long-
term; common interests.

for comment. 
- The President's remarks were 
part of an interview he gave 
several days ago to the Yugo-

WASHINGTON, July 26 (AP) 
.?Special tests to detect genet-

State Department on employees 
i'returning from Moscow during 
the 1960s because of concern 
over possible effects of mi-
crowave radiation being 
beamed at ? the United States 
Embassy there, according to 
physicians familiar with the 
study. ? 
However, the purpose of the 
tests was kept secret from the 
employees, the medical sources

The State Department has 
denied that any U.S. cone 
sions were made in return for 
reducing of the radiation by th 
Soviet Union. "There is no ques 
tion of a concession," a depart-
ment spokesman, Robert Fun-

month.

Legislator claims U.S. spy posts 
in Britain steal co mercial secrets 
London (AP)?The U.S. Na-
tional Security Agency is steal-
ing British commercial secrets 
"on a colossal scale" by eaves-
dropping on corporate commu-
nications from bases in Britain, 
a left-wing lawmaker claimed 
yesterday. 
Tom Littericle who repre-
sents a district in the industrial 
city of Birmingham, said he 
will ask the foreign secretary, 
Anthony Crosland, to raise the 
matter urgently with the U.S. 
Secretary of State, Henry A. 
Kissinger. 
"They are using four British 
military installations, at Edzell 
in Scotland, Chicksands, Chel-
tenham and one in Hampshire 
to monitor the communications 
of British commercial organi-
zations," Mr. Litterick told re-
porters. 
He said he obtained his in-
formation "from a former em-
ployee of the NSA who, in the 
course of his duties, noticed 
that commercial information 
was being decoded and trans-
mitted to the United States and 
made available to American 
firms. 
. "This is nothing short of 
commercial espionage by an 
! BALTIMORE SUNTh 
! 1 August 1976  
American state agency using 
facilities provided by the Bri-
tish," Mr. Litterick charged. 
The ? lawmaker also raised 
the issue in the House of Com-
mons Monday, and Roy Hatter-
sley, minister of state in the 
Foreign Office, replied: 
"It is a long established 
practice of the House that the 
government does not comment 
on matters of this kind." 
A, spokeswoman at the 
American Embassy said it 
would have no comment on the 
Litterick claims. She said com-
ment should come from the De-
fense Department in Washing-
ton. 
- Mr. Litterick said U.S. 
eavesdropping "equipment is 
immense. Each one of these in-
stallations has a British com-
mander, but in each case ? the 
rank of the British commander 
is junior to that of the resident 
senior American officer. 
"Large British companies 
with subsidiaries abroad use 
radio communications to keep 
in touch," the lawmaker contin-
ued. "These communications 
are sent in code but the fellows

"The technical capabilities 
of the Americans are over-
whelmingly huge. There is no 
code that is safe from . the 
Americans?they can decode 
anything. 
"We know the Americans 
are ruthlessly capable Of filch-
ing any secret on behalf of 
American citizens," Mr. Litter-
ick said. "When it comes to 
money the Americans do not 
recognize anybody as their 
friends. 
!British technical skill and 
commercial knowledge and 
know-how," the lawmaker said, 
"are simply being filched and 
drained away for the benefit of 
American firms who are in 
competition with us." 
Mr. Litterick is one of the 
more outspoken members of 
the Labor party's left wing and 
has said on previous occasions 
that members of the U.S. Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency oper-
ate from the American Embas-
sy in London and should be ex-
pelled. 
A c nspiracy Hen s 
ag inst conef their IW 
The British, French, German, and 
, American Governments put up their 
several smokescreens in an attempt 
; to blur the meaning of Chancellor 
(Helmut! Schmidt's statement that 
they had agreed at the Puerto Rico 
' Summit to give no aid to Italy if a 
Communist joined the Italian Govern-
ment. Herr Schmidt?it was said var-
iously in London, Paris, and Bonn?
had been misquoted. Or he had been 
misunderstood. Or he had been wrong 
: to say that the Italian issue was the 
most important one discussed at 
Puerto Rico. Or nothing important 
had happened beyond a chat about aid 
. to Italy between four old friends. 
What emerges from the fog is a 
pair of rather unseemly facts. The 
?first is that Presidents Ford and Gis-
card d'Estaing, Chancellor Schmidt, 
and Mr. Callaghan did indeed discuss 
-Italy's future privately and without 
' telling the Italian Government what 
they were doing. The second is that 
,Herr Schmidt said, correctly or other-
wise, in Washington that they had 
agreed to deny aid to Italy if the new 
Italian Government included a Com-
munist. Italy is an ally to all of them 
and to three of them an EEC partner. 
They ought not to have discussed Ita-
ly behind Italy's back. 
Nor should they have preset the 
sort of terms?if that is what they did 
?that Herr Schmidt was talking ' 
about. Italy is a democratic country 
which has just elected a new parlia-
ment. The complexion of the new 
Italian government is a matter for 
the Italians. The gist of Herr 
Schmidt's message to Signor Andreot-
ti was that his cabinet must not in-
clude ministers who do not enjoy the 
confidence of the British, French, 
German and American Governments. 
This amounts to blatant interior-
)- ence in the domestic affairs of anoth-
er democracy, and Signor Berlingeur, 
' the Italian Communist leader, was

On Loans to Italians 
, 
WASHINGTON, 'Aug. 4 (Reu-
ters)?The United States con-
sulted its European allies about 
cutting off economic aid to 
Italy if Communists were ad-
mitted to the Italian Cabinet, 
It was disclosed in a White 
' House letter released today. 
The letter said United Staten 
officials had discussed the mat-
ter with French, West German 
and British officials at the eco-
nomic conference in June in 
Puerto Rico, but reached no 
agreement. 
It was the first time the 
White House admitted publicly 
that it had discussed withhold-
ing aid toa n Italian Govern-
anent that included Commu-
nists. The government later 
formed by the newly elected 
Christian Democrats did not in-
clude Communists. 
The letter was written by 
tient. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, 
head of the National Security 
Council, to the House Interna-
tional Relations Committee. 
He sent the letter in reponse 
to a resolution being considered 
by the panel, urging the White 
House to turn over material 
? about an alleged agreement to 
refuse loans to an Italian gov-
ernment that included Commu-
nists. 
. General Scowcroft's letter 
timid in part: 
"Contrary to the impression 
conveyed by some press re-
ports, there was no agreement 
entered into by the United 
States with France, West Ger-
many and Great Britain, or any 
other country on the question 
of assistance to Italy if the 
communists entered the Italian 
Government, although the 
general issue was discussed at 
'the- economic summit meeting 
In Puerto Rico in June." ? 
quite right to say so. He could also 
have said that at least two of the four 
governments involved are happy 
enough to grant large sums in aid or 
cheap credits to countries whose cabi-
nets are wholly Communist. Britian 
. has given the Soviet Union a credit 
line of 950 millions. West Germany 
has offered even larger credits to 
countries in the Eastern bloc and to 
Yugoslavia. Why should Italian Com-
munists be less deserving of aid than 
Russian ones? 
, In cynical terms, of course, the *1 
cases are not the same. There is no 
way in which the West can use money 
to influence the composition of the , 
Soviet Government. So there is no 
point in inhibiting trade by withhold-

Ing credits. In Italy, on the other 
:hand, the richer Western govern-
ments are in a position to push a poor-
' er one around. 
What Mr. Callaghan, President 
+ Ford, President Giscard d'Estaing, 
? and Chancellor Schmidt seem to have 
forgotten is that Signor Andreotti is 
supposed to be one of their own com-
pany, a brother, a fellow-democrat, 
and entitled to be consulted. For the

tivities have already alarmed the

Charter. All peoples, the charter says, 
have the right to choose their own 
governments. 
The above is reprinted from the 
? Manchester Guardian Weekly. 
No help for the suspect 
Giulio Andreotti may wish Helmut Schmidt hadn't said it out 
loud, but it suits his purposes fine 
The well practised vocal cords of Helmut Schmidt 
?were for once being used to no purpose when the 
West German chancellor loudly revealed last weekend 
that Italy's friends would be reluctant to give economic 
help to an Italian government with Mr Berlinguer's 
Communists in it: for the simiile reason that no such 
government is in prospect at the moment. 
Mr Andreotti, for the Christian Democrats, is work-
ing to construct a government without the Communists. 
The Socialists, whose agreement the Christian Demo-
Fats will need, have just had a ?palace revolution 
which puts them under the leadership of a man who 
will probably give that agreement. The Communists - 
themselves seem resigned to not being in the govern-
ment this year, and perhaps not in the lifetime of the 
parliament elected last month. The chief remaining 
question is the terms on which the Christian Democrats 
and their allies Can buy the relatively loyal opposition 
of the Communists, and wage restraint by the 
Communist-led trade unions. 
Few countries can nowadays sail through life without 
some degree of external influence on their affairs. To 
be a member of the European community, or of the 
Nato alliance, or of the International Monetary Fund 
when you need international cash, is to recognise the 
limitations the real world imposes on that perfect 
sovereignty of the theory. books. So the outrage of 
some west Europeans about Mr Schmidt's remarks 
has been humbug. The governments of Italy's main 
western friends have decided, on two very practical 
grounds, that they would prefer not to see the Italian 
Communist party come into the government just yet. 
First, the policies the Communists advocated in last 
month's election were so deliberately moderate that it 
will be hard for Mr Berlinguer to threaten to oppose 
the Christian Democrats root and branch. If the 
Christian Democrats offer something tangible in return 
for wage restraint by the unions?one idea is a freeze 
on salaries over 8m lire a year (a bit over. ?5000), 
which implies a substantial redistribution of incomes?
the Communists are unlikely to come out into . the 
streets against it. The whole recent strategy of the 
Communists has been to persuade the nervous centre 
of Italian politics that it has nothing to fear from 
them. They destroy their own strategy if they now 
swing over to a policy of ay-out opposition, including 
economy-busting strikes. 
- The distance they have to go 
Second, the aim of trying to exclude the Communists 
from Italy's next government is to give the social 
democrats among them more time to trim down the 
party's Leninist element: 'The nettle of the Italian 
Communists will, it is true, have to be grasped some 
time. The decisive test of a democracy is the ability 
to transfer power from one major party tq another, 
'[aid Italy will not have passed that test so long as 
its biggest opposition party is considered outside the ; 
government-forming pale. But for all Mr Berlinguer's 
professions of belief in democracy, his Communists are 
still two parties in one, a large outer layer of people, 
who *are really social democrats wrapped around a 
hard core of still unconverted Leninist authoritarians. 
They will be safer for democracy when they reduce 
that hard core still further, or spit it out. 
Italy's Communists claim to have abandoned the 
dictatorship of the proletariat, that code-phrase for 
the one-party system of the orthodox communist state. 
But they still believe in the ".hegemony of the working ? 
class," 'which could be a back door to something not 
very different from the dictatorship of the proletariat. ' 
They still practise democratic centralism, the system 
of tight internal discipline which, in most other boin-
munist parties, goes with a denial of multi-party 
pluralism. They maintain a series of institutional links 
with the Soviet world that consorts oddly with the 
assertion that they belong, in their hearts, to the 
pluralist world. One more parliament's life spent in 
critical but not destructive opposition'would help the 
I; evolution of Italy's Communists. They might by then 
have .become the reliable partner -in the democratic 
system which Mr Berlinguer already claims them to be.

A secret ? decision by President

In case of war during that 5- to 10- 
year period, there is general agree-
ment among U.S. personnel involved 
with the Iranian program that "U.S. 
support on a day-to-day basis" would 
be essential for operation of the so-

sell Iran the most modern U.S. air-
craft "and in general to let Iran buy 
e anything it wanted" effectively pre-
empted State and Defense Depart-
ment review of the sales to that coun-
- try: The study said this continued to 
be so even after a quadrupling -of 
Iran's oil revenues in 1973 created a 
"honeypot" of weapons sales. 
The result was "a bonanza" for U.S. 
? 
weapons makers, fierce interservice 
?, 
competition for orders, and sales to-
taling $10.4 billion over the past five 
? years, according to the report. 
U.S. arms sales to Iran are the larg-
est of any country both in dollar vol-

volved in implementation abroad. 
Nixon's decision to sell Iran virtu-

wanted was "unprecedented for a non-

- not preceded by the major inter-
, agency review that would be expected

? the report said. 
A committee source said the deci-
c sion was later transmitted in writing 
e to the State and Defense departments 
by Henry A. Kissinger, then White 
; House assistant for national security. 
"It caught the bureaucracy completely 
1. by surprise" but was never seriously 
'challenged because of its authorita-
t,tive nature, and it remains in force to-
day, the source said. 
Nixon's decision was not publicly

' 
D RESIDENT NIXON'S DECISION to arm Iran was 
characteristic of much of his diplomacy. It was se-
cretive. Its dismaying applications were never debated 
within the administration, let alone in public. It has 
now left the Country with an implicit commitment that 
Americans cannot accept?and yet cannot easily reject 
Condemning this kind of high-handed and irresponsi-
ble statecraft is simple enough. But working out a rem-
edy is going to be as difficult as it is urgent 
The dimensions of this dilemma are becoming pain-
fulli? clear. Iran is now this country's biggest customer 
for arms, buying inordinate amounts of the most ad-
vanced and complex weaponry. Iran, as a nation and a 
people, does not have the technological base for this 
kind,, of an armory. Keeping it in operation requires 
? Americans, in large and conspicuous numbers, on the 
airfield and in the maintenance shops. 
If the Shah were to use this equipment in war, the 
United States would be faced with a fearful choice. To 
leave the American technicians and experts in place 
would make this country an active participant in the 
Shah's purposes. But suddenly to withdraw technical 
support and resupply would risk the destruction of all 
US, relations with Iran with obvious consequences for 
the flow of Persian Gulf oil on which this country is in- ? 
creasingly dependent . . 
The time to consider this unpleasant prospect is be-
fore, not after, the Shah begins to use this expensive 
equipment that the United States has sold him. But. 
there is no indication that the Ford administration has 
-thought about it much, or has any policy at all. Perhaps 
the peocess of looking for an answer will be accelerated 
by the publication last Monday of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee's staff report on the military sales 
? to Iran. The rising danger to American interests has 
been apparent, in general terms, for some time. But 
this report lays out the case with a wealth of detail dif-
ficult to ignore. ? 
An example: The report notes that this country has 
sold Iran weapons that include the new F-14 Tomcat 
fighter and the Spruance class destroyer. "The F-14 sys-
tem is so complicated that the United Stet 
having major chitiPerSivikihSf tRifiteln 
' 
Spruance class destroyer will be even more sophisti-
cated than those being procured by the U.S. Navy," this 
report observes. It then adds: "There is general agree-
ment among U.S. personnel involved with the Iranian 
program that it is unlikely that Iran could go to 'war in 
the next five to 10 years with its current and prospec-
tive inventory ... without US. support on a day-to-day 
basis." Can Iran count on that support? The Shah is en-
titled to an answer. So are American voters. 
After a venture in personal diplomacy. in Teheran in 
early 1972, Mr. Nixon told his subordinates that the 
Shah was to be permitted to buy virtually any weapon 
short of nuclear, Warheads. >Because of the sweeping 
and explicit nature of this order, all of the normal proc-

Time for nw Americ 
- By Edwin 0. Reischauer 
n olicy on Kore 
Today marks the 23rd anniversary of the end 
of the Korean war., but the Korean peninsula is 
still one of the powder keg areas of the world, 
with the United States sitting on top of the keg. 
? North and South Korea, each big enough to: 
rank v as a middle-sized country of the World, 
are squared off against each tither in bitter 
.hostility. They are armed to the teeth, with 
about a million men together under arms and,- 
another 2 million as trained reserves. Shooting 
? incidents occur from time to time along the ? 
border, and not far away is stationed an Amer-
ican division, so placed as inevitably to involve - 
the United States, should war break out again. 
Around Korea are grouped in close proxi- ? 
mity three other of the largest nations in the. 
world.? China, the Soviet Union, and Japan ? 
.all;of which have fought over Korea in the past'
v 
? - and distrust one another today. The situation is 
.not reassuring. It is high time to take stock of , 
vtiat has happened in Korea and what its' fa- v: 
ture:.may 'hold in store for the U.S. and for the 
wild. ? 
First, however, 'America should get rid of 
some mistaken notions. South Korea is no,l 
South Vietnam. Its people are solidly? unified 
? against the Communist North, still remember-
ing its ruthlessness and cruelty when it over-
ra inost of the South during the Korean war. 
They have a larger military establishment than 
thg 'North and are in the process of gaining 
equality in the air, their one area of relative:. 
. weakness. They have twice the population of 
the North and a more vigorous economy. South ? 
Kprea most certainly Will not crumple, no mat-
ter iiciw hard the North Korean dictator, Kim' 
? IlAttng, may huff and puff. 
.,ALso, neither of the two Koreas is much like , 
first other developing countries. They share - 
many of the characteristics that account for 4 
the, ,extraordinary, though contrasting, sue- ? 
ces,ses. of Japan and China in recent years. 
Tier people are hard-working, disciplined, and 
skilled organizers. They have a passion for: 
education and have all but wiped out illiteracy. v 
Arith these traits the North has made itself 
hito ;the most tightly and repressively orga-
nized of all the communist states. The South : 
has followed the trail blazed by Japan as an in 
dustrial fast-grower, although, starting later 
than Japan and from lower levels of tech:. 
nological modernization, its success is less as-', 
suked, particularly in the face of the recent 
vast rise in prices for the energy resources 
f- and raw materials that both must import. - 
:v. The South's attempt to follow the open pat- ? 
t tern of democratic politics and freedom of ex- ? 
pressior that has worked so well in Japan has i 
met with even less success. The movement in ? 
recent years has been away- from these free-
doms toward growing repression and authox(-
itarian controls. V? ? 
South Korea nonetheless has sufficiently 
high educational and economic levels to make . 
a free society and democratic political in-
stitutions workable or, if these are not 
achieved, to operate a reasonably efficient 
, even if cruel dictatorship of the right. 
?. The immediate problem in Korea is not Its 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08 
backwardness or the danger that the South 
might disintegrate. The problem for the United 
. States is the embarrassment of having served 
as godfather to a rightist dictatorship 'and 
being committed to its defense, even though 
t the American people obviously would repudiate 
this commitment if war : actually broke out. 
This is a very, dangerous situation to be in. 
To South Koreans the past 31 years since 
World War U have been their American pc-
nod, now comparable in length to the preced-
ing Japanese period of 35 years of colonial 
rule, when-Japan blighted Korean national as-
pirations and bred a lasting hatred for Japan, 
but at the- same time did lay_ the foundation 
and give specific shape to much of Korea's 
modern development. The Japanese also 
molded Korea to the pattern-they willed for it. 
In contrast, the United States has advocated 
one thing for Korea and produced another.' 
Much in modern Korean society has been in- ? 
fluenced by the U.S., and some of this the 
I: American people can take pride in. It was 
v? Christians, largely the converts of American 
missionaries, who once stood out as champions , 
of independence against the Japanese, just. as. v - 
they are today the most fearless advocates of 
democracy and freedom of speech against na-
tive military rule. 
Other borrowings from the United States, 
however, have been less desirable. The arm of 
government most repressive of the freedoms 
of Koreans both at home and abroad is the Ko-
rean Central Intelligence Agency, named for 
its American counterpart. Generous American' 
aid has bred widespread corruption. And in any 
?ncase the present dictatorial Korean Govern-
ment is not at all what any American would 
wish to see in Korea. 
The spotty American record is the product 
of both inattention and a desirable modesty in 
American aims. The U.S. does not feel that it 
should try to mastermind the future for any 
other people. It is ready to aid but not to dic-
tate. Unfortunately this half-way position 
breeds confusion. U.S. aid often seems to 0th-
em like Control. Korean liberals are dispirited. 
to see the United States increasing its military 
support of a regime that has destroyed their' 
freedoms and the beginnings of Korean democ-
racy: 
, Vlihat should the U.S. do now to correct this 
situation and reduce the dangers to itself and 
the world? Clearly the first step is to withdraw 
its troops and its nuclear weapons from South 
Korea. If it does not do this it will be contin-
uing to give unconditional support to a regime 
that it does not believe in and will remain in 
danger of becoming embroiled, in a war there 
against the. wishes of the American people and 
the best judgment of their government. 
The U.S. withdrawal, however, must be ac-
complished in such a way as not to increase 
the chances of w 1r in Korea. It doe not want 
a repetition of 1950, when an American pullout 
helped spark the invasion from the North. The 
withdrawal should be gradual and clearly an-
nounced in advance, so no shocks occur. The 
present commitment to South Korea's defense 
' 
: CIA-RDM7-00432R000100390004-1 
,--Appmveci For Releksg,..20,0119,8/08,: cIA7RpID.77,-09,p2R00010039a004-1 
should be replaced by a more general corn-: 
-mitrnent to the peace of the. area. 
The same 'sort of commitment should apply 
- to Taiwan when the United States evehtually 
does recognize Peking and consequently must 
. give up its specific defense treaty with the Na-
tionalist regime. China has clearly indicated 
that it is not considering military action to re-
gain Taiwan at this time, and neither it nor the ? 
Soviet Union has the least desire to go to war 
over Korea. 
The possibility, however vague, of American 
- military reprisal would be a- further deterrent 
to Chinese or Soviet military action, and North ,1 
Korea would not on its own embark on a mili-
tary adventure against a larger and probably 
. stronger South, especially if there is even a ? 
small possibility of an American military re-
sponse. 
? The U.S. withdrawal from Korea also should: 
be accompanied by other more positive moves. 
R is the close involvement of China, the Soviet 
Union, Japan, and the United States. in Korea. 
that makes it a 'much greater danger to world 
peace than are even less stable areas in South-
east Asia or the other developing regions of the 
? world. The U.S. should take advantage of its 
withdrawal to work for a four-power agree-
ment on the neutralization'of Korea from other" 
,world tensions, leaving the two ? Korean re-
gimes to work on their problem of unification - 
without fear of external pressures. . ? 
Since the American defense position in , 
Korea often has been described as being basi-
-cally in behalf of its Japanese. ally, withdrawal 
from Korea also should be accompanied by 
clear reaffirmations of its commitment to Ja-
pan's defense and cooperation with Japan in all 
fields - a position that spokesmen of both the 
political parties in the U.S. have recently made. 
clear is an accepted, supra-partisan American 
_stand. 
Finally, the withdrawal would permit the 
U.S. to be more selective in its cooperation 
with, and aid to, South Korea, so that Amer-
ican influence would be more likely to favor 
-..the development of the sort of free and domes-
tic society that most South Koreans hope for 
- and that Americans believe would best contrih- ; 
? ute to a healthy and stable Korea.

today that money from the Mainichi's sources said

? 370,000 amounts, to Kodama.

,?16 persons arrested earlier. 
'Lockheed Corp. apparently 
'was used to finance the Jap-
anese parliamentary elec-
tions of December 1972. 
The allegation came two 
. days after the unexpected 
arrest of former Prime Min-
ister Kakuei Tanaka on 
'charges arising out of the 
Lockheed scandal here. ? 
' Mainichi said money from 
Lockheed was delivered per-. 
sonally by John W. Clutter, 
resident of Lockheed Asia 
Ltd., to power-broker Yoshio 
Kodarna in several install-
ments and usually at the lat. 
...ter's request. Kodama has - 
-been identified in U.S. con- . 
? gressional testimony, as the. 
recipient of $7 million in 
Lockheed funds: 
, The newspaper said "the-
Tokyo district prosecutor's 
office is fairly certain that 
the former prime minister 
, received money not only 
through the Marubenl Corp. 
[Lockheed's agent] but also 
from power-broker Yoshio 
? Kodama." 
? Kodama, reportedly still 
t recovering from a stroke 
suffered at the beginning of 
the Lockheed investigation,. 
Is refusing to answer ques-
tions related to this matter.:

The paper alleges that 
Taro Fukuda, translator and 
go-between to Lockheed and 
Kodama, told prosecutors 
before his death, that hp ac-
, 
"It is not known whether 
Kodama actually delivered? 
the money to Tanaka, llut 
inasmuch as the period in 
question was directly prior-
to the December 1972 lower 
house elections, there isathe 
distinct possibility that at 
least some of the money 
went to finance the election 
costs of Japanese politi-
cians," the paper said. 
A. Carl Kotchian, former. 
vice chairman of Lockheed, 
told a? U.S. Senate commit-
-tee in February that during 
the latter part of 1972 espe-
cially large sums of Money 
moved frequently to Japan. ' 
Kotchian said that in Octo-
ber 1972 Lockheed sent $1.3 
million and in November $2 - 
million to Japan. 
? The second half of /972 , 
was an important period for 
Lockheed. In September, Ja-

chase six Lockheed Tristars. 
In October, the National De- .

, Police are disturbed that the meth-
ods of bribery are becoming harder 
" to uncover: For this .reason officials 
suspect the totals are only Tartial. 
? In an effort to root out corruption, re-
gional police bureaus are being asked 
-- to probe thoroughly the activities of 
all local government officials. One of 
.the most common methods of giving 
bribes is to list the wife or mistress 
of the government official on the pay- . 
roll company giving the bribe. An- - 
other is for the briber to invest in a ' 
firm operated by a relative or person . 
closely connected with the official, or

Airlines as the nation's number one. 
In an attempt to win parliamentary 
approval for planned, expansion both 
on domestic and international routes, 
ANA issued free tickets to politicians, 
along with cash during the traditional" 
midsummer and year-end gift giving. 
Transport Ministry officials alleged-
ly were offered a.range of gifts from 
expense-paid golf excursions to boxes 
of candy for their children. Ranguetg 
at the best restaurants and drinking 
parties in expensive Ginza bars also . 
were used to influence officials, ac-
cording to government prosecutors. 
Officials would run up large bar bills 
that would be paid later by ANA. 
NEW YORK TIMES -

Shockwavesi 
,n,Japan 
.  
The arrest of Japan's former Prime Minister, Kakuei 
? Tanaka, is the most dramatic indication yet of the 
? heights to which the rot of corporate bribery may have 
-spread in world trade. No wonder the ruling Liberal 
Democrats of Japan were so nervous about the unfolding 
:disclosures of Lockheed Aircraft's multimillion-dollar ci 
payoffs, a nervousness shared by United States Govern-
? ment' investigators who presumably were aware of a - 
possible Tanaka link to-the web of corruption.. 
The internal POlitical struggle in Japan, less than five: 
months away from an election, is bound to be inflamed 
by this development-though the impact could go either 
way. It was a Liberal Democratic Government that pur-
sued the Lockheed investigation to Mr. Tanaka's front 
door yesterday morning. The former leader, moreover, 
had headed an oppositicn group inside the. party 'to. -; 
challenge' Prime Minister M,iki's lackluster leadership. In 
- a stroke, a possibly formidable opponent would seem to 
have been neutralized, though the cynicism in Japan :1 
runs so deep that already there are charges that Mr. 
:'Tanaka has simply been set up by his party rivals as a 
politically convenient scapegoat. - 
The immediate lesson to be drawn is' similar to that ." 
of the American Watergate experience: The political 
system has not been so hopelessly corrupted that official ? 
wrongdoing?if that is what 'Oc6urred?can be Indefi-
nitely covered up. And considering the frailty of. democ-
racy in - Japan, the Mild Government, whatever- its ' - 
immediate motives, has to be commended .for. Its bold... 
action. 
- 
The Tanaka arrest also has meaning for this country, 
, a timely counterbalance to a disturbing attitude that has 3 
been making inroads in government and business circles; 
?the belief that bribery and shady payoffs are such an -4 
entrenched part of international commerce that only the 
naive expect any real imprtivement in corporate ethics. 
This attitude was epitomized in the degrading statement 
by the head of a leading managerial consultants firm, as 
quoted recently in The Wall Street Journal; the current 
anti-bribery drive in Congress and elsewhere, he report-
edly stated, Is nothing but "a bunch of pipsqueak 
moralists running around trying to apply U.S. puritanical 
standards to other countries." .4 
Fortunately, for themselves and the nation as a whole, ? 
many of the most influential business executives do not *4 
share this contemptuous view. In Japan as as the 
United States, enforcement of allegedly "puritanical" 
standards makes ultimately for decent business and 
politiCal relationships alike. p " ,

Efforts to L.?over the extent of the. 
corruption in Japanese national life 
have been hampered by revelations 
that even public prosecutors and po-

gifts from gangsters, and dozens of 
police of various ranks are under

golf club operated by Eitaro Itoyama, 
a politician the office was investigat- ? 
ing for election law violations.

have become so common that Japanese . 
charged with minor infringements of 
the law are demanding to be let off, 
in effect telling police: "Put your own 
house in order before you start pick-
ing on us." 
Declaring that Japan's- era of high 
economic growth has led to the un-
healthy development of "money pow-
er," a newspaper editorial recently 
commented: "Monetary gifts, treating 
for drinks and meals, invitations to 
pleasure trips and golf, are all easily 
included in the business round and 
they have become to be regarded as 
. common social customs. ,

August 1976 
Kremlin strategists have converted Cuba into 
an increasingly potent launching pad for anti-Western 
subversion throughout the world 
THE MOSCOW-HAVANA 
CONNECTION 
By Moons R. Limn ' 
' 
YEAR AGO, cooing sounds of 
A Tapprochement with Cuba 
?were heard. U.S. Senators 
and journalists had flocked to Ha-
vana and returned with glowing 
reports of a new moderation. With?  ' 
American concurrence, the Organi-
zation of American States' a r-year-
? old trade and diplomatic embargo, 
imposed in retaliation for Castro 
subversion, was quietly ended. It 
seemed likely that Washington and 
Havana would soon resume the dip-
lomatic relations broken in 196r. 
Then, beginning last August, 
14,000 Cuban combat troops, utiliz-
ing the latest weaponry, invaded 
Angola to crush the non-communist 
opposition and install a Marxist 
?. regime. The military power of the 
' Soviet Union?combined with a 
1 growing neo-isolationist attitude in 
1 
Congress?had emboldened Krem-
a? lin leaders to throw down a chal-
lenge beyond daring a few years ago. 
Nothing reveals this new aggres-
siveness like the Moscow-Havana 
connection. In brazen defiance of the 
Monroe Doctrine, the Soviets have 
converted Cuba into a military base 
and springboard for anti-Western 
subversion and strategic thrusts 
all over-the globe. Some examples: 
? Last spring, Soviet transports 
ferried 650 Cuban troops, pilots and 
technicians into the giant Soviet 
military complex at Berbera, Soma-
lia, where they work with z5oo Rus-
? sian troops. Cubans fly jet fighters, 
man missiles and coach guerrilla 
movements in Yemen and Somalia, 
_ preparing "wars of liberation" 
. against Ethiopia, Djibouti and 
' Oman at the Red Sea and Persian 
Gulf entrances?oil lifelines for West 
Europe and Japan. 
0 Thirty members of the Cuban 
secret police?Direccion Gcneral 
de Inieligencia (DGO ?who were 
:rained in the Soviet Union, staff a - 
Havana institute that prepares Eng-
lish-speaking Cubans for infiltration 
into the United States as illegal espi-
onage and terrorist agents. 
1 
_ 
? The Cuban government main-
tains a Havana headquarters for a 
minuscule Marxist-Leninist party 
that encourages Puerto Rican vio-
lence. The Soviet and Cuban delega-
tions have pushed a United Nations 
resolution endorsing independence 
for this island commonwealth, 
where only .6 percent favored inde-
pendence in a 1967 referendum. 
This U.N. charade has a single pur-
pose: to incite and support the Cu-
ban-trained terrorists whose bombs 
have rocked Washington, New York 
and Chicago. _ 
* In Havana, Manuel Piiieiro 
"Redbeard" Losada, chief of the 
Soviet-backed "Department of 
America," oversees some 400 agents 
in stirring up trouble throughout the 
hemisphere. Twice in the last three 
years Cuban-trained exiles have 
landed secretly in the Dominican 
Republic in abortive efforts to or-
ganize guerrilla violence. 
To? understand the dynamics of 
the Moscow-Havana relationihip, 
examine its evolution over the past 
decade. In 1967, Castro. sustained a 
desolate defeat of his grand strategy -I 
of violent revolution when Ernesto 
"Che" Gi!evara failed in Bolivia 
to show that Cuba could create ; 
"many Vietnams" in South America. - 
Castro's incendiarism was so coun-
terproductive, and his own economic 
mess such a mounting $500 million-
a-year burden to the Soviets, that 
they decided to tether him. Oil de-
liveries to Cuba mysteriously began 
? to fall behind_ Sugar mills, factories, 
highway traffic sputtered. "We have 
trouble on the docks in Baku," Mos-
cow explained. By mid-/968, Castro 
capitulated. He placed the DCI under 
a Soviet KGB general, who sits in an 
office next to the DM chief in Ha-
vana. The general and his KGB sub-
ordinates approve the operational 
plans of all DCI divisions. Other KG3 
officers, sons of Spanish communists 
; who fled to the Soviet Union after 
the Spanish Civil War, have become 
"Cubans" in the DC/. 
The Soviets also imposed a "de-
ridelization" of the Cuban govertv! ? 
ment and economy. Today, j000. 
Russians sit in Cuban ministries.and 
enterprises. The Cuban communist 
party has been remade in the Soviet 
image with a constitution modeled 
on the Soviet Union's 1936 Stalinist 
charter. 
. Castro's abject surrender. was 
revealed at last year's Havana con-
- ference of 2.4 Latin American corn-
numist parties. Henceforth, the 
Castroites announced, all Cuban 
help would be given only through 
the Moscow-approved parties. Rev-
olutionaries must discipline than- ' 
selves, form a united front, abandon 
free-lance activity and resort', to 
violence only under tutelage of the 
local Kremlin subsidiary. 
Soviet control of the Cuban opera-
tions is virtually complete. In Cuba 
itself, Czech and Soviet instructors 
assist Castro's terrorists. Cuban ex-
perts joined the Palestinian training 
camps ia Syria, tutoring terrorists 
from Japan, Germany and Iran as - 
well as Arabs. The graduates depart 
to wreak glnbal havoc. 
Middle East. For months, Cuban-
supported terrorists in Iran have ? 
'waged a war of assassination -and 
kidnapping. One killed in a shoot-
out last May was found to have been 
trained in Cuba itself. Victims in- . 
elude Iranians and three U.S. Army 
officers in Tehran. In February, 
during his visit to Moscow, Castro 
promised support to exiled leaders 
of the Ianian communist party. 
They are now coordinating Cuban-
trained insurgents fighting Iranian 
forces in Oman. 
Lath America. In 197o, two Cas-
? tro-schooled terrorists proclaimed a 
"People's Revolutionary Army" in 
Argentina to bring down the gov-
ernment. More recently, other 
Argentines have taken terrorist in- ? 
struction inside Russia -itself. They 
have waged a murder-and-kidnap 
campaign against police, the mili-
tary, and Argentine- and foreign-
owned businesses. Corporate giants 
have been forced to pay upward of

Angola. In January 1975, the Por-
tuguese government and the three 
Angolan liberation groups agreed on 
a- peaceful transition to independ-
ence. By March, the Moscow-
spawned Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola (manA) was 
receiving huge supplies of Soviet 
arms.* By April, Cuban advisers 
- were in Luanda instructing MPLA 
,e-treops. By May, a high-ranking Red 
la-Army delegation had. arrived in 
--Havana to arrange the massive dis.: 
patch of Cuban combat troops to 
Angolaaa _ 
Those troops began arriving in 
' August Their mission: to operate 
the sophisticated Soviet weaponry 
for MPLA attack columns and to con-
trol newly conquered areas while the 
thinly stretched MPLA. forces finished 
their sweep. By early December, 
5000 Cubans were engaged in com-
bat; behind the lines the Soviets had 
an estimated aroo advisers.. 
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger publicly warned 
the Soviets that they were risking 
&tente by their blatant intervention. 
For two weeks, the Kremlin and 
Havana appeared to hesitate, but 
DGI'S intelligence analysts advised 
Castro and Moscow that the United 
States, traumatized by the South-
east Asia collapse and Watergate, 
would be unable to respond. 
It proved prophetic advice. On 
December 19, the U.S. Senate, by a 
54-22 vote, amended a foreign-aid 
bill to forbid any spending for ciA 
aid to Angola. 
. Six days later, on December 25, 
the Soviet airlift resumed. Within a 
month, the Cuban troop strength 
zoomed to 12,000. In January, the 
anti-Marxist forces still controlled

about 70 percent of Angola's terri-
tory and population. But. within 
weeks, Angola had fallen to the 
communists. In February, when 
Castro addressed the 25th SoViet 
Communist Party Congress in Mos-
cow, he and the assembled comrades 
were triurnphant. , 
What Next? This kind of Marxist - 
intoxication in the Kremlin ? poses 
the greatest danger to world peace. 
The very day the US. Senate passed 
its no-aid-to-Angola amendment, 
top Soviet strategist Mikhail Suslov 
uttered this portentous threat at the 
Communist Party Congress in Ha-
vana: "The revolutionary-liberation 
movement, now aa never before, is 
, linked into a unified global whole. 
The Cuban revolution has placed an 
indelible imprint on the develop-
ment of the whole liberation process 
id Latin America. Prospects for the 
second liberation of the continent 
. are becoming increasingly real." 
Coming fl-cm a man who pro-
aimed. the "liberation" of Budapest, 
Prague and Saigon, these are dan-
gerous words which require irr_unc-
diate and long-term U.S. responses: 
1. We must stop the destructive 
assaults on our intelligence agencies, 
which alone can provide the detailed 
evidence of Russian and Cuban ter-
rorist assaults against the United 
States, its allies and neutral states. 
These attacks have vastly hampered 
the collection and analysis of intelli-
gence on Soviet-Cuban intervention 
, in Angola and KGB-Dm-orchestrated 
terrorist campaigns against the Unit-
ed States and other nations. 
2. We must reinstitute the eco-
nomic and political embargo against 
Cuba. Such sanctions will not topple 
the totalitarian regime, but they will 
diminish Castro's capacity for mis-
chief, terror, subversion and armed 
aggression. And the sanctions must 
be supported by all our allies, includ-
ing NATO nations and Japan. They 
are all now targets of the terroristic 
regime they are helping to strength-
en Via trade. Trade should promote 
peace?not aggression. 
For the eune reasons, we should 
not hesitate to use economic sanc-
tions against the Kremlin's aggres-
sions. Even as the Angolan invasion 
mounted, U.S. representatives in 
Moscow continued to negotiate a 
pact, announced October 20, under 
which the Soviets are buying mil-
lions of tons of American grain to 
support their faltering collectivized 
agriculture. The pact also envisioned 
our supplying the Russians with 
much-needed American oil-well 
technology that will boost their pro-
duction within 18 months by 700,000 
barrels daily. 
3. We must arrive at a _national 
resolve to counter the Kremlin's poli-
tical warfare and Cuban aggressions. 
The Cuban invasion of Angola oc-
curred only because of the corn-
munist conviction that the United 
States was in such internal disarray 
that it lacked the will to resist. 
We desperately need a Congress 
and a White House that are united ' 
in this resolve. Says Brookings In-. 
stitution defense analyst Barry 
Blechman: "Only by demonstrating 
a willingness to make major issues 
? of single events which, in isolation, 
sometimes appear relatively insignif-
? icant can the United States bring the 
Soviet Union to understand that the 
' process of normalizing our mutual 
relations requires concessions on 
both sides." 
4. We must convince the Krem-
lin that we recognize dearly that 
they are ultimately responsible for 
Cuban depredations. 
Our entire relationship with the 
, Soviet Union, including trade and 
the strategic-arms-limitation nego-
tiations, is at stake and must be care-
fully and realistically reappraised. - 
? We must stop passively swallowing 
MOSCOW'S baited proxy challenges at 
the time, place and manner of their 
choosing?and make our responses 
where, when and as we choose.
