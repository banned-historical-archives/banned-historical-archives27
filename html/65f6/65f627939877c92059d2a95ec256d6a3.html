 imperialists and the internal counter-revolutionaries,
 thereby achieving great victory in the people's democratic
 revolution.
 It was after the birth of the Chinese Communist
 Party-a party of the Chinese working class itself-and
 under its direct leadership that the working-class move-
 ment of present-day China progressed along the road to
 victory.
 The trade unions of China led by the Communist
 Party have rallied the workers around the Party and
 have thus become transmission belts between the Party
 and the masses.  After the establishment of the people's
 democratic dictatorship, the trade unions under the
 leadership of the Party have become a school of adminis-

 tration, a school of management and a school of commu-
 nism for the workers.
 The trade unions of China are mass organizations of
 all manual and non-manual workers living entirely or
 mainly on their wages, formed on a voluntary basis with-
 out distinction of nationality, sex or religious beliefs.
 The People's Republic of China is a republic led by
 the working class.  Hence, the interests of the state and
 the common interests of the entire people constitute the
 fundamental interests of the working class.  The trade
 unions, on behalf of the workers, should therefore take
 an active part in the enactment of laws and decrees of
 the state concerning production and labour as well as
 the material and cultural life of the workers, firmly sup-
 port and carry out all the policies, laws and decrees of
 the People's Government, and serve as firm social pillars
 of the people's democratic dictatorship.
 The most important tasks of the trade unions of
 China during the period of national construction are to
 strengthen the unity of the working class, to consolidate
 the alliance of workers and peasants, to educate the work-
 ers to observe consciously the laws and decrees of the
 state and labour discipline, to strive for the development
 of production, for the constant increase of labour produc-
 tivity, for the fulfilment and over-fulfilment of the pro-
 duction plans of the state, for the speedy industrializa-
 tion of the country and for the steady advance towards
 socialism.  The trade unions should constantly show
 concern for the improvement of living and working con-
 ditions and, on the basis of developing production,

 gradually but actively improve the material and cultural
 life of the workers.
 In state-owned enterprises, the workers are the mas-
 ters, and it should be the sacred duty of the trade unions
 to mobilize and organize the workers to ensure the fulfil-
 ment and over-fulfilment of state production plans.
 In enterprises jointly owned by state and private
 capital and in the enterprises which regularly do process-
 ing work for the state, it is the paramount duty of the
 trade unions to raise production and to supervise the
 implementation of contracts.
 In privately-owned enterprises, although the work-
 ers are still subjected to exploitation, their political rights
 and legitimate economic interests are afforded effective
 protection by the law of the state and by the trade union
 organizations.  Therefore it is also the duty of the trade
 unions in the privately-owned enterprises to organize and
 educate the workers to raise production and see to it
 that the capitalists are observing the government laws
 and decrees, thus enabling these enterprises to play an
 active part in the national welfare and people's livelihood
 under the leadership of the state-owned sector of the
 national economy.  This conforms with the fundamental
 interests of the working class.
 The trade unions of China are organized along in-
 dustrial lines, based on democratic centralism.  They
 must take collective leadership, persuasion and educa-
 tion as the main methods of their work.  They must
 show concern over the interests of the masses, gather
 their views and promote criticism and self-criticism.
 They must consistently pay attention to the fight against

 bureaucracy and commandism which separate them from
 the masses, and at the same time, constantly improve
 the organization and discipline of the workers.
 The trade unions of China must constantly educate
 the workers in internationalism and actively take part
 in the international working-class  movement.  They
 must strive for the unity and solidarity of the movement
 and for the defence of lasting peace in the Far East and
 throughout the world.
