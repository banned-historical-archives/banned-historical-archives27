 National Intelligence Bulletin
 January 9, 1976
 The official announcement of the death of Chinese Premier Chou En-Iai
 yesterday morning appears to have been received calmly. Chou's long illness and
 gradual withdrawal from affairs of state had prepared the Chinese public for the
 moment of his death. He will be succeeded as premier by Teng Hsiao-ping, now
 China's first vice premier, who has been fulfilling most of Chou's former duties for
 well over a year.
 Chou's physical decline apparently began in 1972 and the 10th party congress,
 which met in August 1973, probably was convened in part to work out arrangements
 for his eventual replacement. Public indications that he was ill surfaced almost two
 years ago, when the premier began to curtail his public activities. Chou entered a
 hospital in June of 1974, emerging briefly on only two occasions. He probably
 entered the terminal phase of his illness-now officially confirmed to have been
 cancer-in September 1975, when he ceased to receive visitors even in his hospital
 suite.
 The fact that Teng has already been managing the Chinese state on a day-to-day
 basis should make the formal transition to the post-Chou era relatively painless. No
 immediate policy changes as a result of the premier's demise are likely. Indeed, the
 Chinese can probably count their management of the transition as one of their major
 successes of the past year and a half.
 In addition to carrying out his formal duties as Chou's stand-in, Teng
 Hsiao-ping has, over the past year, moved vigorously to consolidate his authority
 over the state, party, and army bureaucracies-he holds important military and party
 posts as well as that of ranking vice premier-by appointing close associates to key
 jobs in each hierarchy. Teng, however, lacks the overwhelming prestige and even
 affection accorded to Chou by the Chinese public and by many officials of the
 regime.
 As one of the most prominent victims of the Cultural Revolution, his past
 record is at least somewhat vulnerable. Terig's gradual reassumption of power over
 the past three years has presumably been resented by party elements closely
 associated with the policies of the Cultural Revolution. This resentment is unlikely
 to abate fully any time soon.
 Teng has a well-deserved reputation as an efficient administrator, but he does
 not seem to possess to the same degree Chou's talents for conciliation and
 compromise. He almost certainly lacks the broad vision as well as the depth of varied

 experience possessed by Chou, who had remained uninterruptedly at the highest
 levels of the Chinese Communist Party since its founding in 1921-a record that even
 surpasses that of Mao himself. Teng does appear to retain the confidence of Mao
 Tse-tun ,
 Although Chou has not been managing the day-to-day affairs of state for the
 past year and a half, he almost certainly played an important advisory role in the
 decision-making process until the terminal phase of his illness totally incapacitated
 him last autumn. This advice, and the vast experience that lay behind it, is now lost
 to China, and its absence over time is likely to have a subtle effect on the shape and
 flexibility of Chinese policies, both domestic and foreign. For example, although
 Teng Hsiao-ping appears to accept fully the rationale that led to Peking's partial
 rapprochement with Washington, one of the two men who initiated the policy and
 whose prestige was deeply bound up with its success has now been removed
 permanently from the scene.
 Chou's demise, although fully expected, underlines the age and uncertain
 health of other top leaders of the Chinese regime, particularly that of Mao himself,
 who turned 82 two weeks ago and who is obviously frail. Two and possibly three
 other members of the Chinese Politburo are also either feeble or in uncertain health.
 Chou is the second party vice chairman to die in less than a month and the third
 member of the Politburo standing committee to die in less than a year. Peking may
 soon find it necessary to reconstitute the party's top leadership by moving up several
 second-ranking figures. Chou's death highlights the fact that China has now moved
 well into the transition period toward a new generation of leaders.

 No progress is being made in efforts to negotiate an end to the heavy fighting in
 Beirut. The cabinet and parliament have been unable to meet this week, and the
 Palestinians and  Lebanese Muslims are boycotting meetings of the "higher
 coordination committee" in order to protest the Christian blockade of two
 Palestinian refugee camps.
 An unofficial meeting of the coordination committee-the extra-governmental
 body that has regularly brought leaders of the warring factions together-was held
 late Wednesday night, but failed to act on cease-fire proposals made by a liberal
 Christian cabinet member. Neither the right-wing Christians nor the Palestinians
 showed any signs of willingness to compromise.
 Some units of the government's internal security force and the Lebanese army
 have been drawn into the fighting, partly agalinst their will.
 Christians in the government are pushing for greater use of the army, but as
 usual this is being resisted by Karami. Even if the army were brought in, it could not
 redress the imbalance being created by the growing Palestinian involvement.
 According to press reports, the Palestinian news agency has for the first time
 acknowledged that a "broad spectrum" of Palestinian forces is involved in the
 fighting.
 The US embassy reports that on Wednesday a force of some 1,200 Palestinians
 and leftists was attempting to open a road into Tall Zatar and Jisr al-Basha camps by
 attacking the Christian areas of Horsh Thabet and Sinn al Fil. The embassy believes
 that the large Palestinian units were still being held back at that time.

 Lebanese army and security forces have suffered casualties in the Sinn al Fil
 clashes, but appear to be attempting only to keep the private militias apart. We
 cannot confirm Palestinian charges that government forces are fighting on the side of
 the Christians. The Christians admit to losing some ground, however, and
 government units may have attempted to stand in the way of the Palestinian
 advance.
 Lebanese leftists claim to have made some gains in the Christian Ain
 al-Rummanah area, and along a line running from the Ras an Nab quarter to Beirut's
 commercial center. These claims cannot all be corroborated, but they do confirm
 Christian charges that the Palestinians and leftists are attempting to surround
 Christian al Ashrafiyah and prevent resupply of the enclave from larger Christian
 areas farther from the city center.
 Pro-Palestinian newspapers threatened early this week that the fedayeen would
 blockade al Ashrafiyah if the Christians continued to prevent Palestinian access to
 the disputed refugee camps.

 Foreign ministers of the Organization of African Unity met for less than three
 hours yesterday in Addis Ababa in public session in preparation for the emergency
 OAU summit on Angola that begins on Saturday. According to a spokesman for the
 OAU secretariat, the ministers nonetheless agreed on an agenda to be presented to
 the summit. The same spokesman said, however, that the ministers would continue
 meeting through today in secret session to "narrow areas of differences."
 The performance in Addis Ababa yesterday strongly suggests that the summit
 agenda contains a number of items that were drafted in very broad and vague terms,
 and that it will be left to the OAU heads o1 state themselves to come to grips with
 the difficult issues with which the badly divided African leaders will have to wrestle.
 The summit meeting is likely to be even more contentious now and could drag on
 longer than the scheduled two days. At this point, the OAU secretariat anticipates
 that only about 20 of the OA,U's 46 heads of state will attend the summit and the
 remainder will be represented by stand-ins.
 Representatives of the three Angolan nationalist groups are in Addis Ababa and
 one of the first issues that the summit conferees must resolve is what degree of
 participation they will be allowed. Before leaving for Addis Ababa, the "foreign
 minister" of the Luanda-based regime proclaimed by the Popular Movement for the
 Liberation of Angola issued a statement in which he ruled out any possibility of a
 reconciliation with the rival National Front for the Liberation of Angola and the
 National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
 Meanwhile, Nigeria has taken an even more uncompromising pro - Popular
 Movement stand on the eve of the summit. Nigerian Commissioner of External
 Affairs Colonel Garba declared Wednesday that Lagos would not support the
 formation of a government of national unity unless the Popular Movement itself
 initiated the move. Nigeria, he said, was going to the summit to convince other OAU
 members to recognize the Popular Movement as the sole legitimate government of
 Angola.
 A Cuban delegation has arrived in Addis Ababa, headed by Havana's permanent
 UN representative. Although the Cubans will not be able to participate in the
 summit, they reportedly plan to lobby outside the meeting with African delegations
 to gain support and recognition for the Popular Movement. The Cubans will seek to
 justify their involvement in the Angolan conflict in terms of Havana's third world
 position and African heritage.

 Prime Minister Khukrit announced a new cabinet yesterday in a bid to co-opt
 politicians reportedly involved in the attempt to bring down his government.
 The Social Agrarian Party has been brought into the United Parties coalition
 and given cabinet positions. To temper objections to this move by the Social Justice
 Party and the Social Nationalists, Khukrit expanded their roles in the government.
 Social Justice leader Thawit Klinprathum was named deputy prime minister and the
 Social Nationalists were given two additional portfolios.
 Khukrit may have succeeded in buying off the involved parties for the time
 being, but the political maneuvering of the opposition is likely to continue. At
 Khukrit's own request, a special session of the National Assembly will reportedly
 convene on January 12, and the opposition will probably use the intervening time to
 work on politicians disgruntled by the reorganization. Despite Khukrit's new cabinet
 make-up, opposition politicians are going ahead with plans to debate the motion of
 no confidence.
 In any case, the new coalition does not strengthen Khukrit's ability to handle
 the country's social and economic problems,

 The Icelandic government yesterday demanded a special NATO meeting to
 consider its grievances against the UK and threatened to break relations with
 London if British vessels continue to ram Icelandic patrol boats.
 The government also announced that the director general of the Icelandic
 Foreign Ministry will visit all NATO capitals to present Reykjavik's case. Icelandic
 ambassadors to the US, Canada, and the UN are to be called home for consultations.
 The government intends to invite NATO Secretary General Luns to Reykjavik for
 discussions.
 Meanwhile, former Icelandic prime minister Johannesson has said he wants to
 meet with the US ambassador in Reykjavik to discuss possible contingency plans to
 retain the US-manned NATO base at Keflavik if Iceland should withdraw from the
 alliance.
 This is not the first time that Johannesson has expressed interest in a bilateral
 US-Iceland defense agreement, with provisions guaranteeing US assistance whenever
 "'aggression against Iceland from any source" occurs. The ambassador expects
 Johannesson to outline the same kind of proposal at their meeting that he has made
 on earlier occasions.
 Johannesson's proposal, as well as the government's latest decisions, are
 probably intended to pressure the US and other NATO members into using their
 influence with the UK to settle the fisheries dispute. Iceland took its dispute with
 the UK to NATO and the UN last month to protest an earlier ramming by a British
 ;hip.
 Although emotions are running high in Iceland, and Reykjavik has used threats
 of a withdrawal from NATO to attract world-wide attention to the fisheries dispute,
 Icelandic leaders probably do not now consider withdrawal an imminent policy
 option. Prime Minister Hallgrimsson said earlier this week that withdrawal from
 NATO would be counterproductive inasmuch as most NATO members support
 Iceland in its dispute with the UK.

 Norwegian Prime Minister Bratteli is resigning today and will turn over the reins
 of the minority Labor government to his designated successor, Odvar Nordli.
 The 65-year-old Bratteli, who has headed the government since 1973, had
 already stepped down as party chairman last April because of poor health and last
 September he announced his intention to leave the government ultimately.
 Bratteli's resignation will probably lead to some cabinet changes, which are
 expected to be announced early next week. Among those affected may be Defense
 Minister Fostervoll, who may decide to step down. His successor would probably be
 parliamentary president Guttorm  Hansen, a strong advocate of Norwegian
 membership in NATO.
 Prime Minister - designate Nordli has been the Labor Party's parliamentary
 leader since the last election in 1973. A tough, pragmatic politician, he is strongly
 committed to international and Nordic cooperation, while at the same time
 convinced that membership in NATO remains vital to Norway's security.
 Nordli's primary task will be to reverse the decline in the fortunes of the Labor
 Party. Although he will have nearly two years until the parliamentary elections in
 September 1977, most party members are pessimistic about the party's prospects. In
 local elections last September, Labor increased its share of the vote over what it
 received in the disastrous national elections of 1973, but lost control in Oslo and
 several other traditional urban strongholds. The local elections were only a partial
 success for the party and demonstrated Labor's failure to recoup the losses it
 suffered in 1973.

 Progress in trade negotiations between the EC and the Mediterranean states,

 Community's goal of expanding EC trade and influence throughout the area.
 The EC and Malta reached agreement on a preferential trade and aid accord on

 agreements with Morocco and Algeria are expected shortly. Meanwhile, a second
 round of talks between the EC and three eastern Mediterranean states begins this
 month.
 The EC concluded a preferential tradle agreement with Israel last year, but
 negotiations with the three Maghreb states were held up by demands for greater EC
 concessions. An Italian dispute with Tunisia over olive oil and fishing rights-only
 recently resolved-and Italy's resistance to certain agricultural concessions granted
 the Israelis also had slowed down the talks.
 The Maghreb agreements, two of which expand on existing arrangements,
 provide for preferential reductions in tariffs on industrial goods and on certain
 agricultural products. They would include new protocols on technical, financial,
 economic, and environmental cooperation, as well as provisions for equal treatment
 for migrant workers. The agreements should also include a non-discrimination clause
 prohibiting participating states from boycotting individual countries or firms that do
 business with Israel.
 Under the new agreements, Morocco and Tunisia would benefit primarily from
 greater access to EC markets for their fruits and vegetables. Algeria is most attracted
 to the protocol on industrial cooperation, as well as the provisions concerning the
 export of Algerian wine and refined petroleum to the EC.
 Malta's demand for more than $30 million in financial assistance from the EC
 was the primary factor holding up its accord. The French, who were insisting that
 community aid should not exceed $21 million, finally gave in to EC pressure and
 agreed on a compromise figure of about $26 million in financial assistance-of which
 $5 million will be in the form of grants.
 The EC plans to begin a new round of negotiations this month with Egypt,
 which already has a preferential-but more limited-agreement with the EC, and
 with Syria and Jordan, which do not. Talks with Lebanon are also anticipated once
 the political situation there stabilizes.

 The Egyptians will probably seek a supplementary protocol on financial
 assistance. This could complicate negotiations. West Germany is insisting that any
 financial protocol with the Arab states of the eastern Mediterranean must be
 accompanied by a similar protocol with Israel. The French and the Irish are resisting
 any decision to provide the Israelis with financial assistance, arguing, in part, that
 the standard of living in Israel is higher than in three of the EC-member states.

 Torrijos Visit to Cuba
 Panamanian Chief of Government Omar Torrijos departs tomorrow for a
 six-day visit to Cuba and his first meeting with Fidel Castro. Each man will try to
 use the meeting for his own-and sometimes conflicting-ends. Castro will be seeking
 support on such sensitive issues as Cuba's Angolan involvement and its promotion of
 Puerto Rican and Belizean independence. Torrijos will be trying to publicize
 Panama's struggle for sovereignty over the canal and reaffirm his revolutionary
 credentials without raising hackles in the US enough to damage prospects for
 eventual congressional ratification of a canal treaty. Recent visits by high-level
 emissaries between the two capitals attest to the importance of the visit for both.
 Torrijos' Aims
 Torrijos wants to give his domestic critics on the left something to cheer about.
 His government policies have recently taken a conservative turn, due in part to the
 country's continuing economic slump that dictates fence-mending efforts with the
 business community. He replaced the pro-union labor minister and proposed
 revisions in the heretofore sacrosanct labor code. Torrijos worries that in the absence
 of any visible progress in the treaty negotiations, the left could begin to focus on
 apparent revolutionary backsliding. Torrijos hopes that a public display of rapport
 with Castro will gain him time for more lengthy treaty negotiations and room to
 implement pro-business measures.
 Torrijos departs for Cuba immediately after the commemoration of the anti-US
 riots on January 9, 1964. This year, the celebration will provide minimal outlet for
 the left. Some anti-US speeches can be expected, but Torrijos on the eve of his trip
 to Cuba will be avoiding any potentially embarrassing incidents by radical students
 who have sometimes criticized what they call his "pseudo-revolutionary" regime.
 Increasing worldwide awareness of the canal issue is another primary objective.
 Torrijos has assiduously courted Third World support in the belief that this can be
 used to gain eventual US concessions in the treaty talks. As a result, he has not
 drawn such attention since the historic UN Security Council meeting in Panama in
 1973, when he obtained a resolution calling for a solution to the dispute and forced
 a US veto. To ensure maximum media coverage in Cuba, Torrijos has included
 several leading US journalists in his party.

 Torrijos has held off visiting Cuba for several years, feeling that the impact
 might be prejudicial. His decision to go now attests to his greater self-confidence and
 stronger position at home.
 Although he definitely does not wish to upset the treaty negotiations, his view
 of the canal talks will probably not inhibit him from taking a few public swipes at
 the US. On the whole, he is probably satisfied with the negotiators' progress thus far
 in moving toward conceptual agreement on major treaty issues. Nonetheless, he
 knows that consideration of a treaty draft by the US Congress is not likely for more
 than a year. Like other Latin American leaders, he harbors the strong suspicion that
 the US responds at least as well to pressures and threats as it does to friendship. He
 could conclude that expected domestic and international gains outweigh potential
 US reaction to statements he could justify in private as a political necessity.
 Castro's Objectives
 Castro will be using the visit to move further back into the hemisphere's
 mainstream. With this in mind, he will probably accept Torrijos' invitation to join
 other hemisphere leaders in the June celebration of the 150th anniversary of the
 first Pan-American conference. He is also likely to see support of Panama's cause in
 the treaty negotiations as a way to align himself with the rest of Latin America on a
 popular issue.
 In return, Castro will be seeking Panamanian support for Cuban foreign
 policies. Chief among these are Cuba's commitment to the Popular Movement for
 the Liberation of Angola, support for Puerto Rican independence and Belizean
 self-determination.
 Trip Results
 Aside from the expected rhetoric, several cooperation agreements-primarily in
 she fields of health, science, and agriculture-are likely. Cuban help in sugar

 cultivation would be exchanged for Panamanian aid in producing bananas. Bilateral
 cultural and sports programs will be expanded. A fishing cooperation agreement that
 would give the Cubans use of Panamanian facilities is a possibility. The new Latin
 American Economic System, the need for a new international economic order, and
 an end to colonialism-all favorite Latin American as well as Cuban themes-will
 receive strong support. But reports of Panamanian arms purchases and military
 assistance agreements, similar to those that arose when a Panamanian guard
 delegation visited Cuba last: October, are almost certainly without foundation.
 Torrijos probably will find it difficult to avoid supporting Puerto Rican
 independence, however. There is only an outside chance that the communique
 would, even in oblique fashion, extend approval to Cuba's Angola involvement.
