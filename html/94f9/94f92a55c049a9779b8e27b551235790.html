for the dikes. It doesn't take a Phila-
delphia lawyer to label this policy for 
What it is--a policy of deliberately bomb-
ing dikes. If the direct result of bombing 
a target beside a dike is that bombs- will 
inevitably hit the dike, then the dike is 
being bombed as deliberately as if the 
dike itself were the target. 
And so I urge the administration to 
recognize the drastic implication of its 
policy, and to take immediate action to 
prevent any destruction of the dikes of 
North Vietnam. Surely, in the name of 
decency, the military priorities of the 
administration and its policy of massive 
bombing must yield to the simple human 
fact that countless innocent lives are be-
ing jeopardized when the dikes are 
bombed. Surely, in its unseemly zeal to 
bbinb the North into a settlement of the 
war before election day, the administra-
tion can at least pull back from the-awful 
brink of destruction and spare the dikes. 
Surely, America, can forgo the destruc-
tion of a military target if it means the 
Safety of a dike. 
One more point should be made. The 
Issue of the bombing of the dikes has be-
come a cause of legitimate and substan-
tial concern throughout the world. The 
allegations about the dikes are clearly 
rarSing new and increasingly. serious 
doubts in the international community 
about- America's role in Vietnam. Per-
haps the most ominous aspect of the con-
troversy, apart from the enormous ques-
tion of the validity of the allegations be-
ing made,. is the extremely hostile, de-
fellSiVe and increasingly isolated posture 
the President has adopted in seeking to 
rebut the charges. 
The latest. incident was the President's 
news conference last week, in which be 
labeled the Secretary General of the 
United Nations as naive and tf dupe of 
Hanoi for daring to raise the question of 
the dikes, Mr. Waldheim is a. distin-
guished and respected diplomat who has 
the; confidence of all the member nations 
of the United Nations. I deeply regret the 
desperate ad hominem attack he has 
now suffered at the hands of the admini-
stration for speaking out of conscience 
on what has already become one of the 
great moral issues of the war. The proper 
stance of the administration on the issue 
Is to deal on the merits with the- ques-
tions about the dikes, not to attack those 
who raise the issue. 
Incidents like this demonstrate why 
the Se.nate resolution introduced today 
come-s at such an important time. The 
Senate has its own responsibility to help 
resolve the issue of the dikes. It is 
my hope that the serious questions now 
outstanding about our policy will be an-
swered at once, so that the conscience of 
America can be cleared, at least on this 
new and ominous aspect of the war. 
What is at stake .here is not simply the 
outcome of the war, but the judgment of 
?history on the (talons of the United 
States against a tiny Asian nation., 
Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I am 
delighted to be a cosponsor of the resolu-
tion putting the Senate firmly on record 
In opposition to the bombing of the dikes 
in North Vietnam. 
It is almost impossible to determine 
with any accuracy what damage our 
planes are causing the dikes. On the one 
hand we have the sort of denial I received 
from the Defense Department on July 
19 indicating that, and I quote: 
The remote possibility exIsts that in our 
bombing of . . . military targets minor dam-
age may have occurred to dikeS or small irri-
gation clams. 
On the other hand we have accusations 
by the North Vietnamese that we are de-
liberately bombing a great number of 
dikes. 
The truth undoubtedly, lies somewhere 
in between. 
I am quite sure that we are not en-
gaged in a systematic attempt to destroy 
the dikes in the North. As this resolu-
tion makes clear, the President stated on 
June 29 that this was against American 
Policy. 
However, at, a lime when a ranking offi-
cer in South Vietnam, General Lavelle, 
can conduct unauthorized bombing raids 
and receive no more -than a gentle slap 
on the wrist, it is entirely possible, even 
probable, that individuals charged with 
flying sorties might find it in accordance 
with their concept of national policy to 
take a few runs at the dikes. 
This is why I believe today's resolution 
is so important. It not only makes it clear 
to our friends around the world who are 
understandable upset by the recent, 
charges that tile Senate does not condone 
attacks on North Vietnam's dike system. 
It also serves to discourage American 
airmen from taking steps that they- may 
mistakenly feel are ill our national in-
terest, despite our official posture. 
I am hopeful that the Senate can act 
quickly- to implement this resolution. - 
I ask unanimous consent that my letter 
to Secretary of Defense Laird on this 
issue as well as the Defense Departinent's 
response be printed in the Ri2COR.D. 
There being no objection, the items 
were orderer. to be printed in the E.Econn,

The Honorable MELvIN LAIRD,

DEAR MR. SLCRETARY : The New York Times 
for June 2G, 1972 carries a piece by Anthony 
Lewis raising the question of whether or not 
the United States is now bombing the dikes 
in. North Vietnam. 
Mr. Lewis cites the President's statement 
in 'April saying that it was something we 
wanted to avoid and that it was not needed. 
He also cites. a number of specific public 
statements, two of them by non-Vietnam 
sources asserting that the dikes have been 
bombed. One charged that 'one of the dikes 
?was completely cut" and another asserted 
that "Without doubt there is now systematic 
bombing of the dikes." 
Mr. Lewis states that no one should douh-t 
what bombing the dikes might mean. "It 
would bring into play, justifiably for once, 
that much ab.used word genocide.-
I am writing to you to ask for a specific 
straightforward, =hedged, and unqualified 
statement by you as to the facts. 
Has the U.S. bombed any of the dikes? 
'Is the U.S. systematically bombing the 
dikes? 
If we are not bombing the dikes, would 
you cite the specific detailed orders which 
were given not to bomb them. 
If we are bombing the dikes would you 
cite the specific authority under which you 
or the President specifically authorized the 
bombing. 
We need an explicit statement of the facts 
and our policy now. 
I would appreciate an immedite reply. lf 
we are bombing, Congress and the U.S. pub-
lic need to know it. If we arc not, that 
should be made public in order to forestall 
charges which have no basis In fact.

Washington, D.C., July 19, 1O2. 
II011. WILLIAM PROXMIRE, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAF: SENATOR PROXMIRE: Secretary Laird 
has asked me to reply to your letter of June 
27; 1972, concerning the alleged bombing of 
the dikes in North Vietnam by the United 
States, 
The United States has exercised great 
restraint in our current bombing of North 
Vietnam. The US is not targeting dikes or 
dams in North Vibtnam. Since some military 
targets, such as bridges and anti-aircraft 
artillery and missile sites are sometimes near 
dikes or dams, the remote possibility cidsts 
that in our bombing of these military Isn't La 
minor damage may have occurred to diees 
or small irrigation dams. Some enemy 
anti-
aircraft sites have been placed on or bear 
dikes and our pilots have the authority. a ad 
the inherent right of self-protection, to at-
tack such sites In self-defense. Furthermore, 
there is an obvious posaibility of clainaec to 
dikes or irrigation dam; from North Viet-
namese &kids, downed MIGs or anti-aircraft 
shells falling back to earth, 
It is quite clear that the North Vietnam-
ese are conducting a worldwide. propaganda 
campaign falsely alleging that the Uiaited 
States is systematically bombing their dike 
system. No doubt the United States will be 
blamed by North Vietnam for any and all 
damages to the dike system over the next 
few months. 
In fact, floods occurred last year in North 
Vietnam in- the absence of bombing partiel-
ly because of the generally poor sta.ae 01 
maintenance of the water conservancy sys-
tem. Furthermore, the following warnins". on 
the neglected state of the system appeared 
In the official North Vietnamese newapaper, 
Hanoi Moi, on July 20, 1972: 
"In some places the repair of the dike 
portions that were damaged by torrential 
rains. in 1971 11as not yet met technical re-
quirements. A number of thin and 
cued dikes v,-hich are probably full of tern-Lite 
colonies and holes have not yet been de-
tected for repair. Therefore, cadres and peo-
ple in the capital must absolutely not be 
subjective: Let each individual, locality and 
unit actively participate in the present dike-
strengthening movement; especially in Min-
ing and sondfying the Important portion 
of dikes. There Is not much time before the 
torrential rain season." 
These facts should set the record straight 
on our actual bombing policies and North 
Vietnamese allegations. 
Sincerely, 
DENNIS J. DOOLIN.

ereenary use in Laos 
shows evils of secrecy 
Washington. 
Secrecy leads to self-decep-
tion. If you want proof of that 
overlooked political axiom, 
:then look .at the way we have 
gotten inVolved with a secret 
mercenary army in Laos. 
It.. all started *off not so 
1. innocently a decade ago when  the Central Intelligence Agen-
cy recruited, directed and 
.supported an army of Meo 
tribesmen to keep Laos from 
going Communist. It was like 
having a Gurkha army of our 
own, only no one knew we 
had it and thus nobody cared 
that we were, getting ever. 
mare involved in a war in 
Laos. ? - 
It- was all going along 
'splendidly until the CIA sent 
General ?Vang , Pao and his 
army off .on ah ill-fated offen-
sive last spring. The Meo 
"irregulars" got chewed up; 
they had about 10 per cent 
casualties. That might not 
have, been too bad .except 
there. were no more tribes-' 
men to recruit in Laos. So the 
. CIA started recruiting merce-
naries? in Thailand, only it 
called them "volunteers." 
Now the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee has discov,-
cred that we have a $100 
. million annual commitment to, 
finance an army of 10.000 
Thai "volunteers" fighting in 
Laos. 
The Thai like it because 
they are getting good pay as 
well as extra military assist-
ance from, the United States. 
Presurriably the Lao like it 
because the Meo and Thai 
can do the fighting. But what 
about the Congress and the 
'1$0or American taxpayer who 
fever- knew they were run-
ring up a $100 million annual 
bill in Laos? And what does it 
.say about the present moral 
' character of a nation that 200 
years ago won its independ-
ence fighting Hessian merce-
naries? 
Put asine all the moral, 
geopolitical and financial con-
siderations. It's also a dis-
turbing case of the evils of 
secrecy in our government 
and Congress. Secrecy pro-
vides a way to subvert the 
' ,Way it has tolerated secrecy' 
even within its own ranks. 
For all its criticism of the 
executive branch, Congress 
really, likes secrecy. At least 
those in power do because 
secrecy means power. "If you 
only knew what I know" 
makes a senator very impor-
tant in his own eyes and in, 
the eyes of his colleagues. It?  
also is a very good argument 
to silence any upstart who 
dares question the Wisdom of 
the Appropriations Committee 
or the Armed Services Com-
mittee.

Oh sure, the CIA informed Senator Symington. One day

it intimidated them by ex-
plaining it was so hush-hush 
they couldn't talk about it to 
the rest of Congress. After 
that the privileged few didn't 
even bother to raise questions 
.?that was until Senator 
Stuart Symington and his 
Foreign Relations subcom-
mittee came along and start-
ed poking' around in the sec-
ret war in Laos. Even now 
the State Department and 
CIA won't 'fess up to what 
they are doing with the Thai 
mercenaries. The reason is 
that Congress last year 
passed a law prohibiting the 
use of defense funds to help 
third-country forces fight in 
support of the Laotian or 
Cambodian governments. If 
all the facts were made pub-
lic, it would be evident that 
the executive branch was vio-
lating the law. 
It's easy enough to blame 
the executive branch for its 
secrecy. Everybody knows?
including President Nixon, 
who issued a new executive 
order on classification recent-
ly?that the government busi-
ness is weighted down with 
excessive secrecy. There's 
probably no cure unless bu-
reaucrats are punished for 
over-classification, and no-
body is about to do that. 'But 
much of the blame must be 
placed on Congress for the 
secrecy on the Thai merce-
naries. The next day he is on 
the Senate floor questioning 
whether secrets should be 
given to members of Con-
gress except those on the 
Armed Services, Foreign Re-
lations, and Atomic Energy 
cominittees. Senator Syming-
ton, it should be pointed out, 
is the only member of all ? 
three committees. 
Secrecy is also a convenient 
way for Congress to avoid 
responsibility it really doesn't 
like. '"Only the President has 
access to all the secret infor-
mation and he must know, 
what is right." That's a com-
mon refrain around Capitol 
Hill these days when the 
President is getting us deeper 
into the Vietnam war. It's 
also an easy way to hide 
behind the President and 
duck responsibility. 
The whole security system. 
obviously is not going to 
come tumbling down. Nor 
should it. But once Congress 
starts questioning it, maybe it 
will begin to realize that Sen-
ator Mike Gravel has a point 
when he argues that Congress 
also can determine what in-
formation should be made 
public. Right now it's reached 
the point of absurdity; the 
Senate sends its debates in. 
secret session clown to . the' 
executive branch to be de-
classified. 
Congress ought :to under-

WASIIINGTON--Lif We didn't know 
better; there would be reason to suspect 
the. Central'. Intelligence Agency of 
being in back of the celebrated "leaks" 
that have stood Washington on its head 
in recent times, for each of the revela-
tions has enhanced the reputation and 
standing of the CIA'. ' ? ' 
In that respect, the latest expose re-
volving around the disclosure of the so-
Called "Kissinger 'Papers," is no differ-
ent from the famed "Pentagon Papers" 
of last year or the more recent "Ander-
son Papers." No matter how you slice 
these papers, the CIA comes out look-
ing realistic and dependable, at least 
comparatively so. 
? . . 
Nixon Had Good Advice 
?? ? 
? 
It is possible to see now [thru the 
just-revealed Kissinger Papers] that , 
President Nixon, like President Johnson, 
had good advice, much of it supplied by 
the CIA, as well as bad advice, and. 
that 'both chief executives chose to lis-
ten to what they wanted to. hear, .which 
is why the, war is still going on. 
Soon after.taking office in 1969, Nix-
on, thru his national security . adviser, 
Henry Kissinger, initiated a review of 
the Viet Nam conflict. The results of . 
the study, leaked to the press and Con-
gress last week, showed the CIA was 
bearish on the war. On . bombing, for., 
example, it said: . 
"The air war did not seriously affect 
the flow of men and supplies to Com-
munist forces in Laos and South Viet 
Nam. Nor did it significantly erode 
North Viet Nam's military defense ca-
pabilities or Hanoi's determination to 
persist in the war." 
That was nearly four years ago, and 
still looks like sound advice today. Nix-, 
on, however, didn't want to believe it 
then and apparently can't reconcile 
himself to it even now. The U. S. Air 
Force is presently dropping more 
bombs in Viet. Nam than ever before?
and the enemy is still advancing. 
As pointed out by Daniel Ellsberg, 
who leaked the Pentagon Papers, Presi-
dent Johnson was just as deaf to CIA 
assessments. Ellsberg showed that. 
Johnson had not lacked accurate intelli-
gence estimates from the CIA before he

had this information available, why did 
he ignore it? Why did he listen to Walt 
Rostow and McGeorge Bundy as ex-
perts on Viet Nam instead of people 
who had a very good track. record for 
prediction?" ? 
The later Anderson Papers shed some 
?light on Presidential decision-making. 
The off ic a 1 documents that were 
brought to light by columnist Jack An-
derson center on the recent war be-
tween Pakistan and India. They showed 
the CIA once again providing a realistic 
estimate of the situation and a Presi-
dent once again choosing to: ignore' it. 
Nixon wanted Pakistan to win and or-
dered all hands to "tilt" against India, 
even tho he was' warned that it was a 
losing cause.' - ??? ? ? 
Key Committee Role - ? 
? 
Now that Presidential brinksmanship 
has spurred Congress to reassert its 
war making powers, it is imperative 
that key cominittees, such as Foreign . 
Relationi and Armed Services, have .de-
pendable intelligence on which to act. 
No time should be lost In -passing the 
Cooper bill to bring this about. 
STATOTHI 
? This legislation, introduced by Sen. 
John Sherman Cooper [R.,. Ky.], would / 
require the CIA to share its reports -7 
"fully and currently" with the appropri-
ate committees on Capitol Hill. "I con-

which is called upon to commit materi-

The CIA briefings Congress gets now 
are limited to what the administration' 
wants it to know. There is a so-called 
?"watchdog committee" [a small infor-

According to an official estimate re-

the. CIA, the military services, and

about $3 billion a year. A less official

Edward W. O'Brien 
Soviet spying unmasked 
WASHINGTON ? It's not fashionable any 
j longer to apply the term "Cold War" to the 
competition between the United States and 
the Soviet Union. 
Semantics-a si d e, 
the two super-powers 
are in fact in a great 
struggle for what 
each considers to be 
; stakes of the highest 
, value. Tangled 
though the Vietnam 
war issues are, one 
issue surely is the fu-
ture role of Washing-
ton and Moscow in 
; the future of South-
east Asia. 
In other parts of 
the world, the strug-
gle takes varied 
? forms; one of them O'Brien 
being the collection of information ? or, 
bluntly, espionage. It is for this purpose that 
American taxpayers appropriate hundreds of 
:anillion,s of dollars annually to the Central In-
tell i g en ce Agency and possibly larger 
amou tit s to military intelligence organiza-
, tions. 
A few years ago, the CIA was a high-priori-
ty target in this counyy of many Leftists, 
? who said the United States should not soil its 
hands on dirty tricks against the Kremlin. 
RECENTLY, DOMESTIC ATTACKS on the 
\J CIA have subsided, partly because of its dis-
creet and effective director, Richard Helms, 
who has succeeded in disarming most con-
gressional critics of CIA by informing them 
honestly and fully about his agency's findings 
and conclusions. 
How about the other side? 
As Often happens in such matters, little has 
been said publicly in the United States about 
Russian espionage operations except for an 
;. occasional brief headline when the FBI 
f, catches a Soviet agent in the act. 
Now the Senate Internal Security subcom-
mittee has published a priceless tool for any 
American with a serious interest in Soviet in-
,' telligence and 'security operations. 
THE SUBCOMMITTEE BOOK is a 289-
page list and summary of published materi-
als about achievements of Soviet intelligence 
agencies. The notable aspect of all this is 
that most of the materials were published in 
and by the Soviet itself, in books, magazines, 
and newspapers. 
Until eight years ago, the Russians main-
tained their traditional policy of silence about 
their espionage activities. Premier Nikita 
Khrushchev, for example, declared in 1962 
that the Soviet was not engaging in espionage 
because it did not intend to attack anyone 
and therefore did r not need such information. 
But on Sept. 4, 1964, the Senate study 
states, "the Soviet Union did a dramatic re-
versal, and since then there has been a spate 
of articles and books extolling the Soviet in-
telligence and security services and creating 
a new pantheon of heroes?the staunch pro-
tectors of the fledgling Communist regime of 
the 1918-1921 period and the intrepid intelli-
gence operatives spying abroad during the in-
ter-war period at great personal sacrifice and 
danger for the Soviet fatherland." 
THE FIRST OF THE NEW heroes was-
Richard Sorge, Who spied brilliantly for the 
Soviet in Tokyo just before and during World 
War II. He was discovered, tortured, and ex-
ecuted by the Japanese in 1994. 
Once the publicity barrier was down, many 
other spies were deified. Rudolf Abel, who 
was convicted in New York in 1957 and later 
sent back to Moscow in a prisoner exchange, 
was glorified as another Sorge by the KGB, 
the Soviet security service. 
"The admission to the Soviet people that 
the KGB ? long portrayed to them as an in-
ternal, defensive arm of the state ? does in 
fact engage in peacetime spying abroad wa,s 
even more dramatic than the revelations of 
the activities of military intelligence," The 
Senate study said. 
Some of the Soviet books and articles are 
available in English translation from the 
Commerce Department's Joint Publications 
Research Service here. Even the brief de-
scriptions in the Senate compilation provide a 
rare glimpse into an obscure side of the all 
too real world. .

The Daily Times fervently hopes that 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
will report favorably on a bill requiring 
the cent r tel1Ienc4,4vcy to pro-
vide
cer am ongressional committees 
, with the same intelligence reports and 
analyses the Agency furnishes regularly 
to the White House. 
And we hope the Senate takes prompt 
, favorable action on the measure, too. The 
bill was introduced last year by Senator 
Cooper of Kentucky. 
If Congress is to assume or, more 
properly, re-assume its role in the for-
eign policy process, it must have ade-
quate information. 
The average U.S. citizen hasn't the 
foggiest notion what the,Z7TA is doing or 
where it is doing .it. This s crecy might 
very well be essential to the agency's 
function. But the U.S. intelligence gather-
ing operations cost the American tax-
payer up to $6 billion annually and, at 
the very least, the taxpayers are entitled 
to some assurance that this intelligence 
information and analysis is furnished to 
-their elected representatives who serve 
on the Congressional Cominittee vitally ; 
concerned, 
The Pentagon paper&. illustrated the 
fact that some intelligence assessments 
are sometimes at odds with White House 
policies. 
Moreover, a CIA official has disclosed 
that his agency has been furnishing high-
ly secret intelligence on world atomic 
developments to the Joint Atomic Energy 
Committee for 15 years without a breach 
in security. 
Actually it is time that Congress estab-
lished close scrutiny of all intelligence . 
operations. 
Back in 1967, the CIA tried to head 
off similar legislation by inviting three 
members of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee to attend joint briefings of the 
Armed Services and Appropriations Corn-
mittee.s which are now responsible for 
overseeing intelligence matters. But not 
a single meeting of this group was called 
during all of last year. 
We believe it is essential that at least 
some key members of Congress' keep in-
formed about what this secret arm of 
the Government is doing. 
? - 
How else can Congress assume ? and 
fulfill ? its own responsibilities in the 
field of U.S. foreign policy?

Bring The CIA To? Heel 
Although CongresS :;11 the, foreign aid 
authorization bill signed earlier this year im-
posed some controls over the Central Intelli-
gence Agency, the free wheeling CIA still 
operates without much accountability to the 
legislative branch of government. Its budget 
remains secret. And only last month a study 
by the General Accounting revealed that 
. Agency for International Development funds 
intended for public health use in Laos were 
being diverted to the CIA for use in the guer-
"rilla war in that country. 
5 The record of CIA disdain for the will of 
Cungress underscores the importance of Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee hearings on a bill 
proposed by Senator John Sherman Cooper/ j 
which would oblige the agency to provide 
congressional committees dealing with armed 
.services and foreign policy "fully and cur-
rently" with both intelligence information and 
evaluations affecting foreign relations and na-
tional security. Two former .CIA officials, Dr. ?i 
Herbert Scoville and Chester L. Cooper, testi-
fying for the bill, said the agency should pro-
vide Congress with the same analyses it now 
regularly prolrides the White House. 
At present CIA briefings of Congress are j 
?provided only as sanctioned by the White 
House. Since Congress also has authority in 
foreign relations and military affairs, there is 
justification for giving the legislators access to 
CIA data. Indeed, its machinations in the mili-
tary and political affairs of other countries sug-
gest that it has arrogated to itself so many im-
proper policy-making initiatives that the agency 
should be either be abclished pr restricted by 
law. to intelligence gathering alone. , ?

Intelligence Agency to share its reports 
"fully and currently" with the military 
' and foreign-affairs committees on Capital 
Hill was the subject of the lead editorial 
in Sunday's Washington Post. 
Said the Post: "No more useful piece 
of foreign-policy legislation has been 
drafted since Congress got its dander up

Opening hearings on the measure, Sen-
Cooper declared, "I contend that the

Commission and Defense . Department 
have been required to keep Congress'

It seems to us that Sen. Cooper is 
quite right to regard the CIA as an 
agency of disinterested specialists 
providing a necessary and valuable 
product, intelligence ,which Congress has 
reason and right to share. - 
The exemplary record of Congress ill 
dealing with atomic energy makes it 
untenable to claim that Congress can't 
keep secrets. The overriding point is that 
Congress cannot make good decisimis if 
it does not have good and timely in-
formation.

Congress arid C.I.A. 
The. Senate Foreign Relations Committee conducted 
hearings last week on a bill requiring the Central Intelli-
gence Agency to provide the appropriate Congressional 
cotrunittees with the same intelligence analyses it regu-
larly furnishes the White House. This legislation, intro-
duced last year by Senator Cooper, ought to be expedited 
in the interests of strengthening the machinery of foreiR 
policy. 
As Congress reasserts its rightful role in the foreign 
policy process, it is essential that its members be as 
fully informed as possible. The respective Congressional 
committees are entitled to share the fruits of intelligence-
gathering operations for which the American taxpayer 
Is billed up to $6 billion annually. These fruits include 
assessments which sometimes sharply challenge Execu-
tive policies, as the Pentagon Papers revealed. 
There is ample precedent for Senator Cooper's pro-
posal. A former C.I.A. official testified last week that v 
the agency has been furnishing highly classified intelli-
gence on world atomic developments to the Joint Atomic 
Energy Committee for fifteen years, with no security, 
breaches. Even now, senior agency officials provide oral 
briefings to other committees on request but only with 
White House approval. Congress could better discharge 
its own constitutional responsibilities in the foreign 
policy field if it had full and direct access to this 
information. 
Beyond the Cooper bill, it is high time Congress 
revived its languishing effort to establish closer scrutiny 
of intelligence operations. In a move designed to side-
track legislation with this aim, the Foreign Relations 
Committee in 1967 was invited to send three members 
to the C.I.A. joint briefings held by the Armed Services / 
and Appropriations Committees, which are \currently 
responsible for overseeing intelligence activities. But no' 
meetings of this group were called during all of last I 
year?an "oversight" of frightening dimensions. 
It is not enough for Congress to know what the C.I.A._ 
is saying. Itis also essential that at least key members of 
the legislative branch, which provides the funds for 
worldwide intelligence-gathering and other undercover 
operations, keep informed about what, in general, this 
secret arm of the United States Government is doing.

No more useful piece of foreign-policy legislation 
has been drafted since Congress got its dander up 
than Senator Cooper's bill requiring the Central 
Intelligence Agency to share its reports "fully and

committees on Capitol Hill. "I contend," said Mr. 
' Cooper, opening hearings, "that the Congress,

. Meaning to end the practice of arbitrary CIA brief-
'?ings, he would require the CIA to keep Congress as 
well as the Executive informed, just as the Atomic 
?Energy, Commission and Defense Department have 
been required to keep the Joint Atomic Energy 
Committee informed in that field since 1946. 
It seems to uslir. Cooper is quite right to regard 
the CIA?at least, that largest part of it concerned 
with intelligence?not as a beast needing to be 
tamed, as many of its critics do; not as a baby 
needing to be coddled, as most members of the 
congressional "oversight" committees do; but as 
an agency of disinterested specialists providing a

Congress has reason and right to share. Such an 
'approach accords with the CIA's known capabilities 
and it accords as well with the political realities: 
'efforts to tighten legislative oversight have tradi-

Mr. Cooper has taken an undogmatic approach 
...to such essential questions as what part of the CIA 
STATOTHR 
paper factory's product should be made available, 
by what procedures, with what security arrange-
ments, and so on. He hopes to avoid a constitu-

the CIA, it can direct it to share. its output. No 
substantial question of executive privilege is in-
volved, in his view, since Congress would not be 
asking for the advice the President receives from 
his lieutenants but for the information on which 
the advice is based. Further hearings will explore 
these sub-issues. 
e-tss 
The overriding point remains that Congress can-
not make good decisions if it does not have good 
and timely information. The CIA is the logical place 
to look: it is charged with collating all intelligence 
produced within the government and, unlike the 
Executive departments which deal in the critical 
fields of weapons, military aid or arms control, it 
has (in those -fields) no operational responsibilities 
and hence no incentive to shape its intelligence to 
fit its own departmental programs. The exemplary 
record of Congress in dealing with atomic energy 
makes it untenable to claim that Congress can't 
keep secrets. Anyway, everyone knows that it's the 
Executive branch which does most of the leaking. 
Regular provision of CIA information to Congress 
would probably tend to limit the practice of self-
serving Executive leaks. 
We trust the President will look sympathetically 
upon this bill introduced by one of the most -re-
sponsible and experienced . members of his own 
party and realize its potential advantages to the 
Congress and to the nation as well.

One of the recurring criticisms of the Central 
? ? Intelligence Agency is that despite the hundreds of 
; millions of dollars it spends to gather information, 
the distribution of that information is so limited that 
' Congress has little benefit from it. A remedy for 
this gap has been proposed by former CIA official, 
Dr. Herbert Scoville Jr., once deputy director for 
/ research, has suggested that the same intelligence 
and analyses be supplied to appropriate congressional 
-committees as now goes to the White House. Ho' 
argues that while much information is provided by 
the executive branch to Congress, it is subject to. 
distortion by administrative officials. 
- There arc two aspects of such a development 
that raise questions. One is the issue of security. But 
Dr. Scoville pointed out that CIA intelligence has 
been submitted regularly to the Joint Congressional 
Committee on Atomic Energy for years, as required 
by statute, without any breaches of security. The 
other is the danger of congressional members being 
overwhelmed with a mass of information. 
. To solve the latter problem, another former CIA 
official, Chester L. Cooper, proposes that represen-
tatives of the CIA be assigned to the congressional 
.committees to screen out the important material and 
bring it to their ?attention. The material wouldn't 
ation 
be available to everybody, but only to those commit-
tees dealing with foreign affairs and national secur-
ity. 
? In a period when Congress is insisting that it 
be given a larger voice in the direction of foreign 
policy and those activities 'likely to involve the 
United States in international conflict, it is vital 
that its members be fully informed. In the recent 
past, the accumulation of power in the White House 
has left Congress all too often in the dark or able to 
obtain only what information the executive feels it 
should have. 
Many critics in .Washington feel that the CIA 
and its activities should be controlled directly by 
the State Department, except perhaps for clandestine 
activities, which should be directed separately. There 
have been many indications in the past decade that 
the CIA operates independently of the State Depart-
ment and, as a result, has a tendency to make its 
own foreign policy. While the State Department's 
state of eclipse is such today that it is acarcely in 
a position to assert greater control over the CIA, 
increased reporting to Congress might at least keep 
Congress in closer touch with the realities of power 
in the federal government and enable it to make 
sounder decisions on policies to be followed by both 
agencies

informing The Congress 
:If the power of Congress as one of 
the three equal branches of government. 
jfas waned in recent times, it is in part 
./because the legislators don't always have 
sufficient information to make sound de-
cisions, much less to exert influence. No-
where is this more true than in the field 
of foreign affairs. 
The President, of course, is granted 
the authority to make foreign policy, but 
at the same time the Congress holds the 
constitutional power to make war. Obvi-
ously these roles overlap. Nonetheless, it 
is past tiine for Congress to re-assert its 
prerogatives. A beginning would be to de-
mand information. 
? A bill which would accomplish that 
to some degree has been introduced by 
Sen. John Sherman Cooper (R-1v.) The 
bill calls for the Central Intelligence 
J Agency (CIA),tu inform "fully and cur-
rently" tlid.'committees in the House and 
Senate concerned with military and for-
eign affairs. In Cooper's words, it would 
grant some members of Congress "access 
to all available information and intellig-
ence" so that the legislature "can dis-
charge properly and morally" its respon-
sibility. 
That ? doesn't seem unreasonable, al-
though the Nixon administration opposes 
the measure for reasons not altogether 
clear. Certainly it would seem members 
of: the select committees involved could 
be trusted with the highly classified in-
formation. It is realized, of course, that 
in a body as large as Congress, there will 
be. a few blabbermouths. Still, it seems 
Cooper's Bill Deserves 
A Full And Fair Hearing 
well worth the risk that a secret might 
be compromised. The alternative is for 
Congress to keep operating without bene-
fit of this information. 
. The Pentagon Papers have demon-
strated that the Vietnam War might have 
been prosecuted differently, or not at all, 
had all information been known to Con-
gress and not just information which 
LBJ . wanted Con gr es s to have. 
Much the same can be said of warlike ac-
tions against Cuba and the Dominican 
Republic. 
The Cooper bill may have rough 
sledding, but it has picked up support 
from impressive, if unexpected, sources. 
This week two former senior CIA offi-
cials recommended that the CIA maintain 
liason with the Congress on a regular ba-
sis. At the same time one charged that 
the administration "misused" intelligence 
in 1969 when it asserted the Russians 
were on the verge of having a first-strike 
capability. 
It is still too early to endorse the 
bill; more debate is clearly called for. 
Yet some type of guarantee that the Con-
gress will be informed is necessary and 
this bill may be the vehicle. Hopefully it d.? 
will get a full hearing.

Two Ex-Agency Aides Back 
Bill to Require Reports 
By BENJAMIN WELLES 
sptchu to The New York TImee 
.WASHINGTON, March 28?
Two former officials of the 
Central Intelligence Agency 
urged Congress today to require 
the agency to provide it fully 
and currently with the same 
intelligence and analyses it now 
regularly provides the White 
House.? 
Dr. Herbert Scoville Jr., a 
former Deputy Director for Re-
search, noted that for 15 years 
the agency had been supplying 
the Joint Congressional Atomic 
Energy Committee with highly 
classified intelligence on world 
atomic developments. There 
have been no security breaches, 
he said. 
Dr. Scoville also suggested 
4 that regular briefings of Con-
gressional committees dealing 
with foreign affairs wo,uld en-
hance? not jeopardize? na-
tional security. 
At present, he said, both 
Congress and the public are de-
pendent on the Administration 
for information, which is often 
"distorted" to suit Administra-
tion policies. 
Would Screen Information 
Chester L. Cooper, a former 
senior analyst on Vietnam for 
the agency and now an execu-
tive of the Institute for Defense 
Analyses here, urged that se-
lected agent officers with ex-
perience on the National Secu-
rity Council staff? be assigned 
tours of duty with Congres-
sional committees dealing with 
foreign and national security af-
fairs. 
These officers, he suggested, 
would screen . what was im-
portant for Congress and thus 
prevent its being "drowned" in 
a flood of intelligence material 
?much of it irrelevant. 
Mr. Cooper also urged con-
gress to seek access to Na-
tional Security Connell study 
memorandums which, he noted, 
include not only intelligence 
but also other pertinent in-
formation relevant to policy de-
cisions. 
Dr. Scoville and Mr. Cooper 
testified before the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee, wrich 
was opening hearings today on 
a bill proposed by Senator John 
Sherman Cooper, Republican of 
Kentucky. 
The measure, sponsored in 
the House by Representative 
Paul Findley, Republican of Il-
linois, would oblige the agency 
to provide Congressional com-
mittees dealing with armed 
services and foreign policy 
"fully and currently" with 
both intelligence information 
and evaluations affecting for-
eign relations and national se-
curity. 
Senior agency officials pro-
vide frequent oral briefings on 
world affairs at the request of 
Congressional committee chair-
men, but these briefings are 
expressly sanctioned by the 
White House. 
With the exception of the:

tions or its findings to Con-

WASHINGTON ? John A. 
McCone, a former Central In-
telligence Agency director, has 
endorsed a bill that would re-
quire the CIA to turn over its 
secret intelligence reports to 
Congress. 
His endorsement indicates 
that the CIA has abandoned its 
long-standing opposition to the 
circulation of its secrets out-
side the executive branch. 
Aide g to the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee reported 
Monday that McCone had com-
mitted himself to testifying in 
favor of the bill during hear-
ings starting Tuesday. The 
aides said the Nixon adminis-
tration had registered its 
opposition to the bill, thereby 
preventing the current CIA 
director, Richard M. Helms, a 
presidential appointee, from 
taking a position on it. 
Indirect support 
But McCone's testimony is 
sure to be interpreted as in-
direct CIA support of the bill. 
Former directors of the agen-
cy, a loyal and tightly knit 
group, rarely, if ever, take a 
public position that the in-
cumbent director opposes. 
The bill was introduced by 
'Sen. John Sherman Cooper (R-
Ky.) last July, shortly after 
the New York Times, the 
Washington Post, the Sun-
Times and other newspapers 
published the Pentagon pa-
pers. The papers revealed that 
/the CIA consistently expressed 
a skeptical view of Vietnam 
from the Truman to the Nixon 
administrations. Cooper and 
other senators argued that 
Congress might have blocked 
the deep U.S. Involvement if it 
had received the intelligence 
estimates.

Committee, the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, the House

and the House Armed Services

Tuesday's witnesses will be 
Chester Cooper, former in- v 
telligence analyst for the CIA 
and the White House, and Her-
bert Scoville, former head of 
the CIA's research division. 
Sec. of State William P. Rog-
ers, who has assert e.d the 
right to testify for the CIA, has 
been asked to appear after the 
Easter recess to present the 
administration's position. He 
may send a subordinate but 
presumably not Ray Cline, 
head of the department's bu-
il-eau of intelligence and re-
search. 
An ITT director' 
Cline, a former deputy CIA 
direc to r for intelligence, 
recently ? told the committee 
that he favored the distribu-
tion of CIA reports to Congress, 
provided the "sources and 
methods of intelligence gather-
ing" were not jeopardized. 
Cooper insists that his bill pro-
vides adequate protection. 
McCone is scheduled to testi-
fy next month. It may be the 
first in a series of appearances 
before the committee. As a di-
rector of the International 
Telephone & Telegraph Corp., 
he is a potential witness in the 
committee's planned investi-
gation of the involvement 01

vador Allende, a Marxist, as

Fifth of .a series

1,1 NE of the eight black-bound loose-leaf volumes that 
President Nixon studied in preparation for his journey 
to Peking contained a top secret analysis by the Central 
j Intelligence Agency of the strange and still only parti-
ally explained events in China last fall?and the effect 
that the internal power struggle they revealed may 
have on his summit talks with the surviving Communist 
leaders. 
What went on in China in mid-September is still shrouded 
in mystery. Communist cadres in the provinces have been told 
that Defense Minister Lin Piao?until then the regime's no. 2 
man--was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate party Chair-
man Mao Tse-tung and that when toe plot failed, Lin and his 
cohorts were killed in a plane crash in Mongolia suhile trying 
to flee to the Soviet Union. 
A British-built Trident jetliner, one of four purchased by 
? China from Pakistan and used exclusively by high-ranking 
? Chinese officers, did indeed crash in Mongolia, 100 miles be-
yond the Chinese border, on the night of Sept. 12. But American 
analysts doubt that Lin was among the seven men and two 
women whose bodies were recovered from the airplane, burned 
beyond recognition. 
? But it is clear that the power struggle has ended?at least 
.for the time being?and that a moderate faction led by Premier 
Chou En-lai triumphed over a radical faction led by Lin Piao. 
'Lin and hundreds of his followers have beenn purged, but are 
though to be still alive. ? 
Whatever the reasons for the purge, the timing for it seems 
to have been sparked by Chou's invitation to Nixon to visit the 
People's Republic of China. 
, Quarrel over resources 
Despite ARREcniadifari Releasi%20411,06/0A-: 
elusions are probably similar to those of analysts from other. 
, government agencies and from experts outside the government. 
. ? 
For -exainple, Rand Corp. Sinologist William- W. Whitson 
I has come up with a theory fitting the known facts. It suggests 
that the power struggle was the culmination of a debate within 
- the Chinese hierarchy over aiZocation of resources to China's 
nuclear weapons program?and that Chou's victory over Lin 
will make China less of a threat to U.S. allies in Asia in the 
Immediate future than it has been considered in the past. 
Whitson, a military specialist, is one of those China ex-
perts who does research for the government and also maintains 
ties with the academic community. His new book, "The 
Chinese High Command, 1927-1971?a History of Communist 
Military Politics," will be published this spring. 
According to Whitson, Lin Piao vigorously opposed last 
year's decision by Chou?with Mao's concurrence?to reduce 
tensions with the United States. . . 
The reason was that Lin and his supporters in the Air, 
Force and Navy needed the supposed American threat to 
justify development of bigger and bigger nuclear weapons and 
long-range 'missiles to deliver them. 
The cost of China's nuclear and missile programs are 2% 
of the still underdeveloped country's total national product--
so high that Whitson argues that "some people across the river 
euphemism in Washington for CIA headquarters in Lan!4ley, 
.Va.) say that we ought to encourage them to keep at it, because 
it will make them go bankrupt." 
Challenge to Lin 
Whitson's contention is that Chou En-lai, in contrast to Lin, 
recognized that the real threat to China was from Russia?
: which had massed one million troops on China's northern border 
'and threatened a "surgical strike" against Chinese nuclear in-
stallations?instead of from the United States, which the premier 
'could see was in fact withdrawing from Southeast Asia. 
To cope with the Soviet threat, China needed tactical nuclear 
*weapons as well as more modern conventional armament?not 
necessarily long-range ICBMs. Therefore, it is Whitson's belief 
that Chou wanted to slow down the costly advanced weapor s 
program and thus welcomed Nixon's overtures to..end the 23-
year-old confrontation between the United States and Chino. 
- But the invitation to Nixon presented a challenge to Lin and 
the generals associated with pat strategic planning. Whitson 
pits it this way: 
'"To many of the Senior officers of thesecond geher-
. :  
ation, probably including: Lin Piao, Wu Fa-hsien, Li Tso-p'eng 
and Huang Yung-sherg, the historical image of the United 
States as the principal adversary most heavily armed with nu-
clear weapons targeted against China must have been the cor-
nerstone of their premises for strategic planning and weapons 
development. 
"President Nixon's visit to China could not have been a wel-
come shift in the image that had presumably guided their 
strategic thinking for 20 years." . 
Smaller bangs 
Since the mid-1960s, China has exploded 13 nuclear devides, 
including three hydrogen bombs with yields of three megatons 
each, in 1968, 1969 and 1970. But the last two tests, in November, 
1971 and January of this year, were of smaller devices with 
yields of 20 kilotons or less?the size of the Hiroshima A-bomb. 
According to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the 
latest two tests could either have been of triggers for larger 
thermonuclear weapons or of prototypes of comparatively small, 
tactical nuclear warheads. If they were the latter, it would tend 
to confirm Whitsonls theory that 'Chou, after defeating Lin. has ? 
shifted priorities to concentrate on medium and intermediate 
range missiles instead of a costly intercontinental inissile - 
arsenal. 
"Such an emphasis would provide an immediate deterrent
.. 
against the Soviet Union," Whitson says. -It would also promise 
the greatest intercontinental utility once an appropriate sub- ? 
marine or two had been built." 
If Whitson is right, this will be disconcerting to U.S. mil-
itary planners, who have advocated construction of an anti-" 
ballistic missile defense system for protection of the United 
States against Chinese ICBM's expected to be operational as 
-early as 1975, as much as against the nuclear-tipped Soviet 
intercontinental rockets already in their underground silos.

BY STEVVAFrf ALSO.I4 
WASHINGTON?It is highly likely that 
one of these days soon, probably before 
Christmas,. quite possibly before Thanks-
giving, CIA director Richard Helms will 
call the White House and ask for an 
urgent appointment with the President: 
A great deal will then depend on what-
lIelms tells President. Nixon, and what 
'President Nixon delides to do about it. 
Helms, of course, is the No. I. man in 
the U.S. intelligence community. The 
intelligence community is braced for 
"the other shoe to drop." The other shoe 
is-a series of -Soviet missile tests that the 
intelligence specialists are sure?rather 
mysteriously sure?will take place be-
fore the end of this year, most probably . 
in November or earl Y December. . 
These tests will tell a great deal 
about the real purpose of the very 
great Soviet investind-it in offensive 
strategic weapons. This investment is 
the first shoe, and it is 'symbolized by 
the. missile silos?Tholc?s," they are called 
in the intelligence trade?that the Rus-
sians have been constructing with ex-
traordinary urgency throughout this 
year. The tests \\;ill show what kind of 
missilc?s the Russians intend to put in 
their holes. 
PEACE AND THE HOLES 
This is not, admittedly, a subject that 
much interests most people in the pres-
ent, curious mood of this country. But it 
is a subject that has to interest the in-
telligence specialists?and the Presi-
dent, too. For what goes into the Rus-
sian holes may well determine whether 
or not it is rational to hope for what the 
President likes to call "a generation of 
peace." 
The facts about the holes are as fol-
lows (and these facts are indeed facts, 
for the Pentagon's reconnaissance satel-
lites bring back pictures of the holes 
almost as detailed. as a picture of a 
building across the street). A total of 
91 new holes has been dug so far this 
-yeir. Twenty-five of these new holes 
aIC 'very large?larger than the holes 
that used to be dug for the huge, 25-
megaton SS-9 missile. Sixty-six of the 
boles are somewhat smaller than the 
regular SS-9 holes but larger than the 
holes for the 1-megaton SS-11 missile. 
These smaller holes are dug in a big 
drcle, with ten missiles to a circle. In 
STATOTHR 
LI) ? 
? 
.been dug. None of the holes has a's: yet 
been fitted with a missile, and the ex-
perts do not expect them to be opera-
tional until, about July 1972. 
There are no doubt innumerable pa-
pers marked Top Secret filled with de-
tails about the Russian holes, but the 
essential facts are as stated above. 
These faets make it possibh5? for any 
reasonably intelligent reader of this 
magazine to be his own intelligence 
analyst. What are the holes for? 
WHAT ARE THEY FOR? 
R is very unlikoly that they are sim-
ply for more first-generation SS-Os and 
SS-11s. Otherwise, the missiles would 
already be in their holes. They could 
be for improved versions of the SS-9 
and the SS-11: Or they could be for 
entirely new weapons. 
, It seems reasonable to suppose that 
the Russians want to do .one thing to 
improve the SS-9, and another thing to 
improve the SS-11. The SS-9, or an en-
tirely new version of the big missile, 
could be provided with multiple war-
heads, or "NfIlWed." Because its war-
head is so immense, the missile Could 
be 1\.11RVed six, or even ten times over. 
Given sufficient accuracy, even a rela-
tively small number of NIIRVed multi-
megaton missiles could be used to 
destroy, in a first strike, this country's 
main strategic deterrent?our- 1,000 
land-basecl Minuteman missiles. 
Greatly improved accuracy for the 
SS-] 1, or some new version of such a 
missile, would have -a similar effect. The 
SS-11 is an "anti-city" weapon; it is only 
roughly accurate, since only rough ac-
curacy is required to destroy a city 
with a 1-megaton warhead. But if it 
could be rendered accurate enough to 
dig a Minuteman missile out of its con-
crete silo, then it too would become a 
direct threat to our strategic deterrent. 
How about the enormous new .holes?? 
The reader's guess may be. as good as 
the specialists', for the specialists do 
not pretend to have the. answer. These 
huge holes could be foii hardened con-
trol centers. Or they could be for some 
new kind of offensive strategic missile, 
perhaps filled with penetration aids to 
? blind the U.S. defense, perhaps with an 
? enormous warhead designed . to black 
out the defense's radar and. Control sys-
STATOTHR ? 
most as much as they tell the Russians 
about such factors -as accuracy, range 
and niegatonnag,e. Suppose the tests 
'show (a) a MIRVccl SS-9-type missile, 
(b) greatly improved accuracy for the 
SS-11-type missile, and (e) an entirely, 
new offensive strategic missile of im-
mense size. Even if the .tests showed 
only one or two of these things, Rich-
ard helms would have to ask for that 
urgent appointment with the President. 
What the President do then? 
. Already, it is too late to talk about 
missile parity." The Russians have 
1,600 intercontinental missiles against 
1,051 American missiles, and in terms 
of missile megatonnage, they have be-
tween five and ten times the thermonu-
clear capacity we have: Their anti-bal-
listic-missile complex is fully operational 
in the Moscow area and being urgently 
Wended, whereas our ABM system 
will not be operational for several years. 
A NEW CONFRONTATION 
They are ready to produce. an entire-
ly .new swept-wing attack bomber, with 
an undoubted "anti-U.S. attack capabil-
ity," whereas our B-52s are Model T 
bombers, terribly vulnerable to the new 
SA-5 Soviet anti-aircraft. The Soviet 
Y-class nuclear submarine fleet of 41. 
boats now equals Ours, and instead of 
halting production, the Russians have, 
doubled their production capacity. The 
Soviet conventional fleet is already in 
several categories superior to ours. 
The new Soviet missile tests could 
indicate at least the serious possibility 
that the Soviets are building up for a 
new eyeball-to-eyeball nuclear con-
frontation, like the 1962 Cuban crisis, 
in which it would be our turn to blink. 
The likely locale of the confrontation is 
obvious?the Middle East; It is easy to 
dismiss this possibility as mere Pentagon. 
propaganda. But it is also silly. 
. The intelligence analysts, including, 
the Pentagon s, have consistently un-
derestimated the Soviet Missile pro--

future may be at stake. If he were. to

CIA: CONGtil]SS IN D 
Since ? the Central Intelligence Agency was given 
authority in 1949 to operate without.. normal legislative 
oversight, an uneasy tension has existed between an un-
informed Congress and an uninformative CIA. 
In the last two decades nearly 200 bills aimed at 
making the CIA more accountable to the legislative 
branch have been introduced. Two such bills have been 
reported from committee. None has been adopted. 
The push is on again. Some members of Congress 
are insisting they should know more about the CIA and 
j-about what the CIA knows. The clandestine military 
operations in Laos run by the CIA appear to .be this 
year's impetus. 
Sen. Stuart Symington -(D Mo.), a member of the 
Armed Services Intelligence Operations Subcommittee 
and chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee 
dealing with U.S. commitments abroad, briefed the 
Senate June 7 behind closed doors on how deeply the 
CIA was involved' in the Laotian turmoil, tie based his 
briefing on .a staff report. (Weehly Report p. 1709, 1660, 
1268) 
Ile told the Senate in that closed session: "In all my 
committees there is no real knowledge of what is going on 
in Laos.?We do not know the cost of the bombing. We do 
not know about the .people we maintain there. It is a 
secret war." 
As a member of two key subcommittees dealing with 
the activities of the CIA, Symington should be privy to 
more classified information about the agency than most 
other members of Congress. But Symington told the Sen-
ate he. had to dispatch two committee staff members to 
Laos in order to find out what the CIA was doing. 
If Symington does not know what the CIA has been 
doing, then what kind of oversight function does Congress 
exercise over the super-secret organization? (Secrecy 
fact sheet, Weehly Report p. 1785) 
A Congressional Quarterly examination of the over-
sight system exercised by the legislative branch, a study 
of sanitized secret documents relating to the CIA and 
interviews with key staff members and members of Con-
gress indicated that the real power to gain knowledge 
about. CIA activities and expenditures rests in the bands 
Of four powerful committee chairmen and several key 
members of their committees?Senate and House Armed 
Services and Appropriations Committees. 
he extent to which these men exercise their power 
in ferreting out the details of what the CIA does with its 
secret appropriation determines the quality of legislative 
oversight on this executive agency that Congress voted 
into existence 24 years ago. 
The CIA Answers to... 
As established by the National Security Act .of 1947 
(PL 80-253), the Central Intelligence Agency was ac-
countable to the President and the ?NalIbnal Security 
\ BO U`iACTVTUS, .2')Ei N Dh 1 G 
STATOTHR 
Council. In the original Act there was no language which 
excluded the agency from scrutiny by Congress, but also 
no provision which required such examination. 
? To clear up any confusion as to the legislative intent 
of the 1947 law, Congress passed the 1949 Central Intel-
ligence Act (PL 81-110) which exempted the CIA from all 
federal laws requiring disclosure of the "functions, names, 
official titles, salaries or numbers of personnel" employed 
by the agency. The law gave the CIA director power to 
spend money "without regard to the provisions of law 
and regulations relating to the expenditure of govern-
ment-funds." Since the CIA became a functioning organi-
zation in 1949, its budgeted funds have been submerged 
into the general accounts of other government agencies, 
hidden from the scrutiny of the public and all but a se-
lect group of ranking members of Congress. (Congress 
and the Nation Vol. I, p. 306, 249) 
Tlii SENATE 
In the Senate, the system by which committees 
check on CIA activities and budget requests is straight-
forward. Nine men?on two committees?hold positions 
of seniority which allow them to participate in the regular 
annual legislative oversight function. Other committees 
are briefed by the CIA, but only on. topical matters and 
not on a regular basis. 
Appropriations. William W. Woodruff, counsel 
for the Senate Appropriations Committee' and the only 
staff man for the oversight subcommittee, *explained that 
when the CIA comes before the five-man subcommittee, 
more is discussed than just the CIA's budget. 
"We look to the CIA for the best intelligence on the 
Defense Department budget that you can get," Woodruff 
told Congressional Quarterly. He said that CIA Director 
Richard Helms provided the subcommittee with his 
estimate of budget needs for all government intelligence 
operations. ? 
Woodruff explained that although the oversight 
subcommittee was responsible for reviewing the CIA bud- ? 
get, any -substantive legislation dealing with the agency 
would originate In the Armed Services Committee, not 
Appropriations. 
? No transcripts are kept when the CIA representative 
(usually Behns) testifies before the subcommittee. Wood-
ruff said the material: covered in the hearings was so 
highly classified that any transcripts would have to be 
kept under armed guard 24 hours a day. Woodruff does 
take detailed notes on the sessions, however, which are 
held for him by the CIA. "All I have to do is call," he 
said, "and they're on my desk in an hour." 
Armed Services. "The CIA budget itself does not 
legally -require any review by Congress," said T. Edward 
Braswell, chief counsel for the Senate Armed Services 
Committee and the only staff man used by the Intelli-
gence Operations Subcommittee.
