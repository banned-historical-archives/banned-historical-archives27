 STAFFING PROCEDURES AND PROBLEMS IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 I.    I NTRODUCT I ON
 This is a study of the theory and practice of
 personnel management in Communist China.- It endeavors
 to draw together information on how Chinese skilled
 manpower and talent are selected, motivated, advanced
 and organized in the pursuit of national goals.   It
 begins with a consideration of personnel requirements
 at the senior levels of the party, surveying the broad
 functions performed and sketching out the background
 and character of the incumbents.  It then takes a look
 at the mechanics for staffing various echelons of,:the
 party.  This is followed by an examination of how.the
 party actually handles its personnel.
 These chapters are followed by a discussion, ar-
 ranged along similar lines, of the requirements for
 top government executives, the system of government
 personnel administration and how it operates in prac-
 tice.  A special chapter is devoted to the armed'forces.
 Later chapters take up in turn the educational
 system and the means used by the leaders to communi-
 cate with lower levels of the administrative apparatus
 and the Chinese people.  The concluding section is a
 general assessment of the strengths and weaknesses
 of the whole system.
 Several characteristics of the Chinese Commun-
 ists' approach to this problem are, we think, deserv-
 ing of special mention.
 1.  A striking feature of the Chinese system,
 even in comparison with its Soviet counterpart, is
 the pervasiveness of party control and manipulation.
 Positions of real authority anywhere in China'are
 Without exception held by party members.   In fact,
 no level of government, no military, scientific,
 economic or educational organization, no activity
 of any moment is without its party group, the mem-
 bers of which effectively run the unit.  Advance-
 ment is unlikely if the party does not approve.
 2.    .Stability in the highest reaches of the
 party has been unusual for a system which in other

 places has bred frequent change.  Mao Tse-tung has
 been the dominant figure for nearly three decades.
 He has kept around him a group of associates he
 trusts.  Today, these men are old and overworked.
 They present an all but immovable roadblock against
 aspirants to high office.  And it has also proven
 a difficult matter to insinuate new concepts, es-
 pecially in technical fields,,,,,.into the policy making
 process. The leaders tend to turn for advice to
 party figures who share the experiences and prej-
 udices of the leaders.
 3.  Personnel management is highly centralized.
 The system allows the men who determine national
 security programs to commit available talent to these
 programs in complete freedom.  There is no outside
 competition for talent.
 4.  China is, however, very short of top-flight
 talent--administrators, managers, scientific research-
 ers, tutors for graduate students, technicians, etc.
 Still the Chinese leaders misuse what they do have by
 a dogmatic refusal to trust fully those educated a-
 broad, whether in the USSR or the West, and by forc-
 ing everyone to spend much time in political indoc-
 trination.
 5.  These political indoctrination programs and
 the absolute control of all media of communication
 permit the leaders to disseminate only such informa-
 tion as they think fitting.  This has contributed
 to a unity of purpose throughout the system and a
 willingness to work hard at tasks set by the leaders,
 though the degree of dedication today is not what it
 was several years ago.

 II.        STAFFING THE PARTY
 National security policy in Communist China is
 directed to building China over the shortest histori-
 cal span possible into a strong, modern leader of na-
 tions with all the paraphernalia of power that implies..
 The goal is a China respected for its military and po-
 litical power, honored for its culture, turned to for
 its principled interpretation of Communist doctrine;
 in short, a China restored to its rightful leading
 role in the world.  The present leaders are dedicated
 to the proposition that this can only be done through
 the development of an authoritarian, Communist system
 of government in China.
 The Chinese Communist Party, in power throughout
 mainland China since 1949, is still in the early phases
 of a big construction effort.  The attempts of the lead-
 ers in 1958-1960 to accelerate the process through "leap
 forward" practices were a dismal failure.  The country
 is groping its way out of the rubble of that disaster.
 It did not, however, shake the leadership out of the
 conviction that Its cause and course are correct.  Nor
 has it shaken the present leaders from their dominant
 positions.
 Staffing Requirements at Senior Levels
 Ultimate power, in the Chinese Communist system,
 rests in one man, whose qualities determine in great
 measure how the whole will operate.  That man now is
 Mao Tse-tung, father figure of the Chinese Communist
 movement.  The guiding principles and the programs
 by which the nation operates are in the final analysis
 his responsibility.  Many issues can, of course, be
 settled short of Mao, but he is the final arbiter.
 During the nearly three decades of Mao's steward-
 ship, the Chinese party has been transformed from a
 small, hunted band of revolutionaries fleeing to the
 barren hills of northwestern China into the ruling
 element of the largest single group of people on the
 face of the globe.  This record of success has made,
 and continues to make, effective challenge of Mao a
 very difficult proposition.
 To the Chinese party, Mao is the "greatest revolu-
 tionary and statesman in Chinese history", and the most
 prominent communist "among all living contemporaries."

 Public speeches by Mao's foremost associates bristle
 with fulsome tributes to Mao's insights, wisdom and
 knowledge.  Practicing experts in virtually any
 field--ideological, economic, military, literary,
 scientific--are advised to improve themselves by
 studying Mao's works.  Chinese policies in all these
 fields are presented as owing much to the master.
 Mao Tse-tung, born the son of a rich peasant,
 has been a member of the Chinese Communist Party
 since it was formed in 1921, and has been its
 leader since 1935.  He is a man of supreme self-
 confidence.  For years he has shown an ability
 to adapt Marxist-Leninist formulas to suit his
 own purposes as well as a certain talent for mak-
 ing the right decision at the right time.
 This talent may perhaps be diminishing; at
 least, his more recent initiatives have not been
 notably successful.  The great leap forward, the
 commune movement and the challenge to the Soviets
 have all proved singularly inappropriate to China's
 needs at this stage of its development.
 Mao is widely read in the literature of Marxism-
 Leninism.  He writes well, frequently in a breezy
 style full of pithy language which appeals to Chi-
 nese.                         He has been able to attract and hold com-
 petent subordinates, and has shown an ability to
 balance them off, one against the other.
 He has been outside China only twice, in 1950
 and 1957, both times to the Soviet Union.  His knowl-
 edge and understanding of the outside world are lim-
 ited.                         His grasp of internal Chinese conditions may
 be slipping.  Rumors have been trickling out of
 China for the past several years that Mao's health
 has been declining.  Whatever the state of his
 powers, Mao's speeches and writings have diminished
 quite remarkably since about 1957.  In recent years,
 he has spent a good deal of time in various vaca-
 tions spots away from the levers of power in Peiping.
 Standing just behind Mao in the power structure
 are his six colleagues on the Standing Committee of
 the Politburo.  This inner circle of advisors joins
 Mao in developing, formulating and coordinating
 China's domestic, foreign and defense. policies.

 are widely experienced in party, state and military
 affairs.  They are expected to look at issues which
 come before them in a comprehensive, overall way.
 They must watch the whole chessboard, not just one
 of the pieces.  Each of them, however, does appear
 to have a broad area of specialization.  Liu Shad-
 chi and Teng Hsiao-ping seem to give the greater
 measure of their attention the theoretical and
 practical concerns of the party.  Chou E n-lai's
 chief concern is the government and its foreign
 relations.  Lin Piao concentrates on military af-
 fairs.  Chu Teh, generally inactive, sometimes
 serves as a spokesman for Mao.  Chen Yun spends
 most of his time on economic matters, though he
 has been out of the public eye for some time now.
 These are men with a long history of devotion
 to the hierarch, men who have thrived on decades
 of the vicious in-fighting which characterizes
 the system, men who are tough and ruthless, men
 who speak a common language and hold common views.
 They are men who have been conditioned by many
 years of party work to understand the time for
 debate and the limits placed thereon.  The effec-
 tive operation of the entire structure requires
 that the men at this level be tightly knit.  They
 must know how and when to submerge differences
 and show a common purpose to the other layers
 of the party and to the people at large.
 The continuity of this group is remarkable
 for a system which in other countries and parties
 has bred frequent bloody change.  Turnover has
 been limited.  The five men who were on the party
 Secretariat in 1945 are still formally in the
 inner circle today.
 Ranking next to Mao is Liu Shao-chi.  To some,
 he appears a classic example of the faithful serv-
 ant.  They point to his speeches with their many
 sycophantic passages, and speculate that he will
 not long outlast Mao.  However, Liu does wield
 great power in the party organization.  Mao has
 complete confidence in Liu's abilities and has
 made Liu his heir apparent.  The party presents
 him as its leading theoretician, next to Mao.
 His 1939 work, How to be a Good Communist, was
 recently re-issu`ec and mane a subject of a
 special party study campaign.

 Liu is a somber and a somewhat colorless indi-
 vidual.  After he was selected to succeed Mao as
 head of government in 1959, an attempt was made
 by the party's propaganda organs to paint a more
 engaging public picture of him.  The campaign
 seems to have died away with doubtful results.
 Liu's closest collaborator in party matters
 is Teng Hsiao-ping, one of the youngest members
 of the inner circle.  Teng has risen rapidly in
 favor and prestige since the mid-fifties.  In
 recent years he has been the party's chosen spokes-
 man on a number of key issues, and in 1960 played
 a large part in the Moscow conference of commun-
 ist parties.
 A short, bullet-headed man, Teng is said to
 be hard-driving and aggressive.  The party obvi-
 ously regards him as a good organizer and sound
 administrator.  His several strategic positions
 in the central apparatus give him powerful levers
 over party matters.
 Chou En-lai, the only premier the Chinese
 Communist government has ever had, is perhaps
 the best known of the Chinese Communists in the
 West. Handsome and urbane, Chou for years was
 the principal face which the Chinese Communists
 turned to the world.  He has travelled more than
 his colleagues in the inner circle and he may,.
 as a result, have a more sophisticated view of
 the outer world.  He is by all accounts a skilled
 and resourceful negotiator.  He showed at the
 Bandung Conference in 1955 and in an early visit
 to India that he is quite expert at building up
 an aura of Chinese goodwill.
 What should not be lost sight of is that
 Chou is also a veteran communist, a high-rank-
 ing member of the party for at least four decades.
 He was once ranked ahead of Mao and has shown
 a remarkable agility in getting along with who-
 ever happens to be in power.  Chou's wife is
 the number two woman in the party.
 The other active member of the inner circle
 is Lin Piao.  He is the youngest. A military man
 for his entire career, Lin had apparently been

 Approved For Release 2000/05/24: CIA-RDP65B00383R000200030002-7
 ailing for a number of years.  He leapt back into
 prominence following the disgrace of Peng Teh-huai
 in 1959.  Lin was one of the most successful generals
 produced by the Chinese Communists in their fight
 against the Chinese Nationalists.  His return coin-
 cided with a renewed emphasis on the supremacy of
 the party over the military.
 The Politburo and Secretariat
 Standing just outside this inner circle are
 the remaining full (voting) members of the Polit-
 buro.  This body has considerable importance as
 an advisory board, a discussion group and, some-
 times, as a voting body.  Decisions taken by the
 Standing Committee have the full force of a Polit-
 buro decision, but Politburo sanction may well be
 sought for major policy shifts.  Meaningful voting
 in the Politburo is probably restricted to issues
 on which Mao and his inner circle have not staked
 out a definite position.
 The advice of Politburo members is likely to
 be sought prior to decision on a matter in which
 the individual member is expert.  All nineteen of
 the voting members are men with a record of thirty
 to forty years of faithful service to the party.
 They represent a variety of backgrounds and are
 capable of providing advice in many fields.  Here
 appear the top specialists in various aspects of
 party work:   Peng Chen has long been in party
 organizational work and has represented the party
 at important communist meetings abroad.  Tung Pi-wu
 is engaged in supervisory work, Tan Chen-lin is
 concentrating on agricultural matters, Lo Jung-
 huan is a senior figure in party control work in
 the armed forces.  Chen Yi, Li Fu-chun and Li
 Hsien-nien are the party's top specialists, re-
 spectively, in the government's foreign, economic
 planning and financial affairs.  Ko Ching-shah and
 Li Ching-chuan are the top leaders in East and
 Southwest China and may bring regional points of
 view into the Politburo.
 No additions to the Politburo have been an-
 nounced since 1958.  Good bets for election to
 the next Politburo are Tao Chu and Sung Jen-chiung,
 heads of the Central-South and Northeast party bu-
 reaus, respectively.

 Since Mao took over in 1935, only three men of
 Politburo rank can confidently be said to have been
 purged; Chang Kuo-tao shortly afterwards, Kao Kang
 in 1954 and Peng Teh-huai in 1959.  Several have
 been demoted, others have died, but seven members of
 to present Politburo were. on the 11-man body elected
 in 1945.
 The presence of a number of party elders in
 these key groups should not be misconstrued.  Though
 they are relatively inactive, they do serve a definite
 purpose by providing automatic support for Mao on any
 matters put before them.
 Another key top,level body is. the Secretariat,
 the executive office of the party for day-to-day
 operations.   It is under the direction of the Stand-
 ing Committee and the Politburo, and differs from
 these bodies largely in that it is, formally, a
 full-time body.  Although the counsel of its mem-
 bers is probably sought before new policy is finali-
 zed, the Secretariat's main task is to monitor the
 execution of decisions taken by its parent bodies.
 The Secretariat may well be the party's instrument-
 ality for directing and coordinating the party's
 central departments.
 The ranking official on the Secretariat is
 Teng Hsiao-ping.  His four leading associates are
 all Politburo figures--peng Chen, Li Fu-chun, Li
 Hsien-nien and Tan Chen-lin.  Also included are
 Lo Jui-ching, who is Chief of Staff of the armed
 forces and a long-time security expert; Kang Sheng,
 an intelligence man; Lu Ning-yi and Hu Chiao-mu,
 propaganda experts; Li Hsueh-feng, industrial
 matters; Liu Lan-tao, organizational and control
 matters within the party; Wang Chia-hsiang, who
 was once involved.in liaison with other parties
 but has not been active lately; and, Yang Shang-
 kun, who holds several top administrative posi-
 tions.   Lo Jui-ching, Fang Sheng and Lu Ning-yi
 were added to the Secretariat by the tenth plenum
 of the Central Committee in September 1962.
 The Second Level
 The Central Committee itself, nominally 97
 full and 95 alternate members, has functioned under
 Mao as a rubber stamp body, convened to be instructed

 concerning decisions taken by the dominant leaders.
 By the time it meets the needs of the top command
 for expert advice have been met and the line in
 all essentials has been set.   It could, as has
 happened in the Soviet party, emerge as an important
 deliberative body if an issue arose on which the
 leaders were critically divided.
 An individual's rank within the Central Com-
 mittee is important as his mark of preferment.
 The party's central departments provide the
 staff to prepare position papers on matters coming
 before the policy makers and to oversee, under the
 direction of the Standing Committee and the Secre-
 tariat, the party's day-to-day operations.  The
 men who run these departments are in charge of the
 party's interests in propaganda, police, rural, in-
 dustrial, finance and trade, communications, united
 front, and party organization work as well as liai-
 son with foreign parties.  They make many of the
 daily decisions on how party policies are to be
 executed within their areas of competence.  They
 are in a sense going through the last and highest
 training course which the party offers its future
 leaders.
 The committees (really sub-committees) under
 the Central Committee are on the same level as the
 departments but differ in that they tend to meet
 irregularly as the occasion or the leaders demand.
 Like other committees, they probably have permanent
 standing bodies.   Included are the Committee for
 Organs Directly Subordinate to the Central Com-
 mittee, the Committee for Central State Organs
 and the Women's Work Committee.
 Two important commissions, the Control Com-
 mission and the Military Affairs Commission, also
 come just under the Central Committee on party
 organization charts.  They are discussed belowl
 The top levels of the party are nicely layered
 according to age and party seniority.  Virtually
 all of the top leaders went through the crucible
 of the Long March, a 6,000-mile hegira in 1934-1936
 which transferred the party's base from Kiangsi to

 Shensi Province.  The Long Marchers are getting on.
 Mao is almost 70 and most of his key advisers are
 over 60.  The new generation will probably be domi-
 nated by another brand of Communist whose forma-
 tive years in the party were in the fight against
 the Japanese.
 After they take over, it is possible that many
 of the old Maoist ways will go.  The new group will
 very likely not have the remarkable measure of cohe-
 siveness of Mao's group.  Most of the new men, in-
 cluding its leading figures, will have made their
 mark in the party apparatus.  It is possible, how-
 ever, that by the time the new group gets entrenched
 officials who have made their mark in economic,
 scientific or other specialities will begin to
 exert greater influence in high policy making levels.
 The Party and the State
 In Communist China the party's field of direct
 interest and influence extends into every nook and
 cranny of the government and military establish-
 ment, of every economic or scientific installation,
 of every education institution.   "The party must,
 and can, lead all--the state organs, the armed
 forces, the people's bodies," runs a typical in-
 struction to party workers.
 Party control is brought to bear by the as-
 signment of trusted party members to positions,
 usually of authority, in all non-party organiza-
 tions.  Called "leading members' groups", they
 are assigned by an appropriate party committee.
 The Central Committee determines the make up of
 the "leading members' groups" in central govern-
 ment offices; provincial committees do the same
 for the provincial governments, county committees
 for the counties.  These "leading members' groups"
 remain under the direction of their assigning com-
 mittees, not under a "leading members' group" in
 a superior non-party organization.
 The party has a number of full-time workers
 who perform no job outside the party, but the
 majority work in government offices, in the mili-
 tary, in economic and cultural establishments,
 or in people's organizations.  They remain under
 strict party discipline.  Failure to detect and

 report without delay the slightest shortcoming,
 from the party's point of view, would open them
 to serious charges.
 The pattern of party influence brought to
 bear by party members is repeated at the working
 level.  Every basic level installation, be it
 factory, mine, collective farm, or military
 unit, has its own party organization appointed
 by an appropriate party committee.   It is the
 duty of the party organizations to transmi 'g
 party policy and see to it that the policy is
 understood and implemented completely.  They
 must adapt. the policies, as necessary, to local
 conditions.
 The Structure for Staffing Party Organizations
 The Leading Bodies
 The 1956 party constitution declares that
 the National Party Congress is the "highest lead-
 ing body" of the party.   It is elected.  But the
 timing of its election, the number of delegates,
 and the manner in which they are elected are con-
 trolled by the "in" group.  The "in's" reserve to
 themselves the right to run members of superior
 party organizations "who need to be elected" in
 local elections.  They also can cancel the elec-
 tion of anyone they deem "inadequate."  The present
 Eighth Congress was elected in 1956 for a term of
 five years.   It is still in office.   Its opening
 session was attended by just over 1,000 delegates.
 The party's first congress, in 1921, was attended
 by twelve.
 A party congress provides a forum for the
 airing of party policies, but its most important
 task is to elect a Central Committee to act for
 it when it is not in session.  The importance of
 this. provision derives from the infrequency with
 which National Party Congresses are convened.
 The Eighth has met but twice, in 1956 and 1958,
 despite provisions in the party constitution,
 which it adopted, that it meet once a year.   In
 fact, during the six and one-half years it has
 been in office it has met in session for a grand
 total of 32 days.
 Approved For Release 2000/05/24: CIA-RDP65B00383R000200030002-7
 Approved For Release 2000/05/24: CIA-RDP65B00383R000200030002-7
 The present Central Committee, the eighth,
 came to office in 1956, the result of a carefully
 contrived electoral process designed by the party
 center to bring minimal disturbance to the then
 existing hierarchical arrangements.   It was an
 "election with leadership."  The top leaders de-
 cided on the number of candidates who would stand
 for election, named them and arranged the elec-
 toral lists in proper order of precedence.
 All of this took a lot of arranging, and may
 have prompted a leading party figure to warn that
 "too many elections are unnecessary and may handi-
 cap our work."  The party has generally followed
 his advice.
 Theoretically at least, ultimate authority
 for the disposition of important personnel matters
 rests in the Central Committee.  The 1956 party
 constitution spells this out:   the Central Com-
 mittee, it states, "takes charge of and allocates
 party cadres."   (The term cadre, in Chinese kanpu,
 is applied by the Chinese Communists to officials
 and functionaries in both the party and the govern-
 ment and is used in either an individual or a group
 sense.)  When the Central Committee is not in ple-
 nary session, its powers and functions, including
 those involving the disposition of cadres, pass to
 the Politburo, its Standing Committee and the Secre-
 tariat, all elected by the Central Committee.  The
 Eighth Central Committee has met in plenary session
 ten times for a total of some 75 days since 1956.
 In practice, therefore, its authority over
 cadre regulation is delegated to its continuing
 bodies.   The highest authority in personnel, as
 in all other matters, doubtless rests with Mao
 Tse-tung,  It is likely that Mao still takes an
 active interest in assignments to key positions,
 since any other course could carry grave dangers
 for him.  A number of lesser personnel actions
 may ultimately be referred to him for decision.
 There is bound, for example, to be serious competi-
 tion among various departments of China's national
 security  setup  for skilled manpower and managerial
 talent, which are among the nation's scarcest re-
 sources.

 .He is very likely assisted in his delibera-
 tions on these matters by his four active assist-
 ants on the Standing Committee with Liu Shao-chi
 and Teng Hsiao-ping representing the party's in-
 terests, Chou En-lai the government's and Lin Piao
 those of the military establishment.  Communist
 China is not known to have a system, as do the
 Soviets, which specifies just which non-party
 jobs require the stamp of approval of what party
 body.  The Chinese system is in general highly
 centralized, and the Standing Committee may well
 require that it pass on all recommendations for
 appointments to key jobs in the party central
 organs, in the government's top bodies, in eco-
 nomic, cultural and scientific enterprises of
 national security significance, in the armed
 forces and in the regions and provinces.  The
 Standing Committee doubtless reserves for itself
 the right to determine just what constitutes a
 "key" assignment requiring its O.K.
 In acting on proposals for filling "key"
 jobs, Mao and the Standing Committee rely heavily
 upon the Secretariat, through which related per-
 sonnel records and data are channeled.  As the
 directing and coordinating agency for the regular
 central organizations of the party, the Secretariat
 can probably approve on its own appointments to a
 range of positions below those on which the Stand-
 ing Committee and Mao act.   In any case, the princi-
 pal figure on the Secretariat, Teng Hsiao-ping, is
 also in Mao's inner circle, a circumstance which
 doubtless gives him vast authority in the personnel
 field.  He is, at a minimum, the needle's eye through
 which a man must pass on his way to a position of
 real authority:
 Teng's assistants on the Secretariat oversee
 the work of one or another of the party's central
 organs and through them exert considerable influence
 on central government offices.  These assistants
 are very likely responsible for advising Teng and
 the Secretariat on those aspects of a candidate's
 party standing and qualifications which fall within
 the competence of their particular departments.
 They can probably act directly on a certain level
 of position within their own areas.  Most of these
 secretaries have had long experience in party organi-
 zational work.

 The Central Departments
 Neither the Standing Committee, the Politburo
 nor the Secretariat is Sufficiently rich in per
 sonnel to discharge in detail the constitutional
 charge which devolves on them "to take charge of
 and allocate cadres."  The size of this job is
 suggested by the fact that in 1956, the last year
 for which figures are at hand, there were over
 3 0,000.party cadres at the county committee level
 add higher.  The 1963 total is surely higher.  So,
 again, much of the function is delegated to bodies
 which the Central Committee has set up, and staffed,
 to be its executive agents in its "diverse businesses."
 Among these are the Organization Department, the Con-
 trol Commission, the Committee for Party Organs Di-
 rectly Subordinate to the Central Committee, and the
 Committee for Central State Organs.  Other central
 departments play lesser roles.
 The Organization Department, though no longer
 the power it once was, still plays a strong hand in
 the administration of patty cadres.  Prior to 1954,
 it controlled most aspects of party personnel manage-
 ment.   It had responsibility for recruitment, train-
 ing, assignment, promotion, transfer of party cadres
 as well as the maintenance of party personnel records,
 the collection of party dues and the investigation
 of party members' reliability.   In 1954 the party
 elders discovered that the then chief of the Organi-
 zation Department, Jao Shu-shih, had been attempting
 to use the office to unseat them.  He was removed
 forthwith, and the Organization Department was shorn
 of many of its powers.
 A 1959 study, written by the Research Office
 of the post-Jao Organization Department for the use
 of its cadres, explains the role of the Organization
 Department as that of a "deputy and staff chief" to
 party committees for cadre administration.  The study
 is studded with warnings that the Organization Depart-
 ment ought not "stick its nose into the proper busi-
 ness of others."  It must, rather, keep to its "own
 share" of the administration of party cadres and
 party members.
 This share is not inconsiderable.  The study
 explains that the Organization Department remains
 active in the selection, promotion and training of
 party cadres and in "developing" party members.

 It still handles the records of party personnel.  It
 probably still has much to do with the placement of
 party men in positions which the higher levels, the
 Secretariat and the Standing Committee, do not keep
 in their own hands.
 The present head of the Organization Department
 is An Tzu-wen, who was a deputy under Jao but defi-
 nitely not his accomplice.  An was once Minister of
 Personnel of the Central.Government, and played a
 large part in the big initial effort to staff the
 new government (1950-1954).
 Some of the functions formerly given the Organi-
 zation Department have probably been entrusted to the
 .Committee for Party Organs . Directly Subordinate to
 the Central Committee.  Little has been said about
 this unit, but its name suggests it was conceived
 to supervise the party's central organs, keep them
 informed on policy matters, and, perhaps, to assist
 in handling their ordinary staffing needs.  It is
 headed by Yang Shang-kun, who is concurrently Director
 of the Central Committee's General Office and an alter-
 nate secretary of the Secretariat.  Like An Tzu-wen,
 Yang is not a party heavyweight.  He has seemed, ra-
 ther, to be a trustworthy administrative functionary
 who sees to the routine office tasks of the Central
 Committee, handles correspondence and maintains re-
 cords.
 Other of theold Organization Department's func-
 tions probably-went to the Committee for Central State
 Organs, which is believed to regulate the work of
 party members who have been placed in jobs with the
 central government.  It is not known how big a role
 this committee plays in the assignment, promotion
 or transfer of party members in the government.
 The pattern could possibly be an advisory role for
 higher positions, a more assertive role for lower
 ones.  The committee is headed by Kung Tzu-jung,
 who is concurrently an alternate member of the Con-
 trol Commission, Yang's deputy in the General Office
 and a Deputy Secretary General of the State Council.
 The Control Commission
 A principal element of Jao's power in the old
 Organization Department, that of investigating, the
 loyalty of party members, has passed entirely to the

 Control Commission.  The 1945 party constitution
 had provided for the establishment of both central
 and local control commissions, but prior to 1955 they
 were never set up.   In their stead, a system of
 discipline inspection teams was established.  They
 were empowered to deal with specific breaches of
 party discipline only after they had occurred.
 The inadequacy of these arrangements was clearly
 exposed by the case of Kao Kang and Jao Shu-shih,
 two prominent party figures who were expelled from
 the party in 1954 for trying to split the party
 and usurp supreme power.  The party conference
 which expelled the pair also decided to establish
 strong control commissions, at both the central
 and local levels.  The new commissions were given
 the power to investigate a party member before a
 breach of discipline took place.  They were c arged
 with preventing a recurrence of so serious a case
 as the "anti-party alliance" of Kao Kang and Jao
 Shu-shih.  Unlike the earlier discipline inspection
 teams, the new commissions were specifically em-
 powered by the conference to checkup on party
 organizations, though'discipline was to be meted
 out on an individual basis.
 Working under the direction of party committees
 at the same level, control commissions take disci-
 plinary action against party members. and review
 sentences meted out by lower levels,  They do not
 concern themselves with the minor day-to-day de-
 relictions still handled by the Orginization,De-
 partment.  They are interested in major discipli-
 nary problems like anti-Maoist plotting, and are
 obviously immensely important in the party security
 setup.  Their influence on cadre selection is
 likely to be large negative-  'A party member
 coming under their purview is not a good candi-
 date for further advancement.
 The central Control Commission is an elite
 group.  It is set somewhat apart from other of the
 party's central departments and committees in that
 its leadifig personnel are elected.  The Commission
 was "strengthened" by the election of additional,
 but unnamed, new members at the tenth plenum of
 the Central Committee, September 1962.  It has a
 priority claim on personnel and its staff apparatus
 appears to be one of the best developed of any
 central party organ.  It has been headed since

 in the Central Committee and is the first Vice
 Chairman of the Government. Among Tung's princi-
 pal deputies is Liu Lan-tao, who combines a posi-
 tion on the commission with being a member of the
 powerful Secretariat.  Another is a high ranking
 officer in the General Political Department of
 the Army, the office charged with the political
 indoctrination of.the army.  A third was until
 1960 Minister of Interior (previously Minister
 of Supervision).  The three would seem to be the
 principal figures in overseeing the conduct of
 members working respectively, in the party, the
 military establishment and the government.
 Other central organs which play a role in
 personnel management include the Propaganda De-
 partment,? which handles the education and indoc-
 trination of party members.  This..3s an immense
 job on which the Chinese Party lavishes time,
 money and effort.  The Propaganda Department is
 headed by Lu Ting-yi, who is also a member of
 the Secretariat.  The Social Affairs Department
 plays a shadowy and unexplained role in the
 never-ending job of policing the party.  Li Ko-
 Hung was the head of this organ until his death
 in 1961.  It may have declined in importance
 since his death.
 The Women's Work Committee keeps an eye on
 the interests of female party members.  Roughly
 10 percent of party members are women, although.
 the percentage drops sharply as you move up in
 the hierarchy.  There are, for example, only
 four women on the Central Committee.  The ranking
 female comrade, Tsai Chang (Mrs. Li Fu--chun), is
 also head of the Women's Work Committee.  The
 committee works.t.o overcome "discrimination" a-
 gainst women cadres and see that they get the
 same opportunities for advancement as male cadres.
 "Some organizations." Tsai Chang once complained,
 "tend to promote more men than women even when
 choosing between persons of equal competence."
 The United Front Department takes charge of the
 party's relations with cooperating organizations
 and nationalities groups.  It probably has some

 say in-the selection of individuals from such
 organizations for various posts.
 Regional,. Provincial and County Posts
 The constitution permits the Central Com-
 mittee of the party, as it deems necessary, to
 establish bureaus covering several provinces.
 Such regional bureaus existed between 1949 and
 1954.  They were abolished after the Kao-Jao
 incident and were not revived until January 1961,
 when the need for a more coordinated regional at-
 tack on some of the party's problems impressed it-
 self upon the leaders.  The parallel government
 and military bodies which existed in the 1949-1954
 period have not reappeared, at least publicly.  To-
 day there are six regional bureaus of the Central
 Committee--the Northeast, North, East, Central-
 South, Southwest, and Northwest.  Peiping has been
 uncommonly sparing of detail concerning their re-
 sponsibilities and make-up.  The post-1961 versions
 appear to range across roughly the same spectrum
 of interests as party committees at other levels.
 .Each of them apparently has the authority to create
 such subordinate organizations as it-feels are
 needed.  Their staffing patterns seem still to be
 in the developmental stage, though many of them
 have begun to staff the usual run of subordinate
 departments for propaganda, rural work, finance
 and the like.  No regional organization departments
 or control commissions have yet been identified.
 The ..leading personnel of the regional bureaus
 are selected directly by the party center.  The in-
 dividuals named are probably then allowed to fill
 out their own staffs.   The present regional bosses
 are senior party officials, drawn some from Peiping
 and some from the provinces.  The Northeast Bureau
 is headed by Sung Jen-chiung, who was in charge of
 an important central government ministry.  The East
 China and Southwest Bureaus, on the other hand, are
 headed by individuals drawn from the Shanghai munci-
 pal and Szechwan provincial party apparatus, respec-
 tively.  Both are Politburo members.
 These bureaus probably do have certain personnel
 powers and functions.  They assist the party center
 in assessing job performance of provincial leaders.
 Since responsibilities at the regions are broader

 than in the provinces, the regional posts may be a
 proving grounds for higher posts with the party
 center.
 The staffing pattern at the provincial level
 is a virtual carbon copy of that in Peiping.  Auto-
 nomous regions and cities directly under central
 authority (like Shanghai) are treated as provinces.
 A provincial congress is elected, and elects in
 turn a provincial committee to act for the congress
 when it is not in session.  The provincial committee
 elects a standing committee to act in its stead
 when it is not in session as well as a secretariat
 to handle its "daily work."
 These provincial posts are important--10 of the
 21 Chinese provinces have populations of between 20
 and 60 million--and the party center takes no chances.
 It wrote into the constitution that the number of
 members of a provincial committee will be set by the
 Central Committee and that the members of a provin-
 cial standing committee and, secretariat must be
 approved by the Central Committee..  So must party
 committee members in key industrial cities and cities
 with a population of over 500,000 (of which China
 has some 35).
 Like its counterpart in Peiping, the provincial
 committee has the constitutional authority "to take
 charge of and allocate party cadres", but the Cen-
 tral Committee establishes the controlling regula-
 tions.  In practice, effective provincial responsi-
 bility over cadres is most likely exercised by the
 standing committee (for the higher provincial jobs)
 and by the provincial departments (for lesser posts).
 Provincial Committees are empowered to set up
 their own departments.  Most of them have an organi-
 zation department, the duties of which are determined
 by the provincial committees.  Provincial organiza-
 tion departments are involved, when local conditions
 and their instructions permit, in the assignment and
 promotion of cadres coming under provincial control.
 Provincial departments are under the authority of the
 provincial party committee, not under the corresponding
 department at the party center.  The latter hasonly
 what Peiping terms a "guidance relationship" with
 its provincial counterparts.

 The staffing of party organizations at the county
 level is similar to the pattern at the more exalted
 levels.
 Party Personnel Administration
 The party constitution says that membership in
 the party is open to any Chinese, age 18 and over,
 who works and does not exploit the labor of others.
 The entrance process can be initiated by the individ-
 ual or by the party.  He must be sponsored by two
 full members.   In either case, the individual in-
 volved must fill out a detailed application.  The
 most important entries involve his family and
 personal background, communist works he has been
 influenced by, a personal evaluation of his good
 and bad points, and a statement as to why he wishes
 to join the party.  He must be approved by a general
 membership meeting of a party branch.  After being
 accepted by the branch meeting, the application is
 forwarded to the next higher committee for review.
 This committee assigns a functionary to examine
 carefully the candidate's application form and
 to interview him in detail.
 After approval by the committee, the appli-
 cant becomes a probationary member of the party.
 He stays in this status for one year, during which
 he is subjected to an "elementary party education"
 and to the close observation of the party branch,
 When the test year is over, his. case again comes
 before the branch meeting.  His party age is com-
 puted from the day he is accepted by the branch
 as a full member, though he must still go through
 the formality of being approved by the next higher
 committee.  At any point in this process a strong
 objection by any one involved can kill the appli-
 cant's chances.
 Admission into the Chinese Communist Party is
 achieved more easily in .the periods when the party
 runs drives to add new members; for example, there
 was a big upswing in admissions during the commune
 and "leap forward" movements in 1958-1959.  These
 are followed by periods of consolidation when
 entrance requirements are more strenuously applied.

 Since 1956 there no longer have been different
 procedures prescribed for applicants of different
 class backgrounds.  But it is, nevertheless, rela-
 tively easy for a Chinese with a "clean" class
 background  parents who were workers or peasants--
 to get into the party.  Such an individual would be
 more likely be asked to apply, and he might even
 find his probationary period shortened.  On the
 other hand,, it is not unknown for an applicant
 with an "unclean" background to be met with delay-
 ing tactics which might last several years.  In-
 deed a bad background--a parent who was in the
 Kuomintang, for example--could in practice preclude
 admission.
 Members in good standing of the Youth League,
 a sort of junior party organization, are accepted
 almost automatically.  Another rich source of
 party material is in the ranks of the non-party
 "activist."  This is one of the very best ways for
 an outsider to come to the favorable notice of
 a local party boss.  An "activist" serves the
 party by leading the less active masses at study
 meetings and during production drives.
 The qualities which the party wants in its
 members include an unquestioning zeal, a strong
 measure of asceticism, and a dash, no more, of
 individuality.  The party wants a man who will
 place the interests of the party above his own,
 a man with no aims or ambitions, indeed no life,
 outside the party.  He must demonstrate instan-
 taneous zbedience to party discipline.  It is
 his "holy, duty" to carry out party policy without
 reservation even if he disagrees with it, though
 at the same time he is expected to be skilled in
 adapting the policy to local peculiarities.  He
 must in all things be an exemplar to the masses,
 while-sharing their "jobs and sorrows, their hard
 and frugal life."  He should display leadership
 potential.'
 Of course not all Chinese Communist Party
 members measure up to these high-flown standards.
 What.the party gets in practice is considerably
 more limited, especially at the basic levels.
 Here the party is apt to settle for obedience and
 political reliability.

 Appraisal and Promotion
 The basic party organization, the branch,
 makes periodic appraisals of each of its members.
 The appraisal process begins with the individual's
 own analysis of himself.  This is then discussed
 by his branch colleagues who have been observing
 him and forming views as to his suitability.  The
 "self-criticisms and criticisms" thus collected
 are supplemented by regular personal interviews
 between the individual member and one of his party
 betters.  Another higher official may collate and
 sum up all of this material.  Branch appraisals
 are supposed to take into account the member's per-
 sonal history and work record, his merits and de-
 merits, his capabilities and limitations.  They
 become a part of a member's permanent party re-
 cord..
 Over a period of time these appraisals enable
 the party apparatus to make judgments of a member's
 particular worth and identify those who are ready
 to be moved to positions of higher responsibility.
 Although there have been hints that a sort of rough
 grading system does exist within the party, it is
 not apparently as firm and well-developed a system
 as exists in the Chinese government and military.
 An individual's rank in the party seems largely to
 be determined by the level of the apparatus at
 which he works and his duties at that level.  There
 are references, for example, to party secretaries
 at the county level which suggest that the party
 regards this as equivalent to a grade designation.
 According to party instructions, the selection
 of cadres for promotion and transfer should proceed
 on the basis of a systematic plan and on a "unified"
 --that is, controlled by the higher levels--basis.
 The entire history and work of the member being con-
 sidered for reassignment is to be taken into account.
 His party record, likely to be a voluminous file
 for any but the newest recruit, will be studied,
 and the opinions of his superiors, his equals and
 his subordinates sought.  He may be brought in for
 a personal interview by a ranking member of the
 office for which he is being considered,  Even if
 he is not selected, the party argues that this sort
 of screening is good.  The individual gains a better
 understanding of his strengths and weaknesses, while

 the party is enabled to place him in his proper
 spot.
 "Sin our fundamental evaluations of a member's
 work," Mao has said.,"we must establish whether his
 achievements amount to 30 percent and his mistakes
 to 70 percent, or vice versa.   If his achievements
 amount to 70 percent, then his work should in the
 main be approved.,,  Most of the criteria advocated
 by the party to guide the selection process are,
 however, highly subjective (e.g., a high degree of
 communist conciousness) and leave the selectors with-
 out much meaningful guidance.  Hence, much to the
 party's professed .=annna.nce   great emphasis is put
 in practice on seniority and personal relationships.
 A former party member has recalled that the prime
 requirement for most any post was to have served a
 certain length of time in,the party.  The more re-
 sponsible the post, the longer the period.  Others
 have testified that the prejudices of the higher
 cadres constituted a most important factor.
 Party writings make it very clear that the.
 leaders want advancement based on other criteria.
 Guidelines from the Organization Department to
 party workers involved in the assignment and promo-
 tion process stipulate that they should resolutely
 avoid the practice of assigning and promoting solely
 on the basis of seniority.  Teng Hsiao-ping has called
 this reliance the most serious defect in the party's
 cadre policy.
 The party says it wants advancement to be based
 both on the member's "virtue," meaning his ideologi-
 cal reliability, and "ability," meaning. his tech :.;
 nical qualifications.  As the party's role has
 broadened over the years, and especially since it
 took over the Chinese mainland, the emphasis put
 on the second part of the equation has increased.
 A recent party work, for example, declared that pre-
 ferment in the Party will increasingly depend on
 how well the member improves his technical skill.
 But the party has not, and probably never will, per-
 mit the latter to outweigh the former.
