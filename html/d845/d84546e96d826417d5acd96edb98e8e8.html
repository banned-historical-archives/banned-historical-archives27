 WASH'NGTON POST

 High Tech Gamble, High Stakes Loss
 By John de St. Jorre
 special to The Washington Post
 It sounded as if one of Walter
 Mitty's loftier flights of fancy had
 come true.
 You, a government official, banker
 or corporate chieftain, walk into
 your office, sit down at your video
 terminal and punch a few buttons.
 The screen lights up and the last 24
 hours' "take" of significant political
 and economic information affecting
 your interests flashes in front of you.
 It already is carefully sorted and
 professionally analyzed. No more
 complicated searching of data base;
 no more extraneous material, for this
 is information in an area you have
 specifically selected, and it reaches
 you automatically. There is a key-
 board for you to talk back and a
 printer to print out.
 Behind the dream, across the Po-
 tomac in Crystal City and Fullerton,
 Va., lies the substance. Humming,
 state-of-the art computers, rooms
 bathed in soft green light where op-
 tical scanners digest huge volumes of .
 printed information, systems, and
 software experts, translators and,,
 top-flight analysts, journalists and
 former senior government officials
 stand ready to serve you. World
 statesmen, such as Edward Heath
 and Robert S. McNamara,. are part
 of the operation, ensuring impecca-
 ble quality control.
 Beyond them, reaching into the
 far corners of the globe, scores of
 consultants and correspondents re-
 spond to your questions, giving you
 precisely what you need to know,
 when you need to know it. Shazaam!
 Your competitors might as well toss
 their Rolodexes into their briffcases
 and take early retirement.
 Thus dreamed the men who cre-
 ated IRIS, which stands for Inter-
 national Reporting Information Sys-
 tems, but also suggests the all-seeing
 eye and the fleet-footed Greek god.
 dess of messengers.
 IRIS was officially launched in
 November 1981. Fifteen months
 later it collapsed. During its short
 life it became more than a dream
 but something less than a reality;
 IRIS existed but it never went any-
 where.
 When the bottom line was ex-
 amined in the Alexandria bankrupt-
 cy court, it was found that $15 mil-
 lion had drained away, $400 in rev-
 enue had come in (from an old-fash.
 ioned business consultation over
 lunch) and not a single client had
 been signed.
 IRIS is the story of an enormously
 ambitious business venture put to-
 gether by people on both sides of the
 Atlantic who thought they could
 cross new frontiers in the informa-
 tion world by using the latest com-
 munications technology.
 The players were a diverse group,
 including the predominantly Euro-
 pean  investors  whose "punting"
 money financed the venture, a for-
 mer British prime minister and a
 former U.S. secretary of defense
 whose stature helped bolster its
 credibility, as well as senior officials.
 recruited from the State Department
 and the CIA.
 They helped make IRIS also a
 story of Washington, of the capital's
 growing magnetism in the world of
 information  and  communications
 technology, of the fascination the
 city holds for foreign governments,
 corporations and individuals alike,
 and of its bulging bureaucracies and
 its overachievers who, as they move
 into the fast lane, keep one-eye on
 their peers and the other on greener
 fields to conquer.
 The basic concept of IRIS was to
 gather, sort and analyze the vast
 amount  of information  floating
 around the world-thereby greatly
 increasing its value-and deliver it
 electronically to subscribers. The
 individual components of the ser-
 vice-news reporting and analysis,
 business consultancy and electronic
 publishing-were not new. Success-
 fully combining them, and delivering
 the service to customers according to
 their prescribed needs, would have'
 been a breakthrough.
 IRIS computers, though they were
 large, were not unusual. What was
 special was the software, particularly
 the "syntactical algorithms," the
 brain of the software that enables
 the computer to "read" material and
 make key distinctions, say, between
 oil (petroleum) and cooking oil, or
 between Venetian blinds and, blind
 Venetians. The software would sort
 the mass of information flowing
 hourly into the computer and direct
 it to IRIS clients on the basis of
 their specific needs built into the
 computer's programming. The key to
 the IRIS system was that, instead of
 you searching for the information,
 the information would be searching
 for you.
 Thus a company interested in
 copper or oil would only receive in-
 formation related to that subject.
 Similarly, a government, worried by
 the behavior of its neighbors, could,
 profile itself to receive reports on
 those countries and nothing else.
 IRIS thus showed that it was con-
 scious of the complaint that there
 was already too much information
 around.
 IRIS began when David D'Am-
 brumenil, a London insurance bro-
 ker, walked into Anthony Stout's
 downtown Washington office in the
 fall of 1979. Stout, a youthful, ath-
 letic-looking  43-year-old,  is  the
 founder and chairman of the Nation-
 al Journal, a much-praised Washing-
 ton insiders' weekly focusing on gov-
 ernment policy, and the Government
 Research Corp. (GRC), a business
 consultancy. Both operations were
 running reasonably well under the
 guidance of two efficient deputies,
 and Stout was bored.
 D'Ambrumenil's proposition was
 simple and exciting. There was, he
 said, a large, unexploited market in
 the political risk insurance business.
 Underwriters lacked an independent
 and objective international informa-
 tion service on which to base premi-
 ums for corporations prepared to do

 business in many places, if they were
 properly insured against expropri-
 ation resulting from instability and
 political change. The unexpected
 collapse of the shah in Iran was still
 on mary people's minds.
 D'Ambrumenil's plan was to use a
 Lloyds of London insurance under-
 writer to lead the business. His cal-
 culation was that premiums based
 on the new information service
 would have a significant competitive
 edge. Commissions would be split
 between D'Ambrumenil, the under-
 writer and the information system.
 D'Ambrumenil estimated that IRIS
 share would amount to $200,000
 monthly.
 Stout, stressing that he could only
 discuss the historical aspects of the
 story because of continuing contrac-
 tual obligations to IRIS, said after
 the crash that he agreed to invest in
 the venture. However, he felt it was
 a risky enterprise and made his in-
 vestment conditional on being paid a
 management fee and on his own
 company, GRC, setting up the com-
 puter and analytical parts of the sys-
 tem. He and D'Ambrutnenil esti-
 mated that $10 million would be
 needed.
 By mid-1980, Stout was working
 full-time on the IRIS project, jump-
 ing on and off the Concorde jetliner, .
 staying at Claridges, London's pre=
 mier hotel, using his broad range of
 business contacts and his consider-
 able charm to promote a venture
 that had become something of an
 obsession. With characteristic pa-
 nache, he called the new venture
 "Project Grand Slam." A National
 Journal reporter, reflecting some of
 the skepticism among the magazine's
 staff, dubbed it "Project Titanic."
 Stout and D'Ambrumenil had
 their greatest success in Europe with
 bankers, who were attracted by the
 information and high technology as-
 pects, and with insurance companies
 that also were interested in the po-
 litical risk business. These investors
 included  the  Henry  Ansbacher,
 group, a British investment and in-
 surance firm; Seascope, a London
 insurance company; Skandia, Swe-
 den's largest insurance firm: The
 Bank in Liechtenstein, owned by the
 prince of Liechtenstein; Banco de
 Bilbao in Spain and Fred Olsen, the
 Norwegian shipping magnate who
 also owns Timex watches and other
 high technology companies.
 Stout had a personal stake, as did
 a wealthy Swede, Gustaf Douglas,
 who was to play a critical role later.
 S. G. Warburg, the prestigious Brit-
 ish investment bank, brought in a
 final investor whose identity was
 never revealed to the others. He was
 known simply as "Mr. X," another
 investor said.
 The investors were not a cohesive
 group but they all had some risk
 capital-their "punting" money, as
 one London businessman put it-
 available and a number of them were
 excited by the lucrative insurance
 business that Stout and D'Ambru-
 menil expected. Stout's vision of the
 new computer-driven information
 world was also tantalizing.
 The investors, anticipating large
 profits, set up an elaborate network
 of holding companies in tax havens.
 One holding company was registered
 in the Netherlands, another in Cu-
 racao in the Dutch Antilles. Later,
 an investment company was opened
 in the British Channel Islands. The
 investors saw no point in paying un-
 necessary taxes for an international
 company.
 The group only managed to raise
 $5 million, half of the total esti-
 mated necessary for the project, but
 they decided to go ahead and attract
 new investment as they went along.
 A contract with Stout's GRC to de-
 velop and manage the enterprise was -
 signed. Stout was to receive $2 mil-
 lion of the projected $10 million
 spent over the -next two years'
 Back in Washington in the sum-
 mer of 1981, Stout began recruiting
 his management team. He turned to
 the government, partly on the as-
 sumption that information process-
 ing systems that had been perfected
 by government, personnel could be
 put in the marketplace by the same
 hands. Never having been in govern-
 ment 'himself, yet living in the gov-
 ernment town, Stout, like his poten-
 tial clients, seemed impressed by the
 people in the great state bureaucra-
 cies and the reputations they car-
 ried.
 "Tony liked the idea of top CIA
 men and ambassadors working for
 him," said someone who knows him
 well. Their stature was regarded as
 important for IRIS credibility with
 clients.
 Through contacts, friends and
 headhunters he selected his four sen-
 ior managers. The first key figure to
 sign on was Lee Feldman, a 27-year-
 old with an IQ that went off the
 clock and a reputation for having
 performed marvels with computer
 software in the Defense Department.
 His task was to build and run the
 computer operation.
 The communications technology
 that IRIS planned to use had been
 developed in the CIA and the Pen-
 tagon. There had never been an at-
 tempt to adapt it for commercial use
 before, and therein lay the challenge
 and the excitement of the enterprise.
 Next came Barry Kelly, 50, who
 had spent most of his life in the CIA
 and had once been Moscow station
 chief. Kelly, a quiet-spoken, mild
 man was on the "up" escalator at the
 agency, but he took early retirement
 and was given the job of selling the
 IRIS service to governments
 Hired at the same time was Paul
 Boeker, 43, one of the State Depart-
 ment's bright young men. He had
 worked with former secretary of
 state Henry Kissinger (he kept a
 signed testimonial on his office wall)
 and had been ambassador to Bolivia-
 He took a leave of absence and was
 put in charge of the news and anal-
 ysis operation.
 The final member of the senior
 management to come on board-
 nautical analogies were popular at
 IRIS-was John Kulp, 38, who had
 worked with Citibank in Hong Kong
 and the Netherlands. Confident and
 ambitious, _his task was to sell the
 service' to corporate and financial
 customers.
 The salaries were excellent. Boe-
 ker topped the bill with .$1-12,500 a
 year, Kelly and Kuip received
 $100,000 each; Feldman was paid
 $65,000.

 Stout deliberately went for people
 who had already shown promise,
 were relatively young and who were
 still moving up. They responded to
 his call because he showed them a
 glimpse of the new information fron-
 tier. offered them considerably more
 money than they had ever earned
 before. and freed them from the
 frustrations and servitude of giant
 organizations. It was a classic pitch:
 follow me along the primrose path to'
 a new world of affluence and influ-'
 ence. It worked like a charm.
 Stout rented large offices in Crys-
 tal City with a panoramic view of
 Washington. The original intention
 was to put the computers and ana-
 lytical operation there together, but
 after the contract was signed, it was
 found that the ceilings were too low
 and the electric power too feeble for
 such an operation. Alternative ac-
 commodation for the computer was
 found 15 miles away in Fullerton,
 near Springfield. An office designer
 was hired and the premises lavishly
 fitted out.
 IRIS products were to include a
 daily flow of news-from wire ser-
 vices. newspapers, journals, specialist
 newsletters and its own correspon-
 dents-and sophisticated analysis on
 political and economic developments
 in all the major countries of the
 world. The boast was that the com-
 puter would absorb 15,000 messages
 a day in eight different languages. . .
 Naturally, the price tag would re-
 flect the cost of such an ambitious
 operation. The annual subscription
 for corporations was $100,000 and,
 for governments between $250,000
 and $500,000.
 Stout hit on the idea of a distin.
 guished  panel  of  international
 statesmen who would monitor and
 guarantee the quality of IRIS ana=
 lytical products. IRIS needed, he
 told an acquaintance, some "silver'
 hairs" to give it credibility. Charles
 Longbottom, a former Conservative
 member of parliament and. Sea-
 scope's representative on the IRIS
 board, contacted Edward Heath, an
 old political ally and friend. Heath
 agreed to become chairman of, the
 "International  Advisory  Council"
 (IAC), which had been hurriedly
 changed  from  its original  title,
 "Council of International Advisers"
 (CIA).
 Enticing a farmer British prime
 minister to lead this group was quite
 a coup for Stout, especially since
 Heath was instrumental in bringing
 in other big names, including McNa
 mara, former head of the World
 Bank; .lean-Francois Deniau, a for-'
 mer French trade minister; Rodrigo
 Botero, an ex-finance minister of'
 Colombia and Saburo Okita, former
 foreign minister of Japan. A leading
 Arab and African were sought to
 complete the international symmetry
 of the group but were never found.
 Heath and McNamara made clear
 from the outset they were interested
 in the effect that a far-reaching and
 objective information service would
 have on the expansion of trade and
 investment in the Third World. The
 group's duties were to meet every
 three months and review IRIS an-
 alytical products. However,,as with
 the rest of the IRIS operation, there'
 was a heavy price tag. Heath was. to
 be paid 50,000 pounds annually
 ($75,000 at current exchange rates)
 and other members were to receive
 $3,000, plus expenses, for each meet-
 ing they attended.
 Back in London in the fall of
 1981, Stout was preparing for the
 launch. He hired David Kingsley, an
 experienced London public relations
 consultant, who devised the title,
 International Reporting Information
 Systems (IRIS)-the staid investors
 balked at "Grand Slam"-and a geo-
 metric logo of a square of white dots
 with one red one below indicating
 the vital piece of information, among
 the morass, that IRIS clients would
 want. (The message did not always
 get through. Once when a Jordanian
 official was given an IRIS business
 card during a sales meeting, he
 glanced down at it, assumed the red
 dot was a splash of ink or dried
 blood, and spent the' next half hour
 surreptitiously trying to scrape it off
 with his fingernail.)
 In November 1981, IRIS was of-
 ficially launched in London and
 Washington. - A glossy  brochure
 presented an appetizing menu for
 the "world's decision-makers." The
 "heart of IRIS" was a huge comput-
 ier, its "soul" a staff of expert ana-
 lysts in Washington backed by a
 worldwide network of. IRIS corre-
 spondents and bureaus. Shortly after
 this, there was a picture of Stout in
 People magazine standing in front of
 a computer (it belonged to , the
 World Bank), two terminals at his
 side and his hands wrapped, around
 a globe.
 The press reaction reflected con-
 fusion over exactly what IRIS was
 trying to do, skepticism over wheth-
 er it could do it and a fixation with
 the alleged clandestine nature of the
 organization. The last seemed to
 have arisen from Stout's early asser-
 tion that what computer technology
 had done for the U.S. government
 and its agencies would now be avail-
 able to the private sector and foreign
 governments on a strictly commer-
 cial basis.
 The press on both sides of the
 Atlantic pounced on the "private
 CIA ... spy firm" label and never
 let go despite countless protestations
 by Edward Heath-who was deeply
 embarrassed by this and the disclo-
 sure of his fee-that IRIS was a
 bona fide information service, open
 to all, that would encourage trade
 ,and investment throughout the
 world by disseminating accurate and
 timely news and analysis.
 Within two months of its launch-
 ing, the new ship was in trouble.
 Fuel was running out, there was a
 sense of drift and below decks there
 was a whiff of mutiny. The first blow
 was the collapse of the political risk
 insurance scheme that was supposed
 to net IRIS $200,000 a month. IRIS
 sources said that D'Ambrumenil
 failed to deliver what he had prom-
 ised. D'Ambrumenil replied that
 Stout had failed to produce the in-
 formation on which he was to base
 the business.
 Amid mutual recriminations, the
 two men fell out, and D'Ambrumenil
 went back to insurance brokerage.

 The Lloyds underwriter, the third

 posed to do the actual underwriting,
 sold his business and dropped off
 the scene. His name subsequently
 came tip in connection with inves-
 tigations of the scandals that have
 recently rocked Lloyds in London.
 When I spoke to him by telephone
 at his Geneva home last week, he
 said he was in "semiretirement and
 improving my golf."
 On March 15 last year, I reported
 to Crystal City for my first day's
 work as IRIS Africa director. Having
 originally turned down the job, I had
 changed my mind, lured by the con-
 cept, the money ($75,000 a year) and
 the reassuring presence of other pro-
 fessional journalists. My task was to
 hire an editor, three analysts and a
 secretary to work with me in Wash-
 ington, and then go out to Africa
 and sign up a large number of cor-
 respondents. A budget, I was told,
 would be worked out later.
 There was a curious atmosphere,
 at once calm and disconcerting, in
 those comfortable offices. Three gla-
 morous receptionists sat in the en-
 trance lobby, which was decorated
 with flowering plants and some fine
 political posters, old maps and fa-
 mous cartoons. A small group of an-
 alysts sat around talking. Interior
 partitioning work in the "newsroom"
 had stopped, half-finished, and :
 number of telephones sat on the
 floor waiting, it seemed, for cubicles
 to be built around them. Stout's of-
 fice was empty, but the faint aroma
 of good cigars suggested a recent
 presence.
 John de St. Jerre, a former London.
 Observer correspondent  in Africa,
 Paris and the Middle East, became
 IRIS Africa director in March, 1,982,
 after first turning down the job. lie
 joined because he was attracted by the
 concept, the $75,000-a-year salary and
 the reassuring presence of other pro-
 fessional journalists. De St. Jorre sup-
 plemented his insider's knowledge by
 extensive interviews with the major
 figures involved in the story in the 10
 months he worked for IRIS and the
 period after it collapsed.
 Boeker, my boss, was apologetic.
 There had been some problems, he
 said. There was a need for refinanc-
 ing, a new business plan, some'man-
 agerial changes. There would be a
 freeze on hiring. Meanwhile, I could
 go through the mountain of resumes
 on my desk, mainly from out-of-
 work Ph.D.s, including an audacious
 bid for a job from Dr. Eschel Rhoo-
 die, the former secretary of South
 Africa's Ministry of Information who
 resigned in 1978 following a scandal
 of  Watergate  dimensions,  who
 claimed he had always been anti-
 apartheid.
 Washington's weather became un-
 seasonably chilly during the next few
 days. So did the climate at IRIS.
 First, the three receptionists disap-
 peared, then the office manager, fi-
 nally an analyst. One morning, in the
 reception area, an IRIS veteran of
 three months standing grabbed my
 arm and pointed at the plants.
 "Keep an eye on those," he said.
 "If they go, we're really in trouble.
 They're rented."

 Board Room Coup
 On March 10, 1982, Anthony
 Stout arrived punctually at the of
 fices of the Henry Ansbacher Bank
 in the City of London for a meeting
 of the IRIS investors' board. As he
 turned into the building he was as-
 tonished to see his four deputies-
 men he had hired only six months
 before and thought were looking
 after the store-in Washington-walk-
 ing into the building in front of him.
 At the board meeting it was an-
 nounced that the four men would be
 making a presentation. Stout was
 asked to leave the room and did so,
 accompanied by Charles Longbot-
 tom, IRIS' chairman. By the end of
 the day, it was clear'Stout had been
 pushed aside in a coup run by his
 senior operational managers-
 Stout, the imaginative entrepre-
 neur and promoter, the man with
 the vision of the new information
 frontier that IRIS was to cross, was
 no longer in control of the enterprise
 he had spent two years developing.

 IRIS replaced him-three months
 after its official launch-with his
 deputies, whp now had to prove they
 could run a multimillion-dollar busi-
 ness as well as they had run the
 coup. .
