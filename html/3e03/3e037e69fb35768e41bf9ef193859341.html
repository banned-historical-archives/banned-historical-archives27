Secret 
Last month's peace agreement between India and Sri Lanka aimed 
at ending the Tamil insurgency is changing Sri Lankan party 
politics. New life has been breathed into President Jayewardene's 
Sinhalese opposition, Tamil militants have moved closer to the 
political mainstream, and the ruling United National Party has 
become a target of Sinhalese terrorists. 
Succession Prospects in Sri Lanka 
Page 
1 
The next leadership change in Sri Lanka most likely will occur with 
the national election scheduled for 1989, but President 
Jayewardene's recent signing of the Indo?Sri Lankan peace accord 
amid strong domestic opposition increases the likelihood of his 
forced removal. Prime Minister Premadasa, who opposes the peace 
accord, is the most likely successor.

India?Sri Lanka: Prospects for Sustained Military Intervention 
India can maintain a sizable military presence in Sri Lanka virtually 
indefinitely, but it will face problems enforcing the Indo?Sri Lankan 
peace accord in the face of determined Tamil or Sinhalese 
opposition. India will avoid any long-term engagement that will 
leave its troops in Sri Lanka  caught in the middle of renewed 
fighting.

Pakistan: Rough Waters for New Maritime Agency 
Pakistan inaugurated its new Maritime Security Agency early this 
year to protect the country's territorial waters and defend its 
economic rights in the Arabian Sea. The Agency has achieved some 
success in apprehending trespassing foreign fishing vessels, but half-
staffed ranks, outdated equipment, and low morale limit its 
operational capabilities. 
Pakistan: Political Conflict Inundates Kalabagh Dam 
The Pakistani Government is slowly moving forward with plans to 
develop the Kalabagh Dam in Punjab despite near unanimous 
opposition outside the province. Although the project could 
substantially improve Pakistan's energy outlook, a firm decision to 
begin the project will not take place before the 1990 election.

The Enemy of Our Enemy: China and the Afghan War 
China's low-key support for the Afghan resistance contrasts sharply 
with the media prominence given Pakistani and Iranian support, but 
opposition to the Soviet presence in Afghanistan remains an integral 
part of Chinese foreign policy. Beijing supports the Afghan 
resistance to increase the costs of the war and force a Soviet 
withdrawal. 
Afghanistan: Mine Warfare Takes a Toll

Mine warfare has had a significant impact on military operations in 
Afghanistan. The extensive use of mines by Soviet, Afghan regime, 
and insurgent forces has caused high military and civilian casualties, 
and the development of reliable countermeasures has become 
increasingly difficult.

Syria: Debating Policy on the Iran-Iraq War 
President Assad has initiated a controlled debate among his closest 
advisers on Syria's support for Iran in its war with Iraq. Although 
all key decisionmakers recognize that Iran's long-term Islamic

value of the alliance in the shorter term. 
Syria: Wheat Shortages Highlight Economic Vulnerabilities 
Syria is caught in a cycle of recurring wheat shortages that have 
emerged as the most serious aspect of the country's economic crisis. 
President Assad will be forced to continue to make minor political

Cairo welcomes the preliminary agreement to eventually coproduce

Sri Lanka's Politics 
Heat Up 
Last month's peace agreement between India and Sri 
Lanka aimed at ending the Tamil insurgency is 
changing Sri Lankan party politics. Successful 
implementation of the agreement is far from certain, 
but its provisions have already breathed new life into 
President Jayewardene's Sinhalese opposition, moved 
Tamil militants closer to the political mainstream, 
and made Jayewardene and his ruling United 
National Party targets of Sinhalese terrorists opposed 
to the accord. Although preparations for elections in 
Tamil areas of Sri Lanka are making progress and the 
accord enjoys support among most Tamils, divisions 
among Tamil leaders and continuing Sinhalese 
Opposition threaten to delay a return to elected 
government in war-torn areas. 
The Sinhalese Opposition 
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party. The Sri Lanka 
Freedom Party (SLFP) is the official opposition to 
President Jayewardene and his ruling United 
National Party (UNP). During the last general 
election in 1977, the SLFP won only nine seats in 
Parliament and has had little impact on government 
policies since then. According to the US Embassy in 
Colombo, the SLFP has consistently opposed all 
proposals on Tamil autonomy offered by the 
government and played almost no part in more than 
two years of sporadic negotiations between Colombo, 
New Delhi, and Tamil leaders. Although her political 
rights were restored in 1986, SLFP leader Sirimavo 
Bandaranaike has been unable to regain her seat in 
Parliament. 
The SLFP, however, remains a powerful political 
force in Sri Lanka, especially in rural Sinhalese areas. 
The SLFP's close ties to senior members of the 
Buddhist clergy have given the party access to an 
extensive network of temples and Buddhist leaders 
1 
throughout villages in the Sinhalese south. Embassy 
sources also suggest support for the SLFP may be 
increasing because Jayewardene's UNP has held 
power for 10 years and voters are likely to seek a 
switch in ruling parties during the scheduled election 
in 1989. 
The SLFP's ability to provoke antigovernment 
protests and rioting, in our view, has enhanced the 
party's political power. Without sanctioning Marxist 
revolution, the SLFP has forged operational ties to the 
radical Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). The 
SLFP shares the JVP's hardline Sinhalese 
chauvinism, opposition to Jayewardene, and strong  
support in rural areas of the south. 
the SLFP drew upon its ties to the 
Buddhist clergy to incite antigovernment protests in 
response to last month's peace accord. 
Sinhalese opposition to the peace accord between 
India and Sri Lanka is likely to enhance the party's 
clout in domestic politics. 
 the SLFP is trying to unite disaffected 
members of the ruling UNP and members of the 
Buddhist clergy to oppose the accord and will use 
threats against members of Parliament and their 
families to prevent ratification. Prospects for control 
of Sinhalese areas in Eastern Province by a Tamil-
dominated provincial council are likely to give the 
SLFP a rallying point. Prolonged Indian troop 
deployment will help the SLFP fuel traditional fears 
of Indian invasion and destruction of Sinhalese 
culture.

Secret 
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. Proscribed by the 
government since 1983 as a subversive organization 
and scorned by Sri Lanka's traditional leftist parties, 
the JVP has the arms, money, and organization to 
threaten the government's stability. 
the JVP has recruited at least 5,000 
members serving in the Sri Lankan armed services, 
police, and civil service in addition to 4,000 deserters. 
The US Embassy in Colombo estimates total JVP 
strength is between 20,000 and 65,000, including 
growing numbers of Sinhalese university students. 
The government claims the JVP has amassed at least 
1,000 weapons?mostly shotguns stolen from 
government armories and police stations. 
The signing of the Indo?Sri Lankan peace accord has 
heightened government fears of JVP efforts at 
subversion. The US Embassy reports the JVP was 
probably responsible for organizing some of the 
Sinhalese rioting immediately following the signing of 
the accord. Colombo has accused the JVP of 
launching the attack on Jayewardene in Sri Lanka's 
Parliament on 18 August that killed one member of 
Parliament and injured 14 others. 
The JVP's revolutionary goals reflect the group's 
roots among poor, low- caste Sinhalese of the deep 
south. According to Embassy sources, many poor 
Sinhalese in the south are economically worse off than 
they were 10 years ago when Jayewardene launched 
his economic liberalization program. Relying on its 
good organization, the JVP has exploited a growing 
resentment?fueled by caste differences with the 
ruling elite in Colombo?among these economically 
hard-pressed Sinhalese and is rapidly expanding its 
membership. 
The Buddhist Clergy. Sri Lanka's Buddhist clergy 
enjoys ties to both the government and Sinhalese 
opposition and holds traditional authority throughout 
the southern rural areas. Senior members of the 
clergy have long pressed Jayewardene to protect 
Sinhalese interests and avoid capitulating to Tamil 
Secret 
autonomy demands. Academic research indicates the 
clergy's hard line on Sri Lanka's communal strife 
reflects traditional expectations that secular rulers 
must preserve and protect Sinhalese culture. The 
failure of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike to address 
Buddhist demands after his election as Prime 
Minister in 1956 fostered the conspiracy of Buddhist 
monks who assassinated him in 1959. 
The strong opposition to the peace accord from 
Buddhist monks?especially young ones who are 
willing to use violence?is likely to undermine 
Sinhalese support for the UNP. Jayewardene will not 
allow his relations with the main orders of Buddhist 
monks to deteriorate further, risking their defection to 
the SLFP and its radical JVP allies. Continued 
confrontation with the clergy could also undermine 
the UNP's strong electoral base in Sinhalese rural 
areas before the election in 1989. Regardless of 
Jayewardene's efforts at reconciliation, he almost 
certainly will have difficulty persuading the Buddhist 
clergy that a single Tamil-dominated province 
including a sizable Sinhalese population will serve 
Sinhalese interests. 
Tamils and Mainstream Politics 
The suspension of hostilities between the government 
and Tamil insurgents has increased prospects for a 
return to electoral democracy in war-torn areas. 
Colombo has announced its intention to hold 
byelections for 16 seats in Parliament left vacant in 
1983 by Tamil politicians of the moderate Tamil 
United Liberation Front (TULF) who refused to 
renounce Tamil separatism. Press reports indicate the 
Indian troop presence has enabled Colombo to reopen 
some police stations in war-torn areas of the north and 
east in a preliminary effort to reestablish a civil 
administration, usurped by Tamil insurgents. Some 
Tamil moderates in self-imposed exile in South India 
have already returned to Sri Lanka to discuss 
implementation of the peace plan, according to press 
reports. 
Tamil militant leaders are also making preparations 
for elections. the main 
Tamil insurgent group?the Liberation Tigers of

Tamil Eelam?and a smaller insurgent group have 
begun to establish political offices throughout Eastern 
Province aimed at building popular support among 
Tamils and Muslims the Tigers 
are also conducting symposiums to promote Muslim 
and Tamil harmony. The efforts of insurgent leaders 
to cultivate popular support are the clearest indication 
of their intention to abide by the accord and prepare 
for elections to the provincial council. The insurgents' 
lack of administrative experience and education, 
however, are likely to make voters wary of giving 
them full support soon. 
The depth of popular support among Tamil civilians 
for the TULF is also uncertain. Proscribed from 
mainstream politics and forced into exile in 1983, the 
TULF's aging leadership has had few opportunities to 
assert a political role anywhere in Sri Lanka. 
Although New Delhi enhanced the TULF's 
credentials by inviting its leaders to participate in 
Tamil autonomy talks throughout 1986, Tamil 
insurgent leaders have drawn greater public support 
since returning to Sri Lanka, eclipsing the return of 
Tamil moderates. 
Outlook 
We believe a resumption of electoral politics in war-
torn areas of Sri Lanka will depend largely on 
Colombo's ability?with Indian backing?to quell 
Reverse Blank 3 
Sinhalese opposition to the accord. Hardline Sinhalese 
opponents of the accord have already threatened 
members of the UNP loyal to Jayewardene and are 
well positioned to assassinate Sinhalese politicians 
participating in elections to the proposed provincial 
council. Although New Delhi would almost certainly 
attempt to guarantee the safety of candidates, even 
limited electoral violence could arouse doubts among 
all parties of the legitimacy of the contest and delay a 
return to elected government in the Tamil areas. 
Successful elections will also depend on the ability of 
Tamil militants and moderates to forge a consensus. 
Tamil moderates have shown no support for the 
Marxist leanings of the major insurgent groups and 
have lived under constant threat of assassination from 
the militants over the last four years. Unless the 
Tamil parties can mend relations, election violence is 
likely and a restoration of stable political relations 
between Sinhalese and Tamils will almost certainly be 
delayed.

1989, but President Jayewardene's recent signing of 
the Indo?Sri Lankan peace accord amid strong 
domestic opposition increases the likelihood of his 
forced removal. Prime Minister Premadasa would be 
the most likely candidate to become president. 
Premadasa, who opposes the peace accord because of 
its concessions to both India and the Sri Lankan 
Tamils, has strong support among voters and 
considerable influence in the ruling United National 
Party (UNP). His challengers include several other 
Cabinet ministers from the UNP and former Prime 
Minister Bandaranaike, the leader of the opposition 
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). Premadasa has 
largely avoided foreign policy issues during his decade 
as prime minister, but his support for the UNP's free-
market economic policy suggests he would favor 
economic cooperation with the United States. 
Jayewardene's Challenges 
President Jayewardene's decision to sign the Indo?Sri 
Lankan peace accord has led to greater threats to his 
personal security, particularly from Sinhalese 
chauvinists who believe he made too many concessions 
to the Tamils. The militant Sinhalese opposition is led 
by a proscribed Marxist organization, the Janatha 
Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). According to the US 
Embassy in Colombo, the JVP was responsible for 
organizing some of the violent antigovernment 
protests following the accord. Press reports indicate 
Colombo also suspects the JVP was responsible for an 
assassination attempt on Jayewardene on 18 August 
that killed one member of Parliament and injured 14 
others. Hardline Sinhalese military officers also may 
try to unseat the President in a coup. 
however, say many in the military 
are less concerned with the political implications of 
the concessions to the Tamils than with the benefits of 
ending an increasingly costly military campaign. 
5 
Jayewardene's agreement to allow Indian troops into 
Sri Lanka and give New Delhi some control over Sri 
Lankan decisionmaking heightens the possibility of 
political challenges from opposition leaders and 
members of his own party. Jayewardene's opponents 
have staged several public protests and are working 
behind the scenes in Parliament to challenge the 
accord. 
Although Jayewardene's opponents will use the 
accord to encourage popular dissatisfaction with his 
leadership, we believe his control of the ruling party 
assures his hold on power until the national election in 
1989. The ruling UNP holds a five-sixths majority in 
Parliament, and Jayewardene almost certainly has 
enough support among UNP members of Parliament 
to defeat easily any challenge to his leadership from 
 within the party. He also has threatened to dissolve 
 Parliament if UNP members fail to support the 
accord. We believe most UNP members will heed the 
threat because they have not faced elections in 10 
years and are ill prepared for the rigors and expense 
of a campaign. 
Jayewardene's opponents may try other political 
means to remove him from office, but these are far 
less likely. The only constitutional means to replace 
him before the national election in 1989 is through 
impeachment.

Succession Mechanics

Premadasa would automatically become interim

office. Premadasa could serve in that position for a 25X1

Secret 
How Could Jayewardene Be Impeached? 
The Sri Lankan Constitution states that any member 
of Parliament can introduce a resolution alleging the 
President is incapable of discharging his duties if he 
is guilty of intentional violation of the Constitution, 
treason, misconduct involving the abuse of his office, 
or any offense under any law. The Constitution 
requires the member of Parliament filing the 
accusation to detail the transgression. The Speaker 
of Parliament can place the resolution on the agenda 
if two-thirds of the members sign it or if half sign it 
and the Speaker is satisfied that the allegations merit 
inquiry. If the resolution is passed by a two-thirds 
majority (including those not present for the vote), the 
allegation is referred to the Supreme Court for 
inquiry and a report. The Supreme Court then must 
report its findings to the Parliament. If the court 
decides the President is guilty of the allegations in 
the resolution, the Constitution requires a vote of 
two-thirds of Parliament to impeach the President. 
scheduled end of the term. Using its parliamentary 
majority, we believe the UNP could ensure the 
election of a UNP successor to finish Jayewardene's 
term. 
We believe party and popular support for Premadasa 
will help him secure the UNP nomination. US 
Embassy sources say Premadasa probably can 
command between 50 and 80 of Parliament's 145 
UNP votes, either because he has served as a mentor 
for UNP parliamentarians or because he has loaned 
them money. Party members recognize him as a 
politician who has paid his UNP dues. Premadasa 
began his political life in Sri Lanka's trade union 
movement and was later active as a UNP organizer. 
He became Prime Minister in 1978 after holding a 
parliamentary seat for Colombo since 1955. 
In addition, Premadasa has for years parlayed his post 
as Minister of Local Government, Housing, and 
Construction, which he still holds, into a powerful 
base of grassroots support and a means to burnish his 
Secret 
populist credentials. According to the Embassy, his 
"Million Houses" scheme, initiated in 1977, has 
helped to improve housing and living standards in 
poor Sinhalese areas. About 60,000 homes were 
underwritten in 1986 alone. Premadasa has buttressed 
his popular support with weekly visits to the new 
development areas. Premadasa, unlike other Sri 
Lankan political leaders, also benefits from an 
experienced and well-connected staff, according to the 
Embassy. His staffers have used his visits to 
development projects to cultivate local party ties that 
would prove useful during a national campaign. 
Premadasa's family background?he is from a low, 
small, washerman caste?is his most serious handicap 
and, according to the Embassy, his only major 
impediment to reaching the presidency. Sri Lanka's 
chief executives have always been prominent 
members of the large, high-caste goyigama, a 
farmers' caste. Election of a low-caste president would 
be a watershed in Sri Lanka's caste-ridden politics, 
and Premadasa's detractors argue that caste alone 
will prevent him from winning the presidency, 
according to the Embassy. Embassy officials say rival 
high-caste UNP members accept him as a leader with 
strong reservations because of his caste, noting that 
some even refused to attend Cabinet sessions 
Premadasa chaired during his early years as Prime 
Minister. Embassy sources, however, believe?and we 
concur?that caste has lessened as a political 
determinant in Sri Lanka, though it continues to play 
a major social role in, for example, arranged 
marriages. We believe his populist and devoutly 
Buddhist image will help him overcome his caste 
disadvantage. 
Premadasa's Rivals for the Presidency 
Premadasa's most serious UNP rivals are National 
Security Minister Athulathmudali and Minister of 
Land, Land Development, and Mahaweli 
Development Gamini Dissanayake. Athulathmudali 
attracts hardline Sinhalese who favor his strong 
security measures against the Tamils, and 
Dissanayake has won some support for his role in Sri 
Lanka's large Mahaweli irrigation and land

Secret 
development project. Both men, however, have slipped 
in popularity over the past year. Athulathmudali is 
more closely associated than Premadasa with 
Jayewardene and the peace negotiations and has 
suffered because hardline Sinhalese either blame 
guerrilla successes on poorly trained government 
security forces or see government conciliation efforts 
as a sellout of Sinhalese interests. 
His support for the 
peace accord, however, would probably win him 
backing from Jayewardene's followers in Parliament. 
Outside the UNP, the main challenge to Premadasa 
comes from leaders of the opposition SLFP, which 
includes former Prime Minister Bandaranaike and 
her son Anura. The SLFP holds only nine seats in 
Parliament, but a Sinhalese chauvinist backlash 
against the UNP "sellout" to the Tamils may help 
Bandaranaike make a strong run for the presidency in 
1989. 
Outlook and Implications for the United States 
We believe any successor to Jayewardene in the near 
term would be less committed to implementing the 
peace accord. None of the President's likely 
successors favors the agreement. Over the long term, 
however, if Sinhalese opposition to the accord wanes, 
we believe potential successors from the UNP?
particularly Premadasa?would try to minimize their 
opposition to the accord to avoid stirring up Tamil-
Sinhalese tension during the next administration. 
Premadasa as President. Premadasa's economic 
interests suggest he would look favorably on economic 
cooperation with the West if he were to become 
president. Premadasa, with his merchant 
constituency, has a strong reputation as a pragmatic, 
pro-business Minister. We believe he would strongly 
favor continuation of the Jayewardene government's 
market-oriented economic policies. 
7 
As Prime Minister, Premadasa has concentrated on 
domestic affairs and has rarely spoken out on foreign 
policy issues. He long avoided taking a position on Sri 
Lanka's communal problems, but he is widely 
regarded as strongly anti-Indian. He argues that 
India, unhappy with Sri Lanka's foreign policy 
independence since the UNP's rise to power in 1977, 
is trying to teach the Sri Lankan Government a 
lesson. US Embassy officials say he believes that 
India's policy of regional hegemony played a role in 
New Delhi's support for the Tamils. Premadasa also 25X1 
has said that the Soviet Union is encouraging India to 
press Sri Lanka to accept the Nonaligned Movement's 
lead on foreign policy. 25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
SLFP Leadership. The accession of an SLFP leader 
probably would lead to a government less willing to 
cooperate with the United States than Jayewardene. 
During her two terms as prime minister (1960-65, 
1970-77), Bandaranaike favored a socialist-oriented 
economy, nationalizing banks, private industries, and 
most schools. US-Sri Lankan relations during her 
periods in office were regularly marked by tensions. 
After she returned to power in 1970, for example, she 
expelled Peace Corps and Ford Foundation personnel 
and terminated some US programs, claiming they 
were fronts for US intelligence operations. 
25X1 
More recently, SLFP leaders have said they would 
favor a more genuinely nonaligned policy, according 
to the Embassy. In addition, at an SLFP convention 
in 1986, the SLFP bucked proponents of its earlier 
socialist-oriented economic programs and issued a 
platform saying it would maintain the country's open 
economy, expand the free trade zone, and promote 
exports.

India-Sri Lanka: 
Prospects for Sustained 
Military Intervention 
India can maintain a sizable military presence in Sri 
Lanka virtually indefinitely, but it will face problems 
enforcing the Indo-Sri Lankan peace accord in the 
face of determined Tamil or Sinhalese opposition. We 
believe Tamil insurgents will retain sufficient 
weapons to resume military activity despite provisions 
in the accord for arms surrender. Indian troops and 
Sri ZLankan officials will become increasingly likely 
targets of terrorist attacks by young Sinhalese 
radicals, especially if joined by Sri Lankan Army 
units. In our judgment, New Delhi will use whatever 
military force it believes necessary to enforce the 
accord, but it will avoid any long-term engagement 
that will leave its troops in Sri Lanka caught in the 
middle of renewed fighting. 
India's Intervention in Sri Lanka 
Within hours of the signing of an accord between 
New Delhi and Colombo on 30 July for an end to Sri 
Lanka's internecine fighting, Indian troops began 
landing on the island's northern Jaffna Peninsula to 
serve as a "peacekeeping force." Forces had been on 
heightened alert in southern India at least since early 
June, when New Delhi airdropped supplies into Jaffna 
to provide relief to Tamil civilians suffering under the 
government's three-month blockade of the insurgent-
held peninsula. Although the Indians may have 
planned originally to fight the Sri Lankan Army, the 
accord calls for Indian troops to secure key areas, 
monitor and enforce the cease-fire, and assist Sri 
Lankan authorities in receiving weapons surrendered 
by the insurgents. 
The Indian occupation of northern Sri Lanka was 
swift. Approximately 3,000 troops from the 54th 
Infantry Division, augmented by BMP armored 
personnel carriers, were airlifted to the Jaffna 
peninsula in a matter of days and established a line 
separating Sri Lankan security forces from the 
insurgents. The aircraft then began transporting Sri 
Lankan Army units south to Colombo, where they 
were needed to quell Sinhalese rioters. 
9 
Within a few days, the Indian Navy began ferrying 
additional 54th Division troops to Trincomalee. This 
force, also about 3,000 strong with some BMPs, 
secured the city and moved north and northwest. It 
soon linked up with troops moving south from Jaffna 
and then moved south to Batticaloa?relieving Sri 
Lankan Army units and helping accept surrendered 
arms from the insurgents. 
About 10,000 Indian troops had arrived in Sri Lanka 
by the end of the first two weeks of intervention. 
These forces probably included all three maneuver 
brigades of the 54th Division, a brigade of the 18th 
Infantry Division, attached BMPs, and at least four 
batteries of artillery from the 50th Parachute 
Brigade. The four brigades probably were operating 
out of Jaffna and Mankulam in the north and 
Trincomalee and Batticaloa in the east?well 
deployed to control Tamil areas. According to the 
has made plans to bring 
over the rest of the J4th Division and units from other 
divisions?including tanks?that could bring the 
number of Indian troops in Sri Lanka to around 
25,000 within a few weeks. 
Sri Lanka as a Battleground 
We believe the Indians will have little difficulty 
maintaining a large and extended military presence in 
Sri Lanka. A sizable slice of India's 1.1 million-man 
Army has no immediate border commitments and, in 
our judgment, can be kept supplied almost indefinitely 
from bases in southern India by naval craft and Air 
Force transports. The major determinant of the 
duration of the Indians' stay will be New Delhi's 
ability to implement the accord's provisions, which in 
turn depends on the degree of resistance from either 
the Sinhalese or Tamils.

Secret 
India's Military Intervention Capabilities 
India has sizable forces to project military power in 
the Indian Ocean. The Indians can transport up to 
two infantry brigades?as many as 5,000 men?with 
accompanying artillery and armor in a single 
amphibious operation. The Navy has nine recently 
acquired Soviet- and Polish-built Polnocny class 
mechanized landing craft and eight utility landing 
craft stationed with its amphibious squadron at 
Vishakhapatnam on the east coast. Press reporting 
indicates the Indians have finished construction of an 
indigenous mechanized landing craft and plan to 
build another. The Navy exercises its amphibious 
squadron annually, escorted by submarines, frigates, 
destroyers, and one of its two aircraft carriers in joint 
operations with the Army and Air Force. According 
to some recent 
exercises have included civilian ships that help 
bolster the fleet's troop lift and logistic support 
capacity. 
The Army's 54th Infantry Division?about 16,000 
strong?is India's frontline force for intervention in 
Indian Ocean states. The 54th Division, stationed in 
the south, has long experience in amphibious 
operations, and its 91st Brigade?about 2,500 
strong?is often deployed in the Navy's annual 
exercises. Other divisions stationed in southern and 
central India with no immediate border commitments 
are likely to be ordered to provide follow-on echelons 
in a large intervention. the 
Army has proposed the creation of a standing marine 
force, patterned after the US Marine Corps, as well 
as an air assault division of helicopter-borne troops 
for highly mobile operations, and it appears to be 
planning to use the 54th Division as the nucleus for 
these forces. The Army also is planning to buy about 
150 upgraded Swedish IKV-91 amphibious tanks, 
some of which we believe would replace the 54th 
Division's aging T-55 tanks. 
India has improved its ability to support its 
intervention forces with airpower as well as deploy 
airborne forces. The Air Force has 10 Soviet-built IL-
76 heavy transports and around 100 AN-32 medium 
transport aircraft and plans to buy 15 more IL-76s 
and 20 more AN-32s. The Air Force also has 
augmented its fleet of Soviet-built MI-8 transport 
helicopters with larger, more powerful MI-17s. The 
Air Force's transport fleet is capable of carrying 
follow-on echelons of Indian troops into Sri Lanka 
quickly and supplying them until local bases are 
established. These aircraft could also deploy to Sri 
Lanka all of the 4,500-man 50th Parachute Brigade 
in an airborne assault, should that type of quick 
reaction be necessary. Combat air support for Indian 
ground forces would probably be provided by 
deploying to the south some of the Air Force's 50 
Jaguar strike aircraft or 40 Mirage 2000 multirole 
aircraft as well as land- or carrier-based Sea Harrier 
jump-jets of the Indian Navy. 
All services 
have permanent or temporary facilities in Madras 
that can be augmented and used  to coordinate 
operations near or in Sri Lanka. 
Resistance to Indian troops is more likely to come, at 
least in the short term, from Tamil insurgents. So far, 
India's military presence in Sri Lanka is confined to 
Tamil-dominated areas of the Northern and Eastern 
Provinces. Press reporting indicates that in the two 
weeks following the accord the most powerful 
insurgent group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Secret 
Eelam, surrendered only about 800 weapons?mostly 
old ones?of the 5,000-piece arsenal we estimate they 
possess. Tiger leaders promised to surrender their 
weapons by New Delhi's 18 August deadline but

Secret 
turned in only a couple hundred more. The Indian 
Army estimates the Tiger arsenal at 2,000 pieces?
which we believe is too low and may allow for a 
weapons surrender acceptable to New Delhi but still 
leaves a substantial amount of arms in insurgent 
hands. Colombo believes Tamil groups are hiding 
caches of arms in the north and east as well as 
spiriting some to supposed safety in southern India. 
The Indians may eventually have to press the Tamil 
leadership to surrender more weapons to preserve the 
accord. If this is unsuccessful, the Indians are likely to 
decide their only alternative is to mount extensive 
cordon-and-search operations to root out and seize 
major portions of the insurgents' arsenal. Such 
operations would increase chances of armed resistance 
to the Indians. 
As the Indian presence drags on, chances of resistance 
from Sinhalese radicals will grow. So far, Sri Lankan 
President Jayewardene has been successful in 
countering Sinhalese political opposition to the peace 
accord and maintaining the loyalty of the Army in 
quelling rioting and other acts of violence by 
dissatisfied Sinhalese. Still, Sinhalese chauvinism 
runs deep among political opposition leaders and 
military officers. Radical groups adamantly oppose 
the accord and may exploit their contacts with 
mainline Sinhalese organizations to undermine it. 
Colombo is concerned that Sinhalese radicals have 
infiltrated the armed forces, giving them access to 
military training and eventually the ability to weaken 
the military's loyalty to the present government,  
if 
Jayewardene is threatened and insure the survival of 
both the government and the accord. 
Although Indian forces may be able to handle armed 
opposition from either the Tamils or the Sinhalese, we 
believe they are less prepared to maintain their 
peacekeeping role should fighting break out between 
the two ethnic communities. New Delhi may try to 
head off this situation by allying itself with the side 
that still supports the accord, but it would be denied 
this opportunity should both the government and the 
Tamils fall away from the agreement at the same 
time and resume hostilities. Indian troops not only 
would have failed in their mission to guarantee peace 
on the island, but would be faced with two different 
types of military threats simultaneously. We believe 
New Delhi would then consider gambling on a major 
commitment?flooding the island with troops, seizing 
Colombo and other southern cities, and beginning 
counterinsurgency operations in the north?but only 
if it believed such actions could achieve quick results. 
We believe Sinhalese radicals are capable of 
launching terrorist attacks against Indian forces and 
government officials--such as the hand grenade 
attack on the Sri Lankan Cabinet on 18 August. 
These attacks would not cause enough Indian 
casualties to prompt a military withdrawal from the 
island, in our view. The Indians probably would strike 
back at the terrorists but could not stamp out their 
activity. Government officials are more vulnerable, in 
our judgment, and the future of Colombo's adherence 
to the accord would be significantly jeopardized by 
Jayewardene's assassination.

Outlook 
In our judgment, New Delhi will use whatever 
military means it considers necessary to enforce the 
Sri Lankan peace accord, but it will try to avoid a 
long, hostile, and ambiguous involvement. Should 
both Colombo and the insurgents break away from 
the accord, the Indian Army would become a hostile 
foreign presence in Sri Lanka with nothing to 
continue enforcing. In our judgment, New Delhi is not 25X1 
prepared to pay the political or military costs of a 
prolonged and embarrassing occupation of Sri Lanka, 
especially with its troops caught in the middle of 
renewed fighting. We believe that, if Indian troops 
fail to prop up or reinstate a government in Colombo 
that supports the accord and do not succeed in 
containing renewed fighting between Sinhalese and 
Tamils, New Delhi would attempt to extricate its 
forces.

Bangladesh: 
Is Another Coup Imminent? 
Bangladesh's President Ershad is losing support from 
the nation's Army. Since Ershad's successful coup in 
1982, the Army has been his primary base of power, 
but officers and enlisted men are dissatisfied with the 
corruption on the part of Ershad and his senior 
generals and alarmed at recent civil strife and the 
possibility of a new, pro-Indian government. No 
figure has emerged as a clearly preferable alternative 
to Ershad in the Army's eyes, but there are rumors of 
coup plotting. Soldiers recently attempted to 
assassinate the President. Ershad's efforts to buttress 
his power have lessened but not eliminated the 
probability of a military coup this year. 
The Army's Dissatisfaction With Ershad 
 Corruption is endemic in Bangladesh, 
but, according to US Embassy reporting, many 
soldiers and civilians perceive that President Ershad, 
his family, and his appointees are outstanding 
examples of venality even by Bangladeshi standards. 
soldiers are 
convinced that they are now issued jute socks because 
officials are selling their standard-issue wool socks 
and pocketing the profits. 
The Army is also disgruntled by Ershad's handling of 
events surrounding the District Council Bill,  
according to the As 
part of his effort to demonstrate his support for the 
Army, Ershad conceived and rushed through 
Parliament the bill, which authorized the President to 
appoint senior Army officers to nonvoting posts on 
local development councils. The bill has been highly 
controversial and helped spark a 54-hour work 
stoppage in Dhaka in late July that led to 
antigovernment protests and widespread rioting.

 officers and enlisted 
men appreciate Ershad's attempt to give them a 
greater role in governing the country but worry that 
the senior officers serving on the local councils will 
use the positions to line their pockets. 
Corruption and misrule have angered many civilians 
who have vented their frustrations on the military. An 
Army recruiting office in Dhaka was burned by an 
antigovernment mob, and soldiers were beaten in 
other parts of the city during the 54-hour work 
stoppage in July, 
Officers and men on leave have been abused by 
families and neighbors who are angry with Ershad's 
regime. junior 
and middle-level officers worry that the corruption of 
Ershad and his senior generals is tarnishing the 
Army's prestige and pitting civilians against the 
military as a whole.

The Army's dissatisfaction with President Ershad and

Political parties opposed to President Ershad have 
gained adherents in the Army. 
 two-thirds of the Army now support the

served in his former regiment or had worked with him

Secret 
Pakistan: Rough Waters for 
New Maritime Agency 
Pakistan inaugurated its new Maritime Security 
Agency (MSA) early this year to protect the country's 
territorial waters and defend its economic rights in the 
Arabian Sea. The MSA has achieved some success in 
apprehending foreign fishing vessels allegedly 
trespassing in Pakistani waters, but half-staffed 
ranks, outdated equipment, and low morale severely 
limit the Agency's operational capabilities. In our 
judgment, the MSA will play an increasingly 
important maritime role but will constantly face the 
challenge of acquiring adequate resources. The 
Agency is looking to the United States and other 
Western countries for training and equipment to 
strengthen its capabilities. 
Mission 
The MSA?a civilian agency under the Ministry of 
Defense headquartered in the port of Karachi?is 
supposed to protect Pakistani fishing and economic 
exploitation rights within Pakistan's 320-kilometer 
exclusive economic zone, primarily through fishery 
protection and prevention of illegal immigration and 
smuggling. Other MSA responsibilities include 
pollution control, oceanographic and scientific 
research, and assistance to ships and personnel in 
distress. 
Islamabad could not assert and enforce jurisdiction 
and sovereignty over these waters before the creation 
of the MSA, according to Pakistani press reports.  
the MSA was 
created to supplement the activities of the corrupt and 
largely ineffective Coast Guard. The Agency is 
modeled after the US Coast Guard, even to the extent 
of using an identical red, white, and blue color scheme 
on its vessels. The MSA is gradually coming under 
the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior, 
presumably because of its domestic security 
responsibilities. 
Commodore Syed Rashid Hussain, a Pakistan Navy 
officer, has been named the MSA's first director 
general. Commodore Hussain,  I _  
s considered a particularly sharp 
17 
officer with no history of corruption?probably an 
important factor in his selection. In addition, Hussain 
professes to be close to the Chief of the Naval Staff  
Inadequate Resources 
Islamabad has not yet fully staffed the MSA. It was 
initially staffed with naval personnel, and only about 
half of the Agency's 1,060 positions are filled, 
Some 
personnel have been permanently assigned to the 
MSA, but others are on two- or three-year rotations 
and will return to the Navy. The MSA hopes to 
eventually remedy this by filling all of its positions 
with qualified civilians, 
Equipment at the MSA consists of Navy castoffs. The 
Agency's only vessels?an outdated ex-British 
destroyer and four aging Chinese-built patrol craft?
greatly limit its patrolling capabilities. The destroyer, 
cannot leave port on 25X1 
its own power and is strictly a floating headquarters. 
because of 25X1 
the MSA's small number of patrol craft, patrols have 25X1 
no regular course but remain in what they consider 
the "hot spots"?probably the waters near Karachi. 
In addition, the MSA does not have its own 
communications net and must rely on the Navy to 
maintain contact with MSA vessels at sea.

The MSA is looking to the US Coast Guard and at 
least one US shipbuilding firm to strengthen its 
operational capabilities. The US Embassy in 
Islamabad reported in January that the MSA had 
indicated a desire for narcotics interdiction training, 
and in April a US Coast Guard training survey team 
visited Pakistan to determine the training 
requirements of the MSA as well as Pakistan's Coast 
Guard and Navy. The Agency's search for new patrol 
boats has led it to at least one US shipbuilder, which 
appears to be one of those favored from a large list of 
possible contractors. 
hat the overriding factor in the 
contract selection will be cost, even at the expense of 
performance. 
Other Problems Facing the Agency 
Morale is low at the MSA, largely because of the slow 
manner in which it is being transferred to the 
Ministry of Interior. 
MSA personnel remain on straight naval pay and 
have not received the additional pay and allowances 
associated with Ministry of Interior employment. 
Morale has been further damaged by the movement 
of the Agency's mother ship from the Karachi Port 
Trust berth, with easy access to and from the city, to 
the center of the harbor, where crew changes and 
routine duties are more difficult. 
Tensions have arisen between the director of the MSA 
and the Karachi Port Magistrate, 
Although the Agency 
possesses the legal powers to arrest and detain 
individuals suspected of breaking the law, it does not 
have facilities to keep those it arrests for any period of 
time and must turn them over to the Karachi Port 
Magistrate for detention and trial. The magistrate is 
critical of the MSA's director and accused him of 
Secret 
trying to start a war by seizing hundreds of Indian 
fishermen last spring. We suspect the magistrate's 
criticism was due more to the fact that he suddenly 
experienced a tremendous increase in his workload. 
The initial controversy over jurisdiction between the 
Agency and the Coast Guard seems to have been 
resolved. According to the 
inauguration for four years.  
as of early July, the 
jurisdictions of the MSA and the Coast Guard had 
been defined to the satisfaction of both services. The 
MSA is responsible for enforcing Pakistani laws at 
sea, with its jurisdiction ending at the mouth of a port. 
The Coast Guard is responsible for land and riverine 
patrols and has authority within ports. Relations 
between the two could again sour once the MSA has 
been transferred to the Ministry of Interior and is 
competing with the Coast Guard for resources, but at 
present no evident jealousies exist between them. 
Political Dimensions 
The Agency is a pet project of Prime Minister Junejo, 
a native of Sind Province, and has become an 
important political issue for him. The MSA is 
generally believed by Karachi Port officials to be a 
means of building a constituency through the creation 
of jobs?both in the MSA and in Karachi shipyards?
and the protection of Sindhi fishermen from violations 
of Pakistani fishing grounds, 
The MSA was established amid allegations of 
repeated intrusions by Indian ships into Pakistani 
waters, according to press reports. MSA arrests of 
hundreds of Indian fishermen last spring provoked 
tensions with New Delhi and sparked retaliatory 
seizures of twice as many Pakistanis by the Indian 
Navy, The

 success 
in arresting Indian fishermen had forced New Delhi 
to negotiate the repatriation of the captured 
Pakistanis in exchange for the Indians, leverage 
Islamabad did not enjoy before the MSA's creation. 
Prime Minister Junejo, announcing the inauguration 
of the MSA, said it was regrettable that some 
countries?presumably India?misused their 
technological advantages to exploit illegally the 
maritime resources of developing countries. 
Outlook 
We expect some successes for the MSA in the coming 
months simply because its existence?however 
troubled?increases Islamabad's ability to enforce its 
sovereignty over Pakistan's territorial waters. The 
Agency has already demonstrated competence and 
initiative in performing its duties. Continued 
government budgetary support and a transfer to the 
Ministry of Interior relatively soon probably would 
13 enhance the o erational effectiveness of the MSA. 
A constant challenge for the MSA will be to acquire 
adequate equipment?both in numbers and quality?
to improve its operational capabilities. MSA funds, 
despite budget support from Islamabad, probably will 
never be adequate to purchase all or a large part of 
the equipment the Agency needs to maximize its 
effectiveness. The new patrol boats it plans to buy will 
only replace aging equipment and will not provide 
additional equipment. The stipulation that the boats 
be built in Pakistan almost certainly will delay their 
acquisition and might force the MSA to purchase 
equipment that does not meet its needs. It appears 
that the MSA's goal of strengthening its capabilities 
could be compromised by financial constraints that 
force the Agency to accept lower quality because the 
price is right. 
 In time, however, 
the Agency may well become a target for well-
established interests trying to protect lucrative illegal 
immigration, narcotics, and smuggling activities.

Pakistan: Political Conflict 
Inundates Kalabagh Dam 
The Pakistani Government is slowly moving forward 
with plans to develop the Kalabagh Dam, one of the 
world's largest earth-filled dams, in Punjab despite 
near unanimous opposition outside the province. The 
project has become a widely debated political issue. 
Critics of the project cite the $4-6 billion price tag 
and the shortage of water downstream as hazardous 
to the country's long-term social and agricultural 
development. Government officials counter that 
Pakistan can finance the project through aid?
including funds from the $2.28 billion six-year 
economic aid package from the United States?and 
that the power provided by the dam will boost 
industrial production and exports. Because 
loadshedding?selected power cutoffs?has become a 
fairly regular occurrence, exploitation of Pakistan's 
hydroelectric resources is vital to the country's  
industrial and economic development. 
Purpose of the Dam 
The Kalabagh Dam project is part of Islamabad's 
strategy to reduce its reliance on imported energy. 
Expenditures of $650 million on power projects 
comprise the single largest item?roughly 25 
percent?in the Annual Development Program in 
fiscal year 1987. Scheduled to be operational in 1993, 
the Kalabagh Dam initially would have a 2,400 
megawatt (mw) electrical capacity. Pakistan would 
then have an energy shortfall of 4,500 mw if the dam 
is not completed, 
When completed the dam would reach 3,600 mw, 
nearly doubling hydroelectric generating capacity, 
according to Pakistan's Water and Power 
Development Authority (WAPDA). 
Along with supplying low-cost hydroelectric power, 
according to WAPDA's official plan, the dam would 
assist in controlling the flood waters of the Indus 
River and provide irrigation water to Punjab and Sind 
Provinces. The Mangla and Tarbela Dams?currently 
the two largest dams in Pakistan?are becoming less 
useful for storing water and power generation as their 
reservoirs gradually full with sediment, according to 
press reporting. 
21 
Without the Kalabagh Dam, we believe the Pakistani 
economy will suffer continued power shortages and 
loadshedding that led to a 50-percent shortfall in 
WAPDA's system during a severe electricity shortage 
in January 1985. The effect of loadshedding cost 
Pakistani industry and trade more than $1 billion in 
fiscal year 1985, according to expert sources of the 
US Consulate in Lahore, and $1.8 billion in fiscal 
year 1986. 
Provincial Winners and Losers 
Officials in Punjab, dominant in national politics, 
support the Kalabagh Dam project. According to the 
US Consulate in Lahore, Punjabis have a 
longstanding priority to obtain more hydroelectric 
power and irrigation water. In a "Gallup Pakistan" 
poll done in April 1986, 63 percent of Punjabi 
speakers favored the project. Even the opposition 
leader in the Punjab assembly favors the dam, 
publicly stating that those who oppose the dam oppose 
Pakistan's development. 
The project would not be a total windfall for Punjab, 
in our opinion. Similar to the Mangla and Tarbela 
Dams, the main burden of resettlement will fall on 
Punjab, according to an interview with a WAPDA 
official. Some 60,000 to 70,000 people at a cost of 
$375 million will have to be relocated from villages in 
Punjab and the North-West Frontier Province to 
accommodate the 62,000 hectare flood plain created  
by the dam, according to official reports. 
Moreover, anti-Punjabi sentiment in the other 
provinces, which has been increased by the 
disproportionate effect on them of the Afghan war, 
could be further fueled by the Kalabagh Dam. The 
Punjabi-dominated military has had to step in on 
several recent occasions to settle ethnic disputes in 
Sind and the North-West Frontier, adding to anti-
Punjabi hostility in the smaller provinces. According

to US Embassy reporting, the Kalabagh Dam has the 
potential to unite Sind, the North-West Frontier, and 
Baluchistan against Punjab. 
Leaders elsewhere in Pakistan are not favorably 
disposed to the dam. Political leaders in the North-
West Frontier have seized on the Kalabagh Dam as 
another example of Punjabi domination on national 
issues. The North-West Frontier would lose 26,000 
hectares to flooding-42 percent of the affected area, 
according to official Pakistani estimates?while 
Punjab would receive most of the irrigation benefits, 
according to the North-West Frontier provincial 
government. The controversy has fueled calls for 
Pushtun nationalism the dominant ethnic group in 
the North-West Frontier. Leaders of the prominent 
Awami National Party have openly stated that the 
dam is meant to destroy the people of the frontier and

threatened to "blast the dam" if it is constructed. 
Local political leaders, according to Embassy 
reporting, have made claims that up to 2 million 
villagers would be affected by waterlogging because 
the Kalabagh reservoir would raise the water table in 
the North-West Frontier. 
Officials from Sind also have spoken out against the 
Kalabagh project, claiming the province would 
become a desert if the dam is constructed. Despite 
federal officials' claims to the contrary, Sind 
provincial officials are concerned that power 
generation will necessitate storing water upstream at 
the very times it is needed for irrigation, according to 
Embassy reporting. Leftwing leaders from Sind have 
stated to the press that the project is a blatant attempt

by Punjabis to expand their domination over the 
smaller provinces. Benazir Bhutto, the major 
opposition party leader whose base is in Sind, is 
against construction of the dam, citing its polarizing 
effect on Pakistan and recommending that alternative 
sites be considered, according to US Embassy reports. 
Troubled From the Start 
Similar to the immense Tarbela Dam project?
completed in 1976?the Kalabagh has met resistance 
since the first feasibility study was done in 1953. 
Many of Tarbela's problems, according to a civil 
engineer who worked on the dam, stemmed from poor 
construction and engineering designs that led to 
nearly 10 years of repair and modification before the 
project fulfilled its promise of flood control and power 
generation. Delays in the implementation of the 
Kalabagh Dam are centered around feasibility and 
design of the dam, according to press reports. 
Moreover, significant increases in the estimated cost 
of the project?from $2 billion to as much as $6 
billion?have brought back memories of Tarbela's 
budget, which overran planned costs by 80 percent. 
Securing the roughly $2.5 billion needed in foreign 
exchange for the project is the first hurdle Pakistan 
must overcome before construction can begin. 
Pakistan would be hard pressed to come up with the 
needed funds out of its own foreign exchange 
earnings. Foreign exchange reserves are only $900 
million. Mehbub-ul Haq, former Finance Minister 
and current Minister of Commerce, estimates that 
Pakistan could raise $100 million annually for seven 
years from the World Bank and like amounts from 
the Asian Development Bank, the Arab countries, and 
the Aid to Pakistan consortium?a group of Western 
nations?making a total of $2.8 billion. Haq believes 
additional funds for the dam could come from the $50 
million in development assistance provided yearly by 
the US aid package. 
We believe it will be difficult for Islamabad to fill the 
gap between foreign financing and the $4-6 billion 
price tag from the domestic budget. For example, 
officials were forced to rescind many proposals for the 
current budget to increase revenues?much of them 
23 
allocated to the Annual Development Program?in 
the wake of heated opposition to tax hikes. Pakistan is 
already under pressure from the United States and 
other donors to reduce its budget deficit?$2.5 billion 
in fiscal year 1987?and will be faced with some hard 
choices over allocating scarce funds to Kalabagh or 
other development needs. 
Outlook 
As the controversy continues, WAPDA has proposed 
alternative designs for the construction of the 
Kalabagh Dam to placate provincial opposition and, 
we believe, to demonstrate the government's 
determination to build a dam at Kalabagh. Original 
plans called for a dam height of more than 275 
meters, but, in view of the North-West Frontier's 
concerns about flooding, revised plans envisage an 
elevation of 250 meters, according to press reports. In 
addition, levees are to be built alongside to protect the 
flood plain of the dam. WAPDA officials have 
publicly stated that, because of these revisions, 
irrigation water would be available in sufficient 
quantities to Sind, probably an attempt to allay fears 
of Sind officials that the dam would rob them of 
irrigation water. 
Alternative sites upstream of the Kalabagh and 
Tarbela Dams have been studied, but officials insist 
that they are part of development programs to exploit 
the Indus River after the Kalabagh Dam is finished. 
These sites?located in the Northern Areas of 
Pakistan?would provide equal or greater generating 
capacity than Kalabagh, according to Embassy 
reporting. Most critics agree that irrigation benefits 
from upstream sites would be shared equally by all 
provinces because there is no opportunity to divert the 
water in mountainous terrain. We believe donor 
countries favor upstream sites because they would 
raise fewer political concerns. The dam would not be 
located in populated provinces, and few people would 
have to be relocated. 
Although the project could substantially improve 
Pakistan's energy outlook, we believe that a firm 
decision to begin the project will not take place before 
the election scheduled for 1990. Prime Minister

Beijing sees the Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan as part of a larger Soviet strategy to 
encircle and isolate China and control the West's oil 
supply. Beijing cites the Soviet presence in 
Afghanistan?along with the Soviet troops along 
China's northern border and Soviet support for the 
Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia?as an obstacle to 
improved Sino-Soviet relations and a continued source 
of regional instability. In our view, Beijing supports 
the Afghan resistance--despite its anti-Communist 
orientation?in the belief that the Soviets will only 
withdraw from Afghanistan if the costs of the war 
grow unacceptably high. 
the 
Chinese are wary about political negotiations with the 
Soviets over Afghanistan. According to the US 
Embassy in Beijing, China supports the Geneva 
negotiations in part because they are a forum for 
publicizing Soviet activities in Afghanistan. The US 
Embassy reports, however, that Chinese leaders 
believe the Soviets are using the negotiating process to 
gain the time needed to strengthen their position and 
reduce foreign criticism of their presence in  
Afghanistan. China 
believes that concessions to the Soviets will only 
encourage further Soviet adventurism in South Asia. 
Chinese officials have termed Pakistan's seven-month 
withdrawal timetable as "quite reasonable," 
according to the US Embassy in Beijing, and have 
claimed that, if the Soviets were sincerely seeking to 
withdraw, they would propose an "acceptable" 
timetable. In our judgment, China will back any 
settlement that Pakistan is willing to sign but would 
probably urge Pakistan not to make concessions on a 
withdrawal timetable or the makeup of the post-
Soviet Afghan government.

Afghanistan in Sino-Soviet Relations 
China first sought improved relations with 
Afghanistan in 1960 in an effort to strengthen its 
regional position after an uprising in Tibet and border 
disputes with India. After more than a decade of 
neglect, Chinese interest in Afghanistan increased 25X1 
when  Mohammad Daoud deposed King Zahir Shah in 
1973. the Chinese 25X1 
believed Daoud?who as Prime Minister in the 1950s 
was partly responsible for Afghanistan's growing ties 
to the Soviet Union?carried out the coup under 
Soviet direction. Since the Soviet invasion in 1979, 
Afghanistan has become one of Beijing's chief Asian 
foreign policy interests?both, we believe, for its own 
sake and for the diplomatic benefits Beijing has 
reaped from its opposition to the Soviet occupation. 
25X1 
25X1 
In our view, China made little attempt to compete 
with the Soviet Union for influence in Afghanistan 
before the Afghan Communist takeover in 1978. In 
the 1960s contact was limited primarily to barter 
exchange and an aid program that ranked as one of 
China's smallest in Asia, 
Although China substantially increased its aid 
to Afghanistan in 1972?donating $44 million for 
Afghanistan's fourth five- year plan, 
  fghanistan was still only 15th 
on China's foreign aid list, in contrast to third on the

In January 1980 Beijing suspended bilateral political 
talks with the Soviets, declaring that they were 
"inappropriate" in the wake of the invasion, according 
to media reporting. Beijing has since cited the 
Afghanistan issue?along with Soviet support for the 
Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia and the Soviet 
troops along China's northern border?as one of three 
"obstacles" to improved Sino-Soviet relations.

Moscow in 1982, 
 Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has claimed that 
Sino-Soviet political relations will remain stalemated 
until all three obstacles?which Beijing claims are 
direct threats to Chinese security?are removed. 
According to the US Embassy in Beijing, the Chinese 
have told US officials that they rejected a Soviet 
proposal at the most recent Sino-Soviet talks in April 
to establish working groups on Afghanistan and 
Cambodia before reaching a broad bilateral political 
agreement. 
Despite reports of heightened Soviet interest in a 
negotiated settlement, China remains dubious of 
Soviet intentions. The sham withdrawal of about 
4,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan in October 
1986 according to the US Embassy in Beijing, 
appears, to have confirmed Chinese suspicions that 
the Soviets are not seriously seeking a solution. 
Beijing 
similarly interpreted a cease-fire announced by the 
Kabul regime in January 1987 as a Soviet attempt to 
exploit the West's limited attention span and improve 
the Soviet image. Beijing 
feared that the cease-fire would dry up Western 
assistance, enabling the Soviets to continue their 
occupation at a lesser cost. China has reacted to each 
of these Soviet "concessions" by reiterating its 
demands for a prompt and complete Soviet 
withdrawal. 
Chinese Aid to the Resistance 
Beijing has publicly declared that it provides both 
"moral and material support" to the Afghan 
resistance, but information about the actual amount 
of Chinese support is fragmentary. We estimate that 
the level of Chinese military aid increased by 20 to 30 
percent in 1986 to about $65 million in light and 
heavy arms. At the same time, however, actual 
Chinese contacts with the resistance have decreased, 
according to the US Embassy in Beijing. Although 
China had previously responded directly to resistance 
requests for training, occasionally providing weapons 
and medical training within China, Beijing now routes 
all resistance requests through Islamabad. As a result, 
resistance requests have declined, and fewer fighters 
have been trained in China. 
however, China still maintains direct contact 
Secret 
with the resistance through its Embassy in Islamabad, 
which sends officers to Peshawar four or five times a 
year to talk with resistance leaders. 
Although we believe resistance leaders are wary about 
dealing with a Communist power, most groups are 
apparently willing to accept Chinese aid. 
leaders of the fundamentalist 
Jamiat-i-Islami place a high priority on relations with 
the Chinese, less for what relations will yield in terms 
of practical assistance than for the prospect of using 
the Chinese to influence the Pakistanis. 
While supporting the resistance as the chief means of 
raising the cost to the Soviets of the Afghan 
occupation, Beijing is apparently unwilling to allow 
much media attention to its support. In May 1987, 
Chinese officials refused requests that they allow the 
establishment of a resistance press office in Beijing, 
according to diplomatic reporting. The Chinese press, 
we believe, has also moderated discussion of 
Afghanistan during periods of warming Sino-Soviet 
relations. 
Afghanistan in China's Third World Relations 
China has scored some diplomatic, economic, and 
military gains from the world reaction to the Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan, in our view. Beijing's 
attempts to increase military and economic 
cooperation with the West grew more successful when 
detente broke down after the Soviet invasion. Since 
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, China has taken 
advantage of reduced Soviet credibility with a series 
of overtures to Middle Eastern and African countries. 
We believe many of Beijing's diplomatic initiatives 
are aimed at using the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan 
to undermine Soviet influence in the Middle East. 
Chinese leaders told Islamic Conference Organization 
Secretary General Pirzada during his visit to Beijing 
in June 1987 that the "1 billion souls" represented by 
the organization and China's own 1 billion citizens 
account for a preponderant share of the world's 
population whose moral weight could be a strong 
barrier against Soviet "hegemonism," according to 
the US Consulate in Jiddah. Chinese leaders also

a major supplier of arms to Iran and Iraq?primarily, 
in our view, to earn hard currency. We believe, 
however, that China also sees these transactions as 
necessary to keep Tehran from turning to Moscow for 
arms and as increasing Iranian willingness to 
cooperate with China in support of the Afghan 
resistance. 
According to diplomatic sources, Beijing has actively 
lobbied the nonaligned states in support of Pakistani

reporting from the US Mission to the United Nations 
indicates that China, with Pakistan, has taken the

occupation and human rights abuses in Afghanistan. 
Reporting from US embassies throughout Africa 
indicates that Beijing continues to use the argument

The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan increased both

Tibet the de facto 
Soviet annexation of Afghanistan's Wakhan salient

are seen by Beijing as a direct threat to 
communications and transportation between Pakistan 
and China along the Karakoram Highway.l 
During Chinese Premier Zhao's visit to Pakistan in 
June 1987, he pledged continued support for 
Pakistan's Afghan policy and, according to media 
accounts, expanded Sino-Pakistani military and 
economic cooperation. According to the US Embassy 
in Beijing, Chinese humanitarian aid to the Afghan 
refugees in Pakistan during the first half of 1987 
included 1,250 tons of rice, 30 trucks, 800,000 square 
meters of cotton cloth, 200,000 pairs of a shoes, 50 
tons of tea, and approximately $100,000 worth of 
medical supplies 
Secret 
Role in a Settlement 
According to press accounts, Beijing favors a political 
solution to the Afghan problem based on the UN 
resolutions calling for a Soviet withdrawal. Chinese 
leaders have, according to these reports, repeatedly 
insisted that the withdrawal must be unconditional to 
prevent Moscow from gaining political advantages 
that it could not have won militarily. According to 
media reports, Beijing rejects Soviet demands for 
guarantees of noninterference in Afghanistan before a 
withdrawal, as well as any direct negotiations with 
Kabul that might indirectly legitimize the regime. 
Although China can influence negotiations on 
Afghanistan, we do not believe it has direct influence 
over the eventual outcome and will probably accept 
any Afghan deal agreed to by Pakistan. We believe 
Beijing's material and diplomatic support for 
Pakistan, however, is important to Islamabad's ability 
to continue its Afghan policy. The Soviet and Afghan 
regime's sabotage campaign inside Pakistan has led to 
rising domestic criticism of the government's policy 
toward the Afghan refugees. In our view, Chinese 
I support for the Afghan resistance helps Islamabad 
combat the growing domestic perception that the 
Afghan question is simply a US-Soviet issue. Pressure 
from Beijing to remain firm on conditions for an 
Afghan settlement may become even more important 
if Pakistan's efforts to acquire a nuclear capability 
lead to reductions in Western aid.

Afghanistan: Mine Warfare 
Takes a Toll 
Mine warfare has had a significant impact on military 
operations in Afghanistan. The extensive use of mines 
by Soviet, Afghan regime, and insurgent forces has 
caused high military and civilian casualties. Over the 
past few years, mine warfare in Afghanistan has 
become so varied and complex?because of the 
introduction of new mines and more sophisticated 
emplacement techniques?that development of 
reliable countermeasures has become increasingly 
difficult. 
Dramatic Impact of Mine Warfare 
Resistance minelaying has been costly for Soviet and 
Afghan regime forces. Widespread mining around 
Herat over the past year, in particular, has resulted in 
numerous casualties, including Mohammad Ali 
Samem?the ruling party's provincial committee 
secretary?and three army commanders. Elsewhere, 
the mere threat of 
landmines has slowed movement of Soviet and regime 
forces and supply convoys and forced groups to be 
preceded by a minesweeper. The mine threat has 
turned a three-hour trip from Kabul to Jalalabad into 
a 12-hour journey. According to US Embassy sources, 
Soviet convoys moving between Qandahar and Herat 
often go off the road because of heavy mining and the 
threat of insurgent attack on the main road. 
insurgent 
commanders are increasingly worried about the 
effectiveness of Soviet mine warfare and characterize 
it as a serious problem 
 mine-induced casualties, by far the most 
frequent, have had a harmful effect on resistance 
morale. the Soviets 
have successfully used mines to cut off resistance 
escape routes and to force the insurgents to use 
secondary infiltration and resupply routes?causing 
higher transportation costs and delays in delivery 
time. 
29 
Secret 
Soviet and Regime Forces' Improvements 
The Soviets have significantly upgraded their mine 
warfare capabilities in Afghanistan with the 
development of new mine types and delivery systems. 
Most of these new models are more lethal and 
designed to thwart insurgent disarming and 
countermeasure techniques: 
he Soviets began 
using seismic mines in 1985.  
the mines can be detonated selectively 
within a 10-kilometer range. 
Last year the Soviets introduced a new pressure-
activated, blast-type antipersonnel mine. 
it is more shock 
resistant than its predecessor and contains a unique 
molded rubber cap that acts as a counter-
countermeasure.

the Soviets have 25X1

? The Soviets are using a new family of fuzes for 
conventional landmines. The new fuzes, according 
to technical analysis, probably are being used to 
convert standard landmines to complicated delayed-
detonating or antidisturbance munitions to foil 
insurgent countermeasures.

at least 2 million mines had been strewn along 
Afghanistan's border with Pakistan by 1985. 
The Soviet and Afghan regime forces have made 
extensive use of mines to protect defensive perimeters, 
lines of communication, and urban areas. 
insurgents have a healthy respect 
for the minefields that encircle most Soviet garrisons, 
airfields, and field positions because of the tripwires, 
boobytraps, and multiple mine types used. 
Soviet and Afghan 
sapper units have planted thousands of conventional 
antipersonnel mines in potential ambush sites and 
along primary highways to forestall attacks on 
convoys. Heavily mined defensive perimeters around 
Kabul, Qandahar, Herat, and Mazar-e Sharif have 
made it increasingly difficult, but not impossible, for 
guerrilla forces to  move in and out of the cities. 
Resistance Forces' Improvements 
The insurgents employ a variety of tripwired, 
pressure-detonated, or electrically detonated plastic, 
metallic, and homemade mines. 
most of these mines are of 
Soviet, British, Italian, and Czechoslovak 
manufacture. Most of the Soviet models have been 
seized during combat operations. Many insurgent 
groups also build their own mines by using 
unexploded Soviet aerial ordnance and explosives, 
Mines are among the more popular weapons for the 
resistance because they offer a relatively cheap, low-
risk, and efficient means to inflict casualties on Soviet 
and regime troops. Panjsher Valley insurgents 
consider them to be among the most effective weapons 
in their inventory, 
The guerrillas use mines primarily against Soviet and 
Afghan supply convoys and troop movements, as well 
as along avenues of approach to insurgent positions. 
some 
Secret 
guerrillas mine roads and shoulders to destroy 
vehicles that attempt to attack insurgent ambush 
positions. Hizbi 
Islami (Khalis) insurgents in the Qandahar area have 
become adept at destroying enemy armored vehicles 
by using interconnected antipersonnel mines to trigger 
antitank mines by a connecting detonator cord. In 
some areas?such as Herat, Baghlan, and the 
Panjsher Valley?insurgents also mine roads, 
hillsides, and primary elevations to slow the advance 
of enemy forces. Soviet heliborne troops are 
particularly concerned about Panjsher Valley 
commander Masood's method of mining potential 
landing zones near his bases, 
Countermeasures Inadequate To Deal With 
the Threat 
The Soviet and Afghan regime forces have had 
difficulty overcoming the insurgent mine threat 
because of inadequate training, insufficient 
manpower, and effective insurgent countermeasures. 
The neutralization of large quantities of insurgent 
landmines creates a constant drain on Soviet and 
Afghan engineer resources. 
The Soviets have used a variety of equipment and 
techniques for mine clearing. Soviet magnetic mine 
detectors, mounted on trucks or armored vehicles, 
were used effectively during the initial months of the 
war but were obsolete by mid-1980 when the 
insurgents introduced nonmetallic mines, 
Soviet and regime forces have since 
relied heavily on the Soviet tank-mounted KMT-5 
mine plow and roller, even though the plow cannot 
negotiate steep grades, tears up roads to a depth of 
approximately 30 centimeters, and slows convoys to a 
speed of approximately 2 to 3 kilometers per hour. 
The insurgents have devised a counter to the KMT-5 
by laying mines on hilltops because the vehicle must 
roll over the crest with its plow raised before making 
contact with the ground.

The insurgents' countermeasures are comparatively 
rudimentary. Their methods?based on lessons 
learned from combat and word of mouth?are 
generally slow and extremely dangerous. 
the guerrillas' most significant 
countermine problem is dealing with perimeter mine 
belts during attacks on Soviet and Afghan regime 
positions. Masood recently indicated to a 
knowledgable Western observer that he and many 
other commanders in northern Afghanistan are often 
prevented from overrunning regime and Soviet 
outposts because of an inability to neutralize the 
minefields surrounding them. Masood emphasized his 
immediate need for more sophisticated minefield-
clearing equipment. 
To get through minefields, resistance forces resort to 
several tactics. 
one of the more effective mine-clearing 
techniques is a hand-held rake. The rake is used by an 
insurgent to clear a path through a minefield. The 
rake scoops up shallow buried mines. The ones that 
are not tripwired or boobytrapped are picked up by 
hand. Exploding boobytrapped mines destroy the rake 
but usually not the operator. In other areas, the 
insurgents drop ladders in a series across a minefield, 
exploding any mines under the rails, and then use the 
ladder's rungs as a bridge. Some insurgents have also 
Secret 
used animals or prisoners to clear paths through 
minefields. 
hand-held electronic 
mine detectors have not been highly effective in 
Afghanistan because most of the areas where mines 
are encountered have been subjected to repeated air 
and artillery bombardment that has left metal 
splinters that foil the detectors. In other cases, the 
insurgents have been unable to properly operate the 
hand-held equipment because of inadequate 
instructions. 
Outlook 
Mine warfare in Afganistan is likely to become more 
complex and casualties are likely to increase as Soviet, 
regime, and insurgent forces continue to improve their 
mining capability with new mine types, delivery 
systems, and minelaying techniques. The Soviets and

Syria: Debating Poli7  
on the Iran-Iraq War 
President Assad has initiated a controlled debate 
among his closest advisers on Syria's support for Iran 
in its war with Iraq. Assad's efforts this year to 
improve relations with Iraq, which appear to be 
motivated by tactical considerations, probably 
prompted him to seek the advice of his inner circle on 
the implications of breaking with Iran. Although all 
key decisionmakers in Damascus recognize that Iran's 
long-term Islamic agenda in the region conflicts with 
Syria's secular goals, opinions differ on the value of 
the "strategic alliance" when weighed against the 
short-term problems it creates with other Arab states, 
the Soviets, and efforts to impose political order in 
Lebanon. 
Sunni-Alawi differences do not play a key role in the 
Syrian debate over the Iran-Iraq war, in our view, nor 
does the debate split along interest group lines. The 
debate transcends these divisions and is instead 
focused on the relative costs and benefits of the 
alliance. 
External and Internal Impetus for Change 
Assad's decision to begin a dialogue with Iraq last 
spring probably resulted from growing external 
pressure to abandon his relationship with Iran: 
? Syria has long been pressed by the Soviet Union to 
abandon support for Iran in its war against the 
Soviets' other key ally in the region, Iraq. Assad has 
tried to use Syria's importance to the Soviets as a 
means of rebuffing Moscow's arguments. With the 
advent of the Gorbachev regime, however, Moscow 
has taken a harder line with Damascus on this issue. 
During Assad's trip to Moscow in April, Gorbachev 
hinted at possible reductions in Soviet aid if Syria 
failed to make progress in reconciling with Iraq. 
Assad's initial meeting with Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn last April probably resulted from Soviet 
pressure applied during Assad's meeting with 
Gorbachev earlier the same week, 
35 
Syrian Decisionmaking 
After 16 years of autocratic rule Assad still makes or 
is involved in all key policy decisions in Syria. 
Assad's maintains a loyal inner circle of advisers 
whose value is based more on their execution than on 
their formulation of policy. Since these individuals 
are hand picked by Assad, they necessarily identify 
with and support Assad's agenda. Assad holds 
consultations with key advisers to confirm his policy 
direction or to lay the groundwork for a possible 
policy shift. Although he allows the discussion of 
alternative positions on these occasions, once his 
decision is made, everyone is expected to support it 
without question. 
? Moderate Arab states, particularly those in the Gulf 
that have provided financial aid to Damascus, have 
pleaded with Syria to withdraw support from Iran, 
which they fear is determined to export its 
revolution throughout the Gulf. Assad justifies his 
position by claiming Syria is a channel for the

position.

from members of his inner circle who hold varying 
views on the issue. 
 these advocates have crystallized into distinct 
camps. 
Pro-Iran. This group of foreign policy pragmatists 
calls for continued Syrian support for Iran in the Iran-
Iraq war and opposes improving Syrian-Iraqi 
relations 
They argue that Syria can exploit Iranian radicalism 
to validate its rhetoric of actively confronting Israel. 
In particular, Syria can identify itself with Hizballah 
attacks against the Israeli security zone in South 
Lebanon. The pragmatists claim Iranian economic 
aid, particularly oil, is an important factor sustaining 
Syria during its current economic crisis. Finally, they 
believe an end to the Iran-Iraq war will diminish 
Syria's position in the region by allowing Iraq to 
reassert itself as a major player in pan-Arab affairs. 
The principal advocates of the pragmatist view are 
two Sunnis, Vice President for Foreign Affairs Abd 
al-Halim Khaddam and Army Chief of Staff Hikmat 
Shihabi, and an Alawi, Military Intelligence Chief 
Ali Duba. 
Anti-Iran. This group consists largely of hardline 
Ba'thist ideologues who yearn for a reunification of 
the Syrian and Iraqi Ba'th parties. They point out 
that Iran's export of Islamic fundamentalism poses a 
threat to Syria's Ba'thist regime and that Syria should 
Secret 
Finally, they believe 
that Iraq would be a better strategic ally than Iran in 
Syria's confrontation with Israel. The most influential 
advocates of these positions include Sunni Prime 
Minister Abd al-Ra'uf al-Kasm and two Alawis, 
Commander of the Special Forces Ali Haydar and 
President of the General Federation of Trade Unions 
Iz al-Din Nasir. 
It is worth noting that advocates of both camps 
appear to cut across bureaucratic lines within the 
regime. Assad is probably confident that the ad hoc 
nature of the debate will lessen the chance of serious 
policy divisions in his regime, which might be the case 
if, for example, the preponderance of advocates of one 
position were in the military and the other in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
We are skeptical of claims by some observers that 
Assad's approach to Iran is influenced by religious 
ties between Shiism and Assad's Alawi faith. Alawis 
are not Shias, although Assad sought recognition for 
the Alawis in the early 1970s from Lebanese Shia 
leader Musa Sadr. 
Assad sees Iran as a key strategic ally for 
the Arabs against Israel, and his main goal is to 
prevent a resumption of the close Israeli-Iranian ties 
that existed in the Shah's era. Assad has been 
working to improve Syrian-Iranian ties since the early 
1970s and was a major supporter of the Islamic 
resistance to the Shah. For example, the Iranian 
Islamic ideologue Ali Shariati was given a state 
funeral in Damascus after his mysterious death in 
1977. We believe Assad's hatred of Iraqi leader 
Saddam Husayn also plays a key role in his support 
for Iran.

Secret 
An outcome of breaking ties to Tehran that all 
members of Assad's regime probably believe is 
inevitable will be support by Tehran for Syrian 
subversives. The principal Syrian opposition group, 
the Muslim Brotherhood, has had some contact with 
Iran, but it is 
probably wary of a closer relationship because of 
Tehran's support for Assad. The Brotherhood, a 
Sunni fundamentalist organization, advocates an 
Islamic republic for Syria but has basic doctrinal 
differences with the Shias and is not likely to become 
an Iranian puppet. Should Damascus break with 
Tehran, we expect that the Iranians would offer the 
Syrian Muslim Brotherhood substantial support to 
challenge the Assad regime and that the group would 
accept such aid. 
Outlook 
Assad seems content to encourage the advocacy of 
opposing views among his lieutenants while steering a 
middle course. The Syrian President appears 
determined to keep his options open and finesse his 
relationship with both Iran and Iraq. In any event, 
should Assad decide to commit himself to one position 
or the other?a decision he alone will make?the 
debate will cease, and Assad's key advisers will be 
expected to fall into line.

Syria: Wheat Shortages Highlight 
Economic Vulnerabilities 
Syria is caught in a cycle of recurring wheat shortages 
that have emerged as the most serious aspect of the 
country's unprecedented economic crisis. President 
Assad will be forced to continue to make minor 
political concessions to obtain financial aid and gifts 
to weather the wheat shortages expected later this 
year. 
Syria has been a net importer of wheat since before 
Assad took power, but, until recently, Damascus 
could secure the necessary foreign exchange to 
compensate for the shortfalls in its harvests. Primarily 
rainfed, Syria's agricultural production has fluctuated 
widely. A combination of bad weather, poor planning, 
and severe hard currency shortages has produced the 
worst crisis in Syrian agriculture in Assad's rule. 
According to the US Embassy, Assad's acute need for 
additional wheat early this spring was a contributing 
factor in his willingness to meet with his archrival, 
Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. 
Running on Empty 
According to the US Embassy, Syria ran out of wheat 
on 10 June but weathered the crisis by implementing 
stopgap measures. The Syrian wheat authority 
combined 50,000 tons of wheat borrowed from 
Jordan, an early domestic harvest, and flour 
purchased from France at a relatively high price by 
Syrian businessman Umran Adham. In addition, the 
Syrians increased the volume but reduced the quality 
of flour by grinding hull and bran into the flour. 
Bakeries were forced to reduce the size of bread 
loaves, according to the Syrian press, and, outside 
Damascus, deliveries were cut by 20 percent. 
Damascus has been acutely aware of the wheat 
problem and attempted to take measures to avoid 
bread shortages, but the delayed arrival of 100,000 
tons of free wheat pledged by Saudi Arabia after 
Assad grudgingly met with Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn caused Damascus to scramble to meet the 
crisis. Due in late June, delivery was stalled by 
arguments over the payment of delivery costs and how 
the wheat was to be shipped.

and armaments . . . able to negotiate deals with 
France through direct ties to the French Presidency 
. . . rumored to have lost enormous sums of money 
due to the price changes of wheat purchased for 
Damascus . . . personal motivation unclear. 
New Harvest 
Because of the severe shortages, Damascus began the 
1986-87 harvest season early in June. Hot winds 
prematurely ripened some of the grain, but these same 
winds were responsible for stunting wheat growth in 
other areas, such as a primary growing area in eastern 
Jazira region, which lacked rain. Revised estimates 
from the US Embassy indicate that the total harvest 
was relatively small?under 1.5 million tons, 
compared with an annual average of 1.9 million tons 
in the early 1980s. 
Damascus increased its efforts to fully utilize this 
year's crop. Besides raising the official purchasing 
price by 47 percent to encourage farmers to sell their 
crops to the government, authorities reduced the 
amount of wheat individual farmers could retain for 
personal use to 20 percent of their crop, according to 
the US Embassy. In previous years farmers were 
allowed to retain as much as 50 percent of their crop, 
which often found its way into the black market. In 
addition, the Embassy reports that Damascus is 
cracking down on illegal transportation of wheat, and 
the allotment skimmed off the top, previously 
assumed as "waste," is now tightly controlled.

Syrian Wheat Harvests in the 1980's 
? rarimseg. 
Despite these efforts, Damascus probably recovered 
no more than 40 percent of the harvest. Wheat that 
did not enter official channels was bought up in large 
quantities for animal feed, according to the Embassy. 
Even if Damascus succeeds in recovering some of this 
contraband, our best estimates are that Syria will be 
able to purchase no more than 600,000 tons of 
domestic wheat. Even in poor years, the US Embassy 
reports that the government has usually been able to 
purchase 700,000 to 800,000 tons. 
The Cycle Continues 
All evidence, including the government's large 
purchasing efforts, indicate that Damascus has no 
intention of changing its ad hoc approach to meeting 
current needs. Syria is milling approximately 4,600 
Secret 
tons daily and blending it with flour already promised 
from France and flour milled from the Jordanian 
wheat loan. The arrival of the Saudi gift, expected 
shortly, will be added to present consumption stocks. 
Human consumption needs amount to approximately 
1.5 million tons of wheat annually. Planned deliveries 
are sufficient to last for the next three to four months. 
Negotiations with French authorities are continuing 
through Syrian businessman Umran Adham for two 
deliveries of 150,000 tons each. If these deals succeed, 
Syria will once again need wheat in January 1988. 
The US Embassy estimates that, from February 1988

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/10/03: CIA-RDP05502029R000300950003-7 
until the next harvest in late May, Syria will have to 
purchase 360,000 tons of wheat for consumption, plus 
another 50,000 tons to repay the Jordanian loan. 
Outlook 
Unlike previous years when Syria had maintained a 
three-to-six-month stockpile, the wheat purchased by 
Damascus is being immediately consumed, not stored. 
Thus, the potential for a greater crisis looms down the 
road. Because the Syrian wheat authority is working 
without any reserve, it may be forced to conclude 
negotiations quickly and therefore drain hard 
currency by paying a higher price than it could obtain 
through extended negotiations. In addition, the efforts 
to purchase wheat for human consumption have 
reduced grain available for animal feed. 
Compounding the problem, the government's 
requirement that farmers sell such a large percentage 
of their crop to the state at a price lower than the 
market rate may discourage planting in the future. 
Damascus has faced the problem of insufficient wheat 
for some time, but with Syria's continuing hard 
currency shortage it is no longer possible to purchase 
all required commodities without reallocating funds. 
Also, without hard currency to purchase needed 
equipment, Syria cannot substantially increase the 15 
percent of total area presently irrigated to increase 
total output. Until Assad institutes reforms, such as

41 
Secret 
ending subsidies, or allocates hard currency from 
other sectors of the economy, such as the military, the 
wheat crisis will continue to recur. The measures 
taken thus far?a price rise accomplished by the 
reduction in loaf size, the adulteration of flour, and 
the crackdown on black-market opportunities?are 
shortsighted remedies. 
Given the autocratic and inflexible Syrian economic 
and political systems, true reform measures will be 
difficult to implement without direct presidential 
initiatives. Until such time, aid and gifts from abroad 
will continue to play a large part in avoiding domestic 
shortages. Therefore, the ability to supplement the 
harvest depends greatly on political choices, and 
Syria's economic vulnerability will remain a major 
political preoccupation for Assad.

Secret 
Beirut: Economic and Social 
Turmoil 
The continuing power struggle in Lebanon has 
transformed Beirut?once the commercial, 
intellectual, and tourist center of the Arab world?
into a lawless militarized zone contested by 
confessional and ideological factions. Turf battles, 
terrorism, rampant street crime, and the lack of 
centralized authority make the area, especially the 
Muslim western sector, extremely dangerous for both 
residents and foreigners. Beirut's lawlessness has 
markedly curtailed social and economic activities of 
Western institutions and provides sanctuary for 
extremists of various affiliations. 
West Beirut has become a patchwork of small areas 
loosely controlled by confessional or ideologically 
based militias and plain gangsters. The traditional 
dividing lines between West Beirut's sectarian 
neighborhoods have blurred as clashing militia forces 
plunge the city deeper into anarchy. Many fighters 
are uncommitted to any single militia and sell their 
services to the highest bidder. Over the last few years 
the pro-Iranian Hizballah has emerged as a new force 
to be reckoned with and has gained strength in the 
shantytowns of Beirut's southern suburbs and in the 
neighborhoods near the Green Line?the unofficial 
border between Muslim and Christian Beirut. 
East Beirut is somewhat more stable under Christian 
control. It is also generally more prosperous. The 
East, however, has experienced numerous turf battles. 
A series of coups, called Intifidas or uprisings, have 
occurred within the dominant Christian militia, the 
Lebanese Forces, killing scores of people since 1985. 
Power Vacuum 
Before the civil war Beirut was an open meeting place 
of Middle Eastern and Western culture. The 
Lebanese prided themselves on their sophistication 
and claimed with some justification that they 
benefited from the best of both worlds. In the late 
1960s the arrival of Palestinian fighters intent on 
43 
using the country as a base of operations against 
Israel sowed the seeds of Lebanon's political collapse. 
A civil war began in the mid-1970s as the burgeoning 
Palestinian presence disrupted relations between the 
country's disparate religious sects, and the central 
government collapsed. 
Lebanon's war in the streets is all but certain to 
continue as a generation reared in civil war comes of 
age in Beirut. Many young militiamen know no other 
condition. Fighting to them is a part of everyday life, 
as is the absence of government instruments of law 
and order. The Lebanese cannot work out a political 
deal between the country's confessional groups that 
would end the civil war, and each group continues to 
jockey for power and political status. The central 
government is too weak to assert its authority. Foreign 
attempts to stabilize West Beirut have, thus far, been 
failures. 
Beirut's Chaotic Economy 
All of Lebanon's population suffers from the unsettled 
situation, but Beirut residents have experienced the 
largest relative drop in living standards. The influx of 
Shia refugees from South Lebanon since 1975 has 
expanded the population of Beirut's southern suburbs 
by more than 500,000 and produced fertile ground for 
proselytization of disaffected Shia youth by radical 
Shia groups. Similarly, East Beirut was flooded with 
Christian refugees following the Israeli withdrawal 
from the Shuf region in 1985. The excessive burden 
on Beirut's poorly maintained public services results 
in erratic supplies of electricity and water and 
periodic shortages of fuel and staple foods. 
Despite growing economic problems, Lebanon still 
displays a dynamism that allows the economy to 
continue functioning. The resourceful population still 
possesses the talents required to survive, and many

even prosper. The absence of effective government 
control has resulted in one of the freest economies in 
the world: 
? Money transfers are not taxed or restricted, and the 
bank secrecy laws are legendary. 
? Most imports arrive through militia-controlled ports 
not subject to customs duties. 
? Deficit spending allows the government to continue 
providing salaries, telephone service, electricity, and 
subsidized wheat and fuel. The pound's 
unprecedented slide (in 1985 a pound was worth 20 
cents; now it is worth a half cent), however, may 
force reductions in spending. 
The chaotic environment allows Beirut's businessmen 
to operate with few regulations or burdensome taxes. 
As a result, Beirut is a center for a lucrative arms and 
narcotics trade. The city is also an entrepot for 
consumer goods imports for smuggling into Syria. 
Lebanon's currency depreciation has boosted exports 
of jewelry, clothing, furniture, and chemical products. 
A Lebanese economist estimates that exports 
expanded in 1986 to about $220 million. Lebanon's 
banking industry also remains vibrant, with over 
$3.56 billion in deposits at the end of 1986. The 
number of branch banks has expanded to more than 
620 to compensate for the difficulties in traversing the 
city. 
Beirut's remarkable resiliency is eroding. Inflation is 
running over 100 percent annually. Residents of 
Beirut, who rely on imports for most of their 
consumption, are hard pressed by higher prices, poor 
employment prospects, persistent housing shortages, 
and reduced availability of medical care. Beirut's 
lively foreign exchange market has shrunk from $10 
million to $3 million daily, with the Central Bank as 
the primary supplier of dollars. Lebanon's foreign 
payments, which were in surplus in 1985, fell into a 
$190 million deficit in 1986, according to a Lebanese 
economist. 
Secret 
Lebanon's confessional militias have asserted control 
as central authority has declined. The militias act as 
quasi-governmental institutions by collecting taxes 
and providing social services. For example, the 
Christian Lebanese Forces imposes a 5-percent 
surcharge on gasoline sales and collects taxes at ports, 
restaurants, cinemas, and the Casino du Liban. In 
return, the militia sponsors neighborhood repairs, 
subsidizes health care, and administers public 
utilities, such as trash collection in East Beirut. 
Foreign sponsors such as Syria, Libya, Iran, and 
Saudi Arabia also provide funds that fuel the Beirut 
economy. 
Outlook 
Syria is portraying itself as a moderating force in 
West Beirut and has pledged to restore order, but it is 
unlikely to be successful. Militiamen have been 
"disarmed," and Syria's military intelligence chief in 
Lebanon has pledged to ease traffic between the 
Christian and Muslim sectors. Under Syrian 
direction, the Lebanese Army has reopened several 
Green Line crossing points to pedestrian and truck 
traffic, although erratic closings are commonplace. 
Syrian troops have not deployed into East Beirut or 
the southern suburbs controlled by Hizballah. As long 
as Syria occupies only parts of the city, stability is 
unlikely. 
Beirut will continue to display a curious dynamism, 
but the prospect for economic recovery will diminish 
as increasing numbers of Lebanese emigrate and sever 
ties to the country, as evidenced by the estimated 70 
percent drop in expatriate remittances since 1980. 
Lebanon's economy can be expected to lurch along 
with the vast majority of the population becoming 
steadily impoverished and the prospect for genuine 
reforms unlikely because of confessional political 
differences.

Egypt and the M1A1 Tank: 
The Push for Coproduction 
Cairo welcomes the preliminary agreement to 
eventually coproduce the M1A1 tank as a sign of US 
intent to help Egypt continue its force modernization 
and to develop its military industries.' The Egyptians 
consider the M1A1 the "best tank in the world" and 
expect that it will significantly improve the 
capabilities of Egypt's armored forces. US military 
aid programs and the prospect of coproducing and 
exporting the tank to earn foreign exchange also are 
strong factors influencing the Egyptians' choice of the 
M1A1 over its competitors. 
A cancellation of the deal would temporarily hurt 
Cairo's relations with Washington and could lead to 
the resignation of Defense Minister Abu Ghazala, a 
strong supporter of military cooperation with the 
United States. In such a case, Egypt probably would 
turn to British and West German firms to fulfill its 
requirement for main battle tank production 
Search for a Main Battle Tank 
Cairo wants to acquire a new, more advanced main 
battle tank by the 1990s to improve its capabilities 
relative to its neighbors. The Army has about 2,400 
tanks in its inventory?M-60A3s, T-62s, T-54s, and 
T-55s. As a short-term solution until a new tank can 
be produced, Cairo is seeking to enhance the 
capabilities of its aging T-54 and T-55 tanks by 
retrofitting them with 105-mm British-made guns and 
adding new fire control systems. Even so, US 
Embassy sources say Armed Forces Chief of Staff 
General El Orabi is concerned about whether the 105-
mm gun?also on Egypt's M-60A3s--can defeat 
Libyan T-72s, and the Ministry of Defense is 
disturbed that the Libyans have antitank guided 
missiles that can penetrate the M-60A3's armor at 
more than 2,000 meters. Cairo expects the Soviets to 
supply Tripoli with even more advanced T-80 tanks 
during the next decade. Senior Egyptian defense

Egyptians will produce mostly the less sophisticated parts of the

officials also are uneasy about qualitative 
improvements in the Israelis' arsenal and hope a more 
advanced tank would be a strong deterrent to possible 
Israeli aggression. 
We suspect that national pride and a desire to lead the 
Arab world in terms of military technology are 
driving Cairo's search for a main battle tank. Senior 
Ministry of Defense officials have decided on more 
sophisticated technology?mostly from the West?
over simpler and less expensive tanks. We believe that 
they have met with a variety of suppliers, including 
the United States for the M1A1 and probably the 
West Germans for the Leopard II, France for the 
AMX-40, Italy for the OTO Malara OF 40, Japan 
for the Type 74, the British for the Vickers Mark VII,

Cairo's shortage of funds probably has restricted its 
options only to US tanks and others offered under 
concessional or grant programs. Without external 
assistance, Cairo does not have sufficient resources to 
pay for expensive, long-term projects, in our view. 
Slow Improvements in Capabilities 
Acquisition of the M1A1 probably would not 
dramatically enhance Egypt's military capabilities 
against Libya or Israel in the 1990s.3 We would 
expect Cairo to try to replace at least its oldest T-55s 
and T-62s with MlAls and to develop plans that 
would enable M1A1-equipped units to respond to 
threats on both Egypt's eastern and western borders. 
Nonetheless, possible improvements in the mobility, 
firepower, and armor protection in Libyan and Israeli 
armored units, probably with the T-80 and Merkava 
Only the MI A I, Leopard II, and T-72 are first line tanks. The 
others have lesser capabilities.

III and IV respectively, could offset the technical 
advantages of the M 1 Al. For example, the T-80 is 
faster, and both the T-72 and the T-80 outgun the 
M lA 1. The Israelis also are unlikely to be 
intimidated by Egyptian M 1 Al s. Besides having 
advanced Merkava tanks in their inventory in the next 
decade, the Israelis may buy their own MlAls. 
Integration of the M1A1 into Egyptian armored units 
is likely to be slow. The Egyptians continue to 
experience maintenance and training difficulties with 
the M60A3 and would face even more problems in 
trying to absorb a more advanced tank.' To take 
advantage of the M 1 Al's full capabilities, the 
Ministry of Defense would have to make adjustments 
in its tactical doctrine. The M 1 Al's speed, rapid 
maneuverability, and capability to fire accurately 
while moving, for example, encourage responsiveness 
to changing situations on the battlefield. Egyptian 
armored units, however, have eschewed tactical 
flexibility and continue to use standard Soviet 
formations and maneuvers that do not even fully 
exploit the capabilities of the M-60A3. 
Desire for Coproduction 
Egypt has long sought to reduce its dependence on 
foreign suppliers and may be willing to spend more in 
the short term to produce weapons indigenously than 
to buy them outright. Cairo is not interested only in a 
sale by the United States of M1A1 tanks, 
'We believe maintenance of the MI Al's turbine engine would pose 
a significant challenge to the Egyptians, given the region's desert

Defense Minister Abu Ghazala 
Field Marshal Mohamed Abdel Halem Abu 
Ghazala, Minister of Defense and Deputy Prime 
Minister, is popular with the armed forces and has 
emerged as one of the most popular and charismatic 
leaders in Egypt. The 57-year-old artillery officer is a 
veteran of four wars. Between 1976 and 1980 he 
served as defense attache in Washington, where he 
was an advocate of US-Egyptian defense cooperation. 
He became Minister of Defense in 1981 and was 
made Deputy Prime Minister and promoted to field 
marshal in 1982. 
Abu Ghazala 's power is second only to that of 
President Mubarak, and, as head of the armed 
forces, he commands the most influential single 
institution in Egypt. The Defense Minister remains 
strong in his support for US-Egyptian friendship and 
cooperation and has been able to silence critics by 
securing access to sophisticated arms for the 
military. 
Abu Ghazala also has consistently pushed for 
improvements in Egypt's defense industries and on 
many occasions has publicly stated that the 
military's aim must be to achieve self-sufficiency in 
arms production. We believe he is particularly 
pleased with his ability to reach an agreement with 
the United States to coproduce the M1A1 and 
probably looks at the project as another means of 
increasing his standing in the armed forces and 
against political rivals. 
E. Gazette ? 
Defense Minister Abu Ghazala 
The M1A1 deal comes during a time when a variety 
of setbacks are increasing Abu Ghazala 's sensitivity 
to criticism. Mubarak, with his reelection almost 
guaranteed this fall, has recently demonstrated his 
authority over the Defense Minister, especially by 
retaining his choice as Armed Forces Chief of Staff 
over Abu Ghazala 's objections. The Defense Minister 
also may be irked over the Mubarak government's 
decision to allow the Soviets to reopen consulates in 
Egypt. We suspect he continues to smart over his 
inability to achieve military debt relief from the 
United States 
We suspect that many senior 
defense officials are concerned that the military is 
developing a reliance on the United States similar to 
its dependence on the Soviets from the 1950s to the 
1970s, and this could leave Egypt unable to maintain 
and repair equipment if cooperation with the United 
States ended. 
Secret 
The Ministry of Defense probably hopes that Ml Al 
coproduction will serve as the keystone of its efforts to 
revitalize Egypt's defense industries and open new 
markets. Attempts to manufacture more sophisticated 
Western weapons were set back by Egypt's separate

peace with Israel and the subsequent withdrawal of 
Arab money from joint projects. The Arab Gulf 
states, however, recently have been seeking closer ties 
to Egypt, in part to counter the increased threat from 
Iran. Iraq already buys large quantities of Egyptian 
arms and ammunition, and Cairo expects the Saudis  
to try to acquire the 
 has 
continued to publicly promote the establishment of an 
Arab military industry and may try to exploit the 
gradual warming of relations to push for M 1 Al sales 
and renewed cooperation on defense production. 
Cairo's Perception of the Deal 
We believe Egypt's defense industry lacks the 
technological base, expertise, and manufacturing 
infrastructure to independently design and produce 
modern tanks. Nonetheless, with foreign technical 
assistance, the Egyptians turn out small arms, 
ammunition, artillery, vehicles, and aircraft of poor to 
fair quality. They probably could assemble the M1A1 
with US assistance. except 
for base metal manufacturing of specialty steel and 
aluminum, Egypt's arms factories could produce in 
limited quantities many of the parts needed to 
assemble a main battle tank. To insure M1A1 quality, 
substantial US supervision and participation in 
quality control inspections probably would be 
required. 
The Egyptians understand the initial agreement will 
lead to coproduction of the M 1 Al by 1996, but 
basically they will only be assembling the tank, mostly

using items manufactured in the United States. 
Gradually, they will begin making a limited number 
of parts for the tank?tracks, hubs, and road wheels, 
for example. They are not scheduled to produce key 
items, including the turret structure, special armor, 
selected fire control articles, engines, and 
transmissions. 
Nonetheless, the Egyptians are confident in their 
ability to assimilate the M 1 Al technology and are 
more ambitious than the initial agreement suggests 
 The Egyptians apparently also want to 
expand their production role at least by 
manufacturing the 120mm gun tube and training 
ammunition. 
Looking for Other Suppliers 
Cairo is not confident that the United States will give 
final approval to clear the M 1 Al for export and 
coproduction and is continuing to negotiate with other 
possible suppliers of sophisticated main battle tanks. 
Senior 
Egyptian ministry of Defense othcfals have made 
several trips to West Germany and the United 
Kingdom during the past six months to seek 
assistance, apparently for a tank that Cairo hopes to 
develop concurrently with the MIA I. 
Abu Ghazala has also been negotiating with Turkish 
officials about coproduction, though we suspect his 
eagerness far surpasses Ankara's.

New Egyptian tank _factory under construction at Abu Zabal 
the Defense Minister talked with the 
Turks in May about a joint effort to produce Leopard 
II tanks. Abu Ghazala probably also discussed the 
possibility of collaborating on M1A1 production. He 
publicly promoted Turkish-Egyptian coproduction of 
the M1A1 last spring, saying it would cut costs by as 
much as 40 percent, allow for parts specialization, and 
increase the scale of production. 
Implications 
Cairo believes it is furthering US-Egyptian 
cooperation and friendship in selecting the M1A1 and 
expects the United States to give final approval to the 
deal. Acquisition of the technologically sophisticated 
tank has become a matter of national pride for the 
Egyptians, particularly in light of US military aid to  
Israel. 
Defense 
Minister Abu Ghazala, a strong advocate of US-
Egyptian defense cooperation, also has a personal 
stake in the deal, having lobbied for the tank in 
Washington and publicly announced that Egypt has 
the license to coproduce it. 
Secret 
Washington Post C 
Cancellation of the deal would hurt US-Egyptian 
relations. Mubarak and other senior officials would 
regard such an action as displaying a lack of faith in 
Egypt's capabilities and as further evidence of 
Washington's willingness to put relations with Cairo 
behind those with Tel Aviv. Moreover, the Egyptians 
probably believe they are doing the United States a 
favor in choosing the M1A1 over its competitors 
because the deal will enhance military cooperation 
and increase Egypt's reliance on US technology. 
We would expect damage from a cancellation to be 
only temporary because of common strategic interests 
and Cairo's continuing need for US financial aid. 
President Mubarak, however, probably would respond 
to a cancellation by publicly lashing out at the United 
States. We would also expect him to become more 
recalcitrant in such areas as the transit of US nuclear-
powered warships through the Suez Canal. 
Temporarily putting distance between himself and the 
United States would help protect him from political 
attacks by critics of his close relationship with 
Washington.

Secret 
Defense Minister Abu Ghazala would be infuriated 
by the failure of the United States to give final 
approval to the M1A1 deal and might seriously 
consider resigning.  
 The Defense Minister appears to 
have staked his reputation on the M1A1 deal, 
boasting of plans to expand Egypt's defense 
industries, and publicly acknowledging the 
agreement. If he is thwarted again in his dealings with 
the United States, Abu Ghazala will probably take a 
much more cautious approach to US-Egyptian 
defense cooperation. His resignation might lead to the 
appointment of a defense minister much less 
favorably inclined toward the United States.

Morocco-Israel: Continui7 
Contacts 
Morocco?with its well-established Jewish 
population?has in the past few years expanded 
significantly its unofficial ties to Israel. King Hassan 
sees these contacts as part of a larger effort to position 
his country as a bridge between the Arab states and 
the West. His meeting with then Israeli Prime 
Minister Peres in July 1986 was his most sensational 
attempt to insert himself into the Middle East peace 
process and at the same time to curry favor with and 
perhaps win assistance from the West. His failure to 
obtain significant new aid, particularly from the 
United States, disillusioned him, and this experience 
and the ephemeral results of the Peres meeting 
suggest Hassan will not seek another summit meeting 
with Israeli leaders in the near term. The King, 
however, will pursue informal contacts with Tel Aviv 
Background 
King Hassan's meeting in 1986 with Israeli Prime 
Minister Peres was the most recent and visible sign of 
continuing contacts between Rabat and Tel Aviv. The 
Alaouite dynasty is the protector of the 2,000-year-old 
Moroccan Jewish community?the largest in the 
Arab world and the King's principal vehicle for 
unofficial contacts with Israel. According to the US 
Consulate in Casablanca, the community numbers 
less than 10,000?down from nearly 350,000 in 1956. 
Nevertheless, Jews still play an important unofficial 
role as financiers, businessmen, technical and 
professional experts, and advisers to the King. 
Particularly noteworthy are the community's leader 
and palace insider David Amar, businessman and 
foreign policy adviser Serge Berdugo, and member of 
parliament?since 1985?Johanna Ohana. There are 
400,000 to 500,000 Jews of Moroccan origin in Israel, 
100,000 in France, and significant numbers in 
Canada and the United States, and these populations 
serve abroad as important interpreters and supporters 
of Moroccan foreign policy. 
53 
Hassan's Motives 
We believe that the King's policies toward Israel and 
the Moroccan Jewish community are driven by 
several goals. Although Hassan professes to follow a 
nonaligned foreign policy, he has adopted a pro-
Western stance and wants Morocco recognized in the 
West as a moderate alternative to fundamentalist and 
radical regimes. This longstanding incentive for 
maintaining unofficial ties to Israel became more 
important during the period of his union with Libya 
(1984-86). The King's consistent hope has been that 
the West would reward his constructive policy toward 
Tel Aviv with increased economic and military 
assistance, and that interest grew as he pursued more 
austere economic policies at home in recent years. 
The King also would also like to carve out a wider role 
for himself in the Middle East. He is convinced that 
his ties to Israel, his membership in the Arab League, 
the Islamic Conference Organization, and the 
Jerusalem Committee, and his detached perspective 
on the Middle East qualify him far better than 
Jordan's King Hussein?indeed, perhaps uniquely 
qualify him?as a mediator in the Arab-Israeli peace 
process. This was almost certainly why he risked 
Libyan and Syrian subversion and condemnation by 
the radical Arab states to talk with Peres. He is only 
the fourth Arab head of state to meet openly with an 
Israeli leader. The others?King Abdallah of Jordan, 
Egyptian President Sadat, and Lebanese President 
Bashir Gemayel?were assassinated.

Secret 
Informal contacts between Morocco and Israel will 
almost certainly continue, notwithstanding the chill 
that set in for several months after the King's meeting 
with Peres. Despite Hassan's disappointment over 
Israeli inflexibility and lack of followup and the 
failure of Washington to give greater assistance, he 
decided in March 1987 to reinvigorate the dialogue 
with Tel Aviv. As initial signs of the rekindled 
interest, he revived plans for a book to be published in 
French, English, Arabic, and Hebrew on his relations 
with and support for the Moroccan Jewish community 
and approved a series of bilateral visits. The factors 
that impelled Moroccan diplomacy in this direction in 
the past will probably keep Hassan on that course in 
the future. By the same token, however, the King is as 
mindful of the constraints on his Israeli policy as he 
was in the past, and we believe that the Rabat-Tel 
Aviv dialogue will stop well short of another 
publicized summit meeting in the near term.
