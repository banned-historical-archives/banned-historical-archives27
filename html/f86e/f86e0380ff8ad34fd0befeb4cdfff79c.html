 Soviets Decree Death Penalty for More Crimes:  Three offenses have just
 been added to -the cons aNt yry in`crea"sinngff Grimes punishable by death
 in the Soviet Union, according to new decrees published in the official
 bulletin of the Supreme Soviet and reported by the AP from Moscow on
 27 February 1962.  The additions include the crimes of bribe-taking, rape,
 and attacks on policemen.  Last spring the death penalty was extended to the
 crimes of theft of state property (embezzlement), forgery (of money or
 valuable documents), and terrorism in state prisons and work camps (e. g. 25X1 C1 Ob
 '.5X1 C 10b
 This increasing resort to capital punishment is
 a clear indictment by-fhe Soviets themselves of the Communist system in
 practice.  While rape is no respecter of ideological boundaries, bribery
 flourishes in a bureaucratic society, and attacks on police suggest that the
 Soviet public does not identify its interests with those of the regime.
 Communist theoreticians and practitioners have all held that environment
 (the "organization of production") is the determinant of behavior, that
 capitalist society in particular causes crime, and that Communist society
 would eliminate all of the conditions giving rise to crime.  But after 45
 years Soviet society has not only failed to create the New Soviet Man, but
 has produced dictators of the proletariat who increasingly resort to harsh
 penalties (harsher than those of any civilized country in the world) in an
 attempt to suppress the growing number of crimes in Soviet societ~,

 Establishment of a Latin !-American Institute in the Soviet Academy of
 Sciences.  In January        the Soviet Academy of Sciences announced
 the establishment of a Latin American Institute.  Headed by former
 Soviet Minister to Uruguay S. S. Mikhailov, the Institute will perform
 economic and political research and concentrate on developing specialists
 in Latin American affairs.   Mikhailov stated: "Our Institute has been set
 up to study problems of the modern economy and politics of Latin American
 countries.  It will also coordinate the research of.Soviet sxperts on
 Latin America. "
 In preparation for the major effort made by the Soviets to penetrate
 the African continent, the Soviet Academy of Sciences had announced the
 establishment in 1959, of an African Institute.  In the same manner,  it can
 be expected that the newly created Latin American Institute will provide
 basic support for Soviet policy makers and also for the entire Soviet propa-
 ganda effort in Latin America.

 Soviets Send Cuban Ships I-Tome Empty.  On 2 February, the AP reported
 that erar o  rrec eaBecqu,er, :die first officer of the Cuban ship Fundador,
 asked for political asylum in Me,:ico.  Becquer explained that he had made
 nine trips to the Soviet Union on vessels carrying sugar, food, fruits, hides
 and other items but in each case his ship returned to Cuba empty.  On the
 other hand he reported that Soviet ships carry arms to Cuba.  We wonder
 whether these practices illustrate the nature of the much vaunted trade
 agreements between the Cuban Communists and their Soviet masters.  Those
 familiar with international trade know the econorhic importance to a nation
 of full productive use of its own ships -- such use often determines the
 country's ability to meet its foreign currency obligations.  The Soviets take
 it that the Cubans have to offer, send arms in return, and force the Cubans
 into an unproductive and costly use of their ships.  The officer also said
 that the Fundador carried 80 tons of Communist propaganda printed in
 Argentina for eventual distribution in Cuba.  We note wryly that babies can-
 not eat pamphlets any more than arms and munitions.
 Chinese Flag to Fly over Cuban School.  Ceremonies presided over by
 mein ers of the Chinese Embassy were held in January 1962 to name a
 school in Havana after the People's republic of China, according to the
 Cuban official daily, Revolucion.  A flag of China was presented to the
 school; in return, a  u an  ag was given to the Chinese representatives
 which will eventually be raised in a Chinese school.  We note this fine
 example of cooperation between the-Cuban instructors in guerrilla warfare
 and the representatives of Mao Tse-tung's theories of armed revolution
 and wonder whether the children will grow up under the influence of Mao's
 interpretation of Marx rather than that of Xhrushchev.
 U.S. Makes Another Constructive Proposal to Eliminate Controversy Over
 Berlin Access you es.  in an in erview with   r.    z u ei on   November
 1961, President  ennedy suggested that an International Access Authority
 would provide a reasonable solution to the problem of access to Berlin.  The
 Secretary of State reiterated this proposal in a press conference on 2 March
 1962.  Such an authority, supplementing existing access arrangements
 between West Germany and Berlin, and based on objective, effective and
 legally binding rules governing the use of transportation and communications
 facilities under its control, would eliminate the danger of clashes between
 the countries .'irectly concerned.  The offer in this proposal is further
 evidence of the fact that the U.S. , far from "dragging its feet" on the Berlin
 problem, is offering fair and constructive solutions to pressing dangers of a
 collision between Soviet and Western armed forces over blocked access to
 Berlin.  This is the kind of solution which neutral and uncommitted nations
 should find palatable and to which they should be expected to give their full
 support. It is also a realistic proposal which Sovbloc personnel, who have
 initiated disruption and harassment in the access routes for political purposes
 in recent months, should find difficult to evade.  The foot-dragging attributed
 to the United States is in fact being done by the Soviet Union as far as just
 solutions are concerned.  Further evasion..,by the Soviet Union should make it
 evident to the rest of the world that Soviet intent is to run rough shod over all
 reasonable proposals and to gain complete control over Berlin by force and
 the threat of force.  Reaction to this proposal should reflect upon the Soviet
 meaning of "peaceful coexistence" and its attitude toward negotiated settlement
 of disputes.

 2 M.c TVQ US vival from a Nuclear Attack
 Background: One of the most important objectives of Soviet policy is
 to convince tae ,r ree World that nuclear war means certain death.  This is
 an essential part of the "peaceful coexistence" campaign simultaneously to
 frighten and cajole the rest of the world into accepting Soviet demands.  -
 Marshal Malinovsky has asserted (24 January 1962) that the USSR is cap-
 able of destroying whole countries with U.S. bases on their territories
 (L hru.shchev made several similar statements last year) and the Marshal
 has ridiculed (as has Ambassador Menshikov) U.S. shelter-building pro-
 grams on the grounds that shelters against atom and hydrogen bombs are
 nothing but coffins.  The Soviet aim, of course, is to ;show that ultimately
 there are only two alternatives: to be Red, or to be dead.
 Soviet statements about the uselessness of shelters are belied by
 Soviet civil defense measures.  For example, subway construction in
 Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev includes measures for converting the sub-
 ways to shelters, such as the provision of blast-proof doors.  Most Soviet
 civil defense activities are under the "Voluntary Society for the Promotion
 of the Army, Air Force, and Navy" (DOSAAF).  This organization, with
 22,000,000 members, also conducts paramilitary training, and has its own
 publishing facilities.  One booklet. far instructors in civil defense was
 issued in 1961 in 200,000 copies.  Another pamphlet,  "Be Ready for Anti-
 Aircraft Defense," is designed for children.  The organization also issued
 recently a 40 page album with pictures, drawings and charts.  One picture
 shows a Soviet family (evidently not an average family) preparing for a
 nuclear attack by filling the bathtub with water, turning on the radio,
 blacking out all lights, preparing emergency food supplies, and gathering
 in the living room,  On 7 October, the New York Times published
 Mme. Khrushchev's statement to the peace marchers Mat the USSR was
 making no civil defense preparations.  On the same day, the Times also
 printed illustrations from a Soviet civil defense booklet, showing four
 different types of shelter (ditch, individual, family, and community).
 /See Press Comment, 19 October 1961.  An article from a DOSAAF publi-
 cation is reproc7uced in Press Comment 2 March 1962.7 Evidently the
 Soviets do not really believe   at shelters are useless`.  They do, however,
 refrain from publicizing their civil defense effort, partly because they
 wish to delude the rest of the world, and partly because they fear a panic
 among the Soviet people.
 The best available guide in English to defense against nuclear attack
 is the United States Defense Department booklet Fallout Protection: What
 to-Know and Do about Nuclear Attack, copies of which are attached to this
 i-   ee z y guidance.  This booklet, while recognizing that nuclear conflict
 "would be terrible beyond imagination, " acids that "there is much that can
 be done to assure that it would not mean the end of the life of our nation. "
 The booklet points out that while no program can prevent large-scale loss of
 life, "an effective program of civil defense could save the lives of millions
 who would not otherwise survive. "

 This last is the most cogent argument for a shelter program.  But there
 is another argument which is politically very important, and which is not
 mentioned in the booklet: a domestic shelter program is an essential part of
 an effective deterrent.  If the Free World wants-the Soviets to believe that it
 is prepared if necessa-ry to fight a nuclear war -- in other words, if our
 deterrent is to deter -- it is important to show that we are taking measures-
 to ensure the survival of a part of our population.  If we simply armed with-
 out building shelters, the Kremlin could logically conclude either that we
 were bluffing, or that we were preparing to make 4 surprise first attack.
 Either conclusion could be disastrous.  The best way to prevent any actual
 nuclear attack is to maintain a position of calm preparedness, avoiding
 either hysterical threats or a misleading appearance of weakness.          25X1C1Ob

 494.  AFRICA: Aftermath of the Lagos Conference                              A I  I U O
 Background:  Twenty independent African states, all of them members
 of the moderate "Monrovia" group, met at a conference in Lagos, Nigeria,
 January 22-30 for consideration of some common problems.  The
 "Casablanca'' group of more hard-line powers (Ghana, Guinea, Mali,
 Morocco, and the UAR) did not attend, ostensibly because representatives
 of the Provisional Government of Algeria had not been invited.  Tunisia,
 Libya (both members of the "Monrovia" group) and Sudan, all of which
 countries had been invited, did not participate for the same reason. The
 Conference began in a dispirited and divisive atmosphere, largely due to
 differences over whether or not the Provisional Government of Algeria
 should have been invited.  The feeling of frustration and disillusionment
 among those at Lagos because of the absent "Casablanca" and other powers
 was greatly reduced as the Conference proceeded, apparently for two
 principal reasons: first, a realization that, although reconciliation was
 not immediately possible, the remaining moderate group of independent
 states could affirm their determination to move ahead while leaving the
 door open for eventual rapprochement; second, the dramatic arrival on
 the scene at Lagos of the Congolese Premier Adoula had a galvanizing
 effect on the Conference.  Following his outline of the situation in the
 Congo, the Conference unanimously authorized dispatch of a message
 to the UN Security Council requesting it to refrain, in view of the "present
 welcome and encouraging development," from any action which might
 jeopardize the good prospects for a solution of the Congo problem. Governor-
 General Azikiwe of Nigeria, while expressing belief in the good intentions
 of the "Casablanca" powers, said it was imperative that all African states
 declare publicly their adherence to the policy of non-intervention in one
 another's affairs and of scrupulous respect for the right of all African
 states, large or small, to live at peace with one another.  Among the
 Conference's other decisions were the following: to set up a permanent
 political Secretariat in an effort to draw in other African states, to
 establish a number of other specific organizations, e. g. scientific,
 economic; and to put on record the Conference's views on issues such as
 being in favor of self-determination for Angola.  The Conference directed
 the foreign ministers of governments attending to meet within three months
 to study terms of a proposed Organization of African States.  The proposal
 for this organization is to be ratified at a Chiefs of State meeting now
 scheduled for this spring.  Another meeting is expected to be held at Tunis
 in April to be attended, it is hoped, by representatives of all groupings.
 The states attending the Lagos meeting have apparently not quite decided  25X1 C10b
 whether or not they will attend the meeting at Tunis.

 495.  Lessons From the 5th Moscow WFTU Congress
 25X1C10b
 Background: The Fifth World Trade Union (WFTU) Congress convened in
 Mosco`w' December 4-15, 1961, centering on affirming CPSU policy adopted at
 the 22nd Congress of the CPSU and on cooperation with non-Communist trade
 unions.  Secretary General Louis Saillant set the general theme of the meeting
 in his opening address as the "struggle for peace, co-existence, disarmament,
 and anti-colonialism. " In general, the proceedings followed anticipated lines-,
 with one important exception.  The leader of the Italian Delegation and Chair-
 man of WFTU, Augustino Novella (Secretary General of the CGIL in Italy)
 proposed 28 amendments to the WFTU program, causing a sharp fight in the
 convention in which the Italian proposals were finally defeated and Novella
 failed of re-election as Chairman. . The Italian position, clearly in opposition
 to CPSU doctrine, and the program of WFTU as finally adopted, can best be
 summarized by a quotation from Corriere Della Sera, a Milan paper, published
 December 3, 1961, on the eve of The Congress:
 "This document (an official position paper of the Executive
 Council of the CGIL) also reflects the peculiar position of the CGIL,
 within which the communists must perforce take the presence of the
 socialists into account, not to mention the danger of isolation and
 pressure from other union groups.  But it reflects only fleetingly
 the conflicts and the contrasting viewpoints within the organization,
 all of which have been heightened since Khrushchev's latest ful-
 minations.  It came out in the Avanti! conflict that the Federation
 document (The WFTU draft program was altogether inadequate:
 it put too much stress en the opposition between the two blocs; it
 confounded the politico-military blocs with socio-economic systems;
 it scorned the idea of individual negotiations in the several countries
 and failed to recognize the independence of the trade unions; and
 assigned the unions in capitalist countries to a position inferior to
 those in the socialist countries. "
 In contrast to this rift, and somewhat to the surprise of most observers,
 no differences between the Soviets and the Chinese were surfaced at the
 Congress.                                                         25X1 C1 Ob

 ietnazxy.                                      25X1 Cl Ob
 Background:
 1.  General:  A: Communist China Foreign Ministry statement
 of 24        ry 1962 declared that the establishment of a U. S.
 Military Assistance Command in Vietnam is in effect a now stage
 in an undeclared war which seriously effects the security of China.
 The Peking statement, which concluded with a demand for immedi-
 ate consultations among the countries concerned, followed closely
 on the heels of an official note from North Vietnam's foreign
 ministry to the c.cchairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference (USSR
 and Britain) calling for "urgent measures to halt U.S. armed
 aggression in South Vietnam. " The Soviet Union, which has
 given little more than perfunctory propaganda support to earlier
 Hanoi appeals on this issue, warned in Pravda 27 February that
 U. S. military action against Communist g"`uerrillas in South Vietnam
 involved a possibility of "alarming consequences" for world peace
 and declared North Vietnam's appeal for international support
 against U.S. aggression would be heard.
 2.  Communist China Attempts to Generate International Fears.
 Peking's Foreign Ministry statement of     e ruary, as broad-
 cast the same date by Radio Peking, is designed to generate
 international fears that U. S. policy in South Vietnam may broaden
 the area of conflict.  The statement reviews the scope of U.S.
 military assistance to South Vietnam, and terms the U.S.

 U. S. imperialists for direct participation in the direction of

 statement that its military men will shoot if shot at, Peking
 observes "this shows in fact that the U.S. is already in an
 undeclared war in southern Vietnam." The statement concludes
 with the following allegations with regard to the security of China.

 24~ C~dgnrnunist Reaction to Glenn Flight
 Back.,rou.nd: The non-Communist press throughout the world paid
 abundant tribute to the courage and skill of Lt. Col. Glenn, and to American
 space technology,  Naturally, most free world commentators also mentioned
 the orbital flights of Yuri Gagarin and German Titov, but in doing so, they
 usually noted that the American flight took place openly, before the eyes of
 the world.  Neutralist comment sometimes expressed concern--that Soviet-
 American competition might be intensified, but many others -- including
 some neutral media, such as the Stockholm Tidningen -- saw in the American
 success a welcome restoration of the world balance   power in this special
 field.  Throughout the non-Communist world, there was satisfaction over
 the successful flight and the resulting improvement in American prestige.
 The Soviets did not--indeed, could not--repeat the derisory comment
 they had made on the Shepard. and Grissom flights.  Titov did not repeat
 his statement, made at the 22nd CPSU Congress:
 "We learned the names of the American cosmonauts and
 got some information about them.  What are the ideals of these
 people ?.  What brought them to the cabin of the cosmic rocket?
 The American press reported on them as persons whose actions
 are motivated by one aim--money.  Business, to get their
 cosmic fee, to buy a house, a shop, to se-t up their business, to
 become well-to-do bourgeois exploiters--this is the ideal of
 American cosmonauts which brought them to the launching pad
 of the rocket site. It
 But for the Bloc press (except Tirana and Peiping who largely ignored
 his feat) the Glenn flight was an occasion for various forms of propaganda
 gamesmanship, some fairly subtle, others much less so,as follows:
 1.  Transparent Generosity.  There was an effort to present
 an appearance of objectivity an  airness, as by broadcasting full
 factual details and a recording of Glenn's voice.  There was also
 TV coverage, them gh not "live." The Soviets usually refrained
 from direct, self-attributed comparison between Soviet and U.S.
 space achievements.  And congratulatory messages for Glenn from
 Gagarin,  Titov, President of the Soviet Academy of Science
 Keldysh, and astronomer Alla Masevich were highly publicized,
 especially to domestic audiences.  Broadcasts to North America
 quoted a number of generous statements from leading Soviet
 scientists; these generally placed more emphasis on the advanced
 state of American technology than was given in broadcasts for
 domestic audiences.  These and other broadcasts to America and
 Europe also stressed heavily the idea that international cooperation
 in space was desirable.

 2.  Buried Criticism.  Soviet broadcasts, which for weeks
 had been ass iduousry-'rz    in ; the postponements in the flight, now
 emphasized the difficulties in the automatic orientation system and
 temperature control, etc.    There was, particularly just before the
 flight, much shedding of crocodile tears over the plight of poor
 Glenn, with one 17 February broadcast reporting that American
 scientists were expecting and reco-mmending that Glenn be replaced
 by someone else, and that Grissom was rumored to have asked to
 be relieved of his duties under Project Mercury.  The Bloc press
 was filled with suggestions that Glenn's life was being gambled with,
 for the sake of a political prestige victory.  One of the messages
 from Soviet scientists broadcast to North America (that of Prof.
 Vladimir Dobronravov), while generally laudatory, contained two
 subtle jabs: Dobronravov suggested that the lesser weight of   --
 Glenn's spaceship was explained by its use of lighter, more dura-
 ble materials (thu.s calling attention to the difference between the
 weights lifted by the USSR and the U.S. rockets), and that it was
 scientifically important to know that "a man of 40 also felt well in
 the state of weightlessness," showing that "any person properly
 trained for space flights can endure this state. "
 3.  Take-off for Self-Praise.  Reports on Glenn's flight
 were often used as pegs for extended discussion of Soviet space
 achievements and plans.  A characteristic Pravda dispatch
 welcomed the "great and joyous event" and then went on to
 deprecate it by recalling the many postponements, discoursing
 at length on the difficulties encountered, and stating that "many"
 Americans "wondered whether the 10-time postponement had
 not affected the cosmonaut's moral fiber and well-being. "
 After quoting an official at Cape Canaveral as saying that the
 flight "could have ended in disaster, " Pravdats correspondent
 devoted the remainder of his article to recce  ng the feats of
 "trail blazers" Gagarin and Titov.
 4.  Silence on Main U.S. Distinction.    Moscow made no
 reference to the open c arac ero    a final launching.  (On
 27 January, -however, in reporting one of the postponements,
 Moscow had--perhaps inadvertently- -reported that "hundreds
 of lenses of motion picture and TV cameras, and representa-
 tives of the press, radio, and television of 16 countries were
 assembled" to witness a launching which did not take place.
 If this was not inadvertence, the aim was probably to show the
 U.S. as suffering a prestige defeat in front of the whole world. )
 5.  Grabbing the Spotlight.  Khrushchev, as an American
 TV commentator put it, , "got into the act" by expressing hopes,
 in his congratulatory message, for joint efforts in mastering
 space.  Tass failed to report the portion of President'Kennedy's
 reply which pointed out that Kennedy had made precise proposals
 early in 1961.  Khrushchev had previously replied to American
 suggestions of cooperation by saying that disarmament would

 have to come first; this condition was now omitted, although the
 most widely broadcast Moscow Radio comment on the Glenn flight
 tried to link Khrushchev's proposal with the claim that the USSR
 stands for disarmament.
 6.  Indirect Self-Praise. Foreign press comment was
 frequently quote  out of context to show that the world still re
 gards the U. S. as being behind the USSR in space.
 President Kennedy has now forwarded to Khrushchev (7 March) specific
 concrete suggestions for cooperation in operating a weather satellite system,
 reciprocal tracking services, satellites for mapping the earth's magnetic
 field, and intercontinental communication satellites, as well as for pooling
 efforts and knowledge in the field of space medicine.  Aside from these
 possible areas of joint activity (in some of which Soviet achievements so far
 have been negligible), President Kennedy invited other proposals from the
 USSR, and suggested that other nations too could contribute.  (Information

 498,  CPSU STATISTICS: Si nificant Data on Member shiZ_and_Zart
 Backround:  Partiiinna rya Zhizn, ("Party Life"), a publication of the
 Central Committee of thQPSSU,, carried in its January 1962 issue #1 an
 article "The Party in Figures" (for complete translation, see PRESS
 COMMENT, 6 March 1962, p. 15).  This article contains numerous
 statistics about party membership. and structure, enabling us to draw
 certain significant conclusions -- despite the fact that the statistics are
 obviously incomplete (they omit the number of party members or basic
 party units in the Armed Services, they do not specify how many members
 the party lost by death or resignation, they do not break down me mbership
 by age, etc.) and that the meaning of the figures is often inadequately or
 ambiguously defined.  Does "membership," for instance, denote all persons
 admitted once to the party and not yet struck from its rolls, or only persons
 paying their dues, or actively participating in the work of their basic party
 units ?
 Over-all Figures. Partiina a Zhizn (PZ) states that total CPSU
 membership --  u " members and candidates -- rose from 7.2 million
 on 1 January 1956 to. 9. 7 million on 1 October 1961, i.e., an increase of
 2. 5 million (2.1 million full members and 400 thousand candidate members)
 (or 34.7%) in less than 6 years (the article gives detailed figures down to
 the last digit, but we use only round figures here).  It specifies that
 3 million persons were accepted as candidates and 2. 5 million as members,
 totalling at least 3.4 million -- i.e., all candidates accepted since. 1956,
 plus the 400, 000 candidates who were on the party rolls on 1 January 1956
 and who must be presumed to have become "full" members since.  This
 figure is higher by 900, 000 than the reported total increase of 2. 5 million
 members (both "full" and candidate members).  Later, PZ reports that
 "more than 200, 000 persons have been expelled from the party for various
 reasons, " a figure identified as being merely two fifths of those who were
 expelled from or "dropped out of" the party in the five years (1950-1955)
 preceding the 20th CPSU Congress.  A subsequent tabulation in the article
 refers to those "expelled or automatically dropped from the party, " again
 adding up to somewhat over 200, 000.  This leaves at least 700, 000 persons
 unaccounted for -- who may have either died or left the party on their own
 initiative.
 Nationalities. PZ states that 6.1 million among the total of 9. 6 million
 members and, candidates as of 1 July, 1961 -- that is 63.6% or almost
 two thirds -- were Russians by nationality: according to the 15 January, .
 1959, census, 114.1 out of a total population of 208 million -- that is, 54. 8%
 were ethnic Russians.  This prevalence of Russians in party membership
 is even more pronounced in several of the smaller constituent republics.
 In the Kazakh SSR, for instance, there are 366, 000 party members, but
 only 149, 000 are Kazakhs by nationality: in other words, even if we assume
 that all CPSU members of Kazakh nationality live in the Kazakh SSR, they
 are only a minority in the ruling party organization of their "own" territory.

 Or, in the Latvian SSR, 76, 000 party members are reported, but only
 33, 900 of Latvian nationality (the latter figure represents 0.35% of the
 total party membership, while Latvians, according to the 1959 census,
 are 0. 6% of the population of the USSR).
 Length of Parma Membership. 3.4 million persons were admitted
 to the party since 1 January 195b so that 35% of the total have joined
 in these last 6 years.  PZ notes merely that 2.4 million (24. 3%) of
 the total on l October 1961 were members of less than 3 years' standing
 or still candidates.  In another context, however, the article notes
 that in 1961 40% of the members had 10 years of membership or less,
 52% had 11 - 25 years and 8% had over 25 years.
 Social Composition.  PZ stresses proudly the increase in manual
 workers, farm hands and technical specialists among party members,
 contrasted against a reduction in bureaucrats and other "non-proletarian"
 elements.  This effort is understandable sinc every Communist Party
 is supposed to represent the "workers and peasants," and, when in
 power, the "dictatorship of the proletariat" -- but the statistics offered
 in support of this claim are even more questionable than others.  The
 article itself admits that "social status is determined by the chief
 occupation at the time of entry into the part  " Since that day -- which
 in the case of more than half of all party members lies more than 10
 years back --, many of the one-time "workers and peasants" have
 undoubtedly been promoted to full-time paid positions in the party and
 its mass organizations, in the government, the armed services, etc.
 and have long shed their "proletarian" past.   Moreover, PZ defines
 categories in exceedingly vague terms: one of the tabulations, for
 instance, classes all members who are not workers or peasants as
 "employees and all others" (48% of the total membership in 1961) and
 breaks this further down into such "catch-all" sub-divisions as "heads
 of organizations, institutions, enterprises, construction projects, state
 farms and Repair and Technical Stations and their sub-divisions" (10.2%
 of all "employees" in 1961).  The figures of agricultural "workers"
 recruited show a much more rapid increase in trained specialists (800%)
 as compared with field, truck and orchard workers (60%).  PZ hides
 members in the Armed Forces -- and possibly other categories -- by
 various tricks: for instance, by limiting, at one place, percentage
 figures to "Communists in territorial Party organizations," without
 giving any absolute figures. Despite all these misleading maneuvers,
 the article finally admits that no less than 10.8% of. all members (almost
 one million) are employed (more correctly: were already employed on
 the day they joined the party) in the "Apparatus of state and economic
 agencies and Party and public organizations. " "Public organizations,
 in this context, denotes Communist fronts.  Needless to say, hundreds
 of thousands of additional party members, though on the payroll of
 industrial enterprises, state or collective farms or engaged in other
 Y roductive" work, are primarily working in the interest, and under
 the orders, of the party.
 Educational Level.  1. 3 million members, or 13. 3% of the total
 as of  July, 1961, are reported to have higher (college or university)
 education -- against 11.2% 5 years earlier.  2. 8 million or 29.6% of
 all members (1956: 25. 8%) had "incomplete higher and secondary
 education, " Of the latter, 1. 8 millic n. or 18. 6% (1956: 16.8%) had

 "specialized" (presumably: technical, industrial or agricultural)
 education.  Another 2.7 million, that is, 28.6% (1956: 29.6%) had
 "partial secondary" education.
 Age and Sex Distribution.  PZ does not offer age statistics, but
 notes that in 092 4976 ,of Me members "had been raised under Soviet
 rule" (which presumably means: born since 1917 -- that is, they
 were, in 1952, 35 years old or less).  In 1956, this figure had increased
 to 53%p and in 1961, before the 22nd CPSU Congress, to 67% (i.e.,
 presumably 44 years old or less).  The party's strong accent on youth
 is also shown by the fact that 1. 6 million who were admitted as candidate
 members between 1956 and 1961 (52% of the total) had been members of
 the Young Communist League (KOMSOMOL).  No other data about front
 `)rganizations or about the channels through which the other 48% of new
 candidates came to the party are given.  1, 9 million party members in
 l`'1 (19. 8% of the total) were women, as against 1.4 million (19. 7%) in
 1956.
 Part  Apparat.  As usual in Communist Party reports, the article
 does not reveal the number of paid party officials: in the occupational
 figures, quoted above, the number of party employees is hidden among
 figures of government and front organizations' employees.  Nevertheless,
 PZ's data indicate the vast scope and the huge manpower resources of
 the CPSU's apparat: it states that "more than 1, 800, 000 Communists
 have been elected to party committees and the bureaus of primary party
 organizations and as secretaries, assistant secretaries and party group
 organizers." It also relates that the party had, as of 1 October 1961,
 157 Province, territory and Union-Republic Central Committees
 10 National region committees
 602 City committees
 343 Borough committees
 3,202 District committees.
 In 1961, more than 306, 000 members were elected to these committees.
 This "superstructure" supervises no less than 296,444 primary party
 organizations, including
 75, 681 at Industrial, transportation etc. enterprises
 41, 387 at Collective farms
 9,Z06 at State farms
 52, 501 at "Institutions, organizations and economic agencies"
 56, 968 at Educational, scientific, cultural and medical institutions
 12, 594 at Trade and public catering enterprises.
 (Note that the above breakdown adds up only to 248, 337, leaving more
 than 48, 000 of the total 2 96, 444 primary organizations unaccounted
 for -- to be found presumably in the Armed Forces.) In some categories,
 the number of party units has been reduced -- for instance, at collective
 farms because of the continuing merger of farms --, but this undoubtedly
 indicates a streamlining rather than a curtailing of the party machine.
 What is not specified in the official figures is the increased importance
 of the apparatchiks in the Party.  Previously, a good proportion of top
 echelon members in the Party had fairly wide experience in government,

 economics, and other professional fields -- e. g. the expelled anti-Party
 group.  It now appears, from the occupational histories of a cross section
 of Party members, that more and more professional party men (i. ee those
 who have spent their lives running the Party organization itself) are
 assuming importance in the Party.  All of the new presidium and secretariat
 members - G.I. Voronov, V. V. Shcherbitsky, S.R. Rashidov, P.N. Demicliwr,
 L. F. Ilichev, B.N. Ponomarev, A. N. Shelepin, and I. V. Spiridonov - are
 all party professionals.                                                     25X1C10b
