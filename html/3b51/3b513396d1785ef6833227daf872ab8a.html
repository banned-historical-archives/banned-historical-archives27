 Soviet Strategic Nuclear Capabilities
 1.   The Soviets have already achieved strategic nuclear capabilities widely
 perceived to be at least equal to those of the United States.  During the
 past year they further improved the striking power of their offensive forces
 and made progress in overcoming some of the weaknesses in their strategic
 defenses.  Moreover, they have development and deployment programs underway
 to further improve their capability to fight a general nuclear war, including
 a protracted conflict, and to increase their prospects of emerging the victor
 over any combination of adversaries.  To this end they are seeking strategic
 forces and supporting systems that would enable them, along with other forces,
 to neutralize US offensive systems, survive a US nuclear attack, limit damage
 to the USSR and permit attainment of Soviet military objectives,in Eurasia.
 2.   Trends of the recent past show improved Soviet capabilities to carry out some
 of these missions.  For example, their present command and control systems,
 their offensive forces and their civil defenses--would probably be adequate
 to conduct global nuclear conflict according to Soviet strategy.  However,
 their current strategic defenses would probably be unable significantly to
 limit damage to the USSR from a large scale US nuclear attack.  We have
 major uncertainties about the potential of the USSR's future forces to conduct
 the missions envisioned by Soviet strategy.  Modernization of US strategic
 forces as now proposed will increase the Soviets' uncertainties about being
 able to perform some strategic missions.  There is a continuing threat,
 however, that the Soviets' massive research efforts in advanced technologies,
 particularly in directed energy and space technologies, coud result in a
 breakthrough that would give them a major strategic advantage over the United

 Soviet Ballistic Missile Defense
 3.  For example, there has been no slackening in Soviet efforts of the past
 20 years to acquire ballistic missile defenses based on conventional and
 advanced technologies.
 --The Soviets are improving the defenses at Moscow, they are
 contructing new large radars and they are conducting ABM system
 development that will give them options to deploy more widespread
 missile defenses in the 1980s.
 --They are working on a ground based laser weapon and are con-
 ducting research on a spaced based laser that could be applied to
 ballistic missile defense in the 1990s.
 Widespread deployment by the Soviets of a conventional or an advanced ballistic
 missile defense, even if it might potentially be overcome by an attacking
 force, could create serious uncertainties about the credibility of the US
 nuclear deterrent.
 Soviet Space Program
 4.   The magnitude of the Soviets space research and development programs
 and the vast array of space systems they have deployed, give ominous indications
 of future Soviet military applications in space.  In addition to the use of
 space for communications and intelligence collection, the Soviets have the -
 potential in the 1980s and 1990s to develop and deploy

 --Antisatellite systems with improved capabilities to destroy
 or interfere with US satellites including those at high altitude.
 --Permanent, manned, military space stations.
 --Systems for real time or near real time surveillance of land,
 sea and air.mobile weapon platforms.
 --Weapon systems that incorporate potential advances in directed
 energy technologies.
 The trend in the 1980s will be toward increased dependence by both the
 US and USSR on space systems to perform military functions in peacetime,
 crisis and conflict that cannot be performed by non-space systems.  We
 therefore expect the Soviets to seek the means to dominate
 space during a conflict in order to achieve their military and political
 objectives.

 The Warsaw Pact
 The Pact has historically outnumbered NATO, but force improvements
 over the past few years have widened the numerical disparity and have
 eroded NATO's long-standing qualitative lead as well.  Most of the
 recent improvements have been to Soviet forces, however, and Moscow's
 East European allies--about half of the initially available Pact forces--
 are falling behind in the qualitative race.  Although the East Europeans
 receive token quantities of new Soviet equipment, much of their forces
 are approaching obsolescence.
 The Soviet Union would depend heavily on its Warsaw Pact allies
 at least in the early stages of a war with NATO, and military considerations
 had much to do with its demands for the imposition of martial law in
 Poland.  Poland provides substantial combat forces to the Pact and
 controls critical lines of communications between Moscow's forward based
 forces and their primary reinforcement base.  The Soviets are likely to
 be more reluctant than ever to initiate any actions which could lead to
 a military encounter with NATO until their interests in Poland are
 fully secured.

 Soviet Power Projection
 The Soviets have dontinued to improve their forces for power projection
 over the past year.  Nevertheless, their ability to project military power
 beyond their borders still varies sharply with the distance to the objective.
 For operations in contiguous areas where they can make maximum use of
 their ground force strength, such as southwest Asia, the Soviets have
 considerable military potential.  In the military districts opposite Iran,
 for example, they maintain 23 divisions.  They have made some limited
 improvements to units there over the past year as part of forces-wide
 modernization efforts, but most of these divisions remain at reduced
 readiness levels.  We know that the S,.viets have exercise scenarios
 calling for the introduction of large Soviet forces into Iran and
 estimate that within a month or so they could prepare a force of 10-20
 divisions for operations there.  We, therefore, monitor this area
 closely even though Soviet military action against Iran seems unlikely
 at present.
 The Soviets have the world's largest -airborne and airmobile forces,
 but Moscow's capability to project and support those forces beyond contiguous
 areas is limited by geographic factors and shortcomings in their military
 air transport.  The Soviets could airlift an airborne division to the
 Middle East in a few days, or sealift a motorized rifle division to the
 region in about two weeks.  Operations in the Middle East, however, would
 be beyond the range of USSR-based tactical airpower.  Unless tactical air
 units were based in or near the intended operational area, the Soviets
 could conduct military operations only against light opposition.

 INSTABILITY, SUBVERSION, AND INSURGENCY
 1.  Instability and regional tensions in the Third World will almost
 certainly continue to grow.  Even though their principal sources will remain
 local, these instabilities and tensions will continue to be exacerbated by the
 USSR, its friends and allies, and other outsiders.  Such external interference
 will thus in many instances continue to translate local questions to the
 superpower level and so create problems of much higher significance for the US
 than would otherwise be the case.  At my direction the Intelligence Community
 has taken specific steps to analyze better the sources of instability and
 regional tensions 'in the Third World, the ability of governments there to
 contain or reduce such crises, and especially the strength and aims of outside
 forces attempting to exploit such situations.  These will continue to be most
 difficult tasks for US intelligence, because of the (1) continuing high
 priority which we must accord many other questions of national security, and
 (2) the inherent problems which exist in assessing the intentions of the
 world's many political actors, particularly where they exist in highly
 emotional settings.  The entire Intelligence Community needs in particular to
 match its improved analytic capabilities with much improved collection
 efforts: on the part, alike, of Embassies, CIA stations, the US military, and
 NSA.  Even with such improvements in collection and analysis, many of the_
 coups, mass uprisings, assassinations of leaders, and the like in the
 underdeveloped world will continue often to be triggered by seemingly minor
 events, and we should expect that certain crises will continue to erupt
 without warning.

 2.  Two particular manifestations of such instabilities, revolutionary
 subversion and insurgency, will continue to be among the most difficult
 problems facing US intelligence, US interests, and US policy -- especially
 because such revolutionary action is supported by the USSR and its friends.
 In most instances subversion and insurrections feed upon quite understandable
 grievances against local injustice and the like, and many of them would exist
 even if the USSR did not.  But Soviet involvement enormously aggravates and
 complicates these questions.  Since 1917 the Soviets have promoted world-wide
 subversion and have supported insurgencies in the underdeveloped world, both
 types of endeavors seeking to undermine the Western positions there.  In more
 recent years Soviet capabilities in these respects have grown, for several
 major reasons:  (1) the Soviet touch has itself become more sophisticated; (2)
 the Soviets have developed a vast system of assisting subversives and
 revolutionaries -- in some instances directly, in others indirectly through
 various surrogates and third parties; (3) Cuba, in particular, has become a
 second source of support for subversive and insurrectionary activities in
 Latin America and Africa; and (4) the Soviets have done more to focus many of
 their support efforts on areas where the US or Western positions are most
 vulnerable.  For such reasons as these the USSR and its friends have become
 the principal source of external support, for example, to subversion and
 insurgency in El Salvador, to the strengthening of the Sandinista regime in
 Nicaragua, and to SWAPO in Namibia.  To such ends Third world subversives and
 insurgents are trained by the USSR, Cuba, South Yemen, various Palestinian
 entities, and Eastern European governments; and these patrons also provide
 large quantities of arms and considerable expert advice to them.

 3.  For the United States, these problems of subversion and revolutionary
 insurgency lie near the heart of a general contradiction facing US policy in
 much of the Third World: how best to defend US interests and support peaceful
 change where the choices are sometimes between friendly but ineffective
 regimes on the one hand and, on the other hand, parties that might come to
 dominate tomorrow's scene but are often hostile to US interests and beholden
 to Soviet or Soviet proxy support.  I can assure you that I am training
 increasing US intelligence attention on these questions.  But this is a tough
 job indeed for all of us: subversive and revolutionary insurrections in the
 Third World are products of our historical times, they will continue to plague
 the US, and they will continue to demand more resource support and the finest
 skilled response on the part of all of us.

 MEMORANDUM FOR:   Vice Chairman, NIC
 FROM           :  NIO/LA
 SUBJECT        :  DCI Worldwide Briefing -- Two Paragraphs on Central America
 25X1
 1.  Compared with one year ago, the extreme left in Central America is
 stronger while terrorism and guerrilla warfare have had a major role in under-
 mining all the economies of the region.  At the same time, the threatened
 governments and their supporting coalitions have maintained workable cohesion
 in the face of the growing pressures both because of their expectation that
 the new US administration would help prevent communist success and because of
 internal political developments and opportunities such as the return to con-
 stitutional government in Honduras, the scheduling of elections for El Salvador
 (March 1982), Guatemala (March 1982), and Costa Rica (February 1982)       25X1
 2.  In Nicaragua,the Marxist-Leninist Directorate with Cuban, other Soviet
 Bloc and radical Arab help has virtually consolidated its control, con-
 tinued the military buildup beginning in 1980, and provided extensive support
 to the guerrillas in the region.  In El Salvador the guerrillas maintain great
 pressure while the government is stretched almost to the limit simply to contain
 them--a lowering of international support for the government could lead to severe
 demoralization and perhaps defeat.  Since mid-December 1981, guerrilla violence
 has increased in El Salvador and Guatemala,. and this is likely to continue in
 an effort to disrupt the March elections in both countries.  CIA recently
 doubled the estimated guerrilla strength in Guatemala from about 2,500 to 4,000 to.
 5,000 compared with about 600 in 1978.  Cuba is also taking specific steps to
 encourage increased political violence in the democratic countries of Honduras,
 Costa Rica, Colombia, and Venezuela.

 problems endemic to the vast majority of the African countries, economic
 scarcity and political instability.  Food shortages and the crushing burden
 of energy costs weaken the economies of every country except South Africa.
 Together they preclude the raising of living standards which in turn leads
 to political unrest.  The extreme fragility of national political institutions
 facilitates the overthrow of representative government where it has begun to
 take root and paves the way for its replacement with authoritarian leadership.
 The recent coup in Ghana (the latest of a series of coups since independence)
 is only one of many illustrative examples.  Even such a relatively secure
 regime as Nigeria is not immune to the virus of military takeover.
 2.  This combination of economic and political weakness continues to
 provide ideal opportunities for Soviet intervention everywhere on the continent.
 The Soviets have never been able or willing to meet African needs for development
 aid; instead they have substituted supplies of arms to bolster client regimes
 and to encourage internal subversion by guerrilla movements.  By the end of
 1981 a total of almost 12,000 Soviet military and technical advisers were
 stationed in 30 African countries.  Their efforts were supplemented by over
 40,000 Cuban troops and advisers and by Libyan funds used for subversion.
 3.  In areas critical to US interests such as Southern Africa, Angola
 and the Horn we can look forward in 1982 to greater Soviet aid to insurgent
 groups, and to intensified diplomatic activity designed -to destabilize pro-
 Western regimes and frustrate American initiatives.  Such economic and
 technical aid as the Soviets are disposed to provide will come largely from
 Eastern European sources.

 International Terrorism
 1.  Recent events like the kidnapping of General Dozier in Italy and the
 attack on General Kroesen in West Germany highlight the fact that Americans
 and American interests are the favorite targets of international terrorists.
 Since anti-US terrorism has been increasing, I have authorized increased
 Community focus on the problem during the past year.  And even though this is
 now a priority issue in the Community, we do not yet have sufficient means to
 anticipate specific terrorist acts against Americans.  We know that the threat
 to Americans is compounded by the numerous links which exist among some
 terrorists, and by the assertive reactions various Third World leaders and
 entities have taken to certain US initiatives in several regions of the
 world.  Libya, the Red Army. Faction in Germany, the Italian Red Brigades,
 radical Palestinians, and others are strongly anti-American, have no scruples
 about using terrorism, and are capable of striking US targets abroad.  What is
 even more alarming is that the potential for such terrorism within the United
 States has become greater, and combatting it will require considerably
 enhanced cooperation among US intelligence and security agencies at home and
 abroad.
 2.  Even though international terrorism springs from disparate conditions
 and causes, many of them indigenous and without direct connection to things
 Soviet, the USSR nonetheless bears significant responsibility for some of the
 anti-US terrorism.  -The USSR supports both governments (including those of
 Libya, Cuba, South Yemen, and the East European states) and groups which, in
 turn, support or conduct terrorism.  The Soviets' support for terrorist

 training (particularly-in the Middle East), their provision of weapons, their
 anti-American propaganda campaigns, and their efforts to foster cooperation
 between terrorist groups all provide a backdrop which in some cases favors
 anti-American terrorism.  We are therefore, undertaking various new
 initiatives--in collection, liaison activities, collation, and analysis--aimed
 at drawing a more accurate picture of the relationships between the Soviets
 and their clients on the one hand and terrorist groups on the other.

 weaken the US position in the region.  t-le will continue to devote considerable
 analytical talent to evaluation of the implications of all those potential
 developments and to any changes in the nature and-extent of the Soviet
 military occupation of Afghanistan.
 Despite the presence of 85,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan the insurgents
 had considerable success-in 1981.  By the government's own figures, it
 controlled only 23 percent of the country at the end of the year.  Insurgent
 attacks on road convoys were effective enough to destroy or damage at least
 1000 Soviet armored vehicles, including 450 tanks.  The Afghan Army remained
 ineffective, with little prospect that it can be rebuilt this year.  The
 Babrak government's political efforts to win popular support have accomplished
 nothing.
 In the fall of 1981, the Soviets apparently reassessed and adjusted their
 Afghan policy.  One decision was to send in 5,000 to 10,000 more men--mostly
 KGB border troops.  An augumentation of this size will do little to change the
 situation, and later this year the Soviets probably will send in additional
 troops to protect supply lines and important towns.  Increased Soviet-
 sponsored pressure on Pakistan--cross border raids, subversion, and threats--
 to discourage foreign support for the insurgents is also likely.  We have no
 indications that the Soviets plan to commit enough additional troops--at least
 a few hundred thousand--to win the war quickly, but such an option might
 prove attractive, especially if the military situation remains intractable.

 The Chinese leadership continues to plan for its own succession.
 Although the aging Deng Xiaoping remains preeminent, his economic development
 policies favoring agricultural and light industry have produced only modest
 results.  Moreover, Deng and his allies must still restore institutions
 damaged during the Mao era and build support for a reform program that
 minimizes the role of ideology.  Some military leaders and many middle-level
 bureaucrats have reservations about some of Deng's policies.  If a smooth
 succession to Deng is implemented, Soviet capabilities to expand their
 influence at China's expense will be minimized; a failed succession, on the
 other hand, would present the Soviets with tempting opportunities.  China-US
 relations remain heavily influenced by Taiwan.  As a result, mutually acceptable
 management of the Taiwan arms sale issue tops the Chinese-US agenda for 1982.
 The military stalemate in Kmapuchea has led to increased political
 maneuvering among Communist and non-Communist resistances forces and their
 supporters outside Kampuchea.  Although the military balance still favors
 Vietnam (180,000) and their Kampuchean puppets (15-20,000), they are unable
 to consolidate control.  Singapore and Thailand are pressing for a loose
 coalition of Communist and non-Communist resistance forces with the objective
 of forcing Hanoi to seek a political solution.  Both the Soviets and the
 Chinese also have equities in Vietnam and Indochina.  The Soviets keep Vietnam
 afloat economically by contributing $2-3M per day and gain the use of facilities
 in Cam Ranh Bay.  The Chinese, for their part, continue to support the resistance
 forces while occasionally threatening to "teach Vietnam a second lesson" along
 their common border. These measures are designed to force the Vietnamese out of
 Kampuchea and the Soviets out of Vietnam, but they are unlikely to succeed.

 The Technological Race
 Acquisition of goods and technology from the West has made a critical
 contribution to Soviet military power.  While that power rests fundamentally
 on the large size and diversity of the Soviet economy and its broad technical
 and scientific base, the Soviet armed forces have benefitted substantially
 from a determined, sustained Soviet effort to acquire sophisticated technology
 from the West.  Over the years, this effort has yielded significant savings
 in cost and/or development time as well as enhanced weapons capabilities.
 Moscow uses a combination of legal and illegal channels to acquire certain
 products and technologies as part of a highly organized and focused program.
 For example, Moscow has relied heavily on clandestine imports of Western
 equipment and technology to systematically build a modern microelectronics
 industry.  This newly acquired capability in microelectronics is a critical
 basis for large and wide-ranging enhancements in the sophistication of
 Soviet military systems, including ASW sensors and weapons systems and air
 defense and ballistic missiles.  These Soviet acquisitions also have
 made it necessary for the United States to undertake the development of a new
 generation of microelectronic devices to maintain a technological lead in
 future weapons systems.  This development program, called VHSIC (Very-High-
 Speed Integrated Circuits), will require an initial US investment outlay for
 Trucks produced at the Kama River truck plant, built with massive imports
 of some $3 billion worth of Western automotive production equipment and
 technology, are currently the mainstay of Soviet military units above division
 level opposite NATO.  Kama trucks also are in use by Soviet forces in
 Afghanistan.  Large purchases of numerically-controlled machine tools from
 Japan and Western Europe may already have benefited some Soviet military
 manufacturing sectors, particularly the Soviet aircraft industry.

 PROPAGANDA
 Here there is room for considerable improvement in operating against the
 traditional advantages the Soviets have had because of their enormous propa-
 ganda and dissemination machineries, their disregard for truth, and the
 gullibility of many of the audiences at which they aim.  I would in particular
 stress certain aspects of this question:  there has been (1) a definite
 increase in KGB resort to disinformation and forgeries, as part of the broader
 Soviet program of covert activities; (2) highly organized Soviet-sponsored
 efforts to capitalize on and aggravate the disquiet many Western Europeans
 have concerning the po:;sibility of nuclear warfare in Europe; and (3)
 continuing Soviet emphasis on such questions as the Palestinians and Southern
 Africa, where ready audiences exist for many of the Soviet propaganda
 themes.  In addition, the US faces continuing difficulty in getting friendly
 governments and publics to act on the basis of what they know to be the truth,
 ,or certain world questions, in instances where they think their interests
 dictate otherwise.  For reasons such as these we have had difficulty, for
 example, in getting adequate responses to the problems of yellow rain in
 Indochina and Afghanistan, the rapid pace at which SS-20's targeted at Western
 Europe are being installed, and Soviet and Soviet proxy supply of weapons and
 training of insurgents in Central America.

 The US response to these problems is largely the domain of entities other
 than the Intelligence Community: that is, the ICA, the Voice of America, Radio
 Free Europe, Radio Liberty, and so on.  Such groups enjoy credibility abroad
 for their strict factual presentations to date, but in addition-to
 strengthening these groups' capabilities, there is opportunity for more direct
 focus by these groups on the many vulnerabilities of Soviet and pro-Soviet
 groups, and there is more the Intelligence Community can do to supply such
 overt media with hard factual data about those vulnerabilities.  Paralleling
 this, CIA special activities are also providing an increasingly effective
 response to Soviet propaganda.

 ECONOMIC COMPETITION IN THE FREE WORLD
 The increase in foreign industrial competition in recent years has
 become a very serious concern.  This growing competition has affected not
 only traditionally strong US economic activities such as automobile produc-
 tion, but also threatens the future development of high technology indus-
 tries important as a major source of export earnings and critical to
 national defense.  Although US domestic industrial policy is outside the
 scope of CIA concerns, I have directed the start of a research program on
 various aspects of Western industrial competition which bear on the ability
 of US industries to compete in US and foreign markets.  The program will
 look at the underlying productive factors in foreign economies, such as
 labor and capital markets, which shape the competitive position of key
 industries; will examine industrial strategies employed by various foreign
 governments with a special emphasis on identifying preferential policies
 fostering high-technology industries that would put US fires at an unfair
 competitive disadvantage; and will try to identify industries that may be
 increasingly subject to foreign competition.
 Of equal concern is the impact that increased foreign competition is
 having on the economic health of the Alliance.  The European allies appear
 to be adjusting even less well than the United States to industrial compe-
 tition that is hitting them from three sides:                       from low-cost, unskilled
 labor in LDC manufacturing industries; from the Newly Industrialized Coun-
 tries (NICs) in basic, medium-technology industries such as steel and
 petrochemicals; and from Japan and other Pacific-Rim countries in high-
 technology industries.  The ability of the European allies to adjust to

 this competition is being impeded by institutional problems.  Among the
 consequences of inadequate adjustment are not only rising unemployment and
 slow growth but also a lessened willingness to entertain any substantial
 cuts in trade with the'fast or other major US initiatives on East-West
 technology transfer.  Rising protectionist sentiments may also tend to make
 our major trading partners less willing to accept proposals to expand the
 scope of the international trade system into the service sector.
