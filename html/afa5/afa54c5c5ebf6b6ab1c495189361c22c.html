1. ZORIN ELABORATES ON HIS 8 JULY 
DISARMAMENT STATEMENT 
Comment on: 
In a 9 July bilateral meeting with the 
United States, Soviet delegate Zorin 
expressed surprise at the negative re-
action of the Western delegates to his 
8 July statement in the subcommittee. He said everything 
in the statement was already included in the Soviet 7 June 
memorandum, just as the US delegate had placed in the 
record the US position as outlined on 31 May. 
Zorin claimed that in some respects 
his 8 July statement represented an advance from the 7 June 
Soviet memorandum. In contrast he thought that the latest 
Western proposals, which connect suspension of tests not 
only with a cessation of production but also with the reduc-
tion of armaments, were a step backward from the US views 
of 31 May and that the Western proposal for a committee of 
experts to study controls for suspension of tests would delay 
progress. 
This led him to believe that the United 
States had not succeeded in securing the approval of other 
Western delegations for its positions of 31 May. He recom-
mended additional bilateral meetings between the Soviet and 
other Western delegations. 
Zorin said no further advances could be 
expected from the Soviet Union until the United States responded 
to the Soviet memorandum of 7 June.

2. DEPOSED SOVIET LEADERS GIVEN NEW JOBS 
Moscow radio announced on 10 July that 
the "members of the Malenkov, Molotov 
and Kaganovich antiparty group," deposed 
in the June purge, had been transferred 
to other work. Malenkov has been assigned 
to direct the Ust Kamenogorsk hydroelectric station in east 
Kazakhstan. The specific jobs of the other ousted leaders were 
not stated. 
The broadcast revealed strong sensitivity 
to Western press and radio speculation that the recent wave of 
meetings and demonstrations in the USSR against the ousted 
leaders was preparation for a Stalinist-type liquidation of the 
purgees, and insisted that they were justly condemned but were 
not being persecuted. The Communist Party is "not in the habit 
of taking petty revenge," it was explained. 
Though the possibility cannot be ruled out that 
further action might yet be taken against members of the "anti-
party" group, Khrushchev has apparently ruled out the vindictive 
persecutions of the Stalinist period.

3., PRESIDIUM MAJORITY MAY HAVE OPPOSED KHRUSHCHEV 
Comment on: 
A recent Soviet speech suggests that Khru-
shchev was confronted on 18 June by a 
majority within the Soviet party presidium 
who demanded that he step down as party 
secretary. Frol R. Kozlov, Leningrad party boss who was 
upped from candidate to full member of the presidium as a 
result of the recent purge, told a Leningrad party meeting on 
2 July that the "antiparty group" carried on its work secretly, 
trying to organize members of the party presidium "in order 
to knock together a majority, even if temporary and formal," 
and to bring about a change in the membership of the presidium 
and secretariat of the party central committee. The American 
embassy comments that it is unlikely Kozlov would gratuitously 
imply that a majority of the presidium had been against the Khru-
shchev leadership unless this were true. 
A line-up of the two sides would iriclude 
Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Pervukhin, and posaibly 
Bulganin and Voroshilov in the "majority" against Khrushchev 
and Mikoyan. Saburov was attending a CEMA meeting in War-
saw on 18 June, Kirichenko was at his home in Kiev, and Suslov, 
who did not appear publicly in Moscow from 19 May to 1 July, 
was probably on vacation. Candidate members do not vote in 
the presidium,but all candidate members present, except Shepi-
loy, apparently supported Khrushchev in the argument, since 
they were promoted to full membership in the new expanded 
presidium. 
If Bulganin and Voroshilov did side against 
Khrushchev, they will probably suffer in due course. They may 
be demoted to presidium candidate status like Pervukhin or ousted 
from the presidium like Saburov. Such action would probably be 
followed by loss of their government posts.

4. SOVIET LEADERS ARRIVE IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
Comment on: 
Khrushchev's speeches since his arrival 
in Czechoslovakia on 9 July Suggest that 
no sweeping changes in the Czech leader-
ship are planned. Khrushchev stated that 
the Soviet leaders had come to make a 
"friendly visit...not in order to settle any contentious ques-
tions or differences, for we are in full agreement." In his 
greeting to President Zapotocky in Prague, he stated that he 
felt the members of the Soviet delegation were now in the 
midst of "our closest relatives and faithful friends." 
In their initial exchanges with the Soviets, 
the Czech leaders have appeared confident and apparently re-
main secure in their positions. Khrushchev has twice referred 
to Czech Party First Secretary Novotny in ternis of glowing 
praise. Although not similarly praised, Premier Siroky made 
a major address at the official luncheon in Prague given for 
the Soviet delegation and attended by top members of the  Czech 
government and party.

5. MAO TSE-TUNG REPORTEDLY APPROVES SOVIET 
PARTY PURGE 
Mao Tse-tung approves of the Soviet 
party purge as strengthening those who 
support the Chinese  Communist view on 
intrabloc relations. 
Mao reportedly expressed concern dur-
ing Voroshilov's visit to Peiping in April over Soviet rela-
tions with Yugoslavia and Poland, arguing that bloc unity 
must be maintained despite differences in the domestic pro-
grams of Communist states. Peiping is said to believe that 
Khrushchev's first tasks are the restoration of good relations 
with Yugoslavia and the improvement of relations with Poland. 
Comment 
Peiping for the past year has advocated 
policies in intrabloc relations with which 
Khrushchev has been generally identified and which Molotov 
is known to have opposed. 
In early 1957, when the Kremlin was pub-
licly quarreling with Belgrade and Warsaw, the Chinese crit-
icized the conduct of the dispute and suggested that differences 
should be ironed out in private. In recent months the Kremlin 
has been attempting to smooth over its disagreements with 
Yugoslav and Polish policies. Peiping probably feels that fur-
ther efforts are in order.

6. BONN SEEN DESIRING AMPLIFICATION OF DISARMA-
MENT-REUNIFICATION LINK 
Despite the West German government's 
shift in recent weeks to a public position 
more favorable toward the London disarm-
ament negotiations, the American embassy 
in Bonn believes that actually the government is unenthusias-
tic, particularly as regards the European inspection zone. Em-
bassy officials believe that in private meetings Bonn may seek 
a Western agreement spelling out the link between disarmament 
and reunification. 
While Bonn will yield to popular opinion in 
supporting the principle of a European inspection zone, the 
embassy feels it may try to set certain conditions for such as-
pects as the location and extent of the area and the need to 
avoid recognizing the East German Communist regime. The 
Germans may also seek to influence the timing of action on re-
unification, possibly by pressing for Western agreement on a 
date for four-power talks with the USSR on that subject. 
Comment Despite Chancellor Adenauer's fears that a 
disarmament agreement would tend to perpetu-
ate the split of Germany, the Bunde stag election campaign is 
likely to cause the government to adapt its public stand more 
and more to the general eagerness in West Germany for a de-
tente. Bonn may also have to limit its private lobbying in 
Western circles, in view of the danger that its demands might 
be leaked during the election campaign.

7.. THE NEW JAPANESE CABINET 
Comment on: 
The Japanese cabinet installed on 10 July 
replaces the one Prime Minister Nobusuke 
Kishi inherited from his predecessor last 
February and is designed to give the gov-
ernment more of a "Kishi look." No radical changes are ex-
pected in either domestic or foreign policy. 
Kishi waited more than four months, until 
he had gained increased prestige and political strength from 
trips to Southeast Asia and the United States, before undertak-
ing cabinet changes which might otherwise have precipitated a 
renewal of factional struggles within the conservative Liberal-
Democratic Party. Kishi also changed officials in the top posts 
of the party and probably has consolidated his position. Some 
factional leaders, however, may not be completely satisfied. 
The post of foreign minister, which had been 
held by Kishi himself, was given to Aiichiro Fujiyama, 60-year-
old industrial magnate and president of the Japan Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry. His selection is an attempt to win 
greater support from Japanese business circles and to imple-
ment Kishi's insistence on "economic diplomacy," particularly 
with regard to Southeast Asia. 
Mitsujiro Ishii was retained as deputy prime 
minister. Ichiro Kono, strong man of the former Hatoyama cab-
inet, was named director of the Economic Planning Board. 
Hayato Ikeda, whose refusal to surrender the finance portfolio 
had threatened to complicate the cabinet reshuffle, was dropped 
and replaced by Hisato Ichimada, former finance minister under 
Hatoyama.

8, PEIPING MAY REPLACE NON-COMMUNIST CABINET 
IVIINIS TE RS 
Comment on: 
The increasingly bitter attacks on non-
Communist "rightists" by the Chinese 
Communist National People's Congress 
now in session suggest that Peiping is 
building up a case for discharging them 
m ca net sitions and expelling them from "democratic" 
puppet parties. 
On 10 July, one speaker at the congress 
urged all members of his party, the China Democratic League, 
to dissociate themselves "politically and ideologically" from 
the "rightists." 
The ministers of communications, food 
and timber industry have drawn particularly sharp condemna-
tion. On 8 July, Peiping reported that over 3,000 employees 
of the Ministry of Communications met to denounce the com-
plaint of the minister, Chang Po-chun, that non-Communist 
officials have position but no authority. One employee crit-
icized Chang for excessive absenteeism, failure to attend 37 
out of 49 meetings of the ministry, and failure to fulfill his 
responsibilities. 
Although the "rightists" may have originally 
felt there was some support for their positions within Commu-
nist Party ranks, no Communists have yet been singled out as 
coconspirators, and a party purge is apparently not imminent.

9c. NEHRU REPORTEDLY AGAIN CONSIDERING 
RESIGNING AS PRIME MINISTER 
Comment on: 
Prime Minister Nehru has again indi-
cated 
that he is considering resign-
1 
he is increasingly unable to deal with the 
country's problems and should leave the administration to 
stronger hands. 
Vice President Radhakrishnan report-
edly believes that if Nehru resigns as prime minister, either 
permanently or for a few months only, he will be replaced 
by Pandit Pant, the moderately conservative minister for home 
affairs. Pant is considered a logical choice to carry on the 
Congress Party's program, although Minister of Commerce 
and Industry Morarji Desai may challenge his position as ulti-
mate successor. 
On several past occasions when he has been 
under heavy stress, Nehru has considered stepping down as 
formal government leader in order to devote more time to party 
affairs and broader work for the welfare of India. The country 
is again entering a period of unusual strain, particularly in the 
economic field. The decision Nehru must face, now as before, 
is whether the country would be provided with stronger and more 
effective leadership if he retired. In the past he has decided 
each time that his continued leadership was needed.

10 , COMMUNIST-INSPIRED PROTEST MEETING MAY 
SPARK UNREST IN CHILE 
Comment on: 
ances. 
A Communist-inspired National Com-
mand meeting, scheduled for 11 July 
in Santiago, Chile, to protest price in-
creases may result in public disturb-
The price increases of 6 July on essential consumer 
items were brought about by the abandonment of costly gov-
ernment subsidies which were causing serious budget def-
icits and endangering the US-backed economic stabilization 
program. A similar attempt in early April resulted in wide-
spread disorders which forced the government to retract the 
price rises. 
The National Command, composed of la-
bor, student and left-wing political leaders, is reportedly 
planfiing boycotts and half-hour work stoppages. Commu-
nist Party leaders are considering mass action to give force 
to the protest. The government, which has taken extensive 
military and police preparations against potential trouble, ap-
pears confident and has partially relaxed the state of alert or-
dered on 5 July.

SUMMARY 
26 June - 10 July 1957 
THE TAIWAN STRAIT 
Report of the IAC Current Intelligence Group 
for the Taiwan Strait Problem 
1. Combat activity has abated in the area since 24 June when 
the Chinese Communists carried out a heavy shelling of the Que-
moys. The shelling is now believed to have involved 3,000 to 4,500 
rounds rather than the 9,000 originally reported. No significant 
artillery exchanges have occurred since that date. 
2. Aerial photographs of 10 July revealed 24 MIG-type fighters 
at Hsincheng airfield, about 250 miles west of the Quemoys. Earlier 
flights of Chinese Communist transports to this base suggest that 
this may be a permanent deployment of jet fighters to Hsincheng. 
A newly constructed air base, Hsincheng was completed earlier 
this year. 
Similar photography has also confirmed the use of Chenghai 
airfield, near Swatow, by Chinese Communist jet fighters. On 8 
July, there were four MIG-type aircraft on this southernmost of the 
coastal airfields on the mainland opposite Taiwan; however, reports 
of a 9 July Nationalist reconnaissance mission indicate that the jet 
fighters had departed. 
a few jet fighters had operated temporarily at Chenghai in Jan-
uary 1956, but this was not confirmed. This airfield could be used 
as a forward staging base for air defense in much the same manner 
as the new airfield at Shuikou, between Canton and Swatow. 
Use of Chenghai airfield and the move of jet fighters to 
Hsincheng airfield reflects some increase in Chinese Communist 
air defense capabilities in south and southeast China. The move-
ments of aircraft appear to be aimed at discouraging Nationalist 
flights  over the mainland rather than for any purely offensive pur-
pose.
