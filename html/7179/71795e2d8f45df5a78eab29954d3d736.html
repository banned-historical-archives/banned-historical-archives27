 This study was completed before the "revelation"
 (12 February 1961) of the highly controversial proceedings
 of the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers Parties
 (November-December 1960).  Whatever the inspiration of the
 "leakage" of this information, it has had two beneficial effects:
 (1) it has permitted a partial downgrading of classification on
 the intelligence discussion of the meeting, and (2) has sharply
 focussed the issues of Free World and US attitude and policy
 toward the Sino-Soviet alliance and International Communism.
 This paper, although buttressed in a comprehensive
 study of available information, is deliberately speculative
 in approach.  It attempts to look at the Moscow Statement
 primarily "through communist eyes. " This. effort has led to
 certain conclusions which are not optimistic in nature.
 Specifically, we question, more strongly than ever, the
 widely held belief that there exists an antagonistic "rift" or
 "split'! within the Communist movement which can readily be
 deepe,ed through divisive activity on our part.  This is not
 a "defeatist" attitude so much as a counsel of prudence and
 deliberation.  Our message is simple:  let all persons re-
 sponsible in any way for the security of the Free World and
 the United.States, study and re-study the Statement itself,
 carefully, clinically and without inclination to either hopes
 or fears.
 The views expressed in this paper are solely those of
 the Senior Research.Staff on International Communism.  They
 have-not been coordinated with other elements of the Central
 Intelligence Agency or of the Government.  They are not to be
 interpreted as the official views of the Director of Central
 Intelligence.

 A NEW PROGRAM FOR INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM:
 The Statement of the Moscow Conference of Representatives
 of Communist and Workers Parties (December 1960)
 PART I
 This paper attempts to present in speculative discourse
 an interpretation of the developments in the Sino-Soviet rela-
 tion leading up to the issuance of the State ment`?sof the Moscow
 Conference of Workers and Communist Parties (November-
 December 1960), and to project the global impact of that doc-
 ument.                     It takes its start. in the general body of earlier West-
 ern analy`k:is, and further seeks, by utilizing newly available
 material, and by providing a supplemental "vi=ew throug1 com-
 munist eyes, " to create a perspective in which the forest pre-
 dominates over the trees.
 The paper is divided into two sections, the. first dealing
 with the antecedents of the Statement, the second with its sig-
 nificance for the future of International Communism as a move-
 ment.
 The general contention of this paper, that communist
 unity has been strengthened rather than weakened, may be
 reduced to a few propositions:
 (1)  Prior to  The Moscow Statement`s the Sino-Soviet
 relation had been marked by mounting controversy, coinciding
 roughly with the period of ascendancy of Khrushchev, (i. e.
 since early 1956);
 (2)  This controversy has been serious, but not, in the
 outcome, dangerously divisive; it has centered in what the
 communists call "differences" and in some cases "contradic-
 tions. "                   The effort of the parties at the Moscow Conference
 was to resolve these, if possible, by "fraternal criticism and
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08  CIA-RDP80-01445R000 -an &I "  "Num
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100200001-5
 self-criticisms " and in any case to prevent them from becom-
 ing "antagonistic. "
 (3)  The great bulk of the points of controversy have not
 been of a fundamental ideological or strategic nature; they have
 not involved the ultimate goals of the movement.  Rather they
 have been matters of emphasis or interpretation, of methods
 and tactics, and in the last analysis, frequently of towering
 personality conflict.
 (4)  The Statement which emerged marks a real turning
 point in the history of the movement constituting a general
 program - the first since early Comintern days - within which
 individual parties, greater and less, can develop their partic-
 ular programs, suited to their specific opportunities and cir-
 cumstance s.
 (5) As a result of the confrontation of the two senior
 parties sparring in "contradiction" in the presence of some
 80 lesser parties, the movement has entered a new phase of
 organization and discipline, in which there is no longer a single
 "leader" or "center, " at most a "vanguard. " What appears to
 be emerging as an expansion of the "world socialist system"
 (the 12 members of the Sino-Soviet bloc) is a sodruzhestvo
 (commonwealth or community) of socialist nations, as yet
 without organizational form, but pregnant with such.
 (6) Although some of the earlier differences and contra-
 dictions will persist and new ones will arise, the entire exer-
 cise   from the Communist viewpoint - has been a successful
 demonstration of Mao's cardinal operating principle:  unity-
 criticism-unity.  As such it will, in our judgment, usher the
 movement into a period of greater confidence, flexibility and
 power, and will heighten the threat posed to the Free: World.

 I.     Antecedents of The Moscow Statement
 By a remarkable convergence of intelligence coverage,
 our knowledge of the Moscow conference andits antecedents
 is quite extensive.  It can be said with some confidence that
 we know in general what went on in the movement ever since
 the Bucharest Conference (June 1960) and are well-informed
 on both the preparatory drafting commission of October and
 the conference itself, at least insofar as these could be re-
 ported on by competent delegate observers.  It does not fol-
 low from this, however, that our information enables us to
 penetrate into the innermost workings, into the heart of these
 gatherings; for, as in any massive conclave with hundreds of
 delegates, it is obvious that certain key processes, deals and
 arrangements occurred outside the area which. an ordinary par-
 ticipant could hold in observation.
 Onemay question at the outset whether any of the par-
 ticipants, including the. CPSU itself, expected that the general
 proceedings could be kept entirely secret from the West.  With
 such a large number of delegates from virtually every country
 of the world, it was inevitable that security would sooner or
 later be broken.  In this sense the situation may be somewhat
 comparable to the leakage of the secret report of Khrushchev
 to the 20th Party Congress, February 1956 - the notorious de-
 Stalinization speech.  The delivery of that speech was sur-
 rounded with considerable security, but, in the process of
 propagandizing it throughout the party ranks of the USSR and
 the key satellites, it must have been anticipated that sooner
 or later the West would get hold of it.  This indirect form of
 leakage may perhaps be described as a deliberate taking ad-
 vantage of the realities of Communist security limitations to.
 enhance the dramatic impact of an epoch-making event.
 The first and most striking conclusion which the avail-
 able material suggests is that the November meeting, -and the
 preparatory commission's deliberations in October, were in

 fact the culmination of a sharp and even bitter Sino-Soviet
 controversy,  In this sense the new material confirms the
 validity of much of the Western analysis of the preceding
 months.  This analysis which had been based largely on semi-
 esoteric "indications" :provided by published Communist ma-
 terial had succeeded in. isolating a number of themes which
 were being antithetically treated by the two senior partners
 of the movement.  With very few exceptions these antitheses
 were conspicuous in the October and November meetings.
 The new material therefore constitutes a further proof of the
 value of "indications" analysis.   At the same time, however,
 as we shall attempt to demonstrate in the second section of
 this paper, the limitations of this type of analysis have also
 become more apparent.  For, beneath the surface manifesta-
 tions of the controversy, lie certain deeper issues involving
 the unity and future dynamics of the world movement', which
 have now emerged, we believe, in a light quite different from
 that projected upon them by much of the earlier commentary.
 It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss in detail.
 the information which we now have on the speeches and dis-
 cussions of the two meetings.  These deserve continued and
 profound research.  We propose here to draw only a few ten-
 tative conclusions which will serve in laying the foundation for
 the principal thesis presented in the second part of this paper.
 B.y now-it has, become clear that the controversy between
 the CPSU and the CPC was generally coeval with the rule of
 Khrushchev, i. e. it emerged during the "crisis" of 1956, +_"
 de-Stalinization, Poland and Hungary - and the "stabilization"
 process of early 1957. 1.  The fact that the CPC leaders, espec-
 ially Mao Tse-tung, had personally come to the rescue of the
 1
 One of the first and most gratifying successes of "indications
 analysis" was Myron Rush's (RAND Corporation) study of the
 rise of Khrushchev, which in its pre-publication statement
 (March 1957) accurately forecast his triumph over the "anti-
 party group" in July 1957.

 CPSU, especially between December 1956 and the spring of
 1957, now stands forth clearly as a major source of ill-feeling.
 Mao's two famous statements, "More on the Historical Dicta-
 torship of the Proletariat" and."On the Correct Handling of
 Contradictions, " struck some Western observers at the time
 as containing the seeds of potential animosity.  The rather
 olympiaii and apodictic tone of these articles must have struck
 the CPSU leaders as, to say the least, highly condescending:
 "This is how it's. done, boys!" They were probably all the
 more galling, because in fact they did contribute effectively
 to bailing out Khrushchev.
 At the same time the very success of these pronounce-
 ments may also have contributed to the rapid inflation of Mao's
 already far from insubstantial ego and to the crescendo devel-
 opment of his "cult of personality" which reached its climax
 with the 10th Anniversary of the Chinese revolution, Peking,
 October 1959.    The subsequent heavy stress in. Communist
 China on study of the "tihought of Mao Tse-tung" led to one of
 the sharpest notes of criticism in the October and November
 1960 meetings.    The. Chinese were accused bythe Soviet spokes-
 men, and to some extent by other party leaders, of attempting
 to "Sinicize" Marxism-Leninism.  This in turn was associated
 with. "dogmatic- sectarian1t deviation and with a''Uivorce" from
 reality, the masses, and "life", a charge which was bitterly
 resented by the Chinese delegates and of course by Mao him-
 self.2
 Cf. SRS-12, "The Tenth Anniversary Celebration of the
 People's Republic of China"  1 September 1959.
 One of the more interesting revelations of the new material
 is the fact that Mao, at the Moscow conference of November
 1957, admitted to a certain degree of illness which his aobtors
 had diagnosed as "brain anemia. " Whatever this malady may
 have been, there is no definite evidence to bear out the conjec-=
 tures of some Western analysts that it is of a, paranoid or in-
 capacitating severity - still less that it has led the CPC to put
 Mao in effect into cotton batting, i.e. withdrawing real power

 The Chinese in both the preparatory and the full meet-
 ings of course denied categorically the adverse imputations
 of Sinicization.  They claimed that they have stood firmly on
 the principles of Marxism-Leninism,. and that the genius of
 Mao lay in his adaptation of these universal precepts to the
 specific conditions of China.  They professed that the lessons
 of their experience could be of value to other parties in com-
 parable situations - a claim which the CPSU could hardly,."deny
 but they did not attempt to put theirs ahead of the richer and
 more varied experience of the senior party.
 This matter of personal sensitivity of the two top lead-
 ers breaks out repeatedly in the reports of the proceedings.
 Mao, of course, appears only vicariously through his dogged
 mouthpiece, Teng Hsiao-ping.  But the resentful and at times
 even petulant voice of tthe latter must have echoed the somber
 jealousies of his chief,  "sulking in his tent" back in China.
 Khrushchev on the other hand was "in there pitching, " with a
 near "shoe-pounding" vigor.     He made at least three important
 speeches, combining a general tone of conciliation and reason-
 ableness with ill-cdhcealed undertones of vexation and pique
 and occasional righteous indignation.  During the preparatory
 meeting, from which Khrushchev was absent - being at the UN
 - a phalanx of senior CPSU leaders headed by Comrade Suslov
 appeared to be trying to intimidate, if not overpower, Comrade
 Teng.  One is left with the impression that this was:a situation
 to which the Soviet leaders were unaccustomed, the persistent
 refusal of a wayward but embattled comrade to be browbeaten,
 cajoled;, or simply out-talked by the voice of established au-,
 thority.
 from him while exaggerating his role as father-demigod of
 the revolution.  It may turn out that this interpretation is
 indeed partly correct, but so far there is abundant testimony
 that Mao not only is active but is fully in command of the
 Chinese party.

 .A striking feature of the continuing controversy was the
 inflammatory effect of. an exchange of disputatious letters
 between the two parties obviously addressed not so much to
 each other as to an attendant claque of lesser parties.  This
 series of provocation and counterprovocati.on.c.annow be re-
 constructed with considerable precision, and it conforms
 rather closely to the theses derived from open material by
 earlier Western.analysis.  The 8.2-page letter circulated by
 the CPSU at Bucharest, the September 10 letter of the CPC,
 and the November 4 counter-rebuttal letter of the CPSU dis-
 tributed to the delegates at the Moscow conference are the
 high. points in this thicket of mutual recrimination.
 For the purpose of the present analysis, it is the last
 of these three documents which presents. the most serious
 problem.. The deliberations of the preparatory commission,
 though sharp and even acrimonious, had in fact ended in a
 general acceptance by the CPC of the draft. submitted by the
 CPSU, subject to reservations which would be aired: before
 the full conference.  It would have seemed, therefore, that
 the Chinese had displayed sufficient conciliatory spirit and
 willingness to make concessions so that the CPSU might have
 been satisfied to let the conference take its normal course.
 Instead, however, it circulated the November 4 letter to the
 delegates at the beginning of the conference, thereby guaran-
 teeing a new flareup of all the angry themes which had been
 damped in October.
 The question arises, why was this renewal of controver-
 sy precipitated by the CPSU?  Possibly Khrushchev felt that
 so many. of the basic issues remained unresolved despite sur-
 face accommodation by the Chinese that it was better to bring
 them out in the open before the plenary session of the move-
 ment.                             He may also have believed that the radical, bellicose
 and impetuous nature of the CPC and the CPR had to be dem-
 onstrated before all the brethren in order to. show the gravity

 of the contradiction with the CPSU.  Be that as it may, the act
 of circulating this letter certainly contributed to the prolonged
 forensics of the November conference, a fact which the Chinese
 peevishly pointed out.
 One of the most striking conclusions which emerges from
 the speeches of the November meeting is that the points at issue,
 whatever they may have been at earlier stages, were not of a
 fundamental ideological, or strategic nature, so far as the move-
 ment was concerned.  The broad themes of the Statement, deal-
 ing with the character and nature of the epoch, the aggressive
 nature of imperialism, the "non-inevitability" of war, and the
 dual possibility of violent and non-violent transition to social-
 ism, had virtually been reduced to accepted formulas.  The
 points at issue between the Chinese and the Soviet parties had
 come, therefore, to be ;primarily matters of emphasis, and
 as such they should have been susceptible of either immediate
 or longer term resolution.  In other words, the potentially
 "antagonistic contradictions" had largely been removed and
 what remained were either limited. "non-antagonistic" contra-
 dictions or at a still lower level, differences. 1
 The Soviet and Chinese theories on contradictions are
 both derived of course from Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism
 but their practical development has followed somewhat diver-
 gent courses.  It is rather noteworthy that in the texts which
 we have of the conference speeches, the emphasis throughout
 is on differences rather than contradictions.  Khrushchev,
 1
 The Russian distinction between protivorechie (contradiction)
 and_raznitza or razlichie(difference) is paralleled in Chinese
 by the terms mao tun and ch?a pieh.   Chou En-Lai, in his inter-
 view with Edgar Snow (Look Magazine, January 31, 1961) said
 that the latter term should be translated as "dissimilarity. "
 It would be more accurate to define ch'a pieh as difference:
 in degree or in this case: in approach; not in kind or in this
 case in the fundamentals; comparison rather than contrast;
 certainly contradiction is not suggested.

 however, in his final speech admits that contradictions will
 persist even among Socialist states, apparently an important,
 and from the Chinese point of view overdue, acceptance of one
 of Mao's cardinal principles - the universality of contradictions
 even under socialism. 1
 If, then, the fundamental issues had been generally re-
 solved - or at least "put on ice" - what were the contradictions
 or differences that persisted during the discussions, and were
 deplored as threatening unity?  On the surface they had to do
 almost entirely with matters of discipline in the movement and
 the conduct of relations among the parties.. Specifically the
 Chinese were opposed to passages in the draft declaration bear-
 ing on (1) factionalism, (2) national communism, and (3) the
 universal significance for the movement of the 2Oth and 21st
 Congresses of the CPSU.  In the discussion of these points the
 Chinese delegates several times resorted to a term which Mao
 had used admonishingly in December 1956, "great nation chau-
 vinism, " specifically Russian, which implied exclusive or mon-
 opolistic predominance of the CPSU in the movement.
 Outwardly the tension of charge and counter-charge was
 somewhat relieved by a curious. "Gaston-Alphonse" act between
 the CPSU and the CPC over the titular aspect of the former's
 position, i. e. whether it was the "leader of the camp" or the
 "center of the movement" or both.
 The byplay of this delicate piece of communist semantics
 and etiquette had been noticeable for some time.  As far back

 We are preparing a closer analysis of this aspect of the cur-
 rent dialectic; we believe that the topic is not a matter of
 communist Jargon or logic-chopping but is of fundamental
 importance for understanding the Sino-Soviet relat</div></div></div>  </div>
