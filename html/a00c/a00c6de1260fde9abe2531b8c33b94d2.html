 504.  The International Commission of Jurists and-the-Berlin Wall            25X1C10b
 Background:  The International Commission of Jurists is, in its own
 words   a non-governmental organization which has Consultative Status,
 Category 'B', with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.  The
 Commission seeks to foster understanding of and respect for the Rule of
 Law. " Its membership embraces distinguished jurists, lawyers and
 scholars of the law drawn from all parts of the world.  It has been active
 in studying and publicizing cases where human rights have been violated,
 where the Rule of Law has been ignored and where dictatorial or totali-
 tarian practices have invaded or denied individual rights and freed ;rn3.
 Its report on the Tibetan takeover, on Apartheid in South Africa and on
 the Hungarian rebellion have received wide circulation and been highly
 acclaimed.   On 7 March 1962, the ICJ released in Geneva a pamphlet
 entitled "The Berlin Wall - A Defiance of Human Rights. "  This little
 pamphlet is a concise  and factual study of the legal and juridical aspects
 of the walling off of East Berlin from West Berlin, well documented by
 reference to and citations of applicable laws, ordinances, treaties, etc.
 For example, the document points out that freedom to emigrate is
 F uarantee(I under the Constitution of the German Democratic Republic
 p. 44).

 505. Khrushchev Fails to Solve Soviet Agricultural Problems
 25X1 C 10b
 Back round:  The CPSU Central Committee plenary session, which
 began on     arch 1962, ended on 9 March with the persistent problem
 of agriculture having occupied, as expected, the attention of the confer-
 once to the apparent exclusion of everything else.   If there were any
 discussions of other matters they were not published.  In two lengthy
 speeches at the beginning and end of the session, Khrushchev claimed
 that there was no insoluble problem in Soviet agriculture but it was
 clear enough from what he said and what was decided at the session
 that this chronic problem was exactly what the session was all about.
 Khrushchev compared the strength of Soviet industry with the unending
 weakness of its agriculture.  He admitted that food production in general
 was nowhere near fulfilling its Plan and, in particular, that "in certain
 towns there has been an interruption of the supply of meat; the population
 has had to go through certain difficulties." But there was no sign of the
 radical measures for which the situation plainly calls.  Instead of asking
 how the system could be adapted to meet the demands of reality, he
 brought forward two more panaceas, neither of which was, at most,
 more than an expedient or shift of a highly dubious kind: the abandon-
 ment of ley farming (intercropping with fodder crops instead of grasses -
 ; and a brand-new apparatus called the          25X1 C10b
 production management unit for centralized management and control.
 Once again, Mr. Khrushchev has evaded the subject of private property -
 a vital matter which was not mentioned by anybody present at the plenum
 and, as usual, substituted additional doses of Communist bureaucracy.
 Khrushchev ignores the fact that the Soviet farmer was doing well enough
 before collectivization; he ignores the fact that a Communist farmer
 (or any other) will produce more if he is allowed to do so for himself
 and his family, instead of for a doctrine he is compelled to believe or
 to work for even if he doesn't.  Nobody can expect the USSR to equal
 more temperate countries in yield per acre or in per capita production
 of meat, milk or eggs.  It was not lack of moisture which caused the
 catastrophic fall in production in the terrible days of collectivization under
 Stalin - and it has not been lack of moisture which has ruined the agriculture
 of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany or Communist China.  Agriculture
 has been doing fairly well (for a non-free country) in only one Communist
 state: Poland.  And in Poland the farmers have rejected collectivization -
 or in effect, communism in agriculture.  The Plenum condemned as a
 scientific failure the grass rotation system under which a sizeable section
 (perhaps a quarter) of Soviet farm land was in low-yielding hayfields
 and asked for wider planting of more productive feed crops such as corn,
 sugar beets, peas and beans.  The plenum also called for the organization
 of 'a dual system of regional agricultural management

 consisting of collective and state farms and agriculture coordinating
 committees headed by first Secretaries of the regional Party organization
 (i.e. the production management units).  In short, they substituted more
 Party controls and more coordinating committees instead of doing what
 was really needed: giving the farmer more capital, more fertilizer and,
 above all, setting him free.  But, understandably, they couldn't or
 wouldn't do that: while no doubt it would lead to the solution of their
 agricultural problems it would also mean the end of the Communist system.

 506. Communist China Undergoes Surgery with "Criticism and Self-Criticism"
 25X1C10b
 Background:
 a.  General All of our propaganda directed toward Communist
 targets seeks to exploit, and in some cases create, a vulnerability
 in the target audience.  A clear indication that a vulnerability does
 in fact exist is when the Communists identify a situation as requiring
 "criticism and self-criticism." The Communist propagandists fre-
 quently perform this very useful service (identifying vulnerabilities)
 for us, but their doctrine denies that there are more disadvantages
 than advantages in revealing their mistakes and errors to the "enemy."
 During the past six months in Communist China there has been a
 concerted effort to strengthen party unity, exact greater cadre
 discipline, and instill greater revolutionary zeal among the masses
 by pointing to the need to undertake "criticism and self-criticism. "
 It is the function of this guidance to highlight the theoretical base of
 the slogan "criticism and self-criticism, It point to its strengths and
 weaknesses from the anti-Communist propagandist's point of view,
 and establish guidelines for the exploitation of this dialectic as a
 panacea for all Communist problems.
 b.  Doctrinal Base.  As might be expected, Marx first said it.
 In his 'Eighteent  rumaire (1852) he writes:
 "Bourgeois revolutions, like those of the eighteenth century,
 storm swiftly from success to success... but they are short
 lived.  On the otherhand, proletarian revolutions, like those
 of the nineteenth century, criticize themselves constantly,
 interrupt themselves continually in their own course, come
 back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh,
 and deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacy, weak-
 ness and paltriness of their first attempts. "
 Lenin's writings, while making it clear that "we should not conceal
 our mistakes from the enemy" laid down certain conditions.  As
 Carew Hunt in his GUIDE TO COMMUNIST JARGON explains: Lenin's
 conditions were that "criticism must be submitted for discussion to
 the Party as a whole and not to groups." As Carew Hunt observes,
 "unwelcome criticism can easily be dismissed as destructive or by
 implication an attack on the ideological base of the Communist order
 which lies outside the field of criticism altogether." He is undoubtedly
 drawing on Lenin's "Preliminary Draft of Resolution on Party Unity"
 (1921) :
 "Everyone who criticizes must see to it that the form of his
 criticism takes into account the position the Party occupies
 in a ring of enemies, and the contents of his criticism must
 be of the nature of direct participation in Soviet and Party
 work... the study of methods of rectifying errors, etc. ,
 must under no circumstances be submitted for preliminary

 A Handbook of Communist Statements, Department of State
 p-uc a  to a   tat
 Stalin in his SHORT HISTORY OF THE CPSU wrote: "A party is
 invincible if it does not fear criticism and self-criticism." The
 WORKS OF J.V. STALIN, Vol II (1928-1929) reveals that Stalin too
 placed conditions on "self-criticism."
 "It would be strange to fear that our enemies, our internal and
 external enemies, might exploit the criticism of our shortcomings
 and raise the shout: Oho I All is not well with those Bolsheviks !
 ... What do we expect from the slogan of self-criticism, what
 results can it yield if it is carried out properly and honestly?
 ... It should sharpen the vigilance of the working class, make it
 pay more attention to our shortcomings, facilitate their correction
 and render impossible any kind of 'surprises.'... But there is
 another kind of self-criticism, one that tends to destroy the
 party spirit, to discredit the Soviet regime, to weaken our work
 of construction, to corrupt our economic cadres, to disarm the
 working class and to foster talk of degeneration... It goes without
 saying that the Party will combat such 'self-criticism' with might
 and main. "
 It was Mao Tse-tung who utilized and expanded upon the doctrine
 of criticism and self-criticism more than any other Communist
 theoretician.  During the course of the Party Reform Movement (1942-
 1943) he pointed to the need to "wash the brains" of those whose ways
 of thinking were judged inimical or unhealthy for his New Democracy.
 Self-criticism became the main crutch of the "brain washing. 11 Its
 tactical importance as a means of smoking out the opposition and
 consolidating power was emphasized again in 1956 with the beginning
 of the "blooming and contending period. " On 2 6 May 1956 Mao's
 Director of Propaganda staLad:  "The Chinese Communist Party and one
 advocates one hundred flowers bloom for literary worthe
 hundred schools contend in the scientific field... to promote freedom of independent thinking, freedom of debate, freedom of
 creation and criticism.... "  As originally conceived the program was
 intended for writ e rs, artists, and scientists, but with the news of the
 Hungarian Revolution, the program was rapidly expanded to include
 all spectrums of party and cadre  life with hope of bringing discontent
 to the surface and avoiding any ourprice macs demonstrations.  This
 period of open criticism was brought to an abrupt end in June 1957
 when a wave of anticommunism swept the Mainland and was dramatized
 by the Hanyang student uprising during which more than a thousand
 students wrecked Party and State offices and demanded Mao's
 resignation.  Hundreds of intellectuals were imprisoned or executed
 and some 20, 000 others were demoted or subjected to "reform through
 labor." In brief those who had dared "blossom" or "contend" were
 branded extreme rightists or counter-revolutionaries.
 In the midst of Mao's experiment with "blooming and contending"
 he felt compelled to add a new ideological twist to the proper conduct
 of criticism.  On 27 February 1957 he made a speech "On the Correct
 Handling of Contradictions Among the People." After stating: "Our
 the servant of the people," he admitted:               (506.  Continued)
 (506. (i4'P~rbved For Release 2m.!} VO       .   -  P78-Q$p61  01100050017-9
 "But even between this government and the people at large
 there are contradictions, including those between national
 and collective interests and individual interests, between
 democracy and centralism, between leaders and the guided,
 and between some Government-agency members with their
 bureaucratic ways and the public...  In ordinary cases,
 contradictions among the people do not involve antagonism,
 but if they are improperly handled, or if we are careless
 about them, they may turn into hostility. "
 It is important to note here that Maoism holds tb,,tnon-antagonistic
 contradiction, i. e. those other than contradiction with capitalists, can
 be eliminated by the weapon of "unity-criticism-unity" which is a
 much more cautious form of " criticism and self-criticism" since it
 demands that criticism be undertaken only in cases where the
 disputants guarantee that the criticism will yield greater unity.
 (See subparagraph C below for a recent People' Daily article on this.)
 As is well known, Khrushchev has leaned heavily on "criticism
 and self-criticism," particularly with regard to his attacks on the
 "cult of the personality" and in the field of agriculture.  He has not,
 however, added to the doctrine itself.  On numerous occasions he
 has reminded the Soviet people that they have nothing to fear from
 energetic criticism, held that such "looking at truth squarely in
 the face" is unique to the Marxist-Leninist Party, but he too imposes
 conditions.  "When we criticize the shortcomings and errors that
 have been permitted in our forward march, we must above all be
 sure that this criticism strengthens the Soviet system and helps us
 to advance even more rapidly and successfully toward our great
 aim, communism. IT (Pravda, April 13, 1956).  The recently adopted
 program of the 22nd Congress of the CPSU stated that one of the
 Party's tasks was "To develop criticism and self-criticism to the
 utmost as a tried and tested method of work and a means of disclosing
 ant rectifying errors and shortcomings and the proper education of
 cadres. "
 While criticism, with all its self-imposed restrictions, is a
 phenomenon which transcends all aspects of Communist life, it is
 usually only in times of urgency (declining morale, lagging production,
 internal party strife) that a situation is clearly isolated in Communist
 propaganda as demanding "criticism and self-criticism" therapy.
 Communist China is today in a veritable orgy of criticism.
 c.  Communist Chinese Increased Attention to "Criticism and
 Self-Criticism"  Since about the first of -the year there has been
 as noticea  a ncrease in Chinese domestic propaganda on the subject,
 but as if to avoid the mistakes of too much criticism which might
 challenge the authority of the Party itself, there has been careful
 attention to the correct handling of criticism.  Thus in an atmosphere
 of continued economic crisis, lagging food production and an admitted
 decline of "peoples morale and revolutionary zeal among the cadre, "
 the CCP has launched a campaign to stimulate correct "criticism
 and self-criticism."   For example a Peking      eop e s Daily article
 of 10 January 1962 stated:

 "To correctly implement the policy of 'unity-criticism-unity'
 we, in the process of handling the inner party ideological
 struggles, must make objectives clear and use suitable methods.
 By making objectives clear, we mean that we must clearly under-
 stand that the objective of criticism is to educate comrades and
 strengthen unity.... The aspiration for solidarity is the starting
 off point for carrying out ideological struggles within the party.
 Without this starting off point we would be unable to help comrades
 who have erred to correct their errors.  Every contradiction
 within the party must be resolved through struggles (criticism
 and self-criticism). it
 The above suggests that criticism will be most unwelcome unless there
 is the initial "aspiration for solidarity" i.e. desire to follow party
 leadership and direction.  On the following day _P_eopleDaiy recounted
 the experiences of the Party Branch of the Yung      g  roc uction
 Brigade, Hua-yang Commune, Shensi Province.  The artic?e noted
 that twnety-eight members of the Party Branch were less than 30 years
 old and there had been "shortcomings in their ideological understanding,
 work styles and methods of work."  Biweekly meetings are held at
 which "the weapon of criticism and self-criticism is applied to strengthen
 the party spirit of party members. " "The experiences of this Party
 Branch serve to show that in order to launch criticism and self-criticism
 correctly, it is necessary to grasp regularly the state of thinking of
 the party members, to find out the ideological roots of the shortcomings
 and conduct criticism in relation to reality."  (NOTE: "Reality" used
 in this context means Party line.) Any doubts about this are quickly
 dispelled in a Radio Peking domestic broadcast of 5 March:
 "The personal interests of party members and the interests
 of the party are actually 'the unity of opposites.'  In order to
 understand this one must recognize the existence of a contra-
 diction and in the meantime also recognize the 'unity.'  In
 handling this question one must place the interests of the party
 above all.  The personal interests of party members may be
 taken into account as long as they do not run counter to the
 interests of the party."
 Similarly, but more to the point, a domestic broadcast of 23 March
 stated:
 "The Chinese Communist Party and its members must constantly
 expose and eliminate their shortcomings and mistakes through
 criticism and self-criticism... it must be carried out in accordance
 with the party rules, platform, general line and policies which a
 communist must scrupulously follow in his thinking, utterances and
 actions.  Otherwise it will be against the interests of the party....
 When criticizing a comrade's ideological mistakes we must adopt
 the principle of 'unity-criticism-unity.'  In other words we must
 start from the standpoint of unity when we criticize so as to achieve
 unity on a new basis. "
 An examination of CCP domestic radio output reveals that "criticism
 and self-criticism" is applied to a heterogeneous mass of problems
 including spring planting, pro er collection of manure, problems of

 block form in the machine tool industry, domestic relations among the
 cadre, and the arts to name a few.  A striking revelation of the depth
 of the problem is contained in a broadcast of 2 November 1961:
 "Some feel that they may offend others should they become cadres."
 The broadcast notes that after talking to a representative of the CCP
 chapter who pointed out "that cadres have the complete confidence
 and trust of the people and that it is a glorious achievement to become
 a cadre, " the wife of a production team leader "revised her attitude
 and became a cadre .... As a result, she not only continues to help
 her husband in his work, but her own production enthusiasm has also
 been greatly enhanced... the valuable experience gained by this
 production brigade should be disseminated in all localities."
 Of interest and perhaps indicative  of a general line which may
 emerge from the current National People's Congress being held in
 Peking                                                                 is a    25X1 C10b
 People's Daily article of 31 March reporting that drama and opera
 writers in Canton are being encouraged to "let one hundred flowers
 bloom and one hundred schools contend." Contrary to press reports
 this- is not the first instance of a revival of "100 Flowers" since the
 1956-1957 program.  On 28 February 1961, the CCP theoretical journal
 Red F lag revived the concept by stating that the findings of scientists
 should be welcomed even if they lack a "Marxist-Leninist viewpoint"
 and noted that "Marxism-Leninism cannot replace actual study in the
 various branches of science. "                                              25X1 C10b
