 CHINA
 PARTY CONGRESS REFLECTS ENHANCED AUTHORITY OF CHOU COALITION
 Meeting in secret without prior announcement, the Chinese have
 held their party congress to formalize the results of the Lin Piao
 affair and to sanction a new leadership coalition marked by
 Chou En-tai's enhanced authority.  The CCP's 10th congress, held
 from 24 to 28 August "at a time when the Lin Piao antiparty clique
 has been smashed," was nut announced until the day after it closed.
 Mao presided and was accorded his honorific title of "great leader,"*
 but he did not speak at the congress, as he had at the previous one
 in April 1969.  The political report, delivered at the previous
 congress by Lin, was given by Chou, whose status second only to Mao
 was reflected also in the leader rankings at the congress-  The
 29 August press communique, the only document thus far available,
 also reported that rising star Wang Hung-wen delivered the report on
 the revision of the party constitution and that a new central
 committee was elected.
 In addition to expelling Lin, "the bourgeois careerist, conspirator,
 counterrevolutionary doubledealer, renegade and traitor," the
 congress also expelled Chen Po-ta, "principal member of the Lin Piao
 antiparty clique, anticommunist Kuomintang element, Trotskiyite,
 renegade, enemy agent and revisionist."  This marked the first
 official public denunciation of Lin and Chen.   The communique treads
 gingerly around "the other principal members" of the Lin clique, the
 central military figures in the Politburo who were purged in the fall
 of 1971.  The communique notes merely that the congress supported
 unspecified decisions and "all the corresponding measures" taken with
 .regard to these unnamed figures.
 While formally announcing the expulsion of Lin and Chen, the congress
 communique calls for continuation of the campaign of criticizing Lin
 and rectifying the style of work, using the Lin clique as a teacher
 by negative example.  This suggests that the cong:ess' main purpose
 was to dispose of the Lin affair at; the top ranks but that no new
 policy lines have been determined.  On the international front, the
 communique stresses the line on drawing wide support against "the
 hegemonism of the two superpowers," naming the United States ahead of
 *  In his last appearance, receiving two Chinese-American doctors on
 2 August, Mao was called merely "the leader" of the Chinese people.

 the Soviet Union.  In a striking reference to Sino-Soviet
 tension, the communique calls for vigilance in'particular
 against "surprise attacks by social imperialism."  Though the
 communique fails to use the formulation that Moscow's "social
 imperialism  represents a danger greater than old-line
 imperialism, such a reference to a possible Soviet strike
 reflects the Chineje leaders' fundamental suspicion toward
 Moscow.*
 Judging by the leader rankings given in the press communique's
 account of congress proceedings, Chou and his allies in a
 party-centered coalition have consolidated their power in the
 process of overcoming the Lin affair.  The communique lists a
 congress presidium of Mao as chairman, Chou: Wang, Kang Shang,
 Yeh Chien-ying, and Li Te-sheng as vice chairmen, and Chang;
 Chun-chiao as secretary general.  If the pattern of the ninth
 congress holds, this group will corm the new Politburo Standing
 Committee.  Chiang Ching and Yao Wen-;*uan, generally regarded
 as radical elements who may be the source of recent sniping at
 Chouist policies, are ranked {.n another group that might largely
 compose the remainder of the Politburo.  The two incumbent
 Politburo members who are military regional leaders, Hsu Shih-yu
 and Chen Hsi-lien, are included in this second-level group.
 The strength of Chou and his allies was demonstratively reflected
 in appearances during the course of the five-day congress.  On
 the second day, reports on the attendance of all of the active
 Peking-based Politburo members at an international table tennis
 tournament registered Chiang Ching's change in status.  In the
 live television coverage and the original NCNA report of the
 event,  Chiang was listed in her normal position ahead of Chou's
 close associate Yeh Chien-ying, but all the later reports reversed
 that order.  There had been two precedents for Yeh ranking ahead
 of Chiang, including one last March at a time when the leadership
 was evidently engaged in major deliberations.
 *  Sinkiang party chief Saifudin, who was elected a full member
 of the new Central Committee, was present at his Urumchi home
 base on the 26th for the opening of the region's trade union and
 women's congresses.  Speaking In that border area, Saifudin
 named "Soviet revisionism" ahead of "U.S. imperialism" and warned
 about the "aggressive nature of Soviet revisionist social
 imperialism."  His speech was carried in the. Sinkiang media.

 Midway in the congress, on the 26th, Peking signaled the political
 strength of Chou by resurrecting two former Politburo members who
 had fallen victim to the cultural revolution.                    Tan Chen-lin and
 Uianfu, the most important officials to be rehabilitated  since
 former secretary general Teng Hsiao-ping resurfaced last April as
 a vice premier, were named by NCNA as attending the table tennis
 tournament that day.  No titles were given for them in the NCNA
 report, but both were included in the list of full members of
 the new Central Committee elected at the congress.
 The return to grace of Tan, an agricultural specialist whose
 expertise must be welcome now, is the most dramatic testimony
 to Chou's ability to fill the leadership void created by the Lin
 affair with leaders who had been purged during the cultural
 revolution.  Reviled by name in the central media, Tan was
 accused of seeking to protect government offices from Red Guard
 attack.  According to Red Guard sources, Tan was attacked by
 Chiang Ching for "opposing the great proletarian cultural
 revolution and attempting to write off the achievements of the
 great proletarian cultural revolution."  The cultural revolution's
 achievements hardly figure in the 10th congress communique, which
 mentions that event only in noting that the new Central Committee
 includes "young comrades who newly joined the party" during- the
 cultural revolution.
 BACKGROUND     The ninth congress, meeting for over three weeks in
 April 1969, was announced on the day it opened, and
 an interim communique was issued two weeks into the proceedings to
 report that the new constitution and Lin's political report had been
 approved.  The constitution and the political report, delivered on
 the first day of the congress, were released on 27 April, three days
 after the congress closed.  The new Politburo was announced on
 28 April, the day when the new Central Committee held its first
 plenum.
 The eighth congress was held in two sessions, for two weeks in
 September 1956 and for two and a half weeks in May 1958.

 U S S R - C H I N A
 MOSCOW CONDEMNS "t'O GROUP" FOR TRYING TO SCUTTLE DETENTE
 Moscow's detente policy toward the West and Peking's vigorous
 effort to undercut it have brought the Sino-Soviet rivalry into
 sharper focus and wade the likelihood of significant improvement
 in their relations as remote as ever.  Brezhnev's gloomy
 assessment of Sino-Soviet relations in his 15 August Alma-Ata
 speech was sandwiched between two major PRAVDA articles under
 the authoritative byline "I. Aleksandrov" taking a sharply
 hostile approach to the China problem:  A 7 August article
 denounced the Chinese in connection with a forceful appeal for
 communist unity in the wake of the late-July Crimea conference:*
 and a 26 August article developed a lengthy bill of particulars
 to indict Peking on the counts of sabotaging detente and
 promoting neutralist sentiments regarding the Sino-Soviet conflict.
 As in the 7 August article, which also expressed concern over
 neutrality in the communist movement, the one on the 26th
 invoked the 1969 international party conference and its two
 predecessors in charging the Chinese with diverging from the
 "collectively" determined line of the communist movement.**
 The latest article reflected Soviet pique over Romania's
 determinedly independent stance, observing that the Chinese urge
 "individual" communist parties "at least to renounce criticism"
 of Peking and to assume a neutral position.  The article cited
 the April CPSU plenum as denouncing Peking for struggling
 against cohesion within the communist movement, and claimed that
 Peking's foreign policy reflects most clearly its rupture with
 "class and Marxist-Leninist positiors" in both theory and practice.
 Neither the second Aleksandrov article nor Brezhnev's 15 August
 speech cited peaceful coexistence as a basis for Sino-Soviet
 relations.    The 7 August article had cited the April plenum
 as having reconfirmed Moscow's desire for normal relations based
 on peaceful coexistence, though the published plenum resolution
 had not in fact done so.  Moscow is clearly having difficulty
 *  See the TRENDS of 8 August 1973, pages 1-3.
 **  Moscow's Warsaw Pact allies treated the second Aleksandrov
 article this month much as they did the first one.  Bulgaria,
 Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and Poland published the text of
 the article in their party dailies.  Hungary carried a shorter
 version.  Romania ignored both articles.

 defining its position on this matter. hoping to remove the
 ?              ideological dimension from the Sino-Soviet negotiations but
 hesitant about reading the PRC out of the ranks of social st
 states.
 The 26 August article incorporated in full Brezhnev's 15 August
 remarks on the admittedly stalemated Sino-.Soviet negotiations.
 Recalling that he had addressed this subject in Alma-Ata
 three years ago, Brezhnev put the blame squarely on the Chinese
 for the failure to achieve any "notable progress" toward
 improving state relattons.  He in effect demanded that the
 Chinese renounce their current policies toward the Soviet Union
 as the condition for an upturn in Sino-Soviet relations.  Fuxther
 spelling out the Soviet position, the 26 August PRAVDA article
 recalled that Moscow has repeatedly advanced "constructive"
 proposals on the border question and offered to conclude an
 agreement on nonuse of force more than two years ago.
 Brezhnev's somber glance back at the years of stalemate contrasts
 with the sanguine tone of his remarks in Alma-Ata three yevri ago.
 While acknowledging at that time that the border talks were
 "going slowl"," he did not blame the Chinese and instead stressed
 that Moscow is "not losing hope" and will "continue to display a
 constructive and patient approach" in the hope that the Chinese
 "will respond in the same way."  Deputy Foreign Minister Ilichev
 had arrived in Peking 13 days earlier to assume the post of
 chief Soviet negotiator at tha talks.  Similarly, Brezhnev's
 major conciliatory address in March 1972 had coincided with
 Ilichev's return to the Peking negotiations.  Brezhnev's latest
 speech, delivered at a time of T_lichev's absence from Peking,
 contained only a pro forma assertion that Moscow's readiness to
 normalize relations with Peking, combined with resolute struggle
 against "Maoism as a trend hostile to Leninism," remains
 unchanged.
 In addition to nriplifying the communique on the Criu_ea meeting,
 Moscow's current polemical offensive may be timed for the
 Chinese party congress as well as next month's Algiers conference
 of nonalined nations.   It may have been with an eye to the latter
 that the latest Aleksandrov article struck at Peking's efforts to
 identify with the third world against the superpowers.  The
 article also accused Peking itself of aspiring to become a nuclear
 superpower, and both the recent Chinese nuclear test and Mao's
 alleged 1957 remark about accepting the sacrifice of half of
 ?               mankind were invoked to portray the Chinese as addicted to war
 as a primary political instrument.

 29 AUGUST 1973
 In view of the widely anticipated Chinese congress, it may be
 significant that the 26 August article repeatedly referred to
 "Mao Tse-tung's group," an anathema formula introduced in the
 landmark 27 November 1966 P:RAVDA editorial article and justifying
 efforts to work within or outside China to overturn an illegimate
 faction.   lu an intriguingly curious citation of a Khrushchev-era
 document on Sino-Soviet relations, the latest. Aleksandrov article
 quoted a statement from the February 1964 CPSU plenum Lu the
 effect that Peking was virtually alining it.ielf with the
 reactionary elements of imperialism.  The article added that "this
 warning was not heeded in Peking."
 The February 1964 plenum statement on China had been delivered by
 Suslov, in a show of unity bohind Khrushchev, and was published
 belatedly seven weeks later.  During that period there was a
 further exchange of letters between the two sides involving
 Soviet proposals to renew the abortive bilateral talks held in
 July 1963 and to prepare for a new international party conference.
 Suslov's February 1964 report called for a new conference in
 order to undertake a "collective" effort to promote communist
 unity.  That an authoritative PRAVDA article now should recall
 as a "warning" the Suslov report's reference to Peking's
 convergence with "imperialism" may reflect a new effort by
 Moscow to probe Chinese leadership ranks for elements concerned
 that Peking may have gone too far toward antagonizing Moscow
 while moving closer to the West.  As Suslov had calmed China's
 alliance with the communist countries the guarantee of its
 advancement along the path of socialism, the Aleksandrov article
 pointed out that China's socialist development can be assured
 not along the path of struggle against the Soviet Union but in
 "alliance and fraternal cooperation" wicii it.
 Whatever alements tl'o Soviets might hope to sway toward a more
 balanced position between the Soviet Union and the United States,
 the Aleksandrov article's repeated citations of Chou En-lai in an
 unfavorable context suggest that the Chinese premier is not
 Moscow's man.,   Moscow is thus not likely to be reassured by the
 Chouist orientation of the CCP congress that was in secret session
 at the time of   he second Aleksandrov article.*

 INDOCHINA
 DRV COMMENTATOR LAUDS STRENGTH OF COMMUNIST FORCES IN SOUTH
 After a hiatus of almost a year, Hanoi media have carried two
 articles attributed to "Chien Thang" (Victor)--a pseudonym
 that ha, appeared periodically In the past in connection with
 some of Hanoi's most outspoken arguments for the 1972 communist
 offensive and its sharpest criticism of detente with the
 United States.  The current articles--published in the North
 Vietnamese army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN and broadcast by Hanoi
 radio on 18 and 25 August--appear to be arguing that a new
 military effort in South Vietnam "ould succeed.  They thus stand
 in marked contrast to the essentially temporizing comment since
 the January peace agreement, which suggested that Hanoi was
 preserving its options while strengthening its forces and
 evaluating the situation in the South.
 Since the provisions of the peace agreement which would have
 facilitated communist political gains in the South have not been
 implemented, it is not surprising that such a traditional
 proponent of decisive military action as Chien Thang should now
 be raising the question of eventually returning to a military
 confrontation.  It would appear that his two articles may open a
 new round of debate over policy rather than reflect an official
 decision.  The Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers Party (VWP)--
 which would be expected to ratify any major new program--is not
 known to have met in plenary session since the 20th plenum early in
 1972.  With the announcement that First Secretary Le Duan on
 28 August left Moscow for home after his si::-week vacation in the
 Soviet Union, the stage seems to be set for a leadership review of
 the post-agreement situation and the results of Le Duan's visits in
 Moscow and Peking as a necessary prelude to the adoption of a future
 course of action.
 Whf 1e the Chien Thang articles offered a pro forma pledge of
 determination to carry out the provisions of the Paris agreement
 and the 13 June joint communique, their main thrust was that the
 L3lance of forces in Indochina has shifted decisively and that the
 communists are in an advantageous position to achieve complete
 victory.  The commentator maintained that the forces in the South
 are already adequate to launch an important military effort:  "The
 southern revolution's forces in place (taij choox) now have
 sufficient strength to initiate developments of strategic signifi-
 cance."  Clearly assuming North Vietnam's continued military

 involvement in the South, he also asserted that the North has
 always played "an extremely important role" in the balance of
 forces "in the entire country," and added:  "Never before could
 the North's effect upon the revolution throughout the country
 develop as favorably as it is doing now."
 Chien Thang touched upon other questions which would figure
 in a Hanoi debate over its future course of action in the South.
 For example, he indirectly deprecated the importance of U.S.
 economic aid for the Nortb by noting that while some countries
 have been subverted by the bait of U.S. economic assistance,
 the Vietnamese could not be "seduced" by "riches."  He similarly
 seemed to downplay the role of assistance from Vietnam's
 communist allies:  acknowledging that past aid was "extremely
 important," he argued that the aid had to be used in Vietnamese
 conditions and that "our people's subjective effort was the
 most decisive factor."
 BACKGROUND     Chien Thang had been closely identified with the
 1972 communist offensive:  He signed an article
 published in QUAN DOI NHAN DAN and the party paper NHAN DAN on
 24 March 1972--six days before the offensive was launched--which
 set up Hanoi's rationale for the attacks, contending that the
 communists were in an advantageous position and that major
 battles by main forces were required to further alter the balance
 of forces.  After the offensive was launched, a 10 April 1972
 Hanoi report on the VWP 20th Plenum held earlier that year, made
 clear that the line pressed by Chien Thang was identical-with the
 view endorsed by the plenum.  As early as March 1971, Chien Thang
 had argued that conditions were ripe for communist attacks, and
 in   ? August 1971 article he had stressed the importance of the
 role of main force units.  His 13uspicions of the United States
 were reflected in a highly polemical article published a day later,
 on 3 August 1971, which responded to Peking's rapprochement with
 the United States with a comprehensive indictment of all who would
 moderate their "struggle" against the United States or shift the
 focus of that struggle from the "main enemy."
 Prior to Chien Thang's recent resurfacing, his last previous article
 was published on 22 September 1972 in both the army and party
 dailies.  In light of Hanoi's presentation of its comprehensive draft
 peace agreement to the United States at the secret Paris talks two
 weeks later, on 8 October, Chien Thang seemed to be arguing against

 any major concessions in the negotiations.       Warning against
 Nixon's "crafty diplomatic tricks" and putting the best possible
 face on the military situation, he contended that Saigon's army
 could not handle communist main-force attacks and that the U.S.
 air and naval forces would not be able to compensate for Saigon's
 earlier losses.*

 4 and 18 August 1971, and 12 January, 29 March, 12 April, 3 May,

 EAST-WEST                            RELATIONS
 MOSCOW ATTACKS DETENTE FOES. WARNS OF IDEOI OGICAL SUBVERSI,)N
 While drawing the lines of battle with Peking in terms calculated
 to portray the latter as pro-imperialist and anti-socialist,
 Moscow has been applying a similar tactic to sharpen the lines
 of ideologici,'_ struggle in the West.  Apparently believing that
 a divide and conquer strategy will help stem any erosion of
 ideological allegiance in a period of detente, as well as stiffen
 Ear* European support for its policies :ln the forthcoming rounds
 of .:ast-West. negotiations, Moscow has stepped up its attacks
 on alleged opponents of detente in the West.    In a series of
 commentaries over the past several. weeks, Moscow has projected
 an image of growin, reaction; in the West to the trend toward
 improved East-West relations.  At the same time, it has stressed
 the potential dang-rs of detente itself, warning that the c.nemies
 of socialism can cie it to undermine the socialist countries'
 vigilance and unity.
 EXTERNAL THREAT     In depicting the growth of reaction in the
 West, Moscow has employed a device made
 familiar during the years of Stalinist: repression,  In a virtual
 paraphrase of Stalin's dictum that the class struggle intensifies
 as the goal of socialism approaches, a commentator on the Moscow
 domestic service on 20 August explained:  "the deeper detente
 goes the more violent will be the resistance from the reactionary
 forces."  In this light, he went on to detail activities in the
 FRG over the past year which allegedly illustrated the efforts
 of the forces represented by such figures as Axe]. Ppringer and
 Franz Joseph Strauss to block the progress towar._ East-West
 detente.  Other familiar targets of Moscow's criticism hai?e been
 trotted out in other commentaries.  The German transmitter
 Deutsche Welle was attacked in a LITERARY GAZETTE article on
 15 August.  Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty came {n for sharp
 criticism in a Yuriy Zhukov commentary on Moscow domestic service
 on 18 August.  Even the new U.S. Secretary of Defense Schlesinger
 was given a critical profile in RED STAR on 18 August, although
 Moscow has refrained from attacking U.S. policy directly.
 Along with these familiar targets, Moscow has ati.acked what it
 describes as an upsurge of neo-fascism in the West.  In an
 article entitled "The Black International," carried in LITERARY
 GAZETTE on 15 August, author Ernst Henri described the emergence
 throughout Western Europe of reactionary terrorist organizations

 "stirred to fury" by detente.       Spiced with references to "execution
 squads," secret staffs nestled in Bavaria and the like, they article
 conveyed the imprc-ssion that such organizations threaten the
 political Fcability of Western Europe.   "Is it fortuitous,"
 the author asked, "that in recent months. . . reports on the
 wild attacks of new fascist bands are arriving almost continously
 from different countries of the capitalist world?"
 INTER'AL THREAT     Along with the crude attacks on the alleged
 foreign enemies of detente, Moscow has
 stressed the more subtle internal dangers posed by detente.
 It has pointedly warned against the theory, allegedly perpetrated
 by bourgeois ideologists, that detente signifies the onset of a
 new era in International relations in which class conflicts are
 superseded by world brother</div></div></div>  </div>
