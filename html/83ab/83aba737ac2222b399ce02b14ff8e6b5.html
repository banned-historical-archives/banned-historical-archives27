 The Director of Central Intelligence
 The President

 Washington, D.C.  20500
 Enclosed is a copy of my Annual Report to the Congress on the Intelligence
 Community for calendar year 1985.  This is the tenth such report-prepared for
 Congress as required by Senate Resolution 40U and House Resolution 658.  (U)
 For the last two years I have used the occasion of the report as a means
 to discuss the progress that has been made in rebuilding intelligence
 capabilities.  I have altered my emphasis slightly this year and focused on a
 set of intelligence issues and challenges, as well as on steps taken in
 anticipation of or response to significant events of the year.  I did this
 because I believe it is imperative for the Congress to have a clear
 understanding of the difficult questions that face the Intelligence
 Community.  (U)
 Through its discussion of substantive issues and developments, the report
 provides a reasonable measure of our abilities, and implies a sense of the
 value that the nation receives from its intelligence activities.  As I pointed
 out in my forwarding letter to the Congress, there is much that intelligence
 will be asked to do in the coming years, as the importance of informed
 decisionmaking rises in a period of fiscal constraints.  The Community will
 also face very complex problems, however, and its continued effectiveness will
 depend on sustained resource support.  (U)
 Respectfully yours,

 provides a reasonable measure of our abilities, and implies a sense of the
 value that the nation receives from its intelligence activities.  As I pointed
 out in my forwarding letter to the Congress, there is much that intelligence
 will be asked to do in the coining years, as the importance of infurmed
 decisionmaking rises in a period of fiscal constraints.  The Community will
 also face very complex problems, nowever, and its continued effectiveness will

 Enclosed is a copy of my 1985 Annual Report to the Congress.  The report
 provides a clear sense of the difficult issues and challenges that the
 Intelligence Community faces each day.  It also surveys the events and
 developments that were of principal interest to the Community-in 1985, and
 reviews the significant steps taken in anticipation or response.  (U)
 With the strong support of the Administration and the Congress, the
 Intelligence Community in recent years has been able to build a solid core of
 capabilities as it prepares for the problems of the future.  The complexitiy
 of the challenges that lie ahead should not be underestimated, however, and it
 is clear that exacting problems confront us.  There is much that intelligence
 will be asked to do, as the importance of informed decisionmaking rises in a
 period of limited resources.  (U)
 In an environment of fiscal constraints, our strategy will be to preserve
 and enrich our existing capabilities.  This means that hard choices must be
 made, and we will not be able to deal with the problems ahead without
 sustained resources.  The continued support of the Congress will oe essential
 if we are to continue to provide the best information possible to those who
 need it.  (U)

 INTRODUCTION
 This is my fifth annual report to the Congress as Director of Central Intelligence.
 In past years I have used this occasion as an opportunity to discuss the substantial prog-
 ress that has been made in rebuilding intelligence capabilities, progress that has only
 been possible with the cooperation and strong support of the Congress. My focus in this
 year's report, however, is slightly different. I have chosen to accent the difficult issues
 and problems that face the Intelligence Community, and to highlight the intelligence re-
 sponse to those problems and to the significant events of the past year. By so doing I
 hope to provide as clear an understanding as possible of what the Intelligence
 Community is about. I also believe that the discussion conveys an implicit measure of
 our abilities and a sense of the value that the nation receives from its intelligence activi-
 ties
 The increased resources allotted to the Intelligence Community have been carefully
 applied and the advances enabled by them have been essential. Impetus and force have
 been restored to capabilities that had atrophied, and a balance has been sought to help
 prepare the way for the challenges of the future. The Community's ability to answer
 consumer requirements has been strengthened, and in consequence its responsiveness
 to most requirements has been outstanding. As I pointed out last year, however, many
 gaps remain and the rebuilding job is not yet complete, a judgment that is borne out by
 even an elementary understanding of the complex environment in which intelligence
 must operate in the coming years.
 The difficulty of meeting the future, though, has been compounded by the
 straitened fiscal and funding circumstances that lie ahead. The choices that must be
 made are not easy. To help define the road that we will be obliged to take, I have re-
 cently completed work on a National Foreign Intelligence Strategy, copies of which
 have been provided to the appropriate Committees of Congress. The Strategy is
 intended to supply the strategic guidance needed to impart direction and priorities to
 intelligence programs. Without a sound and stable financial base, however, even the
 best strategy for intelligence will be unable to assure our ability to meet our nation's in-
 telligence needs. To secure that base, a heightened appreciation of the importance of in-
 telligence to the achievement of national objectives is necessary. This report, I believe,
 provides the kind of comprehensive awareness that should lead to such an apprecia-
 tion. When the nation has fewer resources to allocate, they must be allocated the more
 wisely. In great part that wisdom can be obtained through intelligence.
 The report is organized along the following lines:
 - A review of the significant events of 1985.
 - A brief consideration of the demands on intelligence.
 - A discussion of the intelligence response.
 - A discussion of major issues and challenges
 The Congressional Budget Justification Books, which have been forwarde-
 rately, address the Community's resource needs and programs in greater detail.  sea

 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF 1985
 Everyday, the Intelligence Community faces questions and problems that are
 posed in diverse contexts. World events, politics, personalities, economics, science and
 technology, military capabilities; these and other issues are all addressed in the effort to
 reduce uncertainty and meet the needs of decisionmakers. This section reviews the
 events of major interest to the United States during 1985 that had to be anticipated or
 responded to by the Intelligence Community; it illustrates both the scope and the
 complexity of the demands placed on the Community.n
 THE SOVIET UNION
 The accession of Mikhail Gorbachev was the most far-reaching event of the past
 year. A leader finally came to power in the Soviet Union whose tenure probably will be
 measured in years, not months. He has proven to be vigorous and imaginative on many
 fronts. Domestically, he has quickly consolidated his political base and taken various
 steps to revitalize an economy that has seriously weakened in recent years. He has
 sought to improve productivity by launching campaigns against alcoholism and lack of
 discipline in the work force, and corruption among government officials. The newest
 five-year plan calls for major new resource allocations directed at renovating Soviet in-
 dustrial capacity and transforming the society through massive infusions of high
 technology. Gorbachev has also brought new style and vigor to Soviet foreign policies.
 No major Soviet foreign policy positions have basically changed, but he accelerated the
 dialogue with the United States begun under Chernenko and decided quickly on a
 summit with President Reagan. Meanwhile, Gorbachev has caused Soviet policy to
 play all the more to world opinion, to try to get the United States to compromise on the
 Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), and to strongly support Marxist-Leninist and other
 clients in the Third World.
 Strategic Weapons
 In 1985, the Soviets began to deploy their first mobile ICBM, the road-mobile
 SS-25. This represents a major step in the Soviet program to replace by the mid-1990s
 almost all currently deployed intercontinental nuclear attack forces with new and
 improved systems. The Soviets also continued flight-testing of the SS-X-24 from its
 rail-mobile launcher and conducted follow-on programs for the SS-25, SS-X-24, and
 SS-18 ICBMs, all of which should have improved accuracy. greater throw weight
 potential, and possibly more warheads.
 In strategic naval forces, the Soviets began initial deployment of the Delta IV
 submarine, which carries the new and unique SS-N-23 missile, and will soon begin
 testing of an improved version of the SS-N-20 SLBM. These programs, combined with
 the strategic cruise missile programs (SS-NX-21 and SS-NX-24), will eventually result
 in a significantly improved submarine-based strategic strike force. These weapons
 developments are of even greater importance as the Soviets have registered improve-
 ments in submarine quieting. This and other submarine modernization programs will

 eventually result in replacement of the entire MIRVed Soviet SLBM force and
 deployment of much better nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines.
 In their air arm, the Soviets continued to make progress on the first major
 modernization since the 1960s of their heavy bomber force. With a new bomber and
 new land-attack cruise missiles, which are also in production, the Soviets will be able by
 the 1990s to increase substantially the number   warhe ds deliverable by aircraft.
 Strategic Defense and Counter-SDI Weapons
 During 1985 the Soviets introduced a new air defense fighter (the FLANKER) and
 a more mobile version of the SA-10 strategic surface-to-air missile. They will soon put
 an Airborne Warning and Control System into operation, and they have made progress
 in developing the technology they need for their own stealth (low observable) offensive
 and defensive capabilities. In other activity, the Soviets worked to replace operational
 ABM defenses around Moscow and continued construction on the new Large Phased-
 Array Radar network, including the radar at Kransnoyarsk. We believe this radar is in-
 tended for ballistic missile detection and tracking, not primarily for space tracking as
 the Soviets contend. Construction was continued on two large facilities at Dushanbe
 and Storozhevaya which, among other possibilities, could be ground-based laser
 antisatellite systems.
 Conventional Weapons
 The Soviets remained attentive to their conventional forces. They continued to
 modernize their already formidable Central Front forces, supplying precision-guided
 munitions, improved mobility, and increased sustainability; launched the first of a new
 class of large aircraft carriers and two new kinds of attack submarines; and increased
 deployed forces at their overseas base at Cam Ranh, Vietnam. The continuing Soviet
 presence in Afghanistan provided a window into the effectiveness of the Soviet
 military.
 The selection of a dynamic new leader in Moscow raised both hopes and fears in
 Eastern Europe that the Soviets will attempt to assert control more vigorously there,
 pushing for more effective use of resources and for leadership changes. Gorbachev's ac-
 cession to power also created concern in Western Europe that the image he is
 attempting to project of a man who understands and is sympathetic to that region's
 problems may succeed in driving new wedges between Western Europe and the United
 States. During the months prior to the November summit, Moscow made considerable
 effort to cultivate European support for its arms control policies, particularly its
 attempt to undermine the SDI. Nonetheless, by the end of the year the Soviets still had
 not overcome the effects of their failed war scare propaganda regarding intermediate
 nuclear forces (INF); and the Belgian Government, one of the major Soviet anti-INF
 targets, did not falter in its commitment to deploy GLCMs.

 Among other major developments of intelligence consequence in Europe last year
 was the mixed reception of SDI among West European allies. The allies are slowly com-
 ing around to participate in SDI research, but a number of West Europeans still harbor
 grave reservations about the project or oppose it outright. Increased terrorism was also
 a principal concern. The December massacres by Middle Eastern terrorists at the
 Vienna and Rome airports were but the latest manifestations of this problem. Also wor-
 risome were new indications of cooperation among terrorist groups based in West
 Germany, France, and Belgium. A final item of note was the reelection of Papandreou
 in Greece. Relations with the United States continued to be difficult, but economic and
 strategic considerations prompted Papandreou to become somewhat more cooperative
 and less anti-US in his rhetoric and actions.
 China's momentous "Second Revolution" continued as Deng Xiaoping made
 leadership changes in the Politburo and Central Committee that enhance prospects that
 the ambitious modernization programs will continue after he leaves the scene. The pace
 of reforms did slow somewhat during the year, however, as Deng coped with a large
 trade deficit and criticisms that modernization was contributing to high-level corrup-
 tion in China.
 The most significant development for the United States in the Third World was the
 continuing deterioration of the situation in the Philippines, as political, economic, and
 security conditions, exacerbated by President Marcos' declining health and various
 political manipulations, continued to worsen.
 In the Middle East, Libya's Qadhafi created sharply increasing troubles for
 Western interests. He raised tensions with the United States; actively supported
 international terrorist groups; and tried to subvert the post-Numeiri regime in Sudan,
 the Bourguiba regime in Tunisia, and President Mubarak in Egypt. Meanwhile, the
 Israeli-Arab peace process foundered, in part due to successful Syrian efforts to
 heighten the political risk for any potential Arab participant in real negotiations. In Su-
 dan, the regime brought to power by a coup was less supportive of US interests and
 more open to Libyan influence
 The Iran-Iraq war remained stalemated. Iraqi attacks on Iran's oil exporting
 facilities increased prospects, however, that the Iranians might eventually feel threat-
 ened enough to attempt widening the war by mounting air or terrorist attacks against
 those Persian Gulf states they perceived to be supporting Iraq. The US decision not to
 sell F- 15 aircraft to Saudi Arabia adversely affected our ties with the Saudis, while
 Oman and the United Arab Emirates established diplomatic relations with the Soviet
 Union, opening the possibility that Bahrain, Qatar, and possibly Saudi Arabia might
 follow suit.
 A rising cycle of violence developed in South Africa. The slow pace of reforms and
 the government's harsh response to the violence triggered economic sanctions by the
 United States and, other Western nations, and led to growing international isolation of
 the Botha regime.

 In India, the sweeping election victory of Rajiv Gandhi ushered in an era of
 renewed optimism and the possibility of closer ties with the West.
 Moreover, if Pakistan tests a device or produces weapons, India probably will respond
 in kind, creating the prospect of a nuclear arms race in South Asia.
 In Central America, the Sandinista government in Nicaragua continued to
 consolidate power domestically with substantial military and economic support from
 Cuba, the Soviet Bloc, and radical Arab states. At the same time fighting between the
 Sandinistas and the insurgents escalated, with neither side gaining significant advan-
 tage. Revolutionary violence in South America rose as Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and
 Colombia all suffered significant incidents of insurgency or terrorism. Some expanded
 cooperation among insurgent groups in different countries may be occurring, and some
 of the groups are receiving aid from such countries as Cuba and Libya. However,
 democracy in Latin America received a boost in March when, after two decades of mili-
 tary rule, a civilian president took office in Brazil.
 In a final Third World development of significance, the Soviets attempted to
 buttress client regimes-especially in Angola and Ethiopia-against increasingly effec-
 tive insurgencies. Soviet weapon shipments were massive, and Soviet military advisers
 played an increasingly prominent role in counterinsurgency campaigns in these two
 countries.
 GLOBAL ISSUES
 Terrorism. International terrorism intensified and remained a major concern.
 Iranian-sponsored or -encouraged Shia terrorism was coupled with a renewal of
 spectacular terrorist acts by radical Palestinians, encouraged by Libya and perhaps by
 Syria. US relations with Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab states were harmed, at least
 temporarily, by Israel's strike on PLO headquarters in Tunis and by the forceful US re-
 sponse to the Achille Lauro affair.
 Nuclear Proliferation. Although Pakistan moved closer to being able to produce a
 nuclear weapon, several positive events also occurred. The 1985 Non-Proliferation
 Treaty Review Conference reaffirmed the value of the Treaty, North Korea (a country
 of proliferation concern) signed the Treaty, and Argentina and Brazil began discussions
 about possible regional controls on nuclear technology.

 TOP SECRET
 Chemical Weapons Proliferation. The ability of several countries to produce
 chemical weapons expanded and their use became more prevalent. During the year,
 Iraq became the first country in history to use nerve agents against conventional
 military forces.
 Narcotics. Although some countries, such as Colombia, made at least temporary
 progress in curbing the production of home-grown narcotics, tremendous amounts of
 heroin, cocaine, and marijuana were trafficked last year internationally and into the
 United States. Narcotics money increasingly corrupted high-level officials in several
 governments (such as Mexico, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru) and was used to under-
 mine the social, economic, and political fabric of others.
 Economics. OPEC's efforts to hold the line on oil prices virtually collapsed.
 However, the "debt crisis" among LDCs deepened as the gains in trade evident in 1984
 generally were reversed and political leadership favoring austerity weakened in Mexico
 and Brazil. The politics and economics of US-Japanese trade relations also remained a
 significant concern

 DEMANDS ON INTELLIGENCE
 The role of intelligence is to support those charged with making decisions. The is-
 sues that concern decisionmakers and policymakers embrace a range of questions on
 topics as diverse as foreign policy, military capabilities, trade and agricultural policy,
 and military plans and operations; major demands stem from the need to be adequately
 informed about the meaning of events
 Certain issues immediately engage the attention of policymakers. This is typically
 the case in areas of current or impending crisis, such as Central America or the
 Philippines. It is also the case during the planning and implementation of major new
 initiatives, such as the resumption of nuclear and space talks. Moreover, in a world rid-
 dled with terrorist activities, political instability, threats of force, and civil or regional
 armed conflict, officials increasingly expect instant reporting and analysis of dynamic
 and potentially dangerous events to support military plans and operations and crisis
 management policy decisions.
 All intelligence disciplines have been affected by the demands of consumers for ad-
 ditional, more timely, and more detailed direct support to operations.
 Another trend is the tendency of consumers to demand ever more detailed
 information and analysis in support of issues involving international negotiations or
 programs such as the SDI. This tendency is strengthened by the growing interrelation-
 ship of events, which has fostered conditions where foreign policy issues and actions,
 for example, frequently have economic and technical dimensions and consequences.
 One result is an expansion of the burden on analysts; another is the requirement for
 more coordinated production across analytical units.
 Increasingly, policymakers also ask for assessments of intentions-such as those of
 the South African Government concerning apartheid-or for hard evidence of linkages
 that are suspected but difficult to establish-such as precise links between organiza-
 tions or nations and terrorist attacks, or the identity of a specific Soviet service
 responsible for a particular forgery or other active measure. The result is that analysts
 demand more and more from collection systems.
 Other demands placed on the Community proceed from the serious threats posed
 by activities such as terrorism and espionage. At a time when the presence and
 activities of hostile intelligence personnel are increasing and terrorist incidents and

 threats against Americans have escalated, counterintelligence and counterterrorism
 programs require considerable resources to identify and neutralize hostile actions.
 Real-time support for such incidents as the Achille Lauro is required to protect US per-
 sonnel and facilities, deflect potential incidents, Plan counter operations, and make
 informed decisions on commitments of US forces.
 In my last report I discussed some significant challenges that lie ahead. These
 challenges remain the source of compelling claims on the Community's attention. The
 need for collection systems to be responsive to competing priorities; the importance of
 applying new technologies to intelligence systems; the spread of technology worldwide,
 especially to communication systems; the efforts of the Soviets to deny us information;
 the evolving signals environment; and the opportunities and burdens of the informa-
 tion explosion are but a few examples of developments that demand creative and
 workable solutions. These solutions, moreover, must be sought in a fiscal and funding
 climate that is uncertain at best.

 THE INTELLIGENCE RESPONSE
 This section discusses significant Intelligence Community actions taken in re-
 sponse to the major events of 1985. The word "response," though, is misleading, as
 many of the studies, briefings, and reports produced were actually done in anticipation
 of events. Where appropriate, comments have been included on the attention which
 certain topics continue to receive, as well as on possible implications for the near term.
 Important shortfalls and deficiencies are also noted.
 THE SOVIET UNION
 Prior to and in the wake of the death of General Secretary Chernenko, the
 Intelligence Community was called on to assess the prospects of a succession, the
 nature of the process, who might be chosen, and what his likely future course would be.
 The Community further sought to provide analysis of the major issues facing Soviet
 leaders, their domestic and international options, and the policies they most likely
 would adopt
 Many national estimates and staff papers were produced in response to these and
 other questions. Two major National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) focused on domes-
 tic stresses on the Soviet system and Soviet strategic and political objectives in arms
 control in 1985. Other NIEs examined future prospects in Sino-Soviet relations, and
 Soviet policies in Afghanistan, southern Africa, the Middle East, and Central America.
 established a new division to consolidate work on Soviet domestic issues.
 The Intelligence Community anticipated accurately that Gorbachev would succeed
 Chernenko. Moreover, his policies toward the US and in major regional arenas were
 broadly anticipated, as was his more activist approach; there were no Soviet policy
 shocks or major surprises adverse to US interests. The Community could not antici ate
 the precise time of Chernenko's death                                       We
 also did not initially appreciate the speed with which Gorbachev would be able to act in
 replacing personnel and otherwise consolidating his position. With regard to future
 analysis, we have data and perspectives on a number of other key issues about which we
 remain uncertain. These include how much Gorbachev will actually be able to get out
 of the Soviet economy without major reform of the system, what paths he will take if
 his economic approach essentially fails, what the relationships will be between Soviet
 policies toward the United States and Soviet economic policies and other internal
 developments, how much Moscow will get out of its allies in support of its economic
 goals, and the particular tactics down the road that Moscow will adopt in the
 superpower competition and toward key regional actors.

 In the areas of Soviet strategic weapons evolution and developments in Soviet
 science and technology, the major focus this last year has been on examining the
 potential for the Soviets to produce military systems that could change the balance of
 power. During 1985, we published an important NIE on Soviet space programs, as well
 as an annual edition of Soviet Capabilities for Strategic Nuclear Conflict Through the
 Mid-1990s. Three major Interagency Intelligence Memoranda were produced on the
 subjects of Soviet civil defense, Soviet planning and capability for protracted nuclear
 war, and air defense of the USSR. In addition, a DCI Special Assessment on the Soviet
 ballistic missile defense program was prepared, and work was published on the
 significance of Soviet/Warsaw Pact military exercises.
 The deployment of the first Soviet land-based mobile ICBM, the SS-25, opened an
 era of greater emphasis on survivability and mobility that will mean significantly more
 difficulties in estimating the size and effectiveness of Soviet strategic forces and in
 monitoring Soviet compliance with treaty limitations.
 Soviet agreement early in the year to return to strategic arms talks with the US led
 to increasing demands for analysis and policy support, culminating in the support
 required for the President's November meeting with Gorbachev. Numerous back-
 ground papers were provided in advance of the summit, as well as quick analyses of
 current events that might affect it. We also used data bases and methodologies
 developed over the past few years to predict accurately the terms of the Soviet proposal
 for a 50-percent reduction in offensive forces and to assess its military implications. We
 continued to rely on virtually all collection systems to support analysis of these and
 other questions involving Soviet strategic systems.

 In the year to come, four science and technology (S&T) areas will command
 priority attention:
 - Strategic Defense and Counter-SDI Programs.
 - Antisubmarine Warfare.
 -Space Programs.
 Another subject of S&T interest is industrial modernization. To monitor progress
 here, we must continue to collect and analyze data on Soviet acquisition of technology
 in the areas of computers, microelectronics design and production, high-quality
 precision test equipment, and sensors (large optical and infrared array). The burgeoning
 availability of advanced technology for transfer to Communist countries will stretch
 our ability to monitor transfers of critical technologies.

 Substantial production also occurred during the year on Soviet general purpose
 forces. During 1985, the National Intelligence Council (NIC) completed its analysis of
 the global impact of Warsaw Pact theater forces capabilities and vulnerabilities. A
 series of regional threat assessments included an estimate of the threat opposite NATO
 and a companion interagency memorandum on Warsaw Pact theater forces, and
 estimates on the threat in the Persian Gulf and in the Far East. A study was published
 on Soviet strategy and capabilities for multitheater war, while our comprehensive
 review of Soviet naval strategy and programs was completely updated. Finally, five
 significant assessments were begun this winter: Soviet Military Production; The Soviet
 Response to a Conventional Defense Initiative; Soviet Foreign Military Assistance;
 Moscow's Home Front; and The Threat to US Mobilization. In their totality, these
 Community studies have had an important effect on the Joint Strategic Planning
 System, and all of those begun this winter are expected to have a significant impact on
 both policymaking and defense appropriations considerations.
 Also completed was an extremely important assessment of Soviet tank programs
 and most of the work on a companion piece on Soviet antiarmor programs to be
 published in 1986. In addition, a Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) on
 Soviet submarine warfare developments was produced. All these weaponry-related
 assessments have serious implications for US tactics, organizations, and future weap-
 ons systems acquisition. Many collection systems contributed to these assessments.
 Finally, a great deal of effort was expended on Communist arms transfers with im-
 portant results. For example, the support we provided policymakers in warning about
 and assessing the progress of recent Soviet deliveries of long-range SA-5 surface-to-air
 missiles to Libya typifies the kind of critical current intelligence needed on this subject.
 Our analysts also assessed the broader military and political impact of the large
 quantities of Soviet and other Communist and non-Communist arms delivered to
 Third World countries, and they have been increasingly called on to detect and provide
 timely information to help interdict the smuggling of arms to insurgent and terrorist
 groups.
 EUROPE
 The majority of 1985 production focused on European reactions to changes in the
 Soviet Union and on developments in Eastern Europe. For example, one 1985 NIE was
 Major NA TO Allies: Perspectives on the Soviet Union. Another important paper now un-
 der way is on Soviet-East European relations. In 1986, estimates will also be produced
 on several individual East European countries (Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia) that
 are facing important problems during the early phase of the Gorbachev era.

 Two events in the USSR-Gorbachev's accession to power and revived attention
 to economic reform-have potentially large implications for Eastern Europe. To assess
 these implications, CIA, for example, established a task force to examine Soviet-East
 European economic relationships, and continued efforts to develop standardized data
 bases on both economics and social elites, which should aid the identification of
 potential successors to aging East European leaders. However, limitations on our
 information about the detailed workings of East European political and economic
 systems forced us once again to make heavy use of outside sources,
 Other areas of production concerned Allied reaction to the SDI (Allied Science and
 Technology for the Strategic Defense Initiative), US-Greek relations in the wake of
 Papandreou's reelection, and Ceausesecu's problems in Romania. The Intelligence
 Community has also been at the forefront in developing good information about
 terrorist groups in Europe and in creating international links to combat terrorist
 activity. In 1986, two NIEs, one on the evolution of Italian foreign policy and another
 on Malta (which will look at its relationship with Libya), will examine the impact of ter-
 rorism.
 MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTH ASIA
 In 1985, the Intelligence Community devoted many collection and analytical assets
 to tracking the Middle East peace process, and a SNIE was produced on Syrian
 opposition to the process.
 LATIN AMERICA

 establishing a Marxist-Leninist state. But as Nicaragua has become increasingly hostile
 and the Cuban/Soviet presence there has increased, we have had to step up our
 collection and analytical effort. We have been partially successful, but still have a need
 for more information, especially with regard to tactical military intelligence on the
 Sandinista-Contra conflict. Clandestine reporting on Nicaragua improved in 1985, but
 we still need more and better reporting on internal developments. Cuban and
 Nicaraguan support of leftist revolutionary groups elsewhere in Central and South
 America has been difficult to trace, and we have found only a few cases of clear-cut evi-
 dence of their role, despite a considerable expenditure of intelligence resources to find
 such data.
 In the case of expanding revolutionary violence in South America, we still have
 major intelligence gaps, particularly on the degree to which Cuba and Libya may be
 supporting or encouraging the insurgent groups involved or whether it is essentially an
 independent, completely domestic phenomenon. We acquired some evidence that
 insurgents may be attempting to establish expanded contacts with narcotics traffickers.
 The growing Communist insurgency in the Philippines and President Marcos's
 decision late in the year to call for a snap election on 7 February 1986 required us to
 provide extensive current support to policymakers and has dramatically increased our
 need for in-depth knowledge. The demand for analysis on the Philippines was such that
 an interagency consultative group was formed to coordinate collection priorities and
 roduction goals. In addition. DIA and CIA separately created Philippine task forces.
 An in-depth assessment of the organization, goals, and tactics of the
 Communist Party of the Philippines/New People's Army; a SNIE on insurgent
 capabilities; and a case study of Communist infiltration tactics and government
 counterinsurgency efforts were produced. The succession to Marcos was also examined
 in detail, and several assessments and a SNIE were published.
 Increased collection and analytical resources clearly will be needed in the future to
 track and understand the magnitude and implications of China's modernization effort.

 In particular, China will require a healthy R&D program supported by an ability to ac-
 quire and assimilate foreign technology if modernization is to succeed. We will seek a
 clear view of the progress of reform in China and measures of the potential for
 successful developments in Chinese science and technology over the next 10-15 years.
 Also at issue will be the role of technology transfer in Chinese progress and the factors
 that will influence the development of US policy in this critical area.
 The increase in Soviet military and political involvement in Angola and Ethio-
 pia-an example of an apparent Soviet attempt to apply the "Brezhnev Doctrine" to
 Africa-is a high-priority item for collection and analysis by the Intelligence Commu-
 nity?
 We also devoted growing
 resources to following South Africa's involvement in the government-insurgent conflict
 in Angola. The possibility of a clash between South African and Soviet/Cuban forces is
 a particularly important subject.
 Government attitudes toward reducing apartheid, the pace of reforms, and the
 scope of domestic violence were additional South African subjects given close attention
 by the Intelligence Community. Continuing violence in South Africa has made that
 country's internal development and international actions a US national security issue
 and has led to a sharp rise in consumer requirements for both sophisticated research
 projects and current intelligence analysis. CIA, for example, reorganized its Africa
 Division to increase the resources devoted to southern African issues and increased its
 funding of external research projects and conferences. A comprehensive national
 estimate was also published detailing the prospects for stability, reform, and violence,
 while the internal strife affecting South Africa was addressed in three major studies that
 focused on such issues as black unity, rightwing strength, and the effect of the economic
 realities on political choices.
 In Sudan, we were occupied with the degree to which political changes there
 threaten US regional interests and the identification of opportunities opening up for
 subversion and terrorism by Libya.
 Estimates were produced on Mozambique, Sudan, the Soviets in southern Africa
 and in Angola, African famine, and South Africa in response to high-level policy debate
 and review. An estimate published on the Southwest Indian Ocean supported a policy
 paper, and an estimate on Liberia dealt with issues of intense policy interest at the bur-
 eau/regional level. The enormity of Africa's economic crisis was and continues to be a
 key intelligence issue. We have followed particularly the manner in which African
 regimes dispose of US aid and whether their use of the aid supports or undercuts our
 interests in the region.

 OTHER TOPICS
 Counterintelligence and Security. Actions to improve our capacity for safeguarding
 national security information and for identifying, neutralizing, or exploiting foreign
 intelligence collection activities accelerated in 1985. For example, in the counterintelli-
 Security countermeasures have also been consistently examined based upon
 experiences, study recommendations, or other authoritative direction. During 1985,
 these actions led to a variety of improvements. For example:

 Beginning in October, representatives of the counterintelligence and security
 elements of all the Community's agencies and departments participated in a series of
 hearings, sponsored by the SSCI, to determine how we might cope even more
 effectively with the hostile intelligence threat. A full report on the results of these
 hearings will be provided in the near future.
 Denial/Deception Analysis and Active Measures. The Intelligence Community
 continued in 1985 to increase response to both National Security Council and
 Congressional requirements for more analytical attention to the areas of intelligence
 denial and deception and Soviet active measures.
 Early Warning. The National Intelligence Officer for Warning fostered the
 development of new warning methodologies and programs with various US agencies
 and friendly foreign services. These programs are specifically directed at USCINC-
 EUR's continuing requirement for early warning of Soviet/Warsaw Pact intentions to
 launch an attack against Western Europe.
 To take advantage of new innovations in warning, the NIO/Warning also worked
 with various US agencies and foreign intelligence services to establish programs that
 will identify political and economic indicators of impending crises. To date the
 following programs have been initiated:

 International Terrorism. The surge in international terrorism in 1985-particularly
 in the Middle East-posed new challenges for intelligence analysts in providing
 products of maximum utility to US officials responsible for countering it.
 - Numerous analyses of terrorist issues were provided to the State Department's
 Office for Combating Terrorism and Emergency Planning. Many of them,
 particularly on the role of Libya and Iran and the threat posed by the Abu Nidal
 group and the Hizballah, were prepared to be passed to government official
 to support US
 initiatives for more international cooperation in counterterrorist measures.
 Within State, INR established a new office of terrorism and narcotics analysis
 to concentrate more efforts on the global issues and the increasing connection
 between the two.
 - Dispersal of Flashboard communications terminals and the DESIST informa-
 tion and communications system throughout the intelligence and policy com-
 munities has accelerated the process of sharing and evaluating terrorism
 information and the dissemination of analysis to a multitude of consumers
 during crises.
 Defense intelligence expanded terrorism analysis and production to develop
 counterterrorism options and support material; carried out antiterrorism and
 vulnerability studies of military installations worldwide; and increased physical
 security improvements and awareness programs, especially for personnel as-
 signed overseas.

 - In terms of prevention, we issued over 70 alerts of terrorist threats to US
 interests that resulted in deterrent action being taken. This is testimony to the
 extensive collection program maintained in 1985, and to the fact that liaison
 services have been increasingly responsive and are cooperating more than ever
 in technical and other operations.
 The terrorist target, however, remains an extremely difficult collection and analysis
 problem. Because of the nature of the target and the finite limits of our personnel
 strength, and notwithstanding planned increases in collection coverage, we cannot
 provide complete and comprehensive collection on the total terrorist threat. Our
 human collection capability is limited to selected incidents and concentration on highly
 active terrorist groups. We have continued to improve our data bases and the
 understanding and capability of selected foreign governments to defend against
 terrorist attacks. But indications of planning for specific operations, while more
 frequently obtained, are never comprehensive enough to deflect all planned operations,
 and key sponsoring groups remain elusive targets. Access for US sources is also
 extremely difficult to secure, and so we often cannot independently confirm the
 human-source information provided by friendly liaison services that make up the bulk
 of our reporting on terrorist plans.
 Chemical Weapons Proliferation. The topic of chemical weapons proliferation
 increased in importance over the past year. This is evident both from the perspective of
 increased Intelligence Community attention and devotion of analytical resources, as
 well as from an expansion of the interest Congress has shown on this high-priority is-
 sue. One indication of the prominence of the issue is the increased requirement for the
 production of national-level intelligence. To meet interest and demands for informa-
 tion, the National Intelligence Council produced an estimate, The Implications of
 Chemical Weapons Proliferation, that details the prospect for consummation of an
 effective global ban on chemical weapons, while identifying the nations which have or
 are developing an offensive chemical weapons capability.
 Intelligence Community organizations produced other timely and relevant studies,
 including a report on worldwide chemical warfare proliferation, an analytical perspec-
 tive on the Iraqi chemical weapons program, and an engineering analysis and estimate
 of Iraqi chemical warfare agent production capabilities.
 Drawing on intelligence analysis, US Military Commands were also briefed on the
 possible chemical weapons threat to forces that might participate in any operation in
 the Middle East. Special forces and related groups were made aware of the seriousness
 of operating in a contaminated environment and the degradation to efficiency that
 would result if exposed to chemical agents.

 Technology Transfer. Growing international awareness of the Soviet program to
 acquire illicitly and apply Western technology in military programs radically increased
 demands for intelligence support. We continued to improve our ability to collect
 intelligence on Soviet efforts to acquire high technology. As a result of our collection
 operations, demarches were made to several West European governments on their
 plans to sell such technology to the Soviet Bloc. In 1985, our special center dealing with
 this issue delivered almost 50 briefings to foreign officials, briefed major US defense
 contractors and foreign companies, and provided technical support for COCOM and
 bilateral negotiations. As a result of these efforts, liaison services became more
 cooperative, and, in several cases, unilaterally stopped diversions to the Soviets; US
 firms provided leads on potential diverters as well as on possible KGB and GRU
 operatives;
 The FBI, through its program to develop counterintelligence awareness, contacted
 more than 3,000 defense contractors in 1985 to alert them to the threat posed by hostile
 intelligence services, including the problems of illegal technology transfer. The overall
 problems posed by technology transfer, however, are such that additional resources are
 necessary to cope with the demands of maintaining and exploiting the data bases that
 make possible successful analysis and interdiction efforts.
 Narcotics. A national estimate was produced last year on the implications of the
 drug trade for US security. The NIC also initiated the development of narcotics
 intelligence collection strategies for Brazil and Belize, and formed an interagency
 working group to analyze financial intelligence on several key trafficking organizations.
 CIA was asked by policymakers to step up the number of narcotics crop estimates done
 each year, and responded by planning and conducting surveys in 14 countries in 1985;
 before 1982, estimates had focused mainly on Mexico and the Golden Triangle.
 Increasing national concern over the drug
 problem also led to increasing DoD involvement in antinarcotics efforts. In the past
 year Defense intelligence entities began providing direct support to those efforts
 There are serious gaps in our knowledge of the infrastructure of major trafficking
 networks, however, and several questions remain concerning countries of recent but
 growing importance in the drug trade such as India and the island nations of the eastern
 Caribbean. Collection and analysis on the linkages between narcotics and insurgents
 and terrorists remain a high i)riorityF-

 these improvements, collection of narcotics intelligence                     as been
 hampered by the growing sophistication of smuggling organizations, their family-
 dominated nature, and their tendency to operate in remote areas.
 International Economics and Trade. The Community responded to the crisis in
 OPEC with an estimate dealing with the impact of lower oil prices and looking at the
 political ramifications for oil-producing countries as well as the positive effects on
 world growth. As real oil prices continue to slide, the potential for political problems
 among producing countries will increase, making it important that we allocate
 resources in the future to be able to recognize potentially negative trends at an early
 stage.
 Weak commodity prices and subpar growth in the industrial countries were factors
 in the reemergence of the "debt crisis" as a major issue in 1985. These elements,
 coupled with the failure of many debtor countries to make economic adjustments at
 home, portend increasing difficulty for most debtors in keeping current with interest
 payments and providing for future growth in incomes. The Community completed an
 estimate in 1985 of the difficulties these countries face. The potential of these economic
 problems to spill over into the domestic political scene in countries such as Mexico will
 increase as the crisis drags on. Here, too, we are making sure that the proper resources
 are in place to detect signs of trouble that would affect US interests
 Industrial developments in foreign countries were additional areas that increased
 in importance, as they have had a significant impact on US competitive positions,
 particularly in the areas of biochemical engineering, optoelectronics, advanced materi-
 als, robotics, and semiconductors. Competition in commercial space services has also
 continued to increase, and near-term concerns have remained centered on launch
 services, satellite systems for communications, and remote sensing. It is expected that
 the need to apply added resources to such developments will grow in step with their in-
 creasing military and economic consequences.
 A final area that has grown in importance and that will bear new scrutiny is the role
 of international technology transfer in determining future technology levels and
 competition. One of the most important and least predictable factors influencing
 comparative technology levels and transfers will be the increased importance of
 corporate alliances, which may lead to a decline in technology gaps. Joint ventures of
 this kind are expected to extend into areas such as data processing and telecommunica-
 tions, in addition to longstanding joint programs in aerospace and nuclear technologies,
 with potentially significant implications for US positions.
 Support for Operational Forces. Support to operating forces continued to receive
 high priority, and a notable success occurred in the case of the Achille Lauro hijacking
 and the US response. However, significant work remains to be done, ranging from the

 need to deal with new analytical problems to a requirement for greater improvements
 in our ability to move intelligence to users in a timely fashion. At stake is the capacity
 to support war planning, war fighting, and special operations.
 Tailored Intelligence Support. Steps were taken to improve the concentration
 Efforts were also begun to upgrade significantly the quality and timeliness of target in-
 telligence support for the 1990s.
 In response to a directive from the Secretary of Defense, a multiyear effort was
 launched to improve contingency war-fighting capabilities on behalf of the US
 Southern Command, and a 20-man Caribbean Joint Intelligence Center was established
 in Key West to support the US Forces Caribbean (USFORCARIB). The Center will
 provide assistance in support of a variety of the Command's planning and operational
 missions. Additional intelligence support projects were approved for funding in the
 next fiscal year and beyond, which will further improve intelligence collection
 capabilities in the region.
 Considerable resources were expended to provide personnel and support to US
 Navy forces deployed in the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean in support of
 ongoing JCS contingency planning.
 Intelligence Data Bases. Growth in the Defense intelligence analytic data base
 and infrastructure in 1985, coupled with internal realignments, allowed broader and
 more sophisticated production. Particular emphasis was devoted to developing ade-
 quate data bases to support analyses at each level of military command. Automated
 data bases and analytical coverage associated with the Third World were improved and
 most core requirements of top-priority countries have now been filled.

 MAJOR ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
 There are other challenges and demands placed on the Intelligence Community
 that occur outside the context of significant or specific events. These generally involve
 questions that cut across the missions of individual Community agencies and that focus
 on matters of process or critical needs. Taken together they make up an agenda of issues
 and problems that must be considered as the Community acts to meet the nation's in-
 telligence needs. This section discusses the most important of these issues.
 The Intelligence Community does not exist apart from the men and women who do
 its work. In last year's report I noted the trends that will affect the Community's ability
 to fulfill its personnel requirements. The demand for highly skilled professionals in the
 context of competitive recruiting and retention circumstances has not lessened, but the
 constraints on our ability to offer the benefits necessary to compete continue to suggest
 a pessimistic outlook. The spread of technology throughout the world, the acquisition
 of complex collection systems, and the advent of more sophisticated analytical
 requirements and methodologies ensure that personnel pressures will remain a major
 concern
 There is wide Community concern over the possible effects of proposed changes in
 federal employment benefits. Given the lack of practical intelligence experience that
 characterizes those newly hired into the Community, the need to retain skilled
 personnel assumes great importance.
 THE INFORMATION EXPLOSION

 vocabulary and is in danger of being relegated to a stock phrase. But the problems it

 symbolizes and the implications it conveys remain very real. As I noted in my report
 last year, the key to solving those problems lies in improving our ability to derive intel-
 ligence from the vast amounts of data that are collected each day. The increases in
 available data stem from our creative use of technology; the improvements necessary to
 exploit that data will also be found in technology. We have made some progress, but
 have a very long way to go to develop the advanced processing techniques, expert
 automated systems, and sophisticated information handling necessary to do the job.
 The challenges associated with this problem do not rise from the acquisition of
 technologically complex collectors alone. Analytical requirements have also become
 more complex, and the collection environment itself has been altered.
 Volume management is a major problem now and will intensify. As the numbers of
 images acquired and signals on the air increase, selection of those with the highest po-
 tential for intelligence value becomes more difficult and more critical. Saturation of
 follow-on processing systems will result without front-end selection and filtering of
 extremely high-volume collection systems.
 Some gains have been made, though
 We have also made changes to processing that have increased our efficiency and
 continued modernization of collection systems worldwide to brin  state-of-the-art
 equipment to bear in especially thorn areas
 The FBI has also been faced with the need to deal with dramatic increases in the
 amount of available information, and is convinced that long-term improvement is
 possible through creative efforts to automate the process that feeds data into the
 system. The FBI has also combined into one data base various types of information in
 an effort that has led to an improved ability to handle information management needs
 in the field in the event of terrorist incidents or special events such as the Olympics, a
 world's fair, or a major political convention.
 In the area of open-source information, we have brought together through the
 HUMINT Committee the many elements in the Community that work on collection,
 translation, processing, and distribution of such material. As a result, we have a long-
 term program for better coordination and exploitation through fuller use of modern in-
 formation handling, processing, and delivery technologies. We now must devote the
 resources to implement the Community commitment to these improvements.

 THE CHANGING INTELLIGENCE ENVIRONMENT
 The pace of technological innovation and the demands placed on intelligence to
 broaden its coverage-in terms of both geography and topics of concern-have created
 an intelligence environment that is both complex and dynamic. This trend has been
 spurred by the increasing need for intelligence to be available on a near-instantaneous
 basis. The challenges that result reach to every area of intelligence-collection,
 processing, analysis, production, and dissemination.

 SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
 The spate of espionage cases in 1985 brought mounting recognition of the highly
 hostile human and technical penetration threat. It also served to reemphasize the
 inherent importance of security countermeasures in the defense of our nation's secrets,
 and underscored the value of strict compartmentation of sensitive information to
 mitigate losses. Security is a bedrock concern that demands unflagging awareness, strict
 attention to protective security disciplines, and aggressive counterintelligence efforts.
 Actions to improve our foreign counterintelligence program in recent years have
 yielded significant success.
 As previously noted, we have also taken steps to improve awareness of physical se-
 curity needs. For example, in 1985, in the area of physical security, the Defense
 Department conducted vulnerability assessments and surveys of Security Assistance
 Offices, Defense Attache Offices, and the Joint Special Operations Command Head-
 quarters. In another major step, use of the polygraph as a tool to improve personnel se-
 curity was extended. We will patiently continue efforts to try to develop greater
 understanding and acceptance of the polygraph as a means of detecting and deterring
 those who might jeopardize vital intelligence sources and methods. A new technical se-
 curity policy was approved for the conduct and coordination of technical surveillance
 countermeasures in federal departments and agencies. The importance of technical
 security was underscored by a Community Security Committee study of the last

 In spite of initiatives to improve various facets of our defensive posture, we
 continue to face formidable challenges to protect our interests from the activities of
 hostile intelligence services. Among the most effective ways to meet these challenges is
 to control the presence, travel, and activities of hostile intelligence officers in the
 United States. There are over 4,000 diplomatic and commercial officials from
 Communist countries currently posted in the United States. The Soviet Union and its
 East European allies account for over 2,500 of these officials,
 IIn addition
 to these o icia s, we can expect to see more than 15,000 students and approximately
 90,000 visitors from Communist countries each year. The trend over the past 10 years
 has been for these numbers to increase.
 Accordingly, the President, in NSDD-196 and other directives, has approved a
 range of measures to exercise improved control over these individuals and their
 activities, as well as to reduce the presence of foreign service nationals present in our
 diplomatic facilities overseas. Moreover, measures have been directed to increase the
 awareness of government employees to the hostile intelligence threat. NSDD-197 now
 requires each government agency to develop security awareness programs and to
 develop procedures for reporting of employee contacts with foreign nationals from
 specified countries.
 An NSC-chaired interagency task force has been formed to oversee the method,
 timing, and procedures for implementing these measures, as well as other counterintel-
 ligence and security improvements developed and forwarded through the SIG-I system.

 The SIG-I and its subordinate interagency groups for counterintelligence (IG/CI) and
 countermeasures (IG/CM) will continue to develop and coordinate the policy actions
 necessary to ensure the security and integrity of sensitive national activities.
 The several espionage cases in 1985 also showed that we need to tighten our
 personnel security procedures and to explore new methods to help identify potential
 spies and the behavioral factors that contribute to their actions. In this regard, the
 Community Security Committee sponsored a behavioral sciences symposium series for
 Community officers to discuss and refine proposals for research to enhance personnel
 security screening and selection. We also moved to provide advanced training to over
 200 Community and contractor security officers in adjudication of investigative data,
 construction and maintenance of secure facilities for sensitive information, and
 security education.
 Finally, the public compromise of classified intelligence continued unabated in
 1985. Seventy-four published unauthorized disclosures of intelligence sources and
 methods data were reported to the Security Committee, including disclosures of
 HUMINT, COMINT, ELINT, and imagery. Community officers briefed the Secretary
 of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the House Permanent Select Committee on
 Intelligence about the damaging effect of the compromises. We pressed for vigorous in-
 vestigation of these disclosures, but more remains to be done to stop the hemorrhage
 that is damaging our ability to collect and produce information essential to our national
 security
 After several years of markedly increased annual budgets that provided funds for
 much needed reconstruction of intelligence capabilities, the Community is moving into
 what gives every indication of being an era of very tight fiscal constraints. In real terms,
 the total NFIP Budget (after Gramm-Rudman-Hollings) declined by 1.6 percent from
 FY 1985 to FY 1986. And the President's NFIP budget request for FY 1987 is just un-
 der 3 percent above funding requested for FY 1986. Even without Gramm-Rudman-
 Hollings-the impact of which is still too early to assess completely-it appears
 inevitable that the Community is going to be faced with some very hard funding
 decisions.
 Fortunately, some of the very important and expensive collection and processing
 systems that the Community requires are already fully funded. Other important
 projects, however, are only partially funded or not yet funded at all.
 The National Foreign Intelligence Strategy recently provided to the Congress sets
 forth the basic course I believe we must follow:
 "Overall, we believe that the best course of action is a strategy that
 preserves and enriches existing Community capabilities at the expense of
 undertaking new requirements. The Intelligence Community must be pre-
 pared to stop doing some things and not to take on others."

 It is recognized that adapting to such a strategy will be far from easy. The world
 changes, new situations are created, new intelligence problems arise, and senior
 officials of our government expect intelligence support. But since the Community must
 adapt to what are expected to be severe limitations on new resources, it will have to as-
 sess its priorities carefully and focus its attention on what intelligence is truly important
 to US national security interests.
