 In Question                         tinue.
 I3rle fly Noted 000e,
 Pages 8-15 in PRESS
 COMMENT, 24 October,
 carry an article from the 24 October
 issue of THE NEW LEADER by the philoso-
 pher Sidney Hook, who helped organize
 the Dewey Commission which examined
 the Stalin purge trials in the 1930's.
 Hook says Russell's appeal is distin-
 guished by "the simplism of its thought
 and the virulence of its language,,match
 ing the crudest Communist propaganda
 leaflets."
 Also included in the same issue
 of PRESS COMMENT are two articles
 from the 15 October LE MONDE, Paris,
 headlined "Two judgments on the U. S.
 action in Vietnam."  One, by former
 member of the League of Nations Secre-
 tariat Florian de la Horbe, expresses
 "Thanks to the American Soldier" in
 its headline; the other, by Bertrand
 Russell, outlines further preparations
 for the "tribunal," whose panel of
 participants now allegedly includes
 the French Trotskyite mathematician
 Laurent Schwartz in addition to the
 other names identified in the unclas-
 sified attachment to BPG item #1053.
 (Russell's new list of panelists does
 not include Francois Mauriac, who had
 been cited in a Radio Moscow broadcast
 and at a 7 June press conference in
 London by Ralph Schoenman.)
 The basic guidance given in BPG
 item #1053 still stands, and has been
 amplified in Joint State-USIA Info-
 guide No. 67-6 sent as Airgram to all
 diplomatic missions on 15 September:
 "Under no circumstances do we want
 to give this scheme publicity, or to
 dignify it with official U.S. cogni-
 zance or reaction.... When or if
 Russell's 'tribunal' materializes,
 we want others to apply to it the
 local equivalent of the label 'Rus-
 sell's Folly.'"
 In addition to the above PRESS
 COMMENT items, the following mate-
 rial is presented for background use:
 1.   On 22 October the Bertrand
 Russell Peace Foundation issued a
 communique which said the "tribunal"
 would meet privately in London 13-16
 November to draw up plans and that
 the open sessions would be held in
 Paris next March.   Several sources
 have called it unlikely that the
 French Government will allow it to
 be held in Paris.   Alternate sites
 in Stockholm or Helsinki have been
 mentioned, but difficulties appear
 also involved there.
 2.  Communist propaganda support
 for the "tribunal" has not increased
 - with two notable exceptions.  An
 article in the 25 September BRATISLAVA
 PRAVDA reports that Czech writer Lad-
 islav Mnacko, who is in North Vietnam
 gathering material for a book, has of-
 fered to testify at the "tribunal" and
 that Russell has asked him to appear
 in Paris toward the end of January or
 the beginning of February.   The Buda-
 pest press on 15 October carries a
 HUNGARIAN NEWS AGENCY report of Rus-
 sell's LE MONDE article which, in an
 apparent effort to excuse Viet Cong

 and North Vietnamese terrorism,
 says it is "inconceivable" that the
 "tribunal" should equate acts of
 force committed by the presumed ag-
 gressor in the course of his aggres-
 sion w?th those committed by the
 "victims" in their "resistance"
 against that aggression.
 3.  Volume One of a "Black Book"
 entitled "The Biggest War Criminals

 July in Hanoi and Moscow by the Com-
 mittee to Denounce the War Crimes of
 the     . Henchmen of the U.S, Imperi-
 alists and Their Henchmen in South
 Vietnam, has been republished. by the
 North Vietnamese Consulate General
 in India as well as by other Commu-
 nist sources such as the WFDY and
 the WPC.  A "Publisher's Note" says
 it is "also being sent to the Inter-
 national Tribunal being set up by
 famous British Philosopher Earl
 Bertrand Russell for trying Johnson,
 McNamara, Rusk, etc., as war crimi-
 nals and it will form one of the
 prosecution documents."
 4.   A MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY
 (Egypt) dispatch on 14 October re-
 ported that three lawyers from Italy,
 France, and Germany had agreed to
 bring charges at the "tribunal"
 against the Shah of Iran as a "war
 criminal" helping the United States
 in Vietnam.
 5.  Radio Addis Ababa on 23 Sep-
 terpber quoted a spokesman of the
 Ethiopian Ministry of Information
 for the statement that Emperor Haile
 Selassie had never consented to have
 his name used as one of the sponsors
 for the "tribunal."
 Attached is an unclassified news-
 letter from Freedom House, a private
 organization in New York, containing
 a reply to Russell's appeal by Prof.
 Massimo Salvadori, which can be used
 as background.
 Great Leap     Pro-Peking Swiss CP
 Backwards!                                                                                Embarks On Its Own
 "Cultural Revolution"
 Attached is an unclas-
 sified translation of
 an article from the SWISS PRESS REVIEW
 AND NEWS REPORT which satirizes the
 abject breast-beating in the journal
 of the "Marxist-Leninist"' Communist
 Party of Switzerland.   It can be used
 by selected assets to show how effec-
 tively the Chicoms have been able to
 tighten the reins on one of their West
 European adherents which had been giv-
 ing recent signs of adopting the
 Rumanian path midway between Peking
 and Moscow.   (See Propagandists Guide #3)
 For audiences in Europe the charge
 by the Swiss CP that certain "fraternal
 parties" receive their directives from
 Moscow and "encouragement from the
 capitalists, from the Vatican, and
 from other bandits' lairs" can be cited
 as a good example of the ridiculous
 lengths to which the Communists are go-
 ing to accuse others when obviously
 guilty themselves of following foreign
 directives.  The earlier Swiss CP criti-
 cism of "luxurious Chinese embassies in
 Europe" can also be used against targets
 where local Communists live-in substand-
 ard conditions.
 Semantics       The Red Guards -- Or
 of Soviet       Are they?
 Propaganda
 An item in the Chrono-
 logy of World Communist
 Affairs in this BPG calls attention to
 'the difficulty the Soviets have had
 with -he title of Mao's youth organiza-
 tion, the "Red Guards."  In Russia, as
 generally in Europe, the "guards" have
 traditionally been elite military units,
 often responsible for guarding the lives
 of potentates, major public buildings,
 etc. (Eog    the Grenadier Guards, the
 Garde Republicaine,? the one-time Prussian

 Garderegimenter and so on.)  The
 Tsars had their Guards, and the Bol-
 sheviks adopted the term "guard" it
 this honorific sense, calling their,
 detachments of armed workers the '"Red
 Guard."  During World War II, the
 title of "Guard" was revived in the'
 Red Army for units which had parties
 cularly distinguished themselves in'
 battle.  Thus "Guards" or "Red Guards"
 are supposed to be terms of praise to
 Soviet citizens, who have been indoc-
 trinated on the glorious deeds associ.
 ated with these names.   The present
 Chinese Red Guards, however, are por-
 trayed in Soviet media as groups of
 unruly delinquents.   To avoid apply-
 ing the term of honor to these rowdies,
 the Soviets tried using the name
 "Okranniki," a word which means guards
 in'the sense of watchmen, and which re-
 calls the agents of the Czarist secret
 police who went by that name.   But this
 label is not too apt either.  As the
 Chronology notes, Soviet propagandists
 have finally adopted a Russianized pro-
 nunciation of the Chinese name "hung
 we,i,ping": to transliterate from the
 Soviet spelling, "Khunveibini."
 We need not share the Soviet con-
 cern about protecting the glory of the
 name "Red Guard"; indeed, we can ridi-
 cule it.   But to audiences for whom'
 the title of "guard" retains elite
 connotations, our output should avoid
 using such terms as "Guardsmen" for
 the Chinese teenage "rebels."
 Ruasian Writer      Ilya Ehrenberg
 Advises Sot         Criticizes Soviet
 Jol4rnalists        Press
 In a wide-ranging
 interview published
 in the October issue of SOVETSKAYA
 PECHAT (Soviet Press), Ilya Ehrenburg,
 well-known Soviet journalist and au-v'
 thor, sharply criticized the Soviet
 press.  Ehrenburg revealed that he
 spends an average of half an hour
 daily reading the Parisian daily,
 LE MONDE, and commented that he
 seldom spends as much time reading
 any Soviet newspaper.   He cautioned
 against copying the Western press,
 but was of the opinion that it might
 be useful to learn a few lessons from
 it.   He complained that Soviet news-
 papers do not cover many of the more
 interesting aspects of Soviet life,
 and blamed this on a lack of interest
 on the part of many Soviet journal-
 ists, and on the fact that too few de-
 mands are made on them to write con-
 cise, accurate, and above all, ---
 interesting     articles.   He also
 criticized the training of Soviet
 journalists offered at Moscow Uni-
 versity as not sufficiently ,stressing
 creative writing, and not giving the
 students enough practice in the every-
 day, practical side of journalism.
 Ehrenburg noted that too often Soviet
 correspondents report: inaccurately
 from foreign countries, overemphasiz-
 ing the gloomier aspects of life in
 the non-Communist countries, but not
 conveying a meaningful picture of
 political trends, the "class struggle,"
 and important cultural developments.
 Ehrenburg, who studied journalism in
 France, was Paris correspondent for
 IZVESTIYA in the 1930's and covered
 the Spanish Civil War for that paper,
 did not mention the deeper causes of
 his current observations, i.e., the
 (press) controls imposed by Communist
 regimes and the intimidations, dis-
 torted views, and "playing-it-safe"
 mentality which they have produced,
 nor did he refercto his own contri-
 butions in past years to the state
 of affairs with which he now takes
 issue.

 Money Taken       Seized Communist
 From Smugglers    Funds Given to
 Victims of Terrorism
 On 10 April 1965
 the Venezuelan Minister of Interior
 Gonzalo? Barrios announced the cap-
 ture of three Communist couriers
 who had been caught at the Caracas
 airport with a total of $330,000
 which they were carrying from Italy
 to the'Communist guerrillas in
 Venezula.   The ringleader of the
 group was Dr. Alessandro Beltramini,
 a prominent Italian Communist.
 (The Beltramini Affair was discussed
 in BPG #165 item 901 of 10 May
 1965.)
 own youth from stepping out of line.
 The "unorthodox" role (to say the
 least) of the Red Guards in China
 against the official party and Youth
 League undoubtedly also spurred
 these measures.  The measures taken
 are in the form of a decree dated
 16 September 1966 and published in
 the organ of the Supreme Soviet of
 the RSFSR, by which 3 new crimes
 have been added to the RSFSR Crimi-
 nal Code.   The crimes are:
 a) Spreading deliberately false
 fabrications harmful to the Soviet
 state and social order, made punish-
 able by up to three years imprison-
 ment;
 In disclosing this affair Gon-
 zalo Barrios stated that the captured
 funds would be used to aid the fami-
 lies of persons have been victims
 of Communist terrorism in Venezuela.
 On 9 September 1966 EL NACI:ONAL of
 Caracas carried an article announc-
 ing that the money taken from Bel-
 tramini and his cohorts has been
 distributed to some 218 persons in
 the form of housing, pensions, and
 grants.   A copy of the article is
 included as an unclassified attach-
 ment.   It provides a convient peg
 for recalling the Beltramini affair
 and for equating Communism with
 terrorism, pointing out the poetic
 justice of Communist funds being
 used to help rather than destroy
 people.
 Drawing the    Soviets Out to Nip

 b) Defacing the national emblem
 or flag, punishable by up to two
 years imprisonment;
 c) The organization or parti-
 cipation in group actions which
 violate the public order, punish-
 able by up to three years imprison-
 ment.
 Each one of the actions. de-
 scribed in the decree typifies acts
 which have been committed by youths
 in free world countries.   Soviet
 propaganda has given abundant cover-
 age of such acts in the U.S., as
 being typical of American attitudes
 towards the Vietnam War,   The Soviets
 have of course made no effort to
 balance the picture by pointing out
 that the large majority of American
 youth support the current U.S. poli-
 cies in Vietnam.  Nor do the Soviets
 assess these acts of dissent as
 refle-ting the great strength of a
 free society.  We do not draw atten-
 tion to such already highly-publicized
 acts in the U.S. Our main concern
 is to treat this new decree by rais-
 ing rhetorical questions about the
 incidence of such crimes in the USSR....

 For example:   Does the publication
 of this decree mean that the Soviets
 are having difficulty with large
 numbers of youth committing the
 new crimes? or, Does this mean that
 the Soviets expect a rash of such
 crimes to be committed?
 We may view the new decrees in
 the context of steps taken at the
 end of July, 1966 to curb "hooli-
 ganism," or flagrant violations of
 the peace.   The coincidental strength-
 ening of the police force adds teeth
 to the decrees toughening the penal
 code concerning hooliganism.   Hooli-
 ganism, it is worth pointing out,
 is usually an individual act.   The
 three new political crimes of the
 16 September decree represent a
 group action and therefore reflect
 a much more serious concern.   (See
 BPG item #1074 for treatment of
 the 16 September decree in a dif-
 ferent context.)

 Media Lines
 CULTURAL PURGE REDUCES CHICOM FOREIGN PROPAGANDA PUBLICATIONS.   In
 recent weeks late deliveries and non-deliveries have shown that there is
 a dhi;sruption in the publishing of Chicom foreign language propaganda
 publications.  The disruption probably stems fromz:a "purging" of the
 editors.;and staffs of these publications in the "cultural revolution"
 currently sweeping Communist China; the cultural revolution had previ-
 ously caused a drastic curtailment in Chicom domestic newspapers and
 periodicals.   (Media Lines, BPG 197 of 15 August, BPG 200 of 26 Septem-
 ber 1966)  The monthly, China Reconstructs, one of the best khown Chinese
 Communist propaganda magazines to circulate abroad, has not been seen
 since the July number.  Evergreen, a bi-monthly political magazine for
 youth and students, known for its "revolutionary" content, has apparently
 not been published since June.  China Pictorial, another monthly prestige
 magazine, did not mention the activities of the Red Guards in its August
 issue, the latest to appear abroad; the editing of this number must
 have coincided with the upsurge in Red Guard activity.  The omission
 may well have been due to the editors' doubts as to how to present the
 topic, since the Red Guards have met with hostility even inside China.
 Women of China, quarterly prestige journal, has:not appeared since
 April, presumably having no replacement for.its publisher and editor,
 Tung Pien, who is known to have been fired and who has been accused of
 "revisionism."  (Unclassified)

 ICM AND "SOCIALIST CAMP" AFFAIRS
 1.   The excessive words and actions of the Chinese "cultural revolution" (CR)
 (see below) draw increasingly sharp, voluminous critical reporting and denun-
 ciations from Soviet and other Communist world leaders and media, including
 even the heretofore reticent Poles -- though the hard-core fence-straddlers
 (notably the N. Vietnamese, N. Koreans, and Rumanians) maintain their silence
 on the revolution.   Although the Chinese try to counter with pages of articles
 alleging "worldwide endorsement," they can cite only relatively unknown or
 anonymous figures:   even the rabidly loyal Albanians are now avoiding the
 subject.   Soviet and other Communist media emphasize:   (a) the anti-Soviet
 bias;   (b) the use of Chinese non-Communist elements against Party organiza-
 tions and leaders;                         (c) irrationality, confusion and conflict among the Red
 Guards; and   (d) opposition by the Chinese Communists and by the people as a
 whole.   Chinese bellicosity toward the USSR/CPSU leads Czech Party daily
 RUDE PRAVO to declare that anti-Sovietism has become "the dominant" CPR foreign
 policy (Oct. 18).
 2.   The extent of Chinese isolation is starkly demonstrated when, for the
 first time in the regime's history, no important foreign dignitary attends the
 annual October 1 National Day anniversary of its founding.   Lin Piao drives
 the wedge further by blustering anti-CPSU remarks in his key speech, impel-
 ling the diplomats of the Warsaw Pact countries (except for Albania and Rumania)
 and Mongolia to walk out demonstratively.   The Japanese CP, once so militantly
 aligned with the Chinese but professing "independence" since early summer,(Nos.
 2-5), is now moved to criticize Chinese theories as well as actions (in con-
 nection with a new Chinese-line faction split from the JCP) (Sept 22).   And
 the formerly Chinese-sympathizing Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian
 Unity (PSIUP, an extreme leftwing splinter from the PSI), now criticizes the
 CCP's attacks on the USSR and declares itself "seeing eye to eye" with the
 CPSU.   (Sept. 28)
 3.   The CPSU makes another major effort to forge some sort of an anti-CCP
 bloc, or at least to achieve a joint declaration of condemnation -- but
 apparently in vain.   Following a series of bilateral Brezhnev meetings with
 the chiefs of the Bulgarian, Hungarian, Polish, and Yugoslav parties in the
 preceding weeks, the Soviet party and state invite (all?) the ruling parties
 to send top-level party-state delegations to Moscow.   Delegations come from
 all East European countries except Albania.  and from Cuba and Mongolia -- but
 (reportedly in the face of adamant Rumanian resistance) the only evident
 result is a TASS statement which says that they "exchanged opinions on a wide
 range of questions of international policy."   (Oct. 17-22).

 INTERNATIONAL FRON-IF ORGANIZATIONS
 4.   The International Organization of Journalists (IOJ) holds its 6th Congress
 in East Berlin (Oct. 1o-15), after the .111--China Journalist Association refuses
 to participate -- because IOJ has degenerated into a "despicable tool, con-
 trolled and manipulated by the Soviets (6).  With no dissenting voices present,
 the Congress smoothly follows the Soviet line -- as the Albanians charge in a
 slashing press attack (12).   (See also 3PG Item #1071)
 COMMUNIST CHINA
 5.   What's really happening in China becomes ever more difficult to determine
 amid a flow of reports (mostly sketchy and often of doubtful reliability)
 depicting a highly fluid and confused situation.   The grotesque adulation of
 Mao continues, and Lin Piao publicly ap~ea:rs more than ever his heir apparent-
 yet when a million and a half Red Guards are assembled. in Peking, on October
 18, their largest rally to date, Mao and Lain merely drive speedily past, wav-
 ing, but not speaking a word.   Could this be evidence that Lin had planned the
 show to intimidate strong behind-the-scenes opposition, but that the power
 struggle was at such a critical stage that he wouldn't risk a speech, as some
 analysts speculate?  The Red Guards' owh daily is reported as admitting (on
 Oct. ~0) lack of unity among the Guards and a "crucial., struggle between op-
 posing lines in the cultural revolution,"
 6.   Various reports during this period describe Red Guard posters as attacking
 more Party figures, now including the downgraded President Liu Shao-chi and
 his wife, Foreign Minister Chen Yi. (sub$equently reported withdrawn), and the
 First Secy of the Sinkiang Party Committee:   the "revolution" seems to enter
 a new phase as the Guards attack and detronstrate against the new Peking City
 Committee which was installed by the fist purge!   Opposition actions are
 also reported, including poster attackson Mao and Lin, posters lauding Liu
 (removed by the Guards and police), anti-Communist leaflets, explosions, riots,
 and a major, continuing, industrial strike in Peking.
 7.   The Chinese strike hard and. continuously at the Soviet party and state,
 both as part of and apart from the CR activities.  They hammer away on the
 old theme of Soviet-American collusion in articles pegged to President John-
 son's Oct. 7 speech and the prospect of',"peace talks," U.S. lifting of export
 restrictions of "non-strategic commodities," and Gromyko's talk: with Johnson,
 trumpeting shrilly that "even if both ale added together, they are no more than
 a couple of paper tigers!"  After Moscow orders departure of the Chinese stu-
 dents in the USSR in response to Chinesee suspension and expulsion of all
 foreign students in China, Peking officially protests "the unjustifiable
 decision unilaterally _suspending" their': study, and organizes new demonstra-
 tions at the Soviet Embassy.                   The Foreign Ministry note calls the Soviet
 action "another grave incident worsening Sino-Soviet relations" and publicly
 "warns" the Soviet leadership,referring,to it (in a Mao quote) as "the enemy."
 In what must be a new precedent for diplomatic usage, it screams:   "Let all
 monsters and demons tremble before our great proletarian cultural revolution
 and before the great Chinese people armed with Mao Tse-tung's thought!"   (22)

 8.   Russian-sourced press reports tell of Chinese demonstrations along the
 Soviet border and distribution of leaflets on the Soviet side calling for the
 return of the disputed territories; also of the strengthening of Soviet bor-
 der forces and of armed clashes.   (Oct. 2 & 5)
 9.   The Chinese also keep up their running battle with the Indonesian Govern-
 ment, with official protest notes on Sept. 30 and Oct. 18, and a number of
 NCNA releases.
 10.   Soviet leaders and media sharply increase the volume and tone of their
 coverage of Chinese developments, adding their own reporting and criticism
 as well as replaying all possible criticism by other parties.   They naturally
 emphasize the line that the CR has nothing in common with M-L, but is anti-
 Chinese-Communist as well as anti-Soviet.   They accuse the Chinese of trying
 to turn the Soviet people against the Soviet Party and government, while Sov-
 iet media are implicitly doing the same in reverse!
 11.   By way of preparation for the fruitless Moscow summit meeting, the Soviets
 not only held the Brezhnev consultations mentioned in para. 3, but also  (a)
 went out of their way to deny hegemonic intentions when extolling Brezhnev's
 talks (Sept 27);   (b) floated a "trial balloon" by featuring in PRAVDA a Suda-
 nese CP call for the convocation of a world Communist conference; and  (c)
 had Kosygin openly demand a "resolute rebuff" to the Chinese in the presence
 of visiting Gomulka (Oct 13).
 12.   While entertaining the new Indonesian regime's Foreign Minister Malik,
 the USSR encounters some Chinese-publicized criticism from the former Moscow
 correspondent of the Indonesian CP's daily HARIAN RAKJAT, now in Peking (5),
 and also from five presumably pro-Chinese I. students recently expelled from
 Lumumba U.  (l1).   Moscow again accuses Kenyan papers and Vice President Murumbi
 of vilifying the USSR (11).
 13.   In Europe, Moscow concludes a nuclear research cooperation and TV pro-
 gramlexchange agreement with Paris (1) and again pushes "European security" (8).
 14.   Internally, the 2nd anniversary of K's ouster passes unnoticed, but a new
 history textbook leaves him no longer an "unperson" (1).   Despite claims of a
 record grain harvest, there is no loosening of curbs on flour distribution
 imposed 3 years ago (23).
 15.   POLAND:   In a reversal of its previous reluctance to criticize the Chi-
 nese, the Polish Party lashes out in TRYBUNA LUDU on Sept 29 with one of the
 most effective (and quotable) across-the-board denunciations by any major
 party.   Meanwhile, although the 10th anniversary of the Polish-Soviet crisis

 27 September-24 October 1966
 WORLD COM   IST AFFAIRS
 CHRONOLOGY
 September 3 and continuing:      Soviet media engage in semantic acrobatics
 to avoid use of the term "Red Guards" (which has a very prestigious
 ring in the Communist lexicon) when referring to the rampaging Chinese
 youth vigilantes.  After initially using a straight translation of
 "RT' (and, in Russian, hesitantly trying out a blatant distortion ---
 "Krasnyye okhranniki" -- in which the word ''okhranniki" still has the
 old connotation of agents of the Tsarist secret political police), they
 finally settle in mid-September on an ingenious solution:  beginning
 with a prominent PRAVDA article on the 16th, they use a direct trans-
 literation from the Chinese rather than a translation -- "Khunveibini"
 in Cyrillic, or "Hung Weipings" in the Latin alphaheti   No other Com-
 munist media follow their lead, however.
 September 22 (delayed):  Two articles in Japanese CP daily AKAHATA
 denounce a new faction of pro-Chinese Communists who had arrogated
 leadership of the important Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee and control
 its newspaper CHOSHU SHINBUN.  The JCP/CC on September 5 approved the
 expulsion of "five important anti-Party elements, Fukuda, Koreseko,
 Sumioka, Obayashi, and Turuya," -- following which the purgees issued
 a statement on the 6th declaring the formation of a new "Yamaguchi Pre-
 fecture Committee of the JCP (left faction)" and "by forwarding CHOSHU
 6  NBUU to Party and democratic organizations throughout the nation,
 attempted to expand their anti-Party activities on a nationwide scale."
 The unsigned A editorial. denounces the "traitorous Fukuda-Harada
 faction" clearly though implicitly as a subversive instrument of the
 Chinese CP and reveals serious JCP concern about its possible success:
 "The F-H faction ... are modern dogmatists because they re-
 gard the views of a foreign Party as the sole dogmas and attempt
 to apply them mechanically to Japan.  They practice  left-wing
 opportunism in which struggle is replaced by empty revolutionary
 phrases, sectarianism, and demands for dissolving the Party....
 ...They have been appealing to the readers of the AKAHATA Sunday
 edition to stop subscribing to (A, which is) a bogus CP newspaper
 and instead read the CHOSHU SHINBUN ... saying 'you may subscribe
 to A as a counter-teacher, but you should not pay for it' ...
 causing confusion in deliveries and bill collection.  They also
 robbed more than 100,000 yen from the branch office...."
 The second A article signed by Fuha Tetsuzo replies at length to
 charges of "degradation of the JCP leadership toward revisionism" made
 by the dissidents.  First he rebuts their "theory of the American-
 Japanese--Soviet 'Holy Alliance? --  borrowed from the arguments of a
 certain foreign power," and their denunciation of the JCP for "orga-
 nizing an 'anti-China campaign.'"' Denying that the dissidents stand

 for true independence in the ICM, Tetsuzo cites CHOSHU SHINBUN's publi-
 cation on August 21+ of a speech at the "Welcoming Rally for the Cultural
 Delegation of Chinese Youth" by one'of the dissident clique, Sumioka,
 who "praised the thought of the Party leader of a certain foreign power
 as 'the highest peak of M-L in modern times' and admired him as the
 'guiding star of the world's people (which naturally includes the
 Japanese people)."'  (See previous reporting of the JCP's movement
 away from alignment with the CCP and denunciation of the earlier pro-
 Chinese dissident Shida faction, Nos. 2-5.)
 September 24 and continuing, throughout period:  Chinese media are over
 flowing with materials on various aspects of the "cultural revolution"
 (CR), the activities of the "Red Guards" (RG) and acclaim and love for
 Mao and the revolution by foreigners (mostly little-known or unnamed)
 as well as Chinese.  On the 27th, for example, NCNA cites praise from
 pro-Chinese Ceylonese Communists Sanmugathasan and De Silva, Burmese
 writer Daw Amah, "Denkichi Takeshita, the chairman of Aichi chapter of
 the Japan-China Friendship Association" and others; on the 28th, "an
 American friend" in a Hong Kong bookshop; on the 29th "General Wajih
 al-Madani, commander-in-chief of the Palestine Liberation Army," "a
 young Ghanian,'"Wbdullah Natepe, secretary of Zanzibar's Afro-Shirazi
 Party youth department," etc.  In a round-up of "expressions of bound-
 less ardent love and respect" by  the working people of Poland, Bul-
 garia, Hungary and the GDR" on the 30th, NCNA quotes only "a Polish
 composer," "a journalist in Western Poland," ? a retired worker" in
 Bulgaria, "a cultural worker" in Hungary, "a college student of the
 GDR," etc.  On October 1, NCNA again claims that, "despite the increas-
 ingly vicious attacks and slanders by the Soviet revisionist leading
 group against the CCP and Chairman Mao, the Soviet people show ever
 deeper love and respect for the great Chairman Mao and for the great
 thought of Mao Tse-tung":  here again they quote only "a teacher from
 Moscow," "a young student from Georgia," etc.
 September 27 and continuing throughout period:  Soviet and other Bloc
 media increasingly report in a critical vein on the Chinese CR, depict-
 ing not only the adulation of Mao and the violence of Red Guard actions
 but also their anti-Soviet bias, their threat to CCP organs and leaders,
 and opposition by Chinese Communists and the people.  On the 27th, for
 example, IZVESTIYA carries a Peking dispatch describing attacks on Hua
 Lo-keng, Chairman of the Chinese Mathematical Society:
 "...This scientist, whose works are known to all mathematicians
 in the world, is being called a reactionary bourgeois  authority.
 The mathematician is accused of having opposed the ideas of Chair-
 man Mao and of having at one time called the great leap forward
 hurried and divorced from real life....  They charge him with hav-
 ing praised the achievements of the Soviet Union in the conquest
 of space."
 On the same day, TASS reports from Peking that "the 'cultural
 revolution' in China has touched almost all of the Chinese press.

 Many newspapers and magazines have been closed, others renamed, and
 editorial offices of a number of publications reorganized."  And another
 TASS Peking bulletin that day describes PEOPLE'S DAILY newest glori-
 fication of Mao and miscellaneous leaflets circulated by the Hung
 Weipings (TASS's English version).  Yugoslav TANYUG reporting on the
 27th is slightly more "alarmist" (as is often the case):  it sees in a
 Peking poster confirmation that "the formation of so-called interna-
 tional Red Guard detachments with headquarters in Peking has begun"
 and finds in the latest Anna Louise Strong newsletter confirmation of
 "the information that military drilling of the Red Guard has already
 begun and that in a few days ... some detachments of the Red Guard
 will be armed."
 September 27:  In an article extolling CPSU chief Brezhnev's September
 visits with the CP leaders in Bulgaria, Hungary and Yugoslavia as
 strengthening relations, IZVESTIYA denies Soviet hegemonic ambitions
 and implicitly attributes same to the Chinese.
 September 27-October 1:  East German boss Ulbricht visits Tito in Bel-
 grade and Brioni:  the communique on the 1st declares "concurrence of
 viewpoints on the most important international problems" but only an
 "exchange of views" on problems of the ICM.
 September 28:  Hungarian Party daily NEPSZABADSAG interviews SecyGen
 Vecchietti of the (extreme leftwing, "anti-revisionist") Italian
 Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity (PSIUP):  according to Budapest
 MTI in English, he says that the PSIUP "sees eye to eye" with the CPSU
 and the Hungarian CP on "the more important problems" of the interna-
 tional situation and the ICM and "voiced concern over the CCP leaders'
 attacks against the Soviet Union, declaring that they were disrupting
 the unity of the international working class movement and thereby
 obstructing all parties, including his party."
 Cuban boss Castro again manifests concern over the problem of
 material versus moral incentives as a focal point of contention in his
 regime, implying that Cuba's "old" Communists oppose his emphasis on
 moral stimuli and prefer to use "the sign of the peso" to spur produc-
 tion.
 September 29:  A long NCNA review of "the present situation of the
 struggle of M-Ls and revolutionary people throughout the world against
 imperialism, reaction, and modern revisionism" finds it "excellent."
 NCNA again denounces the CPSU leaders for "betraying M-L and capitula-
 ting to U.S. imperialism," and for forming "a new holy alliance against
 Communism, against the people, against revolution, and against China."
 However, "the modern revisionist clique is today torn by contradictions
 and disunity" and is "nothing more than a feeble paper tiger."  Another
 NCNA story on Chinese material successes states that "a new situation,
 an all-round leap forward, is now in the making on the industrial front."

 A long "Victory Depends on Unity" editorial in Polish Party daily
 TRYBUNA LUDU sternly condemns the CPR for "categorically rejecting" all
 Soviet unity proposals, "using a whole arsenal of unsavory slanders and
 accusations" of ""betrayal'; "conspiracy," etc.:
 "The anti-unity scissionist political line of the CCP, the
 staging of hostile demonstrations in front of the Soviet Embassy
 and diplomatic missions of other socialist countries, the pro-
 clamation by the 11th plenum of the CCP/CC of the so-called 'pro-
 letarian cultural revolution' and a call to 'open fire'on 'those
 who are in power' who march along the road of 'revisionism' and
 'capitalism which is 'contrary to the ideas of Mao Tse-tung,'
 the assaults on party and state activists and the programs carried
 out by the so-called Red Guards on party committees suspected of
 'revisionism,' various brawling excesses of unfledged school
 youth compromising the idea of socialism -- all that provokes deep
 concern and revulsion within the ranks of all Communist and workers
 parties which see in the conduct of the leading organs of the CCP
 a betrayal of the principles of proletarian internationalism and
 of the ideology of the Communist movement."
 The editorial quotes at length from Chen Yi's September 7 remarks
 to Japanese MPs (#6) to turn the "collaboration" accusation implicitly
 against the Chinese, using a quote attributed to APP:  "Chen Yi obviously
 confirms the opinion of numerous observers that China sharpens its
 conflict with the Soviet Union in order to prepare ground for direct
 talks with the U.S. Government."
 Bulgarian Party daily RABOTNICHESKO DELO editorial on the same
 day charges that Chinese opposition to Soviet unity efforts "borders
 on treachery to the Just struggle of the Vietnamese people."
 Radio Moscow reports that Brezhnev and CPUSA GenSecy Gus Hall on
 the 28th held long talks which "showed full coincidence of views of
 both parties on all the principal questions of the present time."
 October 1: At Peking's celebration of the CPR's 17th anniversary there
 are,for the first time, no important foreign dignitaries present (the
 top-ranking guest listed was the president of the Somali National
 Assembly), no party-to-party greetings from Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria,
 Hungary or Poland, and only pro forma congratulations from other Com-
 munist states.  Lin Piao shares the center of the stage with Mao Tse-
 t     both "in buoyant spirits and smiling broadly, waving greetings"
 to "the biggest parade since the founding of new China."  Chinese
 pronouncements are largely concerned with the internal problems of the
 cultural revolution," but keynoter Lin includes the following blasts
 at the CPSU:

 the GDR, Hungary, Mongolia and Poland walk out in protest.
 French Minister of Scientific Research and Atom and Space ques-

 tron-volt accelerator under construction near Moscow.
 Hanoi broadcasts an editorial from the September HOC TAP [North
 Vietnamese journal of doctrine] which admits inadequacies in the Party's
 "theory-formulating task" and says that a new "theory-formulating"
 committee and program have been established.
 UPI reports from Moscow on the publication of a new history text-
 book which gives Khrushchev credit for his role in the historic 20th,
 21st and 22nd Party Congresses and as instigator of the post Stalin
 reforms.  Together with a recent one-volume history of WWII, it is
 "seen here by qualified observers as an attempt to be less emotional
 and more objective about fallen or discredited leaders."
 October 2:  Soviet Defense Ministry's daily KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star)
 reports that Soviet missile specialists at sites in North Vietnam had
 come under attack during U.S. bombing raids.
 October 2 and 23,:  AP Moscow cites "Russian sources" for an Oct. 2
 report that Chinese Communists have staged demonstrations along the
 Sino-Soviet border and distributed leaflets on the Soviet side calling
 for return of the disputed territories to China.  "The sources said
 there had been no armed clashes between Soviet and Chinese troops,
 although they mentioned Soviet gunboats on the Amur River being fired
 upon."  A London OBSERVER article on the same day "by our Foreign Staff"
 states that "clashes between Soviet and Chinese troops have been taking
 place this summer along the southernmost part of the 6,100-mile border
 between the two."  It cites "travellers' reports from Russia and
 Afghanistan" saying that the clashes have been described locally as
 'quite serious."  "Soviet soldiers wounded in the fighting have been
 seen getting an enthusiastic welcome on the streets of Dushambe, capi-

 "The Khunveibini directly aim at displacing old cadres.  How
 can this be explained?  Only that the old cadres learned from
 the experience of the Great October Socialist Revolution and do
 not accept the anti-Soviet slander of the Khunveibini.  Is it not
 because these people have drawn their ideas of M-L from prime

 by the narrowness'" of the regime's handling of the 10th anniversary of

 1070.                        THE DEVELOPMENT OF
 COMMUNIST CHINA'S CULTURAL REVOLUTION
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:    Communist China seems today a country gone berserk, its
 ordinary citizens caught up in a bewildering whirlpool of Red Guard terror
 and intimidation supported by the old men in Peking.   Since August
 the Red Guard   has acted as Mao's primary tool in the spreading of the
 cultural revolution, from the first attacks on the intellectuals, ancient
 traditions, religion, and the West to attacks on all things foreign and
 finally to the calculated weeding out of Chinese Communist Party officials
 whose revolutionary fervor did not measure up to Mao's fanatic devotion.
 The first Red Guards were handpicked in July by Central Committee re-
 presentatives from schools throughout the country where the purging of
 teachers had already taken place.  As July moved into August and recruit-
 ing became less selective and more intensive, the Guard established branches
 in production brigades, schools, commercial departments, factories, etc.,
 until by September their numbers were estimated at between eight and twelve
 million.
 The most commonly held theory is that they were invented and at first
 controlled by the Central Committee of the CCP, with Mao Tse-tung and his
 heir-apparent Marshal Lin Piao pulling the strings.   The Red Guard not
 only proved a less than perfect instrument for refurbishing Chinese Commu-
 nism, it turned into a Frankenstein carrying out its assigned tasks with
 such unholy fervor that even Chairman Mao may have been taken aback. Sig-
 nificantly, the public rallies at the Gate of Heavenly Peace on 31 August
 and 15 September sought to incite the Guards to attack "those in the Party
 who are taking the capitalist road," but maintained that these were only
 a minority in the party.   By early September word had filtered out of China
 regarding the assignment of leading officers of the Peoples' Liberation Army
 (PLA) to instruct, supervise and discipline the Guards.   Other reports that
 the PLA had been used to quell Red Guard disturbances seeped through to
 watchers in Hong Kong; in one case at least the PLA had been called in by
 local officials unable to cope with the Guards.   These efforts at restoring
 order and discipline - a belated attempt on the part of an aging dictator
 to consolidate his hold on 750 million Chinese and ensure his immortality

 in the person of a chosen successor- were too long delayed.   By the
 beginning of September too many emotionally charged stories had reached
 the outside world of Red Guard excesses - their desecration of Buddhist
 temples, their eviction of eight frail nuns from China, their book burn-
 ing and destruction of priceless art works from China's past, their beat-
 ing of elderly citizens and frenzie. attacks on foreigners and so on - a
 disgusting and terrifying list which the press is circulating to the far
 corners of the globe.
 What is actually behind the cultural revolution - Mao's obsession
 with revisionist tendencies in Chin, or whatever - is less important
 today for our propaganda purposes than the electrifying effect the re-
 volution is having on the outside world, and the growth of resistance
 to its excesses inside China.   Rumots of fierce clashes between the
 Guards and anti-Guard elements, protest groups, anti-wall poster cam-
 paigns, suicides of prominent educators, scientists, and artists, have
 gradually added to our picture of resistance within China.   One of the
 surest indicators of the changes being crammed down Chinese throats is
 the reduced living scales among Chitese diplomats and officials abroad.
 They have been ordered to master their weakness for bourgeois delights
 such as Mercedes automobiles and British gin and are now shoring up
 their resolve with pictures of Mao supplanting art treasures and replac-
 ing fashionable clothes and haircuts with the ubiquitous baggy trouser,
 simple dress and bowl haircut of yesteryear.  Western diplomats and
 others have heard a certain amount 6f-grumbling from the less tight-
 lipped Chinese because of their reduced salaries and newly-limited re-
 presentational funds..  It has been speculated that morale problems can
 be and are developing.
 At the outset of the cultural revolution, it was to be expected
 that Chinas Asian neighbors would take notice of what was going on
 so close to their back yards and that anti-communist countries would
 immediately begin commenting on Chiiia's newest convulsion.   However,
 as the purge widened to include traditional institutions, Moslem and
 Buddhist countries or groups representing them began their protests
 as did Western Europe and Latin America.   Finally as the purge reached
 Chinese Communist Party officials aid government officials and expanded
 to demote or remove CCP committees in local factories, educational in-
 stitutions, etc., the communist world began to react.   From. communist
 party organs in Eastern and Western; Europe, from Latin America, from
 the Near and Far East came rumbling, protests, criticism and even ridi-
 cule of the CCP and the Red Guard. Leading the communist hue and cry was
 the powerful central organ of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
 (see unclassified attachment for rojindups of worldwide criticism from
 communist and non-communist countries).   There have even been signs that
 the most sycophantic of Peking's er$twhile followers, the Albanians, are
 having second thoughts as may be the North Vietnamese (see Zorza article
 attached).

 Further evidence of China's growing isolation was the lackluster
 turnout of foreign guests at China's National Day Celebrations on
 1 October and the walkout of diplomats from seven communist countries
 when speechmaker Lin Piao tactlessly dragged out the dog-eared accusa-
 tion that the USSR is conspiring with the US on Vietnam (see attach-
 ment).   Bulgarian leader Zhivkov and Czech leader Novotny both con-
 demned China on 9 September in speeches in Sofia; a well-known
 Yugoslavian writer and former diplomat pointed out that "China's
 political influence in international affairs has sunk to the lowest
 possible point."  Major articles in Western European,communst papers
 (see Press Comment  for past month) rail at the CCP for setting back
 the advance of communism and completely excising Marx and Lenin from
 the revolutionary scene.
 Two aspects of the cultural revolution are particularly disturb-
 ing to communists outside China.  One of these is the spectacle of
 Communist party leaders being attacked by elements which stand, in
 effect, outside the party.  Probably few East European and other
 apparatchiki would welcome a return to the purges of the Stalin era,
 but at least those purges were conducted within the framework of the
 party; adroit party officials could follow the changing party lines
 and attack whatever elements were newly tagged as "anti-party" and
 "deviationist."  The party as such remained supreme.  In today's China,
 on the other hand, the Red Guards, despite their official origin, seem
 to represent a force standing in fact outside the party; insofar as
 they are controlled from above, this control seems to come through
 the PLA and not through party cadres, and indeed the Guards have aimed
 many of their attacks at local and regional party headquarters.  Both
 the mobilization of the army against the party and the mobilization of
 youth against old party officials are anathema to the other CPs.
 The other aspect of the cultural revolution which disturbs com-
 munists is that there is no longer much pretext of following the doc-
 trines of Marx and Lenin.  Instead, this peculiar revolution concentrates
 on lauding the "thought of Chairman Mao."  Mao's thoughts are claimed to
 work wonders in solving everyday problems, such as those of harvesting
 or the garment industry.   Chicom indoctrination seems to aim at making
 "Mao say" replace the old stereotype of "Confucius say..."  To communists
 outside the Middle Kingdom, this movement seems to resemble fascism more
 than communism.. Like Mussolini, Mao (in Chicom propaganda) is "always
 right."  Non-Chinese communists are concluding that, as Mussolini once
 said of fascism, the cultural revolution is "not an article for export."   25X1C10 b

 1071.               FRONT ACTIVITIES:   I.O.J. CONGRESS
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:   The Communist-front International Organization of Jour-
 nalists  IOJ  held its 6th Congress in East Berlin, 10-15 October 1966,
 attended by more than 200"de.legates"from 42 countries.   The IOJ is less
 important organizationally than the mass membership fronts in the fields
 of youth (WFDY), students (IUS), labor (WFTU), and women (WIDF).   How-
 ever, its more limited number of journalist adherents exert considerable
 influence on public opinion.
 Available reports indicate that the Congress was carried off in a
 rather harmonious atmosphere, probably much more harmonious than any
 international front gathering  in recent years.   Ideological charges
 were directed at the West (principally the U.S. and West Germany),
 rather than at representatives of one or another brand of Communism.
 The reasons for the harmony at the Congress were that it was boycotted
 by the Chicoms and Albanians and that a Peking-based Indonesian delega-
 tion was refused admission.
 Chicom Charges.   In advance of the Congress, on 6 October, the All-
 China Journalists' Association declared its refusal to participate.  The
 statement harshly condemned the IOJ as a Soviet-controlled, Soviet-
 manipulated instrument "tailing behind U.S. imperialism and its accom-
 plices"; as violently opposed to the revolutionary struggle in Asia,
 Africa and Latin America; as helping to peddle U.S. imperialism's
 "peace talks" fraud; as preaching "united action" with U.S. imperialism
 against China; as pleading for cooperation with the (non-Communist) In-
 ternational Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and begging for advisory
 status in UNESCO (labelling both organizations U.S. imperialist tools);
 and as attacking and undermining the anti-imperialist, revolutionary
 Afro-Asian as well as the All-China Journalists' Association.   But cap-
 ping these more worn-out charges, the statement also said that before
 the Congress, the IOJ had sent out its agents to undermine the unity
 among progressive journalists in Asia, Africa and Latin America and to
 instigate anti-Chinese moves.   It also stated that, as regards the pre-
 parations for and the Congress.itself, the IOJ Secretariat had barred
 the All-China Journalists' Association from access to relevant informa-
 tion and had failed to make available copies of the principal documents
 to be submitted to the Congress. Hence, the statement said, progressive
 journalists must draw a sharp line between themselves and the "capitula-
 tionist" and "splittist" Soviet clique in the IOJ and desist from "united

 Uruguay, Guyana, Argentina, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Guinea,
 Gambia, Cameroon, Uganda, South-West Africa, the South African Repub-
 lic, Mozambique, the UAR, Syria, India and Korea).   The Congress made
 further overtures to journalists from developing countries by express-
 ing support for "progressive" journalists in Africa and Asia.  Efforts
 were also made to retain Cuban support by resolving to hold the next
 congress in Havana in 1970, and by urging Latin American journalists
 to join national liberation movements in line with Cuban policy. (R;epre-
 sentat1ve's    of the Latin American solidarity organization and of the
 Afro-Asian Latin American Peoples' Solidarity Organization [and the
 Pan African Journalists' Federation] were present.)  In addition,
 overtures were made for cooperation with the non-Communist IFJ.  (Hermann:
 "We know that apart from the journalists who oppose all cooperation,
 there are in its ranks colleagues who fully share our views.")
 IOJ Plans and Activities.   Secretary General Meissner announced
 that the IOJ Executive Committee has a 3-year plan for promotion of
 press, radio and TV in developing countries.   The USSR, the GDR, Czech-
 oslovakia and Hungary are in the forefront of IOJ efforts to give active
 support to national organizations in the training and education of jour-
 nalists.   The IOJ plans to form research groups with journalistic insti-
 tutions to discuss technical progress in press, radio and TV.
 "European Security."  As host country, East Germany received specific
 affirmations of support.  Meissner suggested attention be devoted to the
 question of West German access to atomic weapons and he called West Ger-
 many's "presumption to be sole representative of the German people" an
 aggressive concept which threatens European security.   Safeguards for
 European security were described by the Secretary General as one of the
 most urgent contemporary needs. A Polish delegate discussed a proposal
 of the "socialist" states to convene a European Security Conference and
 he called on journalists from capitalist as well as "socialist" ? countries
 to meet their great responsibility in regard to such a conference.   (The
 World Council of Peace, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and
 the International Union of Students also have plans for a European Secu-
 rity Conference.)
 Spoils for the Host.   The East German press cast Walter Ulbricht
 as the star of a reception given for the delegates.  Ulbricht welcomed
 the IOJ delegates with praise for their profession and quoted, "all
 intellectual struggles of modern times have been waged in millions of
 newspaper columns."  In passing remarks Ulbricht strongly supported the
 Vietnamese struggle, but most of his speech was devoted to Germany.

 1072 FE.                   JAPAN'S ROLE IN ASIA
 AND THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  On 6 December 1966, the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) is
 scheduled to hold its biannual conference, the outcome of which can have
 a strong bearing on the continued life of Prime Minister Sato's moderate
 free-world oriented government.   (General elections in Japan will be held
 in 1967). With 145 seats in the Diet's (parliament) powerful lower house
 the JSP has functioned as the core of the opposition to Sato's ruling
 Liberal Democratic Party's 283 member majority but the effectiveness of
 the JSP has from the beginning been severely corroded by factionalism.
 At the JSP's January 1966 national conventiop an unusually severe
 confrontation between the ruling extreme left wing factions under Sasaki
 Kozo and the moderate factions under a number of leaders.united the mod-
 erates in an uneasy truce which has survived despite intense personal and
 ideological frictions.   Should the truce be continued in the hope of achiev-
 ing collective power, the moderates could unhorse the hard-line Marxist
 Sasaki despite his advantage of being an "in"' working against him also
 is the problem of divisions among his backers although he was elected party
 chairman at the convention despite this problem.
 At the moment the best hope for the moderate element appears to be a
 group of younger, bright JSP Diet members who have wearied of the role of
 perpetual opposition party.  These men, having acquired a taste for power
 through the labor unions which support the JSP and which provided their
 original springboard for election to the Diet, now want to: help rule the
 country.   They are believed ready to take up the cudgels within the JSP
 for a form of peaceful coexistence (as opposed to the hard-liners' pro-
 Peking position); for the development of a Japanese defense force and some
 defense relationship with the U.S.  (as opposed to the hard-liners' position
 of "unarmed neutrality" and total antagonism to Japan-U.S. defense arrang-
 ments); and for maneuvering independently of the Japan Communist Party (JCP)
 (as opposed to the hard-liners' enthusiasm for joint action with the JCP).
 The moderates in the JSP are still Marxist-oriented, but their desire
 to wield significant power as a functioning part of the Japanese Govern-
 ment has forced the realization that they must accommodate to the new look
 in Japan to which Sato's government contributes - prosperity, trade expan-
 sion, participation in international affairs, and a growing awareness of

 purely Asian wants.  Japan will probably continue on this course as
 long as her booming prosperity cont.nues', but Sat,Y's government could
 undoubtedly enlarge the scope of itt internationaL participation if
 the JSP moderates can get taemselveb into a positLon to support the
 government rather than oppose it.
 The moderates' chances depend  .n great part!rn the nature of their
 support from Sohyo, Japan's molt porerful trade d)nfederation*, which
 furnishes most of the JSP finds, supplies most of its street demonstra-
 tors and half of its membership, and in.1963 decried the election of
 about one third of the JSP's 11l5 Diet representa ives,   Sohyo was born
 in 1950 when the country was still buffering the'anavoidably hungry, sour
 aftermath of defeat and surrender. 'Despite the   ast benevolent occupa-
 tion in man's history, Japan proved ready soil fd  the growth of commu-
 nist elements and less than a year after; its organization Sohyo was un-
 compromisingly Marxist-orie ted and'heaVily communist-penetrated.   Sohyo's
 stormy history has reflected Japan'e economic proress, and has see-sawed.
 back and forth between the extremism of its Marxist-inspired beginnings
 and the moderation brought about by Japan's phencnenal_ economic growth.
 In the early'60's Sohyo's leadership began to doubt the wisdom of support-
 ing the JCP; it cut off close relat.ons and join  political action with
 the JCP and moved towards t::~e JSP. ;Except for a brief flurry among the
 extremist elements of Sohyo in 1961+-65 (brought   :i by an economic reces-
 sion, rising prices and the Vietnam; war) Sohyo's Leadership appears to
 have concluded that the unions are better off cor:;entrating on economic
 rather than political issues.   This!trend was refrLected in Sohyo's action
 program for 1966 which is heavily weighted towar4a the economic side and
 urges cooperation with moderate unions during  we struggles."  Inter-
 nationally, Sohyo has adopted "positive neutralit,r" as its program and

 to furnish medical supplies and clothing to South Vietnam not because
 it supports the west's position in. Vietnam but because it is more criti-

 to be a friend of the free world.
 Soka.Gakkai, the much-publicized militant lay Buddhist organization
 of Japan has risen from obscurity to national political prominence in
 Japan over the past decade.   Its religious intolerance, its authoritarian
 structure, and its assertion that the world's problems-can be solved if
 everyone embraces its branch of Buddhism (the orthodox Nichiren dogma),
 are expected to limit its eventual appeal, and its growth rate has slowed
 up since 19.59.   Soka Gakkai has a young and vigorous leadership which has
 recognized"that political and economic factors are paramount with the
 majority of the populations of technically advanced nations like Japan;
 in 196+ this leadership established a full-fledged political party, the
 Komeito (Clean Government Party), which has addressed itself to those
 political and economic factors.   Komeito won 13.7% of the votes (over
 five million) for the House of Councillors (the Upper House of the Japan-
 ese Diet) in the July 1965 elections, and for the first time will field
 candidates in forthcoming elections for the House of Representatives (the
 important Lower House).  All political observers, including the rival
 parties, concede that Komeito will enter the Lower House; if it displaces
 the middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist Party for third place there,
 as it has already done in the Upper House, Komeito will command the swing
 vote in the Diet.  Despite its exaggerated claims to membership and the
 decline in its growth rate, the Soka Gakkai is a major political factor
 with which both conservatives and leftists must reckon since it can bar-
 gain for concessions by offering its support to one side or the other.   25X1C10 b
 It is generally characterized by political observers as an enigmatic,
 troublesome object in the Japanese body politic.

 1073 WH.                     THE LATIN AMERICAN
 FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION -- LAFTA
 25X1ClOb
 SITUATION:  Why Economic Integration?  The need for economic inte-
 gration was first formally proclaimed by the United Nations Commission
 for Latin America in 1949, although it had been the dream of a few far-
 sighted Latin Americans since the days of Simon Bolivar.   However, the
 absolute necessity of it became increasingly evident after the middle
 of the 1950's, when per capita income began to fall as a consequence of
 the explosive population growth rate which surpassed the economic growth
 rate.  Also during the late 1950's, Latin America's export revenue began
 to drop alarmingly as a result of falling commodity prices.  Another com-
 pelling reason was the creation of vast trading areas elsewhere in the
 world --+ the,Communist bloc, the European Economic Community (EEC), the
 European Free Trade Area (EFTA) -- which forced small, independent markets
 outside these agglomerations to unite into new economic blocs or face con-
 tinuously weakening trading positions.   The success of the EEC undoubtedly
 also had a profound influence on Latin statesmen.  Although there are
 obvious, wide differences between Europe and Latin America, the concrete
 example of an integrating regional market showed that uniting independent
 economies was a practical possibility. The final and conclusive reason
 for embarking on economic integration was that there was really no alterna-
 tive:   continuing the status quo ante could only have led to growing
 poverty, famine, and revolution.
 The fundamental reason for the continent's having arrived at this
 state was a series of tariff barriers erected around the separate coun-
 tries of Latin America which frequently reached 300%.   These barriers had
 grown for several reasons.   The countries of South America have tradition-
 ally had only limited relations among themselves due partly to the geogra-
 phy of the continent -- divided by the Andes mountains and the vast un-
 developed Amazon basis -- and due also to  the heritage of the ancient
 Spanish colonial empire which (because of Madrid's suspicions against her
 ambitious Governors and Viceroys) had been based on direct dealings be-
 tween the separate colonies and Spain, with little inter-relation between
 the colonies.  Added to this, foreign currency shortages had tended to
 foster the local manufacture of goods which couldn't be brought abroad.
 Tariff barriers also s=erved to foster development of "prestige" industries:
 "every self-respecting country should have a steel industry."  Another con-
 tributing factor was the oligarchical.nature of most Latin American indus-
 try; which had no desire to face foreign competition and which had the
 political power to limit or prevent competition by imposing tariffs.

 The result was high cost production; andithe unnecessary burden
 increased as foreign manufacture ?s were able too reduce their prices as
 a result of larger and larger scale production. The relatively small
 size of the national markets of the Latin American countries simply
 does not permit separate production on an economical scale in today's
 wor 1Ld .
 The CACM and LAFTA
 The states of Central Ameriba realized the necessity of economic
 union as early as 1958, when a Mlultilateral T4eaty on Free Trade and
 Central American Economic Integration was signed; this subsequently
 developed into the Central American Common Market (CACM), which was
 discussed in EPG Item #1319, of 9 May. 1966.
 In 1960, seven countries of:South Americo agreed to work toward
 the creation of a free trade area as a means df speeding their economic
 development.   Their efforts resulted in the Treaty of Montevideo which
 created a new organization, the Latin Americar# Free Trade Association
 (LAFTA).   Its goal is the creation of a broads multinational market
 which would encourage investment; in new industry, provide jobs for
 their rapidly expanding :populations,and introduce the benefits of
 industrial specialization and mass productions  The treaty was ratified
 in 1961 by Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, l araguay, Peru, Uruguay,
 Colombia and Ecuador.   In 1966 Vbnezuela also decided to join, and
 Bolivia is considering joining. ` The treaty envisaged the' gi-adual elimi-
 nation of internal tariffs (that: is, tariffs between the member nations)
 over a:12 year period.                              J
 Since its inception LAFTA has made significant gains.   Through a
 series of annual bargaining sessions, tariffs~on more than 9,000 prod-
 ucts,have been reduced or eliminated.   Intra-LAFTA trade has increased
 about 120 percent, although such trade represdots only about 1.2 percent
 (up from 7 percent in 1961) of the total intea}national trade of the
 area.
 The process of tariff reduction has provgd to be difficult.   So
 disparate are the tariff structures of the member nations that across-
 the-board reductions have been impossible, this necessitating tedious
 multi-lateral negotiations on individual item.  And the negotiations
 have steadily grown more difficult as the readily-eliminated tariffs
 have been taken care of and the discussions mdYve onto tougher items.
 Progress in 1965, after only minimal concessions in 1963 and 1961+, was
 heartening.   The most recent negotiating sess4on convened in Montevideo
 on 21+ October 1966.   It is expected to last until 2 December and will
 be followed by a meeting of the 'foreign ministers of the LAFTA nations,
 who are supposed to ratify a new.. economic into?ration schedule and work
 out a general agreement on transportation, tho pooling of human resources,
 and the use of arbitration in trade disputes.1

 Beyond LAFTA
 Although LAFTA has made significant gains, Latin American leaders
 have indicated a growing realization that Latin America needs more than
 just a free trade area, and the goal which is now being discussed is a
 Latin American Common Market, the chief additional features of which
 might be automatic tariff reductions, common external tariffs and co-
 ordinated domestic economic policies.  Also being studied are various
 multi-national development projects within the area, designed to con-
 tribute to true economic integration. The projects would include such
 undertakings as development of the major river basins for flood control,
 irrigation, and power, the building of major road links to open up
 isolated areas and to provide transportation between the various coun-
 tries, and the improvement of communications systems.   The LA Common
 Market envisages the eventual union of LAFTA and the CACM.
 These plans were the outgrowth of an appeal by President Eduardo
 Frei of Chile to four of Latin America's most distinguished economists
 in January 1965 for ideas to hasten economic development in the continent.
 The result was a report sent by the four economists to the presidents of
 all Latin American countries in April 1965 entitled "Proposals for the
 Creation of a Latin American Common Market."  The report was subsequently
 endorsed by the Inter-American Committee on the Alliance for Progress
 (CIAP) in a report prepared by that group in August 1965 for the presidents
 of the AFP countries.   Economic integration was given a further boost at
 a meeting of some 400 business leaders from Latin America and the United
 States in Mexico City in June 1966.   The meeting, sponsored by the Inter-
 American Council for Commer3e and Production, adopted a resolution pledg-
 ing the businessmen to work closely with their governments in furthering
 and hastening the work of LAFTA.   In August 1966, high-level representa-
 tives of Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela met in Bogota,
 Colombia to discuss possible steps for greater economic cooperation.
 Among the cardinal points of "The Declaration of Bogota," as the conclus-
 ions of the meeting were titled, was an outline of steps to be taken to
 reinforce the structure of LAFTA and to move it toward eventual union
 with the CACM to form a Common Market for all Latin America.  Equal stress
 was given to economic integration by President Johnson in a speech com-
 memorating the fifth anniversary of the Alliance for Progress on 17 August
 1966.  Mentioning the forthcoming meeting of the presidents of the American
 republics, President Johnson stated that the first item on the agenda will
 be economic integration of Latin America.                                       25X1 C1 Ob

 of LAFTA in more detail.

 SITUATION:   Far from being immune from youth problems, Soviet leaders
 are Faced with a wide range of attitudes and problems which have lingered
 and grown as, insufficient attention was paid to remedying them.   Soviet
 propaganda is striking hard at the Red Guards, evidently hoping to convince
 their own youth that conditions in the USSR are favorable.   Soviet youth,
 in their present disaffected mood, are unlikely to be convinced by mere
 rhetoric.  Nor do there appear to be other easy methods open to the Soviets
 to cope with their youth problems.  Probably to be on the safe side, the
 Soviets have recently tightened up their legal and police machinery in
 order to stem the more radical manifestations of disaffection amongst their
 youth.
 The Red Guard Movement in Communist China is in all major respects
 radically different from youth organizations in the USSR and the East Euro-
 pean satellites.   The 8 to 12-million strong Red Guards were brought into
 being independent of all prior existing organizations; amongst the youth
 of the Soviet Bloc there has been no new officially sponsored organization
 or movement.   The CPC-sponsored Young Communist League with 40 million
 members has played no observable role in Mao's "cultural revolution;" the
 USSR's Komsomol,* also an adjunct of the CP, continues to act as spokesman
 and guiding spirit not only for its 23 million members but for all Soviet
 youth.   The Red Guards' activities, as described-in BPG item #1070, are
 militantly opposed to vestiges of the past and appear to be taking sides
 in the ChiComs' current political struggle.   On the other hand, the of-
 ficial Soviet youth activities aim to stimulate reverence for the older
 generation and unqualified support for the CPSU.
 Probably the leading medium in the Soviets' assault on the Chicom
 Red Guards is KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (KOMSOMOL TRUTH), the official newspaper
 of the Komsomol.   The pages of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA have been crammed with
 *sometimes referred to as the Young Communist League (YCL) or the Commu-
 nist Youth League.

 articles falling into 3 categories:   a series or4 Red Guard activities
 or tactics such as "big character" posters and the "black .-List" of
 enemies of Mao; quotations from the Chicom Press, usually without com-
 ment; and observations by :COMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reporters of typical
 events.   One obvious aim of the articles is to ridicule the Red Guards
 and the "cultural revolution."  Implicit in KOM)MOLSKAYA PRAVDA's treat-
 ment of the Red Guards is an exhortation to  SovTh t  youth to realize that
 they live well and have a 'bright future: in the USSR, not only relative
 to the situation in Communist China but also wht:i compared with the
 Stalin era.               11
 This opinion-shaping effort dovetails neat]4r with KOMSOMOLSKAYA
 PRAVDA's year-old campaign to stress the patriotic education of Soviet
 youth.   Pavlov, chief of the Komsomol, has sparl:~d this effort, aimed
 largely at getting the youth to appreciate the dLder generation for its
 contributions to economic development and theirLaartime achievements.  i
 (One method is to get Komsomol units to. build or{restore monuments to
 war heroes).   In addition, the Red'Army and the~jolice have joined forces
 with the Komsomol in an effort to steer: Soviet y9Duth away from foreign
 and liberal influences.
 No matter how hard or skillfully KOMSOMOLSI4'1YA PRAVDA uses the Red
 Guard developments, however, Soviet youth is most, unlikely to respond
 favorably to the regime;'s suggestions.  For in tae USSR, as in, several
 Satellite countries, there is long-&.ccumulating e0.ridence that the negative
 attitudes of today's youth pose an`.enorinous barr.er between them and the
 wielders of power and control.  Among the prevalllant attitudes are distrust,
 boredom, indifference, and self-indulgence.   Thel causes of these attitudes
 include:   the contradictions between the lofty-sl)unding communist principles
 preached in school and by the Komsomol and the J-~pths to which. communist
 reality has actually sunk; unresolved conflicts [:)etween generations (see
 attached gist of magazine story); the stifling chntrols imposed on youth,
 especially through the Komsomol which is dominat[2d by a small group of
 CP-appointed officials; the continuing shortages of quality consumer
 goods; the restriction in openingsfo:r advanceme~it in political, economic,
 scientific and military spheres indicated by theN rising average age of top
 Soviet officials; the effects of the double graCating class from inter-
 mediate schools in 1966 (viz., the sharp reductij)n of the percentage of
 graduates going on to higher educational irstitu:ions and the high per-
 centage of graduates who are unemployed or underemployed:   see BPG item
 #1018, "Employment Problems in the USSR"); the *decisiveness pervading
 Soviet society because of the present leaders' slowness in resolving ques-
 tions of political and economic policy; the regijie's attempts to insulate
 Soviet youth from Western contacts.and influence(;; and the throttling of
 free expression, as most starkly evidenced by the Sinyavsky-Daniel case.
 Indeed, the oppressive intellectual environment 1uid the inept efforts of
 the Soviet leadership to control Soviet youth ha4~ led some groups in the
 USSR to express their disenchantment.   The SMOG 1,initials for "Youngest
 Society of Geniuses" and for the mmtto of the sok:iety:   Boldness, Thought,
 Image, Profundity) has been mentioned widely in t:he Western press, and its

 rejection of Soviet society has been discussed openly by Valery Tarsis.
 In addition, University of Leningrad students have published a secret
 journal, "Kolokol" (The Bell), which is a clear indication that some
 Soviet youths prefer to pattern their philosophy after that of Alexander
 Herzen, the emigre radical who smuggled the original radical "Kolokol"
 into Russia in the mid-1800's.
 The severity of the USSR's youth problems is clear from the speeches
 of Komsomol boss Pavlov (see attached) and the contents of KOMSOMOLSKAYA
 PRAVDA.  Although they make feeble efforts to blame bourgeois propaganda
 and foreign influences for the unsatisfactory state of Soviet youth, the
 Komsomol leaders paint such a broad array of grinding problems that it
 is evident that the disaffection has roots in the Soviet environment.
 The Soviets' prospects for solving their youth problems appear to
 be slight.   The Komsomol cannot be counted on because it is not re-
 spected, due to overdoses of control and a failure to stimulate its mem-
 bers.   (As far back as 1958 Khrushchev addressed himself to the frequent
 complaint that young people were bored in the Komsomol.)  The main meas-
 ures undertaken recently by the Soviets are in the field of detecting
 and treating crime and hooliganism,* as decreed in July 1966.  A sub-
 sequent decree of 16 September has added three new crimes:   spreading
 deliberately false fabrications harmful to the state and social order;
 defacing the national emblem or flag; and the organization or participa-
 tion in group actions which violate the public order.   (See accompanying
 BN).   Thus, Soviet legal measures not only tend to bear out the existence
 of severe youth problems on a wide scale, but also reveal that the Sov -l C10 b
 regime's response is increasingly negative.
 *In Soviet parlance hooliganism is a catch-all term extensively used to
 cover a multitude of violations against the Soviet-defined social order:
