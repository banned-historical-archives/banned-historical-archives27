 INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT ACT OF 1988
 TUESDAY, JUNE 14, 1988
 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
 COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS,
 Washington, DC.
 The committee met, at 9:30 a.m., in room 2172, Rayburn House
 Office Building, Hon. Dante B. Fascell (chairman) presiding.
 Chairman FASCELL. The committee will come to order. I would
 like to recognize some distinguished guests we have with us this
 morning: Mr. George Agree of the Association of Former Members
 of Congress is here with a group of distinguished parliamentarians
 from Egypt. I would like to have them stand up to be recognized.
 We are pleased to have you here to sit in on this committee hear-
 ing.
 We meet today to begin consideration of H.R. 3822, the Intelli-
 gence Oversight Act of 1988, which has been jointly referred to the
 House Foreign Affairs Committee and House Permanent Select
 Committee on Intelligence. This measure was introduced by our
 colleague Mr. Stokes, the distinguished Chairman of the House
 Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The House Perma-
 nent Select Committee on Intelligence ordered the bill favorably re-
 ported, as .amended, by a vote of 11 to 6 on May 11, 1987. The
 Senate companion measure, S. 1721, sponsored by Senator Boren
 and Senator Cohen was approved by the full Senate on March 5th
 by a vote of 72 to 19. The measure was jointly referred to the
 House Foreign Affairs Committee based on its oversight responsi-
 bility of the foreign policy implications of intelligence activities and
 specifically on section 2 of the bill which repeals section 662 of the
 Foreign Assistance Act, the revised Hughes-Ryan provision.
 H.R. 3822 has been the subject of extensive hearings in the intel-
 ligence committees. The bill as ordered reported by the committee
 enjoys bipartisan support except for one provision, the requirement
 that the President must notify the Congress no later than 48 hours
 after the initiation of a covert action. A lot has been said about this
 provision but I view it as a modest adjustment to the present law,
 which, currently requires that the Congress be notified of covert
 operations in a "timely fashion." I believe that requirement for
 prior notice and consultation is designed not only to recognize the
 constitutional duties and prerogatives of the Congress. It also gives
 the President the benefit of independent counsel on important for-
 eign policy decisions, which are needed to build a bipartisan con-
 sensus on covert operations which impact on larger foreign policy
 consensus. In short, H.R. 3822 doesn't infringe on the President's

 flexibility; rather it is the essence of true oversight and consulta-
 tion. It will ensure that covert actions advance rather than erode
 U.S. National Security interests. H.R. 3822 will ensure that the
 necessary and appropriate consultation occurs at the time it is
 most useful-prior to the initiation of a sensitive covert action.
 To assist the committee in consideration of this legislation, we
 are pleased to have before us today the Honorable William Web-
 ster, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency; the Honorable
 Michael H. Armacost, Under Secretary for Political Affairs, De-
 partment of State, and the Honorable Clark M. Clifford, former
 Secretary of Defense.
 Mr. Broomfield has a statement he would like to make.
 OPENING STATEMENT OF CONGRESSMEN BROOMFIELD
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
 I wish to join in welcoming the Director of Central Intelligence,
 Judge Webster, as well as Michael Armacost, the Deputy Under
 Secretary of State.
 Let me say at the outset I cannot support the bill we are discuss-
 ing this morning in its present form.
 This does not mean that H.R. 3822 does not have some desirable
 elements. It would help to clarify and consolidate the laws applica-
 ble to the reporting of intelligence activities, particularly covert ac-
 tions.
 The basic problem with the bill is the requirement to report to
 Congress all presidential findings authorizing covert activities
 within 48 hours. Regardless of misunderstandings that may arise
 from time to time, the President simply must have more flexibility
 to delay notification for a time, especially in sensitive circum-
 stances.
 This is because requiring immediate notification in every case
 could inhibit the President from taking action essential to the na-
 tional security.
 It could also discourage foreign governments and others from co-
 operating with the United States because of the perception that in-
 formation given to Congress is not completely secure.
 Mr. Chairman, former senior officials of our government are vir-
 tually unanimous in their belief that notification to Congress of
 covert action may have to be delayed in certain cases. Those who
 have come forward-former National Security Advisor Zbigniew
 Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger, and Brent Scowcroft and former Di-
 rectors of Central Intelligence William Colby, Richard Helms, and
 Stansfield Turner.
 I ask that a letter to Chairman Stokes of the Intelligence Com-
 mittee by several of these prominent Americans be included in the
 record.
 Chairman FASCELL. Without objection, so ordered.'
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. However, since the Minority heard only late
 last week that a private witness would be appearing on behalf of
 the 48-hour bill, the Minority has not been able to accommodate

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 3
 the schedule of the many witnesses who are opposed to this provi-
 sion.
 I hope, Mr. Chairman, you will have another hearing. I hope at
 that time we will be able to schedule a witness of our choice.
 Mr. Chairman, I want to note our former chairman and col-
 league, Clem Zablocki, supported a limited exception to the con-
 gressional notification requirement during debate on the current
 oversight act in 1980.
 He stated,
 The legislation makes the fundamental recognition that in extraordinary circum-
 stances advance information on covert operations might be withheld from the Select
 Committees on Intelligence. ... Such exemptions are absolutely essential to a
 strong intelligence community and important for U.S. security.
 Mr. Zablocki also stated that the exemption-
 Will also help the American intelligence community to maintain the extraordi-
 nary secrecy necessary for intelligence activities and promote cooperation from the
 intelligence communities of friendly countries.
 Let me make it clear, however, that I do not believe that the Ex-
 ecutive Branch has an unfettered right to withhold information on
 covert activities from Congress. Under legislation I have sponsored,
 H.R. 3611, the President could delay notification for a time, but
 only if there were an emergency constituting a grave and immedi-
 ate threat to national security.
 I would have to say that an excellent example was the Canadian
 rescue operation during the Carter Administration.
 Under my approach, the President would have to make a written
 determination that the situation justified withholding notification
 from Congress. In addition, the President would have the option of
 notifying only four congressional leaders and not eight members of
 Congress, as at present.
 In my view, this bill is a misguided attempt to cure the ills of the
 Iran-Contra affair. But the Administration has already gone far in
 that direction. In particular, I think everybody owes a great tribute
 to Bill Webster for what he personally has done.
 The President's new. national security decision directive on
 covert actions, states that notification can be delayed only in "rare,
 extraordinary circumstances." This is consistent with my concept.
 The President is also required under the NSDD to review such a
 decision together with his senior advisors every ten days.
 Early on during the investigation of the Iran-Contra affair, the
 Tower Commission clearly placed the blame on the National Secu-
 rity Council.
 They commended the Administration for removing speedily to
 ti    make the necessary corrections, in particular removing the NSC
 from covert operations.
 Similarly, the Majority Report of the Iran-Contra Committees-
 and Mr. Hamilton, one of the co-chairmen is here-itself indicated
 that the basic problem in. the-Iran-Contra affair were the people,
 .not the law. s.Jt__isxnot- clear, therefore, :why the investigating com-
 mittees and.-the intelligence committees have recommended the in-
 flexible approach we have before us today.

 It is clear to me that the 48-hour requirement is an unconstitu-
 tional intrusion on the ability of the President to conduct necessary
 covert action in support of United States foreign policy interests.
 There is much in this bill that is useful-I think that this is a
 point that should be made as well as some things that are very con-
 structive. But H.R. 3822 is flawed by the insistence of its propo-
 nents on the inclusion of the absolute 48-hour notification provi-
 sion.
 How can this be seen as anything but a purely political issue?
 The Administration has extensively reformed its own internal pro-
 cedures. It has also cooperated closely with the congressional intel-
 ligence committees in approving this bill.
 It seems that the proponents of this bill, want to cause a veto by
 the President over the 48-hour issue. If so, they have chosen the
 wrong issue.
 There is no doubt that, constitutionally as well as practically, the
 48-hour requirement is seriously defective.
 With that said, I am thankful for this opportunity to discuss this
 bill. I particularly look forward to the testimony of the Administra-
 tion witnesses. Thank you very much.
 Mr. LEACH. Will the gentleman yield for a unanimous consent?
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. I would be happy to yield.
 Mr. LEACH. I would like to request the Chair to allow me to
 insert in the record a particularly prescient quote from the gentle-
 man from Michigan on a floor statement holding entirely this posi-
 tion. I would say this is not a view that is novel to the gentleman
 from Michigan in this particular year.
 It is a long-held, firm conviction for which he is to be respected. I
 would like unanimous consent to place that in the record.
 Chairman FASCELL. Without objection, I am sure Mr. Broomfield
 will not object.
 [The information follows:]
 Henceforth, in extraordinary circumstances affecting vital national interests-the
 President will be allowed to defer reporting to Congress on CIA covert action oper-
 ations abroad. The key word here is defer. The President is not excused forever
 from letting us know about such activities. * * * We are just allowing him to post-
 pone his reporting in those rare instances where, for example, prior disclosure
 would jeopardize the lives of the personnel or the methods employed in a particular
 covert action activity.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Thank you very much.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Webster, let's start with you. You have a
 statement. You can put it in the record. You may summarize it.

 CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
 Judge WEBSTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am sure I cannot
 improve on what Mr. Broomfield said.
 In any event, I am pleased to be here to share some of my
 thoughts on H.R. 3822, the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1988.
 Since this is the first time I have appeared before this Committee
 as Director of Central Intelligence, I also want to take this opportu-
 nity to provide you with my views on the relationship between this
 Committee and the CIA.

 Chairman FASCELL. I think that would be very useful, Mr. Web-
 ster. Let me on behalf of the committee welcome you. We are de-
 lighted that you have this opportunity to appear with us. We have
 felt for a long time that it was absolutely essential to maintain the
 closest relationship with the Agency.
 Life being what it is on the Hill, we do not always get what we
 want. But nevertheless, because everything you do in your Agency
 does have such an impact on policy, we are delighted to have you
 here today even if it is on a peripheral matter.
 Judge WEBSTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 The views expressed in this statement on H.R. 3822 reflect the
 position of the Administration. I draw your attention at the outset
 to the Administration position, as conveyed to Congress in the
 President's legislative message, that a bill which fails to preserve
 the flexibility and authority the President needs to conduct intelli-
 gence activities effectively will not be acceptable to the President.
 Mr. Chairman, my testimony today will be the third time I have
 testified on Intelligence Oversight Legislation. I appeared last No-
 vember before the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify on simi-
 lar legislation and in February before the House Intelligence Com-
 mittee on H.R. 3822. In my testimony before those committees, I
 focused primarily on whether the legislation was truly necessary,
 and on the practical impact of the Oversight bill on the intelligence
 community. I intend to address both points in my testimony on the
 House bill today.
 In my remarks before the Senate and House Intelligence Com-
 mittees I questioned the need for this type of legislation. Although
 both Intelligence Committees subsequently decided to recommend
 approval of the legislation, I still believe that this legislation is not
 a necessary response to the concerns Members of the Congress
 have expressed about the oversight of covert action.
 As you know, the President recognized last year that there was
 room for improvement in the way the two branches were meeting
 their responsibilities. As a result, he took concrete, substantial
 steps to establish improved procedures to ensure that Congress is
 given the opportunity to play its appropriate oversight role.
 These new procedures, in the form of a National Security Deci-
 sion Directive on Special Activities, NSDD-286, much of which has
 been declassified, clarify the rules by which covert actions are re-
 viewed, approved, and reported to Congress. In fact, many of the
 proposals contained in H.R. 3822 are already contained in NSDD-
 286. This can be illustrated by making a few comparisons between
 the bill and the presidential directive.
 The bill requires that findings be in writing, cannot be made ret-
 roactive, and must be consistent with existing law. Similar require-
 ments are contained in the NSDD.
 The bill makes clear that a presidential finding must be obtained
 before any agency or department can conduct a covert action. The
 presidential directive affirms this principle.
 The bill requires that a presidential finding specify the names of
 each department or agency of the U.S. Government that is funding
 or participating in a significant way in a covert action, and wheth-
 er it is contemplated that any third party will be used to fund or

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7  6
 otherwise participate in a significant way in the .covert action.
 Again, the presidential directive contains the same requirement.
 It is not surprising or coincidental that provisions of the bill are
 similar to the presidential directive. The procedures the President
 has installed were developed following close and prolonged consul-
 tation with members and staffs of the intelligence committees.
 While a presidential directive is not the same as legislation, I am
 not persuaded that new legislation at this time is the best way to
 address the concerns that Members have with the congressional
 role regarding special activities. In my view, a legislative remedy
 should be employed only if it is clear that there is a basic deficien-
 cy in the oversight process. That is doubly the case when the legis-
 lative remedy proposed raises constitutional issues that threaten to
 divide the two branches in an area where effective work places a
 premium on cooperation.
 The Iran-Contra matter, while serious, has not in my view dem-
 onstrated that the system of congressional oversight of the intelli-
 gence community established under current statutes is seriously
 flawed. Many of the problems exposed, were the result of officials
 failing to follow existing procedures and rules, as Mr. Broomfield
 pointed out in his statement.
 As you may be aware, I have taken steps within the CIA to disci-
 pline those employees who failed to follow CIA procedures or who
 testified to Congress in a manner that was not candid- or complete.
 Those actions, taken in light of the requirements defined by cur-
 rent statute, in my view have adequately addressed the problems
 we found.
 Similarly, to the extent that there were any procedural short-
 comings demonstrated by the Iran-Contra matter, they have al-
 ready been addressed by the new presidential directive within the
 statutory framework presently existing.
 I would like to emphasize that any legislation that is enacted
 should not adversely affect the intelligence community's ability to
 do its job. In this connection, Mr. Chairman, the bill passed by the
 Senate in March and the bill marked up by the House Intelligence
 .Committee have addressed constructively some of the important
 substantive concerns I and other Administration officials raised
 with the original Senate bill introduced in that body.
 Both the House and Senate bills, for example, recognize the need
 to report on special activities and intelligence collection in a
 manner consistent with due regard for the protection of sensitive
 intelligence sources and methods. I am also pleased that neither
 bill requires that the finding specify the identity of foreign coun-
 tries assisting the Agency in the conduct of covert action.
 These important safeguards will in my view go a long way in as-
 suring friendly intelligence services and potential agents that
 source-identifying information will not be widely disseminated and
 possibly compromised.
 I am also very pleased with the changes in the original House
 version of the bill made by the House Intelligence Committee in re-
 sponse to concerns I raised before that committee. My reservations
 regarded the definition of covert action, the expenditure of non-ap-
 propriated funds and the reporting. of the transfer of Defense arti-
 cles or services. In particular, the new definition of covert action

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 7
 removes much of the ambiguity over what constitutes a covert
 action and is in my view a distinct improvement over the current
 definitions.
 While the intelligence committees have addressed several con-
 cerns previously raised in my testimony before those committees,
 there is one area of the bill that remains particularly troublesome.
 This area of difficulty involves the provision of the bill that re-
 quires notification of a covert action to Congress, without excep-
 tion, within 48 hours after the signing of a finding. Last summer,
 the Department of Justice provided the Congress with its views on
 the constitutionality of such a provision, so I will not address that
 issue here. I have two separate concerns about this provision.
 First, the fact that there is a sharp difference of interpretation
 between the view of the Administration and the position embodied
 in this bill regarding this provision's constitutional validity will
 promote tension between the Executive and Legislative Branches
 for years to come. In the intelligence area such tension has the po-
 tential to disrupt the cooperation and trust that effective national
 security policy requires.
 Second, I believe that as a practical matter allowance must be
 made for that rare case where a limited delay in congressional no-
 tification is critical to preserve the absolute secrecy of an operation
 when, for example, lives are at stake. In such a rare case, the suc-
 cess of an operation may depend on the cooperation of a foreign
 government that has conditioned its support on the President de-
 laying congressional notification until the operation is completed.
 An inflexible notification requirement could force a President to
 choose between providing the congressionally required notification
 within 48 hours and jeopardizing the lives of innocent Americans,
 or delaying that notification to protect those lives. I can under-
 stand why any President would be reluctant to agree to a law that
 would require such choices.
 It is worthwhile to note that concerns about excessive delay in
 congressional notification of a special activity have already been
 addressed by NSDD 286. That directive requires the National Secu-
 rity Planning Group to reevaluate at least every ten days a deci-
 sion to delay congressional notification of a given finding.
 This will ensure that when a delay in notification is necessary,
 the reason for that decision will be continually reassessed by re-
 sponsible senior officers of several agencies or departments so that
 the delay will be as short as possible. I repeat, however, that I can
 think of very few circumstances that would ever necessitate such
 extraordinary steps.
 Mr. Chairman, if the committee should nevertheless decide that
 legislation is necessary to limit the President's authority to delay
 notification, I would urge the Members to give serious consider-
 ation to language contained in a bill proposed by Ranking Minority
 Member Broomfield that would allow the President to delay notifi-
 cation if he determines that an emergency constituting a grave and
 immediate threat to the national security of the United States
 exists. While such a standard may not cover all situations where
 lives are , at stake, it would allow the President the flexibility to
 delay notification in circumstances where the government faces a
 grave and immediate threat to its security.

 Although not directly relevant to the legislation before this com-
 mittee, I thought this would be an appropriate time to address a
 concern I understand some Members have with respect to access by
 the Foreign Affairs Committee to intelligence information. In my
 view, the Foreign Affairs Committee has a legitimate need for in-
 formation about developments around the world. Some of this in-
 formation is classified. Our best intelligence analysis about the sig-
 nificance and implications of such developments can play an impor-
 tant part in the committee doing its work properly.
 I believe the record will show that the Central Intelligence
 Agency has, in fact, been responsive to the request of the commit-
 tee for such information. Some recent statistics help to illustrate
 this point. During the period from 1986 to the present, there have
 been 48 staff briefings, 68 Member briefings, and 14 appearances
 before the committee involving formal testimony.
 To the Congress as a whole, CIA now provides more than 1,000
 briefings a year. Listening to these briefings takes a great deal of
 valuable time on your part, so I gather you must find them useful.
 The substance of the information conveyed by the Agency to the
 Congress has ranged from pre-trip briefings on particular countries
 for Members to formal testimony on the disaster at Chernobyl or
 terrorism in general. In addition, the committee has access to the
 National Intelligence Daily, our National Intelligence Estimates
 and a variety of other intelligence publications. And I would urge
 members of this committee who are interested in obtaining more
 intelligence information to take advantage of the access of the com-
 mittee to this wealth of information.
 While I believe we have been responsive to the committee's re-
 quest for intelligence information, I hope that you will understand
 my need to protect from disclosure operational intelligence infor-
 mation that might jeopardize our sources and methods for gather-
 ing this information.
 When this information is compromised, not only is the particular
 source of intelligence lost to the Government, but others become
 reluctant to cooperate for fear their identities will also be disclosed.
 In some cases it may be advisable to disclose sensitive operational
 information in order for Congress to conduct effective oversight. A
 decision was made by Congress itself in 1980 to limit this type of
 information to the intelligence committees. This decision was a
 wise one, and I would strongly oppose any proposal to expand the
 number of congressional committees directly involved in intelli-
 gence oversight.
 In addition to the question of access to intelligence information
 in general, I understand some Members are concerned that the
 Foreign Affairs Committee is not being briefed on covert actions
 that have significant foreign policy implications. Under existing
 law and the Intelligence Oversight bill being considered by the
 committee, access to covert action information is confined to the in-
 telligence oversight committees and the defense subcommittees of
 the appropriations committees. I do not believe it is necessary or
 wise to expand the number of committees to which we must report
 covert actions.
 To do so would simply return us to the situation existing before
 the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980 when we had to provide
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 9
 covert action information to eight committees of Congress. This sit-
 uation made it almost impossible to conduct covert action covertly.
 I believe that the concern expressed by some regarding the lack
 of committee access to covert action intelligence may be the result
 of a misperception as to how covert action relates to our foreign
 policy. Covert action is implementation by clandestine means of
 the foreign policy of the United States Government. Our foreign
 policy is formulated by the President and the Secretary of State.
 The Director of Central Intelligence should not make foreign
 policy or use covert action as a vehicle for creating a secret foreign
 policy. Because the Secretary of State is obligated to keep the For-
 eign Affairs Committee informed of our foreign policy, I believe
 that the committee does have the necessary means to make its
 views known regarding foreign policy, including those specific poli-
 cies being implemented by a covert action.
 If you believe that the arrangement I have described is not ade-
 quate to ensure that the views of the Foreign Affairs Committee
 are represented in the oversight of covert action, I would suggest
 Congress consider greater use of cross-over membership between
 the Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Intelligence Commit-
 tee. Such cross-over members are in the best possible position to ex-
 press the views of the Foreign Affairs Committee in deliberations
 conducted by the House Intelligence Committee. Some of you now
 serve or have in the past served very effectively in this way.
 In closing, I would like to reemphasize to each of you my person-
 al commitment to making the oversight process work. It has
 always been clear, and recent experience has again demonstrated,
 that the implementation of the foreign policy of our government,
 including covert action, can only be successful when the Executive
 and Legislative Branches of government work together in an at-
 mosphere of mutual respect and trust. This spirit of cooperation
 can only occur if the Congress receives the appropriate information
 needed to review and make informed judgments on covert action,
 while at the same time ensuring that this intelligence is protected
 from unauthorized disclosure.
 The law should reflect not only the need for cooperation, but also
 the President's responsibility for the conduct and management of
 our intelligence and the importance to the nation of ensuring that
 the President has the necessary flexibility and authority to employ
 our intelligence capability effectively.
 As I have noted, the President has taken corrective steps to im-
 prove the oversight system through a presidential directive. At
 CIA, I.have approved a number of measures that will prevent a
 repetition of the shortcomings in the Agency's performance in the
 Iran-Contra matter.
 In short, significant changes have been made. I would respectful-
 ly submit that they should be given a chance to work. Indeed, they
 are working. I am convinced that the current framework, and not
 new laws, represents the most appropriate and effective means to
 achieve our shared commitment to have Congress play an active,
 effective role in the oversight of United States intelligence activi-
 ties.

 PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM H. WEBSTER, DIRECTOR, CENTRAL
 INTELLIGENCE
 MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE,
 I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO SHARE SOME OF MY THOUGHTS ON
 H.R. 3822, THE INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT ACT OF 1988.   SINCE THIS  IS
 THE FIRST TIME  I HAVE APPEARED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AS DIRECTOR
 OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE,  I ALSO WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO
 PROVIDE YOU WITH MY VIEWS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS
 COMMITTEE AND THE CIA.
 THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS STATEMENT ON H.R.  3822 REFLECT
 THE POSITION OF THE ADMINISTRATION.   I DRAW YOUR ATTENTION AT THE
 OUTSET TO THE ADMINISTRATION POSITION,  AS CONVEYED TO CONGRESS IN
 THE PRESIDENT'S LEGISLATIVE MESSAGE. THAT A BILL WHICH FAILS TO
 PRESERVE THE FLEXIBILITY AND AUTHORITY THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO
 CONDUCT INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES EFFECTIVELY WILL NOT BE ACCEPTABLE
 TO THE PRESIDENT.        -
 MR. CHAIRMAN, MY TESTIMONY TODAY WILL BE THE THIRD TIME I HAVE
 TESTIFIED ON INTELLIGENCE-OVERSIGHT LEGISLATION.   I APPEARED LAST
 NOVEMBER BEFORE THE SENATE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE TO TESTIFY ON
 SIMILAR LEGISLATION AND IN FEBRUARY BEFORE THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
 COMMITTEE ON H.R. 3822.   IN MY TESTIMONY BEFORE THOSE COMMITTEES.
 I FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON WHETHER THE LEGISLATION WAS TRULY NECESSARY.
 AND ON THE PRACTICAL IMPACT OF THE OVERSIGHT BILL ON THE

 INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.   I  INTEND TO ADDRESS BOTH POINTS IN MY
 TESTIMONY TODAY ON THE HOUSE BILL.
 IN MY REMARKS BEFORE THE SENATE AND HOUSE INTELLIGENCE.
 COMMITTEES I QUESTIONED THE NEED FOR THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION.
 ALTHOUGH BOTH INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES SUBSEQUENTLY-DECIDED TO
 RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE LEGISLATION,  I STILL BELIEVE THAT THIS
 LEGISLATION IS NOT A NECESSARY RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS MEMBERS OF
 THE CONGRESS- HAVE EXPRESSED ABOUT THE OVERSIGHT OF COVERT ACTION.
 AS YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT RECOGNIZED LAST YEAR THAT THERE WAS
 ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE WAY THE TWO BRANCHES WERE MEETING
 THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.   AS A RESULT, HE TOOK CONCRETE,
 SUBSTANTIAL STEPS TO ESTABLISH IMPROVED PROCEDURES.TO ENSURE THAT
 CONGRESS IS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY ITS APPROPRIATE
 OVERSIGHT ROLE.   THESE NEW PROCEDURES,  IN THE FORM OF A NATIONAL
 SECURITY DECISION DIRECTIVE ON SPECIAL ACTIVITIES (NSDD-286), MUCH
 OF WHICH HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED, CLARIFY THE RULES BY WHICH COVERT
 ACTIONS ARE REVIEWED,  APPROVED, AND REPORTED TO CONGRESS.   IN
 FACT, MANY OF THE PROPOSALS CONTAINED IN H.R.  3822 ARE ALREADY
 CONTAINED  IN NSDD-286.   THIS CAN BE  ILLUSTRATED BY MAKING A FEW
 COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE BILL AND THE PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE.
 --THE BILL REQUIRES THAT FINDINGS BE. IN WRITING, CANNOT BE
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7  13
 MADE RETROACTIVE.  AND MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING LAW.
 SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS ARE CONTAINED IN THE NSDD.
 --THE BILL MAKES CLEAR THAT A PRESIDENTIAL FINDING MUST BE
 OBTAINED BEFORE ANY AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT CAN CONDUCT A COVERT
 ACTION.   THE PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE AFFIRMS THIS PRINCIPLE.
 --THE BILL REQUIRES THAT A PRESIDENTIAL FINDING SPECIFY THE
 NAMES OF-EACH DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY OF THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT THAT
 IS FUNDING OR PARTICIPATING IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY IN A COVERT
 ACTION,  AND WHETHER IT  IS CONTEMPLATED THAT ANY THIRD PARTY
 WILL BE USED TO FUND OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN A SIGNIFICANT
 WAY IN THE COVERT ACTION.  AGAIN, THE PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE
 CONTAINS THE SAME REQUIREMENT.
 IT IS NOT SURPRISING OR COINCIDENTAL THAT PROVISIONS OF THE
 BILL ARE SIMILAR TO THE PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE.   THE PROCEDURES
 THE PRESIDENT HAS INSTALLED WERE DEVELOPED FOLLOWING CLOSE AND
 PROLONGED CONSULTATION WITH MEMBERS AND STAFFS OF THE INTELLIGENCE
 COMMITTEES.    .
 WHILE A PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE  IS NOT THE SAME AS LEGISLATION,
 I AM NOT PERSUADED THAT NEW LEGISLATION AT THIS TIME  IS THE BEST
 WAY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT MEMBERS HAVE WITH THE
 CONGRESSIONAL ROLE REGARDING SPECIAL ACTIVITIES.   IN MY VIEW,.A
 LEGISLATIVE REMEDY SHOULD BE EMPLOYED ONLY IF IT IS CLEAR THAT
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 I
 THERE IS A BASIC DEFICIENCY IN THE OVERSIGHT PROCESS.  THAT IS
 DOUBLY THE CASE WHEN THE LEGISLATIVE REMEDY PROPOSED -RAISES
 CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THAT THREATEN TO DIVIDE THE TWO BRANCHES IN
 AN AREA WHERE EFFECTIVE WORK PLACES A PREMIUM ON COOPERATION.
 THE  IRAN/CONTRA.. MATTER, WHILE SERIOUS, HAS NOT IN MY VIEW
 DEMONSTRATED THAT THE SYSTEM OF CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OF THE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ESTABLISHED UNDER CURRENT STATUTES IS
 .SERIOUSLY FLAWED.   MANY OF THE PROBLEMS EXPOSED WERE THE RESULT OF
 OFFICIALS FAILING TO FOLLOW EXISTING PROCEDURES AND RULES.   AS YOU
 MAY BE AWARE,  I HAVE TAKEN STEPS WITHIN THE CIA TO DISCIPLINE
 THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO FAILED TO FOLLOW CIA PROCEDURES OR WHO
 TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS IN A MANNER THAT WAS NOT CANDID OR
 COMPLETE.   THOSE ACTIONS. TAKEN IN LIGHT OF THE REQUIREMENTS
 DEFINED BY CURRENT STATUTE.  IN MY VIEW HAVE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED
 THE PROBLEMS WE FOUND.   SIMILARLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE WERE
 ANY PROCEDURAL SHORTCOMINGS DEMONSTRATED BY THE IRAN/CONTRA
 MATTER, THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN-ADDRESSED BY THE NEW PRESIDENTIAL
 DIRECTIVE WITHIN THE PRESENT STATUTORY FRAMEWORK.
 I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT ANY LEGISLATION THAT IS ENACTED
 SHOULD NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY'S ABILITY
 TO-DO ITS JOB.   IN THIS CONNECTION, MR. CHAIRMAN, THE BILL PASSED
 BY THE SENATE IN MARCH AND THE BILL MARKED UP BY THE HOUSE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAVE ADDRESSED CONSTRUCTIVELY SOME OF THE
 IMPORTANT SUBSTANTIVE CONCERNS I AND OTHER ADMINISTRATION

 OFFICIALS RAISED WITH THE ORIGINAL SENATE BILL INTRODUCED IN THAT
 BODY.   BOTH THE HOUSE AND SENATE BILLS, FOR EXAMPLE, RECOGNIZE THE
 NEED TO REPORT ON SPECIAL ACTIVITIES AND INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION
 IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH DUE REGARD FOR THE PROTECTION OF
 SENSITIVE  INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND METHODS.   I AM ALSO PLEASED
 THAT NEITHER BILL REQUIRES THAT THE-FINDING SPECIFY THE IDENTITY
 OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES ASSISTING THE AGENCY IN THE CONDUCT OF COVERT
 ACTION.   THESE IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDSWILL IN MY VIEW GO A LONG WAY
 IN ASSURING FRIENDLY  INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND POTENTIAL AGENTS
 THAT SOURCE-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WILL NOT BE WIDELY
 DISSEMINATED AND POSSIBLY COMPROMISED.
 I AM ALSO VERY PLEASED WITH THE CHANGES IN THE ORGINAL HOUSE
 VERSION OF THE BILL, MADE BY THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE  IN
 RESPONSE TO CONCERNS I RAISED BEFORE THAT COMMI-TTEE.   MY
 RESERVATIONS REGARDED THE DEFINITION OF COVERT ACTION, THE
 EXPENDITURE OF NON-APPROPRIATED FUNDS AND THE REPORTING OF THE
 TRANSFER OF DEFENSE ARTICLES OR SERVICES.   IN PARTICULAR, THE NEW
 DEFINITION OF COVERT ACTION REMOVES MUCH OF THE AMBIGUITY OVER
 WHAT CONSTITUTES A COVERT ACTION AND IS IN MY VIEW A DISTINCT
 IMPROVEMENT OVER THE CURRENT DEFINITIONS.

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7_6
 COMMITTEES, THERE IS ONE AREA OF THE BILL THAT REMAINS
 PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME.  THIS AREA OF DIFFICULTY INVOLVES THE
 PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT REQUIRES. NOTIFICATION OF A COVERT:-
 ACTION TO CONGRESS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, WITHIN 48 HOURS AFTER THE
 SIGNING OF A FINDING.  LAST SUMMER, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
 PROVIDED THE CONGRESS WITH ITS VIEWS ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF
 SUCH A PROVISION, SO I WILL NOT ADDRESS THAT ISSUE HERE.   I HAVE
 TWO SEPARATE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROVISION.
 FIRST, THE FACT THAT THERE IS A- SHARP DIFFERENCE OF
 INTERPRETATION BETWEEN THE VIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE
 POSITION EMBODIED IN THIS BILL REGARDING THIS PROVISION'S
 CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY WILL PROMOTE TENSION BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE
 AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES FOR YEARS TO COME.   IN THE INTELLIGENCE
 AREA SUCH TENSION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT THE COOPERATION AND
 TRUST THAT EFFECTIVE NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY REQUIRES.
 SECOND,  I BELIEVE THAT AS A PRACTICABLE MATTER ALLOWANCE MUST
 BE MADE FOR THAT RARE CASE WHERE A LIMITED DELAY.IN CONGRESSIONAL
 NOTIFICATION IS CRITICAL TO PRESERVE THE ABSOLUTE SECURITY. OF AN
 OPERATION WHEN, FOR EXAMPLE, LIVES ARE AT STAKE.   IN SUCH ARARE
 CASE,  THE SUCCESS OF AN OPERATION MAY DEPEND ON THE COOPERATION OF
 A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT THAT HAS CONDITIONED ITS SUPPORT ON THE
 PRESIDENT DELAYING CONGRESSIONAL. NOTIFICATION UNTIL THE OPERATION
 IS COMPLETED.   AN INFLEXIBLE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT COULD FORCE
 A PRESIDENT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PROVIDING THE CONGRESSIONALLY

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7   17
 OF INNOCENT AMERICANS, OR DELAYING THAT NOTIFICATION TO PROTECT
 THOSE LIVES.   I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY ANY PRESIDENT WOULD BE
 RELUCTANT TO AGREE TO A LAW THAT WOULD REQUIRE SUCH CHOICES.
 IT  IS WORTHWHILE TO NOTE THAT CONCERNS ABOUT EXCESSIVE DELAY
 IN CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION OF A SPECIAL ACTIVITY HAVE ALREADY
 BEEN ADDRESSED BY NSDD 286.   THAT DIRECTIVE . REQUIRES THE NATIONAL
 SECURITY PLANNING GROUP TO REEVALUATE AT LEAST EVERY 10 DAYS A
 DECISION TO. DELAY CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION OF A GIVEN FINDING.
 THIS WILL ENSURE THAT WHEN A DELAY IN NOTIFICATION IS NECESSARY,
 THE REASON FOR THAT DECISION WILL BE CONTINUALLY REASSESSED BY
 RESPONSIBLE SENIOR OFFICERS OF SEVERAL AGENCIES OR DEPARTMENTS SO
 THAT THE DELAY WILL BE AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE.   I  REPEAT,-HOWEVER,
 THAT I CAN THINK OF FEW CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD EVER NECESSITATE
 SUCH EXTRAORDINARY STEPS.
 IF THE COMMITTEE SHOULD NEVERTHELESS DECIDE THAT LEGISLATION
 IS NECESSARY TO LIMIT THE PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY TO DELAY
 NOTIFICATION,  I-WOULD URGE MEMBERS TO GIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION
 TO LANGUAGE CONTAINED IN A BILL PROPOSED BY RANKING MINORITY
 MEMBER BROOMFIELD THAT WOULD ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO DELAY
 NOTIFICATION IF HE DETERMINES THAT AN EMERGENCY CONSTITUTING A
 GRAVE AND IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE   NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED
 STATES EXISTS.   WHILE SUCH A STANDARD MAY NOT COVER ALL SITUATIONS
 WHERE LIVES ARE AT STAKE,  IT WOULD ALLOW THE PRESIDENT THE

 ALTHOUGH NOT DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE LEGISLATION BEFORE THIS
 COMMITTEE,  I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO ADDRESS
 A CONCERN I UNDERSTAND SOME MEMBERS HAVE WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS BY
 THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE TO INTELLIGENCE  INFORMATION.   IN MY
 VIEW,  THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE DOES HAVE A LEGITIMATE NEED
 FOR INFORMATION ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS AROUND THE WORLD.    SOME OF
 THIS  INFORMATION IS CLASSIFIED.   OUR BEST INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS
 ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS CAN
 PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE`COMMITTEE DOING ITS WORK PROPERLY.
 I BELIEVE THE RECORD WILL SHOW THAT THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
 AGENCY HAS,  IN FACT, BEEN RESPONSIVE TO THE REQUEST OF THE
 COMMITTEE FOR SUCH INFORMATION.    SOME RECENT STATISTICS HELP TO
 ILLUSTRATE THIS POINT.   DURING THE PERIOD FROM 1986 TO THE'
 PRESENT,  THERE HAVE BEEN 48 STAFF BRIEFINGS, 68 MEMBER BRIEFINGS,
 AND 14 APPEARANCES BEFORE THE COMMITTEE INVOLVING FORMAL
 TESTIMONY.   TO THE CONGRESS AS A WHOLE, CIA NOW PROVIDES MORE THAN
 1,000 BRIEFINGS PER YEAR.   LISTENING TO THESE BRIEFINGS TAKES A
 GREAT DEAL OF VALUABLE TIME ON YOUR PART, SO I GATHER YOU FIND
 THEM USEFUL.

 THE SUBSTANCE OF THE  INFORMATION CONVEYED BY THE AGENCY TO THE
 CONGRESS HAS RANGED FROM PRETRIP BRIEFINGS ON PARTICULAR COUNTRIES
 FOR MEMBERS TO FORMAL TESTIMONY ON THE, DISASTER AT CHERNOBYL OR
 TERRORISM IN GENERAL.   IN ADDITION.  THE COMMITTEE HAS ACCESS TO
 THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DAILY. OUR NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
 ESTIMATES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER INTELLIGENCE PUBLICATIONS.
 I WOULD URGE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WHO ARE  INTERESTED IN
 OBTAINING MORE  INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
 ACCESS OF THE COMMITTEE TO THIS-WEALTH OF INFORMATION.
 WHILE I BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN RESPONSIVE TO THE COMMITTEE'S
 REQUEST FOR INTELLIGENCE  INFORMATION.  I HOPE THAT YOU WILL
 UNDERSTAND MY NEED TO PROTECT FROM DISCLOSURE OPERATIONAL
 INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION THAT MIGHT JEOPARDIZE OUR SOURCES AND
 METHODS FOR GATHERING THIS INFORMATION.   WHEN THIS INFORMATION IS
 COMPROMISED. NOT ONLY IS THE PARTICULAR SOURCE OF  INTELLIGENCE
 LOST TO THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT. BUT OTHERS BECOME RELUCTANT TO
 COOPERATE FOR FEAR THEIR IDENTITIES WILL ALSO BE DISCLOSED.   IN
 SOME CASES  IT MAY BE ADVISABLE TO DISCLOSE SENSITIVE OPERATIONAL
 INFORMATION IN. ORDER FOR CONGRESS TO CONDUCT EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT.
 A DECISION WAS MADE BY CONGRESS ITSELF  IN 1980 TO LIMIT THIS TYPE
 OF  INFORMATION TO THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES.   THIS DECISION WAS
 A WISE ONE.' AND I WOULD STRONGLY OPPOSE ANY PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE
 NUMBER OF CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DIRECTLY   INVOLVED IN
 INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT.

 ACCESS TO COVERT ACTION INFORMATION
 IN ADDITION TO THE QUESTION OF ACCESS TO INTELLIGENCE  '
 INFORMATION IN GENERAL.  I UNDERSTAND SOME MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED
 THAT THE THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE  IS. NOT BEING BRIEFED ON
 COVERT ACTIONS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN POLICY IMPLICATIONS.
 UNDER EXISTING LAW AND THE INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT BILL BEING
 CONSIDERED BY THIS COMMITTEE.  ACCESS TO COVERT ACTION INFORMATION
 IS CONFINED TO THE  INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES-AND THE
 DEFENSE SUBCOMMITTEES OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES.   I DO NOT
 BELIEVE-IT  IS'NECESSARY OR WISE TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF COMMITTEES
 TO WHICH WE MUST REPORT COVERT ACTIONS.   TO DO SO WOULD SIMPLY
 RETURN US TO THE SITUATION EXISTING BEFORE THE INTELLIGENCE
 OVERSIGHT ACT OF 1980 WHEN WE HAD TO PROVIDE-COVERT ACTION
 INFORMATION TO EIGHT COMMITTEES OF CONGRESS.   THIS SITUATION MADE
 IT ALMOST  IMPOSSIBLE TO CONDUCT COVERT ACTION COVERTLY.
 I BELIEVE THAT-THE CONCERN EXPRESSED BY SOME REGARDING THE
 LACK'OF COMMITTEE ACCESS TO COVERT ACTION INFORMATION MAY BE THE
 RESULT OF A MISPERCEPTION AS TO HOW COVERT ACTION RELATES TO OUR
 FOREIGN POLICY.   COVERT ACTION IS IMPLEMENTATION-BY CLANDESTINE
 MEANS OF THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.   OUR
 FOREIGN POLICY IS FORMULATED BY THE. PRESIDENT AND THE SECRETARY OF
 STATE.

 THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE SHOULD NOT MAKE FOREIGN
 POLICY OR USE COVERT ACTION AS A VEHICLE FOR CREATING A SECRET
 FOREIGN POLICY.   BECAUSE THE SECRETARY OF STATE  IS OBLIGATED TO
 KEEP THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE INFORMED OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY,
 I BELIEVE THAT THE COMMITTEE DOES HAVE THE NECESSARY MEANS TO MAKE
 ITS VIEWS KNOWN REGARDING FOREIGN POLICY,  INCLUDING THOSE SPECIFIC
 POLICIES BEING IMPLEMENTED BY A COVERT ACTION.
 IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE ARRANGEMENT I HAVE DESCRIBED IS NOT
 ADEQUATE TO ENSURE THAT THE VIEWS OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS. COMMITTEE
 ARE REPRESENTED IN THE OVERSIGHT OF COVERT ACTION,  I WOULD SUGGEST
 CONGRESS CONSIDER GREATER USE OF CROSS-OVER MEMBERSHIP BETWEEN THE
 FOREIGN, AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.
 SUCH CROSS-OVER_MEMBERS ARE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE POSITION TO
 EXPRESS.THE VIEWS OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE IN DELIBERATIONS
 CONDUCTED BY THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.   SOME OF YOU. NOW
 SERVE OR HAVE  IN THE PAST SERVED VERY EFFECTIVELY IN THIS WAY.
 IN CLOSING,  I WOULD LIKE TO REEMPHASIZE TO EACH OF YOU MY
 PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO MAKING THE OVERSIGHT PROCESS WORK.   IT HAS
 ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR,  AND RECENT EXPERIENCE HAS AGAIN DEMONSTRATED,-
 THAT THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FOREIGN POLICY OF OUR GOVERNMENT,
 INCLUDING COVERT ACTION, CAN ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THE EXECUTIVE
 AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT WORK TOGETHER IN AN
 ATMOSPHERE OF MUTUAL RESPECT AND TRUST.   THIS SPIRIT OF
 COOPERATION CAN ONLY OCCUR IF THE CONGRESS RECEIVES THE

 STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL H. ARMACOST,.UNDER
 SECRETARY FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF STATE
 Mr. ARMACOST. Mr. Chairman, it is a privilege to appear before
 the committee on this sensitive subject. I am particularly pleased
 to be here with my colleague, Bill Webster. He has given authorita-
 tive testimony on behalf of the Administration. The Department of
 State obviously concurs fully in that testimony, as in some of the
 comments Mr. Broomfield made by way of introducing the subject.
 Rather than reading my testimony, I submit it for the record and
 am ready to answer your questions.
 Chairman FASCELL. Without objection, your entire testimony will
 be included in the record, Mr. Secretary.
 We thank you.
 [The prepared statement of Mr. Armacost follows:]

 PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL H. ARMACOST
 Thank you for the opportunity to appear today to present
 the views of the Department of State on the Intelligence
 Oversight Act, as marked up by the House Permanent Select
 Committee on Intelligence.
 Since last December, I have had the opportunity to testify
 twice on the issue of oversight legislation.
 During this period, significant changes have been made to
 the bill which this committee is now considering.   Many of the
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 25
 specific objections made by the Administration have been
 addressed, including in particular problems regarding the
 protection of sources and methods and the naming of foreign
 countries in findings.   We are pleased that changes have been
 made to accommodate many of our concerns.
 Nonetheless, we regret that our most serious objections
 regarding this bill remain.   These objections cause us to
 oppose the bill, and the President's senior advisers will
 recommend he veto this bill if it is presented in its current
 form.
 Our most fundamental objections remain the absolute and
 rigid requirement to notify Congress within 48 hours of the
 adoption of a written, finding, combined with the deletion of
 the references in present law to the constitutional authorities
 of the executive and legislative branches.   The President's
 National Security Decision Directive 286 on covert action
 (declassified last December) requires that findings now be
 reported to Congress within 48 hours of signature except in
 quite extraordinary situations.   A decision to delay
 notification must be reviewed by the President's senior
 advisers at least once every ten days.   We believe that the
 NSDD establishes a sound procedure and provides the kind of
 flexibility that is necessary in the execution of U.S. foreign
 policy.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 26
 In our view, the absolute 48-hour requirement may not be
 reasonable in those very rare instances where extremely
 sensitive operations require the tightest possible security to
 protect the lives of U.S. and foreign nationals.   It is
 possible that the success of an operation may depend on the
 cooperation of a foreign government that has conditioned its
 support on delaying notification of an operation.  The 1980
 Iran rescue mission and the role of the Canadian Embassy in
 assisting our people in Iran are specific cases in the past
 where advance notification could not be given.   It is my
 understanding that these two cases constitute, apart from the
 Iran finding of January 1986, the only cases since the
 enactment of the Hughes-Ryan Amendment of 1974 in which the
 Executive Branch did not inform the Congress in advance of a
 planned covert action.'
 In addition, the Justice Department has concluded that the
 48-hour requirement would infringe upon the President's
 constitutional authority.   The Justice Department has testified
 on this matter before the Senate, and has informed the HPSCI of
 this conclusion in writing.   This fundamental constitutional
 objection to the bill remains.
 There is one other Administration objection to this bill
 which I believe is not fully appreciated by many in Congress.

 1                                  27
 In our view, there is a need for Congress and the Executive to
 work together closely on intelligence matters, and to provide
 mutual trust in handling sensitive intelligence issues.   The
 Iran-Contra affair obviously put great strains on the
 relationship between our two branches in this field.   This
 episode is now behind us.   The President has taken decisive
 action to ensure that there will not be a repetition of that
 unfortunate affair.
 The procedures established by NSDD 286 are working well and
 will ensure that covert actions are decided upon in a proper
 manner, taking into account all relevant factors.   With the
 exception of the rigid 48-hour rule, NSDD 286 incorporates the
 significant changes to existing law reflected in H.R. 3822.
 The problem that we both face at this time is not inadequacy in
 the law but, rather, the need to restore confidence and trust.
 We do not believe the solution is to pass a bill which could
 rekindle confrontation over a basic constitutional issue, as
 would be the case if H.R. 3822 were to be enacted.   Instead, we
 recommend a genuine partnership that will enable Judge Webster
 and other senior officials charged with reforming intelligence
 procedures the chance to make their reforms work.   We see this
 as operating to the mutual advantage of the Congress and the
 Executive Branch.   We therefore .urge the Committee not to
 recommend adoption of this legislation.

 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GATHERING INTELLIGENCE AND COVERT
 OPERTIONS
 Chairman FASCELL: Mr. Director, we have a clear understanding,
 do we not, on the difference between the function of gathering in-
 telligence and covert operations?
 Judge WEBSTER. I think we do, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Do you want to tell us in very brief terms
 what that difference is, please?
 Judge WEBSTER. The intelligence gathering or collection responsi-
 bility is to develop by a number of means-human intelligence, sig-
 nals intelligence, national collection means, satellites in space-in-
 formation about what is going on in other parts of the world as ac-
 curately and completely as we can and to present it, an analysis of
 that information, in such form that our policy makers can make
 wise decisions in the interests of our national security.
 Covert action on the other hand represents activities beyond the
 collection of information intended to implement the foreign policy
 of this country in areas in which normal diplomatic means have
 not been successful or are not likely to succeed.
 The implementation of covert action, which can range anything
 in the way from political action to lethal support for activities in
 other parts of the world are approved through a formal process
 originating initially within the Central Intelligence Agency, pass-
 ing through the National Security Council, to the President who
 finds that such action is required and in the interests of national
 security, and then that finding is communicated to the Congress.
 But it is to implement the established foreign policy of the Gov-
 ernment by other means.
 Chairman FASCELL. Now this legislation does not affect the flexi-
 bility or the authority to conduct intelligence activities, does it?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. So that under the basic law, whatever au-
 thority the President has or whatever authority has been delegated
 to you continues unaffected; is that correct?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. And the intelligence reports or estimates or
 analyses that are made available to the Congress under the present
 law are made available to the Intelligence Committee as a matter
 of course; is that correct?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct. I think it is also consistent with
 legislation that requires that the intelligence committees be kept
 timely informed of all significant intelligence activities.
 Chairman FASCELL. And, therefore, the Intelligence Committee,
 having the primary responsibility for oversight of the intelligence
 community, has that relationship?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. But that relationship does not exist with any
 other committee of the Congress, does it, under the present law?
 Judge WEBSTER. If I understand your question, Mr. Chair-
 man--
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Chairman FASCELL. In other words, when the CIA. or other intel-
 ligence agencies report to the Congress, they report to the over-
 sight committee, do they not?
 Judge WEBSTER. They do, Mr. Chairman, with respect to signifi-
 cant intelligence activities and with respect to oversight. But, as I
 pointed out in my statement, we are responsive to requests for in-
 formation by committees and individual Members of Congress.
 Chairman FASCELL. And you have been. The Agency has always
 cooperated.
 Judge WEBSTER:. We try to be.
 Chairman FASCELL: All I am pointing out on the record is where
 the official legal responsibility lies.
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman-FASCELL. As far as oversight on intelligence-gathering
 is concerned.
 Now, just give us a rough estimate, if you will-I don't mean
 either in quantitative terms, that is, dollars, or in personnel or any
 other identifiable criteria, but maybe some kind of a percentage
 figure, or take a number from 1 to 10.
 What would you say your intelligence-related responsibility is.
 What number? What factor would you give it on a scale of 1 to 10?
 Judge WEBSTER. Mr. Chairman, do you mean in relation to covert
 action?
 Chairman FASCELL. No, sir. First just intelligence-gathering.
 See, you have two principal functions, as I see it. One is intelli-
 gence-gathering; the other is the implementation of foreign policy
 by covert action.
 Judge WEBSTER. I think I understand your question.
 Chairman FASCELL. How much, on a scale of 1 to 10, do you take
 in time, effort, personnel, money, et cetera, to do your intelligence-
 gathering, and how much do you take with regard to your covert
 operations?
 Judge WEBSTER. Covert action requires about 3 percent of our re-
 sources.
 Chairman FASCELL. So, 97 percent of your resources, by whatever
 measurement, more or less-and I am not trying to establish a spe-
 cific-is spent on intelligence-gathering, which is your primary
 function?
 Judge WEBSTER. Gathering and analysis, yes.
 Chairman FASCELL. And dissemination within the Government to
 the proper authorized people?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. This bill does not touch that in any way?
 Judge WEBSTER. No, it does not.
 Chairman FASCELL. So we are dealing with 3 percent of your ac-
 tivity; that is covert operation. That means, according to your defi-
 nition, something other than intelligence-gathering. It' has to do
 with the implementation of a foreign policy decision?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Now, in that case, the present law-not this
 bill-the present law requires you ?to notify whom?
 Judge WEBSTER. In reference to covert action?
 Chairman FASCELL. Yes, sir.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 30
 Judge WEBSTER. It requires that the Intelligence Committees be
 notified, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. And the law says in timely fashion, does it
 not?
 Judge WEBSTER. Yes, it does.
 Chairman FASCELL. That is a subjective judgment left to the
 President?
 Judge WEBSTER. My reading of the legislative history at the time
 was that it was purposefully flexible or ambiguous and it is in the
 President's discretion, but I do not believe it is in his uncontrolled
 discretion.
 Chairman FASCELL. Well, I like that phrase. I don't know how
 you can control a president. We have tried, goodness knows.
 But it does say in a timely fashion. I would assume, although
 reading the language, that would mean whatever the President de-
 cides is timely. Don't you agree?
 Judge WEBSTER. I think it comes pretty close to that. But certain-
 ly when there is substantial disagreement with that conclusion, at
 some point that decision is reviewed. But at least initially it is his
 call.
 Chairman FASCELL. But the only place that a difference of opin-
 ion could exist with respect to that decision is within the Adminis-
 tration itself, because nobody else knows anything about it; isn't
 that correct?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is true, until it becomes known.
 NSDD DIRECTION 286
 Chairman FASCELL. Yes. Well, you know, we don't run any news-
 papers. It is very tough for us to leak anything.
 All right. Let's talk about NSDD Directive 286, which is an effort
 to correct some of the things that have concerned Members of Con-
 gress and an effort on the part of the Administration to tighten
 down with respect to the question of oversight and knowledge and
 consultation with regard to an operation by the intelligence com-
 munity as distinguished from a normal intelligence-gathering func-
 tion.
 The directive is a directive issued by the President, is it not?
 Judge WEBSTER. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. As you pointed out in your testimony, it cer-
 tainly is different from a law.
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Those directives are normally highly classi-
 fied, are they not?
 Judge WEBSTER. Normally they are. This one is substantially de-
 classified.
 Chairman FASCELL. Well, that is so Congress would know you are
 making changes?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct.
 Chairman FASCELL. And therefore you undertook to give this a
 minimum of classification, to get the information out?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct.
 Chairman FASCELL. There is nothing wrong with that. I like that.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7   31
 But generally speaking, with regard to operations that would
 occur under a national security directive, the directive itself would
 be highly classified?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct.
 Chairman FASCELL. To whom, to what committee of the Con-
 gress, would that directive normally go, if it goes to anybody?
 Judge WEBSTER. It would normally go to the Intelligence Over-
 sight Committees.
 Chairman FASCELL. That is all; isn't that correct?
 Judge WEBSTER. So far as I know, that is correct.
 Chairman FASCELL. Now, the point you made about the fact that
 since Congress knows the policy, you directed that statement to
 this committee but you can enlarge it, since Congress knows what
 the policy is, as I understand the presumption in your testimony,
 why should Congress be concerned about. the implementation of the
 policy?
 Is that a fair restatement of what you are. saying?
 Judge WEBSTER. I am not sure that it is, Mr. Chairman. You are
 moving away from the NSDD onto a new subject. I want to be sure
 of that.
 Chairman FASCELL. I am just saying if the NSDD is simply a
 means by which you carry out the implementation of policy, and
 since the Congress knows about policy, we have all the information
 we need, why are we so concerned about implementation of policy.
 That is the way I read it. That is the impression I get from your
 testimony.
 Judge WEBSTER. No, I don't mean to imply that Congress has no
 concern with the,implementation of the policy. I think it has every
 right to be concerned and to be reassured through the Oversight
 Committees that the implementation is taking place.
 What I sought to say was that the NSDD goes beyond the exist-
 ing statute and represents a presidential commitment to keep the
 Congress informed in a way that the Congress will understand.
 Chairman FASCELL. I wasn't speaking of only this NSDD, I am
 just talking about NSDDs generally, when an.operation is about to
 take effect or even a finding pursuant to an NSDD and whether or
 not that in some way flows to the Congress, it is my understanding
 that it does not.
 I don't know how you get one of those, if it is highly classified. I
 assume-I don't know; I am not on the Intelligence Committee-I
 assume the Intelligence Committee, if they had some question
 about it or got a rumor or got a tip or whatever, they could ask to
 see one?
 Judge WEBSTER. Yes, indeed.
 Chairman FASCELL. But no other committee could have the bene-
 fit of that request because they have no oversight jurisdiction; is
 that correct?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct, Mr. Chairman. But, of course,
 we have the Appropriations Committee and the Armed Services
 Committee. We have other committees who have monetary inter-
 ests for which they require additional information. We try to
 supply it so they can make sound judgments.
 Chairman FASCELL. That is a pragmatic necessity, is it not?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct.

 Chairman FASCELL. From the standpoint of the operation of the
 department and the government. You better talk to the Appropria-
 tions Committee and you better talk to Defense, because they are
 your friends.
 I have a lot more, but I will stop now and let Mr. Broomfield
 take over for five minutes or so.
 BROOMFIELD AMENDMENT (NOTIFYING ONLY FOUR MEMBERS OF
 CONGRESS INSTEAD OF EIGHT)
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Director Webster, I want to thank you for the words of support
 in your testimony for my approach to congressional notification, es-
 pecially for sensitive covert operations.
 As you know, under the amendment I am going to be proposing
 to this bill, H.R. 3822, in markup next week, the President could in
 extraordinary circumstances notify only four leaders of Congress,
 rather than eight Members of Congress as currently provided.
 The President could also delay notification, but only in an emer-
 gency constituting a grave and immediate threat to the national se-
 curity. The President would also have to determine in writing that
 the situation requires postponing notification.
 Now, the first question I would like to ask you is: The adminis-
 tration has certainly improved the notification process since you
 became Director. Nevertheless, would the administration support
 what I would consider a higher standard if it also gives the Presi-
 dent some flexibility in difficult circumstances?
 Judge WEBSTER. I am sure that your bill addresses the primary
 concern of the Administration with respect to the flexibility that is
 needed for those very rare circumstances.
 I can't answer the constitutional question. I would have to defer
 that to the Justice Department.
 SITUATIONS THAT MAY REQUIRE INFORMATION BEING WITHHELD
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Director, what sort of circumstances would,
 in your view, constitute an emergency in which notification could
 be delayed under this approach?
 Judge WEBSTER. Under the approach in your proposed bill?
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Yes.
 Judge WEBSTER. Life-threatening situations, I believe, of major
 proportions, would clearly fall within the provisions of the bill.
 In trying to interpret it, I am unable to state with certainty
 whether an individual hostage situation would be covered by it.
 But certainly those situations in which major risk to American life
 was at stake would fall, I believe, within the provisions of your bill
 and could be justified on national security grounds.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Approximately, if you know, how many inci-
 dents in the last 12 years would come under this category?
 Judge WEBSTER. It is my understanding that we have had only
 three situations in which information has been withheld during
 that period of time. All three related to situations in Iran-two sit-
 uations at the time of the Iran hostage-taking a decade ago, and
 more recently in the Iran-Contra matter.

 Mr.  BROOMFIELD.  So this whole argument is really centering
 around-at least if you go back in history the last 12 or 15. years-
 about three instances?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. How long, in your judgment, would it be justi-
 fied to delay in such circumstances?
 Judge WEBSTER. Well, it has been my view that one way to ap-
 proach it is whether the need to inform becomes more compelling
 than the protection of the lives or other national interests at stake.
 I find it very difficult to measure it in terms of one day, two
 days, three days. I can think of very few situations in which more
 than a few days can be justified, but I can certainly think of at
 least one example in which deference would have to be given to the
 needs and wishes of foreign countries supplying important informa-
 tion of a life-saving nature on the condition that no others be in-
 formed, as was the case when the Canadians provided shelter for
 our citizens in Iran.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Judge Webster, do you agree it would be prefer-
 able, in the extraordinary circumstances mentioned in the act, to
 limit notification to the four congressional leaders of both Houses,
 rather than to the eight at present?
 Judge WEBSTER. With no disrespect for those who would be not
 included, any reduction in the number of people who need to be in-
 formed in order to provide the surrogate responsibility of Congress,
 I think is desirable.
 ELIMINATING THE 48-HOUR NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Now, the final question I want to ask you is,
 you generally agree that this is a pretty darned good bill overall; is
 that correct?
 Judge WEBSTER. Overall, with the exception of this provision.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. If the committee or the Congress-and we will
 probably have to try it on the Floor-if this 48-hour provision is
 taken out, in your judgment would the Administration support the
 bill?
 Judge WEBSTER. I know of no reason why the Administration
 would not support it. Indeed, General Powell's letter indicates that
 this is the Administration's problem with the bill. All of the other
 problems have been very constructively addressed in the process of
 debate.
 I would like to point out again how important I think the NSDD
 provision is, which is not in the bill but which I think really is the
 way you need to address these discretionary issues, the provision
 that requires reassessing it by the senior members of the National
 Security Council, the President, every ten days. That forces the
 issue out.
 I think it was in Iran-Contra where they put it away and didn't
 look at it for ten months. This requires every ten days a consider-
 ation of whether or not it is time to tell the Congress.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Armacost, do you agree with the position of
 the Administration that, if this 48-hour provision is deleted from
 the bill, in all probability the President would support it?

 Mr. ARMACOST. I can't speak for the President, but I think the
 senior advisors would support recommendation of the bill.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. I thank both of you for your testimony.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Hamilton?
 Mr. HAMILTON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We are
 very pleased to have these distinguished witnesses with us.
 Director Webster, I noticed your emphasis several times on limit-
 ed delay. You have that phrase in your statement when you are
 speaking about the notification provision.
 You have made changes and I think those changes have been sig-
 nificant and helpful. The question is: if a President of the United
 States wants to delay notice to the Congress under the present law
 and under the NSDD that you have described and if he wants to
 delay for a year, he could do so, could he not?
 Judge WEBSTER. He could. That is theoretically possible for him
 to do so. But I have never been able to formulate a circumstance
 that would justify that kind of delay and I cannot conceive of the
 process as laid down in the NSDD permitting that to happen, be-
 cause your senior advisors have got to go along with that, including
 the Director of Central Intelligence.
 Mr. HAMILTON. I appreciate that, Mr. Director. But the fact is
 the President did delay in one instance, in a very recent instance,
 for ten months, and he only then made it known to us after a Leba-
 nese newspaper revealed it.
 So, if a President wants to delay under the present procedures,
 he may do so, it seems to me, even with the review provision which
 you have cited, and that causes me a great deal of concern.
 I also wanted to check with you with regard to your handling of
 the NSDDs. You said a moment ago, I think, that those are made
 available to the Intelligence Committees. My recollection is that
 they are not made available to the Intelligence Committees.
 NSDD'S AVAILABILITY TO INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES
 Mr. ARMACOST. I think, as I understood it, Mr. Webster was re-
 ferring to findings--
 Mr. HAMILTON. Well, I may have misunderstood. My understand-
 ing was that you said NSDDs were made available to the Intelli-
 gence Committees. That may be the case now; it was not the case, I
 believe, when I was on the Intelligence Committee.
 Judge WEBSTER. Mr. Hamilton, you are probably correct on that,
 and I may have misspoken.
 Those are internal documents that relate to tasking of the Exec-
 utive Branch of Government. But it is still my understanding that
 key NSDDs that relate to foreign policies or intelligence matters
 are communicated in one form or another to the Intelligence Com-
 mittees, and I would be happy to respond more accurately on the
 record.
 ADMINISTRATION'S VIEW ON CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS OF THE
 PRESIDENT
 Mr. HAMILTON. Let me raise one other question. It is really the
 Justice Department's position, but also it is my understanding of
 the Administration's position is that it doesn't really matter what
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 35
 you put into this bill so far as notification is concerned, because the
 President has an inherent constitutional right to withhold informa-
 tion from the Congress. Now, that right may be more precisely de-
 fined as under extraordinary circumstances or something of the
 sort.
 But if that is the position of the Administration, that a president,
 no matter what this bill says, can withhold information and can
 withhold notice, then this bill becomes almost a nullity, doesn't it,
 given this view of the Administration?
 Judge WEBSTER. I am trying to avoid getting into the constitu-
 tional issue because I don't believe I am the proper person to raise
 that issue.
 There are other analogous situations, for instance, the Foreign
 Intelligence Surveillance Act, in which the Chief Executive did not
 acknowledge that he was bound to observe the requirements of the
 Phizer Statute but agreed to do so, and his successor has followed
 suit.
 So I don't know what the position of the Administration would
 be with respect to a constitutional issue if, in fact, the President
 signed such a bill.
 Mr. HAMILTON. Do you think I am misstating the Administra-
 tion's position with regard to the President's constitutional powers
 here?
 Judge WEBSTER. I don't think you are misstating it as far as the
 Administration's position with respect to his powers. I am not sure
 you have accurately stated the Administration's position if the bill
 is passed.
 Mr. HAMILTON. One other thing. It seems to me we have to look
 at this bill in the context in which it occurs. The context is that
 over a period of time we have had deep suspicions in this body
 about the operations of the Central Intelligence Agency-the resi-
 due of Iran-Contra, the lack of trust and all the rest-and I must
 say I think Mr. Broomfield is correct when he commends you for
 the work you have done, and I commend the President for the
 steps he has taken to try to correct these problems.
 But what stands out, when you look through the steps you have
 taken, is that all of them could be abolished with a signature from
 the President. The NSDD expires when the President's term ex-
 pires. He could change it tomorrow and not notify the Congress.
 We wouldn't know anything about it. He could just completely
 wipe out these changes that you have mentioned.
 So while I commend the Administration for the steps that have
 been taken, and you specifically for the steps you have taken, I am
 bothered that these changes could just be abolished at will, without
 the Congress ever knowing it.
 In that situation and in that context, it seems to me that a law is
 appropriate to deal with the problems we have had in the Congress
 with your agency and with the Administration. Like so many
 things that require a judgment, where you have to balance differ-
 ent factors, on the one hand you have got the bill which does put
 some restrictions on a President. He has got to notify within 48
 hours in this particular provision that concerns us. You have some
 harm-I suppose that some risk may be present from the fact that
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 36
 you make a disclosure to four or eight Members of the Congress.
 But I must say that that risk appears to me to be extremely small.
 If this bill provided that the administration has to notify 535
 Members of the Congress, I would agree with you. But what you
 are saying, in effect, is that we don't trust the leaders of the Con-
 gress, we do not trust the Speaker of the House, the Majority and
 Minority leaders, to keep information.
 That is an extraordinary claim. We are not talking about the
 rank and file Members of Congress here; we are talking about the
 leadership of the Congress, and a very few of them. That is the
 risk, on the one hand, and that has to be weighed against the value
 of consultation and independent advice that the President would
 receive if he gives prompt notice, prior notice in most cases, notice
 within 48 hours.
 I can recognize where there is a problem in balancing these
 risks, if you would, but also benefits. I just come down strongly on
 the side that the benefits, here outweigh what I see as small risks:
 the risk of leaking to respected leaders of Congress and the risk of
 the most minimal kind of restriction, it seems to me, on a Presi-
 dent's flexibility, and that is that he notify within 48 hours.
 JUDGE WEBSTER's POSITION ON 48-HOUR RULE
 Judge WEBSTER. Mr. Chairman, if I may respond to Congressman
 Hamilton's observations, I certainly do not, by my position on the
 48-hour rule, mean to imply any lack of trust in the leadership of
 Members who are presently covered by the statute. That is not my
 concern, even though I don't read in the statute any limit on their
 ability to further communicate anything that we communicate to
 them. So there is that possibility there.
 You do not really address, as I listen to you, the problem which
 is real, that others supplying us information may condition that in-
 formation on our not telling anyone else, as occurred in the Cana-
 dian situation.
 As I travel around the world-and I have visited 15 countries in
 the last year-the one concern they have as they look at our
 system is the ability to share information with us and under cir-
 cumstances where it will not be communicated elsewhere. I don't
 know what we do in that situation, which has already once oc-
 curred, where a country has declined to let us communicate. What
 do we do then?
 Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Director, I do not think we can let a third
 country dictate the constitutional processes of the United States
 Government.
 If a third country is going to say to us, we are only going to coop-
 erate with you under the following conditions, and these conditions
 we think run contrary to our view of how our government ought to
 operate, I don't think we can accept those kinds of conditions.
 If the Canadian Government's position in the case you are saying
 is we don't want to share information with the Congress-that was
 the way the Canadian Government stated that position-I agree
 with that position. I wouldn't want to share the information with
 the entire Congress either.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7_7
 But that is not what we are asking for here. We are asking for
 very, very limited notification by the President to a handful of
 people. If the Canadian Government or any other government says
 we are not going to give you this information because we don't
 trust these four leaders of the Congress, or eight leaders of the
 Congress, then I think that is a condition that is unacceptable to
 us.
 That is my attitude.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Leach.
 Mr. LEACH. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Let me just begin with the preface I think I share as much as
 any Member of Congress the concern that covert actions have been
 a little overused in the last several decades, and I also believe we
 ought to be pinpointing, as much as possible, accountability within
 Government.
 But I am troubled by aspects of the bill. The one is the 48-hour
 notification, and I think Judge Webster has indicated several very
 valid concerns; the second, which is a very interesting and novel
 departure that I would like your comments on, involves presiden-
 tial signatures.
 There are two dimensions of it: one, there is a requirement that
 the presidential finding be in writing and signed before action is
 commenced, and, second, there is a requirement that a copy of the
 finding bearing the president's signature be transmitted to Con-
 gress at the time of the notification.
 My concern is twofold on this signature issue. In the first in-
 stance it sounds like a very realistic way of demanding accountabil-
 ity within the Executive Branch, but on the second hand, because
 some of these types of operations have a dimension that isn't a
 happy one, that is, they are aggressive, you place the President of
 the United States on line as personally being the initiator, not the
 Government of the United States. It becomes a personalized act.
 When you have a personalized act rather than a government act,
 you might well have a temptation on the other side, if these things
 ever become . public, that you will have a personal response.
 Are you placing, for example, the President of the United States
 of America in a more vulnerable position to assassination?
 The second aspect is, you look at this very precise way of defin-
 ing accountability with the presidential signatures and notification
 to Congress-that is another place for the signatures to reside-I
 think there would be a tendency of the Executive Branch to move
 away from formulation in the formulation of policies, that is, there
 would be a tendency where it would be obvious in everybody's
 mind the Iran-Contra affair, where some of the discretion for
 action was taken away from an institutional bureaucracy, the one
 you headed, into a new bureaucracy within the National Security
 Council, and partly with the understanding that people in that en-
 vironment were told that we don't really want to know everything
 that is happening, just to get the job done..
 So what I am suggesting is do you have a problem with the sig-
 nature element? Is that a real thing from your perspective, or is
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7  38
 that a non-problem? And do you think that it should be modified in
 any way?
 Judge WEBSTER. We haven't taken a position on the signature
 problem. I think that that was an outgrowth of the Iran-Contra
 hearings and recommendations from various groups that looked at
 it and wanted to make certain that the President was in fact
 making a particular finding.
 It is a step back from some of the procedures that have been in
 place in the past to insulate the President from the kinds of ad-
 verse circumstances to which you refer.
 I am not aware that the President personally objects to those
 provisions.
 Mr. LEACH. Let me go on further.
 One of the things that has been indicated by several people earli-
 er, and I just think it can't be stressed enough, is this difference
 between the President's policies and procedures. This is an effort to
 change procedures, but the policies and the people have already
 been changed, and I think they are more important in this particu-
 lar instance.
 Everyone I know of has the deepest respect for what you are
 trying to do at the agency, and I think all of us have to acknowl-
 edge that. But I think we should recognize that implicit in this bill
 is something, a kind of presumption, that I am not convinced by.
 The presumption is that because several Members of Congress will
 be notified at some point in time, that these individual Members of
 Congress will bring a great deal of perspective to bear that will be
 very helpful.
 It is my sense that realistically if one were to put a restraint on
 covert operations, one would put a requirement, for example, that
 the Departments of State and Defense would have to sign off at the
 highest levels on each of these operations because that is where the
 kabosh occurs.
 I have never specifically known of an instance where the wisdom
 of Congress has put a kabosh on these instances. Congress has a
 tendency to be totally and utterly cooperative in these circum-
 stances.
 The signature issue, it strikes me, is one that is designed as a
 personal embarrassment to the President, either in an internation-
 al context or in a presidential campaign setting or partisan setting.
 So I have concerns about that.
 But most of all, I am concerned with the presumption that we
 are dealing with a problem by simply notifying a few people. I have
 never known that to occur.
 Do you have any experience that would indicate to you that that
 would likely deter serious decisionmaking within the Executive
 Branch?
 WOULD NOTIFYING A FEW LEADERS EFFECT THE DECISIONMAKING
 PROCESS
 Judge WEBSTER. Your question is whether notification--
 Mr. LEACH. Yes.
 Judge WEBSTER. In most situations I think we benefit from get-
 ting reactions of members of the Oversight Committees to particu-
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7  39
 lar findings. It is, in my view, a kind of insurance policy that what
 we are doing makes some sense. I am not talking about potential
 partisan differences, matters of disagreement with policies. But it
 is often helpful and reassuring to know that the professionals have
 not taken leave of the realities of day-to-day life, and I think the
 committees. have a potential to make a substantial contribution
 there.
 Whether the one or two people who are given the notice supply
 that additional wisdom is something I can't say, but at least we
 would be required to expose them to a reaction and we would have
 to listen to the reaction, although it might not change the result.
 Mr. LEACH. Well, Mr. Armacost, as to some institutional checks
 and balances that occur on covert decisionmaking within the Exec-
 utive Branch, do you think it would be realistic to attempt to
 modify this legislation in any way, to legislatively prescribe that
 the Department of State be integrally involved in covert decision-
 making?
 Mr. ARMACOST. I believe, Mr. Leach, an earlier version of the
 House bill did include an effort to specify the Executive agencies
 that had to be involved in the decision, and we took exception to
 that on constitutional grounds, and that it was inappropriate for
 Congress to identify those elements within the Executive Branch
 that had to be involved in a presidential decision.
 I would only add that the changes now in the Executive Branch
 procedures that Director Webster described I think have assured
 against the kind of problem that occurred in the. Iran-Contra epi-
 sode, where the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense were
 not involved subsequent to earlier deliberations, did not see the
 finding in written form and therefore to some degree lost the op-
 portunity to inject balance and foreign policy contributions as the
 program was implemented.
 We do believe the procedures have had a salutary effect.
 Mr. LEACH. I would just ask for one request, if I could. Could you
 respond in writing to the committee on your consideration of the
 signature issue and whether or not you believe it should be modi-
 fied in any way?
 Mr. ARMACOST. Surely.
 Judge WEBSTER. We will do that.l
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Solarz.
 NUMBER OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH PEOPLE INVOLVED IN ISSUING A
 FINDING
 Mr. SOLARZ. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
 Judge Webster, are you in a position to let us know, generally
 speaking, how many people within the Executive Branch are in-
 volved in the process of advising the President with respect to
 whether or not to issue a finding, and how many people in the Ex-
 ecutive Branch, generally speaking, are aware that a particular
 finding has been issued?
 Judge WEBSTER. If I can walk you through a typical example,
 normally the covert actions do not originate within the Central In-
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10:
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7z3
 telligence Agency. They are usually requested, although not in spe-
 cifics, through another branch, but most likely the State Depart-
 ment, when normal overt foreign policy efforts are not adequate to
 achieve the foreign policy objective.
 We then internally develop some ideas and stratagems which are
 vented through a subgroup of the National Security Council called
 the Policy Coordination Group, the PCG, which includes senior
 members of key departments, Defense, State and so on. That is a
 very small group. Then it comes back for a refining. A finding is
 prepared within the Central Intelligence Agency and is submitted
 to the National Security Council Planning Group, consisting of the
 heads of the major departments.
 All of these are people who know, if that is what you are saying.
 Mr. SOLARZ. That includes the President, Vice President, Secre-
 tary of State, Secretary of Defense, the DCI--
 Judge WEBSTER. Joint Chiefs of Staff and Attorney General
 and--
 Mr. SOLARZ. So at a minimum they are all aware that a finding
 has been issued, if it has been issued?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct.
 Mr. SOLARZ. Mr. Armacost, let me ask you, is it your impression
 that when a finding is under consideration-and the Secretary of
 State is, of course, a part of this National Security, Planning
 Group-is it generally his practice when he goes back to the De-
 partment to consult with the key people within the State Depart-
 ment who would be in a position to bring relevant judgment to
 bear on the merit of this proposed finding, in order to determine
 whether they think this is in the best interests of the country? Or
 does he handle this exclusively by himself, without any effort what-
 soever to solicit advice from relevant people within the Depart-
 ment?
 Mr. ARMACOST. No, no. He would normally consult a handful of
 people.
 Mr. SOLARZ. So if the Secretary of State consults a handful of
 people, the Secretary of Defense does also, and so on and so forth,
 which means that exclusive of who knows or who doesn't know in
 the Congress, there is a not insubstantial number of people within
 the Executive Branch who are aware of these findings.
 Judge Webster, based on your experience, do you think that the
 Executive Branch is from time to time responsible for leaks con-
 cerning covert activities?
 Judge WEBSTER. Well--
 Mr. SOLARZ. Or do you think the leaks that have taken place em-
 anate only from Congress?
 Judge WEBSTER. Well, clearly the Executive Branch has supplied
 a number of leakers, at least equal to those in Congress.
 If you ask it with respect to covert actions, I have no specific
 knowledge that comes to me at the moment. I would not be sur-
 prised to find that there have been those on the Executive Branch
 who have given away some information about covert actions.

 Mr. SOLARZ. I understand that your predecessor, Mr. Casey, indi-
 cated in his view that the Executive Branch was responsible for
 many leaks in the House Intelligence Committee, which had an im-
 peccable record, I am told, in not divulging this information in an
 unauthorized fashion.
 But I would like to ask you a question about what seems to me to
 be the gravamen of your objection to this bill. You point to the
 problem that might be created if a foreign government whose coop-
 eration we seek in some kind of covert activity were to say to us
 that its willingness to cooperate is contingent upon our not notify-
 ing the Congress, even though under this legislation congressional
 notification is limited to a handful of congressional leaders. There-
 fore, this legislation might potentially render the cooperation of
 this country impossible to obtain.
 The problem I have with that argument, which has been ex-
 plained very eloquently by Mr. Hamilton, is that we would be per-
 mitting a foreign government to determine how we conduct our in-
 ternal procedures.
 But supposing that same government said to us, "Look, the State
 Department leaks like a sieve. There are dozens of examples of re-
 ports in the press that were supposed to be confidential that come
 from the State Department. We are willing to cooperate with you
 but only if the Secretary of State is cut out of the loop, because if
 he is included, he is going to consult with people in his Department
 and information will be leaked." Maybe the same thing will be said
 one day about the Secretary of Defense, and maybe there are leaks
 from the office of the Vice President. I have even heard it said that
 from time to time there are leaks on the NSC.
 Now, under the logic which you have advanced against this bill,
 which would require consultation with a limited number of Mem-
 bers of Congress, we would, by the same logic, have to cut out of
 the loop any of the key people in the Executive Branch the foreign
 government objected to.
 I would like to know what you would do under those circum-
 stances. Would you say to Canada or some other country that in-
 sisted we not inform the Secretary of State or the Secretary of De-
 fense or the NSC or the Vice President that we will accept their
 conditions? Would you tell them that is not how we do business
 and we can't make a decision like this without the input from
 these people?
 FOREIGN GOVERNMENT'S INSISTING NO ONE ELSE BE CONSULTED
 Judge WEBSTER. Well, I am sure the latter is what we would
 have to do.
 We are dealing with a very small, narrow set of circumstances,
 which have only occurred three times in terms of delayed notice
 and one time with respect to a country's demand for not sharing
 information.
 We are successful where we need to be in communicating infor-
 mation to the Secretary of State directly under circumstances in
 which he must necessarily limit further dissemination, and we
 have done that. I suppose that that would be the answer to the ob-
 jection.

 I have trouble dealing with hypotheticals--
 Mr. SOLARZ. If this legislation were enacted, couldn't you give the
 same answer to such an objection with respect to informing the
 Congress?
 Judge WEBSTER. We could, Mr. Solarz. It would still leave open
 two questions: one, whether the foreign government would accept
 that-and, of course, what they are doing is offering help and re-
 fusing that help if we don't comply with their rules, so it is not a
 question of having them dictate our procedures; and the other one
 is a constitutional issue which I prefer not to address myself, but it
 is still there.
 CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE'S INVOLVED
 Mr. SOLARZ. I think the constitutional issue is a very important
 one and I hate to see us get involved in the same kind of situation
 we are involved in with the War Powers Act where we have legis-
 lation on the books and the Congress expects it to be adhered to
 but the President takes the position that it is unconstitutional and
 doesn't carry it out.
 Would you or any of your legal advisors present be in a position
 to let us know whether or not, if this legislation in its current form
 is enacted, the President would comply with the law by notifying
 the congressional leadership specified in the bill within 48 hours
 that special activities were underway or were contemplated?
 Judge WEBSTER. I think that entire question has to be referred to
 the Justice Department, Mr. Solarz. I have no personal knowledge
 of it.
 Mr. SOLARZ. Mr. Chairman, I think this question, which was also
 raised by Mr. Hamilton, is a very important one, and I would hope
 that we could arrange to get an answer from the Administration
 whether it is from Justice or whomever, before we proceed. I think
 it is essential to know that there would be presidential compliance
 with the legislation, and if there isn't going to be presidential com-
 pliance with the legislation, then perhaps we need to consider some
 provisions designed to elicit it.
 Chairman FASCELL. Well, if the gentleman will allow me to re-
 spond, if we don't have something from Justice we will certainly
 seek it. But nevertheless I would be guided by the constitutional
 requirement that the President faithfully execute the law.
 Mr. SOLARZ. Judge Webster, can you undertake to use your influ-
 ence to get us a response from the Administration on this?
 We want to know whether the President would carry out the law
 or whether he would refuse to on the grounds that it violates his
 constitutional prerogative.
 Mr. HYDE. Would the gentleman yield?
 Since our Supreme Court does not give advisory positions, I
 doubt whether the White House would be similarly bound.
 Judge WEBSTER. I am not sure what kind of influence I have in
 this area, so I think the Administration will be made aware of your
 concern about this issue.
 The President has indicated that lack of flexibility would not be
 acceptable to him in terms of addressing a bill presented for his
 signature. But I can't take it beyond that point.

 Mr. ARMACOST. Could I comment?
 I hope the issue wouldn't be phrased as one on withholding infor-
 mation from Congress. I think, as Mr. Hamilton was saying, there
 is an inherent tension between your requirements for accountabil-
 ity in this area and the requirements that the President conduct
 foreign policy, and we have been trying to find some practical way
 of managing a very sensitive subject.
 Nobody on our side rejects the notion of timely notification. The
 question is whether a rigid 48-hour rule should apply in every in-
 stance, and whether there can be foreseen occasions, in extreme
 cases where that should not be the rule. I think that is the ques-
 tion.
 I think honorable people will disagree on whether that is the line
 we ought to strike. It is whether or not the 48-hour rule is appro-
 priate.
 Mr. SOLARZ. I think the reason we have a 48-hour rule is that
 timely notification in the Iran-Contra affair was apparently defined
 to be of an indefinite duration. It went on not for hours or days or
 weeks but for months, and could have gone on for years. I think
 that is the problem we have.
 One final question, Mr. Chairman.
 Other than the effort to rescue the hostages in Iran, which has
 been referred to under the Carter Administration in your testimo-
 ny, are you in a position to give us any examples, in closed session
 if necessary, of any covert activities in which we have engaged over
 the last eight years, which we would not have been able to have
 engaged in if this proposed legislation had been the law of the land
 and notification of the finding had been obligatory to the congres-
 sional leadership within 48 hours?
 Judge WEBSTER. I think the answer has to be no, those are the
 only three situations in which notice I think well within the 48-
 hour period was not given to the Congress.
 Mr. Soi.Aaz. Thank you very much.
 Chairman FASCELL. I would say to the gentleman from New York
 that we have nothing in writing in the Foreign Affairs Committee.
 I don't know whether this is still the policy of the administra-
 tion, but on May 10th Colin Powell, Assistant to the President for
 National Security Affairs, wrote to the Chairman of the Intelli-
 gence Committee, with attachments which included the definition
 of "covert action" and some amendments to the bill that they sug-
 gested.
 In that letter in part he says,
 It should be well understood that the President's senior advisors will recommend
 a veto of legislation containing such an absolute reporting requirement because
 such a requirement encroaches upon the President's constitutional authority.
 I don't know whether they talked to the White House. lawyer or
 whether they talked to the Justice Department, but be that as it
 may, that is the position they have taken. I don't know how legal it
 is.

 CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION OF THE LEGISLATION
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Hyde.
 Mr. HYDE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Judge Webster, this statement is contained in the Congressional
 Record in debating this companion legislation in the Senate, and
 this is by Senator Cohen, who is the chief sponsor, although Sena-
 tor Boren's name may be first, but as I read this, Senator Cohen is
 the driving force.
 Director Webster has recently testified before the House Intelligence Committee
 that the notice requirements in S. 1721 do not, in and of themselves, place undue
 burdens on the intelligence community. Furthermore, Director Webster has not en-
 dorsed a Justice Department statutory and constitutional interpretation.
 Is that a correct statement?
 Judge WEBSTER. I think, if not inaccurate, it is misleading be-
 cause, first of all, I have avoided a participation in the constitution-
 al issue because I believe that should be addressed by the Justice
 Department. Indeed, it was addressed in a letter to the House Per-
 manent Select Committee on Intelligence in a letter dated June 9,
 1987. I don't know whether it is a part of this committee or not,
 but I have a copy of that.
 On the issue of the 48-hour rule, I have pointed out in testimony
 the same kind of situations that would be very difficult for us if we
 were confronted with an outside offer of help which was condi-
 tioned upon giving notice of the kind that is contemplated by the
 bill. We have had very few situations in our experience where we
 could not provide that 48-hour notice.
 It has been my position that, with the constitutional question
 creating unnecessary tension between the Congress and the Chief
 Executive, and the Chief Executive publishing a national security
 decision directive which represents his commitment to make notice
 within 48 hours except in those very extraordinary circumstances
 and to review any decision to delay notice to ten days, that legisla-
 tion in this area is not necessary.
 That has been my position.
 48-HOUR PERIOD FOR NOTIFICATION
 Mr. HYDE. I quote further from the distinguished Senator from
 Maine,
 The only thing we have added is the 48-hour notice. I picked that 48-hour period,
 as I indicated before, because Mr. Gates, Mr. Webster and Mr. McMann have indi-
 cated that is entirely reasonable. That is the practice. That is why we put it in the
 bill.
 I assume, from your testimony today and the testimony I have
 heard you give before, that you do not agree that 48 hours as an
 inflexible statutory mandate is something that you support.
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct.
 Mr. HYDE. Now, let me read a couple of sentences to both of you
 witnesses, Mr. Armacost and Judge Webster.

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7  45
 As the committee knows, covert activities have become numerous and widespread,
 practically constituting a routine component of our foreign policy.
 Do you agree with that, Mr. Armacost?
 USE OF COVERT ACTIVITIES
 Mr. ARMACOST. No, I don't, nor should they be. They should be
 an unusual instrument that is employed when there are special cir-
 cumstances requiring plausible deniability.
 Mr. HYDE. I understand that. But there is a flat statement made
 by a very distinguished witness who says that "covert activities
 have become numerous and widespread, practically constituting a
 routine component of our foreign policy."
 I say that is way overstated. Would you agree with that?
 Mr. ARMACOST. I would.
 Judge WEBSTER. Yes, I would agree with that.
 Mr. HYDE. On this sentence, "I believe that covert activities have
 harmed this country more than they have helped us," is it possible
 to make a judgment like that and, if so, would you agree with that,
 bearing in mind that our successful covert activities never get pub-
 licized or we learn about it years later, if at all?
 Judge WEBSTER. There is some truth to the statement that when
 our covert actions fail, they are likely to cause a good deal of harm
 because of the reaction by the press and by the Congress and other
 parts of the world.
 This is not to say, however, that it is not necessary for the
 United States to have such a capability. In many parts of the world
 we work with countries and with groups within countries to which,
 from the perspective of those friends, it is important that the role
 of the United States be identified, for very legitimate reasons.
 So it is important that we have that capability in order to supply
 aid to our friends in implementation of our foreign policy.
 CONSTITUTIONALITY OF BILL
 Mr. HYDE. I see my friend, Mr. Hamilton, is leaving. I wish he
 wouldn't.
 Lee, I am going to talk about something you said and I would
 like to have you here.
 Mr. Hamilton said that we can't let a third country dictate the
 constitutional processes of our government. That assumes that this
 bill is constitutional. I don't assume that at all. I think it is very
 questionable that it is constitutional.
 I would like to give you a statement made by Eugene Rostow,
 Sterling professor of law emeritus and senior research scholar at
 Yale Law School, who is known to all of us.
 He quoted Congressman Hamilton and said he was commendable
 and frank in his testimony on February 24th of this year when he
 said, and I quote,
 Now we are told by the Administration that "timely" means whatever the Presi-
 dent says it means and that he can withhold notice as long as he wants. If we let
 this interpretation stand, an interpretation that says that the President can with-
 hold information from Congress at his discretion, then Congress will have weakened
 seriously its oversight capabilities and consented to a basic shift of power away from
 Congress to the Executive. Once this power to withhold information from Congress
 is granted to the President, how can it then be maintained that Congress stands
 equal in power to the President?

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 6
 Now, Professor Rostow responds to that,
 But Congress and the President are not constitutionally equal in power with re-
 spect to all aspects of the making and conduct of foreign policy. Congress has enu-
 merated legislative powers. The President, the executive power. In some areas Con-
 gress is clearly supreme; in others, the President. Only Congress can appropriate
 money, declare war and enact laws. Only the President can nominate and remove
 high officials, recognize foreign governments and conduct foreign relations. (What
 ever happened to the Logan Act?) In all areas, however, cooperation between Con-
 gress and the President is necessary if our complicated government is to function.
 But cooperation is not. a simple rule of thumb equally applicable in every case and
 it is not a matter for legislative timetables. The timing and sequence of that coop-
 eration must be flexible and responsive to circumstance. Its success depends ulti-
 mately on the political insight and intuition of the chief participants in the process.
 Would either of you or both of you agree with that statement?
 Mr. ARMACOST. I certainly would.
 Judge WEBSTER. I have no trouble with it.
 Mr. HYDE. Now, I want to--
 Mr. HAMILTON. I wonder why they are so anxious to comment on
 that constitutional question when they wouldn't comment on the
 constitutionality of the bill? [Laughter.]
 Mr. HYDE. Perhaps I asked a leading question. [Laughter.]
 I want to pose a hypothetical that is very important and I want
 to insist that it is hypothetical, and if I name countries, these are
 absolutely fictional, not true, hypothetical, but to give some sub-
 stance to my hypothetical I must do that.
 Now, it is learned through a highly placed source that the Irani-
 an ambassador to the U.N.-I insist this is fictional-has a cache of
 a biological agent that, if released, will destroy New York City and
 -six million people. The Tunisian delegation has access to the Irani-
 an ambassador-fictional, again, I insist-and his quarters, and has
 indicated a willingness to take whatever steps are necessary to
 neutralize the biological agent but requires ongoing intelligence
 and logistic support from the FBI and the CIA.
 The Tunisian ambassador insists no one be notified beyond the
 President and the Director of the FBI as to what is underway, and
 a leak of this would panic a whole nation.
 What do you tell the Tunisian ambassador? Do you tell him,
 sorry, Mr. Ambassador, we have to tell at least Speaker Wright
 and Senator Byrd about this within 48 hours, we have got to do it,
 that is the law, we don't want to be impeached and don't want to
 be a scofflaw, so just what do you do?
 How do you deal with it? You can't under this law. And if this is
 the law, the cooperation of other countries, indispensable to some-
 times very life-threatening situations, will be forfeit. That is why it
 is bad and it is dangerous.
 I just throw that hypothetical at you. You don't have to deal
 with it. I am sorry I mentioned the names of countries; it could
 have been the PLO or Syria or anything. But it can happen, be-
 cause biological warfare is a reality.
 But I must say, we are playing with the very existence of our
 country by forcing, into a mechanical mold of 48 hours, the Presi-
 dent to do something that he may not be able to do because we
 have to work with third-party countries. We have to work with
 them; they may be the only people available.

 This is very foolish legislation for our own interest. There is so
 much more, the constitutional issues are profound and important
 and so misunderstood.
 The Chairman said if you don't own a newspaper, you can't leak.
 I have just read Woodward's last book and tried to figure out how
 many hundreds of leaks are in there. Of course, "none of them
 came from Congress." We have serious problems in this country,
 and overreacting to Iran-Contra to force President Dukakis, Presi-
 dent Jackson or President Bush into 48-hour notification, no
 matter what the covert activity is, is self-defeating, I think.
 Thank you, though, for listening, and I know you are pleased you
 don't have to answer that hypothetical. I will ask Mr. Clifford the
 answer to that when his turn comes.
 Thank you.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Director, you made reference to a letter
 from the Justice Department to the Permanent House Select Com-
 mittee dated June 9, 1987, which addressed the constitutional issue.
 We are not the recipients of that letter and don't have the benefit
 of their wisdom. If you have got a copy of that letter, it would be
 nice for us to have it for the record, although I at least strongly
 disagree with it.
 Judge WEBSTER. I will be happy to leave one with you or supply
 one to you.
 Chairman FASCELL. Thank you. Otherwise, we would have to
 spend a lot of time getting a copy of a letter that wasn't addressed
 to us, and we appreciate your cooperation.

 Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affair:
 Representative Matthew F. McHugh
 Chairman, Subcommittee on Legislation of the
 House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
 House of Representatives
 Washington, D.C. 20515
 Dear Mr. Chairman:
 This letter presents the views of the Department of -Justice on
 H.R. 1013, a bill relating to the system of congressional oversight
 of intelligence activities.  The Department of Justice opposes
 enactment.of this legislation. because we believe it would unconsti-
 tutionally intrude on the President's authority to conduct the
 foreign relations of the United States.
 H.R. 1013 would make substantial revisions of both the con-
 gressional reporting requirements of the National Security Act and
 the Hughes-Ryan Amendment.  Besides appearing to broaden the con-
 gressional notification requirements, section 3 of H.R.,1013 would
 delete from section 501(a) of the National Security Act the present
 express acknowledgment that the Act imposes reporting requirements
 on the President only insofar as the requirements are consistent
 with lis authorities and duties under the United States Constitu-
 tion.    It would also delete the Act's provision acknowledging the
 1 Section 501(a) presently provides (emphasis added):
 To the extent consistent with all applicable
 authorities and duties, including those conferred by
 the Constitution upon the i executive and legislative
 branches of the Government, and to the extent
 consistent with due regard for the protection from
 unauthorized disclosure of classified information
 and information relating to intelligence sources and
 methods, the Director of Central Intelligence and
 the heads of all departments, agencies, and other
 entities of the United States involved in
 intelligence activities shall --
 (1) keep the Select Committee on Intelligence of
 the Senate and the Permanent SelectCommt:tee on

 President's independent constitutional authority, namely section
 )01(b), which provides for presidential discretion in deferring.
 eotice to Cgngress concerning exceptionally sensitive intelligence
 activities.    In place of the current Act's provision acknowledging
 the President's authority to provide 'timely notice' in such sensi-
 tive situations, section 3 of H.R. 1013 would purport to require
 that such notice be given within 48 hours after the initiation of
 such operations.
 Section 2 of R.R. 1013 goes even further with respect to
 operations involving the Central Intelligence Agency.   It would
 purport to require that copies of Hughes-Ryan 'findings' be pro-
 vided to certain executive branch officials and that this be dose
 before the initiation of any operation requiring such findings.
 1 Cont.   Intelligence of the House of
 Representatives      . fully and currently informed
 of all intelligence activities which are the
 responsibility of, are engaged in by, or are
 carried out for or an behalf of, any department,
 agency, or entity of the United States, including
 any significant anticipated intelligence activity,
 except that (A) the foregoing provision shall not
 require approval of the intelligence committees as a
 condition precedent to the initiation of any such
 anticipated intelligence activity, and (B) if the'
 President determines it is essential to limit prior
 notice to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting
 vital interests of the United States, such notice
 shall be limited to the chairman and ranking
 minority members of the intelligence committees,
 the Speaker and minority leader of the House of
 Representatives, and the majority and minority
 leaders of the Senate.
 Needless to say, deleting the underscored language would be only
 symbolic and could not alter the constitutional rights or duties of
 either branch.
 2  Section 501(b) currently provides (emphasis added):
 The President shalt ll fully inform the intelligence
 committees in a time   fashion of intelligence
 operations in foreign countries; other than
 activities intended solely for obtaining necessary
 intelligence, for which prior notice was not given
 under subsection (a) of this section and shall
 provide a statement of the reasons for not giving
 prior notice.

 While the 48-hour provision of the new section 501(e) of the
 vational Security Act would apply to congressional notification ofJe "Hughes-Ryan  operations, this unprecedented requirement of
 tification of subordinate executive branch officials appears to
 impose an absolute rule of prior notice.
 In keeping with the long-standing view of Presidents of every
 Administration that has considered this issue, the Department
 believes that these provisions of H.R. 1013 are unconstitutional.
 As you know, these same issues were.the subject of thorough debate
 and extensive negotiation in 1980, when Congress was considering
 proposals for intelligence oversight legislation.  It was the
 position of the Administration then, as-it is of this Administra-
 tion now, that there may be exceptional occasions on which the
 President's exclusive and inalienable constitutional duties in the
 area of foreign affairs would preclude him from giving prior notice
 of very sensitive intelligence-related operations.
 This Administration, like prior Administrations, is anxious to
 work with Congress in devising arrangements to satisfy the legiti-
 mate interests in legislative oversight.  But the executive branch
 in 1980 recognized that there is a point beyond which the Consti-
 tution simply would not permit congressional encumbering of the
 President's ability to initiate, direct, and control the sensitive
 national security activities at issue here.- Testifying. before the
 Senate Select Committee in 1980, then CIA Director Stansfield
 Turner emphatically pointed out that the prior notification then
 being considered "would amount to excessive intrusion by the
 .ongress into the President's exercise of his powers under the
 'onstitution."  See National Intelligence Act of 1980:  Hearings
 before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, 96th Cong., 2d
 Sess. 17 (1980).
 The Constitution confers on the President the authority and
 duty to conduct the foreign relations of the United States.  Covert
 intelligence-related operations in foreign countries are among the
 3 Cont.  this chapter or any other Act may be
 expended by or on behalf of the Central-
 Intelligence Agency for . operations. in foreign
 countries; other than activities, intended
 solely for obtaining-necessary intelligence,
 unless and until the President finds that each
 such operation is important to the national
 security of the United States.  Each such
 operation shall be considered a significant
 anticipated intelligence activity for the
 purpose of section 413 of title 50 (i.e?
 section 501 of the National Security Actg.
 4  Section 2 of N.R. 1013 also requires that the national security
 finding be in writing.  We. do not, however, interpret this to mean
 that-signed copies of the finding-.must.be provided to.Congress or

 most sensitive and vital aspects of this duty, and they lie at the
 very core of the President's Article II responsibilities.  In this
 'ttter the Department will not seek to detail all the authorities
 )d precedents relevant to our conclusion that an absolute prior
 _.utice requirement of the kind proposed in H.R. 3013 would be
 unconstitutional.  In summary, however, the Department believes
 that the Constitution, as confirmed by historical practice and
 clear statements of the United States Supreme Court, leaves the
 conduct of foreign relations, which must include foreign intelli-
 gence operations, to the President except insofar as the Consti-
 tution gives specific tasks to the Congress.
 The principal source for the President's wide and inherent
 discretion to act for the nation in foreign affairs is section 1 of
 article II of the Constitution wherein it is stated:   'The execu-
 tive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of
 America.'  The clause has long been held to confer on the Presi-
 dent plenary authority to represent the United States and to pursue
 its interests outside the borders of the country, subject only to
 limits specifically set forth in the Constitution itself and to
 such statutory limitations as the Constitution permits Congress to
 impose by exercising one of its enumerated powers.  The President's
 executive power includes all the discretion traditionally available
 to any sovereign in its external relations, except insofar as the
 Constitution places that discretion in another branch of the
 government.
 Before the Constitution was ratified, Alexander Hamilton
 xplained in The Federalist why the President's executive power
 Duld include the conduct of foreign policy:  'The essence of the
 Legislative authority is to enact laws, or, in other words to
 prescribe rules for the regulation of the society; while the
 execution of the laws and the employment of the common strength,
 either for this purpose or for the common defense, seem to com-
 prise all the functions of the executive magistrate.'  See The
 Federalist No. 75, at 450 (A. Hamilton) (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). By
 recognizing this fundamental distinction between 'prescribing rules
 for the regulation of the society' and 'employing the common
 strength for the common defense' the Framers made clear that the
 Constitution gave to Congress only those powers in the area of
 foreign affairs that directly involve the exercise of legal
 authority over American citizens.  As to other matters in which the
 nation acts as a sovereign entity in relation to outsiders, the
 Constitution delegates the necessary authority to the President in
 the form of the 'executive Power.'
 The authority of the President to conduct foreign relations
 va first asserted by George Washington and acknowledged by the
 First Congress.  Without consulting Congress, President Washington
 determined that the United States would remain neutral in the war
 between France and Great Britain.  The Supreme Court and Congress,

 too, have recognized the President's'broad discretion to act on
 ."is own initiative in the field of foreign affairs.  In the
 'ading case, United States v. Curtiss-Wrigh  Lxoort Corv., 299
 1i. 304 (1936 , the Court drew a sharp distinction between the
 President's relatively limited inherent powers to act in the
 domestic sphere and his far-reaching discretion to act on his own
 authority in managing the external relations of the country.  The
 Supreme Court emphatically declared that this discretion derives
 from the Constitution itself, stating that 'the President [is] the
 sole organ of the federal government in the field of international
 relations -- a Dover which does-not require as a basis for its
 exercise an act of Congress.' 299 U.S. at 319-320 (emphasis added).
 Moreover, as the Curtiss-Wright Court noted, the Senate Committee
 on Foreign Relations acknowledged this principle at an early date
 in our history, stating that 'the President is the constitutional
 representative of the united States with regard to foreign na-
 tions.'  The Committee also noted 'that [the President's consti-
 tutional) responsibility is the surest pledge for the faithful
 discharge of his duty' and the Committee believed that 'interfer-
 ence of the Senate in the direction of foreign negotiations (is)

 the best security for the national safety.'  299 U.S. at 319
 (quoting U.S. Senate, Reports, Committee on Foreign Relations, vol.
 8,   . 24 (Feb. 15, 1816)).  Curtiss-Wright thus confirms the
 Prepsident's inherent Article II authority to engage in a wide
 range of extraterritorial foreign policy initiatives, including
 intelligence activities -- an authority that derives from the
 'onstitution, not from the passage of specific authorizing
 egislation.
 Despite this vide-ranging authority, Presidents have been
 careful to consult regularly with Congress to seek support and
 counsel in matters of foreign affairs.  Moreover, we recognize that
 the President's authority over foreign policy, precisely because
 its nature requires that it be wide and relatively unconfined by
 preexisting constraints, is inevitably somewhat ill-defined at the
 margins.  Whatever questions may arise at the outer reaches of his
 power, however, the conduct of secret negotiations and intelligence
 operations lies at the very heart of the President's executive
 power.  The Supreme Court's Curtiss-Wright decision itself notes
 the President's exclusive power to negotiate on behalf of the
 United States.  The Supreme Court has also, and more recently,
 emphasized that this core presidential function is by no means
 limited to matters directly involving treaties.   In United States
 v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), the Court invoked the basic Curtiss-
 Wright distinction between the domestic and international contexts
 to explain its rejection of President Nixon's claim of an absolute
 privilege of confidentiality for all communications between him
 and his advisors.  While rejecting this sweeping and undifferen-
 tiated claim of executive privilege as applied to communications
 involving domestic affairs, the Court repeatedly and emphatically
 stressed that military or diplomatic secrets are in a different
 category:  such secrets are intimately linked to the President's
 krticle II duties, where the 'courts have traditionally shown the

 mo t   fsr n   to Presidential responsibilities.'  418 V.S. at
 30  empha  s added).
 We are unaware of any provision of the Constitution that
 affirmatively authorizes Congress to have the role provided in H.R.
 1013.  Congress' implied authority to oversee the activities of
 executive branch agencies is grounded on Congress' need for infor-
 mation to consider and enact needful and appropriate legislation.
 Congress in the performance of this legislative function, however,
 does not require detailed knowledge of virtually all intelligence
 activities particularly prior to initiation.  Oversight of ongoing
 operations has the potential to interfere with the ability of the
 President to discharge the duties imposed on him by the Consti-
 tution.  Accordingly, the President must retain his constitutional
 discretion to decide whether prior notice, in certain exceptional
 circumstances, is not appropriate.
 Since the current legislation was adopted in 1980, of course,
 the President has provided prior notice of covert operations in
 virtually every case.  Moreover, in acting to implement the recom-
 mendations of the Tower Board, the President recently reaffirmed
 his committment to the current statutory scheme of notification.
 See the text of National Security Decision Directive No. 266, which
 accompanied the President's message to Congress of March 31, 1987.
 The Department of Justice also objects to Section 2 of H.R.
 2013, which would purport to require that the President furnish
 copies of his national security findings to the Vice President, the
 Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of
 Central intelligence before the initiation of any operation
 requiring a Hughes-Ryan finding.  Like the congressional prior
 notice requirements, though for somewhat different reasons, this
 provision is inconsistent with the President's constitutional
 authority.  By requiring certain of the President's subordinates to
 be notified of covert actions before they occur, this proposal
 would infringe on the President's prerogatives as head of a unitary
 executive branch to exercise. full discretion in consulting and
 communicating with his subordinates.
 The Constitution places the whole executive power in the hands
 of the President.   in contrast to political systems that employ
 some form of cabinet government, our Constitution is based on the
 principle of the unitary executive.   It is worth emphasizing that
 the Framers deliberately chose this principle and deliberately
 ee ed the cabinet (or privy council) alternative, with which
 they were quite familiar from British practice and from the Consti-
 tutions of most of the original states.  Indeed Article II, section
 2, of the Constitution provides that the President 'Pay require the
 Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the execu-
 tive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their
 respective Offices' (emphasis added). Plainly, it is the President
 who decides when he requires the advice of others in the Executive
 Branch and which persons he will consult.  Neither his authority to
 seek advice from such officials as he may choose nor the manner in
 which he makes such consultations may be circumscribed by Congress.

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 54
 The Framers' two main reasons for choosing to create a unitary
 xecutive were complementary and mutually reinforcing.  First,
 khey thought that for the executive branch, in sharp contrast to
 the legislative branch, rapid and decisive decision-making is suf-
 ficiently important that it outweighs the inevitably concomitant
 danger that rash or ill-considered actions will be undertaken.  See-
 he Federalist No. 70, at 423-24 (A. Hamilton) (C. Rossiter ed.
 196.      nd, the Framers believed that unity i n the executive
 would promote what today we call 'accountability."  As Alexander
 Hamilton pointed out, the more that the executive power is watered
 down and distributed among various persons, the easier it is for
 everyone concerned to avoid the blame for bad actions taken or for
 desirable actions left undone.  See Tge Federalist No. 70, at 427
 (A. Hamilton) (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).   Certainly, it would be
 unwise, as well as unconstitutional, to move our governmental
 institutions in a direction that could lead to less presidential
 accountability.
 Of course, we acknowledge that consultation with the members
 of the National Secugity Council would almosteelways be a prudent
 presidential policy.    We object only to undertaking to make such
 consultation a legal obligation.  As a constitutional matter, there
 is no difference between the subordinate officials listed in this
 bill and thousands of other executive branch officers.   If one
 statute could require the President to notify any of them of his
 national security findings prior to initiating a covert operation,
 another statute could just as easily require him to notify other
 subordinates, or all of them.  Thus, given the Constitution's?
 creation of a unitary executive, the cabinet notification require-
 ments in section 2 of this bill, like the congressional no.tif.ica-
 tion requirements discussed earlier, are inconsistent with Article
 II of the Constitution.
 5  The Framers also believed that placing the whole of the
 executive power in one man was usefully 'conducive' to secrecy -- a
 consideration directly relevant to H.R. 1013.  See The Federalist
 No. 70, at 424 (A. Hamilton) (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).
 6  Indeed, in keeping with past practice, the President has
 directed that "proposed covert actions      . be coordinated with
 NSC participants, including the Attorney General,--and their respec-
 tive recommendations communicated to the President . . . .'  NSDD
 266 (March 31, 1987).
 7  The requirement in section 2 of H.R.1013, that the national
 security finding mandated by the Hughes-Ryan Amendment be in
 writing also raises questions insofar as it has some potential to
 interfere with the President's discretion in choosing how to run
 his own office.  On the other hand, because this provision does
 serve the legitimate purpose of facilitating after-the-fact
 congressional oversight, it is the least objectionable feature of
 N.R. 1013.

 In closing, the Department notes that when proposals similar
 to those in B.R. 1013 were introduced in 1979 and 1980, it was
 recognized that no president has either the right or the paver-to
 alter the Constitution's allocation of powers among the institu-
 tions of our government.  This view was correct then and is correct
 now.
 The Office of Management and Budget has advised this Depart-
 ment that it has no objection to the submission of this report. to

 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Berman?
 Mr. BERMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Judge Webster, I have a number of different areas I would like
 to cover in my five minutes and so, understanding that, I hope you
 will bear with me and I will try to be brief.
 First I would like to pursue this question of the constitutional
 issue raised by the Administration.
 Is there any question but that it is appropriate in the Adminis-
 tration's view, constitutional, for Congress to require that before a
 covert operation is undertaken there be a presidential finding?
 Judge WEBSTER. Not" in my mind.
 Mr. BERMAN. How about that the finding be reduced to writing
 either contemporaneously or within 48 hours where time is of the
 essence?
 Judge WEBSTER. Well, I slipped, getting on the slippery slope of
 giving constitutional opinions, and I would like to avoid that. I
 don't have any practical problem with it. If you could put it on the
 basis of practical issues, we can do it.
 Mr. BERMAN. Here is our problem. The Administration, I gather,
 is asserting three reasons for urging us to defeat this legislation.
 One, is the third-country matter, which I think has been effec-
 tively responded to by Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Solarz. The second is
 this question of the expanded potential for unauthorized leaks.
 But my assumption-and correct me if I am wrong-is that there
 is absolutely no evidence that there has been any unauthorized dis-
 closure of a covert operation, prior to completion of that covert op-
 eration, as a result of the notification required and undertaken by
 the Administration to the Intelligence Committees during this Ad-
 ministration.
 Could we establish that for the record? I have been told there is
 no dispute about that, but I think it would be good to get that on
 the record.
 Judge WEBSTER. I would rather respond to that for the record.
 That is a pretty sweeping statement and I don't know that I am in
 a position to give it to you off the top of my head. I can't identify in
 my mind.
 Mr. BERMAN. Let me ask the question as precisely as I can.
 There is no instance in which-it is my understanding, and I
 would, be interested in knowing if this is the Administration's un-
 derstanding as well-that there is no instance in which advance
 notification of covert operations has resulted in. advance disclosure
 by virtue of the briefings to the Intelligence Committees or to the
 group of eight.
 Judge WEBSTER. I believe, although I can't say that I know-I be-
 lieve that that statement is correct. There have only been three sit-
 uations in which notice was not given.
 Mr. BERMAN. Well, in the cases where notice has not been given,
 there has not been unauthorized disclosure by virtue of the notifi-
 cation to Congress.
 I am talking about the instances-Mr. Hyde says it hasn't been
 that many, but I am talking about where there has been notifica-

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 tion to Congress, and my understanding is that there is no evidence
 of unauthorized disclosure as a result of those notifications.
 Judge WEBSTER. Well--
 Mr. BERMAN. There was once a threat which was never carried
 out, but there has been no such disclosure?
 Judge WEBSTER. I think that is generally true. I am trying to
 think in terms of over time. It becomes an awareness of some of
 these covert actions, people talk about aspects of them, but wheth-
 er they come from--
 Mr. BERMAN. I am speaking prior to the time the covert oper-
 ation was completed.
 Judge WEBSTER. I think your statement is probably true.
 WHAT SHOULD BE THE TIME RESTRICTIONS PUT ON THE
 ADMINISTRATION TO NOTIFY CONGRESS?
 Mr. BERMAN. As I understand it, the issue is not whether Con-
 gress should be notified, but what kind of restrictions to put on the
 Administration in terms of time.
 There is an acceptance that Congress should be notified of all
 covert operations; is that a fair statement?
 Judge WEBSTER. I think that is fair.
 GENERAL NOTIFICATIONS REQUIREMENTS TO CONGRESS
 Mr. BERMAN. Well, we have started going down that slippery
 slope that I hope to pursue with you, but I think, given where my
 time is, rather than pursue that I would like to move to another
 subject.
 In legislation which Mr. Hyde and I sponsored which has passed
 the House, dealing with arms transfers to countries on the terrorist
 list, overhauling some of the general notification requirements in
 which we have worked closely with the Central Intelligence
 Agency and other parts of the Administration-and I think we
 have removed fundamentally any Administration opposition to leg-
 islation. We removed a provision which required the Intelligence
 Committees to be fully informed of arms transfers made as a part
 of covert operations.
 It is my understanding, based on the discussions, that part of a
 presidential finding, part of what is notified to Congress will in-
 clude any arms transfer component of a covert operation, any mu-
 nitions item, that is the practice in the Intelligence Committee no-
 tifications and briefings.
 Is that a correct statement of the practice?
 Judge WEBSTER. I believe, if I understand your question, that it is
 correct.
 The practice is to distinguish between lethal and nonlethal aid.
 The extent to which the finding actually specifies quantity or qual-
 ity and so forth, I think we don't do that. But that is followed up in
 scope notes and other briefings to the Congress, to the Oversight
 Committees.
 Mr. BERMAN. I want to make sure I understand, that when you
 notify, when you provide the prior notification required by the law,
 except under the unusual circumstances, that you provide notifica-

 tion of a munitions list transfer as part of that covert operation as
 well, that that is the practice?
 Judge WEBSTER. We call it lethal aid.
 Mr. BERMAN. Lethal?
 Judge WEBSTER. Yes. Yes, we do.
 Mr. BERMAN. All right.
 Mr. Leach raised the question of the advisability of submitting
 the formal presidential finding to the Intelligence Committees. Put-
 ting aside the question of the timeliness, as I understand it the na-
 tional security directive provides. for that transfer of the finding, of
 a copy of the finding, to the Intelligence Committees.
 What would be the problem with including that in any statutory
 provision?
 Judge WEBSTER. I am not objecting to any language of that kind
 and I don't believe the Administration is as such. That is-I think
 the earlier thinking, pretty much as Mr. Leach outlined, is an
 effort to keep it from personalizing and to try to insulate the Presi-
 dent from personal responsibility for specific acts of conduct made
 pursuant to the finding.
 But beyond that I don't know of any legal inhibition or prohibi-
 tion and we have not raised objection to it..
 Mr. BERMAN. You are requiring it by virtue of your own national
 security directive?
 Judge WEBSTER. That is correct.
 Mr. BERMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Bereuter.
 Mr. BEREUTER. Thank you very much for your testimony. I have
 been spending part of my time in waiting reading related extracts
 from NSDD 286. It would seem to me that this National Security
 Decision Directive answers many of the objectives that the, admin-
 istration seeks to obtain-maybe all of them.
 One of the problems I see with the procedure of establishing
 NSDDs is that subsequently one can be issued which makes excep-
 tions to them. For example, NSDD 286 could be modified as to the
 kind of notifications that Congress would receive. And, as someone
 else pointed out, we may not in fact know when a new directive is
 issued.
 Now, if we are to avoid taking these actions by statute, can you
 gentlemen or anyone else in the Executive Branch give us some
 way of dealing with the possibility that these good procedures that
 are helpful to keeping selected Members of Congress informed will
 not be set aside with or without our knowledge?
 Judge WEBSTER. Well, I think your point:. is very well taken and.
 it highlights the real emphasis between trying to find legislative so-
 lutions to all problems which -in effect then create problems of
 their own kind, such as Mr. Hyde talked about, and the expecta-
 tions and commitments of the executives assigned to carry out
 those national directives.
 I would not impute to the President the possibility that he might
 try to pull the blind down on this directive by some indirect and
 substitute national decision, National Security Decision Directive.

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 59
 There would be no way for me to view it other than some act of
 deception.
 And in my present capacity, and the commitments I made at the
 time of confirmation, I don't believe that I could accommodate to
 that, but I would never expect this President to do that nor would I
 be willing to accept that kind of conduct from any other President
 under whom I might serve. I would have a personal obligation to
 do something about it.
 Mr. BEREUTER. Of course, I am trying to look at this under an
 institutional basis, regardless of who the President is at the
 moment.
 I understood that some kind of oral assurance was given to the
 Senate Intelligence Committee on this very subject. I don't know
 that that is the case.
 Judge WEBSTER. It started with a letter from the President to the
 Congress and was followed up then by a formal National Security
 Decision Directive.
 I believe the President's commitment is there. And I do not be-
 lieve he could or would attempt to change that commitment with-
 out a formal notification to Congress that he is operating under a
 different set of rules.
 Mr. BEREUTER. It is true, isn't it, that the President can sign a
 directive or remove one from existence without any established
 group of people necessarily being involved? Could, with one person
 for example, decide to issue a directive which would have force?
 That is theoretically possible, isn't it?
 Mr. ARMACOST. I believe it is.
 Judge WEBSTER. Right.
 Mr. BEREUTER. I would ask the Director, in your statement you
 said that you thought the definition of what constitutes covert ac-
 tions in terms of a special activity as defined here "removes much
 of the ambiguity over what constitutes such covert action," and
 later you said a distinct improvement. Are those words of art or
 can you think of additional ways that this definition could be im-
 proved?
 Judge WEBSTER. I think that is an improvement because it recog-
 nizes in a statutory way what we have had to depend on by way of
 legislative history for an understanding of a meaning for those
 terms, and makes it clear that it does include that legislative histo-
 ry-Mr. BEREUTER. Do you think they are deficient in any way? Do
 you think the definition is deficient in any way?
 Judge WEBSTER. I have no suggestions to make to improve it. I
 think we understand it, it is what we have been living under and it
 codifies on what to now has been based on legislative history.
 Mr. BEREUTER. Mr. Secretary, do you have anything you wish to
 say about either question I have formulated?
 Mr. ARMACOST. I think I would merely say, Mr. Bereuter, that
 the practices, which in my experiences endure from one adminis-
 tration to another, are practices which work and which enjoy, the
 support of those who have been actively engaged both on the Hill
 and the Executive Branch in managing those activities-in this
 case, sensitive intelligence activities.

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 60
 I think, to go back to Mr. Hyde's question-and I am not a con-
 stitutional scholar and I think Bill Webster is prudent in leaving
 these matters to Justice-I would recall Edwin Corwin describe the
 Constitution as it applied to some areas as a- standing invitation to
 struggle. I think it would be unfortunate if we got our attention
 diverted to the jurisdictional issues here rather than concentrating
 on ways to manage sensitive intelligence activities. It is my experi-
 ence that over the last year and a half, people have learned the
 proper lessons from the Iran-contra episode. We have gotten 'better;.
 procedures in the Executive Branch. It is my impression that in
 the intelligence committees, a tremendous amount of information
 is shared and a good deal of confidence has been established in
 those procedures.
 It seems to me it would be an unfortunate thing if we wound up
 inviting the kind of jurisdictional struggle that we have had in the
 War Powers areas in this area also rather than focusing on proce-
 dural arrangements that are working quite well, and that permit
 you to have oversight without encroaching upon that preserve of
 Presidential prerogative which Mr. Hyde was speaking of, and in
 his quotation from Jacques Rosseau.
 I don't know that this can be fixed with absolute precision legis-
 latively. I think what we agree upon and what we deem to be the
 normal rule, that is 48 hours, is reasonable, and this should under-
 lie our common effort.
 We would simply add that we can envision circumstances in
 which the exception would obtain and we don't want to make that
 a focus for a struggle between the branches; we want to concen-
 trate on making it work, and I think it is working well.
 Mr. BEREUTER. Thank you. Let me ask one more quick question.
 Pragmatically, what happens in a change of administration. Are
 the NSDDs automatically taken and re-embraced by the new~Presi-
 dent until such time that any changes are identified? Is that prag-
 matically what happens?
 Mr. ARMACOST. Frankly, I would have to return to the record and
 provide a written answer.
 I think by and large there is a re-look by a new administration
 at least when there is a change of party. As I recall in this admin-
 istration, the first NSDD that was at least considered involved the
 procedures under which the national security system would work.
 Of course, those procedures are central to the management of intel-
 ligence operations. I expect that is the case.
 I wish to have an opportunity to refer back to my colleagues and
 provide something for the written record.
 [The information follows:]
 Presidential directives (such as NSDD's) normally remain in force until they are
 formally revoked. This is also the case with new administrations. The directives are
 normally reviewed by the incoming President and remain in force until a decision is
 made on whether they should be terminated or modified.
 Mr. BEREUTER. Thank you.

 PREVIOUS TESTIMONY ON SUPPORT FOR 48 PREVIOUS-HOUR RULE
 Mr. WEISS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 For the same reasons, I am going to limit myself to two very,
 very brief questions.
 Mr. Director, these are addressed in light of the question Mr.
 Hyde asked about Senator Cohen's testimony that he arrived at the
 48-hour notification time frame on the basis of discussions and tes-
 timony from Mr. Gates, Mr. McMahon, and yourself.
 I ask you first in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Com-
 mittee, John McMahon, former Deputy Director for Operations of
 the CIA, was asked if he supported the 48-hour requirement. He
 said,
 I do. I come from the position that the Intelligence Oversight Committee has to be
 an integral part of our intelligence program. I also believe very strongly it should
 have bipartisan support or it is eventually doomed for failure.
 Are you familiar with that response?
 Judge WEBSTER. I am familiar generally with Mr. McMahon's
 testimony and what he has told me with respect to that testimony.
 Mr. WEISS. Do you deny that that was his response? Do you agree
 that was his response?
 Judge WEBSTER. I don't have it before me, but it sounds like his
 response.
 Mr. WEISS. It is my understanding that in your testimony before
 the Senate Intelligence Committee during confirmation hearings
 on your nomination as DCI, you stated that you couldn't conceive
 of a situation in which notice of a covert action should not be given
 to the intelligence committees within a few days of its initiation
 and if the President ordered you to do otherwise, you would resign.
 Do you recall giving that answer?
 Judge WEBSTER. That sounds like the substance of what I said.
 Mr. WEISS. Thank you.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. DeWine.
 Mr. DEWINE. Mr. Webster, what did Mr. McMahon tell you
 about that testimony?
 Judge WEBSTER. He told me that he had come to the conclusion
 that whenever there was a problem of this kind that inevitably the

 Agency became the fallguy for it and that from a parochial point of
 view, he thought that it wasn't necessary for the Agency to expose
 itself to this kind of thing because in almost every case, it was able
 to provide notice within 48 hours.
 That was his view of it. He didn't address the constitutional
 question and I don't recall his having considered the outside cir-
 cumstances, the rare circumstance.
 He was tired of having the Agency--
 Mr. DEWINE. Take the hit on it?
 Judge WEBSTER. Right.
 Mr. DEWINE. His perspective was called we say a more narrow
 perspective in that he was looking at it from the point of view of
 the Agency and did not look at the overall global view or some of
 the other possibilities?
 Judge WEBSTER. I think that is correct.
 Mr. DEWINE. There has been a lot of talk this morning about the
 fear that the Canadians had in regard to the embassy situation
 about leaks from Congress.
 We certainly have talked a lot about that. I wonder, though, if in
 your experience other nations have expressed a reluctance to
 either engage in covert operations or maybe even share intelli-
 gence with the U.S. if Congress was notified? Is that a hypothetical
 problem we are talking about?
 In your opinion, is it a practical problem?
 Judge WEBSTER. No. It is a very real problem. It is one that I
 have had to confront from time to time with both expressions of
 concern and indications that certain kinds of information might
 not be available to us because of the perception that too many
 people are involved in preparing the pudding.
 We ourselves have expressed reservations in other countries I
 would rather not name where those outside the intelligence com-
 munity are-in that country are dipping into raw files and, there-
 fore, exposing information we supply to ventilation outside the in-
 telligence community.
 It is an ongoing concern. Sometimes it is over-stated. We are
 dealing with perceptions often more than we are dealing with reali-
 ty. But they do express it, and they exist in a somewhat different
 environment than we do.
 When we try to give reassurances on this, I am not at all sure
 how much we are getting back. We get some tacit understanding
 but I am not sure we are getting the information.
 Mr. DEWINE. Let me read, if I could, to you a quote from Admi-
 ral Stansfield Turner, former CIA Director. This was in testimony
 before the House Intelligence Committee.
 In that testimony he argued that risk is the most important de-
 termination of when to notify the Congress of covert operations.
 The timeliness of notification is not measured by a clock. Timeliness should be
 measured by risk. When that risk to human life is diminished sufficiently is when it
 is timely to notify the Congress.
 Do you agree with that assessment? Do you have a comment
 about that?
 Judge WEBSTER. I think that is probably another way of saying
 what I said earlier. It is time to tell when the need to tell out-

 weighs the reasons for not telling. It is a balancing process in
 which risk definitely plays a role.
 There is no reason not to tell the Congress unless either there is
 a very substantial risk of life-threatening-type situation which you
 must keep to a minimum by confining those who know it or some
 restriction has been imposed by those offering the information on
 further dissemination.
 CONGRESSMAN  HYDE'S BILL PROVIDING  FOR A JOINT INTELLIGENCE
 COMMITTEE
 Mr. DEWINE. We talked a lot today about the potential of leaks. I
 wonder if you have had a chance to look at Congressman Hyde's
 bill which would provide for a joint intelligence committee, a small-
 er intelligence committee, smaller staff combining the two commit-
 tees, the House Committee and the Senate Committee, and if you
 have any comments about that.
 Judge WEBSTER. Some very strong arguments can be made and
 have been made in favor of a joint committee. I think there also
 are some benefits from preserving both the House and the Senate
 Intelligence Committees. I haven't come to a personal conclusion
 about it other than anything that would reduce the numbers of
 people who have access to the information, collectively reduce the
 numbers of people, we would consider a step forward.
 The combined staffs, all the numbers of people where the infor-
 mation is duplicated, I see some benefit in getting by with fewer
 numbers.
 Mr. DEWINE. Fewer people?

 STATEMENT OF HON. CLARK M. CLIFFORD, FORMER SECRETARY
 OF DEFENSE
 Mr. CLIFFORD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 I have a short statement to read. I think it has some importance
 because my approach is so different from that of Director Webster.
 I am pleased to appear before you today to offer my views on the
 subject of covert activity, and in particular, the legislation under
 your consideration for improving the process whereby these activi-
 ties are approved by the President and made known to the Con-
 gress.
 This is a subject of great significance to our nation's foreign
 policy and our system of government. It is also, as we have recently
 seen, a subject of serious potential abuse. Therefore, the Commit-
 tee's efforts are both timely and vital.
 As the Committee knows, covert activities have become numer-
 ous and widespread, practically constituting a routine component
 of our foreign policy. And with these activities have come repeated
 instances of embarrassing failure-where the goals of the oper-
 ations themselves were not fulfilled and unforeseen setbacks oc-
 curred instead.
 I believe that, on balance, covert activities have harmed this
 country more than they have helped us. Certainly, efforts to con-
 trol these activities, to keep them within their intended scope and
 purpose, have failed.
 We have reached the point now where we must reassess the very
 idea of conducting covert activities. If we are to continue with them
 and gain any benefit from them, we must find a way to keep them
 consistent with the principles and institutions of the Constitution
 and our foreign policy. If we determine that this cannot be done,
 then I say we are better off without covert activities entirely than
 with them out of control.
 On this score, we must keep in mind what is meant by covert ac-
 tivities. These are only part, a very small part-perhaps two or
 three percent-of the intelligence activities of our government.
 Covert activities, in my definition, are active efforts to alter politi-
 cal conditions in foreign countries through financial, paramilitary,
 and other means. That the government should want to disavow re-
 sponsibility for such activities is understandable.
 Over the last year or so, the cost that covert activities can inflict
 on our system of government also has been clear. Whatever the
 specific actions or individual responsibility, the sale of arms to Iran
 and the diversion of profits from those sales to the Contras in Nica-
 ragua caused severe damage to our government and the institution
 of the presidency. The President's credibility suffered drastically
 and with it the integrity of the nation's foreign policy.
 One of the principal shortcomings of the Iran-Contra affair was
 the failure of the President to notify the intelligence committees of
 the government's activities. The oversight process could have
 served a significant, salutary purpose: giving the President the ben-
 efit of the wisdom of those who were not beholden to him, but be-

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 05
 holden like him directly to the people, and prepared to speak
 frankly to him based on their wide, varied experience. Had the
 President taken advantage of notifying Congress, he and the coun-
 try might well have avoided tremendous embarrassment and loss
 of credibility.
 The Iran-Contra affair presents this committee and the country
 with a crucial question: should the laws governing covert activities
 be changed?
 To answer this question, we first might examine the attitude of
 President Reagan. In his letter to the Senate Intelligence Commit-
 tee of August 7, 1987, the President said that the current laws are
 adequate and that any changes could occur by executive order. I
 strongly disagree.
 In the Iran-Contra affair, the President displayed an attitude
 that is antithetical to the oversight process. You will recall that
 the President signed a finding that explicitly instructed the Direc-
 tor of the CIA not to notify the Congress of the activity.
 For ten months the Director and others involved abided by this
 instruction. In fact, the President finally notified the Congress only
 after the activity had become public knowledge. Much later, after
 the Congress had begun its inquiry, the President in his letter to
 the committee supported the concept of notification but insisted on
 two exceptions. These exceptions would relieve the President of the
 notification requirement in "cases of extreme emergency" and "ex-
 ceptional circumstances". I suggest to this committee that to
 permit these two exceptions would make the notification require-
 ment meaningless.
 Further evidence of the Administration's attitude is the Justice
 Department's December 1986 memorandum supporting the Presi-
 dent's position in delaying notification for ten months. The memo-
 randum offered the novel theory that the President may himself
 determine what is timely notice based on the sensitivity of the
 covert activity. According to this theory, the President would never
 have to inform Congress of a particularly sensitive activity.
 Moreover, we find that this continues to be the legal theory of
 the Justice Department. In testimony before the Senate Intelli-
 gence Committee in December 1987, a Department representative
 made the following statement:
 There may be instances where the President must be, able to initiate, direct and
 control extremely sensitive national security activities. We believe this presidential
 authority is protected by the Constitution, and that by purporting to oblige the
 President under any and all circumstances, to notify Congress of a covert action
 within a fixed period of time, S. 1721 infringes on this constitutional prerogative of
 the President.
 In other words, it is the attitude of the Administration that,
 whatever laws exist, the President may interpret them as he choos-
 es. This is not the way that I understand our Constitution is sup-
 posed to work. So, my answer to the question confronting us today
 is that the laws governing the oversight process must be changed.
 And the changes must be specific, direct, and as clear as possible.
 I wish to lend my full support to H.R. 3822, the legislation that
 the committee is considering today. Late last year, I testified before
 the Senate Intelligence Committee and supported S. 1721, the com-
 panion bill to H.R. 3822, and earlier this year, I testified before the

 House Intelligence Committee concerning H.R. 3822. I understand
 that all of the committees have worked together on these bills, and
 I 'commend this cooperation, as well as its result. The legislation
 that has been crafted meets the need for change that exists in the
 important area of notification to the Congress.
 H.R. 3822 would require the President to sign a written finding,
 setting forth the particulars of a covert activity, normally when ap-
 proving it but in no event more than 48 hours afterwards.
 The legislation would require the President to provide the intelli-
 gence committees with the signed finding normally before the ac-
 tivity begins but in no event more than 48 hours after it is ap-
 proved. The President could limit notification to the so-called
 Group of Eight, but he would have to explain why he was doing so.
 Findings that purported to validate past activities or authorize ille-
 gal measures would violate the law.
 I view these provisions as welcome and worthwhile improve-
 ments in the oversight process. And the Senate's approval of the
 legislation and the House Intelligence Committee's favorable report
 of it are positive steps that I encourage this committee to follow.
 I would note that I recommended to the intelligence committees
 in my earlier testimony that the legislation be strengthened by in-
 cluding criminal sanctions for failure to notify Congress within the
 required period. Specifically, I proposed that a provision be added
 to H.R. 3822 prohibiting the continued expenditure of funds for any
 covert activity where proper notice was not given, and penalizing
 any government employee who knowingly and willfully violated or
 conspired to violate this prohibition. While the intelligence commit-
 tees did not adopt this proposal, it should remain an important
 consideration for the future.
 Finally, there are two questions concerning H.R. 3822 that arose
 during my previous testimony before the House and Senate com-
 mittees and that you also may wish answered.
 First, is H.R. 3822, particularly the specific-notice requirement,
 consistent with the Constitution?
 I have studied this question extensively. I am convinced of the
 constitutionality of requiring the President to provide notice of
 covert activities within 48 hours of approving them. There is no
 basis in the Constitution for the Administration's claim of plenary
 Presidential power in foreign affairs; rather, Congress and the
 President share concurrent authority in this area according to the
 constitutional system of checks and balances. It is entirely consist-
 ent with Congress' legislative and other enumerated powers to es-
 tablish reasonable procedural regulation of covert activities.
 On this score, it bears emphasizing that the specific-notice re-
 quirement in H.R. 3822 is strictly procedural, not substantive. It
 does not dictate or limit what covert activity the President may ap-
 prove or how or when the activity may occur. It simply says that
 the President must provide notice within a time certain. As the
 committee knows, the oversight process does not give Congress a
 veto, only a voice.
 Notice is an obvious and essential component of oversight, and it
 is the least of what Congress may require in fulfilling its oversight
 function. After all it was by act of Congress-the National Security
 Act of 1947-that the CIA was established and exists today; and it
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 67
 was by this same act of Congress that covert activities were author-
 ized and continue to occur. H.R. 3822 represents a refinement of
 Congress' previous reasonable procedural regulation of covert activ-
 ity.
 Second, is this the appropriate time to enact this legislation?
 Absolutely. Indeed, I believe that the legislation is long overdue.
 We have gone through the agony of covert activity gone awry all
 too often. Change is essential.
 I can recall some 13 years ago testifying before the Select Com-
 mittee to Study Governmental Operations-the Church Commit-
 tee-regarding the gross abuses in covert activities that were the
 concern of that committee. In my testimony in 1975, I said:
 The lack of proper controls has resulted in a freewheeling course of conduct on
 the part of persons within the intelligence community that has led to spectacular
 failures and much unfortunate publicity. A new approach is obviously needed, for it
 is unthinkable that we can continue to commit the egregious errors that have
 caused such consternation to our friends and such delight to our enemies.
 The Church Committee helped enact the 1980 Intelligence Over-
 sight Act, and this certainly was a step forward. But today we
 know that it was not enough. Sadly, my words from 1975 are all
 too pertinent today.
 Now, the nation has endured yet another devastating blow to our
 stature and effectiveness. The Iran-Contra affair demonstrated con-
 vincingly that the flexible requirement of the 1980 Act-that Con-
 gress be notified of covert activity in a "timely fashion"-is too
 easily eluded by expedience. The law must be made explicit and
 firm so that the oversight process functions and the nation bene-
 fits.
 In my view, there is no excuse for failure to notify the Congress
 according to the law, and there should be no exception to compli-
 ance with such law. The purpose of this legislation is not to assume
 good faith but to ensure good government.
 For many years the United States has offered leadership to the
 world because of our character as a nation and our devotion to
 freedom and the liberty of man.
 We have great economic power.
 We have unparalleled military power. But our standing in the
 world community rests mainly upon the confidence and trust that
 other nations have in us.
 We do not hold the free world together at gunpoint.
 It is mutual trust that binds us. And the vital element of that
 trust is our credibility.
 Unfortunately, our credibility has been grievously damaged this
 past year in many parts of the world.
 It is incumbent upon all who are in positions of authority to take
 the necessary steps toward restoring our former position. This leg-
 islation is a splendid move in this direction, and will be of vital im-
 portance in reducing the possibility of another similar disaster.
 Thank you.

 I am pleased to appear before you today to offer my views

 have come repeated instances of embarrassing failure -- where

 unforeseen setbacks occurred instead.   I believe that on
 balance covert activities have harmed this country more than
 they have helped us.   Certainly, efforts to control these
 activities, to keep them within their intended scope and

 legislation is long overdue.   We have gone through the agony
 of covert activity gone awry all too often.   Change is
 essential.
 I can recall some thirteen years ago testifying before
 the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations -- the
 Church Committee -- regarding the gross abuses in covert
 activities that were the concern of that committee.   In my
 testimony in 1975, I said:
 The lack of proper controls has resulted in a
 freewheeling course of conduct on the part. of
 persons within the intelligence community that
 has led to spectacular failures and much
 unfortunate publicity.   A new approach is
 obviously needed,  for it is unthinkable that we
 can continue to commit the egregious errors that
 have caused such consternation to our friends
 and such delight to our enemies.
 The Church Committee helped enact the 1980 Intelligence
 Oversight Act, and this certainly was a step forward.   But
 today we know that it was not enough.   Sadly, my words from
 1975 are all too pertinent.
 Now, the nation has endured yet another devastating blow
 to our stature and effectiveness.   The Iran-contra affair
 demonstrated convincingly that the flexible requirement of the
 1980 Act -- that Congress be notified of covert activity in a
 "timely fashion" -- is too easily eluded by expedience.   The
 law must be made explicit and firm so that the oversight
 process functions and the nation benefits.

 In my view, there is no excuse for failure to notify the
 Congress according to the law, and there should be no
 exception to compliance with such law.   The purpose of this
 legislation is not to assume good faith but to ensure good
 government.
 For many years the United States has offered leadership
 to the world because of our character as a nation and our
 devotion to freedom and the liberty of man.
 We have great economic power.
 We have unparalleled military power.   But our standing in
 the world community rests mainly upon the confidence and trust
 that other nations have in us.
 We do not hold the free world together at gunpoint.
 It is mutual trust that binds us. And the vital element
 of that trust is our credibility.
 Unfortunately, our credibility has been grieviously
 damaged this past year in many parts of the world.
 It is incumbent upon all who are in positions of
 authority to take the necessary steps toward restoring our
 former position.   This legislation is a splendid move in this
 direction, and will be of vital importance in reducing the
 possibility of another similar disaster.
 Thank you.

 COVERT OPERATIONS IN AN OPEN SOCIETY
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Clifford, thank you very much. I appreci-
 ate your testimony.
 I think you raised in addition to the specifics with regard to the
 legislation and the legal matters-and I certainly respect your
 legal ability in the examination of both the constitutional questions
 and the legislative questions-but you also raised a fundamental
 issue with regard to the use of covert operations by an open socie-
 ty, a constitutional republic, in our efforts to deal with an alien or
 a different ideology.
 I find it refreshing that while you are willing to accept the idea
 that perhaps there comes a necessity to conduct a covert operation,
 that in the process, we ought not to change our society or system of
 government. I find it equally as frustrating as many of my col-
 leagues in dealing with the opposition that exists in this world and
 the frustration and the competition that exists, but I find that after
 long experience less than desirable to abolish the Congress, change
 the Constitution, close the society in order to win a fight some-
 where.
 I think we are more intelligent than that. I think we have a
 greater responsibility. I think Mr. Armacost had a more enlight-
 ened view, although he supports the Administration's position,
 when he said that we ought not to engage in the constitutional
 struggle here-I don't think one exists, frankly-but nevertheless,
 we ought to find a practical, sensible way for a democratic society
 to deal with this problem.
 I believe, like you, that this legislation gives us that opportunity.
 I want to thank you, also, for the suggestion you made. I think
 we have to give very serious consideration to this matter of how we
 conduct our covert operations, what responsibility and place, if
 any, Congress is to have, and also how we get a handle on it other
 than the two meat axe approaches that normally we are confronted
 with, which is impeachment of the President, or cutting off all his
 money.
 So I am ready to consider the question that if a finding is not
 presented, if notice is not presented pursuant to the law, then we
 ought to resort to the funding process. That is the only handle Con-
 gress really has.
 PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS THAT COULD HAVE GAINED BY THIS LAW
 I want to thank you for that suggestion.
 Mr. Hyde.
 Mr. HYDE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 It is a real pleasure to meet Mr. Clifford again. Incidentally, just
 commenting briefly on what the Chairman said, you don't have to
 change the Constitution.
 I certainly agree with that, especially if the Constitution is inter-
 preted willy-nilly as silly putty which there is a very extant theory
 that that is proper constitutional interpretation. God forbid anyone
 have original intent on their mind.
 The constitutional system of checks and balances, Mr. Clifford,
 you mentioned, but I did not see in your statement or hear in your

 testimony any comment on the constitutional system of separation
 of powers, which I think is somewhat at issue here.
 Do you feel the Carter Administration was justified in withhold-
 ing notification to Congress of at least three covert actions relating
 to the Iranian hostage situation, the covert reconnaissance and
 preparation for the mission, the actual mission that unfortunately
 was a failure trying to get our people out, and then the assistance
 to Canada, or Canadian assistance to us in getting six of our diplo-
 mats out of the country?
 Do you feel the Carter Administration was justified in withhold-
 ing notification to Congress?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. First, a general statement, Mr. Hyde. Different
 people have different approaches to the whole subject of covert ac-
 tivities. Many in the intelligence community believe that it should
 be a routine weapon that our country uses. I do not.
 I think it is inimical to many of our basic principles. I think it
 should be carefully structured. It should be restricted very, very
 carefully.
 That is why I take the position that I do today. Thus, when
 President Carter was considering the advisability of that venture
 into Iran to rescue hostages, I would much have preferred that this
 law be in effect at the time requiring him to come, let's say, to the
 Group of Eight, and report what it was he intended to do.
 If he had done that, it is entirely possible that wiser heads would
 have persuaded him not to do it. It was a total disaster. It never
 should have taken place.
 It was planned poorly and carried out worse. Anything that
 could have been done to prevent that tragedy would have been a
 benefit to our country.
 Mr. HYDE. Surely you are not referring to the successful part of
 that operation where the Canadian embassy cooperated in our ex-
 tricating six of our diplomats through forged passports and Con-
 gress wasn't told for three-and-a-half months? You exclude that, I
 take it?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. No, I don't. I haven't gotten to that part yet.
 In the first part I was talking about the venture into the desert. I
 thought it was entirely wrong. I think it had no possibility of any
 success.
 Now if he had some agreement, if the Canadians said we will
 help you get six hostages out, I think he should have gone to the
 Group of Eight and reported that to them. That is what I want to
 have take place.
 Mr. HYDE. Breaking his word to the Canadians who insisted they
 tell no one?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. No. No. He wouldn't break any word. If the Cana-
 dians put that restriction precedent on their offer, he would say I
 will come back to you after I have thought this over. I do not want
 the President to be the only individual that makes these decisions.
 We had enough of that under George the Third. I want him to be
 able to come back and consult with the people around him.
 Mr. HYDE. That is--
 Mr. CLIFFORD. Excuse me. I will finish. He must not make that
 sole decision. He must come back and talk to State perhaps, to De-

 fense, and I want him also to talk on the Hill. Then he would have
 gone back to them and said I cannot accept your condition.
 We will have to find another way to get our people out and I
 think we probably would have found another way to get them out.
 Mr. HYDE. We would have done it another way then. All right.
 You are talking about what is desirable.
 I certainly agree. The more advice the President can get from
 reasonable people, experienced people, the better his judgment will
 be. But I think what we are talking about here when we are enact-
 ing legislation is we are mandating certain conduct. From what
 you have said, I take it that you reaffirm your statement in your-
 the sentence in your statement that there is no basis in the Consti-
 tution for the Administration's claim of plenary presidential power
 in foreign affairs.
 Rather, Congress and the President share concurrent authority
 in this area according to the constitutional systems of checks and
 balances.
 Bearing that in mind, I take it you disagree with Thomas Jeffer-
 son who said in 1790,
 The transaction of business with foreign nations is executive altogether. It belongs
 then to the head of that department except as to such portions of it as are especially
 submitted to the Senate. Exceptions are to be construed strictly.
 Or I take it you disagree with Alexander Hamilton who ex-
 plained in his First Pacificus letter,
 It deserves to be remarked that as to participation of the Senate in the making of
 treaties and the power of the legislature to declare war are exceptions out of the
 general executive power vested in the President. They are to be construed strictly
 and ought to be extended no further than is essential to their execution.
 I won't burden you with John Jay's "Federalist" 64, and the whole history of our
 constitutional law that says the President has the executive power and that Con-
 gress has certain specifically defined and assigned responsibilities which are to be
 construed strictly. To say they are both coequals, they are partners in the formula-
 tion of policy, is without constitutional warrant.
 May I have your comment on that?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. Yes. The problem is approached intelligently in
 the Federalist Papers. I call your particular attention to Federalist
 Papers 69 and 75. Where discussed in great detail along with the
 joint responsibility that the Congress and the President have.
 The best modern discussion of the subject which is a very com-
 plex one occurs in the decision of Youngstown Sheet and Tool
 against Sawyer. Justice Jackson, in a concurring opinion, takes
 quite a bit of time and talks about those areas in which the Presi-
 dent has specific responsibility and those areas in which the Con-
 gress has specific responsibility.
 Then he uses an attractive phrase. He says in many areas there
 is the twilight zone, and in those areas which occur over and over
 again, there should be joint responsibility on the part of the Presi-
 dent and the Congress.
 Now, much attention has been given to a case that first came
 up--
 Mr. HYDE. Curtiss Wright?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. Curtiss-Wright, There is some obiter dictum there
 in which the Judge-not in deciding the case-branched out philo-
 sophically. I have read that with interest. I think what he is talk-
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 ing about is that the President is the sole spokesman for the coun-
 try.
 Mr. HYDE. Sort of a Larry Speakes on foreign policy. He is the
 spokesman once the policy is formulated by the Senators, is that it?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. No, once the policy is formulated by the President
 and the Congress working together. But the President is the
 spokesman. He is the day-by-day operator in that area, but in the
 policy field, Justice Jackson says, there should be the closest kind
 of cooperation between them. So that when it is suggested in the
 Justice Department's memorandum that the President is the sole
 determinator of covert action, that the more sensitive it is, the less
 burden is on him to notify the Congress, it is so sensitive, he
 doesn't have to notify them at all-that is what Mr. Cooper from
 the Justice Department says in his opinion-I disagree entirely.
 We do not have any government if the President is able to make a
 decision in which he says this is so sensitive I am not going to
 inform the Congress.
 He might say I am not going to inform anybody, and that is
 when our government breaks down.
 Mr. HYDE. That has happened throughout our history. You know
 that. Time and time again things have occurred that President
 Roosevelt in World War II, President Washington on the Jay
 Treaty, history is replete with examples of the President not, tell-
 ing Congress, for whatever reason.
 I am not saying it is desirable. I am not saying is is helpful. But
 we are talking about the Constitution and what-how Congress can
 legislate a check or a balance that is not in the Constitution and is
 not in the writings of the Founding Fathers.
 Mr. CLIFFORD. And at the same time, Mr. Hyde, there is nothing
 in the Constitution that says that the President shall have plenary
 power in the field of foreign policy. The word isn't mentioned.
 Mr. HYDE. It says executive power. The executive is the execu-
 tive. He is commander-in-chief.
 Congress' powers are specifically enumerated and are to be
 strictly construed if Madison and Jefferson knew anything about
 the Constitution.
 Mr. CLIFFORD. At the same time, if you please, the Constitution
 does specifically give the Congress certain powers in foreign policy:
 the power to declare war--
 Mr. HYDE. They can declare it, but the President has to make it.
 They made a distinction between "declare" war and "make" war.
 We could argue on and on.
 I don't want to trespass on your time. I would like to write you a
 letter at some length and discuss these things more and perhaps
 you would have time to read it.
 Mr. CLIFFORD. I would value that.
 If I might make one concluding comment-thank you so much
 for your discussion. We have had certain tragedies in our country
 these past years. They have occurred in the covert field. In the
 1950s, we made an effort to change the government in Indonesia, a
 total disaster.
 A CIA pilot was shot down. The whole story broke. We were
 doing something we should not have been doing.

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7   81
 You all will remember in the sixties the Bay of Pigs debacle.
 Total and complete disaster. We really got a very black eye out of
 that.
 We came along into the seventies. There we get into that Oper-
 ation Mongoose which some of you may remember. It was a plan
 within the intelligence community to assassinate Castro.
 Mr. HYDE. Mr. Clifford, you forgot Italy right after the war, one
 that worked very well, one that you were involved in.
 Mr. CLIFFORD. That is right.
 Mr. HYDE. Don't miss the successes.
 Mr. CLIFFORD. I was really talking about our disasters. I will go
 back and cover some successes, too.
 We got to Operation Mongoose. The story broke that we had had
 people in Cuba trying to assassinate Castro. We were made to look
 ridiculous. One of the plans we were going to use, considered seri-
 ously by the CIA, was to give him a box of Cuban cigars. When he
 lit one, it would explode and he would be extinguished.
 We then came on and got into Nicaragua and there the CIA
 went down and mined the waters off of Nicaragua. Some of our
 ally's ships ran into the mines. Nicaragua took us to the World
 Court, and we went through the embarrassing experience of having
 to withdraw from the whole matter because we were so wrong.
 But then after all of the efforts made by the Church Committee
 and others to put a stop to it, we came to the greatest debacle of
 them all. That was the Iran-Contra affair. That is when the Presi-
 dent was making speeches in this country to the American Bar As-
 sociation, and, he was going to Japan, saying that we must never
 deal with the terrorist nations.
 The record shows within weeks after each of those speeches, he
 was sending arms to Iran. So our credibility all through the world
 sustained possibly permanent damage.
 I say, Mr. Hyde, we have gotten to the point now that we have
 had so much experience, let us for the first time step up to the
 problem and do what has to be done. That is, require the President
 to notify the Congress.
 Mind you, if by any chance this law suggested that the Congress
 could interfere with the President's decision, then the constitution-
 al question would come into issue. It does not. The President can
 sit down with the Group of Eight and each one of the eight can
 say, Mr. President, you are getting ready to make a very serious
 mistake. He can say to them all, after he listens to them, thank
 you all very much, gentlemen, I appreciate your comments, I am
 going right ahead.
 He has that complete power. They have no involvement in it at
 all because it is the Executive Branch. At the same time, what
 would any of us give if the President had sat down with the Group
 of Eight before he launched us on the Iran-Contra experience?
 It is entirely possible that you would have been able to persuade
 him not to do it. So let's improve our efforts in the covert field.
 Let's keep them to a minimum. And whenever the President de-
 cides then let the Congress know and you might be able to dissuade
 him if it is an unfortunate decision.

 NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT DOES NOT RESTRICT THE PRESIDENT'S
 FLEXIBILITY
 Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Clifford, first let me just extend my apprecia-
 tion to you for your willingness to testify. As your comments in the
 last few minutes have suggested, your vast experience and perspec-
 tive are exceedingly helpful to this committee. We are grateful to
 you for your appearance.
 If I may shift away from the constitutional question, two of the
 arguments you heard this morning presented by the Director and
 by the Under Secretary were, number one, that this notification re-
 quirement restricts the President's flexibility, and the Director
 says, for example, an inflexible notification requirement could
 force a President to choose between providing the congressionally
 required notification within 48 hours and jeopardizing the lives of
 innocent Americans delaying that notification to protect those
 lives.
 One of the arguments made here apart from the constitutional
 question is you are restricting the President's flexibility.
 The second argument that was made is that foreign governments
 won't assist us if the Congress must always be informed. I wonder
 if you could just elaborate quickly on those two things and why you
 think those two particular arguments are not meritorious?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. Yes. I believe there is no merit to the first argu-
 ment. I do not understand it really. The President has conferred
 with his Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, the National Se-
 curity Council, and they decide that they wish to launch a covert
 activity.
 We will call it Project A. They have talked it all out. They be-
 lieve it would help. There is a political situation in some foreign
 country and they make that decision.
 The President reaches that decision on Monday, we will say. All
 I want him to do is to prepare a brief finding, explain it-what it is
 they are going to do-sign it, and send it up to the Hill.
 He could do that on Monday. The bill gives him until Tuesday or
 Wednesday morning to do it. I don't understand that that inter-
 feres with his flexibility. I don't know that it puts people'.s lives in
 jeopardy.
 The fact is that if he got a cable saying you must act within 15
 minutes-that is quite unusual-but if he did, he could go ahead
 and act within 15 minutes, but then notify the Congress within 48
 hours.
 So when they say that the flexibility of the President is adverse-
 ly affected, I do not even understand really what it is they are
 saying.
 On the second question, I was prepared perhaps to make the ar-
 gument that one of you gentlemen had already made, and that is
 that if a foreign power like Canada says we will assist you in gain-
 ing the extrication of your six hostages but, Mr. President, you
 must not notify the Congress, then under this law, the President-
 should say I cannot make that agreement, I am bound by the law.
 And the law says I must notify them in 48 hours.
 So I will not break the law, because the Congress has passed it. I
 vetoed it. They passed it over my veto, so it is the law of the land.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 It is right for the President to say that to them because we must
 not be subject to those condition precedents that foreign govern-
 ments place upon the operation of our government. They say we
 don't want you to notify the Group of Eight. We don't want to
 notify either the Secretary of State or anyone in the State Depart-
 ment. That was discussed earlier. We would never submit to that.
 Let's make it extreme and say, Mr. President, we will agree to do
 this with you only if you do this entirely alone without consulting
 anyone. That is totally abhorrent to our system.
 That isn't the way we run our government. He has the right to
 consult with the people in the Executive Branch and under this
 law, in turn, he must notify the Congress. We build in safeguards
 that way.
 Suppose the Canadian plan was unfortunate. Maybe it didn't
 have merit to it. Yet the President said, all right, I agree to this
 and I won't consult with anybody and I won't consult with the Con-
 gress and it turned out badly.
 I want to tell you our country would be in trouble and the Presi-
 dent would be in even worse trouble. So let's avoid results of that
 kind.
 Mr. HAMILTON. Thank you.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. DeWine.
 EXAMPLES OF COVERT OPERATIONS THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL
 Mr. DEWINE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. Clifford, I wonder if you could give me a little better under-
 standing of the covert operation that you were involved in as far as
 making the policy within Italy and the communists. Could you give
 us a little background about that?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. I missed some of those words.
 Mr. DEWINE. You testified in regard to Mr. Hyde-he asked
 you-he said, Mr. Clifford, weren't you involved in some covert op-
 erations that were successful in regards to the communists in
 Italy? I wonder if you, for the younger members of the committee, I
 wonder if you could give us a little background on that and briefly
 tell us what that consisted of?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. Well, I will with reference to that particular in-
 stance.
 In the Spring of 1948, the Soviets were engaged in a period of the
 most aggressive kind of expansionism. As you know, they had
 taken all of the nations on their western periphery. They were ex-
 tending their influence into Western Europe.
 They established the Comintern which was a communist cell in
 every country. We were watching it carefully because we wanted to
 oppose, of course, the communization of Western Europe. They
 were making more headway in Italy than in any other country.
 The reports came in to us from Italy that the expenditure of some
 wisely placed funds in Italy could be very useful in stopping the
 communist advance in that country.

 84
 So over a period of some months, funds were expended in Italy at
 that time which ultimately led to the Italian decision turning down
 the communist threat. That was one of our successful efforts.
 TESTIMONY GIVEN IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH COMMITTEE
 Mr. DEWINE. Thank you very much. Let's go back to your testi-
 mony in front of the Church Committee, April 26, 1976. I will read
 you a paragraph from that testimony and see if you still agree with
 the essence of these comments. This is your testimony on that date.
 Second, the creation of an effective House, the creation of an effective joint House
 committee to oversee intelligence operations-I consider this the most important
 function of the new law, proper congressional oversight law. Oversight has been
 sadly lacking. I would hope that a small oversight committee of possibly five mem-
 bers of a committee chamber might be created. It should be considered an assign-
 ment of outstanding performance, and members should give necessary time to it. By
 keeping the committee small, security can be maintained and the possibility of dis-
 closures can be minimized.
 I wonder if you still agree with that statement on that day.
 Mr. CLIFFORD. The condition that existed at that time was that
 we did not have any intelligence committee. So the reports came
 into our large standing committees that existed. So the Church
 Committee was searching for a more effective machinery to accom-
 plish its purpose. I supported it. I thought it was a good idea. I
 liked the idea of each chamber having an intelligence committee
 and I liked the idea of keeping them small. And I might say I con-
 tinue to support that position.
 Mr. DEWINE. In fact, on that date you were talking, I believe,
 about a joint committee and small in numbers?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. Well, possibly as time goes on, you go through
 varying opinions. I don't know how strongly I supported the idea.
 Mr. DEWINE. But the size is important, is it not?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. Size, I think, has some influence on it.
 Mr. DEWINE. Expertise in the area?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. Now I am inclined to believe that it is better to
 have separate committees. I think it acts as an additional safe-
 guard, but I believe in confining the size.
 Mr. DEWINE. Thank you very much.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Solarz.
 Mr. SoLARZ. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. Clifford, whenever I hear you testify before our committee, I
 feel more keenly than ever of my own inadequacies. I must tell you
 that I think you are really a national treasure, sir, and it is won-
 derful that you continue to be willing to share your wisdom with
 our committee and with other Members of Congress on these very
 important national issues. You bring to them a clarity of mind and
 a degree of experience which we rarely receive on the Hill. I know
 you have the esteem of all the Members of our committee on both
 sides of the aisle.
 There are some questions that I would like to ask you about this
 legislation. I am concerned about how we actually go about secur-
 ing compliance from the President with the timely notification pro-

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7  85
 visions of the legislation, given the apparent view of the White
 House that these requirements with respect to timely notification
 constitute an unconstitutional infringement on the powers of the
 President.
 What would happen, in your judgment, if the legislation were to
 be enacted even over the veto of the President and then the Presi-
 dent simply refused to notify the Congress in a timely fashion on
 the grounds that he wasn't constitutionally required to do so?
 Would there be any way to bring him into compliance? If not, what
 would we have accomplished by adopting this legislation?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. This is a fundamental problem in the operation of
 a democracy. If the same situation existed in the Soviet Union, the
 matter would be settled very quickly. Somebody would either cease
 to exist or end up in the salt mines of Siberia. But we don't work
 that way.
 The Congress passes a law in the expectation that the Executive
 Branch will comply with it. Our system works that way. It will
 have to continue to work that way even with all its weaknesses, or
 we change from a democratic system to some other system.
 Now, the very concern that you have is the one that prompted
 me to make the recommendation that I did. I have made it before
 the Senate Intelligence Committee and the House committee. I say
 let's put in the law some sanctions, because, as it is now, there
 aren't any sanctions. We have five laws now in existence that have
 to do with how the President will handle covert matters.
 Do you remember the 1980 law, Hughes-Ryan Bill, the original
 act, the National Security Act of 1947 and so forth? To illustrate
 the point that none of those has any teeth in them, I said I could
 imagine a meeting one time in the White House basement presided
 over by Colonel North, and Colonel North is talking about getting
 $30 million from selling arms to Iran and somebody says, "Well,
 Colonel, but how about the laws that are on the books?" And the
 Colonel says, "Well, what are the laws?" And somebody reels off
 five names of the laws. And he says, "What is the penalty for vio-
 lating the law?" And the lawyer in the group says, "There aren't
 any penalties." So the Colonel says, "Please don't bother me; let's
 get on with the meeting."
 Now, that is where we are now. That is where we will be even
 after we pass this present act.
 I was suggesting that you put language in the bill so that in
 those instances in which the President refuses to sign a finding, or
 refuses to send it to the Hill in 48 hours, that refusal automatically
 terminates the President's right to expend any funds. You have
 that right. You are the ones who appropriate the funds.
 Then I would go further and say, if he then has no right to
 expend the funds, he comes under a lot of laws because he is spend-
 ing funds without congressional authority. I go further and say, for
 those individuals working at the time, whether it is a Colonel
 North or an Admiral Poindexter, whoever it might be, if they go
 ahead and expend the funds in the knowledge that they are in vio-
 lation of the law, that is a criminal offense and they are subject to
 trial by jury, and punishment. I think both of those suggestions are
 valid.

 Mr. SOLARZ. I think there is much merit to those suggestions and
 I hope our committee will consider including amendments along
 those lines in the legislation when we mark it up. But I wonder,
 sir, whether you could elaborate on the suggestion by letting us
 know precisely what kind of penalties, presumably criminal penal-
 ties, you would think appropriate here for willful violations of the
 requirement to issue a finding and to notify the Congress.
 Mr. CLIFFORD. I would use the usual language. One penalty is a
 $10,000 fine and five years in the penitentiary. I would put that
 kind of a sanction into the law.
 Mr. SOLARZ. Presumably that would apply to the President him-
 self?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. Well, there you have a very real constitutional
 problem as to whether it applies to the President. I don't know
 that we have to disturb ourselves about that because I think the
 President, any President would be exceedingly loathe to take the
 chance on that and test out the constitutionality of a criminal act
 on his part. But it certainly would apply to everyone else in the
 White House.
 Mr. SOLARZ. Mr. Clifford, how would you distinguish the situa-
 tion created by this legislation, in which an obligation is imposed
 on the President which he believes is unconstitutionally imposed,
 to the situation created by the War Powers Act where another obli-
 gation to report to the Congress is imposed on the President in cir-
 cumstances where our forces are introduced into situations where
 hostilities may be imminent. As you know; every President we
 have had over the last 15 years has believed that that requirement
 is unconstitutional, as a consequence of which they have never car-
 ried out their obligations under the law. And apparently it is
 almost impossible to obtain a judicial determination of the constitu-
 tionality of the issue because the Court believes this is a political
 thicket into which it doesn't want to insert themselves.
 Would this legislation be any different from the war powers leg-
 islation? In other words, if in fact we had a President who believed
 that the requirement to issue a finding and to report it within 48
 hours of the Congress was unconstitutional and stood on his consti-
 tutional interpretation, the law notwithstanding, would there be
 any practical way to hold the President accountable for this viola-
 tion of the law, or to induce him to comply in the first place?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. This law will very likely fall into that same no
 man's land in which the War Powers Act has fallen. Our system
 possibly is inadequate in that regard. There will probably not be a
 resolution one that I can foresee, of the War Powers Act controver-
 sy. There probably would not be one here as far as the President is
 concerned.
 This, however, is sharper and clearer than that act. And I think
 the President would be taking a substantially greater risk in refus-
 ing to comply with this law because it is so specific.
 If, on the other hand, you were to add those two other clauses,
 making it illegal to .expend funds and having those who work for
 the President be -subject to. criminal sanction, then the President
 would be in a very bad situation where the people around him
 could go to prison for violating the law but he claims it doesn't
 apply to him.

 Mr. SOLARZ. I gather your feeling is that with the addition of
 those two provisions and penalties for noncompliance, that the
 prospects for adherence to the law would tilt very significantly in
 the direction of compliance, precisely because of the penalties that
 are in the law.
 Mr. CLIFFORD. I think they are improved considerably.
 PUTTING LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WOULD LIMIT THE PRESIDENT
 FROM INFLUENCING PUBLIC OPINION BY COVERT OPERATIONS
 Mr. SOLARZ. One final question, if I might, Mr. Chairman. I don't
 know if you have a copy of the bill in front of you, but on page 9,
 lines 5 to 7, we find the following provision: "No special activity"-
 and we are referring here to a covert operation-"may be conduct-
 ed if it is intended to influence United States political processes,
 public opinion, polls or media."
 I would like to ask you for your judgment about the appropriate-
 ness and wisdom of including such a prohibition, given the extent
 to which, as I understand it, throughout the course of American
 history, Presidents have often taken actions in order to, at least to
 one degree or another, influence public opinion in our country.
 Part of the responsibility of the President of the United States is to
 maintain public support for policies in which they believe.
 I recall, for example, that one of the factors that led FDR to give
 the go-ahead for the invasion of North Africa was his feeling that
 the American people needed to be shown we were capable of engag-
 ing the enemy somewhere in order to sustain their morale.
 During the Civil War, there were innumerable examples taken
 by President Lincoln to influence public opinion in the north in
 order to sustain support for his effort to preserve the Union.
 So it strikes me that if you take a look at the long course of
 American history, one of the lessons that emerges is that it is le-
 gitimate for a President to take actions abroad to some extent in
 order to influence public opinion at home.
 And if that is the case, I wonder whether you think it would, in
 fact, be appropriate to flatly prohibit any special activity, any
 covert operation if it is intended to influence our political process-
 es, public opinion, polls or media, particularly if the President is
 obligated by law to inform the Congress about the activities.
 Mr. CLIFFORD. I would delete that language from the bill. I think
 it clutters up the bill.
 Also, I can't imagine how in the world you would ever prove a
 charge of that kind as to what was in the President's mind at the
 time. Leave it out. It doesn't help us and just gives people some-
 thing else to argue about.
 Mr. SOLARZ. Thank you very much.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Berman.
 THE WAR POWERS ACT VERSUS THIS LAW
 Mr. BERMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr.
 Clifford, for sharing your thoughts with us on these issues.
 I think initially you made a comment in response to a point that
 Mr. Hyde made, I think it should be clarified. He referred to three
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 8
 covert operations-including the gathering of information before
 the hostage rescue attempt under the Carter administration. It is
 my understanding of the definition of covert activity in this bill
 that that kind of intelligence gathering would not be a covert oper-
 ation. It would be in the realm of intelligence gathering and would
 not require, under this legislation, notification to Congress before it
 proceeded. And I just didn't want to leave that part of it unre-
 sponded to in the record, and I think Mr. Hyde may not disagree
 with that, based on my conversation with him.
 I would like to deal with the issues raised by Mr. Solarz a little
 bit more, the War Powers Act versus this law. The President under
 the War Powers Act is required to submit reports to Congress, very
 similar to the notification requirement under this legislation in
 terms of a direction to provide Congress with information, in a dif-
 ferent fashion, in different situations.
 Why, I am trying to understand, why would criminal penalties or
 an automatic cut-off of funds is any more likely to ensure Presiden-
 tial compliance with this law or would make his willingness to re-
 spond to the mandates of this law any more likely? Is it pretty
 clear that when Congress appropriated funds, if it attaches an un-
 constitutional provision to that appropriation of funds, the Presi-
 dent is under, I think, no obligation to manage his implementation
 of that appropriation, the expenditure of funds according to an un-
 constitutional prohibition, and I am wondering, under what process
 would we ever activate the kind of test of the constitutionality even
 with criminal penalties, even with an automatic cut-off of funds
 provision?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. I can see how that would come about. In the first
 place, this question they raise about the constitutionality of this
 bill that is now before this committee, I don't believe has any merit
 to it.
 Mr. BERMAN. I don't either.
 Mr. CLIFFORD. As you begin to get into it, you begin to find that
 there are all kinds of precedents. All that this asks for is notifica-
 tion.
 Keep in mind, it was the Congress that passed the National Secu-
 rity Act of 1947 that created the CIA. And they put language in
 there that would permit covert activities. Some of us back in those
 years worked on the drafting of the act. And specifically it is in
 there so that Congress has continued control over it. And as for
 those who say you have no right to insert yourself into the question
 of covert activity, I think they are unable to make a case in that
 regard. You passed the law and put the provisions in there; notifi-
 cation has been ruled over and over again to be proper by our
 courts.
 Now, in this particular instance, what we are saying is, "A"
 must give notification within 48 hours. Now, if he doesn't do it,
 then he must not under this law expend any funds for that particu-
 lar covert activity. And if he is doing it, he is in violation of law.
 Presidents have to be awfully careful about that. You know, for
 instance, this is one reason that President Reagan has stayed com-
 pletely away-he admits engaging in the Iran part of that matter
 but has stayed completely away from the Contra part, the funds
 flowing to the Contras. If you begin to get into the business of send-

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7  89
 ing funds to somebody else without authority to Congress, without
 appropriation of Congress, you run into a network of laws. You are
 really in trouble.
 So, I don't believe the President would want to take that risk of
 expending Federal funds when the Congress has said to him, you
 have no right to expend those funds.
 Now, if those around him had knowledge of what has taken place
 and knowledge of the violation of this law, you get a very quick
 test of it because you get a grand jury. You present it to the grand
 jury, they are indicted and you have a trial.
 Mr. BERMAN. Who presents it to the grand jury?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. The Federal Government.
 Mr. BERMAN. Possible, certainly, but if it is the same department
 that is advising the President that it is unconstitutional--
 Mr. CLIFFORD. We are going through that right now.
 Mr. BERMAN. Right.
 Mr. CLIFFORD. We are going through that in the case against
 Oliver North and Poindexter. And you see, the Justice Department
 is supposed to prosecute it.
 Mr. BERMAN. But they agreed to a special counsel.
 I think that as a matter of politics, our leverage is greater in con-
 vincing the President to abide by the law if the potential of the
 fund cut-off or the criminal sanctions exist, but I am still curious
 as to why there is less question about the constitutionality of this
 provision, the 48-hour notice provision and the prior notification re-
 quirement than there is about the reporting requirement under the
 War Powers Act?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. I believe that the other gets into a much broader
 question. It is a clear foreign policy problem.
 The President is handling the day-by-day affairs. He thinks that
 the situation in the Gulf is such that it demands the presence of
 U.S. Naval vessels. It is inherently within the ordinary powers of
 the President so it is tougher to make the case.
 I say that it is easier to make the case in this covert field be-
 cause he should only be using it in the most restricted means
 anyway, and a violation of that, I think, is easy to prove.
 Mr. BERMAN. Thank you.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Levine.
 Mr. LEVINE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. Clifford, let me also join my colleagues in expressing my ap-
 preciation to you for your thoughtfulness and help before this com-
 mittee.
 I would like to stay on the same subject for one moment I then
 have one other area that I would like to explore with you briefly.
 Do I understand correctly, in trying to ascertain your response to
 Mr. Berman's question, that the easier case, if you will, in terms of
 constitutionality is this bill and the issues it raises versus the War
 Powers, that basically you are saying we are here legislating an
 area of intelligence oversight, and that these very intelligence func-
 tions were spelled out pursuant to statute? That therefore exercis-
 ing this oversight, and putting a deadline within the administra-
 tion of this oversight procedure, becomes explicitly a part of the
 delegation that Congress has already provided to the Executive
 Branch? That this, therefore, doesn't move into the grayer areas of

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 90
 war and peace and the questions of war-making that are a part of
 the War Powers issue? Or am I missing something?
 That is how I interpret your response to Mr. Berman, in terms of
 the narrower area that we are dealing with here. I want you to tell
 me whether this is your testimony.
 Mr. CLIFFORD. It is. And let me say parenthetically, that I think
 Presidents should comply with the War Powers Act. Ever since it
 has been on the books, Presidents have raised questions about it.
 I think in those instances in which it is very clear and the degree
 of hostility that has developed in an area becomes clear, I think a
 President could well comply with the War Powers Act. But there
 are all kinds of precedents now of those who haven't, and the area
 becomes grayer and grayer with each passing year.
 This one is sharper and clearer; the language is there. People
 can understand why the Congress feels it should participate in
 these matters, and I think that the President will be much less
 likely to violate this present law than the past law.
 As for this idea of giving timely notice, well, he can construe
 that as giving any notice that he chooses. After this President
 waited 10 months, he got an opinion from the Justice Department
 that said 10 months is timely notice. Now, let's put a stop to that.
 The British have a wonderful term: "That is plain rubbish." And
 let's not go on with it anymore. Let's have it clear and concise and
 the President will know what the rules of the game are.
 TIME REQUIREMENT IMPOSING A TIME REQUIREMENT ON THE PRESIDENT
 FOR NOTIFYING CONGRESS
 Mr. LEVINE. That is the other area I wanted to explore with you
 briefly. Obviously this President has interpreted "timely" to mean
 anything that he wants it to mean, and, in fact, has interpreted it
 to mean no notice at all. But I wonder whether there may be any
 circumstances-and I would ask you to let me know if you think
 there are any-where some middle ground might be appropriate
 between 48 hours and timely notice.
 Mr. Hyde, in his questions-and I unfortunately wasn't in the
 room during his questioning of you, although I was here during his
 questioning of the prior witnesses-continued to provide hypotheti-
 cals in which he argued that 48 hours is simply too restrictive. And
 my question to you is, are there any instances in your opinion in
 which 48 hours is simply too restrictive, or is that rigid require-
 ment appropriate in all circumstances, in your opinion?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. We have to make a policy decision. Are we going
 to leave it up to the discretion of the President as we have in the
 past, or will we have a set of finite, specific rules? I come down
 strongly in favor of the latter.
 Keep in mind, the President wrote a letter to the Senate some
 time ago in which he said, "I am going to go along with the 48-hour
 rule," but he said-and I want to get the language exactly-he
 said, "My obligation to notify the Congress is subject to two excep-
 tions: I will not have to notify you in the event of extreme emer-
 gency; second, I will not have to notify the Congress under excep-
 tional circumstances."
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7  91
 You don't have anything left. You don't go into a covert activity
 unless it is an emergency. You don't go into it unless it is excep-
 tional circumstances. That is the whole theory. But he is saying,
 "If I encounter what we have encountered all through the years as
 an opportunity for a covert action, I am not going to give you the
 notice because I am going to claim, which I have a right to do
 under this rule, that I find that there exist exceptional circum-
 stances."
 Mr. LEVINE. Let me follow up. I understand that this language
 that is presented by the President and that is being suggested as
 an amendment opens the door so widely that we end up back at
 essentially timely notice. But my question is not with regard to
 that particular language. Rather, it is whether in your opinion
 there are any circumstances which would justify more than two
 days as a requirement?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. I do not know of any. This doesn't have to be com-
 plicated.
 An emergency comes up. The President says, "I must meet that
 emergency. ' The President gets on the phone. Maybe the first
 thing he would want to do would be to call the Speaker of the
 House and the Majority Leader in the Senate and say, "I have got
 a very tough situation here. You both happen to be in town; come
 over right away." Or maybe he calls the Chairman of the Senate
 Intelligence Committee and of the House and says, "Can you just
 come over right away? I want to get at you."
 And so he takes it up with them and he explains it to them, and
 they say, "All right. Go ahead and comply. Give us notice within 48
 hours, keep us posted and we will work with you." They might say,
 "We are with you 100 percent. If this is what you think should be
 done, we will support you all the way."
 Now, that is the wary this can work and the way it is supposed to
 work. But what I don t want to have happen-as we have learned
 since this bill was passed 41 years ago, and we started on it in
 1945-is that you leave it up in some way to the discretion of the
 President. Lets have the President clearly in front of him the ne-
 cessity of getting in tough, let's say, with a Group of Eight or nug-
 get it with a Group of Four. If all Four are not in town, then which-
 ever ones of the Four are in town can get right over there. They
 would be there in a half hour. So that I do not see any trouble with
 it.
 Mr. LEVINE. Thank you, Mr. Clifford.
 I will be happy to yield to the gentleman from New York.
 Mr. SOLARZ. Thank you.
 The argument was advanced by the Director that a situation
 could develop in which Congress was not in session and where it
 simply wasn t practically possible to consult with the eight Mem-
 bers specified in the bill within 48 hours. This becomes potentially
 even more of a problem if we were to amend the legislation to in-
 clude your suggestions that penalties be added to the bill for non-
 compliance on the part of the -Executive Branch with respect to no-
 tification within 48 hours.
 What would you think of a further amendment to the legislation
 which would require the President to make a good-faith effort to
 notify the eight Members designated in the bill within 48 hours so

 92
 that if a situation developed where it was simply not possible for
 the President to reach all of them because Congress wasn't in ses-
 sion, that under those circumstances the President would be re-
 lieved of a potential criminal liability for having failed to notify
 one or more of the Group of Eight in spite of the best efforts on his
 part to contact them?
 Mr. CLIFFORD. I would consider it a complication. I think reason
 must prevail here.
 I know what I would do if I were the President and I felt I had to
 move and all eight Members of the Group of Eight were out of town;
 I would sign a finding and I would have it, by hand, delivered to
 the office of each one of the Eight and I would have the operator on
 the telephone at the White House find, start in and find one of the
 eight, maybe find more than that, and say, "A finding has been de-
 livered to the office of all eight Members of the Group of Eight. I
 want to notify you that you might want to get back here and look
 at it."
 I would rather depend on a rule of reason and men working to-
 gether than begin to put language into it that in any way softens
 the requirement of the President to give this notice.
 Mr. SOLARZ. Thank you, sir.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Clifford, I want to thank you very much.
 You have continued to be of great service to this committee and to
 Congress and to the country. You have devoted a lot of time and
 attention to this matter, and we are grateful to you.

 INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT ACT OF 1988
 THURSDAY, JUNE 16, 1988
 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
 COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS,
 Washington, DC.
 The committee met, in open markup session at 1:30 p.m., in room
 2172, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dante B. Fascell (chair-
 man) presiding.
 Chairman FASCELL. The Committee will come to order.
 We meet today to continue the Committee's consideration of H.R.
 3822, the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1987. On Tuesday, the Com-
 mittee received testimony from the Director of the Central Intelli-
 gence Agency and the Under Secretary of State, Michael Armacost,
 followed by the distinguished statesman and former Secretary of
 Defense, Clark Clifford. Each witness on Tuesday and again today
 brings a distinct and useful perspective, based on many years of ex-
 perience, and will undoubtably contribute to a better understand-
 ing of the important issues with which the Committee must deal.
 Before introducing our distinguished witnesses I would like to
 make a brief comment on the prior notice provision of H.R. 3822
 which has generated so much controversy. This provision is in my
 view a modest adjustment to the present law. It sets forth clear pa-
 rameters for concerning Congressional notification to a restrictive
 group in Congress. It does so without restricting the ability of the
 President to respond rapidly in emergency circumstances. Finally,
 I' believe that the prior notice provision gives the President the
 benefit of Congressional counsel on important decisions which
 impact on our foreign policy and national security so as to build a
 consensus on covert operations. It seems clear to me that H.R. 3822
 is a modest response to recent events.
 Mr. Broomfield.
 OPENING STATEMENT OF CONGRESSMAN BROOMFIELD
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you know, at our
 last hearing I explained the reasons why I cannot support this bill
 in its present form.
 There are many constructive elements in the bill which have
 been extensively discussed between the Administration and Con-
 gress.
 Unfortunately, the bill contains the ill-advised requirement that
 covert operations must in all cases be notified to Congress within
 48 hours. I believe this provision to be unconstitutional. I also be-
 lieve that as a practical matter it would impede the President in
 his execution of foreign policy and could prevent our allies and

 friends abroad from cooperating fully with us in difficult circum-
 stances.
 I am especially glad today to have Secretary Carlucci here to
 give his views on the bill, particularly the 48 hour provision. Secre-
 tary Carlucci was instrumental in reforming the operations of the
 National Security Council staff. It was he who implemented the
 recommendations of the Tower Commission, by taking the NSC out
 of covert operations.
 Secretary Carlucci also played an important role in improving
 the Administration's procedures to approve covert action plans and
 notify Congress of them. As National Security Advisor to President
 Reagan, he coordinated the Administration's response to congres-
 sional concerns and assisted in the preparation of the President's
 new National Security decision directive, the NSDD, on this sub-
 ject.
 I believe the Secretary's testimony will demonstrate that the Ad-
 ministration has already taken corrective action to address the con-
 cerns about notification to Congress that were raised as a result of
 the Iran/Contra affair.
 The President's directive specifically addresses the "rare extraor-
 dinary circumstances" in which notice must be deferred beyond 48
 hours. In such cases, the President is committed to review such a
 decision with his senior advisers every ten days. I am looking for-
 ward to Secretary Carlucci's testimony on these points and I am
 also looking forward to asking the Secretary whether inclusion of
 my proposed prepared amendment-which contains a very high
 legislative standard for deferring notice-would cause the Presi-
 dent's senior advisers to recommend that he approve the Act.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Secretary.
 STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK C. CARLUCCI, SECRETARY OF
 DEFENSE
 Mr. CARLUCCI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members of the Com-
 mittee. I am very pleased to be with you today. I do have a pre-
 pared text. With your permission, I will submit that for the record
 and make some brief comments.
 Chairman FASCELL. Without objection, the full statement will be
 included in the record and you may proceed.
 Mr. CARLUCCI. It seems to me, Mr. Chairman and Members of
 the committee, that the Iran/Contra report was very wise in noting
 that democratic government is not possible without trust between
 the executive and legislative branches, and between government
 and the people. There is no question that the Iran/Contra affair
 represented a setback in that critical element of trust.
 The real issue is how we restore the trust. I would submit to you
 today that legislation which lays claim to the prerogrative that
 presidents, and I emphasize the plural, presidents, firmly believe is
 theirs, is hardly the way to restore trust between the executive and
 legislative branches.
 Of course, we all want to have a tight system that governs specif-
 ic activities. We all want oversight. I think congressional oversight
 has proved itself to be valuable throughout the years.

 But who among us can say that some future president will never
 be faced with the kind of situation where he may have to delay no-
 tification of a special activity to the Congress beyond 48 hours?
 And we have a specific case, which I am sure the committee has
 heard about. I will mention it simply because I lived through it. I
 was there when we said, good luck to our people who went in and
 got the hostages out of the Canadian Embassy, and the Canadian
 Government, as you are well aware, said that they would not allow
 us to exfiltrate potential hostages if we were to notify, if we
 intended to notify the Congress.
 Now you and I can say that is wrong, you and I can say the Con-
 gress is worthy of trust. That is not the issue. The issue is what
 other governments believe, and covert action in almost every case
 requires the cooperation of some foreign government; and if the Ca-
 nadian Government, which is a government closest to us and best
 understands our system, makes such a demand on us, what are
 governments less likely to understand our system likely to do in
 the future?
 In fact, had this legislation been law at the time, President
 Carter would have been faced with an impossible dilemma. It is le-
 gitimate, of course, for the Congress to ask how you prevent future
 Iran/Contra affairs. I would simply note, as Mr. Broomfield has
 done, that the President took prompt action when the Iran/Contra
 affair was brought to his attention. He changed the NSC adviser; I
 in turn turned over a substantial amount of the NSC staff. The
 NSC was banned from participating in covert action activities. We
 created an office of general counsel in the NSC, which to this day
 is functioning extremely well.
 We undertook a comprehensive review of existing covert action
 programs. The President also sat through a review program-by-pro-
 gram, and we worked together with the Senate, because the House
 elected not to work with us on this. We worked together with the
 Senate in drafting an NSDD that tightened up the procedures on
 covert action activities, including such things as no retroactive
 findings, written findings and, most importantly for the issue at
 hand, a requirement where in it the President did not notify the
 Congress in 48 hours, the NSPG was to review the situation and
 review the finding every ten days.
 These seem to be appropriate corrective actions. The Iran/Contra
 report said that the laws and procedures which exist are adequate
 to the task, providing of course they are observed. Both the Iran/
 Contra report and the Tower Commission indicated that the failing
 was a failing in people.
 Corrective action, as I indicated, was taken. No amount of legis-
 lation can correct errors of judgment on the part of people, but it
 can stop a President from taking action which he believes neces-
 sary in the national interest.
 I think you need to ask yourselves, will a presidential veto in-
 crease or decrease the degree of trust between the Congress and
 the Executive Branch? I would submit that what you will do is
 create a contentious constitutional argument that will last
 throughout the years, very similar to the argument we are current-
 ly experiencing with regard to the War Powers Act.

 I would ask: Is this worth the gain? In fact, to me the gain is not
 at all clear.
 Before I close, Mr. Chairman, let me mention one specific. I
 notice that Director Webster said that we should not deviate from
 existing practice as to what constitutes a special activity. I think
 that is particularly important, and it is absolutely vital as far as
 the military is concerned.
 Tactical military activities must be distinct from covert action
 activities. We do not want to have a finding every time we deceive
 the U.S.S.R. on the movement of weapons or forces. When I testi-
 fied before HPSCI, Subcommittee Chairman McHugh assured me
 that there was no intention to include under this bill military ac-
 tivities, but I emphasize the point so there will be no misinterpre-
 tation.
 Mr. Chairman, as Mr. Broomfield has pointed out, I lived
 through the lessons of Iran/Contra, I saw the pain it caused the
 President, I saw the mistrust between the Executive and Legisla-
 tive Branches, and I and my colleagues worked very closely with
 the Congress to correct the situation and heal the wounds.
 We are now nearing a period of presidential transition and in my
 judgment we need to pass on a healthy legacy instead of one that
 could plague us for years to come. I urge you not to create a consti-
 tutional confrontation through this legislation.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK C. CARLUCCI, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
 Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank you and the Committee for the opportunity
 to exchange views on the proposed Intelligence Oversight Act of
 1988.        The subject matter of H.R.  3822,  the degree of Presidential
 interest,  and my prior position as National Security Advisor
 during the period when important NSC reforms were made which
 bear directly on these hearings, bring me here on behalf of the
 Administration.
 Today, I would like to offer the Committee my thoughts on
 the proposed legislation, bearing in mind the circumstances
 which prompted the Congress to consider new legislation, and to
 ask whether this bill would improve the situation.   I strongly
 believe that this legislative proposal is the unhappy result of
 a breakdown in consultation between the Executive and Legislative
 branches.   It serves no purpose to cast blame.   An attitude of
 mistrust on both sides complicated the kind of confidence in one
 another which our Presidents and our legislators need in order
 to carry out their respective Constitutional duties effectively
 and successfully.
 The Congressional Iran-Contra report was right when it said,
 "Democratic government is not possible without trust between the
 branches of government and between the government and the people."
 (p.  20)     Those relationships suffered a setback  in the Iran-Contra
 affair, as actions were concealed from-Congress and,  in one key
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 98
 instance,  from the President himself.   An unhealthy lack of
 shared purpose between the Congress and the Executive -- to be
 blunt,  an adversarial relationship -- kept key actors on each
 side from sharing confidences and building a lasting consensus
 which would apply to all of the tools of statecraft which support
 national foreign policy objectives.
 I can think of no step by the Congress which would do more
 harm to the process of rebuilding an atmosphere of trust and
 candor between the branches than unilaterally laying claim to
 prerogatives which the President firmly believes are vested in
 the Executive by the Constitution.   The distinguished Members
 of this Committee are particularly well-versed in the nature
 of exigencies abroad affecting U.S.  interests and the inherent
 limits on our ability to act effectively beyond our borders.
 The founders of this country similarly recognized that compel-
 ling circumstances could require.the Executive to act on behalf
 of  the American people.   Who among us can say with absolute
 certainty that no future President will ever be faced with a
 situation requiring that notification of-a covert action to the
 Congress be delayed beyond 48 hours?
 One recent example, which the House and Senate intelligence
 committees have both discussed in their hearings on the proposed
 Intelligence Oversight Act of 1987,  is the assistance which
 Canada rendered to the United States in 1980 in helping to smuggle
 six American hostages out of Iran.   As one Member of Congress
 who served on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 99
 at the time has testified, Canada had one request in offering
 its cooperation:  that the President not tell the Congress.   Was
 this unreasonable?  You and I might say "yes," believing that the
 Congress could be trusted to protect this information.   But from
 Canada's perspective,  clearly it feared having its own Embassy
 in Teheran laid siege,  as our own had been,  if its assistance
 became known.   President Carter authorized a covert action to
 get those six Americans safely out of Iran.   He did not tell the
 Congress until after the fact.   Some members disagreed but others
 argued that President Carter had done the right thing.
 This example helps us to separate politics from process, and
 to understand how the founding fathers did the same thing when
 they designed our Constitutional separation of powers.   Virtually
 all Americans would regard the rescue of six citizens in that
 situation as a goal justifying covert action, and they would
 view the Government of Canada as a worthy partner in that endeavor.
 Canada's demands for extreme secrecy would also appear reasonable,
 when we recall the climate of danger in Teheran at the time.
 Yet  the cold  fact remains  that  if H.R.  3822 had been the law of
 the land in 1980, President Carter would have had to say "thanks
 but no thanks" to Canada.   What would have happened to those six
 Americans, who were separated from the fifty-two Americans held
 in the American Embassy in Teheran,  no one can say.
 So there  is  more to the 48-hour notification issue than abstract
 theory.   President Reagan's policy, as laid down in NSDD 286,  is
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 loo
 to do precisely what H.R.  3822 would compel him to do -- to
 notify the intelligence committees of covert action findings no
 later than 48 hours after they are signed.   If this policy cannot
 be followed for exigent reasons,  the NSPG is required to review
 the situation every ten days.   We believe the NSDD works well
 with the current statutory framework governing intelligence
 activities.   President Reagan also strongly believes that no
 President can accept a statute that purports to impose limitations
 on a power which the Constitution vests in the Executive and which
 has rested with the Executive since the founding of our nation.
 I respectfully urge the members to reflect on the wisdom of
 the President's position and, beyond this,  to consider the effect
 of provoking a Presidential veto on legislation governing the
 entire realm of intelligence activities.   Will this really improve
 the situation,  or will  it  simply add to the atmosphere of mistrust
 in a well-meaning effort to be certain that never again will an
 admitted mistake be repeated? If trust,  candor and accountability
 are the remedy to the problems which brought about the Iran-Contra
 affair -- as I believe they are -- the Congress risks undermining
 all of those goals, and reintroducing instead an unhealthy adver-
 sarial basis to the oversight process for years to come,  if it
 incorporates a  fundamental Constitutional disagreement into the
 law.
 I have dwelt on this one central  issue because I hope to
 persuade the members that the position taken by President
 Reagan and his immediate predecessors is reasonable and correct.

 Appropriate action was taken as soon as the President became
 aware of the true nature of what had transpired in the Iran-
 Contra affair.   A new National Security Advisor was brought in.
 Judge Webster was nominated as Director of Central  Intelligence.
 President Reagan prohibited the National Security Council  staff
 from participating in covert action, and he upgraded the position.,
 and authority of  the NSC Legal Advisor.
 The President directed that findings be set in writing prior
 to initiation of the covert action.   He ordered a full review of
 ongoing covert actions,  and revised or terminated any which were
 not seen to be necessary or effective.   Under a "sunset" clause,
 Presidential authority for a covert action now expires after one
 year unless he revalidates it.   These and other measures have
 been praised by the sponsors of the companion Senate legislation.
 This is not surprising since we consulted with the Senators as
 we developed our guidelines.
 This is the framework currently in place for the management
 of covert action within the Executive Branch.   Does it have the
 permanence of a statute?   No -- admittedly not.   The next
 President will be entitled to set up his own system of managing
 covert action, consistent with existing law, as will the President
 after him.   However,  if government is to function effectively as
 well as responsively,  there must be a line where the statutory
 framework ends and the President's internal management responsi-
 bility begins.   No two Presidents are alike in their management
 styles.   No two Administrations have used identical procedures

 and mechanisms for recommending options to the President or
 implementing Presidential decisions.   We must allow our Presidents
 to manage, and each President must be allowed to manage his
 Administration in the manner which suits him best.
 Let us remember that the failures of the Iran affair were
 human and managerial.   No statute can prevent these mistakes.
 The Congress'  Iran-Contra investigation led to the conclusion
 that   the Iran-Contra Affair resulted from the failure of
 individuals to observe the law, not from deficiencies in existing
 law or in our system of governance." (p. 423)  With specific
 reference to the existing "laws and procedures to control secret
 intelligence activities,  including covert actions," the congres-
 sional report concluded that,  "Experience has shown that these
 laws and procedures,  if respected, are adequate to the task.   In
 the Iran-Contra Affair, however,  they often were disregarded."
 (p.  375)
 offer no protection from those who would disregard them.   Nor
 would the public good necessarily be served by a framework so
 restrictive that the talents and initiative of law-abiding public
 servants were stifled.   How much better  it would be to have a
 procedural and statutory framework that heals the wounds, provides
 for reasonable safeguards, encourages an atmosphere of trust and
 candid consultation between the branches, and brings the best
 out of our intelligence professionals and public servants.

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 103
 Mr. Chairman, permit me to offer the Committee my vision of
 such a framework.   It begins with the observation, developed
 over several years working with intelligence matters,  that
 statutes  and Executive orders,  no matter how well-crafted,
 can never anticipate every future situation -- nor should they
 attempt  to do so.  Inevitably,  the   intelligence community
 faces unforeseen circumstances, challenges and requirements,
 and must come to terms with them as best it can within the
 existing framework.
 Over time, mutually accepted understandings and practices
 develop in the community and between the branches which become
 part and parcel of the regulatory framework.   Indeed,  this is
 what has happened since the enactment of Hughes-Ryan Amendment.
 I  note  that  the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has
 recognized this, fact.   Its committee report on S.  1721 states
 that the definition of the term "special activity," as used in
 the bill,  "is intended, as written,  to reflect and incorporate
 existing law and mutually-agreed upon practice."  (p.  38)
 Judge Webster recently testified before the House Intelligence
 Subcommittee on Legislation that a deviation from the existing
 practice regarding what constitutes a special activity could
 result in Executive branch agencies having to obtain findings
 for categories of activities that do not require findings today.
 I  support Judge Webster's position that  the Congress should not
 change the existing practice within the Executive branch on
 which activities are governed by a Presidential finding.

 104
 As Secretary of Defense,  I have a particular concern in this
 regard that tactical military activities continue to be understood
 as distinct from covert intelligence actions.   This is not a
 question of what the Congress should be told, but rather a question
 of which activities should require a Presidential finding.   For
 example,  should a finding be required every time we attempt to
 deceive the Soviet Union on the movement of nuclear weapons or
 the capabilities of our own military forces?  Clearly not,
 according to the current definition.
 I hope that the members will recognize the importance of
 preserving the body of mutually-agreed upon practice between the
 branches,  even as we look for new ways to prevent the mistakes
 of the recent past from recurring.   I emphasize this because I
 believe it is important that the House affirm that it is building
 on the existing foundation of understandings, as the Senate has
 done.   Surely we wish to avoid the paralysis which would plague
 Executive departments and agencies if they were suddenly unsure
 whether to seek Findings and report to the intelligence committees
 on categories of activity which previously have not been viewed by
 either branch as requiring such treatment.
 The present system of congressional committees,  in some measure,
 parallels the Executive branch division of labor, and I am confident
 that neither this Committee nor any other intends for H.R.  3822
 to change that.   In this regard,  I was gratified by the verbal
 assurance I received from Chairman McHugh, when I testified
 before the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Legislation in
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7

 March,  that activities traditionally regarded as military.
 activities are not intended to be subject to the covert action
 procedures delineated in H.R.  3822.
 In sum,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  come before this Committee as an
 advocate for learning the lessons of the Iran-Contra matter
 and restoring integrity, accountability -- and yes, vitality to our intelligence activities, which are a small but critically
 important instrument of our national power.,   However,  I  urge
 the Committee to step back from the immediate context, as
 did the founding fathers, and consider the value:and necessity
 of an Executive which can act for the nation in extremis.   Ask
 yourself whether the most honorable and talented of our young
 will join our intelligence services if the bureaucracy is mired
 in an atmosphere of uncertainty and recrimination.   Think about
 how governments and individuals in other countries will regard
 the  risks of cooperating with the United States  if  the Executive
 and the Congress are perpetually at loggerheads on these sensitive
 matters.
 We will not put  the mistrust which caused the Iran-Contra
 affair behind us until we trust each other again.     We have  laws
 and regulations in place today which are quite satisfactory.
 The enormous  repercussions of the Iran-Contra matter have made
 a lasting impression on officials throughout the intelligence
 community that will serve to prevent a recurrence.    I urge the
 Committee to consider the very real adverse consequences of
 attempting to impose a new and inflexible statutory framework on

 our Presidents and our intelligence community.   Let us instead
 test each other's good faith and professional.sm, and give
 responsible officials in both branches a chance to earn each
 other's respect by giving real meaning to the concept of
 consultation.
 Not only does such an approach have the advantage of bringing
 the best out of our public servants:  it is the way the founding
 fathers intended the.system to work.

 Chairman FASCELL. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. The bill as report-
 ed out of the Intelligence Committee and submitted to us, now
 pending before us, makes clear and addresses the issue that you
 just raised with regard to military activity. I don't think, it is cer-
 tainly not my intent, and I think the bill is clear we don't intend to
 have a finding, report or anything else, with respect to military ac-
 tivities under the normal powers of the President who is Com-
 mander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the United States.
 Mr. CARLUCCI. I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Let me also add, I want to express my com-
 mendation to you as one citizen to another for your continued
 public service and your willingness to take on tough jobs, coming
 out of private industry to take on a difficult task at a time when
 the country needed you, and you did a good job with that, and now
 you have moved on to another difficult position which seems to
 have about as many prickly problems as the one you left, and I am
 sure however, that you will address that in the usual manner in
 which you do, which is forthrightly and without fear or favor.
 And that would be very important for the Department of Defense
 it seems to me at this time.
 The issue though on notice, which I think is a modest change in
 the law which has created so much consternation both with CIA,
 the Administration, and you, seems to me to be rather modest, but
 nevertheless I recognize and respect the difference of opinion that
 exists but I submit, Mr. Secretary, that it has raised a different
 issue which has been here all the time and which, for one reason
 or another, we have never confronted directly, maybe because we
 just haven't had to or we didn't want to.
 And that is the whole question of either special activity or covert
 operation. I want to be sure on the record we are speaking the
 same language, so when you are talking special activity, you are
 referring also to covert operation and it is. within the purview of
 the definition now agreed upon in this legislation. Am I correct?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. That is correct.
 Chairman FASCELL. Now, the issue that I see that has been
 raised, Mr. Secretary, and we have had testimony from the director
 of the agency that the special activities part of the covert action
 only takes up 3 percent of their total time or resources or whatever
 the measuring stick would be.
 But, we certainly don't want to in any way interfere with 97 per-
 cent of the activity, which has to do with the very important job of
 intelligence gathering, collection, dissemination, analysis, and all of
 the things that the intelligence community must do.
 So the question comes up then: Under what circumstances, under
 what conditions, if any, should a special activity be entered into or
 a covert operation, and how is that decision made in the United
 States Government?

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 108
 It was authorized by Congress in the intelligence law, now I am
 hearing from people, Congress can't take that away. Well, I am of
 the opinion that Congress can. But that is an argument that can be
 made at another time because there is not legislation pending to
 revoke the authority by Congress for the President to carry out a
 covert activity or a special activity through the CIA, which is basi-
 cally an intelligence gathering institution.
 So the issue that is raised still comes back to those very rare 3
 percent of the cases where this country wants to do something to
 implement its foreign policy and do so in a secret manner, without
 attribution, and to do it safely with protection of the personnel and
 the objective, and how in a democratic society do we manage to do
 that without running into the problem that we ran into?
 It seems to me that notice to four people or eight people in the
 Congress can be equally trusted with knowledge of 200 people in
 the Administration who have to make the decision with regard to
 the matter.
 But, I don't ask you to comment on that, in other words, that it
 is readily conceivable if we are going to have trust, we have to
 have trust on both sides.
 Mr. CARLUCCI. I quite agree with that, Mr. Chairman. I would
 like to comment, though, because I think you have helped to put
 covert action in perspective. I think it has been greatly overblown
 as a foreign policy tool. It is a minor part of the agency's activities,
 and there should be certain criteria for covert action. The most im-
 portant of which is that it cannot be a substitute for policy. You
 have to have the policy first and you have to have clearly defined
 goals, and then you look at all the instruments to implement that
 policy, and covert action in my judgment should be the last instru-
 ment that you look at, and then that should be tied to specific
 goals and there should be a sunset provision as we wrote into the
 NSDD.
 How do you handle the problem of public accountability? I think
 we struck an ingenious solution through the congressional over-
 sight process, which really isn't all that old. It has worked well.
 In my days in the CIA I enjoyed working with the oversight com-
 mittees; they brought a lot of wisdom to bear.
 The only issue we are talking about here are exceptional circum-
 stances, rare circumstances; "rare and exceptional" is the phrase
 that is used in the NSDD, where the President, some future Presi-
 dent for some reason or other cannot notify the Congress within
 any specific time frame. The Canadian Embassy incident is a per-
 fect example of how that could happen.
 In fact, there have been only three instances where the Congress
 was not notified prior to the initiation of the activity, one being the
 rescue operation, the other being the Canadian Embassy operation,
 and the third being Iran/Contra.
 So it would be only in very rare circumstances that we are talk-
 ing about. But we should not deprive the President of that author-
 ity. Then also there is the constitutional argument that I made-
 that is to say, let's not set up a constitutional confrontation.

 CRITERIA FOR INITIATING A COVERT OPERATION
 Chairman FASCELL. Well, we didn't do that, Mr. Secretary, the
 constitutional confrontation was set up by the founding fathers in
 setting up a tripartite form of government with a judiciary, Con-
 gress, and Chief Executive, and we have been living with it now for
 over 200 years, and I dare say we can keep on doing it, but we have
 got to discuss these matters intelligently and with good humor and
 try to arrive at the best judgment we can with respect to our activi-
 ties.
 Now, would you agree that a covert operation, if we are going to
 undertake it and commit the integrity and the sovereignty of this
 government and our people, that we ought to start out, as you say,
 with a clear policy objective, that is number one, we are agreed on
 that; number two, you want to be successful, don't you?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. Yes, sir.
 Chairman FASCELL. Number three, if you are going to bypass the
 Congress in the manner in which you suggest, you had better be
 able to act fast.
 Mr. CARLUCCI. Well, I don't know--
 Chairman FASCELL. The operation better be over quickly because
 it is not going to be secret very long.
 Mr. CARLUCCI. That is probably true. You made an assumption,
 you made an assumption in your earlier statement that 200 people
 in the Executive Branch--
 Chairman FASCELL. Well, 150.
 Mr. CARLUCCI. That really depends on the nature of the action.
 Chairman FASCELL. I will settle for 25 as against eight, whatever
 number. The number is meaningless.
 Mr. CARLUCCI. With something like the Canadian operation, the
 number is indeed very small and people take their responsibilities
 pretty seriously. We have a leaky government, I am prepared to
 grant that.
 Chairman FASCELL. I take it seriously, too. I wouldn't want my
 life jeopardized because of an article that appeared in the newspa-
 per or somebody didn't have sense enough to keep their mouth
 shut, I would not want that either, but all I am saying is if you are
 going to undertake a covert action, don't you agree it better be
 acted upon pretty quickly because it will soon become public
 knowledge.
 Mr. CARLUCCI. Some of them become public knowledge. I have
 had experience with highly successful covert action operations that
 have not leaked. And the term "covert action" has taken on some-
 what of a pejorative meaning. I have seen covert action programs
 that in a number of instances have helped the functioning of demo-
 cratic processes.
 Chairman FASCELL. I am sure that is true, Mr. Secretary. Let me
 lay out another criterion.
 Are we agreed that the CIA should not carry out a military oper-
 ation?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. By and large. They do have-there are cases
 where they get involved in what are called paramilitary types of

 110
 operations, but by and large that should be a function of the Penta-
 gon, yes.
 Chairman FASCELL. Well, I have got some more criteria which I
 think we could reach common ground on, but basically they would
 be the criteria upon which reasonable people would engage in a
 special activity or covert operation, and I would like to explore that
 at length, perhaps at another time, but I have taken enough time
 now, and I will yield to my colleague, Mr. Broomfield of Michigan.
 THE AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE IN
 NOTIFYING CONGRESS
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. Secretary, getting right to the crux of this whole bill, the key
 question is are we going to give any flexibility at all to the Presi-
 dent or are we going to have a rigid enforcement of legislative pre-
 rogatives on every covert activity? I find it quite interesting that in
 the last 12 years under two administrations, as I understand, there
 have only been three instances in which knowledge of covert oper-
 ations has been kept from the Congress.
 Mr. CARLUCCI. That is right.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. That seems to me to be a very, very exceptional
 situation. Let me ask you at the outset, wouldn't you say this is
 veto bait, if this language is left the way it was reported out of the
 Intelligence Committee?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. I have talked to the President about this legisla-
 tion on several occassions and I have no doubt that he would veto
 it if it came to him in its current form.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Carlucci, in the President's National Secu-
 rity Decision Directive, which you helped draft, the President com-
 mitted himself to notifying Congress in virtually all cases. In addi-
 tion, the President and his senior advisers would review a decision
 not to notify Congress every ten days. Is that not true?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. That is correct, sir.
 Mr.  BROOMFIELD. As I mentioned earlier, I will introduce an
 amendment next week to incorporate a very high standard into the
 bill which would nevertheless permit the President to defer notifi-
 cation in certain rare instances.
 Speaking as a representative of the Administration, do you be-
 lieve the Administration could accept a very high standard provid-
 ed it allowed some flexibility?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. I think the Administration could accept a high
 standard providing it allowed some flexibility. It really depends on
 the wording of the standard. I would want a standard that could
 allow another Canadian Embassy rescue operation, for example.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. In what kind of cases do you believe the Presi-
 dent must retain the power not to notify Congress within 48
 hours-a case like the Canadian caper?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. That is probably about as good an example we
 have right now.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Isn't it possible a President could go through
 four or five years without exercising this kind of flexibility?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. I would anticipate that would be the case.

 Mr. BROOMFIELD. I want to assure you I intend to work with your
 legal advisers in trying to come up with legislative wording for an
 amendment that would meet with the approval of the President. If
 that is changed, would the President not in all probability sign the
 bill?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. Let me point out we do have wording in the
 NSDD and that is "rare, extraordinary circumstances." I submit
 that itself is a high threshold.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. If the amendment followed the word of the
 NSDD?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. I am sure that would be acceptable.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. We will be working with you on this.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Solarz.
 IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR EXAMPLE
 Mr. SOLARZ. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. Secretary, it is good to have you with us. It may well be true,
 as my very good friend from Michigan pointed out, there were only
 three instances in the last eight years in which the President de-
 clined to notify the relevant committees of a covert operation in a
 timely fashion.
 But it is also true that one and perhaps two of the three covert
 operations ended up disastrously for the United States. I have in
 mind the Iran-contra affair and possibly the rescue mission for the
 hostages.
 It is entirely possible that if this law had been in place and the
 President had in fact been obligated to report to the eight leaders
 of the Congress, that one or more of them might have persuaded
 the President that this was an unwise action to initiate, thereby
 sparing the country the consequences of these failed missions.
 Mr. Secretary, we have heard from Director Webster, now we
 have heard from you and we have heard from others. As I under-
 stand it, your objections to the provision in the legislation which
 would require notification within 48 hours, if it wasn't possible to
 provide notification prior to the commencement of the covert oper-
 ation, are based essentially on three arguments: first, that it could
 conceivably lead to leaks which would compromise the operation,
 possibly even result in the loss of life; second, the Canadian conun-
 drum which you pointed to, a situation in which the willingness of
 another country to cooperate might be lost because they would not
 want to participate in the operation if they knew Members of Con-
 gress had to be informed; and, third, your constitutional objections
 on the grounds this is an unconstitutional infringement upon the
 powers of the President.
 Let me leave the constitutional question aside for a moment and
 focus on the first two.
 First, with respect to leaks, you served with great distinction for
 several years as Deputy at the CIA, then at the NSC, now as Secre-
 tary of DOD. Are you aware of any instances in which there were
 leaks, from either the Intelligence Committees or the leaders of the
 House, of covert operations about which they had been briefed?

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7112
 THE PROBLEM OF LEAKS, WHEN TOO MANY ARE CONSULTED
 Mr. CARLUCCI. Mr. Solarz, I would prefer not to get drawn into
 that kind of a discussion.
 The candid answer to your question is that I know of instances
 where there has been a substantial chance that the leak came from
 congressional committees, but I think that is irrelevant.
 You will notice I don't even mention, in my prepared testimony
 or in my opening remarks, the question of leaks. I don't think that
 is the major issue. I trust the Congress. I quite agree that the Exec-
 utive Branch is just as leaky as the Legislative Branch, or the Con-
 gress is just as trustworthy as the Executive Branch, whichever
 way you want to put it.
 Mr. SOLARZ. I am pleased to hear that. The fact is, leaks are a
 problem. They are a problem on the Hill, they are also a problem
 in the Executive Branch, and we both have to find better ways to
 deal with it.
 So your objections are really two: the constitutional objection
 and the Canadian conundrum objection.
 OTHER GOVERNMENTS OBJECTING, IF OTHER PEOPLE ARE REQUIRED TO
 BE INFORMED
 Mr. CARLUCCI. Yes, the Canadian conundrum and the constitu-
 tional objection, although I am not prepared to make the constitu-
 tional argument-Mary Lawton can do that-but from my perspec-
 tive, the idea of a constitutional confrontation and the damage that
 can do between the Executive and Legislative Branches.
 Mr. SOLARZ. Let me focus on the Canadian conundrum-that is
 more eloquent than "Canadian caper." There is no pride of author-
 ship here; either will do.
 We are talking about the situation in which we successfully at-
 tempted to retrieve some of our people from Iran with the coopera-
 tion of Canada, and I gather the Canadians would only cooperate if
 the Congress weren't informed.
 I have two points on this that I would like to put forward and
 ask you to respond to.
 The first is that I have a feeling that, particularly with the Cana-
 dians, if this law had been on the books and the President could
 have said to the Canadian Prime Minister, "Mr. Prime Minister, if
 we were proposing to share information about this operation with
 435 Members of the House and 100 Members of the Senate, I would
 certainly understand your concerns, and I wouldn't propose the op-
 erations myself if we had to do that. But we are talking here about
 sharing the information with eight leaders of the Congress, our
 most senior respected Members. They have been informed about
 the most intimate secrets of our nation; I have them at the White
 House weekly for top-level briefings. I have as much confidence in
 them as people in my own Administration and I don't think you
 have too much to worry about." It strikes me that in the face of
 such representations there is a very good chance the Canadians
 would have said, "So long as it is limited to those eight, we can
 accept it."
 The second point I would like to make, Mr. Secretary, is this.
 Presumably the Canadian concern was based on the fear that if
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 113
 Members of Congress, even limited to the top eight, were informed,
 that somehow or other word might leak out. But if that is the case
 it is equally plausible that they might have been concerned, or if a
 similar situation develops in the future another country might be
 concerned, that if the Secretary of State or the Secretary of De-
 fense or other top-level members of the Administration who serve
 on the NSPG--
 Mr. CARLUCCI. National SPG.
 Mr. SOLARZ [continuing]. Are informed, there might be leaks as
 well. After all, in most situations if the Secretary of State, for ex-
 ample, is informed, he usually goes back to his Department, I
 would imagine, as we were told by Mike Armacost, and may call in
 the people who deal with this area or this problem to get their
 advice.
 I assume you probably, with one or two trusted subordinates, do
 the same so you can get the wisdom of your Department on this
 issue.
 If the Canadian Prime Minister or any other national leader
 were to say to the President in the future, "Mr. President, I am
 willing to cooperate with you on this special activity or covert oper-
 ation, but only if you don't say anything to your Secretary of De-
 fense and/or Secretary of State, because, sir, no matter how much
 you respect them, I must tell you I have no confidence that they or
 their Departments can keep a secret," I would imagine the Presi-
 dent would say to him under those circumstances, "Mr. Prime Min-
 ister, if that is the case, then I am afraid we are not going to be
 able to cooperate, because I am not prepared to limit my ability to
 consult my primary advisors on these questions to people whom
 you find acceptable, and I believe I have an obligation to myself
 and the American people to get the advice of those members of my
 Cabinet who have the primary responsibility for dealing with this. "
 Now, if that is in fact the approach the President would take
 with respect to a demand that you not inform a member of the
 Cabinet, why can't the same position be taken with respect to the
 leadership of the Congress?
 I would appreciate it if you could respond to those points.
 Mr. CARLUCCI. You are throwing out hypotheticals, of course. I
 can't second-guess them. It may be possible that the Canadians
 could have been talked into it, had this legislation been in effect.
 We will never know that.
 The fact was that they couldn't be talked into it at the time, -be-
 cause it was our normal practice to inform the Congress.
 Secondly, I am not so sure if I were President-which will never
 happen, of course-and I were forced to make a choice between five
 lives and cutting my Secretary of Defense or Secretary of State out
 of the loop, that I wouldn't cut the Secretary of Defense or the Sec-
 retary of State out of the loop.
 Thirdly, let me point out that foreign governments usually have
 their own reasons, too. It is not solely a question of trust of the
 Congress; they may be worried about the precedent they set in
 their own country-that is to say, if it is a democratic system, will
 their own legislature demand similar access.
 Finally, let me point out that Canada is one of our closest allies.
 It has got a similar system of government. It understands us very
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 114
 well. It is right on our border. Most countries do not enjoy all of
 those happy circumstances. We have to deal with any number of
 non-democratic countries who don't understand the functioning of
 a democratic system, who don't understand the role of the Con-
 gress; and I don't know how many hours, when I was in the CIA, I
 spent arguing with my foreign colleagues that, yes, you can trust
 the Congress, we do have to share information with them, and
 having them turn a deaf ear to that.
 That may not be desirable. It may be a totally inaccurate percep-
 tion, but it is, nonetheless, reality.
 Mr. SOLARZ. Mr. Chairman, if I may ask one final question.
 Mr. Secretary, an effort may well be made to amend the legisla-
 tion before us to provide for criminal penalties for any Member of
 Congress who receives information concerning special activity or
 covert operations pursuant to this legislation, if it is enacted, who
 then engaged in an unauthorized disclosure of that information.
 Now, I know you are opposed to the legislation per se, because
 you think it is unconstitutional, but could you tell us whether you
 think the addition of such an amendment to the legislation, provid-
 ing for criminal penalties for Members of Congress who engage in
 unauthorized disclosures of information of covert activities, would
 be a useful addition to the bill or not?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. Well, this is, of course, a presidential issue and I
 don't think I can speak for him on that point. But my own reaction
 would be no, that would not satisfy the concerns I have.
 Mr. SOLARZ. You would still be against the bill.
 What I am saying, if there is going to be a bill, would you like to
 see such a provision providing criminal penalties to Members of
 Congress or not? If so, why? If not, why?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. I cannot speak for the Administration on this
 point. We would be glad to take it under advisement.
 My personal reaction is that we ought to have stiffer penalties
 throughout the Government, not just the Legislative and Executive
 Branches, for people who leak classified information of any sort.
 I think our espionage act is antiquated. I would like to see it
 modernized and brought up to date, and I think we ought to have
 much tighter penalties for leaking that security information.
 Chairman FASCELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. Hyde.
 Mr. HYDE. I would like to ask Mary Lawton if she might step up,
 if that is all right with you, Mr. Chairman. I want to get a constitu-
 tional opinion from a lawyer.
 Would you identify yourself?
 Ms. LAWTON. Mary Lawton, Counsel for Intelligence Policy, U.S.
 Department of Justice.
 Mr. HYDE. Would you give us your opinion as to the 48-hour
 mandatory notice?
 Ms. LAWTON. I will try to summarize. What is already on the
 record before Congress is largely the Intelligence Committee. But
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :

 the Department's position, the Administration's position, is that
 the 48-hour rule, by tying the President's hands too rigidly in an
 area that is committed to him by the Constitution-the handling of
 the foreign affairs of the nation, the collection of intelligence to
 protect the national security and to react, the reason for the uni-
 tary Executive being precisely that, the ability to react quickly-
 steps over the line of separation of powers.
 Now, we recognize separation of powers is not neat and categori-
 cal, and clearly there are areas where the Congress has a role in
 foreign affairs, there are areas where the President has a role in
 making regulations of a legislative nature, and it can get over the
 line. It is not a neat line, but there is a line. When you tie the
 President's hands so rigidly that you say, "Never under any cir-
 cumstances may you react, Mr. President, to a threat to this nation
 without telling us first," then you have gone over the line of sepa-
 ration of powers.
 Mr. HYDE. Thank you.
 I will yield back my time and save what little 1 have left for Sen-
 ator Cohen, if that happens.
 Thank you.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Berman.
 ESTABLISH LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE NOTIFICATION BY PRESIDENT
 Mr. BERMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Unfortunately I got called out by an appointment I had sched-
 uled and I missed the thrust of your answers to Mr. Solarz' ques-
 tions, but I am interested in this Canadian issue.
 When I first heard about it from-I think Mr. Hyde, in fact-and
 the logic of secrecy and the need for it, it seemed to be an appeal-
 ing case, an appealing, very specific situation that argued against
 the kind of constraint this legislation is viewed by the Administra-
 tion as imposing on it.
 As I think about it more and more, I really wonder just how that
 washes. Of course, the Canadian rescue operation occurred before
 the 1980 amendments which provided the group of eight, restricted
 notice provision, an exception to the Intelligence Committee notifi-
 cation requirements. I think it is important to note that. So the
 specific Canadian issue dealt with a much larger group of people
 than would be allowed now under the law.
 Secondly, you get to this question of "for a worthwhile objective."
 I mean, it gets right back into the arms sales to Iran kind of
 thing-look, we have this important goal to free our hostages, but
 the way to do it is to provide some arms to this country which is on
 our terrorist list, the law doesn't allow it but we have a worthwhile
 objective. I think in retrospect everybody thinks, both on policy
 reasons and on legal grounds, that was not a justified conclusion.
 If we create a constitutional set-up, it is an impossibility for me
 to believe without serious effort by the Administration to persuade
 the Canadians in the situation that is constantly cited, that this
 group of eight-the Speaker, the Majority Leader, the Chairman
 and the Ranking Minority Members of the two Intelligence Com-
 mittees, the Senate Majority Leader-that group of people is some-
 how less trustworthy or more likely to leak than the number of

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 116
 people who by definition will have to be involved from the Execu-
 tive Branch in this particular type of operation.
 You are talking about the true leadership, people who, by virtue
 of their judgment and history, have been elevated to these kinds of
 responsible positions. You certainly have something to say back to
 the Canadians to convince them that it is an unreasonable and im-
 proper and unfortunately illegal expectation that they are asking
 to have visit on you, and to abandon any effort to ensure the kind
 of timely notice the Stokes bill provides, based on this position,
 based on this potential argument, opens up the potential for all
 kinds of evasions of congressional notification, consistently seeking
 third countries setting up requirements that Congress not be noti-
 fied if they are going to be involved in some aspect of a particular
 covert operation as a way of avoiding congressional notification.
 It seems the risk, the harm, the specific situation that occurred
 just two or three years ago in terms of the arms sales to Iran, all
 point out that the risks are much greater from not trying to pro-
 vide a legal framework to ensure notification and not simply to
 rest on the President's interpretation as provided by the Justice
 Department that timely notice means when the President decides
 to give notice.
 You talked about the President's prompt action. The President in
 his own finding in connection with Iran-contra said Congress was
 not to be notified. There wasn't prompt action to deal with Con-
 gress. When it came out and the publicity shined on it, then there
 were a variety of important corrective actions, but at the time
 there was a clear intent to avoid that kind of notification.
 I just don't think the Canadian example is nearly as compelling
 as I did at first blush, and I don't know.if this-this is really not a
 -question; it is just my reaction to the consistent use of this.
 I would like to raise one other issue. You have sort of implied, in
 response to Mr. Solarz' question, that there are questions of con-
 gressional leaks that may very well be out there, even though you
 are not using that as an issue in this discussion.
 Judge Webster two days ago said unequivocally that there has
 never been any evidence of any congressional leaking of disclosures
 prior to the undertaking of covert operations, and the number of
 times the Congress and the Select Committees have been notified
 of those covert operations far exceeds the three times that they
 haven't been.
 Mr. HYDE. Will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. BERMAN. I would be happy to.
 Mr. HYDE. I don't agree with the statement at all. Is the gentle-
 man saying that Judge Webster has said no leaks have occurred
 from the Intelligence Committees on any matters that have been
 disclosed to us?
 . Mr. BERMAN. No. What Judge Webster said was that the prior
 notification to the Intelligence Committees of the intent to under-
 take covert operations has never resulted in unauthorized disclo-
 sures of those covert operations.

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7 117
 Mr. HYDE. I serve on the committee and I could name the gentle-
 man several activities-and I know two that are under investiga-
 tion right now, I hope, by the CIA and the FBI-of leaks from the
 Intelligence Committees.
 I just don't agree with that and I didn't want the witness to
 think he said that.
 Mr. BERMAN. Judge Webster did say it. We can go back to the
 transcript.
 Mr. HYDE. I don't know why he would say that. That is not the
 fact.
 Mr. BERMAN. It is hard for me--
 Chairman FASCELL. If I could interrupt, let's allow the transcript
 to settle that. It will show what the judge said. There is no point in
 discussing that.'
 Mr. CARLUCCI. May I comment?
 Mr. Berman, I would not, of course, argue with what you said
 about the Congress and the high esteem in which one would hold
 the gang of four and the integrity of the institution and the seri-
 ousness with which you take your responsibilities. That is really
 not the issue.
 You reflect on it from your perspective, with all due respect. I
 have spent at least half my life living in other countries of the
 world, including some fairly far out places like Zaire and Zanzibar,
 and I know how they look at us. They don't look at us through the
 same eyes as we look at ourselves. They don't view the Congress-
 Executive Branch relationships in the same light.
 When you talk about legalities in the United States, "You are
 asking us to do something that is illegal", that is a concept that
 doesn't register in many countries of the world.
 There is a view generally that the U.S. Government is very leaky
 and, quite candidly-and I don't want to get into the merits of the
 issue-there is a perception out there that information given to the
 Congress leaks. The issue isn't whether it is true or not; the ques-
 tion is, what is the perception, what do other countries believe?
 You mentioned the danger of evasion. We have had an oversight
 process now for 10 or 12 years. You have got one case that you
 allege there has been what you call an evasion, and I don't want to
 get into the merits of the issue. I made it a point to say I am not
 dealing with the past, I am dealing with the future.
 By and large, the oversight process has worked. What we need is
 that element of trust between the Executive and Legislative
 Branches. We need to work together. We don't need more confron-
 tation.
 If you weigh the two instances-the Canadian rescue operation,
 where lives were at stake, and the Iran-Contra operation, which
 was a foreign policy blunder-and you look at the future and you
 say, "Which is more likely to happen and which is more likely to
 entail painful decisions, heavy responsibilities on the President?
 Will he ever have to move in the future to save some lives?" I don't
 think you and I are capable of making that kind of an assessment.
 I don't think we can predict into the future for the sake of tying

 down presidents to make sure that you will never get a repetition
 of the Iran-Contra affair.
 Secondly, you are going to visit the correction for this error on
 future presidents, not the current President. When we elect our
 presidents, we have to put an element of trust in them; that is the
 only way our system will work, and that is precisely what the Iran-
 Contra report said.
 Chairman FASCELL. The gentleman's time has expired.
 Mr. Solomon?
 [No response.]
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. DeWine.
 Mr. DEWINE. I have no questions, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Gilman.
 Mr. GILMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 We welcome Secretary Carlucci before us.
 Secretary Carlucci, during the course of our testimony, we have
 heard a great deal of issues with regard to the constitutionality of
 several provisions of this measure, and discussion of the bill has
 centered on the absolute 48-hour congressional notification require-
 ment.
 I understand that we have before us--
 Mr. Chairman, I understand that this question has been fully re-
 sponded to. Then I will waive my question.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Weiss.
 CONGRESS' CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY
 Mr. WEISS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. Secretary, do you agree that the CIA exists because of legis-
 lative authorization?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. Well, if you consider-I would defer to counsel on
 this, but the 1947 National Security Act--
 Mr. WEISS. Do you agree that covert activity exists because it is
 authorized by the Legislature?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. I defer to Mary Lawton.
 I think it is inherent in the constitutional authority.
 Ms. LAWTON. There is no legislation that I know of authorizing
 covert action. There are appropriations setting dollar limits on ex-
 penditures. There is no authorization act that I am aware of.
 Mr. WEISS. Congress could, by failing to appropriate funds for it,
 eliminate covert activities; is that correct?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. That is correct.
 Mr. WEISS. Therefore, would you agree that Congress has the
 right, through the appropriation process, to limit the nature and
 extent of covert activities?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. It has the ability, yes.
 Mr. WEISS. All right. So would you then not agree that Congress
 has the power to determine that, regardless of what the time
 period is, there ought to be notification to Congress before or after
 a covert activity is.undertaken by the President?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. Except in rare and extraordinary circumstances, I
 would agree.
 Mr. WEISS. Wait a minute. You agree that Congress has the
 power to make the determination as to notification; is that correct?

 Mr. CARLUCCI. I don't think the Congress has the constitutional
 authority to put a definite time limit on notification, no.
 Mr. WEISS. Well, if we have the right to eliminate it altogether,
 it seems to me we have the right to eliminate it.
 Let me go a step further. Would you think that a four-week noti-
 fication would be unconstitutional, four weeks after the onset of
 covert activity?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. I don't think the time frame is the question.
 Mr. WEISS. Do you think four years would be constitutional?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. I defer to counsel, but I don't think the time
 frame is the issue. The issue is the President's constitutional pre-
 rogatives.
 Mr. WEISS. Ma'am?
 Ms. LAWTON. It is the denial of the flexibility of the President to
 respond, as a unitary executive, to foreign conditions. That is the
 problem, not the time frame, not the numbers notified, but the
 denial of flexibility.
 Mr. WEISS. So whatever time limitation the Congress were to
 place on it, whether it were 48 hours, 48 days, 48 months, it would
 be a violation of the Constitution, in your judgment?
 Ms. LAWTON. If it is that rigidly written, yes, if it permits of no
 exception.
 Mr. WEISS. "That rigidly"-48 months would be a violation of the
 Constitution, in your judgment?
 Ms. LAWTON. Yes, it probably would.
 Mr. WEISS. Probably. Okay.
 I know, Mr. Secretary, you have said you don't want to talk
 about the past but the future, but you came in and took your posi-
 tion because of that immediate past.
 If we were to believe the testimony given by Colonel North and
 some of the other Administration witnesses in the Iran-Contra
 hearings, your predecessor, as Director of the Central Intelligence
 Agency, sat before us and brazenly lied to us as to what in fact he
 was charged with doing and what he had done in relation to the
 Iran-Contra affair.
 We have a finding that the President made a directive to the Di-
 rector of Central Intelligence, that is, not to disclose a certain find-
 ing to Congress. We have an Assistant to the Secretary of State
 who tells us that he lied, told the committee under oath that he
 lied to Congress, he didn't tell the truth because he felt that that
 was the way he would have to testify.
 Now, do you believe that in fact Congress ought then to just sit
 still and accept the possibility of that kind of situation being re-
 peated again and do nothing to try to correct the situations?
 Mr. CARLUCCI. Mr. Weiss, I don t think it is appropriate for me to
 comment on specific situations. But obviously if the Congress feels
 it has been lied to, it has appropriate remedies. I don't think that
 has anything to do with an absolute 48-hour notification require-
 ment. In fact, the Iran-Contra report makes precisely that point,
 that the existing laws and regulations are adequate if observed,
 and the Tower Commission and the Iran-Contra report both said
 these were failings of people. Fine, deal with the people, but don't
 deal with the issue by restricting the authority of future presi-
 dents.

 Mr. WEISS. Mr. Secretary, I remind you, and I close on this, Mr.
 Chairman, we are supposed to be a nation of laws, not of people.
 We have a Constitution and laws so that in effect we don't have to
 rely just on the judgment, good or bad, of individuals. We provide
 very clear-cut statutory or constitutional guidelines for people in
 government to abide by.
 When, in fact, we have a demonstration that the laws have been
 insufficient to give that kind of guidance, or that the existing
 guidelines were brazenly violated, it seems to me that there is an
 obligation on the part of the Congress to correct or to try to correct
 the situation.
 We can't guarantee that there will not be another President who
 will not violate even those guidelines, but at least this Congress, if
 it is concerned about the safeguarding of democracy and the future
 of democracy, ought to discharge its only responsibility.
 Secretary  CARLUCCI.  I would only repeat the Congress' own
 report say the existing laws were adequate if fully observed.
 Mr. WEISS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. The record should show the report did recom-
 mend changes in legislation as the first recommendation.
 Where are we now? Mr. Leach.
 Mr. Secretary, did I understand that you have to leave right
 now?
 Secretary CARLUCCI. I can go through one or two more questions
 if you would like.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Leach?
 We will let Mr. Leach be the last, then.
 Mr. LEACH. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I wanted to raise one or
 two questions that are signature oriented. One requires a Presiden-
 tial signature to be held within the Executive Branch of certain
 covert operations and special operations; second, that it be trans-
 ferred to the Congress.
 It strikes me that there are two problems with at least the
 second aspect. One is that the signed document implies more than
 simply informing eight people in Congress; it implies a document
 that will go into files up on Capitol Hill. That means that there is
 access by more people than simply eight Members of Congress.
 One of the lessons of the Iran-Contra hearings for which there
 has been no comment about, and I think is a rather intriguing di-
 mension, is there appears to be a leakage of papers from those files
 that were developed and they were used for a political purpose.
 One of the candidates for President, for example, was embar-
 rassed by some of the documents that were leaked. So, I don't
 think Congress has as great a record as might be implied by some
 of the earlier questions in terms of leaking papers, although per-
 haps the Members themselves might have a pretty good record.
 I am wondering if you have any concerns at all about signed doc-
 uments by the President coming up here and being placed in files.
 Secretary CARLUCCI. To be quite candid with you, Mr. Leach, my
 preference would be not to have it signed. On the other hand, the
 NSDD we worked on with the Congress did say in paragraph (f)(2)
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :

 that "notification to the Congress would include a copy of the find-
 ing or associated memorandum of notification as signed by the
 President."
 This seemed to be something that was desired on the part of
 those that we consulted with in the Congress. I don't think it is
 anything that is of particular importance to the Executive Branch.
 Mr. LEACH. If one were to offer an amendment to strike the one
 provision, you would have no objection to that amendment?
 Secretary CARLUCCI. I cannot speak for the administration. I
 would personally argue in favor of no objection to that.
 Mr. LEACH. I would only raise one other objection to that whole
 idea of signing. That is, it personalizes policy in some very aggres-
 sive areas and sometimes I think it is better to have policy per-
 ceived to be impersonal, the Government of the United States for
 which a President is accountable. But whether or not there is a
 signed document, that Ronald Reagan certainly was held accounta-
 ble for the Iran-contra issue.
 There are some types of situations that one can envision that I
 think it is just better not to have the President's signature floating
 around in more places than would otherwise be the case.
 So I would personally believe it might be helpful to change that,
 although I do think the larger issues, the notification ones--
 Secretary CARLUCCI. I think you make a good argument on the
 signing issue.
 Mr. LEACH. Thank you.
 I have no further questions.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Bereuter, you have a question before the
 Secretary leaves?
 EXECUTIVE ORDERS
 Mr. BEREUTER. Thank you. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. Secretary, thank you for your testimony. One of the difficul-
 ties that has been pointed out with the NSDD approach is that di-
 rectives can be altered or exceptions could be made to Directive
 286, for example, in a fashion that even the Congress and others
 would not know about any subsequent directive.
 I have been asking members of the Executive Branch relevant
 agencies how could we overcome the difficulty, the lack of trust
 that has occurred. I find the procedures, for example, in NSDD 286
 that have been drafted, to be acceptable arrangements. They pro-
 vide adequate flexibility for the President to act under unusual cir-
 cumstances.
 I think, as I understand it, you are largely responsible for the
 drafting of it, or a major involvement. The answer I got back from
 the people in the Executive Branch is, well, there are some possi-
 bilities of doing this by Executive Order. With executive orders,
 you have higher visibility. The chance for subsequent action on an-
 other directive could not be taken.
 Still, if you simply took the language of Directive 286 and put it
 in Executive Order, you preserve the prerogatives of the President
 to respond to unusual circumstances.
 Would you have any reaction to the possibility of trying to re-
 lieve the problem that Congress has as a matter of trust at this
 point by taking something like the Directive 286 and putting it in
 an Executive Order? Do you think it would have advantages?

 Secretary CARLUCCI. I think the NSDD form is more appropriate
 for this kind of issue, but if this is helpful in terms of getting ac-
 ceptable legislation, I personally would be prepared to recommend
 to the President that he put it in Executive Order.
 Mr. BEREUTER. In that case, we can avoid the statutory approach.
 Secretary CARLUCCI. If we can avoid the statutory approach, I
 would be prepared to recommend that it go in an Executive Order,
 yes, sir.
 Mr. BEREUTER. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. We ap-
 preciate your time, attention and your testimony.
 Mr. Miller, he has got to go. I'm sorry you weren't here when
 that announcement was made, but again, thank you very much.
 Our next witness is our distinguished colleague from the esoteric
 arena euphemistically called "the other body," the distinguished
 Senator from the State of Maine who served on the Iran-Contra
 committee and who is the primary sponsor and supporter of S.
 1721, which is the companion bill to the bill which is pending
 before us that came out of the Permanent Select Committee on In-
 telligence, and was passed in the Senate by a bipartisan vote of 7 to
 19, for which I congratulate you, Senator, and to say that we have
 a difference of opinion in this committee about the validity of this
 particular piece of legislation.
 I don't suppose it would be any surprise to you to have some
 questions that would go to the point. We are delighted you are
 here. I want to thank you very much for giving us your testimony.
 If you like, we can put your testimony in the record in full. You
 can present extemporaneously.
 STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM S. COHEN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM
 THE STATE OF MAINE
 Senator COHEN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
 I see I have lost my audience with the exception of some stal-
 warts over here who I have had the pleasure of serving with on the
 Iran-Contra Committee. The cameras have also exited, so that
 means my remarks before you will be really brief.
 Chairman FASCELL. I won't take that as a personal comment. The
 electronic media, radio is still here. Pencil pushers are still around.
 I wouldn't be forlorn or give up all hope.
 Senator COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I think I can summarize my re-
 marks. My remarks have been distributed to the Members and per-
 haps I can just address myself to a couple of quick points.
 I believe the bill that was passed in the Senate satisfied all of the
 administration's questions with the exception of one. That is the
 48-hour notice requirement.
 Ultimately, it comes down to two questions, I suspect, one of
 power and one of policy. Does Congress have the constitutional
 power to impose such a restriction or requirement upon the Presi-
 dent of the United States. I think we can all cite different scholars
 to support our particular positions-I know that Congressman
 Hyde and others have cited Eugene Rostow-that Congress does
 not have that kind of power.

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7

 I have cited Mr. Louis Henkin, who is a University Professor of
 law at Columbia University, who has indicated that Congress
 indeed does have the power in the field of this type of legislation
 where we are now, that there is a shared responsibility. It is not
 the exclusive domain of the President of the United States, but a
 shared responsibility with Congress.
 So the first question is one of power. We can debate that ad infi-
 nitum. I believe there is a constitutional power. I think Congress-
 man Weiss just a moment ago touched upon it. We have the consti-
 tutional power to prohibit covert actions, period. We can simply
 not fund them through the appropriations process, and there would
 be no covert actions.
 The question has been raised: Is there any authority, legislative
 authority, for covert activities? I might point out that is one of the
 basic differences in our bills. In the S. 1721 we expressly authorize
 covert actions as one part of a number of things that the President
 can call upon to carry out foreign policy. I believe that S. 1721 is
 probably the first place where that authority is actually expressed
 in legislative language. That provision is not contained in the
 House bill. But the question of power is one that we will be divided
 on depending upon your viewpoint.
 Number two, the question of policy is also one of great division. I
 think that the notion that was just advanced a moment ago from
 the Justice Department that notification to Congress inhibits the
 President's flexibility, is preposterous. We are not seeking to pro-
 hibit the President from taking action. There is no allegation or
 suggestion that Congress has the power to prevent the President
 from initiating a covert action or indeed prohibiting it from con-
 tinuing once having been initiated. All the legislation calls for is
 notification.
 It calls for notification not to the full committees of both the
 House and the Senate Intelligence Committee, but to the so-called
 "gang of eight" or "big eight.'
 We went further in the Senate bill and confined it to the so-
 called gang of four. That was not my preference, but that was done
 in order to accommodate some of the opposing viewpoints.
 But I think the notion that has been advanced that notification
 inhibits Presidential flexibility is not one that ought to be accepted
 by the Congress.
 Another point that was made by Secretary Carlucci, was that the
 laws were adequate as revealed by the Iran-contra report. I don't
 believe that was precisely how the Iran-contra report read, at least
 the majority report. There may be a difference of the majority and
 the minority report.
 I think the laws were adequate if they had been interpreted ac-
 cording to the legislative history. When the Intelligence Oversight
 Act was adopted back in 1980, it was contemplated, I believe the
 reading of the history shows, that notice would be given within a
 very short time. Timely notice encompassed a time frame of a
 matter of days.
 I believe, Congressman Hyde, that you raised the issue about
 whether or not the Director of Central Intelligence supported the
 48-hour notice. When Judge Webster was up for confirmation
 before the Senate Intelligence Committee, I asked him whether or
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :

 124
 not he would come to Congress within a matter of a couple of days
 and he indicated he could foresee no circumstance in which he
 would not be before the Intelligence Committee notifying us of a
 covert action-even one involving life-threatening circumstances.
 While he did not indicate he supported the 48-hour notice on the
 legislation--
 Mr. HYDE. May I just discuss that with you for a minute with
 leave of the Chairman?
 Chairman FASCELL. Sure.
 Mr. HYDE. I think I agree that when he was before the commit-
 tee for confirmation, that was his position, and Mr. Gates', as well.
 Then later on, his position is different. His position now is he does
 not think the 48-hour mandate is sufficient, is adequate, is enough.
 To what do you attribute his change? Do you think he is being
 dishonest or the administration has pressured him?
 Senator COHEN. I think given the administration policy, it would
 be very difficult for the Director to come before the Congress and.
 support a notification requirement that was so adamantly opposed
 by the administration.
 I think however, it is important to emphasize what the director
 said at the time: he could foresee no circumstance which would
 prevent him from giving notice to Congress. He would want to
 come.
 Mr. Gates was more emphatic. He said he would be up here
 within a matter of a few days, and if not he might be forced, as I
 recall, even to terminate his service. But he felt pretty strongly
 that notice ought to be given within that 48-hour period.
 Mr. HYDE. Of course, in seeking confirmation one's approach to
 these questions is much more conciliatory than one clinically ana-
 lyzing these things.
 Senator COHEN. I would not disagree with that.
 Mr. HYDE. The director may have had more time since then to
 think about hypotheticals. I intend to give you one later, and I
 think had the director thought of that hypothetical, he might have
 said things differently.
 I thank you, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Senator COHEN. I may have a chance to give my good friend
 some hypotheticals as well. But I think the point has been made,
 Mr. Chairman.
 I believe that Congress has a constitutional responsibility that
 we share with the President in the field of foreign policy. The
 President is not the sole, exclusive architect of foreign policy. He
 may be the executor of foreign policy, the implementor, but he is
 not the sole architect, and we do share responsibilities in that field.
 I think that this power derives from-it is through the appro-
 priations clause. Congress also has the responsibility for the raising
 and supporting of armies and navies. It is through the enforcement
 powers given by the Constitution. So I don't think we have to be-
 labor the point.
 I would just like to make reference to a couple of major differ-
 ences between our two bills. Number one, the language in our bill
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 125
 expressly authorizes the President to conduct covert actions and
 your bill has been changed. The President may- not authorize
 covert actions "unless." So there is a difference that may be one of
 nuance, but I suspect there is fairly strong feeling on that matter
 that the House does not feel it wants to resort expressly to covert
 activities.
 Those of us in the Senate came to the conclusion that covert ac-
 tions are required from time to time. We do not wish to engage in
 a wholesale utilization of covert activity, but recognize as a reality
 that the President may. be called upon to carry out covertly a le-
 gitimate foreign policy objective he could not otherwise carry out
 on an overt basis. That is one difference.
 Number two, your bill does not have the so-called gang-of-four
 option. We limited it in those extraordinary cases to four Members,
 the leadership of both the House and Senate.
 Number three, your bill has. a new definition of covert actions
 and ours is referred to as special activities. Frankly, I do find a
 great deal of difference. I find no objection to the House's reference
 and definition of covert activities with one cautionary note. There
 is a reference in your definition of covert activities that would
 relate to law enforcement actions that,would not otherwise be clas-
 sified as a covert action requiring.a finding.
 I think you ought to exercise some caution in that field, either in
 the statutory language or in report language, to make sure that we
 don't have a situation in which a special activity or covert action, if
 it were carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency-and thus .
 require a finding and notification-could be delegated in some fash-
 ion to another agency to carry out that same activity or similar ac-
 tivity without the requirement of a finding or notice, because the
 action could than be=, classified as a law enforcement activity.
 I think that is something you should look at. carefully, and I
 would be happy to discuss it in a different forum with you.-
 The fourth point: Your bill has a provision which does not
 appear in S. 1721. It requires reports to the Intelligence Commit-
 tees of expenditures of nonappropriated funds available to intelli-
 gence agencies, and frankly, I think that is a good proposal.
 With that, Mr. Chairman, I would yield for your questions..

 PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM S. COHEN
 THANK YOU,  MR.  CHAIRMAN. IT IS A PLEASURE TO APPEAR
 BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TO COMMENT UPON H.R.  3822,  WHICH IS
 PENDING BEFORE YOU.     WHILE I HAVE NOT STUDIED THE BILL IN
 DETAIL,  IT APPEARS SIMILAR IN MOST RESPECTS TO S.  1721,  WHICH
 I  INTRODUCED AND WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PASSED BY A 71-19
 VOTE,   ATTESTING TO THE BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IT RECEIVED
 IN THE SENATE.
 WE WERE ABLE TO RESOLVE ALL OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S
 PROBLEMS WITH THE SENATE BILL SAVE ONE,  THE REQUIREMENT TO
 PROVIDE NOTICE OF COVERT ACTIONS NO LATER THAN 48-HOURS OF A
 FINDING BEING APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT.   I  THOUGHT THEREFORE
 THAT I WOULD CONFINE MY REMARKS HERE TO THIS   ISSUE.
 THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ARGUED THAT THERE MUST BE GREATER
 FLEXIBILITY FOR THE PRESIDENT -- THAT THERE WILL BE OCCASIONS
 WHEN THE PRESIDENT WILL NOT WANT TO COMPLY WITH THIS
 .REQUIREMENT AND TO REQUIRE HIM BY STATUTE TO DO SO WILL,  ON
 SUCH OCCASIONS,  HAMPER HIM FROM CARRYING OUT HIS
 CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF,  AND AS
 THE PRINCIPAL ARBITER AND EXECUTOR OF U.S.  FOREIGN POLICY.

 LET'S EXAMINE THIS ARGUMENT FORA MOMENT.-NEITHER THE
 SENATE NOR HOUSE BILL PREVENTS THE-PRESIDENT FROM INITIATING
 A COVERT ACTION'WITHOUT ADVISING THE'CONGRESS, SO-LONG.AS.?
 NOTICE AFTER-THE-FACT IS PROVIDED WITHIN ' 48. HOURS.   MOREOVER,
 IT MAKES CLEAR THAT CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL'IS'NOT REQUIRED
 EITHER TO.INITIATE OR CONTINUE A COVERT ACTION.   SO,  LET'S BE
 CLEAR.   THE BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE PRESIDENT FROM
 "ACTING."   THE`QUESTION,-.THEN,  IS?,HOW PROVIDING NOTICEITO
 CONGRESS WITHIN 48 HOURS OF AUTHORIZING-A COVERT-ACTION WOULD,
 INTERFERE WITH THE, EXECUTION OF ACTIONS WHICH HAVE ALREADY
 BEEN INITIATED BY THE PRESIDENT.
 THE CONCERN SEEMS TO.BE.THAT NOTICE TO THE-CONGRESS,.
 EVEN THE SO-CALLED.,"GANG. OF EIGHT,"?.OR GANG OF FOUR IN THE-.-
 SENATE BILL,  INEVITABLY INCREASES`THE RISK THAT THE ACTIVITY
 WILL BE DISCLOSED,  AND THAT. WHERE LIVES ARE'AT STAKE,  OR THE
 SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE IS CRITICAL TO THE NATION'S'
 SECURITY,  THE PRESIDENT CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE THE.RISK'OF
 NOTIFYING EVEN A LIMITED NUMBER OF.CONGRESSIONAL
 REPRESENTATIVES.   TO REQUIRE. IT BY STATUTE'THUS WOULD
 INEVITABLY INTERFERE WITH THE EXECUTION OF. THE PRESIDENT'S.
 CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.'              .  .
 ON,A'PURELY?PRACTICAL"LEVEL,  I REJECT THE.NOTION THAT
 INCLUDING EIGHT MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP
 WITHIN THE' CIRCLE OF THOSE 'WHO HAVE TO'KNOW'THAT SUCH
 ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN INITIATED EITHER HAS OR-WILL
 SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE"THE RISK THAT SUCH ACTIVITIES' WILL BE
 DISCLOSED.

 BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, I. REJECT THE.-NOTION THAT THE
 CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONGRESS CAN BE SO
 EASILY OVERRIDDEN:   COVERT ACTIONS FREQUENTLY RAISE SERIOUS

 IMPORTANT.TO'CONGRESS IN TERMS OF ITS CONSTITUTIONAL
 RESPONSIBILITIES TO.ENACT LAWS OR APPROPRIATE FUNDS AS THEY
 MAY BE TO THE-SATISFACTION OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH
 RESPONSIBILITIES.   THESE ARE NOT AREAS WHERE THE PRESIDENT
 EXERCISES EXCLUSIVE. CONSTITUTIONAL POWER.   THE EXECUTIVE MAY
 BE THE IMPLEMENTER,  BUT,IT IS THE LEGISLATIVE WHICH MUST
 AUTHORIZE APPROPRIATIONS FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES UNDER THE
 CONSTITUTION AND LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES.   THE CONSTITUTION
 EXPRESSLY' PROVIDES THAT "NO MONEY SHALL BE DRAWN FROM THE   ,
 TREASURY, BUT IN CONSEQUENCE OF APPROPRIATIONS MADE BYLAW."
 FURTHER,  IT IS MADE-CLEAR BY STATUTE-THAT FUNDS WHICH HAVE

 CONTROLLING COVERT ACTIONS,  HOWEVER,  MUST START WITH
 AWARENESS.   WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE ON THE PART OF THE CONGRESS,
 THERE CAN BE NO CHECK AND BALANCE.   INFORMATION CONCERNING
 SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE ORDINARILY CONFINED TO A RELATIVELY SMALL

 Chairman FASCELL. Senator, I want to thank you very much for
 pointing out the differences in the bills. I think very good points
 were made. We will have to consider those very carefully.
 I just wonder if I have gotten a full understanding, and I don't
 think I have. I detect something going on here with respect to the
 use of words between the Intelligence Community and legislators,
 and I want to be absolutely sure that I understand that we are
 talking the same language or I want to understand that we are
 talking different language.
 A covert activity, to me, simply means that it is secret. Am I
 wrong?
 DEFINING COVERT OPERATION AND SPECIAL ACTIVITIES
 Senator COHEN. It is secret in the sense that it is not intended to
 be made public. That is correct.
 Chairman FASCELL. Now, a special activity infers to me that it
 may or may not be covert.
 Senator COHEN. I think in traditional intelligence parlance, spe-
 cial activity has its own implications and is not designed to be
 made public.
 Chairman FASCELL. All right. So both the special activity and a
 covert operation are both supposed to be secret in the general par-
 lance of the Intelligence Community.
 Senator COHEN. That is correct.
 Chairman FASCELL. There is no presumption as far as you know
 that would indicate otherwise.
 We can carry that presumption one step further, I take it, and
 that is that any activity by the Intelligence Community is covert.
 Senator COHEN. No, that is not correct.
 Chairman FASCELL. Intelligence operations can be open, public?
 Senator COHEN. I think there can be intelligence activities which
 are open and not necessarily covert.
 Chairman FASCELL. They probably ought to be anyway because
 everybody knows about them. People write books identifying all
 the agents, certainly in the countries in which they operate, they
 are well known. That is for sure. In any event, that is another
 thing.
 Now, does special activities, from your knowledge and experi-
 ence, intend to refer to activities carried out by other agencies or
 divisions or departments of government other than the Intelligence
 Community; to wit, other than the CIA or somebody close thereto?
 Senator COHEN. Well, you have a number of intelligence agencies
 that are considered to be within the Intelligence Community.
 Chairman FASCELL. Well, let's consider them all together, all
 right? How about agencies that are not performing an intelligence
 activity, although they may be doing that also, like DIA, for exam-
 ple, and the four units that exist within the services that are also
 doing intelligence plus all the others we have. But how about non-
 intelligence collection dissemination, analysis activities? Does the
 word "special activities" in this bill or your bill cover those non-
 intelligence actions, activities, operations, whatever you want to
 call them, that are not carried out by the Intelligence Community

 as defined in the. generally accepted definition that we understand
 here?
 Senator COHEN. The way in which our bill was crafted was to
 take those activities that would ordinarily be carried out by the in-
 telligence community, one agency or another. If carried out by a
 non-intelligence agency, it would nonetheless be covered. Let's sup-
 pose, for example, the Department of Agriculture -was mentioned
 during the course of our hearings, and was assigned and tasked to
 carry out what otherwise would be regarded as'' an intelligence ac-
 tivity, a special activity. That would be embraced under S. 1721.
 Chairman FASCELL. See, that is not what I am after. I understand
 that. But I am glad to know that that activity would be covered as
 an intelligence related activity. Therefore, it would be classed as a
 special activity and therefore would be covered under the legisla-
 tion, is that right?
 Senator COHEN. That is correct.
 Chairman FASCELL. Okay: Now, what I am referring to is non-
 intelligence activity, a covert operation -carried out by. another de-
 partment of government that is not within the intelligence-
 commu-nity.
 Senator COHEN. If it is a covert activity that would fall within
 the definition of trying to influence the economic, military or diplo-
 matic activities of a foreign country, and in which the U.S. role
 was not intended to be publicly acknowledged, then it would fall
 within the definition of a special activity and would ? be covered
 under the bill.
 Chairman FASCELL. Even though it was covert or even though it
 was open?
 Senator COHEN. That. is correct. If it is covert activity., If you
 have an overt activity-we don't have a problem. Everyone at that
 particular point knows. If you are having a covert activity carried
 out by an agency that does. not normally engage in intelligence ac-
 tivities, it still is covered. -So it is the activity that defines whether
 or not it is covered under the legislation, not the agency itself.
 Chairman FASCELL. Have you got a copy of the bill in front of
 you there? Can somebody get-him a bill.
 Would you take a quick look at zthe definition and educate me as
 to how the definition covers- the U.S. Army?
 Senator COHEN. My insert here says "covert action is any activi-
 ty or activities conducted by an element of the United States Gov-
 ernment to influence political, economic, or military conditions'
 abroad," so the role of the United States Government is not intend-
 ed to be apparent or acknowledged publicly, but does not include-
 and then you go through a list of exclusions.
 Activities, the primary purpose of which is to acquire intelli-
 gence, traditional counterintelligence activity, traditional activities
 to improve or maintain the operational security of the United
 States Government programs or administrative activities. You go
 through a series of exclusions. So you start off with a broad defini=
 tion that means an activity conducted by an element of the United
 States Government.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 I would assume under that definition, the Army, the Navy, or
 anyone else that conducts that kind of activity would fall within
 the parameters of the bill.
 Chairman FASCELL. Okay.
 What troubles me-and then I will yield, I have used too much
 time here, but obviously I think it is an important issue.
 The inference there is that it assumes the delegation at any time
 to carry out a covert activity is proper.
 Senator COHEN. I don't think so.
 Chairman FASCELL. It assumes-excuse me. The presumption is
 that other elements of government can carry out the activity. Oth-
 erwise there would be no reason to cover them.
 Senator COHEN. I think what it is designed to do is precisely
 achieve what we did in the Senate bill, and that is to make sure
 that you don't have an activity normally classified as a special ac-
 tivity being assigned to a non-intelligence agency, and thereby
 escape the oversight provisions. You have gone about it differently,
 but I think the intent is quite the same.
 What you have done is say a covert action embraces any activity
 by any arm of the government that is designed to achieve the fol-
 lowing goals except-and then you except in four cases. Activities
 primarily to gather intelligence, that would not be covered.
 Traditional diplomatic or military activities, that is different
 than a cover operation, traditional law enforcement activities.
 Here, again, I would urge some caution. I think you ought to look
 at this very closely either in report language or statutory language,
 to make sure that you don't have an expansion of law enforcement
 activities, broadened by various agencies to thereby justify taking
 actions which otherwise-if they had been taken by an intelligence
 agency-would be covered.
 And then number four, routine support to the overt activities,
 that is excluded. So I think we have done the same thing. I have no
 problem with the House language.
 Chairman FASCELL. Thank you very much.
 Mr. Hyde.
 PEOPLE WHO ARE FOR AND AGAINST THE BILL
 Mr. HYDE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Well, Senator Cohen, it is a pleasure to see you here in the lower
 chamber visiting the campesinos of Congress. I must say, you are
 looking very well for your ascendency to Mount Olympus to which
 we all aspire with some longing, and unrequited love.
 Now, I know you have got John McMahon on your side, although
 John McMahon told Judge Webster the reason he said that is the
 CIA is going to get it in the neck anyway. That is what Judge Web-
 ster said, and I am sure John McMahon said that.
 I know you have got Morton Halperin on your side. I know that.
 On my side, if I may aggrandize them, there is Judge Webster,
 there is Secretary Frank Carlucci, former Deputy Director of the
 CIA, former National Security Advisor, now Secretary of Defense.
 There is Richard Helms, there is William Colby, there is Stansfield
 Turner, there is Zbigniew Brzezinski, Lloyd Cutler, Henry Kissin-
 ger, Brent Scowcroft, and many more.

 Are all those bipartisan Democrats, Republicans, are they dead . .
 wrong and you and Mort Halperin right?
 Senator COHEN. I think you omitted Robert Gates, someone who
 has certainly served as long in the CIA as you and I have in Con-
 gress.
 Mr. HYDE. You refused to confirm him.
 Senator COHEN. I think that is unfortunate. There is a man who
 has been on the front lines and he favored very strongly notifying
 Congress within two or three days at the most.
 Mr. HYDE. Well, three days is hardly 48 hours.
 Senator COHEN. If it is a question of time-I think the question
 was asked over here by-Mr. Weiss-if it is three days or four days,
 if you want to make it a week, I don't have a problem with the
 specific time frame. But the position of the Administration is that
 any time frame is unconstitutional and I think that is wrong. .
 Mr. HYDE. Well, Stansfield Turner said that the notice should
 not depend on the tick of the clock, but the nature of the operation.
 Now, I find that to make sense. Now, you linked Stansfield Turner
 with Admiral Poindexter. I guess Admirals somehow have less
 credibility than normal- citizens, but I think that makes a lot more
 sense than a rigid, mechanical 48 hours. That is just our differ-
 ences of opinion.
 Now, you referred to the President's role in foreign policy as he
 may be the sole spokesman?
 EXECUTIVE/LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY IN CONDUCT OF FOREIGN POLICY
 Senator COHEN. Architect.
 Mr. HYDE. Then you said the sole implementer-page 57 of
 March 3rd of this year. Parenthetically, he is hardly the sole
 spokesperson when you have the Speaker of the House conferring
 with Daniel Ortega; you have Congressmen of the Dear Comman-
 dante letters. The President is hardly the sole spokesperson. Every-
 body, as Secretary Shultz says, wants to get in the act.
 But continuing, you seem to describe your partnership with the
 President somewhat imprecisely. You referred to it as less than a
 full and collegial power in the formulation of foreign policy, and
 then it seems to me something more than a simple-I quote, using
 your words "simple limited advisory counsel," that most Presidents
 would like to maintain. So there is a never never land in between
 being full and equal partners and more than, a simple advisory
 counsel. You have created a new status for the Senate and it is
 somewhere in between, which I think is fascinating, if not precise.
 Now, you attribute your authority, your constitutional and prag-
 matic authority, to do this because of the power of the purse among
 four other reasons. The power of the purse, being the most persua-
 sive to me. The others I think are not, and we will discuss them,
 and I don't want to take all afternoon on this, although it is inter-
 esting. But surely the power of the purse doesn't give you the right
 to impose something that is unconstitutional.
 For example, if you were to pass a law denying the Supreme
 Court salary unless they passed, decided a certain case in a certain

 138
 way, clearly that would be unconstitutional and improper. So the
 fact that you have the power of the purse doesn't authorize you to
 do unconstitutional things. You would surely agree to that, would
 you not?
 Senator COHEN. Indeed I would. In fact, if you had read all of
 my--
 Mr. HYDE. I did. I am ready to discuss them seriatum.
 Senator COHEN. If you will look at Professor Henkin's, I think,
 brilliant article, he points out there is a difference. When there is
 clearly an exclusive exercise of power, power reserved for the
 President, then it would be unconstitutional for Congress to try
 and inhibit that action by the power of the purse.
 However, where there is a so-called twilight zone of concurrent
 responsibility, Congress has every power to exercise.
 Mr. HYDE. Now we get to the heart of the matter, which is the
 grant of the executive power by Article II to the President, the ex-
 ecutive power. But then Congress gets such powers as are "herein
 granted" and it is axiomatic, Hornbook, constitutional law that
 those specific grants are to be strictly construed.
 Now, Clark Clifford moved into another area called "modern in-
 terpretation." I suppose this is in the wake of the Bork affair that
 we now no longer have original intent interpretations and we are
 on new thresholds, new penumbra surround these ideas.
 Senator COHEN. Do you want to include Clark Clifford, along
 with Mort Halperin?
 Mr. HYDE. By all means. Clark Clifford taking time out from rec-
 onciling presidential candidates who are ostensibly dissimilar but
 called identical, yes. He is a master. But in any event, then you
 talk about the power to declare war. Surely that is an anacronym.
 Surely you know no more wars will be declared. I mean, Korea was
 certainly not a state of peace. Vietnam, one of the great traumas of
 this century, and Congress didn't declare any war.
 Senator COHEN. Are you talking about power or policy, Congress-
 man? Are you talking about the inherent power or policy?
 Mr. HYDE. I am talking about the facts of life. I am talking about
 the fact that this country can be in a state of shooting, killing, bel-
 ligerency without Congress declaring war. Surely you are familiar
 with the debates in the Constitutional Convention about "making"
 war and "declaring" war. So, I mean that doesn't persuade me. Not
 that you need to persuade me, but I am just suggesting that it is
 unpersuasive.
 Then you have Congress' power to raise an army and maintain a
 navy. But surely the President has the right to send the Army
 where he wants to send it, so insofar as you have provided it to
 him, right?
 Senator COHEN. Assuming that Congress continued to appropri-
 ate the money necessary to carry out the action, yes.
 Mr. HYDE. Sure. But if you didn't, maybe he could get some vol-
 unteers-Green Mountain Boys.
 Chairman FASCELL. He would just use the budget, if the gentle-
 man will allow me to intercede. We have so much unobligated, un-
 spent money in the pipeline, if you got the money off tomorrow,
 you would be a long time seeing the end of your policy.
 Mr. HYDE. I couldn't agree with you more, Mr. Chairman.

 You said this notion that "somehow the President isn't the myth-
 ical, exclusive possessor of power in the field of foreign policy." I
 don't know anybody that asserts that. That is a straw man. Nobody
 says he is the exclusive possessor. If you read the Constitution you
 know that there are shared powers. There are complementary
 powers, but to say all powers are collegial, there is no warrant for
 that historically or in the Constitution.
 Senator COHEN. I think you are contradicting not only me but
 yourself. You pointed out, when you opened up, that I had indicat-
 ed, we were not collegial partners in this, we are. a more limited
 power in that regard: That is why if we were collegial, we could
 prevent the President from either initiating or preventing covert
 actions.
 Mr. HYDE. You don't disagree with Edwin Corwin or so many
 other constitutional authorities that Congress and the President
 are not constitutionally equal in power with respect to all aspects
 of making. a-conducting policy. Congress has enumerated legisla-
 tive powers, the President, the executive power. In some areas Con-
 gress is clearly .supreme, in others the President.
 Only Congress can: appropriate money, declare war, and enact
 laws. Only the President can nominate and remove high officials,
 recognize foreign governments; and conduct foreign. relations, else
 why the Logan Act?
 So you will agree then we are in a new, murky area, are we. not,
 on this new status of Congress?
 Senator COHEN. I think it is called the twilight zone of responsi-
 bility, concurrent authority.
 QUESTION- OF MANDATORY NOTICE TO CONGRESS .
 Mr. HYDE. Now-I thank the Chair for indulging me just briefly
 for a few more minutes.
 You also said this, Senator. The reference to the Canadian inter-
 vention or help in extracting hostages out of Iran is cited as the
 premier example of why we should not have mandatory notice. The
 fact is that this law of notification was not in place at the time
 that took place. The law was modified and changed in 1980, which
 was after the extrication of those hostages occurred. So we cannot
 cite the Canadian example as evidence that notice was not given or
 timely notice was not given and not explained about.
 The fact is, there was no notification requirement, as there was
 in 1980. This occurred prior to that time. Did you mean that?
 Senator COHEN. The 1980 Act confined the notice requirement to
 the intelligence committees. Prior to that time, under Hughes-Ryan
 I believe, there were about eight committees that would have had
 to have been notified, and I think that was the concern. Under that
 framework many people involved as opposed to regime of the 1980
 Act in which only "gang of eight" would have been involved.
 Mr. HYDE. So you do agree that timely notice. was required and
 none was given because the Canadians said we are not going to co-
 operate if you tell anybody; right?
 Senator COHEN.  There, I would disagree. with you. That is a
 matter that I think requires some exploration.
 I would suggest you call Admiral Turner before we discuss it.

 Mr. HYDE. We have and he is the one that cites that.
 Senator COHEN. I would say I am under a different impression in
 terms of the degree of opposition. But in any event, if we are going
 to accede to the notion that a third country is going to determine
 whether or not they cooperate and whether or not notice is given, I
 think you might as well just give up the whole notion that you
 have congressional oversight on covert actions.
 Mr. HYDE. Well, I couldn't disagree more. I think in a very dan-
 gerous world, with terrorists, there are going to occur times-and
 Lloyd Cutler said it, he said nobody is smart enough to imagine the
 circumstances that can occur where the flexibility,, maneuverabil-
 ity, wiggle room, elbow room, may be absolutely indispensable to
 save lives.
 I agree with him there. Just let me make one more point. There
 is so much more, but I don't want to impose and trespass on my
 colleagues here. But I think it is a measure of the gravity of the
 problem that none of the bill's proponents, Senator, express any
 real concern about leaks.
 On the contrary. They are minimized and you have said, I think
 ,somewhat ingenuously, that nobody in the Intelligence Committee
 has ever leaked about a covert activity.
 Leaks are endemic. Leaks are all over the place.
 Let's talk about the Iran/Contra Committee, which was com-
 posed of congressional leaders (myself excepted).
 We have three of them up here on the top row, I will say, and
 one right here, a premier Member right here. May I say that so
 tight was security that when Admiral Poindexter was deposed, the
 chairman wouldn't let any of us attend. No Members were permit-
 ted.
 I wonder why? I wonder why? I know why. That was rhetorical.
 The members might leak.
 Let me just read you a very sanitized list of leaks from that Com-
 mittee.

 Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
 Now--
 Senator COHEN. You left one out and that was the disclosure of
 the minority report in The New York Times before it was supposed
 to be released.
 Mr. HYDE. All right. That, too; that, too.
 I know you weren't sympathetic to the minority side, so you may
 well be critical of that.
 Now, I don't think our allies or friends or people from whom we
 seek cooperation make that fine distinction that you made that
 covert operations weren't leaked, although I could name you sever-
 al covert operations that have leaked.
 The problem with naming them is you confirm them and that
 makes it very difficult. But I have a bookful of classified leaks,
 some of which are still under investigation and, surely, Senator,
 knowing the former chairman of your committee and the former
 vice chairman of your committee, the difficulties they had with se-
 curity, keeping secrets and knowing that our committee lost a very
 valuable Member of that issue fairly recently, isn't it pushing
 things a little to say that there aren't serious leaks around here?
 Senator COHEN. I believe the statement I made that I am not
 aware of a leak about a covert activity since I have been on the
 committee is accurate as far as my service in the Senate. I can't
 speak for the House.
 You may have more information on it than I certainly. But I am
 not aware of any covert action ever being leaked by any Member of
 the Intelligence Committees.
 Mr. HYDE. I am aware of no prosecutions. I am not aware the
 FBI has ever asked me a damn question. I have never been asked
 to take a polygraph nor has any Member of our Committee, but I
 would sure like to see it happen and I would like to see your com-
 mittee get polygraphed and get investigated because this place
 leaks like a sieve and nobody cares and that is why nobody wants
 to talk to us, because it gets in the paper and lives are at risk.
 Unless we recognize the problem and stop pushing it aside or re-
 defining it out of existence, nobody is going to cooperate with us.
 We can pass all the laws we want and let's get it down to 48 min-
 utes. Nobody is going to trust us and I will tell you, we are going to
 get into a situation with biological warfare sometime and we are
 going to need somebody to penetrate the office of somebody at the

 U.N. to get that secure and they are not going to cooperate with us
 because they can't trust us. Then we will have it on our hands.
 But this law won't protect us.
 I have said enough and I really appreciate the indulgence of the
 Committee. I will be quiet for a month. I owe you that much.
 Senator COHEN. Mr. Chairman, if I could respond briefly.
 Chairman FASCELL. You have got equal time, Senator.
 Senator COHEN. If that were the- case that there was so much
 leaking going on--
 Chairman FASCELL. You can say for the record all of the other
 leaks made on the other side because I am sure they would fill vol-
 umes, too.
 Mr. HYDE. If you are speaking of the administration, I concede
 that.
 Chairman FASCELL. No, no. I think there were some left out of
 this list I recall.
 Mr. HYDE. I have a bigger list; but for security reasons, these are
 the most innocuous and benign.
 Thank you.
 EXECUTIVE BRANCH COMPLIANCE WITH NOTIFYCATION.PROCEDURES
 Senator COHEN. If I Might just point out, if that were the case we
 would have to raise the issue of why the Administration. for the-
 past eight years notified Congress of all of these covert activities?
 If they were so fearful that each one would be disclosed;. I am
 sure they would have raised the issue and not abided by what I be-
 lieve the law to have been.
 The fact is that they have, with the possible exception of the
 mining of the harbors of Nicaragua, informed our Committees of
 each and every activity, and these apocalyptic results have not oc-
 curred;
 I respectfully suggest there has been a good working relation-
 ship. They have complied with the law and what changed was
 Iran/Contra.
 Now, in their dissenting views to the House Intelligence Commit-
 tee report Congressmen Hyde, Cheney, Livingston and others on
 page 4, I believe there is an inaccuracy.
 At the top of that page, it reads, "A number of persons involved
 in reviewing, approving and notifying Congress of covert actions
 failed to follow established procedures."
 I think that is wrong. They followed the procedures directed by
 the President of the United States. Those engaged in the sale of
 weapons to Iran followed the procedure by the President specifical-
 ly directing no notification.
 So it wasn't as if they were off on their own not notifying. That
 was a specific directive by the President of the United States.
 The second point I would make again on page 9, "Foreign coun-
 tries will refuse to cooperate." I would assume if we accept that po-
 sition that third countries will not cooperate, then for all practical
 purposes, any President can say in the future that I am sorry, we
 are going to carry out this covert action, but X country said they
 wouldn't cooperate; therefore, we had no alternative but not to
 notify Members of Congress until after the action had been com-
 pleted.

 TIMELY NOTIFICATION TO CONGRESS
 If you accept that proposition, then you have surrendered any ef-
 fective oversight action. And if that is the case, so be it. But I think
 we ought not to be heard to complain at some future time. If a
 future President-I know that Mr. Hyde would agree-if, for exam-
 ple, President Dukakis should come to office and decide that- he
 would like to covertly assist the ANC or some of the Front Line
 states with military equipment and consider that activity to be so
 highly sensitive that notice should not be given to Members of Con-
 gress, I would assume Congressman Hyde would be one of the first
 ones that would want to complain about the fact notice was not
 given about a secret transfer of weapons to the ANC.
 Mr. HYDE. Just for a second let me just make one comment. I
 think the President has got to notify Congress of any covert activi-
 ties, especially high risk. I think there is no question about that. I
 think there is no question that that law, "timely fashion," was vio-
 lated egregiously by this administration in the Iran Contra, and I
 agree that had the President consulted with anybody on the Hill,
 Bob Michel, somebody that he had confidence in, Senator Bob Dole,
 yourself, anybody, it never would have happened.
 I agree with all those things. But I don't agree that we can cap-
 sulize a time limit and force him in every circumstance, to disclose
 within 48 hours. I can imagine a Codel kidnapped in the Middle
 East and I can imagine people willing to help saying you tell Con-
 gress and we won't cooperate. We despise Israel. We don't want
 anything to do with Congress. You want our help, you do it our
 way.
 What do you do if you are President? You don't stand on your
 high horse and say you are not telling us how to run our country-
 you say what do you want to help get these people freed, which is
 what really happened in the hostage situation here.
 Senator COHEN. That is also in Iran Contra, what do you want to
 get these guys out and that is part of the problem.
 Mr. HYDE. It is part of the problem.
 Chairman FASCELL. If you had a Codel, I am afraid he would just
 leave us there. You could always declare war, though, when in
 doubt.
 Senator COHEN. Part of the difficulty-if I might, Mr. Chair-
 man-in saying timely notice was egregiously violated is how do
 you know it has been violated either in an egregious or nonegre-
 gious fashion. The Justice Department has interpreted Section
 501(b) of the Act to say that timely notification means whatever
 ti       the President says it means. So if the President declares 10 months
 is timely, then we are bound by that interpretation, and that is the
 difficulty we have had.
 Prior to the Iran Contra affair, there was a working understand-
 ing that there be prior notification, but in the absence of prior noti-
 fication notice within a matter of a couple of days. Now, the Jus-
 tice Department has said that, no, the President has unfettered dis-
 cretion to determine when and if he is going to notify the members
 of the Committee and that is part of the dilemma we are trying to
 resolve.

 Mr. HYDE. Senator, I reject that opinion and so does everybody
 on this committee. The President doesn't have unilateral authority
 to make that judgment and bind us. Everybody agrees ten months
 is not timely fashion. But don't put him in a straight jacket where
 human lives are at stake. That is my point.
 Mr. WEISS. Yield?
 Chairman FASCELL. He doesn't have the time. Let me get back in
 order here because I know the Senator has to get back over there.
 They are voting on nominations. I am just teasing, just teasing.
 Mr. Berman?
 CONGRESSIONAL RESPONSE TO EXECUTIVE NONCOMPLIANCE
 Mr. BERMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Senator
 Cohen. We think you are okay even though you are in the Senate. I
 just might initially point out that Secretary Carlucci emphasized
 45 minutes ago that no part of his opposition to this bill has any-
 thing to do with a belief or a concern that notifications to the
 group of eight, the group of four, the Intelligence committees, en-
 hances the likelihood of leaks which could undermine covert oper-
 ations.
 He made that position very, very clear. He raised the Canadian
 issue. He raised the Constitutional confrontation. He specifically
 waived any reliance on this notion of leaks as an argument to be
 against this bill. I think since the administration is leading the op-
 position to this legislation, that was a useful indication of their
 premises.
 I would like to- ask you several questions. Mr. Clifford came here
 a couple of days ago. Let me put it a different way. Let's walk
 through this legislation. Let's assume that legislation passes the
 House along the lines of a bill that has passed the Senate. It is rec-
 onciled in a conference committee, sent to the President, he signs
 it, lets it go into law without his signature. He vetoes it, but the
 veto is overridden in both Houses and it becomes law. The question
 of how this becomes different than the War Powers Act in the
 sense of congressional ability to put meaning into this, to deal with
 the problem of a President who believes it is unconstitutional and
 we have had the coal miner case and others on the question of who
 has the power to decide constitutionality, but if there is no method
 of enforcing it, we have a real problem here.
 Clark Clifford suggests one of two things, either an automatic
 cut-off of funds under our constitutional power of the purse and the
 power to appropriate funds, where the timely notification provi-
 sions, as provided in this legislation are ignored, or criminal sanc-
 tions for those who violate the provisions of this law or engage in
 covert operations in violation of this particular law.
 I think a big part of his reasoning as to why these kinds of provi-
 sions would be helpful in that in some almost intangible fashion
 they would cause a President to think much more carefully about
 failing to notify Congress, not so much that the criminal prosecu-
 tion could test the constitutionality or the expenditure of a lawsuit
 over the expenditure of funds would be meaningful, but that it
 would create an atmosphere which would give the law the kind of
 teeth that it might not otherwise have.
 What do you think about those suggestions?
 Senator COHEN. Well, I would prefer the self-enforcing mecha-
 nism of the cut-off of funding over that of imposing criminal sanc-
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 tions against employees acting under the instructions of the em-
 ployer; namely, the President of the United States. I would prefer
 the former to the latter. But I frankly would prefer we not do
 either in order to get a bill that would be acceptable to the Senate.
 I think that to the extent that that kind of provision were includ-
 ed, it would make it more difficult to sustain or override a veto
 which is expected on this legislation.
 Mr. BERMAN. So if for no other reason, than, just simply going
 through more than an academic exercise this year we should re-
 strain ourselves?
 Senator COHEN. I think to the extent we pass this, obviously a
 future President who feels very strongly that he or she maintains
 the inherent constitutional authority not to notify Congress under
 any circumstance until long after a covert action is complete, that
 particular President is willing to risk a constitutional confrontation
 and turn it to the courts and the kind of paralysis that we saw
 during the past year, I think we have to accept that as part of our
 system.
 I think we can raise the stakes in terms of the visibility of the
 law, that our interpretation of timely notification means timely
 within a certain time frame and if a President chooses to violate
 that and challenge us, then we have to either await a court deci-
 sion, which I doubt very much that a court would consider the
 issue, preferring rather to declare it to be a political question. You
 will end up with a political confrontation in which the kind of pa-
 ralysis that afflicted the Reagan Administration would occur again.
 But there is no way, in my judgment, in which you can possibly
 insulate future Presidents against the temptation to go beyond
 what we believe to be the constitutional limitations and say that I
 have the power and therefore I am going to exercise it. I don't
 think imposing criminal penalties would do it and I don't think
 that, frankly, the cut-off of the funds would prevent him. I think
 that would be the more preferable solution to the criminal, but I
 think the bill as written is sufficient.
 GROUP OF EIGHT VS. GROUP OF FOUR
 Mr. BERMAN. Is there any rational reason why in recognizing in
 unique situations the need for a smaller group, now the gang of
 eight, that the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member of the
 two Intelligence committees, the committees that deal with Intelli-
 gence activities that have specific information that have a context
 to analyze what is being suggested, that they should not be part of
 that group, in other words, that the gang of eight, group of eight,
 provides the logical tight-knit group rather than the Senate group
 of four?
 Senator COHEN. I don't question that. In fact, I argued that on
 the Floor myself and frankly, I felt that in order to strike an ac-
 commodation with those Members who still were reluctant to
 impose this mandatory notification in order to satisfy their con-
 cerns about the possibility of leaks as articulated by Congressman
 Hyde, that we would narrow the circle of those who were informed.
 My own view is I would prefer to keep it eight, but if we keep it
 four I would prefer it to be the House and Senate leadership of the
 Intelligence committees, those who do have some context in which
 to place the notification given by the administration.

 146
 Frankly, it was necessary to get the bipartisan support on such a
 broad basis that I agreed to accept the four instead of the eight.
 NOTIFICATION TO INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES
 Mr. BERMAN. Turning to another issue, is it your understanding
 that the Senate bill requires that when the group of eight or the
 group of four is notified of a covert operation that at some point
 the obligation still remains on the Executive Branch to notify the
 Intelligence Committees?
 Mr. COHEN. I think there is a difference here that in those rare,
 special circumstances where the utmost confidence is required I
 think the Administration has latitude in terms of when it notifies
 the entire committee, and when it consults with the Chairman and
 Vice-Chairman of the Intelligence Committees.
 They still have an obligation to notify the entire committee. I
 can think of examples.
 Mr. BERMAN. They still have the obligation.
 Mr. COHEN. They have an obligation todo so, but the time frame
 in which they have that obligation would vary.
 Mr. BERMAN. Oh, no, I understand that, but the notion that they
 have absolved themselves of their notification obligations simply by
 notifying the group of eight is contrary to what you think is good
 policy and is the law?
 Mr. COHEN. But it would depend upon the time frame under
 which the rest of the Members would be alerted.
 SEPARATING COVERT ACTIONS FROM DOMESTIC POLITICAL
 CONSIDERATIONS
 Mr. BERMAN. That is a variable.
 What was the purpose of the provision in the Senate bill, I think
 there is one in the House bill as well a finding. may not authorize
 any action intended to influence United States political processes,
 public opinion, policies or media, and I guess-I understand the
 certain logic, these covert operations are not to provide, they are
 not for domestic political purposes. But this is vague language.
 What good are we getting from this language?
 Mr. COHEN. You said it precisely. We don't want the CIA or
 other intelligence operations to carry out covert operations to influ-
 ence our domestic political situation. We don't want any agency to
 engage by way of example in disinformation.
 You may recall a proposal that was disclosed in the Washington
 Post, came out of the NSC, to plant a false story that would there-
 by be repeated by American journalists and have some impact
 upon our policy. That is something that we wanted explicitly to
 reject.
 Mr. BERMAN. But there are some covert operations that have
 concluded successfully, can have a side effect of positive political
 benefits for the Administration and vice versa.
 Mr. COHEN. You mean in other countries?
 Mr. BERMAN. Yes, covert operations. Oh, is your point where the
 covert operation is taking place or its purpose?
 Mr. COHEN. I have to listen to your question again. I am not sure
 which section you are referring to.

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Mr.  BERMAN.  I  am referring to Section 503(a)5 of your bill,
 and--
 Chairman FASCELL. It goes to a question of intent, whether what
 country it takes place in, domestic or foreign, and if it is going to
 the question of intent, you know you don't have to scratch at it,
 but you can certainly include it because all of them are going to
 have some impact when they become public.
 Mr. BERMAN. A finding may not authorize any action intended-
 it just seems to me it is worded in a funny way, it gets into matters
 of intent and motivation in a fashion that is going to have very
 little legal benefit and maybe messed up the whole picture.
 Mr. COHEN. No, what I think it is saying we don't want to have a
 finding in which the President authorizes action that may be car-
 ried out in a foreign country that is designed specifically to have
 an influence on our own domestic political process, public opinion
 policies or media and to carry that out on a ,covert basis, in other
 words, to subject our own political process with money that is ap-
 propriated by U.S. dollars to carry out a covert action.
 Chairman FASCELL. Will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. BERMAN. I certainly will.
 Chairman FASCELL. How are you ever going to find that out, Sen-
 ator? You don't think the President is going to put that in a find-
 ing, do you?
 Mr. COHEN. One would hope. Nonetheless, I think it is important
 to specify.
 Chairman FASCELL. No, I understand. I understand.
 Mr. BERMAN. All you are saying, you want to purify the formal
 finding. The notion of what the motivations are for a President en-
 tering into a finding are going to be so, both easy and difficult, easy
 to fathom and difficult to prove that I wonder what we are getting
 from this.
 Anyway, I don't want to dwell-if I might, Mr. Chairman, I
 would ask one last specific question on the bill.
 Mr. COHEN. Counsel just advises me we took this restriction out
 of the Executive Order, so we are simply repeating what has been
 the Executive Order for the last eight or 10 years.
 Chairman FASCELL. Is this a National Security directive?
 Mr. COHEN. Executive Order 12333.
 Mr. BERMAN. The one that originally authorized the covert oper-
 ations?
 Mr. COHEN. Well, there has been an Executive--
 Mr. BERMAN. The presidential findings.
 Mr. COHEN. There is an Executive Order that has been in exist-
 ence how many years now? Since 1980.

 or acknowledged publicly and functions in support of such activi-

 es, public opinion policies, or media.
 48-HOUR CLOCK STARTS WHEN-FINDING IS SIGNED-
 Mr. BERMAN. I see. Finally, do you think there-is a 48-hour obli-
 gation under. your bill or there should be in law from the time a
 finding is made-let's say there is a two-week lapse of time be-
 tween the finding and the commencement of a covert operation.
 Is the obligation to report a 48-hoar obligation after the finding,
 or is it a 48-hour obligation after a finding when the covert oper-
 ation proceeds immediately?
 Mr. COHEN. We start with the proposition there can be no activi-
 ty carried out without a signed finding and, therefore, once the
 finding is signed, that starts the clock in which the 48 hours--
 Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Chairman, our understanding is our House bill
 in the form we have it now does not read that well and we might
 want to look at that question.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Hamilton.
 Mr. HAMILTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 In view of the time constraints, I will not ask any questions. I do
 want to thank Senator Cohen for his extraordinary leadership on
 this bill in the Senate and his willingness to testify. .,
 Senator Cohen, we are delighted to have you here. We admire
 and appreciate what you have done on this bill. I hope we can do
 as well in the House.
 Mr. COHEN. I hope you can as well.
 Mr. HAMILTON. Thank you.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. DeWine.
 PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THIS LAW
 Mr. DEWINE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Senator, I have a brief comment and I would like you to com-
 ment on that. It is clear from reading your testimony and listening
 to you today as well as looking at your statement in the Senate one
 of your main points is that this bill does not prohibit the President
 from doing anything.
 In fact, you state in here, let's be clear the bill does not prohibit
 the President from acting. I would like to maybe clarify that a
 little bit and start off by saying I think that is wrong.
 I think that on paper it does not prohibit the President from
 acting, but as a practical matter in the real world, that it will pro-
 hibit the President from acting. We can argue that it is good or we
 can argue that it is bad, but it seems to me to sharpen the debate
 we shouldn't delude ourselves and think that this, as a practical
 matter, will not stop the President from acting in certain cases.
 One of the things that has troubled some of us are the state-
 ments that have been made by Senators and Congressmen to the
 effect that, and I can think of one specific example where a Sena-
 tor said he felt he had a-while being informed of a proposed
 covert operation, if he disagreed with that operation, if he felt it
 was wrong, that he had a moral obligation to leak it and basically
 stop the operation.
 You can argue whether that is good or bad, but that seems to me
 if I am President of the United States that that is going to have in

 this legislation, which leaves no escape clause at all, which in
 effect have a chilling, if we can use the term, a chilling effect on
 future president's actions. And I know that one of the things that
 you have argued or seem to be arguing is that maybe that is a good
 idea, if the President would go and consult Congress, he would be
 better off and I think we can all think of examples, the Iran/
 Contra case is a prime example, as Mr. Hyde said if the President
 were to talk to Bob Michel or talk to you or talk to just about any-
 body up here it probably wouldn't have occurred.
 But I just want to sharpen the debate a little bit and argue about
 maybe what we should be arguing is that a good idea or is it not a
 good idea, is it constitutional or is it not constitutional? It just
 seems to me to say that this provision does not, will not in the
 future stop actions by the President just isn't right, isn't correct.
 Mr. COHEN. Let me address the issue in the real world or that of
 practicality. If what you say is correct, they will have the practical
 impact of prohibiting the President from acting, Ronald Reagan
 has been out of the practical world for the past eight years because
 he has, in fact, been notifying Congress of each and every covert
 action and he has had no difficulty in acting and executing and
 carrying it out without jeopardizing those operations.
 Number two--
 Mr. DEWINE. Excuse me, just a second, let me just say I am talk-
 ing about in a rare case, I am not talking about the usual every
 day case, I am talking about a case that may occur once in five
 years.
 Mr. COHEN. There have been a number of very rare cases, I
 think, that Congressman Hamilton, and perhaps Mr. Fascell agree,
 but there have been cases, for example, that are highly secretive,
 highly dangerous, involving a number of lives, many more lives
 than were involved in this particular case, in which the President
 has notified the intelligence leadership, the Chairman and Vice-
 Chairman and frankly I have expressed opposition to several of
 those particular operations, which nonetheless went forward.
 And so, what I am trying to emphasize is that we give him the
 benefit of our advice, and he is free either to accept or reject it. I
 can think of one or two cases in which the entire committee was
 notified and the entire committee concluded that it was a bad idea
 and they went back, rethought it and said, you are right. But,
 there have been those cases in which they have come to the leader-
 ship of the Senate Intelligence Committee and I have expressed op-
 position, they have taken into account, said, thank you very much,
 Senator Cohen, we disagree, we are going forward and they did.
 I think as a practical matter, the President has had no difficulty
 in carrying out covert actions. The difficulty he had in the Iran/
 Contra affair was not that he feared loss of lives as was put to us,
 but rather that it violated his own fundamental public policy.
 Let's suppose a future President were to determine that it was in
 our interest to transfer covertly SDI technology to the "moderates"
 that exist in the Soviet Union. And, the President felt that that
 would lead to such violent opposition if he notified even two or four
 Members of Congress he couldn't afford to take the risk until long
 after the technology had been transferred.

 I think I would have difficulty coming before this committee and
 finding many Members who would support the President's invoca-
 tion of inherent absolute authority not to notify the leadership of
 the Senate or the House because lives were involved and it was a
 dangerous mission.
 I would say, wait a minute, this is a fundamental foreign policy
 objective. You had an obligation to notify us, if not before, then
 surely within a very short time frame so we could have expressed-
 our concerns about a foreign policy objective that we feel very
 strongly about.
 RATIONALE BEHIND 48-HOUR NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT
 So, I think that in the world of practicality, the President has
 had no difficulty in functioning,. and.. this, bill; this requirement, of
 the notification would not have been necessary but for the. inter-
 pretation coming. out of the- Justice Department which says that
 timely notification. is whatever the: President says. I think that, is
 what has led to the 48 hours:
 If you were to say 36, 48; a. week your know-, that is not a, prob-
 lem. This was designed, because- this was, the testimony of Bob,
 Gates, that of Judge, Webster and' others. whofelt that was a rea-
 sonable time in, which if it' is not. practical to give advanced, notice,
 we can- get the notice in that time frame.
 Mr. DEWINE. It is an interesting' constitutional debate and I
 guess I was just-trying to frame it; and I do appreciate your com-
 ments, I wanted.. to frame -it a little bit, more narrowly because- I'
 think as a practical matter in rare cases it is going to change what
 the Presidents do,.. it. is going to stop Presidents from taking certain-
 actions, they will be inhibited: and we are not talking about the
 usual case; and I guess my problem is we don't know how rare it is
 going to be, or when it is going. to occur, or whether it. is going, to
 be when you and I are still here, or whether we are long gone at
 that point.,
 That is what worries me. Thank you, very much.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Weiss.
 Mr. WEISS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 I simply want to echo the sentiments by Mr. Hamilton about the
 role you have played, Senator, in trying to take constructive action
 to cure some of the ills of the entire Iran/Contra affair that were
 disclosed, and I would like to commend you on the role you played
 in the hearings themselves. Again, I welcome your clarification as
 to how you arrived at the 48 hours because there was some ques-
 tion as to whether in fact there was not any testimony by the
 people you mentioned. I think we clarified some of that at the
 hearing yesterday, but I think it is good to have it on the record`
 again.
 Thank you, very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Senator, thanks very much. We appreciate
 your taking the time and your continued interest in this very im-
 portant matter and we are delighted to have you come here and
 join us today in consideration of this bill, especially in pointing out
 the differences in the two bills and the other points you have made
 which we will very seriously consider.

 INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT ACT OF 1988
 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
 COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS,
 Washington, DC.
 The committee met at 9:30 a.m., in room 2172, Rayburn House
 Office Building, Hon. Dante B. Fascell (chairman) presiding.
 Chairman FASCELL. The committee will come to order please.
 We meet today to conclude the Committee's consideration of H.R.
 3822, a bill to revise and consolidate intelligence oversight by the
 Congress and to require that a limited group of eight congressional
 leaders be given prior notification, or if time is of the essence, no
 later than 48 hours after the covert action has been authorized, of
 all covert actions.
 We have received executive branch testimony over the last sever-
 al days from the CIA, State Department and from the Secretary of
 Defense, Frank Carlucci. We have also, received very compelling
 testimony from the distinguished statesman Clark Clifford and
 from our colleague in the other body, Senator Cohen who is the
 principal sponsor of the Intelligence Oversight Act in the Senate.
 Listening to that testimony which both opposed and supported H.R.
 3822, and having reflected on the many hours of testimony before
 the Select Committees to investigate the Iran-Contra affair, I would
 like to make the following observations: I agree with one the prin-
 cipal recommendations of the Iran-Contra report that, "While good
 judgment, honestly or fidelity to the law can not be legislated, some
 changes to the oversight of covert actions would make our processes
 function better in the future."
 The Committees therefore jointly recommended that section 501 of
 the National Security Act be amended to require that the Congress
 be notified in advance, but in certain cases no later than 48 hours
 after, the covert action has been authorized.
 That is what we are doing today. We are considering a modest
 but very appropriate adjustment to the current law. We must not
 disregard the lessons learned from the disastrous Iran-Contra
 affair. We must not overreact either.
 H.R. 3822 is a balanced approach to addressing these concerns. It
 does preserve presidential flexibility while recognizing the constitu-
 tional duties and prerogatives of the-Congress. H.R. 3822 is the es-
 sence of good government and of true oversight and congressional-
 executive consultation.
 After listening and studying all the arguments pro and con on
 this bill, I must conclude that H.R. 3822 should be adopted. It on
 balance will serve our collective interests well. It will ensure that
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 154
 the necessary and appropriate consultation between the Congress
 and the executive branch occurs at the time it is most useful-
 prior to the initiation of a sensitive covert action. The bill, by limit-
 ing certain sensitive notification to the group of eight congressional,
 leaders will provide appropriate limited access to these most sensi-
 tive secrets. It will ensure however that a balance between the
 need for secrecy and congressional consultation on a covert.. action
 which may have a profound. impact on U.S. foreign-..policy and na-
 tional security interests will be achieved.
 Finally, I would like to put in the record, without objection, a
 letter/memorandum, from the Department of Justice, signed by
 Thomas M. Boyd, Acting Assistant Attorney General,. giving the de-
 partment's views on this bill. They are strongly opposed to, the en-
 actment of the legislation because they believe it unconstitutional-
 ly intrudes on the President's authority to conduct the foreign rela-
 tions of the United States.
 Also, I would like to introduce in the record a letter from Mr.
 Don Edwards, chairman of the. Subcommittee on Civil and Consti-
 tutional Rights of the Committee on the Judiciary, who ? takes the,
 opposing view. Without objection, we. will put both of these letters
 in the record.'
 Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Hyde.
 Mr. HYDE. I understand this bill came to us on joint,. rather than
 sequential--
 Chairman FASCELL. It did, I am sorry.
 Mr. HYDE [continuing]. Referral, and, therefore,. when we get to
 Mr. Solomon's amendment, that ? it is on joint referral makes a dif-
 ference as to its propriety. But we can get to that in due, course.
 Chairman FASCELL. You are right, I was incorrect, it came to us
 on joint referral, not sequential. .
 Mr. HYDE. Also, Mr. Chairman, since we are putting things in
 the. record, I have two items I would like to ask unanimous consent
 to put in the record. One of them is a speech that I made before a
 section of the American Bar Association- having to do with leaks in
 congressional oversight, and the other is a.chapter from the Minor-
 ity Report in the Iran-Contra investigation, chapter-13, on the need
 to patch leaks, and I would like those to be a part of the record.2
 Chairman FASCELL.. Without objection, they will 'be included in
 the record.
 Mr. HYDE. Thank you.
 AMENDMENT IN THE NATURE OF A SUBSTITUTE AS MARKUP DOCUMENT
 Chairman FASCELL. Anybody else have any comment? Without
 objection, we will consider the amendment in the nature of a sub-
 stitute to H.R. 3822, as reported by the Permanent Select Commit-
 tee on Intelligence. The Chief of Staff will report the bill.

 Are there amendments? Mr. Broomfield has an amendment.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I have a short statement.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Broomfield--
 Mr. SOLARZ. Would you yield for a technical point?
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Yes.
 Mr. SOLARZ. Does your amendment- refer to the bill or the
 amendment in the nature of a substitute?
 Chairman FASCELL. The amendment is not' before us yet. There
 are no amendments before us yet.  '
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Not yet. It will be shortly.
 Chairman FASCELL. He hasn't offered it yet.
 Mr. SOLARZ. When he does, will it relate--
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I want to make sure that the
 substitute you have laid before the committee, a copy of which we
 received just yesterday afternoon, is the same as the bill reported
 by the Intelligence Committee. Unfortunately, there are numerous
 discrepancies--
 Chairman FASCELL. Excuse me, this came from the, committee.
 This is not a new substitute.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. The Minority didn't get the text of this substi-
 tute until yesterday.
 Chairman FASCELL. Everybody got it. But go ahead.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Anyway, there are numerous discrepancies be-
 tween the committee substitute and the bill reported by the Intelli-
 gence Committee. I have been informed the changes appear to be
 purely technical in nature. Nevertheless, I wish to point out the
 Minority staff has not had time to go through the bill in detail to
 assure that the meaning of various provisions has not been altered.
 Mr. Chairman, is it your understanding, this is what I want to
 know, that the. substitute text that you have introduced differs
 from the Intelligence Committee version only in technical ways?
 Chairman FASCELL. Yes. The gentleman is correct.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Thank you.
 Chairman FASCELL. And for the `purposes of the markup, we are
 going to use the amendment in the nature of a substitute.

 Chairman FASCELL.. Without objection, further reading of the
 amendment will be dispensed with, it will be printed in the record
 in full, and the gentleman from Michigan is recognized in support
 of his amendment.
 [The amendment follows:]
 AMENDMENT TO THE SUBSTITUTE FOR H.R. 3822 OFFERED BY MR. BROOMFIELD
 Page 7, lines 2-3, strike the words "the chairmen and ranking minority members
 of the intelligence committee," and delete the comma following the word "Repre-
 sentatives" on line 4.
 Page 7, lines 6-7, strike the words "in a case under. either paragraph (1) or (2), a
 copy of the finding, signed by the President," and insert in lieu thereof: "In a case
 under paragraph (1), a copy of the finding, as signed by the President,".
 Page 8, insert the following after line 2:
 "(C) The President may waive the requirements of subparagraph (B) if he deter-
 mines that it is necessary to meet rare, extraordinary circumstances constituting a
 serious threat to United States national security interests. In the event the Presi-
 dent exercises the waiver contained in this subparagraph, he shall state the grounds
 therefor in writing. Notification to Congress pursuant to this subsection shall in-
 clude, for any action for which a waiver was exercised under this subparagraph, a
 copy of the President's statement of grounds for exercising the waiver."
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman, as I stated on our hearings on
 this bill recently, I cannot support H.R. 3822 in its current form.
 mainly because the bill contains an absolute requirement the Presi-
 dent notify Congress of all covert activities within the 48 hours.
 It is my strong feeling that this provision would place an uncon-
 stitutional limit on the President's ability to execute foreign policy.
 I believe it also would impede.. U.S. intelligence operations and pre-
 vent full cooperation by foreign governments.
 Senior administration officials, such as Defense Secretary Car-
 lucci, Director of Central Intelligence, Bill Webster, and Under Sec-
 retary of State Armacost, have all assured me that if my amend-
 ment is adopted they would recommend the President sign the bill.
 I was also informed last night the White House .agrees the Presi-
 dent should sign the substitute, for H.R. 3822 if my amendment is
 adopted. It is my concern for the security and effectiveness of
 covert operations that lead me to offer this amendment.
 My amendment, I will explain again for the benefit of committee
 members and others, would do just three things. First the amend-
 ment would replace the limited notifiction procedures that the
 President can employ in extraordinary circumstances. Under the
 bill, as in current law, the President can choose to inform only the
 four leaders of Congress and the chairmen and ranking minority
 members of the Intelligence Committees. I believe that the require-
 ment for Presidential consultation with Congress on such matters
 could be met in a more secure and satisfactory manner if the Presi-
 dent only had to notify the four leaders: The Speaker and Minority
 leader of the House of Representatives, and the Majority and Mi-
 nority leaders of the Senate.
 DEFERRAL OF 48-HOUR NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT
 Second, the amendment would allow the President to defer noti-
 fication beyond 48 hours in rare, extraordinary circumstances con-

 I                                   157
 stituting a serious threat to United States national security inter-
 ests. This is a high standard that would. permit.the President some
 flexibility in withholding notification for a short period of time
 while a sensitive operation was underway. The administration has
 already adopted-and I want to point this out, and people ought to
 know it-the rare extraordinary circumstances standard in its na-
 tional security decision directive on covert action.
 Administration officials have also indicated that the administra-
 tion would be willing to go to an even higher standard as long as it
 permits the President some flexibility in special cases. Now, again,
 I want to point out that the Canadian hostage rescue caper, back in
 President Carter's time, was such a case. Other cases involving se-
 rious risk of loss of life would also qualify. There could be other
 types of cases that would require the President to exercise these
 powers.
 REMOVAL OF WRITTEN NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT
 And, third and finally, the amendment would remove the re-
 quirement that copies of Presidential findings be sent to Congress
 even if only limited notification is provided under the act. It
 doesn't make sense to require written notification in such a situa-
 tion, especially since numerous staff could easily gain access to
 such materials. The amendment would also substitute the language
 of the NSDD dealing with transmittal of a written finding. Con-
 gress would always be provided a copy of the finding as signed by
 the President.
 ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS BROOMFIELD AMENDMENT
 In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, let me say that I believe the ad-
 ministration has gone far in working with Congress to perfect this
 bill. This could be a good and useful bill if it were not for the 48-
 hour requirement. The administration has also worked to specify
 the extremely small number of cases in which notification to Con-
 gress might be deferred, and again I want to point out during our
 hearings it was said that there were probably no more than three
 such cases in the last 10 to 15 years, where such an operation
 would come under this qualification. This amendment would clari-
 fy the situation in which the President can exercise that power,
 and I strongly urge the committee to go along.
 We have a good bill here. A lot of work has gone into this bill.
 With this amendment we can get the administration's support, we
 can get bipartisan support and we can move this bill along and
 assure that it will be signed by the President.
 NEED TO CONSULT CONGRESS ON INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Hyde.
 Mr. HYDE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 I want to plead with my colleagues to listen, if they would, be-
 cause I think what I have to say is important, and this legislation
 that we are about to pass is perhaps the most important piece of
 legislation having to do with our national security that we will en-
 counter in many years.
 I Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7  158
 Let me preface my support for the Broomfield amendment by as-
 serting that I think this administration made a grave error in judg-
 ment in not notifying Congress of the Iran-Contra initiatives. I
 think it was absolutely wrong. I think the penalty they have and
 are sustaining for failure to notify Congress has been tremendous. I
 think the political fallout has yet to be measured. I don't think
 that the failure to notify Congress has at all passed with impunity,
 and I hope and pray a lesson has been learned by future Chief Ex-
 ecutives and future administration personnel that you cannot
 engage in a risky operation, a covert operation, without consulting
 with and taking into your inner circle Congress.
 Because if Congress opposes and rejects what you are doing, it
 cannot work, it can only serve to embarrass our country and even
 jeopardize lives. So I want to start out with that premise. We are
 talking about in this legislation changing the requirement that the
 President notify Congress, and when I say Congress I am speaking
 of the Intelligence Committees, the gang of eight or even a lesser
 number, depending on the exigencies of the situation.
 CALL FOR FLEXIBILITY ON 48-HOUR NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT
 The law says now "in a timely fashion." What we are trying to
 do is force that timely fashion into the narrow constraints of 48
 hours. Forty-eight hours. I am pleading with you not to do that, at
 the same time insisting the timely fashion standard was not met
 and that ten months is certainly not timely fashion, and I am will-
 ing to agree to a 48-hour notice on the normal covert activities. But
 I am asking for some wiggle room, some flexibility for the extraor-
 dinary situation that can involve the very national security of this
 country.
 And let me explain. The current issue of a publication put out by
 the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Arms Control Update,
 talks about the United States and biological war. That is the real
 unthinkable subject in this Congress and in this country. We
 defend ourselves against intercontinental ballistic missiles and
 cruise missiles and conventional warfare, but nobody wants to talk
 about biological and toxin weapons, and believe me they are out
 there, and they are a bigger threat than any nuclear bomb because
 you can get them into this country in a diplomatic pouch, and
 nobody will know about it.
 Let me quote from this publication, this most recent one, as re-
 gards Soviet compliance. The United States stated at the Review
 Conference that Soviet compliance with this legal obligation was
 subject to grave doubt. The legal obligation, my colleagues, is the
 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Our current report
 on Soviet noncompliance with arms control obligations takes note
 of continued activity at suspect biological and toxin weapons facili-
 ties in the Soviet Union and reports that a Soviet biological war-
 fare program may now include investigation of new classes of BW
 agents.
 It is clear that the Soviet Union has maintained an offensive bio-
 logical warfare program and capability in violation of its legal obli-
 gation under the 1972 convention.

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Now, we know that chemical warfare is being waged in the Iraq-
 Iran war by Iraqis. We know that other countries have developed
 the facilities for manufacturing some very serious and poisonous
 chemical weapons, and I am telling you in the real world you have
 to contemplate that.
 HYPOTHETICAL NATIONAL SECURITY EXIGENCY
 Now, I pose a hypothetical to you, and I hope it always stays a
 hypothetical. An observer to the United Nations who does not have
 the status as a legal entity or country but is given observer status
 finds that his group is in desperate straits so he gets biological war-
 fare culture, gets it in the country and has possession of this. What
 is going to happen if certain demands are not met? New York is
 going to feel this biological weapon and 6 million to 8 million
 people can be wiped out. It can happen. Believe me, it can happen.
 Now, through intelligence, we find. out about this, we know who
 has it, and we have an idea where it is. It is a desperate situation.
 Another Middle Eastern country has access to this person and
 has access to the inner sanctum of his chambers, and they offer to
 go get this stuff and to take this man out if necessary to prevent
 this disaster. But they tell us, don't you tell anybody because our
 people's lives are at stake, our country is at stake, lives are at
 stake, and we don't trust your Congress, we don't trust your CIA,
 we don't trust your White House, we have seen enough of Bob
 Woodward, we have seen enough every day in the papers quoting
 a congressional source," an .informed source," a "White House
 source" acknowledge this or acknowledge that.
 Now this happens. It happens regularly. It isn't only that some-
 body leaks or doesn't leak, it is the perception that other countries
 have that we can't keep a secret. And if this cooperating country's
 lives are going to be at stake,. don't you tell anybody.
 Now, they can go in and maybe get this and save 6 million lives,
 and if news of it leaks, a panic such as you can't imagine will occur
 in New York. Biological warfare. It will be like a horror movie
 with a cast of millions.
 Now, what is the President going to do? What is the President
 going to do if he has to tell Congress under the law? I am suggest-
 ing to you where hostages are taken, where terrorism exists and
 where life can be forfeited and our national security jeopardized,
 you have to give some flexibility to the next President.
 Now, you are not bashing Reagan when you pass this. He will be
 leaving office in a few months, and I dare say he will never have
 occasion to report in 48 hours. And if he does, he will. Because he
 has obliged himself to do so under a National Security Decision Di-
 rective. But I am telling you it isn't worth it to bash and to punish
 an administration retroactively for some mistake they made, seri-
 ous, egregious mistake they made, by tying a future President's
 hands in a situation that could really happen.
 CONSULTATION WITHIN EXECUTIVE BRANCH
 Mr. WEISS. Would the gentleman yield for a question or two?
 To whom is this question, this hypothetical, going to be given by
 the Middle Eastern person?

 Mr. HYDE. Vernon Walters goes to the President, then says, "Mr.
 President, we have this horrible situation."
 Mr. WEISS. Thank you, and whom will the United Nations repre-
 sentative speak to, the President himself?
 Mr. HYDE. Who will what?
 Mr. WEISS. Who will he speak to, the President?
 Mr. HYDE. I would say, yes.
 Mr. WEISS. How many other people will the President call in for
 discussion?
 Mr. HYDE. Probably the National Security Advisor, maybe the
 Secretary of State, maybe not, depending on what the instructions
 are from the third country that is going to risk its national surviv-
 al by cooperating with us.
 Mr. WEISS. So that at the very least, you will have a couple other
 people besides the President involved?.
 Mr. HYDE. Sure.
 Mr. WEISS. In the executive branch.
 Mr. HYDE. I ask unanimous consent I have three additional min-
 utes.
 Mr. WEISS. Thanks for yielding.
 Chairman FASCELL. Without objection, the gentleman is recog-
 nized for three additional minutes.
 FURTHER DETAILS ON HYPOTHETICAL
 Mr. SOLARZ. Thank you for yielding. This is one of the most in-
 teresting hypotheticals I have heard in 14 years on the committee.
 It wasn't clear exactly what action the President was being asked
 to take by this Middle East--
 Mr. HYDE. Supply intelligence, wire-tapping, electronic surveil-
 lance to find out the movements. I don't have to discuss that with
 you. Your imagination ought to be fertile enough to know what as-
 sistance we can give to what is going on in the U.N.
 Mr. SOLARZ. I thought you said the country that alerted us to the
 danger had the capacity to spirit the perpetrator out of the coun-
 try?
 Mr. HYDE. Maybe not that, Mr. Solarz. Maybe get rid of him, I
 don't know. But if he has got biological culture that can kill six
 million people, something must be done. I could give you an exact
 example of this with another country and another situation that
 we leaked. It happens. And I am saying you can't tie the President
 down that tightly where our national security is involved.
 48-HOUR REQUIREMENT TOO RESTRICTIVE
 Now, let me just give you one quote from Lloyd Cutler, a pretty
 smart man who is hardly an adjunct of the Reagan Administration,
 but Lloyd Cutler told us it does seem to him that ".  . none of us
 is bright enough to devise an absolute 48-hour rule that will cover
 all situations and to drive the President into the refuge of a consti-
 tutionally inherent right to do something which Congress can't
 interfere with. It seems to go a bit too far. You are forcing a consti-
 tutional confrontation which we should avoid at all cost."
 Now, Judge Webster is opposed to the 48 hours, he wants some
 wiggle room. He will buy this Broomfield amendment. Secretary

 Carlucci is against it, William Colby, Stansfield Turner, Zbigniew
 Brzezinski, Lloyd Cutler, Henry Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft, these
 are people whose careers have revolved around questions like this.
 They are not acting as Democrats or Republicans, they are experi-
 enced Americans, and I plead with you to adopt the Broomfield
 amendment, which gives that little room for the extraordinary sit-
 uation that can occur that will involve your country, my country
 and possibly the West.
 So that is what I am pleading with you to think about. I just
 think this legislation is an over-reaction to something that was
 wrong and has not gone unpunished.
 CANADIAN HOSTAGE SITUATION
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. The gentleman made a compelling case with
 his hypothetical, but what about the actual case that happened?
 Most of us are familiar with this. For the record, will you discuss
 the Canadian hostage situation. This actually happened.
 Mr. HYDE. We have six people escape from our Embassy and find
 themselves in the Canadian Embassy in Tehran in 1980, and the
 Canadians said "We will help you get them out of the country",
 while 52 of their colleagues were held by the Revolutionary Guards
 for 444 days.
 But the Canadians said, "Don't you tell anybody, don't you tell
 Congress", and we infiltrated CIA- agents with false passports,
 German passports, and they got the six out of the country, and
 then after they had left, Congress was told by Admiral Turner and
 President Carter, and everybody applauded. It was a very success-
 ful operation that would have been impossible if this law had been
 in effect. It involved at least six lives.
 Mr. BERMAN. Will the gentleman yield?
 It is fair to point out this whole episode occurred prior to the
 1980 amendments, prior to the creation of a group of eight.
 Mr. HYDE. But Mr. Berman, the Hughes-Ryan law was in effect,
 and that required timely notice of Congress.
 Mr. BERMAN. Of Congress. But the alternatives with the group of
 eight under rare and extraordinary circumstances were not in
 place at that time.
 Mr. HYDE. Admiral Turner said we were told not to tell anybody
 because Canada's Embassy and Canadians' lives were at stake. And
 so we have followed their instructions, and it succeeded and saved
 six lives, and thank God it did. Now three months was no big deal,
 and everybody said all right. What Turner says, Admiral Turner
 says, you measure not by the tick of the clock, but by the nature of
 the operation. That is his standard for notifying Congress. I would
 go further than that. I would think the Broomfield amendment
 confines itself to extraordinary circumstances where our national
 security-it doesn't even say lives. I would want his amendment to
 say lives are at stake. It says national security interests. We are
 talking about the future, not the past.
 Parenthetically, one of those phony passports was a German
 passport, the initial was H. in the middle, and they stopped our
 agent at the airport because German passports never use middle
 initials, and they said, "Why is the "H" there?" It is one of our

 agents. He thought faster than anybody in recorded history, he
 said, "I am ashamed, I was born in 1935, my middle name is Hitler,
 and I don't want them to spell that out on the passport", and the
 guy bought it.
 You don't want to stifle that kind of creativity, do you?
 HOSTAGE SITUATION NOT NECESSARILY NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE
 Mr. SMITH of Florida. Certainly the gentleman is presenting a
 number of rather Plato-like theses because he is arguing only those
 sides he wishes to argue.
 My question is even assuming, arguing everything you say has
 significant merit, does that warrant the United States changing
 the way it is to do business internally? Does another country theo-
 retically have the right to create a situation where we suspend
 what we would otherwise honor as a tradition in this country of
 information, even at that level being shared with the leaders of the
 Branches, is that-some country is to make a policy different from
 the norm in this country?
 I might add the gentleman has set up a scenario that doesn't ex-
 actly fit the national security waiver in this bill because, quite hon-
 estly, the hostage situation may not be a national security situa-
 tion.
 Mr. HYDE. I agree with you. If you want to talk about hostages, I
 think the Broomfield amendment would have to be stretched to its
 broadest implication to include the saving of human lives, and that
 is why I think it needs to be improved. But I am willing to accept it
 because the administration will accept it, and they will sign this
 bill.
 I am suggesting you play it as it lays, you take the problem as it
 comes to you and you make a judgment. And if our national securi-
 ty interests are involved, you had better think about it.
 CANADIAN REACTION TO UNITED STATES LEAKS OF CLASSIFIED
 INFORMATION
 Mr. BEREUTER. Will the gentleman yield?
 I thank the gentleman for yielding. We have heard the argument
 about the Canadians trying to dictate what our national policy
 should be. What it seems to me the Canadians were doing was re-
 acting to a reality, pointing out a reality to us. That reality is that
 we have intentional leaking and accidental leaking through care-
 less use of classified information going on in this government-in
 the executive and legislative branches.
 What we are attempting to do is to find a way to limit the kind
 of consultation that goes on here as one means of dealing with the
 problem which the Canadians obviously recognize. I think what
 needs to be put on the record at this point is that the argument
 about someone dictating to us what is proper for us to do in our
 own governmental system is not really a relevant argument.
 I thank the gentleman for yielding.
 Chairman FASCELL. The gentleman's time has expired.

 FINITE SITUATION VS. ONGOING ACTIVITY
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. I ask unanimous consent the gentleman from Il-
 linois have three additional minutes.
 If I could ask the gentleman from Illinois a question. The scenar-
 io which you outlined is a finite situation, it has a beginning and
 end. Once this individual is spirited out of the country and once
 this material is neutralized or obtained, the incident comes to an
 end.
 Mr. HYDE. Right.
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. What if the incident were not a finite incident,
 what if it were an ongoing activity in which our security intelli-
 gence, or the intelligence needed to be provided to this hopeful
 Middle Eastern country for a period of two to three years. At what
 point then would the President be required to finally notify the
 Congress?
 Mr. HYDE. I don't think you can quantify it. I think the Presi-
 dent could follow the strictures of the Broomfield amendment, talk
 about the existence of something and every ten days look at the
 finding that is in the safe to make sure it doesn't get lost in the
 shuffle. But if it takes three years to get in there and get that cul-
 ture, and you got somebody willing to risk his, her or their lives to
 do it and they set out those terms, I would, if I were the President,
 I would adhere to those terms.
 POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE BALANCED AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. But doesn't this really allow the President to
 provide an excuse to simply never inform the Congress by allowing
 him to characterize this in the way in which the Broomfield
 amendment does characterize it, as an extraordinary and rare cir-
 cumstance?
 Mr. HYDE. Yes. As Secretary Shultz said, trust is the coin of the
 realm. It can be abused. It certainly can.
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. And as the gentleman pointed out, it has been
 and--
 Mr. HYDE. Mr. Kostmayer, balance against that the notion that
 some Members of Congress have that if they don't agree with the
 policy they have a duty to disclose it. Now that is on the record.
 Some prominent Senators have said that, and a prominent Member
 of this House once said it and did it, and you have to balance the
 possibility of abuse by a President, but also the subsequent political
 fallout that he will get, as President Reagan is getting now, against
 the destruction of the operation and the horrible consequences.
 BROOMFIELD AMENDMENT GUTS 48-HOUR RULE
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. If I could continue. I think it is possible to make
 a case for rare and extraordinary circumstances here and to create
 an exception to the 48-hour rule. But I don't think the Broomfield
 amendment does that. I think that the Broomfield amendment es-
 sentially guts the 48-hour rule and despite the fact the gentleman
 from Illinois has made, as he always does, a compelling and elo-
 quent case, I think this essentially is a gutting amendment and
 fails to create an exception for which I think a valid case could
 under certain circumstances be made.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me.
 Mr. HYDE. Just let me say "to meet rare extraordinary circum-
 stances constituting a serious threat to the United States' national
 security interests," I think that is pretty tight language.
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. If the Broomfield amendment is adopted under
 this administration, the law and the conduct of the administration
 would not change. This administration would not regard the adop-
 tion of this amendment as any change in current law, and their at-
 titude and their behavior and their conduct would remain precisely
 the same as it has always been.
 That is why they are for it, that is why they support it, that is
 why they want it. It opens up a loophole you can drive a Mack
 truck through.
 Mr. HYDE. One sentence, this administration will pay the politi-
 cal price for that error in judgment. That is why we have elections.
 Thank you for giving me all this time.
 BILL REDRESSES DEFICIENCIES IN PRESENT LAW
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Hamilton.
 Mr. HAMILTON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
 Of course, I oppose the amendment. I want to say at the outset
 that I am impressed with the sincerity and the concern that our
 friends on the opposite side have displayed in their opposition to
 this bill. I think I understand that and appreciate it, although I do
 not agree with it.
 But I recognize they argue from a point of some conviction, even
 passion, with respect to this problem. I hope they will acknowledge
 that from our side, we present this as a modest proposal to clarify
 what we think are ambiguities in the Intelligence Oversight Act
 and to encourage the administration, or to require the administra-
 tion, to present a finding and to give notice whenever you engage
 in covert actions. We do not seek to punish the President of the
 United States. We simply believe there is a major deficiency in
 present law which was revealed in the Iran-Contra hearings and
 that this bill is a modest attempt to correct it.
 OBJECTIONS NOT BASED ON CONCERN OVER LEAKS
 Now, what are the arguments that are made against the bill?
 The first one is the problem of leaks or disclosures. It is interesting
 to me to note that the Executive Branch witnesses did not make
 that argument. Secretary Carlucci specifically said that he was not
 making a plea for this bill on the basis that the Congress might
 leak. Director Webster spelled out his objections to this bill, they
 did not include the possibility that the Congress would leak. Under
 Secretary Armacost spelled out his objections to the bill, they did
 not include, so far as I could remember, that the Congress of the
 United States would leak.
 Mr. LEACH. Would the gentleman yield on that point, because it
 is a profound point.
 Mr. HAMILTON. I yield.
 Mr. LEACH. The testimony was that the Congress was in responsi-
 bility equal to the executive branch, neither worse nor better.
 Leaks do occur in this society.

 165
 Secondly, the evidence is that in terms of verbal expressions
 there might be less trouble, but we are talking about a paper flow
 of which far more than simply a few Members of Congress would
 be advised.
 Mr. HAMILTON. May I suggest to the gentleman, if he looks at
 the stated objections by the administration to the bill, I think, he
 will find they did not include there the problem of leaks.
 Now, I want to say with respect to the problem of leaks that I
 don't dismiss it casually. We in the Congress have an important re-
 sponsibility not to disclose information. It is, it seems to me, an ex-
 traordinary thing to say that we in this institution are not going to
 trust our most respected leaders.
 When you have the gang of eight and the gang of four, you are
 not talking about 535 Members of the United States Congress. You
 are talking about the people we put in charge of the Intelligence
 Committees to handle the most trusted secrets of government, and
 you are talking about the senior Members of the Congress, our
 most distinguished Members who have been elected by their peers.
 And when you are saying these people are going to leak, it is an
 extraordinary statement of untrustworthiness in the leadership of
 the Congress.
 If the bill provided that..welare going to notify the Congress of
 the United States or;.=the- President must notify the Congress, I
 would agree with the statements that have been made. That would
 be far too many people, but the bill doesn't provide that. That is
 the first question on leaks.
 BILL DOES NOT LIMIT PRESIDENT'S FLEXIBILITY
 Now, I think the. more serious second objection relates to the
 flexibility on the President, and our friends who oppose this bill
 are genuinely concerned about restrictions on the flexibility of the
 President. But I ask my colleagues this question: Where is the re-
 striction on the President's flexibility? This bill does not limit what
 covert actions the President may take. It does not tell him how a
 covert action must be taken. It does not tell him the timing of the
 covert action.
 The only thing that it does is to say that if he takes the covert
 action, and he may do it on his own initiative without the approval
 of the Congress, and we are not objecting to it, we are simply
 saying if he does it, then he must give notice to the Congress. And
 I do not see, frankly, that notice as requiring anything more than a
 reasonable and restrained approach to the abuse of the covert
 action process that we are all familiar with.
 And I must say I have a difficult time understanding the argu-
 ment that you are restraining the flexibility of the President. We
 are not doing that at all. We are merely saying when he acts, if he
 acts, how he acts, then he has got to tell us that he has done so.
 CONGRESS CAN PROVIDE INDEPENDENT ADVICE ON COVERT ACTION
 Now, what it all comes down to for me is a question of balance.
 On the one hand, you have to weigh the risks that our friends have
 stated, the risk of disclosure, the risk of restraint on flexibility to
 the degree that we think there is such a restraint exists on the one
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 166
 hand. You have to weigh that risk against the value and the bene-
 fit of giving the President independent advice about the covert
 action.
 What happens in the bureaucracy, it seems to me, in covert ac-
 tions-and I am not critical of this-is that a bureaucracy tilts in
 favor of what the President wants to do. Not all of the good politi-
 cians in this town are in Congress. They are in the executive
 branch. They understand what direction the President is going to
 go, and they, therefore, marshal their arguments in support of
 that. There is nothing wrong about that. The President is the
 leader, the elected leader, and the bureaucracy ought to support
 him.
 But what is lacking in that process so often is a voice that will
 come up to the President of the United States and say, "Mr. Presi-
 dent, what you are trying to to is plain wrong, it is not going to
 work, and we think you need to reassess it." It can be raised much
 more effectively by Members of the Congress who have an inde-
 pendent political base, who are not beholding to the President of
 the United States, and who can give him an independent assess-
 ment of covert actions.
 So in this balance, the value of that independent advice on these
 terribly important covert actions outweighs whatever risk you may
 have with respect to leaks or with respect to a restriction on disclo-
 sure. That is why I support the bill.
 WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION UNDERMINES LEGISLATIVE-EXECUTIVE
 EQUALITY
 The final point I make simply relates to the constitutionality ar-
 gument. The executive branch position with respect to the Consti-
 tution, is-if I understand it correctly-that a President of the
 United States has the power to withhold information from the Con-
 gress under extraordinary circumstances, and those extraordinary
 circumstances are not spelled out in any great detail.
 Now, I want Members of Congress to think about that. If you
 grant the power to the President to withhold information from the
 Congress, then it seems to me that the whole oversight process is
 irreparably damaged and that you cannot argue at that point that
 you have co-equal branches of government.
 We all know that information in this town is power, and if one
 side has the information and the other side doesn't have the infor-
 mation, the side that has got the information has the power.
 I don't think Members of Congress accept the argument that is
 made with respect to the Constitution. This is one of these great
 constitutional questions that has not been litigated so far as I
 know. Maybe it is better that it never be litigated, because of the
 implications it has for the constitutional system.
 But in this context it seems to me it is important for Members of
 Congress to acknowledge that if we are going to be a co-equal
 branch of government, if we are going to have full oversight re-
 sponsibility, if we are going to be able to give independent advice
 on these terribly important questions of covert actions, then we
 have to have the same kind of information that the President of
 the United States has and we cannot accept a position by the Presi-

 dent that "I can hold the information, I can hold it as long as I
 want to and not advise you of what that information is."
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Lagomarsino?
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. HYDE. Will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Yes.
 GENERAL GRANT OF POWER OF EXECUTIVE VS. SPECIFIC GRANTS TO
 CONGRESS
 Mr. HYDE. I would like to say to Mr. Hamilton, we are not giving
 the President the right to withhold the information. That is implic-
 it in the Executive power which the Constitution grants him, and
 that is a general grant of the power of the Executive. The powers
 that Congress receives in the Constitution are to be strictly con-
 strued because they are specific grants, and the Constitution says
 in support of this specificity, those powers "herein granted". So
 that is my response to you.
 TRUSTWORTHINESS OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
 Secondly, you talk about how trustworthy Congress is. I think in
 general congressman are trustworthy, as are most human beings.
 However, the former Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Commit-
 tee was recently criticized in some way or other by the Senate
 Ethics Committee for revealing something to a fundraising group
 in Florida that he shouldn't have. The former Vice Chairman of
 the Senate Intelligence Committee voluntarily left because he dis-
 closed something that they had voted not to disclose. We have had
 a Member of the House Intelligence Committee leave because of
 certain disclosures. So I am just not all that sanguine about secrets
 not getting out.
 But I would remind Mr. Hamilton, as co-Chairman of the Iran-
 Contra Investigation Commission, ?that you and Senator Inouye cer-
 tainly took precautions that Admiral Poindexter's testimony, vis-a-
 vis "the smoking gun," didn't get out because you didn't permit
 any Members to attend his deposition just the attorneys and staff,
 no members-because you didn't want that to leak out and of
 course blow the whole purpose of the investigation.
 LIST OF LEAKS FROM IRAN-CONTRA COMMITTEE
 Let me supply you with a redacted, sanitized, benign list of seri-
 ous leaks out of that committee, which the cream of Congress,
 myself excepted, participated in.

 Mr. KOSTMAYER. Would the gentleman yield?

 Astrow the details of secret testimony of Assistant Attorney Gener-
 al William F. Weld," source, Philadelphia Inquirer, January 23,
 1987-I have pages of this.
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. Will the gentleman yield to me for one second?
 Chairman FASCELL. Gentlemen, I have been very lenient. We will
 abide by the five-minute rule for recognition. The time belongs to
 Mr. Lagomarsino and his time is up.
 Mr. Kostmayer.
 The gentleman is recognized for five minutes.
 DEFINING NATIONAL SECURITY SIGNIFICANCE OF LEAKS
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. I think I can say in 30 seconds that the gentle-
 man from Illinois has not provided one single, solitary example of a
 case in which a Member of the House or Senate leaked information
 which jeopardized our national security.
 He has provided example after example of information which
 was leaked which jeopardizes the political security of this adminis-
 tration. And that is the distinction.
 What they don't want is for the political security of this or any
 other administration to be jeopardized. What this would do is to
 protect the administration or any administration from having that
 occur.
 These are not examples--
 Mr. HYDE. Would my friend yield to me?
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. Just a second.
 These are not examples of national security leaks. These are ex-
 amples of political leaks, and none of these members of either the
 Intelligence Committee in the House or Senate has been accused,
 to my knowledge, of jeopardizing the security of this country. They
 have, rather, been accused, perhaps justly, of jeopardizing the polit-
 ical security of this particular Administration.
 I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.
 Mr. HYDE. Thank you.
 I have a book of leaks, classified leaks. The difficulty is in eluci-
 dating them here in open session, you confirm the accuracy of
 these operations. So I am at a considerable disadvantage. Mr. Tom

 Chairman FASCELL. The time belongs to you, Mr. Kostmayer.
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. I want to just insist again that the gentleman
 from Illinois can interpret these leaks any way he wants. No
 Member of Congress stands accused of jeopardizing the national se-
 curity of the United States.
 Mr. LEACH. Will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. I will not.
 These are political facts, political leaks, not national security
 leaks.
 Now I yield to the gentleman from Iowa.
 Mr. LEACH. Thank you.
 I think the gentleman from Pennsylvania absolutely defined the
 point that the gentleman from Illinois made earlier. He said in his
 judgment we have political leaks. But we have a system in this
 country that defines classifications. We have a congressional
 system that honors the classification system and, when a Member
 of Congress in their own judgment says this is political, that
 member is saying he can do what he wants despite the law of the
 United States of America that applies to Members of Congress as
 well as to the Executive Branch.
 The point the gentleman from Illinois made earlier is absolutely
 profound in that, regard:
 Now, secondly, let me say that the one series of leaks that I
 think every Democrat in this committee ought to be very con-
 cerned about is that the paper trail that was leaked was presum-
 ably to the benefit of one of the presidential candidates on the Re-
 publican side, and all I can say is this bill in its current form in-
 cludes the requirement that signed documents by a President of
 the United States go to the Senate among other places, a place
 where a lot of people are running for President of the United
 States.
 We already have a record by which, for the benefit of candidates,
 certain papers were leaked. That is one of the lessons of the Iran-
 Contra affair. When you have Mr. Dukakis in the presidency and
 you have a record- by which it appears that conservatives leaked as
 well as liberals, I think you should be very alarmed.
 But the most important point is the point you made that people
 making their own judgment on what is a political leak of classified
 information is something that is disallowed under the law of the
 United States. It is something for which there have been numerous
 examples, some of which the gentlemen have cited that have oc-
 curred, and it isn't good enough to say that this Congress has been
 pristinely pure in that issue.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Burton, you are recognized for five min-
 utes.
 Mr. BURTON. I will just take a moment, Mr. Chairman.

 I share the sentiments of my colleague, Mr. Leach, from Iowa,
 and I think he makes a very salient point.
 I would like to point out, before the Iran-Contra hearings took
 place this committee held a secret, closed-door series of meetings
 with Mr. McFarlane, Mr. Poindexter-although he took the 5th
 Amendment, as I recall-Mr. Casey, I think Mr. Shultz even ap-
 peared, and during one of those meetings I asked the Chairman to
 restate the position that he had cited earlier in a meeting, and that
 was that nothing in the meeting should be divulged to the media,
 nothing.
 At that meeting that Mr. Casey participated in, we had top
 secret information before us that was numbered. At the conclusion
 of our meeting, we had to turn that information back in or it had
 to be kept here in a safe in the Foreign Affairs Committee offices.
 I brought up a second time that I wished the Chairman would
 restate that nobody in this committee go out in the hall and tell
 the media. The Chairman restated it a second time and at the con-
 clusion of the meeting I brought it up a third time and the gentle-
 man from Florida stood up and said, "I resent him impugning the
 integrity of this committee," and I said I wasn't impugning the in-
 tegrity, I thought it should be clear to every member of this com-
 mittee that we don't go out in the hall and leak information that
 was classified.
 The meeting concluded and I walked out in that hall and three
 members of this committee, three members of this committee were
 standing before the cameras divulging information that they had
 been admonished three times not to reveal.
 I won't yield at this moment.
 And I think that that one example should be enough to defeat
 this measure. I think there is just no question that leaks do occur,
 and very important national security information should be kept to
 an absolute minimum as respects the numbers of Members of Con-
 gress.
 To expand it I think would be detrimental to our national inter-
 est and I think it is something that should be defeated in this com-
 mittee and shouldn't get to the Floor.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Gejdenson.
 BILL RESTRICTS NOTIFICATION TO CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP
 Mr. GEJDENSON. I think that what this argument does is ignore
 what Mr. Hamilton pointed out to begin with. The bill does not
 provide additional information to all 535 Members in the House
 and Senate, but to the leadership of the House, which includes the
 chairpeople of the Intelligence Committee. If you look at the histo-
 ry of this and previous administrations, concerning leaks, I can
 guarantee you there have been more leaks out of the executive
 branch than out of the people listed in this bill.
 Mr. BURTON. If I might reclaim my time.
 Mr. GEJDENSON. I think it is my time at this point.
 Chairman FASCELL. I recognized Mr. Gejdenson for five minutes,
 Mr. Burton. I thought you were finished.

 Mr. GEJDENSON. And so the simple point is, does this body want
 its leadership to function in the dark or should we have the basic
 information available to the leadership of the Congress?
 I think that it is critical to include the heads of the Intelligence
 Committees because, as good as the Majority Leader and the
 Speaker are it is the Chairmen of the Intelligence Committees that
 have day-to-day information and maintain an ongoing, continuous
 effort in the intelligence field.
 I think it is ludicrous to assume that we ought to keep those key
 people in the dark.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Solomon is recognized for five minutes.
 PENALTIES FOR UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE
 Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Chairman, let me just be brief.
 Mr. Leach, in responding to Mr. Kostmayer, hit the nail on the
 head. There are those of us in this country who think we can do
 anything we want to, politically. And Mr. Gejdenson brought out
 the fact that more leaks come out of the administration than out of
 Congress. I don't give a damn where the leaks are coming from,
 leakers ought to be penalized and go to jail for it.
 I have an amendment that is coming up later on during this
 committee meeting which says, "Any person having received access
 to classified information prepared pursuant to the provisions of
 this title who knowingly and willingly discloses the substance of
 that information without the authorization of the President, or
 pursuant to the applicable Rules of the House of Congress of which
 that person is a Member, officer or employee, shall be fined not
 less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000 or imprisoned for not less
 than 90 days nor more than five years, or both." And that is the
 way it should be.
 If it is classified information that is leaked, there ought to be a
 penalty, and this amendment that I will be offering will clarify and
 set forth these penalties.
 VETERANS ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSE BILL
 Now, let me say that Henry Hyde has talked at length on the
 kinds of leaks that take place. I just want you to know, as the
 ranking Republican on the Veterans Affairs Committee, that all of
 the veterans' organizations throughout this country have recently
 met, late last week, to be briefed on just what would happen if this
 legislation becomes law.
 I won't take the time to read this resolution, which is typical of
 all of those veterans' organizations, but I assure you that every one
 of you are going to be contacted before this bill reaches the floor, to
 let you know that the American people don't want this bill.
 I would submit this for the record. It is a resolution by the Re-
 serve Officers Association of the United States.3
 PERCEPTION OF CONGRESS AS SOURCE OF LEAKS
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

 The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Hyde, pointed out that mem-
 bers of the group that would be notified have leaked. And whether
 the administration or the Congress is more guilty of leaking is a
 debatable point; we could go on debating that.
 But the perception is, with other countries and certainly Canada
 in the case of the hostages in our embassy there, that the Congress
 does leak, and the President wasn't supposed to tell anybody. That
 is a fact of life. Maybe we don't like it, but that is a fact. That per-
 ception is reality in the minds of those people.
 So I think it is a very important point and we do have to allow
 some leeway-very limited, as it is in the Broomfield amendment-
 to the President.
 HOSTAGE-TAKING AS NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE
 Mr. SOLOMON. Somebody mentioned over there that hostage-
 taking is not a national security issue.
 Well, let me tell you one thing. You know, if 1 hostage is taken,
 fine; 2, 3, 4, 5, 10. What happens if thousands of American citizens
 are being taken hostage across this world? You don't think that
 will affect the national security? You don't think that will affect
 the judgment of how you people vote on legislation?
 Let me tell you, that is blackmail and it affects the national se-
 curity of this country. We.ought to defeat this legislation.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Smith?
 MAKING DETERMINATION ON CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I was intrigued by Mr. Kostmayer's
 discussion on the difference between political information and clas-
 sified information and as to who makes the determination.
 I was wondering if the gentleman would answer a question. Who
 does make that determination? Does he reserve unto himself the
 right to determine that? Mr. Leach's comments just a few minutes
 ago raised similar questions concerning the propriety of blabbing
 confidential information to the press.
 Secondly, has the gentleman ever leaked classified information
 himself?
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. I have never leaked classified information and,
 under current law, the Espionage Act covers Members of Congress
 and of the Executive Branch and everybody in this country. It is
 perfectly adequate law which we have now which prevents this
 kind of thing.
 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. The gentleman is saying that he has
 never leaked information that has been regarded as classified infor-
 mation from this--
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. I certainly never leaked national security infor-
 mation.
 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Who is making the determination?
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. The Solomon amendment-if I could respond,
 the Solomon amendment, which we have not gotten to, would
 make that judgment the administration's judgment entirely, and
 allows them to remove any notification from the debate by simply
 classifying it. That is the danger.

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. But you feel that you can make that
 determination also.
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. You don't believe that a Member of the United
 States Congress can make a judgment about what kind of informa-
 tion would jeopardize the security of the country?
 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. You then feel you have an ability to
 leak it; is that what you are saying?
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. It is inconceivable to me that the gentleman
 from New Jersey could believe that we are so bad here that we
 would, number one, not know what information would jeopardize
 the security of our country, and, number two, knowing it, leak it.
 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. The gentleman I think is very aware
 that Members of the House, the 535 Members, are not privy to the
 kind of information that the Intelligence Committee would be, and
 could very well leak information inadvertently, information that
 they thought was not going to jeopardize the national security.
 From the standpoint of a nation hostile to U.S. interests, the ques-
 tion of a Member's intent is entirely superfluous.
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. Name the one time it has happened. Mr. Hyde
 didn't name a single incident in which the national security of the
 United States was jeopardized by a Member of Congress.
 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Surely the gentleman was listening
 earlier in the debate when Mr. Hyde walked us through a large
 number of specific instances. I think privately he and other Mem-
 bers would gladly share additional examples with you.
 I would point out to my colleague that when Mr. McFarlane ap-
 peared before this committee, I asked our distinguished Chairman
 Mr. Fascell, what happens if there is a breach of confidentiality by
 members or staff of this committee? I asked, "what happens when
 tomorrow we read almost verbatim what occurred in Executive
 Session-secret session-what kind of mechanism and procedure
 will be triggered to ascertain who leaked the information?" The
 Chairman noted that he wasn't going to put everybody under oath
 and no investigation whatsoever would ensue.
 I would emphasize the point that the evidence clearly suggests
 that secrets, whether you classify them under your own subjective,
 highly questionable standard, Mr. Kostmayer, as political or of in-
 terest to national security, secrets have been leaked and trust has
 been broken.
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. Can the gentleman tell me of an incident where
 a Member has been charged or prosecuted?
 DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR MEMBERS OF INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. If the gentleman wants to know if
 there are incidents whereby members have compromised or leaked
 secret information, the answer is clearly yes. Earlier Mr. Hyde
 cited some examples here in open session of our Committee but said
 to comment extensively would in fact confirm the validity of some
 of the secrets that have been leaked. I trust that if the gentleman
 seeks several specific examples he can obtain that information, on
 a confidential basis, from the Chairman of the House Intelligence
 Committee, Mr. Stokes.

 Moreover, there are two recent examples of Senators who were
 caught red-handed leaking secret information. Mr. Durenberger,
 former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been
 criticized by  the  Senate  Select  Committee on  Ethics for
 "appear[ing]. that [he was]: disclosing sensitive national security in-
 formation and such- appearance jeopardized the mutual, confidence
 which must exist between the Congress and the intelligence com-
 munity."
 The other Senator I have-in mind- is Senator Patrick Leahy. He
 disclosed: without authorization- a committee document following a?
 vote by the Iran-Contra, panel not to. release: the report. His- breach
 of trust and confidentiality resulted in his resigning= from, the com-
 mittee.
 Mr: KOSTMAYER.. If-you- read- the- record-, in- the case of the Senate;
 they are not charged with leaking national- security information:
 And I happen. to: think.. that. Mr. Leahy; although- a- member of my
 own party, acted -inappropriately by leaking information.
 Once you, get on the Intelligence Committee, you, don!'t do that.
 But it wasn't national: security information,- it was politically em-
 barrassing, information:
 Mr. SMrrx of New Jersey. Would, the gentleman yield?
 Chairman FASCELL. His time has expired.
 Mr. BURTON. Will the gentleman yield?
 When the bombing of the Gulf of Sidra in Libya. took place, Sam
 Donaldson reported'when: the planes-were. in the air that there was-
 a. bombing --mission that was- in operation at that time. Two.- hours-
 before the planes got there, he was talking on the White House
 lawn- and one of the members of the Senate= Intelligence Commit-
 tee-I don't remember. who it was, but I believe it was Senator
 Pell-was taken to task for that.
 The gentleman from Pennsylvania keeps asking for an example
 of where national security was jeopardized, and I submit to you
 that what could be more. of an example than the bombing of Libya.
 when Muammar Qaddafi said we couldn't cross the line of death in
 the Gulf of Sidra. That took place. He is not answering right now,
 but I wish he would.
 Chairman FASCELL. The gentleman's time has expired.
 Mr. Bereuter?
 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SUBJECT TO CLASSIFICATION LAWS
 Mr. BEREUTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 In part we have a problem of definition of "national security." I
 look back at my own involvement as an army counterintelligence
 officer responsible for security matters and the .guarding of classi-
 fied information, and I am appalled at what I have seen in the
 Congress in the 10 years that I have been here.
 If we had seen that situation in the military units, we would
 have issued court martials and people would have ended up in
 Leavenworth.
 There are three general categories of classified information. All
 of those categories are based upon some degree of jeopardy to the
 national security-confidential, secret and top secret-and elabora-
 tions on those three basic categories. When Members here are ap-

 prised about the fact that they are going to receive a classified
 briefing, they are often given in fact the level of classification. But
 it is not up to a Member of Congress to decide that this informa-
 tion is a political matter and not deserving of the classification.
 Those are national security classifications. That is how the law
 works. Members of Congress are subject to them as well.
 The gentleman from California and the gentleman from Illinois
 have both pointed out how leadership, key leadership, has been
 found to be jeopardizing the national security. And it is only be-
 cause of the ways of the Senate, the methods of the Senate, that in
 fact charges are not brought against the Members. They are simply
 given an opportunity to exit.
 SYSTEM LIMITS PRESIDENTIAL FLEXIBILITY
 I think we need to look also at what the gentleman from Indiana
 offers in his arguments. He makes as good a case as can be made,
 but in fact the disclosures have come there. In fact, there is a limit
 on Presidential flexibility. It is not specific by narrowing in the
 language of the bill the limits on the flexibility of the President.
 The limitation comes from the fact that the opportunities for
 covert action are narrowed by the probability, or at least the possi-
 bility, of disclosure. The range of actions that the President has
 available to him are limited by the kind of system that we have
 established.
 BROOMFIELD AMENDMENT STRIKES PROPER BALANCE
 Now, I think, despite the fact that we have had egregious prob-
 lems with lack of notification to Congress by this administration
 and those bad situations tend to lead us toward bad law, the situa-
 tion in the Broomfield amendment is very tightly defined and nar-
 rowly construed. I think it contains the proper balance between
 protecting the national security and truly exceptional cases and
 dealing with the problem that we have on inappropriate disclosure,
 because Members feel it is on their shoulders in certain cases to
 decide what is political information and what is classified informa-
 tion.
 Gentlemen and ladies of the committee, we do not have that
 option. That is a problem here. The fact that we don't recognize it
 only leads us to the conclusion that we have to make, that a
 change is needed.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Torricelli.
 BALANCING RISKS OF LEAKS VS. FAILED COVERT ACTIVITIES
 Mr. TORRICELLI. I do not want to keep my colleagues long, but
 wanted to add a few thoughts. It appears to me that the committee
 is seeking a policy without any risk, in a procedure that has no
 danger, no danger of leaks, no problems of actions by the executive
 that are not, indeed, in the national interest.
 I want to submit that those risks, a policy of no risk, simply
 cannot be achieved. No matter what the record, the possibility re-
 mains of a revealing of information by Members of Congress who
 are consulted. And if there is no notification, the continuing real
 prospect of policy initiatives that are at variance with the national
 interest.

 The Broomfield amendment, it appears to me, the practical effect
 of it is to opt for the second danger. To recognize that there are
 twin problems. But that we would rather encounter the second
 problem of initiatives being taken by the executive that are not in
 our international interest and not identified by the Congress.
 I believe that more than anything else, that amendment con-
 cludes that we have learned nothing from the Iran/Contra affair.
 Because contrary to what Mr. Hyde suggested, the real price of the
 Iran/Contra affair is not going to be borne by Ronald Reagan. It is
 not that the administration, this or others, have to answer for
 things that they do that are not in our national interests in a polit-
 ical price. That price is paid by the country. Continuously. And will
 be year after year.
 As you look at the history of covert activities and the failure of
 the Congress to be informed, the expertise, the knowledge and ex-
 perience of the Members of these institutions to come to bear on
 national policies, I believe you can see the policy procedures have
 been in error. The fact is that a U-2 policy by the Eisenhower Ad-
 ministration which had to come to this Congress for advice, to look
 at the consequences of failure, would have been difficult.
 The Kennedy Administration, undertaking covert activities
 against Cuba, recognizing the potential price, the failures from the
 Bay of Pigs, the assassination attempts, would have been difficult,
 if Cambodia incursions having come before the Congress and the
 Iran/Contra affair, having-to. come before. Congress- to explain, to
 explain the consequences, would have been difficult.
 No doubt Members of the minority who have cited the case that
 there are risks of Members of Congress revealing information, that
 risk is very real. But so, too, are these other consequences on na-
 tional policy. This country is going to pay for the Iran/Contra
 affair for years. The credibility of this country, young sailors who
 might be killed by those weapons that were sold to the Ayatollah.
 I don't quarrel with Mr. Hyde, leaking has taken place and it
 may take place again and it is dangerous, it is tragic, it is unlaw-,.
 ful. But I don't know any other way to rein in this administration
 or any other administration, to use the expertise of this body, to..
 insure the policies that are undertaken are thoughtful, are wise,
 and are in the national- interest.
 I believe we have a twin risk. I hope we can do our best to make
 the risk of leaks from this Congress at a minimum. But I believe as
 you look at those twin risks, we are the better for not having the
 Broomfield amendment and for insuring the administration must
 thoughtfully consider its own policies, come before this Congress,
 keeping the number of Members who are exposed to that informa-
 tion to a minimum and guaranteeing the national interests
 through this act.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. DeWine.
 CONGRESSIONAL LEAKS CITED
 Mr. DEWINE. Let me briefly respond to Mr. Kostmayer's state-
 ment that there have been no examples given involving our nation-

 al security. One that comes readily to mind appeared in a very
 public source, the Reader's Digest. I am not vouching for its validi-
 ty, but it has not been disputed. And it had to do with the Achile
 Lauro, where it was reported that a prominent Member of the
 United States Senate went to the CIA, was briefed very early in
 the morning and got in his car and proceeded to one of the early
 morning talk shows and inadvertently, I assume and I honestly
 think so, made a mistake on national TV. He disclosed some infor-
 mation which compromised some of our sources. And I can get the
 gentleman the article that appeared and to my knowledge it has
 never been disputed at all. That is one example.
 Another example that comes to mind and we don't know for sure
 the source, at least I don't. But six months or a year before our
 planes bombed Libya there was reported on the front page of the
 Washington Post an account about a proposed covert operation
 that was proposed against Libya.
 I have no idea whether that was true or not and have no way to
 vouch for the story's validity, but if it was true it would indicate
 that there was a leak either in the administration or on Capitol
 Hill which apparently scuttled a covert operation that ultimately
 might have saved lives and been very effective.
 So those are just two examples. The first we absolutely know be-
 cause it has not been disputed; it was a congressional source. The
 Senator was on nation-wide TV. So you have the video tape to
 show it. So there is example after example. So I think the gentle-
 man is simply incorrect when he states that all we have shown are
 political leaks and they are not leaks that compromised national
 security or in any way compromised our own men and women in
 the field which to me is the real threat.
 This debate has gone on. I don't think anybody will be swayed by
 anything at this point. To me, the bottom line is this. If we vote for
 the bill the way it is written today, what we are saying is, we
 cannot envision that there never will be a circumstance where that
 48-hour rule can be violated.
 If we vote down the Broomfield amendment what we are saying
 is we have a crystal ball and we can look into the future and we
 know that there never will be an instance where we will need any
 escape hatch. You are eliminating any escape from this. You are
 saying that in every single circumstance you have to give the 48-hour
 notice, that there is no circumstance we can envision where it
 would be in our national interest not to give notice. So I am voting
 for the Broomfield amendment. I think that not only is it bad
 policy the way the bill is written today, I think it is unconstitution-
 al.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Solarz.
 CONSULTATION PROCESS INCREASES RISK OF LEAKS
 Mr. SOLARZ. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I think this is
 a very close question. And I think there are some very powerful
 arguments on both sides of the issue. I think it is unfortunate, Mr.
 Chairman, that this discussion has degenerated into a debate over
 leaks and the apparent incapacity of the Congress to keep confi-
 dences.
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :

 I think all of us can agree that from time to time there have
 been leaks emanating from the Hill. Those are unfortunate.
 In some instances they may have caused severe damage to the
 nation. And surely we can all agree that steps need to be taken to
 diminish the possibility that these disclosures will take place in the
 future. But I would assume we -could also all agree that the execu-
 tive branch is also responsible for many leaks.
 During the testimony we received on this bill, it became clear
 that within the framework of the procedures the administration
 itself has established for the consideration of covert operations,
 that there is a National Security Council planning group on which
 the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense and the Chair-
 man of the Joint Chiefs and the Vice President and a number of
 other key officials in the administration serve.
 When they are informed about the possibility of a covert oper-
 ation, they in turn consult with a limited number of people within
 their agencies. At the end of -the day there are a few dozen people,
 at the very least, within the executive branch who are informed
 about these covert operations and that certainly creates a certain
 risk that information with respect to the operation will be leaked.
 We know, for every example that Mr. Hyde gave of a leak ema-
 nating from the Hill, other examples and probably more examples
 could be given of information which leaked from the executive
 branch. Yet if somebody were to say to the President, Mr. Presi-
 dent, when a covert operation is being considered, you should cut
 the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense out of the loop or
 the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs out of the loop, because we know
 that State and Defense and the Chiefs, from time to time, have
 leaked information in the past and this could compromise the secu-
 rity of the country, I suppose the President would reject that rec-
 ommendation out of hand, saying that he needs the advice of his
 most trusted advisors.
 OPPOSITION TO EXCLUSION OF SENIOR INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
 MEMBERS
 I believe it bears repetition that what the gentleman from Indi-
 ana, Mr. Hamilton said, is very relevant to this discussion: When
 Secretary Carlucci testified before our committee, he made it very
 clear that he was not opposing this legislation because of any con-
 cern on his part that the Gang of Eight would leak. - I -think he
 would be concerned if 535 Members of Congress had to be in-
 formed, but he wasn't concerned about the potential for leaks from
 the Gang of Eight because, as the gentleman from Indiana.pointed
 out, these are the leaders of Congress. These are the ones in- whom
 we have placed our trust.
 And I might say parenthetically here that one of the problems I
 have with Mr. Broomfield's amendment is that he would reduce
 the Gang of Eight to a Gang of Four, eliminating the chairman and
 ranking minority Members of the Intelligence Committee who, by
 virtue of their experience as senior Members of the Intelligence
 Committee, are probably the four Members of the House and
 Senate who are in the best position to give advice to the President
 with respect to covert operations. By contrast, the Speaker or the

 majority leader and the minority leader, while their wisdom is cer-
 tainly to be sought, may not have the same kind of expertise as the
 senior Members of the Intelligence Committees. So if you were to
 narrow it to a Gang of Four, it would be better to have the four
 leaders of the Intelligence Committees rather than the four leaders
 of the House and Senate.
 I think it is better to have a Gang of Eight and to combine the
 political wisdom with the expertise of the congressional leadership
 and the committee leadership.
 BENEFITS OF CONSULTATION VS. RISKS OF DISCLOSURE
 Let me just say in conclusion, Mr. Chairman, that what we have
 to do here is to balance conflicting interests. I certainly can con-
 ceive of circumstances where the President might feel it would be
 inappropriate to notify the Gang of Eight and there may be circum-
 stances where most of us would agree that it probably would be
 better for him not to do so.
 The problem is that there are also circumstances where we
 would all agree that it is in our interest for the President to share
 his plans for a covert operation with the Gang of Eight, precisely
 in order to get the benefit of a perspective from outside the ranges
 of his own administration.
 There have been three instances since the Intelligence Act was
 adopted where the President did not consult with the Intelligence
 Committees. Two of those three turned out to be disasters for the
 United States: the attempted rescue mission in Iran and Iran/
 Contra affair. It is certainly possible and plausible that if the Presi-
 dent had consulted with the Gang of Eight or with the Intelligence
 Committees about these two covert operations, that the nation
 would have been spared a great embarrassment and a great set-
 back.
 Finally, with respect to the Canadian exfiltration, I suspect that
 if the Canadians had been told that the President planned to con-
 sult not with 535 Members of the House and Senate, but with the
 Gang of Eight, that the Canadians would have withdrawn their ob-
 jections. I rather doubt that there would have been any leaks
 which would have compromised that particular operation.
 So when one has to balance the hypothetical possibility of a situ-
 ation in which it would be best not to consult, against the fact that
 there are situations where we can benefit from these consultations
 and the mistakes which have been made without such consultation,
 I come down in favor of the legislation and against the Broomfield
 amendment because in the long run we will have a wiser and
 sounder policy if the leadership of the Congress is involved than if
 it is excluded.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Dornan.
 INCIDENCE OF LEAKS BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
 Mr. DORNAN. I agree with my colleague, Mr. Solarz, that there
 are strong arguments on either side and I will concede that the
 leakiest operation in the city of Washington, DC, is the White
 House itself. I just read Larry Speakes' book over the weekend. A
 more disgusting and craven chronology of leaking and back biting I

 have never read in my life. In his public life, he deserves every-
 thing that has happened to him.
 Nevertheless, I have in front of me, Mr. Chairman, and Chair-
 man of the Subcommittee on Europe and Middle East, Mr. Hamil-
 ton, a letter you sent out, dated May 5, 1988. That letter refers to a
 group of members who were privileged to an executive session
 meeting with the Egyptian Minister, Field Marshall Abu Kazala.
 Mr. Hamilton writes about an. article which appeared in the
 March 28 issue of Near East Report, which contained details about
 what was discussed in the meeting, including direct quotes of the
 remarks of the Defense Minister. And the letter goes on with some
 annoyance to say, "I simply do not know who is responsible." But
 it is clear, Mr. Hamilton writes, "that someone went out of a closed
 session and reported in detail to the Near East Report."
 I also have before me a letter that was just shown to Mr. Kost-
 mayer that was written to Jim Wright, our Speaker, from Edward
 Fox, assistant secretary of legislative affairs who used to sit behind
 us here as one of our staffers. He says, "Dear Mr. Wright, the New
 York Times, May 2, carried a highly detailed story by reporter
 Robert Pear on this year's Javits Report," named after Jacob
 Javits. The report was provided to the New York Times by a
 Member of Congress.
 "I wish to express the department's concern about this unauthor-
 ized disclosure of classified information." It goes on to say that
 "press stories such as this harm not only the administration, Con-
 gress, our foreign friends and allies as well, the article confused aid
 with cash sales, blurring the line between recipients of scarce secu-
 rity dollars and cash cuts."
 "It overlooks the consultation process between Congress and the
 administration, gives the impression that the Javits Report is the
 basis of a master strategy rather than a best effort to project possi-
 ble sales and unauthorized disclosure will raise doubts about the
 government's ability to maintain confidentiality with every one of
 the 32 nations listed in a report meant to provide focus for confi-
 dential discussions between Congress and the administration on as-
 pects of our security relations worldwide."
 Now I can recall, Mr. Chairman, the former Chairman saying to
 me personally in the doorway over here that he is sick of leaks
 coming out of our closed sessions and if it happens again, he will
 excoriate two Members publicly if they don't stop leaking. This was
 in 1982 after a session with Secretary of State Alexander Haig,
 shortly before he resigned.
 I think it is peculiar when a Member like Mr. Kostmayer says
 that these are "political leaks" and not national security leaks. I
 have taken note that over 50 Members have stood in front of and
 crawled on top of the B-2 stealth bomber and not a whisper of that
 program was leaked to the press. Only a handful of Members know
 of the existence of the F-19 stealth fighter, not a whisper of that
 has gotten into the press. I believe it is because Members can see
 tangible evidence with weapons situations that a slip of the lip will
 sink the ship.
 But when it comes to foreign policy matters, some Members feel
 that they are qualified to judge what is right and what is wrong.
 They make the determination whether or not their leak has any-

 181
 thing to do with national security policy. So they proceed to leak
 and then they will use as an excuse the leaks from the White
 House, as a precedent which has occurred even under a tough con-
 servative President.
 PRESIDENTIAL FLEXIBILITY NEEDED IN WAR AGAINST TERRORISM
 For this reason I think that the Broomfield amendment is rea-
 sonable, it tightens up the focus of our responsibility under the
 Constitution to protect national security. I would even want a
 President Dukakis to have the same abilities that President Carter
 had when he was taking core samples of the sand trying to rescue
 our hostages in Iran. I think we are overreacting here to the Iran/
 Contra mess and that we should not take away from a Dukakis or
 Bush, the ability to handle terrorism. We have not had a declara-
 tion of war since December 8, 1941, and we probably won't have
 one for the rest of our lives.
 Members should be put on notice that if they leak, it will be con-
 sidered treason. We have to have this thing tightened up. I think
 we are wasting our time if we don't adopt the Broomfield amend-
 ment which is reasonable and logical and is consistent with the
 legal process. The President is certainly going to veto anything
 that restricts his ability to fight terrorism and to construct a for-
 eign policy. This amendment represents the classic struggle be-
 tween the executive branch and Congress over jurisdiction in the
 foreign policy field. Let's give our Commander-in-Chief maximum
 flexibility.
 I would hope that the next White House will clean up the leak-
 ing syndrome. Vote for the Broomfield amendment because it rein-
 forces our constitutional responsibilities in line with this rigorous
 debate that has gone on since the continental Congress.
 I thank the Chairman.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mrs. Meyers.
 BROOMFIELD AMENDMENT OFFERS REALISTIC APPROACH TO
 CONSULTATION
 Mrs. MEYERS. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if maybe we aren't having
 a somewhat naive discussion here. I ask the Members to picture
 themselves as President of the United States, and a country comes
 to you and says, we can give you a great deal of help with your
 hostages, some of them that we have in our embassy, but you are
 absolutely not to tell anyone.
 Can any of you picture yourself looking at that person and
 saying, well, of course, the Secretary of State will know, a couple of
 my top security people here in the White House will know and
 then I will tell eight people on the Hill and, of course because of
 them, probably another three or four very top ranking staff people
 will know, so that there will only be about 20 people involved.
 I don't see the President making that kind of a response. I don't
 care what we do here today. If lives are at stake, I think the Presi-
 dent is going to do what is right and what he can do to save those
 lives. I am somewhat appalled, if I understood correctly, what is
 being said, or suggested, that if classified material is political
 in nature then it is all right to leak it. I am not sure that is
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 what was being said, but if it is, I am appalled. We have a kind of
 an adversarial kind of government and almost everything that we
 do is political in nature.
 I think that we should be more realistic in our assessment of the
 situation. I, too, am appalled by the Iran/Contra affair and admit-
 tedly, everyone in this room is saying that it is the only time that
 the failure to tell Congress has happened, that any Member in this
 room could condemn. The other time was when Jimmy Carter
 made the attempt to rescue the hostages or when Reagan dealt with
 the Canadians over the Iranian hostages.
 I think that we should be, more realistic in our approach and sup-
 port the Broomfield amendment.
 BILL FULFILLS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY OF CONGRESS-
 Chairman FASCELL. Well, let the Chair say I am opposed to the
 Broomfield amendment. We either assume the responsibility of
 oversight or we don't. If leaks are the criteria, then we wouldn't let
 the administration do anything either because of all the leaks at-
 tributable to the administration. Not this one particularly, any ad-
 ministration.
 It is just the nature of the beast. You have eight people on the
 national security planning group, and. if we can't work it out be-
 tween the Executive and the Congress with respect to those mat-
 ters that are vital to the national security of the United States,
 maybe we ought to have a different system.
 But I am not for a different system. We have to make this one
 work and we are going to have to do the best we can in an open
 society. This is a reasonable balance, it appears to me. The legisla-
 tion doesn't stop a President. It simply requires him to give notice.

 Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to reserve a point of

 Chairman FASCELL. The point of order is reserved.
 The gentleman from New York is recognized in support of his
 amendment.
 AMENDMENT IMPOSES PENALTIES FOR LEAK OF INFORMATION
 Mr. SOLOMON. Since we have had some debate on this issue al-
 ready, let me say that this amendment is straightforward and puts
 some teeth into this bill. Specifically, it would make clear to Mem-
 bers of Congress, to their staffs, and to the executive branch as
 well, that there will be a price to be paid for leaking information
 about the covert operations which are the subject of the notifica-
 tion requirement in this bill.
 I just ask you all: Is that so terrible? I ask those of you who sup-
 port this bill, why do you want to set up a procedure and then ne-
 glect to protect it? And that is all this amendment proposes to do,
 to impose penalties on any person in the legislative branch and the
 executive branch alike who leaks information about activities regu-
 lated by this particular bill.
 Mr. Chairman, isn't it about time we started taking our responsi-
 bilities seriously? I don't need to go down a laundry list of leaks.
 Our colleague, Henry Hyde, did that for us earlier today, and at
 the hearing last week; every example he cited concerned the Iran-
 Contra Committee alone. Everything you can imagine: from the
 identity of a CIA under-cover officer; to the contents of the Secre-
 tary of State's private interview; to the secrets of an Assistant At-
 torney General's testimony; to secret documents; to the identities of
 foreign countries; and allegations of every stripe were fair game.
 And they all found their way into the press, courtesy of committee
 Members and staff.
 Mr. Chairman, that is wrong. Here is a recent one for you which
 was mentioned I think by the gentleman from California, Mr.
 Dornan. But the ink wasn't even dry on this year's edition of the
 Javits report before a Member of Congress made sure the New
 York Times had a copy of it and was drawing its own inaccurate
 conclusions. And remember, the Javits report itself is a part of con-
 sultation or notification process between the executive branch and
 the Congress.
 If we don't have enough self-respect, at least respect the sensibili-
 ties of our friends and allies around the world. Let's at least try to
 give them some assurance that they can deal with the United
 States with some measure of consistency and confidentiality. Let's
 make clear to them that we have one Secretary of State and not
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :

 535. Too many people in this town are seeking influence without
 responsibility. That is the problem, and all of the consultations and
 notifications in the world will not mean anything unless people un-
 derstand there are consequences for their actions.
 Mr. Chairman, existing espionage laws require prosecution to
 prove that there was. intent to injure the United States or to give
 advantage to other countries. Dante Fascell has mentioned, and
 rightly so, that we ought to have oversight over covert activities;
 and, yes, Mr. Chairman, you are right, but we should not have veto
 power. And unless we enact this amendment imposing specific pen-
 alties for leaking classified information regarding the 48-hour noti-
 fication, any member of this committee, any staff member out there,
 anybody can go out and leak it to the press and absolutely nothing
 will be done about it.
 PENALTIES IMPOSED IN SOLOMON AMENDMENT
 So Mr. Smith of Florida complained other countries were setting
 the policies of this government, but let me tell you when other
 countries lose confidence in us, it is going to affect the national se-
 curity of this country. So I would hope this amendment would be
 enacted. Basically all it says is that there is going to be a minimum
 penalty, a minimum penalty of $1,000, or a maximum of $20,000, or
 there is going to be a minimum penalty of, 90 days in jail or a max-
 imum of five years, or both.
 So really all we are saying is if any of you do leak classified in-
 formation, the minimum penalty we are going to charge you is a
 lousy $1,000 for jeopardizing this country.
 ADMINISTRATION POSITION ON SOLOMON AMENDMENT
 Mr. WEISS. Will the gentleman yield?
 Will you indicate to us whether, in fact, the administration has
 taken a position on this amendment and what that position is?
 Mr. SOLOMON. The administration has not taken a position. We
 did not ask one of them.
 Mr. WEISS. Thank you.
 AMENDMENT EXCEEDS SCOPE OF COMMITTEE'S JURISDICTION
 Chairman FASCELL. I would like to address myself to the amend-
 ment, if I may, and say I am in strong opposition to the amend-
 ment. The Parliamentarians of the House advise the committee
 this amendment technically is not in order, is not germane. But
 aside from that, let's examine what this amendment does.
 First, it broadens the scope of the espionage laws as it may apply
 to an administration official who supplies the information to the
 Committee on Intelligence. That may be desirable, it may not be, I
 don't know. But that is what. it does.
 It also, of course, applies to Members and staff who in some way
 come into possession of the information as a result of information
 that goes to the Permanent Select Committee and provides for a
 criminal penalty. It may be desirable to write this into the criminal
 law of the United States, I don't know. It seems to me, however,
 that this is a serious matter which needs to be considered by the

 187
 Judiciary Committee, that committee having jurisdiction over the
 criminal statutes and not this committee.
 Another important aspect of this matter, as I see it, is that it
 would certainly seem to change the whole constitutional concept of
 free speech and debate. I don't know that we want to make that
 quick a judgment on such an important constitutional issue.
 Now, maybe the Congress ought to pursue the issue. But I am not
 prepared and I don't think this committee is prepared, to deal with
 the complex questions concerning free speech and the protection
 that surrounds a Member of Congress with respect to his right to
 speak in the pursuit of his duties in the Congress of the United
 States. I am not talking about outside, I don't know that we ought
 to take that lightly. We need testimony. Obviously, there are more
 than two sides on this matter, and it ought to be carefully consid-
 ered by the committee of jurisdiction that deals with the criminal
 statutes. It is not a matter which ought to be considered by this
 committee.
 I don't want to rule on the point of order, I would just as soon
 have a vote on this matter and let the appropriate committee of
 the Congress deal with the subject if that is the intent of propo-
 nents.
 Mr. Kostmayer, for debate only.
 EXISTING LAW ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. Mr. Chairman, we covered a lot of this territory
 in the discussion of the Broomfield amendment, but I would like to
 say a couple things without extending this debate much longer. I
 would like to point out the gentleman from New York raised the
 issue of disclosing the names of intelligence agents or CIA agents-
 all of us understand and recognize how dangerous that is-and he
 then said, and I quote, "that kind of thing currently is fair game."
 The fact of the matter is that that information is just wrong, as
 is a lot of the information he has given. The fact of the matter is
 current law, 50 U.S. Code 421, a bill we passed in .1982, called the
 Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982, prohibits any individ-
 ual from identifying or revealing the name of these individuals. So
 to suggest this amendment is necessary for that kind of thing is in-
 accurate.
 Secondly, I want to say that existing law makes, I think, some
 important distinctions which the Solomon amendment fails to
 make when it comes to revealing this kind of information, I am
 talking about the Espionage Act, and in part it reads-and I
 quote-"For the purpose of obtaining information respecting the
 national defense, with intent or reason to believe that the informa-
 tion is to be used to the injury of the United States or to the advan-
 tage of any foreign nation."
 That characterizes the kind of information you can't leak. But
 the gentleman from New York's amendment changes that very
 dramatically. He would cover all information that the administra-
 tion chooses to classify. Anything that this administration or any
 other administration wants to classify can't be leaked by members
 of the Intelligence Committee, and what that means is that the ad-
 ministration comes up before the Intelligence Committee and tells

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 the committee that leading members of the Salvadoran Govern-
 ment are responsible for killing American -citizens in El Salvador,
 and they could call that classified information.
 This amendment provides a mechanism to this administration, or
 to any other administration, to simply exclude from congressional
 and public debate any information they don't want covered because
 it doesn't speak just to information which would jeopardize our na-
 tional security, it speaks to all classified information. I don't think
 we should give the executive., the right to do that, not this execu-
 tive, not any executive.
 We have adequate law in this regard. We have the Espionage
 Act. In the Morrison ruling of not very long ago, the Fourth Circuit
 Court of Appeals ruled leaks are covered by the Espionage Act. Mr.
 Morrison himself is currently serving in prison for leaking infor-
 mation, not to a foreign government, but to a defense publication.
 The courts have now ruled that the Espionage Act covers leaks
 that members of the executive, that Members of Congress, that or-
 dinary citizens, such as Mr. Morrison, make.
 The proposed amendment would be bad law. It is unnecessary, it
 gives the administration the right to simply rule out any informa-
 tion which Congress wants to consider or which the public should
 have the right to know about because the administration finds it
 embarrassing. And the question of leaks is currently covered under
 law, and the amendment is unnecessary.
 I urge it be defeated.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Lagomarsino.
 AMENDMENT APPLIES TO INFORMATION RECEIVED UNDER 48-HOUR
 NOTIFICATION
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. I yield to the gentleman from New York, Mr.
 Solomon.
 Mr. SOLOMON. I thank the gentleman from New York.
 Let me point out to =the chairman and Mr. Kostmayer, of course
 you know if it were not the question of leaks on this 48-hour notifi-
 cation, probably we would have unanimous support for the legisla-
 tion. It is the concern about leaks.
 Now, in spite of what the good chairman has said and what my
 good friend, Mr. Kostmayer has said, this amendment only deals
 with the 48-hour notification, it does not deal with any of the other
 espionage cases or any other leaking. As a matter of fact, what I
 am concerned about, if you look at existing law, it says, "which in-
 formation the possessor has reason to believe is used to the injury
 of the United States or to the advantage of any other foreign
 nation." That is the construction of it.
 Finally, as far as speech and debate are concerned, Mr. Chair-
 man, if you read the language in the amendment, it says "Except
 with the authorization of the President or pursuant to the applica-
 ble rules of a House of Congress". Now, that means speech and
 debate on the Floor of this Congress and any other rules this Con-
 gress might adopt affecting House Members.
 So, Mr. Chairman, I would urge support of the amendment. The
 only way you are going to get this bill through the House and to
 the President's desk for his signature is if we enact the Broomfield

 amendment along with this penalty on leaks...Then you might-have
 a bill that becomes law, which is what all of you. on that side of the
 aisle want, and maybe what we want too.
 Otherwise I think we are going to be able to sustain a veto.
 Think of that when you vote on this and when you have a chance
 to- vote on the Broomfield substitute on the Floor of Congress.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Wolpe.
 Mr. WoLPE. Thank` you, Mr. Chairman
 The previous speaker just referred-, to- the, speech and debate
 clause. I think it is clear the amendment before us does, in fact,
 raise some serious constitutional questions. I understand House
 Counsel is present here. I wonder if ,we might ask him to share
 with us his opinion as to whether this amendment, as it is now
 crafted, raises constitutional concerns.
 STATEMENT OF STEVEN ROSS,.GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE CLERK OF THE
 HOUSE
 Mr. Ross. Let me introduce myself. I am Steven Ross,. General
 Counsel to the Clerk of the House. In that capacity, our office rep-
 resents the House, its Members, officers and committees in. litiga-
 tion, and at various times our office is called upon to provide legal
 advice on matters respecting the prerogatives and privileges of the
 House.
 EFFECT OF AMENDMENT ON SPEECH AND DEBATE PRIVILEGE
 The question is whether the amendment would raise questions
 under the speech or debate privilege or would contravene the privi-
 lege. The amendment, as I read it, and I must say the interpreta-
 tion given by its author in his remarks just a few seconds ago, dif-
 fers from my understanding : of the amendment as I read it. The
 amendment as I read it would apply to statements made by Mem-
 bers on the=Floor since it simply says "any disclosure".
 The gentleman from New York in his interpretive remarks indi-
 cated that it is his reading of his amendment that any remarks
 made that conform with any House rule would be permissible
 under the amendment. Presumably, that would allow any remarks
 made in committee sessions, any remarks made on the Floor, and
 since the House rules also provide in various aspects allowing
 Members prerogatives and staff to communicate to the public, I
 would have to get further amplification from the gentleman from
 New York whether remarks made to. the public would be allowable.
 It seems to me that if. his reading of his amendment is going to
 be so narrow as to allow such remarks by Members,. I am not sure
 what the amendment does. If the amendment is, as I have read it,
 which is any disclosure, then it would contravene the speech or
 debate clause because it would seem to. seek to apply a criminal
 penalty for remarks made by Members in the course of legislative
 debate.
 The Supreme Court has addressed the question on a couple of oc-
 casions as to whether or not there could be a narrow institutional.
 waiver of the speech and debate. clause. The Court in the Brewster
 decision raised the possibility that a narrowly crafted statute would
 serve as an institutional waiver of the speech or debate clause and

 190
 would permit criminalization or other penalty for legislative ac-
 tions by Members.
 In the Helstoski case, decided later, however, the Court held that
 the bribery statute would not constitute such a narrowly drawn
 statute to represent a waiver by the institution, and it seems to
 myself, and I believe to most who have looked at the decision and
 looked at the field, to foreclose the possibility that the House and
 Senate could draw a statute which would serve to waive the privi-
 lege.
 So I would say that if it is the intention of the amendment to
 apply to any communications or actions of Members which would
 under current law be considered legislative, and those would be
 communications which are part of the deliberative and communica-
 tive process which constitutes the legislative process, the amend-
 ment could not be-the criminal penalty could not be applied con-
 sistent with the speech and debate clause.
 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
 Mr. HYDE. May I ask a question of counsel?
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Hyde.
 Mr. HYDE. Thank you. Mr. Ross, but isn't that an affirmative de-
 fense? That doesn't invalidate or render the amendment unconsti-
 tutional. If a Congressman says something he shouldn't say and the
 speech and debate clause protects him, he asserts that that is not
 true.
 Mr. Ross. I would disagree. The clause has not been read and ap-
 plied by the courts to be an affirmative defense. The courts refer to
 the speech or debate clause as jurisdictional. It takes away from
 the jurisdiction of the courts--
 Mr. HYDE. Insofar as that Member of Congress is concerned.
 Mr. Ross. Insofar as a Member of Congress or any part of the leg-
 islative entities, because it has also been extended to staff. But the
 clause is the embodiment of the separation of powers doctrine and,
 as such, is a proscription not only to the court but to all aspects of
 our government as to how legislative actions by Members should be
 treated.
 It says, "shall not be questioned in any other place", and I don't
 think it is a fair reading of the clause to limit it to an affirmative
 defense in light of its jurisdictional nature and in light of the fact
 that it is the, as I said, the embodiment of the separation of powers
 doctrine.
 Mr. HYDE. Then under the Intelligence Identities Protection Act,
 are Members of Congress covered by that and staff and secretaries
 and however you want to string that out? Are they covered by
 that?
 Mr. Ross. If a Member of Congress got up on the Floor of the
 House and in the course of a speech which constituted part of the
 legislative process, as speeches on the Floor do, revealed the identi-
 ty of an agent or did anything else that would constitute a crime,
 the penalty could not be the application of a criminal penalty, that
 would contravene the speech and debate clause.

 That is not to say that a Member who transgresses a standard is
 absent from penalty. The Constitution makes it clear that each
 House is empowered -to ,punish its Members--
 Mr. HYDE. In. other words, turn them over to the - Ethics Commit-
 tee, right?
 Mr. Ross. That is one possibility, yes.
 Mr. HYDE. Thank you.
 SPEECH AND DEBATE CLAUSE APPLICABLE TO AMENDMENT
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Kostmayer.
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. The speech and- debate. clause is applicable to
 the Solomon amendment as well as to the Intelligence Identities
 Protection Act of 1982, isn't it?
 Mr. Ross. Yes. The only question I raised is that Mr. Solomon, in
 his remarks, seemed to indicate that it was not intended to apply
 to any legislative speech. As I read the amendment on paper, it
 certainly seemed to me to apply to legislative actions. If it is inter-
 preted not to apply, then the question is never. raised.
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. Mr. Hyde indicated there was something faulty
 about the Intelligence Identities Protection Act because Members
 of Congress, if they are exercising their, rights under the speech
 and debate clause, -would not be penalized. That applies not only to
 the act just mentioned but the proposed amendment offered by Mr.
 Solomon.
 Mr. Ross. Or any other Act of Congress:
 TYPE OF DISCLOSURES SUBJECT TO PENALTY UNDER AMENDMENT
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. I would- like to ask the gentleman from New
 York a question. During his, discussion, I understood the gentleman
 from New York to say his amendment applied only to information
 contained in the findings submitted by the. President to the Intelli-
 gence Committee. It was my. understanding, and I think the under-
 standing of the counsel, that the amendment applied to- any infor-
 mation provided under Title V of the National Security Act to the
 Intelligence Committee.
 Now does it pertain to anything the Intelligence Committee gets
 pursuant to Title V, which is a lot of information and quite broad,
 or does it apply only to that information- which the- Intelligences
 Committee receives which is in those findings?
 Mr. SOLOMON. Will the gentleman yield?
 If you read the third sentence, it says "access to classified infor-
 mation produced as a, result of the provisions of this title." It deals
 only with this information produced as a result of the findings
 from the 48-hour notification. It doesn't deal with anything else..
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. Mr. Chairman, I think that is fairly impor-
 tant--
 Chairman FASCELL. Not only that, but I am sorry to say it is in.
 error on its face. It clearly amends Title V of the National Security
 Act of 1947 and adds a whole new section.
 Mr. KOSTMAYER. And I would hope the gentleman would amend
 his amendment to make clear this is not intended.. to be applicable
 to information provided to the Intelligence Committee pursuant to

 Title V but rather only that information contained in those find-
 ings.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Weiss, do you have a question of coun-
 sel?
 ACCOUNTABILITY OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
 Mr. WEISS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 I want to really clarify the issue, and maybe it is a restatement,
 but I think it may be important. Are you telling us as counsel to
 the House that regardless of what the executive branch of govern-
 ment decides to classify as secret, or top secret, or restricted infor-
 mation, any Member of this body may in the course of regular
 speech and debate on the floor of the House or in appropriate com-
 mittee, disclose and divulge that information in public session with-
 out having criminal penalties apply or any other penalties as set
 forth by either this proposed legislation or by the executive
 branch?
 Mr. Ross. There are two aspects to your question. Let me take
 them in reverse order. In terms of whether or not a Member of
 Congress could be subject to criminal penalties for disclosure of in-
 formation in the course of either a Floor presentation or a commit-
 tee session, that question was answered by the Supreme Court in
 the Gravel case in which the Supreme Court held that Senator
 Gravel could not be questioned and, therefore, could not be held ac-
 countable, in a criminal sense, for his conduct, including the re-
 lease of information at a committee session of the United States
 Senate. Separate questions are raised as to disclosures or dissemi-
 nations outside the Senate.   -
 LEGAL BASIS FOR DETERMINING CLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION
 As to the first part of your question, which raises a concern of
 the classification system, I must start my answer by saying that
 the classification system is not a creature of statute. The President
 has issued an Executive order in his authority as the Chief of the
 executive branch to classify and categorize certain information. In-
 formation that the Congress receives or that a committee receives
 once it is within the Congress is just as congressional as it is Exec-
 utive and Congress could categorize it and treat it as it sees it.
 It is not for the President, by issuance of an Executive Order, to
 tell this committee that it must treat information in one way or
 another. If this committee has received information by virtue of its
 constitutional authority to conduct oversight or to make inquiries
 in support of its legislative authority, then it is up to the commit-
 tee and the House or the Congress to define how that information
 will be treated and how it should be treated.
 Chairman FASCELL. Mr. Solarz.
 AMENDMENT APPLICABLE TO EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES
 Mr. SOLARZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 Mr. Ross, in the amendment before us it says, it applies to any
 person otherwise having had authorized access to classified infor-
 mation produced as a result of the provisions of this title. As you
 interpret the amendment, does this mean that someone in the ex-

 ecutive branch who was informed about. a covert operation, let's
 say it was under discussion with the administration before it was
 submitted pursuant. to, this, legislation to the Intelligence Commit-
 tees, if such a person in the executive branch divulged information
 about the covert operation, would they be guilty of violating this
 amendment, or does- this only apply to people who receive the, in-
 formation produced as a result of the provisions of this title, pre-
 sumaUii meaning-the Congress?
 Mr. Ross. Let me make sure I understand your, question. Is the
 question- whether the amendment--
 Mr. SoLARz. Does this apply to members of the executive branch
 or only to. Members of Congress and. their staffs who receive the
 information as a result, of the provisions of the title?
 Mr. Ross. As I read Mr. Solomon's amendment, it is any person,
 executive branch or legislative branch, who has access to-the infor-
 mation. And so it would not-Mr. Solomon's amendment would. not
 be limited only to members of the legislative branch.
 Mr. SOLOMON. And that is the intent of the amendment too.

 The Honorable Dante B. Fascell
 Chairman
 Committee on Foreign Affairs
 Washington, DC 20515
 I am writing to you because of my deep concern about the
 proposed leak amendment' to the covert action oversight.bill (M.R.
 3822).
 The adoption of a statute criminalizing the leaking of
 information haslong been a"goal of the'current Administration -?
 one that Congress-has long rejected.  Yet, the proposed :amendment
 would establish a leak offense.
 It is ironic that the amendment is offered to the oversight
 bill, for it would- seriously jeopardize the oversight process.
 Under the amendment, information received by 'Congress would be
 subject to criminal provisions of a type not applied to any
 other . classified information.  Members of Congress who received
 classified information in the course of their oversight duties
 would be subject to criminal provisions not applicable to
 executive branch officials.
 Moreover, the amendment is not limited .to".information
 relevant to covert actions, the subject' of the bill to which it
 is being offered.   Rather, it applies to,all information received
 by Congress pursuant to the oversight title of the National
 security ?Act.
 The amendment seems-to concede the argument that Congress
 is the primary source of leaks of classified-information, when
 we know that just.the opposite is true.
 The-provision would be ripe forabuse by the Executive
 Branch since the Executive Branch-would decide which leaks to
 overlook and which to prosecute.  The provision would even'
 inhibit Members "from discussing information otherwise. in the
 public domain if the information" was still technically classified
 and had been provided to Congress.

 The amendment also has serious implications for the ongoing
 dispute over the scope of the Speech and Debate Clause of the
 Constitution.
 Although there is an unfairness issue -- and a separation of
 powersriminalissue
 penalties, making I do not Members
 think it Congress
 would s cure uniquely ly subject to
 extend it to Executive Branch officials.   Indeed, such ravchangeto
 would only compound the difficulties posed by the amendment,
 turning it into a general leak statute.
 Because of these serious problems and because Members and
 their staffs are already subject to the full force of the
 espionage laws, I urge you to work against this amendment.   I
 would be happy to do whatever I can to assist you.
 With kindest regards.

 Offi-
 Honorable Dante B. Fascell
 Chairman
 committee on Foreign Affairs
 U.S.  House-of Representatives-,
 Washington, D.C. 20515
 This letter presents the views.of,the Department of Justice
 on R.R. 3&22,,.a bill relating to the: system of congressional
 oversight of intelligence activities.   The-Department of Justice
 opposes enactment of this legislation because-we believe it would
 unconstitutionally intrude on the President's authority to
 conduct the foreign relations, of the United States.
 H.R.  3822 would repeal the Hughes-Ryan Amendment,  and
 substantially revise the congressional reporting requirements of
 the National Security Act.   Besides appearing, to broaden the
 congressional notification requirements,  section,3 of H.. R.  3822
 would delete from: section.501(a) of the NationalSecurity Act the:
 present expresssacknowledgment.that the. Act imposes reporting
 requirements on the President.only insofar asrthe requirements
 are consistent with his authorities and : duties under the United
 States Constitution.!  It-would also delete the Act's provision
 !   Section 501(a) presently provides (emphasis-added):
 To the extent consistent with..all applicable
 authorities and duties,  including those conferred bv.
 th            Constitution..uPOn:theexecutive and legislative
 branches- of the Government;,:. and..to the extent
 consistent with due regard. for. the=protection from
 unauthorized disclosure of classified- information and'
 information relating-to intelligence sources and
 methods, thelDirector of Central Intelligence^andt^the,
 heads of al-l departments, agencies, and other entities
 of the United:States involved'in intelligence
 activities shall --

 acknowledging the President's independent constitutional
 authority, namely section 501(b), which provides for presidential
 discretion in deferring notice to Congress concerning excep-
 tionally sensitive intelligence activities.2  In place of the
 current Act's provision acknowledging the President's authority
 to provide "timely notice" in such sensitive situations, section
 3 of H.R. 3822 would purport to require that such notice be given
 within 48 hours after the initiation of such operations.
 In keeping with the long-standing view of Presidents of
 every Administration that has considered this issue, the
 Department believes that these provisions of H.R. 3822 are
 unconstitutional.   As you know, these same issues were the
 subject of thorough debate and extensive negotiation in 1980,
 when Congress was considering proposals for intelligence over-
 sight legislation.   It was the position of the Administration
 l(...continued)
 the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on
 Intelligence of the House of Representatives .
 fully and currently informed of all intelligence
 activities which are the responsibility of, are engaged-
 in by, or are carried out for or on behalf of, any
 department, agency, or entity of the United States,
 including any significant anticipated intelligence
 activity, except that (A) the foregoing provision shall'
 not require approval of the intelligence committees as
 a condition precedent to the initiation of any such
 anticipated intelligence activity, and (B)  if the
 President determines it is essential to limit prior
 notice to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting
 vital interests of the United States, such notice shall
 be limited to the chairman and ranking minority members
 of the intelligence committees, the Speaker and
 minority leader of the House of Representatives, and
 the majority and minority leaders of the Senate.     -
 Needless to say, deleting the underscored language would be only
 symbolic and could not-alter the constitutional rights or duties
 of either branch.
 2  Section 501(b) currently provides (emphasis added):
 The President shall fully inform the intelligence
 committees in a timely fashion of intelligence
 operations in foreign countries, other than activities
 intended solely for obtaining necessary intelligence,
 for which prior notice was not given under subsection
 (a) of this section and shall provide a statement of
 the reasons for not giving prior notice.

 then, as it is of this Administration-now, that there maybe
 exceptional occasions on which the Presidents exclusive and
 inalienable constitutional duties in the area of foreign-affairs-
 would preclude him from giving prior notice of very sensitive
 intelligence-related operations.
 This Administration,. like: prior Administrations, is eager
 to work with Congress in devising:?arrangements to: satisfy: the.
 legitimate interests. in. legislative, oversight.  But the.
 executive. branch'. in: 1980 recognized' that there. is- a. point beyond
 which the Constitution simplywould':not permit.. congressional.
 encumbering of the President's ability' to.init'iate,, dlrect';,and
 control. the sensitive-national - security activities at issue here...
 Testifying before the Senate Select.Comaittee.in 1980, then CIA
 Director Stansfield: Turner emphattically pointed out that the
 prior notification. then being-considered "wouldamount-to
 excessive intrusion by the-Congress.into?the'President''s exercise,
 of his powers under the Constitution."  See National -  ntelliaence
 Act of 1980?   Hearings before, the ?S'ena 'e Select Comaittee._on,
 Intelligence?  96th Cong., 2d?Sess:  17  (1980).
 The Constitution confers on the-President the?authority'andi
 duty to conduct the-. foreign, relations of the-United States:..
 Covert intelligence-related operations. in foreign-. countries, are,
 among. the most sitive and vital. aspects" of this duty,. and., they
 lie at the very core; of. the- Pr'.esidant"s-Article.I.I responsibili-
 ties.   In this letter the. Department. will not seek to detail all,
 the authorities and'precedents relevant to-our conclusion'that an,
 absolute prior notice requirement of the kind proposed in H;R..
 3822 would be unconstitutional.   In'summary, however, the.
 Department believes that the. Constitution, as. confirmed' by
 historical.practice.;andtclear statements of the United States.
 Supreme Court, leaves the conduct. of foreign, relations,-which-
 must must include foreign intelligence operations, to the President
 except insofar as the Constitution gives-specific tasks to the
 Congress.
 The principal source,for the'President'sswide-and. inherent
 discretion to act for the nation in?foreign affairs is section 1
 of article II of the Constitution wherein it is stated:- 'The-
 executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United
 States of America:.' The clause has long been held to confer on
 the President plenary authority to represent the United States
 and to pursue its interests outside the borders of the country,
 subject only to limits specifically set forth in the Constitution
 itself and to such statutory limitations as the Constitution
 permits Congress to impose by exercising one of its. enumerated
 powers.   The President's executive power includes all the
 discretion traditionally available to any sovereign in its
 external relations, except insofar as the Constitution places
 that discretion in another branch of the government.

 Before the Constitution was ratified, Alexander Hamilton
 explained in The Federalist why the President's executive power
 would include the conduct of foreign policy:   "The essence of the
 legislative authority is to enact laws, or, in other words to
 prescribe rules for the regulation of the society; while the
 execution of the laws and the employment of the common strength,
 either for this purpose or for the common defense, seem to
 comprise all the functions of the executive magistrate."  See The
 Federalist No. 75, at 450 (A. Hamilton)  (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).
 By recognizing this fundamental distinction between "prescribing
 rules for the regulation of the society" and "employing the
 common strength for the common defense" the Framers made clear
 that the Constitution gave to Congress only those powers in the
 area of foreign affairs that directly involve the exercise of
 legal authority over American citizens.   As to other matters in
 which the nation acts as a sovereign entity in relation to
 outsiders, the Constitution delegates the necessary authority to
 the President in the form of the "executive Power."
 The authority of the President to conduct foreign relations
 was first asserted by George Washington and acknowledged by the
 First Congress.   Without consulting Congress, President
 Washington determined that the United States would remain neutral
 in the war between France and Great Britain.   The Supreme Court
 and Congress, too, have recognized the President's broad
 discretion to act on his own initiative in the field of foreign
 affairs.   In the leading case, United States v. Curtiss-Wright
 Export Coro    299 U.S.  304  (1936),  the Court drew a sharp
 distinction between the President's relatively 'limited inherent
 powers to act in the domestic sphere and his far-reaching
 discretion to act on his own authority in managing the external
 relations of the country.     The Supreme Court emphatically
 declared that this discretion derives from the Constitution
 itself, stating that "the President [is] the sole organ of the
 federal government in the field of international relations -- a
 power which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act
 of Congress." 299 U.S.  at 319-320  (emphasis added).   Moreover,  as
 the Curtiss-Wright Court noted,  the Senate Committee on Foreign
 Relations acknowledged this principle at an early date in our
 history, stating that "the President is the constitutional
 representative of the United States with regard to foreign
 nations."  The committee also noted "that (the President's
 constitutional] responsibility is the surest pledge for the
 faithful discharge of his duty" and the Committee believed that
 "interference of the Senate in the direction of foreign negotia-
 tions [is] calculated to diminish that responsibility and
 thereby to impair the best security for the national safety."
 299 U.S. at 319  (quoting U.S. Senate, Reports, Committee on
 Foreign Relations, vol. 8, p. 24  (Feb. 15, 1816)).
 Curtiss-Wright thus confirms the President's inherent Article II
 authority to engage in a wide range of extraterritorial foreign
 policy initiatives,  including intelligence activities -- an

 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 authority that derives from the Constitution, not from the
 passage of specific authorizing legislation.
 Despite this wide-ranging authority, Presidents have been
 careful to consult regularly with Congress to seek support and
 counsel in matters of foreign affairs.   Moreover, we recognize
 that the President's authority over foreign policy, precisely
 because its nature requires that it be wide and relatively
 unconfined by preexisting constraints, is inevitably somewhat
 ill-defined at the margins.   Whatever questions may arise at the
 outer reaches of his power, however, the conduct of secret
 negotiations and intelligence operations lies at the very heart
 of the President's executive power.   The Supreme Court's
 Curtiss-Wright decision itself notes the President's exclusive
 power to negotiate on behalf of the United States.   The Supreme
 Court has also, and more recently, emphasized that this core
 presidential function is by no means limited to matters directly
 involving treaties.   In United States v.  Nixon,  418 U.S.  683
 (1974), the Court invoked the basic Curtiss-Wright distinction
 between the domestic and international context to explain its
 rejection of President Nixon's claim of an absolute privilege of
 confidentiality for all communications between him and his
 advisors.   While rejecting this sweeping and undifferentiated
 claim of executive privilege as'applied to communications
 involving domestic affairs, the Court repeatedly and emphatically
 stressed that military or diplomatic secrets are in a different
 category:   such secrets are intimately linked to the President's
 Article II duties, where the "courts have traditionally-shown the
 utmost deference to Presidential responsibilities."  418 U.S. at
 710  (emphasis added).
 We are unaware of any provision of the Constitution that
 affirmatively authorizes Congress to have the role provided in
 H.R.  3822.   Congress' implied authority to oversee the activities
 of executive branch agencies is grounded on Congress' need for
 information to consider and enact needful and appropriate
 legislation.   Congress in the performance of this legislative
 function, however, does not require detailed knowledge of
 virtually all intelligence activities particularly prior to
 initiation.   Oversight of ongoing operations has the potential to
 interfere with the ability of the President to discharge the
 duties imposed on him by the Constitution.   Accordingly, the
 President must retain his constitutional discretion to decide
 whether prior notice,  in certain exceptional circumstances,  is
 not appropriate.
 Since the current legislation was adopted in 1980, of
 course, the President has provided prior notice of covert
 operations in virtually every case.   Moreover, in acting to
 implement the recommendations of the Tower Board, the President
 recently reaffirmed his commitment to the current statutory
 scheme of notification.   See the text of National Security

 Chapter 13
 The Need To Patch Leaks
 Throughout the majority report, much is made of the
 Administration's concern for secrecy. That concern is
 portrayed almost exclusively, if not exclusively, as the
 desire of some lawbreakers to cover the tracks of
 their misdeeds. We agree that the National Security
 Council staff. under Admiral Poindexter, let its con-
 cern over secrecy go too far. We should not be so
 deceived by self-righteousness, however. that we dis-
 miss the Admiral's concern as if it had no serious
 basis. Our national security, like it or not, does
 depend on many occasions on our ability to protect
 secrets. It is easy to dismiss the specific Iran arms
 sales decisions about executive branch compartmenta-
 lization.  and  about  withholding  information  from
 Congress for almost a year, as having been excessive.
 Everyone on these Committees would agree with that
 conclusion. But unless we can understand the real
 problems that led the NSC staff to its decision. future
 Administrations will once again be faced with an un-
 palatable choice between excessive secrecy, risking
 disclosure or foregoing what might be a worthwhile
 operation.
 Time after time over the past several years, ex-
 tremely sensitive classified information has been revealed in the media. Predictably, both Congress and'
 the Administration have blamed each other. In fact.
 both are culpable. It is important for these Commit-
 tees to recognize this truth forthrightly. As Secretary
 Shultz said, quoting Bryce Harlow, "trust is the coin
 of the realm." i But trust has to be mutual. Some
 people on these Committees seem towant to bring
 criminal prosecutions against former Administration
 officials for not speaking candidly to Congress. it is
 true that the business of government requires the Ad-
 ministration to be considered trustworthy by Con-
 gress. But so too must Congress prove itself trustwor.
 thy to the Administration.
 We do not mean, by our focus on congressional
 leaks, to suggest that we turn our eyes from the same
 problem in the executive branch. Executive branch
 leaks are every bit as serious as legislative branch
 ones. But as long as there is a consensus on this point,
 we do not feel a need to dwell on it here. At the end
 of this chapter, we will recommend legislation to help
 address the issue of executive branch leaks al ong with
 There is much less consensus in Congress. however.
 about leaks from the legislative branch. Those prob-
 lems are real. As Representative Hyde wrote in a
 recent article. the fact that the executive branch leaks
 more, does little to get Congress off the hook.
 Proven  Congressional  transgressions  admittedly
 are relatively rare. but so are proven executive-
 branch leaks. In truth. only a handful of leaks
 ever have been definitively traced to their source.
 so lack of proof establishes nothing. A partial
 Senate  Intelligence   Committee  study     often
 quoted by Mr. Beilenson reportedly found that
 journalists referenced congressional sources only
 8-9 percent of the time, but cited Reagan Admin-
 istration officials 66 percent of the time. Report-
 ers may not be entirely candid about their
 sources. But generously assuming that Congress
 has 2.500 people with clearances as opposed to
 2.2 million in the executive branch and the mili-
 tary, reliance on the Senate study forces us to
 conclude that Congress maintains just over 0.1
 percent the number of executive branch clear-
 ances. but is responsible for 8-9 percent of the
 leaks on national security issues. Specifically. on
 average, a cleared person in Congress is 60 times
 more likely than his counterparts to engage in
 unauthorized disclosures.'
 We believe that these problems-rather than a desire
 to cover up a supposed lawlessness whose existence
 we do not concede-contributed significantly to the
 Administration's posture in 1985-86.
 Protecting Secrecy in the Early
 Congress
 To put the issue in perspective, it is worthwhile to
 consider how the country's Founders dealt with the
 problem. Those hardheaded realists understood that
 breaches of security during that perilous revolution.
 ary period could mean the difference between life and
 death.  Consequently,  only five members of the
 Second Continental Congress sat on the Committee of
 Secret Correspondence, the foreign inteniiemw. Ai--

 chapter.                                               made public.
 The Continental Congress was especially careful
 about protecting sources and methods. For example.
 the names of those employed by the Secret Corre-
 spondence Committee were kept secret. as were the
 names of those with whom it corresponded. Even
 then, there was concern about Congress keeping a
 secret. As a result, when the Committee learned that
 France would covertly supply arms, munitions and
 money to the revolution. Ben Franklin and another
 Committee member. Robert Morris. stated: "We agree
 in opinion that it is our indispensable duty to keep it a
 secret, even from Congress.     . We find. by fatal
 experience, the Congress consists of too many mem-
 bers to keep secrets.-
 To underscore the importance of protecting sensi-
 tive information, the Continental Congress on No-
 vember 9. 1775. adopted the following oath of secre-
 cy which should still be in effect today:
 Resolved That every member of this Congress
 considers himself under the ties of virtue. honour
 and love of his country, not to divulge, directly
 or indirectly, any matter or thing agitated or
 debated in Congress before the same shall have
 been determined, without the leave of the Con-
 gress. nor any matter or thing determined in
 Congress. which a majority of the Congress shall
 order to be kept secret. And that if any member
 shall violate this agreement, he shall be expelled
 this Congress, and deemed an enemy to the liber-
 ties of America. and liable to be treated as such.
 and that every member signify his consent to this
 agreement by signing the same.3
 This oath was not taken lightly and no less a revo-
 lutionary figure than Thomas Paine, the author of
 "Common Sense," was fired as an employee of the
 Continental Congress for disclosing information re-
 garding France's covert assistance to the American
 Revolution. Interestingly, Congress then resorted to
 its own covert action and passed a blatantly false
 resolution repudiating Paine's disclosure,  Obviously,
 the Founding Fathers realized that there are some
 circumstances when a well-intentioned "noble lie." as
 Plato put it, is a necessary alternative to the harsh
 consequences of the truth. They also believed in pun-
 ishing leakers, a practice their modern counterparts in
 both the executive and legislative branches need to
 emulate more consistently.
 Let us move forward in history now, to the early
 years- of the Constitution. President Washington
 learned quickly that once information is shared with
 Congress, it is up to Congress-often the opposition

 public during any  debate concerning material  -
 sent to the House by the President "in confi-

 they changed this rule to allow the majority to
 vote for public debate on confidential communi-
 cations on an ad hoc basis. Soon thereafter, the
 House voted to lift an injunction of secrecy they
 had placed on some letters sent by the President
 "in confidence." A similar rebellion of sorts took
 place in the Senate after the Jay Treaty was
 conditionally ratified. The President wanted the
 treaty kept secret until all negotiations were com-
 plete. The Senate voted. however, to rescind its
 injunction of secrecy. although it continued to

 make the treaty public, the Republican Aurora
 beat it to the punch by printing an abstract of the
 terms.a
 Some things never change and as we celebrate our
 constitution's bicentennial. Congress is still prone to
 unauthorized  and sometimes damaging disclosures.
 The worst period in recent history was during the
 1970s. when the legitimacy of the CIA and covert
 operations were under attack. What follows are some
 examples of alleged congressional leaks during that
 period. Rather than rely on classified material, we
 have chosen here to protect still secret information by
 relying on accounts from secondary sources. The in-
 clusion of this material is not. meant to confirm or
 deny the veracity of the specific disclosures alleged.
 We begin with a 1972 example from Arthur Maass'
 book, Congress and the Common Good.
 On April 25, 1972, Senator Mike Gravel (D. AK)
 asked unanimous consent to insert in the Congres-
 sional Record excerpts from a top-secret National
 Security memorandum. The 500-page document
 concerning policy options in the Vietnam War
 had been prepared for Richard Nixon in 1969 by
 the National Security Council staff under Henry-
 A. Kissinger. The senator's normally routine re-
 quest was blocked temporarily by minority -whip
 Robert P. Griffin (R. MI). The Senate met on
 May 2 and 4 in closed executive sessions to con-
 sider Gravel's request, but no decision was

 reached. Then on May 9, Gravel, without ad-
 vance notice, read into the Record. during debate
 on the annual  State Department authorization
 bill. excerpts from the memorandum dealing with
 proposals to mine North Vietnamese ports, an
 action that had been announced by the President
 on the previous day. Senator Griffin. who en-
 tered the chamber during Gravel's statement.
 criticized him for acting before the Senate had
 disposed of the question. The Senator responded:
 "I have an obligation to the American people
 . to let the American people have the infor-
 mation that he [Richard Nixon] has."
 Congressman Ron V. Dellums (D.CA) then ob.
 tained from Gravel a copy of the full document
 which he placed in the Congressional Record on
 May 11. by simply asking unanimous consent to
 extend his remarks in the Record without giving
 any hint of their contents."
 Maass' book followed this example with two others
 from the committees that investigated the CIA.
 In January 1976, the House Intelligence Commit-
 tee, under Chairman Otis G. Pike ID. NY) sought
 to make public a report containing information
 that the White House considered to be top secret.
 The House intervened, voting 246 to 124 to block
 the committee from releasing its report until the
 President certified that it did not contain informa-
 tion that would adversely affect the nation's intel-
 ligence activities. Whereupon Daniel Schorr of
 CBS News. having obtained a copy of the report
 presumably from a  House member or staffer.
 gave it to the Village Voice, which published it.
 thereby frustrating an overwhelming majority of
 the  House.  Schorr was subsequently  fired  by
 CBS and became a cult hero on the college lec-
 ture circuit, commanding top fees for one-night
 stands.
 . . . The Senate Intelligence Committee chair-
 man, Frank Church (D. ID), went to the full
 Senate in November 1975 for approval of release
 of the committee's report on CIA involvement in
 assassination attempts against foreign leaders. The
 report included secret information that the Presi-
 dent believed should not be made public. The
 Senate met in executive session, that is, secret
 session, and when considerable opposition to re-
 lease of the report developed, more opposition
 than Church had anticipated, he and the Demo-
 cratic majority adjourned the session without a
 vote, and the committee released the report on its
 own authority.7
 It is clear that leaks during this period were often
 motivated by an animus toward the CIA's mission in
 general or as a way of killing individual operations.
 The same Daniel Schorr who leaked the Pentagon
 Papers to the Village Voice wrote about leaks in a 1985
 Washingrort Post article. "The late Rep. Leo Rvan,"
 Schorr wrote. "told me  in 1975) that he would con-
 done such a leak if it was the only way to block an ill
 conceived operation." s In fact. wrote former Direc-
 tor of Central Intelligence William Colby, "every
 new project subjected to this procedure [informing
 eight  congressional  committees]  leaked.  and  the
 'covert' part of CIA's covert action seemed almost
 gone." "
 The Still Leaky Congress During
 the Reagan Years
 By the late 1970s, the House and Senate had formed
 intelligence committees, reducing the number of com-
 mittees to which intelligence agencies had to report.
 That clearly improved the situation, but it did not
 cure  all  problems.  Senator Joseph  Biden.  then a
 member of the Select Committee on  Intelligence.
 sounded a bit like the late Leo Rvan in a 1986 Brit
 Hume article from The New Republic. Biden reported-
 ly said he had "twice threatened to go public with
 covert action plans by the Reagan administration that
 were harebrained." ti
 In 1984, according to an article by Robert Cald-
 well. CIA officials briefed the same Senate Select
 Committee on Intelligence about information indicat-
 ing that the Government of India was considering a
 preemptive strike against Pakistan's nuclear facility.
 When word of the briefing leaked, the operation was
 halted. According to Caldwell, the leak showed India
 that it had a security breach at a high level. The
 breach was discovered and a French intelligence ring
 was put out of business."
 The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was
 one of the bodies to which the President would have
 had to report the Iran arms sales. Of course the Presi-
 dent could have limited the report to the committee
 chairmen and ranking minority members as well as
 the party leaders.of the House of Representatives and
 Senate. The problem with this scenario is that some
 senior members of the committee have been suspected
 of leaking, as was discussed in the Committees' hear-
 ings. 12 The House committee has also been the source
 of some  damaging  disclosures.  Bob  Woodward's
 book, Vei4 describes one incident that allegedly hap-
 pened after members of the committee had sent a
 secret letter to President Reagan to protest an oper-
 ation about which Director Casey had just briefed
 them.
 Representative Clement J. Zablocki, the chair-
 man of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and
 a member of the House Intelligence Committee,
 had reviewed the ... finding and the letter to
 Reagan. The sixty-nine-year-old lawmaker leaked

 bers, tipping them that he had been a source for
 Newsweek He was set straight, but the House
 Intelligence   Committee   chairman,   Edward
 Boland, decided to take no action against Za-
 blocki. since leaks were epidemic."
 Complaints and investigations about subsequent inci-
 dents involving the House committee so far remain at
 the informal stage.
 To complete this picture of the world about which
 Poindexter had to make judgments: on November 3,
 1985-in the weeks just before the November arms
 transaction-a Washington Post article by Bob Wood-
 ward broke a story about a "CIA Anti-Qadhafi Plan
 Backed."" Director Casey responded to this article
 with a blistering letter to the President about execu-
 tive and legislative branch leaks. The Washingtonian
 magazine. accurately in our view, linked the atmos-
 phere in the White House immediately after this leak
 to the decision not to notify Congress about the Iran
 arms sale."
 It may be that not all these reported details about
 named Members of Congress are true. True or not,
 they fit in with a real pattern. As such, they form part
 of the background Director Casey and Admiral Poin-
 topple Qaddafi ....
 Newsweek reporters went back to House Foreign
 Affairs Chairman Zablocki after the Libya plan
 was denied. Zablocki went to House staff mem-
 to Newsweek that the letter to Reagan about the      street. and each end of Pennsylvania Avenue had
 yet unnamed operation in Africa was a plan to good reasons to doubt the other.
 the slightest misstep might get the hostages killed.
 Certainly, such threats against the hostages lives have
 been a part of the hostage takers' media events, and
 Kilburn's death was real. Given the track record, no
 one in Congress or the executive branch can afford to
 be smug about these concerns. Trust is a two-way
 Past leaks contributed to decisions that in turn led to
 these investigations. The leaks did not stop, however.
 when the committees started to work. The Commit-
 tees began with every good intention. Recognizing
 that it was dealing with highly sensitive information.
 the leadership made a concerted effort to prevent
 leaks. The complexity and short time frame of the
 probe. however, led to a decision not to compartmen-
 talize sensitive information. Consequently, everyone
 on the joint staff of some 165 people had multi-com-
 partmented clearances and access to the highest levels
 of classified material. The same access held true, of
 course. for the 26 members of the two Select Com-
 mittees. Given the number of people with access to
 these secrets. it is surprising there were not more
 revelations.
 We are reluctant to identify leaks with too much
 precision. because confirmation may help adversaries
 sort out the ones we consider harmful. Suffice it to
 say that the types of leaks included misleading the
 media on the nature of a witness' secret testimony
 several days before he appeared as a public witness as
 well as revealing intelligence collection methods, the
 identities of undercover personnel, and the names of a
 number of countries which, in one way or another,
 were trying circumspectly to be helpful to the United
 causing these and other countries to have serious res-
 ervations about future cooperation with the United
 States. That turn of events should give us real pause.
 This is a highly interdependent world. It no longer is
 possible for the United States to go it alone. whether
 to combat terrorism or contain Soviet/Cuban expan-
 sionism in Central America.
 Consider one example. On Friday, May 29, the
 Committees took testimony in closed executive ses-
 sion from "Tomas Castillo," the former CIA station
 chief in a Central American country. At the end of
 Castillo's testimony, the following colloquy took
 place:

 better served had we decided to take more testimony
 in closed session. Potentially damaging slips of the
 tongue could then have been redacted before a tran-
 script was made available to the public.
 As a consequence of this probe. and that of Judge
 Walsh. this nation's intelligence community could be
 facing the same situation it confronted more than a
 decade ago after the Church and Pike Committees
 investigations. Leaks from those inquiries seriously de-
 bilitated our overall intelligence capabilities and it
 took us over a decade to repair the damage. A rerun
 of that sorry chapter would have grave national   cu-
 rity implications, coming on the heels of a series of
 very  damaging  spy  scandals  epitomized  by     the
 Walker family case.
 What happened to Castillo's testimony, which was
 open to all Committee members and many staff. con-
 trasts sharply with the executive session deposition of
 Admiral Poindexter on May 2. 1987. The two select
 Committees recognized that the Admiral's testimony
 on the diversion of funds was the pivotal. and poten-
 tially most explosive political question of this whole
 investigation. As a result. extraordinary steps were
 taken to protect the information. Specifically. only
 three staff attorneys and no Members of either Com-
 mittee participated in the secret questioning. The suc-
 cess of these procedures speaks volumes on how to
 protect secrets.  In the final analysis, as Chairman
 Hamilton noted in a perceptive article on protecting
 secrets that appeared in the September 4, 1985 Con-
 gressional Record. "Leaks are inevitable when so many
 people handle secrets."ir The most effective way of
 ensuring secrecy is to restrict access to sensitive infor-
 mation to just a handful of responsible people.

 RESERVE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES
 Notification  of  Covert  operations
 WHEREAS, the responsibility for the conduct of foreign rela-

 in the Executive by the Constitution and has rested with the
 President since the founding of the nation; and
 WHEREAS, the current statutory framework governing the
 management of covert actions within the Executive Branch is
 working well and only very rarely has the Executive failed to
 notify the Congress of covert operations within 48 hours; and
 WHEREAS,  because there is a worldwide perception that
 sensitive information is not safe with those not directly involved
 with a covert activity, congressional-.notification could
 discourage foreign cooperation; and
 WHEREAS,  in reacting to what the Congress concluded in its
 investigation of the Iran-Contra Affair was "the failure of indi-
 viduals to observe the law, not:from deficiencies in existing
 law or in our. system of governance", the Congress now proposes
 legislation which would require the President, in every case, to
 notify Congress within 48.hours of covert operations; and
 WHEREAS, this legislation could preclude the President from
 acting in the national interest and place the United States at a
 potential disadvantage in responding to situations which  may
 threaten our national security; and
 WHEREAS, opposition to the 48-hour provision is bipartisan
 and includes nearly every former national security advisor and
 senior national security official of past administration; and
 NOW,  THEREFORE,  BE IT RESOLVED that the Reserve Officers
 Association of the United States, chartered by Congress, urge the
 Congress not to impose a mandatory requirement for the President

 The Congress is considering legislation that, without excep-
 tion, would require the President to inform the Congress of any
 and all covert operations within 48 hours.
 The responsibility for the conduct of foreign relations and
 for ensuring national security is vested in the Executive by the
 Constitution.   The current statutory framework governing the
 management of covert actions within the Executive Branch is
 working well and only very rarely has the Executive failed to
 notify the Congress of covert operations within 48 hours.   The
 Congress concluded in its investigation that the Iran-Contra
 Affair was "the failure of individuals to observe the law, not
 from deficiencies in existing law or in our system of
 governance."
 The requirement to notify the Congress of every covert action
 within 48 hours is an overreaction-to the actions of zealous
 individuals which may or may not have been precluded by law.   More
 importantly, there probably have been and conceivably could be
 rare instances when, because of sensitivity, time or communication
 restraints, the requirement to notify anyone outside the Executive
 Branch could jeopardize a covert operation.   The
 legislation could preclude the President from acting in the
 national interest and place the United States at a potential
 disadvantage in responding to situations which threaten our
 national security. .
 In March the Senate adopted S.  1721, a measure which includes
 the 48-hour provision, by a large margin.,  The House Foreign
 Affairs Committee approved a similar bill  (H.R.  3822) the week of
 20 June by a 22-17 vote.   House approval is anticipated, but the
 narrower House margin suggests that opponents of the bill are
 being heard.   The President has promised to veto the bill, and
 opponents believe a veto can be sustained by the House.
 The integrity of Congress or the security of the informa-
 tion is not an issue here,                   but as long as there is a widely held
 perception that sensitive information is not always safe with
 those not directly involved with a covert activity, the require-
 ment to notify the Congress can preclude necessary cooperation of
 those whose identities must remain secret.
 Opposition to the 48-hour provision is bipartisan and
 includes nearly every former national security advisor and senior
 security official of past administrations.

 At its National Convention in Las Vegas, ROA unanimously
 adopted a resolution opposing a requirement for the President to
 notify the Congress of all covert operations within 48 hours.   In
 giving the Executive the responsibility for national security, the
 Constitution provides flexibility.   ROA urges the Congress.not to
 take away needed flexibility by a-48-hour. notification require-

 ACTION FUND
 Honorable Dante Fascell
 Chairman
 House Committee on Foreign Affairs
 2170 Rayburn
 Washington, D.C. 20515
 Dear Chairman Fascell,
 I am writing to you on behalf of the People for the American
 Way Action Fund, a 270,000-member nonpartisan consitutional
 liberties organization. I also write as one who served on the
 Foreign Affairs Committee for 14 years.
 On Tuesday, June 21,  1988,  the Foreign Affairs Committee
 will conduct its mark-up of H.R. 3822, the "Intelligence
 Oversight Act of 1988." I testified before the House Intelligence
 Committee in support of the bill, and the People for the American
 Way Action Fund strongly urges you to support H.R. 3822.
 Enclosed you will find a short memorandum which explains why
 the "Intelligence Oversight Act of 1988" is an essential piece of
 legislation, a statutory reform mandated not only by the Iran-
 contra affair, but also by the rightful role of congressional
 oversight in our constitutional government. In addition, our
 memorandum addresses the weakness of the administration's
 National Security Council directive on covert action as a long-
 term solution to the problem of strengthening congressional
 oversight of intelligence activities. Lastly, we have outlined
 the unconstitutional nature of a proposed amendment to the bill
 which would create criminal penalities, a new felony, against
 Members of Congress and their staff for disclosing classified
 information received pursuant to intelligence oversight.
 We also ask that you oppose amendments which will weaken the
 bill, in particular one which creates criminal penalties against
 Members of Congress and their staff for disclosing information
 received pursuant to intelligence oversight. We have enclosed a
 summary legal analysis prepared by the Washington, D.C. law firm
 of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering which concludes that such an
 amendment would violate the Constitution.

 We will also be sending you a copy of the complete analysis.
 Although the objective of safeguarding sensitive national
 security information is important and legitimate, under our
 Constitutional framework it is both necessary and possible to
 attain that objective through means other than the amendment to
 be proposed. We recommend that the Congress hold hearings on the
 subject of safeguarding against disclosures in both the Congress
 and the Executive Branch.
 My sixteen years as a Member of Congress has led me to
 certain personal convictions about the institutional
 responsibilities of the Congress in our constitutional form of
 government. Congressional oversight of the intelligence
 community, particularly "special" or covert activities, is
 central to the legitimate foreign policy and national security
 role of Congress. This goes beyond the fundamental oversight role
 of Congress in authorization, appropriations, and execution of
 government programs and policies. The Constitution gives both the
 Congress and the Executive specific foreign policy powers. It
 does not make foreign policy the exclusive domain of one branch
 of government. The result is a system of checks and balances
 which ensures that our nation's foreign policy and national
 security framework is consistent with the policy, law, and
 interests of our nation.
 On behalf of the People for the American Way Action Fund, I
 urge you to support H.R.,3822, the Intelligence Oversight Act of
 1988."  Recently the Senate, in a strong show of bipartisan
 support, passed its version of the bill by a vote of 71-19. We
 believe that H.R. 3822 deserves.the support of the Foreign
 Affairs Committee, the entire Congress, and of the president.

 ACTION FUND
 MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF H.R.          3822,  -THE INTELLIGENCE
 OVERSIGHT ACT OF 1988,? AND IN OPPOSITION TO AN AMENDMENT TO
 CRIMINALIZE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
 AND THEIR AIDES
 I.     A. STATUTORY SOLUTION FOR INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT VERSUS A -
 ,.SECRET DIRECTIVE.
 The administration and the Congress both have proposed ways
 to change the current system of intelligence oversight. One will
 result in more effective oversight, the other in less.
 The administration doesn't want the law changed and has
 promised that President Reagan will veto legislation to this
 effect. Instead, President Reagan has issued a secret directive
 through the National Security Council that he says will prevent
 future covert action scandals.  The directive,  "NSDD 296" is just
 one'in a series called National Security Decision Directives
 (NSDDS)  created by President Reagan.  He has issued almost 300
 NSDDS.
 However,?to ensure that covert actions are conducted in
 accordance with established law and policy, Congress through its
 select intelligence committees, must know what the
 administration's policies are and how they are being carried out.
 Covert actions must, by definition, remain secret. This is all
 the more reason such actions should be conducted according to a
 public statute, not a secret directive.
 NSDDs are by nature.a particularly poor substitute for a
 change in law because they are:  (1)  "Born classified," and unlike
 other presidential instruments such as executive orders, they are
 not published in any register.  (2) Only revealed to Congress
 under irregular, arbitrary, or accidental circumstances. Even the
 Intelligence Committees do not receive copies of NSDDS when they
 are issued.
 The uncertain legal character of NSDDs make them poor
 long-term solutions:  (1) Each president can change or abolish the
 national security directives of previous presidents.  (2) The
 president's "solution" on covert action could evaporate in less
 than a year. It could also be amended by another NSDD about which
 Congress might not be notified.

 H.R. 3822, the "Intelligence Oversight Act of 1988" is
 preferable in both form and substance to the president's
 directive NSDD 286. The bill deserves the support of the Foreign
 Affairs Committee, the entire Congress, and of the president.
 A. The bill responds to the recommendations of the Iran-
 Contra Committee. It ensures that our system of checks and
 balances is operating smoothly: It emphasizes the responsibility
 of elected officials -- the president and Congress -- for actions
 of un-elected officials like Lt. Col. North and Admiral
 Poindexter.
 B. The bill creates clear standards of accountability and
 communication for the Executive Branch and Congress. The aspect
 of the bill that has attracted the most attention is the so-
 called "48-hour" rule. This requires that the president notify
 the House and Senate Intelligence Committees in advance of all
 covert operations, except, as the bill clearly states "on rare
 occasions when time is of the essence." In such cases, the
 president must still inform the two committees about the
 operation, but no later that 48 hours after its authorization by
 the president. The 48-hour rule is essential to close the
 loophole that the Reagan administration used to conduct the Iran-
 contra operation. The rule would added needed objectivity to the
 standard by which the Executive Branch is guided in notification.
 In addition the notification is limited to the eight most trusted
 elected officials in.Congress.
 C. The bill does not allow Congress to usurp presidential
 power by controlling covert operations. The House bill puts into
 law a specific definition of covert activities and gives the
 president sole responsibility for carrying them out. Congress
 can't veto a covert operation or otherwise override the
 president's decision, except through the power of the purse,
 which it has always had. The only presidential power that is
 limited by the legislation is the president's power to deny
 Congress information that in our democracy it is entitled to
 have.
 III. THE AMENDMENT TO CRIMINALIZE "LEAKS" BY MEMBERS OF
 CONGRESS AND THEIR AIDES
 Opponents of H.R. 3822 will likely propose an amendment at
 the Foreign Affairs Committee mark-up which would impose criminal
 liability on Members of Congress and their aides for disclosures
 of classified information supplied to them pursuant to

 intelligence oversight law. Although the objective of
 safeguarding. sensitive national security secrets is,important and
 legitimate, under our Constitutional framework it is both
 necessary and possible to attain that objective through means
 other than this proposed amendment.
 The amendment was first offered. by Representative Robert.
 Livingston (R-LA) in the-House Intelligence Committee where it
 failed to win support.- Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL) a member
 of both the Intelligence and. Foreign Affairs Committees is
 expected to propose the amendment again on Tuesday.
 The amendment offered by Rep. Livingston reads as follows:`
 Sec. 506. "Any person who, having received classified
 information pursuant to the provisions of this title,
 knowingly and willfully discloses the substance of that
 informationwithout the authorization of the President,
 unless pursuant to the applicable'rules of.the House of
 Congress of which that person is a Member, officer or
 employee, shall be fined not less than $1000 nor more
 than $20,000 or imprisoned for not less than ninety-
 days nor more than five years, or both."
 The People for the American Way:Action Fund-has asked-the
 Washington, D.C. law firm of Wilmer,?-:Cutler, and Pickering to
 prepare a legal analysis of the proposed amendment.   The analysis
 concludes that the proposed amendment, and thus its counterpart
 to be offered in the Foreign Affairs Committee,, appears to.
 violate the United States Constitution in several respects. A
 summary, and a copy of the memorandum are attached.
 A.     Separation of Powers
 The amendment raises serious questions under the doctrine of
 separation of powers. The amendment empowers the Executive branch
 to interfere with the constitutional functions of Congress in
 several ways:                                -                                "
 *      Creating a criminal statute targeted exclusively at the
 Legislative Branch and its Members.
 *      Requiring Presidential authorization of disclosures,
 effectively allows the Executive Branch to define what
 acts by Members and their aides are criminal.
 *      Incorporation of the Executive Branch's classification
 system effectively allows the Executive Branch to
 control the information which Members and their aides
 may use to debate and discuss issues within the
 legitimate national security and foreign policy
 jurisdiction of Congress.

 :h: amendment appears to violate the Speech and Debate
 Clausf the Constitution because it would reach a wide range of
 disclosures that occur within the sphere of legislative activity.
 The following acts could be characterized as conveying
 "classified" information to anyone -- even other Members of
 Congress or their own aides --
 Speeches or debates on the floor of the House or Senate
 or during a committee or subcommittee proceeding.
 *      The introduction of legislation, such as a bill or
 resolution proclaiming that a particular intelligence
 activity is illegal.
 *      The preparation, drafting, and publishing of Committee
 reports.
 *      Private discussions among Members who are n2t both
 members of the intelligence committees, such as
 discussions about the wisdom of particular covert
 action.
 *      Inquiries by a Member to an Executive Branch official
 about an intelligence activity, even if the recipient
 is "cleared" to receive classified information of the
 sort being conveyed.
 *      Private discussions between professional staff persons,
 unless both are members of an intelligence committee
 staff.
 C.     The First Amendment
 The proposed nondisclosure amendment would appear to violate
 the First Amendment rights of Members and their aides for reasons
 of "overbreadth" and "vagueness."
 Overbreadth. First, the amendment would have a detrimental
 chilling effect upon their communications among themselves with
 their constituents and the public about important matters of
 national policy. Second, the amendment is overly broad because
 the Executive Branch classifies a huge quantity of information
 that is not sensitive from a national security standpoint. Thus,
 the amendment's incorporation of the classification system as the
 standard for criminal liability would prohibit the disclosure of
 a substantial amount of communication that cannot be prohibited
 under the First Amendment.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/08/10 :
 CIA-RDP91 B00389R000400720002-7
 Vagueness. In purporting to criminalize disclosures of  the
 substance" of.classified information, the proposed amendment
 appears to contravene the First Amendment. Documents and
 briefings that are generally denominated as "classified"
 frequently convey a great deal of information which in fact is
 not classified, but which is not specifically designated as such.
 Thus the line between what is classified and what is not is often
 unclear. The proposed criminal provision appears to be
 impermissibly vague and would improperly chill the disclosure of
 information that is not classified.
 Although the objective of safeguard sensitive national
 security information is important and legitimate, under our
 Constitutional framework it is both necessary and possible to
 attain that objective through means other.,.than this proposed.
 amendment. The People for the American Way. Action Fund strongly
 recommends that the Congress hold hearings about the need for
 safeguards against disclosures of sensitive national security
 information by both the Executive Branch and the Congress.
 The People for the American Way Action Fund urges you to
 support H.R. 3822, the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1988."
 Recently the Senate, in a strong show of bipartisan support,
 passed its version of the bill by a vote of 71-19. We believe
 that H.R. 3822 deserves the support of the Foreign Affairs
 Committee, the entire Congress, and of the president."We also
 urge you to oppose amendments which will weaken the bill,
 particularly the proposed amendment to create criminal penalties
 against Members of Congress and their aides for disclosing
 sensitive information obtained during the intelligence oversight
 process. We strongly recommend that Congress hold hearings on the
 need for safeguards against such disclosures by the Executive
 Branch and the Congress.

 FORUM
 7-A
 By LOUIS STOKES
 The public outrage over the
 Iran-contra  affair  showed
 that citizens want their gov-
 ernment to operate in the sunlight,
 not the dark The current system,
 which allowed the White House to
 string Congress along while it ran
 an Illegal covert operation, most be
 changed. The administration and
 the Congress both have proposed
 ways to do so. One will result in
 more effective oversight, the other
 its lase.
 The administration doesn't want
 the law changed and has warned
 that President Reagan will veto
 legislation to this effect Instead.
 President Reagan has issued a
 secret presidential directive
 through the National Security
 Council that he says will prevent
 future covert action scandals. The
 directive is just one in a series
 called Notional Security Decision
 Directives (NSDDS) created by
 President Reagan. He has issued
 almost 300 NSDDS. You are not
 alone if you haven't heard of them;
 neither have most members of Con-
 gre66.
 The president's effort misses the
 point: To ensure that covert actions
 are conducted in accordance with
 established law and policy, the
 president must be held account-
 able, and Congreea, through its
 Keeping covert action within the law
 select intelligence comfttees. most
 know what the administration's
 policies are and how they are
 being carried out. Covert actions
 must, by definition, remain secret.
 This is all the more reason such
 actions  should  be  conducted
 according to a public statute, not a
 secret directive.
 The very nature of NSDDS shows
 that they are a particularly poor
 substitute for a change in law.
 NSDDS are "born classified," and
 unlike other presidential instru-
 ments such as executive orders,
 they are not published in any regis-
 ter. They are only revealed to Con-
 gress under irregular, arbitrary, or
 accidental circumstances.
 The secret nature of NSDDS also
 makes them vulnerable to abuse.
 For example. NSDD 159, which
 was to set the rules for covert oper-
 ations, required agencies outside
 the CIA to obtain a presidential
 "finding" before they could under-
 take  covert  action.  But  two
 National Security Advisors, as we
 know all too well, failed to comply.
 Moreover, the uncertain legal
 character of NSDDS make them
 poor long-term  solutions. Each
 president can change or abolish

 the national security directives or
 previous presidents. So President
 Reagan's  "solution"  on  covert
 action could evaporate in less than
 a year.
 During    the  recent   hearings
 before the Houvc Intelligence Com-
 mittee. I found myself' in agree-
 ment with several witnesses who
 stressed that presidential direct-
 ives are not a legitimate substitute
 for a change in public law. John
 Buchanan. chairman of People for
 the American Way, put it suc-
 cinctly: "The bottom line is that
 NSDD's  cannot  be  a  solution
 because they are part of the prob-
 lem!"
 Congress has    offered another
 way to  prevent an  Iran-contra
 affair from occurring in the future.
 It is called the Intelligence Over-
 sight Act of 1988 and is preferable
 communication for the Executive
 Branch and Congress. The aspect
 of the bill that has attracted the
 most attention is the so-called
 "48-hour" role. This requires that
 the president notify the House and
 Senate Intelligence Committees in
 advance of all covert operations,
 except, as the bill clearly states,
 "on rare occasions when time is of
 the essence." In such cases, the
 president must still inform the two
 committees about the operation.
 but no later than 48 hours after its
 authorization by the president. The
 40-hour rule is essential to close
 the  loophole  that  the  Reagan
 administration used to conduct the
 Iran-contra operation.
 While the administration now
 seems willing to admit that the
 Iran-contra affair was a mistake, it
 opposes the House and Senate leg-
 islation. It claims that the bill
 would let Congress usurp presiden-
 tial power by controlling covert
 operations. This is misleading. The
 House bill puts into law a specific
 definition of covert activities and
 gives the president sole responsi-
 bility for carrying them out Con-
 gross can't veto a covert operation
 or otherwise override the presi-
 in both form and substance to the
 president's directive. Recently, the
 Senate. in a strong show of biparti-
 san support, passed its version of
 the bill by a vote of 7149. The
 House of Representatives will con-

 First, the bill responds to the
 recommendations of the Iran-con-

 system of checks and balances is
 operating smoothly. It emphasizes
 the responsibility of elected ofD-

 - for actions of un-elected officials
 like Lt. Col. North and Admiral

 The President's
 "Secret Laws"
 A window through which to view the problems of excessive secrecy is the series of
 directives termed the president's "secret laws" by Rep. Jack Brooks (D-TX), Chairman of
 the House Government Operations Committee. The concept of a "secret law" in America
 conflicts with every basic notion of democracy under the Constitution, and yet such laws
 exist. They are created by the president as national security directives and have been
 issued through the National Security Council (NSC) by each president since President
 Truman.1 In 1976, a special Senate committee studying presidential power concluded:
 In recent years, the National Security Action Memorandums of Presidents
 Kennedy and Johnson and the National Security Action Directives of
 President Nixon represent a new method for promulgating decisions, in
 areas of gravest importance. Such decisions are not specifically required
 by law to be published in any register, even in a classified form; none
 have prescribed formats or procedures; none of these vital Executive
 decisions are revealed to Congress or the public except under irregular,
 arbitrary, or accidental circumstances?
 President Reagan has designated these 'national security decision directives,"
 (NSDDs). He has used NSDDs to authorize an array of activities which included the
 Libyan disinformation campaign3 and the use of Presidential Findings by agencies other
 than the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), such as the NSC, to conduct covert
 operations 4 In 1987, the public learned that in 1983 President Reagan had authorized,
 through an NSDD, CIA training and support of secret counter terrorist squads in the
 Middle East to be used for 'preemptive strikes.'"

 GOVERNMENT SECRECY: DECISIONS WITHOUT DEMOCRACY
 As of June 24, 1987, President Reagan had signed, and issued at least 280 NSDDs
 ]Appendix A]. Today, as in years before, Congress remains uninformed about the issuance
 and content of these directives. No complete list of them is publicly available because
 the National Security Council claims that such a list of the president's NSDDs is
 classified. One public requester seeking unclassified information about an NSDD received
 the following response from the National Security Council: "The NSC has no publications
 program and, most of the information in our files is =classified and, therefore unavailable
 -to the public."6 These directives illustrate some of the -problems which exist on a much
 wider scale in the government secrecy system.
 NATIONAL SECURITY" CAN BE USED TO HIDE
 NATIONAL POLICYMAIQNG
 'National security' can be invoked to shroud many decisions concerning United States
 policy and activity, biding these from congressional and public view. In this regard,
 President Reagan defined the NSDDs which he issues through the National Security
 Council:
 This series shall be used to promulgate Presidential decisions
 implementing national policy and objectives in all areas involving
 national security.
 Indeed, NSDDs issued by President Reagan involve a variety of national policies
 for which responsibility is shared by Congress and which affect various existing statutes.
 An examination of approximately 50 NSDDs reveals their, application to many national
 policies: civil defense, world economic summits, telecommunications, commercial satellites
 and space vehicles, resettlement of Indochinese refugees in the United States, production
 and handling of nuclear materials, and terrorism.  Other NSDDs issued by President
 Reagan have involved measures affecting millions of the nation's civil servants and have
 been viewed as both extreme and unconstitutional approaches to government. These have
 included, for example; NSDDs requiring government employees to sign secrecy contracts,
 agree to lifetime. government censorship of any writing they seek to publish, and to
 undergo periodic lie-detector tests Y
 NSDDs that involve the United States militarily in other countries are especially
 worthy of scrutiny. They demonstrate unaccountable use of presidential. power and
 potentially damaging consequences for the nation. By secretly engaging our nation in
 military activity, the president jeopardizes - the essential support of Congress and the
 American public. Recent examples include U.S. operations in Nicaragua and, the
 surrounding region and military preparations for the invasion of Grenada.
 In July 1983, President Reagan issued NSDD 100, 'Enhanced U.S. Military Activity
 and Assistance for the Central American Region.' The president achieved three military
 goals with NSDD 100. U.S. military activity in Nicaragua, military training in El Salvador,
 and placing U.S. forces in the Caribbean three months before the October 1983 invasion

 of Grenada. In addition, the president required that the Secretary of Defense and the
 Secretary of State, without revealing the secret law or fully disclosing the
 administration's plans, persuade Congress and the public to support the administration's
 actions. President Reagan stated in NSDD 100:
 The increasing threat to U.S. national interests in Central America
 requires that we strengthen our diplomatic and security efforts in the
 region. The consolidation of a Marxist-Leninist regime in Nicaragua,
 committed to the export of violence and totalitarianism, poses a
 significant risk to the stability of Central America. Our ability to
 support democratic states in the region, and those on the path to
 democracy, must be visibly demonstrated by our military forces.
 A program of expanded U.S. military activities and exercises both in the
 Caribbean Basin and on the Pacific coast of Central America will
 commence as soon as possible.
 The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense will prepare a
 coordinated legislative, diplomatic, and public affairs strategy that
 supports these initiatives.10
 The Iran-contra scandal reflects the'serious consequences of secretly planned
 U.S. military involvement in which Congress and many government foreign policy
 professionals are kept ignorant of preparations. More importantly, it reveals the potential
 for secret development of U.S. foreign policy - one perhaps contradicting and
 superseding publicly proclaimed policy.
 SECRECY PROMOTES FUGMVE POLICYMAIGNG
 The problem worsens where such secret laws are fugitive instruments for policymaking,
 mobilizing executive branch personnel and federal resources in ways that conflict with
 national policy and may violate our laws.
 NSDDs that sustain covert activity abroad by the United States merit especially
 careful examination. While covert activity may be necessary in certain situations, it must
 be conducted in accordance with procedures for informing Congress and only as necessary
 to protect America's vital interests.
 The use of NSDDs for covert operations occurred very early in the Reagan
 administration, initiating what has been called the president's 'secret war" in
 Nicaragua 11 In November 1981, President Reagan, in response to a proposal by CIA
 Director William Casey, issued NSDD 17 establishing a $19 million CIA covert operation in
 Nicaragua and authorizing the CIA to recruit a force of 500, to be supplemented by at
 least 1,000 Nicaraguan rebels being trained in Argentina.P In 1987, reports indicated that
 NSDD 17 directed an estimated $50 million to Argentina to train Nicaraguan rebels.1

 The Iran-contra scandal demonstrated that covert operations are vulnerable to
 the abuse of authority, secret development of questionable American foreign policy, and
 misrepresentation of United States interests. Foremost among the instruments of secrecy
 authorizing these activities was a single NSDD issued by President Reagan. It contravened
 the president's own public policy on covert action, embodied in the president's executive
 order on covert action which explicitly limited -special activities" to the CIA.14 Nonethe-
 less, the National Security Council engaged in secret activities in the Middle East and
 Central America, and bypassed the required reporting of covert operations to Congress.
 National Security Decision Directive 159, entitled "Covert Action Policy Approval
 and Coordination Procedures" was issued by President Reagan on January 18, 1985
 [Appendix B]. It has two important components. First, President Reagan authorized
 agencies other than the CIA, such as the National Security Council, to undertake covert
 operations by virtue of a Presidential Finding. A Finding is a document signed by the
 president, required by law, granting intelligence agencies permission to undertake specific
 covert operations. Findings are required by law specifically so that covert activities are
 accountable through the president. Second, President Reagan exempted a broad range of
 covert activities by agencies other than the CIA from being labelled covert action. This
 provision functions as an escape clause because it eliminates the need for a covert action
 Finding, and eliminates the requirements for reporting to Congress.
 Specifically, NSDD 159 was central to White House arms-for-hostages transactions
 with Iran, allowing the National Security Council to mount a covert operation and
 directing that it be excluded from the law requiring that it be reported to Congress. The
 arms We to Iran was a radical departure from ongoing U.S. policy - an arms embargo
 had been in effect since the Shah was deposed by the Ayatollah Khomeni. In fact,
 Secretary of Defense Weinberger and Secretary of State Schultz opposed the secret law.
 Secretary Weinberger stopped a June 1985 attempt to issue an NSDD establishing
 essentially the same plan.13 Nonetheless, the "Covert Action Finding Regarding Iran" was
 signed by the president, prompting shipment to Iran of 4000 TOW antitank missiles, spare
 parts for radar systems purchased by the Shah and other military equipment. The CIA
 played an integral role, serving as a conduit for three shipments of more than 2000
 missiles in 1986.16 The new arms sale effort violated current prohibitions on such
 transactions set in U.S. foreign policy and the Arms Export Act.17
 The second application of NSDD 159 for fugitive U.S. policymaking was its use
 by Oliver North and others who did not want their covert activity in Central America to
 be reported to Congress. North and others interpreted the president's directive to mean
 that a Presidential Finding was not required. North's interpretation was based on an
 escape clause in NSDD 159, in which President Reagan states:
 However, the provision of routine support in the form of personnel,
 funds, equipment, supplies, transportation, training, logistics, and
 facilities by Government components other than the CIA to support a
 covert action shall not in itself be considered a separate covert action
 by the supplying agency.18

 GOVERNMENT SECRECY: DECISIONS WITHOUT DEMOCRACY
 Essentially everything the NSC and its 'enterprise did in Nicaragua can, be
 included in the above list of 'routine support' Relying on the above provision in NSDD
 159, the result, however, was that the NSC operation was not considered a covert
 .operation, Congress was uninformed, and the NSC's secret war in Nicaragua continued. It
 was only at a later date that- a veteran .CIA official, accustomed to the use and intent of
 Presidential Findings for accountability, of covert, operations, required that one be
 obtained from President Reagan. During the ban-contra bearings. in the summer of 1987,
 former National Security Advisor. John Poindexter claimed that he destroyed the only
 copy of the Finding ultimately obtained to authorize NSC operations in Central America.
 The NSC, however, continued to insist that it was not accountable. On July 13, 1987, the
 following exchange occurred between U.S. Senator George Mitchell (D-ME) and Oliver
 North:
 Senator Mitchell: Since the law requires that before any covert action
 could be conducted, the President must specifically authorize it, since
 you've testified that you conducted a covert operation, and since you've
 further testified that the President neither designated the. National
 Security Council to conduct. covert operations nor did he make a Finding
 authorizing this covert operation, what was the legal basis for your
 activities with respect to this covert operation?
 Oliver North: The National Security Council staff is not includedwithin
 the constraints that are depicted in either the executive order [on
 covert . operations] or the NSDD [159J . as an intelligence agency.. And
 thus, in neither case does the law provide that the president had to do
 what you are saying he had to do.18
 SECRECY DEFEATS THE CHECKS AND BALANCES SYSTEM
 The secret laws reflect the extent to which the president and the executive branch
 exercise unreviewable authority and. escape accountability. Regardless of the relationship
 of such directives to current policy, Congress has virtually no - knowledge of their
 issuance; even in the case of pertinent national - security matters, the appropriate
 committees of Congress are not informed.. Even specific requests from Congress, seeking
 to fulfill its intelligence oversight responsibilities under the law, have been ignored. by
 current and past administrations.19
 These points were underscored at a 1987 hearing of the House Government
 Operations Subcommittee. The chairman of the Oversight and Evaluation Subcommittee of
 the House Select Committee on-Intelligence, Congressman AnthonyBeilenson (D-CA):
 What I have to say about NSDDs, as they are -called, will be brief. It is  -
 based on an incomplete understanding of this form of Presidential
 decision. That is because-the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
 does not receive copies ofNSDDs.2

 The lack of congressional access to NSDDs creates special problems of accountability.
 Even when these laws are discovered and Congress, for example, calls for partial or
 complete revocation, the executive branch continues, undetected, to implement its original
 plans.
 The problem is put in perspective by the more conventional system of
 presidential proclamations and executive orders. These are issued according to. a
 numerical accounting system and by law must be published in the Federal Register and
 reproduced in the Code of Federal Regulations.2I Furthermore, while confidential or
 classified executive orders have been issued and not published, they are accounted for in
 the numbering system. Congress, particularly its intelligence committees, has been granted
 access to these records. This system is particularly_ useful to ensure that executive orders
 that have been rescinded are in fact "off the books.'
 Two recent examples illustrate that the same is not true with the NSDDs. Even
 when the president has promised to rescind a particular NSDD program, there is no way
 to monitor such action.
 National Security Decision Directive 84. NSDD 84, 'Safeguarding National Security
 Information,' was issued by President Reagan in 1983 as a major policy initiative of the
 administration to stop unlawful disclosures of classified information by government
 employees. Its requirements include a secrecy contract for certain government employees,
 possibly every Cabinet official, pledging lifetime government censorship of all writings.
 The directive was publicly revealed as a Department of Justice memorandum. U.N.
 Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick refused to sign her lifetime censorship contract, which was
 presented to her by the State Department as she prepared to leave her U.N. post 23
 Congress, government employees, and the public reacted negatively to the plan.
 On February 15, 1984, President Reagan agreed to suspend the lifetime
 censorship provision of NSDD 84 - but the practice in fact widened. Unknown to
 Congress, the Reagan administration had already been using a censorship contract
 developed by the CIA.24 NSDD 84 had merely revised this contract and extended its
 application throughout the government.
 President Reagan interpreted suspension of the censorship portion of NSDD 84 in
 the narrowest possible terms: refrain from using the revised censorship contract. The
 president then continued a widespread, program of censorship agreements using the
 original CIA contract. In September 1986, the General Accounting Office revealed several
 startling statistics resulting from a study that did not even include the Central
 Intelligence Agency or the National Security Agency: 11 agencies alone reported 290,000
 government workers had been required to sign the lifetime censorship contract because of
 access to intelligence information, and the policy continued in numerous agencies ranging
 from the Agency for `International Development to the Securities and_ Exchange

 GOVERNMENT SECRECY: DECISIONS WITHOUT DEMOCRACY
 Commiission.u The practice has also been extended to hundreds of government
 contractors and university research scientists who have received federal grants. Thus,
 executive branch practice has been a far ay from rescinding the censorship program.
 Moreover, Congress could not hold the president to? his word: NSDD 84, remains
 effectively intact today.
 National Security Decision Directive 145. NSDD 145, 'National Policy on
 Telecommunications and Automated Information Systems Security," was issued by
 President Reagan in 1984 to govern the security of telecommunications and computerized
 information systems. It set unprecedented restrictions on access to computerized
 information that is.not classified and is held not only by the federal government but also
 by private companies, libraries, and universities. Furthermore, the president gave the
 enforcement authority for the new policy to a highly. secretive military entity -- the
 National Security Agency.
 Public awareness of this directive, a very technical subject area, occurred almost
 by accident: the resignation of former White House National Security Advisor John
 Poindexter for his role in the Iran-contra scandal. Although the directive was known to
 a small number of exceptionally well-informed citizens, public awareness of NSDD 145
 heightened during the investigation of Poindexter's final days at the National Security
 Council. Among the orders and directives that drew attention was a Poindexter
 memorandum that was the Reagan administration's 'first attempt to implement NSDD
 145.26
 Congress; librarians, scientists, information companies, and concerned citizens
 reacted quickly and demanded withdrawal ?of the Poindexter memorandum. The reasons for
 concern were obvious: awesome reach beyond the government, its military authority, and
 questionable constitutionality. Congress also responded with legislation to address the
 legitimate needs for computer security, creating.more reasonable controls and supplanting
 NSDD 145.27
 In this case, the administration was eager to-disassociate itself from. Poindexter
 and withdrew the implementing memorandum on March 17,1987. While NSDD 145 appears
 to be dormant, strong evidence exists that another. implementing memorandum will be
 produced.
 National policymaking, fugitive policy instruments, and the lack of accountability
 for action authorized by the president are- troubling qualities of National Security
 Decision. Directives and presidential power. By using the. National Security Council to
 create unreviewed policies, the president has ignored our constitutional system of
 separation of powers and checks and balances. However, the use of such directives and
 the propensity for excessive secrecy is an. institutional problem. It is not unique to the
 Iran-contra affair or the Reagan administration, and it is not likely to disappear in 1988.

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF MEMORANDUM CONCERNING
 THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF A PROPOSED AMENDMENT
 TO H.R. 3822 WHICH WOULD CRIMINALIZE
 DISCLOSURES OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION BY
 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THEIR AIDES
 Set forth below is an Executive Summary of a memorandum
 being prepared by this Firm for People for the Amer-ican Way con-
 cerning the constitutionality of a proposed amendment to the
 Intelligence Oversight Act of 1988 (H.R. 3822) which would impose
 criminal liability on members of Congress and their aides for
 disclosures of classified information supplied pursuant to the
 statute, except as authorized by the President or the rules of
 the House or Senate.
 The proposed amendment to make it a crime for any Mem-
 ber or Congressional employee to disclose certain "classified"
 information without authorization of the President, unless pursu-
 ant to House or Senate rule, appears to violate the United States
 Constitution in several respects.   Although the objective of
 safeguarding sensitive national security secrets is important and
 legitimate, under our Constitutional framework it is both neces-
 sary and possible to attain that objective through means other

 First, the amendment raises serious questions under the
 doctrine of separation of powers.   As a criminal statute tar-
 getted exclusively at the Legislative Branch and its Members, the
 amendment empowers the Executive Branch to interfere in the con-
 stitutional functions of Congress.  The degree of inter-branch
 interference. that would be brought on by the amendment results
 from the amendment's targetting of the Legislative Branch,  its
 incorporation of the Executive Branch's classification system,
 and its provision for Presidential authorization of disclosures,
 which effectively confer upon the Executive Branch the authority
 to define what. acts by members and their staffs constitute a
 crime.
 Second, the amendment appears to violate the Speech and
 Debate=?..Clause of the constitution because it would reach a wide
 range of disclosures that occur within the sphere of legislative
 activity.   Thus, the amendment would improperly criminalize any
 act -- even speeches on the floor or during a committee session
 -- by a member which could be characterized as conveying "classi-
 fied" information to anyone -- even other Members of Congress or
 their staffs -- unless there is permission from the. President or
 compliance with House or Senate procedures.
 Third, the amendment would appear to violate the First
 Amendment rights of Members and their staffs, and would have a
 detrimental chilling effect upon their communications among

 themselves and with their constituents and the public about
 important matters of national policy.  To be sure,-the government
 has a legitimate interest, in safeguarding national security
 secrets.  However, notwithstanding remarks to the contrary by--
 former Executive Branch officials such as Oliver North and John
 Poindexter, it.has not been established that the existing frame-
 work of statutes and Congressional rules fails adequately to pro-
 tect this governmental interest.  Moreover, because the Executive
 Branch classifies a huge quantity of information that is not sen-
 sitive from a national security standpoint, the amendment's
 incorporation of the classification system as the standard for   a
 criminal liability appears to result in prohibiting the disclo-
 sure of a substantial amount of communication that cannot be pro-
 hibited under the First Amendment.
 Finally,  in purporting to criminalize disclosures of
 "the substance" of classified information, the proposed amendment
 appears to contravene the First Amendment because of the
 vagueness of the standard.   Documents and briefings that.,are
 generally denominated as "classified" frequently convey a great.
 deal of information which in fact,is.not classified but which is
 not specifically designated as. such.   Thus, the line between what
 is classified and what is not is often unclear.   The proposed
 criminal provision appears therefore to be impermissibly vague
 and would improperly chill the disclosure of information that is
 not classified.                                                             _

 This memorandum examines the constitutionality of a
 proposed statute that would impose criminal liability.on.Members

 disclosing "the substance" of any "classified information" that.
 has been provided to Congress pursuant to the Executive Branch's
 statutory duties to inform Congress of "all intelligence activi-

 A.    The Intelligence Oversight Act.
 The Intelligence Oversight Act of 1988, H.R. 3822,  is
 the centerpiece of the legislative response to the unlawful
 covert activities that comprised the Iran-Contra Affair.3'     The
 Act would repeal the Hughes-Ryan amendment of the Foreign Assis-
 tance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. S 2422) and amend Title V of the
 National Security Act of 1947 so as to consolidate and strengthen
 the statutory provisions that require the President and the. heads
 of agencies to keep Congress fully and timely informed of all
 intelligence activities,  including covert actions.   Among the key
 provisions of the bill is a requirement that the President give
 the intelligence committees!/ prior notice of all covert actions,
 or, when time is of the essence, notice as soon as possible but
 in no event later than 48 hours after the President has autho-

 B.           The Proposed Amendment Concerning
 Disclosure of Classified Information.
 On May 11, 1988, Representative Livingston proposed an
 amendment to H.R. 3822 during the House Intelligence Committee's
 mark-up of the bill.   The amendment would create a new crime for
 disclosing the "substance" of "classified" information received
 pursuant to the reporting requirements contained in the bill.
 This provision is extraordinary in at least two
 respects.    First,  if enacted,  it would mark the first time that
 Congress has incorporated the Executive Branch's classification
 system as a general standard for criminalizing communication
 activity.6/     Second,  it would single out members of Congress and
 their staffs as the only potential targets for criminal
 liability.
 The impetus for this proposed amendment appears to be a
 perception by some that members and their staffs should be sub-
 ject to criminal prohibitions not applicable to others in the
 public or private sector who have access to information that the
 Executive Branch has "classified."
 6/           Congress has repeatedly rejected-proposals which would
 generally make disclosure of classified information a crime.   See
 infra notes 81-82.

 The proposed amendment would apply to a large volume of
 information.  Historically, the 'Executive Branch designates much
 of the information provided to the intelligence committees pursu-
 ant to the existing reporting statutes as classified under, the
 general executive order setting forth standards and procedures
 for limiting access to "national security information."     We
 assume that the Executive Branch would continue this practice
 under the strengthened reporting requirements contained in H.R.
 3822.
 The proposed amendment would exempt from the criminal
 prohibition two narrow categories of disclosures of classified
 information.   First, disclosures that have "the authorization of
 the President" would be permitted.  The President's discretion to
 authorize such disclosures is not limited in any way, nor are
 procedures established to ensure prompt consideration of an
 authorization request.
 The provision would also exempt disclosures made "pur-
 suant to the applicable rules" of the House or the Senate.!/
 7/          At present, the applicable order is Exec. Order
 No. 12,356, 3 C.F.R. 165 (1983), reprinted in 50 U.S.C. S 401, at
 51 (1982).
 B/          H.R. 3822, Section 501(d), would retain essentially
 verbatim the requirement', now contained in 50 U.S.C. S 413(d),
 that each House of Congress, in consultation with the Director of
 Central Intelligence, establish by rule or resolution procedures
 "to protect from unauthorized disclosure all 'classified'  infor-
 mation and all information relating to intelligence sources and
 methods furnished to the intelligence committees or to Members of
 Congress under this title."

 Rules are already in place in both houses specifying detailed and
 exclusive procedures by which the intelligence committees may
 "disclose publicly any information in the possession of such com-
 mittee after a determination by such committee that the public
 interest would be served by such disclosure."9/  In the case of
 classified information provided by the Executive Branch, these
 rules permit public disclosure only after a majority vote in
 favor of disclosure by the committee, notification of the Presi-
 dent, and,                     if the President objects, a majority vote in favor of
 disclosure by the entire house.10/  These rules permit the intel-

 tees or members only in accordance with regulations of the intel-
 ligence committees,ll/ and prohibit such other committees and

 11/         The rules of the intelligence, committees strictly limit
 the circumstances in which such disclosures may be made.   For
 example,  in the House, access by individual members who are not
 on the intelligence committee to classified information held by
 the committee may only be granted upon (1) written notice to the
 clerk of the committee by the Member seeking access and (2) a
 record vote by a majority of the committee approving such access.

 on Intelligence, Rule 10(b).  Members and staff of the the House
 committee are barred from disclosing classified information to

 House Rule XLVIII and the committee's own rules.   Rules of  the

 recently reaffirmed, the tri-partite structure of co-equal
 branches is the very cornerstone of this Nation's democratic
 processes:

 deliberately so structured to assure full,

 The doctrine of separation of power prohibits two major
 types of governmental action.   First,  it makes it impermissible
 for one branch to interfere with another's,performance of its
 constitutionally assigned .function."  The Supreme. Court recog-
 nized this fundamental aspect. of the doctrine of separation of
 powers in Humphrey's Executor v. United States:
 The fundamental necessity of maintaining each
 of the three general departments of govern-
 ment entirely free from the control or coer-
 cive influence, direct or indirect, of either.
 of the others, has often been stressed and is
 hardly open to serious question.   So much is
 implied in the very fact of the separation of
 the powers of these departments by the.Con-
 stitution; and in the rule which recognizes
 their essential co-equality.21/
 The doctrine likewise prohibits one branch from usurping or being
 assigned "a function that more properly is entrusted to
 another." 22/  Thus, each branch is constitutionally,bound to con-
 fine its exercise of authority to the function uniquely.assigned
 to it, namely legisiative, executive, or judicial. 23/

 The proposed amendment raises both of these concerns.
 By creating a crime of disclosure that is targeted exclusively at
 the Legislative Branch,  it would empower . the Executive Branch to
 interfere directly in necessary and . important. functions of the
 Legislative Branch, namely communications among members of Con-
 gress, communications between Members and their staffs, and com-
 munications between members and their constituents and.the pub-
 lic.   Such communication is the lifeblood of the constitutional
 function of legislating that is uniquely conferred upon the Con-
 gress under the Constitution. 24/
 The amendment would have the effect of transferring to
 the Executive Branch substantial authority to direct legislators
 how to handle and use information which the Constitution and
 statute entitles Congress to receive and utilize.   Information
 about intelligence activities relating to national security is a
 matter that does not lie within the exclusive province of the
 Executive Branch.   It has long been recognized that authority
 over national security matters is "confided by our Constitution
 to the political departments of the government, Executive and
 Legislative."25/ Congress, as a co-equal branch of government,

 has a constitutional mandate to obtain information relating to
 national security and defense and to use it in the process of
 legislating.   This mandate -- which of course entails corre-

 to prevent damage to national security -- flows from the Con-

 ties26/ as well as its express constitutional powers in the realm
 of national defense and foreign policy.27/

 incorporates the authority to disclose it.   This is not to

 suggest that there should not be restrictions and safeguards to
 protect against disclosures that would be harmful to national
 interests, nor even that there is no place for consultation
 between the political branches concerning the best methods for
 protecting sensitive information. 28/ Rather, such restrictions
 should be imposed and enforced as they are now, by Congress
 through its own internal rules and processes or through generally
 applicable legislation.  To transfer to the Executive the role of
 supervising Congress in this area, particularly through the mech-
 anism of a criminal law, risks precisely the sort of interference
 by one branch in the affairs of another that the doctrine of sep-
 aration of powers prohibits.  As the Supreme Court recognized in
 Chadha,
 [t]he hydraulic pressure inherent within each
 of the separate Branches to exceed the outer
 limits of  its power,  even to accomplish
 desirable objectives, must be resisted.29/
 The degree to which the proposed amendment invites
 interference by the Executive Branch in the affairs of the Con-
 gress is multiplied because the amendment would convey to the
 Executive Branch the authority to define which disclosures by
 Members or their aides constitute a crime and which are
 28/          Such consultation is already contemplated by provisions
 of the existing intelligence oversight laws which would be car-
 ried forward in H.R. 3822.   See 50 U.S.C. S 413(d)  (1982).

 permissible.   Under the scheme that the amendment would estab-
 lish, the Executive Branch wields two distinct powers-to pick and
 choose. what information may be lawfully disclosed by individuals
 within the Legislative Branch. First, the classification system
 that the amendment would incorporate is a creature of the
 Executive Branch, and it reflects solely the decisions of
 executive officers about what information should be kept
 secret:30/  Neither the amendment nor any other statute enacted
 by Congress erects standards by which classification decisions
 are to be made.31/  As we discuss below, much information that
 does not threaten national security is classified.32/  Nor is
 there any assurance that even under the current executive order
 agencies will not classify information for improper reasons. 33/
 30/         The "classification" system is a creation of the
 Executive Branch.- While some statutes (for example, the Freedom
 of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. S 552(b)(1)) refer to the system,
 Congress has never authorized it.  Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S.
 474 (1958).   See Comment, A Nation Less Secure:   Diminished Pub-
 lic Access to Information, 21 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 409, 433
 (1986).   The Department of Defense has in the past conceded that
 "[t]here is no statute which explicitly authorizes [it] to clas-
 sify information."  118 Cong. Rec. S8854 (1972),.
 31/         Moreover, unlike the Freedom of Information Act's
 exemption for certain national security information, the proposed
 amendment includes no requirement that the information be
 "properly" classified.  See 5 U.S.C. S 552(b)(1)  (1982).
 32/         See infra pp. 34-36.
 33/         There is evidence that in practice embarrassment to the
 Administration sometimes plays a role in the. Executive's classi-
 fication decisions.   See Note, Developments in the Law:  The
 National Security Interest and Civil Liberties,  85 Harv. L.  Rev.

 Second, while disclosure may be authorized by the rules in either
 the House or the Senate, the amendment conveys to the President
 an ad hoc authority to exempt particular disclosures of classi-
 fied information from the criminal prohibition.
 The possibility of abuse of executive secrecy is not
 far-fetched.   As two well-recognized scholars of the problem of
 secrecy in government have noted:
 The ad hoc quality of executive lawmaking
 will be exacerbated when the assessment of
 secrecy needs is tied to current political
 sympathies and antipathies.  Moreover, the
 Executive is inherently self-interested in
 expanding the scope of matters deemed
 "secret"; the more that is secret, the more
 that falls under executive control.   There. is
 surely room in our separation of powers dia-
 lectic, confused as it is, to doubt the wis-
 dom of allowing the fox to define the
 parameters of -- not to mention guard -- the
 chicken coop.34/
 While somewhat ameliorated, the foregoing defects of
 the proposed amendment would not be cured by the fact that the
 amendment would allow disclosures to take place without the Pres-
 ident's authorization if they are made pursuant to the rules of
 either the House or the Senate.   As a practical matter, there
 will be many instances in which one or more members will believe
 that a disclosure should be made either internally or publicly,
 34/         Edgar & Schmidt, Jr., Curtiss-Wright Comes Home:

 but will be unable to mobilize the cumbersome machinery of the
 entire House or Senate as is necessary to obtain a formal autho-
 rization for disclosure. 15/  Although the provision for disclo-
 sures pursuant to rule might in some instances protect some of~
 the Congress'  institutional prerogatives, the-principles of sepa-
 ration of powers prohibit not only interferences at an institu-
 tional level, but also interferences by one branch with the
 activities of individual officials of another branch. 16/
 It is also no answer that the separation of powers-
 issues here would arise as a result of a congressional enactment.
 The Constitutional structure of separate powers cannot be evis-
 cerated merely because one branch is willing to abdicate to
 another its constitutionally mandated role and authority.   Just
 as the issue of whether a statute unconstitutionally tramples
 upon the authority of the Executive Branch is never resolved by
 the mere fact that a President signed the bill into law, 17/ a
 35/         See su ra pp. 7-9 & notes 8-12.
 36/         Thus,  in Bowsher v. Sonar the concern was not that Con-
 gress possessed authority to interfere with the activities of the
 entire Executive Branch, but rather with the activities of one
 individual officer (the Comptroller) who was. exercising executive
 authority.   Likewise, several of the courts that have struck down
 the sentencing guidelines have held that the doctrine of separa-
 tion of powers is violated because three individual judges who
 sit on the sentencing commission are subject to removal from the
 commission by the President.  See, e.g., United States v. Brodie,
 1988 U.S. Dist. Lexis 4646 (D.D.C.).
 37/         For example, the constitutionality of the Gramm-Rudman-
 Hollings statute was not assured by the fact that the President

 statute that unconstitutionally diminishes the role of the legis-
 lature cannot stand just because a majority in both the House and
 the Senate vote for it.   Illustrating this point, the Supreme
 Court has on more than one occasion struck down statutes passed
 by Congress that constituted transfers to the executive of legis-
 lative functions. 38/
 In sum, the amendment would upset the delicate system
 of checks and balances among the political branches and raise
 serious questions under the doctrine of separation of powers.
 As a criminal statute directed specifically at the con-
 duct of members of Congress and,officers and employees of the
 Legislative Branch, and concerned specifically with disclosure of
 information received by Congress in connection with ongoing leg-
 islative functions, the proposed criminal nondisclosure amendment
 also appears to conflict with the Speech or Debate Clause of the

 The Speech and Debate Clause has been interpreted
 "broadly" to prohibit imposing liability,, either civil or crimi-
 nal, upon Members of Congress for a wide category of;activi-
 ties.42/                           Its scope extends well beyond "words spoken in debate,"
 and encompasses "anything 'generally done in a session of the
 House by one of its members in relation to the business before
 it.'"43/     In addition, the clause protects not only Senators and
 Representatives, but their "agent[s] and assistant[s]" as
 well."/
 The proposed amendment conflicts with the Speech or
 Debate Clause in at  least two critical respects.   First,  by its
 terms the amendment would criminalize a substantial category of
 disclosures by members and.their staffs during the course of leg-
 islative proceedings or as a direct part of the legislative pro-
 cess.   While the provision would exempt disclosures made "pursu-
 ant" to the applicable. rules of the House or Senate, many types
 of disclosures within the scope of the legislative process are
 possible which would not be "pursuant" to such rules. 45/

 The proposed amendment would criminalize any of the

 disclosure spelled out in the House and Senate rules had been

 All of these activities, and many others like them,
 fall well within the "sphere of legitimate legislative activity"
 that the Speech and Debate Clause protects from civil and crimi-
 nal liability. 46/
 As the Supreme Court squarely held in Gravel v. United
 States, disclosures of allegedly sensitive national security
 information by Members of Congress and their staffs in the course
 of the legislative process cannot be the subject of a criminal
 investigation or prosecution.   In that case, Senator Gravel had
 convened an open meeting of a Senate subcommittee, at which he
 first read portions of the Pentagon Papers and then placed the
 entire 47 volumes of the Pentagon Papers in the public record.
 Thereafter, a federal grand jury commenced an investigation into,
 inter alia, allegedly unlawful gathering and transmitting of
 national defense information by Senator Gravel.   The Court found
 "incontrovertible" the Senator's claim that the Speech or Debate
 Clause protected him from all "criminal or civil  liability and
 from questioning elsewhere than in the Senate, with respect to
 the events occurring at the subcommittee hearing at which the
 Pentagon Papers were introduced into the public record."'-71  The
 Court went on to state:

 The Speech or Debate Clause-was designed to
 assure a co-equal branch of the government
 wide freedom of speech, debate, and delibera-
 tion without intimidation or threats from the
 Executive Branch.   It thus protects members
 against prosecutions that directly impinge
 upon or threaten the legislative process.--We
 have no doubt that Senator. Gravel may not be
 made to answer -- either in terms of ques-
 tions or in terms of defending himself from
 prosecution -- for the events that occurred
 at the subcommittee meeting.48/
 For these reasons, the proposed criminal provision
 appears to constitute an unconstitional intrusion upon the legis-
 lative process in violation of the Speech and Debate Clause.
 This does not mean that there can be no sanctions upon Members of
 Congress or their staffs for improper disclosures of sensitive
 national security information.   Rather,  it means that within our
 constitutional framework those sanctions in the legislative
 sphere may come only through mechanisms -- such as those that are
 already in place -- that are internal to the Legislative Branch
 and that are consistent with the Speech or Debate Clause.
 48/         Id. at 616.   To be sure, under the Gravel case some
 applications of the proposed amendment would not violate the
 Speech or Debate Clause.  However,  in view of the immediately
 narrow application to Members. and their staffs,  its failure to
 exempt legislative activity appears to lead to substantial
 overbreadth..  See infra pp. 32-39.

 Accordingly, the provision must be strictly scrutinized to de-

 1.     In Light Of The Laws And Rules That Already
 Exist To Protect Sensitive National Security
 Information,  There Appears To Be No Compelling
 Government  Interest To Be Served By The
 Proposed Criminal Amendment.
 As a general matter, the Supreme Court has stated that
 "[t]ruth may not be the subject of either civil or criminal sanc-
 tions where discussion of public affairs is concerned."501  Any
 law that punishes such speech or other communicative conduct vio-
 lates the First Amendment unless it serves a compelling govern-
 mental interest.""  As the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed in
 City of Houston v. Hill, communicative conduct is "protected
 against censorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce
 a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that
 rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest."52/
 Of course, the government has a legitimate and impor-
 tant interest in safeguarding secrets that are vital to national
 security.   To protect this interest, the government may, within
 the confines of the First Amendment, prohibit individuals with
 access to truly sensitive material from disclosing it to others

 to the detriment. of national security. - But "national security"
 is not a talisman that renders the principles of free speech and
 free press inapplicable. 53/
 One critical question is whether the proposed criminal
 provision's additional burdens on First Amendment freedoms are
 justified by a government interest in national security that is
 not already adequately addressed within the existing legal frame-
 work.   As the Supreme Court has made clear, when the interest
 asserted by the government is.already protected by exisiting law,
 there can be no claim that a restriction on speech substantially
 advances that interest so as to survive First Amendment scru-
 tiny.54/
 When the proposed criminal provision is viewed in the
 context of laws that are already on the books,  it becomes clear
 that no "compelling" need for the provision exists.   Congress has
 already erected a delicately balanced structure of criminal and
 other statutes that are aimed at safeguarding national security

 generally been used to prosecute transmissions of sensitive

 tile foreign governments."  The latter three statutes prohibit
 disclosures of especially sensitive information relating to
 cryptography, atomic weapons and the identities of covert agents,

 application, each house of Congress, acting pursuant to its con-

 guarding national security information and for. punishing any Mem-

 which Congress has identified, by rule as applicable to

 There has been no showing that these statutes and rules
 do not adequately serve the government's interest in protecting
 legitimate national security secrets.   It is true that during the

 Branch officials do not of their own force' establish that the
 existing legal structure is inadequate to serve the government's
 legitimate interests in national security.  The Iran-Contra Com-
 mittees found that this rationale was a pretext for concealing
 violations of law and policy and concluded that "Congress has the
 capability of protecting secrets entrusted to it."64/  The Com-
 mittees stated:
 While Congress's record in maintaining
 the confidentiality of classified information
 is not unblemished,  it is not nearly as poor
 or perforated as some members of the NSC
 staff maintained.   If the Executive Branch
 has any basis to suspect that any member of
 the Intelligence committees breached secu-
 rity,  it has the obligation to bring that
 breach to the attention of the House and Sen-
 ate Leaders -- not to make blanket accusa-
 tions.   Congress has the capability and
 responsibility of protecting secrets
 entrusted to it.   Congress cannot fulfill its
 legislative responsibilities if it is denied
 information because members of the Executive
 Branch, who place their faith in a band of
 international arms merchants and financiers,
 unilaterally declare Congress unworthy of
 trust.65/
 A further indication that there is no compelling inter-
 est to be served by the proposed amendment is that its coverage
 is limited to members of Congress and their aides rather than to
 64/          Id.   See also Note, supra note 33, at 1209 ("Con-
 gressmen have a good record for observance of security .  .  . of

 all persons with access to the information in question.   Thus,
 while a member who receives a "classified" briefing from an
 Executives-Branch official could be criminally punished under the
 proposed provision for any unauthorized disclosure, the Executive
 Branch official himself would not be subject to this or any other
 similar criminal provision.66/  This imbalance is. not explained
 by any evidence that an unauthorized disclosure of information by
 a Congressman is more damaging than such a disclosure of the same
 information by an Executive Branch. employee.  Nor, as-me-have
 noted,  is it explained-by any evidence that Senators and Repre-
 sentatives and their staffs are less trustworthy recipients of
 sensitive information than other people.  The Supreme Court.has
 previously held that precisely this sort-of "underinclusivenress"
 in a statute that restricts speech demonstrates that:th'e statute
 "provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's
 purpose" and thereby "undermines the likelihood of a genuine
 [governmental] interest."67/
 In light of the foregoing considerations,  it appears
 that this proposal is not supported by a compelling government
 interest sufficient under the First Amendment.
 66/         Of course, other criminal statutes that have general
 application and are not limited to the Legislative. Branch might
 be applicable to unauthorized disclosures by either an Executive
 or Legislative Branch official, but as noted above they do not
 generally punish disclosures of classified information per se.

 2.    The Amendment Also Appears to Be
 Substantially Overbroad.
 Any restriction on speech must be "narrowly drawn to
 prevent the supposed evils."68/  Because the First Amendment
 needs "breathing space," statutes which regulate expressive con-
 duct must be voided entirely if,                  in addition to reaching
 legitimately prescribed activity, they also reach a "substantial"
 amount of protected activity.69/  The Supreme Court has
 repeatedly made'clear that "even if some of the hazards at which
 [a statute restricting speech] are sufficiently substantial," if
 "the restriction is not crafted with sufficient precision to rem-
 edy those dangers" the statute violates the First Amendment.70/
 The proposed criminal nondisclosure provision appears
 to be unconstitutionally overbroad because,  in addition to
 reaching disclosures which would significantly threaten national
 security,   it would punish a substantial amount of communication
 that would create no such risk.  This overbreadth arises from the
 Executive Branch's classification system; which the proposed
 amendment would mechanically adopt as the standard for

 Both in theory and in practice, that system is not narrowly-tai-
 lored to protection of national security.   Thus, "[f]ar from -
 providing the 'breathing space' that 'First Amendment freedoms
 need .  .  . to survive,'" the criminal nondisclosure amendment
 would, "criminalize[] a substantial amount of constitutionally
 protected speech."71/
 The basic criteria for classifying documents set-forth
 in the current and previous executive orders appear to be. too
 broad to serve as a standard for making expressive conduct a
 crime.   Executive Order 12,356, the current Administration's
 order, directs that information shall be classified at the "Con-
 fidential" level (the lowest. level of classification)  if
 "unauthorized disclosure" of the information "reasonably could be
 expected to cause damage- to the national security." 22/  Once
 classified, the executive order 'directs that information remain
 classified. "as long as required-by national security considera-
 tions."73/  Both courtsand commentators have suggested that. this
 definition covers material the disclosure of which cannot be pro-
 hibited.   Thus,  in McGehee v. Casey, the United States Court of
 71/ City of Houston v. Hill, 107 S. Ct. at 2512 (quoting
 NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963)).

 Appeals for the District of Columbia stated that an earlier, and
 narrower, version of-the "confidential" standard "does, under
 some constructions, touch constitutionally protected speech."741
 It has indeed been suggested that even higher levels of classifi-
 cation may reach protected speech because they "completely
 ignore[] the elements of likelihood and-imminence" of harm.751
 The provision permitting material to remain classified indefi-
 nitely also raises serious First Amendment overbreadth prob-
 lems.76/
 Putting aside the question of whether the basic        .
 criteria for classification could on their face survive First
 Amendment scrutiny, the historically pervasive problem of rampant
 overclassification by Executive Branch officials appears to ren-
 der the proposed criminal amendment substantially overbroad.
 Recognizing "the well-documented practice of classifying as con-
 fidential much relatively innocuous or noncritical information,"

 problem of. overclassification'was.by most accounts less serious
 than today, Former. United Nations Ambassador and Supreme Court
 Justice Arthur Goldberg told a Congressional Committee:
 Anyone who has ever served our Government has
 struggled with the problem of classifying
 documents to protect national security and
 delicate diplomatic confidences.   I would be
 less than candid if I did not say that our
 present classification system does not deal
 adequately with this problem.  .        I have
 read and prepared countless thousands of
 classified documents.,  In my experience, 75
 percent of these documents should never have
 been classified idn the first place; another
 fifteen percent quickly outlived the need for
 secrecy; and only about 10 percent genuinely
 required restricted access over any
 significant period of time.
 As one scholar has argued, such overclassification appears to be
 inevitable for a. wide variety of reasons:

 [t]here would be the.bureaucrat's usual-   I
 incentive to exaggerate the significance of
 his own responsibilities by assigning high
 security classifications to what he reviews;
 the expert's-predictable bias.toward         .
 overemphasizing the considerations that flow
 from that expertise; the government.
 official's understandable tendency to dis-
 count the broader. societal interest. in con-
 trolling government; and the executive
 officer's inevitable temptation to suppress
 information that might prove embarrassing or
 damaging to his conception of the national
 interest. There would,  in short, bean
 inherent proclivity toward pervasive and
 uncontrollable overbreadth in the classifica--
 tion of official secrets.79/
 While during the 1970s the problem of overclassification seemed
 to abate somewhat,. the present Administration, under a new and
 broader executive order, dramatically reversed that trend.80"
 As a result of the proposed amendment's substantial
 overbreadth, enactment of it would have a serious chilling effect
 on communications of Members and their staffs, both among them-

 to obey the law and a wariness of even coming close to the line
 between what is permissible and what is not, there is a risk that
 targets of the prohibition would inform the public less
 extensively about important business of the federal government.
 There is also a risk that members of the intelligence. committees
 would unnecessarily limit their private discussions with col-
 leagues who are not on the Committees, who in turn. will
 unnecessarily limit their consultations with their staffs.   The
 result could well be significantly less informed decision-making
 by Congress, and a significantly less informed citizenry.   It is.
 precisely to avoid such harmful chilling of vital communication
 activity that the First Amendment bars overbroad criminal stat-
 utes.
 In light of these serious constitutional.infirmities,
 Congress has heretofore declined to enact an "Official Secrets
 Act" of the sort that exists in Great Britain, and has stead-
 fastly refused to make the mere act of disclosing classified
 information a crime.   Bills to prohibit generally the disclosure
 of any classified information have been introduced numerous times
 during the last 50 years, but all of them were rejected.81'
 81/         Congress has consistently refused to enact. broad prohi-
 bitions on the disclosure of "classified" information.   For   .
 example,  in 1946, a joint investigative committee urged Congress
 to enact legislation prohibiting the disclosure of any classified
 information.   See Report of the Joint. Committee on the
 Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, S. Doc. No. 244, 79th

 While in rare instances Congress has enacted laws that prohibit
 certain disclosures of "classified" or "restricted" information,
 in each instance other substantive limitations narrowly confine
 the scope of the information subject to the criminal ban. g2/  The
 main obstacle to any broader use of the classification system in
 the criminal arena, not'surprisingly, has been concern that doing
 so would trample First Amendment rights. 83/
 [Footnote continued from preceding page]'             '
 Cong., 2d Sess. 252-531 (1946).   Congress rejected such a broad
 prohibition, and instead enacted the much narrower S 798 of Title
 18.   Similar broad initiatives to criminalize all disclosures of
 classified information were proposed in 1957, 1958, 1962, 1973
 and 1983, but none was successful.   See Senate Select Comm. on
 Intelligence, Subcomm. on Secrecy and Disclosure, National Secu-
 rity Secrets and the Administration of Justice, 95th Cong., 2d
 Sess. 18 (Comm. Print 1978)  (summarizing past legislative initia-
 tives); H.R. 66 (1983).
 82/         Section 798 of Title 18 criminalizes the knowing and
 willful disclosure of specifically defined categories of classi-
 fied information regarding communications intelligence.   The
 report on this legislation stated that this provision covers only
 "a small category of classified matter, a category which is both
 vital and vulnerable to an almost unique degree."  H.R. Rep.
 No. 1895, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1950).   Similarly, the Atomic
 Energy Act of 1954 makes it a crime to reveal "restricted
 data" -- defined as data concerning,  inter alia, the "design,
 manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons" -- with an intent
 to injure the United States.   42 U.S.C. SS 2014(y)(1), 2274, 2277
 (1982).   The Intelligence Identities Protection Act of,1982, 50
 U.S.C. S 421 (1982), prohibits a person with authorized access to
 classified information from disclosing any such information iden-
 tifying a covert agent.   Finally, 50 U.S.C. S 783(b)  (1982) pur-
 ports generally to prohibit any communications of "classified"
 information, but only when the recipient is known or believed to
 be a foreign agent or member of a Communist organization.

 in sum, the proposed amendment would prohibit disclo-
 sure of a substantial amouht of information where no significant
 national security interest in favor. of secrecy exists.   Because
 the provision would thereby sweep within its ambit a substantial
 amount of constitutionally protected speech,  it appears to vio-
 late the First Amendment. 84/
 D.     The Criminal Prohibition Of Disclosure Of
 The'"Substance" Of "Classified" Information
 Creates A Further Chilling Effect.
 The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that laws,.regu-
 lations, and policies seeking to regulate speech on the basis of
 its content must be clear and precise so that those subject to
 regulation are given adequate notice, and so that the regulation
 does not cause speakers to "steer far wider of the unlawful
 zone."85/    In the First Amendment area, "the conduct to be pro-
 hibited must be adequately defined by the applicable .  .  .  law,
 as written or authoritatively construed."86/  The Court held long
 84/          This memorandum does not consider whether the existing
 House and Senate rules barring disclosure raise overbreadth prob-
 lems under the First Amendment.   It should be noted, however,
 that the rules are not criminal and that imposition of legisla-
 tive discipline is not automatic.   The rules indeed may not lead
 to discipline at all in those situations where there has been no
 disclosure of sensitive national security information.

 ago that "a governmental purpose to control or prevent activities
 constitutionally subject to regulation may not be.achieved by
 means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the
 area of protected freedoms. g7/  The Court has also stated:-
 [S]tricter standards of permissible statutory
 vagueness may be applied to a statute having
 a potentially inhibiting effect on speech; a
 man may the less be required to act at his
 peril here, because the free dissemination of
 ideas may be the loser.88/
 The proposed criminal nondisclosure amendment may well
 be unconstitutionally vague because it fails to draw a clear line
 between those disclosures of information by a member or an aide
 vagueness stems from the language of the amendment and from the
 manner in which the Executive Branch classification system
 operates.     It is an additional flaw in the amendment, and a fur-
 ther ground for Congress to reject it.
 The vagueness problem starts with the amendment's use
 of the term "substance."  The proposed statute does not merely
 prohibit disclosures of particular documents that are designated
 classified.   Rather,  its coverage extends to disclosures of the
 "substance" of any classified information that may have been

 of "classified" information, a person who transmits to another
 person ideas or facts drawn wholly or partly from such a docu-

 The uncertainty introduced by the amendment's language
 is compounded many times over by the fact that documents or
 briefings which carry an overall designation of "classified"
 almost invariably contain a range of "classified" and
 "unclassified" information, some of which may be sensitive but
 much of which is innocuous and perhaps already in the public
 domain.   While Executive Order 12,356 requires that "classified"
 documents be "portion-marked" to designate which specific infor
 mation is classified, 89/ this requirement is in practice fre-
 quently ignored,901 may be waived by agency heads,911 and in any

 what they have read or been told is in fact classified.   Accord-
 ingly, the potential targets of the criminal prohibition would be

 92/         The mere fact that documents and information relate to

 a specific definition of. what is covered by the prohibition.
 This much is clear from Gorin v. United States, 312 U.S. 19, 27-
 28 (1941).   There the Court acknowledged that the phrase.
 "relating to the national defense" would raise serious vagueness
 problems absent a specific scienter requirement not present in

 APPENDIX 12
 74'ak 964""
 Hon.  Dante B.  Fascell,,Chairman
 Hon. William S.  Broomfield,  Ranking Minority Member
 Committee on Foreign Affairs
 United States House of Representatives
 Washington,  D.C.  20515
 Dear Chairman Fascell and Rep.  Broomfield:
 The Hale Foundation appreciates the opportunity to submit its
 views on H.R.3822,  proposed legislation relative to intelligence
 oversight. The Hale Foundation, designated a 501(c)(4)  organization
 under the Internal Revenue Code,  advocates a strong United States
 intelligence capability.  It represents many thousands of Americans in
 all parts of the country to that end. The Hale Foundation recieves no
 government support of any kind.  For my part,  I have spent almost 25
 years in the  intelligence profession, mostly as an intelligence
 operations officer,  mostly overseas.  I  left government service as a
 Deputy Assistant Secretary of State,   Bureau of Intelligence and
 Research.
 The Hale Foundation strongly supports the principle of covert
 action,  or  "special activities," which in American history date from
 at least the Revolutionary War. Captain Nathan Hale, after whom The
 Hale Foundation is named,  in addition to his more famous  intelligence
 activities,  was widely acclaimed in the Continental Army for his
 leadership in daring and dangerous special operations.  Without
 successful covert action in conjunction with its European allies, our
 Republic probably would have failed to survive in its struggle for
 independence.
 The Hale Foundation approves of the purpose of H.R.        3822 to
 consolidate the provisions of  intelligence oversight by amending the
 National Security Act of 1947 to repeal the Hughes-Ryan language in
 the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.  By placing the substance of the
 latter section in an amended National Security Act,  the Congressional
 intelligence committees apparently. would acquire jurisdiction in
 intelligence matters to the exclusion of any other committee.  Hale
 believes that the two legislative  intelligence committees should have
 such exclusive jurisdiction.  In this connection, The Hale Foundation
 supports the establishment of a Congressional joint intelligence
 committee along the lines of H.J. Res.  48 to consolidate oversight
 and  improve security, essential to the effective conduct of U.S.
 foreign affairs.

 On the other hand,. The Hale Foundation opposes language that
 would impose new and,  in Hale's opinion,  inflexible restrictions on
 the Executive Branch regarding deferral of congressional notifcation
 of covert action.  Hale believes that such restrictions would  imperil
 the success of  important and particularly sensitive covert action
 operations, a danger especially grave where the lives of intelligence
 personnel and agents. are at risk.  Some covert action requires a long
 gestation period-, during which secrecy is essential.  A requirement
 that a president's decision to authorize a covert action  (and his
 subsequent written finding to that effect) must be reported to
 Congress within a strictly delimited time would amount effectively in
 some important cases to prior notice, a condition Hale strongly
 opposes.  Such a strict requirement raises the constitutional question
 of presidential prerogative.  The standard of "timely fashion," a
 reasonable one in the view of The-Hale Foundation,  responds-to the
 constitutional requirements of both branches of government.
 As a practical. matter, as Executive Branch testimony before the
 Congress has demonstrated,  most covert action operations have been
 reported in advance to the appropriate. committees or the alternate
 selective group of Congressional leaders  (the so-called "gang of
 eight").  Hale believes,  nonetheless,  that it is essential to maintain
 flexibility on the question of deferral  in unusual cases.
 The Hale Foundation agrees with Judge Griffin Bell,  former
 Attorney General of the United States,  when he testified in 1980 as
 follows on proposed restrictions on covert action:  "To the.extent
 these provisons might serve to prevent the President and senior
 intelligence officials from carrying out vital activities with the
 requisite dispatch and secrecy,  I believe them to be unwise,
 unnecessary and perhaps unconstitutional. From the earliest days of
 this Republic,  it has been recognized that the foreign affairs
 function is necessarily the primary province of the Executive.  ...The
 legislative function must be a reasonable one, adding its strengths
 to the process while not sapping the strengths of the Executive.
 There should be a continuing dialogue between the Executive and the
 Congress.  But the Congress should not,  in effect,  be inserted into
 the councils of the Execut.ive.  This should alter fundamentally the
 checks and balances relationship intended by the framers of the
 Constitution."  (Hon.  Griffin Bell,  testimony on S.  2284,  1980,  pages
 326-7.)
 Finally,  The Hale Foundation believes that,   however worded, any
 legislation with respect to Executive Branch reporting to-the
 Legislative Branch on either  intelligence collection operations or
 covert action should retain the stipulations. of the National Security
 Act of 1947 that such reporting be "consistent,.with all applicable
 authorities and duties,  including those conferred by the Constitution
 ...and... with due regard for the protection from. unauthorized

 disclosure" of sensitive classified information.(Sec.  501.  50
 U.S.C.413)  The loss to either collection operations or to covert
 action of these protections would,  Hale believes,  seriously damage
 United States  intelligence capabilities with respect to cooperative
 foreign governments and endanger the lives of unilateral foreign
 assets and American intelligence personnel,  themselves.
 Thank you for considering the views of The Hale Foundation on
 the proposed legislation.
 Sreiy,
 Lawrence President
