 SUBJECT:   Symposium of Comments on                of 5 March,  1952,
 "Events Leading up to a Split in the Soviet Communist
 Leadership."
 This report was the subject of comment by Mr. Charles E.

 Kennan, Ambassador-designate to the Soviet Union, by

 by the Office of Current Intelligence, CIA.   The comments
 showed almost complete unanimity on the report as a whole.   The
 following points emerge from these analyses:
 1.    Like other documents which purport to describe a split
 in the Soviet leadership, this report suffers by being too "pat,"
 too oversimplified.
 2.    The sources which claim access to information of this
 sort could hardly have come by it in the normal course of
 events.     In particular,  it is doubtful that they could know
 in detail of any split in the Politburo.   Whatever its pre-
 liminary differences of opinion may be,  the Politburo presents
 a united front once a decision has been reached.
 3.   This report contains contradictions and inconsist-
 encies which would hardly be present in an evaluation by any
 individual in a position really to know about the workings
 of the inner circle.
 4.   It should be borne in mind, however,

 In summary,  this analysis appears to be an extremely
 intelligent reconstruction based on discussion, gossip, some
 information and working backward from events ......... It cannot
 be taken at its face value but it is a very shrewd bit of
 deductive reasoning.   In its main conclusions I would say
 that it was probably nearer right than wrong........''   (Mr.
 Bohlen based the last sentence on three points in the report:
 that in varying degree, both alleged factions desire to avoid
 war;  that Stalin remains the unquestioned arbiter, above all
 subordinates; that the ascendency of the more cautious group
 is borne out in Soviet policy since Korea.)
 Mr. Kennan, agreeing in general with these points, added:
 "The source of this report appears to forget the important
 fact that when policy decisions are taken by the Politburo on
 specific, problems  (and I do not believe that decisions are
 taken any other way) the question at issue is regarded as
 settled and no longer a fit subject for discussion or debate,
 and it is defended from that time on by all. members of the
 Buro.   The result is that differences of views must always be
 restricted to the specific plane of the new question on the
 docket and can never attain the sweep of views professing to
 have historic depth."
 25X1A
 "This document,  in my opinion,  is an able and probably
 25X1X sincere effort                               to construct what goes
 on in the Politburo, based on rumor, gossip, and information
 which is probably .classified.   I do not think that any such
 individual has access, classified or otherwise, to what really
 goes on in the Politburo.   Too much of the document is not
 understanding, sincere Communist, and too much of it is in
 conformi.ty with Western patterns of thought rather than Russian."

 "Ii; it is a bona fide report                                  it

 Appendix I.   Analysis by her. Charles E. Bohlen
 March 17,  1952
 MEMORANDUM FOR GENERAL WALTER BEDELL SMITH,
 Director of Central Intelligence,
 25X1A I      x read and reread this extremely interesting report
 I         I concerning the divergent points of view within
 the Politburo and their resolution by Stalin.            The author is
 obvious:Ly a man exceptionally well informed on doctrine,
 bolshev'.ik thought processes and the top mechanism of the Soviet
 Government. He appears also to have considerable knowledge as
 to the personalities directly involved.   There is nothing in
 this analysis which directly contradicts what we know from
 other sources concerning the individuals and their beliefs.
 The account, however, appears to be too pat and over-precise
 to be accepted at full face value    It is highly unlikely
 25X1X that                                                  would
 have access to such complete information as the proceedings
 inside the Politburo as to be so categoric as to the exact
 positions taken by its various members on what are clearly
 the most secret debates on the most important issues in that
 body.
 My general impression therefore is that this  is an extremely
 intelligent reconstruction of what probably happened, working
 backward somewhat from the events and basing this analysis, as
 indicated above, on a first-rate understanding of bolshevik
 thought and on the type of specular discussion which undoubtedly
 has been proceeding in Cominfo:rm circles in satellite countries
 plus,  I should say, some scraps of hard information which provide
 the part of the skeleton on which this analysis is built.   In
 one sense the division into the "realist" and "opportunist"
 schools is a rather curious terminology.   What appears to have
 been at issue would perhaps best be described by those who
 believe that the world situation was still in a revolutionary
 :flow,  i.e.,  the opportunists, and those who believe that world
 capitalism was entering a period of relative stabilization
 and revolutionary ebb, the realists.   There is a further sub-
 division stemming directly from these two divergent; analyses
 concerning direct action versus indirect revolutionary exploi-
 tation.                          From other and obviously equally uncertain information
 it would appear that the leaders of the two schools, were Zhdanov
 on the one hand and Malenkov on the other rather than Zhdanov
 and Andreiev as indicated on page two, paragraph 8, although
 subsequently,   in the development of the dispute it is correctly
 stated that Malenkov came to head the so-called opportunistic

 TOP
 :school, i.e., the school that believed that capitalism was
 not capable of a new period of-stabilization.   I believe the
 analysis of the division as set forth in paragraph 14, page 4,
 is convincing since it centers around their difference in
 estimate of the state of world capitalism plus a reference to
 what undoubtedly was a very controlling factor,  the effect
 inside the Soviet Union of one course of action as against
 another.   The absence elsewhere of emphasis on the influence
 of domestic considerations is one of the chief weaknesses of
 this paper.   The description, although probably imaginative,
 as to how Stalin dealt with these divergent tendencies in the
 politburo is,  I believe,  fully in accord with what we know
 from Stalin's technique of Government.   I am also very much
 impressed with the description of the considerations allegedly
 advanced by both sides as to the Asian opportunities offered
 by the Communist victory in China and again by Stalin's
 resolution of the dispute.   I found also particularly con-
 vincing the basis for Stalin's decision to go into South Korea
 as a sort of semi-compromise between the two schools (para-
 graph 26, page 6).   These considerations are particularly
 valuable since they give greater emphasis to the so-called
 revolutionary aspects of the South Korean venture which I have
 always felt had not received sufficient attention in our
 analysis of Soviet motives in setting off the North Korean
 attack.   The failure of all assumptions to,materialize as
 anticipated in the South Korean affair is,  I believe, un-
 doubtedly true.   All our information and the course of Soviet
 action since U.S. action in Korea seem to bear out the main
 thesis that the whole South Korean thing was a major politico-
 mili.tary, error which drastically and adversely affected the
 policies of the Kremlin.   The most interesting part of the
 analysis is, of course, in paragraph 30, page 7, when Beria
 allegedly standing outside of the two factions  (this is question-
 able) laid down the three main considerations governing Soviet
 action at the present time.   There are certain points of
 detail on which this is questionable, such as placing Ehrenburg
 in the camp of the opportunists whereas his wartime attitude
 in regard to Germany, which required public chastisement at
 the hands of Alexandrov in the spring of 1945, would not
 logically put him in this group, and also the evident contra-
 diction in regard to Bulganin's position (paragraph 28, page 6)
 who demanded open Soviet participation in the Korean conflict
 on the grounds that its prolongation increased the risk of
 world war.
 Whatever its authenticity,  I believe the description of
 how the world looks to the politburo as of January 1952  (para-
 graphs 42 through 55)  is a very acute analysis.   I would very

 Approved Fw'Release 2, e#0$/J~*  A-RDP91TO14m7i2R000400130011-3
 much doubt, however, whether, as stated in paragraph 56 on
 page 10,     the so-called realist group believed that it would
 be possible to have a world war in the period 1954 to 1958
 followed by an armistice which would then last for some 20 years.
 That seems to me to be an extremely infantile conception, given
 the status of modern weapons.
 The description of the status of power of the chief
 individuals concerned (paragraphs 60 through 63, page 11)  is
 perfectly good speculation but by no means the only possible
 one.   The present indications would show that Malenkov is
 for the moment riding considerably ahead of Molotov.
 In summary,  this analysis appears to be an extremely
 intelligent reconstruction based on discussion, gossip, some
 information and working backward from events.   In fact,  in the
 description of the source,  it is stated that the author based
 his analysis on what he had read and heard.   It cannot be
 taken at its face value but it is a very shrewd bit of
 deductive reasoning.   In its main conclusions I would say
 that it was probably nearer right than wrong since it emphasizes
 the following fundamental points:
 1.    Both factions are eager to avoid a world war although
 the so-called realists would be prepared to take
 greater risks in this regard than the opportunists;"
 2.    Despite the blow to his prestige in the Korean blunder,
 Stalin still remains the unquestioned arbiter,
 standing above all subordinates;
 3.    The victory of the opportunist or more cautious school
 appears to be confirmed up to the present by the
 course of Soviet policy since Korea and also by the
 recent emphasis in top Soviet speeches on the colonial
 and semi-colonial areas.
 From this report and other information it would appear highly
 important: to assemble and keep under constant review any
 information concerning the respective positions of Molotov
 on the one hand and Malenkov on the other.   At the present
 time all information points to the rise of Malenkov and the
 eclipse, possibly temporarily, of Molotov.   If this process
 was reversed, it might foreshadow a shift towards the school
 for direct action.
 George Kennan is at present in Princeton and unless you
 think it urgent that some special courier take this up to him,
 we will have to await his return to Washington, now set for the
 second of April,  in order to get his appraisal.

 Appendix        Analysis by Ambassador George F. Kennan
 Date:   April 3,  1952
 To:      Mr. Bohlen
 From:    George F.  Kennan
 My views about this paper coincide very closely with those
 ven on 'page 3 of your memorandum to General Smith of March 17.
 25X1X      I think this document was drafted by a peripheral character
 who had picked up a good deal of
 gossip and was a fairly shrewd Judge of what was going on,
 although probably without adequate background as to the pre-
 World War II history of the Soviet regime and Soviet foreign
 policy.
 The issue he has stressed,  namely that of the-interpre-
 tation of the trend of events in capitalist society,  is un-
 doubtedly correctly portrayed as the central issue of interpre-
 tation agitating --- and doubtless dividing, on many occasions ?--
 the members of the Politburo.   This, however,  is by no means a
 recent phenomenon.   The failure of the world revolution to
 follow the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1918 has always been
 the central fact in the foreign policy of the Soviet regime,
 and the prospects for the disintegration or consolidation,
 respectively, of capitalist society has always been,  I feel
 sure,  the central problem of analysis underlying the formulation
 of Soviet foreign policy.
 The account of specific issues arising for the Kremlin in
 the period since 1945 and of the ways in which they have been
 handled is extremely sketchy and often confused and over-
 simplified.   The real truth is unquestionably a far longer
 and more complex story than this account would indicate.   That
 there are disagreements of the nature he describes,  I would
 not doubt; and that these differences center around the
 respective views of Molotov and Malenkov is natural in view
 of the relationship of those two men to the problem of suc-
 cession;  but  I think we should be extremely cautious about
 accepting, such material as real evidence of the positions of
 the men in question.   I suspect that such differences as they
 may have would be found,  if the truth were known,  to be of
 a  much more subtle nature than is suggested here and to have
 come out much more with relation to specific problems of
 policy, rather than as general views.   The source of this
 report appears to forget the important fact that when policy

 decisions are taken by the Politburo on specific problems
 (and I do not believe that decisions are taken any other way)
 the question at issue is regarded as settled and no longer
 a fit subject for discussion or debate and it is defended
 from that time on by all members of the Buro.   The result
 is that differences of views must always be i?estricted to
 the specific plane of the new question on the docket and can
 never attain the sweep of views professing to have historic
 depth.

 Appendix III:   Analysis by
 25X1A
 1. The subject document is unusually interesting.   The
 probability of the existence of tensions and cross.-purposes
 within the Politburo has long been recognized, but with the
 exception of past purges and questionable cases, such as that
 of Zhdanov, which,  if they ever existed, have been resolved,
 our knowledge of their actual existence, nature, points at
 issue and groupings of personalities is, as far as I know,
 a complete blank.   If the content of this document is reliable,
 its intelligence value is very high and could well have a,
 major effect on our planning and action.   I do not believe
 that it merits such credibility.
 2.   In general,  the viewpoint and reactions attributed
 to the "'opportunists" are much closer to orthodox Bolshevik
 thought than are those attributed to the "realists".   I have
 no doubt but that it is possible, given sufficient knowledge,
 to group the Politburo into those who are inclined to favor
 more aggressive policies and those who would act less boldly.
 Such a grouping might also be a source of strain, but both
 groups would view things in the light of long-accepted central
 concepts, and the pattern of their divergences would depart
 materially from that set forth. in this document.   Neither
 group would hold the view that their own masses would not
 permit the use of atomic weapons  (par.  55), and often the
 view attributed to the Realists as being in opposition to
 that of the Opportunists could not fail to be held by any
 good Communist.   Sometimes, as in the supposed contrast between
 the USA and Socialists,  (par.  58) the views of both groups are
 actually orthodox and can be held simultaneously in the Russian
 mind with no difficulty.
 3.   If a division as extreme as that which is portrayed
 existed,    the so-called Opportunists would be very apt to brand
 their opponents as "opportunists" and themselves as "realists",
 for some of the more important views attributed to the Realists
 are so inconsistent with a very consistent Bolshevik pattern of
 thought that those who held them would be regarded as adven-
 turers.                         Those aspects of Realist thought seem to me to be
 unnatural to a hard-core Communist  (which must be a pre-
 requisite for Politburo membership) and sometimes even un-
 Russian.

 4.   In the sense in which the Bolsheviks define the term,
 it would take some unaccustomed wishful thinking to consider
 the world situation ripe for immediate revolutionary action,
 even without the risk of war (6).   No true Bolshevik, even if
 discouraged (and there is little to discourage them), could
 consider that all political means leading to final Communist
 victory had been exhausted (55), or seriously doubt that
 there would be time before 1954-1958 to take measures to
 interfere with a war initiated by the Americans  (56).   Nor would
 ,they consider that revolutionary intervention in favor of world
 Communism, as distinct from military intervention, has become
 so perilous as to constitute a major limitation (30 b), nor that
 aid to bourgeois Islamic feudal lords or any of the bourgeoisie,
 for that matter, need be unconditional  (52).
 5.   The date of 1950 as one by which the recovery of the
 Soviet Union and the absorption of the satellites would have
 been achieved is not in accordance with realities, and would
 not appear so to even an optimistic Soviet mind (15).   Much
 `different views are continually given to the Russian people
 by their leaders, and one has only to live in Russia to know
 that the time element is much longer.   I believe that major
 questions of policy are settled in the privacy of the Politburo,
 and not in the broader publicity of joint meetings with the
 Cominform and Chinese statesmen (23).   There are ample means
 other than external adventures for controlling the chronic
 dangers arising from the inactivity of the Soviet Army and the
 failure of Soviet workers to obtain the promised benefits (14).
 I do not believe that the Soviet leaders have fallen into
 self-deception by coming to believe their own propaganda, but
 rather that they believe in the ultimate validity of its
 orientation and aims and are completely conscious of its (to
 them legitimate) distortion of supporting fact (14).
 6.   Many of these points seem to me to be very represent-
 ative of viewpoints that are held by those who have not lived
 for long in the Soviet Union and are not familiar with its
 realities.   They are part of the normal Western or non-Russian
 thinking?   The explanation of Thorez' presence in Moscow as a
 make-weight for Eisenhower's presence in Europe  (33) and
 regarding Korea as Stalin's first major politico-military
 error, together with its connotations (29a, 30, 60), seem to
 me to be non-Russian interjections.   There is reason to believe
 that Russia's appraisal of atomic weapons is not consistent
 with the absolute weapon (2a).   Especially noteworthy is the
 attribution to any hard-shell Communist of a belief that inter-
 national problems could have been settled by their arguments
 at the Paris conference (9), and to Molotov's disillusionment
 (10).   They just don't think that way.

 7.   Major considerations, notably problems of weaknesses
 and limitations of a peculiarly Russian nature, are completely
 untouched.   In my opinion,  the Politburo is well aware of them
 and they would profoundly condition the thinking of the Realists
 and be reflected in the issues under discussion.   The problems
 that would arise in the minds of any responsible Russian are
 simplified out of existence.   They know that there is more to
 overrunning Eurasia than a purely military capability (9c).
 Even when Russia is not directly involved,  issues are over-
 simplified and a genuine schism would be more apt to cleave
 along other lines than those stated.   This applies sometimes
 to the viewpoints of both Realists and Opportunists.   Examples
 are the favoring of an attack on Tito (51),  the reasons for
 calling off such an attack (33), the cleavage on further Chinese
 expansion (19),  future action in Indo-China, Hong Kong and
 Formosa  (53), and the policy towards the satellites  (54).
 The realities involved, such as the intervention of the Seventh
 Fleet in Formosa and the fact that the Soviets are not being
 forced into either contrasting policy in the satellites, are
 missing.
 8.   Khruschev is something more than a colorless careerist,
 for, regardless of results, he has shown ability in agricultural
 planning and general administration.   Russian officers have told
 me that Vasilievskii does not represent the Army, but is as much
 of a politico as Bulganin (60).
 9.   Among the minor inconsistencies and misstatements is
 that the satellites were exploited at the expense of devastated
 Soviet territory (2b), expectation of help from international
 Zionism (34), and US need to withdraw troops from Korea for
 the rearmament drive elsewhere (36).
 10.  Other explanations than those given sometimes seem
 to fit the facts and the situation better, such as the reason
 for Mao's visit to'Moscow (20)and anti-Semitism (34).   The
 Koniev plan for overrunning Europe may have existed (10),
 but it is a normal function of the military to make plans
 within the limits of their capabilities.   Whether or not they
 are seriously considered for implementation is another question.
 It is probable that Kuznetsov and the old army chiefs do not
 always fully support Molotov (61), but this does not necessarily
 mean a Politburo split.
 11.   The document is lengthy, and very much of it is not
 subject to these objections.   Much of it can well be accurate.
 Even the grouping of personalities may be true, but if so it
 would be on different issues and different platforms.   A
 doubtful  point which seems to be capable of authoritative

 independent intelligence checking is that regarding Communist
 strength. among the Indians of Guatemala, Ecuador, Brazil and
 Chile   (47).   A genuine schism might arise on the subject of
 military security versus ideological security in Germany (50),
 and there is undoubtedly more than one opinion on how best
 to exploit Communist gains and successes  (5).   1 believe that
 it is very true that no firm decisions or blue prints have
 been made by the Politburo, and that that has a continuing
 impact in the satellites,  including China, and in the little
 Polit?buros of all the Communist parties of the world (64).   I
 do not believe, however,  that there is any fundamental struggle
 in the Politburo for acceptance of a Plan with a capital ?'P",
 but that instead the Russians will continue to be opportunists
 and adjust themselves with a high degree of flexibility to
 whatever comes as they have in the past, without changing
 25X1Xtheir basic Communist aims,  intentions and orientation.
 12.   This document,  in my opinion,  is an able and probably
 sincere effort                               to construct what goes on
 in the Politburo, based on rumour, gossip, and information
 which is probably classified.   I do not think that any such
 individual has access, classified or otherwise, to what really
 goes on in the Politburo.   Too much of the document is not
 understanding, sincere Communist, and too much of it is in
 conformity with Western patterns of thought rather than Russian.
 It is recommended that the alignment of individuals, but not
 their supposed viewpoints or powers, be kept in mind as a
 possibility.

 1.1.   Since preparing the foregoing,  I have read the very
 able analysis done by CIA's organization                 which
 takes into account external rather than internal evidence.
 The only comment I have to make on that analysis is that it
 may lay too much stress on the discrepancy between the announced
 role of the Cominform and the role implied in the document
 under discussion.   It would not only be contrary to Communist
 training and doctrine for the Cominform to adhere to its
 publicized functions, but most of those particular inconsist-
 encies disappear when one accepts the high probability that
 the influential members of the Cominform can and will continue
 to function in a broad area as Communists under a different
 hat.   In any event,              strongly reinforces the conclusions
 which I have drawn above.

 Appendix )[V:   Analysis by the Office of Current Intelligence, CIA
 15 March 1952
 1.   This is one of several similar reports supporting one
 school of thought which interprets Soviet policy in the post-
 war period as indecisive because of an as yet unresolved split
 within the Politburo over the degree of militant action to be
 risked in pursuing the USSR's ultimate goal.   In some versions,
 the split purportedly is on the level below the Politburo itself.
 All these reports suffer because they give the unmistakable
 impression of being generally too "pat."   In most cases the
 sources purporting to possess this information could hardly
 have come by it in the normal course of events.   There are
 also certain contradictions in this source's account of^Y,I'l       25X1X
 be accurately informed.
 2.   This report must remain speculative since indecisiveness
 and a deep policy split are by no means the only possible
 explanations for recent Soviet policy and tactics.
 3.   It should be pointed out that the introductory para-
 graph to this report describes it as "source's personal interpre-
 tation of what he has read and 'heard."   It could, of course,
 be a plant;  if so,  it is a carefully thought-out one.   if it
 25X1X is a bona fide report F_                      I it should be
 regarded as an evaluation by a man in an excellent position to
 see, hear and read of, in much more detail than anyone this
 side of the Iron Curtain,  the development of Soviet policy and
 intentions.   As such it must be seriously treated and carefully
 checked.   The interpretations which this report sets forth
 often run parallel to speculation in this country over the
 Kremlin's apparent hesitation in the face of growing Western
 strength and increasing Western effectiveness.

 COMMENTO REPORT ON "EVENTS LEADING UP
 1.   Much of the paper could have been written from hind-
 sight, that is from the record of current history since 1945
 and an assumption that if a split had existed in the Politburo
 throughout this period, the conflicting views could have been
 25X1X      as the source describes them.
 3.   The present report is more ambitious than most of
 this series, since it draws up two Politburo groups, nearly
 equal in, size, and alleges that this division has existed since
 World War Ii with no significant change in the composition of
 the conflicting parties.   The contrasting positions of these
 groups on most of the issues in Soviet relations with the West
 are presented and show a nearly superhuman consistency over a
 period of six years.
 4.   No evidence is available with which to evaluate the
 information in such reports as to the various individual
 opinions of Politburo members or the cliques into which they
 might be split.   Party discipline and the principle of "demo-
 cratic centralism" assure presentation of a united front to
 the world after a decision is made, regardless of divisions
 prior to the decision.
 5.   It is also unlikely that a split in the Politburo
 would be revealed to even as important an outsider as Mao,
 or that the latter could directly determine Soviet policy
 (paras.     23 and 26).   In fact,  it would have been imprudent
 at any time to strengthen Mao's bargaining position by making
 a split Politburo so clearly evident to him?   Needless to
 say,  the Soviet regime would do everything to avoid the
 eventuality described in par. 64 of the report,  in which the

 split is pictured as common knowledge in Satellite govern-
 ments and in "little Politburos" all over the world.
 6.   The report also asserts that the division runs through
 Communism outside Russia  (par.  39), but formal divisions
 along the line described are not known to exist outside the
 Orbit.     In view of numerous other reports on disagreements
 within the parties, such a split presumably would have become
 known.
 7.   Since the source of this report
 it is extrem-ly unlikely that he would have accurate information
 on deliberations in the Soviet Politburo.   There is no evidence
 available to substantiate the all-important role the source
 attributes to Beriya as a mediator between the factions and as
 the man responsible for the truce negotiations (paras 30 and 36).
 8.   The source's statement that Stalin lost confidence in
 himself as a result of the unexpected UN intervention in Korea
 (par. 30) is less likely to be a fact than a reflection of loss
 of confidence in him on the part of some Satellite officials.
 9.   In treating the whole postwar picture, the source is
 often inaccurate in his timing of events.   Thus he places  the
 wave of anti-semitism in the USSR in 1950 or early 1951 when it
 actually occurred in early 1949 (par.  34), and Molotov's
 conversion to the need of Korean truce talks in July 1951,  (see
 par. 35), when it would seem probable that the shift must have
 occurred considerably prior to Malik's June 23 speech.
 10.   In the source's account of events which influenced
 Soviet :foreign policy or revealed the split in the Politburo,
 there are certain surprising omissions.   The source does not
 discuss the Kremlin attitude toward dealing with Tito prior
 to the :latter's break with the USSR, or the Paris conference
 of Deputy Foreign Ministers in the spring of 1951, or the
 Japanese Peace Conference of September 1951.
 11,   There are certain contradictions in the source's     25X1C
 account of meetings or plans on which
 should The accurately informed?   The source makes reference To
 plans to be carried out by "Cominform headquarters" in the
 Near East and in Latin America (par. 47),  We have no evidence
 that the Cominform -- Information Bureau of the Communist and
 Workers' Parties -- sponsors covert activities,  formulates
 any phase of international Communist policy, or that it has
 headquarters or branches other than in Bucharest.   The function
 of the Cominform today apparently is to publicize propaganda
 and ideological guidance through the journal it issues from

 TOP SECRET
 Bucharest.   In fact, the nine member parties have held no
 known meeting since November,1949.   The source's account of
 Cominform activities contrasts with a report based on an
 interrogation of Arnost Heidrich, former Secretary-General of
 the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs who defected in
 November 1948.  When questioned regarding the role of the
 Cominform, Heidrich remarked that it is a front organization
 designed primarily for the spread of propaganda.   Heidrich
 elaborated that controls are exercised over national. Communist
 parties through more direct channels from the Soviet Communist
 Party.   The source mentions "Cominform centers" in Addis Ababa
 and Accra (par. 47 from which a "racial revolt" in Africa will
 be directed, but no such Cominform centers are known to exist.
 The Soviet Union itself maintains missions in Africa located
 in Cairo, Pretoria, and Addis Ababa.   The Soviet establishment
 in Addis Ababa consists of a legation, hospital and reading
 room, with a staff of possibly 20 to 30, which is large, but
 not much out of proportion in view of the outside activities.
 This mission is not a Cominform center, but has contributed
 to Soviet propaganda and subversive activity in Central and
 East Africa.   There are indications that it has the role of a
 transmission center for propaganda and for contact with front
 groups and Communist parties in such places as Eritrea, British
 Somaliland and the Belgian Congo.   It is in contact with the
 Soviet Consulate in Pretoria, South Africa, as well.   There is
 no Soviet mission of any sort at Accra.   A check of the file on
 Communism in the Gold Coast discloses no reference whatsoever
 to a Cominform center there.   Its existence is improbable on
 general grounds.   There is also a specific reason for believing
 its existence improbable.   This consists of specific infor-
 mation on the nature of the outlet for distributing Communist
 literature in September 1950 period, when the present native
 nationalist leaders were in jail instead of running the govern-
 ment.                                                                             25X10
 lidentified this outlet as the "New
 African Literature House" and evaluated the firm as "interested
 primarily in the financial return of.the sale of these publi-
 cations rather than in the content."
 12.   The source reports the results of a Moscow meeting
 in the early spring of 1950 of "a plenary session of the
 Politburo and Cominform in Moscow"  (paras.  23 to 26).   This
 vastly exaggerates the role of the Cominform, of whose true
 nature a Satellite official might be expected to be aware.
 Instead of presenting it as a periodic instrument for the
 glorification of Soviet policy, he makes it a sort of inter-
 national counterpart of the Politburo -- more like the Comin-
 tern of the 1920's.

 subjects discussed reflects certain obvious characteristics
 of the international situation of early 1950, with the possible
 exception of "American military arrangements in Germany,
 Japan, and Spain" and the location of atomic experiments in
 Siberia  (par. 24).
 14.        The report does not contain a clear statement on
 the likelihood of war during the next several years.   How-
 ever, since the source alleges that the "opportunist" group
 is now in power (par. 40), war in 1952 is considered not
 intended and not probable even though remaining a possibility.
 The policies ascribed to the "realist" group does not appear
 from the report to have had predominant power since the fall
 of 1950.
 15.   The apocalyptic long-range prophecy of paras. 56 and
 57 contrasts markedly with par.  59 and does little but weaken
 the report as a whole.

 1.  Russian Communist leaders of the Politburo are agreed that:
 a.  World revolution, as the final result of the class struggle in modern
 society, will be a political achievement arising out of the social conditions created
 by the brutality and selfishness of the capitalist system.  In the last phase, when
 all other devices leading to world revolution have been exhausted, there will be
 militant action by the revolting masses.  (Marx, 1859)
 b.  The world revolution will take place as the final result of an accumu-
 lation of minor revolutionary actions on the part of the masses, organized and led
 by the Communist party, which has taken over the command of the working classes
 in modern society.  It will be fought out in a cycle of world wars, the last of which
 will develop as a war of continents, with the two Americas as agents of capitalism
 against Eurasia as the defender of Communism, and Africa as an important and
 probably decisive battleground.  (Lenin, 1917)
 c.  World revolution, as the end-product of the growing force and influ-
 ence of the Soviet Union to a position of leadership in the progressive part of mod-
 ern society, can be achieved without direct Soviet participation in the cycle of
 world wars.  The Soviet must, however, supply the strongest possible impetus and
 produce the disintegration and collapse of capitalism.  For tactical reasons conces-
 sions and delays may be countenanced to make it appear that capitalism and

 Communism.. can co-exist in the world, provided that these tactics serve the ulti-
 mate purpose.  (Stalin, 11936)
 . 2.  The-Politburo has been forced to take cognizance of new basic developments
 occurring during the period of the Second World War, as .follows;
 a.  The invention of atomic weapons, which h9.ve rendered Lenin's
 cycle of world wars an impossibility, limiting the number of future world wars to
 one or two.  This accelerates the approach of the last phase of the world crisis,
 which began in 191.4.
 b.  The unexpectedly great Soviet territorial gains and political successes,
 which have brought with them the necessity of exploitation at the expense of the
 reconstruction of devastated Soviet territory.  Victory in the final clash between
 capitalism and Communism has thus become a much more immediate reality
 than could have been anticipated.
 3. In consequence of these developments, the Politburo decided in 1945 not to
 disarm, but to keep 'the largest possible portion of the Soviet Army. in a state of immediate
 readiness, and to set up the Kominform,as its new instrument of aggressive international
 Communism.
 4. These decisions, based upon the suppositions of a guaranteed internal secur-
 ity for the Soviet Union and the submissive attitude of the satellites, had the practical re-
 sult of greatly increasing the personal power of Beria, then head of the Soviet Police.  He
 was entrusted with the direction of all of the.Soviet system.
 5. From 1945 on, there have developed wide divergences within the Politburo
 with regard to the best method of exploiting the territorial gains and political successes ob-
 tained by the Soviet.  These changes. destroyed the old.-balance of power and made a change
 in Communist tactics an obvious necessity.  Two different schools of Communist thought
 arose with regard to the best tactical method of bringing about world Communism.
 6,  The realist school considers the world situation, as produced by the Second
 World War, ripe for immediate revolutionary action, even at the risk of war.
 7.  The opportunist school considers the world situation, as produced by the
 Second World War, one which offers opportunities for indirect revolutionary action, which
 need not risk war,
 8.  These, divergencies within the Politburo appeared originally in disputes on
 fundamental theoretical questions between Zhdanov and Andreiev, but without affecting prat-
 tical Soviet policy.  Mikoyan, who urged the revival of economic cooperation between East
 and West, was one of the first to adopt the opportunist point of view publicly, and produced
 some effects on. practical policy.
 9.  During the 1945-1946 period of preparation for the peace settlements there
 were clashes between the Soviet and its war-time allies about such questions as the adminis-
 tration of Germany, the future of Trieste and the Italian colonies, Poland, etc.  These
 clashes produced further divergencies in the Politburo about the tactics to be followed by
 Communists throughout the world., about principles to be defended and measures to be taken
 at the Paris peace conference of 1946..  Molotov, after arguing in vain with American
 .Secretary of.State Byrnes and British Foreign Minister Bevin, reached the conclusion that
 the post-war world situation, dominated by Soviet military supremacy and economic confu-
 sion in the capitalist states, could not be exploited by bargaining measures unless these were
 accompanied by intimidation.  He accordingly took over the leadership of the realist group in
 the Politburo, whose conceptions may be defined as follows:

 a.  Any delay may help the West to find its way out of its difficulties and
 to recover its strength.
 b.  Communist military action would not inevitably be answered by the
 West with war, but on the contrary, could extract from the West new compromises
 for the benefit of the Soviet.
 c?  Even if a new world war took place, the Soviet armies could rapidly
 overrun Eurasia.
 d.  If Eurasia were occupied, the chances of the powerless and surprised
 USA accepting a truce would be greater than ever before.
 e.  A respite, lasting perhaps several decades, would thus be gained,
 in which the Soviet orbit could be immensely reinforced in preparation for the
 final clash.
 10.  The Soviet General Staff shared Molotovns disillusionment with the result of
 the Paris conference.  It began at once to work out the so-called Koniev plan. for overrunning
 Europe.    A whole generation o:f Soviet diplomats (Zorin, Gromyko, Malik) adopted a strong
 line, and Soviet policy noticeably hardened.
 1 1. During the same period of preparations for the peace settlement the.first con-
 n.rete political penetrations on a large scale were made in such defeated capitalist countries
 as France and. Italy.  Meanwhile Soviet Communist Party officials took over the direction of
 Soviet public life from the military leaders, regarding the latter as nationalistic and politi-
 cally unreliable.  The propaganda and doctrinal drive in Russia was revived at the same time
 as conspiratorial and subversive activities abroad, and Malenkov, as the Soviet Communist
 Party leader and spokesman, became more and more involved in this activity.  The careless,
 ness with which the West permitted the Soviet to take over all capittlist positions in Central
 and Southeast Europe was regarded by Malenkov and his followers as indisputable evidence of
 the decadence of the West.  This political and economic disintegration in capitalist countries
 has long been. a dogma of the Communist faith as announcing the forth-coming revolutionary
 victory of the working classes of the world,
 12.  ..Dealing with such leaders as Thorez, Togliatti, Gottwa ld, "Pieck, Bierut,
 Rakosi, Ho .Chi Minh, when invited to Moscow for conferences, Ma.lenkov reached the con-
 clusion that the world situation. could best be exploited by promoting social disturbances in
 capitalist countries.  He considered that this world situation was dominated by Communist
 superiority in political prestige, resulting from Communist participation in the resistance
 movements against German and Japanese occupations, and Communist readiness everywhere
 to submit to the working classes solid, attractive, and progressive economic programs, in
 comparison to the programless and. backward capitalist leadership.  As instrumentalities
 Malenkov looked forward to continuous cycles of strikes, eventuating in revolts and civil
 warn--instrumentalities which do not depend upon the use of other, more drastic and ag-
 gressive procedures.  The use of such aggressive means, Malenkov believed,. might pro-
 voke the awakening of the capitalist warmongers and bring about armed conflict.  Such con-
 flict would unnecessarily endanger the class struggle.  Malenkov was thus led to reject any
 concept of military action, since the result of World Communism .could better be attained
 by peaceful means.    Asa result Malenkov became the leader of the opportunist group in the
 Politburo., whose concepts may be summed up as follows:
 a.  The revival of capitalist society in the West is impossible and its
 decline cannot be arrested.
 b.  Revolutionary action cannot be resisted successfully by the weak-
 ened bourgeoisie, and will be vigorously supported by the working classes, who
 are psychologically weary of war.

 c.  Even though the risk of revived Fascist reactionism in capitalist
 countries is run, Eurasia could quickly be overrun by organized peoples' revolts
 at any time.
 d,  The USA would surely accept a truce if Eurasia became Communist
 through the revolutionary action of the masses, since an economic crisis would
 develop there.
 e.  A respite of some decades would be gained in this way,. -and could
 be used to undermine the white man's posit;.-. )n in Africa through propaganda for
 Islamic and Negro freedom, and in the same way a foothold could be gained in
 1 South America before the final, clash.
 13.  Sharing Nialenkov's belief in theefficacy of conspiratorial and subversive ac-
 tion are such economists as Varga, such publicists as Ehrenburg, and the numerous agents
 in Western countries.
 14.  After the Paris Peace Conference ended in October, 1946, the division with-
 in the Politburo took more precise form in the attitude toward social conditions in Russia
 and the orbit states.  The realist (Molotov) group, discounting the belief in a world crisis
 of capitalist society, insisted on the dangers arising from the inactivity of the Soviet Army
 and the-.-failure. of-Soviet workers to obtain the promised benefits.  The opportunist group
 considered the world crisis of capitalism as imminent, basing this ;judgment upon the
 numerous (distorted or fabricated) reports of hunger and unemployment in Western coun-
 tries.  These 'rfacts, " which made Soviet life .attractive in comparison, were presented at
 public meetings, in the press, on stage and screen, so often and so effectively th.t there
 arose-a, degree of self-4eception, in which the illusions invented by them about the West
 became realities .for the very inventors.  Varga, the economist, early deserted the oppor-
 tunist group, and other quarrels arose which called for Stalin's intervention.
 15.                Thanks to Beria's guarantee of 1946 that by 1950, at the latest, the Soviet
 would have adequate strength in atomic research and weapons, Stalin decided to consider
 the period 1946-1950 as a transitional epoch in which there would be achieved:
 a.  The recovery of the Soviet Union.
 b.  The absorption of the satellites.
 c.  The maintenance of Soviet military strength.
 d..  The political and economic undermining of the West.
 16.  In a practical sense, Stalin's decision failed to bridge the gap between the
 realist and opportunist groups.  It merely offered both an opportunity to make the best of
 conditions, but it was not made clear to both that armed conflict with the West should not
 be involved.
 17.  This. two-.fold. policy of the Soviet Communist Party, resulting from Stalin's
 decision, brought about defeats for each group during the transitional epoch.  The realist
 group was defeated on the Berlin blockade and with regard to Tito's defection, which demon-
 strated the dangers of the accidental outbreak of the clash with the West.  The opportunist
 group was defeated on the Italian elections and in the expulsion of the Communists from
 .Ramaelier's government in France, which demonstrated the limits of Communist infiltra-
 tion of the West.  Both groups shared. responsibility for the absorption of Czechoslovakia,
 which represented a gain., but also aroused Western suspicion to the point of rearmament.

 18.  The fundamental rift in Russian. Communist policy, which threatened to cause
 internal struggles in Communist parties throughout the world, flared up again after the vic-
 tory of Mao Tse-tung Communist armies in China.  This was accepted by the whole Politburo
 as the greatest event in the history of world Communism since the outbreak of the Russian
 revolution in 1917. Asia has always been considered by..Soviet strategists as at least equiva-
 lent to Europe in importance for Communist. world. conquest, and was accepted by all Soviet
 leaders as the preliminary battlefield of the Communist world revolution.  The conquest of
 China thus offered a suddgn opportunity to begin an armed attack on. the whole of Asia, or at
 least a general revolutionary movement.  The Politburo was unanimous in believing that the
 abandonment of widespread Asiatic territories by American capitalist interests and the weak-
 ness of the defenses of British, French, and Dutch imperialists, offered good chances for
 the successful exploitation of the triumph of the Chinese Communist armies.  But the two
 Politburo groups diverged sharply on the tactics to be employed in this exploitation, and two
 different proposals were laid before Stalin.
 19.  The realists asked immediate military intervention in favor of the revolting
 Asiatic peoples, while the opportunists asked for a pause in Chinese expansion and the con-
 solidation of ground already gained.
 20.  The struggle between the two groups became very acute, and in the late au-
 tumn of 1949 Stalin decided to invite Mao Tse-tung to Moscow for consultation.
 21.  Molotov, without binding the Soviet to direct action, presented h 4o Tse-tung
 with the arguments that military action in Asia could not be opposed by' the weakened: and de -
 pressed. West and would therefore involve no risk of world war; and.. that Chinese' military ac-
 tion in Asia would be the starting point of a general Asiatic revolution which could not be
 restrained by the West and. therefore Asia would be won for Communism without a world war.
 22.  Malenkov distrusted a successful Oriental and. non-Russian Communist, and
 offered Mao Tse-tung the arguments that the Chinese Communist victory,would in any case
 have revolutionary consequences among Asiatic peoples, consequences which could not be
 resisted by the West; and that Chinese Communist victory in Asia requires a recovered
 China for the final clash with capitalism.
 23.  No agreement between the two groups could be reached, and Mao Tse-tung de-
 manded a guarantee of Soviet help in case of a conflict resulting from Chinese military or
 revolutionary actions in Asia.  In the early spring of 1950 Stalin convoked a plenary session
 of the Politburo and Kominform in Moscow, inviting Mao Tse-tung.  Stalin directed. the de-
 bate ruthlessly, in his. desire to reach-.final decisions on the fundamental items of Commu-
 nist world policy and to end, once and for all, the debate between the two groups, which had
 spread into the Kominform.  Stalin himself summed up the evoluti n of the international
 situation as consisting of the running out of the period of absolute soviet military supremacy
 and. the postponement of all immediate chances of world crisis by American economic pros-,
 perity.
 24.  At the meeting there were also considered. the following developments in the
 Soviet orbit:
 a.  The successful experiments with atomic weapons, in Siberia under
 Beria's supervision.
 b.  The quick recovery of China, which was not deprived of important
 strategic materials from Western sources.
 c.  The promising results of the drive for industrialization. among the
 satellites, particularly Poland and Czechoslovakia.

 25.    The following points with relation to the capitalist countries were considered.
 a.  The positive results of Marshall Plan aid among the Western coun-
 tries, bringing Communist agitation there to a standstill.
 b.  The dangers resulting from American military arrangements in
 Germany, Japan, and Spain.
 c,  The possibilities of the contagious-influence of Tit&  heresy among
 Western Communist parties.
 26.  Some spokesmen from both groups :desired. priority to be given to Yugoslatvia.

 .
 Mao"use-tungos insistence that the Soviet concentrate on Asia. . Stalin decided upon Asia as"
 the most fruitful field. for Communist expansion, as being ceuntermmoves;  South Korea was selected because it was  oconsidered, the Americans were
 not interested, due to the unsatisfactory peace settlement there, and -ready to?.acce t a
 Communist fait accompli, because South Korea was considered militarily unprepared an
 politically weakened by the corrupt pseudo-democratic regime; because militarnterven-
 tioan. by North Korean troops was expected to develop into a -revolution; and. because victory
 in South Korea, achieved without any risk of world war, was considered as a useful means
 of strengthening the, prestige- of the Soviet Union and China and preparing for further moves
 27.  TIje choice of South Korea gave particular satisfaction to the realist g rou
 ...as ending the period of time wasted in vain ws,itinga but also satisfied    o              Pa

 28.  America?s immediate and vigorous military intervention in.South Korea had
 disastrous effects on the new Soviet world strategy Not one of the assumptions behind Stalinas decision to allow the North   rear at world poliry, tack true,  Bulganin now came .forward on behalf of the realist group, blaming the half-measure
 prove
 resulting from the -eternal braking action of the o                                               es
 and Soviet participation in the conflict,            ppiOrtcmists, and demanding open Chinese
 prolongation of which was increasing the ?iak of
 world war.  Mikoyan proposed immediate mediation through India.  He declared that the
 North Korean attack, which proved neither quick nor efficient enough to produce a revolu-
 tionary movement in South Korea, was adding nothing to Communist prestige in the world;
 that in the long run it would put Communism in the position of being the .ag ressor and
 would endanger Chinats vital traffic with the West in strategic materials by way of Hong
 Kong.
 29.  The Politburo was forced to reconsider the whole world situatian in the light
 of the .following .factors. a.  Stali&s first major politico-military error, which weakened his
 hitherto spotless reputation as a wartime leader and guarantor of Soviet unity.
 .b.       The influence of the creation of a battlefield in which Americans
 were directly involved, with the initiative removed from Soviet hands.
 c.        The influence of starting the American rearmament drive, most
 feared by Soviet leaders, which changes the world balance of power to the detri-
 ment of the Soviet.
