 CHINA:  Reconfirming Foreign Policy
 I              Since the death of Mao Tse-tung,  the Chinese leader-
 snip  as moved quickly to reconfirm the general outline of Chi-
 nese foreign policy, especially toward the US and the USSR.
 The Chinese have used several occasions since Mao's
 ea o reiterate the importance they attach to relations with
 the US.  They have also made it clear that they remain displeased
 with some aspects of US foreign policy, such as the continuation
 of the US policy of "detente" with the USSR.
 Both the official announcement of Chairman Mao's death
 an  Premier Hua Kuo-feng's eulogy for Mao on Saturday included
 statements of China's intention to "resolutely" carry out Mao's
 "revolutionary line and policies in foreign affairs," a euphe-
 mism for China's diplomatic opening to the US. The statements
 also included sharp criticism of the USSR, calling the Soviets
 a "renegade clique" at the core of  "modern revisionism."
 I        I The Chinese press quickly published President Ford's
 letter of condolence in which he reaffirmed determination to
 complete the normalization of Sino-US relations. Chinese media
 also replayed the President's statement to US newsmen on Mao's
 death.

 These moves contrast with China's rejection of the
 con o a ory message from the Soviet party Central Committee--
 on the grounds that the Chinese "have no relations" with the
 Soviet party. The Chinese also allowed several days to pass
 before they publicly acknowledged that two Soviet Politburo
 members had expressed condolences at the Chinese embassy in
 Moscow.
 I             Heated anti-Soviet propaganda has continued to appear
 in    inese media since Mao's death,  focusing on the general
 theme of Soviet "expansionism." This treatment of this sensi-
 tive issue is clearly designed to counter speculation that Chi-
 nese policy toward the USSR is likely to change now that Mao
 is gone.
 The Chinese have extended exceptionally cordial treat-
 ment to  ormer secretary of defense Schlesinger. The reinstate-
 ment of Schlesinger's tour of the Chinese hinterland--a trip
 which included visits to a number of places close to the Soviet
 border and which the Chinese had initially said would have to
 be canceled when Mao died--appears to have been prompted by
 anti-Soviet considerations.
 //Conversely  the Chinese have used Schlesinger's
 visit, which began three days before Mao died, to register dis-
 approval of some aspects of US policy, particularly US-Soviet
 "detente." Schlesinger's views of "detente" with the USSR have
 long been welcomed in China.//
 //Chinese Ambassador to the UN Huang Hua was ex-
 plicit in his attacks on "detente" during a talk with Ambassa-
 dor Scranton, who called last week at the Chinese mission to
 express condolences on Mao's death. Huang reiterated standard
 Chinese warnings that "detente" might hasten war rather than
 prevent it, and deplored the fact that "some European coun-
 tries" were not standing up to the Soviets.//
 /Another indication of continuing Chinese pique
 with the     was the perfunctory treatment of Secretary Kissinger
 in media coverage of foreign tributes paid to the late Chairman.
 The Chinese did not publish the Secretary's statement after
 Mao's death, and he was given no special prominence in Chinese
 coverage of condolence calls paid by senior US officials to the
 Chinese mission in Washington.//

 architects of the Sino-US rapprochement--Mao and Chou--have
 passed from the scene, however, may be designed to warn Wash-
 ington that, although a relatively close relationship with the
 US still has the support of most leaders,  critics at home could
 gain the ,u  er hand if progress   oward that goal is not made
 soon.//

 MALTA:   Mintoff's Party Wins Election
 I       I Maltese Prime Minister Mintoff's Labor Party won a
 close but decisive victory over the opposition Nationalists in
 the parliamentary election on Friday and Saturday.
 I             The final vote count is expected to give Labor about
 52 percent, which will translate into a three-seat majority for
 Mintoff in the new parliament. This is more than enough to guar-
 antee the continuation of a strong Labor government for the next
 five years,  given Mintoff's tight control of his party and the
 unwavering loyalty of the Laborites in parliamentary votes.
 I             IThe result is a personal triumph for Mintoff,  and he
 will interpret it as a mandate to continue his controversial
 foreign policy aimed at avoiding alignment with either the US
 or USSR.      Since taking office in 1971, Mintoff has gradually
 loosened Malta's traditional ties to the UK and NATO and has
 sought to extract bilateral pledges of economic assistance and
 guarantees of Maltese neutrality from the island's Arab and
 European neighbors.
 I             In recent months, Mintoff has directed his appeal
 mainly to France,  Italy, Libya, and Algeria. France and Italy
 have temporized, but Libyan President Qadhafi and Algerian
 President Boumediene gave public pledges of support in late
 August.
 h    lection behind him, Mintoff is likely to
 With t e e
 push harder for commitments from the French and Italians.  Some
 Italian officials,  including Rome's ambassador to Malta, are
 reportedly lobbying in behalf of Mintoff, but the Andreotti
 government is probably too preoccupied with domestic problems
 to formulate an official response anytime soon.

 UK:  Import Controls Likely
 I                 //The Labor government has agreed to a trade union
 request to set import ceilings on selected foreign goods, ac-
 cording to a Trades Union Congress official.//
 //There was no immediate government confirmation
 o     e union statement, which was made following a meeting be-
 tween union and government officials, including Prime Minister
 Callaghan. The government has until now resisted union demands
 for import controls because it fears that foreign retaliation
 will undermine prospects for Britain's export-led recovery.//
 //Union pressure to take some action is strong
 because of the continuing rise in unemployment,  currently at a
 postwar record of 1.5 million. Earlier this month,  the annual
 meeting of the Trades Union Congress unanimously passed a mo-
 tion urging the immediate imposition of selective controls.//
 //The latest unemployment figures will be announced
 today, and the jobless picture is expected to remain grim. Ac-
 tion on selective controls would demonstrate the government's
 desire to prevent the loss of jobs to "unfair" foreign competi-
 tion.//
 //The Trades Union Congress spokesman said the
 government would announce import ceilings for 35 sectors of
 British industry in a few weeks.  Fear that Britain's trading
 partners will retaliate, however, may cause the government to
 set import ceilings artificially high so as to have only a minor
 impact.//
 I                   /Last December, the Labor government imposed some
 token controls on textiles,  footwear, and TV sets and tubes,
 which amounted to only 1 percent of total British imports.//
 /Automotive imports continue to be a problem for

 NORTH KOREA:       Withdrawing UN Resolution
 I North Korea, in a sudden turnabout, has instructed its
 supporters in the UN to withdraw from the provisional agenda of
 the UN General Assembly the draft resolution favoring the North
 on the Korea question, according to press reports.
 The North Koreans may have detected some weakening in
 e support for their position at the UN this fall. Last year
 two conflicting Korean resolutions were passed, and the North
 was hoping to build enough momentum this year to achieve an
 outright defeat of the South.
 A number of recent developments, however, have improved
 the prospects for passage again of South Korea's resolution,
 --The unusual display of dissent registered by 23 countries
 against a harshly worded North Korean resolution submitted
 at the nonaligned conference in Sri Lanka.
 --The improved pro-South lobbying effort.
 --The confrontational language of the draft UN resolution
 submitted this year by the North.
 --The adverse publicity stemming from the Panmunjon inci-
 dent in mid-August.
 North Korea may also have sensed that there was growing
 sentiment at the UN this year for a deferral of debate on the
 perennially contentious Korea issue. The backers of the pro-
 South resolution will probably also move to withdraw their item
 from the agenda.

 VIETNAM: UN Membership
 The UN Security Council's agreement to postpone con-
 sideration of Vietnam's admission to the UN has drawn little
 reaction from either Vietnam or its Southeast Asian neighbors.
 Although members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations

 were prepared to vote for the admission of Vietnam in the Gen-
 eral Assembly if the Security Council had approved its appli-
 cation, none of them appeared willing to lobby actively on
 Vietnam's behalf.
 I               By the time the postponement was announced, the
 ASERM go     ments had backed away from an earlier interest in
 addressing the Security Council in support of Vietnam, but they
 had tentatively agreed to speak in favor of Vietnam's applica-
 tion in the General Assembly.
 I         IVietnam continues to be distrusted by its ASEAN
 neig  ors--a distrust sharpened by Vietnam's part in the com-
 munist attack last month on Malaysia's proposal at the non-
 aligned conference in Sri Lanka for a zone of "peace,  freedom,
 and neutrality" in Southeast Asia.  Their pique over that inci-
 dent, however, has had little impact on their decisions to sup-
 port Vietnamese membership in the UN and in other international
 bodies.
 I             IThe Southeast Asians clearly are seeking a middle
 grounc at will both avoid antagonizing Vietnam and yet not
 make them appear too eager to appease the Vietnamese. At the
 same time, they are both sensitive to US problems and anxious
 to appear independent of US influence.
 Vietnam has welcomed the Security Council's agreement
 to postpone consideration of its application until November.
 Hanoi radio on Thursday briefly noted that Vietnam,  "in order
 to express its good will," did not object to the French pro-
 posal to defer action.
 I            Vietnam's release of the names of 12 Americans miss-
 ing in a714-ion was clearly a last-minute attempt to stave off
 the expected veto.  Its purpose in publishing the exchange of
 notes with the US on September 13 was to place the onus on the
 US for the failure to open bilateral discussions and to blunt
 the MIA issue.
 I             Vietnam asserted that the two sides had already agreed
 to discuss matters of interest to both parties, including MIAs
 and normalization of relations,  as well as US reconstruction
 aid, which, in fact, the US has never agreed to discuss.

 The Vietnamese at present are probably not prepared
 to be more forthcoming on the MIA issue, which they undoubtedly
 still view as their only important leverage with the US. Viet-
 nam probably will continue to link US reconstruction aid with
 the resolution of the MIA issue,  at least until the Vietnamese
 have had time to assess US policy after the November election.
 //The clash in Panama yesterday between National
 Guar  troops and anti-government university students indicates
 that the government's charges of US responsibility for last
 week's rioting have not yet redirected student protest.//
 I           J Riot troops using tear gas and shotguns clashed with
 severai     undyed university students carrying signs protesting
 government repression and the high cost of living. About 80 stu-
 dents were arrested; some were reportedly injured.  University
 classes were suspended to avoid further trouble.
 //This was the first major involvement of university
 groups in the week-old protests, which were incited largely by
 high school demonstrators. The clash also suggests that the gov-
 ernment's strong show of force and preventive arrests--which
 kept demonstrators off the streets last Thursday and Friday--
 may be losing their effectiveness.//
 //The government may still face problems at the
 secondary level as well. Representatives of the nation's largest
 high school,      controlled by anti-government factions,  refused
 to attend the recent official dialogue between Vice President
 Gerardo Gonzalez and student leaders.//
 /If university and high school groups unite,  gov-

 student movement that he has counted on as one of the pillars

 GUATEMALA-BELIZE: Talks and Saber Rattling
 //British and Guatemalan negotiators are meeting
 in Panama today and tomorrow to work on a draft treaty to set-
 tle the territorial dispute over the self-governing British
 colony of Belize. The talks are the latest in a long series
 held among the three parties involved in the dispute. Little
 progress is likely to be made on solving the key issue of a
 territorial cession to Guatemala.//
 //The Guatemalan military is holding military exer-
 cises         he Belize border with the apparent intention of in-
 fluencing the outcome of the talks. The exercises, which involve
 practice parachute drops, live firing training, and patrol boat
 maneuvers, are probably no more than saber rattling. Nonethe-
 less, the possibility of a Guatemalan military strike into
 southern Belize should the talks end in acrimony cannot be
 discounted. //
 I          7T  //Guatemalan President Laugerud recently told a
 visiting       tate Department official that his negotiators in
 Panama will bring up the territorial question in the expecta-
 tion that the UK will eventually make counterproposals. He said
 that Guatemala is prepared to give up its claim to the majority
 of the colony and settle instead for a portion of the south.
 Laugerud emphasized that Guatemala needs a piece of Belizean
 territory to save face.//
 /Laugerud said that if the talks should fail and
 the     were to grant unilateral independence to Belize, he
 would have no recourse but to take military action against
 Belize. He noted, however, that Guatemala wanted to take all
 possible steps to avoid hostilities.

 JAMAICA: Aluminum Negotiations
 Jamaica reportedly is nearing a settlement of its
 two-year contract dispute with three US aluminum companies.
 The dispute centers around Jamaican demands that the
 companies renegotiate contracts permitting Jamaica to purchase

 up to 51 percent of each company's bauxite operation and allow-
 ing reversion to Jamaica of unexploited bauxite reserves in ex-
 cess of 25 years' needs. Jamaica also wants the companies to
 ratify a 600-percent increase in taxes on bauxite and alumina
 production and minimum output levels.
 Jamaica reached preliminary agreement with Alcoa
 last week, and a final accord is expected to be signed in Octo-
 ber. Jamaica has already reached agreements in principle with
 the remaining two companies, Kaiser and Reynolds, which are
 now pressing for final settlement. Details of the agreements
 were not announced.
 Prime Minister Manley is anxious for early ratifica-
 tion of                       is demands in order to enhance his candidacy in the
 elections, expected by early 1977. The companies favor early
 agreements because they believe Manley would take a tougher
 stand following an election victory.

 Approved For Red
 A politically provocative sermon read Sunday by
 Protestant pastors has heightened tensions between church and
 state in East Germany.
 The sermon was approved last week by Evangelical
 151s ops, who had been shaken by the public immolation last
 month of one of their pastors who had taken an active interest
 in youth affairs.  The bishops not only repudiated the regime's
 contention that the suicide was the act of a demented man, but
 also called upon the church to bear "political witness" and
 criticized its own past silence on problems in East German
 society. The sermon's outspoken appeal to stand "unequivocally
 and more convincingly" on the side of youth will increase un-
 ease in the party hierarchy.
 The party would     bably prefer to avoid an open
 po emic with the church.
 Party-leaders will probably fall back on the familiar
 tactic o  attempting to divide church ranks by encouraging pro-
 government church leaders to express their opposition to the
 stand of the bishops.
