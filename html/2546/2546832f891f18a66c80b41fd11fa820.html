 MAOIST SOCIAL EXPERIMENTS IN CHINA, 1969
 Since summer, 1968, considerable progress has been made in restoring order and moving
 the Cultural Revolution into a "constructive" phase. The era of Red Guard violence is over,
 and although a low level of disorder and. political tension persists in the provinces, the
 military have imposed firm rule on most of the country. Mao Tse-tung has successfully
 purged the Chinese Communist Party of the major figures he believed were opposing him.
 The new leadership around him is about to convene a party congress to adopt a new party
 constitution and to form a new politburo and central committee which will reflect the power
 structure that has emerged from the Cultural Revolution. These, however, are merely the
 formal objectives of the congress. Real. progress in restoring stability and order may continue
 to be slow in view of the staggering problems facing Peking.
 The Chinese leaders still have far to go to repair the damage wrought by the Cultural
 Revolution, and their effectiveness continues to be inhibited by turbulent behind-the-scenes
 politics. Political jockeying is particularly apparent in the provinces, where factional struggles
 among leaders still hinder consolidation of the new governing units that have been set up in
 China's 29 provinces. While preparing for the forthcoming ninth party congress, the elite in
 Peking have put on an outward display of unity, but there are probably still divisions over
 both power and policy issues. These continuing divisions make it unclear what decisions the
 congress will reach or what policy guidelines it will formulate.
 One of the major divisive issues probably is how far to go in pushing the socioeconomic
 policies and mass campaigns Mao believes are necessary to promote his unique vision of a
 selfless, egalitarian, and "revolutionary" China. These include rural reforms, population
 transfers, changes in education, purge efforts, and changes in administrative structure. Similar
 measures were pushed during the Great Leap Forward and again in 1963-65, often with
 ruinous results. Nevertheless, Mao seems determined to continue his experimentation, and
 this may represent his price for closing out the Cultural Revolution.

 Socialist society is a fairly long historical stage.
 During this stage of history, classes, class contra-
 dictions, and class struggle continue, the struggle
 between the road of socialism and the road of
 capitalism goes on, and the danger of capitalist
 restoration remains. (Red Flag, 20 June 1967)
 The various social and economic experi-
 m ents which have been under way since the sum-
 mer of 1968 bear the unmistakable stamp of Mao
 Tse-tung. In essence, they involve an effort to
 transform China's society and economy to fulfill
 Mao's ideals-presumably the object for which the
 political.. battles of the Cultural Revolution were
 fought. Among the wide range of complex factors
 contributing to that upheaval was Mao's growing
 belief gnat his conception of a "new China" had
 been steadily losing ground since the debacle of
 his Great Leap Forward in 1958.
 After the Great Leap failed, Mao apparently
 posited an almost indefinite timetable for the
 "complete victory of socialism" in China. He saw
 the development of socialist society as a process
 of uninterrupted revolution, and the important
 question for him was how to sustain revolution-
 ary momentum for perhaps five or six genera-
 tions. His answer was that the success of the

 revolution could be assured only if men could be
 remolded into true believers. In his view, re-
 making men is the really crucial task of the revo-
 lution-more essential, even, than institutional
 change, technical and scientific modernization, or
 rapid industrialization.
 Mao did not lose all grasp of China's practi-
 cal problems, but the evidence is that his thinking
 became increasingly colored by revolutionary
 romanticism. While the regime pursued policies of
 social and economic retrenchment to recover
 from the disasters of the Great Leap, Mao became
 progressively obsessed with the belief that Soviet-
 style "revisionism" was spreading and under-
 mining his revolutionary accomplishments. He
 feared that the revolutionary elan the leaders had
 fostered in the party and society as a whole
 would gradually weaken, that there would be
 pressures to moderate the harshness of political
 dictatorship, and that private, personal interests
 and enterprise would motivate China's masses
 more than abstract virtue or long-range collectiv-
 ist goals. Mao believed that the period of recovery
 in the early 1960s accentuated such trends, and
 his reaction was to renew the emphasis on pro-.
 grams emphasizing austerity, self-sacrifice, and
 ideological purity. At the same time he was devel-
 oping a growing and probably well-founded suspi-
 cion that many officials, and probably some
 members of his inner circle, did not share his faith
 in permanent revolution. This suspicion became a.
 principal factor in triggering the Cultural Revolu-
 tion.
 During the violent struggles of 1966-1968,
 Mao's concern with maintaining revolutionary fer-
 vor was evident, but in the heat of battle, few
 initiatives were taken to implement many of his
 pet socioeconomic projects. As the leadership
 finally moved to curb widespread factional vio-
 lence last summer, Peking began issuing reform.
 directives in Mao's name. These in turn paved the
 25X1
 way for launching in the fall a series of mass
 campaigns and social experiments which suggest
 that the Maoists are as determined as ever to
 make Chinese society more egalitarian and more
 '`revolutionary"-regardless of the cost. Within
 the past six months, a clearer picture has emerged
 of the course on which the 75-year-old Mao hopes
 to set China's development before he passes from
 the scene.
 SOCIOECONOMIC EXPERIMENTS, 1969
 By the beginning of the new year, it was
 clear that the campaigns under way on a national
 scale were designed to resume the pressures for
 greater socialization that had been largely sus-
 pended during the Cultural Revolution. The vari-
 ous programs identified to date include: 1) a
 campaign to simplify administration, 2) dispersing
 huge numbers of city dwellers to the countryside,
 3) dispatching more medical personnel to rural
 areas, 4) reform of education, 5) reforms of the
 rural wage system, 6) changes in basic commune
 institutions, 7) "re-education" of intellectuals,
 and 8) an extensive campaign to clean out "class
 enemies"-a broad category of former landlords,
 ex-party cadres, recalcitrant commune leaders,
 and other political undesirables. The experiments
 have mushroomed since last fall, but local varia-
 tions are substantial, suggesting that national pol-
 icy is still vague and tentative.
 A firm determination of how much addi-
 tional impetus the experiments will receive may
 not be possible until the ninth congress. At pres-
 ent, social and economic policies are probably
 being debated behind the scenes. There was some
 evidence of this in Peking's most recent pro-
 nouncement on economic policy on 21 February.
 Although heavily encrusted in standard Maoist
 slogans, that statement called essentially for a
 more reasoned, systematic management of indus-
 trial and agricultural production. This statement
 may,  however, reflect only one side in a

 continuing debate, since no moderation of Maoist
 measures has been noted. There is little doubt,
 however, that moderate elements in the regime
 are disturbed because Maoist reforms make it
 difficult to operate the economy effectively, to
 restore the cohesion of the state, and to maintain
 the degree of law and order necessary for a return
 to stability.
 RURAL REFORMS
 China's vast peasant population, for exam-
 ple, has to bear increasingly heavy burdens as the
 result of being on the receiving end of most of the
 current campaigns. In recent months there have
 been numerous reports of curbs against the re-
 maining private sector in the rural economy,
 which has provided peasants with a significant

 In order to promote a big leap forward in agricul-
 ture, it is necessary to let revolution take com-

 place, shatter the revisionist line advocating 'ma-

 the sake of revolution, smash the idea of simply

 portion of their household income since 1961
 There is also evidence of steps to increase the
 authority of production brigades in the commune
 structure while reducing that of the lower level
 production teams, which had been the basic

 agricultural planning and accounting units.
 The merging of richer and poorer localities wi
 tend to reduce the income-and incentive to
 work-of the more enterprising peasants and
 production teams. Another scheme being experi-
 mentally implemented, the so-called Tachai work-
 point system, seeks to narrow rural income differ-
 entials and reduce the role of material incentives
 in favor of more political inspiration. A peasant
 would be paid his points for a day's labor on the
 basis of the correctness of his political attitudes as
 well as what he has produced.
 Other programs, such as new health and ed-
 ucational reforms, place additional burdens on
 the production brigades. Under a newly an-
 nounced medical care system, the individual con-
 tributes a token sum toward maintaining health
 services, while the brigade picks up the bulk of
 the cost. Brigades are also taking over the direc-
 tion and most of the financing of former state-run
 primary schools. In these two programs, the state
 saves money, but ultimately the peasant bears a
 greater cost because his individual share of the
 collective income will be sharply reduced.
 It is still uncertain whether the current ex-
 perimentation will result in a "new" system for

 grains. There are some signs that the Maoists are
 again seeking to promote the communes as self.
 sufficient agricultural and industrial units in a
 manner faintly reminiscent of the Great Leap
 period when communes were first introduced. In
 some areas there is also a push to increase the

 self-sufficiency of communes by increasing
 peasant manufacture of farm tools and expanding
 brigade-run "factories." The heavy stress in recent
 propaganda on the need for training "new style
 agrotechnicians" and workers capable of both in-
 dustrial and agricultural jobs also implies that
 communes will be expected to rely less on the
 state and more on themselves for basic goods and
 services.
 There is mounting evidence that the amal-
 gamation of production teams and the efforts to
 establish a new commune system are meeting
 strong peasant resistance. In recent weeks other
 reports have suggested that these institutional
 changes are being accompanied by a campaign, in
 South China at least, to replace entrenched rural
 cadres. Presumably this effort is aimed at creating
 a more activist and responsive rural leadership.
 Tempered in the struggles of the great proletarian
 cultural revolution, town dwellers long divorced
 from labour, have raised their socialist conscious-
 ness greatly. They have come to understand that
 taking no part in productive labour puts burdens
 on the state and is not conducive to the nation's
 socialist construction, nor to reducing the differ-
 encea between town and countryside, nor to re-
 moui'ding their thinking or that of their chil-
 dren. (Peking NCNA, 21 December 1968)
 The strains in the countryside have been
 greatly :.ncreased by large-scale transfers of urban
 dwellers-perhaps as many as 20 million-to rural
 .areas to share work and hardships with the farm-
 ers. This crash program was begun last fall with
 the limited objective of bringing under control
 unruly students and factionalists by assigning
 them to agricultural labor. Since October, the
 program has broadened to include underemployed

 adult city residents and their dependents, profes-
 sional people, administrative and technical cadres,
 and in some cases, even skilled workers. There are
 propaganda claims that as much as one fourth of
 the population of some cities has been sent to la-
 bor in farming and mining communities for an in-
 definite period.
 Peking propaganda asserts that this dispersal
 eases the urban unemployment and food situa-
 tion, but, in fact, it merely transfers these prob-
 lems to already overpopulated rural communities.
 There have been numerous reports of the addi-
 tional burden of feeding these people, of the
 inability and unwillingness of urban emigrants to
 adjust to rural life, and of violent clashes between
 the newcomers and their reluctant hosts. The
 forced emigration confronts already harassed
 provincial authorities with serious administrative
 problems and adds to the burden of maintaining
 public order.                              in
 some communes                   troops are
 being permanent y assigned to keep people in
 line.
 The dispersal to the countryside is also
 highly unpopular in urban areas. The disruption
 of family and work life, the lower standards of
 rural living, and the prospect of a lengthy rustica-
 tion have increased the personal insecurity of city
 residents and sparked both covert and overt forms
 of resistance. Recent provincial broadcasts em-
 phasizing "war preparedness" and the revival of
 the old "liberate Taiwan" theme also suggest that
 local officials are casting about for a justification
 of the dispersions to counter growing public dis-
 affection. Apparently urban officials responsible
 for public security are becoming increasingly con-
 cerned over unauthorized flights back to the cities
 by emigrants who are dissatisfied enough to run
 the risk of stiff prison sentences should they be
 caught. F_                        I the re-
 turnees to one city were so numerous that they
 form a new "criminal" underground.
 Special Report
 Sending the masses of cadres to do manual work
 gives them an excellent opportunity to study
 once again; this should be done by all cadres
 except those who are too old, weak, ill or dis-
 abled. Those who are not working as cadres also
 should go in groups to do manual work. (Peking
 Radio, 4 October 1968)
 The transfer to the countryside of large
 numbers of China's urban cadres-officials who
 manage industry and coordinate the economy-
 reinforces the notion that the Maoists' effort is
 not aimed at economic and social rationalization
 but at social transformation. To serve the over-
 riding goal of maintaining revolutionary fervor
 and creating a truly egalitarian society, the dis-
 tinctions between town and countryside, between
 leaders and led, must be eliminated. There must
 be "better troops and simpler administration"
 and special efforts must be made to prevent the
 growth of a privileged bureaucratic ruling group.
 Consequently, administrative organs and factories
 have been ordered to make wholesale transfers of
 personnel from managerial and technical staffs to
 positions where they work with their hands, in
 effect, to a sort of forced labor camp.
 There is clear evidence that
 some cadres have been given assignments related
 to their skills, and temporarily, at least, most
 cadres may still draw their regular salaries. Many

 Retrenchment and eviction from urban areas
 has sharply undermined cadre morale and built up
 a reservoir of resentment, disillusionment, and
 insecurity. This attitude has not been helped by
 additional injunctions to senior cadres to send
 their children to rural areas. In an apparent effort
 to forestall mounting cadre criticism of the pro-
 gram, People's Daily of 16 January made rare
 mention of the fact that Mao had once sent his
 own son, Mao An-ying, to attend a "labor univer-
 sity" in the countryside in 1945 (An-ying had just
 returned from a school in the USSR). The ob-
 vious implication was that truly revolutionary
 cadres should be only too glad to follow his
 example.
 REVOLUTION IN EDUCATION
 Over the past 19 years, students of philosophy,
 literature, economics, and history have failed to
 change their ideology because they did not go to
 the masses of workers and peasants. So it is
 better for us to send them to work in the fac-
 tories and on the farms. After a period during
 which they are subjected to criticism and strug-
 gled against by the masses, they will sincerely
 integrate themselves with the workers and peas-
 ants, thus ending their alienation from the
 masses. Is there anything wrong with this ap-
 proach? (Wen Hui Pao, 21 December 1968)

 follow Mao's prescriptions for a new China, and

 of social position, are teachers and the 1966,
 1967, and 1968 "graduates" of middle schools
 and universities. Over the past six months, the
 future of most has become highly uncertain as
 they have been caught up in a Maoist revolution
 in education aimed at breaking the hold of "bour-
 geois intellectuals" on China's future generations.
 classes will remain
 suspended in universities nor the next two or
 three years, and all teachers are to be sent to
 teach in farming villages. It is apparent that no
 meaningful education is currently being con-
 ducted above the primary school level, and the
 debate on educational reform begun last summer
 is still going on.
 Since mid-September, 1968, central prop-
 aganda media have been publicizing selected local
 level experiments in schooling as models for edu-
 cational reform. The main features of the reforms
 now being publicized generally follow the desider-
 ata laid down at the beginning of the Cultural
 Revolution: eliminating "bourgeois" control over
 the schools; easing entrance requirements for
 children of workers and poorer peasants; and "re-
 forming" the system of teaching, teaching materi-
 als, and the grading system. A new element is the
 emphasis  on decentralization and efforts to
 minimize central government expenditures. An-
 other innovation is that over-all direction of the
 schools is to be taken out of the hands of profes-
 sional educators and entrusted to committees of
 workers and peasants.
 In the rural areas the financing and staffing
 of schools are in the hands of village-level organi-
 zations. In the towns these functions have fallen
 to local factory and residents' committees-a de-
 velopment which is likely to result in a serious
 lowering of educational standards. In rural areas
 the trend is toward the amalgamation of primary
 and secondary schools, and in urban centers, to-
 ward a reduction of schooling below college level

 Here revolutionary teachers and students work side by

 from 12 to 9 years. At present, it seems that
 truncated secondary schools will remain intact in
 the cities, but in the countryside it appears that
 the former two-year agricultural middle schools
 will be tacked on to the primary schools to pro-
 vide peasant youth with what amounts to seven
 years of education. While the ultimate fate of
 professicnal teachers is being debated, many are
 being sent to labor in rural areas and their places
 taken by semiliterate peasants and workers.
 At this stage, the new system appears to be
 primarily an expression of Mao's "leveling" tend-
 encies, and the net result is likely to be a regres-
 sion in higher education in China-particularly
 since the content of education in the new system
 has been so strongly diluted. The model experi-
 ments described to date place heavy emphasis on
 ideological and basic practical training and very
 little on academic, technical, or advanced train-
 ing. A model school for agrotechnicians in
 Kiangsu, for example, was recently praised be-
 cause most teaching was done while the students
 actually worked at farm tasks, and grading had
 been eliminated in favor of rating students on
 Mao's thought. Secondary education now is sup-
 posed to consist almost entirely of manual labor
 and the study of basic farm or factory practices,
 with a minuscule amount of academic work
 thrown in.
 Graduating students, however, are expected
 to be something more than good laborers. They
 are also supposed to be "activists in the living
 study  and  application of Chairman Mao's
 thought " This commitment to political activism
 is clearly a major goal of the new education.
 Although it is true that Chinese Communist
 schooling has always emphasized ideology and
 indoctriaati.on, the present reduction in academic
 work is musually drastic.

 At the lower levels the Maoist experiments
 in education are designed to produce large num-
 bers of politically reliable vocational youth, who
 will receive at most seven years of education in
 rural areas and nine to ten in cities. The proposed
 system ignores the requirement of preparing stu-
 dents for university. This does not seem to bother
 the Maoists, whose notions about higher educa-
 tion are impractical. According to recent propos-
 als, which apparently are not to be acted upon for
 some time, however, universities will shorten their
 courses to two or three years and recruit their
 student body from politically reliable peasants
 and workers.
 At this stage, there is serious doubt that any
 form of higher education will be resumed soon.
 Universities and even some scientific research in-
 stitutes-except for those directly run by the
 army-are still closed, and there are no signs of
 plans to reopen them. There is also no reliable
 evidence that a large new class of politically quali-
 fied laborers and military men is being prepared
 to enter into advanced training. As a result, it is
 highly likely that China will suffer serious short-
 ages of personnel trained in the modern tech-
 niques that its long-term development requires.
 This problem is compounded because only
 limited efforts are being made to employ produc-
 tively  those  1967-1968 "graduates" whose
 schooling was terminated by the Cultural Revolu-
 tion. At present, nearly all of them must work as
 peasants or in factories for at least one to two
 years. Apparently even some "graduates" in criti-
 cal fields, such as physics, chemistry, and mathe-
 25X1           matics are thus employed.

 In recent months there has
 been some evi ence of a concerted effort to give
 1966 technical graduates-those who completed
 their full schooling-job assignments related to
 their training. Presumably even greater care will
 be taken in the future to obtain appropriate jobs
 for the products of the new university system. At
 this juncture, however, most graduates are still
 being assigned to ordinary labor in farms, fac-
 tories, and mines, or are being sent to reclaim
 THE HIGH COST OF REFORM
 Some people have argued this way: "7f doing a
 good job in revolution can raise production, then
 it can also be said that doing a good job in
 production means doing a good job in revolu-
 tion. " This is a type of logic which reverses right
 and wrong. It is a fallacy to say that revolution
 must show results in production. (Kiangsi Daily,
 23 February 1969)
 Maoist social experiments have already im-
 posed a heavy burden on the nation. Unless their
 more extreme aspects are blunted, they are likely
 to undermine any constructive efforts to initiate
 long-range programs of development. The
 Maoists, of course, offer a variety of rationaliza-
 tions and justifications for their programs. In gen-
 eral, these "reforms" are somehow supposed to
 "unleash" enthusiasm and energy. Forced emigra-
 tion to the countryside is supposed to ease over-
 crowding in the cities and the retrenchment of
 cadres is supposed to break bureaucratic bottle-
 necks and simplify administration. Educational
 reforms are supposed to make schooling more
 egalitarian, more responsive to practical needs,

 T
 and available to more people, especially in rural
 China. The transfer of large numbers of medical
 personnel to the countryside is supposed to meet
 the never before achieved goal of adequate health
 services for the majority of the country's popula-
 tion.
 Such arguments all express legitimate con-
 cerns, but on balance the thrust of the programs
 in their present form appears far more negative
 and destructive than positive. This is immediately
 apparent in such programs as the forced exodus
 to the countryside. Millions of people are being
 thrust upon the communes to be "re-educated"
 by peasants who are already hard pressed. Fur-
 thermore, there is little likelihood that hordes of
 unskilled city dwellers can make a significant con-
 tribution to increasing agricultural production.
 The possibilities of social disorder in such an
 experiment are obvious, and even if the present
 campaign is temporary, it will leave a legacy of
 bitterness and disillusionment.
 The retrenchment of technical and adminis-
 trative cadres is another program that seems to
 serve little rational purpose. It will make opera-
 ting the economy more difficult and probably
 further reduce industrial productivity. Moreover,
 thinning the ranks of both provincial level and
 central ministry personnel on the scale that is
 probably occurring will reduce Peking's ability to
 administer a nation of over 800 million people.
 The high cost of some other Maoist pro-
 grams may seem less obvious. The resumption of
 any education at all after two years of upheaval,
 for example, appears to be a plus. The continua-
 tion of what amounts to an agricultural middle
 school in the countryside and the reliance on
 half-study half-work programs in both rural and
 urban areas is an economical approach and does
 serve to give larger numbers of both adults and
 young people some form of education. A legiti-

 mate question, however, is how much more prac-
 tical training China's agricultural and industrial
 workers need to acquire. While some of the Mao-
 ists' educational goals may be useful in maintain-
 ing an essentially primitive economy, they are
 unlikely to meet China's current and future edu-
 cational needs, especially the need for skilled
 technicians, scientists, engineers, managers, and
 educators..
 Even though Mao recognizes the necessity of
 scientific and technical colleges, his call to return
 their graduates to "labor" after two to three years
 casts doubt on his understanding of advanced
 training. Communist China badly needs rapid
 development in the technical and managerial
 fields, but Maoist prescriptions for higher educa-
 tion-with their calculated anti-intellectualism
 and systematic denigration of teachers and theo-
 retical studies-seem designed to deny China some
 of the tools of modernization. Formal scientific
 and technical training and probably much of the
 research and development work outside of ad-
 vanced weapons programs have already been
 seriously curtailed as a result of the Cultural
 Revolution. This shows that the Maoists will
 make major sacrifices to achieve domestic politi-
 cal and social goals by halting activities which
 even they regard as vital to making China a great
 power.
 One further example serves to point up the
 Maoists' penchant for pushing ill-conceived pro-
 grams regardless of cost. Large numbers of urban
 doctors are now being transferred from the cities
 in response to Mao's instruction: "In medical and
 health work, put the stress on the rural areas."
 Official media have also extensively praised the
 contributions of "barefoot doctors" (peasants
 trained in rudimentary first aid work) in the
 countryside and bragged that more peasants than
 ever before are receiving expert medical attention.
 There is increasing evidence, however, that the

 newly available medical personnel are still too few
 and spread too thin to fulfill the claims made for
 them in offical propaganda.
 To a large degree, then, the primary aim of
 the costly reform programs at this stage appears
 social and political rather than economic. In the
 long run such extreme programs are bound to be
 self-defeating. In the wake of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, China urgently requires more systematic,
 effective planning to make better use of its exist-
 ing and potential resources, but in many respects
 the Maoist programs seem to work in the opposite
 direction. The answer to many of the nation's
 basic problems appears to lie in a managerial
 revolution rather than in another round of politi-
 cal and social revolution.
 PROSPECTS IN 1969
 The policy debate within the regime is likely
 to continue during and after the ninth party con-
 gress. It increasingly appears that the leadership
 may enter and leave the congress still divided on
 key issues. If the congress confirms "conserva-
 tive" provincial power holders and at the same
 time endorses Mao's radical policies, divisions
 within the leadership are likely to be widened,
 and many major issues-on which views are in-
 creasingly polarized-will be unresolved. Thus the
 immediate prospects are for continued pulling
 and hauling in which more pragmatic elements
 attempt to blunt Mao's initiative while his closest
 colleagues attempt to push his radical programs.
 There is little likelihood that those leaders
 who are seeking to end the Cultural Revolution
 can initiate many positive programs of dd'velop-
 ment as long as Mao retains his present capability
 for influencing the course of events. As a result,
 any successor regime to Mao's will have to cope
 with still enormous problems of reconstruction
 while attempting to rule a demoralized and pos-
 sibly fractious nation. The prospects for a new
 regime's success will probably be directly in pro-
 portion to its ability to abandon Mao's revolu-
 tionary dogma in practice and to recognize that
 the contents of his latest programs have O roved
 irrelevant to China's problems.
