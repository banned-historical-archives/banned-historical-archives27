Observaticae_on the_Chinesee Communist Politicrl Establishment 
1. The powers of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party are those 
specified en. Articles 32 reed 34 of its Constitution (passed by the Seventh 
Centres 3 01 Party Representetives, July 1945). and the authority of the Cen-
tral COI lrai ttee to act on lehalf of the Congrees of Party Representatives., by 
virtue of the provision of Article 17 is specified in paragraphs (1) and (3) 
of Artielee 30, In actual practice, the powers of the Central Committee are 
exercised en its name by the Politburo, the Party Secretariat, and the Chair-
man of he Central Committee. The Central Committee normally is only a symt. 
bol of eukteme eathority. When it is in session, the major functions of the 
Central Coomittee are to receive reports mede by the Politburo, decide on 
important matters ef policy, and. elect the members of the Politburo, the 
Secretaey of the S3creteriat, the ministers of the important departmente, and 
the Chaf.rmer of the Central Committee. Any member of the Central Committee 
or any eesponsible personnel of the Central Party Headquarters or of any 
locelity hes, of course, tee right to ma known his views to the Politburo, 
or may he vlimmoned to its meetings to express his views. Actually, the 
Politbueo es able to keep ender its control the plenary sessions of the Cen-
tral Coemietee. Defferences of o,oinion are to be ironed out in the Polit-
buro. t 1ou1d be an indieetion of a serious split among the leaders of 
the IhiLeso Ammanest Parv (CCP) if the individual members of the Central 
Committie bring up direct:; to the plenary session of the ommittee diffeie-
ent elms. if there happen to be two different political reports, or if tee 
diffarert vievsar contaieed in one and the same political report. The 
politicel :report is inveriably prepared by the Politburo to which the plenary 
sesseon of the Central Committee never issues any instruction or makes any 
soggestione ezide ?rom paseingsreeolution to accept the report and have it 
made pullie. The minutes of the sessions of the Central Committee are often 
circulated to the local paoty headquarters, bur rarely mede known to the 
geneeal putlic.

2. Unhealthy factors grafted on differences of opinion that developed in the 
past or are still existing, on provincialist affiliations, or oe sentimental 
ties among the members of the Central Committee are still to be found. But 
these have not developed into factions. Most of the members of the Central 
Committee have been assigned with heavy duties and very few have been left 
idle. The question is whether they have been able to bear the load satis-
factorily, than& the feeling of individual comparative importaace does ex-
ist. Communist Party activities are, however, centered in VtriGUS localit-
ies, *II& have become too powerful for the Central Authorities to exercise 
control very effectively. The Chinese Commurist coutral authors- ties have 
already adopted measures leading towards centralization of power, particu-
larly in the field of economic affairs. Members of the Central Committee 
have become too powerful in various localities. PEG Tehehuei In the North-
west; LIU Poecheng, TNG Heim-ping, and HO Lung in the Southweet; and LIN 
Pim and PING T211-lutt in Central and South China are outstandine examples. 
3. The assignment of duties to the members of the Central Committeo is nor-
mally decided by the Politburo, of which the Chairmen of the Oraanization 
Committee of the Party is a member. Because of his being an important 
member of the Politburo and his knowledge of the actual conditions, he is, 
therefore, in a position to exert a decisive influence over the decisions. 
The appointment or transfer of any member of the Central Committee to or from 
any poet must be accompanied by actual necessity grounded on soend reasons.. 
In order to prevent the congregation of possible opposition fieeres at any 
one place and to prevent the development of any factor of distrust, this 
must he constantly watched by those in charge of the Party orgasization. 
40 The election of the members of the Central Committee, and that cf the 
members of the Politburo, of the Secretary of the Secretariat, end of the 
Chairman of the Central,Committee are always preceded by coneultation a-
mong the most important members of the Committee who would then prepare 
a roster of candidates, which, once agreed upon, is rarely chanced. It 
cannot be called a free election. Election campaigns and mareeveering are not 
tolerated by the Chinese Communists, It is in fact the result cf an a-
greement reached between the leading members. If differences of opinion 
arise in connection with the nomination of candidates, it means that there 
is &split among the Chinese Comnunists. 
5. I have no concrete, detailed information on hand in regard to the organ, 
isation of the CCP central authority. According to what has been inferred, 
the important members of the Politburo are WO Tse-tung, CHU Te, LIU Shaoechli, 
CHOU Enelai, and CHEN Tina MAO is Chairman and LIU Shao-chi le a member 
of the Secretariat of the Central Committee and also Chairman ot the Organ-
ization Committee of the Party. LU Tingel is Vice Chairman of the Committee 
of Culture and Education. LI Li-san, TENG Wen-pin, TSAI Sherg, CHEN Tun, and 
NIEH Jungechen are chairmen or secretaries of various committeee of Labor, 
Youth, Womens Affairs, Economics, and Military Affairs, All leportant in-
structions are given via the Party Secretariat to subordinate perty headquar-
ters. The various departments or committees of Central Party Headquarters 
do not give any instructions to a lower-grade organization under the depart-
ment or committee concerned. They can only give inetructions of a supple-
mentary nature, and most of these have to go through the seereteriat of a 
subordinate party committee. 
6. The Politburo normally has two types of meetings; one it a political-discus-
sion meeting and the other is a meeting on daily routine and on matters of an 
organizational nature. The politidelediscusslon meeting deals with discus-
sions on matters of policy, and sometimes with the passing of previously 
prepared resolutions. Sometimes, reports Imre had to be submitted, with 
relevant supplementary reports, for discussioes, and eventually for forming 
resolutions. Important personnel changes have to be discussed. Meetings 
of an organizational nature deal with matters of daily routtnee requiring 
deliberation or further instructions. They aeso deal with reports on matters 
for record or those the implementation of which dells for study, end per-
sonnel assignments. Normally, the heads of departments or committees are 
responsible for resolutions of secondary importance and the exeeution of 
resolutions, to which the Politburo would inmaty grane les ,t-p-prctral or enuorme-
ment with confidence. The form of the execution of a resolateoe or of the 
transmission of the same are often left to the option of the Secretariat,

the various departments or commtttees or their responsible needs. The 
Politburo normally issues no concrete and detailed orders, nor dee it 
give public instructions. In most caste, CCP members holding responsible 
positions in the Government shell draw up laws end orders according to 
policies already decided on. The CCP merely directs its members or organ-
isations In the Government, but it would not directly send orders to 
Government organimationst 
The Secretariat is the main executive orgen of. the Chinese Commuaist central 
authorities. It executes resolutions passed by the Congress of narty 
Representatives, the Central Committee, and. the Politburo, and handles mat-
ters which arise from time to time. Normally? the ministers and heads of the 
various departments, committees, and the Secretariat alonn era responsible 
personally for the management of various matters of theitaresnective organs. 
At the same time, the Secretariat and the various departments or committees 
have their own intra-office meetings to study measures to be followed and 
proper coordination to be maintained. The various departments and commit-
tees and the Secretariat are headed by Politburo members or by important 
members of the Central Committee. Therefore, the Chinese Comeunist central 
authorAties form a complete whole, the weaknees being that the important 
personalties are much too busy and thnt there is such a number of meetings 
that mast be attended. 
8 The. National Committee, as mentioned. in Article 36, is merely a meeting 
temporary in nature, composed of members of the Provincial Party Commit-
tees, members of Border Region Party Committemin and a portion of the mem-
bers of other Party committees under the direct control of the Central 
authorities. It 14 equivalent to a preparatory meeting of the Meeting of 
Party Representatives, and would in most cases be held before the Meeting 
of the Party Representatives. 
9. If the Politburo convened a Meeting of Party nepresentativec at a time when 
the Congress of Party Representatives could not be brought together end matters 
relating to current policies of the COY were called for discussien, a portion 
on the members of the Central Committee would heve to be elected anew, in 
order to strengthen the solidarity of the CCP, 
IO. Regarding the organisation of the Chinese Comennist supervisory orgen, I 
neve little knowledge of it, and in general, at least a portion of the mem-
bers of the Supervisory Committee would attend regularly to its duties, end 
there ateeorganieatiens for such work. 
11. I have slight knowledge as to whether a system has been sat un for the fi-
nancial administration and auditing of the CCP, However, the CC? so fax 
has had no budget. Normally, existing budgets may be adjusted, or funds raised 
to meet work requirements. Although the methods of administration and au-
diting are not perfect, no major blunders have been experienced. 
12. The Central Bureau or Central Sub-Bureeu of certain regions on the CCP was 
formed during the period when underground activities prevailed. Its organ-
ization was temporary in nature, and the establishment and the ampointment 
of the personnel were decided by the Politburo. Normally, membess of the 
Central Committee in the region concerned, important politican aed military 
personnel who were also CCP members, and important local responsible per-
sonnel were Appointed members of the bureau. The secretary and various de-
partment heads and committee chairmen of such bureaus were also appointed by 
the Politburo. These bureaus or sub-bureaus are branches of the Chinese 
Commanist central authorities, and sometimes their cowers are vary great. 
On condition that they would not contradict decisions of the Ohlmese Commu-
nist central authorities, they may issue all sorts of directtvee, and may 
even submit or recommend different views and eequest amendment to decisions 
of the Chinese Communist central authorities. Their secretertes or import-
ant department heads may participate in the deliberations. ofthe Politburo 
dealing with matters relating to such rngions. These regional central 
bureaus have regular meetings and regular worning organizations. Among 
these regional central bureaus there is normally no coordinaelom or con-
tent, All Provincial Party Committees, and District Party Conmittees are 
regular organs under the Party Central Authority, and they all have elec-
ttre executive committees, and elective standing committees. The regional 
central bureaus, however, do not have such oreans.

13. Standing committeee of provincial, municipAl or district petty eeadquarters 
are composed of members of provincial, municipal, or district Party commit-
tees who are charged with important responsiblities of military) adminis-
trative end civilian bodies. Stnnding committees shell be in the eame of 
the provincial, municipal or district Party committees and will formulate 
decisions and exercise authorities geetified be the Party Constetution. 
14. The Chinese Communiet Public Security Department has been reorgenizing 
the existing police force and training public security personnel in Order 
to form a comeletely relieble eublic security force, At present, in most 
areas, the Chinese Comamnists are still relying on the despateh of regular 
troops and militia to underteke border defame, and nothing is known re-
gerding the formation of epecial border police, or al.:octal petrol unite. 
. There seems to have been no revision made in the reietion of military 
commander and political commissars of the OFTIP rank. In the mejority of 
cases, military commanders enjoy wee powers, and political couatissars are 
equivalent to political Advisers of the military commanders. In a few 
cases, they run parallel; it is very rare for the military commender to be the 
military adviser of a eolitical commissar. There is usually a distinction 
on the part of the soldiers in their admiration or like of thee military 
commanders or politionl commissars. 
16. There seems to be differences in the relations of the commaneert of the var-
imus provincial military districts and other military comnsnaere therein 
and the local party committee secretaries. Flowerer, in general, the provin-
cial military district commanders and commaneers of tht armed forces do 
reepect the supervision of Party heedquartern secretaries tete decisions of 
local Party oommittees on local issues. 
Notes on Chinese Communist Personalities and Party History 
17. In 1926-7, the USSR gave PENG Yu-hziang a military advisory parey and es-
tablished e political department erking In his armies, but roteing hre been 
heard of the offer to despatch Mongelien And Soviet troops tc occupy Peiping. 
lg. Before 193S, MAO Tne-tung had not been to the USSR so the atetrent that MAO 
wee trained in Russia Around 1930 Is not true. 
19. During the Long March, 1934-5, the USSR mnde no promise or hint that aey 
help would. 0 given to the Chine' Communists, beoaase at tet time, 71.0 con-
tacts were maintained. 
20. The statement that Stelin would give fall support to the Chinese Communists!' 
during the Sino-Japanese conflict after 1935 wad not hgve been the hope 
cheriehed by the Chinese Communist leaders, according to py pervonal know-
ledge. 
The preparations for, and the calling of, the Congrese of Party Representa-
tives are really a very heavy end complicated task. The Chereee Communists 
here been in A tense state of war, end so the Eighth Cogre as of' Party 
Representatives ha n not it yet. At tha pretant time, as there be been 
no major difference of opinion among the Chinese Commueists, there is no 
pretsing need for the call of such ft Congress, In case the Korean war ends, 
and in case the land reform could be conplete, when the Chine Communists 
could have a moment of respite and when they vent to more furthmr on to the 
left to purge the democratic clique and parties in the Governert or when 
there Is internal difference of opirdoe, it rteht then be neceeerry to call 
the Eighth Congrees of Party Representatives, 
22. Before 1927, MAO Tee-tuna war, a/so takente or of the advocetos of the CHEN 
Tuehsiu Doctrine. In the period of the Savints and of gnoreille waefare, 
MAO Tteetung wee often regarded as a riahtist by the Chinese Communist den, 
tral authorities, Mdscow not only refused to support MAO, bet claw levelled 
some criticism at him. In 1936-7, LIU Sheo-chi blamed the Chinese Communists 
for having committed !A the past mistakes of extreme :leftist tordeneies but 
no errors of extrema rightism, showing more or less hia disapproval of the 
Communist International. MAO mostly eupported the opinions that LIU had 
eepressed.

lets*. Todny, the Chinese Communist Gonernmeet still possesses many traits of the 
Nationalist Government, including the separation of the Revolationary Mil-
itary Council from the State Administration Council, the impoeition of a 
Political Consultative Conference on top of the State Ministration Coun-
cil. And the introduction of the Central People's Government of the People's 
Republic of China, and the various comeattees, Its economic meesures ere 
comparable to those of the USSR daring the period of New Econemie Policy. 
24. The aim of the present campaign to "suppress nounter-revolutioniste of the 
Chinese Communists centers in the consolidation of Governmentel authority 
and in the preparation for war. The extermination of guerrillas, the erad-
icetion of Nationalist remnants, the suppression of landowners, the shat-
tering of the influence of foreign missions aed schools, and that of the 
underworld gangs., and the mass massacre, all :teed toward this one object-
ive; The land reform and the suppression of ;he counter-revolutionists 
hare already affected in very great extent the Democratic Parties end groups 
and there bare been numerous reactions among the Chinese Communists them-
selves. However, large-scale purge within the Party does not seem to hare come 
as yet. Incessant purge and struggle will intensify from day to day. 
25. Between the years 1935 and 19756, there was a split within the Chenese 
Communist Party, MAO Tseetung and CHOU Enelei led the major portions of 
the First Front Army and went into North Shenei, CHANG Kuo-tao and others 
led the Fourth Front Army and remained in Si-kiang regions. At that time, 
CHU Tess Command Headquarters followed the Fourth ?rent Army. At that per-
iod a portion of the members of the CCP Centrel Committee and the majority 
of the important military end administrative endres supported CHANG Huo-tao. 
CHU Te expressed his willingness to follow the majority. Whee ia 1936 the 
Second Front Army entered Sieklamg regions, HO.,losng was then Commander of 
the said Army e end JEN Pi-shih was its Political Commissar During the 
time when the Chinese Comnunists were working to bring about internal 
cooperation, CHU Te and JEN Pieshih mode it hnown that, as far as military 
operations were concerned, they would accept elle IeMerohip el* CAANO Kuo-tao, 
Chief Political Commissar, and the Central Authorities that he represented. 
As to the internal friction* of the Party, thly wonld try their best to pro-
mote cooperatlon. It was true that at the time. CRU To was deteined and that 
JEN Pieshih rescued him. 
*TEN Pieshih was then the Secretary of the Comiunist Youth Corps. The 
quarrels between the Stalinist Clique and the Trotsky Clique were going 
*n within the Soviet Communist Party, aid then, were also differences. of 
opinion among the personnel of the Communist 7nternational in Hankov. TA 
Lin ), a representative of the Communielt Touthe Internationel, 
Aft a sympathizer of Trotsky, and JEN 14t-shih, being wider his influence, 
had expressed his dissatisfaction over the policy of the Chinese Communist 
Central Authorities. However, none supported hive and his views were even 
taken as childish and laugheble. At the Asgult 7 Meeting, JEN Pieshih 
was, however, regarded as a hero for opposing the CHEN Ta-hsin Deetrine. 
27. .At the present time, the Chinese Communist Central Politburo e led by 1W)
Tse-tung, lau Sheeeohi, CHU Toe CHOU Etelai, UMMF The, Eta.,wita MAO Tse-tung 
and LIU Shalt-chi enjoying power greater than 'he *there.

representatives to stay in Moscow. CRT Chu-pat was elected a 1,isber of 
the Presidium of the Communist International 8nd one of the secretaries of 
the Secretariat of the same organization. CHANG Kuo-tao was elated one of 
the alternate members of the presidium and one of the alternate eeeretaries. 
However, WU Cheeapi was regarded es the repeesentative of the tlindfold 
Doctrine. CHANG Ituo-tao was taken as the representative figure of the Left-
ist Opportunism. 'Besides, TENG Chungehsia twee YU Fei were repreeentatives 
accredited to the Red Labor International. Prom the point of Ifi3W of the

internal' conflict of the CCP, and on the other, to give them chances to correct 
any previous mistekes they committed. 
O. LIN Yu-yin wns one of the leaders of the Htnkow Labor Movement. He was born 
and bred in a poor Denny, and received middle school educatiore He joined 
the CCP early in life, His younger brother, LIN Tu-nan, was ote of the lead-
ing figures of the Communist Party in Hankow They are both on good term 
with CHANG. LIN Ta-nen was killed by the Kuomintang Since 1937, nothing 
hos been heard of LIN Teeying, and he wns probably killed too.

taken to say that he was killed, as revealed by NAG The-tune in his talks with 
Mr. Snow. LI Ta left the Chinese Communiste because he objected to the pol-
icy of 1924 thet CCP members should join the Kuomintane. 
32. Of the biographical record of AN Tsu-wen, I heve no knowledge. He mipht have 
changed his name. 
33. On 20 May 1938, CHANG Ato-tao made public his letter to his countrymen, in 
which he expressed the points of difference in opinion between him and the 
Chinese Communist Central Aathorities, a- well es his own views at the time. 
Later, up to 1947, he was a member of the People's Political Council. Ho 
subsequently becene disillusioned, because he failed in 193S to realize his 
rublication plan, and because his numerous sugpeatione and propels to 
Chiang Kai-Shek's Government were not accepted. In Spring of 1946, hp was 
appointed Director, Kiang:a Regional Office, Chinese Netional Helief end 
Rehabilitktion Administration, but resigned after serving for terse months. 
Iv Inly, 1945, he started "The Chang Tsin Weekly" in Shanghai welch stopped 
rublications in December. In November of the same year,, he left Shanghai 
for Taipei. On 15 May, 1949, he arrived in Hong Kong from Taipei. 
34. During the period when the LI L1-nn line wes in fashion, CHOU En-lei was 
leader of the Chineae Communist Centre/ Authorities. Re avoided conflicts 
with the Comnunist International, and admitted his mistakes. For this re-
son
-
son he was not "liqpidated". 
35. In 1920, the Chinese Communists sent to the USSR a groue of Socialist Touthe 
Corp members who formed a separete China canes in the Eastern University in 
Moscow. LIU Shao-chi was one of the eerliest Soviet-returned student., U 
to 1924, all students proceeding to Nome., for further studies were all sent 
to the Eastern University by the Chinese Comeunists, In 1925, the Sun Tat-sen 
University w-s established in Moscow.' Over a thousand students were sent 
there both by the Kuomintang and by the Chinese Communists, CHEN Shao-yu, 
CHANG Wen-tien, and WANG Chlaehsiang were among those sent. These Chinese 
Comnunist students were mostly selected from among the young Party members 
by the various Provincial Party Committees. CHEN Tun, HSI Tai-yuan, and 
/MING Sheng were all returned students from Resole. LIN Teu-han, TUNG PI-wu, 
HSU T'e-lih, mad YEH Chien-ying attended special classes in the Sun Tat-sen 
University in Moscow. As they had done some sort of work for the CCP before 
they went to Moscow for further studies, the Chinese Commeasts did not take 
them as members of the Soviet-returned-students clique. However, CHIN Shao-yu, 
CHANG Wen-tien, and WANG Chia-Wane started their careers by being returned 
students from Moscow. CHANG Ta-lei perticipated In the Third Congress of the 
Communist International, and CHEN Tu-haiu repreeented the Chinese Communists

Fifth Congress, CH'U Chbu-pal, CHOU Eu-lei, CHANG Eno-tao, nA.1 Ch'ang, end 
others, totalling about twenty, were members of the Chinese Comrunist Dele-
gation to the Sixth Congress. CHEN Sheo-yn, CHEN Yun, EENG Shang, LIN Tu-ying, 
and others represented the Chinese Commnnists at the Seventh Coegress. 
? During the period of cooperation between the Xuomintang and the CCP, MAO Tse-tune: 
did not bear any important responsibility, and therefore, did not share the 
bleme given for "CHEN Ta-hsta Doctrine", In the Soviet guerrilla warfare 
period, MAO Tse-tuxg persieted in his endeavours from the beginning to the 
end, and the army he led was also the greatest single force. During the Sino-
Japanese conflict, MAO Tse-tung scored success for his Anti-Japsaose Unified 
Front Strategy. On the other hadd, the Kuomietang's mistekes were endless, 
thus making it possible for MAO to grow stronger. The success of MAO during 
the Sino-Japanese Conflict was the greatest factor for the building up and 
consolidation of his leadership.

Au important development of the Chinese Communists after its long march was 
the winning over of a good many patriotic educated youths. These youths 
were dissatisfied with the Kuomintang rule, and being slighted and suppressed 
by the Kuomintang, they were really patriotic to their country, though they 
did not know much about Communism. Youths by hundreds of thous-nde entered 
the military and political training schools of the Chinese Communists, one 
after the other. These youths who have gone through the CCP training and 
underground activities, and have now become the important military and 
political cadres of the Chinese Communists, as well as the backbone of the 
various grades of pPrty ?mane of the CM,
