 LEBANON
 Ilyas Sarkis, with strong backing from
 Syria and conservative Christians and
 Muslims, was elected president by Leb-
 anon's parliament last weekend, despite
 last-minute efforts by militant leftists
 to impede the vote. The outcome of the
 balloting was a major setback for left-
 ist coalition leader Kamal Jumblatt, who
 was able to prevent only 29 of the 98
 deputies from participating in the elec-
 tion. Sarkis' victory also gave a much
 needed boost to Syrian policy in Lebanon.
 Jumblatt's failure to disrupt the session
 and  Sarkis'  near  unanimous en-
 dorsement-he received the votes of 66 of
 the 69 deputies in attendance-have had a
 sobering effect on the leftists. They have
 shown some willingness this week to
 cooperate with Sarkis, if not with their
 nemesis, Syria. The Syrians, for their
 part, see Sarkis' strong showing in the
 vote and the endorsements he has since
 received from a broad spectrum of
 Lebanese notables as a vote of confidence
 for Syrian peace efforts and a sign that
 Jumblatt and the leftists are becoming in-
 creasingly isolated.
 Damascus still faces many problems in
 Lebanon, the most pressing of which is
 the smooth transfer of power to the
 president-elect. Ironically, the Christians
 themselves pose the greatest single threat
 to plans for Sarkis' inauguration next
 week.
 On the eve of the election, Christian
 militiamen launched a major offensive in
 the mountains of central Lebanon with a
 view to improving their bargaining posi-
 tion before political negotiations begin.
 The Christians apparently want to secure
 several mountain villages lost earlier so
 that they can create a supply route that
 connects the major Christian city in the
 east with the Christian core area. The
 leftists  have  retaliated  by  escalating
 the fighting in disputed areas of Beirut.
 Despite their failure to make any
 significant territorial gains, the Christians
 have refused to accept a Syrian-brokered
 cease-fire. There is some concern that
 President Franjiyah may delay his
 resignation, thus preventing Sarkis from
 assuming office.
 There are tentative signs that additional
 Syrian troops have moved into Lebanon
 since the election to ensure Sarkis' in-
 auguration. The Syrians remain reluctant
 to use their forces in a way that would in-
 crease animosity among the Lebanese
 toward  their presence and heighten
 Israel's suspicion of Damascus' inten-
 tions. Consequently, Syrian troops have
 been used only to quell disturbances in
 northern Lebanon, where pro-Iraqi
 Palestinians and Lebanese have tried to
 spark new violence. (An estimate of what
 a Sarkis presidency might be like appears
 on page 14).
 ISRAEL
 Tot Aviv WEST BAN ,.~
 The coalition cabinet on May 9 debated
 at length its policy on additional Jewish
 settlements in the occupied territories. In
 the end, a compromise resolution was
 adopted that averted a possible immediate
 government  crisis  but  left  politically
 troublesome basic issues unresolved.
 Prime Minister Rabin's government
 committed itself to the debate last
 December when the extremist Gush
 Emunim  religious  settlement  group
 sought to establish a settlement near
 Sebastia in Samaria without government
 approval. Over 100 squatters were per-
 mitted to remain at an Israeli army camp
 at  nearby  Qadum  pending       the
 government's review of its overall settle-
 ment policy. The resolution adopted last
 weekend-without the support of two
 coalition parties-stated that no perma-
 nent settlement is to be established at
 Qadum. The resolution reaffirmed,
 however, the government's commitment
 to set up additional settlements elsewhere
 in the occupied territories.
 The cabinet decided that it would offer
 the settlers a new site, but deferred a deci-
 sion on the explosive issue of where that25X1
 might be. The settlers are demanding
 another site in Samaria. They hope to
 force the government to modify its
 long-held policy of prohibiting Jewish
 settlements in that region, which is heavily
 populated by Arabs. The government has
 promised to reach a decision soon.
 Rabin's coalition cabinet remains
 divided on the issue. The struggle is essen-
 tially between those who assert that Jews
 should be allowed to settle anywhere in
 the traditional "Land of Israel," including
 the West Bank, and those who want to
 limit settlements to strategically impor-
 tant locations in order to leave open the
 option of territorial compromise in peace
 negotiations with the Arabs. Rabin, sup-
 ported by a cabinet majority, favors the
 latter approach.
 The conservative National Religious
 Party, supported to some extent by Labor
 Party conservatives such as Defense
 Minister Peres, argues that no part of the
 West Bank should be subject to a blanket
 prohibition against Jewish settlements.
 This position is strongly opposed by the
 coalition's left-wing Mapam Party, which
 believes that any additional West Bank
 settlements only serve to undercut efforts
 to  reach  a  peace  agreement.

 USSR-EGYPT
 Since the signing of the annual Egyp-
 tian-Soviet trade protocol late last month,
 Moscow and Cairo have taken additional
 steps to ease the strain in their relations.
 The  Egyptians made the unusual
 gesture of sending Minister of War
 Gamasy to Moscow for the funeral of
 Marshal Grechko, ended their strident an-
 ti-Soviet propaganda campaign, and have
 not followed through on President Sadat's
 threat  to  publish  Soviet-Egyptian
 diplomatic correspondence detrimental to
 Moscow.
 The Soviets reciprocated by giving
 Gamasy a cordial reception and by ceas-
 ing much of their polemics against Cairo.
 They have even replayed Egyptian com-
 ments that despite the "mistakes" that led
 to abrogation of the Soviet-Egyptian
 friendship treaty, relations should be
 "protected and preserved."
 These  developments  indicate  that
 cooler heads have prevailed and that both
 Moscow and Cairo want to prevent a con-
 tinuing downward spiral in relations.
 C. Rs
 So far, the resumed Egyptian-Soviet
 dialogue has been confined largely to at-
 mospherics. Gamasy had no substantive
 conversations in Moscow, and Soviet
 Ambassador Polyakov's two recent talks
 with Fahmi appear not to have gone
 beyond a general discussion of a Middle
 East settlement.
 The Kremlin is presumably still angry
 about Sadat's humiliating decision to an-
 nul the treaty and his subsequent moves to
 improve relations with Peking. Sadat has
 displayed no inclination to make any
 political concessions to Moscow that
 would be prerequisite to a significant im-
 provement in relations. He remains con-
 vinced that Moscow will pull no punches
 in seeking to break his hold on power in
 Egypt.
 As long as the underlying suspicion and
 antagonism prevail, it seems that the most
 Cairo and Moscow can hope for is the es-
 tablishment of more businesslike relations
 and a muting of open hostility.
 Foreign Minister Fahmi

 PAKISTAN
 Afghanistan's invitation last week to
 Pakistani Prime Minister Bhutto to visit
 Kabul, and Bhutto's acceptance, are the
 latest signs that relations between the two
 countries are improving. The visit may
 take place next month.
 Relations  have been  poor since
 Mohammad Daoud came to power in
 Kabul in  1973 and sharply increased
 Afghan agitation on the Pushtunistan
 issue, a long-standing territorial dispute
 between the two countries.
 Last month the Pakistanis pledged
 some $I million in food and other relief
 assistance for victims of a recent earth-
 quake and flooding in Afghanistan. They
 also suspended propaganda against the
 Daoud regime. The Afghans responded by
 easing their anti-Pakistan propaganda.
 These developments followed a
 Pakistani initiative to ease tensions with
 India, Pakistan's other regional adversary
 and a supporter of the Daoud govern-
 ment. In late March, Bhutto wrote to In-
 dia's Prime Minister Gandhi offering to
 withdraw a five-year-old Pakistani claim
 against India before the International
 Civil  Aviation  Organization.  Bhutto's
 letter opened the way for an agreement to
 hold a new round of talks on various In-
 do-Pakistani issues, including possible
 restoration of diplomatic relations, which
 were suspended during the  1971      In-
 do-Pakistani war. The talks began on
 May 12 with the arrival in Islamabad of
 an Indian team led by Foreign Secretary
 Mehta.
 1hutto's interest in reducing tensions
 with his Indian and Afghan neighbors
 may have been stimulated by recent signs
 of a modest improvement in India's frosty
 relationship with China, which Pakistan
 has long viewed as its primary big-power
 supporter.  Daoud, for his part, may
 believe that the nascent thaw between In-
 dia and Pakistan increases Afghanistan's
 need to reduce friction with Pakistan,
 which is stronger militarily.
 Even though both countries appear in-
 terested in lessening tensions, neither
 seems prepared to make basic concessions

 on the Pushtunistan issue. Afghanistan
 has maintained its position that the two
 Pakistani border provinces inhabited by
 the Pushtun and Baluchi ethnic groups
 should be granted self-determination or
 greater autonomy  by  Islamabad;  the
 Pakistanis reject this view.
 parallel the border of the Ovambo tribal
 homeland, is intended to help counter
 sporadic  cross-border  incursions  by
 Namibian nationalist guerrillas belonging
 to the South-West African Peoples'
 Organization who are operating from
 Angola.
 Since last August a series of small-scale
 terrorist attacks in northern Namibia,
 which the South Africans blame on
 SWAPO guerrillas, has resulted in the
 killing of at least 17 Ovambo tribesmen
 and the abduction of 21 others. The South
 Africans fear that Namibian guerrillas
 will receive increasing aid from the
 Popular  Movement  government  in
 Angola, or from the Cuban contingents
 helping Agostinho Neto's regime to con-
 solidate its control over southern Angola.
 Neto's future support for SWAPO will
 probably be tempered by fears of South
 African  military reprisals,  and by
 Angola's need for South African par-
 ticipation in completing the important
 Cunene   hydroelectric project.
 Nevertheless, international backing for
 SWAPO insurgency is likely to grow as
 long as Pretoria tries to maintain its con-
 trol of Namibia in defiance of the UN and
 the Organization of African Unity.
 On the other hand, the effectiveness of
 the insurgency may be impeded by
 quarreling among the Namibian exiles. In
 Zambia, where SWAPO has maintained
 bases since 1966, government authorities
 recently announced that a number of
 SWAPO officials had been placed under
 "protective custody."  In addition, 41
 SWAPO guerrillas based in Zambia have
 reportedly been detained.
 South African authorities have an-
 nounced that a security buffer zone one
 kilometer in depth is being established
 along part of Namibia's border with
 Angola. The buffer zone, which is to

 The Zambians probably also fear that
 an open split among SWAPO leaders
 might lead to competing bids for Chinese
 and Soviet support. In the past SWAPO
 has received token aid from both Peking
 and  Moscow as well as the OAU.

 The campaign for Italy's parliamentary
 election on June 20 is getting under way.
 The parties are now drawing up candidate
 lists, which must be submitted by May 19.
 The Christian Democrats and Com-
 munists, in particular, are attempting to
 broaden their appeal by including some
 "new faces" among their candidates. The
 Communists,  for example, have per-
 suaded some prominent Catholic intellec-
 tuals and a retired air force general to run
 on their lists for the Senate. The Christian
 Democrats' most impressive catch so far
 is Umberto Agnelli, managing director25X1
 Fiat and brother of Fiat chairman
 Giovanni Agnelli. The latter, Italy's most
 influential industrialist, has so far resisted
 attempts  by  the  fiscally conservative
 Republican Party to enlist him as a can-
 didate.
 The parties are still developing their
 platforms. Preliminary comments by
 Prime Minister Moro and Socialist leader
 De Martino indicate that campaign
 debate will center on whether or not to
 grant the Communist Party a role in the

 Moro asserted that his Christian
 Democrats remain the "central axis" of
 Italian democracy and implied that in-
 creased Communist influence would
 threaten Italian liberties. De Martino,
 meanwhile, has ridiculed the Christian
 Democrats for continuing to insist that
 the Communists should not be in the
 government, while at the same time show-
 ing a willingness to negotiate government
 programs with them-something Moro
 seemed ready  to do before his govern-
 ment fell on April 30.
 The Communists got a jump on cam-

 some difficult tactical problems
 themselves. The principal one is how to
 balance an attack on the Christian
 Democrats with continued defense of

 To increase the inflow of foreign ex-
 change, Rome has imposed additional ex-
 port financing rules and currency con-
 trols. Exporters are now required to ob-
 tain 30 percent of the value of any export
 credit in foreign c. irrencies. Furthermore,
 all foreign currency receipts must becon-
 verted into lira within seven days of ac-

 prohibited short-term lira loans to foreign
 banks as a way of stemming speculation.
 Italy's trade account has begun to
 deteriorate badly. The first quarter trade
 deficit this year-$1.5 billion-was dou-

 Past devaluations have driven up import
 prices, and nervous businessmen have
 used the trade account to hide capital
 flight by padding import invoices. The
 new plan would make this practice less
 profitable.
 Rome apparently plans to supplement
 its defense of the lira with intervention in
 exchange markets to moderate swings in
 the lira's value. Italy will ask the EC for a
 new  short-term  loan of up to $1
 billion-already  approved  in  prin-

 national election of June 20 and 21.
 The import deposit plan requires im-
 porters and others dealing in foreign ex-
 change to deposit half the value of their
 foreign purchases in noninterest-bearing
 accounts at the central bank for three
 months. Imports financed by external
 borrowing are exempt from this deposit
 requirement. This restriction, besides dis-
 couraging the outflow of foreign ex-
 change, should sop up domestic liquidity
 and help reduce the money supply. The
 blocking of funds on such a major scale,
 however, may exert further pressure on
 bank interest rates-already at 15 percent
 and more-and increase the financial
 problems of small businessmen.
 If importers can secure necessary finan-
 cing, the deposit plan is likely to have only
 a limited effect on trading patterns. Its
 low carrying charges will boost prices of
 foreign goods only marginally. Imports
 from the US would be less affected than
 others because wheat purchases-a sub-
 stantial share of Italian imports from the
 Democratic Center are also backing
 E:anes, and that the Socialists do not plan
 to join them in a coalition government
 this summer.
 Eanes, a 41-year-old infantry officer,
 still has not made a formal announcement
 of his candidacy, but he is expected to this
 weekend. He has spent the past week
 soliciting the views of military colleagues
 at bases throughout the country.
 A decision by Azevedo-a career naval
 officer-to throw his hat into the ring
 could result in a split in loyalties in the
 armed forces. Many Portuguese civilians
 and military officers believe, however,
 that a second viable candidate is impor-
 tant. Should General Eanes run unop-
 prove a liability.

 General Secretary Brezhnev's military
 promotion to Marshal of the Soviet
 Union may have been prompted by a
 desire to reassure the population that,
 although a civilian had been named to
 replace Grechko, the person in ultimate
 charge is the "experienced" Brezhnev.
 Over the last few years there has been a
 considerable effort to build up Brezhnev's
 war record, even though as political of-
 ficer, he played only a minor combat role.
 Last year, he was honored with a promo-
 tion to general of the army. His latest
 promotion may have also been intended
 to reassure the military that Brezhnev-as
 Marshal of the Soviet Union and chair-
 man of the USSR Defense Council-will
 look after the interests of the armed
 forces.
 The next step in enhancing Brezhnev's
 role as military leader could be some
 public recognition that he is commander
 of the armed forces in peacetime. At the
 moment he is apparently designated to act
 as Supreme Commander in Chief only in
 the event of war. This arrangement was
 probably acceptable both to the political
 leadership and the military hierarchy so
 long as a professional soldier headed the
 Defense Ministry. The appointment of
 Ustinov,  however, may prompt the
 military to argue more strongly for the
 creation of a unified, military-political
 command with Brezhnev or his successor
 as Supreme Commander in Chief.
 Since Brezhnev's promotion, Soviet
 publications have been full of praise for
 him as a political and military leader. Re-
 cent speeches by Brezhnev's Politburo
 colleagues Podgorny and Shcherbitsky
 have emphasized that Brezhnev's life and
 work have been closely associated with
 the armed forces.
 The rank of Marshal of the Soviet
 Union, created in 1935, is the second
 highest rank in the Soviet military.
 Generalissimo is the highest, but Stalin is
 the only one who has held that rank. In
 addition to Brezhnev, three professional
 military officers on active duty are
 Marshals  of the  Soviet  Union.
 Tension increased over the past week
 following a series of new incidents
 between the Icelandic coast guard and
 British protection vessels. Unless a new
 fishing agreement is reached soon, public
 sentiment in Iceland against the US-
 manned base at Keflavik, as well as
 against  the country's  membership in
 NATO, will mount.
 London ordered its protection vessels to
 modify their tactics against the Icelandic
 patrol boats three week ago. Iceland did
 not relax its tactics, however, and several
 British trawlers lost expensive gear. On
 May 4, some of the trawlers threatened to
 leave the area permanently unless London
 authorized better naval protection. The
 next day, the trawlers returned, and this
 time the British protection vessels en-
 gaged the Icelandic patrol boats. Within
 a few hours, ships on both sides sus-
 tained crippling damage.
 Officials of the Progressive Party-the
 junior partner in the two-party Icelandic
 coalition-last weekend attacked the US
 and NATO for failure to support Iceland.
 After a strongly worded speech by party
 chairman and former prime minister
 Olafur Johannesson, the party's central
 committee on May 8 issued a resolution
 citing the "difficulty" for Iceland of con-
 tinued cooperation with NATO and urg-
 ing the US not to take the Keflavik base
 "for granted." Johannesson's criticism of
 the US stemmed this time from the deci-
 sion not to lend or lease Iceland fast
 patrol boats.
 Two days later, Foreign Minister
 Agustsson-also of the Progressive Par-
 ty-suggested publicly that he might
 boycott the NATO ministerial meeting
 next week. He added that Iceland could
 close the base, "which Iceland does not
 need," and still remain a member of
 NATO.
 In private, Agustsson has told the US
 charge that he could offer some "slight
 hope for a settlement' next week," after
 parliament adjourns. He warned that a
 settlement must be reached soon if the
 "common interests of all of us are not to
 be damaged."
 Agustsson's tough  public stance
 presumably reflects his party's attitude,
 while his private willingness to com-
 promise could signal the government's in-
 tention to try to end the dispute soon. Any
 quick agreement at this time, however,
 would tend to vindicate  London's
 aggressive tactics at sea, and a week or
 two of cooling off might be necessary
 before a settlement could be reached.

 FRANCE
 The French Ministry of Defense has
 proposed a five-year military spending
 plan that calls for a record defense budget
 of almost $12.5 billion in 1977, up about
 16 percent from this year's budget.
 The plan was approved by the Council
 of Ministers on May 5 and is to be for-
 mally presented to the National Assembly
 later this month. Military spending under
 the plan will continue to increase an
 average of almost 15 percent a year dur-
 ing the next five years. At this rate, the
 defense budget would be almost $25
 billion by 1982-about one fifth of the
 projected national budget.
 These increases reflect the trend in
 French defense policy toward moder-
 nizing the navy and creating stronger,
 more flexible conventional forces. Under
 the five-year plan, France's tactical and
 strategic nuclear forces-with the excep-
 tion of the strategic bombers-will con-
 tinue to be given priority attention, but
 the conventional forces will receive a
 larger share of the defense budget than in
 25X1 the past. The increased allocation to con-
 ventional forces will be used, in part, to
 enhance their capability to respond to
 crisis in areas of key interest, such as the
 Mediterranean region.
 The plan reportedly calls for acquiring
 during the next five years:
 ? A large number of new AMX-10
 RC armored vehicles and additional
 AMX-30 medium tanks.
 ? Some 200 Jaguar fighter bombers
 and Alpha Jet ground attack aircraft.
 ? A number of Super Etendard air-
 craft capable of delivering nuclear
 weapons for the navy.
 ? The first 4 of 20 nuclear-powered
 attack submarines.
 ? The country's  first  nuclear-
 powered helicopter carrier.
 ? A  sixth  ballistic-missile sub-
 marine.
 The Ministry of Defense also an-
 nounced that the number of men and
 command levels in the army will be re-
 duced in an attempt to make that force
 more efficient. The one-year conscrip-
 tion system will be retained, however, de-
 spite its growing unpopularity within the
 country
 The situation in China remains tense in
 the wake of the Peking riots of April 5
 and Teng Hsiao-ping's ouster. The party's
 left wing would like to continue its offen-
 sive-especially while Chairman Mao is
 still alive-by purging other unnamed
 "capitalist roaders" who supported Teng.
 Party moderates thus far have managed
 to keep the lid on.
 The left continues to dominate the
 propaganda and has escalated its attacks
 on Teng.  It has branded him a
 "conspirator,"  implying  that he had
 collaborators whom the left would like to
 remove. At least one broadcast has
 argued for Teng's removal from the party.
 Several others have gone well beyond
 criticism of Teng, calling for expanding
 the campaign to include other capitalist
 roaders still in power in the party.

 Teng's removal was not a popular step,
 and word of disaffection within the
 general populace and on the part of some
 provincial leaders continues to filter out
 of China. Concern that this dissatisfaction
 may result in further violence, such as the
 explosion outside the Soviet embassy in
 late April, is evident in the propaganda
 against   "counterrevolutionaries"-a
 codeword for perpetrators of civil dis-
 order-and in heightened security
 measures in Peking.
 Despite their show of unity on May
 Day, Chinese leaders seem to be making
 no secret of the divisions among them.
 Three leading moderates appear to have
 boycotted a reception on April 26, at-
 tended by the rest of the leadership, to
 honor those who put down the Peking
 disturbances. The reception seemed a
 symbolic act to underline the militant
 suppression of pro-Teng sentiment at the
 riot of April 5, but it has not received
 much propaganda play.
 It is far from certain that the left can
 carry out a wide-scale purge. Given the
 Poster at recent Canton fair
 sullen mood throughout the country, and
 especially  the  feeling  the  anti-Teng
 campaign is besmirching the memory of
 Chou En-lai, a massive effort to root out
 Teng's supporters could well prompt a
 new and larger round of political turmoil.
 This is something that leaders of all
 political stripes would like to avoid.
 For the moment, the left has been un-
 able to translate its rhetoric into action.
 The bitterness caused by Teng's removal
 suggests that the current stalemate cannot
 hold indefinitely and will give way to
 another major leadership struggle before
 some degree of stability in the upper ranks
 of the  party  can  be  achieved.

 for the latest Soviet effort to foster im-

 regimes of Indochina. The USSR enjoys
 relatively little influence elsewhere in
 Southeast Asia and hopes to profit from
 the problems confronting China in its
 relations with Vietnam and Laos.
 Kaysone's trip was successful, even
 though long on ceremony and short on
 substance. The major economic aid agree-
 ment between the two countries for
 1976-77 was signed last January, and
 Kaysone spent most of his time touring
 the USSR. The visit nevertheless resulted
 in four new agreements and a com-
 munique confirming that Vientiane-like
 Hanoi-is  presently friendlier toward
 Moscow than it is toward Peking.
 In the communique, the Lao endorsed a
 number of Soviet positions on inter-
 national communist and foreign policy
 issues. For example, they accepted the
 current Soviet formula on Asian security.
 In endorsing the Soviet call for Asian

 Lao moved a step ahead of their mentors
 in Hanoi. This will not sit well with the
 Chinese, who maintain that the Soviet
 Asian security proposal is aimed at
 developing a pro-Soviet alliance on
 China's borders.
 Before Kaysone's visit, the Soviets had
 sent Deputy Premier Arkhipov to Hanoi
 to follow up on the aid commitments
 Moscow made last fall during North Viet-
 namese party leader Le Duan's state visit
 to the USSR. Arkhipov attended the third
 session of the Soviet-Vietnamese joint
 economic commission and signed a new
 protocol on aid and trade.
 Moscow is also continuing its courtship
 of the Cambodian Communists. Soviet
 leaders sent congratulatory messages to
 their Cambodian counterparts when their
 party and government assignments were
 formally announced in mid-April. Cam-
 bodia, which had previously ignored such
 messages, this time responded to the
 Soviet greetings.
 One Soviet official, presumably en-
 couraged by this show of courtesy by
 Phnom  Penh,  subsequently said  that
 Moscow expected to reopen its embassy
 in Phnom Penh soon and had already
 selected an ambassador. Other Soviet of-
 ficials,                 however,  are     pessimistic.
 ARGENTINA
 The trust and confidence engendered by
 the military junta's politically neutral,
 businesslike approach to governing are
 beginning to give way to concern over ar-
 bitrary security practices and over Presi-
 dent Videla's seemingly unsteady grasp on
 his authority.
 Members of major unions and political
 parties have expressed fear about the im-
 plications of recent widespread arrests
 and take-overs of unions the government
 had pledged not to touch. Their impres-
 sion that local military commanders are
 operating  without-or  perhaps
 despite-central direction is shared by
 likely to lead to strict curbs on Malaysian
 counterterrorist activities inside Thailand.
 that the way will be cleared for implemen-
 ting its broad range of policies.
 Meanwhile, however, Videla's low-key
 style and lack of aggressiveness have con-
 tributed to independent behavior by local
 commanders and to interservice competi-
 tion. Proponents of harsher security
 measures  take the President's mild
 manner as an invitation to do things their
 own way. At some point soon, Videla will
 be obliged to assert his authority by rein-
 ing in officers operating counter to his
 wishes. His failure to do so would cost the
 junta the favorable image it has managed
 to create abroad as well as the popular
 support that gives the government
 leverage against the terrorists and other
 domestic problems.
 The new Seni government, in office
 only two weeks, is already moving
 decisively and effectively to resolve
 several potentially troublesome issues.
 Within days of winning a lopsided vote
 of confidence in the National Assembly,
 Seni announced a shake-up of the armed
 forces high command that has won high
 praise from most senior military officers.
 Seni inherited an army leadership em-
 bittered by efforts of Deputy Prime
 Minister Praman, in his former capacity
 as defense minister, to increase his in-
 fluence in the army by ignoring
 traditional promotion channels and ap-
 pointing his own men to key positions.
 Seni has now pushed aside those generals
 loyal to Praman, strengthening his own
 position within the military, while
 weakening,  at  least temporarily,
 Praman's political base.
 Within the past week Seni's foreign
 minister, Phichai Rattakun, signaled his
 intention to continue an  increasingly
 nationalistic Thai foreign policy. In
 response to public outcries over a Malay-
 sian military operation against local in-
 surgents that spilled over into Thailand,
 Phichai delivered a toughly worded note
 to the Malaysian ambassador that seems
 journalists. Indications are that the three
 services are working at cross purposes.
 The navy, for example, has failed to honor
 Videla's request for a comprehensive list
 of prisoners it is holding. Videla has
 reportedly encountered opposition from
 navy chief Admiral Massera, a fellow jun-
 ta member.
 Videla has been preoccupied with
 creating   the   impression   of
 evenhandedness toward business and
 labor. To soften the impact of the junta's
 pro-business economic  policy, Videla
 decreed across-the-board wage hikes and
 arrested a number of businessmen ac-
 cused of price gouging. He evidently sees
 his immediate prime task as convincing
 the country of the junta's good faith, so

 The Spanish government is advancing the pace of its
 reform program, but still faces the problem of proceeding fast
 enough to placate the left without provoking a rightist
 backlash.
 Spain: Prospects for Reform
 The Spanish government, largely in
 response to increasingly vocal opposition
 from the left, is moving forward on its
 program to liberalize the system inherited
 from Franco.
 In the six months since Franco's death,
 King Juan Carlos and the government
 headed by Prime Minister Arias have
 created a freer atmosphere, but they have
 been slow in developing and publicizing
 plans for changing the basic political
 structure.
 Prime Minister Arias finally laid out a
 timetable for reform in his speech on
 April 28. Arias' imprecise outline of the
 government's plan did little to quiet the
 opposition, however, and the government
 last week began to flesh out the bare
 bones program he announced. Indeed, the
 proposals for the referendum to be held
 next October, as approved by the cabinet
 last Friday, go further than Arias had
 seemed to promise in his speech.
 In other gestures toward a more open
 political system, King Juan Carlos has
 been consulting with opposition leaders,
 the government has released several
 well-known Communists arrested last
 month, and it has promised to free all
 remaining political prisoners soon.
 The Reform Program
 The government has chosen to follow a
 path of gradual change and to push its
 program through the rightist-dominated
 Cortes-Spain's parliament-in the hope
 the legislators will go along as they
 become exposed to the pressures for
 reform. The government's strategy is to
 retain as much of the form of Franco's
 system as possible. Even major changes
 are couched  in corporate-state ter-
 minology-legislators are referred to as
 Prime Minister Arias (1) with King Juan Carlos *4 p
 "family representatives," and political
 parties as associations.
 More than just the rhetoric of the cor-
 porate state will be retained. The referen-
 dum will call for a bicameral legislature in
 which the 300 "family representatives" of
 the lower house will be selected by univer-

 sal suffrage, but the upper house will
 represent interest groups as does the pre-
 sent Cortes.
 Initially, the government was reported
 to favor a proposal calling for the upper
 house to be selected through indirect elec-
 tions, but this drew the immediate fire of
 the opposition. Socialist leader Felipe
 Gonzalez threatened to boycott the
 referendum.
 Reformist cabinet ministers led by
 Interior Minister Fraga and  Foreign
 Minister Areilza apparently won some
 concessions last week. The government's
 proposal now calls for an upper house of
 285 members, of whom 200 will be direct-
 ly elected from lists drawn up by
 municipal and provincial councils and
 labor unions. Twenty-five of the senators
 are to be appointed by the king, 20 chosen
 by professional groups, and 40 members
 of the current Cortes, appointed for life by
 /tee e+o rAe.?RrAm2
 Franco, will be retained.
 Questions still remain whether the up-
 per house will have equal power with the
 lower house and to what extent the
 government will be responsible to a
 parliamentary majority. Neither the con-
 stitution nor the government's explana-
 tion of its referendum proposal appears to
 establish a traditional parliamentary
 system.
 The referendum will also provide an in-
 direct test of popular sentiment about the
 monarchy. The question to be voted will
 propose lowering the minimum age of the
 King's successor from 30 to 18 and per-
 mitting women to accede to the throne.
 The wording of the government's
 proposal for a consultative economic and
 social council is being interpreted as es-
 tablishing the right of labor to organize
 separately  from  management.  The
 current Spanish syndical system merges
 both into the same organization. This
 appears to be a government concession to
 the opposition, which had been upset that
 labor reform was not to be included in the
 referendum.
 Other aspects of the government's
 reform package are to be handled only as
 simple legislation. An election law ex-
 tending suffrage will be submitted within
 a few weeks, and draft laws lifting the
 restrictions on freedom of assembly and
 organization of political parties have
 already been sent to the Cortes.
 Reform advocates are convinced that
 the government has sufficient influence to
 get its proposals passed. To reduce the op-
 portunity for rightist obstruction, Arias
 has invoked "urgency procedures" requir-
 ing the Cortes to act within 25 days.
 Objections from the Left
 The opposition remains skeptical,
 however, that reforms can be made from
 within a system in which the right wing is
 so  entrenched.  Principal  opposition
 leaders are thus unwilling to be seen as
 cooperating with the government, at least
 until there has been some significant
 progress.
 Government hopes of luring most of the
 opposition into full political participation
 are complicated by the troublesome ques-
 tion of the Communist Party. The one
 issue on which even the more democratic-
 minded members of the government
 refuse to budge is the left's demand for the
 legalization of the Communist Party.
 They fear legalization would provoke the
 right and cause the military to intervene.
 Major opposition groups, like the
 Socialist Workers Party and leftist Chris-
 tian Democratic factions, have recently
 aligned themselves with the Communists
 in a political alliance called the
 Democratic Coordination. These groups,
 and especially Socialist Workers' leader
 Gonzalez, believe the Communists' long
 opposition to Franco and the pragmatic
 political positions they now espouse earn
 them a legitimate claim to political par-
 ticipation.
 The democratic opposition groups are
 willing to work with the Communists
 because they believe:
 ? That a tactical alliance of all op-
 position groups is the only way to
 mount sufficient pressure for reform.
 ? That the Communists can best be
 contained through open competition
 that will expose their limited popular
 support.

 ? That operating freely will rein-
 force any democratic trends that may
 exist within the Communist Party.
 Despite many impediments to coopera-
 tion between the opposition and the
 government, there are indications that the
 democratic left may yet have a positive
 role to play. There are increasing contacts
 between the two, highlighted most recent-
 ly by King Juan Carlos' discussion with
 Jose Maria Gil Robles, who last month
 led his Christian Democratic faction into
 the Democratic Coordination alliance.
 Such contacts could evolve into a
 dialogue.
 Odds of the Gamble
 Spain's economic progress in recent
 years has given most Spaniards a sense of
 having a stake in the system, an attitude
 that cuts across class lines. There is no
 large, disenchanted group of people eager-
 ly awaiting a revolution.
 Even at the height of the leftist-spon-
 sored strikes and demonstrations a few
 weeks ago, the workers' protests appeared
 to be primarily over economic issues. The
 Communists and Socialists are strong in
 the labor movement but have had little
 success so far in interesting the workers in
 political issues.
 Polls this year suggest that most
 Spaniards favor the government's ap-
 proach to reform and support the King.
 At the same time, however, the polls show
 a desire to move faster to liberalize the
 system.
 The government has been slow to
 capitalize on this latent support. Efforts
 are only now getting under way to form
 centrist parties that would draw support
 from the middle class and provide a
 bridge between pro-government groups
 and the opposition. Opposition Christian
 Democratic leaders are talking with
 pro-government groups, and if they can be
 persuaded to support the government's
 program, the Socialists might reconsider
 their  threat  to  boycott  the
 government-sponsored referendum and
 elections to the bicameral legislature.
 To gain active support from the center,
 however, the government must show some
 concrete achievements soon, although ef-
 forts to speed change would further
 energize the right and jeopardize govern-
 ment unity.
 Arias  has  been  accused  of foot-
 dragging by reformists in the cabinet, and
 even Juan Carlos is said to have lost his
 patience with the Prime Minister's reluc-
 tance to take a leadership role.
 An attempt to replace Arias could
 bring the King into direct confrontation
 with the right-something he has avoided
 so far. He backed off from an earlier no-
 tion to replace Arias in the belief that the
 Francoist majority in the Council of the
 Realm-which is constitutionally charged
 with   nominating   the   prime
 minister-would give him a slate of un-
 acceptable candidates to choose from.
 Should Arias continue to be seen as an
 impediment to reform, the King might
 have no choice but to try to strong-arm
 the Council into putting his candidate on
 the three-man list. The King might also be
 forced to take a tougher stance if the
 Cortes stymies his reform program. Some
 thought has already been given to taking
 the entire reform program to the people in
 The Communist Party is working hard to persuade voters
 that its participation in policy making is essential for economic
 stability. Party economists have been proposing a number of
 nondoctrinaire solutions to Italy's economic woes, many of
 them close to those advocated by center-left parties.
 Italy: Communists' Economic Proposals
 The Italian Communist Party is work-
 ing hard to convince voters in the national
 election next month that its participation
 in policy making is essential for economic
 stability.
 Economic proposals that have been
 made by party experts largely provide
 nondoctrinaire solutions to Italy's im-
 mediate problems.  Many of the
 proposals, particularly on fiscal matters,
 are close to those advocated by center-left
 parties.  The  Communist  program,
 nevertheless, is carefully contrived to
 protect worker income and reduce Italy's
 economic dependence on the West.
 The Communists are vague about their
 longer term economic goals. Party chief
 Enrico Berlinguer talks of a system of
 "democratic  planning,"  but what he
 means by this has never been defined.

 The Communists see an equilibrium in

 immediate economic goal. To relieve
 pressure on the lira, they recommend
 tighter controls over speculative financial
 flight and over foreign exchange
 payments. The party wants the EC to
 grant Italy authority to establish import
 quotas for luxury items, and has called for
 revival of the import deposit scheme, a
 step the government took last week. If
 consumption of imported goods must be
 curbed, the Communists view rationing as
 more equitable than price increases.
 Party economists generally oppose
 further economic assistance from abroad.
 They consider Italy's huge foreign
 debt-totaling $15.5 billion-a symbol of
 foreign control over the Italian economy.
 Eugenio Peggio, one of the party's leading
 economic experts, has denounced credits
 from the EC and the International
 Monetary Fund as threats to Italian
 autonomy because they specify con-
 straints on the growth of public spending
 and credit. Any further foreign borrow-
 ing, he asserts, must come with no strings
 attached.
 The Communists reject any type of in-
 comes policy as a way to reduce Italy's
 payments deficit. They argue that the
 burden of such policies would fall largely
 0. RS
 on lower income groups. The party admits
 that unit labor costs must be competitive
 with those of trading rivals, but it rejects
 wage controls of any kind. Peggio asserts
 that moderation on wages can come about
 only after organized labor has been given
 a larger role in business planning and in-
 vestment.
 The Communists also promise voters
 relief from the credit squeeze that the
 government has instituted to bolster the
 lira. The party recommends that the
 government establish a special line of
 credit to provide financing for priority
 projects in agriculture, housing, energy,
 and the employment of youth. At the
 same time, it recommends that financial
 institutions give priority  to small
 businesses in providing credit.
 Import Substitution
 The Communists consider import sub-
 stitution essential to long-run improve-
 ment in Italy's balance of payments. In
 common      with  many center-left
 economists, Peggio recommends the rapid
 expansion of domestic agriculture and the
 maintenance of the farm population at
 current levels. He particularly emphasizes
 the need for increased meat production;
 foreign exchange expenditures for im-
 ported meat are second only to those for
 crude oil.
 The Communists go much further than
 most economists in advocating major sur-
 gery for the Common Agricultural Policy
 of the EC. In the party's view, the EC
 farm policy has served only to keep the
 prices of Italian agricultural imports high.
 The Communists would restructure EC
 policy so that benefiting members would
 finance at least half of their own
 agricultural surpluses.
 The party also advocates some shift in
 the flow of Italian trade, ostensibly to
 conserve foreign exchange. Peggio urges
 that trade in industrial goods be shifted
 toward supposedly less expensive
 suppliers either in the USSR and Eastern
 Europe or among the developing coun-
 tries.  He also  recommends barter
 agreements like those between East Euro-
 pean countries and the USSR.
 The Communists  believe long-term
 economic stability requires the streamlin-
 ing of government operations.  Party
 resolutions recommend ceilings on the ex-
 penditures of the central government and
 state-owned companies, as well as the
 decentralization of fiscal programs. The
 Communists would have almost all public
 projects in the fields of health, education,
 housing, and transportation turned over
 to the regional governments. To add to
 government revenues, the party favors
 tougher tax treatment for upper income
 groups; it urges random tax auditing to
 curb evasion and accelerated collection of
 overdue taxes.
 System Called Obsolete
 Luciano Barca, chief of the party
 economics section, says Italy's economic
 system is obsolete. He asserts that free
 enterprise in Italy has rested on cheap
 labor and inexpensive raw materials. He
 adds that the collapse of these pillars, with
 the strengthening of the labor union

 movement and the energy crisis, plunged
 Italy into its present economic troubles.
 He would, however, grant broad con-
 cessions to the market, since Italy would
 need continued contacts with outside
 market economies.
 The Communists insist that they want
 to move Italy toward a planned economy
 through democratic processes. They are
 purposefully vague about their ultimate
 goals, including the eventual ownership of
 the factors of production. I n the short run,
 the Communists would apparently like as
 full control of the economy as possible
 without  completely  alienating  private
 business.
 They reject massive nationalization,
 which would quickly extinguish private
 enterprise. In any event, the government
 already owns at least one third of Italian
 industry. The Communists would attempt
 to control investment flows through credit
 and tax policies, more effective manipula-
 tion of public companies, and planning
 agreements with private companies.
 Economic planning should work, Barca
 states, to achieve a "fundamental social
 transformation" by mustering the full
 weight of industry to serve social needs.
 The Communists would channel more in-
 vestment into housing, schools, hospitals,
 public transportation, and economic
 development in southern Italy. They favor
 labor-intensive investments and increased
 capital spending  in food-processing in-
 dustries. One party member who deals in
 economic and labor policy matters says
 planning would reduce duplication of
 manufacturing facilities and lead to a
 better utilization of industrial capacity.
 With the lessons of Chile in mind, the
 party is cautious not to present too mili-
 tant a front. The Communist platform has
 considerable appeal to the mass of voters,
 especially at a time when unemployment
 is still rising. To many Italians, the party
 is not only blameless for the current
 economic malaise, but it offers a way out
 that entails minimum sacrifice for labor.
 Despite the party's professed allegiance
 to the EC, several of its proposals run
 counter to Community doctrine. Com-
 munist demands for a reform of the EC's
 agricultural subsidy mechanism amount
 to an attack on the system itself.
 Proposals to control  luxury  imports,
 reduce import dependence, and redirect
 trade toward the East could only be ac-
 complished by imposing controls or
 providing subsidies. Such measures would
 threaten the most solid achievement of the
 EC-the free flow of goods and services
 among member states.
 Many of the party's proposals are, of
 course, dominated by self-interest.
 ? Its call for fiscal decentralization
 Enrico Berlinguer (r) with Communist Party President Luigi Longo
 is clearly motivated by the pronounced
 strength of the party in regional
 governments rather than by any clear
 prospect of efficiency gains.
 ? Its proposal to curb federal ex-
 penditures sets no limits on local
 government funds or social security
 funds.                     25X1

 dustry and formulation of economic
 priorities by the central government

 Assuming the security situation settles down enough to
 permit Sarkis to assume the presidency, he may be able to act
 as a relatively neutral arbiter of Christian and Muslim interests.
 Much will depend on leftist leader Kamal Jumblatt's
 willingness to work with Sarkis and on the latter's ability to
 control the Christians.
 Lebanon: Prospects for llyas Sarkis
 Renewed fighting in Lebanon following
 the presidential election on May 8 un-
 derscores the magnitude of the task of
 reconciliation facing president-elect Ilyas
 Sarkis. Until more security is restored,
 Sarkis cannot be certain he will assume
 office, let alone be able to cope effectively
 with the problems of bringing Christians
 and Muslims to the negotiating table.
 Although a Christian, Sarkis does not
 pt the traditional mold of Lebanese chiefs
 of state. Unlike most of his predecessors,
 he was not born into the conservative
 Christian establishment. He has always
 been close to the center of power, but he
 has little taste for its trappings. He rose to
 the presidency on his own, in large part
 because of his abilities as a highly compe-
 tent  administrator and a shrewd
 behind-the-scenes negotiator. He has been
 helped along by several leading politicians
 but is obligated to few.
 Perhaps the most important difference
 between Sarkis and other Lebanese
 leaders is his emphasis on practicality
 over principle. He may be able to set at-
 tainable goals and realistic priorities. This
 pragmatism  is likely to offend  his
 co-religionists and the Muslim left-both
 of whom see their struggle in moral as
 well as political terms-but it may keep
 Sarkis above the endless wrangling over
 which side is right and which is wrong.
 This has scuttled previous attempts at
 reconciliation and compromise.
 If leftist leader Kamal Jumblatt can be
 persuaded to work with the new president,
 Sarkis may be able to act as a relatively
 neutral arbiter of Christian and Muslim
 interests. He seems personally to favor
 this role. This would allow the Syrians,
 whose own role as mediators has been
 controversial, to work through Sarkis.
 The Christians will put strong pressure
 on Sarkis to argue their case, and, over
 time, Sarkis will inevitably be drawn close
 to their side, especially on such conten-
 tious issues as secularization of the
 government and reconstruction of the ar-
 my.
 As a conservative Christian, Sarkis is
 likely to work hard to preserve as much of
 the Christians' special political status as
 possible. He may press Christian leaders,
 however, to give up their less useful
 prerogatives and to be more flexible.
 Sarkis also seems to appreciate the
 power of the Palestinians in Lebanon and
 the need for their continuing cooperation
 in peace efforts. Sarkis will have difficulty
 overcoming the near obsession of the
 Christians with the need to control the
 Palestinians. He may be able to fashion
 some compromises, however, by giving
 private assurances to Palestinian leaders.

 We know little about Sarkis' personal
 relationship with  important  Christian
 leaders. The strong support he received
 from Phalanges Party leader Pierre
 Jumayyil suggests that Jumayyil has con-
 fidence in Sarkis and generally approves
 his stand on key issues. Interior Minister
 Shamun, on the other hand, has a
 long-standing grudge against Sarkis stem-
 ming from Shamun's intense dislike for
 Sarkis' political mentor, the late president
 Fuad Chehab. Shamun, moreover, almost
 certainly finds fault with Sarkis' liberal
 attitude on reforms and his inclination to
 seek compromise.
 Sarkis should be able to strengthen
 Jumayyil's hand in dealing with Shamun,
 who, with President Franjiyah's support,
 often scuttled Jumayyil's more flexible
 proposals. Sarkis, however, has no in-
 dependent power base in Christian circles,
 and he will have to depend almost ex-
 elusively on persuasion in dealing with
 both Shamun and Jumayyil.
 To a large extent, his success will hinge
 on his ability to control the Christians,
 who expect him to delay any further ero-
 sion of their power. Should Sarkis fail to
 do this, his presidency will be wholly
 dependent on support from Syria and,
 thus, would be attacked by both
 Christians and Muslims.

 Prime Minister Manley's efforts to bring Jamaica's black
 population into the mainstream both socially and economically
 has led him steadily leftward. Less radical than some of his
 followers, he would probably prefer to court middle-class sup-
 port in the election he,faces before May of next year, but events
 may impel him to run on a strictly radical versus conservative
 platform instead.
 ( 2 J
 Jamaica: In Pursuit of Its National Identity
 Nearly 16 years after its independence
 from the UK, Jamaica has reached a
 crossroads.  Prime Minister Michael
 Manley's efforts to bring the black pop-
 ulation into the mainstream both socially
 and economically has led him steadily
 leftward.
 Manley claims to be a democratic
 socialist, but he has aroused fears of more
 revolutionary intentions. He has strongly
 identified  his country's foreign policy
 with the Third World and has looked to
 Fidel Castro's Cuba for models and for
 moral support in carrying out his
 domestic reforms.
 Manley's policies-particularly the
 close ties with Cuba and the independence
 he has allowed young militants in his own
 party-have caused a strong backlash. As
 an election year begins, he finds himself in
 serious political trouble. He has moved
 toward the center in recent weeks in an ef-
 fort to recapture middle-class and
 business support, but he is finding it dif-
 ficult to shed his leftist image.
 The Cuban Tie
 Castro has had a major impact on
 Manley. En route to the nonaligned con-
 ference in Algiers in September 1973,
 Manley, Castro, and Prime Minister
 Forbes Burnham of Guyana spent long
 hours together aboard Castro's plane.
 Manley later referred to the flight as "one
 of the great experiences of my life."
 Manley has found Cuba's experience in
 developing social programs, particularly
 in the fields of education, public health,
 and school and housing construction, es-
 pecially relevant to Jamaica. Manley has
 also been impressed with Cuban technical
 advances in areas such as agriculture and
 livestock, sugar cane technology, and
 commercial fishing.
 In  March  1975, the first major
 technical cooperation agreement between
 the two countries was signed. It provided
 for 183 Jamaican youths to go to Cuba to
 study the use of community self-help in
 housing construction.
 During Manley's visit to Cuba last Ju-
 ly, technical cooperation was in-
 stitutionalized with the establishment of a
 joint economic, scientific, and technical
 commission that is to meet semiannually.
 Since the commission's first meeting last
 November in Kingston, three projects
 have been begun, and others are in the
 planning stage.
 Cuba now has 83 technical specialists in
 Jamaica, in addition to an active embassy

 staff and a Cuban press office. They in-
 clude:
 ? A team of 20 Cubans who arrived
 in early February to build six small
 dams that will be used as models for an
 ambitious program to provide water to
 Jamaica's farmers.
 ? An advance party of 55 Cubans
 who arrived in February to make final
 preparations for the building of a
 500-student  residential  secondary
 school specializing in the training of
 agricultural technicians. The remain-
 ing members of what is to be a 250-
 man construction team are due to
 arrive soon.
 ? Eight specialists in the construc-
 tion of prefabricated houses who are
 working on a project in the town of
 Falmouth.
 Cuban Activities
 Havana has been particularly active
 and successful in cultivating Jamaican
 youth groups. Its contacts with the youth
 wing of Manley's People's National Party
 date from August 1974, and many of the
 leaders of that organization, including its
 director, Luis Castriota, are fervent ad-
 vocates of close ties with Cuba.
 The Cubans may already be providing
 political training of some Jamaicans. The
 Jamaican youths who were sent to Cuba
 last summer to work in housing construc-
 tion were selected from Minister of Hous-
 ing Anthony Spaulding's stable of party
 thugs, and at least a few of them can be
 expected to become grass-roots party
 organizers when they return.
 Party's Leftward Drift
 The People's National Party has begun
 to move further and  further to the left.
 Party leaders have publicly advocated the
 creation of a one-party state and an end to
 any role for private enterprise.
 The racial overtones of statements by
 party leaders have caused ethnic minori-
 ties to emigrate at accelerating rates. In
 January, political violence sparked by
 rival gangs affiliated with the People's
 National Party and the Jamaican Labor
 Party devastated entire city blocks in
 the slums of West Kingston.
 The Offensive Boomerangs
 With elections due no later than May
 1977, Manley's base of support has been
 weakened, but probably not enough to
 prevent his re-election. He has almost cer-
 tainly lost ground among middle class
 voters and among the young businessmen
 and professionals who financed his last
 campaign.
 Manley could be hurt in the rural areas
 as well, where his party made significant
 inroads into the opposition's traditional
 rural base in 1972. Manley's flirtation
 with Cuba may cost him the votes of some
 small farmers.
 Manley will try to recoup by con-
 solidating his hold over the urban poor.
 The critical question in the election will
 probably turn on whether Manley's party
 can secure a high turnout of slum voters
 and win a good percentage of the 18 to 21
 year olds who are voting for the first time.
 Search for Aid
 The Manley government appears to be
 making some headway, especially with in-
 ternational organizations, in its search for
 economic assistance. Jamaica has ob-
 tained  emergency  balance-of-payments
 aid of $29.2 million from the Inter-
 national  Monetary Fund's oil facility
 mechanism and has availed itself of the
 Fund's gold tranche.
 The World Bank is studying several
 new loans totaling at least $45 million
 that would promote rural and urban
 development and is considering Jamaica
 for an ambitious pilot program aimed at
 tackling urban unemployment. The
 Inter-American Development Bank is ex-
 amining a request for a $20-million in-
 dustrial credit loan. In addition, smaller
 loans have been offered by Kuwait and the
 Caribbean Development Bank.
 Jamaica has begun to turn to some of
 the more radical nonaligned countries and
 to Eastern Europe in its efforts to expand
 its  markets,  acquire technology,  and
 decrease its economic dependence on the
 US.  In  March,  Hungary reportedly
 agreed to construct an alumina plant in
 Jamaica, and Algeria signed an agree-
 ment for future yearly delivery of 150,000
 tons of Jamaican alumina.
 Diplomatic relations were established
 with Libya in February, and the Qadhafi
 government agreed to send a delegation to
 Kingston soon to promote economic and
 technical cooperation.
 US Interests
 US investments in Jamaica total about
 $1 billion. The US receives over half of its
 bauxite and nearly one quarter of its
 alumina from Jamaica. US investment in
 the Jamaican bauxite and alumina in-
 dustry is about $660 million.
 Realizing the need for the US market,
 Manley and his negotiators have dealt
 judiciously with the six North American
 aluminum companies (five US, one Cana-
 dian) that dominate the industry. It was
 not until the dramatic rise in oil prices in
 the winter of 1973 and 1974 that the
 government began to pressure the com-
 panies to renegotiate their contracts.
 In June  1974, Jamaica broke off
 negotiations and increased the export tax
 on bauxite by 500 percent. The tax has

 been crucial to the island's economic sur-
 vival and now accounts for over 30 per-
 cent of government revenues.
 Shortly after the imposition of the
 bauxite tax, the government began acquir-
 ing majority ownership in the aluminum
 companies. In October 1974, provisional
 agreements were reached with Kaiser-
 and in the following months with
 Reynolds and Revere-that called for the
 government to buy 51 percent of the min-
 ing operation over a 10-year period.
 Discussions are under way with the
 largest company,  Alcoa,  that will
 presumably set the pattern for the final
 agreement with all the companies.
 Kingston has been in no hurry to make a
 final settlement, presumably because it
 lacks the revenue to purchase equity par-
 ticipation.
 The government has been put in a dif-
 ficult bargaining position because of the
 depressed state of the bauxite industry.
 Bauxite and alumina export earnings in
 real terms dropped by about 20 percent
 last year. Reduced aluminum demand
 forced Revere to close down its refinery,
 and other companies have had to lay off
 workers or shorten working hours.
 As the bauxite industry recovers from
 its current depressed state, Manley will be
 encouraged to drive a hard bargain with
 the companies, especially on the issue of
 minimum production levels. This issue
 could become particularly delicate if the
 government thinks the companies are cut-
 ting back production in Jamaica dis-
 proportionately  to cutbacks  in  other
 countries where they have operations.
 Manley's Prospects
 To retain power, Manley will probably
 try to carry water on both shoulders,
 attempting to regain the confidence of his
 former middle-class backers while at the
 same time holding on to his left-wing sup-
 port. This will not be easy, but Manley
 will probably muddle through, winning
 re-election, although by a much smaller
 margin than in 1972. Left wingers in the
 party will put continual pressure on him,
 but as long as he does not move too sharp-
 ly to the center they are likely to see their
 long-run prospects as being better served
 by working for his re-election than by
 splintering the party and leaving the field
 to the opposition. While Manley's support
 from business and the middle class has
 eroded markedly, the point of no return
 has not been reached, and Manley is ac-
 tively courting the favor of the commer-
 cial elite-apparently with some success.
 There is some danger, of course, that
 the relationship with Cuba may already
 have acquired  sufficient momentum to
 make  a  reconciliation  with  the
 middle-class, moneyed-elite branch of his
 coalition impossible to achieve even
 through the election period. If Manley
 judges that to be the case, he is likely to
 run on a straight radicals versus conser-
 vatives platform. In that event Manley
 would have to mortgage himself to the
 strong-arm methods of the ultra-radicals.
 Though Manley's constitutionalist roots
 are still strong enough to allow him to
 accept honorable defeat, this is not true of
 the left-wing party leaders, and their ef-
 forts to steal the election or seize it by
 force could either mark the end of West-
 minster democrat in Jamaica or produce
 bloody civil strife.
