 Washington, D.C. 20515
 Thank you for your interest in the Intelligence Community as
 expressed in the Committee's book  'Policy Alternatives:   Ideas for
 Tomorrow, Choices for Today.'
 Due in large measure to the efforts of the Administration and the
 Congress, the past few years have been a period of restoration for the
 Community, both in capabilities and spirit.
 Because of this support, the Community has made advances on many of
 the issues espoused in your report.   For example, we continue to enhance
 the capabilities of our technical means of acquiring information and have
 plans for significant capabilities for the future.  Efforts to improve
 our access through human sources are equally vigorous.   I can also assure
 you that gains continue to be made in the coordination of intelligence
 community activities.
 We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the book.   If you need
 further assistance, please feel free to call.       .

 Dear Mr. Casey:
 In early January the House Republican Research Conmittee released a
 a book of policy alternatives entitled "Ideas for Tomorrow, Choices for Today."
 Many of the book's ideas require legislative action, and the Committee is
 tracking their progress through the 99th Congress.  In addition, a number of
 the proposals entail administrative action.  Please review the enclosed
 sections, which bear on your agency's work.  I would be most grateful if you
 could tell n  of any recent action eabodying proposals listed in these pages.
 I shall look forward to hearing from you. If the Research Committee can
 be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us.
 Sincerely,
 Approved For Release 2009/09/18: CIA-RDP87M00539R002203530034-7

 Regulatory Process
 The Setting
 Federal rules and red tape, despite their good intentions, cost the
 US economy over $ 100 billion a year-an expense consumers ulti-
 mately pay. In past years, the absence of a workable regulatory
 oversight process led to inefficiency, because bureaucrats had no
 incentive to consider how their rules would affect economic growth.
 In 1981, President Reagan set up the first systematic process for
 managing federal regulation. Under Executive Order 12291, execu-
 tive agencies must gauge the likely economic effects of all proposed
 and final rules, and the Office of Management and Budget must
 review them before they are issued. A new problem has cropped up,
 however. In 1983, the Supreme Court declared existing legislative
 vetoes unconstitutional, thereby depriving Congress of a check on
 agency discretion. Furthermore, President Reagan's review process is
 not yet statutory and thus could be scrapped by a future administra-
 tion.
 Current Policy
 President Reagan continues to back regulatory reform. Because of
 his work to date, the growth of new regulations has been cut by more
 than a third, and government-imposed business paperwork has
 shrunk by several hundred million man-hours a year.
 In spite of progress in specific regulatory areas, overall process
 reform has had a hard time on Capitol Hill. In 1982, the Senate
 unanimously passed a bill requiring cost-benefit analysis and au-
 thorizing a two-house legislative veto. This bill did not reach the
 House floor. The 98th Congress had hearings on regulatory reform,
 but took no major action.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Authorize the congressional veto by use of a joint resolution of
 approval for major rules and a joint resolution of disapproval for
 others.
 ? Require agencies to undertake regulatory analyses for new major
 rules and their alternatives. Agencies would have to choose the
 most cost-effective alternative unless otherwise forbidden by law.
 ? Provide for a regulatory budget: a ceiling on the amount of
 regulatory costs that could be imposed on those subject to federal
 regulation.

 Intelligence
 The Setting
 Since the formation of the House and Senate Select Committees on
 Intelligence, Congress has increasingly influenced intelligence policy.
 Congress has curbed covert action in Central America and elsewhere.
 Lawmakers have criticized intelligence agencies for apparent failures
 to forecast the Shah's downfall, the Soviet invasion of
 and attacks on US diplomatic posts, to name a few. intelligence has indeed had its shortcomings-stemming lely from
 an erosion of morale and support, which hit bottom in the 1970s. But
 the intelligence community did better than that period's headlines
 suggested. As President Kennedy once told CIA officials, "Your
 successes are unheralded, your failures are trumpeted."
 Current Policy
 The Administration has restored the intelligence community's
 vitality, but skepticism and even hostility linger among congressional
 Democrats. Under their pressure, Congress has hampered operations
 through curbs on intelligence-gathering and covert action, and
 through news leaks calculated to torpedo operations. The Intelligence
 Committees were intended to be non-partisan, but politics has col-
 ored their work, especially when intelligence activities have involved
 foreign policy controversies. On the positive side, Congress has
 responded to Administration requests for improved intelligence re-
 sources, and has exempted certain sensitive intelligence files from the
 Freedom of Information Act.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Revise Intelligence Committee appointment procedures to en-
 sure an orderly transition of membership. And to protect the
 intelligence community's budgetary interests, the Committee
 should continue to emphasize its current policy that some of its
 members serve on either the Appropriations, Armed Services,
 Judiciary or Foreign Affairs Committees. Before the establish-
 ment of the Intelligence Committees, each of these bodies had
 exercised oversight in this field.
 ? Ensure that sensitive classified material from the Intelligence
 Committee is shared with other committees on a case-by-case
 basis only.
 ? Establish criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of classi-
 fied information by those with access to sensitive information.
 Criminal penalties currently apply only to unlawful disclosure of
 communications intelligence, identities of covert agents and
 energy-restricted data.
 ? Continue procurement of technical intelligence systems and im-
 prove recruitment of intelligence agents, with an emphasis on
 ethnic and native-speaking candidates.

 Preface
 Children born this year will cast their first vote in the twenty-first
 century. Will they be struggling with scarcity and insecurity? Or will
 they be building upon growth and strength? This year could start to
 tell the tale.
 The American people have already chosen which path they want. In
 giving President Reagan a mandate, they approved his record and
 endorsed his principles: hope, opportunity and peace through
 strength.
 House Republicans won an even greater victory than our seat gain
 would suggest. About half the people voted for our candidates; and in
 contested races, Republicans won a clear majority of the total popular
 vote. Were it not for congressional districts sculpted to favor the other
 party, Republicans might be running the House already.
 Someday soon, we will. Looking to that day, we enter the 99th
 Congress with a vision of the future, in which government encourages
 initiative, protects family values, maintains a strong national defense,
 and joins with private and community organizations in helping the
 needy. This document, prepared by the Committee on the First 100
 Days of the House Republican Research Committee, presents a road-
 map of where we want to lead America. The House's Democratic
 rulers may try to obstruct our proposals, but by drawing a roadmap,
 we can show America where the roadblocks are-and who put them
 there.
 This is an outline of things to be done, not a rigid schedule of
 legislation. Our responsibility as a party demands that we prepare for
 the future we envision. Even if some of our proposals must await
 further economic improvement, the vision remains to inspire our
 party and, we believe, a majority of Americans.
 The agenda consists of five major sections:
 -Economic Growth and Opportunity
 -Free Individuals and Strong Families
 -Natural Resources and Human Frontiers
 -Fair and Efficient Government
 -A Strong America in a Peaceful World.
 Each section comprises a number of one-page issue papers. Each
 paper is organized as follows:
 -"Setting" discusses the issue's historical background.
 -"Current Policy" describes recent efforts to remedy the problem.
 -"Policy Alternatives" outlines future options. (The document's
 final pages contain a list of relevant sample bills from the 98th
 Congress.)
 In drafting this document, the Committee on the First 100 Days
 solicited ideas from scholars, public policy institutes, private sector
 groups, congressional committees and their staffs. Although they do

 not bear responsibility for the final document, their insight and
 variety are reflected here: like a roadmap, each set of options offer
 several routes to the same destination. Given this abundance of ideas,
 no one should expect that every Republican will endorse them all.
 Our party enjoys both a sense of common direction and an exciting
 diversity of thought, so the agenda does not exhaust the range of
 issues and options that House Republicans are going to consider.
 (Because of the complexity of the titlements issue a special task force
 of the Research Committee will be issuing a supplementary report.) As
 new challenges arise, we will craft new solutions. President Kennedy
 put it this way: "All this will not be finished in the first one hundred
 days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the
 life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this
 planet. But let us begin."

 A Dream Coming to Birth
 An Introduction
 The Democratic leaders have a problem with Franklin Roosevelt:
 grasping for his ghost, they have lost his spirit. Unlike them, FDR
 believed in change. Forty-eight years ago, he started his second
 Administration with words that echo true today: "With this change in
 our moral climate and our rediscovered ability to improve our
 economic order, we have set our feet upon the road of unending
 progress. Shall we pause now and turn our back upon the road that lies
 ahead? Or, shall we continue on our way? For'each age is a dream that
 is dying or one that is coming to birth."'
 FDR's party has run out of dreams: it only offers recurring night-
 mares. It was sometime in the 1960s that Democratic policies went
 bad. The "Great Society" promised hope to the poor, but its programs
 ultimately spawned dependency and despair. Indeed, the poverty rate
 stopped falling just when social spending hit new highs. Joblessness
 and inflation also worsened under the policies born in the 1960s. Even
 so, the House Democratic leaders want to turn back to that road,
 carrying a satchelful of taxpayer dollars. They paint a glossy picture of
 what would happen if only we had more of the same; but that reality
 lies in the gutter, where the glitter doesn't glow.
 The Democrats failed because they have a mythology instead of a
 philosophy. They believe that coercion works better than incentives,
 that progress comes gift-wrapped in red tape. Bureaucratic values
 must outweigh individual values, they assume, so all power must flow
 to Washington, DC.
 The Atari Democrats lay claim to new ideas. But upon a close look,
 most of their "new ideas" are antiques touched up with varnish and
 gilt. What else is "industrial policy" but a disinterred Reconstruction
 Finance Corporation, an idea that wore out decades ago? The party is
 a loveless marriage between the New Deal and the Big Chill, who live
 in a house with shuttered windows.
 The House Republicans offer a better way.
 Our premise is simple: America's real energy comes not from
 government, but from millions of good hearts and creative minds.
 Our country is embarking on a massive peaceful revolution-and the
 revolutionaries range from scientists closing in on cancer cures to
 children tapping their ABCs on a computer keyboard. Government's
 role is to encourage this revolution and help bring its benefits to all
 Americans.
 In many ways, government can best welcome the future just by
 getting out of the way. We propose long-range procedural reforms to
 curb government spending and return the money to its rightful

 look at regulatory reform. Because of technological innovation, many
 rules that may have still made sense only a few years ago are now
 going stale.
 Government should also provide entrepreneurs with incentives
 and support. Enterprise zones could bring jobs and hope to communi-
 ties that some write off as burnt-out cases. NASA's efforts and other
 research programs could make way for discoveries that will change
 our lives. Who knows what diseases could be cured and what re-
 sources could be found?
 Even as America masters the changes in the material world, it must
 stay anchored to the traditional values of family and fairness. We
 think government can play a positive role in helping families find
 opportunities for adoption, day care and good education. Children
 have the right to mature into this great era unscarred, and we propose
 policies to guard them from abuse. Although the future belongs to the
 children, America should never leave the old and the handicapped
 behind; the benefits of technology should be channeled to their aid.
 Compassion also entails respect for individual liberties. We support
 equal opportunity for women, minorities and all other Americans.
 Americans have no monopoly on such aspirations. People every-
 where are seeking peace, freedom and opportunity. Democracy has
 spread beyond the North Atlantic nations to countries in Asia and
 Latin America. We look forward to a day when the term "Free
 World" applies to the entire globe. Yet, there still remain many
 national rulers who do not share our values. They employ terror,
 subversion and aggression; mounting evidence suggests that they
 have dropped "yellow rain" onto Afghan soil and spilled the Pope's
 blood onto Roman pavement.
 House Republicans hope that the next century will be free from
 violent conflict. But we agree with President Eisenhower. "No matter
 how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace, we must maintain a
 high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged
 in negotiating the issue of arms reduction. Until tangible and mutu-
 ally enforceable arms reduction measures are worked out, we will not
 weaken the means of defending our institutions." This is also Presi-
 dent Reagan's path, and we should keep to it.
 Our country once enjoyed a bipartisan consensus on foreign policy.
 Since the late 1960s, some Democratic leaders have turned their backs
 on the tradition exemplified by Harry Truman, Hubert Humphrey
 and Henry Jackson. Yet House Republicans do not despair. The
 principle of peace through strength is still embraced by most Demo-
 cratic voters, as well as many Democratic officials. We invite them to
 join with us in restoring consensus. After all, a democracy's security
 rests not so much on hardware or strategy as on the people's unity and
 will.
 Novelists warn us that the future could go wrong. In one story,
 reading is forbidden. In another, the people are drugged into docility.
 And in the most famous tale of this kind, 1984, Big Brother watches
 everyone's thoughts and deeds. The real 1984 has come and gone

 without any of these disasters coming true, but we should not lapse
 into complacency. It is hard work to build a good future: idleness
 could cost us all the opportunities described above. House Republi-
 cans are unafraid of tough challenges, and we stand ready to clear the
 way for a better world. We believe that the future is not a matter of
 chance; it is a matter of choice. It is not something to be waited for; it
 is something to be achieved.

 Economic Growth and Opportunity
 President Reagan inherited a sickly economy in 1981. Inflation,
 unemployment and interest rates were all up; productivity, savings
 and investment were all down. After four years of President Carter
 and twenty-six years of Democratic congressional rule, America
 needed strong medicine. And the Reagan Administration provided it,
 in the form of a four point Economic Recovery Program:
 -a three-year, across-the-board cut in personal income taxes;
 -an effort to brake federal spending;
 -a plan to reform burdensome and outdated regulations;
 -a reformed monetary policy to ensure price stability through
 steady, predictable growth of the money supply.
 The House Democratic leadership balked much of this program,
 but the President did win some victories, especially the tax cut. As a
 result, the economy rebounded. Now as we enter the first 100 days of
 the second Reagan Administration, Congress should consider a five
 part Economic Growth and Opportunity Program that builds upon the
 policies of the past four years. Aimed at bolstering our productive
 strength and preventing a resurgence of inflation, this new program
 includes:
 -simplifying the tax code, which would broaden the tax base,
 permit lower marginal rates and provide incentives for savings
 and investment;
 -improving the budget process so as to curb spending for well-
 intended but inefficient programs;
 -supporting monetary policy that would allow greater public
 scrutiny of Federal Reserve Board policy and enable the Fed to
 control the money supply more coherently and predictably;
 -reforming regulation to encourage competition and offer con-
 sumers the widest choice at the lowest price, yet also to protect
 consumers where necessary;
 -nurturing opportunities for employment, enterprise, innovation
 and trade.
 In working with Congress on these programs, the President should
 have access to expert advice that looks to the general interests of the
 American economy. The Council of Economic Advisers, uncon-
 strained by the institutional perspectives of other agencies, has per-
 formed this role in the past. Having a strong, possibly reformed, CEA
 to help formulate and promote sound policies could aid the Adminis-
 tration in winning legislative approval for its economic agenda.
 In short, the plans outlined here show that economics need not be
 the dismal science. It can also be the science of hope, growth and
 opporunity.

 Tax Reform
 The Setting
 In 1962, President Kennedy said, "Every dollar released from
 taxation that is spent or invested will help create a new job and a new
 salary. And these new jobs and new salaries can create other jobs and
 other salaries and more customers and more growth for an expanding
 American economy." The subsequent Kennedy tax cut proved just
 that. But Congress soon forgot the lesson and indulged in the ruinous
 cycle of tax-and-spend. By 1980, average and marginal tax rates had
 risen to levels that threatened economic growth.
 Current Policy
 The Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) of 1981 cut income taxes
 by 25% over three years. Much of this reduction, however, has been
 offset by other revenue measures: the Tax Equity and Fiscal Respon-
 sibility Act (TEFRA) of 1982, the gasoline tax increase, the Social
 Security tax increases in 1983, and the 1984 Tax Reform Act. Still, the
 Reagan tax cut has contributed to an unprecedented growth in the
 American economy.
 Now as we prepare to spur more growth by further reducing
 government's reach, we also face the separate challenge of tax reform.
 Fairness and simplicity are important goals in their own right, and
 they require prompt attention.
 Policy Alternatives
 To encourage investment and innovation, several other papers in
 this document recommend tax incentives, which are less costly and
 more efficient than bureaucratic outlays. Obviously, such proposals
 would be modified as we simplify the tax code.
 ? Enact a modified flat tax such as the Treasury Department
 proposal or the Kemp-Kasten "Fair and Simple Tax" to simplify
 the tax code, broaden the tax base, permit lower marginal rates
 and close loopholes that allow some rich people and corporations
 to escape their fair share of taxes.
 ? Along with a modified flat rate, provide enhanced savings incen-
 tives that broaden the use of IRAs, and create a super savings
 account (Roth-Moore BEST Tax).
 ? Increase tax-free ceilings on IRAs to encourage further saving.

 Congress and the Deficit
 The Setting
 The federal government is running huge deficits because it spends
 too much, not because it taxes too little. In 1966, federal revenues
 amounted to 18.1% of the gross national product; in 1983, the figure
 stood at 18.6%. Yet at the same time, outlays shot up from 18.6% to
 24.7%. Consequently, the deficit has risen from less than 1% of GNP
 to slightly under 5% today. (Fiscal 1969 brought a small surplus.)
 Under the Constitution, Congress holds the power of the purse, so
 much of the responsibility for deficits belongs on Capitol Hill. Since
 1981, Congress has promised spending cuts if tax increases were
 enacted to deal with the deficit. Despite the promises, congressional
 deficit-reduction packages have tended to emphasize revenues over
 savings.
 High deficits have propelled the economy into uncharted waters.
 There is no consensus on the exact nature and magnitude of the
 effects, but some things are clear. Excessive government spending
 uses up productive resources that could be put to more efficient use by
 private business or made available to future generations. We are
 burdening our children with more than a trillion dollars of debt; the
 interest alone already takes up more than a tenth of the budget.
 Congress's immediate task is to prevent an exponential growth in
 the debt, the deficit and federal interest expense.
 Current Policy
 The Reagan Administration has carried out a number of Grace
 Commission recommendations to improve management and effi-
 ciency. For the next fiscal year, the President is proposing significant
 budget savings. The House Democratic leadership, however, has
 done little to improve the congressional budget process.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Enact broad-based spending reductions. Specifically, give careful
 consideration to the President's proposed savings.
 ? Stimulate economic growth. Reform of taxation, regulation and
 monetary policy-described in other issue papers-will encour-
 age savings and investment, and thereby generate more revenue.
 ? Amend congressional rules to require that legislation allocating
 new funds would have to provide a source for those funds, either
 in the form of new revenue or a cut in existing programs.
 ? Streamline the congressional budget process by providing for a
 single budget resolution to control discretionary budget authority
 and establishing a Joint Budget Committee.
 ? To ensure greater openness in the budget process, require appro-
 priation bills to be marked up and made public seven days before
 a floor vote.

 Further Budget Reform
 The Setting
 The troubles described in the previous paper signal a deeper
 problem: Congress is biased toward overspending. Budgets are set by
 adding expenditures for separate programs. People with a stake in
 each program work to get it funded; the majority of people, each
 paying only a few tax dollars for that program, might not fight it.
 Congress takes few political risks by voting the funds, but the costs
 add up.
 Some costs are not immediately obvious. Many off-budget outlays
 have virtually the same economic impact as direct expenditures, but
 are not treated as part of the budget. Neither are unfunded future
 liabilities (e.g., various subsidies). Although it is hard to measure such
 items, it is evident that they distort the overall fiscal picture. The
 budget cuts and procedural changes outlined earlier can do a great
 deal of good over the next few years. But to guard against excess in the
 longer run, the government should adopt further reforms.
 Current Policy
 President Reagan has long advocated structural reforms such as the
 item veto and the balanced budget amendment.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Adopt a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget
 and limiting the total amount the government can tax and spend.
 ? Adopt a constitutional amendment allowing the president to veto
 line items in appropriation bills.
 ? Adopt a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds vote of
 Congress on bills and joint resolutions making appropriations
 and on concurrent resolutions on the budget.
 ? Allow the president limited authority to impound funds. Such
 power was removed by the 1974 Budget Act.
 ? Consider a two-year budget cycle, which would permit longer
 planning horizons and more orderly decisionmaking.
 ? Bring off-budget items into the budget. In 1984, over $14 billion
 was not subject to ceilings set in budget resolutions.
 ? Adopt a capital budget within the unified budget to distinguish
 between capital spending and operating costs.
 ? Require the Federal Financing Bank, after a federal agency has
 made a direct loan, to sell the obligation to the highest bidder.
 Any difference between the amount lent and the amount sold
 would measure the federal subsidy. The current credit accounting
 system obscures the true cost of federal credit assistance.

 Monetary Reform
 The Setting
 A healthy economy depends on a sound dollar. A monetary struc-
 ture that fosters a steady and predictable money supply is an essential
 condition for growth without inflation. Monetary policy is set by the
 Federal Reserve, which acts independently of other federal economic
 policymakers. The Fed's key policymaking body, the Open Market
 Committee, meets privately each month to review the economy and
 determine whether the money supply should be eased or tightened.
 The Committee makes its decisions public after an interval of several
 weeks; critics say this interval allows for volatile speculation in
 financial markets due to uncertainty about Fed policy.
 Current Policy
 Members of Congress, as well as elements of the domestic and
 international business communities, have questioned the Federal
 Reserve's short-run discretionary management of the economy. De-
 spite a 1979 change in operating procedures to focus on growth in
 monetary aggregates, say critics, control of the money supply has been
 uneven. According to Milton Friedman, "the problem is not the
 person who happens to be chairman, but the system."
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Require prompt disclosure of Fed decisions concerning the future
 course of monetary policy.
 ? Make the Treasury Secretary an ex officio member of the Reserve
 System's Board ofGovernors. This proposal would restore a status
 the Secretary had for many years until the 1930s.
 ? Establish a cabinet-level monetary policy advisory task force to
 study reforms aimed at improving international stability in prices
 and exchange rates. Reforms could include guidelines for the Fed
 such as: combined price/quantity rules; freeze of "high-powered"
 money; an index of prices to be used an an intermediate mone-
 tary target for the Fed; and a constant rate of growth of M 1, the
 base measure of money.

 Regulatory Process
 The Setting
 Federal rules and red tape, despite their good intentions, cost the
 US economy over $100 billion a year-an expense consumers ulti-
 mately pay. In past years, the absence of a workable regulatory
 oversight process led to inefficiency, because bureaucrats had no
 incentive to consider how their rules would affect economic growth.
 In 1981, President Reagan set up the first systematic process for
 managing federal regulation. Under Executive Order 12291, execu-
 tive agencies must gauge the likely economic effects of all proposed
 and final rules, and the Office of Management and Budget must
 review them before they are issued. A new problem has cropped up,
 however. In 1983, the Supreme Court declared existing legislative
 vetoes unconstitutional, thereby depriving Congress of a check on
 agency discretion. Furthermore, President Reagan's review process is
 not yet statutory and thus could be scrapped by a future administra-
 tion.
 Current Policy
 President Reagan continues to back regulatory reform. Because of
 his work to date, the growth of new regulations has been cut by more
 than a third, and government-imposed business paperwork has
 shrunk by several hundred million man-hours a year.
 In spite of progress in specific regulatory areas, overall process
 reform has had a hard time on Capitol Hill. In 1982, the Senate
 unanimously passed a bill requiring cost-benefit analysis and au-
 thorizing a two-house legislative veto. This bill did not reach the
 House floor. The 98th Congress had hearings on regulatory reform,
 but took no major action.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Authorize the congressional veto by use of a joint resolution of
 approval for major rules and a joint resolution of disapproval for
 others.
 ? Require agencies to undertake regulatory analyses for new major
 rules and their alternatives. Agencies would have to choose the
 most cost-effective alternative unless otherwise forbidden by law.
 ? Provide for a regulatory budget: a ceiling on the amount of
 regulatory costs that could be imposed on those subject to federal
 regulation.

 Banking
 The Setting
 The current regulatory system for banking is a green-eyeshade
 institution in a microchip world. The nation's banks, working under
 rules first developed during the Great Depression, have not been able
 to compete in offering all the broad financial services demanded in
 today's complex economy. The regulatory agencies, by imposing
 uncoordinated and often conflicting requirements, have introduced
 serious inefficiencies into the financial industry.
 In response to market demand unmet by the banking structure,
 nonbanking organizations have moved into financial services, caus-
 ing fierce competition for investment funds. Handicapped by rigid
 rules, the banking community has had trouble meeting the challenge.
 Thus the rise in the number of "problem institutions" and outright
 failures often stems from too much government regulation, not too
 little.
 Current Policy
 Current regulatory policies remain much as they were fifty years.
 Individual components of financial services are separately regulated
 to assure monetary stability, protection of customers, and encourage-
 ment of socially desirable investments. The statutory scheme allows
 regulators to control entry, determine product lines, fix prices and
 limit both expansion and creditor risk (through deposit insurance). In
 response to recent economic problems, Congress has modified restric-
 tions on interest rates and the expansion of financial services. But the
 basic system remains intact.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Authorize depository institution holding companies to broaden
 the scope of their financial services and activities.
 ? Provide for geographic deregulation of banking by easing restric-
 tions on interstate banking operations.
 ? Realign regulatory responsiblities. The recommendations of the
 Vice President's task force provide a useful starting point for such
 an effort.
 ? Provide for variable premium deposit insurance rates that would
 take into consideration the nature of the financial services pro-
 vided by the institution, as well as its financial health.

 Communications Deregulation
 The Setting
 Under its 1934 legislative mandate, the Federal Communication
 Commission has regulated interstate communication by wire and
 airwave. The FCC's creators assumed that communication technol-
 ogy was not flexible enough to allow the free play of market forces. But
 as we near the year 2000, the airwaves are no longer the "limited
 resource" of yesteryear. Changing technologies and new forms of
 competition outmode much of the present regulation. Advances in
 satellite and cable communications increase capacities, foster compe-
 tition, and destroy "spectrum monopolies." Democratic leaders who
 cling to the archaic belief that more government is better government
 fail to grasp the extent of this competitive environment and the need
 to remove government interference.
 Current Policy
 The FCC and Congress both have moved toward deregulation. In
 1981, the FCC deregulated major aspects of commercial radio, and
 three years later it took similar action on commercial and public
 television. Last year, Congress streamlined regulation of cable TV.
 These and other reforms have cut industry paperwork burdens by 17
 million hours in the past two years.
 The restructuring of the American telephone industry started with
 the divestiture of AT&T. The company gave up control of its local
 operating companies in exchange for the right to enter more competi-
 tive markets. So that local and long-distance rates may reflect actual
 costs, the FCC has implemented access charges for businesses and has
 planned a one dollar a month charge for residential customers.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Codify FCC radio regulation rules and extend them to television.
 These measures would abolish mandatory compliance in provid-
 ing programming formats, learning community needs, keeping
 program logs, and restricting commercial advertising.
 ? Encourage the FCC to create a lottery system for broadcast
 licensing and to rely more on markets in spectrum allocation.
 ? Shift. Broadcasting Fund money from the Corporation for Public
 Broadcasting to public radio stations.
 ? Abolish rules under which Washington dictates the amount and
 kind of attention broadcasters give to issues and candidates.
 These rules are: the "fairness doctrine," the "equal time" stan-
 dard, and the "reasonable access" rule.
 ? Expedite the Postal Rate Commission's decision that the Postal
 Service shall privatize its electronic mail system (E-COM).

 Transportation
 The Setting
 The Department of Transportation, along with independent agen-
 cies such as the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and the
 Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) regulate ships, trucks, buses,
 planes and airports. Prudent action on transportation safety can make
 good sense, but price and entry regulation has proven harmful to
 consumers by stifling competition.
 Current Policy
 President Reagan aims to replace red tape with free market effi-
 ciency, while preserving essential services. Congress has also em-
 braced this goal. The 1980 Motor Carrier Act eased trucking regula-
 tion; consequently, prices have fallen and quality has improved.
 Similar results have come from the 1980 Staggers Rail Act, the 1982
 Bus Regulation Reform Act, and the 1983 Shipping Act. The ICC has
 carried out surface transportation reform. But it has reached the limits
 of administrative deregulation, as evidenced by the recent court
 reversal of several decisions.
 Indeed, ICC motor carrier rate regulation may be obsolete. In 1982,
 more than 750,000 tariffs were filed, but fewer than 300 were pro-
 tested. This paper chase does little but keep carriers from charging
 market rates. On January 1, 1985, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)
 was sunset.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Sunset the ICC and transfer its residual functions. The FTC could
 handle consumer protection, while Transportation could meet
 the other few legitimate regulatory needs.
 ? Eliminate further Operating Differential Subsidies for shipping.
 ODS subsidizes shippers for differences between foreign and
 domestic manning costs. The upshot: reduced incentive to con-
 trol costs.
 ? Allow federal mass transportation capital funding for private
 contracting. Program funds now go only for new equipment. If
 such funds are available, local officials should be able to use them
 to contract with private operators who already own equipment.
 This first step would start to promote economy and flexibility.
 ? Direct the Transportation Department to study proposals to
 transfer operation of the air traffic control system from the
 Federal Aviation Administration to the private sector. Such a
 study should look at potential effects on air safety.
 ? Relieve the burden on the general taxpayer through increased
 reliance on user fees. The inland waterway system, for example,
 can expect proposals for increases in the fuel tax or similar user
 fees, which better reflect actual costs.

 Industrial Innovation
 The Setting
 Many Democrats insist that America has become a "zero-sum
 society" and that the main goal of economic policy should be well-
 shared scarcity. They conclude that the US should write off industries
 that have lost ground and concentrate only on new "sunrise" indus-
 tries. This diagnosis is misguided and the prescription is wrong-
 headed. America can improve its competitiveness in traditional
 industries that have global growth potential. To this end, firms must
 improve their use of technology and human capital. But if the
 Democratic leaders want central planning, they must forsake dyna-
 mism and life. A managed economy is a barren one, which can inch
 ahead only by copying from abroad.
 Innovation cannot be forced. Creative ideas, improved products,
 new companies and revitalized factories do not spring from the
 furrowed brows of harried bureaucrats. Rather, they are the product
 of individuals with the vision and courage to take risks. Innovation
 can only be fostered by an economic environment that encourages
 growth and the entrepreneurial spirit.
 Current Policy
 Congressional Republicans and President Reagan have made great
 strides in furthering innovation. Among their legislative achieve-
 ments: an incremental research and development tax credit; a law
 allowing businesses to retain rights to federally-funded research that
 would not violate patent laws; modification of antitrust laws to
 encourage joint research ventures; and a new intellectual property law
 covering semiconductor designs.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Until a reformed tax code is in place, extend and refine the
 research and development tax credit.
 ? Modify antitrust laws to require greater use of the "rule of
 reason" test, which would require that corporate arrangements be
 judged by their competitive effects.
 ? Allow foreign nationals who are trained here in science and
 engineering to remain in the United States after receiving their
 education.
 ? Amend the Freedom of Information Act to protect confidential
 business information. A business should be notified when a
 request is made for information it has submitted, and if it thinks
 the information should be withheld, it should have an opportu-
 nity to tell the agency why.

 Job Opportunities
 The Setting
 From 1965 through 1980, Democratic Congresses spent $85.5
 billion (1980 constant dollars) on bureaucratic programs for employ-
 ment. During that time, unemployment rose from 4.4% to 7.0%. The
 Reagan Administration took office determined to chart a more
 effective course. During the Reagan recovery, more than six million
 Americans have found work. Yet there are still pockets of joblessness.
 Now our challenge is to foster investment in human capital, and help
 workers develop the skills they need for the coming decades. One
 obstacle is the government itself. Certain federal restrictions on
 employment may have once made sense, but they clash with the
 economic conditions of the 1980s.
 Minimum wage requirements for teenagers tend to backfire by
 keeping employers from hiring teens for part-time or summer work.
 With a youth opportunity wage-set below the adult minimum-
 many teenagers could gain the experience they need to start a success-
 ful worklife. The National Conference of Black Mayors has endorsed
 the youth opportunity wage.
 Curbs on household manufacturing date from a time when high-
 tech was science fiction and few women worked in business. Today, a
 person should be able to work at home as long as there is no health or
 safety threat. Household manufacturing would help those who need
 to stay home during the day: single parents, the handicapped and the
 elderly.
 Current Policy
 The Labor Department has taken administrative action to reduce
 barriers to' household manufacturing; however, legislative action is
 desirable to support this decision. President Reagan backs the youth
 opportunity wage, which has been blocked by the House Democratic
 leadership. His Administration has met great success with the Job
 Training Partnership Act, which replaced the CETA program.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Provide tax incentives for employers to finance worker retrain-
 ing, and allow workers to make penalty-free withdrawals from
 IRAs to meet retraining expenses.
 ? Allow the long-term unemployed who now receive federal sup-
 plemental compensation payments to opt instead for reemploy-
 ment vouchers. Recipients would offer these vouchers to poten-
 tial employers, who would thus have an incentive to hire them.
 This proposal contains safeguards against displacement of cur-
 rent workers.
 ? Enact a youth-opportunity wage.
 ? Affirm the legality of household manufacturing.

 Housing and Community Revival
 The Setting
 Many communities are struggling. Population movements, chang-
 ing business patterns and rising service costs all worsen community
 decline. Past federal remedies often backfired. Urban renewal, long
 championed by big-government Democrats, uprooted neighborhoods
 and tore down four homes for every home it built. As a leader of New
 Jersey's Puerto Rican community said in 1981, "If, 80 years ago, the
 federal government had developed a deliberate plan to destroy our
 cities, it would not have been more successful than has been the case."
 Current Policy
 President Reagan is trying to break the grip of past failures. The
 Administration backs enterprise zones, which would revive depressed
 areas by cutting red tape, taxes and other government-imposed costs.
 Many states are working with this concept, and the results are
 promising. The Administration introduced its enterprise zone bill in
 1983 with over 100 Democratic cosponsors. The House Democratic
 leaders, however, have refused to let such legislation come up for a
 vote.
 Access to housing and pride in home ownership are also important
 components of community strength. Traditional housing policies
 have fallen short, so creative new programs are needed. Rental
 vouchers and increased ownership opportunities for the poor could
 help more people at no additional cost to the taxpayers.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Provide for enterprise zones. The Administration's bill would
 allow the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to name
 25 enterprise zones a year for three years.
 ? Provide further home ownership and resident management
 opportunities for families living in public housing. One way
 would be to allow tenants or tenant associations to buy their
 dwellings at no more than one-fourth of market value and with
 no down payment.
 ? Substitute housing vouchers for low-income housing programs,
 with the current voucher demonstration project as a model.
 ? Direct the Department of Housing and Urban Development to
 draft model legislation for states and localities that would encour-
 age privatization of selected public services. This approach could
 save money and foster the development of small business.
 ? As recommended by the Grace Commission, direct HUD to
 improve accounting practices and internal financial controls.
 Accounting systems are primarily manual and even where auto-
 mated, are mostly outdated.

 International Trade
 The Setting
 Over half a century ago, the United States enacted harsh trade
 barriers. Intended to help US markets, these barriers instead wiped
 out jobs and spread the Great Depression worldwide. Today, the
 Democratic leaders would repeat that blunder. They say "domestic
 content" would help the auto industry, but in fact it would provoke
 retaliation and cost hundreds of dollars per car. Their "industrial
 policy" proposals are more insidious: in the name of helping "sun-
 rise" industries, industrial policy would offer only porkbarrel and
 protectionism.
 America does face competition, but we must resist protectionist
 pressures. Open trade expands world commerce, which helps Ameri-
 cans by improving wages, opportunities and living standards. The
 best competitive response is to keep strengthening our domestic
 economy.
 Current Policy
 President Reagan opposes "protectionism and quotas which will
 make all of us worse off in the long run." But free trade must be fair
 trade: America will not stand still for unfair practices such as the
 European Community's agricultural supports or Japan's auto subsi-
 dies. Demonstrably victimized domestic markets may need a hand in
 countering certain unfair foreign trade practices.
 The United States urges other nations to follow our lead in open
 trade. President Reagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative opened US
 markets to a dozen Caribbean countries. In 1984, he signed a trade
 package that includes: extension of a generalized system of prefer-
 ences, a US-Israel free-trade area, and expansion of executive author-
 ity to respond to other countries' trade policies. As other countries
 follow this example, export subsidies, such as those of the Export-
 Import Bank, may no longer be necessary.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Urge the Administration to start a new round of trade talks
 among the GATT countries. Areas to be discussed could include:
 non-tariff barriers, agricultural products, high-tech products,
 trade in services, price-support agreements for commodities.
 ? Reduce nontariff barriers through strengthening and defining
 Multilaterial Trade Negotiation agreements.
 ? Require economic impact reports to be filed with measures that
 restrict imports.
 ? Establish a free-trade area with Canada.
 ? Link future trade assistance for US industries to adjustments on
 their part, such as facility modernization and worker retraining.
 ? Reevaluate voluntary auto import quotas.

 Export Controls
 The Setting
 The United States restricts the export of certain goods for national
 security purposes. High-technology firms face extensive rules and
 licensing procedures designed to prevent the diversion of sensitive
 technology, especially to East Bloc countries. Export licensing ties up
 some $20 billion of overseas business each year and handicaps US
 firms on the world market.
 The president's power to restrict exports is a potential tool of
 foreign policy. But President Carter's 1979 grain embargo proved that
 good intentions can lead to disastrous results. The only ones who
 really suffered were American farmers-and five years later, the
 Soviets remain in Afghanistan. Secretary of State Shultz says, "We
 should not sacrifice long-term interests in order to express immediate
 outrage."
 Current Policy
 Many current high-tech controls are ineffective. A 700-page De-
 fense Department manual of controlled technology lists common
 items such as the Apple II computer. It makes little sense to ban the
 export of technologies available from any mail order catalog. Says
 President Reagan, "With the cooperation of our Western allies, we
 should assign the highest possible control to those relatively few
 technologies with unquestionable strategic value and worry less about
 the most commonly available technologies."
 The 98th Congress did not enact an extension of the Export
 Administration Act, which authorizes presidential export restriction.
 Provisions included: streamlining licensing; assessing foreign avail-
 ability; clarifying the roles of the Commerce Department, the Defense
 Department, and the Customs Service. The Act attempts to balance
 the need to prevent diversion of sensitive technology against the need
 to ensure American competitiveness abroad.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Give a strong legislative mandate to the US Coordinating Com-
 mittee (CoCom) negotiators to strengthen controls on critical
 technology while decontrolling items freely available to the East-
 ern Bloc. Special attention should be given to developing a
 coordinated CoCom policy for high-technology trade with the
 People's Republic of China.
 ? Strengthen the Commerce Department's ability to make prompt
 determination of the foreign availability of technology.
 ? Decontrol exports of technology already available overseas.
 ? Provide relief from export disincentives by amending the Foreign
 Corrupt Practices Act.

 Free Individuals and Strong Families
 America is a rainbow coalition. This country draws strength from
 pluralism, from a great array of minds, talents, energies and faiths.
 This variety is too precious to waste; we must not let it be stifled by
 prejudice. House Republicans believe in equal opportunity, and we
 strive to end discrimination on account of religion, sex, race, or
 national origin. We favor continued vigorous enforcement of civil
 rights statutes, but the protection of freedom requires more. Policies
 for economic growth, described elsewhere in this document, enable
 people to fulfill their individual promise. A renewed fight against
 crime, started in the 1984 omnibus crime bill, can stem the fears that
 restrict every American's liberty.
 A society is only as strong as its families. Economic growth begins at
 home, because people have traditionally worked, saved and invested
 not for their own pleasure but for their families' security. The home is
 where children learn the values needed to advance civilization:
 integrity, responsibility, compassion. House Republicans fight for
 policies that support rather than shatter families. In our vision of the
 future, good families have greater opportunities to adopt; parents can
 readily find day care and quality education; the old and the handi-
 capped can live in dignity; and the young can grow up in safety.
 In this section, we suggest policy alternatives to promote all of these
 goals. In a few select cases, these key alternatives involve tax incen-
 tives. As explained earlier, though, major tax reform would require
 modification of such proposals. Similarly, budgetary constraints may
 delay implementation of several ideas. Nevertheless, our goals re-
 main.

 Women
 The Setting
 Women have gained from the economic progress of the past few
 years. While Americans on average got a 23% tax cut, married
 working women received a 31% reduction. Opportunities burgeon
 and beckon. Today more than two-thirds of the women between ages
 25 and 44 work in paid jobs. And women business-owners make up
 the fastest growing segment of the small business community.
 Still, equal opportunity does not exist everywhere-especially not
 in the House committee system. Women constitute 80% of commit-
 tee staff earning $20,000 or less, but only 23% of those earning
 $40,000 or more. The Democratic majority's leadership professes
 support for equality. Why have they failed to get their own house in
 order?
 Current Policy
 The Economic Equity Act, signed by President Reagan in 1984,
 improves the treatment of women in areas such as tax law, insurance
 and pensions. The President backs equal pay for equal work, as well as
 expanded career opportunities. More than a thousand women di-
 rected policy and operations in the first Reagan Administration.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Provide for spousal IRAs by allowing married individuals to
 compute their IRA tax deduction on the basis of the spouses'
 earnings.
 ? Forbid any level of government from enforcing a classification
 based on sex unless such a classification is necessary to achieve a
 compelling government interest.
 ? Establish a commission to study sex discrimination in the legisla-
 tive branch.
 ? Amend Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to extend the ban
 on discrimination to cover employees of the House of Represen-
 tatives.
 ? Provide employers with a tax credit for hiring and training
 displaced homemakers.
 ? Require that the Veterans Administration shall effectively inform
 female veterans about their benefits. There are more than one
 million women veterans, but the federal government has tradi-
 tionally neglected their interests.
 ? Reexamine retirement benefits for spouses of military personnel
 who are divorced during active service or retirement. Part of
 retirement pay should be guaranteed to spouses, based on length
 both of service and marriage.

 Civil Rights
 The Setting
 President Reagan has said, "Ours is a nation based on the sacred-
 ness of the individual, a nation where all women and men must be
 judged on their merit, imagination and effort, not on what they are,
 but on what they do." Jesse Jackson voiced a similar sentiment at the
 Democratic Convention: "Democracy guarantees opportunity, not
 success."
 America has made progress in extending opportunity to all its
 people, especially during the economic recovery. But our country has
 yet to achieve total justice. Many undocumented aliens cross our
 borders each day, only to be exploited by that handful of employers
 who scorn human dignity. Blacks and other minorities still face
 hurdles in pursuit of the American dream. And anti-Semitism lives
 on. Louis Farrakhan's despicable statements shocked millions of
 Americans who thought we had outgrown such bigotry. Neither party
 condones anti-Semitism; but because of certain political pressures,
 Democratic leaders refused to denounce it in their platform. The
 Republicans had no such hesitation: their platform "repudiates and
 completely disassociates itself from .... any form of bigotry, racism,
 anti-Semitism or religious intolerance."
 Current Policy
 During the President's first term, the Justice Department brought a
 large number of civil rights violators to court. The Administration
 continues to back programs to bring jobs and hope to our nation's
 inner cities. In 1983, Congress reconstituted the US Civil Rights
 Commission and extended it for six years. In 1984, the House did pass
 immigration reform legislation, but only after the Democratic leader-
 ship had blocked it for a year and a half.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Enact heavy fines and prison sentences for destruction or theft of
 religious property. Recent years have seen thousands of crimes
 against synagogues and other religious places.
 ? Enact immigration reform legislation, along the lines of the
 Simpson-Mazzoli bill.
 ? Support a constitutional amendment making naturalized citizens
 eligible for the presidency, provided they have been citizens for at
 least 11 years and are otherwise qualified . Naturalized Ameri-
 cans-even those brought here as infants-are now barred from
 the presidency. The proposed change would be a symbol of
 opportunity to all young immigrant citizens, including Mexican
 Americans, Cuban Americans and Asian Americans.
 ? Enact legislation promoting economic and social equity for
 women, as described in the section entitled "Women."

 Crime and Punishment
 The Setting
 In 1975, crime expert James Q. Wilson wrote: "Wicked people
 exist. Nothing avails except to set them apart from innocent people. .
 ... We have trifled with the wicked, made sport of the innocent and
 encouraged the calculators. Justice suffers, and so do we all."
 The Reagan Administration has moved to create a climate where
 the innocent are protected and the guilty are punished. It has in-
 creased the federal funds and personnel for crime-fighting. Through
 such actions, and by the example it has set for state and local law
 enforcers, the Administration has helped to reduce crime.
 Current Policy
 Overcoming obstruction by the House Democratic leadership,
 President Reagan and congressional Republicans spearheaded the
 most far-reaching reform of federal criminal law in history. Among
 other things, this legislation will: authorize judges to detain dangerous
 defendants, abolish federal parole, reform bail and sentencing, curb
 the insanity defense, foster the seizure of mob assets, increase penal-
 ties for drug dealers, and re-establish grants for state anti-crime
 efforts. Unfortunately, Congress failed to enact several other reform
 proposals initially included in this legislation.
 More criminals are now behind bars than ever before, and justice
 reforms will swell their ranks. The nation must move ahead with
 creative approaches to its prisons.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Provide that evidence obtained from a good-faith search shall not
 be excluded from a federal proceeding.
 ? Reform habeas corpus procedures.
 ? Explore privatization. Amend the Internal Revenue code to
 allow firms to build correction facilities and lease them to state or
 local governments; the firms would receive tax incentives. Set up
 a limited test project to estimate the savings that could result
 from the private management of federal penal facilities.
 ? Permit the transportation of certain domestic prison-made
 goods, establish tax and wage criteria for prison industry pro-
 grams, and allow for a deduction in prisoners' wages to pay for
 their room and board and to reimburse their victims.
 ? Impose the death penalty for murders committed by federal
 prisoners serving life sentences.

 Excellence in Education
 The Setting
 Between the elections of John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan,
 federal spending on education increased fivefold (adjusted for infla-
 tion), yet standard test scores plunged. Simply throwing money at the
 schoolhouse was not-and is not-the right approach to education.
 President Reagan has turned the country's attention to the need for
 educational excellence and has encouraged reform at the state and
 local levels. Our slide into classroom mediocrity has now halted.
 Efforts to increase hours of instruction, lengthen the school year and
 re-emphasize the basics have all been part of what one report calls the
 "tidal wave of school reform which promises to renew American
 education."
 Current Policy
 States pay about 50% of the cost of public schooling, while localities
 pay 42% and the federal government 8%. Although the states and
 localities have answered the President's call for improvement, there is
 still a need for federal initiatives.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? As a condition of federal aid, require: minimum lengths for the
 school day and school year, a system for student promotion based
 on achievement and attendance, and a merit pay system for
 teachers.
 ? Allow businesses a tax credit for providing math and science
 teachers with summer jobs that acquaint them with the applied
 uses of high technology.
 ? Establish an "Academic Olympics" demonstration project for the
 District of Columbia. Students from disadvantaged schools
 would compete in tests of academic skill; achievement would be
 recognized with monetary and honorary rewards. The program
 would also provide incentives to schools for improvements both
 in attendance and overall performance on standard tests.
 ? Provide for the use of federal work-study funds, together with
 donations from high-tech industries, to place college students as
 teacher's aides in high school math and science courses.
 ? Direct the Secretary of Education to develop a model proficiency
 test, similar to a bar exam, to stiffen teaching standards. State
 adoption of this program would be voluntary.

 Financing Education
 The Setting
 Widespread access to education represents an investment in a
 healthy democracy and a growing economy. In the late 1970s, high
 interest rates and inflation threatened to put education beyond the
 reach of many Americans. Economic recovery has improved the
 outlook, but hardships persist. The need for laboratory equipment
 and information technology, among other things, continues to boost
 the cost of higher education.
 Independent primary and secondary education is also hurting.
 Many poor and middle-income families send their children to inde-
 pendent schools. About 40% of these schools' students come from
 families with incomes less than $25,000; two-thirds have incomes
 below $35,000. Our public schools must prosper, of course, but there
 is room as well for the diversity and competition provided by the
 independent sector. Sociologist James Coleman says the tuition bar-
 rier to these schools is "almost certainly harmful to the public interest
 and especially harmful to the interests of those least well-off."
 Current Policy
 The Reagan Administration has restored the traditional role of the
 student and family in meeting the costs of higher education, and it has
 targeted aid to the neediest students. In 1984, over $13 billion in
 federally supported student aid was available.
 President Reagan supports tuition tax credits for the parents of
 children who attend independent primary and secondary schools. He
 believes it is a matter of fairness for families that fund public schools
 with their taxes and pay again, through tuition, for the education they
 choose for their children.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Allow families to establish a tax-deferred savings account (similar
 to an IRA) for their child's post-secondary educational expenses.
 Such a proposal would include penalties for use of these accounts
 for other purposes.
 ? Establish tuition tax credits. The full tax credit would go only to
 parents with taxable incomes of $40,000 or less. There would be
 no credit for tuition paid to schools that racially discriminate.
 ? As recommended by the Grace Commission, merge the National
 Direct Student Loan program and the auxiliary-loan program
 into the more cost-effective Guaranteed Student Loan program.
 According to the Congressional Budget Office, this step would
 save $2 billion in outlays over five years.

 Adoption
 The Setting
 Many couples yearn to adopt children. At the same time, half a
 million children live in foster homes, and only a fraction will ever be
 adopted. And of the 50,000 children for whom adoption was initiated
 in 1983, only a third were actually placed. The unadopted are usually
 "special needs" children: older, minority, or handicapped. The foster
 care system is not the best path for homeless children: according to
 several studies, a disproportionate number of prison inmates are
 products of that system.
 To compound the tragedy, many couples wanting to be parents are
 victimized by fraudulent adoption rings. Such organizations start by
 making children available to a small number of couples; this lures the
 victims, who pay thousands of dollars only to have their hopes
 shattered. Federal attention is justified because these rings typically
 cross state or national lines.
 Current Policy
 The states govern the legal and procedural aspects of adoption. The
 federal government provides money to the states to support adoption
 services. The Administration is studying methods of improving the
 system. Among other things, the Department of Health and Human
 Services is undertaking demonstration projects to promote adoption
 as an alternative for women who have unwanted pregnancies. And
 legislation signed by the President in 1984 provides grants to encour-
 age the adoption of handicapped and other hard-to-place children.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Establish a nationwide information exchange system to assist in
 matching children with good adoptive families.
 ? Provide federal criminal penalties against fraudulent adoption
 rings in interstate or international commerce.
 ? Provide further help for families adopting special-needs children.
 Adopting and raising handicapped children may entail significant
 expense; modest tax deductions could be an appropriate re-
 sponse.
 ? Direct the Department of Health and Human Services to im-
 prove data on adoption practices and procedures. Lawmakers of
 both parties want better information in this area.
 ? Direct the Department of Labor to study the question of parental
 leave for new adoptive fathers and mothers. Adoptive families
 face strenuous times of adjustment, just as birth families do.

 Child Care
 The Setting
 Since 1977, the number of preschool children with working moth-
 ers has grown by more than half. Day care is thus becoming a basic
 American need. Unfortunately, there have been cases of neglect and
 abuse by people working in day care centers. State and local standards
 for hiring and operation vary widely; more standardization might
 assure better care. Mandatory federal guidelines, however, could be so
 cumbersome and costly that they would make day care too expensive
 for those who need it most.
 It is important to distinguish between supervisory and educational
 services. The Head Start program has been Washington's best educa-
 tional effort on behalf of preschool children. Started in the 1960s,
 Head Start provides disadvantaged children with compensatory edu-
 cation, medical care and nutritious meals. Unlike most social pro-
 grams, Head Start shuns centralized bureaucratic control and it
 encourages parental involvement. According to independent analysis,
 former Head Start participants are more likely to finish high school,
 steer clear of crime and avoid teenage pregnancy.
 Current Policy
 The Reagan Administration supports Head Start because of its
 success in expanding opportunities for underprivileged children.
 President Reagan has signed legislation extending Head Start's au-
 thorization and increasing its appropriation. He has also signed
 measures to expand the program, promote even more parental par-
 ticipation and increase incentives for the program's employees.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Encourage day care by either increasing the tax credit for depen-
 dent care services for low and moderate income taxpayers, or
 providing modest tax incentives to firms for offering day care as
 an employee benefit.
 ? Aid mobile young parents by establishing a day care information
 data base, which would be accessible by home computer. People
 who move from one state to another often have difficulty in
 promptly finding day care services for their children.
 ? Continue to provide adequate funding for Head Start.
 ? Review the federal government's current leave and personnel
 policies affecting the parents of newborn infants. The federal
 government should strive to be a model employer by way of
 easing employees' child care problems.

 Protecting America's Youth
 The Setting
 Children are in danger. Thousands disappear every year, never
 again to be seen by their families. Some are abused, sexually assaulted
 or sold on the illegal-adoption market: a healthy child can bring as
 much as $30,000. Others, like Adam Walsh, are murdered.
 Missing youths are not the only victims of child abuse. Most cases
 occur in the home, and only a fraction are ever reported. Abuse may
 involve violence, or denial of such basic needs as food and medical
 care. Abusers try to cover their tracks by intimidating their victims
 into silence, whether in the home or elsewhere.
 The American people are increasingly aware of the need to protect
 children. They are rebelling against the permissiveness that spawned
 child pornography, and they support measures to track down and
 punish those who prey upon our children.
 Current Policy
 President Reagan has said that youths "should have the right and
 the opportunity to walk our streets, to play and to grow and to live
 their lives without being at risk." In June 1984, he opened the
 National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which assists
 parents and law enforcers in finding missing children. He has also
 signed bills to strengthen the federal effort against child pornography
 and to support state programs on child abuse and domestic violence.
 A number of states are helping children who become wards of the
 court. The Court-Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) program is a
 community-based effort of trained volunteers serving as advocates of
 abused and neglected children. The Reagan Administration is encour-
 aging efforts to extend CASA across America.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Mandate life sentences for those found guilty of kidnaping chil-
 dren, and require capital punishment in cases where the victim
 dies as a result of the crime. Such legislation should provide for
 exceptions in non-violent cases that arise from domestic dis-
 putes.
 ? Amend the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
 (RICO) law to extend its coverage to the sexual exploitation of
 children.
 ? Provide matching grants to states for establishing clearinghouses
 for information on missing children.
 ? Deny federal funds to youth organizations that do not screen
 employees for records of crimes against children.
 ? Direct the Department of Health and Human Services to study
 the causes and symptoms of teenage suicide.

 Home Care for the Elderly
 The Setting
 Thanks to medical innovations, Americans are living longer.
 Within sixteen years, the number of Americans over 85 will double.
 Increased longevity is good but it brings a challenge, because elderly
 people often need help to care for themselves. About 1.3 million now
 live in nursing homes. However well-run a nursing home may be, it
 cannot supply the freedom of a private dwelling or the emotional
 warmth of a family. Many nursing home residents are only moder-
 ately impaired, so they could live alone or with family if adequate
 assistance were available.
 The federal government and the states annually pay $14 billion for
 nursing home care under Medicaid. Medicare pays an additional half-
 billion dollars for extended care services. Alternatives to institutional-
 ization could decrease admissions, save money, and even improve
 care.
 Current Policy
 President Reagan firmly believes in strengthening families and
 neighborhoods. For example, the Department of Health and Human
 Services is undertaking a demonstration program to compare the
 costs of home care and community-based services with the cost of
 institutional care.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Provide tax credits for home care of elderly relatives who would
 otherwise be institutionalized. Another alternative would be tax
 deductions for home care of elderly relatives suffering from
 disabling ailments such as Alzheimer's Disease.
 ? Establish a nationwide system of long-term care centers to co-
 ordinate services for the elderly such as nutrition and homemak-
 ing. The program would be national in application but decentral-
 ized in administration, involving on a local basis the people who
 are to be served.
 ? Support research and demonstration projects on home care
 technologies. Assistive devices can help the impaired elderly
 prepare food and perform other household chores. In emergen-
 cies, electronic monitoring systems could summon aid to seniors
 who are alone.

 Handicapped and Disabled
 The Setting
 In years to come, American science will conquer deafness, blind-
 ness, paralysis and other handicaps. Meanwhile, however, our coun-
 try must give a hand up to those who suffer these disadvantages. Over
 five million Americans need help in such basic daily activities as
 walking and dressing. Thirteen million have work disabilities.
 Government has to avoid policies that foster dependency. Handi-
 capped people should have opportunities to live and work on their
 own-not only for their sake but for the country's. The United States
 would have been a poorer place if Franklin Roosevelt or Helen Keller
 had not taken up an active life.
 Current Policy
 President Reagan has declared 1983-1992 the Decade of Disabled
 Persons. During his term, minimum accessibility guidelines have
 been adopted and he has signed legislation making it easier for the
 handicapped to register and vote. He is also committed to enforcing
 laws barring discrimination against any otherwise handicapped peo-
 ple, in any program receiving federal aid.
 The Job Accommodation Network, a computerized system created
 by the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped,
 helps employers determine what physical and other accommodations
 are necessary to help handicapped people do their jobs.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Establish a computerized job bank to match disabled people with
 jobs they can perform. For instance, a person who has trouble
 walking could be matched with a position that does not require
 much mobility.
 ? Provide a tax deduction for the purchase of teletypewriters for the
 deaf and the speech-impaired.
 ? Hire handicapped youths as congressional pages. The New York
 State Legislature has been successful in employing handicapped
 people as messengers.
 ? Permanently authorize the law allowing disabled persons on
 Supplemental Security Income (SSI) to work gainfully without
 losing medicaid benefits. Disabled program participants cannot
 easily buy private health insurance; loss of medicaid would
 discourage those who would otherwise want to work. This provi-
 sion saves money because SSI does not pay cash benefits to the
 self-sufficient.

 Welfare
 The Setting
 In 1964, big government declared war on poverty-and poverty
 won. During the Eisenhower-Kennedy prosperity, the percentage of
 Americans in poverty had plummeted, but under Great Society
 programs, improvement slowed and then stopped. By President
 Carter's last three budget years, poverty was growing at a 9.1 % annual
 rate.
 Why the failure? The only dependable route from poverty is work,
 family and faith in the future. Our welfare system smothers all three.
 Transfer payments and social services can add up to a package that
 makes work look like a bad bargain. The government encourages
 minor unmarried parents to move away from home by offering higher
 benefits if they do so. And by stressing redistribution over opportu-
 nity, welfare destroys hopes for individual initiative.
 Current Policy
 President Reagan has started to heal the damage. His economic
 policies have created new jobs and have beaten the needy's worst
 enemy-inflation-thereby guarding their buying power. His Admin-
 istration has launched real welfare reform by targeting benefits to the
 needy through tighter eligibility standards. In August 1984, he signed
 legislation to address the failure of many absent parents to pay child
 support.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Require minor unmarried parents to stay with their parents or
 legal guardian in order to receive welfare benefits.
 ? Improve income verification in means-tested assistance pro-
 grams. The Congressional Budget Office says this step would save
 $1.5 billion over five years.
 ? Require states to adopt workfare programs. A number ofjurisdic-
 tions have had great success with workfare, which requires
 ablebodied welfare recipients to earn their check in whole or part
 by doing community work. According to Senator William Prox-
 mire, workfare reminds recipients "of the discipline of work,
 getting up in the morning, reporting on time, making an effort
 and getting paid for it."
 ? Authorize pilot projects to integrate human service delivery
 systems. There are over 60 federally-funded programs for direct
 human service delivery; this maze confuses the needy and tempts
 the undeserving to manipulate welfare to their advantage.

 Natural Resources and
 Human Frontiers
 A century and a half ago, Alexis de Tocqueville described our land
 this way: "Those costs so well suited for trade and industry, those
 deep rivers, that inexhaustible valley of the Mississippi-in short, the
 whole continent-seemed the empty cradle of a great civilization. It
 was there that civilized man was destined to build society on new
 foundations, and for the first time apply theories till then unknown or
 deemed unworkable, to present the world with a spectacle for which
 past history had not prepared it."
 The spectacle goes on. American genius and American resources
 are combining to make life better for generations to come. One
 scholar put it well when he spoke of "technologies of freedom."
 Scientific progress promises to liberate human beings from the shack-
 les of distance, scarcity and disease. To those who talk about limits to
 growth, we say, "Look to the skies." American space missions show
 that there are no limits to what the human mind can do.
 Recent years have also brought renewed respect for the environ-
 ment. Our legacy to the future must include cleaner air, water and soil,
 as well as more efficient use of natural resources. Our grandchildren
 should be able to behold the same natural beauty that Tocqueville
 saw.
 Here we discuss how government can foster progress in both the
 natural world and the world of the mind.

 Space
 The Setting
 On January 13, 1920, a New York Times editorial scoffed at Dr.
 Robert Goddard's prediction that rockets would someday go into
 space. Everybody knows that rockets cannot fly in a vacuum, said The
 Times, so Dr. Goddard "seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily
 in high schools." As we know now, Goddard's work laid the founda-
 tion for modern rocketry and space exploration.
 Shortsighted criticism continues to this day, but space flight has
 brought benefits in communications, weather forecasting and many
 other areas. And most recently, the space shuttle missions have
 boosted national pride and inspired a new generation of Americans.
 Space holds boundless promise. With zero-gravity and a near-
 perfect vacuum, people working in space could make products that
 are difficult or impossible to manufacture on the ground. Interferon,
 which could help in cancer treatment, now is very expensive but
 could be produced in orbit at a practical cost.
 Current Policy
 In his 1984 State of the Union address, President Reagan an-
 nounced that he was directing NASA to develop a manned space
 station. Supporters of the project say that a manned station would
 outperform an unmanned one by allowing a greater variety of experi-
 ments and more flexibility in fixing sudden technical problems.
 Congress has appropriated $155 million for initial work on the
 program; NASA will issue a report this spring.
 The President has also signed legislation providing for the commer-
 cialization of land remote-sensing satellites, an early step toward
 extending private enterprise into space.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Support continued development of a manned space station,
 maximizing the private sector's role in defining the American
 mission in space.
 ? Adopt a policy of recovering the full cost of space shuttle services
 from commercial users, and encourage development of alterna-
 tive launch services by private business.
 ? For tax and tariff purposes, treat articles made aboard American
 spacecraft as if made in the United States. Currently, space-based
 businesses could not enjoy the same treatment as their earth-
 bound counterparts.
 ? Promote marketplace efficiency in space by having firms bid for
 orbital slots for their communication satellites. (Allocation of
 slots is now a complex bureaucratic decision.) Competition
 would produce lower telecommunication costs for consumers.

 Basic Research
 The Setting
 Basic research is the quest for scientific knowledge that does not
 necessarily have short-term applications. In the long run, however,
 investments in basic research pay huge practical dividends. Just as the
 development of penicillin stemmed from a seemingly arcane study of
 bread molds, the twenty-first century's medical cures and technical
 breakthroughs hinge on today's basic research.
 The congressional budget process has handicapped federal efforts in
 this field. Scientific research projects often take years to carry out, but
 Congress budgets the money one year at a time; long-range planning
 suffers as a result. Numerous and lengthy congressional hearings also
 take a significant amount of time from agency officials involved with
 research.
 Current Policy
 Federal support for civilian basic research rose 23% in real terms
 between fiscal 1982 and 1984. The Administration has re-established
 a traditional approach to this area by strengthening basic research and
 allowing the private sector to fund potentially profitable ventures in
 applied research. The Special Analyses volume of the 1985 budget
 stated the Administration's position this way: "The continued growth
 of scientific knowledge in fields such as mathematics, physics, chem-
 istry, biology and the various engineering disciplines provide the
 foundation for the achievement of long-term national objectives of a
 strong defense, economic security, and an enhanced quality of life."
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Retain a strong commitment to the funding of basic research, as
 reflected in the Administration's recent budgets.
 ? Improve the budgeting process for research and development.
 Among steps recommended by the Grace Commission: initiate
 multiyear budgeting, reduce the level of detail required in re-
 search budgets, and tighten the budget review cycle. According to
 the Commission, the resulting increase in efficiency would save
 $3.7 billion over three years.
 ? Allow scientific and education organizations to issue tax-exempt
 bonds to finance scientific facilities and equipment for colleges
 and universities.
 ? In research funding decisions, expand the use of peer review by
 scientists and engineers. Peer review would help prevent the
 misallocation of research funds for political purposes.
 ? Provide further incentives for creativity by giving federal labora-
 tory employees greater proprietary rights to technology they
 develop.

 Energy Innovation
 The Setting
 The federal government has spent billions of tax dollars to develop
 new energy sources and wring more energy from existing sources. The
 results to date have been disappointing. According to the Grace
 Commission, federal energy research is hampered by duplication of
 effort and unseemly competition for funds. Indeed, the greatest boon
 to applied energy research thusfar has been President Reagan's com-
 mitment to deregulation, which encourages private entrepreneurship
 and industrial creativity.
 One specific problem area has been the Synthetic Fuels Corpora-
 tion, created under the Carter Administration to help finance the
 production of synthetic oil and gas. Poor management and a changing
 energy market have hobbled the Corporation.
 Current Policy
 The Reagan Administration wants to curb direct government
 involvement in the commercialization of new energy technologies.
 Accordingly, it has sought to reduce funding for a number of applied
 research programs. Nevertheless, it backs basic research.
 In 1984, the President recommended a $9 billion cut for the
 Synthetic Fuels Corporation. Although Congress approved a smaller
 cut, there would have been no reduction at all if the House Demo-
 cratic leadership had prevailed.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Abolish the Synthetic Fuels Corporation.
 ? Charter a private energy research trust fund, voluntarily financed
 by the energy industry, to take over most of the applied research
 that our taxes now support. This approach would remove politics
 from this research and reduce federal outlays.
 ? Continue to support energy-related basic research.

 Fossil Fuels
 The Setting
 Coal, oil and natural gas supply most of America's energy. During
 the late 1970s, we underwent a fossil fuel crunch, which President
 Carter blamed on "a crisis of the American spirit." Under the Reagan
 Administration, however, our fossil fuel situation has improved
 dramatically. US oil production has gone up and imports have gone
 down. Gasoline prices have fallen. Natural gas prices are levelling off.
 Coal fulfills a growing share of our domestic energy needs and it
 strengthens our foreign trade position. For every ton we import, we
 export more than a hundred.
 President Reagan's policies have furthered this energy abundance.
 During his first month in office, he ended the remaining price controls
 on crude oil and petroleum products. Confounding the old-line
 defenders of regulation, decontrol helped consumers and spurred new
 production.
 Current Policy
 The Reagan Administration supports efforts to reduce and modify
 the federal role in fossil fuel markets. At the same time, it has been
 guarding against import disruptions by filling the Strategic Petroleum
 Reserve to the equivalent of 200 days of OPEC oil.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Decontrol enhanced-recovery natural gas. The term refers to
 natural gas contained in existing sources but which would not be
 available without special techniques.
 ? Enact a "contract carriage" provision for natural gas pipelines,
 which would provide incentives for supplying the least expensive
 gas possible.
 ? Repeal the Fuel Use Act of 1978. This law forbids new
 powerplants from using natural gas or petroleum as their main
 fuel. Existing plants must go off these fuels by 1990. These
 requirements contribute to higher prices and misallocations.
 ? Abolish mandatory auto fuel economy standards. Such regula-
 tion was supposed to hasten production of efficient small cars;
 however, it was the marketplace, not the government, that
 brought about fuel conservation. Now these standards block
 production of large (but relatively efficient) cars and thereby
 jeopardize thousands of auto industry jobs.
 ? Make the coal leasing system more flexible so that developers can
 promptly adjust to market fluctuations. Under current law, if
 developers cannot find a market for their coal, they cannot mine
 it, and must forfeit the lease and all other opportunities despite
 their good faith intentions.

 Nuclear Energy
 The Setting
 Nuclear reactors, which annually generate 300 billion kilowatt-
 hours of electricity, could provide America with a virtually inexhaust-
 ible energy supply. Utilities, however, are being forced to abandon
 nuclear projects worth billions of dollars. Some of the difficulty stems
 from valid concerns about safety, but federal red tape is also to blame.
 The laws governing this industry have not been overhauled since the
 1950s, and a quagmire of federal rules prolong construction time,
 divert the industry from vital safety work, and impose new require-
 ments without regard to overall plant and industry safety.
 As Canada has shown, it is indeed possible to develop nuclear
 energy safely and efficiently. No planned reactors have been cancelled
 there, compared with 105 US orders dropped since 1972. The Canadi-
 ans take half as long to build their reactors as we do, and they are even
 exporting nuclear-generated power to the US.
 Current Policy
 President Reagan supports nuclear power, and the Department of
 Energy has proposed reforms to streamline nuclear powerplant licens-
 ing. The 97th Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which
 sets up a schedule for the building of nuclear waste repositories.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Encourage the development and use of standardized nuclear
 powerplant designs and improve the efficiency of the licensing
 process.
 ? Renew the Price-Anderson Act, which provides government
 indemnity to back up companies insuring nuclear powerplants,
 and which sets a liability limitation.
 ? As soon as possible, ratify state compacts for the disposal of low-
 level waste.
 ? Reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission so it can make
 decisions more promptly and effectively. One option is to replace
 with present five-member Commission with a single adminis-
 trator who has clear authority and is accountable to Congress and
 the President.

 Critical Materials
 The Setting
 American industry relies heavily on foreign suppliers for materials
 such as chromium and manganese. This dependence casts a shadow
 on national security: for instance, a single jet fighter requires over a
 ton of such critical minerals. They also go into essential civilian
 technologies, such as pollution control.
 Supplies could be disrupted by foreign wars, international political
 upheavals or other causes. To buffer the potential blow to national
 defense, the federal government has established a stockpile of certain
 strategic materials. But the stockpile is now out of balance: there is a
 surplus of some materials and a shortage of others.
 Current Policy
 In July 1984, President Reagan signed the National Critical Materi-
 als Act of 1983. This law sets up a council to develop a national
 program for research and innovation. The Administration has also
 created a special advisory committee, which will make recommenda-
 tions on strengthening the domestic minerals industry and reducing
 our dependence on imports.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Make it easier for the government to barter for critical materials.
 The Commodity Credit Corporation has $10 billion worth of
 surplus agricultural products, many of which could be traded to
 other countries in return for the materials we need. And from the
 stockpile itself, we could barter surplus materials for those that
 are now in short supply.
 ? Start a salvage program. The government's obsolete machines
 and vehicles often contain important metals that could be ex-
 tracted before the possessions are thrown away. Cobalt and lead
 could be salvaged from jet engines and car batteries, for instance.
 ? Use strategic materials as collateral. High-debt nations that pos-
 sess needed materials could ship them here for storage. The US
 government would then issue the depositing country a warehouse
 receipt that could help secure credit for the export of American
 goods. The United States would not own the materials (therefore,
 no budget outlay), but we would reserve the right to buy them
 during an emergency.

 The Land
 The Setting
 Parks, national forests, wilderness areas and other public lands
 make up nearly one-third of America's land area-mostly in the
 West. Land can often be put to alternative uses, such as recreation or
 resource development. Balancing these competing interests-provid-
 ing for "multiple use"-is a basic task for public land management.
 Until the Reagan Administration, the consensus of those living in
 the West was that the federal government had bungled its responsibil-
 ities by paying too little attention to local needs.
 Current Policy
 After President Reagan's election, the federal land agencies started
 to regulate more reasonably and take greater account of state and local
 advice. The Administration aimed to enhance energy and mineral
 production on public lands. This effort originally met with strong
 opposition, but Interior Secretary William Clark worked to quell
 controversy.
 In 1981, the Administration found that past neglect had left our
 national parks in shabby shape: many even had health and safety
 hazards. The Administration has since undertaken a five-year, $1
 billion program to restore the park system. The President supports
 further parkland acquisition now that the system is recovering.
 In 1984, Congress approved more wilderness bills than at any time
 in the past twenty years. The legislation protects a total of 8.3 million
 acres.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Establish a central databank to enable businesses and conserva-
 tionists to learn which lands are available for which purposes.
 Land use plans are filed in local offices, but the absence of a
 central databank has led to confusion.
 ? Step up sales of unneeded public land, and deposit the receipts in
 the general fund. This is a Grace Commission proposal, which
 the Congressional Budget Office says will save $130 million over
 five years.
 ? Require federal agencies involved in public land management to
 incorporate in their rules provisions for the continuous involve-
 ment of state governments in public lands policy.
 ? Set up a computer directory and registration system for parks,
 monuments and recreation facilities. Many are now underused.

 Environmental Protection
 The Setting
 Our country has gone a long way toward making the environment
 safer and healthier. By most measures, the air is cleaner now than
 when the Clean Air Act passed in 1970, and we have also seen
 improvement in the quality of surface water. But the work is not
 finished. In parts of the country, rainfall is more acidic than normal;
 many people worry that acid rain may be killing aquatic life and
 damaging buildings. The United States produces some 250 million
 tons of toxic waste each year. Safe management of these wastes is a
 continuing challenge, and many old dumps are polluting the environ-
 ment. Before 1981, the federal government had not spent one dollar to
 clean up these dumps, but now the Superfund has started to remedy
 the problem.
 Hazardous waste and other contaminants are getting into our
 groundwater. Although the states must have the main responsibility
 for carrying out groundwater protection, the federal government
 should help.
 Current Policy
 The 98th Congress did not act on reauthorization of the Clean Air
 Act. In 1984, the House voted to reauthorize the Clean Water Act, but
 the issue did not reach the Senate floor. Also in 1984, President
 Reagan signed a bill strengthening and extending the Resource Con-
 servation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the main law regulating hazard-
 ous waste management. In that year alone, the Administration spent
 $410 million under the Superfund program to clean up toxic waste
 dumps. It supports a reauthorization of this program. And the 98th
 Congress agreed to President Reagan's request to double acid rain
 research funds.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Enact a strong reauthorization of the Clean Air Act.
 ? Step up research into acid rain's causes, effects and potential
 remedies.
 ? Enact a strong reauthorization of the Clean Water Act.
 ? Enact a Superfund reauthorization that would, among other
 things, hasten cleanup and encourage development of innovative
 environmental technologies.
 ? Use private inspectors to augment federal and state programs for
 hazardous waste site inspection. (Under the RCRA bill, EPA will
 soon report on this option.) Insurance companies that write
 environmental coverage have a great incentive to take part.
 ? Strengthen the Safe Drinking Water Act to improve groundwater
 quality. In 1984, the House passed such a bill, but the full Senate
 did not take it up.

 Soil Conservation
 The Setting
 One-third of our cropland is eroding at rates that harm its long-term
 productivity. Because of depressed farm income, farmers push more
 marginal land into production, in an effort to cover their losses with
 greater volume. Ironically, this worsens erosion.
 Current Policy
 The US Agriculture Department provides farmers with technical
 and financial help to encourage soil conservation. Yet over two-thirds
 of federally financed soil conservation practices have been applied to
 land that has little potential for significant erosion. The Department
 has developed a targeting program to direct resources where they are
 most needed; however, this program requires close monitoring.
 Federal commodity programs may conflict with conservation.
 Farmers often bring fragile land into production, aiming to expand
 their "base" for acreage reduction programs. High support prices
 encourage farmers to intensify their production strategies, which
 often increases the land's exposure to wind and water.
 Tax policy also clashes with conservation. Landowners, often
 absentee, reap capital gains benefits by buying fragile rangeland at low
 cost, then cultivating and selling it for a higher cost as farmland with
 an acreage base. Landowners do not receive tax credits for conserva-
 tion practices.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Support the Sodbuster concept, which would deny participation
 in farm programs for erodible land brought into production for
 the first time in ten years, unless it has an approved conservation
 plan. Conversely, to receive technical soil conservation assis-
 tance, farmers should be required to take part in commodity
 programs.
 ? Apply the Sodbuster concept in the tax structure to deny capital
 gains benefits to those who bring highly erodible land into
 production for the first time in ten years. This could help finance
 soil conservation tax credits.
 ? Develop a conservation base, which would encourage producers
 not to plow fragile lands in an effort to increase their acreage base
 for commodity programs.
 ? Support private sector initiatives to foster activities such as
 conservation tillage.

 Commodity Stabilization Programs
 The Setting
 Harvested crop acreage grew by 55 million acres during the 1970s,
 and farm indebtedness increased 75% from 1976 to 1980. Hurt by the
 Carter grain embargo, a depressed world economy, high interest rates
 and inflation, the farm economy fell to its lowest point since the Great
 Depression. Surpluses were swollen by farmers who were trying to
 produce their way out of the doldrums and were responding to high
 price supports. Foreign competitors also responded to high US prices
 supports. Between 1979 and 1983, for instance combined wheat
 production from foreign sources rose from 38 to 61 million metric
 tons.
 Current Policy
 Commodity stabilization programs try to support prices and stabi-
 lize farm income. A principal price tool is the non-recourse loan,
 which eligible farmers may obtain by using their crop as collateral. If
 the market price tops the congressionally-set loan level, the farmer
 sells the crop and repays the loan. If the market price goes lower than
 the loan level, the farmer turns the crop over to the Commodity
 Credit Corporation in repayment, with no further obligation.
 Target prices are an income-stabilization tool. Congress sets a target
 price per bushel or pound of a given commodity. When the market
 price goes lower, producers receive a "deficiency payment" for the
 difference between the two, or the difference between the target price
 and the loan level, whichever is less.
 In 1981, Congress curbed the Agriculture Secretary's power to set
 loan and target rates in response to the market. Congress has since
 annually passed a "mini farm bill" to adjust rates. Although these
 tools aim to reduce uncertainty, constant changes actually increase it.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Enact a new farm law to replace the 1981 legislation. Without
 new legislation in 1985, many outdated laws would go back into
 effect and important programs such as Food for Peace would
 expire.
 ? Set the loan rate as a percentage of the 5-year moving average
 price, with the high and low years disregarded. This will orient
 the loan rate to the market, and reduce the chance that it will
 interfere with world markets.
 ? Authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to set target prices.
 ? Provide that high carryover stocks of major commodities will
 trigger increased export credit for those commodities. Any result-
 ing cost would be offset by lower outlays for target prices.
 ? Phase out paid land diversion.
 ? Disqualify small "hobby" farms from price support programs.

 Fair and Efficient Government
 As James Madison wrote, "If men were angels, no government
 would be necessary" Today, people are still not angels, but their
 government can be fair and efficient. House Republicans believe in
 the power of ideas rather than the idea of power. Debates should be
 settled by the strength of ideas, not by artificial rules contrived to tilt
 the playing field. This principle is at risk in today's House of Repre-
 sentatives. A Democrat of the past once called for a "Fair Deal," but
 the House Democratic leadership has used the rulebook to magnify its
 already-formidable power. Fair?
 A truly representative government is close to the people. House
 Republicans heed President Eisenhower's warning against con-
 centrating too much power in a policymaking elite. Citizen participa-
 tion and decentralization continue to be guiding principles.
 Government also has a duty to be efficient. People work hard to pay
 their taxes, so every needless government expenditure cheats them of
 their labor.
 In two years, America will celebrate its Constitution's bicentennial.
 By enacting proposals outlined here, Congress can remain true to the
 standard of statesmanship that was born in Philadelphia during the
 hot summer of 1787.

 Sunshine in the House
 The Setting
 The House of Representatives belongs to the people, but the people
 cannot get an accurate picture of its workings. The printed record is
 open to distortion and the televised record is incomplete. Able to
 work in the shadows, the Democratic leadership has managed to keep
 the House from even considering such vital issues as the balanced-
 budget amendment. The public is aware that something is amiss, and
 increasingly distrusts the institution. Since 1966, says the Harris Poll,
 trust in Congress has fallen by more than half.
 Current Policy
 Not long after assuming the Speakership, Mr. O'Neill said, "We
 need a system which insures accountability" (Congressional Record,
 October 12, 1977, p. 33443). His tone then changed. In a 1979
 interview, he said, "We have too much openness" (New York Times,
 June 4, 1979, p. D10). The Democratic leadership has since refused to
 take reform seriously.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Provide for full and unedited broadcasting of House proceedings.
 Viewers should be able to see who attends floor debate and how
 each member votes. Under current procedures for televising floor

 Fairness and Efficiency in the House
 The Setting
 The House of Representatives has become a wasteful bureaucracy
 whose autocratic and partisan Democratic leaders have held the reins
 tightly for too long. No institution can stay in the same hands for
 more than thirty years without giving way to tyranny and excess.
 Under Democratic mismanagement, the legislative process has suf-
 fered and the people have been denied the representation they
 deserve. Committee ratios are but one example: Democrats hold a
 disproportionate share of committee assignments. One House Demo-
 crat recently conceded that the Republicans won 41.8 percent of the
 House seats "and they ought to have close to 41.8 percent of the
 committee assignments in order that the House will more fairly reflect
 the American electorate."
 The bloated cost of running Congress-seven times what it was in
 the mid-1960s-is another symptom of institutional senility. The cost
 of the franking privilege more than doubled between 1981 and 1984.
 Serious efforts for equity and efficiency must be undertaken to right
 past wrongs and to ensure that, no matter which party governs, the
 minority party is treated fairly.
 Current Policy
 The Democratically controlled House undertook no major institu-
 tional reforms in the 98th Congress.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Make committee ratios proportionate to party strength in the
 House.
 ? Stem the proliferation of subcommittees and other legislative
 panels. Consolidate those whose jurisdictions overlap.
 ? Require each House committee to adopt an oversight agenda.
 These agendas would then be incorporated into a resolution for
 full House consideration. This requirement would bring order
 and clarity to what is now a haphazard process.
 ? Make waivers of House rules harder to obtain; ensure that such
 waivers are publicly recorded.
 ? Establish a bipartisan committee to screen proposals before they
 are made eligible for consideration under a suspension of the
 rules.
 ? Stop excessive use of the congressional frank. Methods might
 include: limiting personal office allowances for computer lists
 and use of computers for targeted mailings; and reducing the
 annual number of postal patron mailings from six to four.

 Campaign Finance
 The Setting
 America needs strong political parties to focus political debate and
 encourage citizen participation. Federal law hampers our parties by
 limiting the sums they may directly give their federal candidates or
 spend on their behalf. At the same time, the law allows wealthy
 individuals and groups to spend unlimited amounts on independent
 expenditures. These sources have every right to participate, of course,
 but they should not supplant broad-based political parties as the main
 factor in campaigns.
 One proposed remedy-public financing-has serious drawbacks.
 Not only would it further weaken parties and allow bureaucrats to
 control elections, it would give incumbents an even greater edge than
 they enjoy already. To match incumbents' local fame, challengers
 must make greater campaign efforts-which would be hard to do
 under the expenditure caps entailed by public financing schemes. And
 to be truly effective, such proposals would have to cover primaries as
 well as general elections; this would mean enormous expense.
 Current Policy
 The House Democratic leadership brought no major campaign
 finance legislation to the floor during the 98th Congress.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Convert the current 50% credit for contributions into two sepa-
 rate credits: a 100% credit for small contributions to congres-
 sional candidates from the taxpayer's home state; and a 50%
 credit for contributions to political parties. This would end the
 existing credit for other sorts of political contributions and it
 would suspend the new credits should the revenue loss exceed
 that for the existing credit. By broadening the contributor base, it
 would strengthen parties and give them an advantage over fund-
 raising organizations not entitled to the tax credit.
 ? Remove limits on the amounts that party committees may spend
 on behalf on congressional candidates, and raise the limits on
 how much they may directly give to the candidates. This would
 foster a closer relationship between parties and their candidates.

 Federalism
 The Setting
 Washington, DC, is no place to make choices for Kansas City or
 San Jose. As much as possible, domestic public policy should be made
 in the statehouses and town halls, where the people can best keep an
 eye on their public servants. In the years before the Reagan Adminis-
 tration, the federal government restricted state and local discretion by
 developing hundreds of categorical grant programs, each tightly bun-
 dled with rules and red tape. According to New York Mayor Edward
 Koch, federal directives amounted to a "mandate millstone" that
 stifled creativity and imposed needless costs. As he put it: "As a
 member of Congress, I voted for many of [these programs] with every
 confidence that we were enacting sensible permanent solutions to
 critical problems. It took a plunge into the Mayor's job to drive home
 how misguided my congressional outlook had been."
 Current Policy
 "The federal government did not create the states," said President
 Reagan in his first inaugural, "the states created the federal govern-
 ment." In 1981, he persuaded Congress to consolidate 57 categorical
 grant programs into 9 block grants, which are broader and less
 restrictive. This consolidation cut annual paperwork by six million
 hours and allowed federal agencies to reduce the staff associated with
 the predecessor categorical programs by 80%. His Administration has
 also improved intergovernmental relations by giving state and local
 officials greater opportunity to air their views of federal aid programs
 before final decisions are made.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Further consolidate federal assistance into block grants.
 ? Require the federal government to report the total direct costs
 imposed on state and local governments by federal rules.
 ? Forbid the federal government from imposing further mandates
 unless it reimburses states and localities for the resulting costs.

 Voluntarism
 The Setting
 The big-government era hinged on the notion that government
 programs are the only way to handle social problems. That philoso-
 phy implied a cynical view of our country's spirit: civic responsibil-
 ities have to be squeezed out of Americans in the form of tax dollars.
 Nonsense. Americans have always been the world's most generous
 people. In the 1830s, Tocqueville observed that citizens were forever
 forming associations to improve community life. Today there are
 some 375,000 charitable organizations-ranging from the Red Cross
 to small local service clubs-which spend over $100 billion a year.
 And millions of Americans serve their fellow citizens either through
 informal groups or as individuals.
 Voluntary efforts can be far more sensitive than bureaucratic social
 programs in addressing social needs. Government's challenge is not to
 supplant these efforts but to nurture them.
 Current Policy
 President Reagan has used the moral authority of his office to
 encourage voluntarism. His Task Force on Private Sector Initiatives
 amassed a databank of innovative efforts and organized local task
 forces throughout the country.
 Despite the President's commitment to voluntarism, IRS bureau-
 crats have deemed volunteer officials of charities to be personally
 liable for the charities' tax problems. This can only serve to discourage
 volunteer service.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Authorize a test of the semi-postal device. Used throughout
 Europe, semi-postals are postage stamps with a surcharge, whose
 proceeds go to charity. (They are issued in addition to, not instead
 of, regular stamps. Purchase is voluntary.) This way, the govern-
 ment could help private organizations for the aged, handicapped,
 or homeless without raising taxes or appropriating funds.
 ? Allow federal agencies to accept the voluntary services of individ-
 uals and nonprofit organizations to carry out any appropriate
 agency activities.
 ? Provide that volunteer officials of a charity shall not be person-
 ally liable for any failure of the charity to pay taxes.

 A Strong America in a Peaceful World
 In 1956, President Eisenhower said: "The force and impact of one
 word-Peace-reach all persons, all problems in our land. Its mean-
 ing embraces past achievements, present problems, future hopes. It
 touches all things in our life and knowledge: from home and school,
 factory and farm, to the most distant points on earth-a frontier in
 Europe, an island in the Pacific, a canal in the Middle East. And this
 meaning reaches, too, from the highest kind of principle to the most
 personal kind of fact."
 House Republicans are guided by the related principles of peace
 and freedom. We aim to keep our children out of war, and we hope for
 a world where all children can grow up in a true democracy. Indeed,
 ensuring individual freedoms can promote peace both at home and
 abroad.
 Pursuit of our principles must be grounded in realism. Unlike the
 now-dominant wing of the Democratic Party, we know that the Soviet
 leaders are not like Americans. These leaders think of "security" only
 as communist control, and they will snatch every chance to further
 such control. Only through strength can we bring the Soviets to just
 and lasting agreements.
 Warfare and terror can erupt from other countries, too; our govern-
 ment must keep a watchful eye on places such as Libya and North
 Korea. But we also realize there are opportunities for peace and
 partnership. The United States should deepen its friendships with
 emerging nations in Latin America, Asia and Africa, as well as with
 our traditional allies.
 President Reagan has done much to advance peace and freedom
 across the globe. He has rebuilt our defenses, raised our prestige and
 restored realism where his predecessor had wandered. Now we are
 poised to bargain from a position of strength across the range of arms
 control issues.
 No matter how much we have done, America will have much more
 to do in the years to come. Congress ought to back the Administra-
 tion's basic principles rather than undercut them. While exercising
 proper oversight, lawmakers should refrain from disrupting the daily
 workings of diplomacy and defense. Within budgetary constraints,
 Congress must keep strengthening our armed forces.
 This section explores ways of improving national security and
 foreign relations.

 US-Soviet Relations
 The Setting
 In 1939, Winston Churchill called the Soviet Union "a riddle
 wrapped inside a mystery inside an enigma." Its internal decision
 processes remain shrouded, and its rhetoric-by turns encouraging
 and threatening-can still puzzle the most learned Kremlinogist. But
 the character of its actions is utterly clear. Soviet foreign policy has
 always been ruthless and aggressive. Over the years, some political
 leaders have ignored this simple fact, preferring to believe that "the
 Soviets will see their interests the same as we see ours," as one put it.
 Because of the pressure exerted by these leaders, especially during the
 1970s, the United States did not always resist Soviet power. The result
 was predictable: continued Soviet support for terrorism and guerrilla
 warfare against democracies, and an unrelenting military buildup.
 The Reagan Administration, however, has taken a different tack
 resulting in a more realistic and stable relationship. By recognizing the
 basic differences in American and Soviet goals, the Reagan Adminis-
 tration has sought to work with the Soviet Union in areas such as
 arms control while at the same time refusing to bow to Soviet
 demands.
 Current Policy
 Until recently, the Soviet Union refused to meet with American
 negotiators unless the United States made unilateral concessions.
 Scheduled talks between Secretary Shultz and Foreign Minister Gro-
 myko, however, have added a hopeful note to the situation. In any
 future talks, the Administration will not sacrifice its basic principles
 on arms control, trade and Soviet aggression and adventurism in the
 free world. The President reasserted this policy in his victory speech
 on election day.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Carry out confidence-building measures such as: establishment
 of risk reduction centers in Washington and Moscow; accelerated
 improvement in the "hot line"; mutual agreement for advance
 notification of all strategic test launches and training exercises
 involving American, Soviet, Warsaw Pact or NATO forces.
 ? Expand cultural and scientific exchanges with the Soviet Union.
 ? Maintain the credibility of the American security guarantee to
 our allies in Western Europe, Asia and the Americas.
 ? Provide regular and systematic consultation between the United
 States and its allies to maintain unity in the face of Soviet
 diplomatic and military pressure.

 Arms Control: Soviet Compliance
 The Setting
 In a 1984 news story, a working man from House Speaker O'Neill's
 home area was asked about arms control. Nobody wants war, he said,
 but "a lot of people don't trust the Russian government-not the
 Russian people, the government; it has murdered millions of its own
 people..... Look at Poland and Afghanistan. If we're going to get rid
 of these nuclear bombs, we have to strike a bunch of deals with a
 murderous dictatorship, and be damn sure they keep to their side of
 the agreement!" His comments reflect America's mood: a desire for
 arms control, and a concern for verification. Over the years, the
 United States and the Soviet Union have reached a series of arms
 control agreements, most notably the SALT I and SALT II accords.
 Recent intelligence revelations, however, indicate that the Soviets
 have violated many agreements, both in spirit and letter.
 Current Policy
 The Administration has proposed: reducing the number of strategic
 warheads to 5,000 on both sides, abolishing intermediate nuclear
 forces in Europe (and limiting forces that could substitute for them),
 curtailing conventional forces in Europe, and banning chemical and
 biological weapons. The Administration has also sought procedures
 to assure Soviet compliance with the Nuclear Threshold Treaty.
 According to Administration policy, any agreement must be verifi-
 able and enforceable. Soviet compliance remains the obstacle to arms
 control.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Oppose needless congressional constraints on arms control.
 ? Provide greater opportunities for public presentation of evidence
 on Soviet non-compliance.
 ? Strengthen the compliance oversight office of the Arms Control
 and Disarmament Agency while creating similar offices in the
 Department of Defense and the National Security Council.
 ? Pending improvement in verification and introduction of a
 policy for ensuring Soviet compliance, avoid agreements need-
 lessly limiting American options on strategic defense and anti-
 satellite warfare. But press for talks on the future of such systems.
 As in all arms talks, avoid hard-to-verify provisions.

 Strategic and Theater Nuclear Forces
 The Setting
 One of the Reagan Administration's first goals was restoring our
 strategic deterrent by rebuilding and improving the nuclear arsenal.
 The Administration responded to Soviet deployment of 378 SS-20
 intermediate range nuclear missiles by continuing the deployment of
 the Ground-Launched Cruise Missile and the Pershing II missile in
 Western Europe. The SS-20 missiles, each carrying three warheads,
 can strike all NATO military targets and European population cen-
 ters, as well as similar targets in Japan. The past four years have seen
 improvement in the Trident submarine and the missiles it carries.
 The strategic triad's land and air-based legs have not fared as well.
 Congress has approved only a fraction of the 100 MX missiles the
 President has requested, linking funding in the next fiscal year to
 arms-control progress. The 99th Congress should promptly address
 the issue of strategic weapons if the United States is to improve its
 strategic position.
 Current Policy
 In the continuing resolution passed at the end of the 1984 session,
 Congress approved 21 MX missiles for production, pending reautho-
 rization in the next Congress. The B-1 bomber has been funded for
 production through fiscal 1985; total procurement will reach 52
 bombers by the end of that year. In addition, the Trident submarine
 and cruise missile programs have received modest support from
 Congress. The air-launched cruise missile, however, has been can-
 celled in anticipation of the stealth cruise missile.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Continue deployment of the MX. Congress should approve funds
 to harden existing silos and, in light of Soviet silo improvements,
 upgrade present MX warheads. Minuteman missiles, including
 guidance and warheads, should also be improved. Continue the
 maneuverable warhead (MARV) program.
 ? Support research and development of the Midgetman, a single-
 warhead mobile ICBM that should serve first as a follow-on to
 MX and then as its replacement.
 ? Meet the fiscal 1988 deployment goal of 99 B-1 bombers.
 ? Support development of the stealth bomber, which will give the
 United States a significant penetrating capability well into the
 twenty-first century.
 ? Procure additional Tridents with new and improved ballistic
 missiles and continue with plans to deploy sea-launched cruise
 missiles.
 ? Continue to improve strategic command and control functions.

 Strategic Defense
 The Setting
 The Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty of 1972 orginally allowed
 the United States and the Soviet Union to maintain two ABM sites
 each. A subsequent agreement between President Nixon and Chair-
 man Brezhnev reduced that number to one. The United States built,
 then dismantled, a nuclear ABM interceptor system around a Minute-
 man installation. The Soviet Union continues to maintain an ABM
 network around Moscow. Early in the Reagan Administration, presi-
 dential advisors and organizations raised the question of renewed
 ABM defense. In March 1983, the President outlined plans for
 research into a strategic defense program. Congress has provided
 limited funds for research, none for procurement. To date, testing has
 yielded positive results: a missile launched from the continental US
 was intercepted and destroyed by a non-nuclear ABM projectile over
 the South Pacific. In the 1960s, ABM systems compensated for
 shortcomings in guidance by using nuclear devices to increase the
 interceptor's destructive range. Because of the improved guidance of
 today's systems, the intercepting missile does not now require a
 nuclear warhead.
 Current Policy
 Administration policy has focused on research and development.
 When seeking $1.7 billion in the Defense Authorization bill, the
 Administration had indicated that the funds would be used only for
 continued development and testing of alternative ABM systems.
 House-Senate action on the 1985 Continuing Resolution set the figure
 at $1.4 billion.
 Policy Alternatives
 Policy alternatives are limited by the President's intention to abide
 by the 1972 ABM Treaty. With the Treaty's scope, however, several
 policy options are available:
 ? Promptly study the requirements of deploying a point defense
 ABM system around an existing Minuteman field as allowed by
 the Treaty. This would provide experience in ABM management
 and increase the survivability of part of our land-based ICBM
 force.
 ? The President, in consultation with Congress, should review the
 ABM Treaty and continued US adherence, given the changes in
 strategic offensive systems in the last decade, and the shift in
 relative strength of Soviet and US strategic forces.
 ? Emphasize the development of a credible strategic defense
 through the establishment of an agency within the Defense
 Department to evaluate and test the technical and strategic
 aspects of ballistic missile defense.

 Anti-Satellite Warfare
 The Setting
 Anti-satellite warfare is a phenomenon of the highly technical
 character of strategic weaponry and intelligence-gathering in the
 1980s. As military planners have tried to deal with the changing
 nature of conflict, satellites have become increasingly important to
 national security. Satellites now track missiles, detect troop move-
 ments, provide rapid communication, forecast combat-relevant
 weather, and provide electronic sensing and highly detailed photogra-
 phy of once inaccessible parts of East Bloc countries. The United
 States and the Soviet Union have come to rely on space-borne
 systems as a source of information in peacetime and an active
 military element in any possible conflict.
 Current Policy
 President Reagan has designated Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson as
 Director of the Strategic Defense Initiative with responsibility for
 coordinating space weapon and anti-satellite (ASAT) efforts. Con-
 gress has shown reluctance toward ASAT, and in the fiscal 1985
 Continuing Resolution, limited the number of tests. Furthermore,
 these tests cannot be conducted before March 1985, so that Congress
 and the President may reconsider their impact on arms control.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Promptly approve testing of ASAT systems in excess of the
 current three-test limit.
 ? Support continued development of Strategic Defense and ASAT
 systems. Limited procurement funds should also be approved
 upon presidential assessment that the Soviets will not make
 reasonable agreements in this area.
 ? Defend current satellites by: storing replacement satellites in
 space or on the ground for quick launch; hardening satellites
 against attack; providing satellites with evasive capability; de-
 ploying more satellites with backup capabilities.
 ? Improve and harden ground-based communications networks as
 backups to satellite systems.

 Legislating War Powers
 and Foreign Policy
 The Setting
 The Constitution provides both the president and Congress a role
 in foreign policy and national security. But as Alexander Hamilton
 wrote in The Federalist #47, "Of all the cares and concerns of
 government, the direction of war most peculiarly demands those
 qualities which distinguish the exercise of power by a single hand."
 Resolving this tension is a perennial problem of American govern-
 ment. The War Powers Resolution, passed in 1973, requires the
 President to consult with Congress before sending troops into hostil-
 ities, and curbs executive authority to keep those forces in hostile
 situations. The law was enacted in reaction to the Vietnam War, but
 there is little evidence that it would have prevented American in-
 volvement in Southeast Asia: Congress consistently and continually
 supported such involvement. Congress has enacted many other re-
 strictions on foreign policy. Currently, 17 House committees and 19
 Senate committees have some jurisdiction over foreign affairs. Sup-
 porters of strong executive authority say this fragmentation of power
 hampers our role in the world. According to President Ford, "You
 can't have 535 commanders in chief. You can't have 535 secretaries of
 state."
 Current Policy
 In the 1983 Chadha decision, the Supreme Court cast doubt on the
 War Powers provision allowing Congress to force withdrawal of
 troops fighting overseas. President Reagan has questioned the con-
 stitutionality of other provisions as well.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Amend the War Powers Resolution to eliminate the 48-hour
 notification provision and the 60-day deployment limitation.
 ? Establish a presidential-congressional closed committee to allow
 for formal dialogue on foreign policy.
 ? Convene regular informal meetings on foreign policy between
 members of Congress and executive officials.

 Terrorism
 The Setting
 Concrete barriers surround the Capitol. Citizens must pass through
 metal detectors to visit their lawmakers. And all over the world,
 tyranny's opponents worry that they will be silenced by a bullet or a
 bomb. Terrorism is spreading. The past decade has brought 6,500
 terrorist incidents, and 2,500 were directed against Americans. The
 carnage in Beirut underscored the human cost. And the attempted
 murder of the British cabinet in Brighton showed once again how
 hard it is to prevent terrorist attacks. State-sponsored terrorism-
 which Senator Henry Jackson called "warfare by remote control"-is
 a new and dangerous development. Countries such as Libya and
 North Korea sponsor terrorism to gain strategic advantage when
 conventional methods fail. Behind them often stands the Soviet
 Union, which provides training and financial support, and which
 remains ready to scavenge the wreckage the terrorists cause.
 Current Policy
 In 1984, the President signed legislation providing for a number of
 steps to fight terrorism, including rewards for those who furnish
 information that helps the government catch terrorists. The Adminis-
 tration's policy is to take the initiative against known terrorists, so it
 can stop them before they can act.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Continue to improve our ability to gather intelligence about
 terrorist groups and consider the use of pre-emptive force against
 terrorists on a case-by-case basis.
 ? Explore an international agreement for consultation in the event
 of a nuclear incident brought about by a terrorist act.
 ? Ensure that American military and diplomatic personnel con-
 tinue to take the proper steps, through administration and train-
 ing, to protect themselves against terrorists.
 ? Improve security at all American embassies and overseas offices.
 ? Provide for federal punishment of diplomats who use firearms to
 commit felonies. Diplomatic immunity could now be abused so
 as to shield terrorists: in 1984, a Libyan hit man killed a British
 police officer but could leave the country unpunished because he
 had diplomatic immunity.

 Intelligence
 The Setting
 Since the formation of the House and Senate Select Committees on
 Intelligence, Congress has increasingly influenced intelligence policy.
 Congress has curbed covert action in Central America and elsewhere.
 Lawmakers have criticized intelligence agencies for apparent failures
 to forecast the Shah's downfall, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
 and attacks on US diplomatic posts, to name a few. American
 intelligence has indeed had its shortcomings-stemming largely from
 an erosion of morale and support, which hit bottom in the 1970s. But
 the intelligence community did better than that period's headlines
 suggested. As President Kennedy once told CIA officials, "Your
 successes are unheralded, your failures are trumpeted."
 Current Policy
 The Administration has restored the intelligence community's
 vitality, but skepticism and even hostility linger among congressional
 Democrats. Under their pressure, Congress has hampered operations
 through curbs on intelligence-gathering and covert action, and
 through news leaks calculated to torpedo operations. The Intelligence
 Committees were intended to be non-partisan, but politics has col-
 ored their work, especially when intelligence activities have involved
 foreign policy controversies. On the positive side, Congress has
 responded to Administration requests for improved intelligence re-
 sources, and has exempted certain sensitive intelligence files from the
 Freedom of Information Act.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Revise Intelligence Committee appointment procedures to en-
 sure an orderly transition of membership. And to protect the
 intelligence community's budgetary interests, the Committee
 should continue to emphasize its current policy that some of its
 members serve on either the Appropriations, Armed Services,
 Judiciary or Foreign Affairs Committees. Before the establish-
 ment of the Intelligence Committees, each of these bodies had
 exercised oversight in this field.
 ? Ensure that sensitive classified material from the Intelligence
 Committee is shared with other committees on a case-by-case
 basis only.
 ? Establish criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of classi-
 fied information by those with access to sensitive information.
 Criminal penalties currently apply only to unlawful disclosure of
 communications intelligence, identities of covert agents and
 energy-restricted data.
 ? Continue procurement of technical intelligence systems and im-
 prove recruitment of intelligence agents, with an emphasis on
 ethnic and native-speaking candidates.

 The Americas
 The Setting
 "It must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples
 who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by
 outside pressures," said President Truman in 1947. Today, that
 principle is being tested in Central America. Communists are trying to
 topple El Salvador's democratic government. Nicaragua's Sandinista
 regime abets this effort, in addition to repressing religious and politi-
 cal liberty within its own borders. Throughout the region, Cuba and
 the Soviet Union supply freedom's enemies with arms and ammuni-
 tion. Countries elsewhere in the Americas possess vast natural re-
 sources, but most lack the funds and technology needed to use them
 effectively. As a result, these nations have relied on US economic and
 military assistance. The international debt crisis has grown worse as
 South American countries such as Bolivia continue to borrow from
 the International Monetary Fund and other lending institutions.
 Current Policy
 The bipartisan Jackson Commission advised long-term support for
 democratic development in Central America through economic and
 security assistance and strong-willed diplomacy. President Reagan is
 working to carry out the Commission's recommendations, with 70%
 of his aid program earmarked for social and economic development.
 He has encouraged the Contadora group's efforts at regional talks, and
 he supports the democratic aspirations of the Nicaraguan people.
 Relations between the US and South America have improved. The
 1984 US-Brazil Cooperation Pact, covering economic and cultural
 issues, signaled renewed US interest in the continent.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Continue economic and security assistance to El Salvador, Hon-
 duras, Guatemala, Costa Rica and friendly South American
 nations.
 ? Supply military and non-military support to the anti-Sandinista
 freedom fighters in Nicaragua and Honduras.
 ? Establish a scholarship program to enable Central American,
 South American and Caribbean students to attend colleges in the
 United States.
 ? Consider reestablishing a "School of the Americas" in a friendly
 country in the region.
 ? Continue to improve diplomatic and unofficial exchanges on the
 range of issues affected the United States and its South American
 allies, with particular emphasis on drug trafficking and its link to
 international terrorism.

 Asia
 The Setting
 Once dependent on American aid, Asia's free nations now have the
 fastest-growing economies in the world. Japan has become one of
 America's main trading partners, while economic exchange with the
 Republic of Korea has risen over 4,000% in the last twenty years. This
 rapid increase in trade has also brought diplomatic and economic
 strain between the United States and its Asian allies. At the same
 time, our common security interests remain strong.
 Current Policy
 Relations with the People's Republic of China continue to improve
 while we maintain a strong commitment to the Republic of China on
 Taiwan. American military forces are in Korea, Japan and the
 Philippines. Our goal remains to ensure a peaceful Asia, and there is
 concern over increased Soviet military strength in the region. The
 Administration has urged Japan to improve its self-defense. Ameri-
 can policy also emphasizes the growth of the free Asian economies,
 along with robust and fair trade.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Review the current disposition of US forces in Asia. Consider the
 addition of another naval fleet dedicated to Northeast Asian
 defense, thereby freeing the Seventh Fleet to patrol the Indian
 Ocean and Southeast Asian waters.
 ? Continue to back the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
 (ASEAN). Encourage the discussion of a joint ASEAN-US accord
 in addition to the present bilaterial arrangements.
 ? Before considering normalized relations with Vietnam, seek a full
 accounting of the remaining American MIAs and POWs, as well
 as the removal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia.
 ? Encourage the continued growth of democracy in Asia.
 ? Provide further impetus to Asian economic growth through
 support of current Administration efforts to reduce trade protec-
 tionism in Asia.

 Africa
 The Setting
 The continent of Africa has posed difficult policy questions for the
 United States since the end of the Second World War. During its
 transition from colonial status to complete independence, Africa has
 suffered problems that also plague other quarters of the Third World:
 political instability, economic stagnation, armed conflict and wide-
 spread starvation. One foreign policy challenge is to help Africa solve
 its problems so that it may use its great natural resources for economic
 development. Another is to stand firmly for freedom and democracy.
 We must never watch idly as a government denies basic human rights
 to the majority of its people simply because of the color of their skin.
 Current Policy
 The Administration has engaged in diplomatic efforts to resolve
 international conflicts on the African continent and has directed
 significant aid to the starving people of Ethiopia. Its goal is to assist
 Africa in becoming economically competitive, resistant to Soviet
 influence, and receptive to human rights. As President Reagan said
 when congratulating Bishop Tutu on his Nobel Prize: "All Americans
 join me in recognizing your labors in seeking to promote non-violent
 change away from apartheid, toward a form of government based on
 consent of the governed and toward a society that offers equal rights
 and opportunities to all its citizens without regard to race. The United
 States has heard the appeal for justice voiced by South Africans who
 suffer under apartheid rule."
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Continue US relief to those suffering from famine, especially in
 the Horn of Africa. Oppose the misuse of US and international
 funds.
 ? For the longer run, join with African nations in preventing such
 disasters. Specifically, US aid programs should persuade them to
 move away from policies that worsen economic decline. Instead
 of subsidizing socialism, we should seek to export democratic
 capitalism.
 ? Continue to speak out against national policies that codify preju-
 dice, such as apartheid. Although the United States should
 acknowledge improvements in human rights where they have
 occurred, our country is in a unique position to press for further
 positive change.

 Middle East
 The Setting
 The United States has long tried to bring peace to the Middle East.
 Despite our best efforts, Lebanon remains in turmoil. At the same
 time, however, our determination to play an active role in the Camp
 David process has won us support from moderate Arab countries.
 Israel's partner in the Camp David Accords, Egypt, has been a force
 for stability. The Administration has supported Egypt and other
 moderate regimes against subversion, and it wants them to take part
 in efforts seeking a long-term settlement of the region's disputes. For
 three decades, the United States has had a strong relationship with
 Israel. We are allies in defense of freedom. Our country helps Israel
 maintain its strength not just because it is in our national interest to
 do so, but because it is morally right.
 Current Policy
 President Reagan continues the American effort at making peace.
 His willingness to stand up to Libya has made moderate nations in the
 region feel more secure. The Administration's skillful crisis manage-
 ment throughout the Iran-Iraq war has kept that conflict from damag-
 ing our vital interests. As the President has said, "We'll keep open the
 Straits of Hormuz, the vital lifeline through which so much oil flows
 to the United States and other industrial democracies. Making this
 clear beforehand, and making it credible, makes a crisis much less
 likely."
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Reaffirm that the United States should not recognize or negotiate
 with the Palestine Liberation Organization so long as it continues
 to promote terrorism, rejects Israel's right to exist and refuses to
 accept UN Resolutions 242 and 338.
 ? Continue economic and military aid to Israel while encouraging
 the Israelis in their efforts at constructive dialogue with their
 Arab neighbors.
 ? Promote political reform in Lebanon and encourage the
 estblishment of security arrangements that will allow for an
 Israeli withdrawal.
 ? Continue working for better relations with the moderate Arab
 world while seeking to isolate radical states such as Libya and
 Iran.

 NATO and the Western Alliance
 The Setting
 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is one of the
 strongest alliances the world has known. While NATO's basic unity
 remains firm, the United States and its allies have had differences on
 certain issues. There has also been debate as to Western Europe's
 contribution to defense efforts. We must encourage these nations to
 assume responsibilities that more closely match their capabilities.
 Some European political forces advocate neutralism, equating the
 United States and the Soviet Union because of their superpower
 status. But neutralism's popular support does not run deep. In recent
 European elections, victory went to parties that support deployment
 of intermediate range missiles. Only the Dutch leaders have chosen to
 delay deployment. In handling differences with our Western allies,
 then, a serious policy of persuasion and cooperation will bring results.
 Current Policy
 The Administration strongly supports NATO. According to Am-
 bassador Kirkpatrick: "There is no perfect alliance. There are no
 perfect friends, and as James Reston commented concerning this
 debate on NATO defense improvement: `There is no perfect security.
 There is only the struggle. With friends at our side doing the best we
 can.' The American Government and the people it serves have every
 intention of continuing that struggle, side-by-side with our European
 friends."
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Continue current deployments of Pershing II and cruise missiles.
 ? Encourage Western European nations to shoulder a greater bur-
 den of their own conventional defense.
 ? Establish a monitoring bureau to evaluate the political, economic
 and security aspects of NATO and its relationship to the Soviet
 Union and the Warsaw Pact.
 ? Encourage our European allies to support democratic initiatives
 in Central America.
 ? Strengthen NATO by encouraging France to contribute military
 support.

 United Nations
 The Setting
 During what would be the last 100 days of his life, Franklin
 Roosevelt announced the formation of the United Nations. In doing
 so, he voiced his hope that the UN would be a force for liberty and
 peace. Since then, however; the democracies have often stood in
 lonely opposition as the forces of collectivist tyranny have bent the
 UN to their will. In 1983, Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick put it this
 way: "Americans still believe in the ideals and goals of the UN
 Charter. As in the past, the people of this country are ready to serve
 and support them-with our efforts and our money. But we will not
 be accomplices in a betrayal of those ideals and goals. To do so would
 mock the good faith of all the Americans whose tax dollars support
 our activities here."
 Current Policy
 The Administration supports continued American participation in
 the United Nations, but with reservations about its politicization and
 occasional "radicalism." Congress has echoed this concern with
 legislation requiring the State Department to report annually on UN
 members' voting records. The February 1984 report shows that
 countries receiving substantial American aid consistently supported
 the Soviet Union against American policy objectives. The US has
 withdrawn from the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organi-
 zation, citing "endemic hostility toward the institutions of a free
 society."
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Curb US contributions to the UN. Options include a freeze on
 contributions, or rollback to 1980 levels.
 ? Continue the accountability policy, linking foreign aid to UN
 members' voting records.
 ? Stem espionage by Soviet Bloc employees, through strict enforce-
 ment of PL 47-357.
 ? Work with other free nations to study formation of a United
 Nations of the Democracies. A world body composed of coun-
 tries sharing our values might be a better forum for confronting
 concerns now slighted by the UN, such as terrorism. (Formation
 of such a body would not imply contemplated withdrawal from
 the UN.)
 ? Review the option of capping US contributions to the World
 Bank and International Monetary Found. Study the possibility of
 a rollback to 1980 levels.
 ? Refrain from returning to UNESCO until it resumes its original
 purposes and principles.

 Armed Forces
 The Setting
 Under President Reagan's leadership, the armed forces are recover-
 ing from the declines they suffered during the Carter Administration.
 Improvements in morale, weaponry and training have bolstered
 readiness and combat sustainability. In the Air Force, tactical sortie
 time is up 70%, and adversary combat training is up 30%. With
 congressional approval, the Administration is on its way toward
 meeting the goal of a 600-ship Navy. Marine recruitment has been at a
 peak and recruits' test scores stand at record levels. For the Army, the
 Administration has stressed improved battlefield weapon systems.
 Current Policy
 The Administration backs further development of the armed
 forces. It continues to review the use of high technology in national
 defense.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Give immediate attention to the systematic upgrading of aging
 naval vessels. By planning to replace them, Congress can keep up
 a reasonable production pace, improve military capability and
 cut costs by avoiding disruption of production facilities.
 ? Propose that the Marine Corps consider an experiment with
 British model unit assignments, in which soldiers may spend
 their entire career in a single unit. Such assignments should be
 limited and experimental, pending evaluation. If successful, this
 effort would build on the Marines' comradery and other basic
 strengths.
 ? Renew emphasis on the purchase of light attack and transport
 helicopters for the Army. Current inventory is aging. The light
 unidesign helicopter is an inexpensive option for strengthening
 anti-armor capabilities, especially in Europe.
 ? Provide officers and enlisted personnel with greater opportunities
 to learn the languages and cultures of areas of possible conflict.
 This would improve combat and intelligence capabilities.
 ? Increase production and stockpiling of modern ammunition and
 supplies. Through false economies in these important accounts,
 past Congresses hindered improvements in readiness and com-
 bat sustainability.

 Unconventional Warfare
 The Setting
 Mao Zedong explained the guerrilla's philosophy: "Make wiping
 out the enemy's effective strength our main objective; do not make
 holding or seizing a city or place our main objective." Since the
 Korean War, the United States and its allies have often had to
 confront such military opposition. Vietnam and insurgencies against
 friendly governments such as El Salvador are but two examples.
 Terrorism places new responsibilities on American forces, which
 remain oriented toward the traditional World War II style warfare.
 The renewed emphasis on the Army Rangers and Special Forces,
 Navy SEALs and the secret DELTA force has had some triumphs in
 opposing unconventional foes. Yet US forces in the field basically
 remain unable to confront what has become the combat technique of
 the 1980s.
 Current Policy
 The Reagan Administration has increasingly emphasized the cre-
 ation of forces dedicated to unconventional combat. As a result, the
 Army Special Operations Command and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
 Special Operations Agency were formed. The Special Forces have
 increased manpower ceilings and non-traditional units such as Delta
 Force have received favorable consideration.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Organize a coordinating task force in the office of the Secretary of
 Defense to assess the military requirements and develop mission
 responsibilities for non-conventional warfare by selected units.
 ? Tailor military assistance to guerilla-besieged countries to the
 special requirements of such warfare. Instructors should be thor-
 oughly schooled in guerilla strategy and tactics. Military assis-
 tance should be predicated on the special needs of combat with
 emphasis on small arms, night fighting and detection devices,
 and helicopter gunships and transports.
 ? Initiate research on special warfare weapons and tactics that
 would allow the United States to take the offensive against
 guerrillas.
 ? Establish a coordination mechanism with the Office of the
 Director of Intelligence at the cabinet level to insure that Defense
 Department efforts complement the paramilitary operations of
 the intelligence services.

 Manpower and Veteran Issues
 The Setting
 Much of the Defense budget goes to manpower and personnel.
 Military analysts say these expenses are justified because conven-
 tional deterrence hinges on the human element. Aside from pay,
 personnel expenditures include: retirement and veteran benefits,
 hospital and medical benefits, commissary and PX privileges, and
 education benefits. Service personnel may attend college in off-hours
 at reduced cost or save for their post-service schooling through the
 military participatory education fund, which requires a small individ-
 ual contribution. Policy analysts have suggested alternatives to the
 current military retirement system. But the system's defenders argue
 that the military's purpose is to fight, which requires young and
 dynamic people who voluntarily stay in the service. Retirement at
 twenty years guarantees a young force and is a key element of
 personnel retention.
 Current Policy
 The all-volunteer force has seen dramatic improvement in the
 number and quality of its recruits. Retention remains high and force
 levels remain strong. The Administration's policy is to increase
 salaries and benefits to keep pace with the private sector, with an eye
 toward holding onto those finishing their first or second term of
 service.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? Preserve the all-volunteer force, with emphasis on retention in
 critically short areas. Study the increased use of pay bonuses for
 recruitment and retention.
 ? Increase pay for enlisted personnel, particularly in the non-
 commissioned officer ranks and hard-to-fill occupational areas:
 combat troop assignments and drill sergeants.
 ? Review the Veterans Administration's medical construction re-
 quirements for increased future need and provide funds to
 improve outpatient services.
 ? Encourage the formation of a working group of private pension
 plan representatives and Defense Department officials to study
 alternatives to the current military retirement system. Such
 alternatives, however, should not reduce the level of benefits for
 those now serving in the armed forces.

 Defense: Economy, Efficiency
 and Management
 The Setting
 From President Kennedy's heyday to President Carter's nadir, the
 Defense Department's share of the budget sank from almost 40% to
 less than 25%. The Reagan Administration has addressed this decline
 by proposing increases in the defense budget. As a result, the way the
 Pentagon spends money has come under closer scrutiny. But the
 allocation of resources is not the only area of defense management
 that needs study. The organization of the Department itself, both its
 civilian and military structures, requires investigation to determine
 whether procedural and structural changes are warranted.
 Current Policy
 The Administration has ferreted out areas of mismanagement and
 waste. The Carlucci initiatives and the Planning Programming and
 Budget System (PPBS) revisions have both addressed the Pentagon's
 shortcomings in budgeting and acquisition. The Defense Department
 has carried out internal reviews aimed at improving fiscal practices.
 Policy Alternatives
 ? To improve management and save costs, establish two-year
 cycles for budgeting, authorization and appropriation for defense.
 ? Consolidate overlapping offices in the Defense Department.
 ? Review the Department's organizational structure, which has not
 significantly changed since the National Security Act of 1947.
 ? Consolidate strategy planning under a National Security Council
 group. This group would have expanded powers for and review.
 Currently, most cabinet departments many agencies share
 responsibility in this area.
 ? Consider placing the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the formal military
 chain of command with responsibility for all services and the
 various unified, specified and joint commands.
 ? Improve procurement: strengthen the Defense Resources Board
 to coordinate service and agency budgets; establish an indepen-
 dent agency to evaulate weapons; require guarantees on weapon
 systems whenever it is cost-efficient to do so; implement multi-
 year contracting based on quality and cost; improve computer
 systems for procurement.
 ? Consider cost-saving initiatives: close underused military facili-
 ties and consolidate operations; standardize parts, equipment
 and inventory procedures.
 ? Work toward consensus between the legislative and executive
 branches on a stable level of growth for the defense budget.

 Conclusion
 A longtime Democratic operative recently noted "the country is in
 transition. The Republicans understand this better and they're setting
 the national political agenda." He was right. America is in transi-
 tion-from an age of big government to an age of individual initia-
 tive, from a period of vacillation on the world stage to an era of peace
 and freedom buttressed by American strength. Republicans do under-
 stand this better. Our party is setting the national political agenda. As
 political scholar James Q. Wilson has observed, "the Republican
 party has become the party of change." This document helps continue
 the Republican commitment to progress and points to new directions
 for the future. Here we have offered ideas for tomorrow and practical
 choices for today. Our proposals can open the way for a better future,
 but they are only a start. Government cannot-and should not-set
 down a narrow path for society to follow. Each American must be free
 to make his or her own future. Government's challenge is to nurture
 that freedom. The Committee on the First One Hundred Days
 recognizes the need for leadership that stimulates individual creativ-
 ity and therefore presents Ideas for Tomorrow, Choices for Today as a
 set of policy alternatives for the 99th Congress and beyond.
