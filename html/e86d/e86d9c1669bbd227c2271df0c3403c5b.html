 Ma4ORANDTM FOR:  Mr. Dulles
 SUBJECT       :  Brief of a Speech Delivered by Mr. William Benton
 before the Economic Club of Chicago
 Mr. Benton's talk on "The Soviet Economic Challenge" stresses the
 necessity for America to gear up for this camitng ccmapetition.  He points
 out four elements of Soviet economic strength, as follows:
 (1)  The economic growth of the Soviet Union in industrial
 production.  Here Mr. Benton makes reference to your
 U. S. Chamber of Commerce speech (see page 5).
 (2)  The Soviet trade offensive.
 (3)  The coming challenge to the dollar by the ruble in which
 he states that Mikoyan may be plannlrtg a revolution in
 international finance.  The ruble will, have gold and a
 growing flood of commodities as its backing.
 (4+) The Soviet challenge in the field of foreign aid.  During
 the next decade, according to Mr. Benton, this may turn
 out to be the gravest threat to the Western World due to
 the accelerating aid program of the Soviets and the scale
 with which it is handled.
 Mr. Benton makes mention of the Soviet economic system and, on page
 12, he states that "Allen Dulles has expressed the cautious hope that
 education may prove the Achilles heel of the Soviet system".
 Mr. Benton makes the following suggestions:
 (4)
 Continue to maintain and build up our defense establishments.
 Produce at full capacity.
 Develop new ways to stimulate private investment abroad,
 Particularly in undeveloped countries.
 Reduce tarfffs and trade barriers and
 (5)  Strengthen
 cultural America's programs of international information
 exchange.

 Dear Allen:
 I congratulate you on your candid and important speech
 on Wednesday night - even though my associates think
 it is one reason why my own speech on the same night
 in Chicago received so little publicity.   I got six or
 eight inches in the Times and you got a full page.  But
 believe me I wasn't trying to compete.   I think you may
 be interested in my speech nonetheless, and it was un-
 doubtedly a shocker to the Economic Club of Chicago.
 I quote you in it as I find i so often do in my speeches.
 I am attaching it.
 Si cerely,

 Address by Honorable William Benton
 Annual Meeting, Economic Club of Chicago
 Chicago, April 8, 1959
 THE SOVIET ECONOMIC CHALLENGE
 I congratulate the Economic Club of Chicago and its president,
 Jim Downs, on this series of talks.  Your club has been focussing on
 the gravest economic problem of our time -- indeed of any modern
 time. You can hope that out of this series you may have a better
 chance to understand the problem and to do something about it.
 I have not read the papers of my three predecessors on your
 speaking program.   I didn't want to find out that they'd stolen my
 stuff and I didn't want to be accused of stealing theirs.  But I know
 something of their views -- for example, of my friend Philip Reed's
 comforting prediction that it will take the USSR a century to catch
 up with the U.S. in production of electric power.
 Thus I suspect that I shall be more of a Cassandra than they.
 Tonight I cannot be the optimist I've often been in my activities in
 Chicago, which began when I first came here to work in 1928 as
 Assistant General Manager of Lord & Thomas.  Chicago generates op-
 timism.                  It seems safe and it has been sure.   It is the world's
 greatest business city.   It is world capital and symbol of economic
 productivity.  For 100 years it has specialized in putting its broad
 shoulders behind what can't be done -- and then doing it.
 In this city where my business interests againcenter and
 where my oldest son has settled for his business life -- I am not
 happy tonight as prophet of danger and potential disaster.

 As I try to peer into the future, I shall begin with an
 aphorism: the risk of underestimating the opposition is much graver
 than the risk of overestimating it.   This is more than merely a good
 general rule for business executives when they appraise their competi-
 tion.                   It is far more important when we Americans now seek to appraise
 the USSR.  It is far more applicable when the opposition is armed
 with hydrogen bombs.  Here we face no mere matter of the P and L
 statement, but a matter of life and death.
 We should have learned this rule in 1949, when the Soviets
 exploded their first atomic bomb years before we thought they could.
 We should have re-learned it in 1953, when they exploded a hydrogen
 bomb -- and again years ahead.  We did begin to learn it in 1957 when
 the first sputnik went into orbit.
 This rule of power politics -- the rule that a country should
 not underestimate its opposition -- will be superficially examined
 by me tonight in the field of trade and economic rivalry -- in other
 words, in terms of the Soviet economic challenge.
 'Way back in 1955 Nikita Khrushchev told a group of U. S.
 Congressmen: "We value trade least for economic reasons and most for
 political reasons."  This statement mirrors orthodox Communist theory.
 In 1957 Khrushchev put this even more sharply.  In an oft-
 quoted statement, he said, "We declare war on you     in the peaceful
 field of trade.  We declare war.  We will win over the United States.
 The threat to the United States is not the ICBM but in the field of
 peaceful production. We are relentless in this and it will prove
 the superiority of our system."

 Khrushchev finds many who believe him.  A few months back,
 our government discovered to its chagrin that President Kubitschek
 of Brazil was circulating a memorandum estimating that the Soviet
 Union, in the not too distant future, will be our superior in indus-
 trial production.  By 1980, when many Chicagoans in this room may
 hope still to be alive, Dr. Kubitschek's document estimated Soviet
 gross national production at the rate of $1,561 billions annually,
 and that of the U. S. at only $858 billions or about half.
 Yes, the USSR means to cross swords with us in the battle of
 production and trade.   She throws down her gauntlet to us as the
 leading economic power in the world.   She feels sure she has the
 weapons for a successful challenge and many foreign observers agree.
 To help us decide whether we must now roll up our sleeves
 and tighten our belts, let us examine some of the elements of Soviet
 economic strength.   I shall give you four.
 The Soviet rulers claim  that by 1965 the economic defeat of
 capitalism will have been accomplished, though the United States is
 expected to continue to struggle against the inevitable and will not
 yield production leadership to the USSR until 1970.  By then, the
 world-wide moral and political defeat of the United States and of
 its private enterprise economy will be obvious even to the United
 States.
 Now we used to scoff at Soviet claims -- but again and again
 the so-called visions of Stalin have turned into realities; and
 today we scoff only at our own peril.
 Last November Khrushchev said to Walter Lippmann:   "We will
 cause you, the Americans, more trouble each year.   At present the
 United States is the richest and most productive country in the

 world.                    But it is living in the last years of its greatness.   Shortly
 the USSR will surpass the U. S. in productivity per capita.  When
 that is achieved, the people (of the poor countries) will be 'con-
 vinced in their stomachs'.  That is your danger, not our H-bombs."
 Late last year the official magazine of the Soviet Foreign
 Trade Ministry gloated that Soviet foreign trade had helped curb the
 profits of what it called the "super monopolies".  And a Soviet
 economist has recently declared that by 1965 the USSR will be calling
 the tune on world prices.
 Here is what Khrushchev told the Soviet Communist Party's
 twenty-first Congress this past January:
 "Think of this, comrades!  Although the socialist countries
 occupy only a fourth of the earth's territory, although the majority
 of these countries were backward in the recent past, the time is not
 distant when they will produce more than half of the world's indus-
 trial output!  .  . The countries of the socialist camp have all the
 prerequisites for winning the championship in world production.
 ... We want the competition to take place not in an arms race, not
 in the manufacture of atom and hydrogen bombs and rockets, but in
 the realm of industrial production -- meat, butter, milk, clothing,
 footwear and other consumer goods.  Let the peoples see which regime
 better meets their requirements and let them pay their due to each
 regime according to its deserts."
 Such trumpetings, as propaganda in today's world, are proving
 increasingly effective among the peoples of the so-called uncommitted
 countries whose populations total one billion human beings -- well
 over a third of the human race.   This is because of the comparisons
 that Soviet propaganda can now make between the rates of growth of

 our economy and theirs.  Since 1957 our own economy can almost be
 said to have been in retreat -- while the economy of the Communist
 world - Russia  and China in particular - is surging forward with
 giant steps.
 4,951               /NSFeP i /
 The USSR claims an economic growth th;W year of 10%.1 Here is
 the first of the four potent weapons in the Soviet economic and
 propaganda arsenal.
 Let's take steel production.  The Soviet goal for 1965, for
 the USSR alone., is 100 million tons and the Chinese goal seems to
 be expanding monthly.  Last year, for the first time, the Communist
 bloc, including the USSR, its East European satellites and China,
 produced more steel than did the United States.  Half our capacity -
 an amount equal to the USSR production - was idle.  Let me put this
 another way.  The American steel furnaces that were cold last year
 could have produced as much steel as all the furnaces in the Soviet
 Union.
 Allen Dulles, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, re-
 minded the U. S. Chamber last April that "a recession is an. expensive
 luxury."  "Its effects are not confined to our own shores," Mr.
 Dulles continued.  Then he warned, "Soviet propagandists have had a
 field day in recent months, pounding away at American free enter-
 prise."  This warning is minimized by many American economists who
 stress our historic rate of a 3% average annual economic growth.
 They do not throw into the balance the harmful impact of the Soviet
 propaganda dramatizing our setbacks and our millions of unemployed.
 Radio Moscow tells the peoples of Asia and Africa and Latin
 America;. "It took the West a hundred years to build its production
 system; follow ours and you can do it in twenty!"

 Perhaps I should interpolate here that the world unhappily is
 not filled with people who share your views and mine that, even if
 the Soviet Union were to learn to outproduce us 100 to 1, we would
 still most fervently prefer a system designed to serve the freedom,
 the dignity and the development of the individual.  We would still
 prefer our system to any system aimed at the glorification of the
 Party or the State.
 Let me now turn to another example of the Soviet challenge --
 their trade offensive.  This is their economic weapon Number Two.
 The USSR needs surpluses and raw materials which we often
 reject -- let us say the cotton of Egypt or the rice of Thailand and
 Burma.  When it doesn't need the rice, it can still acquire it and
 re-sell it at cut prices.  The non-Communist rice-exporting countries
 call this dumping.
 (In a dispatch from Chicago dated March 28, the
 New York Times quoted Mr. Charles B. Shuman,
 President of the American Farm Bureau Federation,
 as having "evidence that the Soviet Union was using
 cut price wheat -- including some that had originated
 on United States farms -- as an economic warfare
 weapon."  The Times said that Mr. Shuman "expressed
 the fear that the Soviet Union would replace the      ,--.
 United States in the Western European market.")
 The Russians can flood the market with their surplus tin.     In
 Bolivia, where tin is the vital life stream, there are riots.
 Against the Russians?  No.  Against us.   It is true that the most
 recent riot was touched off by a statement in Time Magazine.  But
 the underlying cause was the depressed market for tin.
 Soviet petroleum finds its way to Argentina and Uruguay.
 This tends to dry  up the markets for Venezuelan oil.   So does
 President Eisenhower's executive order establishing a quota on oil
 imports into the U. S.   This order pleased our oil producers in

 Oklahoma and Texas but it cut our purchases of Venezuelan oil by
 $250,000 a day.  Vice President Nixon heard about oil when he visited
 Caracas -- and with insults and brick-bats.  Will there be unemploy-
 ment in other oil producing countries?  The Russians won't hear
 much about it.   But we will.
 Soviet automobiles are appearing on the German market.  They
 are selling at low prices and they aren't being advertised.  The
 Soviets haven't yet learned the power of commercial advertising to
 help sell their goods in export markets.  They are beginning to use
 advertising domestically to dispose of surpluses or to stimulate
 savings, as I reported in Sales Management on my return from USSR
 three years ago.  And I now predict that the USSR will shortly begin
 to learn how to use export advertising.   This will add measureably to
 the formidability of Soviet competition in export markets.
 There are persistent Soviet bids for more trade with Britain.
 Three years ago Khrushchev, visiting England, spoke contemptuously
 of current Soviet-British trade as the exchange of Russian crabs
 for British herrings.  He offered to buy almost $3 billions of
 British goods if the embargo on strategic exports were removed.  And
 now Mikoyan roams the world markets, beating the drums for Soviet
 products, ready to buy or sell from either pocket, ready to undercut
 other countries' prices, and holding out the hope of Soviet loans at
 2% for 40 years.
 This last point dramatizes still another element of the
 Soviet economic offensive.   This is their economic weapon Number
 Three.    It is no less than the coming challenge to the dollar by
 the ruble.

 The London Economist recently reported that the head of a
 large Zurich bank had wagered the chairman of our Federal Reserve
 Board a case of champagne that the United States will devalue the
 dollar within three years.  And the house of Montagu, the big London
 bullion house, in the Bullion Review for 1958, tells us a few facts
 about Soviet gold production.   It was about 17 million ounces both in
 1957 and in 1958.   That's about $600,000,000 a year - on the same
 order as South African output.  Soviet gold reserves are estimated up
 to $10 billion.  Montagu makes some comments, too, on the possible
 devaluation of the dollar:   "One cannot exclude the possibility that
 a further decline in dollar holdings (and they mean dollar holdings
 by foreign countries) caused by the American Government's difficulties
 in handling its financial problems might well force the hands of the
 American authorities."
 There is no Marxist nonsense in Soviet banking operations.
 Russian bankers operate today much as they did under the czars.  They
 don't believe in capitalism, but they believe in capital and they
 handle it along capitalistic lines.   Our bankers will tell you that
 Soviet gold is a pleasure -- and a profit -- to handle.  It is always
 perfectly assayed.  And it is beautifully packaged, so that the banks
 always make just a little bit more when they handle Moscow gold than
 with any other country's gold.
 Soviet gold now trickles into the West at the rate of about
 seven million ounces a year.  This is roughly a quarter billion dollars.
 It isn't enough to disturb the delicate balance of the gold market.
 But what did Mr. Mikoyan urge last summer in an article in the
 Soviet magazine International Affairs?  He proposed nothing less than

 that the United States raise the price of gold.  This of course de-
 valuates the dollar.  He contended that the price of gold is "arti-
 ficially established" by the United States at a low rate which we
 impose on countries from which we buy gold - as a form of tribute
 collected by us.
 In the Soviet foreign trade journal, Vseshnyaya Torgovlya,
 Mr. Mikoyan stated that in the not too distant future the ruble,
 export of which has been forbidden for thirty years, will be made
 fully convertible on international exchanges.
 Both of these magazine articles by Mikoyan sustain reports that
 the Russians plan a revolution in international finance.  In the
 Soviet view, the ruble is to displace the dollar as the dominant
 medium of international exchange even in the non-communist world.
 Such a belief  would have seemed foolish - or merely a night-
 mare - a few years ago.  And today?  I'm not a financial expert -
 but I wonder.  Soviet industrial diamonds and gem diamonds soon will
 be competing with those of South Africa.  The international ruble
 will have gold and a growing flood of commodities as its backing.
 And in a death grapple between the ruble and the dollar, what will be
 the fate of the relatively free system of finance that has so long
 dominated the international world of money?
 Fourth and finally, we of the United States are now dangerously
 facing a Soviet challenge in the field of foreign aid.  During the
 next decade, this may turn out to be the most important of all the
 Soviet economic weapons.  Recently Under-secretary of State Dillon
 reported that Soviet commitments to underdeveloped and uncommitted
 nations for the year 1958 amounted to $1 billion.  Mr. Dillon said
 this represented "a dramatic acceleration of the tempo of the drive."

 By comparison with our own, the Soviet program of aid to under-
 developed countries has been small -- with a total commitment of only
 two and a half billions since the war, mostly in long-term low-interest
 credits.      Some experts believe the program will continue to be
 relatively modest.  But others estimate that within ten years the
 Soviet economy will be able to provide a surplus of ten billions
 annually for export -- if its leaders elect to do so.   If the tempo
 continues to accelerate, they may readily so elect.
 The Russians are playing for big stakes and they know what the
 stakes are.  They expect and they get political value for their money
 even when the money's small.  Their anti-Western line is quite clear.
 They tell the underdeveloped countries to expropriate Western property
 and to reject Western aid.   They promise help without the "enslaving"
 conditions we impose.   That we do not "enslave" is of no importance,
 so long as the Soviets are able to sell the idea that we intend to.
 In India recently, there was a dramatic demonstration of the
 effectiveness of the Soviet aid and propaganda program.   Two steel
 mills of one million ton capacity were opened on two successive days.
 The first had been built by a group of West German and Indian
 industralists.   Its opening passed relatively unnoticed.   The second
 was built and financed by the Soviet Union.   It opened amidst a fan-
 fare of publicity, a flood of propaganda that made it appear to India
 and surely much of the underdeveloped world that the Soviet Union was
 India's principal benefactor in her struggle toward self-sufficiency.
 Yes, perhaps the gravest threat to the Western world in the
 emerging Soviet economic challenge is the accelerating program of
 Soviet economic aid, and the skill with which it's handled.

 Now I've mentioned four forms of Soviet economic challenge.
 As a Cassandra, I could go on.  But I am not here to argue that the
 Russians are ten feet tall.  I'm merely arguing that when we Americans
 are in a life and death struggle we shall be well advised if we do
 not underestimate our competition.  I'm trying to dissolve any illusion
 that the United States is necessarily the Big Man and that the USSR
 is the Little Man and that a Good Big Man always beats a Good Little
 Man.
 Manifestly there are deep-seated flaws inherent in the Soviet
 system.  Further, there are cancerous economic flaws wholly apart
 from the purges, the tyranny and the political double-dealing.
 One is the unsolved problem of succession in a dictatorship --
 how, without terror and bloodshed, to transfer power from one regime
 to the next.  Stalin was in his forties when he became absolute ruler,
 but Khrushchev is already sixty-five.  This is Sears-Roebuck's newly
 advanced retiring age (it was 60 in 1942 when General Wood turned over
 the Britannica to the University of Chicago, and advised me to keep
 it at 60).
 Now I don't know the condition of Khrushchev's liver; he looks
 healthy enough in his pictures.  And it takes a man in good health to
 stand up against Hubert Humphrey for eight and one-half hours.  But
 I would wager that the jockeying is on among those who want to sit
 where he sits.  He may be temporarily succeeded, as was Stalin and
 before him Lenin, by an oligarchy of unquiet men scheming among them-
 selves for the ultimate power.                   Such a struggle might lead to another
 round of liberalization within the USSR.  This would be all to the
 good.   Or it might deflect Communist energies away from an interna-
 tional offensive.   Such a respite might of course be only temporary.

 There are factors and trends that could work in our favor.
 For forty years the people of the USSR have been hearing about the
 better life that is in store for them.  It is true that most Soviet
 citizens are today better off materially than their fathers were
 before the Revolution.  But all things are relative, and twice one
 egg per week is still only two eggs.  Their lot has been alleviated -
 but only to a degree that may whet their appetites for more.  We can
 wait with some hope for that "mellowing process" predicted by George
 Kennan.
 The astute politician Khrushchev today seldom makes a major
 speech without pointing to Soviet accomplishments in increasing the
 output of food and to a future with good housing, and enough meat,
 milk, and clothing for all.  Perhaps he feels that the Soviet people
 may never again be as supine as they were in the years when Stalin
 was operating on Lenin's dictum that it was necessary to sacrifice
 two entire generations in order to achieve the revolution.
 Illiteracy in the USSR has been largely wiped out for those
 under 45.  In my book of last year,  This is the Challenge, I again
 reported how the booming Soviet educational system - or rather its
 training system - is turning out tremendous crops of competent pro-
 fessional men and women, administrators and technicians - and thus
 creating a new version of a middle class.  Allen Dulles has expressed
 the "cautious hope" that education may prove the Achilles heel of the
 Soviet system.  The Kremlin may Indeed find it an increasingly harder
 problem to manipulate the people of the USSR.
 Alexis de Toquevil].e in his book, "The Old Regime," said:
 "The evils which are endured with patience so long as they are inev-
 itable seem intolerable as soon as a hope can be entertained of

 escaping them."  The Russian people found the evils of the Czars in-
 tolerable and ultimately escaped them; and no man can say for sure
 that this may not happen again even though there seems small hope at
 present for any significant or imminent change in the regime or its
 policies.
 There is a major factor which should not be minimized.   If I
 were purely a Cassandra, I would overlook it.  This factor is China.
 In a few years your banquet speakers will perhaps be focussing on a
 new problem which they will tell you is the gravest in all our history.
 They may tell you that in 1959 we Americans were fighting the wrong
 cold war -- and they may be right.  Peking claims that China's pro-
 duction of steel and grain doubled in 1958.  Twice one egg is still
 only two eggs, but it's a much bigger omelet when stirred by
 600,000,000 people.  To the Soviet Union or to the rest of us it is
 clear that Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-tai and Company are reorganizing
 China to achieve the last ounce of productivity.
 There is a wisecrack current in Moscow.  Khrushchev's Seven
 Year Plan, they say, is not aimed at catching up with the United
 States, but at keeping ahead of China.  The United Nations forecasts
 a Chinese population of 1,600,000,000 by the year Twenty-hundred.
 The Soviet population is now 207,000,000, less than a third of
 China's, and growing much more slowly.  The prospect of an explosive
 over-populated China immediately south of Russia's rich and under-
 populated Siberia must be cause for concern in Moscow.  Former
 Premier Paul Reynaud at a conference I attended in Bern last summer
 asserted that China's abandonment of birth control is one of the most
 significant political developments since the war.  The Soviets under-
 stand such developments.

 But I fear any effort to find a silver lining in China's grow-
 ing strength makes tonight's cloud the more ominous.
 Is a powerful China, seemingly more Communist than the Kremlin,
 likely to weaken the worldwide economic challenge of Communism? We
 may indeed some day find ourselves allied with the USSR against
 Communist China, but is this a comforting thought for the members of
 the Economic Club of Chicago to take home to their wives and
 daughters tonight?
 I hope that I may by now have persuaded many of you that the
 arguments are powerful that America's present necessity is to gear up
 for the coming economic competition.
 Now do I have any suggestions as to how best to gear ourselves
 up?
 Yes, I have a few, though I have advanced some of them so
 often that they may seem tarnished if not shopworn to some of you.
 However, this does not prove they are not good.  A secondhand set of
 Encyclopaedia Britannica is still better than the Book of Knowledge.
 (I say this as a bow to the many executives of Britannica and Brit-
 annica Films in the audience tonight.)
 Of course, the first and most essential task of the United
 States is to continue to maintain and further to build up our defense
 establishments; this is a subject for another speech, though not by
 me.   Perhaps I should remind you, however, that many who have
 studied the subject feel that our defense budgets should be stepped
 up at a rate of at least three billion a year.  A great political
 scientist, who spends his life studying world trends, told me last

 month that he thought the odds on a nuclear war had shifted in the
 last five years from 1 in 100 to 1 in 10.  He advises me to purchase
 three hide-aways (he prefers to call them lodges), at 10 or 12,000
 feet altitude, one in South America, the second in Southeast Asia
 and the third in Africa.   "Keep one member of your family out of the
 United States at all times," he warns.
 If he's right, three billion a year is far too little.  We
 must weigh his arguments.   Our understanding of reality is essential
 to our suvival in freedom.
 Our second objective for our economy, as I see it, is to
 produce at full capacity, or close to full capacity.  We must pursue
 policies which insure an expanding economy.  What we should produce,
 and how our total production should be divided among goods and ser-
 vices, is another question.  We have largely solved the technical
 problem of production; what we have not solved is the problem of
 maintaining an economy at full momentum and of channeling its produc-
 f9MdNG 09R/Owc
 tion               goods and services most vitally in the national
 interest.
 For the last several years, our growth rate has been con-
 siderably less than our traditional 3%.  Almost two years ago, in
 the third quarter of 1957, our gross national product reached its
 peak -- we were then producing at the annual rate of $451.1 billion
 dollars.   The recession came along and G.N.P. sagged.  A low annual
 rate of $429.2 came in the first quarter of 1958.  The average for
 the year ended up at $437.7.   (These figures are all in '58 prices.)
 Today it is creeping back up -- but with five or six million
 unemployed.   It is at least $20 billion behind what we might reason-
 ably expect with high employment.

 Now it takes no financial or mathematical genius to discover
 that if the current or recent rates of our own economy and the
 Soviets are maintained -- that they will shortly surpass us in gross
 national product -- and with a minimum of fin-tailed Cadillacs or
 plastic covers for the hats that cover the heads that cover our
 brains.
 Can we Americans afford to settle for a growth-rate of less
 than the 5% set as a goal in the 1958 report of the Rockefeller
 Brothers Fund?  This is no quota set by an optimistic sales manager.
 It is a rate of growth calculated by a panel of carefully chosen
 experts to accommodate sharply increased defense expenditures deemed
 essential; to cover increased and essential domestic expenditures
 in such fields as education; and to provide for a 2.8% per annum
 growth of private per capita consumption.  Thus it seems to promise
 that we can have our cake and eat it too.  If we.get the breaks,
 perhaps we can and perhaps such an example on our part will help
 lead the world to peace.  At any rate, we should seek to develop
 national policies directed toward such a goal.  This requires skilled
 and courageous
 /political leadership applied to national tax policies, budget and
 monetary policies.
 One distinguished economist estimates ke must double our cur-
 rent or historical rates of savings and investment to achieve the
 Rockefeller goal.  We must work more, but if we doryit will be easier
 to save more.

 of Congress was projected on the motion of the Committee chairman,

 .a44 d 54,,rsna4,1t,
 Chicagots own distinguished economist,ftSenator Paul Douglas.  This
 is planned as a ten-month $200,000 study of economic growth, employ-
 ment and inflation.  Few congressional probes could be more timely
 and important.  The first four preliminary witnesses who were heard
 late last month - Dean Neil Jacoby, who was active here at the
 University of Chicago for many years, Professor Sumner Slichter of
 Harvard, Leon Keyserling and Marriner Eccles - indicate the high
 level of economic competence being enlisted.
 A third front on which we must  fight is that of economic aid.
 Here again I turn to a recent but neglected report of the Rockefeller
 Brothers Fund.  This one is titled "Foreign Economic Policy in the
 20th Century."  It says, "The selective economic program of the
 Soviet Union is politically effective primarily to the extent that
 weak countries must face the strong Soviet economy alone.  If these
 countries are part of larger groupings they will be able to resist
 pressure more easily and negotiate on a more nearly equal basis.
 "The Soviet effort is impressive primarily because the free
 world has failed to develop a workable structure within which the
 industrialized and newly developing regions can cooperate in fulfill-
 ing the aspirations of their peoples."
 The report continues, "The free world can withstand the impact
 of the Soviet geo-political trade offensive, if it organizes itself
 to do so.  The more highly industrialized nations of the world are
 linked to the less developed nations by a two-way trade of goods that
 totals more than $35 billion annually or almost 30 times the amount
 of trade between the less-developed countries and the Communist bloc;

 "By building appropriate international institutions on the
 solid basis of existing mutual interest, the free world can perpetuate
 an advantage that lies overwhelmingly on its side."
 I endorse the conclusions of this report.  I believe the
 American people are again prepared to take what Clarence Randall of
 Chicago has called "the bold and costly measures to avert disaster
 in this contest."
 Annual increases in productivity can of course make it far
 easier for us to increase our foreign aid programs, and to put them
 on a long-term basis, not an uncertain annual basis, bolstered along
 the lines of Senator Monroney's "Development Loan Fund."
 Further, we should develop new ways to stimulate private~in-
 vestment abroad, particularly in under-developed countries.  I am
 tempted by Clarence Randall's proposal that the tax exemptions we
 now give to profits from investments in Latin America should be ex-
 tended to the entire world.   In his provocative article in the current
 Atlantic Monthly, he urges, "genuine partnerships and immediate and
 generous sharing with local capital of both the risks and the
 opportunities."
 I am not now prepared to join those who are suggesting that
 America must create a government monopoly of foreign trade in order
 to meet the Soviet challenge.  This can come; I am told it is being
 discussed in the State Department and "papers" are being prepared on
 it -- as indeed they should be.  But I am hopeful that we can avoid
 violating our anti-trust laws in ways that are repugnant to many of
 us in the business community and to a great majority of our voters.
 We are quick to accuse the Soviets of politically motivated
 foreign trade.  Yet many of their policies, like ours, may seem

 rational from the standpoint of their domestic economy.  Our trade
 too is governed by political considerations -- domestic ones affecting
 farm policies, for example -- or our oil quotas to which I've just
 referred - or our tariffs, as the Illinois and Connecticut Manufac-
 turers Associations can tell you.
 The United States should do all it reasonably can to reduce
 tariffs and trade barriers and thus stimulate world trade generally.
 In his testimony before Senator Douglas' Committee, Professor
 Slichter suggested that tariff reduction would hold down United
 States prices and thus counteract inflation.
 And should we exclude the Soviets from our trade?  Might not
 trade with them help encourage the trends we desire?  In his new
 book, Adlai Stevenson asks these questions:   "So why not trade with
 them?  Why not help them improve their living standards?  Why not
 encourage the growth of material abundance and thereby make it
 harder to preserve the secrecy, ignorance and tight controls of the
 Soviet system?  Why not help the Soviet leaders subvert their own
 system of fear with the confidence bred of plenty?"
 Finally, in my list of quick suggestions, I remind you that
 I have been identified, over the years, first in the Department of
 State and later in the Senate, with proposals for strengthening
 America's programs of international information and cultural exchange.
 These can have profound impact on the economic struggle.   They should
 be greatly enlarged.
 We must not neglect-the export of people and ideas as well as
 goods. Clarence Randall complains that our representatives can't
 speak "the language of the people with whom we must deal each day."

 I have previously proposed the creation of centers for the training
 of technical assistance experts - "West Points of Point /+," I called
 them, and I repeat the suggestion here.  The graduates of such
 centers would serve overseas for a few years as the graduates of our
 service academies serve in the armed services.   They would receive a
 most marvelous training for the business world we like to envisage
 for the future.
 A few fissures have opened in the Iron Curtain.  More can be
 developed with a little leadership and money, as I pointed out last
 year in testimony to the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate.
 One of our most hopeful lines of action is to make the Soviet people
 aware of how wide the discrepancy is between their own standard of
 living and that of the West.   The Soviet press so fears this issue
 that it failed to print Prime Minister'Macmillan's broadcast in
 Moscow about how well the British people live and how much higher
 British per capita production is than the USSR's.   I suggest that
 we         set up this issue as a pre-condition of the Summit meeting
 sought so eagerly by Khrushchev.  Let him agree to carry its pro-
 ceedings in the Soviet press and on its radio and TV.  Challenge him
 to expose his people to the great international debates of the times
 at the Summit meeting.   If he wants the Summit, let his people listen
 to what goes on there.
 I shall pass over tonight, as a subject for another speech,
 and this one I would like to make, the ignorance of our own people
 and the importance of informing them.   On March 18, James Reston
 reported dismay in Washington because in a spot check the
 New York Times discovered that 39% of those questioned did not know

 that Berlin is an enclave in Communist East Germany.  Such ignorance
 is a commentary on the American press, radio and TV - as much as on
 the American people.   Our press and radio may be free, but they are
 :far from adequate.
 Now you may say, as Iconclude, that measures I have ticked off
 quickly will cost a lot of money.   I reply that the money is tiny
 compared to our national Income, and our Defense Department costs.
 In view of our great danger and our urgent need, I for one am prepared
 to face up to higher taxes.  We are confronted with a new emergency
 no less real than war, and potentially equally menacing because if
 we do not meet it, war may not be far behind.
