 kind words about your meeting with Bruce Clarke and Dick Lehman.                  25X1
 I' have met with John Bross and Ed Hennelly and asked Bruce and the Senior
 Review Panel to provide whatever support and information is necessary for them
 to complete the assignment you gave them.  (U)
 of my personal staff is working closely with Roy Godson to 75X1
 are also providing all necessary clearances and support for Lionel Olmer.         25X1
 I am pleased that you found the final report of the Transition Team useful.
 We tried our best         ly supportive to them within legal, executive, and
 security bounds.                                                                25X1
 Concerning your list of additional items that would be useful to you, I
 have the following comments.:
 (1)  Enclosed is a- briefing paper listing-key intelligence issues
 which are likely to require attention in the first 90 days of the new
 Administration (Tab A).  This, of course, is a preliminary and brief list.
 The DCI. and I can talk to you about each in more depth.  In addition,
 we can arrange special briefings on any of the listed subjects before
 20 January. After 20 January, I suggest you schedule early in-depth
 briefings on each issue.'
 (2)  I am enclosing (Tab C) a few of the more valuable long-range
 planning papers that I mentioned to you.  They include foreign policy
 issue papers on The Third World, Our Traditional Allies, and China and
 Sino-Soviet Relations, and the key management problems of Communications

 SUBJECT      :  Critical Issues Likely to Face the New Administration
 During Its Initial Weeks

 Cottec do n Tad h i.ng Stab b dea2a with they a in mote detait.
 A.  In General:
 1.  Numerous critical international issues will almost certainly re-
 quire NSC or Presidential attention during the initial weeks of the new
 Administration.  Except as outlined below, however, most of them would
 arise whether or not there were a new Administration in Washington.
 2.  It is the unanimous judgment of the NIC, NFAC, and the Intel-
 ligence Community representatives that the USSR will not deliberately
 confront the new Administration -- at least during its earliest weeks --
 with some dramatic test or aggressive military move, although as noted
 below it may move for other reasons in Poland.  The past practice of the
 USSR at the outset of new US Administrations has been to preserve its own
 equities, to await US initiatives, and then to test the US at a later
 time -- depending on how the initial period has affected Soviet estimates
 of the new Administration.  Meanwhile, the Soviets will of course be
 "testing" the new Administration in numerous non-crisis ways.  Of par-
 ticular note in these respects will be Soviet efforts to seek to clarify
 US intentions with respect to arms control, European security, and the
 grain embargo; and US determination with respect to Iran-Iraq-Gulf
 questions.
 3.  More generally, the primary interest of the USSR and most other
 governments during January-March will be to assess the new Administration
 on issues of prime importance to them.  They will generally exercise care

 Approved For Release 2008/02/14: CIA-RDP85M00364R000500800002-2
 Jtl.Kt I
 not to foreclose options and opportunities -- at least until they have
 taken the measure of the new Administration and determined the degree to
 which its policies appear likely to accord with their particular interests.
 4.  Of the countless issues which will be pressing for NSC and Presi-
 dential attention, this memorandum concentrates on those likely to confront
 the Administration's policymakers from the outset or within a very few weeks.
 These specific issues are discussed below, in Paragraphs 6-21.  There are,
 of course, many other prime issues which are and will be on-going in their
 character and demands on decisionmaking.
 5.  Such problems -- insistent but not necessarily posing critical
 choices between January-March -- include the US' overall approach to:
 (a)  The USSR and arms control;
 (b)  The many cracks in US-Western European relation-
 ships, and the problems of strengthening NATO's cohesion
 and capabilities;
 (c)  Economic summitry, including the North-South mini-
 Summit to which Mexico and Canada will soon be inviting the
 US;
 (d)  The deteriorating stability and economic status of
 key LDC's;
 (e)  US military and economic problems with respect to
 Japan;
 (f)  China and its role in US strategic thinking and
 balancing;
 (g)  Nuclear proliferation; and,
 (h)  Arms transfers.
 B. Specific Critical Issues likely to arise which may demand
 NSC-Presidential decisionmaking, January-March.
 6.   The hostages in Iran.*  The behavior of the Iranians will continue
 to be a wild card.  The passions, pride, and domestic factionalism affecting
 the Iranians, added to the pressures and vicissitudes of the war with Iraq,
 and -- behind the braggadocio -- a great fear of extreme US action of some
 kind, will almost certainly continue to produce rapid twists and turns on
 the Iranian side.  Unless the hostage question has been settled by 20 January,

 SECRET
 the new US Administration could be faced by any of a spectrum of actions,
 ranging from sudden reasonableness to severe steps such as trying hostages
 for espionage or physically harming them.
 7.  The Iran-Iraq war.  A number of critical issues could suddenly
 arise from  his nnow-stalemated contest.  If the Iranians come to feel that
 they are up against the wall, they might strike out at non-Iraqi targets
 across the Gulf, attempt to mine portions of the Gulf, or take other des-
 perate actions which might enlarge or greatly complicate the war.  War
 weariness in Iraq may lead to the assassination of Saddam Hussein or to a
 coup against him.  Within Iran, such stability as exists could suddenly
 give way through assassinations or coup attempts, with consequent tempta-
 tion for the USSR rapidly to exploit the situation.*
 8.  The possibility of an oil crisis brought on by extreme Iranian
 action. Oil market prospects are highly uncertain because of the Iran-
 Iraq war.  The two countries recently have been exporting enough oil, given
 high stock levels, to keep the market fairly stable.  But key export facil-
 ities are extremely vulnerable to military action.  Iran with its back to
 the wall could stop all oil shipments out of the Persian Gulf.  If oil
 exports fall, or stocks are reduced to the point that panic buying begins,
 prices would easily reach $50 a barrel by spring.  In the extreme case,
 severe world-wide shortages would develop.
 9.  Poland.  While the Soviets have apparently been persuaded to give
 the Kania regime time to begin getting its house in order, the Poles are
 still living on borrowed time.  The Soviets remain militarily prepared to
 intervene on short notice -- and with little warning.  The internal situ-
 ation in Poland has not been at fever pitch for nearly a month and, in the
 absence of a serious provocation by Solidarity (and further concessions by
 Kania), we do not expect a Soviet military move into Poland.  The situation
 in the country remains very unstable, though, and any combination of events --
 food riots, new strikes, interference with lines of communication, further
 disintegration of party control or unity, etc. -- could trigger coercive
 measures and major crisis.  A formal Special National Intelligence Estimate
 on Poland is in preparation and should be out by late January.  In the
 meantime, definitive US intelligence on Soviet and Eastern European military
 moves will continue to be constrained by cloudy weather conditions.
 10.  Allied Responses re Poland.  Should Soviet/Warsaw Pact interven-
 tion in Poland occur, one of the chief challenges facing the US would be
 that of coordinating US actions with the responses of the Allies.  So far
 they have generally shared US views on the Polish question, but a Soviet
 invasion of Poland would almost certainly evoke wide differences of view
 among the Western Europeans on specific means of responding to the Soviet
 intervention, and in some instances perhaps strong disinclination to follow
 US leads.

 11.  Afghanistan.  The Soviets continue to face a prolonged and dif-
 ficult military operation in Afghanistan.  The level of insurgency appears
 to be on the increase again, and the Soviets may be hard pressed to main-
 tain their existing control over the major population centers and lines
 of communications.  While we do not expect a major Soviet troop increase
 in the next few months, pressures to alleviate the military situation are
 likely to intensify.  Renewed cross border strikes by Soviet or Afghan
 aircraft against guerrilla sanctuaries could occur, possibly leading to
 Pakistani appeals to the new Administration for material and/or political
 support.
 12.  The PRC's Deng Xiaoping will be seeking to clarify US intentions
 toward Beijing and Taipei.  And, because of the delicate and complicated
 realignments he is attempting to orchestrate at this moment within
 China, Deng will be extremely sensitive to developments in US policy toward
 China within the US such as, for example, US arms sales to Taiwan.
 13.  ROK President Chun Doo-hwan will continue to seek to determine
 whether the new US Administration is as concerned as was its predecessor
 over human rights issues in South Korea -- including the possible execution
 of opposition leader Kim Tae-chung -- and how this relates to Washington's
 concern for the ROK's security.  It cannot be excluded that Chun will
 nonetheless suddenly execute Kim, and confront the new US Administration
 with a question of response.
 14.  In El Salvador both the extreme left and the extreme right will
 almost certainly step up their efforts to depose the present center-right
 government and to increase their leverage by the time the new US Admini-
 stration takes office, if not sooner.  There is a good chance that the
 extreme left will receive sharply increased international support from Cuba
 and Nicaragua and will be in a much stronger position to challenge the
 military.
 15.  Horn of Africa/Ogaden.  The tide is beginning to turn more
 clearly there in Ethiopia's favor, and against Somali President Siad.
 His domestic position may weaken greatly because he has not been able to
 gain more forthcoming US assistance, and elements of the Somali officer
 corps may try to move against him.  Thus, the new US Administration
 might well be faced with a sudden threat to US military access rights in
 Somalia.
 16.  Libya under Qaddhafi remains a major international trouble-maker.
 Qaddhafi may follow his success in Chad with new initiatives against
 Tunisia, Sudan, or any of several West African states.  Of more immediate
 importance, a Libyan attack on a US reconnaissance aircraft over the
 Mediterranean might occur at any time.
 17.  Namibia.*  There is a good chance that the Geneva Conference
 on Namibia which convenes 7 January) may collapse, with a subsequent
 expansion of guerrilla war in Namibia, a possible African-backed call
 for UN sanctions against South Africa, and a further complicating of US
 policy options.

 18.  In Israel, a vote of no confidence against the government, or
 the sudden death of Prime Minister Begin (who is in poor health) could
 quickly lead to significant changes in the Israeli negotiating stance
 toward Camp David questions; possibly to new diplomatic initiatives by
 Israel, Egypt or (perhaps) the USSR; and to a need for the US.to shift
 diplomatic gears rapidly.
 19.  A major crisis could abruptly reappear among Israel, Syria, and
 Jordan occasioned by events in Lebanon, including that of dramatic Israel
 military action there.  Such a crisis could have serious implications for
 peace efforts re Israel-Syria, Syria-Jordan hostilities, US decision-
 making with respect to the Palestinian question, Syrian-Iraqi relations,
 or the possible further complicating of the Iran-Iraq war.
 20.  Major crisis could return in the Indochina area occasioned by
 sustained, large-scale Vietnamese strikes against Democratic Kampuchean
 sanctuaries in Thailand, undertaken in an effort to bring Kampuchea under
 more effective military control.  The significance for US decisionmaking
 would likely transcend Vietnamese-Thai hostilities:  the principal compli-
 cation would be Chinese re-invasion of Vietnam -- with accompanying
 great pressures on the Soviets to defend their interests in Vietnam.
 21.  Possible disruptive Cuban initiatives.  Castro's initial overall
 stance will probably be essentially defensive except in El Salvador.  But
 he might choose to undertake sudden initiatives such as close security ties
 to the USSR, greatly increasing Cuban assistance to the Sandinistas in
 Nicaragua, reviving the refugee exodus, or making threatening sounds
 with respect to Guantanamo.

 overt) is often subject to differing interpretations.  Imagery provides
 voluminous and relatively clear-cut evidence on military capabilities
 and some economic topics.  Communications intelligence may be either very
 hard or extremely ambiguous; it generally is more clear-cut on military
 and economic topics than political ones.  Overt sources normally can be
 trusted more on economic and biographic topics than political'and mili-
 tary ones, although that varies widely with the political makeup of the
 country in question.
 24.  Generally speaking, clandestine source data creates the most dif-
 ficult problems of interpretation.  Some is documentary and very solid.
 Much is ambiguous or contradictory, and almost all must be considered as
 possible disinformation.  The Community is seldom willing to accept clan-
 destinely acquired information on critical topics unless some confirmation
 is available from technical sources.
 25.  As a result, we continue to be strongest on military capabilities
 of major powers, good on many key economic questions, and least confident
 when trying to predict short-term decisions of political leaders, especially
 in closed societies.  We can provide good general warning of major develop-
 ments in the world and good detailed support to crisis management on most
 subjects in most places.  But there will doubtless continue to be occasions
 when intelligence cannot predict the timing of a new crisis.  We can usually
 warn that conditions are right in Country X for a coup, but predictions of
 a particular coup, assassination, or terrorist act in the unstable arena of
 world politics are largely a function of intelligence access to the secret
 deliberations of a small group of actors, which we often may not get.
 26.  Most of our collection and analytic problems are not susceptible
 to quick fixes.  They depend on additional resources, better cover, more
 intensive training, and developing solutions to technical problems.  These
 involve significant lead times.

 TRANSITION ISSUE PAPER
 SUBJECT         The CIA Executive Committee (EXCOM) and Other Internal Manage-
 ment Devices
 BACKGROUND:     During the early 1980s incoming DCIs and DDCIs soon realized
 that the Agency consisted of four isolated Directorates, some-
 times referred to as "individual fiefdoms."  As more and more
 policy and management issues began to transcend Directorate
 and functional boundaries, the need for a more collegial manage-
 ment approach was perceived.  The Management Committee, consisting
 of the line Deputies and eventually chaired by one of them, was
 an early attempt in this direction.  This was succeeded in 1976
 by the Executive Advisory Group (EAG) with an Executive charter
 to run the Agency on a day-to-day basis and a general charge
 from the new DCI to "bring CIA together."  The EAG made some
 headway in creating a constructive problem-solving environment
 for senior Agency managers although it was not used as a major
 policy decision tool nor did it manage daily business.
 In early 1979, the current DCI and DDCI decided to improve and
 revitalize the Agency's top policymaking/decision system.  EAG
 was transformed into the Agency Executive Committee (EXCOM),
 chaired by the DCI/DDCI, and charged not just as an advisory
 group but with decisionmaking powers on top Agency-wide policy
 issues.  Its objectives are to facilitate a shared understanding
 among top Agency executives of major policy issues and encourage
 Agency-wide solutions; assist the DCI and DDCI in establishing
 policies affecting the Agency's mission and functions and its
 relationship to the Intelligence Community and the rest of
 Government; act as the Agency's long-range planning mechanism
 for major, long-term interdirectorate activities; review proposals
 for new major Agency programs and significant changes to existing
 programs, provide guidance on priority clandestine collection
 projects, and periodically review progress.on actions it has
 initiated.
 CURRENT
 STATUS         Since 1979 the Executive Committee, meeting on the average of
 once a week (every Wednesday at 1500 hours) has become a vital,
 integral part of the Agency's management process.  Focusing on
 inter-directorate long-term issues, the Committee has reviewed

 more than two dozen difficult Agency-level issues resulting
 in DCI/DDCI decisions or guidance.  Examples include reforming
 the personnel management system, creating the Senior Intelli-
 gence Service, developing legislative strategy, developing an
 information handling strategy, reviewing and revising annual
 program and budget decisions, and initiating an Agency-wide,
 long-range planning process.  The Committee's success to date
 has been attributed to DCI/DDCI commitment to an action oriented
 forum to support their decisionmaking; a limited membership
 that encourages frank constructive decisions; thorough staff
 work in advance of meetings to provide an effective basis for
 discussions; and careful selection of topics to avoid those
 which can be treated in other forums.
 The Committee is supported by a small staff (three people)
 that prepares agendas and minutes; drafts terms of reference
 and assists Agency components responsible for developing.
 policy papers, long-range plans, and other proposals for the
 Committee; tracks progress on Committee actions; and analyzes
 issues and reviews proposals as assigned by the Chairman.  The
 majority of the issue and decision papers are prepared either
 by the responsible lead office or by ad hoc interdirectorate
 teams. The DDCI ordinarily chairs EXCOM although the DCI fre-
 quently attends on key issues up for decision.  The DDCI uses
 his Special Assistant to directly supervise EXCOM Staff and
 oversee management of EXCOM business.
 CURRENT
 ISSUE         Immediate DCI-designate concern will be whether he wants to
 continue the EXCOM decision system and how he wants to manage
 the three-person EXCOM Staff.
 OTHER INTERNAL
 MANAGEMENT
 DEVICES

 tools to help manage the Agency:

 Serves both to keep the DDCI updated on major on-going
 directorate activities and to provide guidance to the next
 two levels below the DCI/DDCI.  Process consists of DDCI
 quarterly guidance and brief one- or two-page issue papers
 including status, problems, and milestones prepared by
 directorates.  Process is managed out of the DDCI office
 by the DDCI's Special Assistant.
 Senior Intelligence Service Advance Work Plans.  Starting
 in the fall of 1979, the DCI/DDCI for the first time in this
 Agency's history, prepared SIS AWPs consisting of a statement
 of.key objectives for the four directorate heads, the heads
 of RMS and CTS and the key DCI/DDCI Special Assistants.  These
 objectives were then reviewed periodically in a number of ways.
 The DDCI reviewed directorate quarterly objectives in the
 goals process mentioned above, the seven independent office
 heads prepared quarterly progress reports which were reviewed
 and commented on by the DCI/DDCI.  At mid-year, the DCI/DDCI
 met privately with each of the deputy directors to review
 progress towards their AWPs, and, at the end of the third
 quarter, the deputy directors were asked to write a three-
 quarter report of progress for the DCI/DDCI.
