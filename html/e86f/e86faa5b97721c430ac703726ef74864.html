Chinese leadership, according to Dr. Richard 
C. Thornton, consultant to the State Depart-
ment on Asian affairs. He offered this analysis 
of the situation in an interview with United 
Press International: 
? The current border clashes are Soviet 
"probes" aimed at pressuring China and open-
ing the way for establishment of new, inde-
pendent border republics in China. Dr. Thorn-
ton predicted one to three of these republics, 
perhaps in Manchuria, Inner Mongolia and 
Sinkiang, and all controlled by Soviet Puppets, 
will be established within the next six months. 
? As a result, the Soviets have to be pre-
pared to race the threat of a retaliatory attack - 
from Chinese nuclear-tipped missiles which: 
are in the final stages of development. The 
threat, therefore, that the Soviets might try to 
knock out the Chinese nuclear missile installa-
tions before the Chinese could strike is a real 
one. 
? ? The Soviets would not want all-out war - 
with China and so would hope the puppet bor?

tack, if they decided to risk it, would fragment - 
Chinese leadership. The result could be a civil 
war, or perhaps the emergence of pro-Soviet 
forces erased from power during Mao Tim- a 
Tung's proletarian cultural revolution.01).

Reportedly Considers 
Attack On Peking's 
Atom Facilities 
By PAUL W. WARD 
(Waehington Bureau of The Sunr 
Washington, Aug. 27?Reports 
indicating that the Brezhnev-Ko- t 
sygin regime at Moscow is con-
sidering trying to bomb Com-
munist China's atomic installa-
tions out of existence are begin-
ning to be taken seriously in the 
International community of dip-
lomats here. 
Chief among them are intelli-
gence reports that Soviet Com-
munist party leaders have been 
taking soundings on the subject 
among their oppoSite numbers in 
both Eastern and Western Eu-
rope. 
I Contributing also to the sober 
I turn in the speculation here are 
'intelligence reports to the effect 
Ithat the Soviet Union has dou-
r", , bled its forces along its China 
border; that ?they now total 
about 30 divisions (nearly 500,000 
men) as against 15 divisions four 
years ago, and that they include 
mobile missile launchers. 
State Depai tment officials, cit-
ing conflicts in the reports about 
Soviet soundings of other Com-
munist parties, continue to pro-
fess about them a skepticism 
which also colored a statement 
William P. Rogers, Secretary of 
State, made a week ago. 
Addressing a group of students 
? winding up their summer em-
ployment as "executive in-
terns," Mr. Rogers was asked: 
"What do you people feel the 
chances are that the Soviet UnN 
'ion will use a nuclear strike 
against China." ? 
"I think the best judgment is 
?that probably it will not do so," 
Mr. Rogers answered. 
He added, "The Russians 
would be faced with a very seri-
ous problem because, although if 
they made a strike against Com-
munist China they could take 
over a good segment of that 
area up near Peking?they prob-
ably could even take over Pe.,, 
gr)ius_ ?then _tbey ,w9411 
'? "That would be a very diffi-
cult thing for them to handle, 
and I think they are quite aware 
of that, even though they have 
moved military, equipment up to? 
ward the Chinese border." 
'Mr. Rogers went on to volun-
eer a commentary on the possi-
bilities of Peking initiating a 
Sino-Soviet war. ? ? 
"The Chinese Communists, 
'think, realize that they are not 
really able militarily to cope 
with the Soviet Union; so we 
rather doubt that they would ini-
tiate a major, attack," Mr. Rog-
ers said: . ? 
"Very Permanent" 
Then, referring to the more 
than 430 Sino-Soviet border 
clashes that Peking claims have 
occurred this year and blames 
on Moscow, including the latest 
one on August 13, Mr. Rogers 
added: 
"Our best judgment is that the 
border Clashes and incidents 
probably will continue to recur. 
We are convinced the hostility 
between the two' is very deep 
and very permanent. We are 
quite conscious, though, of the 
fact that these border incidents 
always can flare?up into some-
thing neither side really intends, 
and I must say our position is a 
government is that we hope that 
doesn't happen." 
"There are some people," he 
continued," who argue, 'Well, it 
would be a good thing for the 
United States to let the Soviet 
Union and Communist China en-
gage in a fairly sizable war. We 
don't think so. We think warfare 
anywhere is harmful to the total 
'world community, :and we think

'WASHINGTON CLOSE-UP 
Is Laird riefin Us Too Much? 
By ORR KELLY 
Ever since he moved into 
;the Pentagon last Janurary, 
Defense Secretary Melvin R. 
Laird has been pouring out an 
almost steady stream of pre-
i viously secret information 
' about the Soviet Union. 
He has talked about the 559 
? missile, tests in the Pacific of 
some form of multiple war-
head for the 559, the rate at , 
which the Russians are de-
? playing intercontinental mis-
' 
silos and the rate at which 
they are building submarines. 
In the process, he has been 
accused for saying too much, 
of saying too little and of dis-
torting the intelligence esti-
mates of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency to bolster his 
case for a missile defense sys-
tem. 
. How much validity is there 
to these criticisms? 
? Of the three, the least likely 
? to be valid is the criticism that? 
? Laird's appraisal of Soviet 
capabilities in the future dif-
fers from the official National 
; Intelligence Estimate, because 
the procedure by which the 
NIE is arrived at specifically 
. provides for dissenting views, 
which become part of the esti-
mate. 
As part of his job as the 
principal foreign intelligence 
adviser to the President, Rich-
ard Helms, the director of cen-
tral intelligence, is responsible 
;for preparation of the NIE. 
The process starts with the 
President or a request from 
the National Security Council 
for an estimate on some prob-
lem of foreign intelligence. 
The request goes to the Board 
of National Estimates, which 
reports directly to Helms as 
director of central intelli-
gence. 
The members of the 12-man 
board or their staff get togeth-
er with representatives of the 
Defense and State Depart-
ments and other agencies that 
might be involved and divide 
up the work. When the drafts 
come back from the various 
? agencies, a member of the 
board's staff puts them to-
gether in preparation for a se-
ries of meetings by the board. 
When they have finished 
their work, Helms takes the 
report to the U.S. Intelligence 
Board, of which he is chair-
man. The board includes rep-
resentatives of the CIA, De-
fense Intelligence Agency, Na-
tional Security Agency, the 
State Department's Office of 
Intelligence Research, t h e 
Atomic Energy Commission 
and the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation. 
"One of the beauties of the 
system is that there is a com-
plete sharing of all informa-
tion among the agencies, so, 
that everybody, is working 
from the same set of facts,". 
Lyman B. Kirkpatrick Jr., for-
mer executive director of the 
CIA, wrote in his book on 
"The Real CIA." 
Planning for military pur-
poses normally goes beyond 
the NIE to what is known as 
the "greater-than-expected-
threat." In other words, 
plans are normally made for 
the worst that might happen 
rather than for what appears 
likely to happen?even if 
the Pentagon agrees with the 
NIE. Because of the long 
time it takes to develop and 
produce new weapons, mili-
tary planning also normally 
reaches out beyond the time 
in which the NIE has any, real 
certainty. 
The criticism that Laird 
is saying both too much and 
too little has more basis in 
fact. 
So far as the intelligence 
community is concerned, it 
would be happy if no one ever 
said anything about what has 
been learned about ,he activi-
ties of other countries, friend 
or. foe. 
Part of the problem is that 
any revelation of what we 
"`` ? ? ? ? I " ? ? 
know?or think we know?lets 
a potential enemy know how 
much we know and how accu-
rate our information is. 
An even more serious part 
of the problem is that any rev-
elation could expose the 
sources of information. This is 
the area in which intelligence 
officials are most touchy be- , 
cause it can endanger the I 
effectiveness and even the , 
lives of intelligence agents. 
On the other hand, Laird 
may well be telling us less 
than we need to know for a 
fully objective look at the' 
threat posed by the Soviet Un-
ion. 
He has ,said, for example,: 
that the Russians are testing a,' 
multiple warhead on the SW. 
and that the warheads seem to ? 
fall in a pattern corresponding 
to the way our Minuteman 
missiles are deployed. This in-
formation comes from a de-?.; 
stroyer waiting out in the Pa- , 
cific near the impact area. .; 
But what if he has additional 
information?as he aim os t., 
surely does?that comes from.: 
sources less obvious than a.. 
destroyer. Is he free to make .1 
that public, too, without seri- 1 
ously endangering sources of 
? information? Probably not. 
This is a problem that has 
been with us for a long time 
and one that we can never 
wholly avoid. " 
People in the government at 
the policy-making level are 
going to try to use as much 
information as they can to 
prove the wisdom of what they 
have decided to do?as the ad-
ministration is now doing in 
the case of the Safeguard mis-
silo defense system. 
But no one?and especially 
none of the critics of what the 
administration has set out to 
do?can ever be satisfied that 
the information being made 
public is, if not the whole 
truth, at least a close approxi-" 
mation of the,truth.,: '

with a range of 6000 miles 
that could give the country 
second-strike nuclear capa-
bility in the 1970s, The Lon-
don Sunday Times said in 
an article yesterday. 
The article was written by 
Francis James, an Austra-

China's Lop Nor nuclear 
testing site earlier this year 
and took pictures of missile 
and nuclear bomb plants. 
James, who specializes in 
religious journalism, said he 
interviewed Wei San-fu, a 
top Chinese nuclear scien-
tist, who said China had 
? 
made seven nuclear tests, 
beginning with a bomb 
using enriched uranium 
built with Russian help in 
1904, and ending with an IT-
bomb on Christmas Eve, 
1967, entirely Chinese-made 
of lithium 6.
