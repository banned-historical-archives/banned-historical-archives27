CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN 
20 December 1958 
DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Communist China: The Burmese ambassador in Peiping 
has reported that Foreign Minister Chen Yi, in briefing for-
eign diplomats on Mao Tse-tung's resignation, denied that the 
failure to attack Chinmen was a factor in Mao's decision. He 
stated that "the policy of the Chinese government ia either to 
liberate Taiwan as a whole, that is, for the United States to 
get out, or to sustain the present situation" by meeting tension 
with tension. Chen Yi added that Defense Secretary Peng Te-
huai may decide "to deluge Chinmen with another barrage" in 
order to demonstrate that Peiping has not been defeated. 
(Page 1) 
The Indian ambassador in Peiping, who was struck by 
Chen Yi's "defensive tone;' has heard "rumblings of dissatis-
faction with Mao." He had also heard rumors that Premier 
Chou En-lai has been criticized and that he may follow Mao 
in resigning his government position. While there has un-
doubtedly been some criticism of both leaders in the past two 
years' it is unlikely that this criticism could have brought 
about Mao's decision or would impel any similar decision by 
Chou. (Page 3) 
Communist China - Middle East: Peiping apparently will 
join the USSR, Czechoslovakia, and Poland in providing arms 
to the Middle East. China offered arms to Egypt at the time 
of the Suez affair in 1956, and last April Cairo sent an arms 
mission to China. The UAR representative in Peiping is now 
discussing the possibility of purchasing heavy guns and per-
haps other weapons from Peiping. Egypt has been under pres-
sure from Peiping to purchase more Chinese goods to balance

its trade with China, which has been paying hard currency for 
Egyptian cotton. China probably also sees arms deals as an 
effective means for expanding its influence in Middle Eastern 
and Asian countries. It is interested in providing weapons and 
financial assistance to the Algerian rebels with Egypt acting as 
intermediary. (Page 5) 
IL ASIA-AFRICA 
Lebanon: Political tension is increasing again. The Pop-
jular Mil:gal-ice, a pro-UAR organization, has warned the 
/0 Lgovernment that it will set up armed camps "all over the coun-
try" unless training camps of the anti-UAR Syrian Socialist 
National party are eliminated. Page 7) 
UAR: UAR propaganda against local Communist influence 
in the Arab states appears to be taking on larger proportions. 
The Damascus press and radio have warned against a "new" 
kind of danger to Arab nationalism from a "worse enemy of 
democracy and freedom" than the "imperialists." 
(Page 8) 
Philippines: President Garcia's popularity has declined 
with the continued failure of his administration to deal with the 
worsening economic situation. Garcia reportedly plans to con-
solidate political control over the armed forces by replacing 
Defense Secretary Vargas in a major cabinet shake-up at the 
beginning of the new year. The administration may hope to 
bolster its declining prestige by an increasingly uncompromis-
ing attitude in the present exploratory talks on American bases. 
(Page 9) 
Indonesia: There are additional suggestions that Pres-
ident Sukarno and Premier Djuanda intend to reduce Nasution's 
excessive influence in government affairs. Sukarno has al-
ready diluted Nasution's authority over the important regional 
barter trade and he is said to have told Nasution and other top 
military leaders to concentrate on security and "to leave civil-
ian affairs to the civil governments." (Page 11)

III. THE WEST 
Italy: The current visit to Peiping of Enricp Mattei, the 
politically powerful head of Italy's oil and gas monopoly, fur-
ther underscores Rome's intention to expand economic rela-
tions with the Sino-Soviet bloc as well as with the Middle East 
and other areas. Mattei, who apparently has government ap-
proval for his Peiping trade talks; had made a Atopover in 
Moscow to participate in Italo-Soviet trade-agreement talks 
and had recently announced conclusion of a contract to purchase 
800,000 tons of Russian crude petroleum. 
(Page 12) 
Cyprus: Following the recent private discussions between 
he Greek and Turkish foreign ministers; diplomatic efforts 
behind the scenes are continuing in search of a compromise so-
ution to the Cyprus dispute. Meanwhile; tension on the island 
has eased somewhat as a result of the eleventh-hour commu-
ation of death sentences for two condemned Greek Cypriots 
and the governor's "Christmas gesture" in releasing sixty po-
itical detainees.

L THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Peiping's Foreign Minister Comments on Taiwan 
Strait Situation 
Communist China's Foreign Minister Chen Yi denied to 
a group of foreign diplomats in Peiping on 16 December that 
the Communists' failure to attack Chinmen had been a factor 
in Mao Tse-tung's decision to relinquish his government post, 
Chen claimed 
that it would be "easy" to take over Chinmen through nego-
tiations with the US at Warsaw but that Peiping has not done 
so because the price would have been acceptance of the "two 
Chinas" concept. He termed the presence of Nationalist 
troops on Chinmen and American forces on Taiwan as "very 
good" since it focused world attention on "aggression" there. 
Obviously sensitive to the non-Communist press, Chen 
stated that the Communists "control the situation," and claimed 
that they hold the initiative to shell "when they feel like doing 
so"--a clear sign of "victory, not defeat." He also stated that 
tension would be met with tension "for a long time" and that 
Defense Minister Peng Te-huai "may" give another order "to 
deluge Chinmen with another barrage" in order to offset claims 
that the Communists have suffered a defeat. 
Recent increases in the intensity of Communist artillery 
fire on the Chinmens may have been in response to such impli-
cations of a defeat, On 9 and 11 December� the Communists 
fired more than 4,000 rounds on the Cliinme4,,a substantial 
increase over the usual number of shells fired in one day. 
The Communists have also improved their over-all mil-
itary posture in the strait area. They have particularly con-
centrated in improving their air combat capability by extensive

Reported Criticism of Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai  
The Indian ambassador in Peiping is 
to have been impressed by Chen Yi's "defensive" attitude in 
his 16 December briefing. Chen denied that Mao's decision 
was impelled by the failure of any of Mao's policies, or by 
any kind of dissatisfaction with Mao on the part of other par-
ty leaders. Chen noted that Mao had mentioned to several 
visitors his interest in resigning, and that Khrushchev had 
approved. 
The ambassador is reported to have heard "rumblings 
of dissatisfaction" with Mao. He also cited a rumor that 
Chou En-lai might resign as premier, on the ground that he 
had been criticized in some party quarters as a "rightist" 
and for being shielded by Mao. The ambassador forecast 
that Liu Shao-chi would succeed Mao as government chair-
man. 
Although Chen Yi's briefing, like the central committee 
communiqu�he following day, was defensive in tone, his ac-
count of Mao's personal position seems essentially accurate. 
Mao was almost certainly subjected to criticism in 1957, 
following the failure of certain of his personal policies, and 
there has presumably been some criticism of his recentpol-
idles. However, Mao took the lead in correcting his mistakes, 
and his prestige has seemed largely restored by successes to 
date in the "leap forward" campaign and the communes pro-
gram. 
Moreover, those party leaders who might conceivably be 
able to dislodge Mao if they acted together�Liu Shao-chi,Teng 
Hsiao-ping�,andother directors of the party machine--have 
helped Mao to correct his earlier mistakes and have been em-
phatically associated with Mao's recent policies. Mao has

several times since mid-1957 said he would like to reduce 
his burden; he has done so in giving up the tiring ceremoni-
al post of government chairman. He presumably told Ithru-
shchev of his decision during the latter's visit last July. 
Chou En-lai too was open to criticism in 1957, as he 
was more closely associated than were other party leaders 
with those of Mao's policies which failed. However, he has 
also been associated with Mao's more successful recent pol-
Ides. Chou would probably be most reluctant to resign as 
premier; the key government post and the principal source 
of his prestige and power in the party. If he did so, it would 
probably be on grounds of failing health. His health has been 
In question for more than two years, and illness may have 
forced him to cancel the trip to Egypt scheduled for last month. 
The leading candidate for Mao's government chairman-. 
ship is Chu .Te, a comparatively unimportant but esteemed 
party senior. However, there seems an outside chance that 
Liu Shao-chi will bid for the job, in the interest of adding 
the prestige of that post to his real power as the second-rank-
ing leader--behind Mao--in the key central organs of the par-
ty.

"4.01 
Chinese Communist - Middle East Arms Deal  
Communist China, like the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, 
and Poland, apparently will provide arms to the Middle East-
ern countries. The UAR ambassador in Peiping, 
 dis-
cussion of a draft agreement was to begin on 18 December, and 
he asked to be informed of what weapons the UAR desired. He 
also said that UAR officials in Peiping recently witnessed a 
"practical demonstration" of 122-mm and 152-mm0 self-pro-
pelled guns. 
Peiping first expressed a willingness to supply arms to 
Egypt in the spring of 1956,prior to Egypt's decision to recog-
nize Communist China, when President Nasir solicited arms 
aid from the Chinese. Cairo's motivation at that time was to 
secure an additional source of arms in the event the USSR and 
its satellites would abide by a possible UN resolution to place 
a general ban on arms shipments to the Middle East. In Decem-
ber of 1956, following the Israeli-Egyptian war and Cairo's rec-
ognition of Peiping, the Chinese Communist defense minister af-
firmed Peiping's readiness to supply Egypt with "all possible aid" 
and equipment. Early in 1957, Cairo asked its embassy in Pei-
ping to obtain "further details" on the performance and price of 
certain Chinese-produced weapons. 
A UAR military mission visited Communist China in April 
1958, and Premier Chou En-lai then encouraged them to inspect 
Chinese armament factories and military installations. Egypt 
recently has been under pressure from Peiping to purchase more 
Chinese goods to balance its trade with China, which has been 
paying hard currency for Egyptian cotton. 
It is not known whether the assault guns referred to by the 
UAR ambassador in his report to Cairo are of Chinese Commu-
nist or Soviet origin. There are at present, however, at least 
six Chinese plants involved in the production of armored fighting

T-54 medium tank. Communist China also produces artillery 
up through the 152-mm. gun-howitzer, which, along with the 
122-mm. gun, is the type of armament used on the SU-152  
and the SU-122 respectively. 
 early in December, Chinese 
Premier Chou En-lai and the UAR ambassador discussed arms 
aid and financial assistance for the Algerian rebels. Chou En-
lai specified that Cairo would have to act as intermediary for 
any Chinese Communist arms aid to Algeria. An Algerian 
mission, including the rebels' minister of armaments and sup-
ply, has been in Communist China and would probably be re-
ceptive to an attractive arms offer. Furthermore, Cairo has 
acted in the vast as middleman in Czech arms aid to the Algerian 
rebels.

II. ASIA-AFRICA 
Lebanese Political Tension Increasing  
Political tension in Lebanon is increasing following the 
Lebanese Army's punitive measures against the pro-UAR 
Sunni Moslem village of Arsal last week end. Since anti-
UAR Social National Party (SNP) paramilitary units were 
involved in repulsing Arsali attackers, the pro-UAR Popu-
lar Resistance has issued an ultimatum to the government 
demanding the abolition of all SNP paramilitary training 
camps throughout Lebanon. Otherwise, the Popular Resist-
ance declares it will set up camps of its own and wipe out 
the SNP camps. 
Ambassador McClintock believes that Prime Minister 
Karami may attempt to shift the blame for the incident on the 
SNP. Since the SNP supported the Chamoun government dur-
ing last summer's rebellion, Karami has an added incentive 
for destroying SNP power. 
Karami may decree the deportation of all foreign mem-
bers of the SNP, most of whom are refugees from Syria. 
Syrian authorities for some Wile have been pressing Lebanon 
to turn Syrian members of the SNP over to UAR security 
authorities. However, it is believed that President Shihab 
and Interior Minister Edde would resist such a move to in-
terfere with Lebanon's role as a haven for political refugees.

Nasir's Campaign Against Communist Activities  
Nasir has taken another step in the UAR propaganda 
campaign against Communist activity in the Arab states. 
He may at the same time be moving to reduce his eco-
nomic dependence on the USSR, 
There has been unprecedentedly sharp Criticism of Com-
munism in the UAR-controlled press and radio in Damascus. 
Damascus radio has warned of dangers in a drift to the left, 
which it called a worse enemy of democracy and freedom than 
the "traditional enemy"--imperialism. Damascus newspapers, 
referring again to the new kind of danger, claim some "factions" 
--Communists--are exploiting the revolution in an effort to es-
trange Iraq from the Arab "caravan." Previously UAR-subsi-
dized newspapers in Beirut and at least two Cairo newspapers 
had taken the same line. 
These propaganda moves follow closely Nasir's request for 
PL-480 wheat from the United States and the signing of a con-
tract with an American oil company to supply a large part of 
the UAR's crude oil imports, 75 percent of which were from: 
the USSR this year. In addition, within the past few days Cairo 
has announced progress in settling economic differences with 
French and Anglo-Egyptian oil companies. There is also an 
indication that through unofficial contacts Nasir is attempting 
to convey the impression to the  US that he is adopting a stiffer 
line in dealing with the USSR.

Philippine Domestic Outlook  
Signs of serious popular disaffection with Philippine 
President Garcia have become apparent as a result of his 
administration's failure to stem economic deterioration and 
administrative corruption. During his recent goodwill trip 
to Japan, there was much criticism that his party was being 
"taken in" by lavish treatment, and an effort to stage a tri-
umphant demonstration on his return to Manila was greatly 
overshadowed by the popular reception given four days later 
to Nacionalista party head and Senate President Rodriguez 
following his visit to Europe and the United States. More re-
cently, Garcia was booed by spectators at a large sports event 
in Manila. 
Despite an improvement in the production of key crops, 
the Garcia administration still is in serious financial straits. 
The budget commissioner recently told a congressional hear-
ing that the country was on the verge of bankruptcy; he has 
met little success in trying to curtail government expenditures 
or to increase revenues, Exchange reserves declined to a new 
low in November before showing some slight rise from seasonal 
sugar exports in December. 
Plans to replace armed forces leaders with persons loyal 
to Garcia are proceeding. Garcia is said to have decided upon 
a successor to Defense Secretary Vargas, who will probably be 
removed in a broader cabinet reshuffle early in 1959. The sched-
uled retirement of Chief of Staff Arellano on 31 December will 
pave the way for further changes in the army and constabulary 
commands. 
The Philippine Government has hardened its demands for 
greater American military aid and for revision of the agreement 
on American bases. A concerted press campaign on behalf of

Moves to Curb Indonesian Army's Role in Government  
Further reports on the recent Indonesian cabinet meeting 
with President Sukarno and on the subsequent conference of mil-
itary administrators provide additional evidence that President 
Sukarno is seeking to reduce army influence in government af-
fairs.  Sukarno and the cabinet de-
cided to transfer authority over regional barter trade from 
army chief Nasution to the cabinet itself. 
The cabinet reportedly agreed on the need to extend martial 
law. Parliament approved the extension on 13 December after 
Premier Djuancla assured the members that martial law might 
be lifted in some areas after six months and that military abuses 
would not be tolerated. 
President Sukarno is said to have cautioned the Bandung 
conference of military "war administrators" chaired by Nasu-
tion to concentrate on security matters and "leave civilian af-
fairs to the civil government." 
Sukarno's advice was a concession to Djuanda, who 
had told the cabinet meeting he would resign as premier unless 
restrictive measures were taken against military interference. 
Nasution reportedly instructed military commanders to 
proceed with administrative programs under martial law and 
to establish local military-labor cooperation organizations, 
for which he plans to call a national conference sometime in 
January. These groups are intended to counter growing Com-
munist influence in the labor movement.

III. THE WEST 
Italian Oil Czar Seeking Trade Deal With Communist China 
Enrico Mattei, the politically powerful president of the 
Italian state petroleum and gas agency,ENI� is in Peiping for 
talks with Chinese foreign trade officials. According to the 
press, he intends to sell chemical fertilizer from the petro-
chemical plant at Ravenna. However, he brought with him 
officials from ENI's subsidiaries engaged in the manufacture 
of oil rigs and pipelines. Mattel., who apparently has Pre-
mier and Foreign Minister Amintore Fanfani's approval for 
this trip, had made a stopover in Moscow where he report-
edly participated in Italo-Soviet trade-agreements talks. 
Mattel had recently announced the conclusion of two con-
tracts with the USSR--one for the purchase next year of 800,-
000 tons of Russian crude petroleum for EM'S refineries, the 
other for the sale in 1959 of 8,000 tons of synthetic rubber 
from ENI's Ravenna plant. 
EM contracted for the crude because it was quoted a price 
lower than the standard offering. 
The Peiping trip and deal with Moscow are indicative of 
Mattei's and Fanfani's desire to develop closer economic rela-
tions with the Sino-Soviet bloc in addition to Italy's expanding 
contacts in the Middle East. There is some doubt, however: 
whether commodities offered by the Chinese for export will 
really interest the Italians. Peiping may press at this time 
for the exchange of permanent trade delegations between the 
two countries.

Cyprus 
A new conciliatory attitude has been noted in both Athens 
and Ankara since the close of the UN General Assembly debate 
on Cyprus in early December. 
Recent conversations among the Greek, Turkish, and Brit-
ish Foreign Ministers at the NATO meetings in Paris may indi-
cate new moves to settle the Cyprus dispute are in the offing. A 
conference of the three powers�possibly under NATO aegis 
and with such observers as the United States present--was prob-
ably discussed. A stumbling block to such talks remains, how-
ever, in Athens' insistence on only a final--not an interim--
solution for the island. In London, Prime Minister Macmillan 
has apparently gone as far as he can to pacify critics in the 
Labor party and to reassure Athens, without simultaneously 
alienating the Turks, by declaring partition to be the "worst pos-
sible solution" but one that might be adopted if no other were 
found. 
On Cyprus, the good will accruing to the British as a re-
sult of the "last minute" commutation of the death sentences 
of two Greek Cypriots on 18 December was largely expended the 
following day when British troops fired on rioting Greek Cypriot 
women. EOKA continues to maintain a relative truce with only 
occasional acts of arson, primarily directed at British automo-
biles. However, forthcoming moves by Britain in implementa-
tion of its interim "partnership" plan for Cyprus, including 
publication of a commission report recommending that the Turks 
be granted their own municipal council in five major cities, 
will probably spark a serious outbreak of violence. 
There is a possibility of attacks against Americans on Cyprus. 
A recent EOKA leaflet violently denounced "neo-fascist Anglo-
Americans" and condemned the US for voting with Turkey and 
Britain in the UN debate.
