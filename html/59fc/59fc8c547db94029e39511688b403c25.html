 Indications that efforts are
 being made to speed up the organ-
 ization of the long-heralded Cuban
 political machine, the United Party
 of the Socialist Revolution (PUBS),
 continue to appear in the press
 and in speeches by Cuban leaders.
 The development of the party,
 interrupted during the crisis last
 fall, has resumed.
 "Model workers" are being
 "elected't  to FURS cells  at  work
 centers and state farms throughout
 the country.  The several hundred
 cells formed so far are. being or-
 ganized into district committees.
 The formal establishment of the
 party, promised this year, is to
 occur at a still unscheduled First
 National Congress.
 On 22 February Fidel Castro
 spoke before what he described as
 the first mass meeting of party
 adherents.  Although emphasizing
 that the organization of the party
 must move slowly, stressing quality
 rather than quantity, he pointed
 out that PUBS cells in the western
 provinces include some 10,000 mem-
 bers and that 30, 000 peasani;s  in
 Oriente Province had joined.  Presi-
 dent Dorticos, in a speech on 21
 March to party members in Camaguey
 Province, implied that the party
 organization  would not follow
 Soviet or Chinese models but would
 be fitted to Cuba's particular
 needs.  On 30 March Castro is
 scheduled to address a PUBS meet-
 ing in Matanzas Province.
 Castro first formally announced
 the formation of a single po-
 ]itical party during his "26th of
 July" speech in 1961.  Pending
 its official formation, he ex-
 plained, a provisional organ, the
 Integrated Revolutionary Organ-
 ization (OBI), would develop the
 bases  on  which the single party
 would be built.  The ORI was oa-
 ganized, beginning in the spring
 of 1961, from three pre-existing
 groups: the veteran Communists'
 Popular Socialist Party (PSP);
 Castro's 26th of July Movement
 (M26J), and the 13th of March
 Revolutionary Directorate (DB),
 a student group which played an
 independent role in the fight
 against Batista,
 During early 1962, this
 "fusing of revolutionary forces"
 and the methods of achieving it
 were subjects of growing friction
 between Castro and his "new" Com-
 munists, on the one hand, and a
 group of veteran PSP members, on
 the other,  The leader of the
 latter group,  long-time PSP
 leader Anibal Escalante, was
 subsequently expelled from the
 ORI leadership and exiled.  Since
 then the remaining veteran Com-
 munists appear to have accommo-
 dated themselves to Castro's
 leadership.
 as  we 11.
 The PUBS is evidently being
 organized from scratch--rather than
 out of the ORI organization--and
 in a manner designed to prevent
 it from being influenced by any
 organized remnants of former po -
 ]itical  part~.es,  including the
 PSP.  Veteran Communists, however,
 are almost certain to play an
 important role in the new party

 Cuba
 CASTRO INTERVIEW WITH FRENCH JOURNALIST
 Both Havana and Moscow were
 evidently embarrassed by the
 publication of an interview be-
 tween Fidel Castro and French
 journalist Claude Julien in the
 Paris newspaper Le Monde on 22
 and 23 March.  Despite Castro's
 "categorical refutation," the
 interview as published is char-
 acteristic of Castro, and there
 is no reason to doubt that he
 made the statements attributed
 to him.  These comments further
 reveal his anger over the So-
 viet missile pullout last fall,
 his condemnation of the subser-
 vience to Moscow of satellite
 governments and parties, and
 his resolve not to allow Cuba
 to fall into such a role.
 Moscow published only those
 portions of Castro's refutation
 reaffirming his friendship for
 Khrushchev and the Soviet party
 and government, and alleging
 that his remarks had been dis-
 torted by "pro-imperialist"
 elements.  The  Pravda  article
 made no reference to Castro's
 denial that he had ever made
 any statement about Khrushchev
 "in an unfriendly manner."
 The Communist World
 PENKOVSKY SPY TRIAL RUMORED IMMINENT IN MOSCOW
 It is rumored in Moscow that
 Oleg Penkovsky, a Soviet official
 accused last December of spying
 for the West, will shortly stand
 trial for treason.  Several high-
 ranking officials are said to be
 implicated, and the case could
 have repercussions in the highest
 levels of the Soviet leadership.
 The American Embassy believes
 that some top-ranking political
 figures could be manipulating
 the affair to discredit or dis-
 grace their rivals.

 Penkovsky had given "foreign

 The Communist World
 First deputy premier and
 party presidium member Aleksey
 Kosygin is also among those al-

 case.  His son-in=law, Dzherman
 Gvishiani, was Penkovsky's imme-

 duties, Gvishiani has frequent
 contacts with members of the West-

 has on occasion been relatively
 outspoken in discussing Soviet
 economic problems with them.
 The Kremlin may not yet have
 decided how to handle Penkovsky's
 trial.  Its seeming potential for
 touching off a major political
 scandal would suggest that he is
 to be tried in camera and quietly

 THE MOSCOW-PEIPING DIALOGUE
 Attempts  by both the Chi-
 nese and Soviet parties to dis-
 pel the atmosphere of outright
 hostility but at the same time
 to demonstrate that they have
 no intention of compromising
 suggest that preparations for
 bilateral talks are being made.
 Immediately after the Chinese
 on 13 March published the ex-
 change of letters which agreed
 in principle to such talks, So-
 viet Ambassador to China  Cher-
 vonenko  returned to Moscow,
 perhaps to take part in prepar-
 atory discussions.
 There is some indication,
 however, that the Soviets may
 be attempting to stall these
 initial sessions.  Peiping on
 25 March broadcast the text
 of an Indonesian letter to
 both the Chinese and Soviets
 which welcomes the "fact" that
 the two parties will hold bi-
 lateral talks as an important
 step toward a meeting of the
 Communist parties of the world.
 The letter  also  warned,
 however,  that  the "modern
 revisionists"--the  Chinese
 characterization  of Khrushchev
 and his followers--will "attempt
 to  frustrate  the  bilateral
 talks."  Khrushchev  probably
 would want  to  drag  out
 preparations  as long as
 possible, since his interest
 lies more  with keeping  the
 Chinese from  attacking  his
 policies than with meeting with
 them to resolve differences.  In
 publicizing the Indonesian letter

 PEIPING CALLS FOR MORE RATIONAL ECONOMIC PLANNING
 Several recent editorials
 in People's Daily indicate that
 Peiping is still taking a
 cautious approach in planning
 means to revive the depressed
 economy. ~No specific goals
 have been announced, either for
 this year or for the Third Five-
 Year Plan which began in January.
 The editorials do not sug-
 gest any intent to use last
 year's  slight easing of economic
 difficulties  to  justify another
 crash economic program.  On the
 contrary,  they explicitly con-
 demn the waste involved in "ir-
 rational" planning and direct all
 enterprises "to prevent and
 oppose" any tendency to ignore
 quality in pursuit of quantita-
 tive goals.  They acknowledge
 the need to set strict technical
 standards, strengthen research
 and design, and respect the
 authority of scientific and
 technical personnel.
 Peiping's continued adher-
 ence to its goal of autarky is
 evident in the statement:  "We
 must reply on our own industry
 to provide various raw materials,
 supplies, and fuel as well as
 machinery...for the moderniza-
 tion of agriculture and national
 defense."
 Agricultural workers are
 given the modest goal of an
 aver-all increase in production,
 and are enjoined to draw up their
 plans within reasonable limits
 and with local conditions in
 mind.  Better quality of farm
 work is linked with improving
 the operation and management of
 the production teams, and "prac-
 tical measures" for improving
 their operation are stressed..
 Communes are warned to respect
 the rights of the production team
 and to discuss with the members
 proposals related to the state
 plan.
 While Peiping remains
 cautiously optimistic--"our
 difficulties are less than they
 were before"--there is a strong
 undercurrent of concern over the
 summer harvest.  The regime seems
 to recognize the importance of
 increased agricultural output as
 a stimulant to the lagging
 economy, shows no inclination
 to risk the consequences of fur-
 ther radical innovations in
 rural organization, and has ex-
 pressly prohibited allowing
 any "undertakings or conferences"
 to hamper performance of the
 spring farming tasks.  Although
 further experiment and adjust-
 ments in farm organization are
 likely, the leadership must be
 aware that any severe tightening
 of  controls  could wipe  out  the     25X1
 present narrow margin of food
 supplies.

 The Communist World
 PARTY-ARMY RELATIONS  IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 For the past two months the
 Chinese Communists have devoted
 more than customary attention to
 questions of morale and political
 reliability in the armed forces.
 Military representatives have
 been summoned to a series of "po-
 litical work" conferences in Pei-
 ping. Mao Tse-tung and other top
 political leaders have addressed
 the sessions or personally re-
 ceived the delegates.
 The longest conference was
 a 25-day session in February-
 which apparently centered on pro-
 moting acceptance of party poli-
 cies by the professional military
 officers.  Political education
 was held to be the "foremost"
 task in the armed forces, which
 were exhorted to see that party
 directives were "truly imple-
 mented."
 There is apparently consid-
 erable dissatisfaction among mili-
 tary officers about delays in
 modernizing  the armed farces.
 This feeling seems to be strong-
 est in the air force, where some
 elements are said to favor a po-
 litical accommodation with Mos-
 cow in order to restore Soviet
 military aid to China.  Two po-
 litical work conferences since
 September were convened specifi-
 cally for air force representa-
 t Ives .
 The party line verbally ac-
 cepts the need to accelerate the
 modernization program.  However,
 it was. made clear at the 25-day
 session in February that modern-
 ization could not go forward on
 a  crash basis.      Officers  and men
 were urged to be "patient in
 anticipation of further im-
 provement."
 There are also indications
 of official concern over the evap-
 oration of revolutionary elan
 among enlisted personnel.  Mast
 of the men now in the armed forces
 entered after the Korean war, lack
 combat experience, and have been
 affected in their attitudes by re-
 ports of economic hardships suf-
 fered by their families at home.
 A campaign is under way to propa-
 gandize  the  life and deeds of
 Lei Feng, a model soldier said
 to personify the best in Com-
 munist revolutionary and patriotic
 qualities.
 The increased attention to
 political indoctrination in the
 armed forces  coincides with a
 "socialist education" campaign
 among the population generally.
 The program, therefore, may simply
 ref lest a prudent concern about
 slipping morale, rather than any
 special anxiety about military
 loyalty.  Combat performance was
 good during the border hostilities
 with India last fall, and the armed
 forces were fully responsive to
 regime directives in terminating
 the mass exodus to Hong Kong the
 previous spring.
 In  the  counts`y  at  large ,
 the "socialist education" cam-
 paign had reportedly resulted
 in numerous arrests.  It is
 possible--although there is no
 firm evidence on this point--
 that some purging has also been
 under way in the armed forces.
 It was reported last September
 that dissident air force offi-
 cers were to be "dealt with"
 shortly.

 KOREAN MILITARY RULERS MANEUVER TO KEEP POWER
 South Korean military
 leaders are maneuvering for an
 accommodation with civilian
 politicians that will preserve
 military domination of the gov-
 ernment.  The chiefs of the
 armed services and some senior
 generals have moved to take con-
 trol of the situation.  It is
 not yet clear whether Pak Chong-
 hui, heretofore leader of the
 ruling junta, now is merely a
 front or is still able to exert
 s ignif icant  influence .
 but they continue to press the
 regime to compromise.  Otherwise,
 they say, they will "resume the
 struggle."  Although  the prin-
 cipal civilian leaders, like
 former president Yun po-Sun and
 farmer prime minister Ho Chong,
 appear firm in such a  position
 lesser figures faced with the ~
 military's determination to
 retain control may choose to
 accept whatever deal they can
 get rather than be completely
 shut out of the government.
 The regime intends to use
 the conference of civilian and
 military leaders that began on
 27 March to arrange a coalition
 that will appear to broaden sup-
 port for the junta.  The military
 rulers feel that this would
 allow them to remain in power
 and appease foreign critics.
 The acting foreign minister
 claims that the regime's plans
 are flexible and that the period
 of extended military rule map be
 only two or three years rather
 than the four originally envis-
 aged in the 16 March announcement
 by Pak which set off the current
 maneuvering.  Spokesmen for the
 regime also are taking the line
 that an interim government--with
 civilian representation--is
 necessary to maintain order and
 lay the foundation for "true
 democracy's in South Korea.
 The politicians continue
 to push for a return to civil-
 ian government this year. Pri-
 vately they are pessimistic,
 Meanwhile, the political
 apparatus left behind by former
 security chief Kim Chong-pil
 when he was sent abroad last
 February is working with the
 military leaders to extend Pak's
 rule.  There is evidence, however,
 that this cooperation may be
 temporary and. that the military
 leaders intend eventually to
 destroy Kim's organization.
 Same reports suggest that
 the general public is willing
 to accept a continuation of
 military rule.  While generally
 favoring civilian government,
 most Koreans at this point
 appear more concerned that
 stability be preserved..  Thus
 far small protest demonstrations
 organized by  the  politicians
 have generated little enthusi-
 asm  and have been easily con-
 trolled.  The police have
 avoided brutal tactics which
 could create martyrs and inflame
 public sentiment.

 UAR, SYRIA, AND IRAQ FEDERATION TALKS IN RECESS
 Negotiations on the estab-

 tion between the UAR, Syria, and
 Iraq are moving slowly.
 The talksAwhich began in
 Cairo more than two weeks ago,
 now are in their second recess
 and are not schedule

 and Syrian Baathists, on the

 which the central authority would
 coordinate military operations
 and foreign affairs while the
 three states would retain their
 independence of action in most

 commander in chief, General
 Atasi, who is committed neither
 to Nasir nor to the Baath, has
 been named president of the
 National Council of the Revolu-

 him the most powerful man in

 KING HUSAYN APPOINTS NEW JORDANIAN CABINET
 King Husayn appointed a
 new government on 27 March in
 an attempt to brace Jordan for
 repercussions of the recent
 coups in Iraq and Syria.
 Husayn is well aware of the
 threat those events indirectly
 posed for Jordan.  rie also was
 aware that the government of
 Prime Minister Tal had lost
 much favor within the country
 because of some of its policies,
 including Jordanian support of
 the Yemeni royalists.
 The King therefore decided
 that the situation required a
 government which he felt would
 be better able to maintain firm
 control of the country in the
 event of serious trouble.
 The new cabinet is led
 by the able, if unpopular,
 Samir Rifai--a  64-year-old  vet-
 eran of five previous terms as
 prime minister.  The designated
 deputy is a year older than
 Rifai and is also a conservative,
 former prime minister. Four
 of the ministers are holdovers
 fram Tal's cabinet.
 The change is unlikely to
 absolve Husayn of  his  owri re-
 sponsibility for the unpopular
 policies associated with Tal.
 Dissatisfaction has grown and
 is said to be so widespread
 among junior officers in the
 army that almost any coup at-
 tempt would receive their
 support.
 Thus  far there  is  no  firm
 evidence of imminent trouble.
 However, the general atmosphere
 and reports of plotting have
 prompted the regime to take
 precautionary measures.  Fifty-
 ?two officers of doubtful loyalty

 The premier continues to
 assure US off ieials he will
 have a comfortable parliamen=
 tary majority when he completes
 the reshuffling of his cabinet.
 On 24 March he said he was in
 the "last phase" of his nego-
 tiations, and that he would
 not include extremist follow-
 ers of the late Patrice Lumumba
 or his political heir, Antoine
 Gizenga.  Ambassador Gullion

 moreover, are making it clear

 prelude to the session of the
 Katanga assembly opening on
 1 April.  It is not yet clear
 if the Balubakat deputies from

 STALEMATE IN TOGO MAY BE BREAKING
 Provisional President Gru-
 nitsky continues to encounter
 difficulties in his efforts to
 restore legality in Togo and
 gain foreign recognition.  He
 has, however, been encouraged
 by some recent developments,
 including firmer assurances of
 French support.  The promised
 elections and a simultaneous
 constitutional referendum now
 have been set for 5 May.
 Considering his meager as-
 sets, Grunitsky has maneuvered
 adroitly amidst the conflicting
 internal and foreign pressures
 unleashed by the assassination
 of president Olympio in January.
 While his coalition government
 lacks cohesion, he appears to
 have an effective grip on civil
 functions and is taking stranger
 measures to curb the troublesome
 military elements wha staged the
 coup and retain ultimate power.
 Finance Minister Meatchi,
 who is believed to favor close
 ties with Ghana, has so far
 made no move to take over.  He
 seems to be concentrating for
 the present on building up his
 following, perhaps with Ghanaian
 help, among fellow northerners.
 Grunitsky's position re-
 cently improved when segments
 of Olympio's Togolese Unity (UT)
 party publicly endorsed Grunit-
 sky's plan for single-list elec-

 ~Frould be distributed equally

 ever, the UT's new leaders, con-

 to US officials that his group
 is playing for time and that
 its resistance has been stif-
 fened by the sympathetic hear-
 ing Olympio's son Bonito and
 other UT exiles have received

 No African state besides
 Ghana and Senegal has recognized
 the Togo regime de jure, but
 the 13 moderate French-speaking
 states comprising the Afro-
 Malagasy Union  (UANt)  at  their
 recent "summit" meeting reportedly

 a wide mandate to support Gru-

 sent his commerce minister and

 to stay there pending a solu-

 most of the UAM leaders regard
 acceptable elections as the
 essential precondition for recog-

 punishment of Olympio's assassins
 as urged by Ivory Coast Presi-

 event, the possibility of foreign
 military intervention in support
 of a countercoup attempt seems
 to have diminished.
 Although little hard infor-

 UN SHOWDOWN LOOMS ON SOUTHERN RHODESIA QUESTION
 Britain's refusal to press
 Southern Rhodesia further to
 allow increased African partic-
 ipation in the colony's govern-
 ment is likely to draw new at-
 tacks from the Afro-Asian and.
 Communist blocs at the UN.  Even
 some Western-oriented delegates
 see  little justification  far  the
 uncompramising stand taken by
 the British delegate in the 24-
 member Decolonization Committee
 on 21 March.
 Landon argues that the UN
 is precluded by Article 2 of
 its Charter from interfering in
 the damestic affairs of any
 state, and that the British
 Government has gradually re-
 linquished jurisdiction over
 internal matters in Southern
 Rhodesia since the promulgation
 of the 1923 constitution which
 gave the colony same degree of
 self-government.
 tion with South Africa's apart-
 heid government.  The British
 also fear that Field's govern-
 ment, if sufficiently provoked,
 might embarrass London by ask-
 ing for immediate independence.
 The British have long held that
 their ability to withhold inde-
 pendence acts as a lever on the
 whi+_e-supremacist government.
 Unless the British make
 some conciliatory gesture to-
 ward the Afro-Asian group, how-
 ever, it is likely that the
 Committee of 24 will rifer the
 issue to a larger forum in the
 UN where Asian and African rep-
 resentation is substantial.  The
 Tunisian delegate on the com-
 mittee believes that the Security
 Council should take the formal-
 istic step of designating the
 question as a "potential threat
 to the peace."  Such a move
 would encounter a UK veto.
 Asian and African delegates
 insist, however, that London
 has the power to revise that
 constitution to provide for
 greater African participation
 in the government.  Britain is
 resisting pressure from other
 Western delegations to make at
 least a token effort at compli-
 ance.  It is motivated to a
 large extent by fear of pushing
 Southern Rhodesian Prime Minis-
 ter Field into closer coopera-
 The Soviet delegate on 19
 March urged that the special ses-
 sion of the UN General Assembly
 set for May (to discuss UN fi-

 the question of immediate inde-
 pendence  for  an African-doma.-

 USSR succeeded in a similar
 tactic last spring by raising
 the Rhodesian question during a  2sx1

 Europe
 The proposed 29 March
 foreign ministers' meeting of
 the West European Union has
 been scuttled by France's
 opposition to including on the
 agenda any discussion of in-
 ternal European problems.  This
 means the collapse for the
 present of efforts by other
 EEC countries to find a forum
 for continuing  discussions
 concerning British membership
 in the Common Market.
 Although the issue of
 EEC links with Britain has also
 been hashed over by speakers at
 this week's session of the
 EEC's European Parliament, the
 discord between France and the
 other Common Market countries
 now is focusing increasingly
 on problems associated with
 the forthcoming; world-wide trade
 and tariff negotiations under
 the US Trade Expansion Act
 (TEA),
 France insists that fur-
 ther internal progress within
 the EEC is necessary before
 the Common Market can partici-
 pate in negotiations under the
 TEA (see special report on
 French economic policy toward
 the Common Market and the US).
 The Netherlands, Belgium, and
 Italy are trying to turn this
 argument around by refusing to
 cooperate on internal EEC mat-
 ters of interest to France un-
 less Paris agrees to TEA talks.
 West Germany's position is
 equivocal: it has openly ex-
 pressed support for the TEA,
 but in some internal EEC meet-
 ings has seemed reluctant to
 oppose the French.
 A key issue in the present
 argument is the change of the
 member states' tariffs which,
 long before the present dissen-
 sion arose, was scheduled to
 occur on 1 July 1963.  France
 has been insisting that on this
 date the six nations, as planned,
 make the second of three ad-
 justments toward a common exter-
 nal tariff.  This means that
 France's generally high tariffs
 would be lowered another third
 of the way toward the common
 level which the EEC hopes to
 achieve by 196?.  Benelux and
 Germany, with generally lower
 tariffs, would have to raise
 their import duties another
 third of the way toward the
 common level.  Italy, whose
 tariffs lie between the high
 and low extremes, would also
 make appropriate adjustments.
 The Belgians and the Dutch,
 claiming to have German support,
 are proposing that they and the
 Germans adjust their tariffs
 upward by one third less 20
 percent, in anticipation that
 the general level of the EEC's
 common external tariff would
 be reduced at least that much
 through negotiations under the
 TEA.  Since France's tariffs
 start at the high end of the
 scale, they would have to be
 reduced by one third plus 20
 percent of the difference be-
 tween present and planned future
 levels.
 An official of the West
 German delegation to the EEC
 believes France might agree to
 this proposal so that the EEC
 could continue its "forward

 DE GAULLE'S PERSONAL POLITICAL PLANS
 There is increasing evi-
 dence that, at the age of 72,
 General de Gaulle is projecting
 his personal plans at least
 through France's next presiden-
 tial election in 1965, and per-
 haps through the seven years of
 another presidential term.  He
 is apparently considering a ref-
 erendum on creation of a vice-
 presidency to share some of the
 chores which now devolve on the
 president.  Such a plan suggests
 an interest in remaining in of-
 fice beyond 1965.
 De Gaulle is said to favor
 former premier Michel Debrd as
 vice president.  Ultimately,
 however, he wishes Fremier
 Georges Pompidou to succeed
 him at the Elysee Palace.
 Under De Gaulle's plan,
 the vice president would assume
 the functions of the president
 only on an interim basis.  As
 under the present system, which
 makes the president of the Senate
 the interim successor, new
 presidential elections would be
 called within 20-50 days after
 removal of the president.
 A decision by De Gaulle to
 remain in active political life,
 which his son-in-law and mili-
 tary aide, Col. Alain Boissieu,
 has implied has in fact been
 made, would deeply affect the
 plans and prospects of the
 non-Communist opposition.  Many
 of its leaders have looked to
 the 1965 presidential elections
 as a catalyst in the formation
 of a democratic opposition.
 While some of them still think
 in terms of traditional party
 positions, others have been
 aiming at a broad political
 movement which would avoid left-
 right labels.
 These leaders generally as-
 sumed, however, that their can-
 didate would not be up against
 De Gaulle personally.  If De
 Gaulle remains at the helm,
 their hope of creating a polit-
 ical system based on two non-
 communist parties would be se-
 verel  weakened.

 FRENCH COAL STRIKE ENTERS FIFTH WEEK
 Having  failed to end the
 four-week-old strike in the
 nationalized coal industry by
 an improved wage offer, the
 French Government reportedly
 is resigned to letting it drag
 on for several more weeks. Paris
 remains determined to hold the
 line against inflation and hopes
 pressures will mount to force
 the miners to accept terms only
 slightly better than the 8-per-
 cent wage boost they have just
 rejected.  Their original de-
 mand was for 11 percent.
 The government based its
 offer on the report of the
 special committee it appointed
 to study how far public sector
 wages lagged behind private
 industry,  However, the unions
 rejected the recommended time-
 table for implementing the
 offered wage boost, and the
 government refused to discuss
 union demands for a reduced work-
 week and longer vacations.  The
 unions began to use their joint
 strike fund only this week, and
 officials estimate it will be
 sufficient to finance the strike
 for another month.
 The natural  gas  workers
 have ended their strike on the
 basis of a management pledge to
 grant them any benefits won by
 the miners, and this development
 could put pressure on the miners
 to come to terms with the govern-
 ment.  Sporadic strikes are con-
 tinuing in the public sector,
 however, and utilities workers
 on 28 March began an eight-day
 series of harassing walkouts.
 There is some talk of a strike
 throughout the nationalized
 industries, but union  leaders
 reportedly believe that only
 the miners are willing to go
 beyond a 48-hour strike.  The
 government expects strikes and
 agitation in the other nation-
 alized industries to continue
 until summer.
 The coal strike is begin-
 ning to affect industrial pro-
 duction; certain factories in
 the north are already curtailing
 operations.  Work stoppages by
 the electricity workers are in-
 terrupting plant scheduling,
 and dislocation in industry is
 occurring as a result.  The
 government is confident that
 the progressive slowdown of
 production and the gradual dis-
 location of the economy resulting
 from a prolonged strike will seri-
 ously erode the miners' public
 support.

 NORWAY SEEKS CONTINUED US MILITARY AID
 The Norwegian Government
 faces problems in financing its
 proposed defense program for
 1964-68 arising from the  antie-
 ip ated  gradual decline in US
 military assistance over the
 next five years.  Last week it
 sent Foreign Minister Lange and
 Defense Minister Harlem to Wash-
 ington to consult with US offi-
 cials concerning prospects for
 obtaining supplementary US as-
 sistance to meet Norway's needs.
 The government plans to con-
 tinue to acquire modern equip-
 ment for the armed forces and to
 make a greater effort to meet
 its NATO force goals.  However,
 increased outlays in the public
 investment and social welfare
 sectors are already a strain on
 the economy.  Government offi-
 cials maintain that as a result
 of the scheduled phaseout of US
 military assistance--which has
 amounted to almost $84 million
 annually aver the past decade--
 Norway will be unable to meet
 its defense commitments.  They
 reject as economically and po-
 litically infeasible any pro-
 posals to increase defense spend-
 ing sufficiently to offset the
 loss of US aid.
 The Norwegians are primarily
 interested at this time in getting
 increased assistance for the c?n-
 struction of naval craft such
 as escort vessels, large sub-
 marine~chasers, and motor gun-
 boats, since actual construction
 costs of these items have con-
 siderably exceeded estimates.
 The other major problem concerns
 aircraft modernization and the
 choice  of  a  fighter a ircraft
 best suited. to Norway's needs
 and financial means.
 Both Lange and Harlem dis-
 claimed any interest by Norway
 in participating in the proposed
 NATO multilateral nuclear force
 and questioned its need.  Fol-
 lowing their return to Oslo, they
 told the press that Norway's
 long-established policy of not
 permitting foreign troops or nu-
 clear weapons on its territory
 in peacetime was understood
 and  accepted by the United
 States.

 Market question.  Policy respon-
 sibility for this matter has
 been shifted to the People's

 Kreisky has been blamed in
 People's Party circles for the
 lack of progress in Austrian-

 ters other than the EEC issue

 four-year term.
 A new test of strength between
 the two coalition partners will
 occur in the presidential elec-

 the popular Socialist incumbent,
 is expected to defeat the re-
 spected, but ailing ex-Chancellor

 LAG IN ARGENTINA'S ELECTORAL PREPARATIONS
 Differences among the politi-
 cal parties and the disruptive
 tactics of the Peronists continue
 to impede preparations for Argen-
 tina's national elections scheduled
 for 23 June.  This lag is causing
 marked unrest, which on 27 March
 led Interior Minister Martinez,
 chief architect of the government's
 election plans, to proffer his
 resignation.
 Seven parties, including the
 Peronists, have agreed in principle
 to form a national front and to
 select a common candidate for the
 presidency.  They are insisting,
 however, that agreement be reached
 on a program before the candidate
 is selected.  A still hotly debafied
 issue is whether the government
 should continue to maintain con-
 tracts with foreign petroleum com-
 panies--mainly U S firms--which
 have greatly expanded production
 since 1958.
 There are also differences
 within the parties over possible
 candidates, especially with ex-
 President Frondizi's Intransigent
 Radical Civic Union (UCRI).  The
 new UCRI party president, Oscar
 Alende, wants the candidacy, but
 Frondizi fears this would diminish
 his own future influence in the
 party.  Neither Frondizi nor
 Peron, the two key figures in de-
 ciding a possible front candidate,
 has made his preferences public.
 The role of the Peronists and
 their Popular Union party continues
 to worry some military and civilian
 groups.  On 8 March the Peronists
 were awarded a court judgment giv-
 ing their party legal status. The
 navy issued a statement on 18
 March  asking  the  government
 to appeal the electoral judge`s
 decision, since the law bans
 parties and candidates respon-
 sive to Peron's personal leader-
 ship.  Subsequent army and air
 force communiques, however, stated
 that other legal safeguards
 against a return of Peronism made
 such action unnecessary.  The
 army and air force statements
 attempted to  minimizandlt~e navy
 antes with the navy,
 subsequently issued another re-
 lease accepting the government's
 decision.
 Despite such conciliatory
 government action, Peronist leader
 Framini organized a meeting on 18
 March at which he described Per-
 onism as a revolutionary movement
 which aimed to overthrow the
 "oligarchy"  and establish a new
 social structure.  The meeting
 featured all the symbols of the
 Peron dictatorship--pictures of
 Peron and the late Evita, Peranist
 Bangs, and slogans.  Ambassador
 McClintock interprets this as an
 obvious attempt by Framini. to
 provoke repressive action and
 commented that the government had
 no alternative but to order his
 arrest.  Framini was permitted to
 elude capture, however, since the
 government did not wish to make
 a martyr of him.
 Framini is an important leader
 among organized labor, where Per-
 onist strength is concentrated.
 Whether or not his action-was co-
 ordinated with other Peronist lead-
 ers, it raises further doubt about
 the durability of their agreements
 with the government and their in-
 tentions with re~nect to the na-
 tional front.

 POLAND AND LATIN AMERICA
 The Gomulka regime in Po-
 land--at a time when its re-
 lations with Cuba are stagnant
 --is attempting to strengthen
 and expand its presence else-
 where in Latin America.  It has
 already established 15 diplo-
 matic, consular, and permanent
 trade missions with-chief bases
 at Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro,
 and Buenos Aires.  The Soviet
 Union has only six diplomatic
 and trade establishments in
 the entire region.
 Poland began its drive in
 1959 by creating a separate
 department for Latin American
 affairs in its Foreign Ministry.
 In most Latin American countries
 except Cuba, the Poles based
 their diplomatic drive on the
 good will built up by the rela-
 tively large number of Polish
 immigrants and on Poland's out-
 wardly good relations with the
 United States.  Until recently
 economic incentives were a sec-
 ondary factor.
 During 1960 and 1961 Po-
 land succeeded in elevating its
 legations in Brazil and Vene-
 zuela to embassies.  During 1962
 a third Polish consulate in Bra-
 zil was opened at Porto Alegre,
 and an embassy representative
 established an office in Brasilia.
 Last year, Poland dispatched
 its first resident trade mission
 to Haiti, when it became apparent
 that President Duvalier's rela-
 tions with the United States
 were deteriorating.  Reportedly
 the trade commissioner is seek-
 ing to substitute bloc petroleum
 sources and. a Polish refinery
 far US supplies of oil and
 petroleum products.
 Despite strenuous efforts,
 Poland's trade with Latin Amer-
 ica dropped from 4 percent of
 its total trade in 1955 to 3.1
 percent in 1961.  Poland has
 provided Brazil with $70 million
 in credits for Palish goads and
 now is negotiating another such
 deal with Brazil and similar
 arrangements with Chile and Haiti.
 The Poles probably will renew
 credit proposals previously re-
 jected by other Latin American
 countries.
 Exchanges of high-level
 personages, as-well as of par-
 liamentary, business, student,
 and cultural delegations, have
 been stepped up in the past two
 years.  The Polish and Brazilian
 foreign ministers have exchanged
 visits, and President Goulart
 reportedly plans to visit Poland
 in June.  Polish Premier Cyrankie-
 wicz recently completed a week-
 long good-will visit to Mexico,
 which will be reciprocated by
 President Lopez Mateos from 1
 to 3 April.

 In sharp contrast, none of

 After a June 1962 trip to Cuba,
 during which he reportedly urged

 Foreign Minister Rapacki bit-
 terly said that  nobody can con-
 trol" the courseT,of the Cuban
 revolution.  No Cuban ambassador
 has been stationed in Warsaw
 since August 1962, when Salvador
 Massip was officially recalled.
 Poland probably considers
 its trade with Cuba burdensome
 and unprofitable, but it is
 obliged to fill its share of bloc
 commitments.  Total trade in
 1960 amounted to $14 million;
 in 1961 it rose to a high of
 $4? million, which the Poles
 tried desperately to conceal
 from the US; and in 1962 it
 probably fell about $22 million.
 Hard  negotiations on a 1963
 trade protocol began in October.
 Despite a meeting between Gomulka
 and the Cuban negotiator--which
 apparently was less than cordial
 --no agreement has yet been
 reached.
