April 22, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
State officials since the 15th amendment ex-
tends to both. The exemption under the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 of elections for those 
officials most closely affecting the day-by-
day life of local citizens is particularly in-
advisable since the disabilities under color of 
law from which Negroes suffer most deeply 
are imposed by such officials: 
We therefore recommend the addition to 
S. 1664 of sections similar to those now con-
tained in S. 1517 and H.R. 4552 amending 
sections 2004 of the Revised Statutes (42 
U.S.C., sec. 1971) to eliminate the provisions 
limiting it to Federal elections. 
CONCLUSION 
The history of the development (V Negro 
voting rights since the ratification of the 
15th amendment in 1870 has been replete 
with constant efforts, both simple and so-
phisticated, to circumvent its basic pur-
pose?elimination of distinctions on the 
grounds of race or color in the right to vote. 
Sincere efforts by Congress and the Ex-
ecutive to meet these problems through 
the courts have proven unsuccessful 
despite the provisions of the 1957, 1960, and 
1964 Civil Rights Acts. The record makes 
clear that administrative procedures are 
essential to permit rapid and extensive reg-
istration ot persons heretofore discrimina-
torily denied the right to vote. We believe 
that the proposed bill is a clearly constitu-
tional exercise of congressional power under 
the 15th amendment, and we strongly urge 
its prompt enactment with the strengthen-
ing and clarifying amendments we have sug-
gested. 
Respectfully submitted.

APRIL 10, 1965. 
THE SITUATION IN VIETNAM 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I noted 
with great interest the debate which was 
held on the floor of the Senate yester-
day with respect to the situation in 
Vietnam. I believe that the suggestion 
which was made by the majority leader, 
the Senator from Montana [Mr. MANS-
FIELD), and concurred in by other 
Members of great distinction in the Sen-
ate, was a most constructive one. 
I should like to add, however, this one 
point, which I believe is very important 
to our country. I, like every other Sen-
ator, travel widely, particularly in my 
own State, and in other States as well, 
and as a result I have a very good idea 
of what is worrying our people. There 
are straws in the wind to indicate that 
there is to be an escalation of our efforts 
No. 71---7 
on the ground in Vietnam. If the Com-
mander in Chief feels that a further 
commitment is necessary with regard to 
ground forces in the Vietnamese strug-
gle--paralleling what we are trying to do 
in the air, with American aircraft actu-
ally engaged in bombardment?then, at 
that point, I believe the issue should 
again be submitted to Congress and to 
the country, and Congress should have 
an opportunity to give a new mandate 
in that respect. 
I point out that the joint resolution 
which Congress passed on August 7, 
1964?which I supported and which I 
continue to support, as I support the 
President's actions?"approves and sup-
ports the determination of the President, 
as Commander in Chief, to take all neces-
sary measures to repel any armed at-
tack against the forces of the United 
States and to prevent further aggres-
sion." 
In the same resolution the President is 
authorized?if he needs authorization?
"to take all necessary steps, including 
the use of armed force, to assist any 
member or protocol state of the South-
east Asia Collective Defense Treaty re-
questing assistance in defense of its free-
dom." 
That resolution gave the President au-
thority, if he needed any. I urge upon 
the President that he again ask the ad-
vice of Congress if we are to engage in 
the struggle in Vietnam on yet another 
level by Commitment of an appreciable 
number of our ground forces in actual 
combat. I say that because such a com-
mitment is of such a nature and of such 
importance that Congress should again 
have the opportunity to pass on it by 
resolution. 
I shall draft a resolution on that sub-
ject, if it is needed, though the admin-
istration is well able to do it. However, 
I urge that it be done that way, rather 
than through unilateral action by the 
Commander in Chief, if that is the step 
we contemplate. 
CHARLES B. BOLTON, RECIPIENT 
OF HAWKEN SCHOOL ALUMNI 
AWARD 
Mrs. SMITH. Mr. President, recently 
a distinguished citizen of Ohio received 
the coveted Hawken School Alumni 
Award for his work in education in vari-
ous fields. He is Charles B. Bolton, 
business executive and philanthropist of 
Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. Bolton considers 
as tremendously exciting the challenge 
of today confronting educational estab-
lishments, independent, parochial and 
public. But he regards it as sobering in 
the realization that the future of this 
and other countries is at stake. 
It is his considered opinion that the 
present social unrest will be resolved only 
through education. 
Because his acceptance speech sets 
forth impressive perspective in the fund-
amentals of the mission of education, I 
ask unanimous consent that it be placed 
in the REcoan at this point. 
There being no objection, the speech 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
7989-
President, members of the alumni, 
ladies, and friends, many thoughts are rac-
ing through my mind as I stand here to-
night. Thoughts that are most difficult to 
put into words. Basically these are a con-
fused mixture of incredibility, surprise, 
humbleness, and disbelief flavored with the 
salt of pride and gratitude. To be honored 
by men, many of whom I have known in-
timately as friends over a period of 50 years, 
is something I cannot talk about as I feel 
an emotion that mere words tend to destroy. 
I've searched diligently, however, for a simple 
word or phrase to adequately express my 
feelings and only one truly does. I use it 
in its very broadest and all encompassing 
sense?thank you. 
John Newell, our president, has asked that 
I talk to you about Hawken School as I see 
it, both today and tomorrow. This I am 
more than willing to do provided all of you 
remember these thoughts and opinions are 
mine alone. They do not necessarily ex-
press any official conceptions of or de-
cisions by the board of trustees, but are 
strictly those of an alumnus who has been 
forntunate enough to be associated with 
Hawken in some capacity since its inception. 
In thinking of Hawken School today one 
cannot help but think of the many well-lived 
yesterdays that made the immediate real-
ities of today and the great dreams of to-
morrow even possible. These memories lump 
together, I'm sure, in your minds as well as 
In mine, but let me briefly sort them out 
into three categories; housing, traditions, and 
individuals. 
All of us here tonight are fully aware of 
the humble facilities available in first one 
quarter and then a second on Ansel Road 
that housed the newborn but lusty Hawken, 
followed by the move to the then new build-
ing in Lyndhurst. All three changes in lo-
cation were implemented by the growth of 
the student body and were made only after 
much study and thought by Mr. Hawken and 
the then small board of trustees. The 
school resembled an adolescent, growing in 
great spurts and, as is typical of youth, con-
stantly on the verge of fiscal collapse with 
only faith and friends as parents to turn to 
in the struggle toward manhood. These 
moves were followed by a period of compara-
tive calm during which reorganization and 
strengthening were stressed. Growth, how-
ever, was not to be denied and the Lynd-
hurst facilities grew in size to be followed, 
only recently, by the addition of the nucleus 
of an upper school in Gates Mills. Thus at 
last Hawken attained a semblance of man-
hood as far as a physical framework is con-
cerned at the youthful age of 50 years. 
What, you may ask, was the moving force 
behind this growth, the flame under the 
broiler and the fuel to feed the fire. I be-
lieve it was the desire to extend the tradition 
of excellence in education envisioned by the 
founders, the concept of fairplay and the 
desire that each generation introduce its suc-
cessor to a higher plane of living. These 
three traditions, you will agree, have formed 
Hawken's Triangulum Major in the heavens 
and as such arethe constellation that has 
set the school's course. It is and has been a 
great and true reference point and guide 
through sunlight and storm. May it always 
be so. 
Now, for a minute, I want to pay tribute to 
those rare and devoted men and women who 
conceived the idea we call Hawken, and also 
to those who joined the original group in 
ensuing years, who nurtured it on all fronts, 
in good times and in bad, who have taken the 
knocks and the bows and who have made this 
school loved and respected by not only our-
selves but by countless others as well. Time 
limitations prevent each to be named but no 
one of them ever requires his name to be 
mentioned. Each is aware that Hawken.

ment seized upon him as the strong man The Arab countries, assembled at Presi-
dent Nasser's call, agreed on a united 
front and set up a unified army com-
mand. They also established a Pales-
tinian political body, headquartered in 
Jerusalem, with the objective of carrying 
the case to the United Nations for recog-
nition as a government-in-exile. But 
more importantly, the conference agreed 
to divert the headwaters of the Jordan 
in Lebanon and Syria. Work on this 
project has begun. It is not a project?
as admitted by Egypt and its allies?hav-
ing a worthy irrigation objective. The 
Arab nations could have achieved such an 
objective by adhering to the Johnston 
plan. The Johnston plan was evolved by 
the late Eric Johnston at the request of 
President Eisenhower and provides for 
the equitable distribution of the waters of 
the Jordan River between Israel and the 
Arab nations. The problem is basically 
simple. The Jordan River contains only 
a limited amount of water. In that area 
of the world, water is vital. There simply 
is not enough water for all the nations 
that need it. The Johnston plan simply 
provided for dividing the available waters 
of the Jordan River among the nations 
equitably and on the basis of their needs. 
But the Arab nations have announced 
that they will not adhere to the Johnston 
plan. What they want to do is keep the 
Jordan's water from irrigating Israeli 
soil. This is truly a "dog-in-the-
manger" attitude. 
With President Nasser taking a lead-
ing part in each and every one of these 
moves against Israel?all designed to de-
stroy that country?it is difficult to fol-
low the Department of State's estimation 
of the situation that President Nasser has 
put the Israel issue "on ice." 
Another reason advanced by the De-
partment of State in justification of its 
policy of appeasing President Nasser is: 
Nasser personally kept a strict silence a

the United States was going to sell Hawk

leagues a while back that the issue be put in mon knowledge that Israel was being 
in the Middle East and by catering to his 
whims sought to build on-that image. 
The appeasement of Colonel Nasser 
has continued from that date to this. 
At about the time I was in Egypt, in 
February 1963, the State Department's 
justification for its policy of appease-
ment was based on the following points, 
quoting from material set forth in my 
report: 
Nasser now is trying to reestablish the 
United Arab links with the West, particu-
larly in Europe. 
His recent wooing of East Germany, his 
permitting the burning of the Kennedy 
Memorial Library in Cairo last Novem-
ber, his shooting down of an unarmed 
Texas Oil plane over Alexandria, with 
the deaths of the American pilot and co-
pilot?to mention but a few incidents?
hardly seems like "trying to reestablish 
links with the West." 
Another justification given by the 
State Department for its appeasement of 
President Nasser was: 
He and his country have done a complete 
turnabout in the Congo?from being one of 
the chief supporters of the late Patrice Lu-
mumba and his leftist successor, Antoine 
Grizenga, to joining ranks behind the United 
Nations in its current efforts for Congo unity. 
But who is now supplying the Congo 
rebels with Russian arms? President 
Nasser of Egypt?the dictator supported 
to the tune of hundreds of millions of 
dollars in U.S. foreign assistance while 
he denounces us as he did, for example, 
in a speech made at Port Said as recently 
as December 23, 1964, in the following 
words: 
Can we possibly recognize Tshombe as the 
representative of the Congolese people? 
Tshombe is a murderer. If America and Bel-
guim had installed Tshombe as a premier, he 
is then a premier in the pay of America and 
Belgium, and we cannot under any circum-
stances recognize him as a premier repre-
senting the Congolese people ? * ? Tshombe 
given arms by West Germany, conven-
iently forgetting the vast amounts of aid 
Egypt has been receiving from the same 
source, both in money and technical as-
sistance, including German scientists of 
the Nazi stripe busily perfecting missiles 
for President Nasser's Egypt. President 
Nasser, in his outrage, also conveniently 
overlooked the tremendous quantity of 
Communist arms received by him over 
the years?arms which were the very 
reason why Israel, for its own defense, 
had to make arms arrangements with 
West Germany. 
As part of his blackmail plot, President 
Nasser invited Ulbricht, of East Ger-
many, to visit Cairo. West Germany, in 
a reaction entirely unbefitting a sophis-
ticated world power, panicked and 
stopped further arms aid to Israel. 
The whole sorry story is set forth in 
a factual editorial in the Washington 
Daily News for March 17, 1965, entitled 
"Who Won." One sentence from the edi-
torial should be quoted at this point: 
United States: Gained bad case of jitters 
for fear Egypt-Israel-German triangle might 
lead to Arab-Israel war with desert water as 
the excuse. 
In great haste, the United States sent 
our roving Ambassador, Mr. Harriman, 
to Israel for secret and urgent talks with 
the heads of that government. 
I am not privy to the purposes and 
objectives of Ambassador Harriman's trip 
or to what was discussed or what was 
agreed to by both sides. But some of 
the rumors and reports coming back 
from Tel Aviv are most disturbing. 
According to the London Times for 
March 3, 1965: 
The divergence of views was principally 
over an American demand that the Eshkol 
government renounce the use or the threat 
of military action. 
However, the New York Times for 
March 4 reported: 
Mr. Harriman, however was said not to 
have laid down any condition of noninter-
vention for Israel's obtaining American mili-
tary assistance. The Israel officials, in turn, 
were said to have made it clear that they 
viewed the arms race and the Jordan River 
problem as separate issues. 
I hope the New York Times article is 
correct and that we?the United States?
did not try to use Nasser's blackmail 
against West Germany as the occasion to 
Pressure Israel to give up its right of 
self-defense. That, no country can give

7992 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD? SENATE April 22, 1965 
bound up with the continued safety of 
that nation. 
Consider the State of Israel. 
Born in strife and turmoil, nurtured in 
adversity, Israel, in the relatively few 
years of its freedom, has been capable 
of phenomenal economic growth in a 
climate of democracy unique in that dic-
tatorship-ridden area of unstable govern-
ments, even though it has been sur-
rounded at its land borders by hostile 
nations sworn to destroy it. 
Even though those nations have been 
having an on-again, off-again romance 
with Communist nations?with Nasser's 
romance as constant and persistent as 
it could be?Israel has steadfastly aimed 
itself with the West. 
If the Arab nations in the Middle East 
had not, through all these long years, 
been consumed by hatred?fanned in 
good measure by President Nasser of 
Egypt, but had instead taken Israel as 
a Model of a democratic government in-
terested in the economic and social ad-
vancement of its people and had followed 
in Israel's footsteps, the Middle East 
would have been today a far more stable 
and ebnomically advanced region. 
The American people have given with-
out stint of their tax dollars for the eco-
nomic development of that area. At the 
conclusion of my remarks I shall set 
forth a table showing just how many 
millions have been poured into that 
region. However, what galls the Amer-
ican people particularly is when Presi-
dent Nasser uses those American tax 
dollars to wage a bitter, bloody war of 
aggression in Yemen, which to date has 
cost him over $2 billion; to pressure 
Libya to force the United States to re-
move its Wheelus Air Base from that 
country; to foment strife in Algeria, Cy-
prus, the Congo, and wherever else Presi-
dent Nasser sees an opportunity to 
thwart the policies of the United 
States and its Western allies. 
The time is long since past for the 
United States to change its policies in 
the Middle East, to stop aiding Nasser 
wage war in that area, and to take posi-
tive measures to bring abiding peace to 
that long-troubled region. 
The Congress is well ahead of the De-
partment of State in urging that these 
Positive steps to curb aggression in the 
Middle East be taken. 
In 1963 there was added to the For-
eign Assistance Act an amendment pro-
posed by me which provided: 
No assistance shall be provided under this 
or any other act, and no sales shall be made 
under the Agricultural Trade Development 
and Assistance Act of 1954, to any country 
which the President determines is engaging 
in or preparing for aggressive military efforts 
directed against?
(1) The United States, 
(2) any country receiving assistance un-
der this or any other act, or 
(8) any country tO which sales are made 
under the Agricultural Trade Development 
and Assistance Act of 3954, until the Presi-
dent determines that such military efforts 
or preparations have ceased and he reports 
to the Congress that he has received assur-
ances satisfactory to him that such military 
efforts or preparations will not be renewed. 
This restriction may not be waived pursuant 
to any authority contained in this act. 
That amendment was adopted in this 
body by a vote of 65 to 13?indicating 
clearly the sentiments of this body. 
That it was clearly aimed at Egypt?
as well as Indonesia?was made per-
fectly clear during the floor debate at 
the time. 
The then majority whip and now Vice 
President HIIMPITREY interpreted the 
language of the amendment as follows: 
There appears to be little doubt that Nas-
ser was responsible for the attack on Yemen, 
and I favor cutting off our aid to Egypt. 
Prom the available evidence it would appear 
that Nasser is guilty, and let us say that he 
is. We know perfectly well what he [Nasser] 
has been doing in Yemen and in Algeria and 
we know perfectly well about his constant 
meddling in the Middle East governments in 
many, many instances which include Iraq 
and Syria; and we could name many more 
of them. 
Despite this clear directive from the 
Congress?and my amendment is still 
the law of the land--no finding has been 
made by the President of the United 
States that President Nasser is waging 
an aggressive war in Yemen or preparing 
for aggression against Israel or aiding 
aggression in Cyprus, as was disclosed 
just recently that Communist missiles 
were being furnished the Greek Cypriots 
by President Nasser. Still our foreign 
aid to Egypt continues. 
Eerlier this year the Congress, feeling 
that some further action should be tak-
en, amended the Supplemental Appro-
priation Act to provide that no further 
Public Law 480 shipments should be 
made to Egypt unless the President found 
that doing so would be in the interest 
of the United States. So far I have not 
been informed that the President has 
made such a finding. It is difficult to see 
how, if there should be any reliance upon 
the facts, the President can make such 
a finding. 
How can the President find the follow-
ing actions by the dictator of Egypt to be 
in the interest of the United States: 
Pressure on Libya to force the United 
States to close our air base there; 
Provision of Communist arms to the 
Congolese rebels, even while they were 
slaughtering innocent whites and Negroes 
and indulging in cannabalism; 
Waging war in Yemen with 50,000 
troops for 21/2 years at a cost of over $2 
billion to date; 
Hurling constant anti-Western propa-
ganda into the Aden area; 
Constant undermining of our prestige 
in Africa; 
Supplying Communist missiles to the 
Greek Cypriots; 
Continuing a barrage of anti-Ameri-
can propaganda in the Egyptian-con-
trolled press and on the Egyptian-con-
trolled radio; 
Recognizing East Germany and pres-
suring the other Arab nations to do like-
wise; 
Taking the leadership in seeking to di-
vert the headwaters of the Jordan from 
peaceful uses. 
These are but random samplings of 
Nasser's anti-American actions in re-
cent times. The intensification of these 
anti-American actions is ominous. Hav-
ing "gotten away with it" in the past, 
with the United States continuing to 
supply his vital food needs despite re-
peated abuse, President Nasser has got-
ten bolder and bolder. 
But worse than that?his "getting 
away with it" emboldens other nations?
friendly to the United States?to at-
tempt the same tactics. 
Jordan is a typical example of a na-
tion which has become colder to ;the 
United States and more closely aligned 
with Egypt as it sees enmity rewarded. 
Our hasty recognition of the Egyptian 
puppet government in Yemen and our 
continued support of Egypt in its aggres-
sions there proved for all the world to 
see that for a nation to thumb its nose 
at the United States was profitable. 
The old method of securing more and 
more foreign assistance was to make 
overtures first to the East and then to the 
West?playing one against the other. 
Something new has been added. Burn 
an American library, storm the Ameri-
can Embassy?American taxpayers dol-
lars will still continue to flow. 
One of the most disturbing and critical 
situations in the Middle East is the 
threatened diversion of the waters of the 
Jordan. Water is the lifeblood of the 
desert parched state of Israel. Diver-
sion of the headwaters of the Jordan will 
be as much an act of aggressive warfare 
against Israel, even though accomplished 
on Lebanese and Syrian soil, as though 
Arab troops physically invaded the land 
of Israel. It is an attempt to make ::s-
mel take the first militant move while 
the Arabs claim they are not militarily 
engaged, and to make Israel appear the 
aggressor. 
The time to prevent this disastrous 
event is now?not when the waters are 
so close to being diverted that Israel 
must take military steps to prevent the 
diversion. 
Let us not mistake the times. History 
is repeating itself. The fateful days and 
events of 1956 are with us again. 
Then?but I hope not now?we waited 
until it was too late?we waited until tile 
border raids onto Israli soil became in-
tolerable, until the seizure of the Suez 
Canal cut the lifeline of France, Britain, 
and Israel, and until their armies 
marched to hold further depredations. 
This time not only are we failing to act, 
we are actually furnishing Nasser with 
the wherewithal to continue his aggres-
sive attacks. 
Self-defense is an inherent right of 
national sovereignty. During its entire 
history, the United States has asserted 
and defended this right, exercising it 
even though its own territory was not 
Invaded. Hit and run raids on defense-
less villages, the intensification of the 
economic boycott, and now, the diversicn 
of water vitally needed for irrigation, can 
rightfully be treated as acts of aggressicn 
warranting forceful retaliation. This 
the United States should recognize ar d 
take adequate and forceful steps to pre-
vent. 
Unfortunately?as in 1956?the Middle 
East advisers in the Department of State 
still seem to believe that, with respect to 
Nasser, we should appease his aggressions 
while telling the aggrieved party?ti e

State of Israel?to turn the other cheek. 
Such a bankrupt policy can, as it has, but 
lead to further aggression on the part of 
other nations. 
The time to slow down the quickened 
arms race in the Middle East is now, not 
when all the countries have squandered 
the wealth so sorely needed for their eco-
nomic development on ever more sophis-
ticated weapons of destruction. 
We have contributed as much to the 
arms race in that area of the world as 
any other nation. We have a moral 
obligation to stop it. 
The facts are simple. In 1956 Nasser 
turned to Russia for weapons. Lacking 
sufficient foreign exchange to pay the 
Russians for the weapons he desired, he 
offered to trade the Russians cotton for 
weapons. That left Nasser short of for-
eign exchange to buy food to feed the 
people of Egypt. Nasser turned to the 
United States, which sold him the needed 
food in exchange for Egyptian pounds, 
the expenditure of which in Egypt Nasser 
controls. 
With his weapons obtained by barter?
weapons which have become better and 
better?Nasser, with his continued 
threats to drive Israel into the sea, be-
c_aine more and more of a menace to 
Israel and to the peace of the Middle 
East. Israel, therefore, had to divert 
foreign exchange sorely needed for its 
own economic development to the pur-
chase of arms to match the ones traded 
to Nasser by Communist Russia. 
These are the simple elements of the 
arms race in the Middle East?an arms 
race made possible in great measure be-
Cause of U.S. foreign aid. 
There are three steps which the United 
States can and should take immediately 
to lessen tensions in the Middle East. 
First, the President of the United 
States should offer his good offices to end 
the declared war in the Middle East. 
The fact remains that the Arab States 
declared war against Israel at that na-
tion's birth. That declaration of war is 
still in existence. It is a running sore in 
that area, the cause of much bitterness 
and the cause of much friction. Israel 
is not at war with the Arab States. How-
ever, the Arab States continue to remain 
In a state of war with respect to Israel. 
I do not urge the diplomatic recognition 
by the Arab States of the State of Israel, 
but only a rescission of the declaration 
of war. 
Second, the United States should im-
mediately enter into a mutual defense 
Pact with Israel, along the lines of the 
mutual defense pact the United States 
maintains with Taiwan and the Philip-
pines. This move alone would lessen the 
need of Israel forever-increased expendi-
tures for costlier and costlier weapons. 
Third, if the United States accedes to 
Libya's request and removes the Wheelus 
Air Force Base from Lybia?it should re-
locate the bose in Israel with Israel's 
assent, as an indication of its firm re-
solve to back up instantly the pledge 
given in its Mutual defense treaty with 
It should go without saying that I pre-
suppose that as a condition precedent 
there will be the immediate enforcement 
of the antiaggressor amendment of the 
Foreign Assistance Act against Egypt 
and those joining Egypt in these contin-
ued preparations for aggression. 
Since Nasser came to power almost 13 
years ago, many in this body have proph-
esied that firm action in dealing with 
Nasser's aggressive intentions were 
needed if the peace was to be kept. 
On June 4, 1956, the Senator who was 
known as the conscience of the Senate, 
the late, great Senator Herbert H. Leh-
man, speaking on this floor at the time 
our government was very foolishly ship-
ing tanks to Saudi Arabia, said: 
Peace will not come (to the Middle East) 
as long as there is on one side blind hate and 
a will to kill and destroy. Peace must be 
baSed on security and respect for legitimate 
hopes and ideals of a noble democratic 
nation. 
I subscribe to those sentiments. They 
are as valid today as they were the day 
they were uttered?a few short months 
before Israel, France, and England 
marched their troops into Egypt to keep 
open the Suez Canal and to stop the hit 
and run raids across Israel's borders. 
We must act now to assure "security 
and respect for the legitimate hopes and 
ideals of a noble democratic state." To-
morrow may be too late. 
I ask unanimous consent that there be 
printed in the RECORD at the conclusion 
of my remarks the editorial "Who Won" 
from the Washington Daily News of 
March 17, 1965, the articles from the 
London Times March 3, 1965, and the 
New York Times for March 4, 1965, and 
a table I have had prepared showing the 
amount of U.S. foreign assistance given 
or loaned to the nations in the Middle 
East. 
There being no objection, the editorial, 
articles and table were ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington Daily News, Mar. 17, 
1965] 
WHO Wow? 
The Mideast game isn't over yet, but let's 
take a look at the score: 
-West Germany: Lost face around the world 
when she let Egypt's Dictator Nasser stam-
pede her into cutting off arms shipments to 
Israel. Regained some face by cutting off 
$250 million economic aid to Nasser?but 
German industries engaged in Egypt under 
that aid program will suffer. Gained back 
more face when she hit at Nasser by offer-
ing diplomatic recognition to Israel. But 
stands to lose diplomatic relations with Egypt 
and a half dozen other Arab States. Arabs 
also expected to recognize Communist East 
Germany in retaliation. This means West 
Germany must junk the Milstein Doctrine, 
which sought to isolate Communist East 
Germany from rest of world. And Germany 
has jeopardized the safety of hundreds of 
West Germans working in Egypt. 
Egypt: Gained $100 million in economic 
aid from East Germany, but lost $250 mil-
lion aid from West Germany. Lost face when 
several Arab States failed to follow Nasser's 
demand that all Arab States break off with 
West Germany. Humiliation of Israel-West 
Germany diplomatic exchange may mean 
some weakening of Nasser's personal domi-
nance in Arab world. 
'Israel: Gained diplomatic recognition from 
West Germany, which she has always wanted. 
Lost out on delivery of $16 million in arms?
but she may get this anyway, when the Mid-
east pot simmers down a bit. 
United States: Gained bad case of jitters 
for fear Egypt-Israel-German triangle might 
lead to Arab-Israel war with desert water 
as the excuse. Breathing a bit easier now 
but still keeping oxygen tent handy. 
East Germany: The real winner. For a 
measly $100 million in credits to Egypt, East 
Germany is on verge of breaking out of her 
-isolation and getting recognition of half 
dozen Arab States; other nations may follow 
suit in recognizing Moscow puppet regime. 
[From the London Times, Mar. 3, 1965] 
ISRAEL REFUSES TO RENOUNCE USE OE' ARMED 
FORCE?NO AGREEMENT IN TALKS WITH 
UNITED STATES 
Talks between the United States and Israel 
here have ended disappointingly, and all that 
Mr. Averell Harriman, President Johnson's 
special envoy, could say this morning as he 
flew to Kabul was: "The Government of Israel 
Is fully aware of the views of the U.S. Govern-
ment, and I am now able to report to the 
President on the view of the Government of 
Israel." 
The divergence of views was principally 
over an American demand that the Eshkol 
government renounce the use or the threat 
of military action to deter the Arabs from 
diverting the sources of the Jordan River ris-
ing in Lebanon and Syria before they reach 
the intake of the Israel national water car-
rier. The Americans claim they cannot meet 
Israel's demands for direct and overt military 
supplies in an atmosphere inflamed by Is-
rael's implied threats of war. 
Mr. Harriman's nebulous statement and the 
failure of an expected joint statement to ma-
terialize demonstrated that the 5 days of 
talks ended without agreement. Negotiations 
are being continued by diplomatic channels. 
SUGGESTION DERIDED 
The Americans are inclined to concede that 
if West Germany indeed reneges on her un-
dertakings to deliver American-made tanks, 
and if Soviet arms shipments to Egypt upset 
the arms balance, circumstances will have 
been created which permit the United States 
to become Israel's supplier of defensive weap-
ons. However, they attach requirements, in-
cluding assurances that American arms 
should not jeopardize the security of her pro-
Western Arab neighbors, Jordan and Leba-
non. The United States is also arming Jor-
dan and Saudi Arabia and wants Israel to 
show understanding of her position. 
The American argument that the Arab 
river diversions may be for local irrigation 
purposes within the framework of the Amer-
ican-sponsored regional plan for the division 
of the waters is derided here and Mr. Eshkol 
is reported to have firmly rejected the sug-
gestion that Israel undertake not to react 
until the Arab diversions exceed their al-
lotted quotas. 
The U.S. advice to Israel to rely less on her 
own might, bluff, and bluster and more on 
American diplomatic assurances has also been 
poorly received; American diplomatic support 
of Israel's case has not ended the Egyptian 
blockade of Israel shipping by -the Suez 
Canal. Nor is the proposal that the Security 
Council adjudicate considered practical here 
in view of the systematic veto of any pro-
Israel resolution by the Soviet Union. 
NEW WEAPONS 
The Syrians have begun work near Banias 
Springs at a slow pace and the Lebanese have 
not started at all. Opinion here is that the 
Arabs may be dragging their feet in order to 
adjust the timing of the completion of the 
project to coincide with the completion of 
military preparations, including the return of 
Egyptian troops now pinned down in Yemen, 
the strengthening of the Jordan and Leba-
nese armies and Egypt's absorption of new

UNITED STATES To WEIGH SALE OF ARMS TO 
ISRAEL?HIGH-LEVEL TALKS EXPECTED 
SOON?WASHFNGTON POLICY IS APPARENTLY 
Slum:NG 
(By John W. Finney) 
WASHINGTON, March 3.--The United States, 
seemingly modifying its Middle East arms 
policy, has agreed to discuss with Israel the 
possibility of supplying American weapons 
to offset Soviet arms shipments to Arab 
States. 
High-ranking Israeli officials including pos-
sibly Foreign Minister Golda Meer, are ex-
pected here shortly, according to diplomatic 
souroee to discuss the purchase of American 
RIMS. 
The discussions will be an Outgrowth of 
talks that Ambassador at Large W. Averell 
Harriman had during the last week with Is-
raeli officials in Tel Aviv. Since Mr. Hard-
man's departure from Israel on Monday, some 
State Department and White House advisers 
have remained behind in Tel Aviv to continue 
the talks, which will lay the basis for the 
higher level discussions here within the next 
few weeks. 
A TACTT ACCEPTANCE 
Ostensibly the Harriman mission was 
prompted by the diplomatic and military 
confusion brought about by West Germany's 
termination of its $80 million arms deal with 
Israel. But the talks went far beyond the 
Immediate problems created by Bonn's action 
and included the more coanplicated issue of 
how to provide Israel with an assured supply 
of modern arms in the coming years. 
According to diplomatic sources, there was 
at least a tacit acceptance by Mr. Harriman 
of a contention by Israel that the cutoff of 
the West German arms shipments pointed 
up Israel's need to find new sources of weap-
ons to maintain a military balance with the 
Arab States. 
Mr. Harriman was reported to have ex-
pressed concern about possible Israel mili-
tary intervention if some of the Arab States 
went ahead with plans for diverting the 
headwaters of the Jordan River. 
Mr. Harriman, however, was said not to 
have laid down any condition of noninter-
vention as a prerequisite for Israel's obtain-
ing American military assistance. The Is-
rael officials, in turn, were said to have 
made it clear that they viewed the arms race 
and the Jordan River problem as separate 
issues. 
The problem to be discussed in the forth-
coming talks transcends immediate Israel 
demands for the arms undelivered by West 
Germany. Bonn responding to threats by the 
United Arab Republic to recognize East Ger-
many, terminated the arms shipments when 
80 percent completed. Among the weapons 
undelivered were some American-made 11-48 
tanks that West Germany was shipping to 
Israel with the U.S. approval and encourage-
ment. ' 
ASSURED SUPPLY SOUGHT 
While the Israelis made it clear that they 
wanted the undelivered arms, they also em-
phasized that a more important considera-
tion was finding an assured source of weap-
ons over the next sevei.al years to counter 
continuing Soviet arms shipments to the 
United Arab Republic and other Arab States. 
This is raising for the Johnson administra-
tion the difficult question whether the United 
States is willing to modify or abandon its 
policy of not being a direct supplier of arms 
to Israel. 
The United States has provided limited 
amounts of arms to certain Arab States, such 
as tanks to Jordan and jet fighters to Saudi 
Arabia. The State Department confirmed 
today that the United States was discussing 
with Jordan a "general request" for arms 
but refused to comment on the details. 
Largely because of a desire not to alienate 
the Arab nations, the United States has con-
sistently refused to supply arms to Israel. 
The lone exception occurred 2 years ago 
when the United States agreed to sell Israel 
some Hawk antiaircraft missiles on the 
ground they were purely defensive weapons. 
The administration's position has been 
that Israel should look to Western European 
sources for her arms, and at times, as in the 
West German deal. Washington has coop-
erated behind the scenes in obtaining Euro-
pean weapons for Israel. With the diplo-
matic difficulties encountered by West Ger-
many in its arms deal, Israel obviously is go-
ing to have increasing difficulty in obtaining 
arms in Europe and therefore is turning to 
the United States. 
The State Department was maintaining 
strict secrecy about the overtures from Israel. 
llut the fact that the administration was 
willing to discuss arms purchases with Israel 
officials was an indication that the United 
States was moving away from its past policy. 
While refusing to comment on the Israel 
situation in particular, a Department spokes-
man said the administration's policy in gen-
eral in the Middle East was in "seeing a bal-
ance is maintained" in armaments. - 
The general appraisal of American officials 
Is that Israel currently has a military balance 
with, if not superiority over, her Arab neigh-
bors. The contention being advanced by 
Israel and generally accepted by American 
officials, however, is that this balance is likely 
to be upset in the next few years by con-
tinuing Soviet arms shipments to Arab na-
tions, especially the United Arab Republic.

"MAN AND FOOD"?ADDRESS BY 
VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY 
Mr. MONDALE. Mr. President, Vice 
President HusraT HUMPHREY recently 
Presented to the National Farmers Un-
ion Convention an address entitled "Man 
and Food." In the course of that ad-
dress, the distinguished Vice President 
delivered one of the most comprehensive 
and commendable statements on Amer-
ican farm policy made by the present ad-
ministration. 
The Vice President is not content to 
extol the blessings which have provided 
America with the greatest agricultural 
ability and abundance in the history of 
mankind, nor is he content to extol the 
virtue of our extension of the hand that 
helps the less developed nations of the 
world where hunger is a constant com-
panion and the dry wellspring of hope 
"Man and Food" is a brilliant statement, 
not alone of where American agriculture 
has been, but of where it is going; not 
alone of the contributions which agricul-
ture has made to our own and to several 
nations of the world, but of the unlimited 
horizon looming before agriculture in a 
world of burgeoning population, increas-
ing urbanization, and rapid mechaniza-
tion. 
"Man and Food" promises, above al. 
else, hope to the man who has given so 
much to the hopeless and hungry of the 
world?the small farmer. "Man and 
Food" declares in unmistakable terms 
this administration's determination to 
lift the haze of impending economic dis-
aster which has begun to hang heavily 
and ominously over the rural commu-
nity. 
I welcome "Man and Food" as one of 
the finest farm statements of recent 
Years. I commend it to the attention of 
my distinguished colleagues, and re-
quest unanimous consent that it be 
printed at this point in the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD. 
There being no objection, the address 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
MAN AND FOOD 
(Speech by Vice President HOSERT H. 
HUMPHREY at the National Farmers Union 
Convention, Mar. 15, 1965) 
I have looked forward to this meeting for 
some time. It is an opportunity for me to 
renew old friendships, to relive old and happy 
experiences, and to learn from the men and 
women of America's farms. 
I also want to pay tribute to you who are 
providing leadership in the creation of an 
efficient and productive agriculture. This is 
basic to the security and strength of this 
Nation?and to the free world. 
This land is blessed among all others, and 
you help to make it so. 
Here there has been developed the most 
efficient agricultural plant in all history, and 
you help to make it so. 
Our great agricultural capabilities have 
abolished for us the twin fears of hunger and 
famine, and you help to make it so. 
The day when the soil was mined, water 
taken for granted, and the forests were 
despoiled, is past. Exploitation of the soil 
has yielded to conservation. The people now 
know how to take care of nature's bounty, 
and you help to make it so. 
The American consumer now is enjoying 
food at the lowest cost of any people in the 
world in terms of human effort expendec., 
and you help to make it so. 
The miracle of American agricultural 
efficiency is leaving its imprint in every area 
of the world, and you help to make it so. 
We now are exporting at a $6 billion annual 
rate and you help to make it so. 
Agriculture is our greatest dollar earner ti 
foreign trade today, and you help to make it 
SO. 
Food is power. Abundance?and the 
ability to produce abundance?is one of our 
most valuable assets of strength in the world 
today. 
Without that asset, our entire economy 
would be crippled. Without that asset, we 
could not have moved tremendous quantities 
of food and fiber under the food for peace

"I'm Joe so-and-so with such-and-such 
a company; who are you?" the lobbyist said 
ode day to a youthful-looking house mem-
ber. 
"I'm Bob Traxler, Democratic floor leader 
in the house," replied Representative J. Rob-
ert Traxler, 33, of Bay City. "Where the 
devil have you been the last 2 years?" 
The preponderance of freshmen in a set-
ting where votes spell power has a few times 
inspired words of rebellion against party 
leaders, especially after sundown and a few 
draughts of heady cheer. 
It's anybody's guess whether a weighty 
or emotional issue?perhaps an income tax, 
mental health spending, Romney's politick-
ing, or some touchy minor issue?might sucl-
lenly fan smoldering coals into flames of 
Insurrection. 
Nobody is betting now that this will hap-
pen. And if revolt broke out, it likely would 
Se short lived. 
One significant alteration already well be-
gun would have met stern resistance from 
3stablished order a few years ago. 
This was the decision of the new house 
Lpeaker, Representative Joseph Kowalski, of 
Detroit, and other Democratic leaders to re-
Lhape the legislature's Operation with Con-
gress as a model. 
First, this means rejection of the "public 
ounge" aspect of the legislation as a kind of 
wersized two-room schoolhouse on parents' 
In this setting, lawmakers were arranged 
nueh of the time in neat rows, making con-
renient targets for hovering lobbyists and 
Ether pressure-generators, with only a few 
:ommittee rooms and lavatories as handy 
daces of refuge. 
The new regime set wheels turning to give 
ach senate and house member a respectable 
:if-the-floor operating base and some pre-
enso to privacy. 
Each soon will have his own desk, tele-
>hone, flung cabinet and reasonable access to 
tenographic service--and in tasteful and 
:heery surroundings. 
This meant a flushing out of bureaucrats 
rom cluttered and usually dingy quarters on 
Lhree floors of the capitol. It required 
oughly a quarter-million dollars in painting, 
:arpeting, wiring, new furnishings and car-
>entry. 
Legislative officers and Lt. Gov. William G. 
vlilliken got private suites. Romney likewise 
vas emancipated from cramped quarters that 
save shackled Governors since the adminis-
ration 40 years ago of Alex Groesbeck, who 
n less complicated times got along with a 
taff of five. 
Since mid-March Romney's 29 aids and 
ilerical helpers have enjoyed just about 
louble the square footage formerly occu-
Aed?excluding windowless balcony space 
irst used by Governor Williams and some-
Limes called "the black hole." 
The new capitol layout, unsurprising to 
nost visitors, has evoked gasps from some 
xlegislators who were accustomed to getting 
iostage stamps doled out a few at a time and 
vaiting days to have a few letters typed. 
Legislators' new off-the-floor hide-outs also 
cake it tougher for the 200-odd registered 
obbyists to track them down. 
Strict new rules barring lobbyists from the 
Louse and senate chambers for considerable 
eriods have relieved lawmakers of some of 
he gauntlet-running ordeal they used to face 
adjoining corridors. 
To stop a bill in committee is no longer 
ae shooting-fish-in-the-barrel exercise it 
as said to be for certain of the capitol's 
Lost seasoned and talented lobbyists. 
In other moves that reflect patterns in 
>ngress, the house majority has set up a 
alley committee, beefed up the house staff 
v about 50 percent (92 employees compared 
ith 60 a few years ago) and sought to 
No. 71 8 
strengthen research, analysis, public rela-
tions, bill drafting, and other services. 
Don Hoenshell, a veteran Detroit and 
Lansing newsman, Nvas hired at $17,500 a 
year to energize this operation through a 
greatly enlarged and revitalized legislative 
service bureau. 
Under the new constitution, the legisla-
ture now directs a legislative auditing unit. 
This new watchdog agency in time might 
function like the General Accounting Office 
of Congress. 
There is evidence that lawmakers more and, 
more think of carving out legislative careers 
comparable to those of veterans in congress. 
A surprising sign of the time, and a prob-
able herald of the future, is the description 
of 19 house members as professional legis-
lators in biographies submitted to the house 
clerk. It was almost unheard of before. 
The phenomenon assuredly reflects the 
higher pay and richer pension prospects. 
But likely even more, it represents a provi-
sion in the 1963 constitution that prevents 
State legislators from clinging to jobs they 
formerly doubled at in township, county, or 
city governments. 
Legislative internes, young college grad-
uates paid 50 percent by Ford Foundation 
grants and assigned to assist house and sen-
ate leaders, are another fresh element in the 
legislative scene. ? 
As for the infusion of youth in lawmaker 
ranks, the key factor is the $12,500 salary and 
expense allowance. A young man' on the 
way up?lawyers, particularly?now can af-
ford the valuable experience of legislative 
service without crippling financial penalty. 
The average age in the senate is down to 
43.6 years from the 55 average of 1959-60, 
with 15 of the 37 senators in their thirties, 
12 more in their forties, and only 4 beyond 
60. Five years ago 5 of the then 34 senators 
were past 70 and 11 others beyond GO. Only 
were under 40. 
Fred I. Chase, who retired recently after 
more than four decades as senate secretary, 
recalled that "in the old days serving in the 
legislature was mostly an honorary position." 
"We had bank presidents, retired judges 
and others with substantial incomes," he 
said. "I can recall seeing senators match 
quarters for each other's paychecks. The 
$3-a-day salary then didn't amount to a spit 
in your eye for those fellows." 
After the composition of the legislature 
began to change materially in the 1950's, the 
money-grind exacted a painful price of 
many lawmakers, especially those from the 
faraway Upper Peninsula, 
Many a veteran remembers the stringencies 
of the deadlocked 1959 legislature that met 
from January until nearly Christmas. That 
was when the overall pay was at $5,000. 
"I had to borrow $2,000 to make ends meet 
that year," said Representative F. Charles 
Raap, Democrat, of Muskegon, a machine 
operator at Continental Motors Corp. with 
three children. "It took me 2 years to pay it 
back." 
"We voted a pay increase (to $6,250 a year) 
at the end of the session and I was defeated 
for reelection," Raap said. "Considering my 
debts then, it probably was a blessing in 
disguise." 
At the higher pay level, Raap expects to 
devote full time to legislative work, concen-
trating on mental health as chairman of 
the House Mental Health Committee. 
Many other legislators see their office as 
becoming a year-round job. 
Representative Russell H. Strange, Repub-
lican, of Mount Pleasant, said interest in 
Lansing activities was more and more a full-
time * * * on the upswing among his con-
stituents. He said he was getting more mail 
than ever in his 9 years in the House, more 
calls at home and more invitations to speak 
in his district. 
"Part of it," he said, "is because State gov-
ernment is entering into peoples' lives more 
than ever before." 
Traxler, among others, foresees lengthen-
ing sessions from the 4-to-5 months meet-
ings of the past attuned to the seasonal 
rhythms of the farm. 
"I think we'll be for practical purposes 
a year-round legislature before long," he 
said. "Eight months, rather than 5, will be 
the usual thing." 
THE UNITED STATES AND A LATIN 
AMERICAN COMMON MARKET 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, a few 
days ago the presidents of all Latin 
American nations received a 30-page re-
port proposing the establishment of a 
Latin American Common Market. The 
report was prepared by Dr. Carlos Santa-
maria, Chairman of the Inter-American 
Committee for the Alliance for Progress; 
Dr. Felipe Herrera, President of the 
Inter-American Development Bank; 
Jose Mayobre, Executive Director of the 
United Nations Economic Commission 
for Latin America; and Raul Prebisch, 
Secretary General of the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development. 
The fact that this proposal has been 
made by four distinguished leaders of 
Inter-American thought is highly signifi-
cant, but the support of public opinion 
and political support at the highest levels 
in Latin America are greatly needed. 
I strongly urge the political leaders of 
the hemisphere to translate this idea of a 
"Latin American Common Market into 
the reality of a mass market of some 220 
million people, with a combined gross 
national product of between $70 and $80 
billion. 
It is also appropriate, however, to re-
mind all those working toward this in-
estimable goal that hemispheric unity is 
vital to its success, and that provisions 
must be made for the eventual inclusion 
in such a market of the United States 
and Canada, the largest markets of all. 
There is no place in the Americas for any 
exclusive concept of the economic unifi-
cation of the hemisphere. Without North 
America, success of such a venture is 
dubious, at best. But there is no need to 
court failure, as public opinion in North 
America is very sympathetic to these 
ideas. 
To those of our neighbors in Latin 
America who see their course as being 
economic unification of Latin America 
alone, which would then do business with 
Europe and North America as potential 
competitors, one with the other, it should 
be pointed out that this arrangement will 
not provide the best opportunity for suc-
cess for any of the parties involved. The 
economic unity of the Americas is the 
logical course; and it should be broad-
ened to include Canada, bringing it into 
full association with Latin America, to 
assure that the experience of the Euro-
pean Common Market is paralleled, so 
as to give the greatest strength eco-
nomically to all the Americas, and make 
it as greatly an improved trading part-
ner for Europe as the EEC has proved 
to be to itself and the rest of the world. 
Accordingly, the Latin American Com-
mon Market proposed in today's report

should be the first step toward the ulti-
mate objective of a Western Hemisphere 
free trade area, aiding the growth of the 
private sector in the constitutional Re-
publics of the Americas, and maintaining 
a place for Cuba, when that nation again 
becomes free and democratic. 
I ask Unanimous consent that an edi-
torial published in today's New York 
Times which deals with the same point 
be printed in the RECORD at the conclu-
sion of my remarks. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Apr, 22, 19651 
LATIN COMMON MARKET? 
Latin America is being urged to give im-
mediate consideration to a bold concept?a 
continental common market. An integra-
tion plan has been drawn up by four of Latin 
America's most distinguished economists. 
They ask each government to approve estab-
lishment of a Latin American parliaraent and 
of an "institutional mechanism" for an eco-
nomic union. 
Their proposals go far beyond the vague 
desire for a common market expressed in 
the charter of the Alliance for Progress. 
They have revived in new and realistic form 
the old dream of unifying the continent 
that had possessed Simon Bolivar. Latin 
America's four "wise men" have drawn up a 
program that includes a timetable for lower-
ing tariffs and plans for industrial coopera-
tion and for a payments union. 
This program is based on the plan adopted 
and carried out with such success by the Eu-
ropean Economic Community. Its authors 
are under no illusion that a Latin American 
Common Market can proceed at anything like 
the same pace or produce as significant re-
sults; but they are confident that it is possi-
ble to find workable solutions and that the 
Important thing is to make a start. 
At this stage the planners are seeking the 
participation of neither the United States 
nor other industrial nations. They think it 
essential that Latin America take the first 
Steps on its own, recognizing that it will 
require spirit and enthusiasm as well as 
sound policies to surmount the obstacles of 
integration. Indeed, progress toward eco-
nomic union depends on first overcoming 
the inertia and the opposition of vested in-
terests that have kept the countries of Latin 
America in watertight compartments. 
While the United States is not directly 
involved, it can still make a contribution by 
encouraging the efforts of the planners. 
They need Washington's support?material 
and moral?in helping make their dream 
come true.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMMIT-
MENT'S IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I invite 
the attention of Senators to two editori-
als, one from the Nashville Tennessean 
and the other from the Philadelphia In-
quirer. I believe that these editorials are 
very much worth bringing to the atten-
tion of a wider circle of those interested 
In our responsibilities and commitments 
in southeast Asia. 
There being no objection, the edito-
rials were ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Nashville Tennessean, 
Apr. 13, 19651 
PRESIDENT'S ASIA PLAN May BRING RESULTS 
Mgr 
North Vietnam, in abnormally bitter lan-
guage, has rejected President Johnson's offer 
to enter into unconditional discussions to 
end the fighting in South Vietnam. 
The Communist regime's official newspa-
per in Hanoi reacted to the President's pro-
posal with one of the most abusive attacks 
against Mr. Johnson and this country that 
have yet come out of the Communist propa-
ganda mill. 
The intensity of the attack suggests that 
the President's proposal for a development 
program for southeast Asia might have re-
ceived a more favorable response in that 
region than the Communists care to admit. 
Any proposal that raises the hope of peace 
and more abundant living in an area that 
has been torn by war for many years is 
bound to attract some wishful attention, 
even among the weary Vietcong. 
Thus it is not surprising that Mr. John-
son's proposal should be met by a Com-
munist propaganda attack of unprecedented 
bitterness. Only by a twisted verbal assault 
can the Communist leaders in South Viet-
nam sell Mr. Johnson's peace proposal as 
insincere and as a toast to peace that 
"smells of poison gas." Only by misrepre-
senting what the President said can the Reds 
make a genuine aid program, "bait" offered 
by "stupid pirates." 
There are dangers for the United States in 
Vietnam. But the reaction to the President's 
speech?violent in tone, as it was?isn't nec-
essarily dangerous. It makes it clear that 
Mr. Johnson's ideas and alternatives to war 
carried some appeal for southeast Asia. 
That is why the Communist response was 
so severe. 
Hanoi's rejection statement should not be 
taken as all bluff. The tenseness of the 
situation in southeast Asia has not dimin-
ished. But neither does the tough state-
ment rule out any possibility of future peace 
talks on terms acceptable to this country. 
The State Department, while declaring 
that President Johnson's offer of peace talks 
will be kept "on the table," pointedly noted 
that Hanoi's statement, although harshly 
worked, was not a rejection Of anything. 
It may be significant that Hanoi has not 
yet responded to an appeal by 17 nonalined 
nations for a start on peace talks without 
preconditions. 
If and when Hanoi is ready to talk about 
peace in Vietnam, the Communist leaders 
obviously would prefer that the negotiations 
grew out of the 17-nation proposal, in-
stead of appearing to result directly from any 
move on the part of the United States, or 
any suggestion by President Johnson. 
For the present the United States is on the 
initiative. President Johnson has offered to 
talk peace. At the same time bombing at-
tacks continue in the North. The principal 
problem that remains is whether Hanoi is 
really desirous of peace. For the present it 
seems that only increasing pressure by Amer-
ican planes and South Vietnamese fighters 
can determine that. 
[From the Philadelphia Inquirer, 
Apr. 19, 1965] 
OUTRAGE OVER VIETNAM 
President Johnson's Easter reiteration of 
America's willingness to start Vietnamese 
peace talks at once and without preconditions i 
was remarkable n many respects. It was a 
moving and thoughtful summation of the 
tragic situation. 
But one aspect of the statement seemed to 
us of special significance under the circum-
stances?a weekend that saw Moscow threat-
ening (again) to send "volunteers" and 
thousands of U.S. students milling around 
the vacant White House, probably well in-
tentioned but offering their country no more 
useful advice than to turntail and run, 
leaving millions of Vietnamese to merciless 
exploitation by communism. 
The President said: 
"I understand the feelings of those 
regret that we must undertake air attack; 
share those feelings. 
"But the compassion of this country, 
the world, must go out to the men and 
men and children who are killed and cript 
by the Vietcong every day in South Vista 
"The outrage of this country, and 
world, must be visited on those who explc 
their bombs in cities and villages, rip' 
the bodies of the helpless * * *" 
It is probably worth noting that the in 
Moscow declaration was elaborately 'lei:

be sent "if" the U.S. "aggression" inteisi 
"if" it proved a "necessity," and "if" an 
peal from North Vietnam were received. 
Soviets do not appear to be anxious to sp 
the conflagration, and there is alanni 
reason. They know what an all-out wa 
their own soil is like. They had one, pe 
trated by Adolf Hitler. 
And if, even in Moscow, the Presidi 
calm and rational approach to the Viet 
Impasse is having some effect, it can at 
be hoped that it also is reducing thc t 
for conquest in Hanoi and Peiping. 
For it is plain enough, to those whi 
not delude themselves, that this "dirty I 
war" of terror by night in the rice par 
is one started by Communists and w 
must be stopped by Communists. The P 
dent is doing everything possible from 
side, unhelped by thousands of misle'i j 
nile underminers who, in another age rr 
have "done business with Hitler," and hi 
serves America's gratitude and support 
A redirection of loudly vocal "ontr 
over Vietnam to the proper object, the bl 
pajama mob in the jungle, led and lo 
by the Communists, would be a proper 
step.

separately functioning, independently oper-
ated judicial organization. 
In 1958, the board of supervisors in Im-
perial County, at the request of Judge Elmer 
W. Heald, supported by the bar and civic 
organizations, appropriated sufficient funds 
to employ a marriage counselor and a cleri-
cal staff. The counselor came to Los An-
geles and studied our procedures for several 
weeks before actually commencing the con-
ciliation court operations. 
The program immediately proved success-
ful. In fact, so successful that the board 
of supervisors had a bill introduced at the 
1959 session of the legislature to make the 
conciliation court permanent. 
Since 1958 seven counties in California 
have established conciliation courts?Imper-
ial, San Mateo, San Bernardino, Sacramento, 
San Diego, Alameda, and most recently, San 
Luis Obispo. Three Western States?Arizo-
na, Montana, and Oregon?have passed con-
ciliation court acts modeled on the Cali-
fornia act, and all have successfully operat-
ing conciliation courts in major cities. The 
counselors for these new courts have spent 
several weeks in an indoctrination course in 
Los Angeles in order that procedures are 
uniform. An annual conference of concilia-
tion courts, attended by judges and mar-
riage counselors, was first held in 1963 and 
has become an annual event. 
I know there are those synical souls who 
will deprecate the court engaging in such 
activities and will brush off the importance 
of reconciling couples with the customary 
defeatist expression, "So what?"; but the 
18,000 children in Los Angeles County who 
have been restored to their parents in a 
united home during the past 7 years bear 
eloquent witness to the importance of the 
court of conciliation. 
Today the legal profession and the ju-
diciary have expressed the belief, through 
their official organizations, that the cus-
tomary adversary nature and proceedings of 
the ordinary civil law suit be reduced to a 
minimum in domestic relations matters. 
Conciliation court proceedings are by nature 
non-adversary, and every reconciled couple 
is an enthusiastic booster for the Court and 
the legal profession. Even couples who are 
not reconciled are appreciative of the con-
ciliation court's contributions toward amica-
bly solving controversial questions of cus-
? tody visitation rights, and even in settling 
property rights which are incorporated in a 
property settlement agreement. 
It is an interesting commentary that dur-
ing the past 7 years it has been the legal 
profession in other California counties and 
States that has spearheaded the movement 
to create a conciliation court. 
However, what is most gratifying, reward-
ing, and indicative of the real success of 
conciliation court proceedings is exempli-
fied in the thousands of letters we receive 
from reconciled couples who report to us 1 
year after their reconciliation. Let me con-
clude by reading you' a typical letter taken 
from our files: 
"We are happy to report on this first anni-
versary of our visit to your conciliation court 
that we are happily together with our three 
children. Each of us has done his best to 
keep the promises we made in the wonder-
ful reconciliation agreement we both signed. 
"We shudder to think of what untold un-
happiness would have befallen each of us 
and our lovely children had we followed the 
line of least resistance with a Judge eventu-
ally uttering the fateful words, 'Divorce 
granted.'" 
THE MESS IN&i Ir X 
Mr. GRUENING. Went, it is 
becoming increasingly evident that, with 
respect to the undeclared war in Viet-
nam, the war himlis advising the Pres-
ident are desperately seeking not only 
? to change the future course of history to 
one of unbelievable carnage and destruc-
tion but are also seeking to rewrite the 
immutable facts of the historical past. 
In a totalitarian nation such as the 
Soviet Union it is fairly easy?at least 
within the confines of its own borders?
to play at "make as though it never was" 
by chiseling off the names of former 
leaders from public edifices, b'y obliterat-
ing the tombs of those leaders, and by 
rewriting history books so that it appears 
as though those leaders never existed. 
In a democracy such as ours, which 
zealously guards its hard-won freedoms 
of speech and press, that same game 
cannot be played as easily or as success-
fully. 
But it can be tried. 
And, with respect to the facts on our 
involvement in Vietnam, it has been and 
is being tried. 
This was cogently pointed out by the 
noted columnist, Mr. Walter Lippmann, 
in his column in the Washington Post on 
April 20, 1965, entitled "Unbuttoned 
Diplomacy." Said Mr. Lippmann, in 
part: 
A cardinal weakness of our diplomatic 
position today is the President's statement at 
Baltimore that "the first reality is that North 
Vietnam has attacked the independent na-
tion of South Vietnam." This was not our 
original position. It has been called the 
first reality only in the most recent phase 
of the war, the phase which began in Febru-
ary. Our present position is contrary to the 
indubitable essentials of the Geneva Agree-
ments of 1954, that North and South Viet-
nam are not two nations but two zones of 
one nation. 
This attempt to rewrite history was 
also pointed out vividly by Hans J. 
Morganthau, Michelson Distinguished 
Service professor of political science and 
modern historS7 at the University of 
Chicago, in a brilliant article in the New 
York Times on April 18, 1965, entitled 
"We Are Deluding Ourselves in Viet-
nam." Professor Morgenthau, who also 
serves as consultant to the State and 
Defense Departments, states in part: 
Until the end of last February, the Gov-
ernment of the United States started from 
the assumption that the war in South Viet-
nam was a civil war, aided and abetted?but 
not created?from abroad, and spokesmen 
for the Government have made time and 
again the point that the key to winning 
the war was political and not military and 
was to be found in South Vietnam itself. 
It was supposed to lie in transforming the 
indifference or hostility of the great mass of 
the South Vietnamese people into positive 
loyalty to the government * * *. 
The United States has recognized that it is 
failing in South Vietnam. But it has drawn 
from this recognition of failure a most 
astounding conclusion. 
The United States has decided to change 
the character of the war by unilateral decla-
ration from a South Vietnamese civil war to 
a war of foreign aggression. Aggression from 
the north: "The Record of North Vietnam's 
Campaign To Conquer South Vietnam" is the 
title of a white paper published by the De-
partment of State on the last day of February 
1965. While normally foreign and military 
policy is based upon intelligence?that is, the 
objective assessment of facts?the process is 
here reversed: A new policy has been decided 
upon, and intelligence must provide the facts 
to justify it. 
The United States, stymied in South Viet-
nam and on the verge of defeat, decided to 
carry the war to North Vietnam not so 
much in order to retrieve the fortunes of 
war as to lay the groundwork for "negotia-
tions from strength." In order to justify the 
new policy, it was necessary to prove that 
North Vietnam is the real enemy. It is the 
white paper's purpose to present that proof. 
My able and distinguished colleague 
from Idaho [Mr. CHURCH], in a penetrat-
ing article in the Saturday Evening Post 
for April 24, 1965, entitled "We Should 
Negotiate a Settlement in Vietnam" also 
commented on the "double think" proc-
ess of the war hawks in attempting to 
change the character of our involvement 
in Vietnam by characterizing events in a 
manner contrary to the facts: Senator 
CHURCH states ? in part: 
We only deceive ourselves when we pre-
tend that the struggle in Vietnam is not a 
civil war. The two parts of Vietnam don't 
represent two different peoples, with separate 
identities. Vietnam is a partitioned country 
in the grip of a continuing revolution. That 
the Government of North Vietnam has deeply 
involved itself in support, or even direction, 
of the rebellion the South doesn't make the 
war any less a civil war. The fighting is still 
between Vietnamese. The issue is still that 
of determining what groups of Vietnamese 
shall govern the country. 
Given freedom of speech and press, the 
true facts will ultimately reach the peo-
ple. 
Two excellent books, recently pub-
lished, by two Pulitzer Prize winning au-
thors seek to set the record straight on 
the events in Vietnam which have led 
the United States to the dangerous crisis 
It now confronts. 
The first book, by Malcolmn M. 
Browne, is entitled "The New Face of 
War" and is published by Bobbs-Merrill. 
The second book, by David Halber-
stram, is entitled "The Making of a 
Quagmire" is published by Random 
House. 
Both books should be required reading 
for all those who wish to acquire the 
requisite background to understand the 
fast-moving events in Vietnam. 
The noted writer, I. F. Stone, writing 
in the New York Review for April 22, 
1965, reviewed both these books in an 
article showing his clear grasp of events 
in southeast Asia. As part of his review, 
Mr. Stone stated: 
What makes these books so timely, their 
message so urgent, is that they show the 
Vietnamese war in that aspect which is most 
fundamental for our own people?as a chal-
lenge to freedom of information and there-
fore freedom of decision. They appear at a 
time when all the errors on which they throw 
light are being intensified. Instead of cor-
recting policy in the light of the record, the 
light itself is being shut down. Access to 
news sources in Vietnam and in Washington 
is being limited, censorship in the field is 
becoming more severe. Diem is dead but 
what might be termed Diemism has become 
the basic policy of the American Govern-
ment, For years our best advisers, military 
and civilian, tried desperately to make him 
understand that the war was a political 
problem which could only be solved in South 
Vietnam. 
More and more people in the United 
States are beginning to be aware that 
the facts of history are immutable and 
cannot be changed to suit the purposes 
of any nation?big or small.

ing's New York Times the case is made

8004 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE April 22,,j 965 
for the "Descalation" of the war in Viet-
nam. 
Just as our able and distinguished ma-
jority leader [Mr. MANSFIELD] yesterday 
stated that the time had come for "some 
blunt words on Vietnam," the New York 
Times calls upon the people of the United 
States to face the true facts. The edi-
torial states in part: 
Nothing is more important for Americans 
today than to face these hard truths before 
It is too late. And it is vital that the chan-
nels of communication, of opinion, and of 
dissent be kept open?on the floor of Con-
gress, in the press, in the country at large--
in the face of a growing tendency to ridicule 
or to denounce the opposition and to demand 
unswerving support of further escalation in 
the name of patriotism. 
Bitterness and emotionalism are increas-
ingly entering the discussions on Vietnam in 
the United States. This is a deplorable de-
velOprnent, and so is the polarization of 
opinion in every country and between blocs 
of countries, It is as if the battlelines were 
being drawn all over the world?but for a 
major war that need not and must not take 
place. 
In the same vein, Mr. Arthur Krock in 
today's New York Times stated that "the 
Senate today responsibly fulfilled the role 
assigned to it by the Constitution to 'ad-
vise' the President on foreign affairs." 
That discussion on the U.S. dilemma in 
Vietnam must continue not only on the 
floor of the Senate but throughout the 
country. 
That dilemma was underscored by 
Walter Lippmann in his column in this 
morning's Washington Post when he 
said: 
In my view the President is in grave 
trouble. He is in grave trouble because he 
haw not taken to heart the historic fact that 
the-role of the Western white man as a ruler 
in Asia was ended forever in the Second 
World War. Against the Japanese the 
Western white powers were unable to defend 
their colonies and protectorates in Asia. 
That put an end to the white man's domi-
nation in Asia which had begun in the 15th 
century. 
Mr. Lippmann then proceeded to de-
molish the Secretary of State Dulles' SO-
called domino theory by pointing out 
that escalation of the war in Vietnam 
has brought about a falling of the domi-
noes?but a falling away of the dominoes 
from support of the U.S. position. 
/t is time for the war hawks advising 
thr President to change their ostrichlike 
heads in the sand postures and face the 
facts as they really are, rather than what 
they would like them to be or to have 
been. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ar-
ticle by Walter Lippmann appearing in 
the Washington Post of Tuesday, April 
20, 1965, entitled "Unbuttoned Diplo-
macy," the article in the New York Times 
,of Sunday, April 18, 1965, by Hans J. 
Morganthau, entitled "We Are Deluding 
Ourselves in Vietnam," the article by

and the article appearing in the Wash-
ington Post of Thursday, April 22, 1965, 
by Walter Lippmann, entitled "The Fall-
ing Dominoes," be inserted in the RECORD 
at this point. 
There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Apr. 20, 
1965] 
IhnurrroNED Drerossamr 
(By Walter Lippmann) 
In the wake of President Johnson's Bal-
timore speech of April 7 and of the appeal 
of the 17 unalined countries, which pre-
ceded it by about a week, discussions look-
ing toward an eventually negotiated settle-
ment have actually been underway. Some 
of the discussion has been public and has 
consisted of exchanges of statements by 
Washington and Hanoi; some of the dis-
cussion is private through the various inter-
mediaries who are concerned to prevent the 
spread of the war. 
A curious, yet important, fact about the 
public discussion is that Washington and 
Hanoi start from the same legal basis. The 
President on March 25 declared that "we 
seek no more than a return to the essentials 
of the (Geneva) agreements of 1954." On 
April 13 Premier Pham Van Dong of North 
Vietnam made a policy declaration which 
said that Hanoi's fundamental war aim is the 
carrying out of the Geneva Agreements of 
1954. 
If both sides were in fact prepared to abide 
by and to enforce the Geneva agreements, a 
strong legal basis for a settlement would 
exist. But the fact is that neither we nor 
they are willing to settle for the Geneva 
agreements. 
These agreements stipulate that North and 
South Vietnam are not two separate nations 
but two temporary zones of the same nation, 
and that 2 years after the armistice which 
demarcated the two zones, "the settlement 
of political problems, effected on the basis 
of respect for the principles of independence, 
unity, and territorial integrity, shall permit 
the Vietnamese people to enjoy the funda-
mental freedoms guaranteed by democratic 
institutions established as a result of free 
general elections by secret ballot." As Hanoi 
has never held anything resembling a free 
election in North Vietnam, there is little rea-
son to believe that it is prepared to have free 
elections in both zones of Vietnam. As for 
the United States, while our Government en-
dorsed the Geneva agreements, and espec-
ially the provision for free elections, It op-
posed free elections when it realized that Ho 
Chi Minh would win them. General Eisen-
hower states this frankly in his memoirs. 
Since that time we have insisted that South 
Vietnam is an independent nation. 
And so, in spite of the apparent agreement 
on the "essentials of the agreements of 1954," 
neither side has as yet adopted a credible 
and genuine negotiating position. This 
country, at least, should do so. Our policy 
since February has been to attack, to make 
war upon, North Vietnam in order to compel 
it to negotiate a settlement that we approve. 
Therefore, it matters a great deal that we 
adopt a negotiating position which we are 
able to defend clearly and openly. 
A cardinal weakness of our diplomatic 
position today is the President's statement at 
Baltimore that "the first reality is that Norh 
Vietnam has attacked the independent na-
tion of South Vietnam." This was not our 
original position. It has been called the first 
reality only in the most recent phase of the 
war, the phase which began in February. 
Our present position is contrary to indubi-
table "essentials" of the Geneva agreements 
of 1954, that North and South Vietnam are 
not two nations but two zones of one nation. 
It is argued by some, though not yet by the 
State Department explicitly, that the 1954 
agreements have been overtaken by history 
and that de facto, as things have actually 
been for 10 years, there are now two sepa-
rate and independent nations. But if this 
is our official position, how then does the 
State Department explain why we ignore the 
charter of the United Nations, especially 
articles 39 and 51. and declared on our own 
say-so that North Vietnam was the aggress-Dr 
against an independent state? Had we gone 
to the Security Council for such a determi-
nation, we would, of course, have collided 
with a Soviet veto. But we would at least 
have proved that we believed what we were 
saying and perhaps we might have gotten a 
few votes to support us. 
As a matter of fact, the argument that we 
are now using, that the two Vietnams are 
independent because they have been sepa-
rated for 10 years, is a very embarrassing 
principle for the State Department to rely 
on. It would mean, for example, that these 
are two independent German states because 
Germany has been partitioned for 10 years. 
I am well aware that to be concerned 
about our legal and moral position is regarded 
by the new school of superrealists as un-
worthy of a proud and tough nation. But I 
think we have something to be very much 
concerned about when we look about us -and 
see how we are drifting into an icy isolation. 
On the continent of Asia there are besides 
Red China four major Asian powers, the 
Soviet Union and Japan in the north, Pakis-
tan and India in the south. With the pos-
sible, though only apparent, exception of 
Japan, we are embroiled with all the powers 
of Asia. The bitter truth of the matter is 
that we can search the globe and look in 
vain for true and active supporters of our 
policy. 
That is how successfully the State Depars-
ment has planned our diplomatic policy ar d 
has argued. the American case.

WE ARE DELUDING OURSELVES IN VIETNAM: 
(By Hans J. Morgenthau) 
(Nors.--We have let ourselves become en-
gaged in a war we find we cannot win, says 
one expert, who declares there is only or e 
way out?"Out.") 
The address which President Johnson, de-
livered on April 7 at Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity is important for two reasons. On the 
one hand, the President has shown for the 
first time a way out of the impasse in which 
we find ourselves in Vietnam. By agreeing 
to negotiations without preconditions he luis 
opened the door to negotiations which these 
preconditions had made impossible from the 
outset. 
By proposing a project for the economic 
development of southeast Asia?with North 
Vietnam a beneficiary and the Soviet Union 
a supporter?he has implicity recognized the 
variety of national interests in the Cow - 
mtmist world and the need for varied Amer-
ican. responses tailored to those interests. 
By asking "that the people of South Vietnam 
be allowed to guide their own country in 
their own way," he has left all possibilities 
open for the future evolution of relations 
between North and South Vietnam. 
On the other hand, the President reiter-
ated the intellectual assumptions and policy 
proposals which brought us to an impasse 
and which make it impossible to extricate 
ourselves. The President has linked our in-
volvement in Vietnam with our war of in-
dependence and has proclaimed the freetiors 
of all nations as the goal of our foreign

policy. He has started from the assumption 
that there are two Vietnamese nations, one 
Of which has attacked the other, and he sees 
that attack as an integral part of the un-
limited Chinese aggression. Consistent with 
this assumption, the President is willing to 
negotiate with China and North Vietnam 
but not with the Vietcong. 
Yet we cannot have it both ways. We 
Cannot at the same time embrace these false 
assumptions and pursue new sound policies. 
Thus we are faced with a real dilemma. 
This dilemma is by no means of the Presi-
dent's making. 
We are militarily engaged in Vietnam by 
virtue of a basic principle of our foreign 
policy that was implicit in the Truman doc-
trine of 1947 and was put into practice by 
John Foster L/ulles from 1954 onward. This 
principle is the military containment of 
communism. Containment had its origins 
in Europe; Dulles applied it to the Middle 
East and Asia through_.a series of bilateral 
and multilateral alliances. Yet what was 
an outstanding success in Europe turned out 
to be a dismal failure elsewhere. The rea-
sons for that failure are twofold. 
First, the threat that faced the nations 
of Western Europe in the aftermath of the 
Second World War was primarily military. 
? It was the threat of the Red Army march-
ing westward. Behind the line of military 
demarcation of 1945 which the policy of con-
tainment declared to be the westernmost 
limit of the Soviet Empire, there was an 
ancient civilization, only temporarily weak 
and able to maintain it,,self against the threat 
of Communist subversion. 
The situation is different in the Middle 
East and Asia. The threat there is not pri-
rnarily military but political in nature. 
Weak governments and societies provide op-
portunities for Communist subversion. Mili-
tary containment IS irrelevant to that threat 
and may even be counterproductive. Thus 
the Baghdad Pact did not protect Egypt from 
Soviet influence and SEATO has had no 
bearing on Chinese influence in Indonesia 
and Pakistan. 
Second, and mere important, even if China 
Were threatening her neighbors primarily by 
Military means, it would be impossible to 
contain her by erecting a military wall at 
the periphery of her empire. For China is, 
even in her present underdeveloped state, 
the dominent power in Asia. She is this by 
virtue of the quality and quantity of her 
population, her geographic position, her 
civilization, her past power remembered, and 
her future power anticipated. Anybody who 
has traveled in Asia with his eyes and ears 
open Must have been impressed by the enor-
inbus impact which the resurgence of China 
has made upon all manner of men, regard-
less of class and political conviction, from 
Japan to Pakistan. 
The issue China poses is political and cul-
tural predominance. The United States can 
no more contain Chinese influence in Asia 
by arming South Vietnam and Thailand than 
China could contain American influence in 
the Western Hemisphere by arming, say, 
Nicaragua and Costa Rica. 
If we are convinced that we cannot live 
with a China predominant on the mainland 
of Asia, then we rau4st strike at the heart of 
Chinese power?that is, rather than try to 
cdntain the power of China, we must try to 
destroy that power itself, Thus there is logic 
on the side of that small group of Americans 
who are convinced that war between the 
United States and China is inevitable and 
that the earlier that war comes, the better 
will be the chances for the United States to 
will it. _ 
Yet, while logic is on their side, practical 
judgment is against them. For while China 
Is obviously no match for the United States 
in overall power, China is largely immune to 
No. 71-9 
the specific types of power in which the 
superiority of the United States consists?
that is, nuclear, air, and naval power. Cer-
tainly, the United States has the power to 
destroy the nuclear installations and the 
major industrial and population centers of 
China, but this destruction would not defeat 
China; it would only set her development 
back. To be defeated, China has to be con-
quered. 
Physical conquest would require the de-
ployment of millions of American soldiers on 
the mainland of Asia. No American military 
leader has ever advocated a course of a.-_,-tion 
so fraught with incalculable risks, so un-
certain of outcome, requiring sacrifices so 
out of proportion to the interests at stake 
and the benefits to be expected. President 
Eisenhower declared on February 10, 1954, 
that he "could conceive of no greater tragedy 
than for the United States to become involved 
in an all-out war in Indochina." General 
MacArthur, in the congressional hearings 
concerning his dismissal and in personal con-
versation with President Kennedy, emphatic-
ally warned against sending American foot 
soldiers to the Asian mainland to fight China. 
If we do not want to set ourselves goals 
which cannot be attained with the means 
we are willing to employ, we must learn to 
accommodate ourselves to the predominance 
of China on the Asian mainland. It is 
,in-
structive to note that those Asian nations 
which have done so?such as Burma and 
Cambodia?live peacefully in the shadow of 
the Chinese giant. 
This modus vivendi, composed of legal in-
dependence and various degrees of actual 
dependence, has indeed been for more than a 
millennium the persistent pattern of Chinese 
predominance on the mainland of Asia. The 
military conquest of Tibet is the sole excep-
tion to that pattern. The military opera-
tions at the Indian border do not diverge 
from it, since their purpose was the estab-
lishment of a frontier disputed by both sides. 
On the other hand, those Asian nations 
Which have allowed themselves to be trans-
formed into outposts of American military 
power?such as Laos a few years ago, South 
Vietnam and Thailand?have become the 
actual or prospective victims of Communist 
aggression and subversion. Thus it appears 
that peripheral military containment is 
counterproductive. Challenged at its periph-
ery by American military power at its 
weakest?that is, by the proxy of client-
states?China or its proxies respond with 
locally superior military at political power. 
In specific terms, accommodation means 
four things: (1) recognition of the political 
and cultural predominance of China on the 
mainland of Asia as a fact of life; (2) liqui-
dation of the peripheral military contain-
ment of China; (3) strengthening of the 
uncommitted nations of Asia by nonmilitary 
means; (4) assessment of Communist gov-
ernments in Asia in terms not of Commu-
nist doctrine but of their relation to the 
interests and power of the United States. 
In the light of these principles, the alter-
native to our present policies in Vietnam 
would be this: a face-saving agreement which 
would allow us to disengage ourselves mili-
tarily in stages spaced in time; restoration of 
the status quo of the Geneva Agreement of 
1964, with special emphasis upon all-Viet-
namese elections, cooperation with the Soviet 
Union in support of a Titoist all-Vietnamese 
Government, which would be likely to 
emerge from such elections. 
This last point is crucial, for our present 
policies not only drive Hanoi'into the wait-
ing arms of Peiping, but also make it very 
difficult for Moscow to pursue an independ-
ent policy. Our interests in southeast Asia 
are identical with those of the Soviet Union: 
to prevent the expansion of the military 
power of China. But while our present pol-
. 
idles invite that expansion, so do they make 
it impossible for the Soviet Union to join us 
in preventing it. If we were to reconcile 
ourselves to the establishment of a Titoist 
government in all of Vietnam, the Soviet 
Union could successfully compete with China 
in claiming credit for it and surrepitiously 
cooperate with us in maintaining it. 
Testing the President's proposals by these 
standards, one realizes how far they go in 
meeting them. These proposals do not pre-
clude a return to the Geneva Agreement and 
even assume the existence of a Titoist gov-
ernment in North Vietnam. Nor do they 
preclude the establishment of a Titoist gov-
ernment for all of Vietnam, provided the 
people of South Vietnam have freely agreed ' 
to it. They also envision the active par-
ticipation of the Soviet Union in establish-
ing and maintaining a new balance of power 
in southeast Asia. On the other hand, the 
President has flatly rejected a withdrawal 
"under the cloak of a meaningless agree-
ment." The controlling word is obviously 
"meaningless," and only the future can tell 
Whether we shall consider any face-saving 
agreement as "meaningless" regardless of its 
political context. 
However, we are under a psychological 
compulsion to continue our military presence 
in South Vietnam as part of the peripheral 
military containment of China. We have 
been emboldened in this course of action by 
the identification of the enemy as "Com-
munist," seeing in every Communist party 
and regime an extension of hostile Russian 
or Chinese power. This identification was 
justified 20 or 15 years ago when communism 
still had a monolithic character. Here, as 
elsewhere, our modes of thought and action 
have been rendered obsolete by new devel-
opments. 
It is ironic that this simple juxtaposition 
of "communism" and "free world" was 
erected by John Foster Dulles's crusading 
moralism into the guiding principle of 
American foreign policy at a time when the 
national communism of Yugoslavia, the 
neutralism of the third world and the in-
cipient split between the Soviet Union and 
China were rendering that juxtaposition in-
valid. 
Today, it .is belaboring the obvious to say 
that we are faced not with one monolithic 
communism whose uniform hostility must be 
countered with equally uniform hostility, 
but with a number of different communisms 
whose hostilities, determined by different 
national interests, vary. In fact, the United 
States encounters today less hostility from ? 
Tito, who is a Communist, than from De 
Gaulle, who is not. 
We can today distinguish four different 
types of communism in view of the kind 
and degree of hostility to the United States 
they represent: a communism identified with 
the Soviet Union?e.g., Poland; a commu-
nism identified with China?e.g., Albania; a' 
communism that straddles the fence be-
tween the Soviet Union and China?e.g., Ru-
mania, and independent communism?e.g., 
Yugoslavia. Each of these communisms 
must be dealt with in terms of the bearing 
its foreign policy has upon the interests of 
the United States in a concrete instance. 
It would, of course, be absurd to suggest 
that the officials responsible for the conduct 
of American foreign policy are unaware of 
these distinctions and of the demands they 
make for discriminating subtlety. Yet it is 
an obvious fact of experience that these of-
ficials are incapable of living up to these 
demands when they deal with Vietnam. 
Thus they maneuver themselves into a 
position which is antirevolutionary per se 
and which requires military opposition to 
revolution wherever it is found in Asia, re-
gardless of how it affects the interests?and 
how susceptible it is to the power?of the

WE SHOULD NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT IN 
VIETNAM 
? (By Senator FRANK CHURCH ) 
- 
Our struggle in South Vietnam has reached 
a point where neither side can achieve a con-
clusive military decision, and the only visible 
prospect for a solution is to be found at the 
conference table. But there is sq much 
Washington talk about steping up the war 
that it threatens to engulf all rational dis-
cussion of the crisis we face?almost as if 
peace were something to be avoided. 
The war hawks are putting on the heat. 
Anyone who disagrees with them is accused 
of "running up a white flag:" Debate is dis-
couraged; dissent is condemned as endanger-
ing the country. Any talk of a negotiated 
settlement in Vietnam is equated with 
Munich; any prospect of an eventual Amer-
ican withdrawal is likened to Dunkirk. 
Yet everyone senses that peace in Vietnam 
can only be restored through a political set-
tlement, and that the United States neither 
wishes nor expects to keep a foothold in 
southeast Asia. Accordingly, I believe we 
should try to break 'the diplomatic deadlock 
(First you withdraw, then we will talk) 
that finds both sides, in effect, demanding 
the surrender of the other as the price for 
negotiations. I disagree with the prevailing 
doctrine that now is, not the,tirne,to parley. 
The longer we wait, the harder it will become 
to achieve a, satisfactory solution. 
Opposing any negotiations, the war hawks 
contend that we Americans must first have 
it out with the Communists in Vietnam. 
They see the struggle there, which has thus 
far been mostly confined to the, Vietnamese, 
as one of suddenly portentous importance. 
Hanson Baldwin, military editor for the New 
York Times? declares that we should ready 
Ourselves to send a million Americans into 
- battle. He writes: "We must fight a war to 
prevent an irreparable defeat. * * Viet-
nam is a nasty place to fight. tint' * * 
there is no 'good' place to die. And it is far 
better to fight in Vietnam?on China's door-
step?than fight some years hence in Hawaii, 
on our own frontiera." 
Such trumpetings substitute sound for 
sanity. We may have invested prestige in 
Vietnam, but by no stretch of imagination 
does this struggle threaten the life of our 
country. 
We conquered the' Pacific in the Second 
World War. It is our moat, the broadest on 
earth, from the Golden Gate to the' very 
shores of China. With unchallenged naval 
and aerial supremacy, we dominate it, patrol 
it and defend it. There is no way for the 
landlocked forces of: Asia to drive ug from 
the Pacific. The elephant cannot drive the 
whale from the sea, nor the eagle from the 
sky. Our presence in the Far East is not 
anchored to Vietnam, 
I believe that the containment of a hostile 
China is a proper goal for American policy. 
To avoid Chinese conquest of her neighbors, 
we fought in Korea, and we have solemnly 
pledged ourselves to defend Taiwan. The 
Weakness a the Chinese-expansion argu-
ment, as it relates to Vietnam, is that China 
has thus far displayed no wish to invade 
southeast ASia. To date, Chinese troops have 
not been fighting in Vietnam. Moreover, 
China hasn't yet moved a cadre of "advisers" 
into North Vietnam that begins to compare, 
in numbers of men or in the amount of aid 
given, to the American presence in the South. 
The best way to keep China out of Vietnam 
is to settle e war ,:here. escalation of 
the war northward, e it continues unabated, 
Is the Most likely way to draw Chinese armies 
down, thus creating, the very calamity Our 
policy should be designed to avert. 
However, a new definitiqn of containment 
has emerged to justify the deepening in-
volvement of the United States in the fight-
ling in southeast Asia. Our presence there, it 
is said, is not to furnish a shield against an 
anticipated Chinese invasion, but rather to 
'counteract the spread of Chinese influence. 
If this is our purpose, it is a vain one indeed. 
China is the giant of Asia, unshackled and 
determined to reclaim her prerogatives as the 
dominant power of the mainland. In the 
natural course of events, we can no more ex-
pect to deny China her influence in southeast 
Asia, the region immediately beneath her, 
than China could expect to deny the United 
States our influence in Central America. 
No outpost bristling with bayonets?least 
of all one held in South Vietnam by Ameri-
can occupation forces?is going to stem the 
Spread of Chinese influence in Asia. If we 
cannot live in a world where the Chinese 
exert influence in Indochina, then we had 
better forget Vietnam and commence now 
to destroy and dismember China, something 
no other nation in history has ever managed 
to do. 
But since the conquest of China is not an 
American ambition, we should stop fooling 
ourselves with talk that our involvement in 
Vietnam can somehow bring an end to the 
spread of Chinese influence in Asia. In fact, 
the evidence is just the other way around. 
,Because of the extent of our intervention in 
South Vietnam, the Peiping government is 
able to pose as the champion of Asia for the 
Asians, defying the United States in the 
name of resisting the return of Western im-
,perialism. Chou En-lai had reason to rub 
his hands with glee when he said recently to 
a foreign visitor: "Once we worried about 
southeast Asia. We don't anymore. The 
Americans are rapidly solving our problems 
for us." 
Although we cannot immunize southeast 
Asia from Chinese influence, the restoration 
of peace to this war weary region offers the 
little countries of Indochina their best hope 
for remaining independent. They would, of 
necessity, establish friendly ties with China, 
staying scrupulously neutral and unalined, 
but they need not become the vassal states 
that a spreading war, drawing Chinese armies 
in, would surely make them. This even ap-
plies to North Vietnam, where nationalist 
feeling against China is deep, and where Ho 
IVIinh does not yet take his orders from 
Peiping. Clearly, if we seek to restrict Chi-
nese hegemony in southeast Asia, a settle-
ment in Vietnam is essential. 
Those who urge the contrary course?a 
Korean-type war in Indochina?often argue 
that South Vietnam has become the testing 
ground of a new and vicious form of Com-
munist aggression, the guerrilla war. They 
Contend that the Vietcong rebels, though per-
haps not the pawns of Peiping, are at least 
the agents of Hanoi; that indirect aggression 
by infiltration is being practiced by the 
, North against the South; and that we Ameri-
cans must see to it that the guerrillas are 
driven out, or such wars of subversion will 
,spread. 
I grant this seems a compelling argument, 
but it won't stand up under close analysis. 
communist guerrilla wars didn't begin in 
Vietnam and won't end there, regardless of 
the outcome of this particular struggle. 
, 
American muscle, sufficiently used, may hold 
the 17th parallel against infiltrators from the 
north, but our bayonets .will not stop?they 
could , even spread?Communist agitation 
within other Asian countries government 
. . 
may he checked by force,, but not an idea. 
There is no way to fence off an ideology. 
Indeed, Communist-inspired guerrilla wars 
have always jumped over boundary lines. 
They have erupted in scattered, far-flung 
places around the globe, wherever adverse 
sonclitions within ..a given country permit 
Communist suhversion ,to take root.. The 
threatened governments put down such guer-
rilla uprisings in the Philippines, Malaya, 
8007 
Burma, and Greece. The decision for, Saigon 
hangs in the balance. 
This is a time Of ferment. Some of these 
guerrilla revolts_ Will succeed; others will 
fail. The outcome, in each case, will depend 
upon the character of the government chal-
lenged, and the Willingness of the ,people to 
rally behind' it. That Some governments 
won't prove equal -CO the test is no reason for 
us to panic. The other governments in 
southeast Asia are not so many dominoes in 
a row. They differ, one from another, in 
popular support and in capacity to resist 
Communist subversion. We all hope Saigon 
will prevail, but the argument that "as goes 
South Vietnam, so goes all of southeast 
Asia," is predicated more upon fear than fact. 
Communism isn't going to take over the 
world; it is much too poor a system for that. 
Whether Saigon can meet the test remains 
to be seen. Until now, it has been losing its 
war, not for lack of arms; but for lack of 
internal cohesion. The Vietcong grow 
stronger, not because they are better supplied 
but because they are united in their will to 
fight. This spirit cannot be imported from 
without. The weakness in South Vietnam 
emanates from Saigon itself, where we, as 
foreigners, are powerless to pacify the spoil-
ing factions. Only the Vietnamese can fur-
nish a solution. 
This brings us back to the central ques-
tion: Why did' we intervene in South Viet-
nam? President Eisenhower, who committed 
us there, expressed the reason, and his suc-
cessors, Kennedy and Johnson, have faith-
fully repeated it. We went in, upon the 
invitation of Saigon (10 governments ago), 
to give aid and advice to the Vietnamese who 
were fighting the Vietcong rebels. We can 
give arms, money, food, training and equip-
ment, which is all we committed ourselves 
to do, but we cannot, as a foreign nation, 
win the war. TJltimately, a civil war has to 
be decided by the people of the country con-
cerned. 
We only deceive ourselves when we pre-
tend that the struggle in Vietnam is not a 
civil war. The two parts of Vietnam don't 
represent two different peoples, with separate 
identities. Vietnam is a partitioned country 
in the grip of a continuing revolution. That 
the government of North Vietnam has deeply 
involved itself in support, or even direction, 
of the rebellion in the south doesn't make 
the war any less a civil war. The fighting is 
still between Vietnamese. The issue is still 
that of determining what groups of Vietnam-
ese shall govern the country. 
It is true, of course, that foreign powers 
are intereated in the outcome of this 
struggle, China favoring Hanoi, the United 
States backing Saigon. But, again, the in-
volvement of outside countries, even when it 
takes the forth of limited intervention, 
doesn't change the essential character of the 
war. 
With the war in Vietnam at a point where 
neither side can achieve a conclusive mili-
tary decision, some kind of political settle-
ment has to be worked out. I cannot, fur-
nish a precise blueprint for a peaceful settle-
ment. No one can at this point. But I can 
indicate, in general terms, a form of settle-
ment that lies in that middle ground that 
both sides must seek out if a negotiated 
settlement is to be reached. The timing 
of any settlement must, of course, be left to 
the President. He alone can know whether 
or when Hanoi appears willing to bargain. 
As for the United States, we can always 
deal at the conference table from a strength 
that rests not upon the softness of Saigon 
but upon our own possession of the sea and 
air. Therefore I believe we must demon-
strate that we cannot be driven out of Indo-
china, and that we won't bow to a Commu-
nist-dictated peace. Our recent bombings 
sbonld Make it clear to Hanoi that we will 
not .quit under fire, or withdraw, or submit 
to coercion.

At the same time we should make it 
equally clear that we are prepared to nego-
tiate on honorable terms. The judiciotis use 
of both the arrows and the relive branch, 
clutched by the American eagle in the Pres-
idential seal, represents our best hope for 
avoiding a Korean-type war on the Asian 
mainland. We should indicate, our willing-
ness to interpose a neutral buffer zone in 
Indochina, consisting of Laos, Cambodia, 
and South Vietnam. Such a zone need not 
create a power vactiurn for Chinese armies 
to fill. This is a more likely result, in the 
absence of such an agreement, of an ex-
panded war. The integrity of the neu-
tralized region against invasion from without 
could be guaranteed by the signatories to the 
agreement. Thus the military might of the 
United States would remain a deterrent to 
Chinese encroachment from the north, which 
is?or ought to be?our primary purpose in 
southeast Asia anyway. During its transi-
tional phase such an agreement could be 
policed by special forces of an international 
commission, set up to preside over a cease-
fire while political arrangements are worked 
out by the people of each country. 
Admittedly, this involves the unavoidable 
risk that pro-Communist elements may come 
to prevail, but the war itself--which sees 
Western forces increasingly pitted against 
Asians?has become the breeding ground of 
steadily' growing political support for the 
Communist cause. As Prince Sihanouk, 
Cambodia's royalist ruler, has pointed out, 
the risk of Communist ascendancy after a 
settlement grows larger every day the war is 
prolonged. If this estimate is correct, and 
there is mounting evidence to support it, 
then the time to negotiate is now, while the 
anti-Communist elements in Indochina still 
possess authority. 
Now is the time, while the jungles and rice 
field e still belong to the Vietnamese, to strive 
for an end to the war. Hanoi has reason to 
bargain, for she covets her independence and 
has Cause. to. fear China. The same holds 
teuelor Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam. 
Even the Soviet Union has inceptive to work 
for a settlement that will foreclese a Chinese 
occupation of southeast Asia. These propi-
tious eonditions, all of which" work in PUT 
favor, are likely to be the first casualties of 
a widening war.

(By T. F. Stone) 
The morning I sat down to write this re-
view,: the Washington Post (March 25) car-
ried the news that Malcolm W. Browne had 
been arrested and held for 2 hours by South 
Vietnamese Air Force officers at the big U.S. 
air and missile base at Da Nang. The inci-
dent es syinhol and symptom of the steady 
degeneration in the conduct of the Viet-
namese war. These two books by two news-
papermen who won Pulitzer Prizes last year 
for their coverage of the war, Browne for 
the ,Associated Press, David Halberstane for 
the New York Times, record the agony of 
trying to report the war truthfully against 
the opposition of the laigherups, military 
and civilian. The books appear just as the 
war is entering a new stage when honest re-
porting is more essential than ever, but now 
restriction and censorship are applied to 
black it out. Da Nang, the main base from 
which", the war, is being escalated to the 
North, was officially declared "off limits" the 
day before Browne's arrest and newsmen were 
told they could not enter without a pass 
obtainable only in Saigon, 385 miles to the 
south. "Newsmen," the dispatch on 
Browne's arrest, "doubted such a pass ex-
isted." The incident occurred only a few 
days after the highest information officer at 
the Pentagon claimed that its policy on cov-
erage of the war was "complete candor." 
What makes these books so timely, their 
message so urgent, is that they show the 
Vietnamese war in that aspect which is most 
fundamental for our own people?as a chal-
lenge to freedom of information and there-
fore freedom of decision. They appear at a 
time when all' the errors on which they 
throw light are being intensified. Instead of 
correcting policy in the light of the record, 
the light itself is being shut down. Access 
to news sources in Vietnam and in Washing-
ton is being limited, censorship in the field 
is becoming more severe. Diem is dead but 
what might be termed Diernism has become 
the basic policy of the American Govern-
ment. For years our best advisers, military 
and civilian, tried desperately tei make him 
understand that the war was a political prob-
lem which could only be solved In South 
Vietnam. Three years ago the head of the 
U.S. mission spoke of the war as a battle 
for the "hearts and minds" of the people, 
and primarily the villagers, whose disaffec-
tion had made the rebellion possible against 
superior forces and equipment. To win that 
battle it was then proposed to spend $200 
million to bolster the Vietnamese economy 
and raise living standards. Though much 
of this money seems to have been frittered 
away, it was at least recognized that the 
military effort was only one aspect of the 
problem. Now we have adopted Diem's sim-
ple-minded theory that the war is merely 
a Product of Communist conspiracy, that it 
is purely an invasion and not a rebellion or 
a civil war, and that all would be well?in 
Secretary Rusk's fatuous phrase?if only the 
North let its neighbors alone. This is the 
theory of the white paper and this is the 
excuse for bombing North Vietnam. 
While the war expands, the theory on 
which it proceeds has narrowed. Washing-
ton's "party line" on the war has been shrunk 
to rid it of those annoying complexities im-
posed by contact with reality. The change 
becomes evident if one compares the white 
paper of 1965 with the Blue Book of 1961. 
The Blue Book was issued by the Kennedy 
administration to explain its decision to step 
up the scale of our aid and the number of 
our "miltairy advisers" in South Vietnam. 
The white paper wag issued by the Johnson 
administration to prepare the public mind 
to accept its decision to bomb the North and 
risk a wider war. The change of policy re-
quired that rewriting of history we find so 
amusing when we watch it being done on 
the other side. 
Four years ago the Blue Book told us that 
the basic pattern of Vietcong activity was 
"not new, of course." It said this followed 
the tactics applied and the theories worked 
out by Mao Tse-tung in China. It said much 
the same methods were used "in Malaya, in 
Greece, in the Philippines, in Cuba, and in 
Laos." If there is "anything peculiar to the 
Vietnam situation," the Blue Book said, "it 
is 'that the country is divided and one-half 
provides a safe sanctuary from Which sub-
version in the other half is supported with 
both personnel and materiel." This im-
plied a conflict which was doubly a civil 
war, first between the two halves Of a divided 
country and then between the government 
and Communist-led guerrillas in one-half of 
that country. 
The white paper disagrees. It abandons 
complexity to make possible simple-minded 
slogans and policy. It declares the conflict 
"a new kind of war * * * a totally new 
brand of aggression * * * not another Greece 
* * * not another Malaya * * * not an-
other Philippines * * * Above all * * * not 
a spontaneous and local rebellion against 
the established government." 'The funda-
mental difference," the white paper says, is 
that in Vietnam "a Communist government 
has set out deliberately to conquer a soy-
22, i"65 
ereign people in a neighboring state." This 
implies that there is no popular discontent 
in the south to be allayed, no need to nego-
tiate with the rebels. The war is merely a 
case of international aggression and the,,ag-
gressor is to be punished by bombardment 
until he agrees to call off the invasion. The 
rebellion can be shut off, all this implies, as 
if by spigot from Hanoi. The truth about 
the war has been tailored to suit the Air 
Force faith in "victory by airpower." This 
was Goldwater's theory and this has become 
Johnson's policy. 
Browne's book sheds some sharp light on 
the white paper's thesis. The white paper 
says the war is "inspired, directed, supplied 
and controlled" by Hanoi. But Browne re-
ports that "intelligence experts feel less than 
10 percent and probably more like 2 percent 
of the Vietcong's stock of modern weapons 
is Communist made." He also reports that 
"only a small part of Vietcong increase in 
strength has resulted from infiltration of 
North Vietnamese Communist troops into 
South Vietnam." An astringent examina-
tion of the white paper and its supporting 
appendixes will show that it really proves 
little more than this, despite the sweeping 
headline impressions it was intended to gen-
erate. Browne also tells us that "Western 
intelligence experts believe the proportion 
of Communists (in the National Liberation 
Front) is probably extremely small." He de-
scribes it as "a true 'front' organization ap-
pealing for the support of every social class." 
Browne declares the Front a "creature" of 
the Vietnamese Communist Party and says 
it has "strong but subtle ties" to the Hanoi 
regime. For many Vietnamese, neverthe-
less "the Front is exactly what it purports 
to be?the people's struggle for independ-
ence." This is what our best advisers tried 
to tell Diem. This is what our bureaucracy 
now refuses to see rather than admit past 
error and defeat, preferring to gamble on a 
wider war. 
The really terrible message in these books 
Is not that the bureaucrats have tried to de-
ceive the public but that they have insisted 
on deceiving themselves. The Vietnamese 
war has been an exercise in self-delusion. 
David Halberstam tells us in "The Making 
of a Quagmire," that when the first Buddhist 
burned himself to death, Ngo Dinh Diem was 
convinced that this act had been staged by 
an American television team. The Buddhist 
crisis, as Halberstam describes it, "was to 
encompass all the problems of the govern-
ment: its inability to rule its own people; 
the failure of the American mission to influ-
ence Diem * * Observing the government, 
during those 4 months was like watching a 
government trying to commit suicide." The 
stubborn insistence of the South Vietnamese 
dictator on insulating himself from reality 
spread into our own Government. The most 
important revelation these two books make 
is the unwillingness of the higher-ups in 
Saigon and Washington to hear the truth 
from their subordinates in the field. 
South Vietnam swarmed with spies, but, 
apparently they were only listened to when 
they reported what their paymasters wanted 
to hear. Halberstam says that at one time 
Diem had 13 different secret police organi-
zations. Browne provides a vivid picture, 
of how our own intelligence agencies pro-
liferated. The CIA, Special Forces, the Air 
mission, the Army, the Provost Marshal, the 
Navy, and the U.S. Embassy each had ite 
own operatives. But they were not, in 
Browne's words, "one big happy family." Or 
the contrary they "very often closely con-
cealed" their findings from other agencie: 
"because of the danger that the competitor: 
may pirate the material and report it to 
headquarters first, getting the credit." 
All of this fierce application of free enter. 
prise to the collection of information seem: 
to have been of little use because of a top 
level political decision. "Ever since Viet-

C009 
narnese independence" (i.e., 1954), Browne 
reveals, "American intelligence officials had 
relied on the Vietnamese intelligence system 
for most of their infOrmation." This was 
"because of Dlem's touchiness about Ameri-
can spooks wandering around on their own." 
In the interest of preserving 'harmony, "some-
how the intelligence reports always had it 
that the 'War was going well." We circulated 
faithfully in orbit around our own satellite. 
Diem's men told him what he wanted to hear, 
and ours passed on what he wanted us to be-
lieve. Halberstam confirms this. In those 
final months before Diem's overthrow, "CIA 
agents were telling me that their superiors in 
Vietnam were still so optimistic that they 
were not taking the turmoil and unrest very 
seriously." John Richardson, then CIA chief 
in Vietnam, displayed a kind of infatuation 
with Diem's brother Nhu and his wife. Hal-
berstam describes a lunch with RichardSon 
in 1962, shortly after the New York Times 
sent him to Saigon, in which the CIA chief 
dismissed Nhu.'s notorious anti-Arnerican re-
marks as simply those of "a proud Asian." 
As for the tigerish Mme. Nhu, Richardson 
thought her "sometimes a little emotional, 
but that was typical of women who entered 
politics?look at Mrs. Roosevelt." 
A persistent Panglossianism marked our 
entire bureaucracy up to and including the 
White House. General Harkins, our mil-
itary commander in South Vietnam, said "/ 
am an optimist and I am not going to allow 
My staff to be pessimistic." Halberstam de-
scribes a briefing at his command post after 
the battle of Ap Bac in January 1963, the 
kind of setpiece battle for which our mil-
itary had long hoped and which they first 
described as a victory though it turned out 
to be a disastrous defeat. With "the gov-
ernment troops so completely disorganized 
that they would not even carry out their 
own dead," -a province chief shelling his 
own men" and the enemy long gone," Gen-
eral Harkins told the press a trap was about 
to be sprung on the enemy. 
The enemy was the press. When the facts 
about Ap Bac could no longer be concealed, 
headquarters became angry "not with the 
system" that brought defeat, Halberstam 
writes, nor with the Vietnamese commanders 
responsible for it "but with the American 
reporters who wrote about it." Admiral 
Harry Felt, commander of all U.S. forces in 
the Pacific, gave classic expression to the 
-bureaucratic attitude toward the press when 
he was angered by a question from Browne. 
"Why don't you get on the team?" the ad-
miral demanded. 
When lialberstarn, Browne, and Neil Shee-
han,1 then with the UPI, visiSed the Mekong 
Delta in the summer of 1963 and sem./ for 
themselves the deterioration of the war, 
their reward for reporting it was a campaign 
of denigration. Rusk criticized Halberstam 
at a press conference. President Kennedy 
suggested to the publisher of the New York 
Times that Halberstam be transferred to 
some other assignment, a suggestion Mr. Ar-
thur Hays Sulzberger, to his credit, rejected. 
The bureaucracy counterattacked through 
Joe Alsop, who insidiously compared the re-
porters on the scene to those who a genera-
tion earlier had called the Chinese Commu-
nists agrarian reformers. The New York 
Journal-American wrote that Halberstam 
wee soft on communism. A friend in the 
-State Department told Halberstam, "It's a 
damn good thing you never belonged to any 
leftwing groups or anything like that be-
cause they were really looking for stuff like 
that." Victor, KrUlalt, the Pentagon's top 
specialist on guerrilla warfare, was vehe-
ment in his criticism of the press: "Richard 
Tregaskis and Maggie Higgins had found 
that the war was being won, but a bunch 
1 See the vivid account in his preface to 
Jules ROy's agonized and eloquent "The 
Battle of Dienbienphu," Harper, $6.95. 
of young cubs who kept writing about the 
political side were defeatists." The official 
attitude was epitomized by Lyndon Johnson, 
then Vice President, on his way back from 
Saigon in 1961. He had laid the flattery on 
with a shovel, calling Diem the Churchill 
of Asia. Halberstam reports that when a 
reporter on the plane tried to tell Johnson 
something of Diem's faults, Johnson re-
sponded, "Don't tell me about Diem. He's 
all we've got out there." A brink is a dan-
gerous place on which to prefer not to see 
where you're going. 
The hostile attitude toward honest report-
ing is made the more shocking because re-
porters like Halberstam and Browne, as their 
conclusions reveal, were critics not of the war 
itself but only of the ineffective way in which 
it was conducted. The force for which they 
spoke, the sources on Which they depended, 
were not dissident Vietnamese but junior 
American officers. Their books disclose little 
contact with the Vietnamese. The battle 
between the press and the bureaucracy arose 
because the newspapermen refused to report 
that the war was being won, but there was 
not too much reporting of why it was being 
lost. 
For Halberstam the war was a lark, a won-
derful assignment for a young reporter; his 
pages reflect his zest and are full of graphic 
reportage, though also marked by some 
egregious errors, such as locating Dienbien-
phu in Laos and attributing the origin of 
the agrovilles to the French whereas they 
really sprang from Nhu's mystical author-
itarianism. For Browne the war was less ro-
mantic. The life of a wire service reporter 
on call 24 hours a day in so tense a situa-
tion is no picnic. His book is written in flat 
agency prose. Both men acquitted them-
selves honorably, in the best tradition of 
American journalism, which is always to be 
skeptical of any official statement. But 
both books are marked by that characteristic 
intentness on the moment; the idea that the 
past may help explain the present appears 
only rarely. There is no time for study, 
and American editors do not encourage that 
type of journalism in depth which distin-
guishes Le Monde or the Neue Ziiricher 
Zeitung. 
This defect is most damaging in reporting 
on the origins of the revolt against Diem. 
The average American newspaper reader got 
the impression that this was brought about 
by esoteric and long-distance means, by 
Communist plotters activated from Hanoi to 
engage in that mysterious process referred 
to in our press as "subversion." This is the 
closest modern equivalent to witchcraft. 
Halberstam's account ofthe origins is better 
than Browne's, but the real roots of discon-
tent are touched on only peripherally. We 
get a glimpse of them in Halberstam's report 
that General Taylor after his first mission 
in 1960 recommended "broadening the base 
of the government, taking non-Ngo anti-
Communist elements into the Government; 
making the National Assembly more than a 
rubber stamp; easing some of the tight re-
strictions on the local press." The prescrip-
tion was for a little of that democracy we 
were supposed to be defending, but Diem 
would not take the medicine. The accumu-
lation of grievances, the establishment of 
concentration camps for political opponents 
of all kinds, the exploitation and abuse of 
the villages, the oppression of the intellec-
tuals, the appeal of the 18 notables in 1960, 
and the attempted military coup that year, 
"the long standing abuses" which finally led 
to the revolt, are not spelled out as they 
should be 2 and would be if U.S. reporters 
had more contact with the Vietnamese. In 
a flash of insight Halberstam writes: 
w The best aeeOunt is by the French his-
torian, Philippe Devillers in "North Vietnam 
Today" (Praeger, 1962), edited by P. J. 
Honey. 
Also, though we 'knew more about Vietnam 
and the aspirations of the Vietnamese than 
most official Americans, we were to some de-
gree lb-tined by our nationality. We were 
there, after all, to cover the war; this was 
our primary focus and inevitably we judged 
events through the war's progress or lack of 
it. We entered the pagodas only after the 
Buddhist crisis had broken out; we wrote 
of Nguyen Tuong Tam, the country's most 
distinguished writer and novelist, only after 
he had committed suicide?and then only 
because his death had political connotations; 
we were aware of the aspirations of the pea-
sants because they were the barometer of 
the Government's failure and the war's prog-
ress, not because we were on the side of the 
population and against their rulers. 
This accounts for how poorly these report-
ers understood the central problem of land 
reform, how few realized that from the stand-
point of the peasants, particularly in the 
Delta, Diem's land reform policy like his 
hated agrovilles and our equally unpopu-
lar strategic hamlets seemed to be mecha-
nisms for reinstating the rights of the land-
lords who had fled during the long war 
against the French. Diem's downfall, and 
the rebellion's success, were largely due to 
the fact that he tried to do what even the 
Bourbons in France after the Revolution 
were too wise to attempt. He tried to turn 
back the clock of the revolutionary land 
seizures in the name of land reform many 
peasants found themselves being asked to pay 
rent or compensation for land they had long 
considered their own. 
This lack of contact with the Vietnamese 
people, and this fellow feeling for the junior 
officers who were sure they could win the war 
if only HQ were different, also accounts for 
the weak way both books fizzle out when the 
authors try to supply some conclusions. 
Both oppose negotiation and neutralization. 
.naiberstam is indignant with the indiffer-
ence to Vietnam he encountered on his re-
turn home. He believes Vietnam "a legiti-
mate part" of "our global commitment." He 
feels "we cannot abandon our efforts to help 
these people no matter how ungrateful they 
may seem." For the "ungrateful" majority, 
the American presence had only succeeded in 
polarizing the politics of the country be-
tween authoritarian Communists and au-
thoritarian anti-Communists; the former at 
least have the virtue of being supported by 
native forces. The anti-Communist minority 
was grateful, of course, and feared that 
with American withdrawal they would be 
treated as mercilessly by the National Libera-
tion Front as Diem had treated veterans of 
Vietnam after 1954, although a specific 
provision of the Geneva agreement forbade 
persecution of those who had fought against 
the French. The files of the International 
Control Commission from 1955 onward were 
full of complaints that ex-Vietminh had 
been thrown into concentration camps or 
executed without charge or trial. In any 
eventual settlement in Vietnam, the future 
of minorities must certainly be a matter for 
concern, but the notion that we have a man-
date from heaven to impose on an unwilling 
people what we think is good for them will 
strike few Asians or Africans as an object 
lesson in democracy. Browne's feeble end-
ing is even worse. "Perhaps in the end," 
he writes, echoing the cliches of the counter-
insurgency experts at Fort Bragg, "America 
will find it can put Marx, Lenin, Mao, and 
Giap to work for it, without embracing com-
munism itself." 
This was the delusion of French military 
men like Colonel Lacheroy and Colonel Trin-
quier, who returned from Indochina 'Chink-
ing they could apply Communist ideas in 
reverse to the "pacification" of Algeria. 
When frustrated, they tried to turn ?their

sination against De Gaulle and the French

reeeese, the favorite:formula of our "counter-
insurgency" experts, does not make them any 
lees unpalatable or dangerous to a free so-
ciety. The basic tactic oonffises the effect 
with the cause. To see 'wars of liberation," 
the Pentagon's dominant nightmare, simply 
as a reflection of conspiracy, to overlook the 
social and economic roots which make them 
possible, to prescribe counterconspiracy as 
the cure, is not, only likely to insure failure 
but it tends to shut off debate on peaceful 
alternatives. Here the growing tendency of 
the Johnson administration to make it seem 
disloyal to question the omniconwetence of 
the Presidency is reinforced by the nattual 
tendency Of the Pentagon to see doubts about 
resort to force as unpatriotic. There is the 
danger here of a new McCarthyism as the 
administration and the military move toward 
wider war rather than admit earlier mistakes. 
[From the New York Times, Apr. 22, 1965] 
"DESCALATION" NEEDED 
The war in Vietnam is to be "stepped up," 
Washington now says. In other words, the 
U.S. Government is going to continue to 
bomb, send in more Antericans, spend more 
and commit more lives, Money, destructive-
ness and power?and take more risk. In 
return, the hope is that Hanoi will act to 
curb the Vietcong guerrillas in South Viet-
learn, if it can, and will refrain from sending 
in more men and arms and orders to the 
south. The hope also is that Peiping and 
Moscow will hold off from their own par-
ticular methods of escalation. 
Those who have all along feared that the 
course the war has been taking since early 
February would force the United States into 
an ever greater commitment, leading to ever 
greater danger to Asia and to the world, are 
unhappily being proved true prophets. Once 
a war begins, forces take over which seem 
beyend control. In Vietnam, on both sides, 
one step is leading?as if inexorably?to 
another and then another. Continuance of 
the present process by the opposing forces 
could lead to catastrophe. 
Nothing is more important for Americans 
today than to face these hard truths before it 
Is too late. And it is vital that the channels 
of communication, of opinion and of dissent 
be kept open?on the floor of Congress, in 
the press, in the country at large?in the 
face of a growing tendency to ridicule or to 
denounce the opposition and to demand un-
swerving support of further escalation in the 
name of patriotism. 
Bitterness and emotionalism are increas-
ingly entering the discusions on Vietnam in 
the United States. This is a deplorable de-
velopment, and so is the polarization of opin-
ion in every country and between blocs of 
countries. It is as if the battle lines were 
being drawn all over the world?but for a 
major war that need not and must not take 
place, 
President Johnson's offer of "unconditional 
discussions" was Et splendid move on the 
diplomatic-political front, in the effort to 
achieve a peaceful solution of the quarrel. 
While it deserved a far better response from 
the other side than it has yet received, it did 
mark, as we heve previously noted, a begin-
ning to an interchange among the combat-
ants?Subtle and indirect, but nevertheless a 
beginning. 
But the continued bombing of North Viet-
nam makes progress toward a peaceful set-
tlement?however far off it must necessarily 
be?more difficult rather than less, harder 
rather than easier. We think that as a fol-
lowelp to the President's fine declaration in 
Baltimore, a "descalation" of the war is 
needed, rather than the escalation that we 
now see imminent. 
It is at least worth the effort to see whether 
a sealing down of the bombing might not 
evOke a Corresponding scaling down of Neirth 
Vietnamese aggression in South 'Vietnam. 
The North Vietnamese incidents in the south 
are easily measurable; if a diminution of 
American bombing of the north should lead 
to a diminution in the rate of incidents in 
the south, a major step would thereby be sig-
naled toward the "unconditional discus-
sions" offered by the President. 
Of course there might be no such re-
sponse at all; and if there were not, the 
bombing would be resumed. But at least a 
"descalation" such as we suggest would af-
ford the opportunity to the other side of 
making a gesture toward peace without los-
ing face. It might lead, ultimately, to a 
cease-fire and a truce. 
President Johnson launched a very tenta-
tive but real peace offensive at Johns Hop-
kins. He has not yet given this policy 
enough time but the continued bombing has 
tended to cast some doubt on the sincerity 
the United States desire for negotiations. 
This is clearly a moment of crisis?for 
Vietnam, for the United States, and for the 
world. Less bombing, not more, offers some 
hope of peace?without any weakness of 
American resolution. By taking such an at-
titude the United States would show 
strength as well as wisdom.

IN THE NATION: THE SENATE ON VIETNAM 
(By Arthur Krock) 
WASHINGTON, April '21.?On the initiative 
of its majority leader, MIKE MANSFIELD, the 
Senate today responsibly fulfilled the role 
assigned to it by the Constitution to advise 
the President on foreign affairs. 
Senator Fenesiumee who, in his official ca-
pacity as chairman of the committee on 
which the Senate relies for guidance on 
these questions, has been subjected to un-
warranted abuse for stating as a mere hy-
pothesis that "the prospects for discussions" 
looking to peace in southeast Asia "might be 
enhanced by a temporary cessation" by the 
United States of the military actions it is 
steadily escalating in the Vietnams. But, 
except for specific endorsement of what Fun-
BRIGHT plainly identified as only a specula-
tion, all the Senate speeches today were di-
rected at the same objective, which MANS-
FLELD expressed as follows: 
APPLYING GENEVA PRINCIPLE 
It is of the utmoet importance that the 
question of how to apply the principle of 
the Geneva agreement of 1954 be faced as 
soon as possible. * * * The longer this con-
frontation is put off, the more the people 
of North and South Vietnam pay for the 
delay, and the more the likelihood that the 
present limited conflict will spread into a 
general war in Asia. 
His reference was to a proposal that the 
Geneva Conference be reconvened on the 
limited basis of producing an international 
guarantee of the neutrality of Vietnam's 
neighbor, Cambodia. "The need for a con-
frontation," he said,'"on [this] situation in 
which none [the United States, Communist 
China and the two Vietnams] is involved 
so directly may indeed be a preliminary to 
a separate and second confrontation on Viet-
nam in whieh the involvement of all is 
direct." And though MANSFIELD extolled the 
President as one who has "grasped the prob-
lem fully," citing his call for "unconditional 
discussions with the object of restoring a 
decent and honorable peace," it was evident 
from remarks by Senators who praised MANS-
FIELD'S observations that they detected in 
these their own doubts of the wisdom of 
escalating U.S. military attacks on North 
Vietnam while there is the slightest pos-
sibility of progress in the secret negotiations 
for reconvening a Geneva Conference on 
Cambodia. 
"While the talk goes on," said MANSFIELD, 
"the bloodshed also goes on. And the bleed-
ing is not being done in the capitals of the 
world. It is being done in the rice fields and 
the jungles of Vietnam" whose "peasants, it. 
all probability, want peace and a minimum o : 
contact with distant Saigon and distant. 
Hanoi?not to speak of places of which they 
have scarcely heard about?Peiping, Moscow. 
or Washington. This called attention to the 
officially inconvenient fact that the conflict 
is in part a civil war. 
CONFLICTING VIEWS 
Taking this from the majority leader tu; 
his cue, Senator AIKEN protested that "ii it,

speculating that a temporary halt of U.S. 
military actions against North Vietnam 
might be the best way to discover whether 
the aggressors are open to a reasonable and 
honorable settlement, suggest that this idea 
has no future in the administration. 
TO RESTORE PEACE 
President Johnson has more information 
than the Senate can possibly have for the 
alarm which MANSFIELD and others expressed 
on the floor. But the sole meaning to be 
read into Secretary McNamara's announce 
ment on the same day is that continued es 
calation of the Vietnam war on a steadily 
rising scale is our only policy for the restore - 
tion of peace in southeast Asia.

THE FALLING DOMINOES 
(By Walter Lippmann) 
Why is it, it is time to ask, that our posi - 
tion in Asia has declined so sharply though 
we are widening and intensifying the wa 
in Vietnam? 
According to the so-called domino theory, 
the United States would lose the respect and 
support of the peoples of Asia if, in confront-
ing Chinese communism, it showed itself 
to be a paper tiger, and refrained from mili-
tary action. For three months, since Febru-
ary, we have applied this theory ever more 
vigorously. And what are the results? Quite 
contrary to what was predicted: today the 
United States is not only isolated, but in-
creasingly opposed, by every major power in 
Asia. 
With the exception of Japan, which has 
government but not a people who support 
our policy, all the Asian powers are against 
us on this issue, not only China and Indo-
nesia, but the Soviet Union, India, and Pak-
istan. The crucial fact is that although the 
Asian powers are by no means at peace witn 
one another, what they do have in comma.). 
Is an increasingly vociferous opposition t3 
the escalated war we have been waging since 
February. India and Pakistan, India ani 
China, China and the Soviet Union are 
quarrelling to the point of war with one an-
other. But they are united in condemning 
our February war. 
The administration should put this fact 
in its pipe and smoke it. It should ponder 
the fact that there exists such general Asian

opposition to our war in Asia. The Presi-
dent's advisers can take some comfort, but 
mighty little, from thefact that aimed with 
us is the Thailand government in Bang-
kok, which is independent though weak, the 
government in Seoul, which we subsidize, 
the government in Taipei, which we protect, 
the government in Saigon, which governs 
something less than half of South Vietnam. 
Pondering the matter, we must, alas, put 
into the other scale the ominous, rising anti-
Americanism in the Philippines. 
The dominoes are indeed falling, and they 
are falling away from us. 
What is the root of all this swelling anti-
Americanism among the Asians? It is that 
they regard our war in Vietnam as a war by 
a rich, powerful, white, Western nation 
against a weak and poor Asian nation, a war 
by white men from the West against non-
white men in Asia. We can talk until the 
cows come home about how we are fighting 
for the freedom of the South Vietnamese. 
But to the Asian peoples it is obviously and 
primarily an American war against an Asian 
people. 
- In my view the President is in grave trou-
ble, He is in grave trouble because he has 
not taken to heart the historic fact that the 
role of the Western white man as a ruler 
in Asia was ended forever in the Second 
World War. Against the Japanese the West-
ern white powers were unable to defend 
their colonies and protectorates in Asia. 
That put an end to the white man's domi-
nation in Asia which had begun in the 15th 
century. 
Since then, despite our ultimate victory 
over the a apanese Empire, the paramount 
rule has been that Asians will have have to 
be ruled by Asians, and that the Western 
white powers can never work out a new rela-
tionship with the Asian peoples except as 
they find a basis of political equality and 
nonintervention on which economic and cul-
tural exchanges can develop. 
This great historic fact is an exceedingly 
difficult one for many westerners to digest 
and accept. It is as hard for them to accept 
this new relationship with Asia as it is for 
many a southerner in this country to accept 
the desegregation of schools and public ac- _ 
conumxlations. The Asia hands who still 
Instinctively think of Asia in prewar terms 
are haunted by Rudyard Kipling and the 
white man's burden and the assumption that 
East of Suez are the lesser breeds without 
the law. 
Until we purge ourselves of, these old pre-
conceptions and prejudices, we shall not be 
able to deal with Asian problems, and we 
shall find ourselves as we are today in Viet-
nam, in what the German poet described as 
the unending pursuit of the ever-fleeting ob-
ject of deSire. We shall find ourselves widely 
rejected by the very people we are professing 
to save. 
Until this purge takes place, we shall go 
on drifting into trouble. For us the prob-
lem in Asia is primarily a problem in our 
understanding_ of historic reality. In our 
view of Asia there will have to be a funda-
mental change akin to the illumination, 
which has come so recently here at home, 
that the American Negro must become a full, 
not a second class, citizen. 
The day will come when the same kind of 
illumination of the facts of life is granted to 
the makers of our policy in Asia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER, Is there 
further morning business? If not, 
morning business is closed. 
VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965 
Mr, MANSFIELD. Mr, President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Chair 
lay before the Senate the unfinished 
business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Chair lays before the Senate the unfin-
ished business, which is S. 1564. 
The Senate resumed the consideration 
of the bill (S. 1564) to enforce the 15th 
amendment of the Constitution of the 
United States. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment of the Senator from Delaware [Mr. 
WILLIAMS] numbered 82, to the commit-
tee substitute. 
Under the precedents of the Senate, 
in such a case, the substitute, for the 
purpose of amendment, is regarded as 
original text. Any amendment proposed 
thereto is therefore in the first degree, 
and any amendment to such amendment 
Is in the second degree, and not open to 
amendment. 
Any amendment to the original text 
of the bill, or any amendment to such 
an amendment, would have precedence 
over the committee substitute or any 
amendment thereto. 
In the event the committee amendment 
is agreed to, no further amendment is 
in order. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to call 
the roll. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, I can 
see the Continental Congress in session 
199 years ago. It was June. It was 
considering a resolution by Richard 
Henry Lee, of Virginia. The purport of 
the resolution was that the Colonies are 
and of right should be free and inde-
pendent States. That resolution was re-
ferred to a committee consisting of Jef-
ferson, Adams, Franklin, Roger Sher-
man, and Robert Livingston. Jefferson 
undertook the task of formulating a dec-
laration to carry out the sense of that 
resolution. What he wrote and what was 
approved was the Declaration of Inde-
pendence. 
How significant it is as a world docu-
ment and how highly it is esteemed in 
the American tradition can be noted 
from the care that has been lavished 
upon its preservation. First, it was 
kept in the archives of the State Depart-
ment. When the British invaded our 
Capital in 1812, it was removed to Vir-
ginia. When it was returned to Wash-
ington, it was kept in the Patent Office. 
Later it was placed in the Library of 
Congress. Today, it reposes in the Na-
tional Archives in a glass case, bound in 
bronze and sealed in helium that light, 
dampness, or insects will not mar it. 
One especial sentiment in that docu-
ment is appropriate to this occasion. 
After asserting that man is endowed with 
certain inalienable, God-given rights, 
-Jefferson then wrote: 
Governments are instituted among men, 
deriving their just powers from the consent 
of the governed. 
What a strange, amazing concept in a 
world of kings, czars, and emperors who 
had fastened upon mankind the belief 
that they rule by divine mandate. Was 
this a whimsy from the pen of the great 
Virginian? Was it a mockery or did it 
have purpose. How well we know that 
it did have purpose for it became the very 
foundation of the system of government 
which the Constitution makers promul-
gated in Philadelphia 11 years later. In 
his own way, Abraham Lincoln reaf-
firmed it at Gettysburg fourscore and 7 
years later when he expressed the prayer-
ful hope that government of the people, 
for the people, and by the people would 
not perish from the earth. 
How then shall there be government by 
the people if some of the people cannot 
speak? How obtain the consent of the 
governed when a segment of those gov-
erned cannot express themselves? 
How strange that nearly two centuries 
after Thomas Jefferson wrote those words 
into the Declaration of Independence, as-
suring to the governed a reasonable 
chance to consent or dissent, the prob-
lem still vexes the National Government. 
Can there be any doubt that this is the 
problem before us? 
Men are taxed but not permitted to 
pass upon those who impose such taxes. 
Can this be the consent of the governed? 
Men are compelled to render military 
service but not permitted to pass upon 
those who decree such service. Is that 
the consent of the governed? 
Men are fined and imprisoned under 
laws dealing with crime and social in-
fractions but not permitted to pass upon 
the authors of such laws. Is this the 
consent of the governed? 
Men are compelled to send their chil-
dren to schools which are supported with 
their taxes but not permitted to pass 
upon those who make the laws and issue 
the regulations under which their chil-
dren are educated. Is this the consent 
of the governed? 
Men pay for a variety of services such 
as gas, electricity, telephone service, rail-
road fares, airplane fares, the rates for 
which are predicated upon laws enacted 
by men whom they are not permitted to 
select. Is this the consent of the gov-
erned? 
Bloody strife and a century of history 
have brought no solution to the problem. 
The final fulfillment of the basic concept 
set forth in the Declaration of Independ-
ence has not been achieved. And now, 
100 years to the month after civil strife 
came to an end, we seek a solution which 
overrides emotion and sentimentality, 
prejudice, and politics and which will 
provide a fair and equitable solution. 
This is the fourth civil rights measure 
to come before Congress in the last 8 
years. The act of 1957 provided the right 
to go to court and to secure the aid of the 
Attorney General in providing injunc-
tive relief where voting rights were de-
nied. It also created the Civil Rights 
Commission with subpena power to make 
investigations in this field and repolt to 
the Congress. The act of 1960 enlarged 
the powers of the Attorney General to 
investigate and find a pattern or prac-
tice under which voting rights were de-
Wed gnd then file snit so that a court 
could issue an ,order showing that the 
plaintiff in the suit was qualified to vote.

8012 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE April 22, 19,65 
Then came the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
under which three-judge courts could 
deal with voting rights actions. But dis-
crimination in the matter of voting rights 
has continued and the data and infor-
mation collected by the Civil Rights Com-
mission and the Department of Justice 
makes it quite clear that additional legis-
lation is needed if the unequivocal man-
date in the 15th amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States is to be 
enforced and made effective and if the 
Declaration of Independence is to be 
made truly meaningful. 
Mr. President, that is a preliminary 
statement. / It does not undertake to 
deal with any analysis of the bill that 
is before the Senate. That will Come 
later. But I believe that it is necessary 
to lay down a philosophical predicate 
that is the inspiration for the endeavor 
that is before us at the present time. 
The story could be multiplied ad infin-
itum. One could deliver a long disserta-
tion, going back to an unsolved problem 
in the Constitution. The framers of the 
Constitution picked the year 1808 in 
which to continue the importation of 
persons. Parenthetically, the Consti-
tution does not use the word "slaves" or 
the word "slavery," but it speaks about 
the continued importation of persons 
until 1808, and provides that such im-
portation shall not be denied until that 
time. The only limitation on that trade 
was that there could be imposed a $10 
capitation tax. So importation con-
tinued. 
At long last, after 50 years and a 
bloody strife, that institution came to an 
end, and those people were here. The 
question was how to deal with them re-
alistically and recognize the fact that 
they were human beings. They were 
people with souls, and they were entitled 
to equality if the Declaration of Inde-
pendence and the Constitution meant 
anything whatsoever. 
After that strife came the 13th amend-
ment abolishing the hideous institution 
that had grown up in our country. 
Then in 1868 came the 14th amend-
ment, with a further expansion of rights, 
privileges, and immunities. 
Then came the 15th amendment in 
1870. That amendment dealt very spe-
cially with citizens of the United States. 
That is what we are concerned with at 
the present time. The amendment 
stated that the right of citizens of the 
United States to vote shall not be 
abridged or denied by the United States 
or any State on account of race or color. 
That is as short, as explicit, and as clear 
as the English language could make it. 
The authors of the amendment went 
further. They said that the Congress 
shall have power by appropriate legisla-
tion to enforce the amendment. 
It is on the basis of that authority that 
we proceed with the measure that is now 
before the Senate. 
Mr. President, this has been no easy 
chore. It has been one of the most diffi-
cult, Intricate, and abstruse subjects with 
which / have contact in all of my legis-
lative career. I am not insensible of 
those requirements by way of the quali-
fication for electors that appears in 
article I of the Constitution. But I am 
not insensible either to the mandate in 
the 15th amendment and how it shall be 
consummated and made effective. 
It has taken a long time, under the 
peculiar procedure that has inhibited 
some of our action, even to file a docu-
ment, which I presume I cannot call a 
"report." It is entitled "Joint Statement 
of Individual Views of Mr. DODD, Mr. 
HART, Mr. LONG Of Missouri, Mr. KENNEDY 
of Massachusetts, Mr. Balm, Mr. BUR-
DICK, Mr. TYDINGS, Mr. DIRESEN, Mr. 
HRIJSKA, Mr. FONG, Mr. SCOTT, and Mr. 
Javrrs of the Committee on the Judiciary, 
supporting the adoption of Senate 1564, 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965." 
I wish to pay testimony not only to 
the members of my staff, who are gracing 
the Senate Chamber today, but also to 
the staff of the majority leader and the 
staff of the Attorney General, because 
they worked until the hour of 11:58 last 
night, 2 minutes before the deadline that 
was set for the filing of this report. It is 
an excellent piece of work. Perhaps in 
the interest of acctirracy I had better 
strike that word "report" and say "the 
filing of this document." It is an ex-
cellent piece of work. Some time later 
I intend to read a good deal of the docu-
ment into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, 
because many hours and weeks of en-
deavor have gone into the document; and 
it deserves wider currency than a, report 
or a document usually receives. 
So at that point, I shall yield the floor. 
At a subsequent period, I shall begin to 
deal with an analysis of the bill and how 
we expect to remedy the difficulty that 
confronts us. 
Mr. ERVIN. Mr. President, will the 
Senator from Illinois yield for questions? 
Mr. DIRKSEN. I yield for questions. 
Mr. .b.HVIN. The bill contains a pro-
vision which condemns without judicial 
trial the States of Alabama, Mississippi, 
Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, and 
Virginia, and 34 counties in North Caro-
lina,; does it not? 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Yes; if the Senator 
will modify his language. 
First. I do not believe it condemns the 
States. It takes account of a condition 
that has existed in those States. 
Second. I do not for a moment admit 
that the bill is punitive. Surely I do not 
admit that it is a bill of attainder, a 
point that was made before the full 
committee. 
Mr. ERVIN. I presume that the Sena-
tor from Illinois will admit that the 
States that I have designated and the 
34 counties of North Carolina are 
brought within the provisions of the bill 
without being given any judicial trial to 
determine whether they are violating the 
Provisions of the 15th amendment. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. We are seeking by the 
bill to remedy a condition that exists in 
those States, or that we believe exists 
with respect to citizens of the United 
States. It is not a question of providing 
a judicial trial for various States where 
that condition exists. We go to the heart 
of the problem and seek to supply a rem-
edy that we think is constitutional and 
Is nonpunitive. 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. DIRKSEN. I yield. 
Mr. JAVITS. I do not believe we 
should allow the RECORD to stand with 
the statenient of the Senator from North 
Carolina that the bill condemns the 
States without a judicial trial. The fact 
is that the States can go into court in 
the District of Columbia. The bill so 
provides and establishes procedures by 
which they must take themselves out 
from under the provisions of the law. 
Therefore, there is a legal avenue 
through which they can act. The Sena-
tor from North Carolina has consistently 
reiterated that there is no opportunity 
for the States to go into court. I cannot 
agree with him. The fact is that the 
States must motivate, rather than that 
the United States must motivate, which 
has been the cause of the breakdown 
under the present law. 
Mr. ERVIN. I ask the Senator from 
Illinois if he does not know that under 
section 4 of the bill those States and 
counties cannot go into a court in the 
District of Columbia and rebut the pre-
sumption arising against them by show-
ing that they are not engaged in viola-
tion of the 15th amendment. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. The bill provides the 
method for the 'States to cleanse them-
selves of any taint, if they believe that 
the finger of taint has been placed upon 
them. 
Mr. ERVIN. I ask the Senator from 
Illinois if the bill does not shut every 
courthouse door in America against the 
States I have enumerated and the 34 
counties of North Carolina, except the 
U.S. District Court for the District of 
Columbia? 
Mr. DIRKSEN. My distinguished 
friend has used the expression "shut 
every courthouse door" in the land ex-
cept the U.S. District Court for the Dis-
trict of Columbia. The device of the 
court of the District of Columbia has 
been used in a great many other statutes. 
It is neither a restraint nor an infamous 
device that we resort to in connection 
with the bill to give a State an oppor-
tunity to make a test case in court. 
Mr. ERVIN. The Senator from Illinois 
seems to be reluctant to give a direct an-
swer to a direct question. I asked if un-
der the bill the sovereign States of Loui-
siana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, 
South Carolina, and Virginia, and 34 
counties of North Carolina are denied 
the right to go into any court, anywhere 
on the face of the earth, to defend them-
selves against the assumption or pre-
sumption, except the court of the Dis-
trict of Columbia. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. It is true up to that 
limited point, but no further. 
Mr. ERVIN. If they go into the U.S. 
District Court for the District of Colwn-
bia, they cannot escape the consequences 
of the act by showing that they are not 
engaged in denying any person the right 
to vote on account of race or color in 
violation of the 15th amendment. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. I shall take up that 
matter a little later. I do not wish to 
become involved in a prolonged discus-
sion of that point with the distinguished 
Senator from North Carolina. We shall 
get around to it later for a fuller analy-
sis.

tional policemen on foot patrol. By the end 
of the test period, felonies were down 5.5 
percent; robberies down 70 percent.; burgla-
ries down 65 percent; street "muggings" 
down 90 percent, At the same time, case 
clearance improved by 75 percent. The heat 
went on, and the bottom fell out of the 
crime rate. 
The big trump card of the progun debat-
ors is that the second amendment to the 
- Constitution flatly states, "the right of the 
people to keep and bear arms shall not be 
infringed," At least 35 State constitutions 
have similar guarantees. 
Actually, our rights predate the Constitu-
tion. Ancient common law holds that a 
man may arm himself and fight to defend 
his castle and its inhabitants and contents. 
Students of human rights insist that there 
Is another, still more important, right in-
volved. It is the "right to revolution." Be-
fore you flinch at that harsh term, remember 
that every democratic government on earth 
was born of armed revolution after tyranny. 
Revolution is the la,st resort of an oppressed 
people, and firearms are primary tools of rev-
olution. If our Government turned tyran-
nical tomorrow, armed Americans would 
surely try to do something about it. But not 
if they had no guns because a registration 
systern had permitted the tyrant to find and 
confiscate them. Every modern dictator has 
disarmed his subjects that way. 
This fear of confiscation, and the knowl-
edge that a bureaucrat with the power to 
Issue a permit will also have the power to 
deny one, are the big progun arguments 
against permits and registration, and legiti-
mate ones. (It is ironic that, in the absence 
of a national registration system, a hypothet-
ical tyrant?or invader?would probably use 
the membership files of the organizations 
most opposed to gun registration.) 
Should we have a_strong Federal law con-
trolling the sale and registration of all fire-
arms? 
J. Edgar Hoover, though a leader in the 
fight to reduce availability of firearms, espe-
cially handguns, says no. He flatly asserts: 
"The numerous ramifications of gun control 
are so varied and complex that regulatory 
measures must be at State and local levels." 
But Mr. Hoover goes on to say that "the 
public has a right to expect that the distribu-
tor and the purchaser of weapons, so deadly 
and easily concealed as handguns, meet cer-
tain regulations and qualifications." 
So the argument finally boils down to one 
of handgun control. Few, if any, of the re-
sponsible antigun people have any intention 
of taking away your deer rifle or duck gun, 
or of making you register it. Even New York 
has no restrictions on shoulder guns, which 
Is why the Sullivan law has withstood hun-
dreds of attacks on constitutional grounds. 
Unfortunately, not all of the antigun peo-
ple are either responsible or well informed. 
One well-meaning sociologist proposed that 
all guns should be kept in a public reposi-
tory, and checked out like library books for 
specific purposes and periods. He also sug-
gests that the gun owner be required to wear 
some distinctive article of clothing while 
going armed. 
Some subversives work quietly with the 
antigun people toward their ideal?a dis-
armed or disarmable population unable to 
oppose their kind of revolution. They are 
most dangerous in that they are unidenti-
fied infiltrators in more well-meaning groups. 
A few protectionists have taken the anti-
gun side in the hope that closer gun control 
will reduce the hunting that they do not 
believe in. However, most informed protec-
tionists are beginning to understand that 
legal, controlled hunting is not only desir-
able, but necessary, to the management of 
our Wildlife COnununity today. 
Finally, this milk be said: It is doubtful 
that a single one of the 300 new bills for gun 
control could have prevented the assassina-
tion of President Kennedy, Secret Service 
agents agree privately, and reluctantly, that 
there is no sure way to stop a killer who will 
use a long gun or who is willing to trade his 
life for the life of his victim. The only way 
to keep the President safe would be to keep 
him constantly in a bulletproof, bombproof 
shelter. President Kennedy would have 
scoffe,d at such a suggestion, and President 
Johnson already has. Mental defectives, of 
course, should be given treatment, kept 
under surveillance, and denied firearms of 
any kind. But again, it is a case of regulat-
ing the person, not the gun. 
Out of all these arguments on firearms 
problems and rights, these truths appear to 
us, and are our policy: 
We believe laws should prohibit sale of 
firearms to felons, drug addicts, habitual 
drunkards, juveniles, and mental incompe-, 
tents. We believe laws should invoke strict 
penalties against the possession of firearms 
by criminals and irresponsible persons. We 
believe laws should permit responsible, law-
abiding adults to own and use firearms for 
legal purposes. We believe laws should not 
require law-abiding adult citizens to register 
shotguns and rifles (Federal statutes already 
require manufacturers and dealers to keep 
records on the sale of handguns, rifles, and 
shotguns) We believe laws should not grant 
authority to any jurisdiction, police or oth-
erwise, at any government level, to prohibit 
the purchase or ownership of firearms by 
law-abiding and responsible citizens.

EXTENSION OF R 'RKS 
OF 
HON. WILLIAM G. BRAY 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 13, 1965 
Mr. BRAY. Mr. Speaker, the follow-
ing statement by George Meany, which 
appeared in the AFL-CIO News of April 
17, 1965, reiterates organized labor's firm 
stand in opposition to aggression and ef-
fectively refutes those who call for peace 
at any price: 
STATEMENT BY MEANT ON VIETNAM POLICY 
In his address of April 7, President John-
son offered to open the door to unconditional 
discussions on the crisis in Vietnam. Those 
who have been urging our Government to 
appease the Communist aggressors against 
the Vietnamese people have seized upon the 
word "unconditional" to conclude that our 
country's policy toward the conflict in Viet-
nam is now being basically changed. They 
would interpret the President's address to 
mean that we are now ready to appease the 
aggressors. 
Organized labor in our country has stead-
fastly opposed appeasement of all aggres-
sors?Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Mao Tse-tung, 
and Khrushchev alike. In continuation of 
this policy we have time and again supported 
President Johnson's firm rejection of all pro-
posals to appease the aggressors against the 
people of South Vietnam. 
Fortunately, the course outlined by the 
President, the national aims spelled out in 
his address, his determination to help the 
South Vietnam people maintain their inde-
pendenbe?all these clearly add up to any-
thing but appeasement, anything but waver-
ing or weakening in America's commitment 
to freedom for South Vietnam. 
Those who strive ahd struggle for peace 
will bp greatly encouraged by President 
Johnson once again making it clear to all 
Communist aggressors that "we will not be 
defeated. We will not grow tired. We will 
not withdraw, either openly or under the 
cloak of meaningless agreement." 
American labor welcomes President John-
son's reaffirmation of America's determina-
tion to achieve through diplomatic and ec-
onomic as well as military measures "an 
Independent South Vietnam securely guar-
anteed and able to shape its own relationship 
to all others, free from outside interference." 
This forceful reiteration of the basic aim 
of our Nation's policy in southeast Asia 
should eliminate all doubts as to American 
military action having any other objective 
than to provide a firm foundation for the 
peace, freedom, and economic development 
of this war-torn region. 
We are confident that the people of North 
Vietnam, if permitted, would gladly accept 
President Johnson's proposal that they join 
with their neighbors in a great effort to im-
prove their conditions of life and work rather 
than continue to suffer and sacrifice in a ter-
rible military conflict which can never be of 
any advantage to them. Any rejection of 
this generous American offer can only ag-
gravate their misery and suffering. This is 
the cruel fate which befell the people of the 
captive nations of Europe when their masters 
in Moscow prevented their benefiting from 
the Marshall plan aid. 
The people of South Vietnam, Berlin, and 
every other area in the shadow or terror of 
Communist aggression can draw encourage-
ment and strength from the President's timS-
ly assurance that the United States " will 
always oppose the effort of one nation to 
conquer another nation." We share the 
President's realization that this course must 
be pursued "because our own security is at 
stake." 
We also welcome the President's emphasiz-
ing that "the central lesson of our time is 
that the appetite of aggression is never satis-
fied" and that, in Vietnam or in any other 
part of the world where our country bears 
an international responsibility," we fight be-
cause we must fight, if we are to live in 
a world where every country can shape its 
own destiny. And only in such a world will 
our own freedom be finally secure."

Historic School Bill 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
.HON. WIWAM S. MOORHEAD 
istEleattvilitrA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPOSENTATIVES 
Monday, April 1, 1965 
Mr. 140011:HEAD. Mr. Speaker, ,the 
historic Elementary and Secondary Edu-
cation Act of 1.965 will benefit all Anieri-
cans. It will also benefit our children 
and our children's children. I call to 
the attention of Members of the House 
the following editorial on this landmark 
legislation from a reCept issue of the 
Fittsburgh Past-Gazette: 
HISTORIC SCHOOL BILL 
Of all the legislation that has been enacted 
by Congress since Lyndon Johnson became 
President?and there has been a considerable 
body of its?none more plainly bears his per-
sonal imprint than the Federal aid-to-edu-
cation bill which cleared the final legislative 
hurdle in the Senate last Friday. 
As the first successful product of nearly 
20 yearS Of effort in Congress to provide 
broad Federal support for public schools, the 
new measure is a testimonial to the remark-
able political generalship of Mr. Johnson. 
While passage of the bill was undoubtedly 
aided by the heavy Democratic majorities in 
both Houses, skilled leadership from the 
White House was clearly helpful in enabling 
the measure to weather souse floor debate 
With only a minor revision' and Senate floor 
debate with not a comma changed. 
This demonstration of political virtuosity 
does not mean, however, that the legislation 
is without fault. Its various provisions for 
public aid to parochial school students raise 
important questions among sincere people 
as to whether the constitutional bather be-
tween church and state is being breaohed. 
And the bill contains no clearcut method of 
getting these questions squarely before the 
Supreme Court. In order-to avoid a para-
lyzing battle among proponents of various 
views, the language of the measure was in-
tentionally made fuzzy?a technique which 
may give rise to additional problems, al-
though the hope is that these may be met 
hq amendments next year: 
- Whatever its shortcomings, the aid to edu-
cation measure is of momentous social sig-
nificance. Though it is aimed primarily at 
upgrading the education of children of-law-
n:mine families, funds from the act will he 
channeled into- an estimated 94 percent of 
the Nation's 26,000 school districts, Though 
the first year's $1.3 billion authorization 
for'building construction,iteacher ssdaries; in-
strilcticaial materials, special education,. and 
other projects, will amount to a fairly small 
fraction Of the total annual outlay forpub-
lic education, futnre Federal allocations are 
expected to rise, reaching $2.4 billion a year 
by 1968. This infusion of Federal support 
can hardly fail to have an uplifting effect 
on overcrowded and underequipped public 
educational facilities, not only directly rais-
ing their quality but hopefully also gen-
erating new support at local and State levels, 
from which the bulk of financing will still 
have to come. 
Some inferences as to the role of Federal 
aid in Pennsylvania may be drawn by com-
paring the anticipated allocations under the 
new statute with present State and local 
school expenditures. Total public spend-
f or elementary and secondary education in 
Pennsylvania now runs to more than $900 
million a year. About $62 million in Fed-
eral aid statewide will be added to this. The 
Pittsburgh school district's annual budget is 
some $40 million. Pittsburgh's share of Fed-
eral aid will be a roughly estimated $3 mil-
lion. 
Since regulations for the distribution of 
funds under the new law have not yet been 
drawn, no one can yet say whether Federal 
dollars for schools in poverty-stricken areas 
will enable the Pittsburgh School District 
and others to readjust their budgets so as 
to spend more for other needs. But Pitts-
burgh Superintendent Sidney P. Marland 
hopes there will be an across-the-board gain 
for education. Pittsburgh schools need 
whatever help they can get to achieve their 
long-term objectives of (1) building 20 new 
schools under a 5-year $50 million construc-
tion program, (2) hiring 600 new teachers to 
help reduce class sizes eventually to a de-
sirable 26 or 27 pupils, (3) Improving voca-
tional and counseling services, 
To the extent that the historic Federal 
aid statute can help Pittsburgh and other 
hard-pressed districts to achieve such goals, 
it will indeed be contributing to what Presi-
dent Johnson has visualized as the Great 
Society.

IN THE rtotrst OF REPRESENTATIVE'S 
Thursday, April 22, 1965 
Mrs. KELLY. Mr. Speaker, the night 
of Sunday, March 26, 1965, was a most 
noteworthy occasion. 
On that night, the Honorable MARGARET 
CHASE SMITH gave a dinner party to a 
dear friend and colleague, Congress-
Woman FRANCES BOLTON. 
I was so protid to have been included 
in this intimate group of family and 
friends. FRANCES is a most remarkable 
Person and a valiant woman and I am 
happy to be privileged to insert in the 
RECORD the transcript of an interview be-
tween these two great public servants. 
The interview follows:

Mr. EVANS. In the 87th Congress, there 
were 20 women, 2 in the Senate and 18 in 
the House of Representatives. Now, in the 
89th Congress, there are still 2 lady Sena-
tors, but only 10 women in the Hotta of 
Representatives. Representative BOLTON, 
how do you account for this? 
lVfrs. Bor.:rms. Oh, the men. 
Mr. EVANS. What's your opinion, Senator 
MARGARET CHASE SMITH? 
Mrs. SMITH. Oh, I think one reason is, that 
there aren't enough qualified women who 
run for office. 
Mr. EVANS Metromedia's "Opinion in the 
Capital" is honoring Representative PRANCES 
BOLTON on her silver anniversary in the Con-
gress of the United States. Senator MARGA-
RET CHASE SMITH is our special guest to pay 
tribute to her long-time friend. 
Representative Boraces', I detected a little 
bit of sarcasm in there when you said the 
men are responsible for the lack of women. 
Mrs. BOLTON. Well, you see what the linen 
did. They gerrymandered various districts 
on the Democratic side. They didn't do that 
on our side. 
Mr. EVANS. Did they gerrymander women 
out? 
Mrs. BOLTON. They gerrymandered women 
out, which I thought was too bad * * * they 
were fine women. 
Mrs. Slums. But, where were the women 
while they were doing this? 
Mrs. BOLTON. Well, they were only Demo-' 
crats mind you, I wouldn't know just wbere 
they were. 
Mr. EVANS. I think there should be a very 
fine distinction drawn here. There is a very 
great difference between politicians who are 
women and women in politics. 
Mrs. BOLTON. Oh, that's interesting. 
Mr. EVANS. I certainly think you are both 
women in politics. You're women first but 
I wonder why neither of you have ever mar-
ried again. 
Mrs. BOLTON. I thought one marriage was 
enough. 
Mr. EVANS. Well, you had a very good one 
then? 
Mrs. BOLTON. I had a very good one. 
Mr. EVANS. Margaret, have you ever 
thought of this? 
Mrs. SMITH. Yes, indeed, I thought cf it 
very seriously, back along?I haven't lately, 
I've been too busy. .I haven't had rr any 
offers. 
Mr. EvAars. Well, I'm sure this may pro-
voke some. Are there problems in this? 
Being in politics and leading this kind of 
life that would lead to another math ige? 
MTS. SMITH, I don't think there are too 
many problems. I don't know any reason 
why a woman couldn't be married and serve 
In public office as well as a than in public 
office being married. I think 'men and wo-
men work together, whichever way it is. 
Mr. EVANS. Both of you can In, and this 
iS probably a very cruel thing to say, but 
you both came in the back door of poli-
tics, Your husbands were in politics and 
you inherited the kingdom and have held 
them admirably since. 
Mrs. BOLTON. But remember, we had to 
be elected to it. 
Mr. EVANS. I know that, subsequently. - 
Mrs. 13ovroN. That's not just inheriting it. 
Mr. EVANS. No, I agree, but originally you 
inherited it. 
Mrs. Illoorost, Yes. No, oh no. We had 
to be elected. 
Mr. EVANS. I thought you had to be ap-
pointed. 
Mrs. BOI.TOIV. No, no. No appointments 
in Ohio. 
Mrs. SMITH. The Senate vacancies are filled 
by appointments in some States. But, the 
House is always by election, and we were 
both elected. I must say I think PRANCES 
had a tough election and campaign the first 
Mine. I'm sure that I did.

of scarcity the existing Uses of Colonel? River 
water in Arizona and in California to the ex-
tent of 4.4 million acre-feet would be given 
priority. Some people in California urged 
that my amendment terminate after 25 years. 
Their theory Wait that Congrees would provide 
California with additional water within such 
a period of time, But that Is a hail theory. 
Anyway, if Congress were to do so, no herrn 
would result from my amendment Contra-
wise, If Congress failed to de so, only one 
State would suffer. if the waters iii the river 
diminished. Our water agenciee objected to 
a 25-year guarantee. So did I. I suggested 
that it was like eating a man a life insur-
ance policy which provided that the policy 
would lapse if the Insured individual were 
to die. 
The truth is that it is becoming increas-
ing difficult to enact giant water projects. 
And I must frankly say that there are peo-
ple In Washington. in and out of Congress, 
who are somewhat averse to passing any 
legisletion helpful to our State. They lire 
blind to the fact that our Slate's popula-
tion increases 000,000 a year. They pooh-
pooh the free that tens of thelismets of rair 
school tint:alma attend ta:11001 coly Mai days 
because of a lack of fecilitee. 
At any rate, there is a groeeng danger of 
shortage in the river. borne day, and not 
too far in the future. the Pacific B.outhwest. 
is going to require the ineportetion of Sup-
plemental water from some surplus northern

Inevitable future growth. Arid lt.la going 
to take the beat exertions of all the Stetee

the necesaary Federal statutes. All 'his Col-
orado River State:, share tile problem in 
varying degrees. And It will be far baster, 
and the chances of legislative SUCCeSS le? 
far greater, If the States work together ef-
fectively rather than be ready to pounce at, 
eaeh other's throats. 
Where there Is a riek, common to two 
Stated or more, should not the risk It 
mitared? If there is clanger to two people. 
or to two States, why should one alone face 
it. Should they not stand together to repel 
It? That is the position of your southern, 
California water agencies, a potetion %Alien 
I wholeheartedly accepted from the begin-
ning. 
Several weeks ago in Washington, Secre-
tary of the Interior Udall called a meeting 
attended by Governor Brown, of California. 
Governor Goddard, of Arizona, Senators 
HAYDEN and FANNIN, of Arizona; and myself 
My California colleague, Senator idnaenly, 
was ussavoidably absent but Ids views mad 
mine are the same, and I spoke for both of 
its. We discussed the obvious need for ad-
ditional water supply to both our Settee. 
am glad to say it was agreed that, at long 
last, Arizona and California should loin 
forces as good Comrades and friends, oral 
that we should together seek the means by 
which to avoid a shortage of water in the 
river In the years and generations abeed. 
We generally recognized that existing uses 
of Colorado River water in both Arizona arid 
California ought to receive protection over 
new Uses which would come Into existeacia 
when, for example, the $1 billions central 
Arizona project would be built, as we krinw 
it, must and should be built. 
As a result of that meeting, legal repre-
sentatives of those in attendance and of our 
water agencies met to draft a bill. 
Here (I with to pay tribute to a great water 
lawyer, Northeutt Ely, whose experience, 
whose skill, and who Indefatigable energy 
have been of enormous benefit to our cause. 
He has performed valiant service to our 
State. He was the leader in drafting the 
present WI, and his advice has been of im-
measurable assistance to all of us who have 
Labored to ftnd a fair and equitable answer 
to a loaa and bitter :e.rugiee. I MUM, LOU, 
give thanks to your own Bob Will whose 
fidelity f,, this cause hats been constant, and 
whose help has been invaluable. 
The guarantee to California of 4.4 million 
;sore- feet ef Colorado River water annually 
.was written into the draft legislation. This 
proposed legislation recoguizes the validity 
end the integrity of California's claim. It 
provider that if there Is insufficient Colo-
ratio River water to supply 7.5 million acre-
feet of consumptive use, divergence to the 
central Arizona project shall be reduced to 
the extent necessary to supply 4.4 million 
acre-feet of existing Mies and decreased rights 
in California and to supply Mintier existing 
uses and rights In Arizona and Nevada as 
well It further provides that this protec-
tion shall remain In force until the Presi-
dent procielms that additional public weeks 
carry into the river, from an outside source, 
2.5 naillan ecre-feet of supplemental water. 
Thus, this proposal gives to California a 
guarantee against new water demands which 
the ,ientral Arizona project will create And 
when finally surplus waters in the north are 
transported thousands of tailea Into the 
Coa auto 'riser main stream, toy a iiew re-

ESIDENT JOHNSON'S RECENT 
VISIT TO MIDWEST HEARTENED 
CITIZENS OF OHIO 
Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Mr. President, 
a April 14 President Johnson person-
ly visited the tornado-ravaged sections 
Ohio and neighboring States. Our 
resident again demonstrated his deep 
)ncern over the problems faced by citi-
ms in distress. It was not satisfactory 
) Lyndon Johnson to receive factual re-
orts of the sad loss of life and of dam-
ge caused by this disaster. He had to 
ie firsthand the havoc and misery re-
ulting from this tragedy. 
Almost immediately help was forth-
*ming from many agencies of the Fed-
:ral Government. The Farmers Home 
A.dministration made available loans for 
'armers in this area unable to obtain as-
sistance from other sources. Officials of 
the Small Business Administration set 
up disaster loan offices for businessmen 
and homeowners in all of the stricken 
areas. Officials of the Office of Emer-
gency Planning established a disaster 
field office to facilitate that agency's role 
in supplementing State and local emer-
gency efforts. The President's visit did 
much to hearten and encourage families 
who suffered great hardship as a result 
of the tornado. 
Mr. President, upon his arrival at To-
ledo on April 14 and before his departure 
from that city on the same day, Presi-
dent Johnson made two brief speeches. 
They both express clearly our President's 
real and sincere concern in the welfare 
of all Americans. I ask unanimous con-
sent that his remarks be printed at this 
point in the RECORD as part of my re-
marks. 
There being no objection, the remarks 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
REMARKS OF THE PRESIDENT ON ARRIVAL AT 
TOLEDO, OHIO 
I am delighted to be here this afternoon 
with Governor Rhodes, Congressmen ASHLEy, 
SWEENEY, FEIGHAN, VANIK, LOVE, Bow, and 
MOSHER. 
I have visited today in three States. I have 
flown across and observed from the air six 
States. All these States were struck by the 
tragedies of this past weekend. 
I have come here this afternoon to Toledo 
to see firsthand, to look for myself at the 
extensive damages caused and to meet with 
your public officials to plan with them the 
support and the action that the Federal Gov-
ernment can take in assisting your city and 
your citizens to meet the challenge which 
has been inflicted so cruelly and so unex-
pectedly. 
No words of ours would be adequate to ex-
press the sympathy and compassion of the 
entire Nation for those who have suffered 
the loss of loved ones or injuries to members 
of their families. So I want each of you to 
know that we share with you the heavy-
heartedness that I know weighs upon you 
now. 
It is an American characteristic to be con-
cerned not about self alone but about the 
fate and the fortune of your neighbors and 
your friends under circumstances such as 
these. It is also an American characteristic 
for those who have suffered hardship and 
tragedies to turn quickly and hopefully to 
the task of reconstruction. 
Wherever we have gone throughout this 
long, long day I have seen that spirit and 
I have seen it in Americans and it is strong 
and it is sure. 
I would like to express to you my personal 
concern as evidenced by my presence here 
and my condolences. I would also, as your 
President, like to pledge to you the full co-
operation and support of your Government 
in working with your State and with your 
local officials to help overcome the losses 
that so many of you have suffered. 
Governor Rhodes was in contact with us 
yesterday. We told him then that the full 
facilities and power of the Federal Govern-
ment were at your disposal. We will be here 
today to take a firsthand look. We hope by 
the time we get back to Washington tonight 
we can have plans in the offing to relieve as 
much misery as possible and to begin our 
task of rebuilding. 
Unfortunately throughout the years we 
suffer from these disasters, and we can't help 
that, but once we have ttliem we can do some-
thing about it. That l's what I have come 
here to do. 
Thank you very much. 
REMARKS OF THE PRESIDENT ON DEPARTURE 
FROM TOLEDO, OHIO 
Governor Rhodes, Members of Congress, 
public officials, my dear friends in Ohio, for 
many years I have been coming to this won-
derful State and meeting its fine citizens. I 
always enjoy learning that I am scheduled 
to be here, and I always hate to leave. But 
for myself and all the people that traveled 
with me from Washington, this has been a 
day of both heartsickness and hopefulness. 
We have much to be thankful for. Each 
of us don't know how lucky we are until 
we see what has happened to our neighbors 
through no fault of their own. 
From the air and on the ground today we 
have seen destruction and desolation the 
kind of which I have never seen before in all 
of my life. It is of the very worst degree. 
When you think of the lives that are lost, 
the lives that have been changed, the lives 
which will forever bear the memory of this 
sad Sunday, when you look at the little boys 
with the holes in the top of their head, 
the mothers' homes that were there yesterday 
and now are gone they know not where, it is 
enough to bring tears to the eyes of any-
one. 
Yet, we have seen very few tears in these 
six States that we have visited today. At 
the very worst of the stricken neighborhoods 
we have seen the young, we have seen the 
old standing there shoulder-to-shoulder 
planning hopefully for tomorrow. 
Well, that is the purpose of our mission?
to come here to personally extend our sym-
pathy and our condolence, to try to learn 
and understand about what has happened, 
and then try to do something. 
There are talkers and there are doers, and 
there are people who believe in action, and 
there are people who put it on the back 
burner. But we want to be certain that 
everything is done as rapidly and as effec-
tively as it can be done. We want to re-
build for tomorrow. 
In a situation such as this, it is the role 
of the Federal Government to assist the 
States; for the President to work with the 
Governor; for the Governor to work with the 
mayors, and all of us to work together. While 
there are limits to what we can do, / want 
to pledge this afternoon to every citizen, to 
every community afflicted by the tornadoes 
or the floods, that your Government, and 
your President, will do everything conceiv-
ably possible to be of assistance under our 
laws. 
Before I leave, I want to congratulate espe-
cially the Governors, the mayors, and the 
local officials that we have talked to in these 
areas. Each of them are tremendously con-
cerned and want to do all they can. You 
have one of the finest delegations in the 
Congress, and each of those men are here 
with me today and are going back to roll up 
their sleeves and try to redo what was un-
done only yesterday and the day before. 
I am pleased by the ready, willing under-
standing, and the cooperation which exists 
7963 
between the Federal Government and the 
State of Ohio, between the Federal Govern-
ment and the local governments. Everywhere 
I have gone I have heard the very highest . 
praise for the performance of the National 
Guard, and the highway patrol, the State 
police, the local law-enforcement officers, as 
well as the Red Cross. I want to express my 
personal appreciation to each citizen who is 
giving much of himself to be helpful and 
useful to his neighbors and his community 
in these times of need. This is really Amer-
ica at its finest and at its best. 
I remember back when I was a youngster 
growing up. When adversity would overtake 
my family we would all pull a little bit 
closer together and try to be sorry for the 
things we said just the day before about 
each other?our brothers and our sisters, and 
maybe our fathers and our mothers. So, in 
this hour of adversity we are not concerned 
with titles or positions, we are not concerned 
with parties or politics. We are concerned 
with the country that we all love so much. 
As I speak here men are manning their 
stations 10,000 miles from here in order to 
protect the freedom that we enjoy here. And 
I hope that when we get ready to turn out 
the light tonight each of us will say a prayer 
for them, and also for these poor people who 
have suffered these great losses, suffered them 
with their chins up and their chests out, 
and who are ready to roll up their sleeves 
tomorrow when we build what has been taken 
from them. 
This has been a sad experience for me to-
day. It has been a long one that began at 
5:30 this morning. I am due to report to 33 
Senators at 6 o'clock in Washington this eve-
ning. And I am going to report to them on 
what is happening in Vietnam and what is 
happening out here in the heartland of Amer-
ica. I am so proud that / am privileged to 
live in a country and to lead a country like 
the United states, and one of the really best 
parts of that country is the State of Ohio and 
you people that live here. 
Thank you so much.

(S.J. Res. 1) proposing an amendment to 
the Constitution of the United States re-

Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, on April 
13, 1965, the House of Representatives 
passed the above-mentioned joint reso-
lution with amendments. Because of 
the substantial changes made, I move 
that the Senate disagree to the amend-
ments of the House of Representatives, 
that a conference be requested, and that 
the Chair appoint the conferees on the 
part of the Senate. 
The motion was agreed to; and the 
Presiding Officer appointed Mr. BAYII, 
Mr. EASTLAND, Mr. ERVIN, Mr. DIRKSEN, 
and Mr. HRUSKA conferees on the part of 
the Senate. 
Whereas Senate bill 1592 has been pre-
sented to Congress containing proposed 
amendments to the Federal Firearms Act; 
and 
Whereas Senate bill 1592 can in no way 
accoMplish its purpose of the suppression of 
crime in the United States, but contains pro-
visions which will abridge and encumber 
the right of law-abiding free people to own 
and bear arms; and 
Whereas such attempted legislation can 
lead to a further attempt to disarm the law-
abiding gun-owning public and hamper 
their ability of self protection: Now, there-

Resolved, That the Dallas Gun Club be 
recorded as opposed to the passage of Sen-

RESOLUTION OF THE SAN ANTO-

Mr. TOWER. Mr. President, the San

resolution concerning H.R. 6363. I com-
mend to the Senate the views of the as-
sociation upon the most pressing matter 
involved in this bill, and I ask that the 
association's resolution be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the resolu-
tion was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
Whereas the board of directors of the San 
Antonio Homebuilders Association supports 
the principal purpose of the National Labor 
Relations Act, as amended, namely, to foster 
peaceful relationships between labor and 
management throughout the Nation, includ-
ing the homebuilding and construction in-
dustry; and 
Whereas legislation (HR. 6363) has been 
introduced for consideration by the 89th Con-
gress which would change this law to permit 
a union within the industry to apply coercive 
picket and strike pressures against neutral 
employees and employers performing work at 
a construction site where such union has a 
primary labor dispute with another em-
ployer; and 
Whereas secondary strike or boycott pres-
sure against neutral and innocent employees 
and employers by such unions in the industry 
was outlawed by the Congress under this law 
in 1947, and reaffirmed in 1959 by passage of 
the Landrum-Griffin labor reform law, to 
protect and insulate such neutral parties 
from being injured through irresponsible and 
damaging acts of such unions; and 
Whereas picketing and strike coercion by 
construction unions against such neutral 
and innocent employees and employers not 
involved in the primary labor disputes will 
result in loss of employment by such em-
ployees and direct harm to the business of 
the neutral employer and cause increased 
home building and construction costs to the 
American home buyer and the Federal Gov-
ernment: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the board of directors of the 
San Antonio Flomebuilders Association urges 
Hon. RALPH W. YARBOROUGH and Hon. Jousr 
TOWER, U.S. Senators, and Hon. HENRY B. 
GONZALEZ, House of Representatives, 20th 
District, Texas, to oppose vigorously HR. 
6363 and similar bills which would make any 
change in the National Labor Relations Act's 
ban against secondary boycott strike and 
picketing by unions in the construction in-
dustry as destructive to the basic purpose of 
this law, contrary to the general public wel-
fare and as harmful special interest legis-
lation. 
Adopted this 6th day of April 1965, by the 
RESOLUTION OF THE McLENNAN 
COUNTY, TEX., CENTRAL LABOR 
COUNCIL CONCERNING VOTING 
RIGHTS 
Mr. TOWER,. Mr. President, the Mc-
Lennan County, Tex., Central Labor 
Council recently passed a most succinct 
and thoughtful resolution concerning the 
protection of voting rights. I support 
the council's determination that no 
American be denied the right to vote be-
cause of discrimination, and I ask unani-
mous consent that the resolution be 
printed at this point in the RECORD SO 
that other Senators may review it. 
There being no objection, the resolu-
tion was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
RESOLUTION TO PROTECT CONSTITUTIONAL 
RIGHTS 
Whereas organized labor's struggle for free-
dom was much like the present day struggle 
of Negroes for freedom; and 
Whereas by the events these past few days 
we have seen a basic freedom denied; and 
Whereas if the right to vote can be denied, 
the right to picket an employer while on 
strike can also be denied; and 
Whereas the President of the United States 
made a speech Monday night and introduced 
legislation that would protect the right to 
register to vote: Therefore be it 
Resolved, That the McLennan County

freedom; and be it further

out, or such wars of subversion will spread. 
I grant this seems a compelling argument, 
but it won't stand up under close analysis. 
Communist guerrilla wars didn't begin in 
Vietnam and won't end there, regardless of 
the outcome of this particular struggle. 
American muscle, sufficiently used, may hold 
the 17th parallel against infiltrators from the 
North, but our bayonets will not stop?they 
could even spread?Communist agitation 
within other Asian countries. A government 
may be checked by force, but not an idea. 
There is no way to fence off an ideology. 
Indeed, Communist-inspired guerrila wars 
have always jumped over boundary lines. 
They have erupted in scattered, far-flung 
places around the globe, wherever adverse 
conditions within a given country permit 
Communist subversion to take root. The 
threatened governments put down such guer-
rilla uprisings in the Philippines, Malaya, 
Burma, and Greece. The decision for Saigon 
hangs in the balance. 
This is a time of ferment. Some of these 
guerrilla revolts will succeed; others will fail. 
The outcome, in eabh case, will depend upon 
the character of the government challenged, 
and the willingness of the people to rally 
behind it. That some governments won't 
prove equal to the test is no reason for us 
to panic. The other governments in south-
east Asia are not so many dominoes in a 
row. They differ, one from another, in pop-
ular support and in capacity to resist Com-
munist subversion. We all hope Saigon will 
prevail, but the argument that "as goes South 
Vietnam, so goes all of southeast Asia," 
is predicated more upon fear than fact. 
Communism isn't going to take over the 
world; it is much too poor a system for that. 
Whether Saigon can meet the test remains 
to be seen. Until now, it has been losing its 
war, not for lack of arms, but for lack of 
internal cohesion. The Vietcong grow 
stronger, not because they are better sup-
plied but because they are united in their 
will to fight. This spirit cannot be imported 
from without. The weakness in South Viet-
nam emanates from Saigon itself, where we, 
as foreigners, are powerless to pacify the 
spoiling factions. Only the Vietnamese can

groups of Vietnamese shall govern the 
country. 
It is true, of course, that foreign powers 
are interested in the outcome of this struggle, 
China favoring Hanoi, the United States 
backing Saigon. But, again,, the involve-
ment of outside countries, even when it takes 
the form of limited intervention, doesn't 
change the essential character of the war. 
With the war in Vietnam at a point where 
neither side can achieve a conclusive mili-
tary decision, some kind of political settle-
ment has to be worked out. I cannot fur-
nish a precise blueprint for a peaceful settle-
ment. No one can at this point. But I can 
indicate, in general terms, a form of settle-
ment that lies in that middle ground that 
both sides must seek out if a negotiated 
settlement is to be reached. The timing of 
any settlement must, of course, be left to the 
President. He alone can know whether or 
when Hanoi appears willing to bargain. 
As for the United States, we can always 
deal at the conference table from a strength 
that rests not upon the softness of Saigon 
but upon our own possession of the sea and 
air. Therefore I believe we must demon-
strate that we cannot be driven out of 
Indochina, and that we won't bow to a Com-
miinist-dictated peace. Our recent bomb-
ings should make it clear to Hanoi that we 
will not quit under fire, or withdraw or sub-
mit to coercion. 
At the same time we should make it 
eqtally clear that we are prepared to nego-
tiate on honorable terms. The judicious 
use of both the arrows and the olive branch, 
clutched by the American eagle in the Presi-
dential seal, represents our best hope for 
avoiding a Korean-type war on the Aldan 
mainland. We should indicate our willing-
ness to interpose a neutral buffer zone in 
Indochina, consisting of Laos, Cambodia, 
and South Vietnam. Such a zone need not 
create a power vacuum for Chinese armies 
to fill. This is a more likely result, in the 
absence of such an agreement, of an ex-
panded war. The integrity of the neutral-
ized region against invasion from without 
could be guaranteed by the signatories to 
the agreement. Thus the military might of 
the United States would remain a deterrent 
to Chinese encroachment from the north, 
which is?or ought to be--our primary pur-
pose in southeast Asia anyway. During its 
transitional phase such an agreement could 
be policed by special forces of an interna-
tional commission, set up to preside over a 
cease-fire while political arrangements are 
worked out by the people of each country. 
Admittedly, this involves the unavoidable 
risk that pro-Communist elements may come 
to prevail, but the war itself?which sees 
Western forces increasingly pitted against 
Asians?has become the breeding ground of 
steadily growing political support for the 
Communist cause. As Prince Sihanouk, 
Cambodia's royalist ruler, has pointed out, 
the risk of Communist ascendancy after a 
settlement grows larger every day the war is 
prolonged. If this estimate is correct, and 
there is mounting evidence to support it, 
then the time to negotiate is now, while the 
anti-Communist elements in Indochina still 
posses authority. 
Now is the time, while the jungles and rice 
fields still belong to the Vietnamese, to 
strive for an end to the war. Hanoi has 
reason to bargain, for she covets her inde-
pendence and has cause to fear China. The 
same holds true for Laos, Cambodia, and 
South Vietnam. Even the Soviet Union has 
incentive to work for a settlement that 
will foreclose a Chinese occupation of 
southeast Asia. These propitious condi-
tions, all of which work in our favor, are like-
ly to be the first casualties of a widening 
War. 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I find 
myself also in agreement with the over-
all strategic position with respect to our 
foreign policy that is outlined from time 
to time by the distinguished columnist, 
Walter Lippmann. 
I ask unanimous consent that a column 
printed this morning in the Washington 
Post entitled "The Falling Dominoes," 
and an excellent article published in the 
April 26 issue of Newsweek magazine, en-
titled "The Test in Vietnam," both arti-
cles being by Mr. Lippmann, be printed 
at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

THE FALLING DOMINOES 
(By Walter Lippinann) 
Why is it, it is time to ask, that our 
position in Asia has declined so sharply 
though we are widening and intensifying the 
war in Vietnam? 
According to the so-called domino theory, 
the United States would lose the respect and 
support of the peoples of Asia if, in confront-
ing Chinese communism, it showed itself to 
be a paper tiger and refrained from military 
action. For 8 months, since February, we 
have applied this theory ever more vigorously. 
And what are the results? Quite contrary 
to what was predicted: Today the United 
States is not only isolated but increasingly 
opposed by every major power in Asia. 
With the exception of Japan, which has a 
government but not a people who support 
our policy, all the Asian powers are against 
us on this issue, not only China and Indo-
nesia, but the Soviet Union, India, and Paki-
stan. The crucial fact is that although the 
Asian powers are by no means at peace with 
one another, what they do have in common 
is an increasingly vociferous opposition to 
the escalated war we have been waging since 
February. India and Pakistan, India and 
China, China and the Soviet Union are 
quarreling to the point of war with one 
another. But they are united in con-
demning our February war. 
The administration should put this fact 
in its pipe and smoke it. It should ponder 
the fact that there exists such general Asian 
opposition to our war in Asia. The Presi-
dent's advisers can take some comfort, but 
mighty little, from the fact that alined with 
us is the Thailand Government in Bangkok, 
which is independent though weak, the gov-
ernment in Seoul, which we subsidize, the 
government in Taipei, which we protect, 
the government in Saigon, which governs 
something less than half of South Vietnam. 
Pondering the matter, we must, alas, put into 
the other scale the ominous, rising anti.. 
Americanism in the Philippines. 
The dominoes are indeed falling, and they 
are falling away from us. 
What is the root of all this swelling anti-
Americanism among the Asians? It is that 
they regard our war in Vietnam as a war by 
a rich, powerful, white, Western nation 
against a weak and poor Asian nation, a 
war by white men from the West against 
nonwhite men in Asia. We can talk until 
the cows come home about how we are 
fighting for the freedom of the South Viet-
namese. But to the Asian peoples it is 
obviously and primarily an American war 
against an Asian people. 
In my view the President is in grave 
trouble. He is in grave trouble because he 
has not taken to heart the historic fact that 
the role of the Western white man as a ruler 
in Asia was ended forever in the Second 
World War. Against the Japanese the West-
ern white powers were unable to defend their 
colonies and protectorates in Asia. That 
put an end to the white man's domination 
in Asia which had begun in the 15th 
tuz7. 
Since, then, despite our ultimate vie 
over the Japanese Empire, the paramc 
rule has been that Asians will have tc 
ruled by Asians, and that the Western w 
powers can never work out a new relati 
ship with the Asian peoples except as t 
find a basis of political equality and n 
intervention on which economic and clan 
exchanges can develop. 
This great histor'c fact is an exceedin 
difficult one for many Westerners to dig 
and accept. It is as hard for them to aca 
this new relationship with Asia as it is 
many a southerner in this country to ace( 
the desegregation of schools and public 
commodations. The Asia hands who St 
instinctively think of Asia in prewar ten 
are haunted by Rudyard Kipling and t 
white man's burden and the assumption th 
east of Suez are the lesser breeds with? 
the law. 
Until we purge ourselves of these o 
preconceptions and Frejudices, we shall in 
be able to deal with Asian problems, and a 
shall find ourselves, as we are today in Wei 
nam, in what the German poet described 
the unending pursuit of the ever-fleeting ob 
ject of desire. We shall find ourselves wide 
ly rejected by the very people we are pro 
fessing to save. 
Until this purge takes place, we shall gt 
on drifting into trouble. For us the prob-
lem in Asia is primarily a problem in ow 
understanding of historic reality. In out 
view of Asia there will have to be a funda-
mental change akin to the illumination 
which has come so recently here at home. 
that the American Negro must become a full, 
not a second-class citizen. 
The day will come when the same kind 
of illumination of the facts of life is granted 
to the makers of our policy in Asia.

THE TEST IN VIETNAM 
(By Walter Lippmann) 
The President's Baltimore address on Viet-
nam marked a certain change in our of-
ficial policy. For the first time he offered 
to engage in discussions with Hanoi without 
reserving the right to refuse discussions un-
less certain conditions (Which were riot 
specifically stated) were met first. 
Although this opened the door a little 
for discussions, there is no reason to expect 
a diplomatic settlement of the Vietnamese 
war in the near future. For the time being 
the outcome in Vietnam is being determined 
by the course of the war itself, and there 
is no disposition as yet on either side to 
avoid a military showdown. 
The scene of the showdown has been and, 
it seems certain, will continue to be in South 
Vietnam. It will be a showdown between the 
government in Saigon which we are sup-
porting and the Vietcong which Hanoi is 
supporting. The issue hangs in whether 
there can be a government in Saigon which 
is able to subdue the Vietcong rebellion, 
pacify the countryside, and get itself ac-
cepted by the preponderant mass of the peo-
ple in the greater part of South Vietnam. 
There is now no such government in Saigon. 
As a matter of fact, the Saigon government 
is in a critical position, having lost con-
trol of a large part of the countryside by 
day, of an even larger part at night. 
The United States has been committed, 
and never more strongly than by the Presi-
dent at Baltimore, to reversing the military 
trend in South Vietnam. The President has 
undertaken to make the Saigon government, 
which is near to defeat and collapse, into the 
victor in the civil war. This will take a let 
of doing, but the administration has decided 
that it will be possible to defeat the Vietcong 
in South Vietnam if it is deprived, as the 
President put it, "of the trained men and

allE OFFICIAL THEORY 
. is i,S the basis of the policy adopted in 
ear February, of putting increasing pres-
su on North Vietnam by bombings which 
cr nearer and nearer to the highly popu-
latl and industrialized centers around 
lififoi and Haiphong. The official theory is 
thu by these bombings we can deter Hanoi 
frtn supporting the civil war in the south 
aI even force Hanei to force the Vietcong 
t sk for peace, especially since we are off er-
i4 an attractive economic future if they do 
t s. We hope also that the bombings in

t north will inspire and enable the Saigon 
g ernment to rally the people and to win 
t e war. 
W? are now embarked on a crucial test of 
t Is theory. Can the Saigon government win 
t e civil War while we attack the Hanoi gov-
flaunt? 'the outcome of this test depends 
the first place on whether the govern-
ent in Saigon can acquire the military 
orale and muster the national support to 
second place on whether our bombing can 
hurt or frighten the North Vietnamese suf-
ficiently to cause them to stop supporting 
Ithe Vietcong rebellion and, indeed, to tell the 
Vietcong to desist. .The official policy as-
sumes that they will do that when they are 
hurt more 'than they can endure. Looking 
at it in a coldbloOded way, this is a test 
of a military theory. For my part, I am in-
clined to think that Hanoi will endure all the 
punishment that we dare to inflict. 
130M5ING CAN'T WIN 
1 I am assuming that we dare not and will 
not devastate the cities of North Vietnam 
and kill great masses of their people. I am 
I assuming that we shall not do this because 
we are too civilized, and also because the re-
action to such cruelty would be incalculable 
in every continent. 
The relatively moderate punishment we 
^ are inflicting we shall probably continue to 
inflict. I believe it will not force the North 
Vietnamese to their knees. They are, we 
must remember, a country of peasants. 
Their industries are comparatively primitive, 
and their capacity to do without the prod-
ucts of their industries is quite different 
from that, let us say, of a well-to-do, mid-
ale-class American community in an affluent 
suburb. Provided they get some food, which 
they can from China, they are not likely 
to quit and to do what we might want be-
cause their powerplahts and bridges and 
factories are demolished. What they are like-
ly to do if we make the north increasingly 
uninhabitable is to go south into South Viet-
nam. 
So, experience may show that our official 
theory of the war is unworkable. If It does, 
we shall have to do what we have already 
done several times in the course of our en-
tanglement in southeast Asia. We shall have 
to change our Minds. This is always a pain-
ful process, especially in a big, proud coun-
try. But it may have to be done, and it 
will be done best if we keep the problem 
open to free and resolute public debate. 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that another closely 
reasoned article which appeared in the 
New York TiMeS Magazine of April 18 
1966, by the distinguished political scien-
tist,' Hans J. Morgenthau, entitled "We 
Are Deluding " be Ourselves in Vietnam, 
, , 
printed at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
-as follows: 
WE ARE DELUDING OURSELVES IN VIETNAM 
(By Hans J. Morgenthau) 
The address which President Johnson de-
livered on April 7 at Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity is important for two reasons. On the 
one hand, the President has shown for the 
first time a way out of the impasse in which 
we find ourselves in Vietnam. By agreeing 
to negotiations without preconditions he has 
opened the door to negotiations which those 
preconditions had made impossible from the 
outset. 
By proposing a project for the economic 
development of southeast Asia?with North 
Vietnam a beneficiary and the Soviet Union 
a supporter?he has implicitly recognized the 
variety of national interests in the Commu-
nist world and the need for varied American 
responses tailored to those interests. By 
asking "that the people of South Vietnam 
be allowed to guide their own country in 
their own way,' he has left all possibilities 
open for the future evolution of relations 
between North and South Vietnam. 
On the other hand, the President reiterated 
the intellectual assumptions and policy pro-
posals which brought us to an impasse and 
which make it impossible to extricate our-
selves. The President has linked our in-
volvement in Vietnam with our war of inde-
pendence and has proclaimed the freedom 
of all nations as the goal of our foreign pol-
icy. He has started from the assumption 
that there are two Vietnamese nations, one 
of which has attacked the other, and he sees 
that attack as an integral part of unlimited 
Chinese_aggression. Consistent with this as-
sumption, the President is willing to nego-
tiate with China and North Vietnam but not 
with the Vietcong. 
Yet we cannot have it both ways. We 
-cannot at the same time embrace these false 
assumptions and pursue new sound policies. 
Thus we are faced with a real dilemma. 
This dilemma is by no means of the Presi-
dent's making. 
We are militarily engaged in Vietnam by 
virtue of a basic principle of our foreign pol-
icy that was implicit in the Truman doctrine 
of 1947 and was put into practice by John 
Foster Dulles from 1954 onward. This prin-
ciple is the military containment of commu-
nism. Containment had its origins in Eu-
rope; Dulles applied it to the Middle East 
and Asia through a series of bilateral and 
multilateral alliances. Yet what was an out-
standing success in Europe turned out to be 
a dismal failure elsewhere. The reasons for 
that failure are twofold. 
First, the threat that faced the nations of 
Western Europe in the aftermath of the 
Second World War was primarily military. 
It was the threat of the Red army marching 
westward. Behind the line of military de-
marcation of 1945 which the policy of con-
tainment declared to be the westernmost 
limit of the Soviet Empire, there was an an-
cient civilization, only temporarily weak and 
able to maintain itself against the threat of 
Communist subversion. 
The situation is different in the Middle 
East and Asia. The threat there is not pri-
marily military but political in nature. Weak 
governments and societies provide opportu-
nities for Communist subversion. Military 
containment is irrelevant to that threat and 
may even be counterprOductive. Thus the 
Baghdad Pact did not protect Egypt from 
Soviet influence and SEATO has had no bear-
ing on Chinese influence in Indonesia and 
Pakistan. 
Second, and more important, even if China 
were threatening her neighbors primarily by 
military means, it would be impossible to 
contain her by erecting a military wall at the 
periphery of her empire. For China is, even 
in her present underdeveloped state, the 
7967 
dominant power in Asia. She is this by vir-
tue of the quality and quantity of her popu-
lation, her geographic position, her civiliza-
tion, her past power remembered, and her 
suture power anticipated. Anybody who has 
traveled in Asia with his eyes and ears open 
must have been impressed by the enormous 
impact which the resurgence of China has 
made upon all manner of men, regardless of 
class and' political conviction, from Japan 
to Pakistan. 
The issue China poses is political and cul-
tural predominance. The United States can 
no more contain Chinese influence in Asia 
by arming South Vietnam and Thailand than 
China could contain American influence in 
the Western Hemisphere by arming, say, Nic-
aragua and Costa Rica. 
If we are convinced that we cannot live 
with a China predominant on the mainland 
of Asia, then we must strike at the heart 
of Chinese power?that is, rather than try 
to contain the power of China, we must try 
to destroy that power itself. Thus there 
is logic on the side of that small group of 
Americans who are convinced that war be-
tween the United States and China is in-
evitable and that the earlier that war comes 
the better will be the chances for the United 
States to win it. 
Yet, while logic is on their side, practical 
judgment is against them. For while China 
is obviously no match for the United States 
in overall power, China is largely immune 
to the specific types of power in which the 
superiority of the United States consists?
that is, nuclear, air and naval power. Cer-
tainly, the United States has the power to 
destroy the nuclear installations and the 
major industrial and population centers of 
China, but this destruction would not defeat 
China; it would only set her development 
back. To be defeated, China has to be con-
quered. 
Physical conquest would require the ? de-
ployment of millions of American soldiers 
on the mainland of Asia. No American mili-
tary leader has ever advocated a course of 
action so fraught with incalculable risks, so 
uncertain of outcome, requiring sacrifices so 
out of proportion to the interests at stake 
and the benefits to be expected. President 
Eisenhower declared on February 10, 1954, 
that he "could conceive of no greater tragedy 
than for the United States to become in-
volved in an all-out war in Indochina." 
General MacArthur, in the congressional 
hearings concerning his dismissal and In per-
sonal conversation with President Kennedy, 
emphatically warned against sending Amer-
ican foot soldiers to the Asian mainland to 
fight China. 
If we do not want to set ourselves goals 
which cannot be attained with the means 
we are willing to employ, we must learn to 
accommodate ourselves to the predominance 
of China on the Asian mainland. It is in-
structive to note that those Asian nations 
which have done so?such as Burma and 
Cambodia?live peacefully in the shadow 
of the Chinese giant. 
This modus vivendi, composed of legal in-
dependence and various degrees of actual 
dependence, has indeed been for more than 
a millennium the persistent pattern of Chi-
nese predominance on the mainland of 
Asia. The military conquest of Tibet is the 
sole exception to that pattern. The mili-
tary operations at the Indian border do not 
diverge from it, since their purpose was the 
establishment of a frontier disputed by both 
sides. . 
On the other hand, those Asian nations 
which have allowed themselves to be trans-
formed into outposts of American military 
power?such as Laos a few years ago, South 
Vietnam and Thailand?have become the 
actual or prospective victims of Communist

aggression and subversion. Thus it appears 
that peripheral military containment is 
counterproductive. Challenged at its pe-
riphery by American military power at its 
weakest?that is, by the proxy of client-
states?China or its proxies respond with 
locally superior military and political power. 
In specific terms, accommodation means 
four things: (1) recognition of the political 
and cultural predominance of China on the 
mainland of Asia as a fact of life; (2) liqui-
dation of the peripheral military contain-
ment of China; (3) strengthening of the 
uncommitted nations of Asia by nonmili-
tary means; (4) assessment of Communist 
governments in Asia in terms not of Com-
munist doctrine but of their relation to the 
interests and power of the United States. 
In the light of these principles, the alterna-
tive to our present policies in Vietnam would 
be this: a face-saving agreement which 
would allow us to disengage ourselves mili-
tarily in stages spaced in time; restoration 
of the status quo of the Geneva Agreement 
of 1954, with special emphasis upon all-Viet-
namese elections; cooperation with the So-
viet Union in support of a Titoist all Viet-
namese Government, which would be likely 
to emerge from such elections. 
This last point is crucial, for our present 
policies not only drive Hanoi into the wait-
ing arms of Peiping, but also make it very 
difficult for Moscow to pursue an independ-
ent policy. Our interests in southeast Asia 
are identical with those of the Soviet Union: 
to prevent the expansion of the military 
power of China. But while our present 
policies invite that expansion, so do they 
make it impossible for the Soviet Union to 
join us in preventing it. If we were to re-
concile ourselves to the establishment of a 
Titoist government in all of Vietnam, the 
Soviet Union could successfully compete 
with China in claiming credit for it and sur-
reptitiously cooperate with us in maintain-
ing it. 
Testing the President's proposals by these 
standards, one realizes bow far they go in 
meeting them. These proposals do not pre-
clude a return to the Geneva Agreement and 
even assume the existence of a Titoist gov-
ernment in North Vietnam. Nor do they 
preclude the establishment of a Titoist gov-
ernment for all of Vietnam, provided the 
people of South Vietnam have freely agreed 
to it. They also envision the active par-
ticipation of the Soviet Union in establish-
ing and maintaining a new balance of power 
in southeast Asia. On the other hand, the 
President has flatly rejected a withdrawal 
"under the cloak of a meaningless agree-
ment." The controlling word is obviously 
"meaningless," and only the future can tell 
whether we shall consider any face-saving 
agreement as "meaningless" regardless of its 
political context. 
However, we are under a psychological 
compulsion to continue our military pres-
ence in South Vietnam as part of the periph-
eral military containment of China. We 
have been emboldened in this course of 
action by the identification of the enemy as 
"Communist," seeing in every Communist 
Party and regime an extension of hostile 
Russian or Chinese power. This identifica-
tion was justified 20 or 15 years ago when 
communism still had a monolithic character. 
Here, as elsewhere, our modes of thought and 
action have been rendered obsolete by new 
developments. 
It is ironic that this simple juxtaposition 
of "communism" and "free world" was 
erected by John Foster Dulles' crusading 
moralism into the guiding principle of Amer-
ican foreign policy at a time when the na-
tional communism of Yugoslavia, the neu-
tralism of the third world and the incipient 
split between the Soviet Union and China 
were rendering that juxtaposition invalid. 
Today, it is belaboring the obvious to say 
that we are faced not with one monolithic 
communism whose uniform hostility must be 
countered with equally uniform hostility, but 
with a number of different conanunisms 
whose hostilities, determined by different na-
tional interests, vary. In fact, the United 
States encounters today less hostility from 
Tito, who is a Communist, than from De 
Gaulle, who is not. 
We can today distinguish four different 
types of communism in view of the kind and 
degree of hostility to the United States they 
represent: a communism identified with the 
Soviet Union?e.g., Poland; a communism 
identified with China--e.g., Albania; a com-
munism that straddles the fence between 
the Soviet Union and China?e.g., Rumania, 
and independent communism?e.g., Yugo-
slavia. Each of these communisms must be 
dealt with in terms of the bearing its foreign 
policy has upon the interests of the United 
States In a concrete instance. 
It would, of course, be absurd to suggest 
that the officials responsible for the conduct 
of American foreign policy are unaware of 
these distinctions and of the demands they 
make for discriminating sublety. Yet it is 
an obvious fact of experience that these of-
ficials are incapable of living up to these de-
mands when they deal with Vietnam. 
Thus they maneuver themselves into a 
position which is antirevolutionary per se 
and which requires military opposition to 
revolution wherever it is found in Asia, re-
gardless of how it affects the interests?and 
how susceptible it is to the power?of the 
United States. There is a historic precedent 
for this kind of policy: Metternich's military 
opposition to liberalism after the Napoleonic 
wars, which collapsed in 1848. For better or 
for worse, we live again in an age of revolu-
tion. It is the task of statesmanship not to 
oppose what cannot be opposed with a 
chance of success, but to bend it to one's 
own interests. This is what the President is 
trying to do with his proposal for the eco-
nomic development of southeast Asia. 
Why do we support the Saigon Govern-
ment in the civil war against the Vietcong? 
Because the Saigon Government is free and 
the Vietcong are Communist. By containing 
Vietnamese communism, we assume that We 
are really containing the communism of 
China. 
Yet this assumption is at odds with the 
historic experience of a millennium and is 
unsupported by contemporary evidence. 
China is the hereditary enemy of Vietnam, 
and Ho Chi Minh will become the leader of a 
Chinese satellite only if the tinned States 
forces him to become one. 
Furthermore, Ho Chi Minh, like Tito and 
unlike the Communist governments of the 
other states of Eastern Europe, came to 
power not by courtesy of another Communist 
nation's victorious army but at the head of a 
victorious army of his own. He is, then, a 
natural candidate to become an Asian Tito, 
and the question we must answer is: How 
adversely would a Titoist Ho Chi Minh, gov-
erning all of Vietnam, affect the interests of 
the United States? The answer can only be: 
not at all. One can even maintain the 
proposition that, far from affecting adversely 
the interests of the United States, it would 
be in the interest of the United States if the 
western periphery of China were ringed by a 
chain of independent states, though they 
would, of course, in their policies take due 
account of the predominance of their power-
ful neighbor. 
The roots of the Vietnamese civil war go 
back to the very beginning of South Vietnam 
as an independent -state. When President 
Ngo Dinh Diem took office in 1954, he pre-
sided not over a state but over one-half of a 
country arbitrarily and, in the intentions of 
all concerned, temporarily severed from the 
other half. He was generally regarded as a 
caretaker who would establish the rudiments 
of an administration until the country was 
united by nationwide elections to be heli in 
1956 in accordance with the Geneva accals. 
Diem was confronted at home with a nm-
bar of private armies which were politicely, 
religiously or criminally oriented. To he 
general surprise, he subdued one after a-
other and created what looked like a viale 
government. Yet in the process of creatig 
It, he also laid the foundatione for the pr3-
ent civil war. He ruthlessly suppressed 11 
opposition, established concentration cams, 
organized a brutal secret police, closed nea-
papers and rigegd elections. These polies 
inevitably led to a polarization of the polite 
of South Vietnam?on one side, Diem's fat-
fly, surrounded by a praetorian guard; on t.e 
other, the Vietnamese people, backed by te 
Communists, declaring themselves liberates 
from foreign domination and internal o)-
pression. 
Thus, the possibility of civil war was il-
herent in the very nature of the Diem regime. 
It became inevitable after Diem refused o 
agree to all-Vietnamese elections and, in tle 
face of mounting popular alienation, accer-
tuated the tyrannical aspects of his regime. 
The South Vietnamese who cherished free-
dom could not help but oppose him. Threat-
ened by the secret police, they went either 
abroad or underground where the Comrnu-
fists were waiting for them. 
Until the end of last February, the Gov-
ernment of the United States started frore 
the assumption that the war in South Viet-
nam was a civil War, aided and abetted?but 
not created?from abroad, and spokesmer 
for the Government have made time arm 
again the point that the key to winning the 
war was political and not military and wee 
to be found in South Vietnam itself. It wac 
supposed to lie in transforming the indiffer-
ence or hostility of the great mass of the 
South Vietnamese people into positive 
loyalty to the Government. 
To that end, a new theory of warfare called 
counterinsurgency was put into practice 
Strategic hamlets were established, massive 
propaganda campaigns were embarked upon 
social and economic measures were at least 
sporadically taken. But all was to no avail. 
The mass of the population remained in-
different, if not hostile, and large units oi 
the army ran away or went over to the 
enemy. 
The reasons for this failure are of general 
significance, for they stem from a deeply 
ingrained habit of the American mind. We 
like to think of social problems as technically 
self-sufficient and susceptible of simple, 
clear-cut solutions. We tend to think of 
foreign aid as a kind of self-sufficient, tech-
nical economic enterprise subject to the laws 
of economics and divorced from politics, and 
of war as a similarly self-sufficient, technical 
enterprise, to be won as quickly, as cheaply, 
as thoroughly as possible and divorced from 
the foreign policy that preceded and is to 
follow it. Thus our military theoreticians 
and practitioners conceive of counterin-
surgency as though it were just another 
branch of warfare like artillery or chemical 
warfare, to be taught in special schools and 
applied with technical proficiency wherever 
the occasion arises. 
This view derives of course from a com-
plete misconception of the nature of civil 
war. People fight and die in civil wars be-
cause they have a faith which appears to 
them worth fighting and dying for, and they 
can be opposed with a chance of success only 
by people who have at least as strong a faith. 
Magsaysay could subdue the link rebellion 
in the Philippines because his charisma, 
proven in action, aroused a faith superior to 
that of his opponents. In South Vietnam 
there is nothing to oppose the faith of the 
Vietcong and, in consequence, the Saigon 
government and we are losing the civil war. 
A guerrilla war cannot be won without the 
active support of the indigenous population, 
short of the physical extermination of that

population. Germany was at least consistent 
when, during the Second World War, faced 
with unmanageable guerrilla warfare 
throughout occupied Europe, she tried to 
matter the situation through a deliberate 
policy of extermination. The French tried 
counterinsurgency in Algeria and failed; 
400,000 French troops fought the guerrillas 
in Indochina for 9 years and failed. 
The United States has recognized that it 
is failing in South Vietnam. But it has 
drawn from this receognition of failure a most 
astounding conclusion. 
The United States has decided to change 
the character of the war by unilateral dec-
laration from a South Vietnamese civil war 
to a war of foreign aggression. "Aggression 
From the North: The Record of North Viet-
nam's Campaign To Conquer South Vietnam" 
is the title of a white paper published by the 
Department of State on the last day of Feb-
ruary 1965. While normally foreign and 
military policy is based upon intelligence?
that is, the objective assessment of facts?
the process is here reversed: a new policy 
has been decided upon, and intelligence must 
provide the facts to justify it. 
The United States, stymied in South Viet-
nam and on the verge of defeat, decided to 
carry the war to North Vietnam n.ot so much 
in order to retrieve the fortunes of war as 
to lay the groundwork for "negotiations 
from strength." In order to justify that new 
policy, it was necessary to prove that North 
Vietnam is the real enemy. It is the white 
paper's purpose to present that proof. 
Let it be said right away that the white 
paper is a dismal failure. The discrepancy 
between its assertions and the factual evi-
dence adduced to support them borders on 
the grotesque. It does ndthing to disprove, 
and tends even to confirm, what until the 
end of February had been official American 
doctrine: that the main body of the Vietcong 
is composed of South Vietnamese and that 
80 percent to 90 percent of their weapons 
are of American origin. 
This document is most disturbing in that 
it provides a particularly glaring instance 
of the tendency to conduct foreign and 
military policy not on their own merits, but 
as exercises in public relations. The Govern-
ment fashions an imaginary world that 
pleases it, and then comes to believe in 
the reality of that world and acts as though 
It were real. 
It is for this reason that public officials 
are so resentful of the reporters assigned to 
Vietnam and have tried to shut them off 
from the sources, of news and even to silence 
them. They resent the confrontation of 
their policies with the facts. Yet the facts 
are what they are, and they take terrible 
vengeance on those who disregard them. 
However, the white paper is but the latest 
instance of a delusionary tendency which 
has led American policy in Vietnam astray 
In other respects. We call the American 
troops in Vietnam advisers and have assigned 
them by and large to advisory functions, 
and we have limited the activities of the 
marines who have now landed in Vietnam 
to guarding American installations. We have 
done this for reasons of public relations, 
in order to spare ourselves the odium of 
open belligerency, 
There is an ominous 'similarity between 
this technique and that applied to the ex-
pedition in the Bay of Pigs. We wanted to 
overthrow Castro, but for reasons of public 
relations we did not want to do It ourselves. 
So it was not clone at all, and our prestige 
was taniaged far beyond what it would have 
suffered had, we worked openly and single-
mindedly for the goal we had set ourselves. 
Our very presence in Vietnam is in a sense 
dictated by considerations of public rela-
tions; we are afraid lest our prestige would 
suffer were we to retreat froni an untenable 
position. 
One may ask whether we have gained 
prestige by being involved in a civil war on 
the mainland of Asia and by being unable 
to win it. Would we gain more by being 
unable to extricate ourselves from it, and by 
expanding it unilaterally into an interna-
tional war? Is French prestige lower today 
than it was 11 years ago when France was 
fighting in Indochina, or 5 years ago when 
she was fighting in Algeria? Does not a 
great power gain prestige by mustering the 
wisdom and courage necessary to liquidate a 
losing enterprise? In other words, is it not 
the mark of greatness, in circumstances such 
as these, to be able to afford to be indif-
ferent to one's prestige? 
The peripheral military containment of 
China, the indiscriminate crusade against 
communism, counterinsurgency as a techni-
cally self-sufficient new branch of warfare, 
the conception of foreign and military policy 
as a branch of public relations?they are all 
misconceptions that conjure up terrible dan-
gers for those who base their policies on 
them. 
One can only hope and pray that the 
vaunted pragmatism and commonsense of 
the American mind?of which the Presi-
dent's new proposals may well be a manifes-
tation?will act as a corrective upon those 
misconceptions before they lead us from the 
blind alley in which we find ourselves today 
to the rim of the abyss. Beyond the present 
crisis, however, one must hope that the con-
frontation between these misconceptions 
and reality will teach us a long-overdue les-
son?to rid ourselves of these misconcep-
tions altogether. 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I find 
these articles far more persuasive than 
those by certain other columnists such 
as Marguerite Higgins and William S. 
White, who take what is to my point of 
view an unduly emotional and quite un-
sound position. 
I hope that the articles introduced to-
day will have some bearing on the final 
judgments made in the White House. 
SAVE AND STRENGTHEN THE 
UNITED NATIONS 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that a statement 
adopted by the National Executive Coun-
cil of the United World Federalists, on 
March 7, 1965, at New York City, en-
titled "Save and Strengthen the United 
Nations" be printed at this point in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the bro-
chure was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
SAVE AND STRENGTHEN THE UNITED NATIONS: 
A DECLARATION 
In 1961 the General Assembly of the United 
Nations designated 1965 as International Co-
operation Year, to celebrate the 20th anni-
versary of the founding of the United 
Nations. 
It was a good purpose but International 
Cooperation Year could turn out to be a 
grim, cynical joke unless certain present 
trends are soon reversed. The year 1965 may 
mark not only the 20th anniversary of the 
founding of the U.N. but also the beginning 
of its destruction. Either the nations and 
peoples of the world will revive the United 
Nations in 1965?or they will bury it, and 
with it the best hopes of humanity for sur-
vival in the nuclear age. And if the U.N. 
is allowed to die, mankind will have to create 
another world organization to take its place. 
The U.N. is in peril for one single, tragic 
reason: it was not made strong enough at 
San Francisco in 1945, nor has this been done 
in the intervening years. 
The United Nations can live only if it is 
granted independent life?only if it Is eh-
7969 
dowed in its own right with the necessary 
capacity to establish and preserve the peace. 
The U.N. does not now have that strength. 
It is allowed to act only with the consent of 
the nations affected by its actions. 
The peoples of the world deserve some-
thing better than to live in constant dread 
of world war III. With the development of 
mainland China's nuclear device, the people 
of the world can only hope that the neces-
sity for universal, enforceable world law will 
become too plain to be disregarded. They 
can only hope that the recent spectacle of 
the United Nations, unable to collect its 
dues, to decide its issues, indeed to vote at 
all on any question, will so shock the con-
science of the member nations that they will 
at last act to strengthen the U.N. The peo-
ple of the world can only hope that this is 
the darkest hour just before the dawn. 
Yet hope is not enough. 
Twenty years ago mankind wrote its hope 
for peace into the United Nations. That was 
before the first atomic bomb exploded on 
Hiroshima. After that event, mankind's 
hope for peace?and for survival itself?has 
rested primarily in the United Nations de-
spite its weaknesses. 
Today-20 years later and in the midst of 
International Cooperation Year?those 
weaknesses have been revealed by the Gen-
eral Assembly's recent display of impotence. 
Either the United Nations will be strength-
ened or it will wither away. 
The hour is at hand for a true world states-
man to arise and speak for man, to say that 
his nation is ready to vest in the United Na-
tions sufficient peacekeeping power to pre-
vent the existing world situation from plung-
ing mankind into the disaster of world war 
III. It is time for a world statesman to 
challenge all nations to propose the kind of 
United Nations that could effectively police 
peace and render justice. 
Now is the time for some nation to define 
the terms under which the United Nations 
could survive and develop. 
As Americans, we cherish such a role of 
world statesmanship for the President of the 
United States. Presented with what may 
well be the ultimate challenge of the ages 
of man, he would speak not only for his na-
tion but would voice the hope of all man-
kind. 
Adopted by National Executive Council, 
United World Federalists, March 7, 1965, 
New York City.

HUMPHREY BEFORE THE PACEM

PEACE ON EARTH 
(Remarks of Vice President HUBERT M. HUM-
PHREY before the Pacem in Terris Confer-
ence, New York City, February 17, 1965) 
The Scripture tells us to "pursue peace"?
and mankind has since the beginning of time 
condemned the horrors of war. If discord 
and strife, wars and the threat of wars have 
persisted throughout history, it is perhaps 
as St. Augustine says: "that men make war 
not because they love peace the less, but 
rather because their love their own kind of 
peace the /Imre." Yet men of peace of every 
kind and every land remember well the year 
1963. For in that fateful year a venerable 
apostle of peace left our world, leaving be-
hind a legacy which will endure for years to

come. Generations of men?young and old 
alike?will remember the final testament of 
that gentle peasant Pope, Pope John XXIII, 
the encyclical "Pacem in Terris," in which he 
left to men of all faiths, to men holding 
many concepts of peace, an outline for peace 
in our world which can be accepted by all 
men of good will. 
And if our generation can heed the part-
ing plea of the man whose work we honor 
at this Conference, generations yet to come 
may hope to live in a world where in the 
words of the late President Kennedy "the 
strong are just, the weak secure, and the 
peace preserved." 
It is a privilege and an honor to partici-
pate in this Conference dedicated to explor-
ing the meaning and the messages of "Pacem 
in Terris." It is particularly fitting that this 
convocation meet at the beginning of Inter-
national Cooperation Year. I am confident 
that your deliberations here will advance our 
world along the road to "peace on earth" as 
described by Pope John. 
The encyclical John XXIII presented to 
the world was a public philosophy for a nu-
clear era. Comprehensive in scope, his mes-
sage expounded a political philosophy gov-
erning relations between the individual and 
the state, relations between states, and rela-
tions between an individual state and the 
world organizations. 
"Pacem in Terris" continues and completes 
the social philosophy which the Pope had be-
gun a year earlier in his encyclical "Mater et 
Ma,gistra," in which he elaborated the prin-
ciples of social justice which should guide 
the social order. In "Pacem in Terris" he ex-
tended this philosophy to the world, concen-
trating now on relations between states and 
the role of the world community. 
This encyclical represents not a utopian 
blueprint for world peace, presupposing a 
sudden change in the nature of men. Rather, 
it represents a call to action to leaders a 
nations, presupposing only a gradual change 
in human institutions. It is not confined to 
elaborating the abstract virtues of peace but 
looks to the building of a world community 
governed by institutions capable of preserv-
ing peace. 
The Pope outlined principles which can 
guide the actions of men?all men regard-
less of color, creed or political affiliation--
but it is up to statesmen to decide how these 
principles are to be applied. The challenge 
to this conference is to provide statesmen 
with further guidelines for applying the phi-
losophy of "Pacem in Terris" to the problems 
confronting our world in 1965. 
I would like to direct my remarks princi-
pally to the questions of relations between 
states and to that of a world community. 
Pope John's preoccupation?and our preoc-
cupation today?is with an amelioration of 
international relations in the light of the 
dangers to mankind posed by the existence 
of modern nuclear weapons. The leaders of 
the world must understand?as he Under-
stood?that since that day at Alamogordo 
when man acquired the power to obliterate 
himself from the face of the earth, war has 
worn a new face. And the vision of it has 
sobered all men and demanded of them a 
keener perception of mutual interests and a 
higher order of responsibility. Under these 
conditions mankind must concentrate on the 
problems that unite us rather than on those 
which divide us. 
Pope John proclaimed that the issues of 
war and peace are the concern of all. States-
men?who bear a heavier responsibility than 
others?cannot ignore the implications for 
the survival of mankind of new discoveries 
in technology, biology, nuclear physics, and 
space. In this nuclear age the deliberate ini-
tiation of full-scale war as an instrument 
of national policy has become folly. 
Originally a means to protect national in-
terests, war today can assure the death of a 
nation, the decimation of a continent. 
Nuclear power has placed into the hands 
of men the power to destroy all that man has 
created. Only responsible statesmen?who 
perceive that perseverence in the pursuit of 
peace is not cowardice, but courage, that re-
straint in the use of forces is not weakness, 
but wisdom?can prevent present interna-
tional rivalries from leading to an inciner-
ated world. 
The confrontation between the United 
States and the Soviet Union over Cuba in the 
autumn of 1902 undoubtedly weighed 
heavily in the Pope's thinking and lent ur-
gency to his concern to halt the nuclear arms 
race. Addressing the leaders of the world, 
he stated: "Justice, right, reason, and hu-
manity urgently demand that the arms race 
should cease; that the stockpiles which exist 
in various countries should be reduced 
equally and slmultaneously by the parties 
concerned; that nuclear weapons should be 
bann,ed; and that a general agreement should 
eventually be reached about progressive dis-
armament and an effective method of con-
trol." 
This plea had special pertinence for the 
leaders of the United States and the Soviet 
Union, the principal nuclear powers. 
A few months later, President Kennedy 
demonstrated the U.S. commitment to the 
goal of peace. In a speech at American Uni-
versity in June of 1963, he called for renewed 
efforts toward a "more practical, more at-
tainable peace?based not on a sudden revo-
lution in human nature but on a gradual 
evolution in human institutions?on a series 
of concrete actions and effective agreements 
which are in the interest of all concerned." 
The leaders of the Soviet Union responded 
favorably. In October 1963, the United 
States and Soviet Governments signed a 
treaty banning nuclear tests in the atmos-
phere, in outer space and under water. This 
treaty won respect throughout the world for 
the United States and the Soviet Union?in-
deed for all nations who signed it. It has 
inspired hope for the future of mankind on 
this planet. And members of this audience 
will recall that the man who first proposed 
a test ban treaty way back in 1956?and who 
shares in the credit for its accomplishment?
is the U.S. representative to the United Na-
tions, Ambassador Adlai E. Stevenson. 
The nuclear test ban was the first step in 
the path toward a more enduring peace. 
"The longest journey begins with a single 
step," President Johnson has said?and that 
single step has been taken. 
Other steps have followed. 
We have resolved not to station weapons 
of mass destruction in space. A United Na-
tions resolution, jointly sponsored by the 
United States and the Soviet Union, called 
on all countries to refrain from such action. 
It was adopted by acclamation?without a 
single dissenting vote. 
This was a vital step toward preventing the 
extension of the arms race into outer space. 
This year the United States is cutting back 
on the production of fissionable materials. 
Great Britain and the Soviet Union have an-
nounced cutbacks in their planned produc-
tion of fissionable materials for use in weap-
ons. As President Johnson has stated, the 
race for large nuclear stockpiles can be 
provocative as well as wasteful. 
The need for instant communication be-
tween the United States and the Soviet 
Union?to avoid the miscalculation which 
might lead to nuclear war?was proven dur-
ing the Cuban missile crisis. Since that 
time, we have established a hotline between 
Washington and Moscow to avoid such mis-
calculation. 
The agenda for the future remains long. 
Among the measures needed to limit the 
dangers of the nuclear age are measures de-
signed to prevent war by miscalculation or 
accident. 
We must seek agreements to obtain saf e-
guards against surprise attacks, including a 
network of selected observation points. We 
must seek to restrict the nuclear arms race 
by preventing the transfer of nuclear weap-
ons to the control of nonnuclear nations; 
transferring fissionable materials from mili-
tary to peaceful purposes, and by outlawing 
underground tests, with adequate inspection 
and enforcement. The United States has 
offered a freeZe on the production of air-
craft and missiles used for delivering nuclear 
weapons. Such a freeze might open the door 
to reductions in nuclear strategic delivery 
vehicles. 
It is the intention of the U.S. Government 
to pursue every reasonable avenue toward 
agreement with the Soviet Union in limiting 
the nuclear arms race. And the President 
has made it clear that he will leave no thing 
undone, no mile untraveled to further the 
pursuit of peace. 
Today in the year 1965 we must recognize 
that the next major step in controlling the 
nuclear arms race may require us to look 
beyond the narrow United States-Soviet 
competition to the past. For the explosion 
of a nuclear device by Communiat China in 
1964 has impressed upon us once again that 
the world of today is no longer the bipolar 
world of an earlier decade. Nuclear com-
petition is no longer limited to two super-
powers. 
The efforts of the United States and Eu-
rope to enable the nations of Europe to have 
a greater share in nuclear defense policy? - 
without encouraging the development of in-
dependent national nuclear deterrents?con-
stitute a recognition of this. 
In addition to Europe, we now have the 
problem of finding ways of preventing the 
further proliferation of nuclear weapons in 
Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle 
East. 
With the explosion of the Chinese nuclear 
device several months ago?and the prospect 
of others to follow?it may be that the most 
immediate next step in controlling the nu-
clear arms race is the prevention of further 
proliferation of nuclear weapons in Asia. 
In view of the evident determination of 
the present Communist government of Main-
land China to use its limited nuclear capa-
bility it hopes to develop for maximum po-
litical and propaganda benefit, it is not sur-
prising that other modern Asian nations are 
tempted to build their own nuclear deter-
rent. 
But the nations on the perimeter of Com-
munist China are not alone. As President 
Johnson has stated, "The nations that do 
not seek national nuclear weapons can be 
sure that if they need our strong support 
against some threat of nuclear blackmail, 
then they will have it." 
If the need for preventing the prolifera-
tion of nuclear weapons is more immediate 
in Asia today, it is no leas important in 
Latin America, Africa and the Near East. 
All of these areas are ripe for regional arms 
pacts which would prevent these countries 
from developing nuclear weapons. Nuclear 
weapons would serve no useful purpose in 
preserving their security. The introduction 
of these weapons would provoke a rivalry 
that would imperil the peace of Latin Amer-
ica and Africa and intensify the present 
rivalries in the Near East. It would endanger 
the precarious economies of countries which 
already possess military forces too large for 
their security needs and too expensive to be 
maintained without outside assistance. 
Such nuclear arms control agreements 
should naturally be initiated by the nations 
of the area.. In Latin America, such an 
agreement has already been proposed. 
Should the nations of Latin America, of Afri-
ca and the Near East through their own in-
stitutions or through the United Nations, 
take the initiative in establishing nuclear 
free zones, they will earn the appreciation 
of all nations of the world. Containment in 
these areas would represent a major step to-
ward world peace.

Washington's strange course not only 
coreder, and even to act upon, controversial 
and forward-looking bills. 
Probgbly most important of all was the 
strong direction that came fLO/11 the Gov-
ernor's office. For the first time in the 
memory of many legislators the Governor 
not only proposed legislation, but he actively 
fought for it. 
Governor Avery presented an ambitious 
program?one to which he had largely com-
mitted himself during the 1964 campaign. 
But he would have achieved little of it 
without the second step?he showed the leg-
islature how it could be financed. And by 
accepting this responsibility for increased 
taxes instead of passing the buck to the leg-
islators as so many previous Governors have 
done, Avery won their respect and gained 
many successes. 
In addition he chose two experienced and 
knowledgeable men to serve as his liaison 
with the legislature?Odd Williams and 
Laurin Jones. Thus the Governor was aware 
at all times when one of his programs was 
in trouble, and he knew where the trouble 
lay. He spent many hours discussing dif-
ferences with individual legislators, and he 
argued forcefully and well for the things he 
wanted. The result was that he got most 
of them, 
Since. education played so large a part 
in this session, much credit also must be 
given to the efforts and ability of the two 
men who headed the education commit-
tees?Senator Joe Harder, Republican, 
Moundridge, and Representative John Bow-
er, Republican, McLouth. Both worked long 
and hard and were unyielding in their deter-
mination to insure legislation that would 
accomplish an improved system of schooling 
in Kansas an all levels. 
Even the voters deserve some credit. For 
this legislature has an unusual number of 
able and responsible members, both new 
and old, and without them, of course, the 
best leadership in the world could have 
accomplished nothing.

HON. JOHN SHERMA 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Thursday, April 22, 1965 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the Appendix of the RECORD an editorial 
entitled "The U.N. and Vietnam," pub-
lished in the New York Times of April 
4, 1965. 
I shall not comment on it because it is 
an eloquent expression of approval of the 
speeches made by the majority leader, 
the distinguished Senator from Montana 
[Mr. MANSFIELD], and the distinguished 
senior Senator from Vermont [Mr. 
AIKEN]. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE. U.N. AND VIETNAM 
The administrative's attitude toward 
United Nations action on Vietnam seems am-
bivalent, to say the least. A few days ago As-
sistant Secretary Harlan Cleveland spoke 
favorably of United Nations aid in opening 
V.etnain negotiations and in policing an ulti-
mate eettlernent. The next day the State 
Department took pains once again to deny 
that it was encouraging Secretary General 
Thant to play any role. 
makes it difficult for the United Nations to 
help, but downgrades the world organization 
It compounds the damage the State Depart-
ment inflicted on the U.N. last winter_ by its 
tactics on the Soviet debt issue. Those 
tactics?as Senator Ansmq., clean of Senate 
Republicans, pointed out a few days ago?
have weakened the United Nations just when 
its help is badly needed in southeast Asia. 
"International events of recent weeks,' 
the Vermont Senator said, "seem to have 
overwhelmed the capacity of this Govern-
ment for affirmative action, except in the 
military field." His trenchant comments on 
the U.N.'s peacekeeping role?and on Wash-
ington's efforts to force Moscow and Paris to 
pay for operations of which they disap-
proved?received the immediate endorsement 
of Majority Leader MANSFIELD. They deserve 
serious attention. 
The American attempt to force the Rut.. 
sinusto pay up or lose their General Assem-
bly vote under article 19 of the U.N. Charter 
"collapsed like a punctured balloon," Sena-
tor AIKEN said?and not simply because a 
majority of the member nations were reluct-
ant to go along. The main reason, in his 
judgment, was that the United States, after 
taking a tough line, "backed away" from a 
winning vote. It did so not only for fear of 
a Soviet withdrawal, but because such a vote 
would have set a precedent contrary to 
American national interests. 
"The United States now recognizes," Mr. 
AIKEN said, "that if it were in the position 
of the Russians or the French, it would prob-
ably react in the same way * * * (the United 
States) is unwilling and unable to force 
the United Nations to abide by article 
19 * * * (because it) is not willing to have 
article 19 applied to itself when its vital in-
terests are involved." 
What both Senators AIKEN and MANSFIELD 
were getting at was the explosion of new 
nations that has more than doubled U.N. 
membership to a present 114. A decisive 
two-thirds vete in the Assembly could now 
be made up of Countries which possess only 
10 percent of the U.N.'s population and pay 
less than 5 percent of its budget. As -a re-
sult the United States shares the Soviet de-
sire to increase the role of the Security Coun-
cil, where the major nations possess a veto. 
The real issue behind the financing of 
peacekeeping operations, as Senator AIKEN 
points out, "involves the readjustment of 
power and influence between the greater 
powers and the lesser nations rather than a 
struggle between the Soviet bloc and the 
West." 
There is a problem of U.N. solvency?$110 
million is needed to save the world organiza-
tion from bankruptcy. And there is a need 
to work out new methods of authorizing and 
financing future peacekeeping operations. 
There is also a need for a Soviet financial 
contribution, which Moscow has acknowl-
edged. But there is no need to force the 
U.S.S.R. to comply with article 19 by paying 
the exact sum Washington says?and Moscow 
denies?it owes. 
As Senator AIKEN observed, President 
Johnson now "has a magnificent opportunity 
to put the United States back into the lead 
in international diplomacy by putting the 
United Nations back into business." And 
his first move should be to "instruct his 
representative to the united Nations to recon-
cile our position with the Soviet and French 
position on the assessment of members for 
peacekeeping functions?a view which may 
shock some, but a position which would defi-
nitely be in our own national interest * * *. 
Article 19 is dead as a doornail anyway." 
It is essential to move now not only in the 
long-term interests of the United Nations 
but precisely because a vigorous U.N. could 
play a vital role in extricating the United 
States and the two Vietnams from their 
present tragic predicament. 
School Aid Bill Can Be Most 
Meaningful of Any 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. WILLIAM R. ANDERSON 
GP TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, Apr21 22, 1965 
_ Mr. ANDERSON of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, one of our Nation's truly great 
newspapers, the Nashville Tennessean, 
has carried an editorial which describes 
the impact that the recently enacted 
Elementary and Secondary Education 
Act will have on my home State of Ten-
nessee and the Nation. The President 
and the Congress are to be commended 
for the reasons so well described in this 
excellent editorial. 
The editorial follows: 
[From the Nashville Tennessean, Apr, 11, 
1965] 
SCHOOL AID BILL CAN BE MOST MEANINGFUL 
OF ANY 
Congress has now passed and sent to the 
President a $1.3 billion blueprint for aiding 
the Nation's elementary and secondary 
schools. It was a major victory for President 
Johnson, and it could well be the most mean-
ingful legislative action of this session. 
Both Tennessee Senators ALBERT GORE and 
Ross BASS voted for the legislation. Senator 
BASS was presiding officer for part of the 
session which produced approval of the 
measure. 
In the House, Representatives MURRAY, 
BRocx, DUNCAN, and QUILLEN voted "no." 
The measure passed is not perfect, and 
there are several areas in which refinements 
could doubtless be made. Neither is it a 
landmark in terms of policy, since the Fed-
eral Government has been aiding education 
since the Land Grant College Act. It is a 
milestone, however, since a general bill of 
this kind has been the subject of congres-
sional wrangling for some 20 years. 
The two major obstacles to previous legis-
lation have been constitutional questions 
about providing aid to parochial schools and 
the issue of racial segregation in public 
schoola. The latter issue has become all but 
moot. In this case the religious issue has 
been skirted by providing aid only through 
public channels. Parochial pupils may bene-
fit by attending some classes in public in-
stitutions on a "shared time" basis and from 
use of school libraries, and teaching aids. 
But the books and aids remain public prop-
erty. 
The main emphasis of the school aid pro-
gram is on helping students in economically 
burdened areas. One billion sixty million 
dollars will go to help school districts with 
projects to better educate children of poor 
families; $100 million will be used to ease 
the widespread need for more and better 
school libraries. Another $100 million will 
be earmarked to set up educational centers 
to provide specialized programs that indi-
vidual schools cannot afford. 
It is estimated that more than 90 percent 
of the Nation's 26,000 school districts would 
receive funds. Tennessee's share of this 
might well amount to $30 to $35 million. 
The bill contains provisions throughout 
requiring States to submit their plans for 
using the new aid, but forbidding Federal 
officials from attempting to dictate local 
school policy. It also bars use of any funds 
for supporting religious _instruction or wor-
ship. 
The greatness of any nation must rest in 
large part on the education of its youth. 
Now, in the swift pace of technological

change, this Nation cannot afford to neglect 
any of its children in whose hands the future 
must be shaped. 
There was a time in the development of 
this Nation when brawn could find Its own 
place in the scheme of things. That day is 
passing. Now it is imperative that the new 
generation be given full opportunity to de-
velop its skills, talents, and creativity that 
will not be just desirable, but mandatory in 
the years ahead. 
President Johnson has every basis for be-
ing pleased at passage of the bill which can 
be a broad step toward the victory of enlight-
enment over darkness. 
Address by Vice President Humphrey at 
the Azalea Festival 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. A. WILLIS ROBERTSON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Thursday, April 22, 1965 
Mr. ROBERTSON. Mr. President, 
one of the most spectacular festivals an-
nually celebrated on the east coast is the 
International Azalea Festival, at Norfolk, 
Va. Norfolk, now the largest city in the 
Old Dominion, and one of its most pro-
gresSive, has developed an Azalea Park 
which rivals, if it does not excel, the 
famed Azalea Gardens of the historic 
city of Charleston. Thousands of tour-
ists are attracted to Norfolk at this sea-
son of the year, to witness that inspiring 
spectacle of the rebirth of nature; and 
added interest will be given to this festi-
val this year through the participation 
of our distinguished Vice President, Hon. 
HusEix H. HumPHREY. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the Appendix of the RECORD 
the addresS which Vice President HUM-
PHREY delivered at the Azalea Festival 
luncheon today, in Norfolk. 
There being no objection, the address 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
aS follows: 
THE AZALEA FESTIVAL ? 
(Address by Vice President 1117BERT Et Hine-
r/1XE/ , International Azalea Festival 
luncheon, Norfolk, Va., Apr. 22, 1965) 
serve, direct, and utilize all this country's 
vast human resources. We will meet these 
challenges if we realize the full potentialities 
of this country and each of its citizens. 
This administration and this Congress, act-
ing out the Will of the American people, are 
providing to the world our answers to these 
challenges. 
We are building a solid, lasting base for 
American health and growth. 
Health and growth built on a strong and 
flourishing economy?and we have just cele-
brated-Our 50th consecutive month of unin-
terrupted prosperity, I might add. 
Health and growth which can give via the 
means to provide a social system with justice 
at its heart. 
Health and growth to provide sustained 
American leadership in the world. 
President Johnson told this Congress, on 
the first day of its session, that: "Our Nation 
was created to help strike away the chains 
of ignorance and misery and tyranny wher-
ever they keep man less than God means him 
to be." 
We are not afraid to say it: We will work 
until every citizen of America has equal op-
portunity to make a better life for himself 
and his children. Only when this equality 
of opportunity is achieved can we truly find 
the freedom we seek. 
Today in this country we are making great 
strides toward achieving that goal. 
There are two basic forces at the heart of 
OUT progress: 
First, the vigorous leadership of Lyndon 
Johnson. 
Second, the unprecedented peacetime unity 
of our Nation which now exists. 
There is another word for this unity. It 
is consensus. 
Consensus is voluntary agreement based 
on constructive dialog, mutual respect, and 
understanding. In consensus, we Americans 
are breaking through. 
United we stand. And united we gain. 
We gain together as a great national con-
sensus says all Americans shall have equal 
voting rights. And that consensus today is 
truly national, not regional. 
We gain as our Nation agrees that all 
Americans shall have an education which 
can give them the opportunity to live them-
selves. 
We gain in agreement that all Americans 
shall have adequate medical care; 
That we should make our cities better 
places in which to live and work in safety 
and health; 
That we should preserve this Nation's 
beauty, history, and natural resources; 
That We should give the aging hope for 
life and work; 
That we should open our doors again to 
initnigrants who can enrich and lend new 
vitality to our national life; 
That we should help our urban and rural 
Americans alike adjust to technological rev-
olution and social change; 
That we should not drop the torch of in-
ternational leadership; 
That we should make whatever investment 
is necessary to realize our American dream. 
That investment will be great. But it will 
be less than the cost of illiteracy?of school 
dropouts?of poverty?of discrimination?of 
disillusion and bitterness?of isolation in the 
world. Far less. 
For example: We spend 6450 per year per 
child in our public schools, but we spend 
$1,800 a year to keep a delinquent in a de-
tention home, $2,500 a year for a family on 
relief and 63,500 a year for an inmate in a 
State prison. 
.We nitist make the investment necessary 
so that all in our society may be productive. 
Poor and uneducated people- are poor con-
sumers. They are a drain on our economy. 
They are wasted resources. 
With continuing support of the American 
people, we will continue now and in the years 
My friends, it is my honor to be invited to 
address this International Azalea 5'e5tival 
luncheon. For this great festival celebrates 
not only the well-being' and prosperity of 
Virginians and Americans, but celebrates also 
this country's cbmmitment to interdepend-
ence among nations, 
Today I would like primarily to discuss 
with you our well-being at home?and then 
to place that domestic well-being in the con-
text of the role we Americans play in the 
World. 
? Today, our democratic society faces great 
challenges. We are being challenged both at 
home and abroad by great political, economic, 
and social forces. 
Will we be able to meet these challenges: 
Can democratic government provide for the 
general welfare: 
Is freedom incompatible with responsi-
bility? 
Is democracy as a system able to provide 
rapid and just progress for the hungry and 
disaffected on our planet? 
Must the fulfillment of the individual be 
subordinate to the welfare of the whole? 
We will meet these challenges if we pre-
R003001500224-9 
april 22, 1965 
to come to make the basic investments nece.'s-
sexy to answer "yes" to our future. 
We will continue to forge a strong' econ-
omy, unmarked by recessions. We will con-
tinue to search for and develop tools to 
overcome the so-called business cycle. 
We will continue to explore outer space-
and inner mind in development of knowl-
edge for use by all the world. 
And we will continue to defend and pre-
serve the precious peace with strength and 
perseverance. 
We will maintain our strong and active 
faith in the ability of freemen?developed 
to their fullest?to build a better life for 
themselves and for others. 
Now, before clOsing, would like to direct 
a few personal words to you about America 
and its role in the world. 
For a long time we Americans have stood 
for the belief that the world need not destroy 
itself by war, and that we Americans can 
help others, too, find a better society. 
We hear many voices these days saying 
that America is overextended in the world?
that other people's problems needn't be our 
problems?that we ought to close up shop 
overseas and enjoy our blessings here in the 
good old United States of America. 
My friends, when that time comes, this 
Nation is doomed. Who in the world will 
work for democracy if we do not? Who in 
the world can preserve the peace if we do 
not? Who in the world can set the example, 
can offer the needed hand, if we do not? 
We live in a time when everything is 
complex, when there are no more rapid or 
easy answers. We live in a time when we 
must retain our patience as never before. 
Have we the patience, for instance, tc 
work and bleed 5,000 miles from home for 
months and years ahead?without any guar-
antee of finial success? I can tell you that 
the forces of totalitarianism have that pa-
tience. 
This is what the Great Society is all about. 
It is the recognition that vacations abroad, 
fur coats, and electric toothbrushes are not 
enough. It is the recognition that we stem. 
for something not seen before in the world. 
We stand for the dignity and fulfillmen 
of individual man and woman. 
We stand for the chance for each man to 
make something better of himself. 
We stand for free speech and government 
of the people. 
We stand for peace without conquest. 
We stand for the belief that others in less 
fortunate places should have opportunity for 
the blessings of abundance and should la3 
free of tyranny. We stand for the pledges 
made by men and women who left the oal 
ways and fought a living out of the soil of 
new continent. 
As President Johnson expressed it in his 
historical speech at Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity: 
"We will not be defeated. 
"We will not grow tired. 
"We will not withdraw." 
We 'will stand, at home and abroad, fcr 
the pledges made and efforts expended by 
Americans who came before. We must love 
freedom and justice enough to practice them. 
America is still the last, best hope on 
earth. 
A New Offer on Vietnam 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS

OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 1965 
Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, the 
now famous speech by President Johnson

stating that we remain ready for "un-
conditional discussions" on the Vietnam 
situation was criticized by the Commu-
nist powers and by a few Americans 
prior to the time that it became appar-
ent that it placed the United States on 
the diplomatic offensive; but, I have not 
seen many, in depth, interpretations of 
the situation by those who approved 
which weighed the various, factors in-
volved as well as did an editorial in the 
Des Moines Register on Friday, April 9, 
1965. So that those who receive the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD will have an op-
portunity to read it, I am inserting it in 
the RECORD. It is as follows: 
A NEW OFFER ON VIETNAM 
In one heartfelt outpouring Wednesday 
night, President Johnson put together the 
two contrasting sides of U.S. policy in the 
Vietnam war. One is the determination not 
to accept defeat, open or disguised, and the 
other is willingness to make peace, today or 
10 years from now, on generous terms. 
The President himself called his speech a 
review of a position stated "over and over 
again 50 times and more?to friend and foe 
alike." Yet in impact and emphasis, and in 
certain details, it was new. 
New was the little phrase in connection 
with possible peace talks: "We remain 
ready?with this purpose?for unconditional 
discussions." 
Previous statements usually have given the 
impression that the United States had a 
condition?that it was not willing to start 
discussions until North Vietnam had given 
some sign it was stopping its help to the 
Vietcong fighters in South Vietnam. 
The U.S. "purpose" in any such discussions 
is "an independent South Vietnam"?not the 
reunited Vietnam called for in the 1954 
Geneva agreements. The President defined 
this independent South Vietnam as one "se-
curely guaranteed and able to shape its own 
relationships to all others?free from out-
side interference?tied to no alliance?a 
military base for no other country." This 
would mean an ultimate end to U.S. inter-
vention no less than North Vietnamese. 
Another new detail in President Johnson's 
talk Wednesday was the way he spelled out 
his hopes for peaceful cooperation in eco-
nomic development for the whole of south-
east Asia. He referred directly to the U.N. 
preliminary work already going on and said 
the first step would be for the southeast 
Asian countries to get together on a plan. 
He hoped Secretary General U Thant would 
work with them to initiate the plan. 
New also was the figure of $1 billion which 
he said he would ask Congress to put up as 
the "American investment in this effort when 
It is underway." 
Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and South Viet-
nam have been working on the preliminaries 
of just such a plan for 7 years now, in spite 
of civil wars, diplomatic breaks, coups, and 
foreign interventions, under United Nations 
auspices. North Vietnam could be brought 
in to the benefit of all. It would be the logi-
cal place to use some of the power generated 
by a dam in Laos. 
Late in March, when President Johnson 
first held out the olive branch of coopera-
tive peaceful development as an alternative 
to war and mutual destruction in Vietnam, 
the proposal had the weakness of seeming a 
thing of words, without any U.S. planning 
to make it a reality. 
On April 7, the President remedied this 
weakness by announcing that Eugene Black, 
former president of the World Bank, will 
head a tea.in to get the U.S. part of the job 
started?not even waiting for peace, Black 
Is a superb choice, a man of demonstrated 
ability in this very difficult field of develop-
ing the underdeveloped. His appointment is 
a convincing sign to other countries that the 
offer of economic aid is not mere propaganda. 
President Johnson is sensitive to world 
opinion, to U.S. opinion. He knows how 
much alarm and disapproval has been stirred 
up by his bombing raids into North Vietnam. 
He remains convinced that the raids are a 
necessary part of keeping South Vietnam 
from collapsing. 
But he understands also that war is hell?
for the long-suffering Vietnamese people, the 
brave Vietcong fighters as well as the U.S.-
backed South Vietnamese. Since February, 
North Vietnam, too, is suffering direct hits 
as well as the drain of blood and treasure 
from intervention in the South. 
Neither side can win the way things are 
going. Both can win, if President Johnson's 
olive branch is grasped. 
Proposed Reduction in Funds for Soil 
Conservation Service 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. WALTER F. MONDALE 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Thursday, April 22, 1965 
Mr. MONDALE. Mr. President, re-
cently I received a thoughtful and 
thought-provoking letter from the Presi-
dent of the Minnesota Farmers Union, 
Edwin M. Christianson. 
Mr. Christianson's remarks pointedly 
and powerfully define the irrational and 
unfounded basis upon which the pro-
posed reduction in funds for the Soil 
Conservation Service and the agricul-
tural cost-sharing program is predicated. 
Furthermore, Mr. Christianson's remarks 
eloquently dramatize the stake which 
each American has in the encourage-
ment of sound conservation practices. 
Of particular salience, I think, is Mr. 
Christianson's recommendation that the 
President direct the Secretary of Agricul-
ture to prepare and publish annually a 
"soil fertility balance sheet." 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
that Mr. Christianson's letter be printed 
In its entirety in the Appendix of the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the letter 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
MINNESOTA FARMERS UNION, 
St. Paul, Minn., March 30, 1965. 
Hon. WALTER MONDALE, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR MONDALE: The national in-
ventory of soil conservation needs which was 
made public this week by the Department of 
Agriculture presents some very impelling 
reasons why the ACP and SCS funds should 
not be reduced, but why they ought to be 
increased. 
The proposed budget reduction of $100 
million for ACP would be false economy con-
sidering the vast amount of work needed. 
Similarly, the proposal to charge farmers 
for $20 million of the cost of SCS techni-
cal services would certainly hinder the pro-
gram. 
Without question, in the light of the low 
income prevailing on many farms, the need 
to absorb more of the cost of soil conserving 
projects would cause many farmers to de-
lay work which is needed in the ubli 1 - 
A1929 
terest, If the cuts are made, reliable esti-
mates are that ACP and other farm con-
servation project starts may drop by as much 
as 50 percent. 
Much of the work done under ACP and 
SCS does not result in immediate cash bene-
fits to the owner of the land. It is done 
to retain and improve the land capability 
for the future. Therefore, the public has 
a stake in assuring that conservation meas-
ures be undertaken by individual farmers 
and they ought to provide a substantial 
incentive for doing so. 
The soil and water conservation inven-
tory shows that nearly two-thirds of the 
rural land, near to 900 million acres, is in 
immediate need of conservation treatment. 
In this USDA study, you will find a projec-
tion of the trend of cropland into non-
farm uses, which will, by 1975, amount to 21/2 
million acres in the Lake States and 20 mil-
lion acres nationally. This will throw an 
additional burden on the remaining crop 
acreage. 
The soil and water conservation inven-
tory is a study of major importance in put-
ting our conservation needs in perspective. 
In our opinion, however, it is not enough 
for such a study to be made and published 
once in every 5 or 10 years. We believe 
that the time has come for Congress to 
direct and authorize the Secretary of Agri-
culture to calculate and publish annually a 
national "soil fertility balance sheet" so that 
the people of the Nation will have the op-
portunity to know what progress is being 
made. 
Soil and water conservation is vital to all 
of us. 
Sincerely, 
EDWIN CHR/STIANSON, 
President.

Thursday, April 22, 1965 
Mr. FULTON of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, President Johnson's recent Bal-
timore speech on Vietnam held out the 
promise of economic assistance to south-
east Asia as a means of settliag that 
area's problems. There has been criti-
cisms from responsible quarters and 
spokesmen of this possible approach. 
In an editorial published Friday, April 
9, 1965, the Nashville Tennessean raises 
a very basic question which those who 
find fault with the President's offer of 
economic assistance as an alternative to 
war must answer: Are we to put a greater 
value on American dollars than we do 
on American lives? 
Mr. Speaker, under unanimous con-
sent, I insert the editorial from the Nash-
ville Tennessean at this point: 
THE REPUBLICANS REACT IN A VERY CURIO/TS 
WAY 
Some of the Republican reaction to Presi-
dent Johnson's speech has been, to say the 
least, disappointing. 
Senator Evcricrr MCKINLEY DIRRSEN said 
the President "offers a billion-dollar lure 
as a step toward peace in Vietnam." And 
he asked, "Do we actually buy peace with 
an Ameripan aid program?"

A1930 CONGRESSIONAL/ RECORD ? APFEN April  
Aside from Mr. DIRKSEN'S rather loose in-
terpretation of the Johnson speech, can it 
be that the Republican Senate leader is put-
ting a greater value on American dollars 
than he puts on American Lives? 
This Nation now is and has been expend-
ing its treasure and its blood in support-
ing South Vietnam. If that war should sud-
denly escalate into a major clash of land 
armies and the intervention of Red Chinese 
forces into Vietnam, Senator DIRKSEN can 
be assured that a billion dollars will be a 
small part of the eventual cost and that 
America will weep over the totals of dead. 
It takes a very casual Interpretation of 
Mr. Johnson's speech to come up with the 
idea that it was somehow a plea which was 
suing for peace, or an offer to buy peace 
from Hanoi at the price of a billion dollars. 
And it is even a stranger interpretation 
that glosses over the words of the President 
jand finds a no-win policy or a trumpet 
sounding retreat. 
For the President said: "We will not be 
defeated. We will not grow tired. We will 
not withdraw, either openly or under the 
cloak of meaningless agreement. We will 
use our power with restraint, and with all 
the wisdom we can command. But we will 
use it." 
If Senator DIFcKSEN hears this as an un-
certain trumpet, he is tone dear. 
If it has suddenly become a sign of weak-
ness to urge warlike leaders to beat their 
swords into plowshares; if the olive branch 
has all at once become a symbol of retreat, 
then this Nation and all humanity are rid-
ing the tumbrel cart downhill. 
President Johnson said to all southeast 
Asia that there is another road to the fu-
ture besides that of destruction, of bombs 
and bullets and blood. But Senators DIRK-
SEN and TOWER and Representative GERALD 
Foss leave the impression they would rather 
achieve peace the hard and bloody way. 
Therein is illustrated the difference be-
tween the statesmanship of peace and the 
politics of opposition. 
? Castro's Real Coup in Cuba 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. MELVIN R. LAIRD 
OF WISCONSIN 
/N nsa HOUSE OF' REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 1965 
Mr. LAIRD. Mr. Speaker, a very per-
ceptive and enlightening article on the 
methods Castro employed to entrench 
and solidify communism in Cuba is con-
tattled In the April 1965 issue of Report 
magazine, The article, "Castro's Real 
Coup in Cuba," was written by Alberto 
Martinez Piedra, a neighbor and friend. 
Mr. Piedra was formerly a professor of 
economics in Havana and currently 
teaches at Catholic University in Wash-
ington, D.C. Knowing that the analysis 
contained in this article would be of in-
terest to my colleagues, I include it 
under unanimous consent at this point 
in the RECORD. 
The article referred to follows: 
CASTRO'S REAL COUP IN CuBA 
(By Alberto Martinez Piedra) 
When Fidel Castro came to power in Janu-
ary 1959, everybody thought his long struggle 
for victory had been achieved. Castro him-
self knew differently. For himself, and for 
the few others who knew he was a Commu-
nist, it was just the beginning. 
Communism did not come to power when 
Castro emerged from the hills and seized the 
rule from Batista. It came to power after-
ward and right before everyone's eyes. The 
amazing story of Castro's real takeover is one 
of deception, division, and destruction played 
out in the midst of the Cubans themselves, 
and all too often with anti-Communists as 
the unwitting allies of Castro's clever game. 
It is a tactic which continues today in Cas-
tro's relations with the rest of the hemi-
sphere. 
According to classical Communist doctrine, 
a country goes over to socialism because of 
the inherent injustices of a capitalist society. 
Exploitation leads to class war; capitalism 
destroys itself; finally the people triumph. 
In the same way that the Red Army dis-
proved this 'theory in the Communist take-
overs in East Europe after World War II, 
Castro himself demonstrated that commu-
nism triumphs because a few men who know 
how to play with power can deceive the 
people. 
For over a year after gaining power the 
bearded hero of the hills talked about libera-
tion, progress, truth, social justice, defense 
of democracy, religious freedom and the right 
to vote. For more than a year this rhetoric 
camouflaged his real objective and was made 
to serve his real aims: to destroy all existing 
values and institutions in order to achieve 
absolute control and build a new order, Com-
munist style. Castro's greatest coup was not 
against the Batista regime; it was against the 
Cuban people themselves after Batista had 
fled. 
What was the strategy? Deception coupled 
with the old maxim divide and conquer. 
Time and again, Castro would find some issue 
whereby he could divide various elements in 
the press, in industry, among business men, 
the church, landowners or the educational 
establishment, and then rally some to his side 
in order to undo the others in a process of 
undoing all. 
In 1959, for instance, Castro brought a 
Spanish priest from Paraguay and put him 
on radio and TV to denounce the Franco 
regime in 'violent language. The Spanish 
Ambassador protested. But Castro was after 
bigger game. When representatives of many 
of the religious orders protested?some pre-
cisely on the grounds that a cleric should 
not mix in politics?Castro quickly labeled 
them opponents of his regime and subservi-
ent to a foreign racist power. 
The bait had been taken and the cam-
paign of villification was one which ended 
in the expulsion of all Spanish priests and 
nuns. Castro knew that the church was his 
ultimate enemy: this as only the first of 
his many moves which has left only 120 
priests on the island to take care of nearly 
7 million inhabitants. 
The same tactic was used to get rid of 
the newspaper El Mundo, owned by an Ital-
ian. The press was particularly vulnerable 
to this strategy that reliect on the selfish 
idea that another man's troubles are not my 
tronbles--and sometimes can even be to my 
profit. 
Castro could not afford to have any group 
united against him and least of all in the 
press. When Batista's army was disbanded 
Castro had a force of only 1,500 men. Boy 
scouts were being used to direct traffic. 
Castro himself had to go on TV day in and 
day out, sometimes for hours at a time. But 
until he was strong enough he needed a de-
ceived press to give him its support. 
An exile, formerly connected with Bohemia 
magazine, says that Castro used to visit the 
magazine's offices three times a week, but 
the visits declined as the strength of the 
army increased. Castro knew how to play 
favorites so that as he moved against one 
publication after another, those that re-
mained would always feel "safe." 
But getting rid of the "bourgeois" press 
was always a piecemeal process, never a MRS-
sive blow that would show his hand. And 
when the attack came it was rarely from 
Castro himself. Union toughs would smash 
the machinery of an afternoon paper over 
some minor grievance. The morning paper 
would find its position improved. When a 
foreign-owned paper would be accused of 
being anti-Cuban, the others would congrat-
ulate themselves on their illusory safety as 
nationals. 
Castro's second thrust against the church 
was once again not on any religious issue; 
that would have rallied opposition. Dis-
tinguishing between good Christians and bad 
ones, he would praise the Sisters of Charity 
as good religious women following the true 
calling of Christ. They devoted their lives 
to healing the sick and helping the poor. 
But by appearing religious himself in this 
way, he subtly advanced a purely social in-
terpretation of religion and thus opened his 
attack on the Jesuits, the Augustinians, and 
others involved in the education of the "up-
per classes." 
His target was the vital field of education 
and particularly the University of Santo 
Tomas de Villanueva. With Law 11, passed 
in January, 1959, Castro voided all degrees 
and credits of Villanueva granted sine* the 
University of Havana had shut down in 1956. 
The charge was that Villanueva had not sup-
ported Havana University's protest against 
Batista by closing its doors, too. 
With rumors that the administration of 
the university had considered declaring its 
grounds and buildings American property, 
Castro had new ammunition. With a charge 
of "anti-Cuban" in hand, he went on to 
develop antagonism between clergy and laity 
over the question of Villanueva, duping many 
into supporting the regime's attack on the 
main nonstate university and the Augustin-
lens who ran it. 
The closing of the university in 1961 con-
stitutes one of the saddest episodes in the 
early days of Castroism. Those who had 
criticized the Augustinians soon found that 
they were following their brothers into exile, 
and the church's activity in higher education 
was stamped out. 
Lay organizations were prey to manipula-
tion by the regime in order to weaken the 
church. The JUC (Juventud Urtiversitaria 
Catolica), for example, with prompting from 
the government, denied that there were any 
Communists in the University of Havana, 
actually a Communist stronghold. Their ill-
considered statement only added to the con-
fusion already felt by many Cubans. 
Distinctions and divisions between "con-
servative" and "liberal" Catholics were 
pressed for all they were worth. "Progres-
sives" were opposed to "reactionaries" and 
"antirevolutionaries." Those who supported 
the aims of the revoluticin were said to be in 
line with the true teachings of the Gospel. 
Magazines like La Quincena were ap-
plauded, while any that criticized Govern-
ment measures were denounced as counter-
revolutionary. The distinction was only 
transitory, the purpose being to confuse and 
to divide the faithful into antagonistic 
groups. 
All the while the regime pretended to be 
on the side of religion. But strange devo-
tions were fostered in a Machiavellian man-
ner to further confuse and mislead. The 
veneration of the spurious San Lazaro was 
encouraged and the road to his shrine was 
modernized, above all because he was a poor 
man in the Gospel parable who lived to see 
the condemnation of the heartless rich man. 
Propaganda, not religion, was the aim; but 
the religious spirit of the people could be 
used?and twisted in the process. 
The final stroke was to try to create a 
Cuban National Church, independent from 
Rome and "faithful to the true teachings of 
Christ," which, according to the revolution-
ary government, the priests and religious

April 22, 19 p rove d FoMmsEsMln WM820300150022-9 
had forgotten to practice. The government 
got a few of the clergy to attend the confer-
ence for this purpose, but made the mistake 
of inviting Bishop Boza Masvidal, the new 
auxiliary bishop of Havana, a native. The 
bishop torpedoed the plan and so kept al-
most all of Cuba's priests loyal, an action 
that took him a step closer to exile. 
Castro worked to create the same kind of_ 
divisions throughout the entire society. 
Since there was no "class war" in Cuba, he 
had to create it. Early in 1959 he passed 
two laws that completely disrupted real 
estate business and which were calculated 
to set the masses against the "easy living," 
"nonproductive" and "parasitic" rentiers. 
One decree simply cut all rents in half; an-
other put an absurd Ceiling price on the sale 
of land and then forced all owners (with a 
few technical exceptions) to sell on demand. 
The move aroused hardly any opposition 
from intellectual or businessmen not directly 
affected. To many it appeared simply as a 
bungling and insane gesture by a new gov-
ernment of amateurs and destined soon to be 
repealed. The mess :was indeed cleared up, 
but in a way they hardly expected: a year 
later Castro declared that rentiers were no 
longer owners, and all rents were to be paid 
to the government?toward a mythical 
"eventual" purchase. 
In a similar way Castro made use of the 
agrarian reform law of May 1959, to destroy 
first the foreign landholders, then those who 
held large blocks of land and finally even 
small landholders. Again, he attacked one 
group at a time, so that others would not 
protest until it was, too late. Now few "in-
dependent" farmers exist, and the state-
owned, state-run farm has become the,domi-
nant agricultural unit. 
What were the elements of Castro's suc-
cess? The first and most important was 
deception. Castro knew what his goals were 
from the .beginning. When he admitted in 
1961 that tie .had been a Marxist-Leninist all 
along, he also declared that he deliberately 
avoided saying this in the beginning because 
he knew he wouldn't be able to generate sup-
port. 
Castro knew what he intended to do; but 
by concealing his aims while working for 
them all the time, he perhaps more than any 
other sticCessful Communist revolutionary?
even the Red "agrarian reformers" of China?
was able to take advantage of the combina-
tion of good will and selfishness that exists 
in every society. 
A free 'society?and for that matter, even 
a Communist one?will always have a great 
variety of opinions, groups, divisions, and 
subdivisions and even antagonisms. Cas-
tro's second great tactic was to develop these 
into outright clashes. One by one, each of 
these groups could be isolated and then elim-
inated, while Castro was only apparently fa-
voring the rest. The Communist doctrine of 
class war is pure myth, but it becomes a 
"reality" for purposes of destruction under 
the pressures of selective agitation and de-
ception. ' 
The tactic only works because there is 
enough good will in a liberal society to 
believe that piecemeal isolation of one "bad" 
element soxnehow marks progress. And 
there is always enough bad will to be found 
that can close its eyes to the destruction that 
ensues, the "good" always believing they are 
safe. What is not realized is that such dis-
tinctions between bad and good are not part 
of the Communist vocabulary. They are 
only means by which the Communist is able 
to divide and conquer. 
And Castro is using these same tactics to-
day. Now that he has secured absolute 
control in Cuba itself, he Is sparing no effort 
to export the revolution to all of Latin Amer-
ica, .Terrorisjn Bolivia may seem merely 
destructive. But in the Communist strategy 
and propaganda it is aimed at pitting "the 
people" against their "detestexi fascist rul-
, 
ers," just as arson in Puerto Rico is aimed at 
"foreign domination of capitalist overlords in 
the United States." 
And of all the deceptions and divisions 
that are created and encouraged?rich 
against poor, foreigner against native, owner 
against worker, big business against little, 
right against left?those involving the church 
are at once the saddest and most pernicious. 
Castro has added a new string to Lenin's 
lyre in pretending to speak in the name of 
the Gospel, playing upon the vast variety 
in the church's activities and organizations. 
By turning religion exclusively to social con-
cerns, its heart is cut out, true charity and 
the unity that goes with it is smashed. 
The state of the church in Cuba today 
stands as witness to what communism means 
bath in its tactics and in its goals. There 
Is no persecution, it is claimed?as long as 
religion is confined to the clouds "where it 
belongs." 
But the church is forbidden to teach; the 
more than 300 Catholic schools have been 
seized by the government; all religious pro-
grams have been banned from radio and tele-
vision; and even though churches are still 
open in Cuba, as the propaganda takes care 
to assert, the number of priests has been 
reduced to a handful that is far too few to 
minister to the needs of a population that 
Is overwhelmingly Catholic. The church in 
Cuba today has joined the honorable ranks 
of the churches of silence behind the Iron 
Curtain. 
But the cry of the church in Cuba is not 
merely a lament for itself; it is the cry of 
witness against what communism is trying 
to do everywhere. For the Cuban Church 
to cease to occupy its honorable position, de-
clared Bishop Boza Masvidal, "communism 
would have to cease being atheistic and en-
slaving," and both are equally impossible. 
"Research: Key to Tomorrow" 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. WILLIAM S. MOORHEAD 
OF' PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 1965 
Mr. MOORHEAD. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude as part of my remarks another 
chapter in the story of Pittsburgh, "Re-
search: Key to Tomorrow": 
RESEARCH MANPOWER 
More than 14,000 research scientists, engi-
neers, and technicians are employed in the 
Pittsburgh area. Of this total, 7,600 are pro-
fessional staff members. They represent all 
the disciplines, ranging from the design engi-
neer to the theoretical physicist. Almost all 
perform or are available for contract research, 
In addition to their R. & D. activities, 
Pittsburgh area Acientists and engineers en-
joy an active professional life through the 
local sections of more than 60 scientific and 
technical societies. 
Among these organizations are the Ameri-
can Chemical Society with seven active sub-
groups, the largest local section of the Amer-
ican Nuclear Society, and the world head-
quarters of the Instrument Society of 
America. 
The societies sponsor a multitude of pro-
fessional programs, many of which are joint 
projects. Typical activities include short 
courses in solid-state devices and process 
control by the Institute of Electrical & Elec-
tronic Engineers, PERT seminars by the 
American Institute of Industrial Engineers, 
a lecture series on space sciences by the 
American Institute of Aeronautics & Astro-
A1931 
nautics, and a unique high school engineer-
ing physics course sponsored by six societies. 
Pittsburgh also is the annual site of such 
highly regarded national and international 
conferences as the Pittsburgh Conference 
on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spec-
troscopy, Pittsburgh Diffraction Conference, 
ISA Conference on Instrumentation in the 
Iron. and Steel Industry, and the National 
Conference on Open Hearth and Basic Oxy-
gen Steel. 
Looking Back and Ahead in Wake of 
House Vote 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOHN D. DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 1965 
Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, pur-
suant to permission granted I insert in 
the appendix of the CONGRESSIONAL REC-
ORD an excellent article appearing in the 
Washington Report on the Medical Sci-
ences, published by WRMS, and edited 
by Mr. Gerald G. Gross. 
I am sure this excellent commentary 
on the passage of the medicare bill, H.R. 
6675, merits careful consideration. 
The article follows: 
LOOKING BACK AND AHEAD IN WAKE OF 
HOLTSE VOTE 
It really began a quarter century ago, when 
organized medicine's hostility to a small 
medical group formed to serve some govern-
ment employees on a prepaid basis led to 
conviction of AMA and fellow defendants 
on charges of violating antitrust laws. The 
conviction stood up clear to the U.S. Su-
preme Court. But AMA was now on its 
way to save the country from socialized 
medicine. Today, millions of lobbying and 
propaganda dollars later, the Nation is at 
the brink. Credit those dollars, if you will, 
with delaying the day; but credit them, too, 
with the power of backfire. 
The House has passed medical eldercare 
under social security. Senate passage this 
spring?possibly as a present for AMA on 
the eve of its annual meeting in New York 
City, June 20-24?is a virtual certainty. It 
will be a big climax, yet it will be but the 
first step. In time eldercare will give way 
to true medicare, with no ages barred. Only 
this time AMA persistence in its strange op-
position strategy will be an accelerant, 
rather than an effective obstruction tactic. 
In recent years particularly, AMA has en-
joyed exquisite success in antagonizing the 
press, alienating those in Congress who would 
be its friends, and picking the wrong horses. 
Membership dues have gone from $0 to $45 a 
year to raise a war chest that would stave 
off Federal intervention in providing and 
financing medical care. But any gains that 
may have accrued were offset by Dearborn 
Street aloofness to legitimate inquiries, oc-
casional arrogance, designation of a pat, 
patronizing, palaverous doctor to be spokes-
man?at least temporarily?and failure to 
recognize that AMA's refusal to take leader-
ship on health legislation weakened its posi-
tion as a pleader for the antieldercare cause. 
Attempting to show that organized labor 
was not solidly behind social security medi-
cal care, AMA engaged the president of an 
International union to address its banquet 
in Atlantic City. He said he was against 
Wagner-Murray-Dingell. Not long afterward 
he was in the penitentiary (though not be-
cause of that declaration) ?

cumstances in which organized medicine 
was anything but a disinterested bystander, 
he made this prediction before 1960 and he 
has made it since. In Omaha, as elsewhere, 
audience reaction was one of a sort of re-
sentful, if not belligerent, silence, as though 
the utterance mothered a wish. This is an-
other attitude that has hastened the day. 
NEXT 90 DAYS COULD BE A TIME FOR INVENTORY 
In the course of lengthy House debate 
Wednesday and Thursday on Hitt. 6675, AMA 
was slammed around a bit for its nega-
tivism and yet not even its severest critics 
employed the invective that has been heaped 
on King-Anderson bill and its predecessors. 
No one tagged AMA's motives as "a fraud 
and a hoax," a label once applied to Presi-
dent Kennedy for his sponsorship of social 
security eldercare?a characterization that 
was an important addition to the backfire 
arsenal. Rather, the atmosphere seemed to 
be one that could be summed up in the 
words: Cooperation of America's doctors is 
a must if this huge $6 billion program is to 
work, so here's hoping they take a new look. 
Passage of Medicare Bill Is a Legislative 
Milestone 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. RICHARD FULTON 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 1965 
Mr. , FULTON of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, on April 8 of this year the House 
of Representatives approved the historic 
bill to provide medical care for the 
elderly under social security. 
On April 10, the Nashville Tennessean 
in an editorial, "Passage of Medicare Bill 
Is a Legislative Milestone," stated final 
approval of this bill by the Congress will 
signal a "historic point in social legisla-
tion." 
Mr. Speaker, under unanimous con-
sent, I insert the editorial from the 
Nashville Tennessean at this point: 
PASSAGE OF MEDICARE BILL IS A LEGISLATIVE 
MILESTONE 
House passage of the program for medical 
care for the elderly under social security is a 
legislative milestone. - If the Senate approves 
this measure, it will mark a historic point 
in social legislation. 
Medical care for the aged has been one of 
the top priority items on President Johnson's 
must list. It was one of the early goals of 
the Kennedy-Johnson administration. 
For several years, the proposal has been 
the center of great controversy. The Amer-
ican Medical Association has spent millions 
to bring about its defeat. 
But for all the furore and outcries raised, 
a central fact has been that both sides have 
agreed that the aged needed protection 
against the rising costs of being sick. Sev-
eral factors have given the problem increas-
ing concern. 
The number of elderly in our population is 
large and it is growing. As a group, it is the 
most economically vulnerable, and it is the 
most likely to sustain long and serious ill-
nesses. There are nearly 20 million people 
In the United States who are 65 years or 
older. Many are dependent on small pen-
sions, social security, or inadequate life sav-
ings. To these older people, the costs of 
medical care for serious illness can be cata-
strophic, financially. 
The measure passed by the House is a 
much broader one than was conceived orig-
inally. In brief, it would: 
Increase social security payments to the 
aged by 7 percent: broaden medical assist-
ance under existing welfare programs, and 
liberalize other social security benefits. 
The key feature is the right of persons 
over 65 to a maximum of 60 days hospitaliza-
tion and 20 days nursing home care. The 
patient would pay the first $40, the rest 
would be paid for him. 
Available to the elderly who want it is 
a supplementary and entirely voluntary pro-
gram of insurance, which would defray ex-
penses of doctors' bills and other expenses 
not covered by the basic plan. This sup-
plementary insurance plan would apply only 
to those who want it and would be financed 
by a $3 a month premium from those joining 
the program and by matching funds from 
Federal general revenue. 
The bill includes a general liberalizing 
of other old-age, survivors, and disability 
benefits. Pensioners would be able to earn 
more and still collect a retirement check; 
widows could retire at an earlier age; chil-
dren would be given survivors benefits until 
age 22 instead of the present 18. 
All in all, it is a major package which 
is a big step forward in behalf of the older 
citizens of this Nation. House action by a 
236-to-191 vote adds optimism that Senate 
passage will come by June at least. 
Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. EDNA F. KELLY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 1965 
Mrs. KF.T.11Y, Mr. Speaker, although 
the history of mankind is unfortunately 
liberally sprinkled with dictatorships of 
the right and the left, as human beings 
we may still take pride in the fact that 
there have always been men who have 
been willing to risk all in order to counter 
them. 
One of the most recent tyrannies was 
that which existed in Germany from 
1933 to 1945, when the Nazis under 
Adolf Hitler attempted to establish their 
"thousand year Reich." April 19, 1965, 
was the anniversary of one of the most 
tragic uprisings against that dictator-
ship: The revolt of the Warsaw ghetto 
in 1943, when 40,000 Jews decided to 
confront the German war machine. In-
adequately equipped, almost completely 
untrained, and overwhelmingly outnum-
bered, their defiance of the SS and the 
Gestapo was in the true sense of the 
word a tragedy, because despite the 
knowledge of certain defeat, they never 
hesitated. 
The Warsaw ghetto was officially es-
tablished in November of 1940: 100 city 
blocks were surrounded by brick walls 
10 feet high and barbed wire fences, and 
the Jewish population was completely 
cut off from the rest of the city?indeed, 
the world. Despite the starvation, mis-
ery and death which followed, Jewish 
community life continued: soup kitch-
ens, child care centers, schools, lectures, 
musical events, and a host of other activ-
ities were carried out. Perhaps most 
important for posterity, daily feports on 
activities, scientific papers, and complete 
archives were maintained. It is from 
these that we have our information on 
life in the ghetto; they provide a moving 
and memorable record of the courage 
and determination of the unfortunate 
people to preserve and maintain their 
Jewish traditions and way of life against 
the Nazi holocaust. 
But, their actions provide us at the 
same time with a more meaningful and 
wider lesson: that no tyranny, no matter 
how ruthless and inhuman, is ever able 
to extinguish the desire of man to live 
in freedom. The Warsaw ghetto will 
forever live as an example of how guns, 
barbed wire, starvation, and torture are, 
in the long run, unable to compete with 
dedication and determination to the 
cause of liberty. 
Republican Task Force on Agriculture 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ODIN LANGEN 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 1965 
Mr. LANGEN. Mr. Speaker, the 
members of the House Republican Task 
Force on Agriculture have expressed 
grave concern over the rapid increase in 
U.S. farm debt. It is our feeling that 
the American farmer is literally being 
crushed under this enormous burden of 
debt. With farm mortgage and short-
term debt increasing far out of propor-
tion to income, the farmer's economic 
situation is rapidly deteriorating. 
We on the task force are continuing 
our research into the agricultural situa-
tion for the purpose of arriving at a 
better understanding of what is wrong 
with present and past programs which 
have not served the best interests of the 
American farmer, taxpayer or consumer. 
Such a thorough understanding is most 
essential as a background for any and 
all considerations of the farmer's eco-
nomic problems. Preliminary research 
Into the farm debt situation has revealed 
some alarming facts. 
Unfortunately, administration farm 
programs have accomplished the exaci, 
opposite of their stated objectives. Since, 
1961, net farm income has remained vir-
tually at the same level, while total farrr. 
debt has increased nearly 50 percent. 
Total farm debt today is actually great-
er than the entire Federal budget in 
1948. 
U.S. farmers in 1961 were indebted 
$1.97 for every dollar of realized net in-
come. This year, after 4 years of current 
farm programs, the farmer will owe a 
whopping $2.86 for every income dollar. 
To further illustrate what this means, in 
1929, on the eve of the great depression, 
the farmer owed only about $2.30 for 
each income dollar. The farmer's best 
postwar year was 1947, when the ratio
