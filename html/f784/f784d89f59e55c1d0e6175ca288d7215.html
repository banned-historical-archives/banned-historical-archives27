 Leadership Appearances: A Non-Pattern
 F            1
 A series of major events in Peking--the Kim
 Il-song visit, rallies in support of communist vic-
 tories in Cambodia and Vietnam and May Day--brought
 most of China's leaders into public view.  Not all
 leaders appeared at all events, however.  Some
 failed to appear at events they would normally be
 expected to attend, and others appeared in unusual
 capacities at other festivities.
 Among the more surprising inconsistencies was
 the non-appearance of Politburo member Chang Chun-
 chiao at the festivities surrounding Kim's visit
 and both the Cambodia and Vietnam rallies.  Chang
 has often assumed hosting duties on behalf of visit-
 ing foreign communist delegations, but his absence
 from all functions associated with visiting com-
 mtinists raises questions about whether he has re-
 linquished this role in light of .".,is recent accumu-
 lation of other duties.  Chang does not appear to
 be in any political trouble.  He did appear on May
 Day, and his art,.cle in last month's issue of Red
 Flag continues to be cited frequently in the pro-
 vincial propaganda, sometimes without reference to
 the earlier article by fellow Politburo member Yao
 Wen-yuan.
 Yao emerged in an unusual role during the Kim
 Il-song visit, as the second-ranking participant
 in some of the substantive discussions between Kim
 and Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping.  While Yao has
 often hosted visiting journalists on his own, this
 was the first time he is known to have taken part
 in substantive talks with a visiting head of state.
 Yao appeared at all of the recent events in the
 capital, somewhat overshadowing the nominal third
 man in the leadership, Wang Hung-wen.

 Wang was not present for Kim 11-song's arrival
 or departure, and, although he was the highest
 ranking Chinese leader at both banquets during the
 Kim visit,  the speeches for the Chinese side were
 given not by Wang but by Teng Hsiao-ping.  Wang's
 protocol ranking in the leadership obviously does
 not automatically entitle him t, an important role
 in such major events as the visit of Kim I1-song.
 Moreover, despite his presence at both the Cambodia
 and Vietnam rallies, it was Defense Minister Yeh
 Chieng-ying, rather than Wang, who delivered the
 speeches.
 The appearances of Chiang Ching seemed almost
 arbitrary.  She was on hand to greet Kim Il-song
 but did not see him off.  Although she rarely at-
 tends state banquets, she was present at the banquet
 for Kim but did not attend Kim's reciprocal banquet.
 She attended the Cambodia rally but not the Vietnam
 rally.  Most startling of all she was the only major
 leader, other than Mao and Chou, to miss May Day.
 Her absence was made even more glaring by the pre-
 sentation, given by some ten thousand cultural
 workers, of songs from the operas produced under
 her auspices.  Radio Peking called the presentation
 "by far the biggest festival performance in Peking,"
 begging the question of Chiang Ching's absence.,
 Taken together, the recent events in Peking
 and the leadership appearances associated with them
 may give some claes as to the relative importance
 of certain officials.  Chiang Ching's political
 standing, as usual, remains hazy.  Teng Hsiao-ping
 is clearly important, perhaps far more so than his
 sixth-ranking position in the leadership would sug-
 gest.  By contrast, young Wang Hung-wen's performance
 to date does not seem to equal his standing as third
 in the leadership.  The other members of the "second
 generation," particularly Chi Teng-kuei, who himself
 was tied up with the visiting Belgian prime minister

 but managed to appear at all the other events, are
 taking on greater responsibilities.  Although this
 pattern has been discernible since the National
 People's Congress in January, the most surprising
 development is the role of Yao Wen-yuan during the
 visit of Kim Il-song.  Yao has not seemed to figure
 greatly in the growing role of the second genera-
 tion, but his future activities may merit close
 watching.

 May Day and the Military
 I
 Leadership appearances on May Day suggest that
 while party-army relations remain strained, civil-
 ian leaders in Peking and regional commanders have
 reached a certain accommodation. The campaign to
 strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, which has
 so far emphasized social order and production goals
 and has not been used as a means to attack the mili-
 tary, almost certainly appeals to the vast majority
 of military men on both counts.  While provincial
 turnouts are incomplete, and some missing leaders
 are soldiers who hold party posts, most top ranking
 military men have been accounted for. One previously
 absent leader who had been heavily criticized, former
 Canton Military Region political commissar Jen
 Ssu-chung, h: ,s apparently been given a high ranking
 military post in the Tsinan Military Region. The
 effort to ease military men out of party and govern-
 ment posts continues, and with some success, but
 Peking's tactics are quite different than they were
 during the campaign to criticize Lin and Confucius.
 At that time, regional commanders were the targets
 of s!--were criticis.n, and seven of them were stripped
 of their provincial party posts in one bold stroke.
 The current standing of the military is typified
 by the appearances of two military region commanders
 who are also politburo members. Shenyang commander
 Li Te-sheng led the turnout in Liaoning. Li, who
 lost his post as head of the PLA's General Political
 Department last year and was dropped from the politburo
 standing committee this year after running into
 serious trouble during the anti-Lin, anti-Confucius
 campaign, had been conspicuously absent from large
 turnouts in Liaoning in April to greet Kim Il-song
 on his arrival and departure from China.  Li's
 political standing remains shaky, but he apparently
 remains Shenyang Military Region commander.

 Canton Military Region commander Hsu Shih-yu,
 who was reported to be visiting a "grassroots unit"
 on May Day, was the only one of the provincial-based
 politburo members who did not head a turnout ir_ his
 provincial capital.  The peculiar treatment accorded
 Hsu se.;ms a sign of political weakness and serves to
 emphasize his separation from the locus of political
 power in the region.  However, the party first sec-
 retary of Kwangtung was also absent from Canton,
 which tends to cloud the meaning of the turnout.
 Other recent indicators are consistent with
 Peking's carrot-and-stick approach toward the mili-
 tary.                           Two provincial military figures who weri
 heavily criticized last year and seemed likely purge
 candidates continue to appear in Peking. Han Hsien-chu,
 who was rotated from Fukien to Kansu, and Hsieh
 Chen-hua, who hea'ed Shansi until a play produced
 there was branded a "poisonous weed," were listed
 among members of the party central committee appear-
 ing in the capital.  Neither leader has appeared in
 his province in some time, but they have not yet been
 replaced, either.
 Several military men were publicly rehabilitated
 or given active pasts for, the first time on may 1.
 Fu Chung-pi, who was Peking Garrison commander until
 his fall in the 1968 purge of acting chief of staff
 Yang Cheng-wu, is now listed with ranking officers
 of the Peking Military Region. A continuing relation-
 ship with Yang, who is now a deputy chief of staff,
 cannot be established, but Fu certainly has no strong
 ties to his superior, Peking Military Region commander
 Chen Hsi-lien. The appointment appears to be another
 example of the civilian leadership using checks and
 balances to control a politically sensitive military
 command.  Another professional soldier who fell
 early in the Cultural Revolution, former artillery
 commander Wu Kuo-hua, has also returned to active

 ranks, while Tan Cheng, who was the head of the
 General Political Department and a vice-minister
 of defense in the 1950s, was listed as "attending"
 the festivities.

 Pressure on the military nevertheless continues.
 Wu Hsiu-chuan, a former head of the party's
 International Liaison Department, is either a deputy
 chief of staff or, more likely, a deputy director
 of the General Political Department. In either case,
 Wu seems to continue the trend of placing putative
 civilians in high military posts. Moreover, domr'stic
 propaganda seems to'be telling PLA men that they
 will no longer receive preferential treatment in
 the form of urban employment upon demobilization.
 Numerous articles also continue to emphasize that
 local military leaders are to support their party
 and government counterparts at all times.

 May Day in the Provinces
 May Day turnouts in the provinces were con-
 siderably larger than a year ago when the anti-
 Confucius campaign was raging, but less impressive
 than those for National Day  (October 1st) when a
 major effort was made to project an image of sta-
 bility and unity.  Accounts of this year's festivi-
 ties are notable principally for their blandness.
 There were no major surprises this year.  No
 new first secretaries were named, nor were any
 purges revealed.  Five provinces--Anhwei, Heilung-
 kiang, Hupeh, Liaoning, and Shansi--still do not
 have a publicly identified first secretary, and
 civilians continue to head 16 of the 29 provincial-
 level units.                            Military men lead the other eight.
 Anhwei, Chekiang, Fukien, and Kiangsu--four
 of the more troubled provinces--failed to publish
 detailed accounts of their local celebrations,
 indicating that the situation remains unsettled
 there.   Heilungkiang, whose first secretary appar-
 ently :eras purged recently, also failed to provide
 a name lisc of those in attendance.  Yunnan, on the
 other hand, turned out in force despite its con-
 tinuing factional struggles.
 A few provincial leaders appeared in Peking.
 Most notable were Jen Jung and Lu Jui-lin, the
 bosses of Tibet and Kweichow, respectively.  Jon may
 be discussing Tibet's long-standing economic and
 supply problems with officials  it the center.   Lu
 may be in Peking to discuss Kweichow's persistent
 factionalism, although rumors of poor health neces-
 sitating trips to the capital for medical treatment
 continue to surface.
 The strangest turnout was in Kwangtung where

 Military Region commander, and Chiao Lin-i, Canton's
 mayor, all failed to attend the provincial rally.
 Itsu was reportedly with a "grassroots unit" some-
 where, but no effort was made to account for Chao's
 and Chi.ao's absence.  There is no evidence to sug-
 gest that either man is in political trouble.   In
 their absence, Kung Shih-chuan, the second ranking
 military man stationed in the province, led the
 turnout.  Kung's role is mildly surprising because
 he was apparently stripped of his provincial party
 titles as a result of the anti.-Confucius campaign,
 although he retained his military posts.   It was
 apparently in that capacity--as well as a member
 of the Central Committee-- that he led the turnout
 in Kwangtung.
 The top party figures in Inner Mongolia and
 Tsinghai also missed local celebrations.   As was
 the case in Kwangtung, no explanation was offered
 for their absence, and neither man seems to be in
 political difficulty.   Inner Mongolia's number two
 man did attend the festivities in Peking as a mem-
 ber of the Central Committee.
 May Day turnouts indicate that the campaign to
 study the proletarian dictatorship has had little,
 if any, effect on provincial leaderships so far.
 Both national and local leaders have successfully
 managed to keep the campaign focused on impersonal
 behavior patterns and away from the s ecific actions
 of individuals, including their own.                            25X1

 Chiang Ching: Both a Legalist
 and n Confucianint Be
 Although the anti-Confuciun campaign has faded
 into the background, nome discunnion of the histor-
 ical struggle between legalints and Confucianists
 continues to surface in the propaganda. Two such
 articles recently received in Washington acorn to
 take opposing views of Chiang Ching.
 Last year, Chiang Ching's supporters appeared
 to make a cane for her to be chosen an Mao's nuc-
 censor by painting a favorable picture of ?mprenn
 Wu, generally regarded an a terrible ruler. The
 spruced-up image of the emprena, suddenly called
 a "legalin:," wan countered by wall posters that
 attacked Empress Wu and linked her directly to
 Madame Mao.
 Chiang Ching's supporters evidently tried again
 in early January with another article on the virtues
 of the "legalist" empress. The timing of the article,
 just after the party central cormnittee had completed
 a new slate of government officers that omitted
 Chiang Ching, may be significant. The article smacks
 of some vengeance over the obstacles Impress Wu/
 Chiang Ching had to overccme to win positions of
 power.
 In addition to repeating the earlier theme that
 Empress Wu ruled China well for many years after her
 husband's death, the article made some specific claims
 that seem to resemble more recent events. Striking
 what appeared to be a rather vindictive note, the
 article lashed out agkinst the court elders who objected
 to the emperor's marriage to Wu and who vigorously de-
 fended the emperor's current wiio vn one who "should
 not be divorced lightly." The pansar,? seems to refer
 to the controversy nuriounding Mao'ts marriage to
 Chiang Ching, which many party officials opposed,
 and their support for his highly respected wife, Ho

 Tzu-chen, who had made the Long M.!rch. in its do-
 fenna of Wu, the article noted the emperor wan at-
 tractod to her because, among other things, she
 was "well versed in literature," apparently an
 allusion to Madame Mao's cultural aspirations.
 The article also complained that those in power,
 inclucing the court "secretary-general" and some
 who hold important   vernment positions, constantly
 conspired against her. Upon assuming the throne,
 the art,l,cle noted that Empress Wu removed 36 such
 officials, including the prime minister. These
 actions were portrayed in the article as praise-
 worthy, legalist policies.
 By contrast, an article in March on the struggle
 between Confucianism and legalism complained bitterly
 that the Confucianists used opera to attack the
 legalists, distort historical facts, and advance
 their own cause. Although the article was cant in
 historical terms and the operas attacked are ancient
 ones, the complaints could easily apply to the model
 operas created under Chiang Ching's guidance.
 The article claimed that the operas glorified
 certain Confucianist figures, whose names were
 widely used in the anti-Confucius propaganda last
 year to represent Lin Piao, and eulogized historical
 generals who advocated policies of "national betrayai."
 Chiang Ching's operas, in fact, glorify some military
 men a;to undoubtedly were originally intended to
 represent Lin Piaoo, and several of her operas glorify
 the military in general. Last year's anti-Confucius
 propaganda, inter alia, accused not only Lin but some
 regional military commanders of harboring traitorous
 ideas.
 The article noted that none of the old operas
 praised the major legalist figures and that one,
 "The Stubborn Prime Minister," even attacked a

 respected legalist. One of Chiang Ching'n operas
 is open to similar charges. Perhaps nomewi't akin
 to "The Stubborn Prime Minister," it not, only does
 not praise Premier Chou En-lai but actually appears
 to denigrate him and portrays him an "stubborn."
 Lent there be any doubt that the discussion of
 ancient operas has current relevance, the article
 accuses "Lin Piao and company" of using the Confucian
 practice of producing operas an "monuments" to
 themselves. Any operas created after Lin gained power
 in 1966 in fact were done no under Chiang thing's
 tutelage. Consequently, the article's criticism of
 operas created by Lin "and company" can only refer
 to Chiang Ching's model operas.
 Although the article lauds the "revolution in
 Peking opera," it attributes this not to Chiang Ching
 but to "the proletariat." It concludes with
 ritualistic praise for the model operas but calls
 for "conti,aued effort" to root out Lin Piao's
 influence, particularly the distortion of history,
 in the cultural sphere.

 Indian Relations: Even More Sour
 Sino-Indian relations are likely to be quite
 frosty over the next few months, but the Chinese
 have not closed the door on eventual rapprochement.
 Poking's verbal reaction to what it sees as Indian
 moves to eliminate the remaining vestiges of
 Sikkimose autonomy has been strong.   In the past.
 several weeks, Sikkim's monarch has been removed
 from office with the assistance of Indian troops,
 and the parliament in Now Delhi has passed a resolu-
 tion approving statehood for Sikkim.
 In a government statement issued on April 29,
 the Chinese bitterly denounced India, charging that
 it engineered the monarch's removal and that the
 parliament's decision is simply the "legalization"
 of Sikkim's annexation.  This is the first time in
 nearly two years that Peking has expressed its views
 through a government statement, and it represents
 the highest level criticism of India since the India-
 Pnkistani War of 1971.  Poking's statement prompted
 Now Delhi to issue one of its own, which accused the
 Chinese of interfering in India's internal affairs.
 The language in the Chinese statement is the
 strongest used ''.ince Indian moves in Sikkim began
 to attract Peking's attention last summer.  In this
 regard, the statement dwelt at greater length than
 past commentaries on Indian "expansionist" ambitions
 in South Asin.
 As might be expected, the Chinese have ruled
 out--at least for the present--any improvement in
 Sino-Indian relations.  Chinese diplomats are now
 saying privately that Vice Premier Chen Hsi-lien's
 friendly overtures toward the Indians in February
 carried no special significance.

 Chinese concern about Sikkim goes beyond the
 fact that India's strategic position has been
 strengthened at China's expense.  Equally important
 is the belief that Sikkim is yet another Indian probe
 designed to test China's resolve to maintain the
 status cgio in other parts of the buffer region.
 The Chinese may fear that anything short of a strong
 reaction could be misinterpreted in New Delhi an a
 lack of resolve on China's Part.
 The Sikkim developments were also a bitter pill
 for the Chinese because of the political context
 in which they came.  Peking has been trying for a
 number of, months to improve relations with New
 Delhi.   The Chinese must have hoped that aside from
 serving their long-term interests, friendly over-
 tures would also work to their advantage in the
 short term by providing an incentive to the Indians
 for restraint in Sikkim.  New Delhi not only failed
 to respond favorably to China's overtures but it
 undertook rapid and blatant actions to incorporate
 Sikkim.

 Moreover, these moves came shortly after Soviet

 Chinese are undoubted)  suspicious that a new arms
 deal was concluded
 n  may now  ear that India's
 coolness toward the Chinese overtures and its moves
 in Sikkim are part of a quid pro quo.   Treatment
 of the Soviets in Chiaa's government statement seems
 to strengthen this interpretation.  The statement
 goes beyond pr~a iuus comment and labels Moscow
 the "main threat" to the sovereignty of South Asian
 countriers and the "most dangerous enemy" of the
 people of the region.  In the past, India and the
 Soviet Union were held equally culpable for Indian
 actions.

 obvious effort to keep polemics from esca-

 that Pakistan would have to prepare itself
 for some measure of Sino-Indian rapproche-
 ment.   In this regard, Li urged Islamabad
 to continue to repair its differences with
 New Delhi; this, of course, would help to
 remove stumbling blocks to improved Sino-
 Indian relations.
 25X1
 At this point, China's dilemma is how to in-
 crease its leverage vis-a-vis India without jeop-
 ardizing hopes for better ties in the future.  The
 optiu.'s are few.
 For the next few months, the Chinese can be
 expected to consolidate, to some extent, relations
 with Pakistan and Nepal.  There may-even be some
 movement toward normalizing ties with Bhutan. At
 the same time, Peking and New Delhi will probably
 continue their battle of words while carefully
 monitoring each other's actions.  While Sikkim has
 done much to fire suspicions between China and India,
 statehood has gutted the issue as a future irritant.
 Whether some form o  rapprcc ement is possible, after
 the heat of the issu  subsides, will probably rest
 heavily on Indian behavior in the buffer state
 region during the next several months.

 Equally important will be how the Chinese
 view relations between Moscow and New Delhi.  At
 present, Peking continues to maintain that there are
 inherent conflicts in the Soviet-Indian relation-
 ship which will become increasingly apparent.
 However, China's treatment of the Soviets in its
 government statement on Sikkim hints at some
 reservations about this assumption.  If India
 should appear to the Chinese over the next several
 months to be making political concessions to Moscow
 in return for military aid--an unlikely course--
 Peking may decide that rapprochement is a futile
 pursuit which hazards more than its promises.

 Another Hat for Chen Hsi-lien
 Peking regional military commander Chen Hsi-
 lien has added another job to his growing list of
 responsibilities. The only military man among the
 newly appointed vice premiers of the government,
 Chen was identified on May 11 as a member of the
 Military Commission, the organization through which
 the party maintains its control over the military.
 Radio Peking coyly refrained from specifying whether
 Chen is a "leading member" of the Military Commis-
 sion or "the" leading member. The distinction is
 important because he could either be one of several
 vice chair-,ten of the commission or the ranking vice
 chairman, a job generally thought to belong to De-
 fense Minister Yeh Chien-ying.
 Despite Yeh's presence at the military sports
 meet,  at which Chen's new job was publicly revealed,
 it was Chen rather than Yeh who gave the opening
 address. Chen welcomed the participants "on behalf
 of the Chinese PLA," the only military leader other
 than Yeh Chien-ying to use those words since the fall
 of Lin Piao. Chen's speech dwelt on military training
 and preparedness and made no reference to a political
 role for the PLA.
 Chen seemed to clash with moderate leaders in
 ,Peking when he led an attack during the summer of
 1973 on the use of university entrance examinations.
 He was also attacked by historical analogy during
 last year's anti-Confucius campaign. Since that time,
 however, he has performed well in his capacity as
 vice premier and has shown no recent signs of opposi-
 tion to current moderate policies. His apparently
 docile behavior in recent months can perhaps best be
 explained by the number of new jobs he has been given.
 He was transferred to Pcki,ng in the rotation of mili-
 tary commanders at the end of 1973, thereby bringing

 China's (;rain Import P       es
 F         I
 5ihce 1961, China has regularly imported latirt
 quantities of grain to maintain rations in northern
 cities.   Initially, short-term purchases of wheat
 were made as an emergency measure, following the
 collapse of the Great ieap forward. Imports became
 a permanent feature of Chinese policy when it he-
 came apparent that aciricuitural development wan
 lagging in the trorth China Plain.   In the winter
 of 1963/64 and again in 1966 long-term (3-year)
 purchase agreements were signed with Canada and
 Australia.
 New investment flowed into agriculture in the
 1960x, and by the end of that decade the iovernrent
 apparently was confident that the gap in grain out-
 put would soon be clcsed.  Upon tt.7 completion or
 the long-terra agreements with Canada and Australia,
 Peking reverted to a short-term import policy.   in
 the fall and winter of 1969, the Chinese beoan to
 contract for grain to satisfy minimum projected
 requirements and then, if required, planned to sup-
 plement tiese purchases with short-term purchases
 the following year.  In late 1969, one-year con-
 tracte were signed with Canada and Australia.   in
 1970 and again in 1971, China purchased from Canada
 exclusively, ostensibly because of Peking'a disaatin-
 faction with Canberra's failure to grant diplomatic
 recognition.   In 1971, grain imports fell to only
 3.03 million tons, lean than one half the record
 6.31 million tons purchased in 1964 and substan-
 tially below the trend established over the prior
 decade.   (See table.)
 Still another turnabout in China's import
 policy began to emerge in late 1972.  Crop pros-

 late summer of 1972,  forcing )'eking to peek grain
 for immediate de l ;very . The timing could not have
 hpen worse.  World supplies of grain for export
 v;;re the lowest in yearn; deliVorips from Canada--
 China's sole supplier at the time--were snarled
 by a Canadian clock strike, and harvest prospects
 were uncertain in all major grain exporting coun-
 tries except the US.   In September 1972, the Ch!.-
 nese purchased 595,000 tons of us wheat through a
 third country trader as a stopgap until deliveries
 from traditional suppliers could be resumed.
 tleginning in mid-October. 1972 the Chinese,
 following their normal practice, began to purchase
 grain for delivery in 1973.  The initial purchase
 was for 1.0 million tons of Australian wheat--the
 first contract signed with that country since 1969--
 followed by a contract for 1.7 million tons cf
 Canadian wheat.  Almost before the ink wan dry on
 these contracts, the Chinese were informed that
 Australian deliveries would be halved because the
 harvest was lower than expected, and the continuing
 dock strike in Canada would also likely force addi-
 tional cutbacks in deliveries from Ottawa.   To
 make matters worse, inclement weather continued to take
 a heavy toll of the grain harvest in north and north-
 cast China.  Thus, the Chinese wore forced to turn
 to the US for a second time, this time for 575,000
 tons of corn which was cheaper and more readily
 available than wheat.
 By entering the market when international
 stocks were near rock bottom, the Chinese were
 forced to scrounge for grain and pay inflated prices.
 Peking was determined not to get caught short again.
 In the winter of 1972, the Chinese began to pur-
 chase grain to cover the maximum rather than the
 minimum projected requirements for 1973.
 In late 1972 and early 1973, Peking purchased
 13 chemical fertilizer plants from the west; the

 Chinese expect to achieve ael, -sufficiency when
 these plants bpcom fully operable about 1977.  To
 ensure grain imports In the interval before the
 fertilizer plants come on stream, Peking signed
 three-year purchase aqreements with Canada, Aus-
 tralia, and Argentina in late 1973 to buy a total
 of from 3.0 million to 4.0 million tons annually
 during 1974-75.   These purchases are a upplemented
 with short-term contracts as needed.
 The Chinese apparently contracted foi more
 grain in late 1972 and early 1973 than they could
 cope with financially or logiaLically.  Record
 deliveries of grain and other agricultural cornn-
 modities exceeded the capacity of northern ports,
 especially during the winter months.   By November
 1973, long lines of ships began to queue up at
 northern ports awaiting discharge.   Some vessels
 were unable to berth for 2 or 3 months after arriv-
 ing off the coast of China, a costly oversight con-
 siderirg the daily demurrage charge for each vessel
 exceeded $5,000.
 Poking began to look for excuses to postpone
 or delay grain deliveries without being forced to
 pay penalties for contract violation.   Poking was
 especially anxious to force a postponement in
 deliveries from the US, by far China's leading sup-
 plier at the time.  In October, 1973, Peking began
 to complain that much US wheat was contaminated with
 a rare and relatively harmless smut, TCK, and that
 the moisture content of US corn was too high, thereby
 causing problems for human consumption.  In February
 1974, the Chinese rejected several cargoes of US
 wheat and in April failed to arrange shipping for
 several cargoes of US corn.  The traders suspended
 deliveries of US wheat until a solution could be
 worked out.  The Chinese refused offers of cancella-
 tion and also rebuffed offers of consultation until
 after the port congestion had #ubsided.

 Peking shifted gears in May and June 1974.
 An agreement wns worked out to resume shipments of
 US wheat= shipping was provided for US corns and
 a series of new contracts wore ni(Ined for US, French,
 and Canadian grain, increasing total purchases for
 1974 delivery t} 9.5 million tons.   Deliveries of
 thin magnitude--about 1.0 million tons each month--
 would again have exceeded China's port capacity.
 But another problem had surfaced.   The terms of
 trade had turned against Peking.  Total imports
 were at an all time high whs    markets for China's
 major exports had noftenec,, giving rise to foreign
 exchange difficulties.
 Peking's initial reaction was to postpone
 deliveries.   In all, about 2.5 million tons of
 grain--divided among all of China's suppliers--
 wore carried over into 1975.   Poking had contracted
 for US wheat in the winter and early hummer of
 1973-74 when international prices were high.   In
 January 19'75, international markets weakened, prices
 declined, and additional price cuts worn expected.
 Thus; when the world price dipped below the con-
 tract price for US wheat in late January 1975,
 Peking decided to cancel all outstanding contracts
 for US grain.   In all cancellations the Chinese
 agreed to pay the trader the spread between the
 contract price and world price on the day of can-
 cellation.  At the same time the Chinese claimed
 damages for unsatisfactory grain already delivered,
 reducing actual payments from about $11.5 million
 to about $650,000.
 Peking is not likely to abrogate the 3-year
 purchase agreements with Canada, Australia, and
 Argentina.  However, the agreements were recently

 Peking's buying intentions beyond 1976 are
 unclear.   It is unlikely that all of the new fer-
