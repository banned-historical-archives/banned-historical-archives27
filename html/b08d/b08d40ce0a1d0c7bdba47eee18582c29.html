Senator Johnson. The Committee will come to order. 
Today in continuation of our review of missiles, space and 
other major defense matters, our committees are meeting to 
hear from the Secretary of Defense, Thomas S. Gates, Jr. 
This year, as in the past, we in Congress must make 
decisions on the annual defense programs submitted by the 
Executive Branch. On these decisions may well rest America's 
future. 
In order to advise and assist us we have called in the 
nation's top military experts. 
First, in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding 
of the threat, we met with Allen Dulles, the Director of the 
Central Intelligence Agency. While the testimony, of necessity, 
remains classified Mr. Dulles left no doubt about the deadly 
seriousness of the threat -- a threat that ever since the 
termination of world War II has become increasingly apparent from 
the obvious intent of the Kremlin to control the world 
through all possible means. 
Our particular attention has been directed to the under-
lying principles and facts upon which the decisions governing 
America's defense and space programs are based, for these 
programs must be designed to actually meet the threat. 
To date we have heard from each member of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, including the Chairman as well as 
other key military witnesses responsible for America's 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18 : CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6

bd3 defense programs. These senior military officials have 
(:) made it clear that while our defense posture today is 
adequate, our programs for the future involve a degree of 
(:) risk which could affect the very survival of our nation. 
Some of our outstanding military experts warn us that 
we must act now to step up such key programs as B-52 continu-
ous airborne alert. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps moderniza-
tion, airlift, Polaris submarines dispersed, hardened and 
mobile ICBM's and anti-submarine warfare. 
We must take decisive stens to shorten, rather than leng-
then, the lead time for developing an operational aircraft 
to replace the 13-52. 
We must also accelerate the development of space satel-
lites and the high thrust engines vitally needed for our space 
programs. 
General Power, Commanding General of America's principal 
deterrent force testified he was not satisfied that we were 
doing all we should to ensure our future survival. 
General Schriever said that the missile gap we now face 
results from failure to make the necessary decisions in the 
past. He also advised that we could increase our operational 
missile strength during the critical year of 1962 if necessary 
decisions were made now. 
General White testified that there was immediate and 
continued need for more manned aircraft. He personally

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18 : CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
607 
bd4 recommended more B-58's to replace our obsolescent B-47's 
(:) and the rapid development of the 8-70 hypersonic bomber 
as an operational weapons system. 
(:) Admiral Rickover testified about the Soviets that: 
"Their program is world domination, and no Russian 
Communist leader has ever deviated from that principle. 
Our main enemy is wishful thinking. Only those who learn 
nothing and forget everything, refuse to look at the 
record." 
Admiral Burke testified that the Navy was approaching 
the breaking point with regard to obsolescence, but that 
restrictive budgetary guidelines had prevented the Navy 
(:) from presenting its military requirements. He urged 
immediate expansion of the Polaris program. 
General Lemnitzer testified that the Army was not 
modernizing as rapidly as it should and that only a small 
portion of the funds added by the Congress in 1960 for Army 
modernization had been released for this purpose. He voiced 
the need for more airlift and warned that the country has as 
yet no adequate defense against ICBMs. 
General Taylor testified that unless heroic measures 
are taken now, this nation faces a threat to its survival. 
There has, of course, been a difference of opinion among 
individuals both as Committee members and as witnesses. 
(:) I cannot help believe, however, that we are all agreed that 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
608 
preparedness and security are the necessary watchwords 
of this age of advanced and destructive weapons. 
America must maintain a position of unquestionedstrength 
to assure that world peace will not be broken by any aggressor 
tempted to gamble for world domination. 
The path to a lasting peace lies through the strength 
of free nations, and America is the key strength in the free 
world. 
As I have said before, there may be some disagreement on 
some points discussed before our Committee, but one simple 
proposition remains absolutely clear 
If we speed up our defenses and they are not needed all 
v4e lose is money. If we fail to step up our defenses and they 
are needed, we could lose our country. 
The very able and distinguished Secretary of Defense, 
Mr. Gates is here with us this morning and the committee, 
Mr. Gates, wants to thank you for being with us and for 
rearranging your very busy schedule on relatively short 
notice. 
We understand that you need to be back at the Pentagon 
this afternoon in order to prepare for your pending NATO 
trip. Therefore our session this morning will be limited 
to the hours remaining and will be held in open session. 
If executive matters are to be discussed, they will probably 
have to be taken up at a later date. In accordance with the

d6 established committee procedures, all witnesses have been 
informed that the committee does not desire to have lengthy 
prepared statements, especially because of the limited time 
available for this hearing. 
believe you have been informed by our staff that 
we do not care to have any statements read. However, I under-
stand thatyou have a statement available and we will be very 
glad to insert it in the record at this point, to distribute 
it to the members and to have you if you choose to highlight 
it in any manner that you may care. 
We will start with questions by the counsel followed by 
each committee member in turn in accordance with our practice. 
Mr. Secretary, it is also the Committee's procedure to 
swear the witness, and if you will please stand I shall adminis-
ter the oath. 
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, 
and nothing but the truth in the testimony you are about 
to give so help you God? 
Secretary Gates. I do, sir. 
Senator Johnson. You may be seated and without objection 
the statement will be included in the record. 
Senator Smith. Mr. Chairman. 
Senator Johnson. Mrs. Smith? 
Senator Smith. I have just received a copy of this 
statement. It is a little over 5 pages long double spaced. 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
610 
It would seem to me that such an important statement should 
be read before the committee asks the questions. Some of the 
cvestions could be answered by the statement. 
Senator Johnson. I had understood from the ranking 
Republican Mr. Saltonstall that he had talked to Secretary 
Gates about this and that it would be agreeable to him if 
in the interest of time we could include it in the record, 
since no members had had a chance to examine it. That while 
he was testifying, that they could examine it. The Secretary 
agreed that that procedure would be agreeable to him just 
before the hearing. 
I do not care to make a point of it. I think we 
can take more time discussing it than it will take to 
read it except we would be making an exception, in view of the 
fact we have two committees joining each other in these 
hearings, in view of the fact that the tendency in the past 
has been for witnesses to come with lengthy prepared state-
ments, that by the time you get down to many members, you 
don't hear it. 
Senator Smith. But this is a very short statements Mr. 
Chairman. 
Senator Johnson. And they don't have a chance to ask 
their questions if most of the time is taken with prepared 
statements. Now if we do this, and I will be glad to do it 
if the Committee desires it, we will be making an exception 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
611 
for the Secretary of Defense alone, if he wants to make 
a point of that or the Committee wants to make a point of 
it. I would have no objection. 
Senator Smith. Mr. Chairman, I agree completely on 
2engthy statements. This is a very brief statement and a 
very important statement. While I am not a ranking member 
of this committee, I do feel that it is important for me at 
least to look it over, and I want to listen to the quezticns 
I would ask the Chairman and the ranking member of this 
committee to reconsider and permit the Secretary to read 
it if he can do it quite quickly. 
Senator Johnson. If the Secretary desires to have that 
done, the Chair will certainly have no objection because we 
think we can take more time discussing it than it will take 
to read it except it does do this: Next time the statement 
may be 20 pages and the principle of having witnesses come 
in with statements and permitting them to deliver them at 
length will 
0.1.??? 
Senator Smith. Mr. Chairman: you will recall I am sure 
that Mr. Dulles did not read his statement, but some members 
of the committee had read the statement and had prepared 
questions from that statement, while some of the rest of us 
did not: and I did not appreciate it nor did I get the 
information I needed that I would have gotten had I had a 
highlight of Mr. Dulles statement and that is why I am taking

this position at this time. 
(:) Senator Johnson. 1 think that's right and I have no 
desire to make a point of it except this. The practice has 
(07) .vlimn in-the Committee not to have prePared statements. This 
is the last witness. No person has been allowed to come in 
with a prepared statement whether it is five pages or five 
hours. Now if we desire to make an exception and the 
Secretary of Defense desires to make an exception, we 
can do that and I have no objection to it if the Committee 
wishes. 
think the better course of wisdom would be for him 
to distribute his statement, let the members examine it, 
(7.) let him highlight it in his own way and then let each member 
C 
ask questions after counsel has concluded. But if you care 
to have it formally read at this time, and that is your 
zequest I will put the question. 
Senator Smith. Mr. Chairman, as usual you are very 
fair in this and I would leave it to the Secretary. I would 
like it read. 
Senator Johnson. Without objection then the 
Secretary will read his statement.

bd10 TESTIMONY OF HONORABLE THOMAS S. GATES, JR. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE 
Secretary Gates. Mr. Chairman, I have a short statement. 
The major threat confronting us today is the persistent 
and relentless drive of communism toward an unchanged goal --
a communist controlled world. This threat is real and formid-
able. It encompasses all fields of human endeavor. It is 
military, political, economic and psychological. 
It is important that we keep this complex threat in per-
spective. To do so we must examine each part in relationship 
to the whole. 
By the same token we must examine our own capabilities in 
the same manner. In the military field we must consider the 
entire picture and not an isolated part, regardless of how dra-
matic that part may be. 
Our military requirements must be based on our needs and 
consistent with national objectives. The communist military 
requirements are vastly different. That is one reason we do 
not need to match the communists bomber for bomber: missile for 
missile, division for division or submarine for submarine. 
We need military strength which will convince the commu-
nist leadership that no matter how hard it strikes it will be 
hit back so hard that its structure will collapse. 
An aggressor's destruction must be so inevitable that 
initiating war is tantamount to suicide. That strength I

bend 
614 
believe we have now, and our defense programs are designed 
to maintain this strength. This conviction is shared by my 
principal military and scientific advisers. 
1. Some of the facts which support this judgment are: 
a. Our total strength, widely deployed within the 
United States and around the periphery. of a single strategic 
target area, is so great that any surprise attack upon us vould 
result in unacceptable destruction to the attacker. 
Contributing to this deterrent are tactical fighter bombers 
and light bombers plus tactical missiles and carrier attack 
aircraft in addition to the weapons of the Strategic Air 
Command. 
b. The establishment of early warning systems, the 
capability for an airborne alert at the time and on the scale 
needed, and the deployment of mobile, hardened, and concealed 
missiles are progressing as planned. Our defense programs are 
under continuous review to insure that we maintain a long-
range program of military strength. For example, we are acceler-
ating the second MEWS station to bring it into operation 
lour months ahead of schedule. 
c. Funds are included in the 1960 and 1961 budgets to 
provide an airborne alert capability for our heavy bombers. 
The extent of this effort is substantial. $142 million will be 
obligated this year and $85 million next year.

bd12 parts and the training of crews so that an airborne alert can 
be mounted if and when the need should arise. The Joint Chiefs 
of Staff and I agree that we do not need to fly airborne alert 
now but we do need the capability to do so during periods 
of tension which may lie ahead. 
The Congress has assisted this program by enacting 
Section 612(b) in the 1960 Defense Appropriations Act which 
authorizes the incurring of deficiencies for this purpose. 
We are requesting xe-enacting of this provision in the 1961 
Act. 
d. The intercontinental missile is a new aid vitally 
important weapon that will profoundly affect the character 
of our problem. However, the threat it poses is not best coun-
tered by matching missile for missile. 
In fact, we must not allow ourselves to over-concentrate 
on any instrument of war. Rather the solution to our maintaining 
a valid and effective defense posture is by having in being 
a variety of types of weapons systems capable of successfully 
countering all types of threats facing us and our allies. 
2. We have nuclear weapons that exceed thossof the 
USSR by several times in total destructive power. We have 
long-range means of delivery that exceed theirs by several 
times in total carrying capacity. We have, in coMbination, 
"enough" to bring destruction to anyone who attacks us. 
We are designing our programs to maintain this strength.

bd1.3 13 Last year we had available to us the National Intelli-
gence Estimate which gave us the numbers of operational 
ICBMs which the USSR could achieve or might achieve in 
various time periods. These were calculated to cover either 
of two possibilities: One, that the Soviets would pursue 
and the other, that they 
a vigorous but orderly ICBM program, 
would pursue a highly accelerated or "crash" program. 
A year has now passed. Additional information has been 
acquired and further refinement has been accomplished. Consid/ 
exing all the available evidence, we believe it is now well 
established that the USSR is not engaged in a crash program 
?-^????""""'"'"."."""""""?5".41.11.11616.41."1.1"111114.4..1 
for ICBM development. 
Whether we take the estimate of a year ago or the 
current estimate, it is my firm judgment and that of my 
military and scientific advisers that our deterrent and 
retaliatory position remains adequate to meet the threat 
today and in the years ahead. We do not foresee a time 
whenthe Soviets could launch an attack on us without inviting 
unacceptable damage to themselves in return. 
I should also like to make it clear that neither 
General Twining nor I have been deprived of essential elements 
-; 
of intelligence, nor do I believe that our testimony indicates 
that we have been deprived of such essential elements. 
The flow of intelligence information and its assessment 
by the Intelligence experts is a continuous process. General

Twining and I are kept constantly informed on important 
developments in this area. 
Because they started much earlier and stayed persistently 
with the same program, the USSR has booster engines, making 
possible exploration in deep space. 
Meanwhile, our nation has had to telescope time in 
this effort. The lost years cannot be regained overnight, 
even though our scientists and engineers have worked wonders. 
For the years immediately ahead it is important that we clearly 
differentiate space exploration from military weapons systems. 
At present the Department of Defense has no specific military 
requirements for so-called super-boosters. 
We are vitally interested in the development of larger 
boosters because the future may well bring specific 
military requirements for them. 
Our military satellite program is progressing as a matter 
of priority and is well supported by the propulsion systems 
of our ballistic missiles. 
Mr. Chairman, we are continuously reviewing our programs. 
We will not hesitate to come back to the Congress for addi-
tional funds at any time we feel such funds are required. We 
will not hesitate to take emergency measures. 
As of this time, I am'convinced that we are on a sound 
basis and have presented a properly balanced concept. We 
will continue to plan and to change as necessary. We must

I want to ask you one question though, Mr. Secretary,

in view of your statement that neither you nor General

I want to call your attention to page 411 of the hearings

"Senator Saltonstall. General Twining, you are 
telling us that until the time you saw this chart, either in 
this room or after it had been given to this committee, that 
you have never seen these calculations that CIA had made? 
"General Twining. I have seen some of them but not all 
of them." 
How do you reconcile that with the statement that you 
made that would imply that all the information had been 
seen? 
Secretary Gates. That was not an essential element 
of intelligence, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator Johnson. So the description of intelligence 
elements would not include these charts in their description. 
Secretary Gates. No, sir, it would include those 
charts, but it would not include certain figures that did

( 
(:) two years that were under comparison. 
Senator Johnson. 
Counsel? 
Mr. Weisl. Mr. Secretary, the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense, namely the Comptroller, has provided a summary 
which shows that the Department of Defense has underestimated 
the funds required for IRBMs and ICBM programs each and every 
year since 1955, and I read: 
For Fiscal Year 1955 the budget request for these 
weapons was 40 and nine-tenths million. The amount finally 
programmed was 158 and nine-tenths million. FY 1956 the 
budget request was 159 and three-tenths million. The program 
finally approved was 526 and three-tenths million. FY 1957 
the budget request was 858 and nine-tenths million. The 
amount finally programmed was one billion four hundred million 
and nine-tenths. FY 1958 the budget request of the Department 
of Defense was one billion nine hundred thirty-seven and 
three-tenths million. 
The amount finally programmed was two billion one hundred 
forty-nine and eight-tenths million. For Fiscal Year 1959 the 
budget request was two billion three hundred ninety-one 
million. The amount finally programmed was two billion nine 
hundred forty-five and six-tenths million. For Fiscal Year 
1960 the budget request was two billion five hundred twenty-
two and eight-tenths billion, and the amount finally

620 
bd17 programmed was three., billion three hundred three million 
and three-tenths. Can you explain to this committee why 
the Department of Defense has been so consistently wrong 
in underestimating the amounts required for ballistic missile 
programs? 
Secretary Gates. I can only explain it, Mr. Weisl, 
to the effect that this is a new program, a new art in terms 
of years. It is changing extremely rapidly, and is 
under continuous review. It relies on tests, and there are 
continuous changes in it. It is not unusual for the 
Department of Defense to reprogram in all of its programs, 
procurement programs. 
But it is true that decision are made throughout the 
years and on a month by month basis that change the 
figures. This is still going on as of today. 
Mr. weld'. why have the budget requests so largely 
underestimated the requirements not for one year but for 
six years, consistently? 
Secretary Gates. I think my answer is just as I gave it. 
You must remember that it used to take 10 years to develop 
an airplane weapons system. We are dealing with the first 
six years of expenditures of substantial amounts for these 
missile programs. This is a new business, and subject to 
comparative analyses, scientific review and test success or 
failures repeatedly, and we do the best we can to estimate

621 
when ye make up a budget which is in the fall for an 16 
month period ahead, and it is not unusual to have this kind 
of an overrun in a new program, or an underestimate in a 
new program. 
Mr. Weisl. My question is why have you always erred 
by underestimating and never over-estimating for six straight 
years? 
Secretary Gates. I think I have answered the question 
as best I cane six. 
Mr. Weisl. May I ask this question: If we can't 
estimate our own requirements on a year by year basis, how can 
we estimate the Russians requirements three years ahead? 
Secretary Gates. We can only estimate the Russian 
requirements on the basis of the best intelligence that 
we can acquire in a field that is obviously an inexact 
science, so that we do the best we can. 
Mr. Weisl, I am sure you do, Mr. Secretary. But my 
question is tilt having more intelligence about our own 
requirements, and if we underestimate them year by year for 
six straight years, how can we estimate the Russian 
requirements or intentions, for three years ahead, with an 
degree of reliability? 
Secretary Gates. Well, this is another thing similar 
to the changes in our own programs. We are reviewing the 
information we have on their programs on a monthly and 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6

622 
bd19 regular basis, and our estimates change on their program 
as we go down the line. 
Mr. Weis/. But we could be just as wrong in underestimat-
ing their intentions or capabilities or programs, certainly 
can be just as wrong as we have been underestimating our own, 
can't we? 
Secretary Gates. I don't know how wrong we have been in 
underestimating our missiles in terms of numbers. we may 
have been wrong in underestimating our dollars. As fax as / 
know, we do-Alt have any estimate of their dollars. 
Mr. Weisl. Dont numbers translate themselves into 
dollars? 
Secretary Gates. No, sir. They translate themselves 
into a whole variety of factors, training, construction, 
research and operational instruments. 
Mr. Weisl. But the more dollars we have, the more train-
ing and research and other elements are available, isn't that 
true? 
Secretary Gates. Yes. 
Mr. Weia. And the less dollars we request, the less 
training and research and other elements are available. 
Secretary Gates. Yes, but these things are very difficult 
to estimate, as I said before, in a new field, and I think 
we have done remarkably well frankly in a new field to do as 
well as we could compared to our historical experience with

other types of weapons systems. 
)Mr. Weisl. Since there is about a two year lead time in 
missile programs; won't we be in trouble if we change our 
estimates a year from now? 
Secretary Gates. If we change our estimates on either 
side we have to adjust for these changes. We may not be 
in trouble but we must be flexible and alert to such 
changes as a possibility. 
Mr. Weisl. Can we ever make up for lost lead time? 
Secretary Gates. Lead time is very difficult, depending 
on the type of installation you am talking about. Lead time 
of hardened missiles is about 30 months, and you can make up 
for lost lead time in other ways of countering the threat, 
but in certain specific weapons systems, you cannot make up 
for lost lead time. 
Mr. Weisl. General Schriever testified that because 
we did not make the right decisions two years ago, we have 
fewer /CMs today than we could have had, had we made 
the right decisions then. Do you agree with that testimony? 
Secretary Gates. If we decided to put more effort 
several years ago into a particular type of system, we could 
have done so and we would have had more of that system, but 
we decided it would be wiser from the standpoint of national 
defense to diversify our systems and to move into newer 
types of missiles that were better, in the fact that they

bd21 could be more mobile and more widely dispersed and more 
invulnerable. 
Mr. Weisl. General Schriever further testified that 
we could increase the number of operational ICBMs that we 
could have by 1962 if we made the necessary decisions now. 
Have you reconsidered the current ICBM programs? 
Secretary Gates. Yes. I have not completed the recon-
sideration of them, but we have been studying certain factors 
that have been introduced, and I hare personally been briefed 
on certain possibilities, largely alternate possibilities 
that might make it possible for us to, after review particu-
larly by the Joint Chiefs of Staff1 to make recommendations 
to change the recommendations that we have heretofore made. 
We have these under consideration. 
Mr. Weis 1. But no decision has been made. 
Secretary Gates. No. That is correct, sir. 
Mr. Weis'. Do you have any doubt as to the need for 
more ICBMs? 
Secretary Gates. I have no doubt that we must 
have an invulnerable and a strong deterrent posture based 
on a total mix of weapons systems. I cannot look at an 
isolated system without looking at the total, and the whole. 
So I would balance the need for ICBMs with the other systems 
we have under development and the various types of ICBMs we 
have under development. I would also take a long look at the

vs bd22 Polaris system which / have always considered in my own 
(:) mind to be an intercontinental ballistic missiles and have 
always referred to it as such, perhaps because I was involved 
with it from its inception. 
Mr. Weisl. Mr. Secretary, may I refer you to an address 
that you made when you were retiring as Secretary of the Navy? 
This address was made to the Navy League in May of 1959, and 
in that address you made the following statement, and I 
quote: 
"In a limited war situation the Navy must maintain 
a capability to use either nuclear or conventional weapons 
to the controlled degree necessary to achieve the objective. 
More funds are required for this purpose. Mor accent 
on its importance is needed. This sort will have to 
come from the elimination of certain of the very expensive 
mass destruction single purpose weapons systems which 
have aIriority of claims against our national resources." 
Now first of all you did say that more funds would be 
required for that purpose. Have more funds been asked for 
for that purpose? 
Secretary Gates, Yes. I think we have been putting 
(:) more money into our limited war capability each year. This is 
the total money that goes toward 
4110140?0 
(:) Mr. Weisl. You mean more money from year to year, 
Mr. Secretary.

bd23 Secretary Gates._ T think we have been trying to balance 
.the three missions that we have in the Deoartment pf Defense, 
thigh that speech, refers to, between our strategic general war 
weapons systems and our limited war systems. I think that 
we are still trying to make this correct balance. 
Mr. Weisl. Will you supply for the record the figures 
to indicate what you state, that you have put more money into 
conventional warfare capabilities from year to year? 
Secretary Gates. I will try, Mx. Weisl. This is very 
difficult because this involves the effort that practically 
mapresents the Army, the Navy and the Marine Corps, and their 
modernization, which is not all that they would like to have. 
But we think we are making progress on. You must remember 
there I spoke as a Service Secretary, and I believe at that 
time I tried to be non-Parochial. I believed at that time 
in proper balance. I believe in it even more today. 
Senator Jackson. Will the counsel separate that question 
so that you can ask for the amount requested by the Bureau 
of Budget and the amount actually out in by Congress, especial-
ly as it relates to modernization of weapons? 
Secretary Gates. The amount requested, Senator 
Jackson, by the Bureau of the Budget. 
Mr. Weisl. The amount requested by the Department of 
Defense and cleared by the Bureau of the Budget, and the 
amount appropriated for this purpose by Congress.

bd24 Secretary Gates. Yes. I am not trying to avoid doing 
any homework, Mr. Weisi. It is going to be very difficult to 
separate out forces as pertaining to limited war. Many people 
have tried to put our budget on a functional basis, and we 
have found it absolutely impossible to do so. 
Senator Saltonstall, Mr. Chairman, would the Senator 
yield for a technical question, Mr. Weisi? 
Mr. weisl, I wonder if that question can be answered. 
For instance, is an aircraft carrier a conventional weapon 
or a strategic weapon? Is a tank that will fire a gun, 
that will fire a cannon 500 miles a strategic weapon or a 
conventional weapon? 
I just point out that I think it is a very difficult 
question to answer in the form that you have asked it. 
I say that most respectfully. 
Secretary Gates. If I may say the Senator has outlined 
some of the very real reasons that it is almost impossible 
to put a functional budget out for the Department of 
Defense. 
Senator Jackson. I think right at that point the 
Secretaries, Mr. Secretary, for the individual services 
have been LIP, and made their point that they need additional 
funds, for example, for modernization. This is the area that 
(:) is indeed limited primarily to limited war. 
Secretary Gates. That?s right.

628 
bd25 Senator Jackson. And certainly you can split it 
from that. Otherwise, of course, you could never get an answer. 
Secretary Gates. We can give you an answer on such 
(7.) things as Army modernization which is the Army Procurement 
account and on the Navy shipbuilding account in some 
categories. We will try, Mx. Weisl. 
Mr. Weisl. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Now last year 
General Taylor stated that two of his principal reservations 
concerning the 1960 budget were inadequate provision for 
Army modernization and for early production of 
Nike-Zeus. The Congress was convinced apparently of these 
requirements, and appropriated 382 million over the budget 
(7.) request for Army procurement. The Army head has testified 
that only 43 million of this has been made available for 
the Army modernization during 1960. Why has the Congressional 
intent been completely disregarded? 
Secretary Gates. My recollection, Mr. Weisl, is that 
all of that money has been made available to the Army with 
the exception of 137 million dollars which was supposed to be 
applied to the production of the Nike-Zeus system, and since 
we made a decision to have fullscale tests on a research basis 
of the Nike-Zeus system and to not put the system in production, 
(:) 
we have not released that $137 million. But my understanding 
(:) is the rest of the money has been released to the Army. 
Now thEre maybe a few, a small portion of it that we have not

(:) are going to buy. 
But in essence it is or will be released. 
Mr. Weisl. Have you read the testimony of General 
Traub on this subject before the Appropriations Committee 
of the House? 
Secretary Gates. No, sir. 
Mr. Weisl. Would you be kind enough to read it and 
supplement your testimony if you think it is necessary? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. I am aware 
Mr. Weisl. In that respect. 
Secretary Gates. I read the Secretary's testimony. I 
did not read General Traub's. 
Mr. weisl. In your statement that I just read, you 
make this observatio, and I quote: Referring to support of 
the Program that you then advocated: 
"This support will have to come from the elimination 
of certain of the very expensive mass destruction single 
purpose systems which have a priority of claims against our 
national resources." 
Now what did you mean by that? What will have to be 
eliminated in the expensive mass destruction single-
purpose weapons systems? 
Secretary Gates. I meant by that I am sure that at that 
time we had to make choices between the variety of different

d27 ways we had of carrying out our strategic mission, and this 
is true. 
We have made,choices, such as Navajo and, other weapons 
that have been changed. ,I meant that in the long run you , 
should not develop too many competing weapons systems for a 
single purpose. 
Mr. Weisl. The Navajo, Mr. Secretary, was canceled 
many years before you made this talk. 
What expensive mass destruction single-purpose weapons 
systems did you think ought to be eliminated? 
Secretary Gates. I wouldn't have been able at that time 
to have had a judgment on it. I just was talking abDut how 
much is enough for the strategic purpose. 
Mr. Weisl. Has any decision ever been made as to how 
much is enough? 
Secretary Gates. No. We do the best we can with it. 
We make studies and evaluations of it. 
Mr. Weisl. But you must have had in mind, Mr. Secretary, 
*AI WW1 
Secretary Gates. I didn't have in mind -- I had in mind 
a broad category of systems. I wasn't competent as Secretary 
of the Navy to determine which system versus which other 
system.

to come from the elimination of certain of the very expensive

Secretary Gates. That's right. 
Mr. Weisl. Now, which ones did you have in mind? Did 
you have in mind the Atlas? 
Secretary Gates. No, sir. 
Mr. Weisl. Is that a single-purpose weapon? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Weil. Did you have in mind the Titan? 
Secretary Gates. I had in mind the whole category of 
systems that were under contemplation or under research or 
in development, that when they came into certain stages 
they all compete with each other. This is one of the argu-
ments I am having in my present capacity about the 8-70 
airplane, for example, which we have talked about in other 
committees. I had in mind that you have to make decisions 
between these weapons systems: as you see was involved 
in them, and you see what dates they are going to come into 
operational capacity and take a look at these in regard to 
the total balance ofyour military power. 
Mr. Weisl. Let us try to be a little more specific. 
The single-purpose mass destruction weapons are the Atlas, 
the Titan, the Minuteman and the Polaris, is that true? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, plus the 8-52. 
Mx. Weisle Plus the 8-52, the 8-58, the 8-70. That is 
true. Now which one of these did you have in mind eliminating

Secretary Gates. I didn't have anyone in mind. I didn't 
have the competence to name one of them. I had in mind 
the category had to be reviewed. 
Mr. Weisl. You talked about elimination. 
Secretary Gates. And some would have to be eliminated. 
Mr. Weisl. Now how do you feel about that today? Do 
you :feel that some of them have to be eliminated? 
Secretary Gates. I feel that we always have to review 
these programs and keep a well-balanced defense posture, and 
not rely on a single type of systems for our effort, yes, 
so in the long run some of them will be eliminated. 
Mr. Weisl. Which ones do you have in mind eliminating? 
Secretary Gates. None, sir, right now. 
Mr. Weisl. In your opinion do Soviet manned bombers 
pose a current threat to the United States? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Weisl. In view of this threat, will you be kind 
enough to explain the abrupt removal of 15 ships from the 
seaward extension of the DEW line over the objections of 
the Commander in Chief of the North American Air Defense 
Command? 
Was this done for military reasons or budgetary 
reasons? 
Secretary Gates. While the Soviet manned bomber remains

bd30 a threat, again it is a matter of balance and degree. 
(1,1) When this extension of the DEW line was contemplated, I believe 
it was 1955, and I believe it was put into being in 1957. 
(:) After a review of the Continental Defense picture again, 
and after consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, it 
was considered that we could reduce somewhat the effort in 
connection with both Air Force tactical fighter squadrons 
and Navy ships in supporting this concept that was, as I say: 
devised five years ago. Those ships are not going out 
of existence in total. 
Some of them are going to still go on part of the same 
mission bl being used in what is called the continuous 
(:) warning line, and others will replace older Navy ships 
that will be put into mothballs. 
Mr. Weisl, May I read you from a memorandum submitted 
to us by the Department of the Navy on this subject on March 
8, /960, and I read from paragraph 3: 
"General Nuter notified the Joint Chiefs of Staff that 
he recommended against this action in that removal of the 
picket ships would degrade the warning capability of the 
seaward extension of the DEW lines, and that the WV-2 
(:) aircraft which would remain flying these extension lines 
would not have as good detection capability as would the 
(:) ships." 
Secretary Gates. That is correct. General Kuter

bd3/ recommended that in a Commanders Conference, unified 
Commanders Conference we held, in Norfolk in the first early 
days of January. We did not agree with General Kuter. 
Mr. Weisl. Who are the "we" that did not agree? 
Secretary Gates. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and myself. 
Mr. Weisl. Was that unanimous? 
Secretary Gates. As far as I know it was, Mr. Weisl. 
Mr. Weis/, General White concurred in that? 
Secretary Gates. I would want to check and see whether 
we made a record of this, but I never recall any objection 
from General White. 
Mr. Weisl. Did Admiral Burke concur in it? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, 
Mr. Weisl, And General Lemnitzer? 
Secretary Gates. Yes. 
Mr. Weis/. And General Shoup of the Marine Corps? 
Secretary Gates. Yes. 
Mr. Weisl. I would like to place in the record if 
there is no objection the memorandum, the entire memorandum of 
the Department of Defense on this subject. 
In January of this year, Mr. Secretary, you submitted 
the following unclassified 
Senator Saltonstall. Mr. Chairman, on the question of 
Procedure I assume that that is going in, that memorandum. 
Senator Symington. Does anybody object to the memorandum

bd33 Mr. Weis/. In aanuary of this year Mr. Secretary, 
you submitted the following unclassified official statement, 
and I quote: 
(.1) "It has been stated on previous occasions that the 
Soviet superiority in /CBMs could be in the order of 3 to 1 
in the period 1960 to 1963. This statement was based upon 
estimates of what the USSR could produce in numbers of missiles, 
and was not an affirmative statement of fact that the USSR 
T:ould produce the number of missiles required to attain this 
superiority. On the basis of our current intelligence esti-
mate, which has been presented to the Committee by the Direc-
tor of Central Intelligence Agency, we do not now believe ' 
that the Soviets superiority in ICBMs will be as great as 
that previously estimated." 
04. 
While we do not want to discuss in any sense the 
number of missiles in this session, it seems to me that it is 
appropriate to discuss the ratios that you raised. On the 
basis of the revised national intelligence estimates to which 
you referred, and on our currently approved programs, will the 
Soviet have a superiority of more or less than 3 to 1 in 
mid-1961? 
Secretary Gates. This testimony I believe you are refer-
ring to was before the House Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. Weisl. Yes, sir. 
Secretary Gates. I tried very hard not to discuss the 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
637 
bd34 numbers of missiles, the relative number of missiles in 
(7) my testimony before that committee. I made it as clear 
as I could that these numbers in themselves were misleading, 
(7.) that we had to rely upon a variety of factors when we were 
C 
talking about such numbers, such as accuracy, reliability, the 
condition of our own defense posture, relative hardening and 
the time that we were discussing. I think these numbers and 
ratios pertaining to them are extremely difficult to not have 
confusing. We must look at this constantly, and it depends 
on the way you start off, how you start to compare what 
the so-called ground rules might be, and it depends on the 
time that you are discussing. I tried my best in that 
testimony to bring out these factors, with the hope that 
we would not get into a discussion which has later of course 
developed concerning these numbers, because they are misleading 
unless you consider the total problem that is involved. 
Mr. weisl. I did not bring up the numbers. You are 
the one that in your statement stated 
WWI.* 
Secretary Gates. You are bringing up testimony which 
led to this, which is part of the identical page of discus-
sion or the identical two or three pages of the discussion 
leading up to the statement you quoted. 
Mr. Weisl. But you made that statement to the committee 
and in your prepared statement you stated as follows, and I 
read:

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
638 
bd35 if we compare the estimated Soviet ICBM and the 
sea-launched missile programs with plans for deployment of 
U. S. ICBMs and Polaris missiles we know that the Soviets 
may enjoy at times a moderate numerical superiority during 
the next three years. 
"This difference in numbers appears to peak during the 
1962 period." 
That was in your prepared statement. It was not the 
result ot any questioning. 
Secretary Gates. That is correct/ six. 
Mx. Weis!, And the committee tried to find out what you 
meant by moderate superiority/ and that is what I am trying 
to find out/ and in that regard, since Secretary McElroy/ 
your predecessor, over television publicly stated that there 
will be a 3 to 1 superiority: and you stated that new 
intelligence estimates indicate some change in that, I am 
siwply asking you whether the change in mid-1961 will be 
less than 3 to 1? 
Secretary Cates. I can't answer that: Mr. Weisl. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, may I inject 
for just a second, this is a matter on which there has 
been I think more discussion than on anything I know of 
in this whole area. 
I wonder if in order to get the exact facts, without 
any reservation as to concern for the country's security we

information that has been given to anybody yet that has not 
already been given out by the Secretary of Defense. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. That isn't the point, Mx. 
Chairman. 
senator Symington. I haven't seen any intention or 
implication of the counsel to give out any classified infor-
mation. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. There is no suggestion of 
that. 
Senator Symington. The counsel has pointed out that the 
subject has been raised voluntarily by the Secretary of 
Defense. We have also had testimony that the gap has not 
narrowed. It has increased. I think the counsel, 
inasmuch as the American people want to know what the facts 
are, should be allowed to pursue the matter the way he thinks 
best, because he has the interest of classified material at 
heart just as much as any member of the committee. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I haven't 
made myself clear. 
Senator Symington. / am sorry. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. There is no suggestion 
that counsel should be deterred from any questioning along

(:) Senator Symington. Would the counsel listen to the com-
ments of the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. 
(:) Senator Case of New Jersey. There is no desire on my 
part to stop counsel from pursuing this line so far as he 
thinks it is desirable of course at this time. / only wanted 
to make the point that for my own sake and I think many people 
would agree, it is very desirable that we ask the Secretary 
to appear before us in executive session on this point so that 
-------------
' 
we may go into exact detail as to the meaning of his state-
ment, and make it clear to me at least as a member of the 
committee -- perhaps I haven't gotten all the 
nuancesof the testimony so fax, something that is not yet 
clear and I doubt can be made clear without our being in 
executive session. 
Senator Symington. I must say with great respect I 
disagree with the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. 
0.11?11.1I 
Sena tor Case of New Jersey. This indicates an inadequacy 
on my part but I still pursue my suggestion. 
Senator Symington. May I continue? Statements have 
been made publicly by the Secretary of Defense and by the 
Secretary of the Air Force that the gap has either been 
reduced or eliminated. That was in public session. Statements 
have been made in private session by the Director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency that the launching capability gap has

increased. I believe that we have to leave it up to the 
counsel of the committee, who is mindful of the importance of 
classified material, to question the witness as to who was 
right. 
Was he right? Was the Secretary of the Air Force right 
in a television broadcast, or was the Director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency right with respect to what has happened 
to this gap in the last 12 months? 
Senator Case of South Dakota. Mr. Chairman, I would 
like to respectfully suggest that what counsel is doing --
Senator Symington. May I continue? 
I am sure that the Senator from New Jersey wants to 
see the facts given out to the people to the best of the 
counsel and the witness'ibility without getting into classi-
fied material. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. Of course the Senator from 
New Jersey wants this and that has always been his position. 
It is his position now. It is his position however further 
that we can more quickly come to an understanding of this 
either that someone has been wrong or that there has been a 
misunderstanding by completely open frank testimony in execu-
tive session and then make the explanation in our reports 
and otherwise as the facts may determine. 
But I for one do feel that this is a matter we should 
go into in detail in executive session where there is no

642 
bd39 question of our skirting the line of secrecy. It is a 
(:) very delicate issue and I believe we ought to have the facts 
but we ought to have them first in executive session. 
(:) I don't suggest for a second that counsel is not entirely 
right in raising the question or pursuing it as fax as he thinks 
he can in open session. 
I merely want to have an assurance if we may that an 
executive session with the Secretary will be available to 
us to go into the matter as far as some of us at least think 
it should be pursued. 
Senator Symington. Senator Jackson? 
Senator Jackson. Will the Chair yield? Would it not 
be in order in a lawyexlike way for the counsel to have 
(:) 
the right to cross-examine the Secretary in the area that he 
placed in the public domain, that is namely the statement 
that counsel read, which has been or was made public in the 
Appropriations Committee, and to propound the necessary 
questions as to whether or not there has been any change? 
Senator Case of New Jersey. May I just make one comment 
on this, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator Jackson. It seems to me how anyone can argue 
against that as fax as security, it is beyond my understandi g. 
(:) I agree with the Senator from New Jersey that it would be 
helpful and it should be in executive session to get back 
of all of this, which the Secretary wants to point out, that

bvd 40 is the matter of other weapons systems. But it would 
(:) seem completely in order and entirely in keeping with the 
right to cross-examine that area of the statement already 
(7) rade public, unless there is some clear-cut reason why security 
is involved. 
Senator Case,) of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, may I just 
comment on that? 
think what has happened is this: The Secretary made 
a statement. Testimony taken before us in executive session 
from the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency appears 
_ 
..?????????????????????....1.11.00.????.-a 
to some to be in conflict at some point. The questioning 
(...........????????????......???????????????????,*.a.  
of the witness is now being based upon both his open 
statement and the Director of Intelligence Agency's 
testimony before us in secret session, and I think we are 
not going to get a complete final answer on the basis of 
that without going into executive session. i do not in any 
way protest counsel's pursuing this as far as he thinks 
proper at this time. 
I merely want before this matter is closed to have an 
assurance if we may that we may pursue this in a way that 
/ think is necessary in executive session before the 
matter is closed or considered closed by the Committee. 
Senator Jackson, isn't it entirely in order to simply 
ask whether that statement still stands? The statement has 
been made public.

644 
Aren't the American people entitled to know whether 
the statement is still correct? 
Senator Case of New Jersey. The American people are 
entitled to have every possible bit of information consistent 
with security. As a member of this committee, I feel I 
would like to have it explained to me in executive session 
in which we can pursue it in detail so that my own understand-
ing is as good as I think my duties as a Senator are required 
to be. 
Senator Jackson. I understand that, but I just for the 
life of me dontlt understand why you can't ask whether a 
previous public statement still stands. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. I am not suggesting 
that that question should not be asked as I said I think several 
times. 
Senator Symington. Senator Case of South Dakota? 
Senator Case of south Dakota. Mr. Chairman, it seems 
to me that the problem arises from the fact that the Secretary 
is being asked to comment upon yardsticks used by other 
persons. There is nothing that I have heard this morning 
that would indicate that former. Secretary McElroy and 
Secretary gates used the same definition of terms in their 
comparisons. Further than that, with respect to asking the 
Secretary to comment upon a suggested statement or position 
indicated by the Director of Intelligence, Mr. Dulles, relating 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
645 
to comparative strengths overlooks the fact that Mr. 
Dulles in the executive sessioo which I heard at least 
talked about an entirely different thing. And further than 
that, Mr. Dulles has repeatedly refused to make a comparative 
statement. 
He has said that he coullgive such intelligence as he 
might have in the foreign field, but that it was beyond the 
ampetence of the CIA to go into domestic figures, so that 
he has refrained from comparative figures. And any attempt 
to suggest that Mr. Dulles has made a comparative statement 
I think would be unfair to Mr. Dulles, and to ask Mr. 
Gates to comment upon an alleged comparative position taken 
by Mr. Dulles would bewithout foundation. 
Senator Symington. Is the Senator finished? 
Senator Case of South Dakota. Yes. 
Senator Symington. I would like to make a couple of 
observations on my own. First: I do not agree with the 
Senator from South Dakota. I believe the information that 
was furnished in committee by the Director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency when compared with the information 
that was furnished in committee by the Secretary of Defense 
shows that there is a direct disagreement as to what the 
strength of the Soviets in this field is 
.11,1111= 
Senator Case of South Dakota. But that is the 
Senator's comparison, not Mr. Dulles. 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
646 
bd43 Senator Symington. Let me finish, please. 
That, is the first point. The secont point, is that I. think 
there is a great deal, more danger of ,insequrity and lack of 
security in attempting to have information giveIout in 
open bearings whiCh in effect is contradicted in closed 
hearings than there would be in releasing this testimony 
as to what we think the Soviet is doing. First they know what 
they are doing, and secondly based on our system it is a com-
paratively simple matter for them to find out what we are 
doing. 
Therefore, as 1 understand it, the Senator from New 
Jersey, what he is suggesting is that we have a classified 
hearing later on. Now 1 have been on this committee for a 
(:) 
great many years and testified before it for a great many 
years in addition. 
know of no case where we haven?t had classified hear-
ings either before or after public hearings in order to get 
the truth out to the people so long as I have been connected 
with this committee either as a witness or as a member, and 
would hope at this time that this able counsel who is giving 
up his time and effort to do this job is not in any way 
hindered by comments as to whether or not he is pursuing a 
proper line of questioning of the witness. 
yield to the Senator from Washington. 
Senator Jackson. As I understand it, Mr. Chairman: the 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
647 
d44 Secretary placed the statement, the now public statement, 
in the record after the hearing. Is that not correct? 
Secretary Gates. Two statements have been read by 
counsel. One was my public statement, prepared statement. 
Another statement was the one I guess you are referring 
to Senator Jackson. 
Senator Jackson. Yes. But you had plenty of time to 
think through the security angle, right? 
Secretary Gates. That was placed at the request of the 
committee after the hearing. 
Senator Jackson. And is this not the statement, the 
one that counsel read to you? Wasn2t that the one that you 
placed in tie record alter deliberation? 
Secretary Gates. That is correct. 
Senator Jackson. And did you not state in that statement, 
"On the basis of our current intelligence estimate which has 
been presented to the committee by the Director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency we do not now believe the Soviet superiori-
ty in ICBMs will be as great as previously estimated." 
I merely make this point to our colleagues who have refer-
red to a reference to the CIA, that the Secretary of Defense, 
after thoughtful consideration, based his statement by 
referring to estimates supplied by the CIA. So I hardly 
(:) understand the relevance, Mr. Chairman, to the exclusion of 
counsel from asking questions that refer to information 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6

thoughtful consideration, referred to the CIA as a source 
of reference. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. , M. Chairman. 
Senator Symington. Senator Case. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. In the first place I think 
I am probably the last person who would be in any way 
suggesting that what counsel, particularly this particular 
counsel, what he is doing is improper. This is not so. 
And any suggestion that that is my purpose ought to be 
immediately eliminated. What I am suggesting is that in 
order for me, and I am talking about me, I am not talking 
about anybody else, to have the kind of understanding that 
I think as a member of the Senate of the United States I 
ought to have of this matter, it will be necessary for us 
to go into executive session for this reason. 
The Secretary made a statement. Some people have sugges-
ted that tilt is contradicted by testimony given before us 
in secret session. For us to determine this requires us 
in my judgment to go into secret session. The quicker we do 
it, the better. I think we should have done it before we had 
an open session on this point. / hope at least we will have 
a secret session hereafter.

bd46 Senator Saltonstall. My remark is this: The Chairman 
stated this hearing was going to be over at 12 o'clock. 
I have checked and the counsel has about 7 more minutes. 
With the number of people here, there is 75 minutes of ques-
tioning. If we are going to give an opportunity to each 
one to question, I hope we will let the counsel proceed. 
Senator Symington. May I respectfully say to my friend 
from Massachusetts that the matter was not raised on this 
side of the aisle, that being raised there ought to be 
a fair and open discussion of the matter so that the people 
understand what we are talking about. 
Is there anybody here who objects on the committee to 
having a classified session atter this open session? If 
there is not, without objection we will have an executive 
session, Mr. Secretary, in accordance with the suggestion 
of the Senator from New Jersey

bd47 to any testimony given by Mr. Dulles to us in executive - 
session. 
I was merely referring to the statement made by the 
Secretary, that on the basis of our current intelligence 
estimates that he had, not that we had, we now believe that th 
Soviet superiority in ICBMs will not be as great as that 
previously estimated. And since the previously estimated 
to which he referred, not I, was 3 to 1, I asked the question 
based upon the 3 to 1 that you yourself suggested, if that 
superiority has been decreased when you take into account 
missiles on launcher for mid-19601 1961 and '62. 
Secretary Gates. I have no way of knowing what combina-
tion of circumstances were used in the 3 to 1 that has been 
widely quoted. 
I jt dont know that. I believe that I stand 
on the statement that I submitted. I have no other way of 
commenting on it, Mr. Weisi. 
Mr. Weisl. But Mr. Secretary, you were the one that 
_ 
referred to the 3 to 1 superiority and you stated that 
this was based upon estimates of what the USSR could produce 
in numbers of missiles and was not an affirmative statement 
of fact that the USSR would produce the number of missiles 
required to attain this superiority. I am simply asking 
you whether on the basis of the current intelligence estimate 
that you referred to, not that I referred to, that 3 to 1 
ratio when you take into account missiles on launchers has

Secretary Gates. I do not really believe it is possible, 
I certainly do not want to add to the confusion, I don't 
believe it's possible to talk about ratios. I don't 
believe it is possible. I think the difference has narrowed. 
The difference this year between last year has narrowed 
when you consider the fact, as I said in my statement here 
today: that we had an estimate that they might indulge in 
a crash program. I believe that the situation has narrowed. 
I think it is terribly misleading to get into ratios 
and to, into specific numbers, and I wish there was a way 
so that none of us would be confused. 
I wish we could stay in open session and try and resolve 
the confusion. But to me numbers are misleading because 
you have to reconcile the other factors that go into numbers, 
and we are talking about only one weapons systems not other 
weapons systems. 
Personally, as I testified earlier here today, I consider 
the Polaris an ICBM, the Polaris system, not the missile. 
And if you count the Polaris in, you get a different set of 
numbers and a different set of ratios. If you take 
mid-calendar year versus end calendar year you get another 
set of numbers. 
To me it is unwise and misleading and difficult for 
any of us to understand without confusion if we deal in

other deterrents. 
(:) Senator Symington. Let the counsel proceed because 
a question has been raised by the ranking member. 
Senator Wiley. 
That is all I interrupted. You ought to 
give me a little concession once in a while. 
Senator Symington. You will be given all concessions. 
I am just trying to cooperate with the other side. 
Mr. Weisl, General Power testified we have no warning 
today against ballistic missiles and will not have a depen-
dable warning system for several years. He therefore recom-
mended that immediate provision be made to place a certain 
percentage of the SAC heavy bomber force on continuous 
airborne alert. 
As a matter of fact, General Power told this committee 
that this is number one priority. Do you agree with 
General Power? 
Secretary Gates. No, sir, this has been extremely 
carefully reviewed. It was reviewed last summer. I 
personally reviewed it last summer as Deputy Secretary of 
Defense. My predecessor reviewed it. We reviewed it again 
in this meeting I referred to in Norfolk of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff and Unified Commanders. We heard directly General 
Power's argument.

bd51 We all agree that we should have a capability to fly 
an airborne alert if and when it is needed. The Joint Chiefs 
of Staff and myself are agreed that such an airborne alert 
in the air as of now is not needed. The only real argument 
about this is the degree of the airborne alert capability 
that we purchase. This again is an extremely complicated 
subject. It depends on how long you fly the airplanes and 
so forth. 
I think that we are making the right move in buying a 
capability to fly an airborne alert if we need it. I do not 
believe it should be flown as of now. 
Mr. Weisl. How do we know when we will need it? 
Secretary Gates. We will need it if international 
tensions perhaps get worse. We will know when we will need 
it I hope we will know when we will need it. 
Mr. Weisl. What assurance hwe you that the Russians won't 
make a surprise attack similar to the attack by the Japs 
on Pearl Harbor? 
Secretary Gates. We do not believe that the Soviet 
Union is interested in committing suicide. 
Mr. Weisl. You are trying to read his mind. 
Secretary Gates. No, sir, I am zit trying to read his 
mind. I am saying he is perfectly capable of seeing what 
we have in being that will destroy him if he initiates that 
surprise attack.

bd52 Mr. Weisl. You heard the testimony of Genera/ Power, 
(:) that if, when and as he had a certain number of ICBMs, 
he might be able to destroy completely our retaliatory 
striking force. 
Secretary Gates. Yes, 
Mr. Weisl. If we had no warning system. 
Secretary Gates. Thi3was a hypothetical. 
Mr. Weisl. And no airborne alert of adequate proportions. 
Secretary Gates. A hypothetical mathematical analysis 
made with no time table, no estimate of our condition of readi-
ness, and I referred to it I believe as being somewhat unreali-
stic. 
(:) M. Weisl. And you disagree with General Power? 
Secretary Gates. Yes. sir. 
Mr. Weisl. Now may I call your attention to a 
statement made by Professor Kissinger, who was the Military 
Adviser to the Rockefeller Brothers Committee and is a 
Professor / think of Military Science at Harvard University, 
and I quote: 
He states: "If the proposals of Generals Power and 
White are accepted and prove to be wrong, we will have spent 
$500 million too much for a number of years. If the program 
of the President is adopted and he proves to be mistaken, we 
will have forfeited our national existence." 
Do you agree with that analysis of the Power Testimony

on an airborne alert? 
That is what Professor Kissinger was discussing. 
Secretary Gates. As I understand what you read, 
Kissinger recommended we spend $500 more million dollars a 
year or our survival was threatened. 
Mr. Weisl, No. 
Secretary Gates. We were finished. 
Mr. Weisl. What he said was if we were wrong in spending 
that amount of money we would have lost the money. But if the 
Department of Defense was wrong in not spending it we could 
lose our country. 
Secretary Cates. I donit think there is anyone wise 
enough to determine that $500 million of the defense budget 
the difference between survival and security. 
Mr. Weisl. He was referring to the airborne alert 
recommended by General Power. 
Secretary Gates. The airborne alert as I said, we 
agree we should have the capability to fly it. From a military 
point of view we do not believe it need be flown today. Actu-
ally it is again a matter of degree, Mr. Weisl. The airborne 
alert is in the air today in a certain sense. 
Mr. Weis'. But General Power 
Secretary Gates. We have airplanes in the air today 
on a fulltime basis.

657 
Secretary Cates. We believe the present program is 
correct. 
Mr. Weisl. Yes, I understand that but in reply to 
my question to General Power as to whetherke believed the 
present program was adequate, he answered definitely no. You 
are familiar with that testimony I take it. 
Secretary Gates. I am sorry1 sir, he answered no? Who? 
General Power? 
Mr. Weisl. General Power. 
Secretary Gates. Yes, tht is correct. I understand 
General Power made a recommendation for a larger effort 
toward an airborne alert. 
Mr. Weisl. Now in connection with warning against ICBMs 
General Power and General Schriever testified that it was 
urgent to assure the earliest possible development of the 
Midas satellite system. General Schriever stated that 
he was hopeful a decision would be made very soon to 
authorize proceeding with Midas as a weapons system. 
Has that decision been made? 
Secretary Gates. I agree that it is important to move 
ahead as rapidly as we can with the Midas system. I am 
advised that we are doing this as of the present time. 
Mr. Weisl. Are doing what? 
Secretary Gates. Moving ahead as rapidly as we can toward

Mr. Weisl. Has it been approved as a weapons system? 
Secretary Gates. It is probably a misnomer to call a

Secretary Gates. A satellite --
Mr. Weisl. It is a warning. 
Secretary Gates. Correct. 
Mr. Weisl. Has it been approved? 
Secretary Cates. Oh, yes. This is one of the lour 
space projects of the Department of Defense at high priority. 
Mr. Weisl. General Schriever testified too on that 
sUbject as follows: 
Referring to the Midas, "Well, I mean by that thk you 
decide at this point in time the system is technically feasible 
within a short period. If you make that decision, then you 
also have to plan on the ground bases that will support 
this system, the personnel who have to operate it and 
maintain it have to be trained, organizations have to be set 
up. The lead time involved in doing this is often consider-
ably greater than he production of the hardware itself. 
"So it is a matter of doing many things simultaneously 
rather than waiting until you have proved out through develop-
ment and tests that it works. If you wait until you have 
done that, then you have to take all these steps later." 
Do you agree with that statement by General Schriever,

bd56 referring to the Midas? 
Secretary Gates. I agree that we should move at highest 
priority on it and have so approved. I don't want to be 
nisleading. We are not going into the production on all these 
aspects of the Midas pmgram as of this time because our 
research and scientific people tell us we should not. / believe 
that within these next 6 months we will make such a decision. 
But it has highest priority and I agree with its importance. 
Mr. Weisl. At the request of this committee the Navy 
has prepared a summary of budgetary action on the Polaris 
system since FY 1958. Are you familiar with this summary 
which was cleared by your office for release to this commit-
tee? 
Secretary Gates. I read it last night, Mr. Weisl, but 
it is in such detailed Navy language / can probably not answer. 
I am familiar with it from my own experience in general 
terms. 
Mr. weisl. Yes. So that we can be fair, I would like, 
Mr. Chairman, to place this summary inthe record. 
Secretary Gates. This is the summary that starts in 
57 and goes through to the presents is that correct? 
Mr. Weis/. That is correct. 
Senator Symington. Is there objection? Without 
Objection that will be included as part of the record.

bd57 Mr. Weisl. This summary states, and I quote: 
"The program recommended by the Navy to the Department 
of Defense included 9 Polaris submarines in 1961 and provision 
for 12 in 1962 at an estimated cost of $1,654,000 in this 
amount would be made available. Yet latex it is stated that 
under the budget guidelines prescribed for FY 1961 the 
Navy could ask for only $1,089,000 covering four Polaris 
submarines in 1961 plus long lead time components for 
four more in 1962. The budget reduced this to $952,000,000 
covering only three Polaris submarines in 1961 plus advance pro-
curement for only 3 in 1962." 
Could you kindly explain exactly what happened to the 
Navyes original Polaris recommendations and why they could 
not be included in the official budget submissions? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. Over the past years we have 
made a great many recommendations from the Navy to the 
Department of Defense, all kinds of coMbinations of 
ships, missiles, tenders, supporting facilities and 
research money. We have gone on the principle that about 
three nuclear submarine systems per year was right, and 
vie have gone to the extent of 3.7 billion dollars so far 
through the 1961 period, until we had more confirmation and 
increasing confidence in this system and its being as 
good as we all hope it will be, I have testified this year 
that if we receive more confidence on this system, and it was

possible to reappraise it, which we are doing right now 
again as a matter of fact -- I have another letter from the 
Navy as of this week or last week on some recommendations. 
We are going to watch this very closely, and with more 
confidence we will not hesitate to give it further support. 
Mr. Weisl. My question is viny wasn't the recommendation 
included in the official budget submission ? 
Secretary Gates. Because we just felt that up until 
the time we had further tests and verifications, that we 
should not go any faster than 3 per year. 
Mr. weisl. My time is up, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, 
Mr. Secretary. 
Secretary Gates. Thank you, sir. 
Senator Symington. Senator SaLtonstall? 
Senator Saltonstall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Secretary, just a few questions in the time allowed 
me. You state upon page 4 of your prepared statement: 
"Rather than the solution to our maintaining a valid 
and effective defense posture by having in being a 
variety of weapons systems capable of countering all types 
and threats faced by us and our allies", and on page 5, 
the second sentence you stated, "We do not foresee a time 
when the Soviets could launch an attack on us without inviting 
unacceptable damage to themselves in return." 
We hear a lot about gaps of one kind and another.

bd59 You are relying on your judgment that our overall deter-
rent strength is sufficient today and on the plans that you 
are making in the Defense Department approved by the President 
are sufficient for the future years as far as you can see 
ahead, 1961, 2 and 30 we will say. 
Secretary Gates. That is correct, Senator Saltonstall, 
uLth the continuous proviso that this is a fast-moving business, 
and we must look at that at all times. 
Senator Saltonstall. And that you are looking at it 
at all times from all different types of weapons that compose 
the overall deterrent strength. 
Secretary Gates. That is correct. 
senator Saltonstal/. Now we hear a lot about intelligenc? 
estimates, estimates based on hard evidence, estimates based 
on soft evidence, estimates based we will say on inferences 
and information picked up that can't be too relied on. 
Those we learn are put together and recommended or given 
to the various officers of the government including yourself 
by Mr. Dulles. Now who makes the decisions to carry out 
that overall deterrent based on the intelligence estimates 
that are given you? 
Secretary Gates. The decisions are made ultimately by 
the President. The decisions are made by the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff and by myself and recommended to the President. 
Senator Sa/tonstall. So that the decisions that you

bd60 make on this overall deterrent strength are based on the 
best intelligence or the best decisions that you can make 
on the intelligence that is given to you at the present 
(:) time. 
Secretary Gates. That is correct. 
Senator Saltonstall. And that applies today and it 
apPlies to the future. 
Secretary Gates. As of this time, yes, sir. 
Senator Saltonstall. Wow we hear a lot about research 
and development of weapons. Dr. York stated in a conversa-
tion or in a hearing that there were several hundreds of 
research efforts going along from time to time at all times. 
(:) And the great responsibility was to select from those research 
efforts and cut them down and when you got them cut down, 
then to cut down some more so that the final development 
went into just 2 or 3 weapons. 
MayI ask you if your decisions to go forward we will 
say with certain efforts like this line, this Midas enter-
prise, the Polaris, the Minuteman and weapons of that charac-
ter, those are the results cut down from a great number of 
research efforts, am I not correct? 
Secretary Gates. Yes. Dr. York often says it is a 
cpestion of choosing between good ideas, and one of the 
best things that has happened in recent years has been the 
authority that came with his office under the reorganization

plan of 1958. We have now transferred to this office 
authority for research test and evaluation, a great portion 
of which funds used to be carried in our procurement 
accounts. 
So a great bulk of our effort is in the research cate-
gories which he is responsible for. And the Midas program 
thich you mentioned is one of those. 
Senator Saltonstall. In other words, this overall 
deterrent effort for the future is based on the judgments 
that comes from the various research and development efforts. 
Secretary Gates. That's right, sir, and also not only 
our in-house research capabilities, but advisory 
committees of great competence formed from national sources, 
both to advise us and the President has in addition his 
own scientific adviser and a scientific advisory committee, 
and these are all consulted in connection with these research 
systems. 
Senator Saltons tall. So that even if several millions 
or hundreds of millions of dollars havebeen spent, the slowing 
down for or the stopping of any single research effort is 
based on the decision that another research effort is 
valuable at the present time? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, in which we al/ play a role 
in the decision process, the scientist, the aoint Chiefs 
of Staff and the civilian management.

bd62 Senator Saltonstall. And that also is a concern as to 
(:) whether that weapon will be an offensive weapon or a defensive 
weapon. 
(:) Secretary Gates. Yes. 
Senator Saltonstall. And you are leaning more towards 
the offensive rather than a defensive weapon, is that 
correct, or both, or would you express an opinion on that? 
Secretary Gates. This is difficult to answer. I would 
say that we were leaning more toward the offensive weapon. 
This is a matter of opinion. 
Senator Saltonstall. Now I was very much encouraged, 
Mr. Secretary, by your decision that you made several months 
(:) ago to get right in with the Joint Chiefs of Staff whenever 
there was a difference of opinion expressed by them. How 
has that worked out? 
Secretary Gates. Pram my point of view it has worked 
out even better than I dreamed. We have been meeting on 
a weekly basis tryingto meet every Monday afternoon. We 
have met four or five times. We have made decisions which 
have treed up a back log of papers. It has been accepted 
with remarkable goodwill by the Chiefs and I think if 
you ask them they would testify it has been a very successful 
way of doing business. 
Senator Saltonstall. And that in your opinion makes 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff more effective and keeps the

(:) Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. I think it is a very fine 
way of working. I think they agree. 
Senator Saltonstall. You testified I think that 
section 612(b) in the budget: that is in the present 
budget and inthe budget that you have submitted to the Congress, 
gives you all the authority that you need to Put an airborne 
alert into the air at any one time, that you believe it is 
wise to do. 
Secretary Gates. That allows us to spend funds for that 
purpose in an unlimited manner. 
Senator Saltonstall. I think you have testified to 
this. I would just like to emphasize it. You are going for-
ward with the research and development of conventional weapons 
so-called as well as these so-called nuclear weapons? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir, that is correct. 
Senator Saltonstall. So that you are improving the 
conventional weapon with the development of nuclear power: 
with the development of science such as the M-14 rifle and 
the cannons and that sort of thing. 
Secretary Gates. That is right, Senator. 
Senator Saltonstall. And those are overall weapons 
that you are building up as your deterrent effort for 
1961, 2 and 3.

Senator Saltonstall. Now we have not heard any discus-
sion of mutual security and the NATO. You are going over to 
NATO very shortly. 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. 
Senator Saltonstall. Nhat in your opinion as Secretary 
of Defense is the value of NATO in the Mutual Security 
Program in our overall deterrent effort? 
Secretary Gates. Our whole security arrangements are 
based on collective security of the free world. We have 
treaties as the Senator well knows with some 40 nations. 
The most successful perhaps of all of our collective security 
relationships has been NATO, which has, Which can, I believe, 
claim considerable credit for not having a war in Europe 
in the years it has been in existence. 
The mutual security, the Mutual Military Assistance 
Program we consider absolutely vital to the preservation of 
these collective security arrangements, both from the point of 
view of building allied forces that supplement our own forces 
at a far less expensive and more effective way than if we 
tried to do this ourselves. 
Also for building the Internal Security and responsi-
(:) bility of these countries themselves. And we are saying 
with confidence and with support of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff that we would not want to see any funds subtracted 
from military security programs to add to the defense budget.

We think it is so important. 
Senator Saltonstall. I have time for just one more brief 
question. You have spoken about your decisions in the offing 
or in the making on more Polaris submarines as you watch them 
develop an3successfully. What about the Atlas? Is there 
any decision in the making or being made to speed up the Atlas 
program? 
Secretary Gates. In all of these things they axe 
under continuous review and there are under considerations 
possibilities of a variety of different combinations concerning 
the Atlas which in one case, for example, would add mare Atlas 
missiles to already authorized sites. This is under consider-
ation. 
Senator Saltonstall. Mr. chaizman I have the breakdown 
given by General Traub on that 382 million about whidh there 
has been so much discussion. 1 will be glad to show it 
to the counsel and if he approves he can put it in because the

Senator Symington. Yes I think there has been a mistake 
there. 
I have the testimony on page 451 of the House Appropria-
tions Committee. We can clear that up.

So I just wanted to tell you that my questioning, 
would like to get into that and find out why that decision 
was made, the way the world is today.

I thought inasmuch as we won't have time to pursue that 
in detail, that I would like to tell you that it is something 
that I think we ought to discuss at your convenience, and 
the convenience of the Chairman and the counsel of the 
Committee. 
Secretary Cates. I will be glad to. 
Senator symington. Now we have had considerable 
discussion this morning about this question of the gap. 
It is my understanding based on what I have heard this 
morning and before that you said the new intelligence analysis 
had narrowed the gap. 
It ts also my impression in listening to Director Dulles 
that the reverse was true. The testimony of Secretary 
Sharp on a national telecast implied that the gap had either 
been narrowed or eliminated. It is my impression from the 
testimony of Director Dulles that the reverse is true. 
At this point, Mr. Counsel, and members of the committee, 
I would ask unanimous consent that testimony from a 
telecast of Secretary Sharp be included at this point in 
the record, as long as I have referred to it. If there is

Senator Saltonstall. I have no objection, Mr. Chairman. 
When was that telecast held, please?

not be taken out of my time? 
Senator Saltonstall. If you identity it, it isn't 
necessary to read it.

(:) year in order to clarify this matter you don't announce 
publicly the ratios based on our best estimates of the number 
of ready to launch ICBMs the Soviets have as compared with 
the number we plan to have? 
Secretary Gates. I think that the ratios are misleading, 
Senator, and I don't know how to announce them in a way that 
wouldn't cause more confusion. 
Senator Symington. Secretary McElroy announced them last 
year. Are you implying that he misled the American people 
when he did so? 
Secretary Gates. No, sir. I am not familiar with where 
Mx. McElroy made this statemento nor am I familiar with 
how he arrived at the ratios. 
Senator Symington. But you referred to it in your 
statement that Senator Jackson put it? 
Secretary Gates. I didn't refer to it in this statement 
/ don't think. I referred to it as it had been stated. 
Senator Symington. Who stated it if he didn't? 
Secretary Gates. I don't know, sir, / just know that I 
read it repeatedly over a period of time. 
Senator Symington. To whom were you referring when 
you referred to the 3 to 1? 
Secretary Gates. I was referring to the common newspaper 
ama other publicity that has been given over quite a long period

I think. 
Senator Symington. Mr. Secretary, are you saying that 
Secretary McElroy did not say that? 
Secretary Gates. I dont know, Senator. 
Senator Symington. You don't know whether he did 
or not. 
Secretary Gates. No, I really do not. 
Senator Symington. Irgu have never taken the trouble to 
find out? 
Secretary Gates. To be completely frank with you, 
Senator, we have had a research group on this and we have not 
found out where he said it. 
Senator Symington. Have you ever asked him whether he 
said it or not? 
Secretary Gates. No, I have not. 
Senator Symington. Has anybody else in your office ever 
asked him whether he said it or not? 
Secretary Gates. I don?t know, sir. 
Senator Symington. Is it your impression that he did 
not say it? 
Secretary Gates. No. It is my personal impression 
that he must have said it. 
Senator Symington. Then if that is true and it was said 
last year, inasmuch as we are in the same confusion this

What is the overall expenditure ceiling in dollars for 
the Department of Defense for the Fiscal Year 1960 and for the 
Fiscal Year 1961? 
Secretary Gates. I can supply that accurately for 
the record. My impression is that the target for expenditures 
is $41,025,000,000 for 1960. 
Senator Symington. How much is that? 
Secretary Gates. This must be supplied accurately for 
the record, but my memory tells me that it is $41,025,000,000. 
Senator Symington. Thank you. Going back, you are not 
sure whether Secretary McElroy made that statement, is that 
correct, about the 3 to 1 ratio? 
Secretary Gates. I am not sure, no, sir. I told you it 
was my impression he had. 
Senator Symington. Let me read to you your testimony 
before the House Appropriations Committee, the subcommittee. 
Secretary Gates. I told you, Senator.

bd72 impression he had made it. 
(:) Senator Symington. Here is what you said: 
"Mr. McElroy made such a statement in his testimony 
(:) last year. He also made that testimony on a television 
program in December, but he was always very careful to say 
that this would be true only if they do what it is estimated 
they are capable of doing, and that 'is the very point 
that I was talking about earlier. Secretary McElroy 
was operating on the basis of capability figures that produced 
only theoretical capability basis something that was like 3 to 
1. This new intelligence estimate has narrowed the differ-
ences." 
Do you want to change that testimony? 
Secretary Gates. No, sir, because that was my impression 
and still is. I tried to find out a little more about it 
to verify it so I would be better informed on how it 
was arrived at, but I haven't been able to do this. 
Senator Symington. Thank you. 
You also have an expenditure ceiling for each service? 
And if so, what is it? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir, we do. 
Senator Symington. How much is it? 
Secretary Gates. We have expenditure targets would be 
a better word. For 1960 Senator, the Department of the 
Army, our estimate at this time, and these have to be inexact

because you are never sure until later in the year, 
$9,349,000,000, for the Department of the Navy $11,571,000,000, 
for the Department of the Air Force $18,823,000,0000 and for the 
Office of the Secretary of Defense $1,202,000,000. 
Senator Symington. That is enough. That gives us what 
we are after. 
Secretary Gates. I guess without military system which 
plays quite an important part of this, because it reflects 
one way or the other, this totals 49.45 for military func-
tions excluding military assistance. 
Senator Symington. If the Congress appropriates more 
money than is requested in the budget for specific purposes in 
which we are particularly deficient, will expenditure ceilings 
or other policies prevent the Department of Defense from 
spending that additional money? 
Secretary Gates. We always take very seriously the money 
that is appropriated by Congress. 
Senator Symington. I understand that. That is not my 
question. 
Secretary Gates. If the expenditure -- is your question 
related to 1960? 
Senator Symington. In 1955 the plan was to eliminate 
20,000 Marines who were volunteers at the same time we 
were drafting 10,000 men a month off the forms and out 
of the cities to go into uniform in peacetime who did not

677 
bd74 want to go. The Congress put up about 48 million dollars 
as I remember it to prevent those volunteers from being 
relieved of duty and discharged, because they wanted to stay 
in. 
They were trained men. Nevertheless the money was 
not used and they were discharged. Now I am asking if we 
put up more money this time, to the best of your knowledge 
as Secretary of Defense before this committee, do these 
expenditure ceilings prevent you from using that 
money? 
Secretary Gates. No, the expenditure ceilings would 
not prevent us from using it. we would have a decision of the 
President on things like force levels, which is the illustra-
tion you just gave. 
Senator Symington. Is there a particular number of dol-
lars over and above present expenditure plans which you 
would be able to spend if the Congress made the money avail-
able? 
secretary Gates. I am sure that either the Congress 
or ourselves would not hesitate to spend more money if 
national security required it over and above any plans. 
Senator Symington. My time is coming to a close. 
I will skip a lot of questions that I wanted to ask you 
which / will when you have another chance. 
I will ask one more. In your press conference of March 10, 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
bd75 you said that decisions were pending on the Polaris, 
the Atlas, the Bomarc B, the long-range cargo aircraft 
where there has been some most interesting testimony recently, 
and the Midas. 
You also said "The program is all right the way it is". 
Does that mean the decisions have already been made on 
these 5 items? 
Secretary Gates. No, sir. 
Senator Symington. Senator Smith? 
Senator Smith, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Secretary, you have stressed that numbers are mis-
leading. I like what you have said in your statement and 
wish it could be repeated over and over again, especially 
the first page of your statement. 
On page 40 however, you say "We have in combination 
enough to bring destruction to any one who attacks us." 
First, what do you mean "we"? 
Secretary Gates. We, the United States. 
Senator Smith. By whose interpretation? 
Secretary Gates. By the interpretation of those 
responsible for the defense program. 
Senator Smith. And would that be the Defense Department 
or the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Council 
and the President? 
Secretary Gates. Yes.

agreement. 
Secretary Gates. There might be differences. Yes, that 
would be by unanimous agreement. 
Senator Johnson. Will the Senator yield? Does that 
include General Tower, General Lemnitzer? 
Secretary Gates, General Lemnitzer I will qualify 
my answer, Senator Smith. 
There would be varying differences of opinion within 
the framework of how we do any given -- how we could pose any 
given budget. / would like to look at the statement. 
I think you are talking about a statement of policy decision 
here which is agreed to by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the 
Security Council and the President. 
Senator Smith. Would that be by unanimous agreement 
or would there be dissension in that group? 
Secretary Gates. Could / see the statement you are 
referring to? 
Senator Smith. Your statement on page 4, point 2: 
"We have in combination enough to bring destruction 
to anyone who attacks us." 
My question is this: I don't like the word "enough". 
I would like it better if you said "More than enough" and 
/ would like to ask you if you would not agree with me on 
that?

bd77 Secretary Gates. Yess,I would. 
Senator Smith. Then I asked about the "we". I wanted 
to be sure that that was the administration of the President. 
Secretary Gates. That is correct. 
Senator Smith. And next I was asking, and I think that 
was the question you had in mind* is it by unanimous 
agreement of the National Security Council, the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the 
other services, or is there dissension in that group and 
what percentage would that be? 
Secretary Gates. I don't think the question as phrased 
here has probably ever been posed for a vote. But I believe, 
I mean I am satisfied that the Joint Chiefs of Staff and 
the President would agree with the statement that we have 
in combination enough to bring destruction to any one who 
attacks us, and would agree to this unanimously. 
Senator Smith. Mx. Secretary, I would like to read para-
graph 2 on page 17 of the March 14, 1960 issue of Newsweek, 
and ask you to comment on the statement or what you would 
have to say about it. If you prefer to delay to executive 
session, I would leave that to you. It is under the heading,

to me that has indicated that they have this capability. 
Senator Smith. Would you want to check? 
Secretary Gates. So far as I understand it, the side 
winder is a most effective weapon for its purpose and is still 
being purchased and installed. 
Senator Smith. You would not be in a position to state 
whether that is an accurate statement or inaccurate or whether 
our military sources were making such statements. 
(:) Secretary Gates. We can check it, Senator Smith. / 
find it difficult to believe that it is an accurate statement 
if we are still procuring side winder missiles, and I am 
sure we are. Therefore, I wiRcheck and let you know. 
Senator Smith. You will check on the jamming. 
Secretary Gates. That is what you are asking. 
Senator Smith. That is what I am ading, yes, sir.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
682 
Senator Saltonstall, I believe you said that advisory groups 
contributed in some measure or other to decisions reached in 
the Department. It is my recollection that a man quite well 
informed as to the operations of the.Department told a 
Committee of the Congress not long ago that there were too many 
committees in the Pentagon and that the operations were bogged 
down as a consequence. 
Would you care to comment on that? 
Secretary Gates. Yes e sir. The response I made to Senator 
Saltonstal/ dealt with scientific advisory committees in 
connection with research where we have one top flight committee. 
We do have panels of committees perhaps on separate research 
problems. 
/ believe that Mx. Lovott was referring to a time 
probably prior to this where we have done a great deal in the 
last 2 years to eliminate committees in the Department of 
Defense. 
I am sure that there are probably still too many commit-
tees. But we have made progress. We have reviewed these 
committees and particularly the committees in the decision-
making process. And we have eliminated a considerable number 
of them. This was the result of the Hoover Commission and 
other types of studies that were made on the Department of 
Defense. 
Senator Bartlett. How many committees do you have now? 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6

683 
bd80 Secretary Gates. 1 could not answer that question. 
Senator Bartlett. Do youknow how many have been eliminated? 
Secretary Gates. There were some 200 I think eliminated 
under the clean-up committee program that was instigated 
about 2 years ago. 
Senator Bartlett Roughly what percentage of the total 
has been eliminated? 
Secretary Gates. I would say a very high percentage of 
official committees. How many ad hoc and other kinds of 
committees there are I really could not say. But I would say 
that the percentage of the official committees has been greatly 
reduced. 
Senator Bartlett. Do you know of any new committees that 
have been organized during this period? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, but only the ones that / have 
any association with have been on an ad hoc basis for a special 
study of some character or other. 
Senator Bartlett. I couple this with your response to 
Senator Symington, 
Secretary Gates. This was pertaining to research, 
Senator Symington's question. 
Senator Bartlett. I believe you told Senator Symington 
ilat a research group had been set to work if Mr. McElroy 
had actually said what Mr. McElroy had been said to have said. 
What I can't understand is why someone did not pick up the

bd81 phone and ask Mr. McElroy instead of putting a research 
group to work on this. 
Secretary Gates. I tried to find a little more information 
on this subject, than we had. We tried to examine in our office 
the statements Mr. McElroy made. That is all. 
Senator Bartlett. I still believe that Mr. McElroy 
might have been the best witness on that. 
You said as / recall, Mr. Secretary, in reference to 
missiles, that we have done very well in comparison with our 
historical experience with other types of weapons, and I 
dont quite understand exactly what you meant here. I wonder 
if you would explain. 
Secretary Gates. What I meant, Senator, was that it 
was not uncommon to spend as long as 10 years for the develop-
ment of a fighter aircraft system. In fact approximately 
10 years was more or less normal in the production of air-
craft I believe, although we have done better at times and 
longer at other times, from its inception until the time 
it joined thecombat forces as an operating system. / think 
we should take great pride incur scientific, industrial and 
technical capabilities that have brought these missiles 
systems along to the extent that they have been brought along 
during a short period, a relatively short period. 
Senator Bartlett. You would say then in general that 
we are doing better than we were, but would you say that we

bd82 are doing well enough? 
Secretary Gates. We never do well enough. We do the 
best we can to expedite all of these things. 
(2) Senator Bartlett. Why then, Mr. Secretary, in connec-
tion with what you have just said, is it, the 8-70 program is 
being stretched out? 
Secretary Gates. The 8-70 program, as Senatpr 
Symington already referred to, it is a very difficult decision. 
The 8-70 was envisioned to be a very expensive weapons system 
that would come into being some time in 1965 as an operational 
system. 
There were a good many people that reviewed it that felt 
it might come in at a later period in 1965, maybe as late as 
67 or something of that nature. At this time we will have 
In being, if we stay on schedule, the 4 missile systems, 
the Titan, Atlas, Minuteman and Polaris in being, in operation-
al quantities on station in considerable numbers. The 8-70 
therefore is a competing system to these missile systems in 
that sense, although it is wise always to have variety in 
your attack. / agree with this as a military 
principle. 
We felt we ought to take a year's look at the 2-70, build 
two prototype aircraft, and a year's look at the development 
of our missile programs, and see where we would be at the end 
of that time.

686 
bd83 This is a compromise decision. 
Senator Bartlett. Isn't it the case, Mr. Secretary, 
that when this prototype is completed, you will have the bones 
(:) with no flesh on it? 
Secretary Gates. That's right. This is not the develop-
ment of a prototype weapons system. 
Senator Bartlett. And that will of course occasion further 
delay. 
Secretary Gates. It will delay the 12 months we have 
delayed. Yes, it will. 
Senator Bartlett. Now, Mr. Secretary, on page 2 of your 
opening statement you said this: 
(2) ?For example, we are accelerating the second BMEWS 
station to bring it into operation four months ahead of schedule". 
Can you tell us where that station is located? 
Secretary Gates. It is in Alaska, Senator. 
Senator Case of South Dakota. That is the right answer. 
Senator Bartlett. I honestly did not know that. 
Secretary Gates. I was delaying to see whether this 
as classified information or not. 
Senator Bartlett. Yes. I thought it might be. But your 
answer astounds me a little bit because my information about 
that station, and it is not classified in Alaska, is that 
it is months behind schedule: that the entire winter was 
lost, that the principal buildings were to be under cover last

fall and that this was not accomplished and the whole winter 
virtually was lost. 
Secretary Gates. I have no personal knowledge of that, 
Senator/ I have seen a schedule from the time I have looked 
at the program of a certain date for this installation, and 
we have now found from experience with the first one that we 
can accelerate that date by some period of time, and this 
is what we are doing. 
Senator Bartlett, I was a little astounded, and I would 
be very grateful if you would inquire into this further and 
inform the committee. 
Now you regard these BMWS stations as being quite 
essential, I infer. 
Secretary Gates. They are a very important part of 
warning. 
Senator Bartlett. Why then, if you know, did it require 
two years or thereabouts, Mx. Secretary, to reach a decision 
on the site of the third BMWS station? 
Secretary Gates. I didn't know how long, I do not know 
how long it took. I was not in my present position, and 
have not looked at it. / didn't know it took that long. 
Senator Bartlett. You do know, however, that it took 
a long time to reach a decision as to where 
Secretary Gates. I know tilt this station is involved 
in arrangements with another country, which takes negotiations

have now been completed?

Senator Johnson. Mr. Secretary, I as Chairman have 
not asked any questions or made any statements, and I need 
to open the Senate at a quarter of 12:00. There have been 
two Democrats and two Republicans have asked questions. 
If it is agreeable with the Committee and Senator Wiley has 
no objection, I would like to take a very brief time now to 
make a statement and ask a few questions and then to be 
followed by Senator Wiley, because you will be here until

Is that agreeable with you, Senator Wiley?

bd86 opportunity of emphasizing what / believe you already know, 
and that is that these committees before whom you are appearing 
today recognize you as a very sincere, dedicated, devoted, 
patriotic public servant. 
We know your responsibilities are heavy and farflung, 
and so are ours in the Congress. Because of the unquestion-
ability of our nation's ability to defend itself against 
threat rests on not only our American heritage but the peace 
of the world is dependent upon it. 
It is in that spirit that I have tried to conduct these 
hearings. You are one of the conluding witnesses and / 
have a few questions that I want to submit that I think you 
can answer brief/ye and I would like to have them in the 
record. 
Firste are you contemplating adding hardware and opera-
tional facilities to the Polaris and ICBM programs over that 
osntained in the originally submitted fiscal year 61 budget? 
Secretary Gates. I am using the word "contemplating", 
Mr. Chairman. I am. we are reviewing other possibilities, 
and will continue to review them in the case of Polaris 
contingent on some further , tests. 
Senator Johnson. Then you do propose an increase in 
the Polaris strilecapability. 
Secretary Gates. I am not in a position to propose it. 
I have it under study and have it referred to the Joint Chiefs

(:) Senator Johnson. Was this under consideration when 
the FY 61 budget was submitted? 
(:) Secretary Gates. It would be incorrect to say that more 
Polarises were not under consideration. 
Senator Johnson. The answer is yes, then? 
Secretary Gates. I think, yes. 
Senator Johnson. Didn't you say at that time that the 
budget was adequate? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. 
Senator Johnson. And you did have some question out it 
then? 
Secretary Gates. No, sir. I felt that if we could proper-
ly gain more confidence in the systems that we would not 
hesitate to augment them. 
Senator Johnson. Then what you meant is adequate exclud-
ing increases to be decided on later? 
Secretary Gates. I meant that it was a properly balanced 
defense program, and I still believe it is, Senator Johnson. 
I believe, however, that when le gain more confidence in a 
system that is as good as the Polaris system appears to be, 
that we should not hesitate to augment it. 
Senator Johnson. And you do not think we will hesitate 
to augment it? 
Secretary Gates. I will not hesitate to recommend it.

Senator Johnson. Do you concur with Mr. Allen Dulles 
that the Communist threat is most serious? 
Secretary Gates. I most certainly do. 
Senator Johnson. Do you agree with me that America 
must maintain a position of unquestioned strength in order 
to meet that threat? 
Secretary Gates, Absolutely. 
Senator Johnson. Mr. Secretary, if Congress after detailed 
hearings and after expressing all points of view and after 
hearing witnesses that cover the entire lot express individual 
opinions, if we after careful and prudent consideration, 
fully aware of our constitutional responsibilities as a separate 
branch of the government: if we conclude that we should raise 
ad support the Armed Services: and in order to do that we 
must increase the appropriations made by the House or the 
request made by the Budget Director, if we should do that, would 
you use the funds? 
Secretary Gates. This is always a question for the 
President to decide, Mr. Chairman. I believe that we would 
certainly be in agreement in what programs should be increased. 
Senator Johnson. You think it is a most serious thing 
though if Congress, acting under its constitutional 
responsibilities and after hearing all the witnesses over 
numerous committees for many weeks finally concludes that in 
exercising its constitutional responsibMity and protecting the

security of this nation we should do something, do you think 
it is a pretty serious responsibility to have one man veto 
that? 
Don't you? 
Secretary Gates. I am not competent to testify on 
the legal relationships between the executive and the Congress, 
but I think it is a very serious business and I certainly 
recognize your responsibilities in this connection. 
Senator Johnson. Now if we come along and grant some 
departments request for we will say the Air Force asking 
for 17 Atlas squadrons rather than the 14 approved, and after 
we have heard the Central Intelligence and we have heard the 
Army, the Navy, the Air Force and all the experts we 
can get and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the ex-Joint 
Chiefs and so on and so forth, we conclude that it is 
necessary in exercising our responsibility to appropriate 
funds for X squadrons, you are called upon to make a 
recommendation to impound those funds, you realize that 
that is a nretty serious responsibility you are taking when 
you veto the action of both branches of the Congress. 
Secretary Gates. I certainly do, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator Johnson. Have you ever made such a recommenda-
tion? 
Secretary Gates. NO, / never have. 
Senator Johnson. You would stop, look and listen before

(:) Secretary Gates. Yes: sir. 
Senator Johnson. Thank you. I am very grateful to 
(:) you, Senator Wiley, for permitting me to go ahead. 
Senator Wiley is recognized. 
Senator Symington. Mr. Chairman, before the Senator 
starts could I ask do we automatically stop at 12 o'clock? 
Senator Johnson. I think that depends on the committee. 
We are not going to cite anyone. We are not goirg to issue 
any contempt citations and we are not going to report any 
bills. 
We are just meeting here for informational purposes. 
(:) I will be glad to ask the Senate to permit us if you want 
to, to continue during part of the afternoon that the Secre-
tary can be here. 
What time do you need to leave: Mx. Secretary, to keep 
your other engagements? I understood you had afternoon 
engagements. 
Secretary Gates. I would prefer to leave not later 
than 1:00 o'clock. 
Senator Johnson. I think you could go ahead and run 
(:) until 1:00 o'clock if the committee is disposed to do SID. If 
not/ I will ask permission and if that is granted, I will 
notify you. What is the pleasure of the committee? 
Senator Saltonstall. Mr. Chairman, I might just say this:

I understood that Mr. Gates had some very important 
engagements this afternoon in connection with Paris, and 
his original statement was half past 12:00. I am afraid he 
will lose all his lunch and everything else and perhaps 
not get the full benefit of Paris if we sit until 1:00. 
Secretary Gates. I was trying to be as helpful as X 
cane Senator Johnson. I would prefer to leave earlier. From 
my personal point of view I would prefer to leave any time after 
12:00 o'clock but I would want to be as cooperative as I can 
and I appreciate it. 
Senator Johnson. I don't want anyone to lose any lunch 
he hasn't had. I think then if there is no objection that 
we will attempt to find an area of agreement here between the 
two parties and say if the Secretary says he can stay until 
1:001 the Senator from Massachusetts thinks 12:30 is a 
proper time, I would suggest 12:45. Now is that? 
Secretary Gates. That is all right, Senator. 
Senator Johnson. Senator Symington, will you preside 
and we will run until 12:45. 
Senator Symington. Senator Wiley? 
Senator Wiley. Mr. Chairman, I first want to agree with 
the very fine words that were just extended to the Secretary 
by the Senator from Texas in relation to you, Mr. Secretary. 
I want to compliment you also on this statement which in my 
opinion if the public can get ahold of will calm a lot of fears

that have been engendered fT this talk of gaps. 
When you talk about a gap, as I understand it, if I have 
one pistol and you have 3: that is a gap of 2, isn't it? Is 
that what you mean by a gap? 
Secretary Gates. That is the way it is generally refer-
red to: yes, sir. 
Senator Wiley. But if I happen to also have a gun and 
awe other weapon, then the gap isn't as big as it was before, 
is that right? 
Secretary Gates. That is right, sir. 
Senator Wiley. Now tht is what you mean when you say 
that there is no reason why we need match the Communist bomber 
for bomber, missile for missile, division for division, or 
submarine for submarine, is tht right? 
Secretary Gates. That is right, sir. 
Senator Wiley. Now you mentioned in your statement 
the Communist military requirements are vastly different 
from ours. What are those requirements? Set them out briefly 
so we will understand. 
Secretary Gates. I would say that the requirement would 
be based I believe on the sincere conviction that they would 
know that we would not strike them first. I believe it would 
also be set up on the basis of their geography, which is quite 
different from ours, they being a large land mass. And I 
believe that their total military posture is greatly 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
696 
different .from ours with our collective security Arrangements 
and our deployed forces worldwide. Therefore, their require-
ments are different from the standpoint of geography and differ-
ent from the stamdpoint of the fact that they are still en-
gated in an objective of world domination. 
Senator Wiley. Now among other things you have 
said: and I want to hurry through this SD that we can get it 
synchronized, the strength, speaking about our strength: 
"The strength I believe we have now and our defense programs 
are designed to maintain the strength". 
By that you mean the adequate strength to meet the 
challenge if it comes. 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. 
Senator Wiley. Now you say: "Our total strength widely 
deployed within the United States and around the periphery 
of a single strategic target area is so great that any surprise 
attack upon us would result in unacceptable destruction 
to the attacker." 
Secretary Gates. That is right, sir. 
Senator Wiley. The thing particularly that I am 
interested in is that we have been talking about the gap in 
ICBMs. But you also say, which I think is very, very 
significant, and Senator Smith quoted part of the sentence: 
"We have nuclear weapons that exceed those of the USSR by 
several times in their total destructive power."

Secretary Gates. That's right, sir. 
Senator Wiley. That is correct: isn't it? 
Secretary Gates. That is the basis of our estimates, 
that is correct. 
Senator Wiley. And we have long range means of delivery 
that exceed theirs by several times in the total carrying 
capacity. 
Secretary Gates. That is correct. 
Senator Wiley. Now we have been talking about deterrence. 
The terrible destructiveness that would follow from a war under 
conditions as they are now: do you think that is a deterrent? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, six. 
Senator Wiley. In other words, there are 200 million 
Russian people that don't want war and there is 175 million 
of us that don't want war, is that right? 
Secretary Gates. I would hope the Russian people did 
not want war any more than the American people. 
Senator Wiley. I am talking about now some of these 
deterrents: because I think it is very important that we 
understand what we mean. You already mentioned the fact of 
NATO. That is a military deterrents and it is agreed 
now according to the General in charge that they are going 
to create a unified missile defense of some kind. Do youknow 
something about that? 
Secretary Gates. I have not seen the proposal that has been

1bd95 referred to, but we have a unified defense in a sense in 
(:) the whole NATO alliance. 
Senator Wiley. Now there are a lot of captive nations 
right around Russia. Take for instance Poland. Do you think 
that if Khrushchev should think about letting the balloon 
go up he would probably have to give consideration to the 
Baltic nations, to Poland, to East Germany, Czechoslovakia: 
Bulgaria and Roumania? 
Do you think those captive nations -- do they create 
a deterrent in your mind? 
Secretary Gates. On the same general analysis that 
people do not want to be destroyed and their will and 
determination to prevent war and to be strong and in our case 
our will and determination to remain stmng is a deterrent. 
Senator Wiley. If you were sitting in Khrushchev's shoes, 
and he is a practical fellow, he would have to count the 
costs, and that is part of the cost, what the slave nations 
wuuld be doing in case he let the balloon go up, is that 
right? 
Secretary Gates. He would certainly evaluate it. 
Senator Wiley. Recently we have been hearing a lot about 
the attitude of Mao Tse-tung and the Chinese. Khrushchev 
went down and visited in India, and we understand that condi-
tions are doing so well between the Chinese and Khrushchev. 
But be that as it may, there are 650 million Chinese and there

(:) to go except North? 
Secretary Gates. No, sir. I think that that would be 
(:) the logical direction that they mould move. 
Senator Wiley. That is the logical direction: yes. 
In other words, with the increased population pressure: 
the pressure would be such --I am talking about deterrence 
now. That is the thing I am getting at, because in my humble 
opinion it is a very important matter when we consider this 
question of how much we are going overboard with probably 
the result of carrying out the very thing that Lenin said, 
that he would cause us to bust our own economy. 
(:) We have got to give consideration to that. 
Senator Jackson. Would the Senator yield at that 
point? 
Senator Wiley. Just a minute. I have got a meeting. 
Senator Jackson. Would you supply for the record the 
statement by Lenin? That came up in our hearing when Mx. 
Lovett was present and you will find that the Library of 
Congress will tell you that he never made that staterent. 
Senator Martin. Does the gentlemen know what he said? 
Keynes reported that he: Stalin, said the surest way to do 
away with free nations is to debaucher their currency.

Senator Symington. Senator Wiley, will you proceed.

in this matter and I am trying to be judicious. I am not an 
Army man, a Navy man or a flyer. I am still thinking in terms 
of the United States of America. 
Senator Symington. You are a very fine man, Senator. 
Will you proceed? 
Senator Wiley. What is that? 
Senator Symington. Will you proceed, sir? 
Senator Wiley. Are you butting in now too? 
What I am getting at, sir, can you think of any other 
deterrence? 
Secretary Gates. I think we must have a strong military 
deterrent to prevent the outbreak of war. I think we must 
have the will and determination to maintain this deterrent, 
sad the will to use it if necessary in terms of interferences 
of small nations, of probingins of our will ad determination 
worldwide, in terms of things other than military as well as 
things that are military. I feel that if you want to talk 
in the broad sense, I believe Senator, you are talking our 
spirit and our general intellectual and spiritual approach 
to life is involved in a deterrent. 
Senator Tilley. I read from the conclusion of your 
statement: We will not hesitate to take emergency measures.

Senator Magnuson. Mr. Secretary, I donvt want to resolve 
some of these controversies here regarding gaps, what we 
should do or what we are not doing and what we are doing 
at present, but I think that when the American people look 
at this thing, they will want to look for some place of 
responsibility as to what decisions are made. ?Let me ask 
you this question. There are 2 or 3 members of us here on the 
Appropriations Committee, because this gets down to money 
when you break it all down. Has Congress ever denied the 
Defense Department in appropriations any major program that they 
have come to Congress and suggested that we do in the security 
of our country? 
Secretary Gates. / think in the context of your question, 
Senator, my answer would be as far as I know they have not. 
/ know of times when they have not granted all the money that 
has been requested, but you used the words "major program".

Senator Magnuson. Well, there have been some slight 
disagreements: but what I am saying is

Secretary Gates. So far as I know the Congress 
has always been mindful of 
Senator Magnuson Would you agree with me that the Ameri-
can people should know? 
Secretary Gates. Absolutely. 
Senator Magnuson. That the Defense Department and 
those that are responsible when they made up their minds and 
come to Congress, eongress has always given them the money. 
Is that a correct statement? 
Secretary Gates. I want to be as truthful as I absolutely 
can. 
Yes: I think it is a correct statement. I think that 
there have been occasions where there have been differences of 
opinion and Congress has not always given all the money for 
a specific program, but in terms of total defense I don't 
know any occasion myself where Congress has not granted 
the money. 
Senator Magnuson . Do you know of any occasion when the 
total amount asked by the Administration for the security of 
this country, the overall total, leaving out maybe some 
differences of opinion about certain phases of the program, 
has ever been deniedthe Administratioh?

defense budget, yes. 
Senator Magnuson. Would you say that the cut in any 
way affected the major security, effort? 
Secretary Gates. It was not done during my time, sir. 
Senator Magnuson. If I showed you the figures that 
Congress has never varied in granting the request of the 
Defense Department in any case within 2% one way or another, 
would you agree with me on that? 
Secretary Gates. I would assume, Senator, that you 
had studied the figured and would give me the right answer. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, may I 
interrupt for clarification? 
Senator Magnuson. Let me finish and then I will yield 
to the Senator. 
Senator case of New Jersey. I just wanted to clarify 
what you meant by a question you asked, Senator. I assume 
you are excluding USIA from the Defense Department. 
Senator Magnuson. I am talking about the Department of 
Defense. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. I just wanted that clarified. 
Senator Magnuson. YSIA and parts of Mutual Selurity 
and even there. 
Now let me ask another question. That being the case, 
and It is the case, there has beensome discussion here as

to making choices between relative programs. 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. 
Senator Magnuson. Senator Symington suggested that 
there should te more on the air and not less on the Polaris but 
he suggested that one should not be neglected for the other, 
isn't that correct? 
Senator Symington. That is correct. 
Senator Magnuson. Now if that is the case and Congress 
has had that attitude toward the Defense Department at all 
times, why can't you have both instead of all this discus-
sion whether se whould do this or do that when you make a 
decision that they are important. 
Why can't you have both? Why can't you come to Congress 
and say We need the Polaris and we need the air thing too"? 
Secretary Gates. We have to review. We have to stop 
smnewhere. I mean we review total programs and we review 
total balance, total balance that we have for specific 
purposes and we come up with as good priorities as we know 
how to do and as good judgments as we know how to do and present 
it. 
Senator Magnuson. I understand that, but my next 
question then is, isn't a great deal of the meat of the 
problem we are discussing here a problem of budget 
ceilings on this whole situation? 
Secretary Gates. Senator, money affects everything that we

Senator Magnuson. I asked you isn't that the real problem, 
budget ceilings? 
Secretary Gates. It is not the real problem in connection 
with the 18-70. 
Senator Magnuson. The budget gives you a ceiling do they 
not, befure you start out? 
Secretary Gates. No, sir. 
Senator Magnuson. They don't? 
Secretary Gates. No, sir. 
Senator Magnuson. You make your decision. Then the 
budget gives you a ceiling? 
Secretary Gates. No, sir. The Secretary of Defense 
gives guidelines to the services and they come up with their 
programs to him. 
Senator Magnuson. Would you say that there has not been 
circulated in the Defense Department on many occasions to the 
various departments that you can spend so much and no more? 
Secretary Gates. I would say that once we establish 
a financial plan within the Department of Defense, we circu-
late to the Services where they stand in relation to that 
plan, yes. 
Senator Magnuson. The point I am making here isthat a 
lot of this gets down to that sole question, why we should not 
have, if Polaris is good and SAC is good and the things

Secretary Gates. If we took, Senator, all of everybody's 
good ideas and tried to finance them, we would mare than 
double the defense budget. 
Senator Magnuson. Maybe the situation might call 
for that. 
Secretary Gates. This is a question of choosing 
between good ideas. 
(2) Senator Magnuson. I don't think you wanted the statement 
to stand when you said we never make well enough. 
Secretary Gates. I have no objection to saying we are never 
perfect. 
Senator Magnuson. Well enough is not perfect. 
Secretary Gates. We always can improve. 
Senator Magnuson. It is a little bit beyond having 
enough. Donut you think that is a desirable philosophy? 
Secretary Gates. Senator smith is the one that raised 
this question and I agreed with her. 
Senator Magnuson. Now I just have one more question. 
I think the American public should know this because it is 
important and it surely would not be classified.

Is that not correct? 
Secretary Gates. X would assume so. The disarmament 
meetings have already, commenced in Geneva. 
Senator. Magnuson. Now if we are negotiating or discussing 
the question of disarmament, what Wealpone system would you 
suggest would have priority in disarmament? You are going 
to be called upon for that advice like we call upon you? 
Secretary Gates. No, six. The disarmament conversations 
will all be conducted on the basis of certain agreed on phased 
proposals that have been presented by our negotiator, Mr. 
Eton, at Geneva, and they will all be based on the hypothesis 
that there is agreed upon and valid control systems that will 
monitor the results. 
Senator Magnuson. I understand that. 
Secretary Gates. / am not going to be asked about any 
weapons system in connection with disarmament. 
Senator Magnuson. If you are going to disarm you are 
going to have to cut out something, isn't that correct? 
Secretary Gates. Conversations hopeful in the world 
that will develop will come to the Senate in terms of a 
treaty.

to disarm You have got to throw down certain weapons and 
(2) would wonder what priority of weapons or of our defense 
you would suggest would come within the negotiations or 
the phasing of disarmament? 
Secretary Gates. I would not know until the time for 
the disarmament. 
Senator Magnuson. You would not know. 
Secretary Gates. I would not have any idea until 
I knew what we were talking about. 
Senator Magnuson. Supposing I should ask you right now 
which one would you give priority to?

know what the terms were. 
Senator Magnuson. Supposing the terms were predicated 
upon inspection, full inspection as I understand it the West 
is going to propose. Supposing that was agreed to? What broad 
section or segment of our defense would be the disarmament 
part of it? 
I think the American maple want to know what we are going 
to disarm. 
Secretary Gates. We are not going to disarm anything 
until we have an approved treaty. 
Senator Magnuson. I understand that. 
Secretary Gates, I think it would be terribly misleading

tion. 
Senator Magnuson. You wouldn't know. That is an answer 
to the question. 
Now / want to ask You just one question that is somewhat 
unrelated, but because the Secretary. is.here and he is going 
to urope, a very important meeting as you know in the Defense 
Department is taking place now in Geneva. 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. 
Senator Magnuson. Has the Defense Department taken any 
official stand on the territorial limits on the law of the sea 
that you know of? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. 
Senator Magnuson. What is that stand? 
Secretary Gates. I am only hesitating to know whether 
this is part of negotiating procedures that / might not be 
permitted to disclose, Senator. I believe it is and I believe 
I would like to tell you in private what that stand is if 
that is satisfactory. 
Senator Magnuson. All right. I would like the Secretary 
when he has time on another matter that might seem unrelated 
here but it won't be unrelated if something happens. The 
Defense Department has said many, many times that they consider 
the Merchant Marine literally the fourth arm of our defense, 
our security, is that correct?

Secretary Gates. / have heard a lot of things suggested 
as fourth arms, Senator. I never heard that expression to 
tell you the truth. 
But / don't dispute it. 
Senator Magnuson. Would the Defense Department, the 
head of logistics having said so, send to the Committee, 
because I think when we discuss security this is just as 
important if something happens with missiles, airplanes or what-
ever we may have, hardware or anything else, a simple answer as 
to whether or not you think the American Merchant Marine is 
adequate enough to fit into this broad concept of defense 
that you say is adequate in your statement. Could you do that 
at a later time? 
Secretary Gates. I would like to take a look at it, be-
cause I really don't feel that we have taken a recent enough 
look for me to practically answer the question. 
Senator Magnuson. I would appreciate that, and several 
Senators would. 
Senator Saltonstall. Would the Senator yield? 
Senator Magnuson. Yes, 
Senator Saltonstall. I think it might be helpful to 
the Secretary if you referred him to the speech President 
Eisenhower made in Los Angeles in 1952 on that subject. 
I think the Senator correctly quoted him.

Senator Symington. We Wm been cut a little by the other 
side on this time angle. Senator. Martin., 
Senator Martin. ,Mr. Secretary, we have had consl.derable 
discussion in these hearings about the views of several 
Generals regarding the amount of funds needed for certain 
equipment and weapons. 
I want them to come and tell us what they think they need. 
But is it not expected that a Chief of Staff of any service 
or the Chief of any special branch of the service will portray 
the indispensability of that branch and argue for its 
expansion? 
Secretary Gates. It has been historically true that the 
requirements of the services as they see them have been greater 
than have been finally approved. 
Senator Martin. That is their job to bring us the picture 
as they see it in their special branch of the service. 
Secretary Gates. Yes. 
Senator Martin. That does not mean that they are at 
loggerheads with you on your overall judgment. They are argu-
ing for their particular branch of the service. I think they 
would be a very odd Chief of Staff or Chief of Branch if 
they ceased to portray the best qualities and best needs of 
their particular branch. 
Secretary Gates. They are all highly responsible, reliable

always tell the Congress precisely what they believe. 
Senator Martin. I went through this very realistically

in 1941 to 045 with the substitution of the armored force 
for the horse cavalry. We had an awfully hard time getting 
horse cavalry men out of the picture. They even wore their 
spurs quite a while after their horses went off the playgrounds. 
Secretary Gates. I was in the Horse Cavalry for 
nine years myself once. 
Senator Martin. And I admired them for their spunk 
but I don0 t want to take their judgment as final for 
what I should do in surrendering in their particular arm 
400 of the service. That is the position I see you are in. 
You have to pass on overall judgment. Is not the present 
organization of the Department of Defense functioning satis-
factorily notwithstanding divergent views of responsible 
leaders within the department? 
Secretary Gates. Yes. I think that over the months ahead 
we can probably improve administratively some of the proced-
ures within the organization. But I think my personal opinion 
is the organization which has been changed twice in recent 
years should 1x left to shake downs and / believe its frame-
work is corrects and I believe it will shake down and operate 
effectively. 
Senator Martin. It strikes me that there is no particular

bdll difficulty in the Armed. Services .with the recognition of 
the President as, Commander in Chia f pf the Armed Services 
in the administration of the total matter of our Armed 
Services. 
They must recognize him as the Commander in Chief. 
Secretary. Gates. Certainly. 
Senator Martin. And we do not tolerate the crossing over 
into other branches of the service or government to supplant 
the President in that role. I remember the struggle we 
had in creating the Court of Military Appeals. Some people 
wanted to put that under the Supreme Court. But that would 
cut into the functioning of the President as Commander in 
Chief of the Armed Forces. We had to bear that in mind in our 
committee back there in 1964. Yes, I think we need here in 
Congress to play the role of Congress in doing all we can to 
create and maintain Armed Forces, but not to supplant our 
opinion for the opinion of those responsible for carrying 
out the Armed Forces program in the field. 
Notwithstanding that, is it not true that even 
though the President as Commander in Chief of the Armed 
Forces has the power to impound funds appropriated by 
Congress, President Eisenhower will not exercise that power 
arbitrarily? 
Secretary Gates. I am sure of that. 
Senator Martin. I am as certain of it as I can be, and

bd12 I wouldn't stand aghast if he should overrule my decision 
as a member of the Senate in what we should spend if he wants 
to impound those funds. 
400 I know they have been impounded in the past. I went 
through very much the reorganization of the Air Force in 
1946. I know we had 90 air groups then and the Defense 
Department came over and asked for authorization of 70 air 
groups and we gave it to them because they asked for it, and 
that was actually built up to 48 air groups by following that 
action by Congress. 
That has been an experience we have had many times. 
I never thought at that time we should overrule them. We 
should air it out, now, knowing we have different opinions. 
That is a part of the function of Congress. But I still hope 
that no one in this Congress will attempt to take over the 
power of overruling the President in his function as 
Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. 
Now getting back to this quote that I jumped in with a 
moment ago, I happen to be a student of Russia over the past 
40 years or so, and I have looked far and long for the quote 
of Stalin. 
Senator Jackson. No, no,Lenin. 
Senator Martin. Lenin, I should say, and I had to look 
4:) up Staling but Lenin was the one that you had reference to?

Senator Martin. / thought you made some reference to 
the Library of, Congress. 
Senator Jackson. Let me just state it very simply. 
Senator Wiley referred to Lenin having said in substance 
that their objective would be to bankrupt us. This question 
again popped up in our heaxings I believe when Ms. Lovett 
or Mr. Sprague or maybe it was Mr. Watson was present. 
Senator Robertson pointed out then at the time of the hearings 
that he had had that question researched by the Library 
and the answer was that he had not said it. We again had the 
statement brought up to date as of 2 or 3 weeks ago, and the 
statement by the Library and by Soviet and Russian scholars 
is to the effect that they have not been able to find where 
Lenin ever made such a statement or a comparable one. 
Senator Martin. Yes. The Library also wrote me on 
the subject several years ago, and at that time they made 
the statement that the nearest approach to it they could get 
was from a statement made by Lord Keynes of Britain 
who is reported to have said that Lenin said the surest 
way to wreck free nations was through debaucher of their 
currency, and I agree with you that he never said anything 
stronger than that so far as I can find out. 
Senator Jackson. You are quoting Keynes now, the 
great monetary expert, which is more than hearsay. 
Senator Martin. He is the author of the Canadian theory

I just wanted to agree with you, senator. 
Senator Jackson. All I know is what we were advised 
on that. 
Senator Martin. Of course debaucher of the currency, 
if he said that is one way, of destruction and we are trying 
to hold this budget within workable bounds. 
Senator Jackson. Would you yield at this point? 
Senator Martin. That is on my time. 
Senator Symington. Senator Martin, this comes out of your 
time.

mind my staying in a field that I spend more time on than any 
other. 
Therefore page 40 item 2, "We have nuclear weapons that 
exceed the USSR by several times in total destructive power". 
Do you refer to the individual bank of the individual weapon, 
or do you refer to the total stockpile? 
Secretary Gates. Total. 
(:) Senator Anderson. Did you have a chance to examine Russian 
stockpile figures to satisfy yourself on that point?

? 
(:) we have on the subject. 
Senator Anderson. Then in the third line you say "We have 
in combination enough to bring destruction to any one who 
attacks us." 
If you rely on those estimates in the first statement 
would you then say the Russians have enough to do the same 
thing? 
Is their stockpile sufficient? 
Secretary Gates. I am going on the principle in my 
second statement that we are attacked first and we have enough 
to destroy him after this attack, which is the validity of 
our deterrent posture. 
Senator Anderson. I am only trying to find out if you 
think they have a substantial stockpile also. 
Secretary Gates. I think they have, yes, I think they 
have. 
Senator Anderson. You say near the bottom of that page 
that "The USSR is not engaged in .a crash program for ICBM 
development." 
,------
Does that come from the national estimates of some kind? 
- 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. 
Senator Anderson. That is interesting because if you saw 
scientists who showed up at Geneva in 1955 at the conference 
who were at that time experts in thermonuclear power and 
biology and medicine and all of them have been quoted in the

missile field, that might indicate to you that Russia 
does have some interest in missiles. 
Did the Russians recently test out a missile that went 
some 7760 miles plus with a CEP of less than 2 miles? 
Secretary Gates. I only know there what they said 
about this CEP, but they went the distance. 
Senator Anderson. When they put their -- just what is 
classified and what isn't -- when they put their devices for 
measuring how accurately it fell it fell right where they 
thought it was going to fall, didn't it? 
Secretary Gates. I can't testify to that personally, 
Senator Anderson, but it was a good shot. / don't mean to 
minimize it. 
Senator Anderson. That is all I wanted you to say, 
that it was a good shot and I think it was a very good shot. 
Now if it was a very good shot, would that indicate that they 
night have improved something on their old missiles that 
traveled less than 62000 miles? 
Secretary Gates. It would mean that they carried a 
different weight warhead re they made some changes in the 
missile. Yes, it would mean it was an extended range missile 
compared to the others I presume, although they 
might have fired the others at closer range before they tried 
the longer range. I don't know.

lh should be said in that connection that this is longer 
than it need fly for the mission that it is assigned. 
Senator Anderson. They did not think so. / dont say 
that they were wrong but they thought it was worthwhile 
to goa long distance and so forth. You say also on page 
5, and I hope not to take too much time, that At the 
present the Department of Defense has no specific military 
requirements for so-called super-boosters." 
Secretary Gates. That is correct, six. 
Senator Anderson. Do you feel it would be an advantage 
in the Department taking a more aggressive position on the 
development of nuclear propulsion or various types of missiles. 
Secretary Gates. Senator, I have participated with 
you and your committee on that subject as of about a year 
ago, and I have not looked at it since. The status of the 
program to whidh you refer I guess is the nuclear powered 
aircraft, is that correct? 
Senator Anderson. No, flat nearly as much as project 
Rover.

Senator Anderson. I have greater.. hope with Project 
Rover and we have had. a little bit of a, delay, I don't 
say too deliberate a delay,, and some budget troubles that 
stem not pnly, from the Space Agency but from the Air Force 
on the. delay part of it. 
There are many people who believe that if we hope 
to attain ability to put large objects in space we have to 
search for it in the specific impulse that we can get from 
nculear fuels instead of the specific impulse from 
even the most exotic chemical fuel that has not yet been 
developed. 
Therefore, I hope that when you say you have no program 
fox supetboosters, that youmight think at /east of the 
nuclear propulsion devices as superboosters that are possible 
to use. 
Secretary Cates. I know the Senator is a great student 
and expert on this subject. What meant when I made my state-
ment was that our present military satellite requirements can 
be met. by the propulsion systems that we have or will have rela-
ted to our intercontinental ballistic missile program. 
And at the moment there is no specific military vehicle or 
satellite that is a. requirement of the Department of Defense 
that would require a large booster of the supetbooster type. 
However, this does not mean that the Department of 
Defense should not maintain a very serious interest in the

4:1) 
that a military requirement of the future will develop 
in space. 
411, 
Senator Anderson. Project Orion has been mentioned. 
I don't know whether the nature of it is classified. We 
dbn't need to get into that, but the project Orion is of 
some interest in this field because at one of the laboratories, 
one of the men whose name is on the patent for the hydrogen 
bomb had an idea, and he tried to get some money 
through the Atomic Energy Commission to develop it. They 
did a little miscellaneous work but could not get the money. 
Yet the man who was his assistant was picked up by one of the 
4:, companies, came in and sold the Defense Department a 
$40 million contract without any trouble. We wish that we 
could get the Department of Defense, I do at least somewhat 
more interested in some of these very promising things where 
their costs would be extremely low. The Rover budget was 
cut only a very few millions of dollars while Orion I read 
a news item in I think Nucleonics-recently which 
said it now had no fixed place of abode. The Space Agency 
had dropped it. Somebody else had dropped it. It was now

bd20 Senater Anderson. Yesa but it has had a little route here, 
there and back and forth. Nebody seems to want to work on it 
ad yet you have got a very large budget for it and yet the 
budget to the Atomic Energy Commission was completely denied. 
That is not your responsibility I recognize. 
Secretary Gates. It may have been. I am not certain of 
this, but it may have been one of these projects that was with 
the Advanced Research Projects Agency that we have been 
transferring out with the changed organization.ofthat agency, 
and assigning to the services as it seemed appropriate to do so. 
If that is so, why then the assignment of the Air Force 
will make good sense. 
Senator Anderson. Now just to come back to that first 
sentence again "We have nuclear weapons that exceed those of 
the USSR by several times in total destructive power", 
isn't this one. of the things that gets us into these rows 
again, because we can't go back and use classified information 
to discuss your statement? 
Secretary Gates. I would certainly not want to get into 
a row and I certainly donut want to be confusing. I believe 
that this is a correct statement that between us we would 
agree to. 
Senator Anderson. I believe we would but if we had the 
full figures it might show rather surprising Russian 
strength. General Walsh was asked some question about the

bd21 ability to build up their missile production, and the language 
CI) 
is all full of the word "delete, deletes delete", and 
"deleted". 
4:1) The question was "In other words, they could even 
Ideleted' your estimates if they went to full capability is 
that right?" 
General Walsh says "Without question." 
I understand from the previous questioning that it 
must mean that they could produce more missiles than ihey are 
now doing if they wanted to. And yet the statement is left 
that the USSR is not engaged in any crash program_for ICBM 
development. 
I only hope the fact that they have pulled top scientists 
away from their pet projects and put them or missiles 
that they have started developing a very long range missile 
might be persuading that they are doing some work in that 
field. 
Secretary Gates. The crash program refers of course 
to production, and there might be people working on research 
in missiles.

accede to at my request, the matter of testimony, the 
statement of the Secretary and the figures in the intelligence 
estimates, I would like to ask just a couple of clarifying 
questions on other matters. 
Counsel early in his questioning referred to a statement 
by General Schriever that if we had made different decisions 
two years ago, we could have more ICBMs now. You stated in that 
connection that you were reviewing the program on ICBMs at the 
present time. 
Does this review or consideration involve the possibility 
of doing now what General Schriever said we could have done 
then, or are your considerations dealing with different 
systems than those as to which different decisions two years 
ago could not have been acclerated? 
Secretary Cates. Senator, if I understand what you mean, 
and I am trying to understand what General Schriever meant, 
you mean that General Schriever said that if we had started 
two years ago, we would have had the lead time behind us 
and we would have had in construction, lead time1 being quite 
long in case of hardened missile sites, we would have had 
opportunity to put into being additional intercontinental 
ballistic missiles. 
This is true, but we made a decision to go more 
rapidly toward the second generation missiles which we 
believed were better, namely the Minuteman and Polaris

b423 as opposed to going completely in the others. 
Now the variety of alternatives that I now have under 
review, which is part of the normal process of review, 
400 deals with putting in additional missiles and reviewing 
the times and costs pertaining to what these missiles 
would do, at what time period and for how much and how effec-
tive they would be in relation to all of the other programs. 
So they deal with the same missiles. They deal in some cases 
with an augmentation of those missiles that General 
Schriever was referring to. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. 
The other question that I thought might be clarified I think 
has at least in part been clarified by subsequent questions. 
Senator Symington made a statement in which I understood him to 
say in effect that we now had decided to cancel out all 
development of the B-70. 
This is not my understanding as to the present decision. 
Secretary Gates. No. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. Or the present activity, and 
I wonder to the extent you think it is desirable if you might 
just review what we are doing about the B-70 program very 
0 briefly in your own way? 
Secretary Gates. I think Senator Symington said that we 
0 were not going to develop a weapons system in the prototypes 
that we were producing, and he is correct. What we are

going to do is.develop R pretotype aircraft that will be 
flyable hopefully at the speed of 3 times the speed of 
sound, and we will learn more about the program. We have 
is it 75 million dollars I believe in the budget for 
this year for this purpose toward the initial cost of these 
two prototypes? 
The Senator is correct. Senator Symington is correct in 
saying that this is not a development of weapons system com-
ponents. 
Senator Symington. W11. the Senator yield? 
Senator Case of New Jersey. That is exactly my under-
standing. Yes. 
Senator Symington. Just so long as my name has come 
into it: what I say is the reason you are postponing the delay 
of the 3-70 is a fiscal reason, and that the reason is, 
the mason it is a fiscal reason is because, it can be proved 
to my satisfaction that you are building it and you are saying 
the mason that you are building only half of that is because 
you are not sure of it. 
If you were sure of it, you would go ahead and build it, 
if you did not think it was necessary, you would not build it. 
What you will have may go a great deal faster according to 
the testimony of General White than the MACH 3 that you talk 
about. All I say is again we are in effect abandoning the 
research and development of any true supersonic aircraft for

the future in the Air Force: in the Navy and commercially. 
I thank the Senator. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. I am very happy to yield to 
the Acting Chairman. I am still a little bit concerned 
that his very last statement is not quite an accurate summary 
of what is going on. / don't think we are dbandoning this 
development as I understand it, but rather we are taking it at 
a somewhat slower pace pending a decision which is under review 
now as to whether it should te gone on in fullscale as a weapons 
system. 
Secretary Gates. That is right. I would like to say that 
it is not a fiscal reason, the B-70. Everything of course 
has money assigned to it, but the decision on the 8-70 was 
pot a fiscal decision. It was made because we are taking a 
whole new step in the state of the art involving certain com-
ponents and metals I believe that are non-existent that have to 
be developed. We are also running, as I previously testified: 
into competitipn with other systems for the mission, and 
there are other doubts on paper pertaining to this system 
that have to be thought through. 
These were the doubts that really led to this decision 
which was terribly carefully reviewed by the President and 
by the Advisory people of the Government throughout all fields 
of responsibility, military: scientific and judgment person 
who could contribute to this decision. Now any compromise is

(:) or to proceed with it..put,we thought we would learn. .from these 
two prototypes. We would also have more time to review our 
(.1) other programs in relation to the system. 
Senator Case of New Jersey. I thank the Secretary and 
I reserve for the executive hearing the matter discussed 
earlier. 
Senator Symington. Senainr Jackson? 
Senator Jackson. Mr. Secretary, just a couple of 
questions. 
I think you made a fine statement and I agree with a lot 
of the statements. For instance you said on page 1 "The 
Communist military requirements are vastly different". 
You also stated on page 4 "We have nuclear weapons that exceed 
those of the USSR by several times in total destructive 
II 
power. 
Now is&t it a fact that inasmuch as we are dealing with 
am enemy that will have the advantage of the first strike 
capability: that this places a greater burden on us to have 
a survivable retaliatory systems or as you have used it and 
I have used it for several years, the invulnerable deterrent 
(in capability. 
Secretary Gates. Yes, this is true. 
(:) Senator Jackson. So that I mean the statement 
Secretary Gates. Does put a serious responsibility. 
111111.1.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
730 
Senator Jackson. When you say we don't want to match just 
missile for missile, it is a matter of having a missile that is 
survivable. 
Secretary Gates. That is correct. 
Senator Jackson. When you talk about SAC's striking 
power being awesome, I agree, standing by itself, but it is 
less awesome if you give the enemy the capability that 
we must in our planning, the fact that they will strike first. 
Is this not true? 
Secretary Gates. Yes. We have to appraise the effect of 
permitting him the first strike against the United States. 
Senator Jackson. And I agree with you as I said a moment 
ago that we have more weapons, nuclear and thermonuclear, than 
the Soviets in total destructive power and in numbers. But 
thermonuclear capability and nuclear capability are insepara-
ble from deliverability, are they not? 
Secretary Gates. As a deterrent, certainly. 
Senator Jackson. I mean to draw 
Secretary Gates. You must have a system. 
Senator Jackson. To draw on Senator Wiley's analogy, 
which involves with the next question sort of a fallacy, that 
is if you have 3 pistols and I have one, but if I fire first, 
why those extra two don't do much good, or any of the three, 
do they? 
Secretary Gates. Oh, yes, they do good depending on the 
41.011rWiet 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6

731 
bd28 circumstances, depending on the time of warning, depending 
(:) on the reliabilitY of the attack against you and so forth. All 
these factors come into play. 
Senator Jackson. I was just taking his analogy. 
If you are sitting there with 3 pistols and I fire first, 
you don't have time t) get your first one, do you? 
Secretary Gates. On that hypothesis / assume that you 
would outdraw me, Senator. 
Senator Jackson. The real problem, and 2: think you 
tried to make this statement, just missiles, just putting 
in more missiles in itself, if they can be destroyed before 
you can use them don't add to this invulnerable deterrent 
(2) that you referred to, is that not correct? 
Secretary Gates. that is correct. More missiles add to 
his problem of more missiles to take them out. They add to his 
requirements. But more missiles per se are not the total 
answer. 
Senator Jackson. Of course, then in that connection 
me are placing, it is a mutter of public record, Mr. Chairman, 
that our ICBMs are being placed for reasons of economy 
adjacent to our SAC bases, are they not? 
Secretary Gates. I don't know that the reasons were 
economy. I believe it was a sensible way to cooperate. / 
believe the Air Force determined that was the right way to 
do the business. 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6

732 
d29 Senator Jackson. You are using the housekeeping facili-
ties, and for reasons of economy we were so told in the 
Armed Services. 
Secretary Gates. Let's say economy of effiCilincY. 
Senator Jackson. I thought though in developing a deter-
rant capability you want to make sure that it is survivable. 
Is it always wise to, (a) place them in an area where 
you already have manned bombers, where you are adjacent to 
cities e and to make them completely fixed? 
Secretary Gates. They have been very carefully evaluated 
in connection with bomb damage assessment and analyses, and I 
believe that the distance between them is related to their 
survivability in a way that is just as effective as if 
they were widely separated from the home base. 
Senator Jackson. What do you have in mind for this 
to provide more survivable retaliatory deterrence? I am 
referring of course to completely hardened facilities which 
would be fixed. 
I'm referring to mobility onland which involves I presume 
ahead the Minuteman, and mobility on and under the sea. 
I just wonder what your thinking is on this. It seems 
to me that just talking about more missiles that are on 
fixed locations that can be destroyed in a surprise attack 
does not really add to the enemy's problem in the way it 
should.

bd30 Secretary Gates. It adds in an extraordinary way on 
putting a requirement on his production demands. However/ 
I agree with you; Senator, that the more mobile missiles, 
the more concealed missiles, the more invulnerable our 
deterrent, the more effectife that it is. And we are constantly 
working on the programs we have in being and thinking up other 
ideas which I am sure will develop. Just recently, for example, 
we are talking again, although we rejected it last year, again 
about looking at Polaris on surface ships. 
Senator Jackson. I completely agree with you. That was 
turned down. 02 course, Admiral Burke's request for 6 addi-
tional Polaris subs was turned down. What about the use of 
Polaris overseas in connection with the program, with 
our bilateral and NATO agreements with our allies? 
There you have a mobile system of shorter range it is 
true than Minuteman. 
Secretary Gates. This is also under review. 
Senator Jackson. I am pleased to hear that. Now what 
about the Minuteman program? Doyou feel that additional 
funds would speed the time when we would achieve what I think 
is one of the finest deterrent systems that has a survivable 
capability? 
Secretary Gates. up until now, with constant urging 
too, I have been advised that there is no way we can usefully 
spent any additional money on the Minuteman to accelerate its

bd31 procurement in operational status. I have asked this question 
and I received that answer repeatedly. 
We have as you know established or agreed to go ahead 
and build a production facility for the Minuteman. 
Senator Jackson. I would hope that the supporting launch-
ing systems would move as rapidly on a concurrent basis as 
the production system. 
This is one of the real problems is it not? 
Secretary Gates. Yes. 
Senator Jackson. In connection with a fully operational 
or an on-launcher capability when you talk about ballistic 
missiles. 
C.) Secretary Gates. That is correct. 
Senator Jackson. I hope you will recheck that just to 
make sure that we are leaving no stones unturned for reasons of 
finance. 
Secretary Gates. The whole thing could change you 
know at any time. But this is presently correct testimony. 
Senator Jackson. In connection with the B-70 I think 
here again is a classic example where budgets cause a lot of 
difficulty, Mr. Secretary. / have the feeling that the B-70 
is more than just another manned bomber. If I recall my 
history correctly, that we have had to rely on manned bombers 
to put us ahead in commercialariation. It does seem to me 
that we are going to find ourselves in a situation -where once

a irc raft of supersonic speed and we will be behind. 
I would hope that within the Administration some 
consideration would be given to this weapons system on the basis 
of it meeting more than just a manned bomber requirement. 
/ do feel that it has animpact on our prestige in connection 
with commercial aviation. 
I think that there are certain additional military uses 
that are applicable, and certainly it has a great ability 
to provide rapid support in case of limited war, airlift. 
Secretary Gates. I can only repeat that I can personally 
assure you that it was not a fiscal decision. I can 
personally assure you in this case that it was not, because 
I personally participated in the conversations at all levels 
on this program. But I agree with you that 
1111?101. 
Senator Jackson. May I ask this question though, I had 
the impression that each of thp services were given guidelines 
which gives them a ceiling. 
Secretary Gates. No, but the B-70 and other programs 
were separated out and reviewed as programs and we never 
got to the service budgets untilve were through with the 
programs. 
Frankly outside of the fact you would obviously know 
the B-70 was an Air Force program we didn't know the 
Air Force total was when we were reviewing the budget. We

Senator Jackson. All I can say is t1 we must be 
a little more daring: Mr. Secretary, in some of these things.

that there are hazards that may not prove out. 
I felt that from the beginning on Polaris. / was 
recommending Polaris when no one was much interested in 
it. 
Secretary Gates. You were very helpful to me at that 
time. 
Senator Jackson. Thank you very much, but I was just 
hopeful, and I have so much faith in this:in our engineers, 
cur designers and the talent that we have, as I am sure you 
have, that we should be willing once in a while to take a 
chance on these things. 
If we don't, we are going to come out second, coming out 
second is not coming out when you are dealing with / think 
some crucial systems. That is all, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator Symington. Senator Case of South Dakota? 
Senator Case of South Dakota. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Secretary, I too was attracted by your testimony 
with respect to the 3-70. I hope the Senator from Washington 
can wait just a minute because I want to follow up on the 
questions he was asking. 
I was struck by your reference to the 3-70 as a competing

bd34 system with Atlas, Titan and Minuteman and Polaris as a 
missile system. 
I had been under the impression that the B-70 had poten-
tials both in the commercial or civilian field and the 
military field. For example, I thought that the B-70 if develop-
ed satisfactorily offered abilities in conventional war as 
well as in a nuclear war. And Atlas, Titan, Minuteman and 
Polaris are primarily nuclear war weapons are they not? 
Secretary Gates, Yes, Senator. This might be debatable 
opinion, and I am not the expert othexpeople are in this. I 
would rather hear expert testimony on it. My judgment is 
the B-70 is a strategic bomber for a strategic bombing 
mission, and that it would be of very little or no use in 
limited war, however, I would not argue at all with 
Senator Jackson that it had implications for the future of 
commercial aviation, if someone wants a commercial airplane 
for some reason that goes over MACH 3. But it has the impli-
cations in the advancement of the state of art of manned 
aircraft. 
There is no question about that. 
Senator Jackson. Will the Senator yield at that point 
for clarification? 
What concerned me bmdgetwise Mx. Secretary, is that 
sme other branch, the CAB, will want money for assisting 
in our commercial aviation industry to provide this kind of

to be paying for it maybe out of a different pocket. 
Senator Case of South Dakota. Mr. Secretary, would 
you say that the 8-70 program has been abandoned or merely 
that you are continuing the research and development 
before you commit yourself to a volumemoduction program. 
Secretary Gates. I would say the latter. 
Senator Case of South Dakota. Now there was another 
area of testimony earlier, I thought one of the most signi-
ficant points coming up in the hearing was the presentation of 
counsel concerning the budget estimates for ballistic 
missiles from '55 through '60 as compared with the program. 
Did you note the figures? 
Do you substantially agree that there was a substantial 
difference between what was actually spent in the program 
execution? 
Secretary Gates. / have the money that was 
spent, and as / look at the last three or four, this was 
correct. But yOu must recall until 1956 or '55 there was very 
little money spent. 
Senator Case of South Dakota. Yes, I recognize that. 
Secretary Gates. We are now up to 3 and a half. I have 
the money. I don't have the initial request that counsel 
was referring to.

4:1) 
about this is what lapse of time or what lead time is there 
between the time that you finalized the budget figures to present 
4:) 
to Congress and the time of program execution. 
Secretary Gates. Well, Senator, it would depend on 
the program. We start working on the budget about this time 
of year, the fiscal 1962 budget in the services, and a great 
many people devote a lot of time to it from now until 
it is finalized. It gets into serious discussions in the fall, 
usually depending uponother pressing problems, but normally 
it would got into serious discussions around October 
and November it would be very serious discussions, and the 
budget is usually furnished for printing if my memory is 
right before t1 15th of December. 
So it is around the first week in December it is pretty 
Tall established. 
Senator Case of South Dakota. Finalized in December. 
Your program of execution mould be roughly perhaps 18 months 
later 
Secretary Gates. Yes, I think that would be a fair 
statement. 
Senator Case of South Dakota. Do you stand still during 
those 18 months? 
Secretary Gates. No, we don't. And of course we have 
been given and congress has recognized this, no year funds

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
741 
bd38 for procurement and this is often sufficient or is 
normally sufficient to carry over during the period of the 
smnmertime between sessions og Congress. 
Senate Case of South Dakota. mr. Chairman, I think 
that the time limitation will prevent me from pursuing the 
question, but I wanted to make this observation. The 
Secretary and others testifyingfor the Defense Department 
used the phrase repeatedly that their program is under 
continuous review, which is as it should be in my judgment. 
I would hate to think that if they finalized their budget 
picture in DeceMber, that between that and a year from the 
following June they did not change their program if during 
that 18 month period they found that there were some things 
that ought to be dropped and some things that ought to be aug-
mented. 
So that I am glad there is some difference between the 
kmdget figures and the program figures. It seems to me that 
without that we would be chained to estimates and pictures 
that were anywhere from 6 months to a year and a half old. 
That there ought to be changes. There ought to be 
augmentations of some programs, and probably decreases 
in other programs. Some programs ought to be dropped 
depending upon What you learn during this interim between 
the time you have submitted your budget and the time you 
spend your last dollar in a given fiscal year.

of what is called reprogramming, and this has been very 
helpful because of this time period, and there always has been 
this kind of reprogramming in the process.

to maintain a posture that will permit deployed n)rces to 
handle limited wars of all sizes and character. 
Third, to make .a contribution to whatever cold war 
posture would be helpful to our foreign policy. 
Senator Cannon. Have those been our national objectives 
in that respect for some period of time? 
Secretary Gates. Yes. 
Senator Cannon. And would that apply as to long range 
objectives as well as to immediate objectives? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. 
Senator Cannon. The reason I ask those questions is 
because in a speech you made on May 8, 1959 you say: 
"We should ask scientists and industry to help us 
with fresh thinking on our long-range objectives and on our 
weapons systems". 
Secretary Gates. Maybe I ought to clarify. I thought 
we were talking about military objectives. Of course, there 
am other national objectives. 
Senator Cannon. In other words, in your speech you were 
not relating there specifically to long-range objectives 
of the military type?

Senator Cannon. I am sorry, I was attending that one 
also as a member of the Armed Services Committee. I will say 
since the time you had appeared before the Armed Services 
Committee? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, the decision to augment, I mean 
accelerate the BMEWS system has been made since I appeared 
before the Armed Services Committee. 
Senator Cannon. And that is to give us an earlier 
warning capability? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. 
Senator Cannon. Now with reference to the BMEWS system 
you indicate that agreement has been reached on the third 
location. I don't suppose any construction has started there? 
Secretary Gates. I believe it is just about to start 
and we now have under study the same thing that we did in 
connection with the second one, to see whether this can be

bd42 accelerated. 
Senator Cannon. And if it isn't classified, would you 
ate when the MEWS system would be completely operational 
(:) for the purpose for which it was intended. 
Secretary Gates. It is classified: Senator. It will be 
completely operational is difficult also. It will be in very 
good shape as we go along with the increments. 
Senator Cannon. If this is not classified, I wonder if 
you would state whether or not the MEWS system is designed 
to protect only in a certain direction, and that the additional 
range indicated by the firing of the ICBM into the Pacific 
would indicate that the Russians have a capability of firing 
from an entirely different direction for which our MEWS 
would not give us any warning? I don't want to get into that 
if that is classified information. 
Secretary Gates. No, I understand, Senator. My under-
standing is, and I think it is right technically, that the 
BMEWS system when installed will be completely effective. 
Senator Cannon. Will give us complete coverage? 
Secretary Gates. Yes. 
Senator Cannon. You made the statement that our defense, 
our present plans are adequate for deterrent in the years 
ahead, and again you said our defense programs are designed 
to maintain this deterrent strength. 
How far ahead in your opinion is our deterrent posture

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
746 
bd43 adequately protected now under present plans? 
Secretary Gates. As far ahead as the present estimates 
and understanding of our relative positions are valid, and sub-
ject to changes in actions on the part of the Soviet Union. 
So fax as we can See ahead with present information, as I 
say, this information sometimes changes very quickly. 
But our planning is based on the plans as we see them 
ahead. You certainly have to plan ahead a couple of years 
because this is the lead time on some of the things we are 
doing. 
Senator Cannon. Then in your opinion the things that 
we are doing now axe adequate to give us a deterrent posture in 
the foreseeable future? 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. 
Senator Cannon. And that includes the present plans 
that we have insofar as the ICBMs are concerned, the Atlas? 
Secretary Gates. Total mix of missiles, yes. 
Senator Cannon. Total mix of missiles. 
Secretary Gates. Yes. 
Senator Cannon. Including ICBMs and Polaris which you 
say you refer to as an ICBM. 
Secretary Gates. Yes, sir. 
Senator Cannon. Now if that is your position, then 
why do you state that you are now reconsidering whether 
you would change the ICBM program, that is to bring more

747 
bd44 of them in and put them in hardened sites sooner, and why 
are you reconsidering the plans to speed up the Polaris 
program if we already now bare what you say is an adequate deter-
rent plan? 
Secretary Gates. If we can be more effective, we want 
to be so, and in the case of Polaris, as I have testified 
earlier, before other committees, we have held it back to a 
two or three year possibility even though the investment 
ald the effort has been very, very large. We have held 
it back on the basis that we wanted more technical informa-
tion. 
Now we have 2 very significant tests pertaining to Polaris 
this month, if they are on schedule, we believe that when 
this is evaluated, we may have additional confidence to do 
samething different. We have just got that under review. 
In the case of the Atlas which we have under review, 
it looks like a more efficient way of doing the business. I am 
not sure it will turn out to be but it looks so. This I have 
asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff to review. I think we 
should continue to improve, and particularly improve in the 
more advanced things every time we get an opportunity to 
do so. 
Senator Cannon. And then would you say that if you do 
augment both of these programs, that we would have a stronger 
deterrent in the future than we have under plans right at the

bd45 moment. 
(:) Secretary Gates. Naturally if we can include more missiles 
at sea in submarines, we are going to have a bigger deterrence. 
(:) Senator Cannon. Then you do feel --
Secretary Gates. It doesn't mean the present one is inade-
quate. It means the seaand one will be better. 
Senator Cannon. And that it would be a wise idea to have 
more. 
Secretary Gates. More particularly of the advanced sys-
tems that we are so terribly interested in yes. 
SenatorCannon. In other words: you are saying in your 
opinion now we are planning for an adequate deterrent, but 
you would like to have a better than adequate deterrent 
if these plans work out? 
Secretary Gates. I would like to move as rapidly as 
us can on the improved second generation items that we have 
in research. 
Senator Cannon. You made the statement in the questioning 
a little earlier that we have an air alert now of 
sorts. 
Do you actually mean that we have an air alert with 
airplanes flying with nuclear weapons on board now, flying 
in an alert status or wouldwu have the public believe that, 
or are you just referring to the fact that we have some of 
SAC in the air on a training status all of the time?

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
749 
Secretary Gates. It is a training program, and I would 
not want to infer that it was a sizeable program, but they 
are on alert status all of the time the same as an air-
borne alert would be. 
Senator Cannon. I am not talking about the 
ground alert, the 15 minute alert. 
Secretary Gates. I understand. I am answering the 
question as I understand it, in the air. 
Senator Cannon. In other words, we have a limited air 
alert in the air at the moment now with weapons. 
Secretary Gates. That is correct. 
Senator Cannon. And the 'weapon is armed so that it could 
be dropped in anger if need be. 
Secretary Gates. That is correct. 
Senator Cannon. I asked that information because that 
is not the information that has been given me and I believe that 
has been given meMbers of this committee on other occasions 
by other people in a position to know. 
Secretary Gates. I will certainly correct the record, Mr. 
Chairman, if this is wrong, but this is completely my under-
standing and the order of magnitude of this is nothing like 
the order of magnitude that General Power has recommended. 
/ want to be clear on that. 
Senator Cannon. Yes, I understand that. 
Secretary Gates. But we have strategic bombers in the

bd47 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
750 
air on a ready status at the present time. 
Senator Cannon. And those bombers have assigned targets. 
Secretary Gates. That is correct. ? 
Senator Cannon. You, referred to the present plans for 
the on the shelf airborne alert. Let me ask you if thetresent 
planning for this so-called on the shelf alert would permit 
Genral Power to fly at any time in the future an airborne 
alert to the extent he says is necessary to 'Insure the surviva-
bility of SAC in the event of a surprise attack. 
Secretary Gates. I donut want to get complicated, but 
it is a complicated sUbject. First / will answer specifically. 
It is not what General Power requested. It is less, less of a 
capability than General Power requested. 
However, you have to deal in terms of an airborne 
alert with the length of time the planes fly. Obviously a 
great many aircraft in SAC could be put on an airborne alert 
for a few days and there would be no problem at all of degrading 
the force. 
If you keep them longer than a certain number of times 
you certainly downgrade the force. What we are doing is 
buying a capability for a continuous 365 days a year 24 
hours a day airborne alert as an insurance policy you might 
say. 
This capability is not as large as General Power 
requested or testified to. However, it gets again into the 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/11/18: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601280001-6 
751 
bd48 question of time of aircraft in the air, and so forth and 
it is a, complicated subject,, 
. , Frankly I think it is largely a matter of degree of 
capability that the argument is abcmtx and we are satisfied 
that this degree of capability that we are providing at the 
present time is a pretty healthy. one. 
Senator Cannon. Is it the degree of capability or  
it because of the difference of opinion as to what you would 
have to have airborne to avoid destruction of our SAC 
forces in the event of a surprise attack? 
Secretary Gates. It all gets into all the other coMbina-
tions of whether a salvo attack is possible. How much warning 
time you have and how much reliability they have and how hard 
you are, how dispersed you are and so forth. So that it is 
a difficult thing to analyze. 
believe that we have a capability to fly a certain 
very substantial airlift for a short period of time any time 
we want to, and I believe we are building in a capability 
to fly a very substantial number for a longer period of 
time any time we want to, and it is a matter of degree of how 
much reserve, spare engines and spare parts and how much 
additional training is required to do this. 
The Joint Chiefs have reviewed this, and I believe they 
are agreed that we are doing the thing about correctly. 
Senator Cannon. And it it based in part on your analysis

that the Russians would not be in a position to launch an 
all out surprise attack in the foreseeable future. 
Secretary Gates. It is based on an analysis of various 
types of attack over various periods of time. 
Senator Cannon. Mr. Secretary: in answer to a question 
from Senator Martin

Senator Symington. I think the Senator

Senator Cannon. I have only one more question if I may, 
Mr. Chairman. 
In answer to a question from Senator Martin you said the 
Department of Defense is now functioning satisfactorily. 
Does that hold true as to the Joint Chiefs of Staff also? 
Secretary Gates. I believe so, Senator Cannon. 
I am very pleased with the arrangements. 
senat,r Cannon. I raise that question because on May 
8, 1959 you said "The Joint Chiefs of Staff continue to strug-
gle with divided opinions as to the emphasis to be placed 
on various systems: and the Secretary of Defense continues 
to struggle handicapped by traditionally divided service 
opinions." 
Secretary Gates. That is right. 
Senator Cannon. Is that true today? 
Secretary Gates. I think we have made a big step. 
/ don't want to be boastful about what we have put into being 
and I don't want to be premature in judging its results. But

Senator Symington. The committee will now unfortunately 
because of the time, Senator Johnson just said we could go 
to 1 o'clock, and not beyond. 
I want to say, Mx. Secretary, may I thank you for your 
invariably considerate and kind effort before the committee. 
I am not at all satisfied yet as to where we stand in 
this matter. I think there are many more questions that I 
would like to ask and I hope that you can adjust your time 
and the committee can adjust its time and we can proceed in 
an effort to clarify this situation so that we understand 
where we are. 
I would hope that you would consider, in order to eliminate 
much if not most of this confusion, doing this year 
what Secretary McElroy did last year and release these 
ratios as given to us by the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Senator Saltonstal/. Would the Senator yield? 
Senator Symington. I would be glad to. 
Senator Saltonstal/. Mr. Chairman, may I express for this 
side of the table our appreciation of your frank clear 
testimony this morning, Mr. Secretary, and we wish you well

May.
