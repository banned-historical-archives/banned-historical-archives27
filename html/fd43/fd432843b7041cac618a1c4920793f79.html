 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE
 cording to the formula'which distributes
 these Federal funds, the higher the per
 capita income of a State, the lower the
 Federal allotment percentage.
 The District of Columbia since 1954
 for the purposes of the act has been
 treated as a State. During this time the
 District has been among the top three
 States as to its per capita income and
 at the present time ranks at the top.
 The District, an entirely urban area,
 has a level of per capita income which,
 while comparable to the level of other
 central cities of standard statistical
 metropolitan areas, is considerably above
 the level of per capita income of States
 where generally, the per capita income
 of rural areas and small cities tends to
 pull the level down.  This results in the
 District, being highest in per capita in-
 come, receiving the smallest allotment
 percentage-331/3 percent-and, there-
 fore, a comparatively small allotment of
 Federal funds.
 The District's rehabilitation program,
 although operating in only one large city,
 has to cover both the functions and re-
 sponsibilities for overall program direc-
 tion ordinarily assumed by an agency of
 State government, and those ordinarily
 exercised by the State through its dis-
 trict offices in cities, counties, and other
 political subdivisions. This dual respon-
 s bility, together with the needed expan-
 sion of the vocational rehabilitation pro-
 gram in the District, suggests that the
 most equitable treatment would be that
 used by the Congress in providing for
 unique situations in other jurisdictions
 which are not one of the 50 States.
 The District of Columbia presently Is
 not able to expand its program to greater
 capacity, due mainly to its being con-
 sidered under the Vocational Rehabilita-
 tion Act as a State. The bill which I am
 'introducing would increase the District
 of Columbia's allotment percentage to 75
 percent, the same as other jurisdictions
 requiring special consideration, such as

 S OP THE INVASION TALK
 the flamboyant young Prime Minister,
 Ky, of the Saigon government recently
 urged that instead of waging a long war
 to win a victory in South Vietnam, North
 Vietnam should be invaded by land forces
 pouring over the 17th parallel from South
 Vietnam and invading from the sea.
 This was an irresponsible statement typi-
 cal of the reckless and brash young
 puppet that we have installed as head
 of the Saigon government.
 What is frightening is the fact that
 Secretary of State Dean Rusk, when
 asked to comment on this statement at
 a press conference, said:
 There is no policy desire to move into
 North Vietnam or the demilitarized zone.
 It will depend, Mr. Rusk said, "on the
 turn of events; the commander will have
 to do those things to protect the security
 of his troops."
 Mr. President, of course a field com-
 mander has the obligation to do those
 things necessary to protect the security
 of his troops.  However, the Founding
 Fathers, the architects of our Constitu-
 tion, provided that civilian authority
 should always be supreme over the mili-
 tary.  If it is not our policy to move
 into North Vietnam and the demilitar-

 extent that any system, involving so many
 individuals, could approach perfection.
 However, as we have noted, the track sys-
 tem appears to be doomed, to be replaced by
 a system of "team teaching" and ungraded
 elementary classes for the more backward
 pupils.  At this writing, the anti-trackers
 on the School Board appear to be rather
 nebulous in their thinking.  They speak of
 "innovations" and that's about it.
 We believe innovations are fine, but let's
 make certain where they lead before we put
 them into effect.
 The lessons of the Head Start program
 should not be overlooked.  The Head Start
 idea was, and is, splendid, tbut it began, and,
 to an extent, has continued, with little plan-
 ning and scant teacher training.  Better
 that. we should have studied what has been
 learned elsewhere about pre-school teach-
 ing-especially in Scandinavia-before we
 plunged into something we knew practically
 nothing about.
 We hope, then, that the newly constituted
 School Board will make haste slowly in elim-
 inating the  track  system.  We hope  that
 the members will bear in mind the ancient
 aphorism: "Don't trade something for notll.
 ing."                                       tt
 Incidentally, and quite by the by, in this
 city where citizens are rightfully concerned
 about the educational facilities available to
 the current generation, we call attention to a
 graphic exposition of just what's on tap
 here.  We refer to the window displays at
 Woodward & Lothrop's downtown store.  We
 urge Washingtonians to take a tour around
 them.  We believe they'll be surprised-and
 proud-of what has been accomplished up
 to now.
 however, the top priority goes to dona-
 tion under the donable surplus property
 program for use in schools and hospitals.
 It is right that in a humane society, edu-
 cation and health should have high pri-
 ority. Finally, if the property cannot be
 used by either the Federal Government
 or by schools and hospitals, it may be
 sold. This is the outline of S. 2610 which
 I hope will be passed soon by the House.
 One subject being examined by the
 Monogan subcommittee is a recent Gen-
 eral Services Administration directive
 which redefines the categories of prop-
 erty which can be sold or exchanged for
 new property.  The Defense Department
 on August 10 announced its compliance
 with this directive, although many peo-
 ple-including                                                           Chairman   MONAGAN-
 have voiced their concern that the dona-
 ble program may be harmed by the new
 policy. In view of this concern, the Sen-
 ate action on S. 2610, and the present
 House hearings, I ask that the Defense
 Department stop sales of surplus prop-
 erty until Congress has expressed its in-
 tent on this matter.
 The Congress of the United States has
 many times reaffirmed its dedication to
 the donable program, and will constantly
 be alert to any administrative regula-
 tions which would weaken the program.

 both houses of Congress will join me in

 Asian nations are directly concerned

 is another way to protect the freedom of
 the people of southeast Asia, a way less
 costly in terms of American lives, Mr.
 President, we must seize upon it.
 We can leave no stone unturned in our
 search for an honorable solution to the
 Vietnamese problem and we can leave no
 stone unturned in our search to find a
 way to lessen the toll of American lives
 lost in solving that problem.
 Therefore, I hope the United States
 can give the closest attention and con-

 THE DONABLE SURPLUS PROPERTY
 PROGRAM-HEARINGS          ALL ASIAN PEACE CONFERENCE
 Mr.   METCALF.  Mr.  President,  I
 would like to call the attention of the
 Senate to extremely important hearings
 which are being held in the House this
 week. I refer to the hearings of the
 Donable Surplus Property Subcommittee
 of the House Government Operations
 Committee.  The subcommittee, whose
 chairman is Representative MONAGAN, of
 Connecticut, is seeking to evaluate the
 donable surplus property program which
 I discussed briefly yesterday. May I re-
 peat that I consider this program to be
 a very valuable one, in giving much need-
 ed property to deserving schools and hos-
 pitals.
 Mr. President, Chairman MONAGAN said
 at his hearing this morning that he
 wanted to demonstrate the dedication of
 the Congress of the United States to the
 donable surplus property program.  The
 Senate has demonstrated its dedication
 to that program by passing S. 2610.  I
 was happy to participate in the hearings
 which led to the writing of the bill and
 also to join as cosponsor with Senator
 GRUENING who introduced the legislation.
 The bill was assured passage by the ex-
 peditious work of the chairman of the
 Government Operations Committee, the
 Senator from Arkansas [Mr. MCCLEL-
 LAN].
 Under S. 2610, the first priority for
 Government surplus property goes  to
 possible utilization in some agency of the
 Federal Government-"further Federal
 utilization."  So we first make sure that
 no property that could profitably be used
 in Government is given up. After this,
 No. 140-4
 Mr. TOWER.  Mr. President, more
 and more American boys are daily risk-
 ing their lives in their effort to protect
 the Republic of South Vietnam from
 Communist slavery.
 This is the unavoidable price a nation
 of freemen must pay to preserve freedom.
 We are in Vietnam with a purpose and
 we are there with a right.  Our purpose
 is to preserve the freedom of 14 million
 human beings in that land and our right
 is the right of all freemen to protect
 that which they cherish and hold dear.
 But let us never lose sight of the reason
 for our fight in Vietnam.  Let us never
 become so concerned with the waging of
 war that we forget that its object is
 peace; a just and honorable peace.
 Mr. President, I hope we will carefully
 examine every avenue leading toward
 such a peace in Vietnam.  I do not speak
 here of a peace which appeases the
 enemy and only whets his appetite for
 more and larger conquests.  I trust that
 we have learned the lesson of that folly.
 I speak instead of a peace that guar-
 antees the freedom of the 14 million peo-
 ple of South Vietnam; a peace which.
 guarantees the protection of the con-
 cept of individual freedom for which
 Americans have fought and died all over
 this globe.
 A constructive suggestion has been
 brought forth on this floor by my dis-
 tinguished colleague from Kentucky [Mr.
 MORTON].  He has focused the attention
 of this body on a proposal to examine the
 feasibility of an all-Asian conference to
 try to find an equitable solution to the
 SCHOOL MILK AS IMPORTANT AS
 OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH
 ,Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, the
 budget for fiscal 1967 proposes to spend
 $219.9 million on oceanography.  These
 funds will be spent, if appropriated, on
 oceanographic research and survey pro-
 grams.  Yet last year the administra-
 tion spent only $100 million to provide
 milk for the Nation's young under the
 special milk program for schoolchildren.
 Now I do not intend to criticize the
 various oceanography programs of the
 Federal Government. However, I do feel
 that the health of the young people of
 our Nation is at least as important.  If
 we can afford to spend almost $220 mil-
 lion for oceanography, we can afford to
 spend at least half that amount to see
 that our children receive milk.
 The Senate has appropriated $105 mil-
 lion for the school milk program.  Past
 statistics would indicate that even this
 amount, if it is accepted by the House,
 would be inadequate to provide full Fed-
 eral reimbursement for half-pints of
 milk at the prior maximum level. Con-
 sequently I intend to fight for adequate
 funds in a supplemental appropriation
 bill before Congress adjourns this year.
 PRAYERS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio.  Mr. President,
 the first 10 amendments to the Constitu-
 tion of our country, termed with affec-
 tion "the Bill of Rights," were adopted
 on the demand of men who had won the
 Revolutionary War.
 The first amendment guarantees free-
 dom of speech, freedom of press, and
 freedom of religious beliefs.  It is the
 cornerstone of every American's freedom
 of conscience.

 and in the church. Every American has
 the constitutionally guaranteed right to
 worship as he pleases, and not to worship
 if he pleases.  He can pray at home, at
 church, on the job-in short anywhere.
 However, to authorize prayers as part of
 the public school routine is to inject the
 state into this private matter of con-
 science and belief.
 Public school prayers could never be
 truly voluntary. There would always be
 pressure on school pupils to conform.
 The first amendment to the Constitution
 should not be amended or tampered with.
 I will never vote to weaken our inherited
 doctrine of absolute separation of church
 and state.  When we weaken the Bill
 of Rights in one respect, then other pre-
 cious rights such as the right of fair
 trial, freedom from compulsory self-
 incrimination and from unreasonable
 search and seizure might be next in order
 to be destroyed.
 Mr. President there appeared an ex-
 cellent editorial in the Cincinnati En-
 quirer on August 4, 1966, entitled "Pray-
 ers In the Public Schools." I commend
 this to my colleagues and ask unanimous
 consent that it be printed in the RECORD
 at this point as part of my remarks.,
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 PRAYERS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
 The Senate Subcommittee on Constitu-
 tional Amendments this week began formal
 hearings  on  Sen.  EVERETT  M.  DIRKSEN'S
 amendment  to  undo     the  U.S. Supreme
 Court's work in connection with prayers in
 the nation's public schools.
 Like Senator DIRKSEN'S other amendment
 on the subject of apportionment of the state
 legislatures, the so-called prayer amend-
 ment is designed to redefine what most
 Americans  regarded as  the unquestioned
 status quo before the Supreme Court acted.
 The specific court decisions that would be
 undone by the amendment are two:
 In the case of Engel vs. Vitale in 1962, the
 Supreme Court held in a 6-1 decision that
 the use of a prayer composed. by New York
 State officipls and required to be recited
 aloud by students at the beginning of the
 school day constituted a violation of the
 First Amendment.  Even the fact that the
 prayer was designed to be "neutral" as far
 as the various religious denominations were
 concerned did not affect its unconstitution-
 aiity.
 In the twin cases of Abington Township
 vs. Schempp and Murray vs. Curlett a year
 later, the court held in an 8-1 decision that

 at least 10 verses from the Bible at the be..                 System, deserve commendation for their

 framers.
 As emotions have cooled, more and more
 Americans have become less indignant.  Re-
 ligious leaders in particular have tended to
 uphold the court-a circumstance that bodes
 ill for what Senator DIR.KSEN'S amendment
 seeks to accomplish.
 The National Council of Churches main-
 tains that the leadership of 93% of the na-
 tion's 56 million Protestants are firmly op-
 posed to the Dirksen amendment.  Jewish
 groups are also opposed.  And among the
 nation's Catholic bishops, opinion is so di-
 vided that the Catholic church will probably
 take no stand at all.
 What  support  the    Dirksen amendment
 enjoys-and it is considerable nonetheless-
 comes from rank-and-file church-goers who
 feel that the Supreme Court decisions of
 1962 and 1963 amount to a denial of God.
 Even though we did not welcome those
 decisions, we are inclined to feel that the
 Dirksen amendment should not be passed.
 We have frequently spoken in this space of
 the vital importance of religion. in American
 life.  But we question whether the public
 school system is the proper apparatus for
 nurturing the religious spirit in America.  In
 too many instances-and religion is only
 one-American parents have tended to foist
 off on the schools more and more of the re-
 sponsibilities that are properly theirs.                                                                                                 The
 effect of the Supreme Court rulings was to
 put the religious responsibility back where
 it  belongs-in  the  laps  of  the    parents.
 Should the Dirksen amendment find its way
 into the Constitution, many parents would
 feel once more that they had disposed of
 that responsibility.
 Conscientious   parents,   we  think,     have
 nothing to fear from the status quo.
 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN THE
 COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY
 Mr. TALMADGE.  Mr. President, a
 number of students of the collective-
 bargaining process-men who are com-
 mitted to that process and want to see
 it work with maximum effectiveness-
 have quite correctly been concerned by
 the occasional breakdown of that process,
 or the development of tendencies which
 seem to prevent its functioning the way
 we had hoped it might.
 It seems to me, therefore, quite heart-
 ening to observe sincere effort to make
 collective bargaining work in the Na-
 tion's tremendously important and sensi-
 tive communications system,.  I believe
 that both the union involved., the Com-
 munications Workers of America, AFL-
 CIO, and the management of the West-
 ern Electric Co., a division of the Bell
 attitude.  It had no pat formula; it
 sought improvements on a number of is-
 sues, but on each of these issues it pro-
 posed discussion and examination-in
 other words, collective bargaining.
 Third, the union did not feel that it
 was necessary to involve the Government
 in the collective bargaining process.
 CWA has given us, I believe, a highly
 commendable example of the method by
 which a free and democratic union seeks
 to achieve its objectives at a national
 company without reliance on govern-
 mental power.
 Fourth, I believe that CWA deserves
 praise for going to the public with its
 story. It has not sought to bargain
 with Western Electric through the press;
 that would be unwise and hurtful to the
 chance of getting agreement. But CWA
 has not hesitated to take its philosophy-
 about collective bargaining, about guide-
 lines, about its general objectives-to
 the general public.
 All of this I find a most commendable
 posture by CWA.  It is a union whose
 national and local leaders have done
 much to earn a reputation for responsi-
 bility and for a sense of obligation not
 just to their own members but to the
 entire community, local and national.
 I have no facts upon which to make
 any judgments about the actual content
 of the collective bargaining discussions
 between CWA and Western Electric.
 Without specific facts, I do net know
 what is a fair wage increase figure, or
 what should be done specifically about
 vacations  or holidays or pensions or
 health plans for Western Electric em-
 ployees.
 But it seems to me signally encourag-
 ing that a major trade union. and a
 major communications company have
 been trying to make collective bargaining
 work, with a minimum of histrionics, or
 name calling, or public airing of the
 details of their negotiation efforts.  For
 this effort, CWA and Western Electric
 management  deserve        congratulations
 from the public, from the labor move-
 ment,                                                                                                  from        forward-looking           man-
 agement.
 Let us hope that this collective bar-
 gaining process, undertaken here with
 mutual respect and a sense of the eco-
 nomic realities, will eventually come to
 a  sensible,  practical  conclusion  and
 agreement between American labor and
 management.  The public deserves this
 reminder that collective bargaining can
 work, and work well, on a national scale.

 what, on the surface, appears to be
 favored treatment.  Yesterday I made
 some remarks concerning Senator Wu.-.
 LIAMS' statement and my -thoughts sug-
 gesting that this was a scandalous way
 in which to handle our Government con-,
 tracts. I suggest that perhaps the Sen-
 ate should consider looking into the pro-
 cedures involved.
 Yesterday I referred to the fact that,
 on one hand, our Government is suing
 the McCloskey Co. for $5 million because
 of_ the Government's contention that the
 McCloskey Co. was negligent in the per-
 formance of its contract to build the Bos-
 ton Veterans' Administration Hospital
 and thus poor construction resulted In
 the loss of the exterior wall which had to
 be rebuilt.  Our Government, on the
 other hand, improperly, in my opinion,
 is entering into new contracts with the
 same company for the construction of
 the $12 million mint at Philadelphia.
 This does not make sense.
 We could not expect any reasonable
 man to deal with a company that had
 treated him as the McCloskey firm has
 treated the U.S. Government.
 On July 19, I entered in the RECORD a
 letter I wrote to Mr. Lawson B. Knotts,
 Jr., Administrator of the General Serv-
 tces  Administration,  questioning  the
 award to the McCloskey firm. That let-
 ter appears on page 15392 of the July 19
 RECORD.  In fairness to Mr. Knott, and
 to inform all Senators, I ask unanimous
 eonsent to have placed in the RECORD Mr.
 Knott's response, dated August 2.
 Mr. President, I also asked to have
 printed in the RECORD a letter I received
 from Ramsey Clark, Deputy Attorney
 General, U.S. Department of Justice.
 Mr. Clark is responding to my letter of
 July 26, wherein I asked to be brought
 up to date on the status of the McCloskey
 suit and to know what the allegations
 were. I think Senators will find it inter-
 gsting to see how the Department of Jus-
 tice looks upon the McCloskey firm and
 how the General Services Administra-
 tion looks upon it. I think this situation
 deserves Immediate Senate attention.
 There being no objection, the letters
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION,
 Washington, D.C., August 2, 1966.
 Heal.. MILWARD L. SIMPSON,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR SIMPSON: Reference is made
 to your letter of July 19, 1966, concerning
 award of the contract for construction of
 the new U.S. Mint in Philadelphia to the
 firm of McCloskey & Co., Inc., and suggest-
 ing that McCloskey & Co., Inc., be precluded
 from  further  Government  contracts  and
 denied the Mint contract.
 As you know, debarment Is a severe pen-
 alty which can easily destroy a going busi-
 ness, inasmuch as debarment by one Govern-
 ment agency is grounds for similar action by
 others.  Consequently, the requirements of
 Constitutional "duo process" have necessi-
 tated the erection, of procedural safeguards
 against abuse and limitations upon the power
 of contracting agencies to impose such a
 sanction.  The Federal Procurement Regula-
 tions reflect these considerations and are
 specific as to matters that constitute grounds
 for debarment
 allude In your letter, to support a debarment.
 The mere fact that a civil actioll has been
 instituted against the McCloskey firm in
 connection with the Veterans Administration
 hospital in Boston Is not sufficient evidence,
 in and of itself, upon which to base so dras-
 tic: an action as debarment.
 ,Quite apart from the foregoing, we must
 also mention that the McCloskey firm's rec-
 ord of performance under contracts with the
 General Services Administration has been
 satisfactory.  Among the more recent con-
 tracts performed for GSA by McCloskey &
 Co., Inc., was the construction of Federal
 Office building No. 6, a $10,000,000 project.
 McCloskey has also satisfactorily completed
 the contract for construction of the sub-
 structure of the new Mint.   Against this
 factually documented record of satisfactory
 contract performance, we would be acting
 prematurely if we were to base a debarment
 or finding of nonresponsibility on a matter
 that is being litigated.
 ]?lease be assured that we share your con-
 cern in safeguarding the national interest in
 the selection of Government contractors.
 Sincerely yours,
 LAwsoN B. KNOTT, Jr.
 Administrator.
 U.S. DEPARTMENT OP JUSTICE,
 OF:eICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL,
 Washington, D.C., August 9, 1966.
 Hon. MILWARD L. SIMPSON,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR SIMPSON: Your letter to the
 Attorney General bearing the date of July
 26, 1966 and relating to McCloskey & Com-
 pany has been referred to me for reply.  Suit
 against McCloskey & Company is being tried
 in Boston before the Federal District Court.
 A Special Master was appointed by the Court
 and hearings were held from March 30, 1966
 until June 10, 1966.  They will resume on
 August 16, 1966, and based on present prog-
 ress it is not anticipated that they will con-
 clude for several months, or that a decision
 of the District Court will be issued before the
 summer or fall of 1967.
 The Government's complaint alleges that
 on February 15, 1950 the Government entered
 Into a contract with McCloskey & Company
 for the construction of a hospital at a con-
 tract price of $10,563,000, the hospital to be
 constructed  in  accordance  with  drawings,
 plans and specifications prepared by a joint
 venture composed of Coolidge, Shepley, Bul-
 finch and Abbott, a partnership and Charles
 T. Main, Inc., a corporation; that the Gov-
 ernment entered into a contract with the
 Architect-Engineer whereby said Architect-
 Engineer agreed to furnish a resident engi-
 neer and other inspection personnel to su-
 pervise construction for the purpose of as-
 suring compliance by McCloskey with the
 approved drawings and specifications;  that
 construction of the hospital began on or
 about May 27, 1950 and was completed on or
 about June, 1952; that about June of 1953
 the outer brick wall began to spall,' bulge,
 crack and loosen and that this condition con-
 tinued; that in 1961 an exploratory contract
 was entered into with a firm of consulting
 engineers, Weiskopf and Pickworth, and that
 based in part on their recommendations the
 Government determined in 1962 that there
 were so many unauthorized departures from
 the contract plans and specifications by Mc-
 Closkey &  Company  and  failures  by the
 Architect-Engineer properly to inspect and
 supervise McCloskey's contract performance
 that local repairs were not sufficient and that
 it was necessary to remove and replace the
 brick outer wall and windows and to con-
 struct a new frame to support the new outer
 wall; that the defects and deficiencies con-
 sisted In part of the misalignment; of con-
 crete columns, of the failure to Install some
 23, .1966
 relieving angles used to support the brick
 Work, of the failure to install in many places
 metal ties and anchors which tie the outer
 brick wall to the inner concrete frame; that
 the cause of the failure described was the
 negligence of McCloskey & Company in the
 performance of-the construction contract and
 the negligent performance by the Architect-
 Engineer of the inspection contract; that the
 Government has been damaged in the ap-
 proximate sum of $5 million.
 The files of the Department reflect but
 one other action against McCloskey & Com-
 pany.   In this action it appears that the
 Government was assigned an account re-
 ceivable in the approximate amount of $21,-
 000, owed by McCloskey & Company.  How-
 ever, McCloskey & Company paid a material-
 man creditor of the assignor a sum in excess
 of $21,000, and under the Miller Act was
 discharged of its debt to the assignor. In
 short, the assignee (the United States) was
 subordinated to the materialman.  Hence, it
 is expected that this action will be dismissed
 in the near future.
 The pending criminal indictment against
 Mr. Baker does not involve allegations con-
 cerning Mr. McCloskey or McCloskey & Com-
 pany.    \
 Sincerely,
 RAMSEY CLARK,
 Deputy Attorney General.
 THE BACKTRACKERS
 Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. Pres-
 ident, I ask unanimous consent to insert
 in the RECORD an editorial, entitled "The
 Backtrackers," which appeared in the
 Washington Daily News of August 11,
 1966.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD
 as follows:
 TILE BACKTRACKERS
 And so it seems that the "track" system
 in the D.C. public schools is on the way
 out.
 The new members of the School Board,
 having voted down a proposal to add a fifth
 track for pupils who have fallen far behind
 their contemporaries, may now be expected
 to succeed in eliminating the track system
 altogether.
 Well, so be it.
 Our own position has been made clear
 many times.  We have felt that the institu-
 tion of the track system by Superintendent
 Carl Hansen-after he had presided over the
 peaceful  integration  process  here-was  a
 wise move.   We felt that this system. pro-
 vided for at least a partial solution to two
 major problems, namely, making it possible
 for relatively deprived pupils to trade up
 scholastically, while, at the same time, giv-
 ing more gifted pupils the opportunity to
 proceed at a rate equal to their abilities.
 We still feel that way.  We still feel. that
 any society has this  dual obligation.   It
 cannot overlook the needs of the previously
 deprived.  Equally, it must not Inhibit those
 who are born equipped to become intellectual
 leaders.
 Let's not delude ourselves about this.  All
 men  are not created  intellectually equal.
 We shall be doing a major disservice to the
 future if we believe otherwise.
 Such mean as Albert Einstein and Ralph
 Bunche seldom appear among us.  To pre-
 sume that all of us can, with equal oppor-
 tunity, equal them is to subscribe to the
 veriest nonsense.
 We believe that the track system, for all
 its  manifest  insufficiencies,  1s  aimed  at
 making It possible for each pupil to pro-
 ceed toward his maximum intellectual poten-
 tial at his own best pace.  We have always
 agreed that the track system was less than
 adequate, but also that, by trial and error,
 it could and would be improved to the

 Around them are the crumbling ruins form of fissionable material, in the case Mr. FANNIN. Mr. President, I suggest
 -
 of primitive irrigation structures that
 can still be seen. They stand as power-
 ful reminders of vanished people-
 civil-izations that withered and died or moved
 on when the water was gone.
 The sad part of Mr. Brower's extreme
 arguments against this project is the
 fact that he makes them in the name
 of conservation.
 But let me remind my colleagues that
 true conservation in the American tradi-
 tion does not mean the preservation of
 exclusive privilege for one small group
 of citizens.
 On the contrary, opportunities for the
 enjoyment of nature and its wonders
 have been extended to virtually all
 Americans through the multiple-purpose
 concept of resource utilization.
 All of us know these opportunities
 must be expanded in light of current and
 projected population pressures on our
 available facilities. Hualapai Lake would
 be a major step in this direction.
 Given our experience with Lake Mead
 and Lake Powell, we know that Hualapai
 Lake would soon develop into one of the
 most popular attraction in the Nation.
 Lake Mead is a priceless recreational
 asset because of its proximity to urban
 centers of the most populous State in the
 union and adjacent States. With metro-
 politan concentrations growing rapidly in
 the Southwest, Hualapai Lake-like Lake
 Powell and Lake Mead today-would be
 another welcome bonanza for boating,
 fishing and camping enjoyment.
 Public response to Lake Powell, for
 example, has been amazing, when you
 consider that it began filling only 3 years
 ago and visitor facilities are still limited.
 Some 196,400 persons visited Lake
 Powell  the  first  year.  Attendance
 climbed to 303,500 the next year, and
 as  additional  accommodations    and
 marina facilities are completed, the fig-
 ures will climb steadily higher.             Al-
 ready, in the first 7 months of 1966,
 attendance is reported over the 1965
 pace.
 There is a curious anomaly in Mr.
 Brower's propaganda  which deserves
 comment.  On behalf of the Sierra
 Club, he professes to support Arizona's
 quest for supplemental water.  I might
 say that with friends like this, we do not
 need enemies.
 His ads tells us to forget the dams.
 They say : "Go ahead and build the cen-
 tral.Arizona project and use conven-
 tional steam generating plants to pro-
 vide the necessary pumping energy.  Be-
 sides, cheap nuclear power is Just around
 the corner."
 To the naive and uninformed, this
 sounds fine.  But it just is not true-
 and wishful thinking cannot change fic-
 tion into fact.
 I can assure the Senate that the posi-
 tive economic case for the dams will be
 documented, and the fallacious argu-
 ments against them exposed, as we pro-

 IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED IN FUL-
 FILLING MILITARY OBLIGATIONS
 (Mr. BENNETT 'asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. BENNETT.  Mr. Speaker, the ex-
 tensive hearings ' held by the House
 Armed Services Committee on the draft
 reveal a number of needed changes to
 permit a fairer, a sounder, and a more
 useful system than we have at present.
 Former President Eisenhower has re-
 cently pointed out that at two opposite
 ends of the manpower spectrum there
 exist two large privileged classes, the col-
 lege students with their .access to exemp-
 tions from military service and those
 considered unfit for service by the mili-
 tary authorities under their present at-
 tainments but capable of being brought
 up to usable standards.
 President Eisenhower further stressed
 the need for passing universal military
 training legislation in order to eliminate
 these deficiencies in the present system.
 Today, Secretary of Defense McNa-
 mara has announced a plan to bring up
 to standards thousands of young men
 who presently do not meet standards
 previously set but who can, by train-
 ing, be brought up to proper standards;
 and this will to a degree limit the im-
 perfections of the present draft system
 insofar as those in marginal attainment
 groups are concerned. Secretary McNa-
 mara and President Johnson have both
 addressed themselves at various times to
 the possibility of some nonmilitary util-
 ization of young manpower as a possible
 means of bringing about universality of
 service to our country when so many
 young men are actually on the frontlines
 in combat as a result of being drafted
 into the military service. They have not
 stated, however, that they have come to
 the conclusion that people should be
 drafted for civilian service as a quid pro
 quo for, being drafted into the military,
 and, of course, there would be no. equal-
 ity of `service between a frontline in-
 fantry soldier and a person who is per-
 forming - some nonbelligerent  activity
 even if a longer period of service were
 required in the latter group.
 It seems to me that the time is here
 for us to enact a universal military train-
 ing proposal that would be truly univer-
 sal among the young men of our coun-
 try, and that this provides a better
 answer to the inequities of the present
 system than any drafting for civilian
 service could possible offer. There is con-
 siderable doubt in my mind that it would
 be constitutional to draft people for other
 than military service; but, whether or
 not that is so, universal military train-
 ing would provide a fairer distribution
 of the obligations and it would have the
 additional benefit of providing trained
 manpower and classification of all. young
 men in our country as a tremendous de-
 fense backlog if the military require-
 ments of our country should substan-
 tially escalate at some time in the future.
 So, I find it very encouraging that
 President Johnson and former President
 Eisenhower and Secretary McNamara
 are all constructively thinking In this
 field; and I urge Congress to undertake
 legislation in this field at the earliest
 possible time. Frankly, I believe that the
 answer lies in the line of thinking which
 would establish universal military train-
 ing, which I have always supported and
 which I have backed by introduced legis-
 lation from time to time in Congress.
 DEDICATION OF BIG BEND DAM IN
 SOUTH DAKOTA
 (Mr. BERRY asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for :l min-
 ute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. BERRY. Mr. Speaker, in his col-
 August 23, 1966
 umn carried in the Washington Post, to-
 day, Drew Pearson cries copious tears be-
 cause Secretary of State Dean Rusk will
 dedicate the Big Bend Dam in South Da-
 kota on September 15.'
 The principal pain Mr. Pearson suffers
 comes from the fact that the Governor
 of the State of South Dakota, who is
 thank.goodness, a Republican, will be the
 master of ceremonies.
 Another stab in his side comes from
 the fact that Senator KARL MUNDT will
 be on the platform and that neither the
 Democrat  candidate  running  against
 Governor Boe or the candidate running
 against Senator MUNDT will be in TV
 camera focus.  As Mr. Pearson puts it,
 those who would like to defeat these
 officeholders will not be in the limelight:
 Is this anything new?  What is the
 function of officeholders if it is not to
 develop and then through appropria-
 tions finance, construct, and then handle
 the dedication of projects such as this?
 Mr. Pearson says:
 The Big Bend Dam was conceived under
 the Flood Control Act passed by Franklin
 Roosevelt and the money for it was appro-
 priated under Truman.
 First it should be pointed out that
 Franklin Roosevelt never passed a law-
 the laws were passed by Congress, of
 which Senator MUNDT was a very active
 Member at the time of the passage of this
 act, and much of the credit for the pas-
 sage of the Flood Control Act must go to
 Senator MUNDT, as his efforts were as
 much responsible for its passage as any-
 one.
 , Another little item of interest is that
 Senator MUNDT has served on the Appro-
 priations Committee in the Senate for
 the past 13 years and has been primarily
 responsible for getting funds for con-
 struction of all of these dams in the main
 stem of the Missouri River including the
 Big Bend Dam-just why should he not
 have an important part in its dedication?
 Who, pray tell, would have a better right?
 In further talking about the dam, Mr.
 Pearson says:
 Its origins are entirely Democratic.
 Two minutes of research by this fa-
 mous columnist would have proven to
 even him the fallacy of that statement.
 He would have discovered that I along
 with 12 other Republicans, organized in
 1938 the South Dakota Reclamation As-
 sociation, and that I served on its board
 of directors for the succeeding 6 years.
 He would have discovered that the pur-
 pose of organizing the association was to
 promote irrigation in South Dakota and
 to get Missouri River water on South Da-
 kota soil.
 Two minutes of research would have
 demonstrated that in 1940, under the
 leadership of the then Gov. Harlon J.
 Bushfield, a Republican, the Missouri
 River States Committee was organized
 with two members from each of the Mis-
 souri River States serving on that com-
 mittee, the purpose of which was to p:ro-
 mote Missouri River development for ir-
 rigation, navigation, flood control, and
 power  development.  He would have
 learned that I was named by Governor
 Bushfield as the second member of the
 delegation from South Dakota.

 Mr. ASHBROOK.  Mr. Speaker, in
 the past I have called to public atten-
 tion, by means of the  CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD, the shipping bottleneck in Sai-
 gon which was affecting the flow of sup-
 plies into Vietnam.           Mention was made
 of the efforts of Thomas Gleason, the
 president of the International Long-
 shoremen's Association and of his trips
 to Vietnam to effect needed changes.  It
 was encouraging to read in the New York
 Times of August 5 of the vast improve-
 ment in the situation.  While certain
 factions militantly oppose our efforts in
 Vietnam-the set of directions on how to
 beat the draft which I inserted in the
 RECORD yesterday is one distressing ex-
 ample-the efforts Of other Americans
 like President Gleason are indeed re-
 freshing.  Especially praiseworthy is the
 comment of Mr. Gleason concerning the
 possibility of his speedup methods pos-
 sibly being used to haunt him in future
 contract negotiations: "But the country
 gon Port Snag Is Said To Be Over," in
 the RECORD at this point:
 [From the New York Times, Aug. 5, 19661

 The shipping bottleneck in Saigon harbor
 that had threatened the flow of supplies to
 !troops in ' Vietnam  has   been  "completely
 cleared up," Thomas W. Gleason, president
 of the International Longshoremen's Associa-
 tion, said yesterday.
 Mr. Gleason, who made several trips to
 Saigon with some of his union colleagues to
 determine ways of getting traffic through that
 port faster, said some of the methods intro-

 duced might "embarrass" him in future ne-

 panies.
 The I.L.A. officials persuaded South Viet-
 namese dockmen to forgo their midday siesta
 and to accept an incentive system for speedier
 cargo unloading.   Such  "speed-up" meth-
 ods "are going to haunt me when we sit
 down for the next contract," Mr. Gleason
 said at a news conference.  "But the country
 comes first," he added.
 The news conference was held jointly with
 John Condon, United States labor attache in
 Saigon, who is completing a two-year tour
 of duty.
 While Mr. Condon praised the "unprece-
 dented type of union service" given by the
 union, he qualified the success reported by
 Mr. Gleason.
 He described the shipping bottleneck as
 "substantially" cleared up as a result of the
 "know-how" supplied by the union, and said
 the flow of cargo had been speeded up to
 "three or four times the previous rate."
 At the suggestion of the I.L.A. advisers, the
 United States furnished modern hoisting ma-
 chinery for palletized cargo and shipped a
 fleet of flatbed trucks to speed cargo from
 cluttered piers to inland prefabricated ware-
 houses for sorting and inland distribution.
 THE INCREASING COST OF LIVING
 (Mr. ASHBROOK (at the request of
 Mr. HALL) was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. ASHBROOK.  Mr. Speaker, the
 U.S. Labor Department reported today
 the national cost of living increased an-
 other four-tenths of 1 percent in July
 to a record lev?l, although goods prices
 did not climb as much as usual during
 July.  Just when and where this infla-
 tionary spiral will level off no one seems
 to know.  The following article by Ted
 Lewis in today's New York Daily News
 entitled "Question Is:  What's Ahead
 With HCL?" details the uncertainty
 which prevails in official circles concern-
 ing the months ahead.
 I insert the above-mentioned column
 in the RECORD at this point:
 [From the New York Daily News, Aug. 23,
 1966]
 QUESTION IS: WHAT'S AHEAD WITH HCL?
 (By Ted Lewis)
 WASHINGTON, August 22.-The most elusive
 cost-of-living  information in the nation's
 capital concerns what is going to happen to
 the purchasing power of the consumer dollar
 in the months ahead.
 We went down to the Labor Department
 today to try to get statistical lowdown on
 this because it seemed more important than
 what happened to `prices in July, now three
 weeks past.
 All we can report is that if any expert on
 the consumers price index has a firm opin-
 ion on price trends for the next few months,
 he prefers to keep the significant political
 and economic information to himself.
 There were a few, cagily-phrased nuggets
 of knowledge forthcoming that could sug-
 gest that the outlook isn't too good.  For
 example, Arnold Chase, assistant commis-
 sioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, ex-
 pects that the price of eggs will be lower
 later in the year.
 On the other hand, Chase believes that
 diary products such as milk and butter are
 going to remain high for awhile.  As for
 meat, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables, it
 is hard to say..  A continued shortage of
 pork is probably keeping that kind of meat
 high, but beef prices could well be stabilized
 at their present high level.
 As for the accelerated rate of medical care
 costs, there is some hope that this will level
 off when more beds are available in hospitals
 now under construction.
 Now, it would appear that marvelous com-
 puters should be available to supply some
 hard information as to what is going to
 happen next about the high cost of living.
 Isn't this the kind of guideline that house-
 wives want, not the meticulous data showing
 how living costs went up again in July-
 which surprised no one?
 What everyone wants to know is where do
 we go from here.  The only clue that was
 supplied today was the trend of the past-
 which, if continued, means more gradual
 melting away of the purchasing power of
 the dollar.
 Buried way down in the data on the con-
 sumers price index was the revealing infor-
 mation about what has happened to the
 dollar.
 In July, it was worth in terms of the dol-
 lar's 1957-59 purchasing power just a little
 over 88 cents.  In July, 1965, its value on the
 same basis was 90.7 cents.
 In terms of the 1947-49 purchasing power
 of the dollar, it was worth in July 71.9 cents.
 In terms of the  1939 dollar,  exactly 42.7
 cents.
 GROCERY BILL GOES UP AND UP
 We prefer the statistic about this offered by
 Commissioner Chase. A typical grocery bill
 of $25 a week in June increased 10 cents in
 July.  And the July cost was 68 cents more
 than the same amount of groceries cost in
 July a year ago.
 What is this consumer price index any-
 way?                                                                                                                                    Well, it covers pretty much every item
 of consequence in a family's living costs.
 It covers food bought for the home, food
 away from home  (restaurants).   It covers
 rent, fuel and utilities, household furnish-
 ings, wearing apparel, transportation, health
 and recreation costs, new cars and used cars.
 The statisticians do a good job. They even
 come up with comparable cost of living data
 for key cities in the nation.    Their basic
 finding, however, is in the national average
 category.
 These government experts do a tremendous
 job of finding out what happened to con-
 sumer prices in the past, even if they hate to
 talk about the future, except to remind that
 there are usually seasonal trends.
 For example, past experience has shown
 that food prices usually decline in Septem-
 ber.  Does that mean they will decline this
 September?  No one knows positively, is the
 response.
 COST OF  SERVICES  OUTSTRIP  FOOD  PRICE  RISE
 There is a positive effort, as displayed by
 the spokesman for the cost of living statistics
 today, to show that the average consumer
 does not have the right perspective in facing
 up to his spending programs.
 According to Commissioner Case, the con-
 sumer gets upset about the high price of
 bread but ignores the significance of other
 price rises.
 It was pointed out that a so-called "$100
 basket of consumer goods and services" rose
 $2.80 from July, 1965 to July, 1966. This may
 be hard to believe, but the biggest increase
 came in services, not in food prices.  Food
 rose 71 cents, which services rose $1.35. Other
 items accounted for 74 cents.
 What are these services that cost so much
 more and outstripped food price rises?   In
 this category are medical care, barber and
 beauty shops, domestic service, baby-sitters,
 utilities, public transportation, laundry and
 dry cleaning, movies, mortgage interest, etc.
 This is a category worth considering in
 trying to figure out how much more the cost

 employers, Union and New York State Em-
 ployment Service in order to:
 1.. Develop an  action program for local
 labor organizations in voluntary compliance
 with the State Law Against Discrimination
 and other labor laws designed to protect the
 rights of workers.
 2. Develop a community project through
 which Chemung County's labor organizations
 can demonstrate labor's collective concern
 and cooperation in dealing constructively in
 a specific area with regard to non-discrimi-
 natory  employment,  training  and  union
 membership programs.
 3. Suggest those programs, techiques and
 procedures in keeping with labor's own self-
 interest that will eliminate the aspect of
 apparent discrimination.
 Finally, there is the Goverment Relations
 'Committee.  This  committee  will  develop
 far reaching programs dealing with the City
 and  County Governments, the Police De-
 partments and the various Public School
 Systems. It will be suggested that this
 nommlttee study Civil Service policies, to
 work toward the elimination of discrimina-
 tion in these practices; to study City and
 County contracts to make certain contrac-
 tors are fulfilling a non-discrimination pol-
 icy and to recommend actions to implement
 a non-discrminatory policy.  While law en-
 forcement is properly the role of a police
 department, the responsibility of a County
 intergroup agency in cooperating with and
 aiding a police department in this,task is
 of  particular  significance. Consequently,
 this Committee will make every effort to
 achieve close contact with the police de-
 partments.  And finally, this committee will
 acquaint the Boards of Education and ele-
 mentary and high school prinicipals with
 the resources of the Commission itself, and
 will cooperate with public school officials
 on school-community relationships.
 So much for the Commission and Com-
 mittees.
 We, here in attendance should realize that
 while the government agency on the local
 level must recognize that it has a distinc-
 tive role to play, you should be aware that
 it does not have the only role-each citizen
 has a role to play also.  More than a law is
 needed to bring about the equality of treat-
 ment, the expansion of individual opportu-
 nity and the human dignity we seek for
 every citizen.  Our Commission cannot over-
 emphasize the need for the continuing aid
 and cooperation of all citizens in going be-
 yond the law to establish warm personal
 relationships based on mutual respect and
 dignity.
 You have undoubtedly read in your local
 newspaper, that the Commission assisted the
 first person who filed a housing complaint
 at the Chemung County office to obtain an
 apartment which he desired.
 I am sure that as their new neighbors
 become acquainted with this family they
 will learn to appreciate that differences of
 color are very extraneous to any judgment
 they might make as to their character and
 worth as individuals.  The Commission has
 become aware that the complainant, at first,
 was subjected to vilification.  This, in itself,
 was extremely regrettable, as I am sure that
 it did not reflect the true feelings of the
 community, but it was rather the expression
 of the warped viewpoint of a sick, lunatic
 fringe,
 It is because there does exist in any com-
 munity this fringe of fanaticism that the
 progressive people in the community must
 take steps to nullify and eliminate such ex-
 pressions of hate before they contaminate
 the thinking of other people.
 So what is our present need?  The pres-
 ent need, therefore, is to rouse from the
 lethargic concept that time will take care of
 everything and that nothing needs to be
 done to assure that the voices of well-moti-
 vated people wil be heard throughout the
 County.
 We cannot afford the easy assumption
 that an integrated community will develop
 naturally as a matter of simple, evolution-
 ary progress in the cultural history of Che-
 mung County.  It is highly necessary that
 those who have committed themselves to
 the advancement of equal opportunity and
 who have the social awareness of the need
 to provide human rights to all people be
 heard throughout Chemung County.
 I deliberately avoided describing such per-
 sons as articulate because it is my conviction
 that all of us are fully articulate and all of
 us, if we take the time and effort, can get the
 message across.  It is a sad commentary on
 the life of any community when the most
 vociferous are those who work toward anti-
 social and degrading goals, while persons who
 should know better are too often silent.
 Therefore, it is necessary that we plan to-
 gether-government,   community   leaders,
 religious leaders, labor, industry and all ele-
 ments  of  the  community  in Chemung
 County so that there be no discrimination, no
 ghettos, no racial or religious enclaves, but
 that Chemung County become a model of
 vibrantly alive, progressive, socially-balanced
 and peaceful people in the years ahead.
 To achieve this requires community plan-
 ing at all levels.  There must be in the minds
 and hearts of all people a realization that the
 equalities are truly inseparable.  It is not
 enough for Chemung County to assure to its
 residents that they will have equal oppor-
 tunity in the purchase or rental of a hous-
 ing accomodation.  There must be a similar
 assurance that all persons will have equal
 opportunity for employment and equal op-
 portunity to enjoy the facilities of its places
 of public accomodation-restaurants, parks,
 barberships and all places of amusement,
 recreation and cultural development.
 For it is not enough to recognize the rights
 of a person to buy a home or rent an apart-
 ment unless there is equal recognition of his
 right to be gainfully employed.   Having a
 home and employment, a person does not
 enjoy full equality unless his rights to the
 use of public accomodation is firmly estab-
 lished.
 Human Rights are interrelated and inter-
 dependent.  For freedom itself is indivisible.
 A person may not be one-quarter;, one-half
 or three-quarters free.  He is altogether free
 or he is not free at all.

 CHICAGO AND ELMIRA: A STUDY IN CONTRASTS
 Two reports in yesterday's newspaper ac-
 cented poles-apart approaches to a problem
 that's big today and likely to be bigger
 tomorrow.
 Chicago provided another installment in
 the continuing story of Negro rights march-
 ers being assaulted and insulted by white
 mobsters, some of whom were arrested in
 battles with police.
 Elmira reported forthcoming appointment
 of four major committees to work with the
 Chemung County Human Relations Commis-
 sion in the important areas of housing, em-
 ployment, public information and, govern-
 ment relations.
 The importance of these areas is indicated
 by the complaints of the Chicago marchers
 and the hostility with which the peaceful
 airing of their grievances is greeted by an
 admittedly small but intensely biased seg-
 ment of Chicago's white population.
 Searching studies of the Watts and other
 violent manifestations of Negro frustration
 have shown that no inconsiderable part has
 been played by communities' failure to strive
 for solutions to such problems as housing,
 employment, communication and govern-
 ment relations before 'the stage is set for
 violence.
 In announcing plans to amplify the human
 relations  commission's  work  through  the
 four committees, Philip J. Davis, the commis-
 sion's  executive  director,  told the                                                                                                                                  Elmira

 Advancement of Colored People that "wi-,h
 intelligent planning for the social as well as
 the physical advancement of this commu-
 nity, Chemung County may well become a
 model of American life for many parts of the
 nation."
 Davis' statement can be made to come
 true if the people of the community not only
 recognize the problem that exists but move,
 through understanding and awareness of hu-
 man rights, to achieve a solution.
 As it takes two sides to make an argument,'
 it takes two sides to avoid one-two sides
 willing to talk frankly and to act realistically.
 This, and every other enlightened commu-
 nity, has a chance to avoid the costly and
 hurtful situation that has put Chicago into
 the headlines.
 The way is not simple and certainly it is
 not easy.
 But it is the honest way to recognize that

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. HOWARD W. ROBISON
 or NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 8, 1966
 Mr. ROBISON.   Mr. Speaker, during
 this summer which has seen so much
 raeial violence in northern communities,
 it is a pleasure to be able to report on ad-
 vances which are being made in the field
 of equal opportunity and living condi-
 tions.
 From March 1958 to June of this year
 I employed on my congressional staff
 Philip J. Davis of Elmira, N.Y. He began
 while an undergraduate at Howard Uni-
 versity and served as a part-time file
 clerk. In the next year he also did part-
 time  work  for  then-Representatives
 William H. Avery, of Kansas, and Jack
 Westland, of Washington. On his grad-
 uation from Howard and his entry
 into law studies at that university, he as-
 sumed a full-time position on my staff as
 a staff assistant, and held this post until
 his resignation in June to accept the post
 of executive director of the Council of
 Human Relations of Chemung County,
 N.Y., one of the four counties in my con-
 gressional district.
 Earlier this month Mr. Davis made his
 first speech in his new position, address-
 ing the Elmira, N.Y., branch of the
 NAACP. I include the text of his speech,
 and an editorial from the Elmira Star
 Gazette, commenting on it:
 I feel deeply honored at being permitted
 to participate in your program today.  I
 would hope that I am here representing t e
 Chemung County Commission on       Human
 Relations, charged with the responsibility for
 advancing human rights and human dignity.
 I speak to you, therefore, as one connected
 with a county agency which is beginning to
 learn its way in the difficult and complex area
 of human relations.  I am representative
 also of a county government agency which
 does not possess enforcement powers but
 must rely on the processes of mediation and
 conflation, reinforced by the power of what-
 ever status and prestige the Commission and
 its members and staff are able to achieve in
 the community.  Some of you may wonder
 just what is human relations-It's the art
 and science of human beings relating to each
 other.  It allies one person with other peo-
 ple-in short, it's every day living with re-
 spect for your fellow man.
 We are blessed today that laws have been
 enacted by the federal government, many
 states and municipalities, guaranteeing civil
 rights to all citizens.  Laws are important!
 They place a fashionable cloak on efforts to
 eliminate discrimination.
 The passage of civil rights laws, however,
 as Winston Churchill once said in another
 context, marks only "the end of the begin-
 ning."  Unfortunately, stratification and dis-
 crimination based on color, creed and ethnic
 grouping have been embedded in our society,
 andfor so long, that it vitally affects every
 area of the American way of life.  Tape bars
 can be lowered completely at the hiring gate,
 but an employee's progress in the plant or
 factory can be seriously affected by his social
 club, his social status and his social ac-
 ceptance.
 When we are dealing with civil rights and
 human rights, it is entirely possible to obey
 the letter of the law and to violate its spirit
 Approved
 at every turn.  The stirring challenge of our
 times, my friends, is how we transcend the
 .latter and evoke the spirit.
 We, of the Human Relations Commission
 have no simple answer.  We have no easy
 answer.
 Basically, we do believe that we can only
 move beyond the letter of the law if neigh-
 bors will help neighbors do so on the local
 level.  The battle for civil rights in the fu-
 ture assuredly will be fought and won or lost
 in each individual community-in the city
 hall--in the county boards--in the courts-
 in the police department-in the schools-in
 the   churches-in   the  factories--in- the
 stores-in the homes-and yes, in the streets.
 If this be so, then the role of a human rela-
 tions agency must become increasingly im-
 portant as the struggle for human dignity
 is channeled more and more within the local
 areas. This is why we believe the momentum'
 for the formation of these agencies will con-
 tinue until virtually every community of any
 appreciable size will have its Human, Rights
 Committee or its Human Relations Commis-
 sion.
 According. to the U.S. Conference of Mayors
 a total of 264 of the 589 U.S. cities with popu-
 lations of 30,000 or more have official com-
 munity relations study organizations.
 But establishing a human rights agency,
 just like enacting a civil rights law, is at
 best only a beginning step. Translating that
 agency into a viable instrument for change
 is the important task. The task of a human
 relations agency and its opportunities have
 never been greater.
 In referring to the post civil war period,
 historian  C.  Van  Woodward  has  written,
 "Just as the Negro gained his emancipation
 through a falling out between White men so
 did he lose his rights through a reconcilia-
 tion with White men".  Thus, indeed was
 the emancipation of the Negro aborted.
 Now today, on behalf of the Human Rela-
 tions Commission, I would like to call upon
 you to join with us in helping complete that
 emancipation and bring about another re-
 conciliation.   This time, a real reconcilia-
 tion--that of Negroes and Whites and people
 of all. nationalities who live within our land.
 But let me warn you that this task will not
 be easy.
 Let us take a look at our local commission,
 thereby allowing you to gain a broader un-
 derstanding of what we are and what we are
 attempting to do and-how each one of you
 can better aid the cause.
 The Chemung County Commission on Hu-
 man Relations was created by the Chemung
 County Board of Supervisors and its very able
 Chairman, John C. Gridley, on October 14,
 1963, and the members and the Chairman
 were appointed by the Board on January 13,
 1964.  The Commission was established in
 accordance with general enabling legislation
 enacted by New York State in 1963 with an
 overall purpose of fostering mutual respect
 and understanding among all racial, religious
 and nationality groups in the county.
 The statutory duties and obligations of the
 Commission are:
 1. Inquire into incidents of tension and
 conflict  between  racial  groups  and  take
 action to alleviate the same.
 2. Receive complaints of alleged discrimi-
 nation, seek the assistance of the State Com-
 mission For Human Rights in cases within
 the State Commission's jurisdiction and to
 solve others through conference, conciliation
 and persuasion.
 8. Conduct and recommend educational
 programs to open opportunities in all areas
 of community life and enlist all groups to
 help in such programs.
 4. Hold conferences and other public meet-
 ings in the interest of constructive resolution
 of racial tensions and resulting prejudice and
 discrimination.
 There are several different ways to inter-
 pret these obligations. ; Obviously, if a com-
 mission is charged with alleviating tension
 -`1  Sol-
 A4455
 and group conflict as well as preserving
 domestic peace and tranquility, it can do so
 by attempting to strengthen the status quo;
 by discouraging members of minority groups
 from moving into houses in areas where there
 is resistance to them; by keeping large em-
 ployers satisfied by not challenging their
 right to employ Negroes only as maintenance
 workers or elevator operators; by trying to
 prevent   street   demonstrations   through
 bringing pressure on the  minority    group
 rather than through attempting to remedy
 the unfair situation which has incited the
 demonstration.  This, however, is not what
 we are in business to do.
 Our purpose is promote amicable relations
 between racial and cultural groups, coordi-
 nate activities of private groups in this field
 and aid in enforcement of anti-discrimina-
 tion laws.
 At present there are 9 Commissioners and 2
 paid staff persons, an Executive Director and
 Secretary.
 The members are chosen usually because
 they are persons of status or because they
 have been in the forefront in the human
 rights struggle as protagonists or private or-
 ganizations having a unique constituency
 and a special point of view.  Suddenly the
 Commission members find themselves sitting
 around a table considering problems jointly
 instead of being placed at opposite ends as
 adversaries.
 Instead of representing a particular group
 or cause, they must nowrepresent all the
 people.  This is not an easy or simple transi-
 tion.  It takes time and patience and wisdom
 to effect rapprochement-and understanding
 to overcome suspicion and antagonism.
 The Commission is broken down into 4
 standing committees.  Briefly I shall try to
 give you some of the activities that each
 committee will be concerned with.
 First, the Public Information Committee.
 This committee could be considered one of
 our "bread and butter" agency programs.
 The broad function of this committee is that
 of informing the larger community about
 problems and prospects in the area of human
 relations.  This committee will take the form
 of speakers bureaus, forums, basic study
 courses in human relations and ongoing con-
 sultant services.
 Next there is the Housing Committee.  The
 Human Relations Commission believes that
 there must be full access to adequate hous-
 ing for all residents of Chemung County re-
 gardless of race, creed or color, and that non-
 whites must have the opportunity to compete
 for adequate housing with full assurance that
 the deciding factors, rather than racial iden-
 tity, will be those criteria that are uniformly
 applied to any white person who is desirous
 of  renting or buying.   To this  end this
 committee will be concerned- especially with
 relocation and Urban Renewal, code enforce-
 ment, real estate, rentals and implementa-
 tion-which will be designed to further ob-
 tain compliance with housing regulations as
 defined by New York State Law and other
 law.
 Next the Employment Committee.   The
 Human Relations Commission believes that
 there must be full equality for opportunity
 for all persons in every aspect of employment
 in all of Chemung County.  To this end this
 committee will be concerned with cultivating
 wider  employment opportunities for  both
 male and female; developing resources for
 training and employment opportunities; pro-
 viding regular consultation services to em-
 ployment personnel departments both public
 and private; identifying the under-employed
 and up-grading in present jobs; developing a,
 more  effective working relationship  with
 organized  labor;  holding  regular meeting
 with guidance counsellors in public schools
 and   initiating   new  training  programs
 through existing institutions.   In addition,
 consideration will be given to sponsoring a
 Human Relations Workshop involving local

 A Reminder of Our Past
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. WILLIAM L. ST. ONCE
 OF CONNECTICUT
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, August 23, 1966
 Mr. ST. ONGE.  Mr. Speaker, in the
 August 21 issue of the New York Times,
 there appeared, a very interesting article
 concerning Fort Griswold, located at
 Groton, Conn., in my congressional dis-
 trict.  The fort is a stirring reminder
 of the brave role played by the militia-
 men of Connecticut during the American
 Revolution.
 I am pleased to call this article to the
 attention of the House, because it illus-
 trates the point that in our daily bustle
 we tend to overlook the fact that our
 cities and countryside contain numerous
 and fascinating historic sites telling of a
 proud past.  Too often we put the family
 in the car and set off for a destination
 little more enlightening than the next
 hotdog stand.
 I feel that it is not only a rewarding
 experience for citizens of all ages to visit
 our historic shrines, but by so doing par-
 ents may also fulfill the duty to instill In
 their children a knowledge and respect
 for the history of their Nation.  If this
 had been done more thoroughly In the
 recent past, we would today have a much
 better understanding and appreciation
 of our history by our younger generation.
 Mr. Speaker, under unanimous con-
 sent I insert the article referred to above
 into the RECORD.
 A  TINY  GARRISON  THAT  DEFIED  BENEDICT
 ARNOLD
 (By Bernard J. Malahan)
 GROTON, CoxN.--Every summer, thousands
 of visitors climb the steep hill to Fort Gris-
 wold State Park for a look at the historic
 stone and earth defense works.  This fortifi-
 cation was the setting of a Revolutionary
 War battle in which the British commander
 was $enedict Arnold.
 A year before, Arnold had been a com-
 manding officer in General Washington's Co-
 lonial forces.   But he fled to the British
 lines after being exposed as a traitor, and
 it was as a brigadier general in the British
 Army that he led the assault on Fort Gris-
 wold in 1781.
 STRATEGIC LOCATION
 The fort had been completed by Colonial
 militiamen in 1778 to help defend -the stra-
 tegic  coastal  area on  the  Thames  River.
 Groton Is situated directly across the river
 from New London, which during the Revolu-
 tion served as a home part for the privateer
 ships that constantly harassed the British.
 Benedict Arnold's raid on Fort Griswold
 took place In the closing months of the war.
 Its primary, although unrealized, objective
 was to divert General Washington, who was
 massing his forces at Chesapeake Bay for a
 siege of Yorktown.
 With a fleet of more than 30 ships and
 a force of about 1,700 men, Arnold entered
 New London Harbor on the morning of Sept.
 6, 1781.  He formed his troops into two divi-
 sions.                                                                                        One of them, under his direct com-
 mand, overcame the New London defenses
 and burned some 130 buildings before night-
 fall, destroying the town.
 The other division, with approximately 900
 men,  fought  its  way up  the  heights  in
 Groton to attack Fort Griswold.   Defending
 this stronghold were about  160 men,    in-
 eluding hastily summoned militiamen and a
 small garrison force.
 Twice the British were repulsed. They had
 lost two of their ranking officers and 191 men,
 when, according to an eye-witness who re-
 corded the details in his diary, "a luckless
 shot cut the halyards" of the Fort Griswold
 flag.  The British, believing the flag to have
 been struck by the defenders, rallied, charged
 again and gained entry to the fort.
 Col. William Ledyard
 commander of th
 ,
 e
 Colonial troops, ordered his men to lay down

 onel Ledyard and asked, "Who commands
 this fort?" Ledyard replied, "I did, sir, but
 you do now," and, in the traditional

 Political Realities and Educational Needs
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. EMILIO Q. DADDARIO
 OF CONNECTICUT
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, August 18, 1966
 Mr. DADDARIO.  Mr. Speaker, for
 many years now, the Federal Govern-
 ment has provided funds to support
 much basic and applied research at this
 Nation's educational institutions.  We
 have reason to be proud of the achieve-
 ments which the science community has
 made but we cannot afford to rest on our
 laurels.  Science is a dynamic and. con-
 stantly changing field of intellectual
 pursuit requiring our continuing con-
 fidence and support.
 In the August 19 issue of Science
 magazine we are reminded of our duty to
 oversee the equitable and efficient dis-
 tribution of research ' and development
 funds to our many advanced educational
 centers.  We must be responsive to the
 existing political realities of the present
 and future and to the vast and complex
 educational needs which confront us.
 In doing so, it is important to note that
 the same Russian scientists who shocked
 us into a massive buildup of our scientific
