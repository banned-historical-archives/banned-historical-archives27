 JAMES SCHMSINGER
 Late  in 1971  James  R.
 Schlesinger, his wife, Rachel,
 and two of their children made
 headlines by roaming around
 a barren, uninhabited
 island-Amchitka, in the Aleu-
 tian chain off Alaska's coast.
 They were trot there to pur-
 sue   Schlesinger's h o b b y:
 bird-watching. Their mission
 was to prove to skeptics that it
 was safe to inhabit an area
 where the U.S. government
 had just exploded the largest
 underground  nuclear  blast,
 known as "Project Cannikin."
 ?A determined man who acts
 out his convictions, the
 43-year-old native of New York
 City now moves into another
 controversial area, b Lit one
 that produces few headlines:
 intelligence network.
 -Chosen by President Nixon
 today to succeed Richard M.
 / Helms as director of the Cen-
 tral Intelligence A g e n c y,
 Schlesinger will be giving up
 the post of chairman of the
 Atomic Energy Commission.
 In taking the intelligence po-
 .sition, Schlesinger will have
 an opportunity to act out some
 of his ouvji conclusions about
 the ' way that job should be
 run.

 administration  -  assistant
 director of the Budget Bureau

 named the Office of Manage-

 JAMES R. SCHLESINGER
 Accomplished In  1971  the
 changes streamlined budget-
 ing procedures and, more im-
 portantly                                              concentrated  the
 process of coordinating and
 assessing intelligence data in
 the hands of presidential ad-
 viser Henry A. I issirger and
 his aides in the While H(Ase.
 The reorganization gave the
 director of Central Intelligence
 full  budeetin  responsii)ility
 for all of the intelligence serv-
 ices-enhanced authority
 which Schlesinger himself pre-
 sumably now inherits.
 Created Post
 Perhaps by coincidence, a
 former colleague Of Schlesin-
 ger's at the Hand Corp. "think
 tank" in California-Andrew
 \I. Marshall-is the member
 of Kissinger's National Securi-
 ty Council staff most con-
 cerned with coorclinatitng intel-
 ligence matters.
 Marshall's post, as head of
 the "Net As essment Group,''
 within the NSC staff, was cre-
 ated by Schlesin ger's reorgani-
 zation plan.
 Schlesinger had joined the
 Nixon administration in Fcb-
 rltary                                          116t),  pr inlarily as a
 budget-watcher. His main as-
 signment was to oversee  the
 Petlta'ion's blld etlug proce-
 dures, during a period
 military spending was easing;
 is reputed to have showirti e
 Pentagon in one year how to
 trim $6 billion out of its budg-
 et.
 Although much of his profes-
 sional and governmental life
 seems to have involved nation-
 al security in one way or an-
 other, he also has a reputation
 for being sensitive about envi-
 ronmental issues.
 Ecology Stand Tested
 His  friends  recall  that,
 among   his other activities
 within the government, he per-
 suaded the administration to
 reverse itself and to allow the
 Taos Indians to keep their
 sacred Blue Lake lands in
 New Mexico.
 The chairmanship of AEC
 tested his devotion to ecology.
 Although environmental orga-
 nizations  strongly criticized
 his full support for the Am-
 chitka atomic blast, they have
 praised his stand on the so-
 called Calvert Cliffs case.
 Pressed by the atomic ener-
 gv industry to a )peal a federal
 court decision ordering the
 AEC to act much more ab
 t re.:sively to protect the envi-
 ronment, Schlesinger refused,
 choosing to obey the court.
 file chairman also has taken
 the position that it is not ap-
 propriate for the AEC to pro-
 mote atomic energy, or to esti-
 mate how much nuclear power
 the nation ~,cill need. Instead,
 it has been his policy to have
 the agency develop energy op-
 tions that the public may de-
 cide to use as it wishes.
 Trained as an economist,
 Schlesinger  was  graduated
 summa cum laude from Par-
 v2rd in 1P5n. After a year's
 travel in Europe on a fellow-
 ship, he returned to Harvard
 to take a doctorate in econoni-
 ics.
 Taught at Vii-inia
 After, that, lie taught eco-
 nomics  at the University of
 Virginia,  and hey*an concen-
 trati;n,g oil the budgetary side
 of rational security and dC-
 fense policy. Ile wrote a book
 titled "Tile Political Economy
 of National Security."
 In part as a result of the
 book's favorable notice among
 experts is the national s:acuri-
 ty field, Schlesinger was of-
 fereci the job at Rand in Santa
 Monica  which  carried out
 much of the defense estiblish-
 ment's computer-based analy-
 sis of defense systems.
 While at Rand, Schlesinger
 headed a study of nuclear
 Ft r in S    proliferation,    and
 worked on a study of the role
 of "systems analysis" in polit-
 ical                                                                                                      decision?makir.,.    That
 work brought h;rn to the atten-
 tion of the Nixon r,dnli:listr::-
 tion's new budget staff in the
 early days  after the Prc~!i-
 (lent's inauguration.
 Durin=g then time in \'; ash-
 ington, the Schlcsingers have
 avoided much of the city's so-
 cial life. Schlesinger is said to
 dislike cocktail parties.
 He is a Republican and a
 Lutheran.
 Mrs. Schlesinger, the former
 Rachel Mellinger, is a gradui
 ate of Radcliffe. 'llicy have
 eight children-four daughters

 How purely-military judgment can miscarry even from
 a stratveje, standpoint is all too sharply illustrrtc.d by
 the bo)-ilbing of I:doith Vietnam that was authotired.
 ?I)uring his first week in office in January 3.959, presi-
 dent Nixon asked the eight key military -And civilian
 a.f;envies of the Government concerned with the Indo-
 china. yyar what could be achieved by mining hlaipbong
 and other ports and resuming the bombing of North
 Vi(llrlam, which had been halted three months earlier.
 The Joint Chiefs of Staff mid the American military
 command, in Saigon replied that: the effect on the war
 would be decisive if previous restrictions ware removed
 oil the bombing of overland transport from China. But
 giro C.I.A. and the Office of the Secretary of Defense
 (O.S.I).) challenged the military estimates,
 As summarized by the Kissinger staff in the then-secret:
 National Security Study 7,4ernor.: ndun, No. 3. (N S.S.Iri.-])
 in .February 1.959, the C.I.A. and O.51). s ,,id that "the
 overland routes from China alone, could provide North
 i(:-,tnaann with enough material to carry on, even with
 .an unlimited bombing campaign.."
 other kinds moving from China' .  lough supplies have
 got through for new Connaur    Offensives in the ,next
 six weeks---including one in the Mekong J)elta south of
 Sai~,on-if Hanoi decides to launch t:heni.
 Ple nnystc;~y is why a.rnything other than tl:is should
 have been expected. As the N.S.S.Ivi. I ,tardy pointed out,
 ll-nost four years of air war in Not IL Vietnam have
 hown---as did the IS:orean vvar--that, although Jr astrikes
 will destroy transport facilities, eq!u pment and supplies,
 they ca;nnot successfully interdict tine [mtcrlandj flow of
 supplies because much of the damage can frequently be
 repaired within hours."
 That these facts, known since. 1h99, were disregarded
 is bad enough. What Would be even worse;. would bw con-
 tinuing illusions that the minin  and. bcnii;ins' night
 force Ilanoi to accept  negotiated defeat. A compromise
 political settlement, which involves a sharing or division
 of power in South Vietnam, is the one way to cod a war
 that neither side can win on the battlefield.
 J
 'three years ltiter, on May e, 1972, President Nixon
 disregarded the C.I.A.-O.S.U. judgment, which was sup-
 ported by an impressive array of facts, and took the ad-
 vice of the military, who evidently argued that "smart
 bombs" and other new techniques would make even
 more certain the success they predicted in 1969.
 For four months now, the ports have been closed by
 mines and a massive bombing campaign has been tinder
 way. Indications that the Communists' war effort was
 not being impeded have been countered with the asser-
 i ;ion that several months would be required before the
 interdiction campaign began to pinch. Petroleum sup-
 plies, which came by Soviet tanker overseas and had to .be
 pumped ashore, were said to be particularly vulnerable.
 These predictions now have been exploded by two
 separate intelligence studies. The C.I.A. and the I'enta-
 g all's Defense Intclligence Agency have both concluded
 that the blockade and bombing, after four months, have
 had relatively feeble results.
 The Communists have built three four-inch petroleum
 pipelines-which are hard to hit and can be rapidly re-
 paired--south from the Chinese border to the Hanoi area
 and another from Hanoi to the southern tip of North
 Vietnam and beyond, into the Ashau Valley of, South Vi-
 etnam. Ant-like tactics of rapid repair of damaged rail-
 ways. and bridges have,also ki;pt. adequate supplies of

 Ti:) its critics, the JCS is a pondc-
 xous, ineffective anachronism de-
 scribed  this . way,  "The  courts
 meditate, Congress deliberates, and
 the Joint Chiefs bicker."
 Nevertheless, the Joint Chiefs are
 increasing their influence, playing a
 stronger role in U.S. policy than
 they have for years.
 And paradoxically this is happen-
 ing in an atmosphere of tarnished
 military image, disaffection over de-
 fense spending, and continued rec-
 .otlllnellclations for reorganization of
 the JCS machinery.

 At the top, they are asked to he
 master diplomats, politicians, and
 advisers to the President at the
 same time they are burdened with
 more  narrow, responsibilities  as
 leaders of their individual services.
 Bicker, they have. In the '30's the
 admirals. and generals feuded over
 aircraft carriers versus bombers.
 The Army and Air Force fought
 over control of ballistic missiles, the
 Army contending the new weapons
 were a new generation of artillery,
 the Air Force' viewing them as un-
 manned planes.   ?

 The National Security.Act, which
 became  law  25  years ago, has
 been described' as  "perhaps the
 most far-reaching measure in its
 effect upon the role of the mili-
 tary in American life since. the for-
 mation of the Navy Department in
 .1798."
 1.y bringing the three branches
 of the armed services together in
 a  single  department,  the  act,
 signed ' into law July 26, 1947, by
 former President Harry S, 'Tru-
 man,  aimed  to  eliminate              inter-
 service  duplication and                 rivalry.
 But it also had the unintended side-
 effect of profoundly altering the
 process  of  formulating  U.S. for-
 eign policy.
 la addition to creating a na-
 Jtional military establishment, later
 to  become the Defense Depart-
 ment, the National Security Act
 set  up  three  bodies  that  have
 grown  in  importance  over   the
 years. The Joint 'Chiefs of Staff
 was an outgrowth of the Combined
 Chiefs of Staff set  up   by the
 { United States and Great Britain
 early in World War II. It was.giv-
 en the responsibility of preparing
 military plans, reviewing over-all
 military requirements,, and  direct-
 ing unified and specified. combat
 commands.
 Over
 and  above  the
 National
 Military
 Establishment,
 the  act
 provided
 for a National
 security
 Council
 "to advise the
 President
 with respect to the integration. of
 domestic, foreign, and military pol-
 icies relating to the national secur-
 ity,"  with the specified  duty to
 "assess  and  appraise  the  objec-
 iives, commitments and risks of
 the United States in relation to our
 actual and p,o t e n. t i a l military,
 power."
 It is this same National Security
 Council from  which  presidential
 advisor Henry Kissinger operates.
 Kissinger's influence in arrapiging
 and  guiding  President  Nixon'
 through a complex round of inter-
 national  conversations                                                          on  both
 sides of the Iron Curtain, all ap-
 parently being strongly related to
 the security of the United States,
 has provoked a measure of domes-
 tic debate, but most recent polls
 show  that  the president  has  a
 comfprtable majority  of   citizens
 who approve policy changes stem-
 ming from the world wide, jour-
 ney's.
 Kissinger, who is now in South '
 Vietriarn on a mission for Presi~
 dent Nixon after several secret
 sessions' with  North  Vietnamese
 negotiators in P?aris, has become
 the target of some crii;~ici'sm in.
 liberal n'iedia circle and in some
 discreet rumbling within the State
 Department, where some feel he
 has usurped traditional State De-
 partment power.
 Finally, 'the  act established  a.
 Central Intelligence Agency. CIA
 was to "correlate and evaluate in-
 telligence relating to the national
 security," , but was to  "have no
 police, subpoena, law-enforcement
 ? . or internal security functions.'.'
 It remained for Robert S. Me-
 .Namara, Secretary of Defense un-
 der President's John F. Kennedy
 and Lyndon B. Johnson from '1961
 to 1968, to utilize to. the full the
 powers inherent in the National
 Defense  Act.  While  McNamara.
 found the basic structure of the
 Defense Department to he "entire-
 ly sound," he nevertheless insti-
 tuted a number of changes. In 1961
 the Tactical Air Command. and the
 .Strategic Army Corps were placed
 under the direction of the U.S.
 Strike Command. The communica-
 tions and intelligence branches of
 the three military services were
 merged, and plans for streamlin-
 ing of procurement of arms and
 equipment were instituted.
 "Despite its awesome power and
 the worldwide sweep of its activi.
 ties, the basic, mission of the De-
 partment of Defense is s i in p l y
 stated," McNamara wrote in 1968.
 "The mission is military security;'
 or more broadly, to maintain a
 constant  readiness  the  military
 forces necessary to protect the na-
 tion'from attack, keep its commit-
 ments  land  support  the                                                                                              foreign

 support of foreign policy.
 Some' critics argue that the De-
 fense Department has a hand in
 shaping foreign policy, too. Discus-
 sion of contingency plans by Penta-
 gon. and military planners of for-
 eign countries, C. Merton Tyrrell
 wrote in 1970, "have tended to di-
 minish the role of the State De-
 partment, and place the Depart-
 of Defense in the quasi-official po-
 sition of `suggesting' foreign policy
 action." The CIA and the National.
 Security  Coi'   f?  likewise  have
 chipped away at State Department
 policy-making powers. For better
 or worse, the National Security Act
 has had   consequences that Con
 gress could not foresee 25 years
 ago.
 With the concentration of U.S.
 and foreign. military data that must
 have been. stored up during the
 past 25 years in an agency that
 reaches deep into both military,
 and foreign policy decision making,
 and with both foreign and domestic

 wonder that the ssecurfiy agency,

 ith the exception of the President,
 no one in the Nixon Administra-
 tion has been more publicized
 than Henry  Kissinger, Nixon's
 National Security Affairs adviser.
 Yet Kissinger does not work alone.
 He heads a `staff of 110 including mes-
 sengers, secretaries, researchers, and
 brairitrusters,  all  self-effacing,  hard-
 working men and women, nerve of them
 'known to the public.
 Of late, however, one of Dr. Kissin-
 ger's loyal' arid intrebid band of devoted
 slaves has begun to surface.
 Mark his name carefully: Maj. Gen.
 Alexander Meigs I laig Jr.
 At 47, Al Haig is tall, blue-eyed, and
 more  handsome  and  sex-appealing
 than  secret agent  Kissinger whose
 deputy he is.
 Soft-speaking and tactful, subtly am-
 bitious with just the right amount of
 ruthlessness, Al Haig is second in com-
 mand at National Security Affairs. He is.
 Henry's "gute rechte hand" (good right
 hand).
 Checks on Vietnam
 It is he who holds together the dedi-
 cated "low profiles" who work for Kis-
 singer while. Henry cavorts in strange
 and foreign lands. It is through him that
 the, mountain of position papers on
 Vietnam, the Middle East, the Soviet.

 Union, South Africa, and ad infinitum is
 funneled. And it is he, without fanfare
 or publicity, who wings off to Vietnam
 every six months or so, to assess first-
 hand for the President how things are
 really going.
 Last month Haig returned directly to
 San Clemente frain his eighth "trip to
 Southeast Asia and briefed the Pres-
 ident on conditions in Vietnam and
 Cambodia. He was then trotted out
 on a non-attribution basis to the press,
 which described him as "an uniden-
 tified, high-ranking source."
 Although Al f-laig has spent the past
 27 years in the Army, "my entire adult
 life," he neither looks nor behaves like
 a military prototype. He is not obdu-
 rate or parochial. There is no rigidity to
 .his mind, which is open and inquiring,
 or to his speech, which is academic and
 articulate.
 Haig could very well be faken for a
 college professor or a diplomat, which
 in a sense he is. For diplomacy is cer-
 tainly a requisite in getting on. with
 taskmaster Kissinger whose tolerance
 quotient is low and personnel turnover
 high.

 to the swank Bistro restaurant, one of
 Kissinger's favorite restaurants in Bev-
 erly Hills, along with actress Sally"Kel-

 Dobrynin,.and a flock of screen colony
 Probable inheritor
 Should anything happen to -Henry;
 like being appointed Secretary of State,
 or being incapacitated by one of his
 scorned. girlfriends, Haig most probably
 would inherit Kissinger's job.
 Although  philosophically Kissinger
 and Haig see eye to eye--both are con-
 .servatives~-Haig as foreign affairs ad-
 viser. to the President, would certainly
 avoid the spotlight Kissinger, by his na-
 ture, attracts.
 To begin with, Haig is a happily-rnar-
 ried,-chu'rch oing Roman Catholic.
 Son of a lawyer, he was born in Phila-
 delphia,  attended  parochial  grade
 school in Cynwyd  on the Main Line,
 moved up to St. Joseph's Prep and
 studied two years at Notre Dame before
 his appointment to West Point came
 through in 1944.
 His brother, a priest, is president of
 Wheeling College in West Virginia, and
 his sister,- Regina Meredith, an attorney
 in Pennington, N.J.
 Like many young men, Al. Haig set-
 his eye on a service academy appoint-
 m--nt because it was a financial neces-
 sity. "My father died when I was 10,"
 he explains, "and I had pretty much to
 fend for myself in terms of economics.
 I had newspaper routes, worked for the
 Post Office, the Atlantic Refining Com-
 pany. I even worked as a floorwalker in

 The White House Military Situation Room also
 operates under the aegis of Dr. Kissinger. It is
 here the military evaluations and strategies are
 formulated for the President's decision. The super-
 strategist Kissinger frequently. overrides the re-
 commendations of the four-star generals and ad-
 mirals of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 Where did Kissinger acquire all of his military
 expertise? Certainly his Army career in World
 War II was somewhat mediocre as a staff scrgealit,
 and his brief career as a very junior reserve officer
 after the war. Since he never even comniancled a
 squad; how could. he acquire matured military
 judgment?
 1-1 1,     he resigned his reserve commission as
 a-captain in the Military Intelligence. In his resig-
 nation letter, Reserve Captain Kissinger had the
 audacity to say that he was quitting because of
 "pressure of other obligations and the conviction
 that I can be of greater service in a high rank in
 case an emergency necessitates this step." The
 U.S. Ariny was happy to get rid of hint.

 !Commie
 much nationalist as
 (May 20, 1949).
 Reviewing  the  record  of  American
 intervention in Indochina in the Penta-
 gon Papers, one cannot fail to be
 struck  by the  continuity of basic
 assumptions from one administration
 to the next.. Never has there been the
 slightest-, deviation from the principle
 that a noncommunist regime must be
 imposed and defended, regardless of
 popular sentiment. The scope of the
 principle was narrowed when it was
 conceded, by about., 1960, that North
 Vietnam  was  irretrievably  "lost."
 Otherwise, the principle .has been main-
 tained without equivocation. Given this
 principle, as well as the strength of the
 Vietnamese  resistance, the  military
 power available-to. the United States,
 and the lack of .effective constraints,
 one can  deduce    with  precision the
 strategy of annihilation that was gradu-
 ally undertaken.
 On May 10,. 1949, Dean Acheson
 cabled US officials in Saigon and Paris
 that "no effort [should] be spared" to
 assure the success of the Bao Dai
 government, since there appeared to be
 "no   other   alternative   to.  estab
 [lishmcnt] Coinmie pattern Vietnam."
 Ile further urged that this government
 should be "truly representative even to
 extent  including   outstanding  non-
 Commie leaders now supporting Ilo."
 A State Department policy statement
 of the preceding September had noted
 that the Communists under Ilo Chi
 Minh had "captur[ed] control of the
 nationalist movement," thus impeding
 the  "long-term  objective"  of  the
 United States: "to eliminate so far as
 possible Communist influence in Indo-
 china."We are unable to suggest any
 practicable solution to the French, the
 report continued, "as we are all too
 well aware of the unpleasant fact that
 Communist Ho Chi Minh is the strong
 est and perhaps the ablest figure in
 Indochina and that any suggested solu-
 tion which excludes him is an expedi-
 ent of uncertain outcome." But to
 in May, 1967, - Assistant Secretary of
 Defense John McNaughton presented a
 memorandum which the Pentagon his-
 torian                                           takes to imply a significant
 modification of policy toward a more
 limited and conciliatory position. The
 Saigon   government,   McNaughton
 urged,. should be moved "to reach an
 accommodation   with   the   non-
 Communist South Vietnamese who are
 under the VC banner; to accept them
 as members of an opposition political
 party, and, if necessary, to accept their
 individual participation in the national
 government . . ."- (Gravel Edition, Pen-
 tagon Papers; vol. IV, p. 489).'.,Exact-
 ly Acheson's proposal of eighteen years
 earlier, restricted now to. South Viet-
 nam.
 In a summary of the situation after
 the T?t offensive of 1968, Leslie Gelb,
 director of the Pentagon 'study, asked
 whether the US 'can "overcome the
 apparent fact that the Viet Cong have
 `captured' the Vietnamese nationalist
 movement while the GVN has become
 the . refuge of :-Vietnamese who were
 allied with the French in the battle.
 against the independence of their na-
 tion" (II, p. 414). His. question ex-
 pressed                                           the dilemma  of the  State
 Department twenty years before, and
 properly so. The biographies of Thieu,
 Ky, and Khiem indicate the continuity
 of policy; all served with the. French
 forces, as did most of the top ARVN
 officers. "Studies of peasant attitudes
 conducted in recent years," the Penta-
 gon historian informs us, ".`have demon-
 strated that for many, the struggle
 which began 'in 1945 against colonial-
 ism continued uninterrupted through-
 out Diem's regime: ? in 1954, the foes
 of nationalists were transformed from
 France and Bao Dai, to Dien and the
 US ... but the issues ? at stake never
 changed" (1, p. 295). -
 Correspondingly, the Pentagon con-
 like Diem's,2 and substantial segments
 of the urban intelligentsia-"the people
 who  count,"  as Ambassador Lodge
 once put it (II, p. 738)=-now speak out
 against US intervention.
 A National, Intelligence Estimate of
 June, 1953, discussed the gloomy pros-
 pects  for. the "'Vietnamese  govern-
 ment" given "the failure of Vietnamese
 to, rally to  [it]," the fact that the
 population ? assists the Viet Minh more
 than the French, the inability of "the
 Vietnam leadership" to mobilize popu-
 lar energy and resources, and so on (l.
 p. 391f.). With hardly more than a
 'change of names, this analysis.nnight be
 interchanged With the despairing report
 from. US pacification advisers (MAC-
 CaRDS) on December 31, 1967, de-
 ploring  the corruption. and  growing
 weakness  of  the  GVN,  the "ever
 widening gap of distrust, distaste and
 disillusionment between the people and
 the GVN.      With. these words, the
 record 'of US-GVN relations . in the
 Pentagon Papers ends (II; pp. 406-7).
 One may, perhaps, argue that the
 mood of the South Vietnamese counts
 for less in the war than it did in earlier
 years, now that the US has succeeded,
 partially  at least, in  "grinding. the
 enemy  down  by  sheer weight and
 mass" (Robert Komer, II, p. 575), and
 now  that North  Vietnamese  forces
 have increasingly been drawn into the
 war, as a direct and always anticipated
 consequence of American escalation.
 In   November,  1964,    Ambassador
 Maxwell Taylor argued that even if we
 could establish an effective regime in
 Saigon, to  attain  US  objectives it
 would not suffice to "drive the DRV
 out of its reinforcing role.". Rather, we
 will not succeed unless we also "obtain
 its cooperation in bringing an end to
 the Viet Cong insurgency." We must
 "persuade or force the DRV to stop its
 aid to the Viet Cong and to use its
 directive powers to make . the Viet

 Several present and former FBI
 ;,rants are savinw privately that
 they  suspect  that  J. Edgar
 Hoover died from an overdose
 of sleeping tablets. But they add that the exact
 cause of his death can't be determined without
 an autopsy. And Dr. James Lulke, D.C. Coroner,
 has adamantly refused to conduct an autopsy.
 The FBI men say: "Regardless of whether Mr.
 Hoover committed suicide or died from a stroke
 induced by hypertension: there is one thing for
 sure: Jack Anderson drove Mr. Hoover to his death
 --the same as Drew Pearson drove Jim Forrestal
 to his death."
 Jack Anderson, a legman for Pearson for 23
 years became his successor as the Nation's fore-
 most muckraker. For the past two years Anderson
 has conducted a continuous, unrelenting campaign
 of harassment and vilification against T. Edgar
 Hoover. Anderson's gumshoe operatives shadowed
 Hoover, snooped in the trash can at his home,
 checked on the food he ate and the medicines he
 was taking; Anderson also purloined investigative
 reports from the confidential files of the-FBI and
 publicized them with critical commentary.
 Hoover fumed and raged, but he seemed im-
 potent to do anything about it. Anderson carried
 on his savage personal attack against Hoover with
 official impunity. Even when Anderson filched the
 C--super-secret reports on the brief Pakistani-Indian
 War from the files of White House's National
 Security Council and the FBI was ordered to in-
 vestigate this flagrant breach of national security
 the culprits were not apprehended. Under a re-
 organization Executive order all Federal intelli-
 gence agencies-including the CIA and the FBI-
 must work directly under Dr. Henry A. Kissinger,
 White House Chief National Security Adviser.
 Since then, the flow of classified documents to
 Anderson have increased in volume. He seems
 to enjoy complete immunity from prosecutive
 action..
 Hoover was terribly frustrated with this brazen
 security breach but there was apparently nothing
 that he could. do. Did hoover become a prisoner
 in his own Bureau? Did the F131 that he had.
 created in a 45-year strenuous effort turn into a
 Frankenstein? Some conservative-oriented former
 FBI men believe that this is true.
 The FBI men's analogy between Drew Pear-
 son's vicious personal campaign against Forrestal
 and Jack Anderson's virulent personal campaign
 against Hoover is significant. In 19-IS ):lines V.
 Forrestal, the first Secretary of the Department
 the Jewish occupation of Pale
 up of the Arab world against the U.S.
 Ironically, Forrestal had been the Vice Presi-
 dent of the Jewish international banking firm,
 Dillon, Read & Co. And Forrestal was planning.
 to soon return to the firm, but he put duty to his
 country   above  self-aggrandizement.  Forrestal
 exerted every effort to persuade President Truman
 not to recognize Israel, but in vain-Truman suc-
 cumbed to the temptation of political campaign
 gifts from American Zionists.
 In their vengeance, the Zionists selected Drew
 Pearson to lead the vicious campaign to destroy
 Forrestal. The Anti-Defamation League of the
 B'nai B'rith assigned David Katz (alias Karr),
 former by-line writer for the Communist Daily
 Worker, and Andrew Older, member of the Wash-
 ington, D.C. Communist newspaper cell, to the
 Pearson staff to assist in the vilification campaign,
 against Forrestal.
 The Zionists furnished Pearson cash funds to
 hire Gentile undercover gumshoe operatives to
 shadow Forrestal clay and night, check on his
 personal life and the lives of his wife and son.
 F,orrestal's personal correspondence and office
 files were stolen and published by Pearson in his
 syndicated column and in his hews broadcasts.
 Pearson published not only half-truths but pure
 unadulterated falsehoods about Forrestal. When
 a Pearson aide remonstrated that an article that
 Pearson wrote about Forrestal was not true, Pear-
 son replied: "The end justifies the means." Colum-
 nist Westbrook Pegler accused Pearson of writing

 driving Forrestal to his death.
 Shortly before his own death, Pearson wrote in
 his diary: "After Forrestal's death I suffered from
 insomnia. I was haunted with the thought that
 maybe Pegler was right-maybe I did drive For-
 restal to his death. I felt an almost compulsive
 urge to join Forrestal in death."
 At the time of Forrestal's death in 1949, some
 Washington insiders did not believe that Forrestal
 actually committed suicide. Forrestal was incar-
 cerated as a patient under guard high in the tower
 of the Bethesda Naval Hospital. A Chief Naval
 Petty Officer was stationed outside the door of
 his room.
 Forrestal tied several sheets together, fastened
 them to his bed and climbed out the window

 trying to escape to a room below. Anyhow, he

 doubts expressed about ARVN's ability
 to stand alone. Four military agencies
 .(US MACV, CINCPAC, JCS, and the

 warned against "a too hasty with-

 further and said progress "has been

 gamble, as the reader will see, was
 either to buy off Moscow and Peking

 Four years ago Richard Nixon was just*
 where he is now on Vietnam, i.e., on
 the brink of a-wider conflict. He didn't
 think the war could be won, but didn't
 want to lose "leverage" by saying so in
 public. His one hope., his "secret plan"
 for "an honorable peace,". i.e., for
 snatching political victory from mili-
 tary defeat, was to shut off Haiphong
 and bring about a confrontation with
 the Soviet Union. This is exactly where
 he-and we-are today. After all the
 years of costly losses, all he offers is a
 In the tense moments at the White

 visit with Soviet Ambassador Dobryn-

 cordial, and pleasant. There were lots
 of smiles all around and the President

 A Discussion
 STATINTL
 The publication of "confidential" materials has inevitably given rise
 to a debate concerning a number of different but related problems:
 To what extent do the revelations contained in the documents throw
 light on events or policy decisions with which they deal? To what ex-
 tent, if at all, does the publication of the information contained in the
 documents jeopardize the processes of ,-executive  decisionmaking?
 Ilow can the conflict between the public's right to know and the ex-
 ecutive's need for confidentiality be reconciled? The editors of the Po-
 litical Science Quarterly have in tu: past published a number of arti-
 cles dealing with the issue of access to governmental information and
 the terms on which that access is made available, notably, Adolf A.
 Berle',; and Malcolm Moos's reviews of Emmet John Hughes, The
 Ordeal of Power (PSQ, LXXIX, June' x964) and Theodore Draper's
 review of Jerome Slater, Irttcn'ention and Negotiation: The United
 States and the Dominican l:evohttion (PSQ, LXXXVI, March -1971).
 The recent publication of the Pentagon Papers has given the contro-
 versy new urgency. U.S. Senator George McGovern of South Dakota,
 candidate for the Democratic party nomination foi president, and
 Professor John P. Roche, from 1966-6S special consultant to President
 Lyndon Johnson, were asked by the editors of the Political Science
 Quarterly to',review the Pentagon Papers and to debate in print the
 political and legal issues to which their publication has given rise.
 Publication of the Pentagon Papers has raised a storm concerning
 the right of the press to publish classified government documents.
 But the contents of the papers are so sweeping in their disclosures
 of official suppression of the realities in Vietnam, so revealing
 of the disastrous, secretly conceived policies and practices which
 led us into this tragic war, that it is impossible---in fact it misses
 their true significance--to discuss them in such abstract terms.
 The integrity of our democracy is profoundly involved, not
 only in the constitutio::-1 sense with respect to the warmal:i ng
 power, but in the basic sense of the reality of government by pop-
 ular rule. It is axiomatic with us that a free people can remain
 free only if it is enlightened and informed. It is axiomatic with
 us, as well, that a free press is essential to the creation and main-
 tenance of an enlightened and informed people. A press which

 Intelligence reports predicted an attack in Feb-

 It's difficult to run a war from the banks of the

 the decisions are made in Washington, the blame be-

 .Makin  Hanoi Dependent on Pelr.in.g '
 Interdiction: The Last Big Bluff?
 By Allen S.
 Having gone to the Chinese Wall, Presi-
 dent Nixon is going to the brink. At least he
 so declared in his May 8 address ordering
 that "rail and all other communications [to
 North Vietnam] will be cut off to the maxi-
 mum extent possible." If seriously imple-
 mented this threatens war with China. If not
 implemented the mining of North Vietnam-

 accomplish little except to make Hanoi

 urged the mining of Haiphong as early as
 1965, However, its futility was revealed in
 the recent "leak", of national security study
 memorandum number one; provided Janu-
 ary 21, 1969, at the request of Henry Kissin-
 ger for the new administration. The Central
 ? Intelligence Agency stressed Hanoi's ability
 to receive what it needed from China; were

 of the more essential imports  could be
 brought into North Vietnam over rail lines
 or roads from China in the event that im-
 -ports by sea were successfully denied .
 the uninterrupted capacities of the railroad,
 highway and river connections with China
 are about 16,000 tons per day."
 At this point, the Joint Chiefs finally con-
 ceded  the difficulty of interrupting the
 routes from China, noting "a minimum of
 6,000 sorties" per month would be required
 against the two rail lines from China. Even
 at this level of effort, the North Vietnamese
 could continue to" use the rail, lines to shut-
 tle supplies if they were willing to devote
 sufficient manpower to repair and trans-
 shipment operations."
 The Joint Chiefs failed to add that China
 had supplied such manpower, beginning in
 1965, when it sent 50,000 People's Liberation
 Army troops, primarily engineer and con-
 struction divisions,, to keep supplies moving
 across the border. Defended against U.S. air
 attacks by Chinese antiaircraft units, these
 forces not only repaired rail and road facili-
 ties as soon as they were damaged, but built
 a huge storage area in the northwest, near
 the Chinese border. Additional access to this
 vicinity is provided by a newly built road
 across northern Laos from southern China,
 currently defended by up to 20,000 Chinese
 Troops and antiaircraft.

 trip to Peking, he cannot expect Mao Tsp-
 tung to duck this challenge now, when it
 was met forcibly in 1965-68. Whenever U,S.
 aircraft strayed, Chinese radar tracked their
 movement, usually accompanied by MIG ef-
 forts at interdiction. Peking did not always
 announce the intrusions and even kept one
 of the shootdowns secret, but Washington
 knew that actions spoke louder than words.
 Neither side wanted a public confrontation.
 Fortunately President Johnson was deter-
 mined to avoid the final escalation:
 Few persons within government and none
 outside knew. how close questions of "hot .
 pursuit" and attacks on Chinese bases made
 war with China an issue in 1965 and again in
 1967. Today similar secrecy insulates Presi-
 dent Nixon and Henry Kissinger from the
 probing of Congress and the press If the
 White House is to he believed, the risk of
 war with China is high. How else can we
 "keep the weapons of war out of the hands
 of the international outlaws of North Viet-
 nam"? Since 1966; China has supplied most
 of the hand-held weapons to North Vietnam
 and the National Liberation Front (NLF).
 Eighty per cent of the ammunition and 60
 per cent of.the weapons seized in Cambodian
 caches during the 1970 invasion came from
 Chinese arsenals. All have since been re-
 placed by Peking. Nothing Hanoi needs in
 the next six months is beyond China's capac-
 ity to supply.
 Does the President think that by making
 Hanoi dependent on Peking he has better
 leverage on the battlefield or at the peace
 table? This runs counter to all evidence and.
 logic, There is no known instance when the
 North Vietnamese deferred to Chinese ad-
 vice contrary to their own judgment. If any-
 thing, Hanoi has defied Pekilig in its con-
 duct of the war as welt as in its willingness
 to talk in Paris. Nor is there the slightest in-
 centive for Peking to play Washington's
 game, while the disincentives are vital to
 Chinese perceptions of their own role in
 Asia as well as to the credibility of commit-
 ments elsewhere, from North Korea to Al-
 bania.
 Regardless of Peking's public pronounce-
 ments or its rumored reactions to the new
 escalation, its private support for Hanoi can-
 not be questioned. The U.S. mining and in-
 terdiction by sea of supplies to North Viet-
 nam provides China with a virtual monopoly
 of influehee in the induchina war. Its influ-
 ence will prolong the fighting toward the
 ultimate, perhaps imminent, defeat of the
 U.S. allies in Laos, Cambodia, and South
 Vietnam. This Chinese policy is dictated by
 ideology, by national interest, and by power
 politics. This policy risked war with the U.S.
 in ' 1965-58 when America had more than
 500,000 troops on the Asian mainland, but

 In Washington, Nixon met with his
 military advisers:  Admiral Thomas
 Moorer, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
 of Staff, Secretary of State William Rog-

 and his recently named deputy Kenneth
 Rush. Meanwhile Henry Kissinger con-

 Administration spokesmen insisted
 that the President was "keeping his op-
 tions open." In fact, the options were
 limited. Nixon ruled out any pause in
 troop withdrawals; he will announce the
 next phase sometime before May I,
 when the U.S. troop level in Viet Nam
 dips below 69,000. The President also
 directed that the 6,000 U.S. combat
 troops currently stationed in Viet Nam

 his confidence that the situation was un-
 der control by leaving for Key Biscayne
 in midweek.
 An Umbrella. The one option that
 was available was air power, and Nix-
 on made the most of it (see page 39).
 For the first time since 1968, four air-
 craft carriers were on station in theTon-
 kin Gulf; a fifth, the Midway, was on
 its way. Also sent to the area were a
 squadron of F-105 Thunderchicf fight-
 er-bombers and. about 20 B-52s, which
 joined the 80 already operating from
 bases in Thailand and Guam. Later, two
 squadrons of F-4 Phantoms flew to Da-
 nang from bases in Okinawa, Japan and
 Korea. The additions meant a jump in
 U.S. air strength in Indochina within a
 week from 450 to 700 planes.
 Meanwhile Nixon, in effect, ordered
 a resumption of the unconditional
 bombing of the North. The invasion
 across the DMZ, he charged, had shat-
 tered the so-called "understanding"
 under which Lyndon Johnson had or-
 dered the bombing halt in 1968. (The
 North has never admitted acceding to
 it.) f=or a "limited duration," which

 rOR better or worse, the Army of the Republic of Viet
 Nam (ARVN for short) holds the key to the success of Pres-
 ident Nixon's Vietnamization policy. Expert opinions are
 strongly divided on whether ARVN can sustain that policy. Re-
 flecting the cynical view of more than a few American G.Ls
 who have returned from combat'in Southeast Asia, one U.S.
 military adviser last week complained: "The colors in the
 South Vietnamese flag are certainly appropriate--most of
 the people are yellow, and the rest are red."
 By and large, though, American advisers believe that
 ARVN is a competent and rapidly improving fighting force.
 Since shortly after the 1968 Ter offensive the South Viet-
 namese armed forces have been expanded from 730,000 men
 to 1,100,000. ARVN has become the second-largest military
 machine in Asia, second in size only to China's 2,700,000-
 man People's Liberation Army. Counting the People's Self-
 Defense Force, the volunteer militia, South Viet Nam has
 nearly 2,000,000 men under arnis. The main fighting force
 consists of 587,000 men, including 492,000 in ARVN (in elev-
 en combat divisions), 13,000 marines, 40.000 sailors and
 42,000 airmen. It also includes 513,000 Regional and Pop-
 ular Force troops, who are assigned to guard the country's
 towns and villages and reinforce pacification efforts.
 The South Vietnamese armed forces are among the best
 equipped in the world-at least for conventional warfare.
 The U.S. has provided ARVN with 640.000 N1-16 rifles, 34.000
 M-79 grenade launchers, 40,000 radios, 20,000 quarter-ton
 trucks and 56 M-48 tanks. The air force has 200 A-1, A-37
 and F-5 fighters, 30 AC-47 gunships and 600 transport, train-
 ing and reconnaissance aircraft. Despite supch impressive fig-

 the White House ordered up a kind of
 pre-emptive public relations strike that
 emphasized Communist villainy. Ad-
 ministration officials pressed the view
 that South Viet Nam had been the vic-
 tinm of a flagrant `:`invasion" from the
 North; they also emphasized the ene-
 my's ample Soviet hardware.

 stance, the U.S. fighting force had more than 3,000 in 1969.
 Three years ago, ARVN was primarily engaged in rural
 pacification programs, while U.S. troops handled most of
 the "search-and-destroy" missions. Since then a, number of
 ARVN divisions-notably the Hue-based Ist-have acquired
 a good deal of combat experience and acquitted themselves
 with honor. Nonetheless, the army still has several large un-
 solved problems. The educational level of the troops is low
 -most ARYN privates are barely literate. Leadership, par-
 ticularly at regimental and battalion levels, is erratic.
 ^
 U.S. advisers make two general criticisms of ARVN: it is
 not flexible enough to defend the country properly, and it
 tends to get bogged down in bureaucracy. When ARVN took
 over the U.S. firebases south of the DMZ, the locations and
 even the names remained the same, which meant that the
 North Vietnamese did not even have to worry about chang-
 ing their artillery coordinates.
 Furthermore, a call for artillery support from a belea-
 guered ARVN field commander must pass through a tortuous
 chain of command extending from the district commander
 through the civilian province chief to the divisional com-
 mander and finally to the appropriate artillery battalion. Be-
 yond this, ARVN's divisions are of sharply uneven quality,
 and its best units are apt to be in the wrong place at the
 wrong time. Last week the crack 1st was resting in Hue
 while the bungling 3rd bore the brunt of the early fighting.
 In a purely military sense, most U.S. strategists believe
 that Vietnamization will succeed. "It is inconceivable that
 the South can't hold out against the North Vietnamese," a se-
 nior Rand Corp. analyst observed last week. "They are just
 too good and well-equipped an army for that-unless the
 North Vietnamese are all Prussians and the South Vietnam-

 hole dug by the blast and continued on

 What were the North Vietnamese
 really up to? There were few clues from
 the Communists: Mme. Nguyen Thi
 Binh, the chief Viet Cong negotiator in
 Paris, spoke conventionally of over-
 throwing "the repressive regime of Sai-
 gon" and establishing a "government of
 national concord." All that intelligence
 officers know for sure is that Hanoi has
 planned a five-phase offensive for 1972.
 The first two phases, described in cap-
 tured documents as terror in the coun-
 tryside and attacks on militia outposts,
 began after the Tel holidays last Feb-
 ruary. Evidently, last week's offensive
 began Phase 3: an effort to pin clown
 South Vietnamese forces where they are
 weakest, inflict casualties, and discredit
 Vietnamization. The final phases are at-
 tacks on major cities (quite possible)
 and a general uprising leading to the
 fall of the Thieu regime (farfetched).
 In opening a multi-front offensive,
 as they seemed to be doing last week,
 the Communists could whiplash the
 ARVN command by reducing the pres-
 sure in one region, only to step it up sud-
 denly in another. The idea would be to
 force reserve units to move and thus to
 weaken vital areas. Saigon last week was
 all but stripped of its reserves; even the
 presidential palace guard was sent north
 to the action.

 for Hanoi. Most likely, the Washington
 speculation goes, a way would be found
 to allow the North Vietnamese to save
 face, and thus not feel obliged to re-
 turn to the battlefield later on.
 That is a highly wishful scenario,
 and it would be extraordinary if the
 North should follow it. Washington tra-
 ditionally has inclined toward optimism
 in its thinking about the war. In Sai-
 gon, however, the prevalent opinion is
 that the current offensive is not the de-
 cisive thrust, but is aimed mainly at pun-
 ishing ARVN and pushing it back from
 the border sanctuaries that the Com-
 munists have carved out over the past
 two years in Laos and Cambodia. With
 the reconstruction of the sanctuary net-
 work completed, and with the war-
 weary regimes. in Phnom-Penh and
 Vientiane all but on the ropes, the North
 Vietnamese are turning their attention
 to South Viet Nam again. The imme-
 diate goal is not to topple Thieu in
 1972, but to begin to rebuild the weak-
 ened Viet Cong and otherwise prepare
 to act on the day when the Americans
 and their airpower are really gone.
 Only then would Hanoi enter what
 it might consider, after 26 years of
 struggle, a "decisive" battle for Saigon.
 For as Ambassador Bunker frequently
 reminds dinner guests, the North Viet-
 namese have never given up hope of
 achieving a military victory.

 seem to think that the offensive, how-

 Within a month or so, monsoon rains
 will make movement and resupply dif-
 ficult in most of the country. But in Mil-
 itary Region I, where logistical support
 via the DMZ and Laos is relatively easy,
 the Communists could make trouble for
 a much longer time. President Thieu be-
 lieves that the Communists may try to
 seize South Viet Nam's two northern
 provinces and use them as bargaining
 chips to force a negotiated settlement
 of the war.
 Shock Waves. If Huc falls, the NVA
 might conceivably set up a "provisional
 government" of the long dormant Na-
 tional Liberation Front and the Viet
 Cong in the old capital. Washington be-
 lieves that Hanoi will settle for a few
 "spectaculars"-perhaps the temporary
 occupation of a city or two-to embar-
 rass Nixon and Thieu and perhaps force
 the U.S. to begin talking seriously about
 the Communist seven-point peace plan,
 which includes dumping the Thieu
 regime.
 But what if ARVN and its air sup-
 port hold fast and thwart the spectac-
 ulars? What if the Communists move
 back to their horder sanctuaries with-
 out having inflicted a massive defeat?
 If that happens-and Washington is be-
 ginning to think optimistically of the
 prospect-North Viet Nam would have
 lost more than it did in Tet 1968. That
 furious onslaught created psychological
 shock waves in the U.S. and led to the
 beginning of American disengagement.
 From a military viewpoint, the post-Tel
 counterattack by U.S. and ARVN troops
 was a considerable success: it virtually
 shattered the Viet Cong infrastructure
 and pushed main-force NVA units be-
 yond South Vici Nam's borders.

 eventually be." In the first six days of the offensive. the North
 Vietnamese shot down five U.S. aircraft and two South Viet-
 namese aircraft. One American-manned HH-53 helicopter
 crashed while on a rescue mission.
 The stepped-up tempo of the air war was reflected last
 week in the frenzied activity on the ground. "We're working
 double shifts to keep the planes ready to roll," said Staff Ser-
 geant John Macy, a crew chief at Danang.
 When a flight of four Phantoms lands on the twin I0.000-
 f I. runways, the planes quickly.taxi to rows of protective con-
 crete revetments. Once a plane is safely parked. the pilot
 climbs out and is handed a cold can of Budweiser. While he
 sips the brew, a yellow forklift truck trundles tip with ar-
 maments, and the ground crew hurriedly rearms the Phan-
 tom with an awesome array of weaponry-iron bombs, rock-
 ets and napalm canisters. Normally, the entire operation takes
 only 20 minutes. The beer never gets warm before the pilot
 climbs back into his Phantom to take off on another sortie.
 The Sea War: Barrages and Boredom
 During the first stages of the North Vietnamese offen-
 sive, gunfire front the U.S. destroyers that patrol the Tonkin
 Gulf succeeded in turning back 300 Communist troops from
 an atempled crossing of the song Ha River. Shortly before
 the Navy became engaged in the battle for Quang Fri prov-
 ince. TIME's Saigon Bureau Chief, Stanley Cloud, was a guest
 aboard one of those destroyers. There lie ivas able to ob-
 serve a vital but underreported U.S. contribution to the war:
 HE U.S.S. Buchanan, a guided missile destroyer, rolls gent-
 ly in the waters of the Tonkin Gulf, 5.000 yards offshore
 of the Demilitarize(] Zone. Overhead, a full moon slips in
 and out of wispy tangles of cloud. Crew members who are
 not needed to tire the guns or run the ship are down in the
 mess deck watching Jane Fonda in Barbarella.
 One of the Buchanan's two automatic five-inch guns, with
 a maximum range of twelve miles, is trained to starboard. A
 voice rasps over the ship's loudspeaker: "Stand by. Mount
 52. Two salvos." Five seconds later, the gun shreds the night.
 A pale orange flame shoots from the muzzle, and a 70-lb.
 shell whistles through the air en route to a target more than
 three miles inland from the Vietnamese coastline.
 In the pilot house, the officer of the deck watches the
 flight of the projectile on radar. Then a second round is fired.
 "Bore's clear," comes the voice on the loudspeaker. "Next tar-
 get is Number 17." So it goes until 5,30 the next morning,
 when 200 rounds of the Buchanan's "H and 1" (harassment
 and interdiction) fire will have been spent on 25 targets in-
 side the DMZ. Another night in the U.S. Navy's long war off
 the coast of Viet Nam has ended.
 U.S. Navy destroyers first began patrolling the Tonkin
 Gulf in 1961, and providing gunfire support for troops on
 the ground in 1965. Largely because the small North Viet-
 namese Navy has steered clear of combat, ine naval war has
 been consistently overshadowed by American fighting on the
 ground and in the air. The major exception occurred in Au-
 gust 1964. when two American destroyers, the Maddox and
 the Turner Joy. reported that they had been attacked in the
 gulf by North.Vietnamese torpedo boats. The incident, whose
 authenticity is still in doubt, led directly to passage by Con-
 gress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Which Lyndon John-
 son used as authority for massive U.S. intervention in the
 Viet Nam War.
 ^
 Last week, for the first time in two years, the ships that
 have been daily pounding the coast drew return lire from
 shore-based Communist artillery. One round hit the U.S.S.
 Lloyd 771o11zc1s. inflicting minor damage and injuring three
 crewmen.
 Normally, though, war ahoard the Buchanan and other
 destroyers is an impersonal war. The chief ingredients are ra-
 darscopes, computers, control panels, microswitches and ra-
 dios-plus movies in wide-screen color. The only time the
 ammunition is touched by human hands is when it is loaded
 into the automatic hoist. Deep in the bowels of the ship, Fire
 Controlman Second Class Jim Fagan of Miami holds the por-
 table trigger in his hand, nonchalantly squeezing the lever
 when he gets the signal over his headphones. "I don't feet
 like I'm part of this war," says one sailor. "I never see what
 we're shooting at. or whether it does any good."
 In the style of Admiral Zumwalt's "New Navy," officers
 and enlisted men alike sport beards, waxed mustaches and
 hair long enough to have put them on report three years
 ago. The chief disciplinary problems are drug abuse and ra-
 cial tension. though in scope they barely match similar prob-
 lems suffered in the Army. Boredom is pervasive. As one
 Buchanan sailor puts it: "1 sometimes go topside and stand
 at the rail. watching the moon on the water. I just stand
 there for hours like some damn U.S.O. ad."
 It bothers many of the sailors that they are fighting a pas-
 sive, unseen enemy. "We've been shooting at the same place
 for seven years," says one radarman. "By now, the Viet Cong
 must have the area roped off and posted with signs that say,
 'Keep out, the ship is firing.'  Still, unlike the ground units
 in South Viet Nam, the Navy is not setting an immediate
 course for home. "When they talk about the U.S. withdraw-
 ing from Viet Nam," says a chief petty officer, "they don't
 count the Navy, because we're not in the country. I figure
 we'll be staying around a while."

 WASIIINGTON _ In the basement
 of the White House there is an area
 full of reassuringly modern communi-
 cations equipment that its known to
 its inhabitants as the Situation Room.
 In the middle of the complex there is
 a small conference  room  insulated
 from the surrounding commotion by
 paneled walls. It was to this room
 that Henry A. Kissinger summoned
 Presidentt. Nixon's senior advisers ast
 week, and their mood was as
 and serious as the news clattering
 over the teleprinters outside.
 he Nn,it.h Vietnamese had moved
 across the demilitarized zone (DVIZ) to
 launch massive, coordinated attacks on
 South Vietnamese strongholds, thereby
 putting the  Vietnam  war  precisely
 where Mr. Nixon did not want it-
 back on page one-and raising an
 ominous challenge to the President's
 -election-year hopes,
 By the end of the week the South
 Vietnamese seemed to have softened
 their  resistance.  Nonetheless,  there
 was little  question that the enemy
 al.tacks had severely shaken tine Ad-
 ministration, confronted Mr,                                Nixon's
 military advisers with hard choices
 and caused his political strategists to
 w,iestioO nis three-year effort to en-
 f;:ir.er an American withdrawal from
 Vietnam by Election Day without si-
 multaneously sacrificing; Vietnam to
 the enemy.
 Most analysts here saw the offen-
 sive as an all-out effort to discredit
 the  Viet.namization  program, shatter
 South Vietnamese morale, weaken Mr.
 Nixon's hold on public opinion at home
 and force him, to offer more gener-
 ous terns if and when the suspended
 peace negotiations resume in Paris.
 Asked on Monday what the Presi-
 d     ould do to Help South Viet-
 t w
 oraeref tnem to oegin-was well away
 from the scene making a speech and
 shaking hands in Philadelphia.
 As devised by the Special Action
 Group in conjunction with the United
 States commanders in Vietnam, the
 massive  air  strikes  Thursday  and
 Friday went well beyond the concept
 of "protective reaction" used by the
 Administration to justify earlier retal-
 iatory raids.
 Mr. Laird, speaking for the Adminis-
 tration while the President rested and
 conferred with Mr. Kissinger in Key
 Biscayne, said the bombing would con-
 tinue until * Hanoi withdrew its tanks
 and troops. Admiral Moorer said the
 planes were bombing targets up to 40
 to 50 miles north of the DMZ. Other
 sources said the "upper limit" would
 probably be the 20th Parallel, about
 200 miles above the DMZ and about
 70 miles south of Hanoi.
 In domestic political terms, the pres-
 ent round of fighting may yet prove
 to be acceptable, Much depends on
 how long it lasts. If the South Viet-
 namese show themselves capable of
 mastering what Is clearly their sternest
 test in a year, it would strengthen the
 credibility of Mr. Nixon's withdrawal
 strategy.
 But if the South Vietnamese fail to
 stem the tide, even with American air
 power to help them, or if the attack
 appear.
 If this idea were to take root, Mr.
 Nixon's speeches about a "generation
 of peace" might begin to sound hol-
 low. And his inability to shed an old
 commitment could make him yet an-
 other political casualty of the Vietnam

 ization. It would seem to many to be
 an abandonment not only of Mr. Nix-
 on's pledge to find an "honorable" so-
 lution in Vietnam but his outit! oft-stat-
 ed concerns about the "credibility" of
 America's pledges overseas.
 The President's withdrawal program
 has reduced American forces in South
 Vietnam to 95,000 men-including only
 6,000 or so ground combat troops-
 and , indications have been that the
 number would drop to 35,000 by Elec-
 tion Day. Reintroduction of ground
 troops at this point would have enor-
 mous political impact. It would amount
 to a public vote of no confidence in
 the South Vietnamese and an invita-
 tion to a renewal of sharp domestic
 dissension over Vietnam.
 The President spent most of Mon-
 day                                                      on  the  phone-with  Admiral
 Thomas H. Moorer, chairman of the
 Joint Chiefs of  Staff, with Melvin
 Laird, his Secretary of I)efense, and
 with William P. Rogers, his Secretary
 of State - receiving estimates of the
 fighting  and debating the alterna-
 tives. In the end he won support
 for his own tentative decision that if
 the fighting worsened the United States
 should seek to 'stem the enemy of-

 The President assigned the task of

 cern and preparing the public for re-

 creating a sense of panic and failure
 in the White House itself.
 The solution, devised in morning
 huddles among Mr. Ziegler and his
 counterparts at Defense and State, Dan
 Henkin and Robert McCloskey, was to
 impose on State and Defense the bur-

 Washington
 Washington may soon know if it has
 critically underestimated  the military
 strength and political punch of the North
 Vietnamese..
 If it has, a shift in President Nixon's
 three-year-old Vietnam war strategy could
 well follow.
 Administration officials have consistently
 predicted harassing attacks by the Com-
 munists in 1972, but not debilitating or
 even seriously embarrassing ones.
 Administration spokesmen indicate a be-
 lief that the North Vietnamese "invaders"
 are apparently intending to hold onto the
 land they have seized.
 The North Vietnamese force, according
 to the Pentagon, is comprised of conven-
 tional ingredients such as "tanks, heavy
 artillery, antiaircraft fire, engineers, and
 fresh supplies."
 Bornbing jab discounted?
 At the White House, the Washington Spe-
 cial Action Group was summoned for the
 second day in a row to advise the President.
 The administration continues to discount
 the possibility that U.S. ground forces will
 be used, but White House officials .will not
 say so publicly and explicitly.
 Instead, the official position is that, "all
 options" are open to the United States. One
 extreme one that could be under considera-
 tion is bombing of North Vietnam as far
 north as Hanoi. However, such action has
 generally been felt as unnecessary and
 likely to jeopardize the U.S. goals at the
 Moscow summit meeting in May.
 The panic button has not been pushed at
 the, White House. But there is admitted un-
 certainty and concern that North Vietnam
 will, at the very least, hold on to much of
 the territory it now has overrun south of the
 demilitarized zone.
 Massive U.S. air support for reinforced
 South Vietnamese can prevent a rout of
 Saigon's  forces,  administration  officials
 maintain. Whether U.S. air power can lead
 the South Vietnamese soldiers and refugees
 back into lost territory is a larger question.
 Too busy for theorizing
 Administration officials are too busy try-
 ing.to bail out of the present military situa-
 tion in northern South Vietnam to engage
 in such theoretical speculation.
 They may soon be faced with .further
 frontal-attacks by the North Vietnamese in
 the central highlands, and farther south.
 Henry A. Kissinger, the President's ad-
 viser for national security affairs, said as
 recently as Feb. 9 that North Vietnam "ap-
 pears to be concentrating, especially in the
 area of the central highlands, but perhaps
 also for high-point activities, as far south
 as the delta."
 A year ago, after North Vietnam's in-
 cursions into Laos, the White House ac-
 cepted intelligence estimates that the North
 Vietnamese were no longer in a position
 to interfere with the Vietnamization pro-
 gram-the strengthening of the South Viet-
 namese to go it alone eventually.
 At that time, it is understood, the White
 advised that Hanoi had been shaken to-the
 House was
 core.
 It was felt that the North Vietnamese could mount
 momentary spectaculars, but could not continue a pro-
 tracted war if they did.
 Administration officials warn against jumping to
 conclusions while the battle situation remains so murky
 in South Vietnam.
 Until the North Vietnamese came swarming across
 the border last weekend, the Vietnam issue in domes-
 tic politics was subdued. California Congressman Paul
 N. McCloskey Jr. (R) had abandoned a futile race
 against Mr. Nixon in the GOP primaries.
 The continued insistence by administration officials
 that withdrawals from Vietnam will continue on sched-
 ule has given war critics less room for new criticism.
 But this may not hold for long.
 While the North Vietnam offensive was in its fourth
 day, Senate Democratic leader Mike Mansfield op-
 posed "countering the North Vietnamese attack with
 huge bombing attacks which will only mean more
 planes shot down and more Americans falling into
 Communist captivity." He added that "we must get
 out, lock, stock, and barrel."
 McGovern : `two choices'.
 Sen. George McGovern's first reaction to the new
 Hanoi initiative was that he had "predicted two years
 ago that if we continued on Mr. Nixon's Vietnamization

 in South Vietnam by introduc-

 Renewed Bombing of
 North Among Steps
 Being Weighed
 By BERNARD GWERTZMAN
 Speriai to Tkr New York T!mes
 WASHINGTON, April 3 -
 The  United  States  accused
 Hanoi today of 'launching an
 "invasion" of South Vietnam
 and said Washington was leav-
 ing open all retaliatory- options
 ,--including renewed American
 bombing of North Vietnam.
 The justification for such
 strikes - if they are ordered
 was provided by the State
 Department,  which  charged
 North Vietnam with "flagrant
 ';violations" both-of the 1954
 treaty ending the French Indo-
 china war and of the                  1968
 understanding that led to the
 end  of  systematic American
 bombing of North Vietnam and
 the start of what were to be
 substantive talks in Paris.
 Spokesmen  for  the White
 House, the State Department
 and the Defense Department

 said.
 Attack Expected, Ziegler Says
 It was evident that despite
 the crisis in South Vietnam,
 the Administration was seeking
 to avoid giving an impression
 of undue concern. Mr. Ziegler
 referred several times to the
 current fighting as "the South"
 Vietnamese operation" and said
 that the attack by North Viet-
 nam had been expected. "Now
 i that it is beginning, our posi-
 tion is to evaluate it day by
 day," he said.
 He cautioned newsmen again
 matting any "assumptions at
 this time" on what would be
 done,  because,  he  said,  the
 President wants "all options
 open."
 Mr. Ziegler and the Defense
 Department spokesman, ' Jerry
 W. Friedheim, said that the
 American withdrawal of troops
 from South Vietnam was con-
 tinuing on schedule despite the
 increased fighting. Mr. Nixon
 has said that troop strength
 would be reduced to 69,000 by
 May 1 and has promised a new
 troop reduction announcement
 before then. Mr. Ziegler said
 that this plan was unchanged.
 The spokesman also said it
 was highly unlikely that any of
 thb six United States combat
 battalions remaining in Viet-
 nam would be engaged in the
 ground operations. They are
 committed. to guarding United
 States installations.
 In answer to questions, Mr.
 Ziegler also said that American
 air power would be used as
 necessary to aid South Viet-
 namese forces in combating
 enemy  forces  within  South
 Vietnam.

 The Paris talks on Vietnam

 has  returned to the    United
 States.  Mr.   McCloskey  said
 there were no plans for Mr.
 Porter to return soon to Paris.
 He will confer with Mr. Nixon
 later this week.
 Mr. McCloskey also said that
 one factor in the United States
 decision to suspend the talks
 had been the build-up of enemy
 forces for the expected attack
 against   South   Vietnamese
 forces. He said that the United

 resented at the table in Paris said that this was the most
 along with Hanoi and Wash-
 ington. The United States also
 asserted that it had an "under-
 jstanding" from Hanoi that the
 North Vietnamese would not
 violate the demilitarized zone
 and would not shell cities in
 South Vietnam.
 The  United  States  also
 claimed the right to fly recon-
 naissance missions over North
 Vietnam. Hanoi hasnever ac-
 knowledged that it agreed to
 any restraint., and began in 1970
 to shoot at these planes. This
 in turn led to American air
 strikes against antiaircraft em-
 placements and other military
 targets in orth Vietnam.
 Theoretically, under the Ame
 icans' interpretation, the abrog-
 ation of the 1968 understanding
 culd justify a resumption by
 the United States of systematic
 bombinb of North Vietnam.
 Time Limit Suggested
 Such a course would lead to
 increased tensions with Hanio's
 allies, such as the. Soviet Union
 and China,  and might even
 endanger the chances for suc-
 cess of Mr. Nixon's trip to
 Moscow set for May 22.
 It could also lead to unfore-
 .seen political problems in this
 country, with Vietnam again
 becoming a major divisive is-
 sue.
 For these reasons, it seemed
 likely tha, barring very large
 North Vietnamese incursions,

 A senior Pentagon official said
 privately that he thought Pres-

 North Vietnam of those enemy
 units that have crossed the

 'days into Quangtri, South Viet-

 President Nixon spent most

 his top aides. He met with

 What yesterday's height-
 ened expressions of official
 concern indicated, however,
 was that U.S. planners nev-
 e r t h e l e s s                                    understirnated
 the  military-political risks
 that North Vietnam was pre-
 pared to take in attacking
 directly through the politi-
 cally sensitive Demilitarized
 Zone  dividing  North  and
 South Vietnam. This is what
 appeared to surprise at least
 some  U.S.  planners,  and
 which the official reaction
 yesterday registered.
 The international implica-
 tions of this thrust through
 the DMZ were still unclear
 yesterday, in part because
 the full scope of the Com-
 munist offensive is not yet
 discernible.
 If  U.S.  planners  have
 greatly  miscalculated the
 power that North Vietnam
 and the Vietcong can bring
 to bear in the weeks ahead,
 some U.S. officials privately
 conceded, that could have

 The Washington Post recently published
 news of a National Security Council rccom-
 mendation that the existing secrecy policy
 in Executive Order 10501 for safe-guarding
 national defense information he reissued in
 a new order. Measures currently imposed to
 keep Congress and the people from know
 what the Executive branch is doing Wound
 be continued.
 We can all be thankful for the opportunity
 to-explore this subject with the President
 and express our own views. Excessive se-
 cibcy has developed into one of the most
 critical problems of our time The court
 cases and other events of 1971 show that the
 more secret the Executive branch becomes,
 the  more repressive it becomes. It has al-
 ready adopted the practice of honoring its
 own secrets more than the right of a free
 press or the right of a citizen to free s lt:ech.
 The NSC "final draft" revision, as o1T)-
 twined by The Washington Post. claims that
 an Executive Order is required to resolve a
 conflict between (a) the right or citizens to
 be informed concerning the activities of the
 government and (b) the need of the govern-
 ment to safeguard certain information from
 unauthorized disclosure. Of course, that sine
 ply is not true. The Constitution J id not cre-
 atg and does not now contain a basis for any
 such conflict. The interests and the power of
 the people are paramount in this country.
 The only conflict about this matter is the
 President's failure to recogilize the citizens'
 rights and ask Congress for legislation, in
 ,addition to existing law, tltlt would provide
 the protection he wants for information
 bearing on the active defense of this nation.
 The information could be called National
 Defense Data. A specific definition for the
 data could be similar to the one already rec-
 bmmended in the report submitted to the
 President and Congress last year by the Na-
 tional Commission on Reform of the Federal
 Criminal Code. The President should take
 guidance from the fact that the Atomic En-
 ergy Act has been quite effective in con-
 trolling Atomic Energy Restricted Data with-
 out objectionable  impact on  the  citizens'
 right of access to government activities.
 if the President still insists on having an
 Executive order on the subject of safe. card-
 ing information, here are some comments
 that.could be helpful:
 1. Updating. The procedures in Executive
 Order 10501 for classifying defense informa-
 tion as TOP SECRET, SECRET or CONFI-
 DENTIAL are substantially the same as the
 Army and Navy used before WorJa War 11 to
 classify military information as SECRET or
 CONFIDENTIAL. The policy was suitable
 for small self-contained military forces. All
 of the SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL mate-
 rial held by some of the large Army posts
 could fit in a single drawer of a storage cabi-
 net. Circumstances are completely different
 today. The strength of our national defense
 is not limited to military effort. It stems
 'front the vast politico-social-industrial-mili-
 tary complex of this. country. A cornmensu-
 ? rate interchange of information is essential.
 Therefore, such Lxecutive order as the Pres-
 ident considers to be required should be rad-
 ically updated..
 2. Definition. A fatal defect of Executive lion on a great volume. of information under
 Order 10501 was the absence of a definition the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense
 of "national defense information." That com- that had originated throu;.'h the year 1945.
 partitively narrow term was an improvement As for the smaller number of items that
 over the broader terms "national security"
 should be produced in the future, deelassifi-
 and "security information" which were dis-                                                           cation by the originating authority would be
 carded in 1953. However, it is imperative practicable  and  enforceable.  Exceptional
 that the designation used be limited se- classified items, if any, sent to records repos-
 verely hich by specific definition to information i

 itself to effective control measures.             G. Privately Owned Information. It is esti-
 3. Categories. Consistent with the urgent
 need to narrow the scope of protection,
 there should be only one category of de-
 fense information. Internal distribution des-
 ignators could be used to limit distribution
 of a given item, but there need by only one
 classification marking. Experience proves
 that three classifications invite serious con-
 fusion, promote uncontrollable . overclassifi-
 cation, and reduce the effectiveness of the
 Security system.
 4. Authority to Classify. The President's as-
 sumed authority to impose a defense classi-
 sification authority since they are not classi-
 cation ought to be exercised by only a tiny
 fraction of the hundreds of thousands of
 people who are now classifying. The new
 definition and great importance of the infor-
 mation involved would permit limiting clas-
 sification authority to persons designated by
 the President and to such others as they
 might designate. (Individuals who put mark-
 ings on documents containing information
 classified by someone else do not need clas-
 fiers.) As a new procedure, anyone who as-
 signs a 'defense 'classification to material
 which does not qualify for protection should
 be made subject to disciplinary action as a
 counterfeiter.
 5. Declassification. The millions of classi-
 fied papers currently gushing forth cannot
 possibly be kept under review for declassifi-
 cation on a document-by-document basis.
 But that is no reason for perpetuating as-
 signed classifications as the NSC proposed.
 The President should take the insignificant
 risk and cancel the classification on histori-
 cal material by appropriate order. As guid-
 ance, this writer authorea DoD Directive
 5200.9 in 1958 which canceled the classifica-
 mated that at least 25`0 of the material in
 this country which bears unjustifiable classi-
 fications was privately generated and is pri-
 vately owned. The Executive order should
 specifically exclude privately owned infor-
 mation from the defense classification sys-
 tem
 .
 7. Misrepresentation  of Law.  The NSC
 draft revision would continue the existing
 misrepresentation of the espionage laws by
 warning that disclosure of information in a
 classified document to an unauthorized per-
 son is a crime. The law applies only if there
 is intent to injure the United States, with no
 reference to classification markings. Falsifi-
 cation of the law should be eliminated.
 The President could do the country' a
 great service if he would seek advice from
 Congress and others outside the Executive
 branch regarding Executive Order 10501. It
 is hoped that many concerned citizens will
 help influence the adoption of that course of
 Washington.

 A Light Checkrein On The CIA
 THE CENTRAL Intelligence
 ency                                   gets a large chunk of its
 unds through hidden channels. .
 A favorite method is for another
 agency's budget to be kited by a
 certain amount, then that amount
 is   dec1 ted   surplus   and
 transferred to the CIA.
 In this manner, only a handful of
 people know what has occurred,
 most. of them in the Executive
 branch. There is an oversight
 committee of the Senate made up
 of senior members of the Armed
 Services  and  Appropriations
 Committees, plus four members of
 the Foreign Relations Committee.
 As chairman of the Armed
 Services Committee, Sen. John
 Stennis of Miss. presides over the
 group, which is supposed to
 monitor all CIA activities. Last
 year the oversight committee
 didn't meet a single time.
 The    Foreign    Relations
 Committee members on the
 oversight panel are angry. They
 contend CIA activities around the
 world have a decisive effect on the
 conduct of U.S. diplomatic policy.
 They have taken action to by-
 .pass Stennis and to gain some
 measure of control over CIA funds,
 personnel and activities by writing
 new curbs into the foreign aid
 authorization bill.
 The bill, signed by President
 Nixon the other day, requires for
 the first time a reduction in
 military personnel working for the
 CIA in activities similar to the
 assistance and advisory groups
 now operating in Cambodia and
 Laos.
 It includes t h e`ZIA in t
 $341,000,000 ceiling on aid  o
 Cambodia and requires CIA ar s
 transfers to be counted against the
 military aid appropriation. The
 CIA  is  reported  to     have
 warehouses filled with arms at
 various points in Southeast Asia
 for distribution-to anti-communist
 guerrillas.
 The CIA will be forbidden to pay
 foreign troops - such as the 4,800
 "volunteers" in Laos -more than
 their' counterparts in the U.S.
 armed forces. The bill specifical-
 ly..places the CIA under existing
 restrictions on giving arms to
 forces in Asia.
 It will require quarterly reports
 to Congress on Cambodia and
 ,annual reports on foreign aid. CIA
 assistance will. be included in the
 totals, althpughit will probably not
 be pinpointed.
 These regulations will increase
 congressional supervision over
 shadow wars, but the language is
 not so tight as to prevent some
 circumvention, if the CIA_ is
 supported by the White House.
 The National Security Council,
 the  President's  consultative
 committee  to  which  the  CIA
 reports, has the final decision on:
 the agency's activities.
 However, the new controls
 should require the CIA to think
 twice before committing the U.S.
 to clandestine wars, as it has done
 all too often in the last several
 years.

 View from tie fudge factory
 By David K. Willis
 Washington
 It looks the same, outwardly - endless
 antiseptic corridors; subdued lighting; anon.
 ymous doors opening into hushed offices;
 the flags and the globe and the slippery
 floor of the diplomatic  entrance on C
 Street... .
 This is home to that body of men and
 women whom Franklin D. Roosevelt called
 "cookie pushers," and whom John F. Ken-
 nedy characterized as "those people over
 there who smile a lot"-the professional
 diplomatic corps of the United States.
 But the "fudge factory" (as the State
 Department has ingloriously been dubbed)
 Is not the same at all, really. To a v -i -u .
 returning after several years, it is even
 more subdued than it was in the late 'GO's.
 It feels even less in the mainstream of U.S.
 policymaking than it felt in Lyndon John-
 son's day; morale is low, and the talk of
 the building is often about what might be
 done to redress the balance.
 The thoughts come thick and fast as Presi-
 dent Nixon's party heads to Peking. Dip-
 lomats at the State Department welcome
 Mr. Nixon's initiative toward the People's
 Republic. They want to see it succeed. Some
 of them helped in preliminary staff work,
 writing papers for Dr. Henry Kissinger and
 his national security staff. And yet, even
 those officials who would normally expect to
 know the ins and outs of evolving U.S. strat-
 egy toward Peking were frank to admit in
 private conversation a few days ago that
 they did not know the exact state of play.
 It hardly.needs restating: Major Ameri-
 can foreign policy is formed and executed
 largely in the White House these days. The
 Kissinger staff, according to a late report,
 numbers 46 assistants, with 105 adminis-
 trative personnel. Both Mr. Nixon and Dr.
 Kissinger like to plan quietly-and to move
 quickly. Neither demonstrates much regard
 for the diplomatic bureaucracy. They ask it
 questions, but not for crucial policy recom-
 mendations-or so one is led to understand.
 They do not ignore it entirely, but-neither
 do they keep it informed of just who is say-
 ing what to whom when Dr. Kissinger
 makes his dramatic, secret journeys: to Pe-
 king, to Paris.
 Some diplomats,  unsurprisingly,  don't
 like it at all. No one man, or two men, no
 matter how brilliant, can cover every nu-
 ance in dealings with nations such as China
 or North Vietnam, they say. Others are
 seriously concerned with the quality of
 recent appointments to the rank of ambas-
 sador: former Treasury Secretary David
 Kennedy to NATO, for instance (consid.
 ered? by some too old, by others too inex-
 perienced); Borg-Warner's Robert Inger-
 soll to Tokyo (recognized, as a gracious
 businessman, an expert in business, but
 largely inexperienced in Japanese affairs
 b  ? ess and a    co     o Asian
 s,
 Granted, it is said, that Mr. Nixon has dis-
 liked the Foreign Service since 1954 when
 the Republicans came to power with a fistful
 of new slogans such as "massive retalia-
 tion." And Mr. Nixon was right: The pro-
 fessionals didn't like him, or President
 Eisenhower, or John Foster Dulles.. But
 those days have gone. The world has
 changed.
 Issues are increasingly complex. The bu-
 reaucracy of State and the Central Intelli-
 gence Agency does possess expertise, built
 up over the years. True, bureaucracy grinds
 slowly-and true, it needs shaking up from
 time to time: prodding, cajoling, pushing.
 Yet, by cutting State out from the crucial
 decisions, the view maintains, the White
 House runs clear and definite risks, both
 now and for the future.
 How, then, to marry professional exper-
 tise to the need of the White House to move
 fast and flexibly? One answer: the White
 House could cut in six or seven top profes-
 sional diplomats on China and Vietnam
 strategy. This could serve several purposes,
 it is said: ensure that all' policy bases are
 covered; prevent further atrophy of State,
 which is becoming more and more cautious
 about making firm  recommendations to
 Dr. Kissinger's people ("Where is Henry
 right now, while we're talking?" asked one
 source with a grin; "in Pyongyang? Could
 be ..."), thereby lowering its standing in
 the White House still more. It could even
 help prevent "leaks" from the bureaucracy
 of the kind that Mr. Nixon detests. Where
 no one knows anything, the argument runs,
 disgruntlement can lead to erroneous specu-
 lating to friendly journalistic ears; it is
 safer, paradoxically, if a few people know
 a lot.
 Professional diplomats have deep respect
 for Dr. Kissinger, and, they say, for Mr.
 Nixon's  approaches;  privately, however,
 many feel that the quality of the national
 security staff does not equal the best men
 in State. The professionals acknowledge
 that State needs to find ways to keep se-
 crets better-to show Mr.. Nixon that it can
 indeed be trusted.
 It asks for the chance.

 White Housekeeping
 By RUSSELL BAKER
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 - Dear
 Spiro:
 Have stepped out for a while. Over
 to China for a few days to see Chou
 and Mao and that strange bunch of
 Commies.  Remember?  I  told  you
 about it several weeks ago. Anyhow,
 would you be a real pal and keep an
 eye on the White House while I'm
 out? If you get hungry, all you have
 to do is pick up the telephone and
 tell the operator you want to order
 some food. Same thing if you want
 to go out. Get the operator and say,
 "I want to go out."
 She'll say some Lng-like, "Do you
 want to go bowling, or do you want
 to go to the Azores to see Pompidou,
 or what?"
 The thing is, Spiro, she has to know
 whether to order the limousine or
 the helicopter or one of the big jets,
 so don't tell her it's none of her busi-
 ness where you want to go. She is
 just trying to be helpful.
 Now about using my desk. . .
 When you sit down at the desk you'll
 ? see a lot of buttons. Whatever you do
 . , . and I really mean this, old buddy
 .. don't push any of those buttons.
 Okay?
 I mean, really, Spiro, keep your
 'fingers off the buttons, okay? We
 don't want to have any nuclear mis-
 takes. On second thought, it might
 be a good idea if you didn't use my
 desk. Get the White House operator
 and ask her to have somebody set
 you up a little desk of your own by
 the window without any buttons.
 There's a terrific view of the Wash-
 ington Monument from the window.
 If you want to be photographed for
 the newspapers there, just get the
 operator and say you want your
 picture in the papers, and she'll do
 the rest..
 About the Hot Line: If the Hot
 Line rings, pick it up and say, "Hello-
 ovich, Gospodin. Have you got bad
 news for me?" If the voice on the
 other end says "Nyet," you can quit
 worrying because they are just play-
 ing around again. If the voice says,
 "Da," you've got a problem.
 The best thing is to see if ydu can
 get hold of Mel Laird. Also it might be
 a good idea to go to the air-raid
 shelter. Pick up the phone. Get the
 White House operator and tell her you
 want to go to the aireraid shelter and
 she will arrange for you to be taken
 down there.
 Oh, almost forgot Congress. There's
 a Congress going on at the Capitol.
 A Congress is a big swarm of Demo-
 OBSERVER
 If they come around and start tor-
 menting you while you're out walking
 on the White House lawn, don't argue
 with them. Just tell them, "If you
 don't like me here, why don't you
 go back to New Hampshire?"
 If they insist on coming right on
 into the White House, just get hold
 of the operator and tell her the
 Democrats are giving you trouble and
 she'll get hold of somebody who will
 have them removed.
 Incidentally, Spiro-Congress loves
 to get messages from the White
 House. It makes them feel important,
 as though somebody still needs them.
 If you've got some spare time, Send
 them a White House message on
 something and urge them to pass an
 important new bill.
 If you want-to send a message to
 Congress, all you have to do is get
 the White House operator and tell
 her what you have in mind and she
 will. send in some message-to-Con-
 gress writers.
 I can't think of much else' that
 might go wrong before I get back,
 although there's a possibility that a
 certain fast-buck roofing contractor
 will drop by and give you that line
 about how he was working in the
 neighborhood and just happened to
 see some loose shingles around the
 White House chimneys and thinks
 you ought to have him go up there
 and see if you don't need some roof
 work done. What he does then is go
 up there wearing hob-nailed boots and
 kick holes through the tar paper,
 which I then have to pay him to
 patch up. If this character takes ad-
 vantage of my absence to show up,
 just pick up the phone and get the
 White House operator. She will know
 how to have him put out quietly.
 That's about all I can think of,
 Spiro, except don't let any hippies
 in.
 You don't have to worry about any
 routine foreign crises. If.. you get a
 sudden crisis, the National Security
 Council, will meet and tell you what
 to do. Of course, you don't have to
 accept their advice. If you're in doubt
 about whether to do it their way or
 not, get hold of the White House
 operator and tell her your problem
 and she'll work it out for you.  .
 .Last thing: "What do I do if I pick
 up the phone and the operator isn't
 there?" you're going to ask.     Don't
 worry 'about it, Spiro. Believe me,
 I've lived with the same question for

 BY PAUL HOUSTON
 Times Staff Writer
 WASHINGTON-As is,
 the' practice of diplomats,
 William B. Mzcc)niber ush-
 ered the visitor away from
 his desk and over to the
 more relaxed setting of
 couch and side chairs.
 "Somebody said the on-
 ly thing that had changed
 in  American  diplomacy
 over all these years was
 the" invention of the teTe-
 graph,"                          Macomber
 laughed. "Well, now we
 have about :00 o t h e r

 Macomber, deputy un-
 dersecretary of state for
 management, is in charge
 of implementing a vast re-
 form program that rather
 desperately seeks to re-
 store to the State Depart-
 ment some measure of its
 old clout-if not its former
 preeminence.
 New Catchwords
 hence, Foggy Bottom
 has some new catchwords-
 --"Openness"  (seeking
 more contact with the rest
 of the foreign affairs coni-
 munity).;
 --"Creativity" (encour-
 aging more dissent . from
 the official line);
 -"Democratization"
 (ridding foreign- missions
 of the hierarchal struc-

 tarian ambassador);
 -"Functional  speciali-

 pose diplomats into politi-
 cal, economic, administra-

 After World War II, the
 accelerating complexity of
 international affairs
 brought many other
 government departments
 (Defense, Treasury, Com-

 and agencies (for intel-

 Security Agency Proposes a
 Presidential Order on Law
 $peeiel to The New York Times
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 10-The
 National Security Council has
 proposed an Executive order
 tightening regulations govern-
 ing. the handling of classified
 information and suggested the
 possibility that the President
 might seek legislation to make
 it a crime for unauthorized per-
 sons to receive secret docu-
 ments, a White House officiial
 said Thursday night.
 The legislative suggestion, if
 accepted, would result in a pro-
 posal by the President of a
 tough. new law similar to the
 British  Official  Secrets  Act,
 which imposes stiff penalties
 on those who receive as well
 as on those who disclose classi-
 fied information.
 This was one of three alter-
 natives suggested for the Presi-
 dent in a draft proposal now
 being circulated among the De-
 partments of State, Defense and
 Justice, the Central Intelligence,
 Agency, and other governmen-
 tal bodies, the White House of-
 ficial said.
 Of the two others, the draft
 suggested that the President
 might seek revision of a sec-,
 tion. of the Federal Esp!onage
 Act to make it a crime to give
 classified information to any
 unauthorized person. The law
 now provides penalties for dis-
 closure: to,"a foreign agent."
 lative suggestions in the draft
 proposals, which were offered
 in response to the President's
 demand for a study of the
 handling of classifed material,:
 made shortly after the publica-j
 tion of the Pentagon Papers,
 the Defense Department's se-
 cret study of the United States
 drift into the Vietnam War.
 The other suggestions in the
 draft proposal applied primarily
 to the classification of Govern-
 ment documents,  setting . up
 regulations over how materials
 should be classified, the length
 of  time  certain  documents
 could  remain  classified, and
 who would be allowed to re-
 ceive them.
 These,  the  draft proposal
 said, could be effected in a re-
 vision of the Executive order
 that now controls the handling
 of classified information.
 The draft was being circulat-
 ed to the various agencies for
 their comments.

 'enry Kissinger sits at the round table in the corner of his
 blue-and-gold office. His back is to the window, and beyond the
 window the White House lawn is just touched by the winter sun.
 With the lone exception of Richard Nixon, who is 50 paces down
 the hall and already deep into the morning's routine, Kissinger
 is the most talked about, most analyzed and most important
 man in Washington. There is not a No. 2 man in history
 who has ever wielded such power, with such authority.
 He has devoured his dietary portion of scrambled eggs,
 crunched through half an English muffin and now is pouring
 black coffee. He has read hastily through the cover stories on
 him in both TIME and Newsweek. After a few'iraustic comments
 about how journalists think the National Security Council works,
 he grins and says, "I asked [White House speechwriter] Bill Sa-
 fire if he thought I could survive two cover stories in a single
 week. Safire said, 'No, Henry, but what a way to go.' "
 Henry is not going. Now, suddenly, he seems to drop a cur-
 tain between this office and such notions as public image. He
 leans forward, his brow furrowed. His eyes are wide, even gen-
 tle. His physical presence is again unassuming. He is the pro-
 fessor, sure enough of himself and the knowledge he brings, but
 nevertheless aware of how much he does not yet know and of
 how uncertain are the affairs of men.
 . "I'm concerned about American civilization," he says, his
 hands fumbling with each other, his voice slow. "We live in a
 world in which some countries pursue ruthless policies.... We
 are in a period which someday maybe compared to one of the re-
 ligious ages, when whole values change.... We are a warm-
 hearted people, concerning ourselves with a lot that is superficial,
 not willing to believe that we can make irrevocable errors, not
 willing to trust the judgment of the leaders until all the facts are in
 and it is usually too late, absorbed in bureaucratic infighting and
 indulging in various forms of debilitating nostalgia."
 being where he is. Richard Nixon, gut-bucket
 Middle American, and Henry Kissinger, Harvard
 intellectual, share doubts about the future. They
 also share something else-the. belief that their
 particular talents are the right ones for these
 times, to arrest the national decay and help revi-
 talize the American spirit.
 Kissinger looks uneasily at the lighted buttons
 on his huge phone console, the fever chart of the
 White House. "The historian in me says it can't
 be done. The political man in me says it is possi-
 ble. This is an elemental country, capable of tre-
 mendous effort when moved." Optimism is clear-
 Ly ascendant this morning with Henry Kissinger
 -and most mornings. Part of it comes from the'
 sheer joy of power, a glandular stimulant that is
 not four}d in Widener Library stacks or in grad-
 uate seminars on international affairs. Another
 part is the realization that three years of the Nix-
 on-Kissinger sense of objective and order have
 perceptibly calmed the world and nurtured hope.
 .  "That's our major concern about Vietnam,"
 Kissinger says, shifting so lie can watch the prog-
 ress of the thin sun against the frost on the win-
 dow panes. He throws a leg over the chair arm.
 "The President very badly wants to end the war,
 but not in a way that breaks the American spirit,
 in a way.that this country can preserve its confi-
 dence in itself." Behind him are shelves of books
 on history and politics, a kind of background tap-
 estry to Kissinger's life. Since his childhood in
 Germany, he has lived in a world of collapsing po-
 litical systems. A "sense of things failing" has
 been the subject of his scholarship, and guided the
 choice of one. of his major study areas, the five
 weeks of miscalculation and error which preced-
 ed-World War 1. "History is not a cookbook from
 which you can get recipes," Kissinger has said..,
 But his cardinal rule of diplomatic planning

 The Nixon Watch
 Shooting at Henry,
 The worst possible judge of the need for secrecy in
 government and of the ethics of officials who break
 the rules of secrecy is a working reporter such as my-
 self. I do what I can to penetrate the official fog and
 I'd welcome a lot more collaboration in that endeavor
 than I get at the Nixon White House. It is with diffi-
 dence, therefore, that I state at the outset of this note
 on a recent breach of government secrecy that in my
 opinion the official who must have been responsible
 for the breach is a rat who should be dug out of his
 hole and fired.
 The occasion for this observation is the theft from
 classified government files of documents that were
 given to columnist Jack Anderson in early December
 and have been publicized by him in fragments and in
 text since then. "Theft" is the proper word, although
 the responsible official looted his own files and gave
 facsimiles to Anderson. Jack Anderson inherited the
 "Washington Merry-Go-Round" newspaper column
 when its founder and his employer, Drew Pearson,
 died in 1969. Pearson Was and Anderson is a master
 seeker ' and purveyor of secrets. Conducted as it is in
 the Anderson column, the traffic in secrets is a bus-
 iness that makes the columnist the instrument of
 sources ,who may be trying to use him for the noblest
 or the most vicious ends. My infrequent reading of
 "Merry-Go-Round" indicates tome that Anderson does
 his best to conduct it in a decent way. He appears to be
 more careful than Pearson was to deny the column and
 its outlets in some 700 newspapers to self-servers and
 back-stabbers. It is believable that Anderson believed,
 as he says he did, that the initial source of the docu-
 ments in question made them available because he was
 convinced that the Nixon policy toward India and Pak-
 istan was disastrously mistaken and ought to be ex-
 posed and discredited. It is also believable that Jack
 Anderson was had. The difficulty with the explanation
 that he. says he accepted is that the policy was already
 known and discredited. Another columnist, Joseph
 Kraft, presented a more credible explanation of the
 original act of disclosure when he wrote that "most.
 of the evidence suggests that the true cause is a vul-
 gar bureaucratic row aimed at getting the President's
 chief assistant for national security affairs, Henry
 Kissinger:" .   '
 Only. five of the many documents that Anderson
 says he garnered in his December haul and later are
 alluded to here. Four of them are official and verbatim:
 accounts of meetings of.' the Washington Special
 Action Group, the action arm of the National Security
 Council, on December 3, 4 and 6. The fifth document
 it the parapApp   abFDraRekbaSfer2IIeQ  O4
 can Senator Kenneth Keating, the US ambassador in
 New Delhi, sent the State Department on December 8.
 I deduce from Anderson's cautious account of how he
 obtained the documents that the WSAG texts came
 from a single source who first offered him a dozen or
 so classified items and subsequently, under pressure
 from the columnist, let him take his pick from "a STATIN'
 whole massive file of documents." Anderson says that
 the stuff. came from "plural" sources and implies that
 their rank is such that public identification of them
 would embarrass the Nixon administration. The nature
 and variety of the documents on which Anderson has
 drawn in successive columns indicate that this is true
 of the total haul. The WSAG texts are special. Their
 content suggests to me, as it did to Joe Kraft, that the
 official who gave them to Anderson was shooting at
 Henry Kissinger and only incidentally, if at all, at the
 Indo-Pakistan and perhaps other policies with which
 Kissinger is associated. It is this official whom I take
 to be a high-ranking rat.
 Kissinger'
 issinger brought the publication of three of the
 four WSAG texts, and extensive printed quotations
 from the fourth, upon himself with his remark that
 ,previous references to him in Anderson columns were
 "out of context." Anderson, angered, gave the texts to
 The Washington Post, The New York Times and sev-
 eral other newspapers in order to prove that his Kis-
 singer references were accurate understatements. The
 texts are fascinating documents. They illumine a part
 A the Nixon-Kissinger policy operation as it has never
 before -been exposed. But it. is important to distinguish
 between the parts of the policy process that the WSAG
 texts do and do not illumine. They do not, as one com-
 mentator thought they did, show how "the decisional
 process" actually works. The Special Action Group
 deals with policy after it has been laid down. Kissin-
 ger's job when he functions as WSAG chairman is to
 see that the military services, State, Defense, CIA and
 other agencies involved in foreign policy understand
 exactly what the President has decided and implement
 the decided policy exactly as he wants it to be imple-
 mented. The Anderson texts show that Kissinger per-
 forms this task with a certitude, an arrogance, a dis-
 play of proxied presidential authority that smothers
 any tendency toward dissent that there may be in the
 WSAG forum. A reader may gather from the published
 texts that Kissinger dominates subordinate NSC bodies
 where preliminary policy options are discussed in the
 same way with the same effect. But the WSAG texts do
 not prove that this is.-the case. They make it difficult
 but not impossible to believe, as I have been told at the
 White House and elsewhere for three years, that Kis-
 singer in these formative sessions and in the course of
 directing preliminary policy studies for the NSC and

 visit next month. The Reds want the
 U. S. to cancel its 1954 security treaty
 with Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan and
 to announce publicly that the island
 is an integral part of mainland China.
 Aides say Mr. Nixon has no intention
 of going a fraction of that distance.
 The 10-year-old Berlin Wall and other
 massive barriers have failed to dam
 the flow of escapes from Communist
 East Germany. In the past 12 months,
 nearly 17,000 East Germans made it
 safely to the West.

 .3. Summary. Dr. Kissinger
 suggested that India might be
 attempting, through calculat-
 ed destruction of Pak armored
 and aic forces to render Pak-
 istan impotent. He requested
 that the Jordanian interest in
 assisting Pakistan not be
 turned off, but rather kept in
 it holding pattern. He asked
 that Pak capabilities in Kash-
 tnir be assessed.
 4. Mr. Helms opened the
 meeting by briefing the cur-
 rent situation. In the East,

 river crossings prevent them

 East are now vulnerable. In
 the West, the Paks are now
 claiming Punch, inside the
 Indian border. However, the.
 Paks  are  admitting fairly
 heavy casualties in the fight-
 ing. Tank battles are appar-
 ently taking place in the
 Sind/Raiasthan  area.  Mrs.
 Gandhi has indicated that be-
 fore heeding a U.N. call for
 cease-fire,  she intends to
 straighten out the southern
 border of Azad Kashmir. It is
 reported that prior to termi-
 nating  present                                         hostilities,
 Mrs. Gandhi intends to at-
 tempt to eliminate Pakistan's
 armor and air force capabil-
 ities. Thus far only India and
 Bhutan have recognized Ban-
 gladesh. It is believed that
 the Soviets have held off rec-
 ognition primarily so as not
 to rupture relations with the
 Paks. Soviet action on the
 matter of recognition, how-
 ever, may be forthcoming in
 the near future.

 stated that we would have to
 take possession of material
 that was being consigned to
 the Indians by U.S. contrac-
 tors and thus would be com-
 pelled to pay U.S. suppliers,
 resulting in claims against
 the U.S.G.
 11. Mr. Packard said that
 all of this could be done, but
 agreed that it would be a
 very laborious and difficult
 problem. He further elaborat-
 ed that all the items involved
 would have to be located, the
 United States would have to

 It the  situation were  to

 indicated then, of course,

 ever, that the Indians had
 this as their objective.  He
 indicated that Foreign Min-
 ister Singh told Ambassador
 Keating that India had no
 intention of taking any Pak
 territory. Mr. Sisco said it
 must also be kept in mind
 that Kashmir is really dis-
 puted territory.
 16. Mr. Helms then stated
 that earlier he had omitted

 HIGH  POLICY differ.
 ences are widely supposed
 to have prompted the leak
 of secret documents on the
 Indo-Pakistani crisis to Jack
 Anderson. But most of the
 evidence suggests that the
 true cause is a vulgar bu-
 reaucratic row aimed at get-
 ting the President's chief as-
 sistant for national security
 affairs, Henry Kissinger.
 The most striking evi-
 dence is like the evidence of
 the dog that didn't bark in
 the Sherlock Holmes story.
 The fact is that no enduring
 policy issue of high impor-
 tance  is  involved  in  the
 leaks.
 The fight over East Ben-
 gal is largely a one-shot af=
 fair. Hardly anything that
 happens on the subcontinent
 is' central to international
 politics. The United States
 had already tipped toward
 Pakistan - and practically
 everybody knew it-when
 the leaks were sprung. At
 the time, as some of Dr. Kis-
 singer's  comments  make
 plain,  the administration
 was anticipating a return to
 more normal relations with
 New. Delhi.
 A SECOND BIT of evi-
 dence' involves Mr. Ander-
 son  himself.  He  is  not
 deeply versed in foreign af-
 ,fairs. No one who aimed to
 change a line of interna-
 tional policy would single
 out Mr. Anderson as the
 agent for deflecting that re-
 sult through the leak of se-
 cret information.
 Mr. Anderson's specialty-
 and it is an important spec-
 ialty-is  putting  the  jour-
 nalistic arm on wrong-doers.
 By no mere accident the
 chief fruit of his disclosures
 was not something that af-
 fected policy. The chief eon-
 sequence was to impugn the
 integrity of Dr. Kissinger.
 As a third bit of evidence
 there is the state of rela-
 tions among senior officials
 and  principal agencies of
 the foreign affairs commu-
 nity in the Nixon adminis-
 tration. Washington veter-
 ans tell me that to find a fit
 counterpart they have to go
 back to 1950, and the deadly
 you-or-me rivalry between
 Dean Acheson
 at the State 4010,
 and  Louis Johnson, who
 then'rul'ed the roost at the
 g Kissingei
 Pentagon. In any case, rela-
 tions nowadays are marked
 by paranoia, jealousy and
 hatred.
 The chief target for most
 of the venom is Dr. Kissin-
 ger, and some of the fault is
 his. He has a sharp tongue,
 and he has been unnecessar-
 ily  unkind  in  comments
 about some of the senior of-
 ficials of the most pres-
 tigous departments.
 But most of the resentment
 has been caused by what Dr.
 Kissinger does in the serv-
 ice of the President. The
 present administration has
 expanded the job of special
 assistant for national secu-
 rity affairs way beyond what
 it was under Walt Rostow
 and McGeorge Bundy. Dr.
 Kissinger has virtually elim-
 inated  from  the decision-
 making business some of the
 most high-powered men and
 agencies in town.
 The office of Secretary of
 Defense is perhaps the chief
 victim. Secretary of Defense
 Melvin Laird is going to be
 stepping  down  soon with
 practically nothing to his
 credit.   Even  his  claim
 (which has at least some
 foundation) to be the author
 of the policy for getting out
 of Vietnam is not widely be-
 lieved.
 He seems hostile to the
 administration's policy  on
 an arms control agreement,
 and he was completely cut
 out of plans for the Presi-
 dent's visit to China. His
 general reputation for trick-
 iness has caused the cognos-
 centi, rightly or wrongly, to
 establish him as the short-
 odds favorite for almost all
 leaks regarding national se-
 curity these days. Indeed,
 sonic White House officials
 at first believed Mr. Laird
 leaked the Pentagon papers.
 formed military are in the
 habit of leaking classified
 information to serve their
 own interests.
 Not that the State Depart.
 ment or other civilian agen-.
 cies can be entirely ex-
 empted   from   suspicion
 .Except as regards the Near
 .East,  Dr.  Kissinger has
 taken over the whole realm
 of foreign policy-including
 even negotiation with for-
 eign officials. This assump.
 tion of the State Depart-
 .mont's traditional role is bit-
 terly resented by many of
 the department's leading of-
 ficials. Indeed, one of them,
 not long ago, voiced the sus-
 picion  that  Dr. Kissinger
 spent an extra day on his
 last trip to China in order to
 embarrass  the  State  De-
 partment which was han
 ating  the United  Nations
 vote on Chinese admission.
 With suspicions at that
 level, there is every reason
 to figure bureaucractic ri-
 valry as the key element in
 the background of the An-
 derson papers. There is no
 case for lionizing, or even
 protecting.the sources of the
 of the leaks.
 On the contrary, for orice
 there is a case for a presi-
 dential crackdown. Mr. Nix-
 on's interest-and that of
 the country-is to find the
 source of the leaks and fire
 them fast.
 STATINTL
 THE UNIFORMED MILI-
 TARY comes a close second
 in the odds. Many of them
 do not like the way the White
 House is winding down the
 war in Vietnam. Almost all
 are opposed to the arms con-
 trol, agreement which the
 White House is now negoti-
 ating  with the  Russians.

 Andrsc'nF p r
 The bloodhounds are baying on the tracks of Jack
 Anderson, who conducts a weekly news column, The
 Washington . Merry-Go-Round, published in 700 news-
 papers at home and abroad.
 Investigators for the FBI, State Department, De-
 partment of Justice and probably other agencies are   /
 hot on his trail. Rep. F. Edward Hebert (D-La.), V
 anti-union, racist chairman of the House Armed Ser-
 vices Committee, announced Thursday a subcommittee
 will get into the act immediately when Congress
 opens on Jan. 18.
 Anderson has published in his column excerpts
 from the minutes of the Washington Special Action
 Group (a subcommittee of the National Security Coun-
 cil, abbreviated as WSAG) and other documents and
 memoranda meant only for the inner circles of the
 Administration. They expose the double-dealing and
 lying of the Nixon Administration, particularly in rela-
 tion to the Indian-Pakistani conflict. Anderson has also
 made some of this material available to the press
 generally.
 Among the information Anderson disclosed is the
 revelation that Nixon's adviser on national security
 affairs, Dr. Henry Kissinger, on the one hand pub-
 licly told the press that the Administration was
 friendly to India and on the other hand told the Wash-
 ington Special Action Group behind the screen of of-
 ficial secrecy that Nixon "wants to tilt in favor of
 Pakistan" and that Nixon believed "we are not being
 tough enough on India."
 It is quite possible, after the exposure of the gov-
 ernmental lying during five Administrations, Democrat-
 ic'and Republican. in the Pentagon papers, that some
 governmental figures may have begun to think twice
 about the questionable "wisdom" - from a pro-
 capitalist point of view - of Nixcn's policies in the
 Bangla Desh situation and in Asia generally.
 The differences in the ruling class and its collabo-
 rators on this score are useful to the people.
 Besides the facts revealed by Anderson, there is
 an important issue involved in his disclosures. That is
 the right of the people to know. Anderson has not made
 this a major feature of his expose, but it is there any-
 -way. It, is also involved in the defense of Dr. Daniel
 Ellsberg and Anthony Russo, who are being prosecuted
 and persecuted for their part in tearing away the veil
 of secrecy in which the searing facts of the conspiracy
 which plunged the United States into barbaric aggres-
 sion in Indochina had been buried.

 Washington, Jan. 7-0ne of the local television sta-
 tions has been showing old Marx Brothers movies on the
 late show this week-possibly as a sort of relief from the
 real-life zaniness that abounds here in the capital of the
 Free World.
 Certainly, Groucho's role in "Horsefeathers" as Prof. Quincy

 of its woefully inept football team, seems no more nutty than the

 flap over the so-called Pakistani tilt in
 the latest secret papers caper. Nor can
 it compare with those early-morning
 presidential phone calls to pro football
 coaches.
 (In fact, President Nixon's pros.
 pensity for ringing up Washington's
 Redskins coach George Allen with play
 suggestions prompted one sportswriter
 to remark that the chief executive
 actually wasn't interested in running for the presidency again, but
 rather was bidding for the opening as head coach of the Chicago
 Bears. "If he gets it," the wise guy added, "look for Martha Mitchell
 to work the phones.")
 . For those of you who may not remember, what plot there Is in
 "Horsefeathers" revolves around the theft of Huxley U's secret foot-
 ball signals. Of course, any team
 whose backfield includes Harpo

 (In the case of Groucho, ni a k e

 in wonderment, does this have to

 Well, substitute secret papers
 for s e c r e t signals, fellows and
 girls,' and you h a v e a real-life

 swinging Groucho like professor
 (guess who?).           -
 In the beginning, there was
 -columnist Jack Anderson charg-
 ing that secret White House and
 Pentagon documents in his pos-
 session showed there was a sharp
 conflict between what the Nixon
 administration said in public and
 what it said in private during the
 -India-Pakistan  War.  Anderson
 said that the President-whose
 suggestion of an end-around play
 to Coach Allen lost the Redskins
 13 crucial yards during their
 Harpo Marx
 The hero of the white wines
 playoff with San Francisco-wanted U.S. Policy to "tilt in favor 0
 Pakistan." You may recall that the Paks lost a lot more than 13
 yards in their game, so the Nixon coaching record remains Un-
 blemished at .000.                                           -
 Then Nixon's national security affairs adviser, Henry Kissinger,
 while flying out of the Western White House with the chief execu-
 tive, did something he swore he wouldn't do again-he briefed the
 newsmen on board the plane, "not for attribution." He claimed that
 remarks attributed to him by Anderson were taken "out of context."
 This prompted Anderson to leak some of the confidential goodie
 he had to some of his newspaper clients before they got copies 0
 his column, so they could. get a running start on the story.
 Is Somebody Going Through the Garbage?
 But this, in turn, roused other newspapers, so Anderson had to
 release the text of three secret memoranda of meetings of the hush-
 hush 'Washington Special Action Group. In the words of the Im-
 mortal Kingfish, Anderson, who once was the leakee, thus become
 the leaker. And he didn't like it much. Pretty soon, he had to take
 his phone off the hook and go into seclusion to get any work done.
 Secrets-hungry reporters were calling him from everywhere, badger.
 ing his secretary and office staff for new revelations. There were
 reports that the FBI was going through his garbage.
 Meanwhile, back at the White House, certain high officials were
 hinting that maybe the administration wasn't going to look too
 closely into who did the leaking because maybe they sort of wanted
 this stuff leaked. It would take the likes of the late IIarpo, complete'
 with ever-tooting bicycle horn, to figure that one out, friends, so
 don't try.
 There's No Substitute for Henry K
 One thing becomes clear upon closer reading of the top-secret
 memos, however, and that is that Central Intelligence Director V,
 Richard M. Helms and Kissinger apparently are the only senior
 biggies who go to all the meetings they're scheduled to go to. Th
 other members of the Washington Special Action Group all sen~
 substitutes, even such relatively obscure types as the head of the
 Agency for International Development. In Kissing?er's case, it's easy,
 to see why he was at all the meetings; after all, it's his club,
 Down the Pike From Appomattox
 One of the faithful WSAG attendees was the Hon. Armistead
 I. :ielden Jr., who now rejoices in the title of principal deputy
 assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. A.
 Democratic congressman from Alabama for 16 years, Selden was
 involuntarily retired from elective politics in 1968 after lie was
 defeated in a bid for his party's Senate nomination. At that time,
 his colleagues were predictably effusive in their praise of his service.
 "The greatest hour of Robert E. Lee came not when he was com-
 manding the great army of the Confederacy, but after he had met
 military defeat and surrendered his sword to Grant at Appomattox,"
 said the late Rep. George Andrews (D-Ala.).
 How right Andrews was proved out a few months later when
 Selden took his last congressional junket, a taxpayer-financed tour
 of Latin America. Just to make. sure that there would be no com-
 munications gap, Selden's office thoughtfully provided a full bean
 of pre-dated handouts and statements from the lawmakers for usg
 during the first week of the trip.             ..        .

 SISCO: We will have a recommenda-

 meeting with the Ambassador. In order
 to give the Ambassador time to wire
 ,home, we could tentatively plan to con-

 KISSINGER: We have to take action.
 The President is blaming me, but you
 people are in the clear.
 SISCO: That's ideal!
 KISSINGER:  The earlier draft for
 Bush is too even-handed.
 SISCO: To recapitulate, after we have
 seen the Pak Ambassador, the Secretary
 will report to you. We will update the
 draft speech for Bush.
 KISSINGER: We can say we favor
 political accommodation but the real job
 of the Security Council is to prevent
 military action.
 SISCO: We have never had a reply
 either from Kosygin or Mrs. Gandhi.
 WILLIAMS: Are we to take economic
 steps with Pakistan also?
 KISSINGER: Wait until I talk with
 the President. He hasn't addressed this
 problem in connection with Pakistan
 yet.
 SISCO: If we act on the Indian side,
 we can say we are keeping the Pakistan
 situation "under review."
 KISSINGER: It's hard to tilt toward
 Pakistan if we have to match every
 Indian step with a Pakistan step. If you
 wait until Monday, I can get a Presiden-
 tial decision.
 PACKARD: It should be easy for us
 to inform the banks involved to defer
 action inasmuch as we are so- near
 the weekend.
 KISSINGER: We need a WSAG in the
 morning. We need to think about our
 treaty obligations. I remember a letter
 or  memo  interpreting  our  existing
 treaty with a special India tilt. When I
 visited Pakistan in January, 1962, I was
 briefed on a secret document or oral

 tion in the west wing, there are con-
 flicting reports from both sides and the
 only common ground is the Pak attacks
 on the Amritsar, Pathankot and Srina-
 gar airports. The Paks say the Indians
 are attacking all along the border; but
 the Indian officials say this is a lie.
 In the east wing the action is becoming
 larger and the Paks claim there are
 now seven separate fronts involved.
 KISSINGER: Are the Indians seizing
 territory?
 HELMS: Yes; small bits of territory,
 definitely.
 SISCO: It would help if you could
 `provide a map with a shading of. the
 areas occupied by India. What is hap-
 pening in the West-is a full-scale at-
 tack likely?
 MOORER: The present pattern is puz-
 zling in that the Paks have only struck
 at three small airfields which do not
 house significant 'numbers of Indian
 combat aircraft.
 HELMS: Mrs. Gandhi's speech at 1:30
 may  well  announce  recognition  of
 Bangladesh.
 MOORER: The Pak attack is not
 credible. It has been made during late
 afternoon, which doesn't make sense.
 We do not seem to have sufficient facts
 on this yet.
 KISSINGER: Is it possible that the
 Indians attacked first and the Paks sim-

 MOORER: This is certainly possible.

 U.So Stance on India
 Baffled Diplomats
 .By Laurence Stern
 Washington Post'Staff Writer
 In inid-April last year a.
 ? s "secret"  cable  from New
 Delhi dropped into the in-
 ' coming traffic of Secretary
 of State William P. Rogers.
 "Pakistan is probably fin-
 ?` fished as a unified state,"
 ,.said the message from U.S.
 `Ambassador   Kenneth  B.
 Keating. "India is clearly

 with limited potential and
 massive problems, is proba-

 "There  is  much  the

 The classified cable was
 the, first attempt by the U.S.
 embassy in New Delhi to set
 out in comprehensive terms
 a policy for meeting the on-
 .coming, holocaust in the sub-
 continent.
 Its substance was to be re-
 peated at least a dozen
 times, in varying form, as
 the pattern of armed con-
 frontation  between  India
 and Pakistan hardened into
 a full-scale military conflict.
 But, as events unfolded,
 the Washington view of how
 to deal with the threat of
 war on the subcontinent
 began to diverge ever more
 sharply from the course that
 was being propounded by
 the U.S, officials "on the
 ground" in India and East
 Bengal.
 Initial puzzlement at the
 responses  of  Washington
 gave way, among the diplo-

 The   only  top-ranking

 --jack Anderson:' A funny story
 By TED KNAP
 Scripps Howard staff writer
 The Justice Department has directed the
 `FBI to investigate who leaked highly embar-
 rassing classified documents detailing White
 House policy meetings on the India-Pakistan
 ?war to columnist Jack Anderson, administra-
 tion sources said today.
 A Justice Department spokesman ended sev-
 eral days of "no comment" by admitting for
 the first time that the matter was "under
 investigation."
 Earlier reports were that a search for the
 source of the leak was being conducted only
 within each of the departments which had offi-
 cials at the secret meetings. Government
 sources said the probe now has moved to a
 'higher level with the calling in of the FBI and
 ,also the Internal Security Division of the Jus-
 tice Department, which would handle any pro-
 secution.
 NO MUZZLE
 ,press further publication of the Anderson col-
 umns, as it did after initial publication of the
 Pentagon papers last year. ..
 The Washington Post today said Mr. Ander-
 son gave it the full texts of three of the secret
 documents. The Post, which carries Mr. An-
 derson's column, said the three documents
 were on the letterhead of the Joint Chiefs of
 Staff and of Warren G. Nutter, assistant secre-
 tary of defense for international security af-
 fairs.
 The Post quoted Mr. Anderson as saying his

 hell every half hour from the President that
 we are not being tough enough on India."
 Mr. Anderson said the documents disclose
 that Dr. Kissinger sought to get around the
 ban on U.S. arms shipments to Pakistan by
 having them sneaked in thru Jordan or Saudi
 Arabia
 "Dr. Kissinger asked whether we have the
 right to authorize Jordan or Saudi Arabia to
 transfer military equipment to Pakistan," =Mr.
 Anderson quoted from the Dec. 6 minutes.
 "Mr. (Christopher) Van Hollen (State Depart-
 ment Asia expert) stated that the United
 States cannot permit a third country to trans-
 fer arms which we have provided them when
 we, ourselves, do not authorize the sale direct
 to the ultimate recipient."
 ,OUT OF CONTEXT'   -

 had been crippled by initial Indian' attacks.
 The war was over in two weeks, before any
 such shipment was made. Mr. Anderson said
 the documents indicate that a final decision
 had not been reached.
 Mr. Anderson said the President overrode
 the advice of State Department senior officials
 to appeal to the West Pakistan government to
 atop persecuting Bengalis in East Pakistan,
 and to remain neutral between West Pakistan
 and India. One of those participating in the
 secret meetings wrote this report, according to
 Mr. Anderson:
 Dr. Kissinger said that we are not trying to
 be even-handed. The President does not want
 to be even-handed. The President believes. that
 India is the attacker... .
 "Dr: Kissinger said that we cannot afford to
 ease India's state of mind. "The Lady' (Mrs.
 Indira Gandhi,  India's  prime  minister)  is
 cold-blooded and tough and will not turn into a
 Soviet satellite merely because of pique. We
 should not ease her mind. He invited anyone
 who objected to this approach to take his case
 to the President."
 STATE LEAK
 Speculation here is that the leak came from
 the State Department, which has had its ego
 bruised lately by Dr. Kissinger's emergence as:
 the dominant foreign policy figure in the ad-'
 ministration. Mr. Anderson refused to pinpoint
 his source.
 The minutes described meetings in early De-
 cember of the Special Action Group, com-
 prised of State, Defense,  CIA,  and White',
 House officials. The papers were variously
 including "secret sensitive." Mr.

 STATINTL
 By Sanford J. Ungar
 Syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, in a
 major challenge to the secrecy surrounding
 U.S. policy in the Indo-Pakistani war, last night
 gave The Washington Post the full texts of
 three secret documents describing meetings
 of the National Security Council's Washington
 Special Action Group (WSAG).
 The documents indicate that Henry A. Kis-
 singer, President Nixon's national security ad-
 viser, instructed government agencies to take
 a hard line with India in public statements and
 private actions during last month's war on the
 Indian subcontinent.
 Anderson released the documents after Kis
 singer told reporters Monday during an air-
 borne conversation en route to the Western
 White House in San Clemente that the col-
 umnist, in stories based on the materials, had
 taken "out cf context" remarks indicating that
 the administration was against India.
 Among the significant statements bearing
 on U.S. policy in the documents were the
 following:
 ? "KISSINGER: I am getting hell every half
 hour from the President that we are not being
 tough enough on India. lie has just called me
 again. He does not believe we are carrying out
 this wishes. He wants to tilt in favor of Pakis-
 tan. He feels everything we do comes out
 'otherwise."
 ? "Dr, Kissinger said that whoever was put-
 ting out background information relative to the
 current  situation  is  provoking  presidential
 wrath. The President is under the 'illusion'
 that he is giving instructions; not that he is
 merely being kept apprised of affairs as they
 progress. Dr. Kissinger asked that this be kept
 in mind."
 ? "Dr. Kissinger also directed that hence-
 forth we show a certain coolness to the In-
 dians; the Indian Ambassador is not to be
 treated at too high a level."
 %' ? "Dr. Kissinger ... asked whether we-
 have the right to authorize Jordan or Saudi
 Arabia to transfer military equipment to Pak-
 istan. Mr. (Christopher) Van. Hollen (deputy
 .assistant secretary of state for South Asian
 affairs) stated the United States cannot permit
 a third country to transfer arms which we
 have provided them when we, ourselves. do
 not authorize sale direct to the ultimate re-
 cipient, such as Pakistan."
 ? "Mr. (Joseph) Sisco (assistant secretary of
 estate for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs)
 suggested that what we are really interested in
 are what supplies and equipment could be
 dors to India and Pakistan, as'
 well as numerous other docu-
 ments bearing on American
 policy.
 He showed this reporter a
 briefcase with about 20 file l
 folders, each containing some'
 of the documents.
 Anderson declined to name,
 his sources, but suggested that;
 they occupy high positions in
 the Nixon administration.
 "If the sources were identi- j
 fied," he said  "it would em-
 barrass  the                                                                                                  administration I
 more than it would me, It
 would make      a  very funny
 story."
 Since the controversy last
 year over release of the Penta-
 1 gon Papers, a top-secret his-
 tory of U.S. policy in Vietnam,
 Anderson said, his sources had
 become more, rather than less,
 material.
 The texts obtained by The
 Post provide  substantial  de-
 tails  of  the                                                                                            back:-and-forth
 at Special Action Group meet-
 ings  among                                                                                              representatives
 l of      the White  House, State
 and Defense departments, Cen-
 tral Intelligence Agency, Na-
 tional Security Couiacil, Joint
 Chiefs of Staff and the Agency
 for International Development.
 The three texts are:

 Sen. J. W. Fulbright, chair-

 Relations Committee, to  use
 them as the basis for 'an in-

 South Asia.
 Fulbright, out of Washing-
 ton during the congressional
 recess, could not be reached
 for comment.
 The columnist also suggested
 that other members of Con-

 Most of the significant. state-

 released  last  night had al-

 700 newspapers, including The.

 that a pattern of leaks now
 may make government offi-
 cials reluctant, in the future,
 to offer proposals that might
 be embarrassing if they were
 published, or to be candid in
 their comments on policies un-

 The Anderson documents re-
 veal what appear to be two
 major discrepancies between
 what the administration was
 doing - or thinking about
 doing - at the height of the
 India - Pakistan crisis and
 what it was telling the public.
 Anderson suggested a com-
 parison be made between the
 minutes of the sessions - par-
 ticularly Kissinger's comment
 that he was getting hell from
 the President for not being
 tough enough on India - and a
 Kissinger "background" brief-

 Anderson said the comparison
 would show the government
 "lied" to the public.
 In that backgrounder, Kis-

 Arms Transfer Suggested
 The other major discrepan-
 cy noted by Anderson arises
 from the minutes of the Dec. 6
 meeting in which Kissinger is
 said to have asked whether the
 United States could authorize
 Jordan or Saudi Arabia to
 transfer  American military
 equipment to Pakistan.
 Two State Department offi-
 cials responded that such a
 transfer would be illegal and
 that  the Jordanians would
 probably be grateful if the
 United States "could get them
 off the hook" by denying au-
 thority for such a transfer.

 Chiselled into the marble which is the only relieving feature o
 the building's sterile main entrance are the words, "The Trut
 Shall Make You Free." The quotation from St. John was
 personally chosen for the new building by Allen W. Dulles over /
 the objection of several subordinates who felt that the Agency,
 then still reeling from the Bay of Pigs debacle, should adopt a
 .somewhat less lofty motto. (In those dark days of late 196r, some
 suggested that a more appropriate choice would be "Look Before
 You Leap.") But Dulles had a deeper sense of history than
 most. Although he was a casualty of the By of Pigs and never
 .sat in the Director's office with its view over the Potomac, he
 left a permanent mark not only on the Agency which he had
 fashioned but on its building which he had planned.
 Allen Dulles was famous among many and notorious among
 some for his consummate skill as an intelligence operative
 ("spook" in current parlance), but one of his greatest contribu-
 tions in nurturing the frail arrangements he helped to create to
 provide intelligence support to Washington's top-level foreign-
 policy-makers.

 National Security Council and the Central- Intelligence Agency, ,I
 recalls that, "Each time the National Security Council is about
 to consider a certain policy-let us say a policy having to do

 present an estimate of the effects such a policy is likely to
 have. ...1 President Truman painted a somewhat more cozy
 relationship between the NSC and the CIA than probably
 existed during, and certainly since, his Administration. None
 the less, it is fair to say that the intelligence community, and espe-
 cially the CIA, played an important advisory role in high-level
 policy deliberations during the i95os and early r96os.
 To provide the most informed intelligence judgments on the
 effects a contemplated policy might have on American na-
 tional security interests, a group especially tailored for the task
 was organized in rgso within the CIA. While this step would
 probably have been taken sooner or later, the communist victory

 General U Thant's ineffective.
 'General might be attributed to
 "physical strain due to his re-

 put the matter more bluntly
 by calling the U.N. wrangle a
 "farce,"
 Kissinger made clear his
 contempt for the U.N. at a
 cause of Soviet vetoes. The
 whole thing is a farce."
 "The Soviet tactic will he to
 stall, as they do not want a
 cease-fire yet," agreed Christo-

 Footnote:   When   Indian
 troops threatened Dacca, Sec-
 retary General U Thant's first
 reaction was to evacuate the
 U.N. mission.
 This brought stern, secret
 instructions from State Secre-
 tary Bill Rogers to Ambassa-

 (U.S. delegation) to convey to
 SYG (Secretary General) or

 sought to cut down his award
 on the ground that cancer had
 reduced his life expectancy,
 Now Kennedy has died and
 his wife and child need the
 award more than ever.
