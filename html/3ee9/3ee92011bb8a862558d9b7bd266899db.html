 China: The Year in Review
 Summary
 Economic considerations dominated China's political agenda in 1985
 to an unusual degree.   Buoyant after the October 1984 party meeting that
 endorsed urban economic reforms, Deng Xiaoping and his supporters
 within the Chinese leadership sought to make 1985 the "Year of Reform,"
 carrying out controversial new economic policies and seeking to improve
 and consolidate their hold on the levers of power.
 But economic policies did not fulfill the reformers' expectations, and
 they even exacerbated a number of China's existing economic problems.
 The government was rocked by soaring inflation, an overheated industrial
 sector, a sharp trade deficit and diminished foreign currency reserves, a
 7-percent dropoff in grain production, and a growing corruption problem,
 all of which gave political critics of reform the opportunity to renew their
 attacks at mid year
 This memorandum was prepared by                                     Office of East
 Asian Analysis.  Information available as ot Z8 March 1986 was used in its preparation.

 Despite the increased pressure, Deng and his allies were able to
 bring off a significant political victory at the September Conference of
 Party Delegates. At that meeting, Deng managed to secure the retirement
 of numerous members of the party's conservative Old Guard--including 10
 members  of the  Politburo--and  replaced them  with  younger,  better
 educated leaders more committed to the principles of reform. Party
 conservatives nonetheless remain a formidable force.  Party reformers
 have recovered somewhat from the political difficulties of last year, but
 the complexity of the economic problems that face China has evidently
 made them more cautious, and they have set as their goal for 1986
 "consolidation and digestion" of reforms already undertaken, and economic
 stabilization.
 Economic considerations played a major role in China's foreign
 relations as well, although strategic concerns remain the central focus.
 Chinese leaders expressed satisfaction with the "stable" nature of relations
 with the United States, which permitted a 25-percent increase in bilateral
 trade (to about $8 billion).  No major trade or political issues emerged in
 1985, although the usual problems of Taiwan, textiles and technology
 transfer remain in dispute.
 Last year saw a concerted attempt on China's part to test the new
 Soviet leader's interest in rapprochement:  anti-Soviet polemics were
 reduced, and the level of official contact between the two governments
 was  raised  somewhat.   Gorbachev  did     not  offer  any  significant
 concessions on the fundamental issues dividing the two sides, however,
 and, by the end of the year, the atmospherics had cooled noticeably, with
 the  Chinese refuting  Soviet claims that   relations   were improving.
 Economic relations between China and the Soviet Union continued their
 slow trend of improvement in 1985, with bilateral trade approaching $2
 Last year, the first full year in which to measure China's performance under
 economic reform guidelines and policies, was a trying one for China's reform leadership.
 Starting off the year full of enthusiasm for the economic reform policies approved at the
 landmark Third Plenum of the 12th Central Committee (October 1984), party leaders went
 from ebullient confidence to gnawing doubt and defensiveness to stiff determination as
 they watched the economic, political, and social effects of their policies.  Having based
 their political philosophy on their ability to bring about economic improvement, party
 reformers, led by Deng Xiaoping, were bruised by accusations from conservatives last
 summer that they mishandled economic policies in 1985. Although the problems did not
 prevent Deng from making important political gains at the Party Delegates conference
 held in September, they clearly were enough to slow the momentum of political and

 Deng Xiaoping, 82, is still the linchpin of the political system in China, and
 concerns about the state of his health emerged when Deng stopped making public
 appearances for a two-month period in late 1985 and early 1986.  Deng showed up for
 Chinese New Year in his home province of Sichuan, but speculation about him and
 possible succession changes intensified last year.  Deng himself evidently helped fuel
 the rumors at mid year, when, according to Hong Kong publications, he developed a
 "second stage" succession package.                                            at some
 point in the next two years, the following leadership changes will take place: Deng will
 resign as Chairman of the party Military Commission, and will be replaced by Hu
 Yaobang;   Hu Yaobang will give up his post as General Secretary of the party to
 Secretariat Standing Secretary Hu Qili; President Li Xiannian will retire and his job will be
 taken over by Premier Zhao Ziyang; Zhao will be succeeded as premier by one of his
 younger Vice Premiers, Li Peng or Tian Jiyun.
 Although the changes were not put into effect at the September Conference of
 Party Delegates--as  some  had  speculated--Deng  did  bring  off a  major political
 realignment at that meeting, a rejuvenation of the party's leadership that is consistent in
 intent with the "second stage" succession scenario. At the Central Committee plenum
 that preceded the Delegates Conference, 65 elderly members of the Central Committee
 resigned, including 10 members of the Politburo and one of six members of the crucial
 Politburo Standing Committee.   The full Delegates Conference then chose 91  new
 Central Committee members, preparing the way for the "election" at the ensuing Central
 Committee plenum of six new Politburo members and five additional members of the
 Secretariat.
 Generally speaking, the leadership changes shifted the balance within all the
 leading party organs in favor of those associated with reform.   Almost all of the
 Politburo retirees were considered "conservative" on reform issues, and seven of them
 were representatives of China's armed forces, which sometimes has been viewed as
 being in opposition to Deng's reforms. Most of the new leaders meet Deng's succession
 criteria of younger, better educated, professionally qualified, and politically reliable (read
 non leftist). Within the Politburo in particular, the addition of Hu Qili, Tian Jiyun, Wu
 Xueqian, and Qiao Shi appears to significantly strengthen the reform group within the
 leadership.   New Politburo members Yao Yilin and Li Peng, although they publicly
 support  and  administer  reform  policies, seem to  lean toward  Politburo  Standing
 Committee member Chen Yun, who emerged last year as reform's principal detractor.
 Deng by no means swept away all opposition to his programs at the party
 meetings. The strongest voices in the conservative cause, in fact, maintained their party
 positions: Chen Yun and Li Xiannian on the Politburo Standing Committee, Peng Zhen
 and Hu Qiaomu on the Politburo, and Deng Liqun on the Secretariat.  It also appeared
 that Deng had to compromise on some personnel issues, on the pace of implementation
 of reform policies, and on the ideological tone of the party's programs.  Deng's own
 speech to the assembled delegates stressed some conservative themes, including the
 need to improve the knowledge of Marxist theory within the party. Deng also had to sit
 through a bitter diatribe from Chen Yun, who made his complaints about some aspects
 of reform completely clear, and implicitly warned Deng not to try to stifle dissent within
 the party.

 In the period leading up to the conference, leadership tensions had been quite
 high, and we believe this was a factor in the way Beijing handled economic policy
 during the middle part of the year. China's leaders were confronted with a considerable
 amount of bad news during the late spring and early summer: high industrial growth
 rates, a startling increase in the money supply and capital construction expenditures,
 urban food price inflation, skyrocketing imports and a downward plunge in foreign
 exchange reserves, a gloomy agricultural forecast, and a host of corruption scandals,
 many of them involving the Special Economic Zones. Reform critics seized on these and
 other issues and, in our view, forced the reformers into a defensive position.  This
 accounts for, among other things, Deng's statements in July that the SEZs were
 "experimental," and could fail.
 Since the party conference, reformers have continued to be defensive in their
 speeches and articles about economic policies, but less, we believe, because they fear
 conservative attacks, and more because the policies themselves have been flawed, or
 incorrectly implemented.  Moreover, reformers such as Tian Jiyun and Wan Li have
 begun openly to rebut the criticisms leveled at reforms by conservatives last year,
 particularly on such issues as grain production and rural industry, and the linkage
 between reform policies and corruption. In sum, we believe the reformers have regained
 the initiative as a  result of the changes brought about by the Party Delegates
 Conference, but will not use it to push through any controversial new reforms.  Instead,
 they have declared 1986 to be a year of "consolidation and digestion" of reforms already
 Foreign Policy
 China  increasingly  is  tailoring  its  foreign  policy  to  serve  its economic
 modernization drive.  This is reflected in Beijing's efforts over the past year to improve
 relations with both Washington and Moscow.  Relations, however, continue to be closer
 and smoother with the United States. Indeed, the Chinese continue to regard the United
 States as an important strategic shield against Soviet military pressure as well as a key
 source of investment capital and technology.
 Chinese leaders repeatedly stress that Sino-US relations are "stable"--reflecting
 their interest in  seeing  the economic  relationship in  particular  continue to  grow.
 Bilateral trade jumped last year by more than 25 percent, from $6 billion to about $8
 billion, according to US customs statistics.  Direct US investment also increased to just
 over $1 billion--most of it in offshore oil exploration and drilling. Economic ties are
 likely to geta further boost as a result of recent US efforts to streamline COCOM
 procedures for handling Chinese requests for licenses for Western technology.         US
 exports of advanced technology in fact rose to $500 million in        1985 and almost
 certainlywill increase again this year.
 The US-China military relationship is developing at a gradual pace but has hit
 some snags along the way.  The United States has taken some initial steps to assist
 China with military modernization.  A key component of that assistance--the sale of an
 avionics package for the Chinese F-8 fighter--is now before the US Congress for

 approval.  But Chinese demands that Washington give private assurances that visiting
 US warships would not be carrying nuclear weapons forced the US Navy last spring to
 postpone indefinitely a planned port call to Shanghai.
 The differences over the port call appear to reflect an increasing reluctance on
 the part of some senior Chinese leaders to have China identified strategically with the
 United States--lest that complicate Chinese efforts to improve relations with Moscow
 and compromise China's more independent foreign policy posture.  Over the past year
 or so, and especially since the accession of Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev, Beijing
 has made several symbolic concessions designed in part to test the new Soviet leader's
 interest in seeking a rapprochement with China.  In addition to referring once more to
 the USSR as "socialist," and Soviet leaders as "comrades," the Chinese have cautiously
 agreed to reestablish some long-severed ties--trade union and parliamentary relations.
 They have stopped short of agreeing to restore formal party-to-party ties, presumably
 hoping to extract a significant Soviet political concession in exchange.
 Thus far, Moscow has been unwilling to offer such a quid pro quo. At the recent
 Soviet party congress, Gorbachev reiterated the standard Soviet line of offering to
 improve relations with China as long as it was not at the expense of any third party--a
 not very veiled reference to Soviet allies in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Mongolia.  As a
 result, progress toward an expansion of political relations appears to have stalled once
 more over China's demands for satisfaction on the so-called "three obstacles"--that is,
 that the Soviets either withdraw their forces from Afghanistan, cease their support for
 Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia, or substantially reduce Soviet forces along the
 Sino-Soviet border, including those in Mongolia.
 After months of muting their criticism, the Chinese in fact have increased the
 volume recently of their attacks on Soviet foreign policy.  They also have rebuffed
 Moscow's efforts to pin down dates for the exchange of visits by Soviet and Chinese
 foreign ministers, which Beijing agreed to in principle last fall.  It would appear that the
 Chinese are trying to exploit the Soviets' interest in the visits to induce Moscow to
 adopt a somewhat more flexible approach to some of the security issues that divide
 Sino-Soviet economic relations continue to improve.  Over the past three years,
 bilateral trade has increased substantially, approaching $2 billion.  The Chinese and
 Soviets are moving ahead, for example, with plans for the Soviets to help modernize
 some factories they built in the 1950s, and to build several new projects.  Even if
 political relations remain stalemated, the Chinese probably calculate that expanding
 economic ties will help to keep tension with Moscow manageable, and will give them
 access to some useful Soviet technology.
 China's relations with Western Europe, Japan, and much of the Third World also
 are being shaped increasingly by economic considerations--that is, the desire for
 markets, raw materials, technology, and investment capital.  In the case of Western
 Europe and countries around China's periphery, strategic considerations of course still
 weigh very heavily.  The Chinese continue to strongly support Pakistan and the Afghan
 resistance as well as Thailand and the Cambodian insurgents as a means of keeping the

 Soviets and their allies in check.  By the same token, they remain supporters of a strong
 NATO as a counterweight to the USSR.  In Northeast Asia, Beijing would like the United
 States and Japan to make some overtures to North Korea to help China counter the
 recent increase in Soviet influence in Pyongyang.  Chinese leaders continue to urge
 Washington in particular to agree to hold tripartite talks with North and South Korea as
 a means of reducing Moscow's ability to exploit tensions on the peninsula.
