 Perspective             IMF/World Bank Meeting: International Monetary Reform
 Renewed debtor dissatisfaction with current international monetary arrange-
 ments has bolstered Third World resolve to urge reform during the annual
 IMF meeting next month in Seoul. Developing countries argue that sluggish
 world growth and their heavy debt burden-aggravated by high real interest
 rates, falling export prices, and net capital outflows-threaten established
 monetary relations with industrial countries. For the first time, LDCs have
 submitted proposed modifications for formal consideration by the IMF Interim
 Committee. The industrial countries will be pressured to address these LDC
 criticisms of the international monetary system:
 ? Volatile exchange rates have discouraged world trade and investment in
 developing countries needed to service foreign debt. Although developing
 countries favor eventually establishing target zones for exchange rates, they
 intend in the meantime to press major industrial countries to coordinate
 macroeconomic policies by submitting to an explicit consultation process
 with the IMF.
 ? Increased economic interdependence has placed the burden of international
 adjustment on developing countries. The Third World believes that the Fund
 should tighten surveillance over the monetary and fiscal policies of industrial
 countries and promote economic growth as an integral part of LDC
 adjustment, partly by easing the adjustment measures attached to interna-
 tional lending.
 ? International liquidity is insufficient. Developing countries favor augment-
 ing the loan base of the IMF and the World Bank, and they plan to demand
 increased access to cheaper credit from multilateral institutions.
 Although the industrial countries share LDC concerns about key features of
 the monetary system-especially exchange rate volatility-most have agreed
 to block major institutional reform. Instead, they hope to reduce exchange rate
 fluctuations by improving the effectiveness of existing, informal coordination
 of macroeconomic policies-a strategy they jointly approved this summer.
 Consistent and sound macroeconomic policies in industrial countries would
 foster greater private lending-argue the United States, West Germany, and
 the United Kingdom-easing pressures to increase international liquidity with
 official funds.

 Although most industrial countries intend to listen sympathetically to the
 Third World proposals, we expect the LDCs to achieve little in Seoul.
 Developing countries may try to exploit differences of opinion existing among
 individual industrial countries to encourage movement toward monetary
 reform. France and Italy, in particular, provide a friendly ear to LDC lobbying
 for target zones and formal macroeconomic consultation with the IMF.
 Nevertheless, we believe the industrial countries will postpone indepth discus-
 sion of monetary reform, probably until the Fund's meeting next spring.
 The LDC proposals-if adopted-could complicate policymaking and put
 increased financial burden on the United States. Relations with allies could be
 strained as US policymakers face greater accountability to other industrial
 and developing countries under formal IMF consultations to coordinate
 macroeconomic policy. Increasing international liquidity through official
 channels would require greater US financial contributions to the IMF and the
 IBRD. LDC resistance to conditionality also could further reduce commercial
 bank lending to debtors, prompting calls from developing countries to make up
 the difference with US official assistance.

 Latin America: Status of
 IMF-Supported Adjustment
 Programs
 Peruvian President Garcia's outright refusal to
 negotiate with the Fund and Brazil's resistance to
 accept what it views as too rigid IMF conditions
 may portend a growing tendency in the region to
 challenge Fund prescriptions. The risk of a formal
 regionwide break with the Fund is not high. Al-
 though some of the region's debtors have made
 recent progress in reviving their IMF programs, we
 believe some Latin American leaders will continue
 to try to persuade the IMF to ease up on perfor-
 mance criteria. Failure to reconcile differences
 would undermine the IMF's central role in resolv-
 ing the debt problems of the region and may oblige
 creditors to review their approach to the debt issue.
 Staying With IMF Programs
 Argentina and the IMF reached agreement on a
 new set of targets in June, after three months of
 difficult negotiations. The agreement called for a
 lowering of inflation to 8 percent per month by the
 first quarter of 1986 and for a drastic reduction in
 the budget deficit. The Alfonsin government has
 moved with unaccustomed swiftness in devaluing
 the currency 15.2 percent, raising public service
 and energy prices, freezing wages and prices, and
 promising to discontinue printing money to finance
 budget deficits. Despite the flexibility built into the
 new inflation and nominal monetary targets, we
 believe the difficulties of increasing budget reve-
 nues and decreasing spending may require the
 government to seek performance waivers from the
 IMF later this year.
 In Uruguay, the Sanguinetti government also has
 revived its agreement with the Fund. According to
 press reports, IMF Managing Director de Larosiere
 has given tentative approval to an 18-month,
 $120 million standby arrangement in which Monte-
 video pledged to bring its fiscal deficit as a share of
 GDP down from 10 to 6 percent, to lower inflation
 to 60 percent from the current 78 percent, and to
 maintain a floating exchange rate. The prospective
 IMF package is enabling Uruguay to negotiate
 with its foreign commercial banks-which have
 agreed to roll over principal repayments until the
 end of September-for $130 million in new money
 and a debt rescheduling.
 Several other Latin American debtors have reached
 agreements with the IMF in the last several
 months:
 ? After a six-month stalemate, Chile's debt pack-
 age was helped along when the IMF agreed in
 principle on 15 July to a new three-year program
 providing $850 million in assistance. This agree-
 ment, whose first disbursement of $140 million is
 likely this month, cleared the way for a 17 July
 Paris Club rescheduling of $170 million and
 spurred progress on the commercial bank pack-
 age-currently over 90 percent complete.
 ? Panama received an $88 million, 21-month IMF
 standby arrangement, and its $877 million com-
 mercial bank refinancing package is nearly com-
 plete.
 Straying From The Fold
 Rising foreign payments problems and large budget
 overruns have pushed Mexico out of compliance
 with IMF targets. Mexico's oil price cuts and
 export declines will reduce 1985 petroleum export
 earnings by about $1.5 billion from last year's level.
 Moreover, the $2 billion capital flight during the
 first half of 1985 was double the amount for all of
 last year. At the same time, the overvaluation of
 the peso has cut nonoil exports by more than 16
 percent and contributed to the surge in imports,
 which rose some 39 percent in the first quarter of

 this year compared with the same period in 1984.
 Finally, the government's politically motivated pre-
 election stimulation of the economy has caused a
 larger-than-expected budget deficit, the reduction
 maturing debt payments and short-term credits.
 With the present favorable trade surplus and ade-
 quate foreign exchange reserves, Brazil should be
 able to avoid problems in servicing its debt over the
 of which was a key IMF target.
 President de la Madrid so far has been unwilling to
 take the necessary measures to put Mexico back
 into compliance with performance targets. Recent
 government projections indicate that economic aus-
 terity measures announced in late July and early
 August will not significantly trim the budget deficit
 for the year below some 8 to 9 percent of GDP. The
 same study also indicates that inflation for 1985
 would be about 60 percent. Both figures are far in
 excess of IMF criteria and therefore jeopardize
 Mexico's final two drawings from the Fund.
 Brazil announced measures in early July to reduce
 the projected $18 billion public-sector deficit for
 this year, but the cuts were substantially smaller
 than those sought by the IMF. Negotiations with
 the Fund reached an impasse in August, and
 President Sarney
 was reluctant to make additional budget cuts be-
 cause of intense domestic political pressure to
 continue recovery. Instead, Sarney's chief economic
 adviser announced publicly on 13 August that
 Brazil would seek a "shadow agreement" under
 which the IMF would evaluate the results of
 Brasilia's program at the end of the year
 Recent changes in Brazil's economic team will
 make a reconciliation with the IMF and negotia-
 tions with creditors even more difficult, in our view.
 In late August, Sarney replaced Finance Minister
 Dornelles with Dilson Funaro, who has consistently
 opposed tough austerity measures and criticized
 IMF policies. We believe that Brasilia probably
 will not conclude a new agreement until after the
 mid-November municipal elections in order to pre-
 vent the opposition from exploiting this sensitive
 issue. Although the impasse with the IMF is caus-
 ing concern among bankers
 the immediate financial repercus-
 sions will likely be mild. According to the US
 Embassy, Brazil secured a 140-day rollover of
 Peru's President Garcia, inaugurated on 28 July,
 apparently remains committed to his pledge that he
 will not submit to a Fund accord and will limit
 foreign debt repayments to 10 percent of export
 earnings over the next 12 months. Peruvian offi-
 cials have also requested a rollover of long-term
 debts maturing between July 1985 and 31 January
 1986, according to the US Embassy. Garcia's
 public statements are impeding the resumption of
 debt negotiations, as many US and West European
 banks reportedly insist that no debt rescheduling  25X1
 talks can occur until Peru accepts an IMF-
 supported economic stabilization program.
 A Murky Outlook
 25X1
 25X1
 Despite some recent rumblings among Latin debt-
 ors about radical action, we believe most regional
 leaders recognize that IMF-supported stabilization
 programs are essential to retain the cooperation of
 creditors. As they balance economic imperatives    25X1
 against political realities, however, they probably
 will take increasingly tougher stands on IMF rec-
 ommendations. The Latin debtors probably will use
 the October IMF/World Bank meetings to cress
 for additional concessions from the Fund
 Nonetheless, Garcia's refusal to negotiate with the
 Fund because of the potential social consequences
 reflects the increasing politicization of the debt
 issue. On the one hand, his tougher line with the
 IMF could generate domestic acquiescence to addi-
 tional belt-tightening measures. This could eventu-
 ally set the stage for a self-imposed stabilization
 program-monitored by the IMF-that would     25X1

 Tougher Action on Debt?
 Although we still believe a Latin American debtors
 cartel is not in the cards over the near term, the
 risk remains that these countries could begin opt-
 ingfor radical action. In recent weeks, we have
 detected some disturbing indications that a tough-
 er political approach may be in the offing:
 ? Based on US Embassy reports, we believe Peru's
 President Garcia will not hesitate to use public
 forums such as the UN General Assembly and
 Nonaligned Movement to push for better repay-
 ment terms, increased aid flows, and a political
 dialogue with creditors on the debt issues.
 ? President Lusinchi of Venezuela is under strong
 pressure from the political opposition and labor
 groups to scuttle the multiyear agreement negoti-
 ated with the bank advisory committee. Domes-
 tic critics argue that declining oil revenues neces-
 sitate a reopening of negotiations. We believe,
 however, Lusinchi is determined to go ahead with
 the scheduled September signing of the agree-
 ment and worry about any need to renegotiate
 later.
 cease financial support; this could quickly create
 serious economic and political problems for the new
 government
 Brazil may represent still another subtle test to the
 Fund's central role in regional debt adjustment.
 After the November elections, Sarney probably will
 relent in his opposition to tight austerity measures
 to clear the way for a new Fund agreement in 1986.
 There is a small possibility, however, that Sarney
 may propose a shadow role for the IMF and press
 commercial lenders for financial assistance without
 a formal program. Brasilia could seek something
 resembling Venezuela's arrangement, in which the
 Fund blesses a homegrown stabilization program
 and monitors progress through semiannual consul-
 tations. Such an approach dampens nationalistic
 sensitivities toward IMF prescriptions, while offer-
 ing bankers some assurance that a reasonable
 stabilization program is in effect.

 If Brazil persuades the banks to cooperate, other
 Latin American debtors, particularly Mexico, may
 be encouraged to negotiate directly with bankers in
 seeking additional debt relief. Bankers accordingly
 might have to choose between continued financial
 assistance on the basis of each country's self-
 imposed stabilization program or cutting credit to
 the region. The latter would strain repayment
 capabilities and heighten prospects for a revolt by
 debtor nations.

 Plunging Commodity Prices
 Increasing LDC
 Financial Strains
 The dramatic five-year fall in prices of nonoil
 commodities and resulting export earnings losses
 have been particularly stressful for key LDC debt-
 ors.' Most of these countries are highly dependent
 on a few commodities to earn the bulk of foreign
 exchange needed to service their debts and import
 capital goods for development purposes. We esti-
 mate that this year's drop in commodity prices
 could cost the major LDC debtors $4.5 billion in
 export revenue this year. LDC oil exporters who
 also rely on nonoil commodity exports will be the
 hardest hit. For 1986 a modest recovery in nonoil
 prices will be more than offset by continued de-
 clines in oil prices, and the LDCs will suffer
 another, although less severe, drop in revenues.
 Sizing Up the Decline
 Nonoil commodity prices, measured in US dollars,
 have fallen by 30 percent since their peak in 1980
 while oil prices are down 19 percent from their
 1981 high. An index of industrial materials prices
 shows a 33-percent drop since 1980, including a
 drop of 11 percent through the first eight months of
 1985 alone. Food prices have fallen 27 percent
 since 1980 and 12 percent so far in 1985. In both
 cases, the recovery from the 1981-83 recession has
 been unusually weak and unsustained.

 Metals have been hardest hit. Although some
 prices currently show a slight improvement over
 1984 levels, the potential for future gains appears
 modest. Inventory overhangs and the strong dollar
 are keeping the dollar prices of metals from rising
 significantly. Even though inventories are begin-
 ning to decline, production capacity still greatly
 exceeds demand-which has not exhibited the

 metals
 growth experienced in previous recoveries. Despite
 depressed markets, LDC producers have not re-
 duced output because of the need to maintain
 revenue and employment. In fact, the strong dollar
 permits the LDCs to produce and sell at a profit
 even at current low prices, further increasing the
 incentive to maintain production. For example,

 Copper. Prices rose 9 percent from yearend 1984
 levels, but remain well below peak 1980 levels. A
 recent buildup of stocks on the London Metals
 Exchange (LME) has kept prices relatively flat. A
 glut of producing capacity along with lower eco-
 nomic growth rates of major copper importers,
 especially the United States, will keep prices from
 rising significantly through 1986.
 Aluminum. Although cutbacks in production have
 continued and inventories have declined, prices
 have slid about 7 percent since the beginning of the
 year. Prices for the rest of this year will not rise
 above current levels, and a modest recovery is
 expected in 1986 assuming continued consumption
 increases and production cutbacks.
 Tin. Prices are currently roughly 8 percent above
 yearend 1984 levels, largely because of the decline
 of the dollar. Nonetheless, the market remains
 oversupplied due to overproduction, large world
 stocks, and declining usage, and average prices for
 the year will be below the 1984 level. Industry
 forecasters estimate decreases in world inventories
 of approximately 16 percent and 20 percent for
 1985 and 1986, respectively, but global stocks
 would still amount to about 5 months of non-
 Communist annual consumption. This large over-
 hang of inventories along with increased produc-
 tion by nonmembers of the International Tin
 Council (ITC) will put downward pressure on
 prices.
 Silver. Prices hit a three-year low in March and
 have since rebounded but remain 25 percent below
 the 1984 average price. A world surplus of 54
 million ounces is expected in 1985 as industrial
 demand will not keep pace with the growth in
 supply. Nonetheless
 ]prices could rebound somewhat in 1986.
 Chile produces copper at about 40 cents per pound,
 well below the current price of 65 cents per pound.
 Record harvests, huge stocks, and weak demand
 are currently putting downward pressure on LDC
 agricultural prices. Competition from developed
 countries, particularly the EC, has been strong,
 and, in the grain market, for example, some tradi-
 tional importers, such as China and India, have
 begun to export grain. With Soviet and LDC
 demand at low ebb, prospects for a turnaround
 remain distant.
 Implications for Key LDC Debtors
 According to our analysis the drop in key commod-
 ity prices could cost the major LDC debtors $4.5
 billion in export revenue this year-about 4 percent
 of overall export earnings-with several countries
 likely to record substantial declines. Oil exporters,
 especially those with significant nonoil commodity
 exports, probably will be hardest hit:
 ? Lower oil prices, as well as slumping prices for
 palm oil and rubber, are likely to cost Malaysia
 nearly $1 billion in export earnings this year, and
 Indonesia about $500 million in export revenue.
 ? Mexico could suffer a loss of over $1 billion, due
 to the drop in oil prices and weakness in the
 markets for its agricultural and seafood exports.
 Losses in 1985 will not be as large for the nonoil
 exporters, but several countries could experience a
 significant drop in export revenue. Lower corn,
 beef, and wheat prices will cost Argentina more
 than $300 million in export earnings. Brazil's ex-
 port losses could reach $600 million, primarily due
 to a sharp drop in soybean prices. Plunging prices
 for coconut products likely will slash Philippine
 exports by $160 million. Only Chile and Colombia
 are likely to post export gains, and these will be
 modest at best. In the case of Chile, copper prices
 will rise only moderately for the year as a whole,

 Agricultural Market Trends
 Grain. Wheat prices in nominal terms are at their
 lowest levels since 1978 and in real terms at their
 lowest since the early 1930s. Prices have fallen
 almost 20 percent in 1985 alone. The dropoff in
 corn, rice, and soybean prices has been similarly
 steep. While the strong dollar has accounted for
 some of this decline, overproduction, in the face of
 weak global demand is the dominant factor.
 Sugar. World sugar prices have been hovering near
 a 15-year low and until global stocks are reduced
 world prices should remain depressed. Latin
 American and Asian sugar exporters with access to
 the premium priced US quota market will also
 experience earnings losses as US quota imports
 continue to contract.
 Coffee. A record global coffee harvest is currently
 forecast by USDA for 1985/86, contributing to this
 year's 8 percent price dip and adding to already
 burdensome stock levels. LDC exporters, short of
 domestic storage and critically in need of export
 earnings, have been unloading surplus coffee to
 nonmembers of the International Coffee Organiza-
 tion at one-half the price paid by members. Unless
 the growing two-tier price market for coffee is
 resolved, LDC coffee earnings could slip in 1986 on
 a further weakening of prices.
 Cotton. The global cotton market continues to
 slump, with trade volumes declining and a high
 stock overhang depressing prices to 10-year lows.
 Weakness in the cotton market signals slowing
 growth in export earnings for key debtors such as
 Brazil and Mexico as well as Pakistan and Sudan.
 and prices for premium Colombian coffee should
 remain relatively stable despite large outstanding
 global stocks. In addition, prices for fruits and
 vegetables-major commodity exports for both
 countries-will, at best, rise slightly

 Declining commodity prices and the resulting loss
 of export revenue are restraining potential import
 gains this year for oil-exporting key debtors. In
 turn, slower import growth will contribute to re-
 duced real GNP gains in Indonesia and Malaysia,
 while in Mexico lower export revenue is aggravat-
 ing debt-servicing problems. Nigeria remains mired
 in economic stagnation as falling oil revenues force
 further import cutbacks.'

 a The impacts presented are calculated as the annual percent
 change in the price of each of the top commodity exports (including
 petroleum exports) for each country, multiplied by the country's
 annual exports of these commodities, and summed. Export volume
 is assumed to be unchanged.
 The outlook for 1986 is more optimistic for the
 nonoil exporters-private forecasts indicate a mod-
 est recovery in the prices of most nonoil commod-
 ities. Oil prices, however, are forecast to decline
 further, adversely affecting oil-exporting key debt-
 ors. As a result, we believe that the group of key
 debtors as a whole will suffer an overall loss of
 export revenue due to changing commodity prices,
 although the magnitude of the drop will be much
 smaller than in 1985:
 ? Modest increases in tin, silver, and zinc prices
 should boost Bolivian export revenue.

 ? Chile will benefit from improved prices for cop-
 per, fruits, and vegetables.
 ? Stable coffee prices and higher fruit and vegeta-
 ble prices are likely to boost Colombian exports.
 ? Prices for Peru's major commodity exports-
 silver, fishmeal, zinc, and lead-should rise.
 On the other hand, continued weak prices for wheat
 and corn will limit export gains in Argentina, and a
 further decline in the price of coconut products will
 retard Philippine export growth.

 Among oil-exporting key debtors the outlook for
 1986 is less optimistic, especially for those coun-
 tries with few nonoil commodity exports. An addi-
 tional $1 fall in oil prices could cost Nigeria and
 Venezuela over $400 million in export earnings
 next year. Mexican losses could total over $300
 million. Indonesia and Malaysia, however, will
 benefit from a modest recovery in the prices for
 rubber and timber. As a result, their export losses
 will be sharply reduced compared to 1985, despite
 lower oil prices and continued weakness in the palm
 oil market0
 Beyond 1986 the outlook is for continued weakness
 in commodity prices based on both secular and
 cyclical trends. According to Chase Econometrics,
 OECD GDP growth will average slightly below 3
 percent through 1990-holding down demand
 growth for industrial metals and failing to alleviate
 the surplus capacity problem. Similarly, the de-
 mand for agricultural products-especially grain-
 will be throttled by slow economic growth in the
 LDCs and continued overplanting in the United
 States, Canada, Australia, the EC, and Argentina.
 While the dollar may continue to decline, it proba-
 bly will remain strong relative to the early 1970s
 when commodity prices soared. These trends will
 cause continuation of earnings difficulties for
 LDCs who count on commodities for about 40
 percent of their export revenues

 Secret
 Libya's expulsion of thousands of foreign nationals
 since early August threatens to destabilize Tunisia
 and is causing less severe problems for Egypt and
 several other regional states. A primary reason for
 the deportations is the sharp falloff in Libya's oil
 revenues that has necessitated cuts in the use of
 costly foreign labor. Libyan leader Qadhafi, howev-
 er, probably is taking advantage of the expulsions
 to cover the infiltration of Libyan-trained dissi-
 dents into neighboring states. We believe he will
 use the dissidents to try to undermine an orderly
 presidential succession in Tunisia and to exploit
 any domestic unrest generated by deteriorating
 economic conditions in Tunisia and Egypt. Qadha-
 fi's actions, however, have heightened regional re-
 solve to contain him and will exacerbate Libya's
 already serious economic problems
 Qadhafi's Motives
 Qadhafi's sudden expulsion of some 65,000 Tuni-
 sians, Egyptians, Syrians, Nigeriens, Malians, and
 other foreign nationals-about 13 percent of
 Libya's foreign population-since 5 August under-
 scores his growing security concerns and Libya's
 mounting economic difficulties. The expulsions
 probably are, in part, intended to reduce the inter-
 nal security threat in Libya by drawing down the
 number of foreign residents from countries Qadhafi
 States in June, US Bright Star excercises with
 Egypt, as well as Qadhafi's perception of growing
 US influence in regional and Arab affairs are the
 keys to the timing of the recent bout of deporta-
 tions.
 A primary reason for the foreign personnel cuts,
 however, is to reduce the $2.4 billion Tripoli spends
 on foreign labor-almost 30 percent of the work
 force at the end of 1984. Tripoli will save as much
 as $550 million annually in worker remittances and
 support costs from the reductions so far

 Foreign Nationals Expelled From
 Libya Since 5 August 1985 a
 Total
 Tunisia
 Libya's dependence on foreign expertise to keep its
 small modern economy operating precludes the
 deportation of all foreign workers at this time, but
 the expulsion of select groups of expatriates proba-
 bly will continue for several months. Qadhafi has
 maintained since 1982 that Libya cannot afford the
 luxury of foreigners performing menial jobs, which
 he claims should be done by Libyans. For the
 moment Tripoli is exempting highly skilled person-
 nel, including doctors and technicians in petroleum
 and other key sectors, from deportation. The expul-
 sion campaign has targeted unskilled workers, in-
 cluding large numbers of bakers, agricultural la-
 borers, garbage collectors, and construction
 workers. The regime has confiscated the personal
 property and funds of those deported, which proba-
 bly will be used to redress shortages of consumer
 goods and dwindling foreign exchange reserves.
 Libya has used the expulsion of workers as a
 diplomatic weapon since the early 1970s as well as
 a vehicle for positioning Libyan agents and sympa-
 thizers. Large numbers of Tunisians were expelled
 in 1976 after the Libyan-Tunisian union failed and
 again in 1979 following an offshore boundary
 dispute. Moreover, in a 1 September speech, Qa-
 dhafi reiterated his threat to punish any Arab ruler
 who officially visits the United States or has what
 Qadhafi views as an unacceptably close relation-
 ship with Washington.
 The Regional Impact
 Tunisia has borne the brunt of the recent round of
 deportations and faces its most serious domestic
 crisis since the January 1984 bread riots. Over
 30,000 workers have been returned so far. Tunis
 has retaliated by expelling 30 Libyan diplomats
 and 250 other Libyans, closing the Libyan cultural
 center, reinstating visa requirements, putting some
 military units in the south on alert, and ordering
 home all remaining Tunisians in Libya. Moreover,
 US Embassy sources claim that Algeria has
 pledged military support to President Bourguiba in
 the event of Libyan hostilities
 The expulsion of all Tunisian workers could cost
 Tunis as much as $140 million annually in worker
 remittances, lost trade, and added outlays for nec-
 essary social services. In addition, we estimate that
 unemployment would jump from August's 22 per-
 cent level to near 30 percent.
 The loss of income and increase in unemployment
 would almost certainly derail the regime's plans to
 reduce the trade deficit and burdensome consumer
 subsidies-critical items in government efforts to
 secure foreign financing and maintain the upper
 hand in labor negotiations. A large pool of unem-
 ployed workers would be available to support labor
 demonstrations against the government plans to
 hold the line on wages and raise staple food prices.
 Tunisia's powerful labor union has postponed
 promised strike activity so far, but has given notice
 that new agitation is likely this fall in response to
 continued government intransigence, according to
 the US Embassy in Tunis.
 The US Embassy in Cairo says the government is
 bracing for the return of as many as 50,000
 Egyptian workers from Libya-mostly unskilled
 laborers-by the end of the year. More than 10,000

 Secret
 Egyptians have been expelled since 5 August and
 another 30,000 workers had returned since the
 beginning of the year. The government has taken
 special precautions to prevent the infiltraton of
 Libyan subversives. Although doctors and other
 skilled professionals reportedly are exempt from
 Qadhafi's expulsion order, many are leaving of
 their own accord.
 Cairo's public welcome of returning Egyptian
 workers masks official concern that the shaky
 economy cannot accommodate such an influx. Real
 GDP growth of 5 percent barely covers the annual
 increase in the domestic labor force. Government
 bonus payments to workers and a massive subsidy
 program helps to cushion the effect of the economic
 malaise, but puts a heavy burden on national

 ... May Backfire
 Libya's efforts to destabilize Tunisia have served to
 strengthen ties between Tunis and Algiers. The US
 Embassy in Algiers says that President Bendjedid
 and Bourguiba have agreed to coordinate military
 strategy toward Libya. While military cooperation
 between the two states probably has not gone much
 beyond contingency planning, Algeria does seem to
 have made a firm decision to buttress Tunisia with
 diplomatic, economic, and military assistance.
 Moreover, Libya's actions have heightened Cairo's
 longstanding antipathy toward Qadhafi.
 Qadhafi's drawdown of foreign workers may also
 increase discontent among Libyans over deteriorat-
 ing living standards. Many stores-especially bak-
 eries-have been forced to close since the expul-
 sions began, worsening food shortages in some    25X1
 areas of Tripoli. Moreover, previous attempts by
 the regime to force Libyans to perform menial
 work such as garbage collection have resulted in
 serious sanitation problems and the spread of dis-
 ease because of popular disdain for such work. A
 dramatic and sudden deterioration in local life-
 styles will accelerate the creation of a climate
 favorable to a move by Libyan exiles or domestic
 opponents.                                25X1

 Secret
 the Communist LDCs '
 Moscow continues to reap major political and
 strategic benefits in return for its hefty economic
 assistance to Communist LDCs (CLDCs). Al-
 though Soviet economic assistance has remained at
 roughly the same level over the past four years,
 Moscow is pressing the CLDCs to live up to
 commitments to provide the USSR with goods and
 raw materials. Cuba absorbs about two-thirds of
 the total while Vietnam and Mongolia account for
 the bulk of the rest. In return for Moscow's sub-
 stantial economic help Cuba and Vietnam provide
 the Soviet military with much needed port and air
 facilities. Politically, the CLDCs continue to sup-
 port Moscow in the UN and other international
 organizations.
 to 1984, the subsidy on sugar increased from $1.4
 billion to over $3.4 billion-more than offsetting
 the decline in the oil subsidy
 Direct economic aid, in the form of credits to either
 finance Soviet development projects or cover trade
 imbalances, comprises the rest of Soviet economic
 assistance.' Unlike trade subsidies, however-
 where Cuba received virtually the entire amount-
 Cuba, Vietnam, and Mongolia each received
 roughly equal amounts accounting for about 90
 percent of the total:
 Roughly 50 percent of Soviet economic assistance
 to the CLDCs in recent years has been in the form
 of subsidized prices for both exports and imports.
 Cuba is the major recipient of the largess. Soviet oil
 sales are the principal source of trade subsidies, but
 the value of this subsidy varies because Moscow
 bases oil prices on the world average of the preced-
 ing five years. As a result of steeply rising world oil
 prices in 1979 and 1980, the value of the Cuban oil
 subsidy increased markedly, peaking at $1.7 billion
 in 1981. While world oil prices have fallen since
 1982, however, the price charged by the Soviets has
 increased, and this subsidy nearly disappeared in
 1984.
 Prices for imports of Cuban sugar and nickel also
 are set annually, but are not tied to world prices. In
 recent years, Moscow has sharply increased the
 price it pays for Cuban sugar, apparently to com-
 pensate Cuba for rising oil prices. Thus, from 1981
 ? Cuba: Of the $1 billion in Soviet direct economic
 aid to Cuba during 1984, roughly one-half went
 to finance major development projects, including
 the Punta Gorda and Cam I nickel plants, the
 Santiago textile factory, and the Havana thermal
 power station. The remainder went to finance the
 trade deficit. Despite increased Cuban oil produc-
 tion, Moscow provided Havana with 90 percent of
 its oil requirements in 1984.
 ? Vietnam: The troubled economy of Vietnam also
 relied heavily on direct Soviet economic aid dur-
 ing 1984-roughly two-thirds of which was trade
 credits for the purchase of raw materials, petro-
 leum products, and essential industrial commod-
 ities. Vietnam's agricultural sector was especially
 dependent on Moscow for fertilizers, fuels and
 lubricants, and pesticides.

 ry. There is little direct information on the amount of this support,

 ? Mongolia Soviet economic aid to Mongolia in
 1984 was just under $800 million. Under the
 terms of a five-year economic and technical
 cooperation agreement for 1981-85, the Soviets
 continued to supply aid for several major Mongo-
 lian development projects, including nonferrous
 metals extraction, agricultural development, and
 civil construction projects-primarily housing
 and buildings.
 ? North Korea The Soviet Union's relationship
 with North Korea is more commercially oriented
 reflecting the more restrained political ties be-
 tween Moscow and P'yongyang. Indeed, North
 Korea's merchandise exports to the USSR were
 $25 million more than imports in 1984. Even so,
 North Korea continued to benefit not only from
 subsidized oil prices but also from credits extend-
 ed earlier to assist in the construction of industri-
 al development projects.
 Hard Currency Support
 In addition to trade subsidies and direct economic
 aid, the Soviet Union has helped the CDLCs,
 primarily Cuba, cope with a severe shortage of
 hard currency. During 1984, Havana received al-
 most $800 million in this type of aid. To this end,
 Moscow has:
 ? Purchased sugar and other commodities for hard
 currency outside the trade protocol.
 ? Allowed Cuba to reexport a portion of the
 12 million tons of oil it provided.

 of grain Canada has shipped to Cuba annually
 since 1980 but has allowed Havana to repay in
 soft currency, saving it about $200 million in
 hard currency for 1984.
 The USSR also provided Vietnam with hard cur-
 rency support by acting as an intermediary for
 Hanoi's purchases of grain from Australia. Moscow
 pays Canberra hard currency for grain shipped to
 Vietnam, while charizing the Vietnamese soft cur-
 rency.
 The Soviet Side of the Ledger
 The USSR receives substantial political, strategic,
 and economic benefits in return for its economic
 assistance. Cuba remains the USSR's most impor-
 tant asset in the Western Hemisphere, while both
 the Cubans and Vietnamese provide the Soviet
 military with much-needed port and air facilities.
 Politically, the CLDCs continue to support Moscow
 in the UN and other international organizations.
 Castro, in particular, has been aggressive in
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/03/07: CIA-RDP97-00771 R000807700001-0
 promoting the Soviet Union's political position on
 various international issues and in defending
 Moscow in the Nonaligned Movement.
 To a lesser extent, Soviet aid to these countries has
 benefitted Moscow economically. By gearing its
 assistance to those projects that will result in
 increased exports, Moscow obtains foodstuffs, raw
 materials, and other needed commodities. In addi-
 tion, Moscow's assistance for energy-related pro-
 jects in recent years should help reduce future oil
 exports to the CLDCs-presently about 6 percent
 of total Soviet oil exports-freeing up additional oil
 for consumption or hard currency sales. The USSR
 is helping to locate and extract coal, oil, and gas in
 a number of the CLDCs-notably Vietnam and
 Cuba. In addition, the Soviet Union began assisting
 Cuba in the construction of a nuclear power station
 that Havana claims will reduce oil costs
 $120 million annually per reactor.
 Looking to the Future
 Despite the benefits it receives, Moscow continues
 to press the CLDCs to give more in return for its
 economic aid. At the CEMA heads of government
 meeting last November, Moscow again insisted
 that Havana begin meeting targets for exports to
 CEMA countries on which it has fallen short in
 recent years. The Soviets also persisted in their
 calls for Hanoi to increase the production of export
 goods, taking into account the needs of the Soviet
 economy.
 Officials in a number of the CLDCs, however-
 notably Cuba and Vietnam-have complained
 about Moscow's focus on those projects that will
 lead to increased exports of raw materials and
 agricultural goods to the USSR. The CLDCs have
 indicated a preference for Moscow to gear its
 project aid more toward industrial development-
 with its long-term benefits-rather than the extrac-
 tion of limited natural resources]
 Despite the complaints voiced by both sides, how-
 ever, we look for no fundamental change in the
 pattern of Soviet economic aid. Given the sub-
 stantial benefits it receives-and the poor state of
 the CLDCs economies-Moscow probably will be
 unwilling to trim its economic aid for fear of
 exacerbating economic problems in the CLDCs.
 Indeed, in the case of Cuba and Vietnam, where
 Moscow receives its greatest political and strategic
 returns-some increase in economic aid seems like-
 ly. The recent signing of the 1986-90 trade and aid
 agreement with Vietnam, for example, reportedly
 calls for a doubling of aid during this period
 compared to 1981-85 and may reflect, at least
 partially, payment for the Soviet use of Cam Ranh
 Bay. Similarly, Soviet deliveries for a new nuclear
 power plant in Cuba could run into several hundred
 million dollars over the next few years, possibly
 resulting in some increase in total aid during this
 period. Finally, Soviet-North Korean political rela-
 tions have improved over the past year or so, and it
 is possible that this warming trend will result in
 increased Soviet economic assistance as North Ko-
 rea prepares to launch its new long-term economic
 plan next year
 From the CLDCs perspective, these countries have
 few alternatives but to seek as much Soviet assis-
 tance as possible. Substantial aid from Western
 sources is unlikely in the near term as is any
 appreciable amount of foreign investment because
 of the poor condition of their economies.

 Venezuela's decision in late July to cut the prices of its heavy grades of crude
 oil by about $2-to $21 to $24 per barrel-paid off last month in a sharp in-

 The price cut was prompted by similar moves by other producers-especially
 Mexico-which held Venezuelan exports to 978,000 b/d in June and 1.2

 The IMF's Executive Board has postponed until 25 November a decision to

 commitments regarding payments to the Fund during a review in late August.
 A revised budget, which Liberian officials probably hope will buy them time

 non-CARICOM countries. Four of CARICOM's 13 members have yet to
 implement the agreement-despite three deadline postponements-but Trini-
 dad has drawn the most criticism because it is the largest market. To conserve
 its declining foreign reserves, Trinidad has slashed imports from CARICOM
 countries about 30 percent this year, after a decline of 18 percent in 1984. Gre-
 nada and Barbados have expressed the sharpest disapproval of Trinidad's trade
 policies. Barbadian Prime Minister St. John recently even suggested that
 Caribbean governments restrict purchases of Trinidadian products until Port-
 of-Spain relaxes its import restraints. Given its worsening economic problems,
 however, Trinidad is likely to make only token efforts to soften its import
 policies.

 National Developments
 J Canadian Commission       The recent report of the Macdonald Royal Commission on the Canadian
 Supports Free Trade   Economic Union supports a free trade agreement with the United States, but
 With the United States only if Canadian industry and sovereignty can be protected. Proposed safe-
 guards include a 10-year phasein to help Canadian firms adjust to increased
 competition; funds to retrain workers who lose their jobs because of free trade;
 and the exemption of certain industries, such as automobiles. Proposed
 measures to reduce the unemployment rate-essentially by a devaluation of
 the Canadian dollar-would complicate any free trade agreement. The report
 emphasizes that an accord with safeguards would substantially boost Canadi-
 an industrial production, and that all provinces would benefit. Prime Minister
 Mulroney probably regards the study as a vindication of his attempts to
 promote freer trade with the United States, and may attempt to incorporate
 some of its recommendations into a proposal Ottawa will present to Washing-
 ton this fall.

 Even Less Likely         the export sector, probably will strengthen Bonn's resolve not to reflate the     25X1
 economy. The 5-percent jump in the volume of new domestic manufacturing
 orders followed a solid 2-percent gain in the second quarter. Other indicators,
 such as retail sales and business surveys, also point to a pickup in the domestic
 economy. While the government will hold firm to its budget consolidation
 course, some easing of monetary policy is possible. Earlier this month, Finance
 Minister Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Poehl said that they see scope
 for a further drop in interest rates, following the August reduction in the
 discount rate from 4.5 to 4.0 percent.                                   25X1
 talian Budget
 Deficit To Con
 Treasury Minister Goria's latest proposals-increasing indirect taxes, capping
 public-sector wage increases at 6 percent, and cutting welfare spending by
 transferring some government services to the private sector-have met with
 strong opposition from ministers who want neither higher taxes nor cuts in     25X1
 their departments. Infighting over the budget and other contentious issues
 implies that the five-party coalition lacks the political will and cohesiveness to
 push through unpopular austerity measures. In order to reach agreement
 among coalition members, the Cabinet will almost certainly water down
 Goria's proposals, and the logrolling necessary to get the bill through
 parliament by the end of the year will probably weaken the measures to the
 point where they will have little impact on the deficit.           25X1
 I Tian Trade          Relatively strong domestic demand and declining export competitiveness
 elicit Worsens       pushed Italy's trade deficit to $8.5 billion for the first six months of 1985-a
 68-percent increase over the same period last year. Although July's 7.8-percent
 devaluation of the lira is likely to help the trade balance toward the end of the
 year, the sharp increase in the deficit has stepped up industry demands for
 measures to improve Italy's competitiveness. In particular, business leaders are
 pressuring the government to slow inflation by limiting wage gains and
 controlling public spending. Rome's efforts probably will be ineffective,
 however. Moreover, the increasing capital intensity of Italian industry is.
 boosting imports of intermediate and investment goods, and offsetting gains on
 j                     the export side.

 Disagreement within the Cabinet on the 1986 budget will probably stall efforts

 Spanish Unemployment   Registered unemployment in Spain fell in July for the fourth straight month,
 Declines               lowering the unemployment rate to 19.3 percent-down from a peak of 20.2
 percent in March and the lowest rate in 10 months. The Ministry of Labor
 views this as proof of the success of government employment programs, but we
 are more wary. Part of the recent decline is seasonal-activity in the services
 and agricultural sectors usually picks up during the summer months. Never-
 theless, the labor market is much stronger than it was last year. The number of
 unemployed has declined by 27,000 for the first seven months of the year, in
 contrast to an increase of 62,000 during January-July 1984. Additionally, the
 pickup in investment activity in the second quarter was largely responsible for
 an increase of 10,000 workers in the construction industry during July. With
 the seasonal gains in employment now largely past, however, we do not expect
 a further decline in the unemployment rate during 1985.
 Less Developed Countries
 o Rebuild Trade
 Pakistan recently signed a trade agreement with Iran that would restore
 bilateral trade which fell to less than $100 million last year to roughly $400
 million annually. The agreement, to take effect 1 October, provides for a
 doubling of Pakistani imports of Iranian crude oil-to 20,000 b/d-in
 exchange for increased Iranian purchases of Pakistani textiles. The US
 Embassy in Islamabad says that Tehran had threatened to stop purchasing
 Pakistani goods unless Pakistan reduced its trade surplus with Iran. The
 surplus, combined with Iranian displeasure over poor quality Pakistani textiles
 and past violations of trade contracts, were the likely causes of the sharp drop
 in trade last year, from the previous year's $442 million level. The two
 countries probably hope to ease political tensions by improving trade relations.

 oreign Investment in  South Korea approved $207 million in direct foreign investment through mid-
 South Korea Falling                  September-half the total for the same period last year and far off the pace
 needed to hit the overly ambitious $450 million target for 1985. Foreign
 investment last year was a record $419 million but was dominated by two
 projects-a $100 million investment by a US auto manufacturer and a $93
 million addition to a Seoul hotel. Even so, yearend results should compare
 favorably to 1983 approvals of $268 million. Spurred by continued foreign
 investment liberalization, the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and burgeoning high
 technology and automobile industries, direct foreign investment should be
 robust over the next three years, with several projects in the $50-100 million
 range possible. If, however, businessmen perceive that Seoul is mismanaging
 the economy, President Chun is losing his grip on power, or a succession crisis
 is developing, they may balk at additional capital commitments

 rt'rma's Export
 Prospects Worsen
 country's long-term development prospects.
 Burma's exports for the fiscal year which began 1 April are likely to decline
 sharply from last year's level of $375 million, according to the US Embassy.
 Earnings from rice exports-which traditionally account for 40 percent of the
 country's foreign exchange revenues-plummeted 68 percent in the first five
 months of the fiscal year compared with the same period last year. Depressed
 commodity markets-along with Rangoon's poor pricing and marketing
 policies-will put a damper on most of Burma's other exports, as well. As a re-
 sult, Rangoon probably will further curtail imports despite the impact on the
 'Less Czechoslovak    Czechoslovakia's trade with nonsocialist countries-primarily the developed
 Trade With            West-continued its steep slide during the first six months of 1985, down 12
 Nonsocialist Countries percent from the same period a year ago. Its share of total Czechoslovak trade
 is now below 20 percent compared with 30 percent in 1980. First-half exports
 were down 12.4 percent from a year earlier. Because of the downturn in
 exports and continued priority on debt reduction, Prague cut imports by more
 than 11 percent despite plans for a 14-percent increase. This generated a
 robust trade surplus of $427 million, but deprived Czechoslovakia's aging
 industry of badly needed modern plant and equipment. Prague could ease up a
 bit; Czechoslovakia's debt is low, and it has considerable untapped borrowing
 capacity. Nonetheless, the regime apparently feels it must reduce hard
 currency debt to limit its vulnerability to Western political leverage.
 `eather Clouds Grain Recent heavy rains and flooding are causing serious damage to an estimated
 xport Prospects     20 percent of the cropland in China's northeastern provinces, where much of
 the nation's corn-China's major export grain-is grown. A much larger area
 is threatened with less severe damage. Wet weather has also reportedly caused
 moisture and pest damage to stockpiles from last year's bumper crop. A
 weather-induced decline in the quantity of marketable corn could mean China
 will have trouble fully implementing its ambitious plans for expanding grain
 exports to earn foreign currency. Importers of Chinese grain are already
 complaining of delayed deliveries and defaults on contracts. The higher prices
 and lower quality likely to result from China's weather problems could cause
 buyers to seek other sources for corn.
 Beijing Appoints
 New Ministers
 a leading role in promoting economic liberalization.
 Beijing has appointed new heads of the ministries of Labor and Personnel,
 Metallurgical Industry, Geology and Mineral Resources, Public Security, and
 State Security in the second round of high-level changes this year. The       25X1
 changes are another step by Deng Xiaoping toward institutionalizing current
 economic reform policies by appointing younger-their average age is 15 years
 less than their predecessors-better-educated officials. All the new appointees
 have college-level educations and most appear to have solid connections to
 prominent reformers in the party. The replacement of reform economist, Ma
 Hong, with a 67-year-old historian, Hu Sheng, however, suggests that a more
 orthodox tone will prevail at the Academy of Social Sciences, which has taken

 Vietnamese             Vietnam announced severe currency measures on Saturday and canceled all
 Currency Re-form       international flights to prevent an exodus of unofficial gold holdings or other
 forms of wealth. Hanoi allowed individuals five days to register currency
 holdings and set stringent limits on the amount that could be converted into
 new bank notes at a rate of one new note for 10 old ones. The announcement
 did not say how official market prices would be affected or what the new rate
 of exchange with the dollar would be. Hanoi had devalued last April from 10
 dong to 100 dong per dollar to fight inflation and to curb black-market
 currency speculation. Even with strong followup measures, this latest move to
 shore up the sagging economy will have only a limited impact because of
 fundamental shortcomings in industrial and agricultural production and the
 drain of military operations in Cambodia. The move will disrupt foreign
 exchange transactions, including overseas remittances-the country's largest
 source of foreign exchange earnings. The measures also will disrupt some
 black-market activity and deprive unofficial currency holders of some financial
 gains
