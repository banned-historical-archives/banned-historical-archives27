 VIETNAM
 (Mr. MACDONALD (at the request of
 Mr. GETTYS) was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. MACDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I be-
 lieve my colleagues in the House of Rep-
 resentatives will be interested in the ex-
 cellent statement on Vietnam made by
 my friend, Harold W. "Abe" Lincoln,
 candidate for Congress, seeking the Dem-
 ocratic nomination in the new Eighth
 District of Maryland.  "Abe" Lincoln
 formerly served me most ably as admin-
 istrative assistant and in. addition has
 25 years of legislative and executive ex-
 perience in the Government. The char-
 acter and spirit of this man is admirably
 shown by this fine and thoughtful state-
 ment on a subject which has received the
 attention of many of the citizens of our
 country.  It gives me great pleasure to
 share with my colleagues, and I hope
 many other Americans too, "Abe" Lin-
 coln's clear, firm serious treatment of
 the important and serious matter of
 Vietnam :
 [Summary]
 termined use of our strength on behalf of
 principles we stand ready to defend, as in
 Viet Nam today.  But I do not support a
 foreign policy based entirely upon force.  I
 deplore the fact that after Viet Nam we are
 not addressing ourselves to the avenues that
 can and must be explored to prevent the Viet
 Nams of the future.  What is at stake today
 is leadership in Foreign Affairs, just as this
 was the issue in 1960. I intend to be a ques-
 tion asking Congressman to the government
 and a question answering Congressman to
 my constitutents, and I intend to find a
 better answer than we now have about the
 relationship of our interests and our com-
 mitments.  I would urge the House Foreign
 Affairs Committee to conduct a full review
 of our Asian treaty commitments and in this
 context to recognize that the key issue in
 the world today is the problem of Red China.
 Isolation and containment is not the answer
 for the long range future.  Involvement in
 the affairs of the world must be the objec-
 tive.  Just as "windows to the west" were
 finally opened at the end of the Czarist
 Regime in Russia, so must we expand our
 present small steps to tempt China to lessen
 her isolation.  Equally important is the prob-
 lem                                                                  of  proliferation  of  nuclear  weapons.
 Evidence continues to mount that a non-
 proliferation agreement with the Russians is
 within reach. Such a treaty should be vig-
 orously pursued and if inertia exists in the
 State Department, as some suggest on this
 isue, then I would urge President Johnson
 to assume the initiative personally as Presi-
 dent Kennedy did in his American Univer-
 sity speech of June 10, 1963, which led in
 short order  to  the  atmospheric test  ban
 treaty.
 Certainly no freshrhan Congressman can
 solve all the problems, but he should know
 what they are and report his judgment to
 his constituents.
 DEFENSE-FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  THEIR INTERRE-
 LATIONSHIPS-THE ROLE OF A CONGRESSMAN
 Each member of Congress is first a national
 official and as such has a primary responsi-
 bility to work for and promote those meas-
 ures directly related to our National Se-
 curity.  A flexible and viable foreign policy,
 together with a national defense capability
 second to none, are the interrelated compon-
 ents that determine our national security
 interests.  Over 50% of our Federal Budget
 is devoted to direct defense expenditures and
 the conduct of our foreign affairs.  Defense
 today means the war in Viet Nam and my
 position on this issue consistently expressed
 since my announcement on June 28th is as
 follows:
 When national security considerations re-
 quire the commitment of American troops to
 combat, as in Viet Nam today, the President
 of the United States in his Constitutional
 role of Commander-in-Chief of our splendid
 troops shall first as a citizen always have my
 prayers as I believe he will always have by
 the majority of Americans.  As a candidate,
 they have my unqualified support for their
 unrelenting efforts to achieve an honorable
 peace by bilateral negotiations and as your
 Congressman, should I be deemed worthy of
 that position of high trust and responsibility,
 the President, as Commander-in-Chief, re-
 gardless of party affiliation, will always have
 my support when national security consider-
 ations require the commitment of American
 troops in combat when all efforts to keep the
 peace, or restore peace, have failed.
 In determining what our national security
 interests are before troop commitment oc-
 curs, it is the constitutional duty of each
 Congressman to require a hard and specific
 accounting of what precisely our country's
 vital interest are and where they are located.
 The war in Viet Nam has raised far more
 questions  concerning  the  nature  of  our
 treaty alliances in Asia than it has supplied
 answers for the future.  Are they unilateral
 in nature, or do they represent Mutal Assist-
 ance Pacts, as represented.                I support a de-

 air, and land are having on the health
 and welfare of the people of this country.
 Mr. Speaker, environmental pollution
 is not a new problem.  It is one that has
 grown as our population has risen and
 our technology grown more sophisticated.
 For years, apathy and inaction allowed
 the problem of pollution to swell to un-
 foreseen magnitude.                                                                                                                                       However, now, as
 the miserable results have become all
 too obvious, public interest has quick-
 ened, fortunately, and the public is ask-
 ing its representatives to provide leader-
 ship in the abatement of pollution.
 Mr. Speaker, my concern with the
 ,problems and consequences of pollution
 has arisen throug firsthand experience.
 A portion of the Second Congressional
 District of Michigan borders directly on
 Lake Erie.  Public indifference in years
 past has resulted in the contamination
 of the once clean water of this great lake.
 To aid in bringing the problem of
 water pollution to the attention of my
 colleagues, and to the people of the
 United States, I will insert items in the
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD which will serve
 to provide further insight into this major
 national problem.
 As the first part of this series, I insert
 a recent speech made in Detroit on No-
 vember 4, 1965, by Mr. Murray Stein,.
 Acting Assistant Commissioner for En-
 forcement of the Federal Water Pollu-
 tion Control Administration.  Mr. Stein
 relates the consequences of water pollu-
 tion in Lake Erie, his remarks clearly
 point out how imperative it is that im-
 mediate action be taken to redeem this
 national resource.
 THE SECOND BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE
 For both the United States and Canada,
 one of the most lucky consequences of the
 ice  age was  the  formation  of  the Great
 Lakes.  As the giant glaciers began to recede
 and  the  temperatures  rose, about  18,000
 years ago, the first small finger lakes ap-
 peared                                                                                                                                   where the   southern  edges  of  the
 Great Lakes are now.  As the glaciers shrank
 further northward, the Lakes grew to their
 present size.  They are the largest area of
 fresh water in the world, and they have un-
 doubtedly been the single most important
 factor in  the development of the region
 around them.   Were it not for the Great
 Lakes, this region would probably have de-
 veloped as a primarily agricultural economy.
 Instead the Great Lakes region, for both the
 United States and Canada, supports an in-
 dustrialized,                                                                                                                                          multi-faceted   economy.  In
 both countries the Great Lakes regions have
 made an invaluable contribution to the na-
 tional economies, and both retain a tre-
 mendous growth potential.
 Civilizations are conditioned by natural
 resources,  but  not  completely  predeter-
 mined by them.  Not all countries are as
 rich as their natural resources could make
 them.  In some cases men have exploited
 what the earth has given them; in others
 they have let the earth lie fallow.  In the
 early history of the Great Lakes region the
 Indians did not change their mode of exist-
 ence by harnessing the talents of the Lakes.
 The Indians fished the Lakes, used them for
 drinking water and transportation, and left
 the Lakes much as they had found them.
 The potential of the Great Lakes lay wait-
 ing, and their beauty remained undisturbed.
 The Europeans in their expansions west-
 ward  seized  the  Great  Lakes  region  as
 quickly as they could.  In 1615 Samuel de
 Champlain first ventured onto Lake Huron;
 55 years later France owned the entire St.
 Lawrence  River-Great   Lakes region. No

 AMERICAN POW FAMILIES
 (Mr. OLSEN of Montana (at the re-
 quest of Mr. GETTYS) was granted per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. OLSEN of Montana. Mr. Speaker,
 on Wednesday, August 24, 1966, the
 Washington Evening Star published a
 story by John T. Wheeler which shocked
 me and I am sure many other Members
 of Congress as well.  David Brinkley of
 the National Broadcasting Co. news staff
 also commented on this story in the
 Huntley-Brinkley evening news.
 The headline of the story read "Red-
 tape, Indifference Snarl POW's Fami-
 lies,"  It seems that immediately after
 an American serviceman is taken pris-
 oner or is listed as missing a heavy
 burden falls on his wife and family.
 For one thing, the pay of the service-
 man is stopped.  It is frozen, and his
 family is forced to do the best it can
 without any of his pay.  This done pre-
 sumably because the serviceman's status
 is indefinite.  He is not recorded as killed
 in action, so his family cannot receive
 insurance, but he may be dead in which
 case his family cannot receive his pay.
 Wives and families have to leave mili-
 tary bases and thus have a difficult time
 obtaining the free medical care that they
 are entitled to.  There are other prob-
 lems directly traceable to the Federal
 Government as well as State govern-
 ments.  For example, joint tax returns
 con no longer be used because, the hus-
 band is not present.  Many legal prob-
 lems result and the attorney fees, of
 course, have to be paid for by the family
 of the serviceman.  Many men are sent
 to Vietnam on short notice, and there is
 not time for them to arrange for powers
 of attorney for their wives.
 The article leads us to believe that the
 families of servicemen are left alone to
 contend with the bureaucracy and walls
 of red tape because their husbands are
 places in a gray area in relation to Gov-
 ernment regulations.  According to the
 article, a Pentagon spokesman said that
 such problems are "normal things that
 must be put up with when a man is
 missing or captured. Anyone with some-
 one missing in action or captured will
 hit snags."  If this is a normal situation
 with these families, I think the situa-
 tion should be changed.  If a burden has
 to be placed somewhere when there is
 doubt as to a serviceman's status, the
 burden should be placed on the Govern-
 ment and not on widows, wives, or fami-
 lies.  Where there is a choice! between
 the convenience of a Government fi-
 nance officer and that of a family, the
 burden should be shouldered by the fi-
 nance officer.
 I am going to contact the Secretary
 of Defense to see if there is any way that
 the Government can do its share to clean
 up this mess.  If his answer is not sat-
 isfactory, I will ask that the Subcom-
 mittee on Census and Statistics, which is
 continuing its investigation into the
 "paperwork jungle," look into this mat-
 ter and clean up this situation.
 . The article follows, and I ask that it
 be  entered into  the   CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD.
 [From the Washington (D.C.) Evening Star,
 Aug. 24, 19661
 RED   TAPE, INDIFFERENCE SNARL  POWs'
 FAMILIES
 (By John T. Wheeler)
 Wives of U.S. fighting men missing or cap-
 tured in Viet Nam say they sometimes must
 shoulder bewildering burdens because their
 husbands have become legal "nonpersons."
 Some of them contend they have been
 forced to tackle walls of red tape and bu-
 reaucratic indefference in carrying the load.
 When a man is declared missing or cap-
 tured, his status falls into a gray legal area,
 somewhere between alive and dead.  He can-
 not act for himself, and his wife or depend-
 ents can't act for him, except in special
 circumstances.
 THE MAJOR PROBLEMS
 Major complaints reported by next of kin
 include:
 Problems in making ends meet because
 money the  serviceman  had been.  sending
 home stops and the pay he was getting is
 frozen.  It can take weeks or months to
 unfreeze part of it.
 A. federal income tax bureau refused to
 process a joint return unless the wife some-
 how got the signature of her husband, who
 had been shot down over North Viet Nam.
 The same woman had to sell the family car
 because when she moved to a new state she
 couldn't get new license plates without the
 signature.
 Wives and children who are entitled to free
 medical treatment can't get it sometimes in
 emergencies because they are not allowed to
 live on military bases.
 Attorney fees to solve legal problems di-
 rectly related to a missing man's or POW's
 status must be borne by the families.
 CALLED "NORMAL THINGS"
 Only bare-boned, sometimes confusing re-
 ports are issued by the Defense Department
 concerning                    the  fate  of  lost men.  Many
 doubts are cleared up only after families ask
 congressmen for help.
 A Pentagon spokesman said such problems
 are "normal things that must be put up with
 when a man is missing or captured. Anyone
 with someone missing in action or captured
 will hit snags."
 He said the Pentagon does its best to give
 families the full details of casualties.  Com-
 plaints he said must be the exception.
 Each service maintains a casualty assist-
 ance office to help dependents in whatever
 way possible after their men become casual-
 ties, the spokesman said.
 Instances of problems faced by families
 have cropped up in reports from a recently
 formed civilian group seeking to protect
 POWs legal rights, and in interviews with
 some wives.
 Names of the missing men and their fam-
 ilies have been omitted to prevent the Com-
 munists from confronting captured men with
 reports of difficulties encountered by their
 20143
 dependents.  The Defense Department de-
 clines to make public information about the
 men for the same reason.
 One woman who tried to get quick cash
 from the Air Force after her husband was
 shot down reported, "One officer at the base
 told me to go on relief because he couldn't
 give me the money.
 "It was only a couple of weeks before
 Christmas and I said, 'You've got to be kid-
 ding me.'  But he wasn't."
 She had been  getting  a regular  postal
 money order from her husband in addition
 to a monthly allotment of $200, a deduction
 from his pay arranged by the serviceman.
 Told she could not draw against her hus-
 band's pay, which was accumulating in a spe-
 cial account, the woman threatened to go to
 the newspapers.  She also wrote President
 Johnson.  She says she got the money and a
 letter of apology from the Air Force.
 Although the finance officer apparently did
 not know it at first, there is a way to get
 money from accounts set up for POWs and
 missing men.
 But a Pentagon spokesman says this in-
 volves much paper work and a detailed in-
 vestigation from Washington.  He said. there
 is no way for a wife to get immediate cash to
 tide her over until the formalities are com-
 pleted.
 SOCIETY GETS COMPLAINTS
 The troubles of some service wives came to
 light during the past two months after Pat-
 rick McGahn, an Atlantic City, N.J., lawyer,
 formed the Society for the Defense of Amer-
 ican Prisoners.
 McGahn's original interest was in trying
 to get American lawyers  into North Viet
 Nam to defend American fliers, then threat-
 ened with trials as war criminals.
 To ease the threat of red tape, the services
 encourage Viet Nam-bound men to give! their
 wives general powers of attorney-permitting
 them to act for the husband legally no mat-
 ter what comes up.  But some wives report
 this doesn't always solve the problem.
 INCOME TAX RED TAPE
 One wife tried to file a joint federal in-
 come tax return that would have meant a
 sizable refund, badly needed for the house-
 hold expenses.
 Although she had a power of attorney and
 explained that her husband was a POW, the
 Internal Revenue office insisted that hex, hus-
 band sign the form.  After much protest, the
 wife said, the government finally accepted
 the return.
 A Pentagon source said men. who try to
 make out valid powers of attorney from Viet
 Nam cannot do so in 23 states which insist
 that the documents be witnessed by a notary
 public of that state, or have other restric-
 tions.
 Many men are sent to Viet Nam with. only
 a few days notice and don't get around to
 clearing up all their personal affairs.
 Some men balk at filling out powers of
 attorney or assigning nearly all their pay to
 their wives for a variety of reasons.
 One is that an unscrupulous woman could
 put everything in her name and then site for
 divorce.
 Some men have said their wives just don't
 have the needed business sense.  Many de-
 cline to act for the same reason other men
 refuse to make wills.  They don't want to
 admit even indirectly that they may not be
 coming back.
 The Pentagon spokesman said the Army
 has an aggressive and effective program to
 get its men to do their best to insure that
 wives  will  not  run  into  unnecessary
 problems.
 He said the Navy and Air Force have not
 done nearly so well.
 Fringe benefits are a major factor In en-
 couraging men to stay in the services.                                                                                                                                         These

 There is yet time to remedy the situation.

 FARMER AND CONSUMER
 (Mr. LANGEN (at the request of Mr.
 CLARENCE J. BROWN, JR.) was granted
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to Include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. LANGEN.  Mr. Speaker, the ad-
 ministration's decisions on the  1967
 wheat program may mean lower returns
 to producers next year.
 As the House Republican Task Force
 on Agriculture has pointed out, a drop In
 wheat prices would be a serious blow to
 farmers, and would do nothing to stem
 the increase In retail bread prices. The
 principal factors in the bread price rise
 are not wheat prices, but the rapidly In-
 creasing processing, marketing, and dis-
 tribution costs which are being pushed up
 by the administration's own inflationary
 fiscal policies, plus the cost of the wheat
 certificate program.
 All of these inflated costs of produc-
 tion and processing must be paid for by
 the consumer under, present programs
 and policies. The American consumer is
 also required, in effect, to. subsidize our
 wheat exports to foreign countries.
 Wheat acreage for next year has been
 Increased almost one-third more than
 this year without any change in the
 Government's price mechanism.  The
 Department of Agriculture has quietly
 announced that farmers in the wheat
 program will receive certificates on little
 more than a third of their production
 next year, compared to 45 percent of
 this year's crop. This means that if In-
 creased production causes market prices
 to fall next year, wheat producers will
 receive a lower blend price per bushel
 than they could have under similar cir-
 cumstances this year.
 U.S. farmers are not contributing to
 inflation, but are its principal victims.
 Total farm production expenses are 5-
 percent higher this year than last, and in
 the past 6 years have increased 20.5 per-
 cent.  Yet, while inflation is constantly
 driving up their costs, farmers still have
 no assurance that they will receive fair
 or adequate prices for their production.
 Instead, they are faced with Government
 actions which would have the effect of
 seriously deflating their income.
 I do not see how the administration
 can take this big a gamble with our food
 supply.  We need Increased production,
 but farmers are going to think twice
 about planting more wheat if they see
 a chance that their prices might take a
 nosedive next year-they do not want
 be left holding the bag, as they have
 often in the past.
 (Mr. MINHALL (at the request of
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. MINSHALL.  Mr. Speaker, syndi-
 cated columnist Eliot Janeway, whose
 outstanding articles are carried on the
 financial page of the Cleveland Press, has
 an excellent commentary on the eco-
 nomic consequences of Vietnam.
 I recommend it to the attention of my
 colleagues:
 VIETNAM WAR FINANCING: No WAY To RUN A
 WAR
 (By Eliot Janeway)
 NEw Yogx.-Last time there was a war,
 people scrambled to load up on sugar and
 shoes and tires.  They cleaned out the car
 dealers' lots.  They made sure their homes
 were In good repair-especially their deep
 freezes.  Draft calls and tax talk started a
 flight from money into items expected to be
 on the shoppers' list of shortages.
 Franklin D. Roosevelt codified our way of
 thinking about the economic consequences of
 war in his momentous proclamation, at the
 time  we  accelerated  our preparations for
 World War II, that "the silly-fool dollar sign
 is out for the duration."
 F.D.R.'s  simple  rule  of  thumb  saw  us
 through the Korean war as well.    It made
 sense about how the dollar ceased to be al-
 mighty when it gave way to the wartime ra-
 tion ticket.  The moment it did, dollars be-
 came cheap.
 The normal peacetime premium which
 money commands was switched to the ra-
 tion ticket needed to use it.
 But our new war in Vietnam is working
 out differently from any emergency test of
 strength we've experienced or anticipated as
 a major power-and not just because of the
 way we're fighting it. The way we're financ-
 ing it is different, too.
 Dollars, instead of being down-graded for
 the duration, are commanding an all-time
 premium; the more the war is escalated, the
 higher the premium.  Whoever has them or
 is able to raise them-at any cost-can call
 the tune in the marketplace.
 This time around, no one's worried about
 not being able to buy a .car.  Even the price
 of copper, the war material par excellence,
 which as always soared on war news, has been
 coming, down while the cost of money has
 continued upward; this is a double switch
 in war-time market perfromance.
 Lyndon Johnson's present approach to war
 financing has been to borrow. Each time in-
 terest rates rise previous borrowings at lower
 rates look better.
 Certainly, anyone who had borrowed to the
 hilt at any time since the escalation in -
 Vietnam triggered the inflation In money
 would be way ahead of the game today.
 In fact, the Washington authorities have
 been advertising the scaracity value of cash
 and inviting everyone-bankers as well as
 their customers-to hoard It.
 The runaway in rates suggests a disturbing
 parallel  with the  break  in stock market
 prices: While both changes have hurt, neither
 has provided a corrective or, therefore, run
 its course.
 The worst is yet to come for borrowers;
 and, because money conditions determine
 stock market conditions, for investors too.
 Early in August, Cong. JIM WRIGHT of Fort
 Worth, a prominent supporter of the liberal-
 ism LBJ espoused before he turned himself
 into the father figure of war finance, took
 the House floor to complain that "since just
 last December, interest rates are up 371/2 %
 . .  , more  than 10 times the increase in
 general wages and prices which the Presi-
 dent has certified as conductive to sound
 economic health."
 Labor and producers won't and, moreover,
 can't hold still for 3.2% or (as the air line
 mechanist snafu shows) even 7.5% Increases
 in the face of a money squeeze of the crisis
 20077
 proportions protested by Cong. WRIGHT.
 Money users are stymied, too.  New York
 state, for example, has an anti-usury law
 aimed to protect individuals against interest
 rates above 6%.
 But the banks, understandably, are calling
 in 6%  money lent to individuals in order
 to relend it to corporations at 8%.  Lt's a
 helluva way to run a wax.
 ANDREW EDMISTON, FORMER WEST
 VIRGINIA CONGRESSMAN, PASSES
 (Mr. MOORE (at the request of Mr.
 CLARENCE J. BROWN, JR.)  was  granted
 permission to extend his remarks at
 this point in the RECORD and to include
 extraneous matter.)
 Mr. MOORE.  Mr. Speaker, it is with
 a great deal of sadness that I announce
 to the House of Representatives the
 death of one of its former distinguished
 Members, Andrew Edmiston, of Weston,
 W. Va.
 Mr. Edmiston represented the Third
 Congressional District of West Virginia
 with distinction for five terms from ;1933
 to 1943. In 1962, by reason of congres-
 sional redistricting in West Virginia, Mr.
 Edmiston became my constituent and
 steadfast friend.
 At the time of his death, Andy Edmis-
 ton, as he was affectionately known, was
 73 years old.  During his lifetime, Mr.
 Edmiston compiled a distinguished rec-
 ord in military combat and the political
 arena. He was also noted as a journal-
 ist, farmer, and manufacturer.
 During the First World War, he served
 overseas as a second lieutenant with the
 39th Infantry, 4th Division and was
 awarded the Distinguished Service Cross,
 the Purple Heart with oak leaf clusters,
 and the Distinguished Service Medal of
 West Virginia.
 As a journalist, Mr. Edmiston was edi-
 tor of his hometown weekly newspaper,
 the Weston Democrat for 5 years.  He
 engaged in agricultural pursuits for
 several years prior to World War I. Dur-
 ing World War II, he was the State direc-
 tor of war manpower for West Virginia
 from 1943 to 1945 when he retired to
 private business.
 Mr. Edmiston was very active as a
 member of the Democratic Party.  He
 was delegate to the Democratic National
 Convention in 1928 and 1952. He served
 as State Democratic chairman In West
 Virginia for 4 years and was mayor of
 Weston for one term.
 There are, I am sure, a number of my
 colleagues still serving in this body that
 shared the friendship of Andy Edmiston
 and, as I, profited from that association.
 Andy Edmiston was a loyal Democrat;
 however, our friendship aver the years
 melted away any real differences that
 may have existed.  I was more than
 proud to call him my friend.
 Mrs. Moore and I extend to his family
 our deepest sympathy at his passing.

 TOWARD A MODERN U.S. TEXTILE IMPORT POLICY:
 TH$  LONG-TERM  ARRANGEMENT  REGARDING
 TRADE IN COTTON TEXTILES AND U.S. FOREIGN
 TRADE POLICY
 .'Mr. CURTIS.   Mr. Speaker, on June
 15  four  of  our   colleagues-Messrs.
 LANDRUM, JONAS, DoRN, and DAVis--dis-
 cussed the commentary on U.S. policy re-
 garding International trade in cotton
 textiles in my May 31 report on the sixth
 round of trade negotiations under the
 General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and
 Trade-GATT.  Their criticisms-
 CON-GRESSIONAL RECORD pages 12701 to 12705-
 raised some serious questions about the
 long-term arrangement regarding trade
 In cotton textiles and U.S. policy which
 I will explore here. I am grateful to the
 gentlemen for providing the stimulus and
 the opportunity further to express my
 views.
 The problems of world textile trade are
 Important both for developed and de-
 veloping nations, and they involve fun-
 damental  questions  of  international
 trade policy and theory. But these prob-
 lems also affect the interests of the Amer-
 ican  consumer, worker, and investor.
 The cost to the consumer of some of the
 most basic types of consumer goods-
 shirts, sheets, socks, and dresses-is
 materially affected, and the range of
 choice open to the houswife in purchasing
 for her family is limited. To the worker
 it means employment in an industry
 which appears to have a weak economic
 base, and to the investor it means invest-
 ment in an industry which is to some ex-
 tent artificially prosperous.
 For these reasons I approach this sub-
 ject as a problem of U.S. foreign trade
 policy in the broadest sense, rather than
 as a concern simply of the U.S. textile
 Industries, wool and manmade as well as
 cotton.  The many aspects of the long-
 term, arrangement can be correctly as-
 sessed only In this context.
 Thus my approach will be to discuss:
 First, the history and administration of
 the U.S. cotton textile import program;
 second, important elements of the in-
 ternational impact of U.S. textile policy
 Including effects on developing countries;
 third, whether the industry has a need
 for import protection in the light of its
 present prosperity; and fourth, recom-
 mendations for future policy. I will say
 at the outset that I will be glad to dis-
 cuss this subject further. There are few
 final answers to a problem as complex as
 this. I hope the gentleman will agree to
 the value of exploring in detail many of
 the facets of textile production and trade
 which, though no doubt well known to
 them, may not be to the layman, to whom
 my remarks will, I hope, be informative.
 THE ADVENT OF THE LONG-TERM COTTON
 TEXTILE ARRANGEMENT
 By 1960 the trend that had developed
 In the previous 5 years toward increased
 U.S. imports of cotton textiles had sud-
 denly accelerated.  According to statis-
 tics published In 1965 by the Organiza-
 tion for Economic Cooperation and De-
 velopment-OECD-U.S, imports of cot-
 ton yarns from the rest of the world were
 380,000 metric tons in 1958 and 6,943,000
 metric tons in 1960, compared to exports
 of 7;039,000 metric tons in 1958 and 5,-
 899,000 metric tons in 1960. U.S. imports
 of cotton fabrics from the rest of the
 world in 1958 were 14,179,000 metric tons
 and 51,662,000 metric tons in 1960, while
 U.S. exports of cotton fabrics declined
 from 63,498,000 metric tons in 1958, to
 55 million metric tons in 1950.
 The ratio of imports to domestic con-
 sumption rose from 4 percent in 1959
 to 6 percent In 1960, which, while not
 high for many industries, was considered
 by the textile Industry to be drastic.
 These imports came not only from Japan
 but also from Hong Kong, India, and
 Pakistan, Portugal, and Spain.
 The increase of imports and decline of
 exports revealed by the above statistics
 were major factors leading to the Ken-
 nedy administration's special program
 for the cotton textile industry, some of
 the elements of which were sound meas-
 ures that had broader application to all
 U.S. industry. My colleague the gentle-
 man from Georgia [Mr. LANDRUM7 cited
 some of the elements of what has been
 called the "seven point textile program."
 In their entirety, as formulated by the
 President's Cabinet Textile Committee
 appointed by President Kennedy on
 February 16, 1961, and as announced by
 him on May 2, 1961, the seven points
 were:
 First. A government program for mar-
 ket research and product development;
 Second. Liberalization of the deprecia-
 tion allowance on textile machinery, In
 combination with the 7 percent Invest-
 ment tax credit for new machinery then
 being proposed to Congress;
 Third. Small Business Administration
 loans for the cotton textile industry;
 Fourth. Removal of the "adverse dif-
 ferential" between domestic and foreign
 textile producers' raw cotton costs-
 "two-price cotton";
 Fifth. Adjustment assistance for in-
 dustries "seriously injured or threatened
 with serious injury as a result of in-
 creased imports";
 Sixth. A conference of the principal
 textile exporting and importing countries
 to seek an "international understanding
 which will provide a basis for trade that
 will avoid undue disruption of estab-
 lished industries"; and
 Seventh. "Careful consideration"  to
 any application by the textile Industry
 for action under the escape clause and
 national security provisions of the Trade
 Agreements Extension Act.
 HISTORY OF INDUSTRY CLAIMS FOR PROTECTION
 President Kennedy's seven-point pro-
 gram for textiles had been. preceded by a
 August 29, 1966
 campaign against imports by the textile
 industry, a campaign that gained heat
 in 1960, the year of his election to the
 Presidency. But U.S. industry claims for
 protection cannot be said to have begun
 even in the period 1955-56. Indeed, such
 claims had been made in the 1930's and
 no doubt earlier.
 In 1955 and 1956 trade negotiations
 under the General Agreement on Tariffs
 and Trade were held at Geneva, in which
 many U.S. cotton textile tariffs were cut.
 Under the "peril point" procedure pro-
 vided by section 3 of the Trade Agree-
 ments Act of 1951, as amended, the cot-
 ton textile industry in Tariff Commis-
 sion proceedings had asked that tariffs
 on competing cotton textile imports not
 be cut in GATT trade negotiations in
 those years.
 During 1955 and 1956 Increased im-
 port competition mostly from Japan was
 felt in certain textile lines, such as vel-
 veteen.  The increased imports led in
 part to applications by the cotton tex-
 tile industry for relief under the "escape
 clause," section 7 of the -Trade Agree-
 ments Act of 1951, as amended.
 A brief review of the results of Tariff
 Commission escape clause investigations
 is important.  The results of such in-
 vestigations to determine the validity of
 claims of serious injury from imports is
 an indication whether such claims were
 founded in fact.  It might also show
 whether the escape clause would be ap-
 plied by the Tariff Commission to allow
 relief from certain imports when justi-
 fied by the test of serious injury.
 AUTHORITY FOR ESCAPE-CLAUSE INVESTIGATIONS
 AND  FINDINGS
 The 1951 Trade Agreements Extension
 Act required that an escape clause be
 included in all trade agreements con-
 cluded by the United States, and it es-
 tablished the basic escape clause pro-
 cedure effective until October 11, 1962,
 when repealed by the Trade Expansion
 Act. Section 7 of the 1951 act provided
 that the Tariff Commission, upon the
 request of the President, resolution of
 either House of Congress, resolution of
 either the Senate Finance or House Ways
 and Means Committees, upon its own
 motion, or upon application by an in-
 terested party was promptly to conduct
 an investigation to determine whether
 any product on which a trade agreement
 concession had been granted was, as a
 result of the duty or other customs treat-
 ment reflecting such concession, being
 imported into the United States in such
 Increased quantities, either actual or
 relative, as to cause or threaten serious
 injury to the domestic industry produc-
 ing like or directly competitive products.
 If the Tariff Commission were to find
 the existence or threat of serious injury
 as provided above, it was required to rec-
 ommend to the President the withdrawal
 or modification of the concession, or the
 establishment of an import quota. When
 the Commission judged that there was
 insufficient reason so to recommend, it
 was to report its findings and conclusions,
 Executive Order No. 10401 of October
 14, 1952, established a procedure for re-
 view of and periodic reports on escape
 clause actions taken. Such reviews were

 population and food crisis, prepared by
 the Population Crisis Committee.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 The following quotations clearly indicate
 that most governmental, educational, and
 business leaders are agreed that a world pop-
 ulation and food crisis is imminent:
 "Let us in all our lands-including this
 land-face forthrightly the multiplying prob-
 lerns of our multiplying populations and seek
 the answers to this most profound challenge
 to the future of all the world.
 "Let us act on the fact that less than $5
 invested in population control is worth $100
 invested in economic growth,"-Lyndon B.
 Johnson, June 25, 1965.
 "Along with former President Truman I am
 co-chairman of the Honorary Sponsors Coun-
 cil, Planned Parenthood-World Population.
 I accepted this position in order to demon-
 strate my recognition of the urgency of the
 entire  problem  and  the  alarming  conse-
 quences that are certain to follow Its neglect.
 "I devoutly hope that necessary measures
 will be enacted into law to authorize the Fed-
 eral Government, as well as appropriate pri-
 vate and semi-public organizations, so to co-
 operate among themselves that the necessary
 human  and  material  resources  can  be
 promptly mobilized and employed to cope
 effectively with the great need of slowing
 down and finally stabilizing the growth in
 the world's population."-Dwight D. Eisen-
 hower, June 22, 1965.
 "No, our population cannot be allowed to
 grow at the savage rate of the present, or
 humanity will very soon revert to the darkest
 ages ... but for those of us ... who do not
 want mankind to suffocate in an abyss of its
 own making-least of all our own people here
 in  the  Americas-for  us  the  humane,
 Christian, economic and political solution is
 birth control-and the sooner the better"-
 Dr. Alberto Lleras Camargo, former President
 of  Colombia,  and  Chairman,  First Pan-
 American Assembly on Population, August
 11, 1965.
 `This rapid growth of population creates
 frightening prospects for those looking into
 the future     . all our efforts should be di-
 rected toward the control of this menace.  If
 it is not done, we are asking for total disrup-
 tion and chaos in a few years time."-Ayub
 Khan, President of Pakistan, March 10, 1964.
 "Either we take the fullest measures both
 to raise productivity and to stabilize popu-
 lation growth, or we face disaster of an un-
 precedented magnitude."-Dr. B. R. Sen, Di-
 rector  General,  United Nations Food and
 Agriculture Organization, March 24, 1965.
 "There can be no doubt concerning this
 long-term prognosis:  Either the birth rate
 of the world must come down or the death
 rate must go back up."-Report on "The
 Growth  of  World     Population,"  National
 Academy of Sciences, April, 1963.
 "There may still be a chance to avert a
 Maithusean disaster ... At best, the appar-
 ently unequal race between human procrea-
 tion and food production can be won only
 after an immense and prolonged struggle
 during which man will be ever more pre-
 cariously crowding the margin of safety."-
 Dr. J. George Harrar, President of The Rocke-
 feller Foundation, Spring, 1965.
 "One thing is certain: If steps are not
 taken very soon to check or curtail this
 ominous rate of growth-food production,
 however intensified, will be unable to keep
 pace with the fast growth in population in
 many countries where bare subsistence is
 already the best that most can achieve. "--
 John H. Loudon, Chairman, Royal Dutch
 Petroleum Co.,.The Netherlands, September
 13, 1965.
 "Everywhere there Is a growing recognition
 that this is the number one problem of the
 world.  If tackling it is left too late, all our
 political and economic achievements will be
 swept away like sand castles before the ad-
 vancing tide,"-Lord Caradon, July, 1965.
 "It is evident that the rapidly worsening-
 world food situation can be permanently im-
 proved only by two measures-a more rapid
 increase in food production in the develop-
 ing countries and a less rapid increase in
 population."-Nevin S. Scrimshaw, Head, De-
 partment of Nutrition and Food Science,
 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Oc-
 tober 18, 1965.
 "I am convinced the. world Is plunging
 headlong Into a crisis of catastrophic pro-
 portions and that this crisis can not be
 averted unless massive preventive action is
 started at once.  The stark fact is that the
 world's population is exploding so swiftly that
 it is outrunning man's capacity to produce
 enough food."--John J. Haggerty, Director,
 Project Development, AGRI Research, Inc.,
 Washington, D.C., January, 1965.

 "If the developing nations are to escape
 widespread famine, disease, and the prospect
 of wars initiated in a final desperate effort

 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 COMMITTEE MEETINGS DURING
 SENATE SESSION TOMORROW
 On request of Mr. MANSFIELD, and by
 unanimous consent, all committees were
 authorized to meet during the session of
 the Senate tomorrow until 12 o'clock
 no$n.
 SOCIAL PROBLEMS IN SAIGON
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Madam President,
 some time ago in my committee, the ques-
 tion arose with the Secretary of Defense
 concerning social problems in Saigon.
 Inasmuch as the Secretary of Defense,
 I believe, has a wrong impression of con-
 ditions in Saigon, as evidenced by his
 testimony before my committee at that
 time, I ask unanimous consent to have
 printed in the RECORD an article pub-
 lished in the Washington Post today en-
 titled "GI's Babies Worry Vietnamese,"
 written by William Tuohy.
 I think that it will be beneficial if the
 Secretary of Defense recognizes how se-
 rious a problem the presence of so many
 American soldiers in Vietnam is.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 GI's BABIES WORRY VIETNAMESE
 (By William Tuohy)
 SAIGON, August 28.-American authorities
 here  are  Concerned  about  the  increasing
 number of illegitimate children born to U.S.
 servicemen and Vietnamese women.
 The problem is not yet of serious propor-
 tions, because the big buildup of American
 troops began only a year ago.
 But in the view of social welfare specialists
 here, the specter of unwanted half-caste chil-
 dren born out of wedlock could reach worri-
 some proportions in the months and years
 ahead.
 Thus Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge is
 setting up an informal committee to look in-
 to the matter.  Lodge and his wife, who are
 deeply concerned with the disruption to
 Vietnamese society caused by war and the
 input of American troops, are seeking what-
 ever ways may be found to lessen the problem.
 SUBTLY COLOR-CONSCIOUS
 The situation is complicated in Vietnam,
 which is subtly color-conscious, by babies of
 American                                                Negro  fathers  and  Vietnamese
 mothers.
 Welfare specialists say children born of
 American-Vietnamese parents may have se-
 vere difficulties in being assimilated here.
 There are simply no estimates available of
 the number of such children-just as no
 _reliable estimates exist for similar cases in
 Japan or Korea.
 Under years of French rule, thousands of
 Eurasian of "matisse"  (mixture)  children
 were born of French fathers and Vietnamese
 mothers-in and out of wedlock.
 But every child born of a French father
 automatically received French citizenship,
 which carried many benefits and privileges.
 Vietnamese women, therefore, often consid-
 ered themselves fortunate to have such a
 child.
 Children born of American fathers have
 no such privileges, consequently such babies
 are not looked upon as prizes.
 According to specialists,, most illegitimate
 offspring so far have come from Americans
 who have set up housekeeping with Viet-
 namese women.  The servicemen are in a
 position to look after and support the fam-
 ily.
 The problem grows acute when the father
 comes up for rotation home: Most Ameri-
 can servicemen or Government workers are
 in Vietnam for 12 or 18 months.
 "What  happens        when  those  men  go
 home?" asks a young British woman involved
 in child-placing.
 The woman adds:       "What happens when
 these girls begin to lose their looks?  Bar
 girls are early blooming, but they fade and
 wither quickly.  Then the child becomes a
 burden, a millstone who may jeopardize her
 chances of marriage.  That's when the child
 is in danger."
 Beyond  the      matter of  mixed  children,
 there is the broader problem of Vietnamese
 orphans in  general,  some of whom       are
 adopted by Americans.
 Ironically, well-meaning American serv-
 icemen are sometimes responsible for the
 large number of children in orphanages.

 Mr. YARBOROUGH.  Madam Presi-
 dent, there are three changes in the pro-
 gram which I consider of greatest im-
 portance:
 First. The removal of the "surplus
 concept."
 Second. The., emphasis on "self-help"
 by recipient countries.
 Third. The authorization for funds to
 be used for family planning programs,
 The family planning amendments of
 the bill are substantially those which I
 had  the  honor  of  introducing    on
 February 25, with the cosponsorship of
 the distinguished Senator from Alaska
 [Mr.   GRUENINGI,   the  distinguished
 Senator from Montana [Mr. METCALF],
 and the distinguished Senator from
 Maryland   [Mr.     TYDINGS].  Senator
 TYn1NOS also sponsored a related amend-
 ment of his own.                        These amendments
 are similar to those in the House bill,
 which were adopted under the great
 leadership of Representative PAUL TODD,
 JR., of Michigan.  I wish to commend
 the chairman [Mr. ELLENDER]            and the
 members of the Committee on Agricul-
 ture and Forestry for their wisdom in
 adopting these amendments.
 The family planning amendments are
 found in three parts of the bill.  Section
 10'3(a) reads:
 In exercising the authorities    conferred
 upon him by this title, the President shall
 take   into   account   efforts   of friendly
 countries  to  help  themselves  toward  a
 greater degree of self-reliance, Including ef-
 forts to meet their problems of food produc-
 tion and population growth.
 Section 104 reads as follows:
 SEC. 104. Notwithstanding any other pro-
 vision of law the President may use or enter
 Into agreements with foreign countries or
 international organizations to use the for-
 eign currencies, including principal and In-
 terest from loan repayments, which accrue
 in connection with sales for foreign cur-
 rencies under this title for one or more of
 the following purposes:
 (b) (8) . , to support, on request, pro-
 grams of medical and scientific research, cul-
 tural and educational development, family
 planning, health, nutrition, and sanitation;
 (h) For financing, at the request'of such
 country,  programs  emphasizing  maternal
 welfare,  child  health  and  nutrition, and
 actiyities, where participation is voluntary,
 related to the problems of population growth,
 under procedures established by the Presi-
 dent through any agency of the United
 States, or through any local agency which
 he determines is qualified to administer such
 activities.
 These family planning provisions are
 needed because the world faces severe
 food shortages in the decade ahead un-
 less we are willing to take steps to meet
 the coming challenge.
 The problem exists primarily in the
 underdeveloped areas of the world where
 populations are growing much more
 rapidly than the supply of food can be
 expanded.
 Historically, traditional societies ex-
 panded food productions along with pop-
 ulation by expanding the acreage under
 cultivation.  Today,  however,  many
 densely populated underdeveloped coun-
 tries have little new land that can be
 brought  under   cultivation. Studies
 show that increased production in the
 future must increasingly be from higher
 yields per acre.  This method of increas-
 ing food production is vastly more dif-
 ficult than the traditional method.                                                             It
 requires a reasonably high level of liter-
 acy, capital, a "market oriented" econ-
 omy, and support from the rest of the
 economy in the form of fertilizers, in-
 secticides and other products.                                                                   These
 are precisely the things that are lacking
 in the underdeveloped regions of the
 world.
 The food-for-peace bill will enable us
 to assist underdeveloped land in devel-
 aping some of these "preconditions for a
 yield per acre takeoff."
 However, let us consider what 'would
 happen if we were successful beyond our
 wildest dreams, if we could raise yields
 in the underdeveloped lands at the same
 rate at which they are increasing in the
 developed  areas.   The French  have
 raised wheat yields 2.3 percent per year.
 This is one of the most successful per-
 formances in Europe, and when com-
 pared with the French population in-
 crease of i percent per year, has meant
 real progress in France. But the French
 performance would not have been ade-
 quate had it been confronted with pop-
 ulation growth, rates as high as those
 which prevail in many underdeveloped
 countries.
 Or take the United States as an ex-
 ample. - We have raised wheat yields
 2.7 percent from 1935-39 to 1960-62.
 When combined with our 1.7 percent
 rate of population growth this gives us
 a net gain in output per capita of 1 per-
 cent.  If this rate of wheat yield increase
 had been achieved in Brazil, with a Pop-
 ulation increase of 3.1 percent per year,
 however, output per capita would have
 declined.
 Let me now quote from page 20 of
 World Population and Food Supplies,
 1980, published by the American Society
 of Agronomy. This gives an even more
 revealing picture of what would happen
 should we bring the rate of growth of
 production in underdeveloped lands up
 to that in developed areas:
 Consider these facts. The agricultural land
 resources of the two economic regions (de-
 veloped, and underdeveloped) are approxi-
 mately the same.  The 1960 population of
 the developed world was less than 0.9 billion,
 that of the less-developed world was more
 than 2 billion.  The projected increase be-
 tween 1960 and 2000 for-the developed world,
 according to the United Nations medium
 level projections, Is 0.4 billion and that for
 the less-developed world is nearly 3 billion.
 Now  let  us     interchange  the  projected
 growth In population of the two regions.
 The developed world would then absorb the
 3 billion and the less-developed world, the
 0.4 billion. The United States, with about
 one-fourth of the agricultural land resources
 of the developed world, could expect to ac-
 commodate one-fourth of the 3 billion total
 (750 million).  This amounts to an addition
 of about 190 million per decade-roughly
 the equivalent of our current population
 every 10 years.
 This statement alone illustrates that
 the United States with all its riches
 could not stand the rate of population
 growth now taking place in the under-
 developed world.  Thus we cannot es-
 cape the fact that even if we bring the
 growth of food production in these un-
 derdeveloped areas up to what it is in
 the developed half of the world, we will
 still be fighting a losing battle in the
 war against poverty and famine--losing,
 that is, unless we do something about the
 other half of the equation-population
 growth.
 President  Johnson  recognized  this
 problem when he said in his message to
 Congress:
 A balance between agricultural productiv-
 ity and population is necessary to prevent
 the  shadow  of hunger from becoming a
 nightmare of famine.
 With this bill we shall be investing
 substantial amounts in economic d'e-
 velopment.                                                                                                             In his  20th anniversary
 message to the United Nations President
 Johnson stated:
 Let us act on the fact that less than five
 dollars invested  in  population  control  is
 worth a hundred dollars Invested in eco-
 nomic growth.
 When experts tell us how difficult, in-
 deed almost impossible, it will be to bring
 increases in food production to under-
 developed areas up to the level of. in-
 creases in population, it makes no sense
 to spend millions of dollars to feed all
 these additional hungry mouths unless
 we also render assistance to allow in-
 dividuals, if they choose to do so, to
 exert some measure of rational choice
 over just how many additional hungry
 mouths we shall have to feed every year.
 We must look to the causes of our prob-
 lems; if we treat only the effects we shall
 never win our battle.
 I-believe that these three amendments
 will be helpful in bringing into the pic-
 ture the other side of the dual-natured
 enemy we are fighting.  We must attack
 both the cause-population increasing
 faster than food supplies-and the ef-
 fect-insufficient food to feed the popu-
 lation.  What is here suggested is a
 limited step, a prudent step. Let us make
 this beginning.
 Madam President, I ask unanimous
 consent that there be printed at this

 employment seems to be the real "first."
 Here would seem to be a great Republican
 opportunity.
 Negroes and business
 The Negro can, of course, be trained for
 the skills needed in industrial plants.  The
 one vocational area where he is least ob-
 servable, however, is that loosely defined as
 the small business-commercial area, the tra-
 ditional  training  ground-in  addition                        to
 farming-for  poor,  immigrant     minorities
 working their way up to the great middle
 class.
 Republicans could sponsor a wide variety
 of training programs, even financial assist-
 ance programs, to enable the nonwhite to
 learn business and commercial operations,
 to become managers or owners of the many,
 many service-type establishments needed in
 urban areas.
 If the Republican Party has a certain af-
 finity toward "business," it should use its
 connections to attract the ambitious, tal-
 ented young Negro toward business and com-
 mercial careers, with the goal of ownership
 or management of an enterprise.
 It is an appeal that is less blatantly politi-
 cal and less paternalistic than that used by
 Democrat city bosses, and yet it could be
 the constructive and effective means to trans-
 form the outlook-and dissolve the bloc-
 voting pattern-of the nonwhite.
 Negroes and unions
 One of the problem areas for Negroes is
 the  segregated  membership  policies  of
 unions,  particularly  the  craft      and  trade
 unions.  Recently, NAACP executive director
 Roy Wilkins pointed to the anomoly of sup-
 port for civil rig]ats legislation by the leaders.
 of organized labor, but a refusal to carry out
 such  policies  by  many union         locals-the
 level at which it really mattered in terms
 of apprenticeship training and actual jobs.
 Mr Wilkins pointed out that some unions
 were even urging the Importation of skilled
 Europeans rather than supporting training
 programs  at home  for  unskilled workers,
 which category would Include many Negroes.
 Nevertheless, there are more Negroes in`
 unions today.  There is more opportunity
 for Negroes in union leadership posts.  With
 the much more rapid turnover of rank-and-
 file union membership, the  old chain of
 command can be disrupted.  If he remains in
 his union and gains sufficient seniority the
 bright, ambitious Negro can find more room
 at the top.
 Young Negro men, particularly, can and
 must receive readily identifiable Republican
 encouragement..  For Negro teenagers had
 a late-1965 unemployment rate  that  was
 three times its 1953 lever.
 .And all Negroes, in late 1965, had an un-
 employment rate almost double their 1953
 rate,, despite low overall unemployment and
 a booming, wartime economy for the Nation
 as a whole.
 The argument that the Negro can't be won
 by the Republican Party, according to Sen-
 ator JACOB JAVITS, turns in some degree on
 the nature of the 1960 campaign.  John F.
 Kennedy, in his race for the presidency, made
 a strong effort to capture the votes of
 Negroes and, in the end, won 68 percent of
 their votes, although Richard Nixon, as Vice
 President, had an enviable civil rights record.
 not overlook the fact that in political terms
 there is more involved in the civil rights fight
 than the votes of Negroes alone:
 "In my 1962 campaign, for example, a poll
 was taken in a district, which I carried handi-
 ly and which was white, Anglo-Saxon, Prot-
 estant, with a reputation for being hostile
 to  civil  rights  activism  and  to  minority
 groups in general.  It was found that among
 the various reasons given as to why voters
 backed me my strong stand on civil rights
 ranked first.  The pollsters, surprised at such
 findings, went back for another sampling-
 and the results were the same.
 "This experience strengthened my convic-
 tion that the struggle for civil rights touches
 deeply the conscience of all Americans, for
 they know in their hearts that what hurts
 any minority hurts every minority."
 Senator LEVERETT SALTONSTALL understood
 this when he fought for the rights of Negro
 troops in America's Armed Forces.
 Senator JOHN SIIERMAN COOPER understood
 this when he fought for a better education
 for Negro children.
 And Senator EVERETT MCKINLEY DIRKSEN,
 in effect, wrote the book.
 With the simple facts of population growth
 and migration bringing control of 8 out of
 America's 10 biggest cities within the po-
 tential control of Negroes in the next gen-
 eration,  Republicans-particularly  on  the
 national level=face an opportunity equal to
 that of the Democrats in. the 1930's.
 Edward W. Brooke, a Republican, a prac-
 tical politician, and a Negro, says:
 "In competitive America, skills, training,
 ambition, knowledge and acquaintances are
 what count-these are the products of in-
 vestment and development over many gen-
 erations.  There is, I think, no other mean-
 ingful way to examine the 'Negro' problem."
 And it is here, says Brooke-G.O.P. candi-
 date for the Senate from Massachusetts-
 that the Negro's needs are greatest.  The abil-
 ity to compete-man to man, skill to skill,
 degree for degree-will not be bestowed upon
 Negroes magically, says Brooke.
 Mere passage Of time, he says, will solve
 nothing for the gap is widening. As previ-
 ously stated, unemployment among Negro
 teenagers today is 3 times what it was in
 1953.
 Concludes Brooke:
 "The solution will not be easy. It will re-
 quire much more than passing and enforc-
 ing laws dealing with the surface aspects of
 equality  of  opportunity.   It  will  require
 working with the human stuff which is the
 real measurement of equality.  And the task,
 however massive, must be faced.  Racial in-
 equality permeates every aspect of our na-
 tional life; no domestic or foreign issue is
 more important."
 Concludes  Michigan's  Governor  George
 Romney, "The Republican Party has the op-
 portunity to play the crucial role in rebuild-
 ing faith in the authentic American Revolu-
 tion. . . . (It)  must work without respite,
 (and) dedicate itself with unalloyed devotion
 to the task of securing equal rights for all
 Americans."
 EPrLOG
 These past 60 years have brought us from
 Kitty Hawk to Venus.
 The future is not just a fresh page on the
 calendar, but a time when things are basic-
 ally different and it is arriving at a voracious
 speed whether we like it or not, whether we
 are ready for it or not.
 What will it be like?  Take the wildest

 ETNAM IS A GLOBAL QUESTION
 Mr. KUCHEL.  Mr. President, earlier
 this month, I addressed the Senate to
 state my strong conviction that America
 must not leave the world in doubt about
 its resolution to see through the grim
 conflict in Vietnam. I said:
 This war has, become far too deadly, to
 tolerate further shadow shows.  The oriental
 aggressors should look behind the screen to
 see that the tiger is real.
 It  is  highly  important  that  America's
 voice come through, loud and clear and offi-
 cially.                                                                                                                                     There is no second American voice.
 However hard some may try to mount one, it
 is a false voice.
 The August 20 edition of the London
 Economist in its lead article entitled
 "This is the Third World War," taking
 note of the recent emergence of Marshal
 Lin Piao as the apparent sunccessor to
 Mao Tse Tung, has provided a further
 exposition of this point in light of later
 exents.  I quote the following excerpts:
 And Mao has picked out Lin Piao as his
 chief assistant.  The meaning is clear.  Mao
 Tse-tung, now almost mystical in his cer-
 tainty, is not backing down one inch from
 his hopes of ideological expansion.
 This is the most important fact about Asia
 today.  It is the background against which
 the debate on American policy in the Far
 East    has  to  be .measured.   Whether  the
 United States has a job to do in Asia is not,
 at bottom, something to be decided in Wash-
 ington.  It has already been decided in Pe-
 king.                                                                                                                                     The Americans were a Pacific power
 long    before   they   became   an  Atlantic
 power * * *.
 The Russians took a long step in the right
 direction at Tashkent this year, when they
 declared their interest in the stability of the
 Indian subcontinent; but they have still not
 been able to bring themselves to say out loud
 that China's idea of universal revolution is
 a hell of a way to run the world.  They
 probably will in the end.  But meantime the
 Americans, and the Americans alone, are in
 a position to do something about the prob-
 lem man of the 1960s: Mao the evangelist,
 with his hot gospel of guerrilla liberation
 tucked under his arm * * *.
 The argument is about how much strength
 will be needed, and where it can best be
 applied * * *.
 Until and unless there is solid evidence
 that China does not intend to do what Lin
 Piao says it wants to do, Or cannot do it, the
 only safe assumption for the Americans or
 anybody else to make is that the Chinese
 mean every word they say.  That is where
 any sober Asia policy starts from * * *.
 Marshal Lin Piao saw the connection all
 right for China's purposes [between Vietnam
 and other guerrilla wars] in the article on
 people's war that the Peking central com-
 mittee has just commended: "The people in
 other parts of the world will see * * * that
 what the Vietnamese people can do, they can
 do too."
 China has nominated Vietnam as a test-
 case for what it claims to be a new kind of.
 war.  It is a land war, fought by relatively
 small formations of very brave men who are
 prepared to persist for years with the tactics
 of ambush and terrorism until the other
 side's nerve cracks.  Those who believe that

 iowneror driver a voter, and all downright
 oiisgusted at one time or other by traffic con-
 ditions-then to these, voters, to these tax-
 payers, to these drivers-traffic congestion is
 a reality; it is not a myth; it is totally un-
 acceptable.
 And in the meantime: Detroit is turning
 out automobiles at a rate 11/2 times our hu-
 man birth rate.
 That this already has affected the New
 Electorate  is  demonstrable.  In  city  after
 city the 20-minute drive to work of 1955 has
 become a grim 45-minute competitive grind.
 During rush hours, north-south traffic in
 New York today moves at an average speed
 of 11 miles per hour; east-west traffic at 8
 miles per hour.  A man's normal walking
 pace is 4 miles per hour.
 In Atlanta, the population Is growing at a
 rate of 40 percent, automobiles by 75 percent.
 In Philadelphia, by 1975, there will be 18
 percent more people driving 47 percent more
 cars to make 54 percent more trips.  Nearly
 all will be voters and they well might take
 their transportation problems to the voting
 booth.
 An angry snarl, a clenched fist banged
 on the steering wheel, seem to plead for
 someone   to   do   something.  Who?  The
 Democrats?  On the Federal level?  Or, per-
 haps an effort similar to Republican George
 Christopher, who as Mayor of San Fran-
 cisco successfully welded local, county, State,
 and private resources into a topflight mass
 transportation, system?  (San Francisco is
 building the  Nation's first  all new rapid
 transit system since 1907.  Preliminary work
 started 14 years ago.    When completed in
 1971, computer-operated electrical trains will
 be shuttling passengers at speeds up to 80
 miles an hour over 75. miles of surface, ele-
 vated, and subway track in the City of San
 Francisco and suburban counties.
 Mass transit versus the auto
 Yet systems of mass transportation must
 be competitive with the private automobile
 in terms of comfort, speed, cost, and con-
 venience.                               If not, they are a waste of money,
 --time, and very valuable land.  If transit isn't
 competitive, no one will use it.
 As we have seen, more than 7 out of 10
 Americans live in metropolitan areas in and
 around central cities and this concentra-
 tion is increasing.  Over 70 percent of an
 electorate experiencing a growing difficulty
 in transporting itself represents a segment
 of American voters too large to ignore.
 Yet with few exceptions the Democrat
 Party has been successful in assuming unto
 Itself the role of "caring" for the commuter,
 of wishing to "help" the working man and
 woman (one-third of all married women in
 the U.S. have jobs and are working today)
 in their daily struggle to escape traffic con-
 gestion and skyrocketing accident rates.
 Death on the highway
 Nor is carnage on America's highways to
 be ignored by either political party.  This
 year about 50,000 Americans will die-men,
 women, and children-in automobile acci-
 dents on America's highways.  Last year the
 rate of this slaughter was just below 50,000.
 The year before it wasin the high 40,000's.
 The most conservative estimates by reason-
 able men place traffic deaths at slightly below
 55,000 per year in the next 3 years and

 In the last 7 years, we've lost more lives
 in highway deaths than we lost in all of
 World War II.
 It is neither dramatic, nor idealistic, nor
 wishful to inquire of any government, on
 whatever level, precisely how long this rate
 of slaughter will be continued.
 Better law enforcement
 Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White
 laid out a program last year to upgrade traffic
 courts across the country.  It included:
 1. Elbninating the "fix."
 2. Running traffic courts for  he purpose
 of  influencing behavior rather  than, for
 revenue.
 3. Ensuring that serious violators "must
 face the judge."
 4. Seeing to it that "the 'accumulated ex-
 perience of the better traffic courts" is made
 available to all.
 Justice White said there are 30 million
 violators a year and the "mushrooming case-
 load has overwhelmed every city and State."
 "Traffic courts," he said, "should be brought
 into the regular court system, subjected to
 judicial and administrative control and made
 courts of record with responsibilities equal
 to the task before them."
 The justice called for "full-time judges of.
 adequate ability with proper insulation from
 political control."  He said the tools to do
 the job-such as a model traffic law-are
 available.
 "Legislatures, as well as the people, must
 be moved, and the courts and judges, al-
 though they must do their share, cannot
 carry the burden themselves," White said.
 But since we are talking about voters, par-
 ticularly                                                                                      young  ones,  the  preference  in
 America has been, and still is, for automo-
 biles..  In spite of traffic snarls and slow-
 downs in automobile transportation, patron-
 age of mass transit continues to decline in
 America.  In 1965, according to the American
 Transit  Association,  it  declined  again  by
 0.82 percent.  The automobile continues to
 be private, convenient, flexible, and it takes
 people   where they    want  to  go.     Young
 voters-32 million between 21 and 35.-prefer
 them to busses.
 This is not to say that automobiles can-
 problems can help to provide the impetus
 to economic growth in the 60's, as did the
 automobile in the early decades of the cen=tury,"
 Top priorities:
 1. Rescue  of  mass  transportation-"our
 most urgent metropolitan problem."
 2. Railroad consolidation, with uneconom-
 ic schedules lopped off.
 3. Removal of aviation bottlenecks, such
 as transportation to and from airports.
 4. Tax reforms, to encourage risk-taking.
 That volumes of traffic will double within
 the next 25 to 35 years is known.  Which
 political party will be lodged firmly in the
 minds of the electorate for: (a) reducing this
 awful death rate; (b) making the going and
 coming from work more palatable; (c) doing
 it without grossly violating the taxpayer's
 purse; and (d) doing it quickly is a question
 which can  be answered only by political
 leadership aware of a trend and seeking a
 pattern of action.
 PART  IX:  NEGROES-NO  LONGER A POWERLESS
 MINORITY
 "If nonwhites continue to hold the same
 proportion of jobs In each occupation as in
 1964, the nonwhite unemployment rate in
 1975 will be more than 5 times that for the
 labor force as a whole .                               .
 "If trends in upgrading the jobs of non-
 whites continue at the same rate as in re-
 cent years, the nonwhite unemployment rate
 in 1975 would still be about 21/2  times that
 for the labor force as a whole."--Report to

 Mr. Lippmann, for his part, has walked
 into a couple of traps.  He tried to argue on
 July 26th that there is no connection between
 the guerrilla war in Vietnam  ("one small
 corner of the world")    and other possible
 guerrilla wars that might follow it elsewhere.
 But Marshal Lin Piao saw the connection all
 right for China's purposes in the article on
 "people's war" that the Peking central com-
 mittee has just commended:
 "The people in other parts of the world
 will see     . that what the Vietnamese peo-
 ple can do, they can do too,"
 That was one trap, and Mr. Lippmann
 dropped into it.  The other is bigger and.
 deeper, and goes right down to the funda-
 mental question about the whole war: how
 can you defend the non-communist parts of
 Asia unless you are ready to fight a war in
 Asia?  Mr. Lippmann says, quite rightly, that

 wars in Asia like the plague.  So he argues
 that the Americans should discharge their
 responsibility to the Asians by means of sea
 and air power alone-which means, in effect,
 by air power deployed from aircraft carriers
 and from islands off the Asian mainland.
 But Mr. Lippmann himself has scathingly
 pointed out how limited the uses of air
 power have been in Vietnam.  If air power
 has not yet succeeded in tipping the scales
 In a war to which the Americans have com-
 mitted 300,000 troops, how on earth can it
 protect non-communist Asia all by itself?
 The blunt truth is that this is now an
 academic argument.  China has nominated
 Vietnam as a test-case for what it claims
 to be a new kind of war.  It is a land war,
 fought by relatively small formations of very
 brave men who are prepared to persist for
 years with the tactics of ambush and terror-
 ism  until  the  other                        side's  nerve  cracks.
 Those who believe that this technique of
 "people's war" should be opposed, because
 its aim is to set up an unacceptable form of
 society, have little choice but to fight it on
 its own terms: that is, by a land war.  Ity is
 not the "right war in the right place." De-
 fensive wars seldom are,  It is not the sort
 of war that the Americans will be able to
 bring themselves to fight time and time again
 in other parts of the world.  But if it comes
 out right in Vietnam, it will with luck not
 have to be fought all over again elsewhere.
 If the dissident minority in South Vietnam
 falls to take power by force of arms, dissident
 minorities in other places will think twice
 ? before they believe Lin Plan's tip that they
 are on to a winner.
 But if the technique of "people's war"
 does succeed in Vietnam, the past week's
 events in Peking will take on a new light.
 Those who do not like the war in Vietnam,
 but equally do not want to see Mao Tse-
 tung's  beliefs  sweeping  across  Asia  in  a
 wave of guerrilla wars, have a duty to ask
 themselves where else they think the wave
 can be stopped.  Thailand?  But the non-
 " communist Thals are not going to call for
 help from a defeated American army, and
 in any case it is logistically much harder to
 get help into Thailand than Into Vietnam.
 Burma?  Not on the cards.   India, then?
 country if the guerrillas once get to work
 in West Bengal or Kerala or wherever.
 The fighting in Vietnam, it is said, could
 grow into the third world war.  In a sense,
 it already is the third world war.  It is not
 by the Americans' choice that this has be-
 come a testing-ground for the theories of
 Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao.      It need not
 have been.  If there were any reasonable
 grounds for thinking that a communist vic-
 tory in Vietnam would not be followed by
 communist bids for power In the rest of
 Asia-starting  in  Thailand,    and  moving
 from there towards India-it would not be
 necessary to make a stand in Vietnam.    It
 would not be necessary if Lin Piao had not
 written what he has written, and had not
 now been given Mao's accolade for writing
 it.  It would not be necessary if Russia were
 able to assert its authority over the com-
 munists of south-east Asia and guarantee
 that a stable truce line, like the line between
 the two parts of Germany, could be drawn
 along the Mekong between a communist In-
 dochina  and  a  non-communist                                                                                    Thailand.
 If either of those things applied,  a deal
 could be done in Vietnam tomorrow.  The
 only losers would be those South Vietnamese,
 Buddhists and Catholics alike, who keep on
 telling anyone who will listen that they do
 not want to be ruled by communists.  It
 would by a cynical deaf;  but it could be
 struck.
 The deal the Americans cannot reasonably
 be asked to strike is one that threatens to
 sell the pass to the whole of southern Asia.
 This  is  Mr.  Johnson's  enormous problem
 It is also the problem of those who criticise
 his decision to take America into the war.
 Those of them-an increasing number-who
 agree that America has a responsibility to-
 wards the non-communists nations of Asia
 cannot dodge the question it poses.  How
 else can you suggest holding the line, if not
 by fighting in Vietnam?

 GOOD DEEDS
 Mr. KUCHEL.  Mr. President, as an
 American citizen, I am quite proud and
 very grateful, at the generous, philan-
 thropic exertions of a group of Americans
 calling themselves AHEAD, to serve man-
 kind's needs. AHEAD, which stands for
 American Health Education for African
 Development, is carrying the tradition
 of private philanthropy in aid of the
 health of the people of Africa, a tradition
 which goes back to the time of the fabl d
 Dr. Livingstone and includes the noble
 name of Albert Schweitzer.
 Since its creation in 1963, AHEAD has
 embarked on programs of nursing educa-
 tion, plant research, recruitment of spe-
 cialists and provision of training fellow-
 ships.                                                                             A few days ago, I met with the
 president of the AHEAD Foundation,
 Mrs. Susan Bagley Bloom, to listen to a
 laudable venture it has undertaken. Its
 latest project is the establishment of a
 nursing education center in the western
 African nation of Sierra Leone.  The
 foundation is receiving full cooperation
 from the host government and is receiv-
 ing some support from the U.S. Agency
 for International Development.  On its
 own, AHEAD must provide $400,000 for
 construction of necessary buildings.  I
 offer my sincere hopes that my fellow
 citizens all across this land will. partici-
 pate in this humanitarian undertaking.
 Mr, President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that at the conclusion of my re-
 marks there be included in the RECORD a
 letter to me from Mr. William C. Gibaons,
 Director of Congressional Liaison, AID,
 regarding the activities of AHEAD.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 1.)
 Mr. KUCHEL.  Mr. President, among
 the peoples of Africa the scourge of dis-
 ease is a continuing threat to progress
 and to necessary economic development.
 I commend to the attention of my col-
 leagues the work of the AHEAD Founda-
 tion, and the fine example it has set for
 private American initiative in Africa.

 DEPARTMENT OF STATE, AGENCY

 Washington, D.C., August 24, 1966.
 Hon. THOMAS H. KUCHEL,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.                         -
 DEAR SENATOR KUCHEL:  Because of your
 interest in cases of participation in our pro-
 gram by private institutions, I wanted you
 to know of the help we are receiving from
 the American Health Education for Africa
 Development Foundation (AHEAD) of which
 Mrs. Susan Bagley Bloom is the founder and
 President.
 One of the countries in Africa being as-
 sisted by American public and private agen-
 cies is Sierra Leone.  Since its independence
 in 1961, it has maintained a democratic gov-
 ernment respecting the rule of law, an. inde-
 pendent judiciary, and freedom of speech.
 It has the oldest university in West Africa
 (Fourah Bay College) and Is hospitable to
 private enterprise.
 Yet it needs assistance in its efforts to
 raise the level of well being of the Sierra
 Leone people.  One of the important needs,
 as confirmed by a recent World Health Or-
 ganization  study,  is  a  Nurses  Training
 School.  And in response to a request from
 the Sierra Leone Government, a project has
 been established combining the efforts of a
 private American Foundation (AHEAD), the
 U.S. Agency for International Development,
 and the Sierra Leone Government.
 As its contribution to the Nursing Educa-
 tion project, AHEAD has agreed to provide
 $400,000 for construction of a nurse's dormi-
 tory  and  Classroom  building.   A.I.D.  is
 financing the professional services of four
 American nurses from Freedmen's Hospital,
 Washington,  D.C.  They  are assisting as
 teachers and advisors in the new school.
 The nurses arrived at Freetown early this
 month.  The Sierra Leone government, as its
 part of the project, will construct a nursing
 education center and provide operating ex-
 penses estimated at $56,000 a year.  Although
 the government has a modest budget, it is
 keenly interested in the nursing project and
 is prepared to fulfill its responsibilities in
 making the school a successful undertaking.
 Sincerely yours,
 WILLIAM C. GIBBONS,
 Director, Congressional Liaison.

 finds these convenient eljcuses.  If they did
 not exist, others would be found.
 French opposition to American policy is
 more complex.  Part of it can be traced to
 President Charles de Gaulle's determination
 to set a separate course for France.  Pro-
 Gaullist Frenchmen say the president has
 set a goal of bringing both China and Russia
 into detente with the West.  Viet Nam is a
 "nuisance" war, they say-one that makes
 De Gaulle's task more difficult.
 "And it is a war you cannot win," is a
 statement repeated constantly to Americans
 in Paris.
 But underneath all this French opposition
 is an unspoken worry that America might
 win in Viet Nam.
 "Many Frenchmen don't even realize it,"
 said one American Official, "but they want us
 to lose.  They were driven out of Viet Nam.
 If we stay and win, it will be another blow
 to their pride."
 It might also be a blow to French finances.
 It's no secret in Paris that France would like
 to see a neutral Viet Nam in which France
 could reestablish her economic links of colo-
 nial times.
 The prospect of an American-dominated
 Southeast Asian economy is not a happy one
 in France.
 In Italy the worry about Viet Nam centers
 on domestic politics.
 "There is no question but that the war has
 become a major issue for the Italian Com-
 munist Party," said U.S. Ambassador Frede-
 rick Reinhardt.   "They've seized on it as
 'proof' that we are aggressive."
 The Communist Party in Italy, which con-
 trols more than 30 per cent of the vote, is
 the best organized political unit in the coun-
 try-some say it's the only real political orga-
 nization.
 Faced with this bloc and with the pros-
 pect that rival Socialist groups may merge,
 the pro-U.S. Christian Democrats have fallen
 almost silent on Viet Nam.  The best the
 Rome government can muster is a statement
 that it "understands" the U.S. position.
 In neutral Switzerland, prominent editors
 and businessmen express deep misgivings
 about the American policy and an alarming
 lack of appreciation for its basic direction.
 Rene Payo, aging editor of the respected
 Journal de Geneve, tries to draw a parallel
 between Viet Nam and Algeria.
 "You are defending colonialism," he said.
 "You have your feet stuck in mud."
 Asked if Switzerland had any answer to
 the war that would prevent the Communist
 takeover of South Viet Nam, Payo only
 shrugs.
 Conversations with a broad range of Eu-
 ropean editors demonstrated that the Unit-
 ed States has not mustered an effective prop-
 aganda campaign to explain  in detail its
 position,   The  fact  that  U.S.  columnists
 highly critical of the war get wide circula-
 tion in Europe adds to the confusion.
 Editors are much better acquainted with
 the statements   Of  FULBRIGHT,  Sen.   WAYNE
 MORSE, Sen. MIKE MANSFIELD, and Sen. ROB-
 ERT KENNEDY than with the statements of
 President Johnson, Secretary of State Dean
 Rusk, Sen. EVERETT DIRKSEN or Sen. RICH-
 ARD  RUSSELL.
 So are their readers.
 One American' ambassador cited these fac-
 tors in Europe's attitude:
 1. A general belief that the Russian threat
 has receded and a fear that Viet Nam might
 revive it.
 2. A selfish concern that U.S. attention and
 wealth might be diverted to Asia instead of
 Europe.
 9. An attitude of isolation and remote-
 ness from the war.
 "I've heard more than one official dismiss
 Viet Nam as a war, 7,000 miles away that
 was of little direct importance to Europe,"
 said the ambassador.
 The phrase recalled British Prime Minis-
 ter  Neville  Chamberlain's  reference  to
 Czechoslovakia as "a little country 700 miles
 away" when he returned from the infamous
 Munich conference of 1938.
 The way the world has shrunk in the last
 30 years, Viet Nam could be just as vital
 to Europe tomorrow as Czechoslovakia proved
 to be in 1939.  But countries enjoying rec-
 ord prosperity which have finally begun to
 forget World War II don't like to think about
 it.
 They would much prefer  to  "let Uncle
 Sam do it."
 The Center for Urban Education in the
 Heart of Manhattan
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. THEODORE R. KUPFERMAN
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 29, 1966
 Mr. KUPFERMAN.  Mr. Speaker, in
 the heart of my district, at 33 West 42d
 Street, New York City, is located the
 Center for Urban Education  which,
 among other things, publishes the Urban
 Review.
 The Center for Urban Education is
 an  independent  nonprofit corporation
 formed in 1965 under an absolute charter
 from the New York State Board of Re-
 gents. The fundamental objective of the
 center is to contribute strategic knowl-
 edge and resources to the strengthening,
 improvement, and reconstruction of edu-
 cational services of all kinds at all levels
 within urban society.
 The Center for Urban Education was
 born of an innovation in Federal, State,
 and local planning in cooperation with
 the university community.  This year,
 for the first time, U.S. Office of Educa-
 tion funding was authorized for the es-
 tablishment of multidisciplinary, multi-
 functional organizations in the research
 and  development  tradition.   These
 funds-and funds from five founda-
 tions-have made it possible for the cen-
 ter to bring to bear on the problems and
 possibilities of urban education a wide
 variety of resources and talents. These
 are drawn from eight major universities
 and colleges in the metropolitan area,
 the Board of Education of New York City,
 and the New York State Department of
 Education.
 The member institutions are: Bank
 Street College of Education, Columbia
 University, Fordham University, New
 York Medical College, New York Univer-
 sity, Teachers College of Columbia Uni-
 versity, the City University of New York,
 and Yeshiva University.
 In addition, the center has informal
 ties with several suburban school sys-
 tems, other institutions of higher learn-
 ing, and public and private organiza-
 tions serving the needs of special prob-
 lems in education.  This is not a static
 confederation, for an. underlying prin-
 ciple of the center is that it will always
 welcome affiliation, formal or informal,
 A4567
 with groups or individuals committed to
 the same broad goals of educational.re-
 sponse of a changing urban society. The
 basic purpose of the center is to conduct
 research, development and demonstra-
 tion in the whole range of issues com-
 mon to education in large urban areas,
 and to offer a resource for the imple-
 mentation of new practices.  Currently
 the center is working on problems in
 curriculum innovation, teacher training,
 education of the handicapped, school ad-
 ministration, cognitive development, de
 facto segregation, and vocational educa-
 tion.
 The  Urban  Review  is  published
 monthly by the center's liaison office,
 David Outerbridge, director. Its pur-
 pose is to disseminate information about
 new developments and ideas across the
 whole spectrum of urban education, with
 special emphasis on the activities of the
 center.  All unsigned articles appearing
 in its pages are written by the staff of
 the liaison office.  All signed articles,
 whether written by members of the cen-
 ter staff or by others, reflect the opinions
 of their authors, which are not neces-
 sarily shared by the center or its mem-
 ber institutions.  No individual issue of
 the Urban Review attempts to report the
 entire range of the center's activities.
 Letters, inquiries, and manuscripts are
 welcomed and should be addressed to its
 editor.
 The first issue of the Urban Review, of
 which Nelson Aldrich is editor, appeared
 in May 1966, and monthly since then.
 In the first issue, it was stated:
 The  magazine represents a new  effort
 toward achieving better communication be-
 tween the educational practitioner, policy-
 maker, and scholar.  Quite apart from the
 school systems themselves and the countless
 public and private agencies operationally in-
 volved in the educational process, govern-
 ment, industry and the mass media are today
 also deeply committed to the task of improv-
 ing the quality of instruction at all levels
 and of all kinds.  A necessary concomitant
 of this task is research, but all to often the
 policy-maker and the practitioner are cut off
 from the scholar's findings by the language
 in which he formulates them, and too often,
 also, the scholar is cut off from the others'
 experience by its resistance to formulation.
 The Urban Review intends to promote a
 free and frank dialogue between these di-
 verse groups.  In this it mirrors the organi-
 zation that sponsors it.
 The Urban Review will reflect these and
 other concerns.   "Education," wrote Henry
 Adams, "must fit the complex conditions of
 a new society always accelerating its move-
 ment, and its fitness could be known only
 from success."  Society today, no less than in
 1900, is still complex, still accelerating, and
 an imperative of education is still to keep
 pace, if not to lead.  To stress movement is
 often to evade the question of aims.  We do
 not intend to evade this question.  By pro-
 viding a forum in which academic and prac-
 titioner, teacher and school administrator,
 may participate in a constructive and criti-
 cal dialogue, the urban Review sets out de-
 liberately                                                                                         to  enrich  the             definition  and
 further the achievements of the aims of
 education.
 I am pleased to see the Center of Ur-
 ban Education in operation and to wel-
 come its new publication and to com-
 mend it to my colleagues.

 CONGRESSIONAL 'RECORD - APPENDIX        August 29,'14.766
 Catholic Schools Are Integrated
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. ABRAHAM J. MULTER
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 29, 1966
 Mr. MULTER.  Mr. Speaker, an irre-
 sponsible charge has been made that
 Catholic parochial schools are segregated
 schools and a haven for racists who wish
 to escape New York City's integrated
 public school system.
 This allegation is simply not true.  I
 comlxiend to the attention of our col-
 leagues the statement of the Right Rever-
 end Monsignor George A. Kelly, secre-
 tary for education of the archdiocese of
 New York, made at a public meeting of
 New York City's Board of Education on
 August 17, 1966.  Monsignor Kelly's re-
 cital of the facts makes it incumbent
 upon those  making    these  ridiculous
 charges to retract their statements.
 Monsignor Kelly's remarks follow:
 CATHOLIC'SCHOOLS ARE INTEGRATED
 (Statement of the Right Reverend Monsig-
 nor George A. Kelly, secretary for educa-
 tion,  archdiocese  of New York, public
 meeting, board of education, August 17,
 1966)
 "While the subject of Public Law 89-10
 is children, in particular disadvantaged chil-
 dren," at least that is what the President's
 National Advisory Council tells us, it in-
 doors on an equal basis to Negro and white
 children alike.  And, if in the United States
 there is a flight from the inner city to the
 suburbs, for a variety of reasons, most of
 which have nothing to do with education,
 then the Catholic school system which is
 heavily rooted in the city must suffer in
 much the same manner that the public
 school system suffers in its effort to provide
 similar education for larger and larger num-
 bers of poor children.
 And I must respectfully remind the Board
 of Education that when we talk about the
 school system of  the  Catholic diocese of
 New York and Brooklyn, we are talking about
 a real school  system with almost 400,000
 children  perhaps one  of  the  five  largest
 school systems in the United States, public
 or non-public.
 But let us go to the charges.  And since
 we  are  talking about the  application    of
 Public Law 89-10, I will confine my remarks
 to elementary school children, and, while
 I will draw on data culled from the office of
 the New York Superintendent which super-
 vises schools in Manhattan, Bronx and Staten
 Island, Monsignor Molloy assures me that
 comparable  data  are  available  from  the
 Superintendent of schools of the Brooklyn
 diocese.
 First question. Have the parochial schools
 in New York increased their enrollment?
 Answer. No.   In 1956 there were 105,490
 children attending Catholic schools In New
 York: in 1966 there are 105,695 children at-
 tending                                                                                   Catholic  schools  in  Manhattan,
 Bronx, and Staten Island.  If a bridge had
 not been thrown over the Narrows, there
 would only be 94,000 children in these schools
 today.  Since the 6,000 deficit in that 10
 year period for Manhattan. and the Bronx
 was made up only by a 6,000 increase on
 Staten Island, due to children coming from

 I have only discovered 22 of these Catholic
 schools without Negroes, and of these 22
 schools, nine were specifically erected to edu-
 cate Italian, Polish, and German children.
 Only five of these 133 schools lack Spanish
 enrollment, and here again two of the parish
 schools involved are Italian in composition.
 Let me now make a point which the critics
 of Catholic schools never make: The very
 existence of the parochial school has helped
 to make or to keep many neighborhoods
 integrated.
 Since not even the most hopeful civil rights
 leaders expect to find integrated elementary
 schools in Riverdale or Belle Harbor, let us
 now look at districts where hopefully one
 might find a mixed ethnic composition in
 both public and parochial schools.
 The  Ethnic  composition  of  the  parish
 schools in the following areas of Manhattan
 and the Bronx are as follows:

 Only in six of these fourteen areas, white
 children make up a predominate body of
 Catholic school enrollment.  As a matter of
 fact, only in two districts can one find so
 called "lily white" catholic schools.
 Let us approach this problem of integra-
 tion as the Board of Education has, one in
 evaluating the public school system's efforts.
 An "X" school was defined as one with 90
 percent of a minority group enrollment.  A
 "Y" school is one with 90 percent white
 population.
 A "mid-range" school is that school whose
 population  composition  lies  between. two
 extremes.   On this basis the City Superin-
 tendent of schools was happy to report this
 year that 50.4 percent of the public schools
 of New York City .are "mid-range," and only
 49.6 percent can be found in the "X or Y"
 categories.

 This would suggest, It seems to me:, that

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                     20173
 Mr:' FULBRIGHT.` Mr. President, I
 do not know whether I make myself
 clear:  This exploration of all the ave-
 nues, and the constant reiteration that
 there is no dearth of communication
 with the other side, I accept.  But com-
 munication is not the same as developing
 some basis upon which one might reach
 an agreement.
 I think this is a very important matter,
 because there seems to be something
 very mysterious about the *arbitrariness
 of the enemy in refusing to meet or to
 negotiate.  I think we should try to un-
 derstand that.  If the Senator could,
 I wish he would indicate any statements
 which went to the substance of the agree-
 ment, other than "we want to negotiate
 unconditionally." Usually that means-
 without exception, in my opinion-that
 the other side stop what it is doing,
 which seems to me a rather sterile for-.
 mula. On what basis could we agree?
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  If the Senator will
 yield, I am certain that the President
 has said that he would consider a cease-
 fire if it were mutual.  I believe the
 Secretary of State has said the same
 thing.
 I would point out also that in August
 of last year, the President enunciated 9
 points-they have been added to since, to
 the extent of 14 points-on which we
 would sit down and negotiate the dilll-
 cults.
 There has only been one contact, that
 I know of, direct with Hanoi, and that
 was through the American Ambassador
 to Burma, who did receive a message
 during the 37-day pause earlier this year.
 number of suggestions which indicated
 his desire, by means of various  ap-
 proaches, to reach the conference table.
 On August 3 of last year, I put in
 the Rxcoan a set of nine proposals which
 he had made, in one speech, relative to
 his desire to bring this barbarous and
 miserable conflict to a close.
 I pointed out then that what the Presi-
 dent was doing was extending the olive
 even as the arrows were flying in the hope
 that it would be successful in achieving
 a conference.
 I commended the President for the
 frankness he showed by making these
 proposals in public and expressed the
 hope that those interested in peace, who
 have eyes to see and ears to hear, and
 can recognize print when they see it,
 would take into consideration the nine
 points he made at that time.
 Earlier this year the administration,
 in the person of the Secretary of State,
 acting, of course, for the President, in-
 dicated that there were 14 points which
 were open for consideration in the ad-
 ministration's desire to reach the peace
 table.
 First. The Geneva Agreements of 1954
 and 19G2 are an adequate basis for peace
 in southeast Asia.  Everybody seems to
 be agreed on that, but nobody does any-
 thing about it.
 Second, We would welcome a confer-
 ence on southeast Asia or any part
 thereof.
 Third. We would welcome "negotia-
 tions without preconditions," as the 17
 neutral nations proposed early last year.
 Fourth. We would welcome uncondi-
 tional discussions, as president Johnson
 put it.
 Fifth. A cessation of hostilities could
 be the first order of business at a con-
 ference or could be the subject of pre-
 liminary discussions.
 -Mr. MANSFIELD.  Seventh, we want
 no U.S. bases in southeast Asia.
 There have been allegations lately to
 the effect that we desire to maintain a
 permanent foothold on the southeast
 Asian mainland. A start has been made
 on the construction of various kinds of
 installations in Thailand and near Cam
 Ranh Bay in South Vietnam.  We have
 no desire to maintain any kind of per-
 manent foothold many part of south-
 east Asia.  I cannot emphasize  that
 point too much.
 Eighth. We do not desire to retain
 U.S. troops in South Vietnam after peace
 is secured.
 Ninth. We support free elections in
 South Vietnam to give the South Viet-
 namese a government of their own
 choice.
 Incidentally, may I say that those
 elections are to, be held on the 11th of
 September. Frankly, I do not anticipate
 much from them because I do not think
 they will include all of the Vietnamese
 population of South Vietnam.  The so-
 called neutralists are excluded, and so
 are the Vietcong.
 I would like to know how anyone can
 tell the difference between a Vietcong
 and a citizen of South Vietnam loyal to
 the  present  government.   They  look
 alike, they talk alike, and they have the
 same traditions and customs.
 I think they should be allowed to vote
 to show how strong or weak they are;
 then we would have a better idea of what
 we are up against in Vietnam Itself.
 Tenth. The question of reunification
 of Vietnam should be determined by the
 Vietnamese through their own free de-
 cision.
 Eleventh. The countries of southeast
 Asia can be nonaligned or neutral if that.
 That message, I understand, was trans-
 mitted to Hanoi, but there was no reac-
 tion to it.
 I do not know just how far we can go,
 unless we lay down our arms. While I
 have my doubts, and have had for a long
 time, about the advisability of our ever
 getting into Vietnam, we are in there
 now;' we cannot withdraw, and we have
 to find a way to the conference table, to
 the end that this miserable conflict can
 be brought to an honorable conclusion.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Mr. President, I
 raised this question for the express pur-
 pose of trying to elicit from the majority
 leader and others a suggestion or state-
 ment that would give a reason for people
 like President de Gaulle and Prince
 Sihanouk to meet with our representa-
 tives and discuss the matter.  I do not
 know, frankly, what it is we will say-
 the real minimum basis for negotiation.

 These are concrete suggestions cover-

 there is to be negotiation, it will take at
 least two.  I would like to see the time
 come when we would go to the conference

 that objective.

 ment on General de Gaulle's coming visit
 to Cambodia excellent and worthy of
 close reading and consideration.  I hope
 it will give heart to General de Gaulle
 and. thought to our administration in
 their joint search, though by different
 paths, for a stable and peaceful world.

 WORLDWIDE MILITARY
 COMMITMENTS
 Mr.  STENNIS,   Mr.  President,  on
 Thursday, August 25, 1966, the Prepared-
 ness Investigating Subcommittee opened
 its hearing into our worldwide military
 commitments and our ability to respond
 to them.,  The Honorable Dean Rusk,
 Secretary of State, was our first witness,
 In view of the importance and signifl-
 cance of this study and inquiry, I believe
 that it would be well for all Members of
 the Congress as well as the other citi-
 zens of the Nation to be informed of its
 nature, purpose, and scope.  Therefore,
 I ask unanimous consent that my open-
 ing statement at the hearing last Thurs-
 day be placed in the RECORD at this point.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered. to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 OPENING  -STATEMENT   BY   SENATOR   JOHN
 STENNrs, CHAIRMAN, PREPAREDNESS INVESTI-
 GATING SUBCOMMITTEE, SENATE COMMITTEE
 ox ARMED SEavICEs, AUGUST 25, 1966
 Today we open hearings on the extent and
 nature of our worldwide military commit-
 meats and our ability to respond to them.
 We are pleased to have the Honorable Dean
 Rusk, Secretary of State, as,our first witness
 In this important Inquiry.
 We believe that this study and inquiry
 has a special  significance.   It marks the
 first occasion, so far as we have been able
 to determine, when the legislative branch
 of the government has consciously under-
 taken a careful and deliberate assessment
 and survey of our military commitments and
 an evaluation of what is required of us and
 our allies in manpower, equipment and other
 resources if we are to be able to respond to
 these commitments,
 It Is our hope that, through this study,
 Congress will be provided with factual In-
 formation which will serve as a measuring
 rod against which to assess our strengths and
 our weaknesses as emergencies occur and as
 additional military commitments are being
 considered.  Such a measuring rod.-avail-
 able in advance and kept up to date as far
 as possible--should be of immense value to
 I ~IONAL RECORD - SENATE          August 29, 1966
 tress in the future, since, with such
 ,lion already developed, the Congress
 be forced to rely entirely on hastily
 ed statements, information and esti-
 mstes presented to us by the executive de-
 partment in times of emergency or semi-
 emergency.
 This information will be useful to the en-
 tire Congress but particularly to the Senate
 since it is to the Senate that all of the
 treaties by which we assume military com-
 mitments and obligations to other nations
 are referred for approval or rejection.
 Although both the facts and the policy
 with respect to the military Implications of
 this matter necessarily overlap to some ex-
 tent, we do not expect to infringe or intrude
 upon the most useful and valuable functions
 discharged by the Committee on Foreign Re-
 lations.  We are primarily interested in the
 extent of our military commitments and our
 ability to respond to them-in short, whether
 or not we are or may be over-extended either
 now or in the future.
 These questions are of direct and primary
 concern to the military committees of the
 Congress since it is through these commit-
 tees, and the Committees on Appropriations,
 that the Congress discharges its obligation to
 provide for the common defense and raise
 and support our military forces.  To do this
 effectively we must have all facts which are
 necessary to enable us to reach informed and
 intelligent conclusions.
 Secretary Rusk said in his appearance be-
 fore the Senate Committee on Foreign Rela-
 tions last February that there were over 40
 countries with which we have formal agree-
 ments committing us to assist them militar-
 ily in the event of aggression.  This Indicates
 the magnitude of our global commitments.
 It Indicates also that, as a truly world power,
 we cannot afford to become overly preoccu-
 pied with one area of the world or one set of
 problems.  We cannot let the requirements
 and demands of Southeast Asia, for example,
 degrade the importance of the NATO area
 which is still the decisive region for the
 United States  and  Western Europe.   Al-
 though changes in and reductions of force
 commitments may be inevitable, it is still of
 primary importance that we and our NATO
 allies maintain adequate forces for deter-
 rence and defense.
 Yet we axe faced with the hard fact that
 a relatively small and undeveloped country
 such as North Vietnam has boon able to tie
 us down and require a very substantial com-
 mitment of our military manpower and re-
 sources  over  many  months.  This  clearly
 shows us what we can and must expect if
 similar wars of aggression or similar out-
 breaks should occur at other points around
 the world.  This also makes it necessary that
 we face up realistically to the situation and
 make a hardheaded and realistic assessment
 of the problems with which we would be con-
 fronted if two, three or more of such contin-
 gencies should occur simultaneously.
 The Congress needs and must have all- of
 the facts.  We cannot afford to be satisfied
 with rosy generalizations to the effect that
 we are fully prepared to meet all of our
 treaty commitments throughout the world.
 We must have the facts and, in the last
 analysis, may very well have to make a dis-
 tinction between what we are willing to do
 and what we are reasonably able to do within
 the limits of our military manpower, re-
 sources and assets.
 Further, we must think in terms of using
 our manpower and resources in such a way
 that we will protect ourselves; we must guard
 against over commitment that would drain
 away our manpower and resources and thus
 leave us weakened and unable to protect
 ourselves.
 Further, we are concerned about the mili-
 tary capability of our allies, as well as their
 willingness to respond In times of emergency.
 Among other matters which we propose
 to examine and study to a degree as we pro-
 ceed with this matter is our military aid pro-
 gram and the status and effectiveness of it.
 To the extent possible, open hearings will
 he held on this matter.  However, it Is clear
 that the great majority of the testimony .
 will have to be taken behind closed doors for
 security reasons.  Secretary Rusk will appear
 before us again which shall include a closed
 session.
 Secretary Rusk today will give us a broad
 view of our worldwide commitments and will
 also address himself specifically to NATO and
 its problems.  If a question is asked inad-
 vertently which would require getting into
 classified . Information  for an  appropriate
 response, I am sure that he will call this to
 our attention and we will reserve the ques-
 tion and the answer to the executive session.
 We shall address this matter in all phases
 and by important areas to the extent pos-
 sible.  We will first take up the NATO area
 and when we complete that go on to the Rio
 Pact, SEATO, CENTO and other areas.
 GEN. BERNARD A. SCHRIEVER
 Mr. STENNIS.  Mr. President, August
 31, 1966, will in a sense, mark the end of
 an era.  On that date Gen. Bernard. A.
 Schriever, commander of the Air Force
 Systems Command, will retire and thus
 bring to a close one of the most brilliant,
 outstanding, and remarkable careers in
 our recent military history.  Both the
 Department of the Air Force and the
 Nation as a whole will be much the poor-
 er as a result.
 The distinguished and invaluable serv-
 ice which General Schiever, an immi-
 grant boy, has rendered 'to his adopted
 country during his career of snore than
 30 years assures him of a large place in
 our military history. In various com-
 mands since 1954, culminating with the
 Air Force Systems Command, he had a
 primary and decisive role in the develop-
 ment of the intercontinental ballistic
 missiles upon which we rely so heavily to
 deter would-be aggressors.
 It is well known that our ballistic mis-
 siles became a reality despite widespread
 doubt and skepticism among many in-
 formed people about their technical feasi-
 bility.  It was General Schriever who was
 responsible for pushing forward research
 and development on all technical phases
 of our Atlas, Titan, and Minuteman mis-
 siles and for providing concurrently the
 launching sites, equipment, tracking fa-
 cilities, and ground support equipment
 necessary  to  missile  operations. The
 propulsion,  guidance,  and  structural
 techniques so developed have played a
 vital role in our space program.   Most
 NASA launchings have been with Air
 Force developed propulsion systems. -
 I could say much more about General
 Schriever and  his many and      varied
 achievements.  However, it is sufficient
 to say that his guiding genius and vision
 in pointing the way will remain a major
 influence on Air Force development and
 technology for many years to come.  His
 stamp is indeed indelible.
 This is one of the most remarkable
 achievements of our time and of many
 years prior thereto.
 On a personal note, let me say that I
 have worked very closely with General
 Schriever over the years.  He has ap-
 peared as a witness on many occasions
