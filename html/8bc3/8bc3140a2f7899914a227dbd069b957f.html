 Far East
 VIETNAM
 There were more incidents and casualties during the
 New Year's cease-fire than at Christmastime.   The
 Viet Cong used the respite to infiltrate US Marine
 defense positions and to unload supplies from large
 trawlers off the coast of the delta.   The Constituent
 Assembly continues its work on a draft constitution,
 but the issue of the government's veto and amendment
 power remains unresolved.   Hanoi continues to insist
 on its well-established terms for negotiations, but
 appears to be making an effort to project a more
 reasonable image.
 COMMUNIST AID TO NORTH VIETNAM IN 1966
 Communist economic and military assistance to North
 Vietnam in 1966 may have reached a value of $500 mil-
 lion.   Most of it was directly related to needs aris-
 ing from the war, but both the USSR and China contin-
 ued to supply some development aid.

 NEW TURMOIL IN CHINA'S  "CULTURAL REVOLUTION"
 The leadership crisis appears to be moving into a new
 phase that will be even more disorderly and disruptive
 than the previous one.   Attacks on senior leaders are
 being stepped up,  and a new "cultural revolution" drive
 has been ordered in factories and villages.

 FAR EAST
 Hanoi is attempting to reinforce pressures on
 the US for a unilateral initiative--particularly a
 cessation of air strikes against the North--to move
 the Vietnam war toward negotiations.   Ho Chi Minh
 and Premier Pham Van Dong stressed to Western jour-
 nalists that the US must make the first steps and
 that North Vietnam is determined to persist indef-
 initely if Washington refuses to make concessions.
 Their statements were also calculated to emphasize
 Hanoi's independence of foreign  (Chinese)  domina-
 tion and to portray its terms for settlement as
 moderate and reasonable.   Hanoi scornfully rejected
 the British proposal for talks between North Viet-
 nam and the US and South Vietnam.
 Communist forces in South Vietnam attempted
 to use the New Year truce period to offload sup-
 plies in the delta and to infiltrate US Marine
 positions. In Saigon,  the Constituent Assembly
 has concluded its discussion of "basic principles"
 for the new constitution and will now move on to
 drafting detailed provisions.
 The "cultural revolution" in China appears to
 be entering a new phase that will be even more dis-
 orderly and disruptive.   In what may be final prep-
 arations for the public dismissal of Liu Shao-chi
 and Teng Hsiao-ping, Red Guard posters reportedly
 asserted that Mao and Lin Piao have personally de-
 nounced the two men and demonstrations against them
 have been held almost daily in the past two weeks.
 Although Indonesian President Sukarno continues
 to profess confidence in his ability to outmaneuver
 his opponents, he can do no more than fight a hold-
 bl
 b
 y
 a
 ing action.   The movement to depose him pro
 will gather momentum when congress reconvenes in
 mid-January.

 The Military Situation
 In South Vietnam
 The 48-hour New Year's truce
 between opposing forces in South
 Vietnam was marred by a greater
 number of incidents and casual-
 ties to both the Viet Cong and
 US forces than in the two-day
 Christmas respite.
 .A total of 169 Communist-
 initiated incidents were reported,
 67 more than in the 24-25 Decem-
 ber cease-fire period.   Most of
 the incidents were limited ac-
 tions involving short bursts of
 small-arms fire directed against
 US patrols or encampments.   There
 were 53 instances, however,  in
 which exchanges of fire resulted
 in casualties.
 For example, on 31 December
 a US infantry company in the
 western highlands of Kontum Prov-
 ince was attacked and engaged for
 more than five hours by a Viet
 Cong/North Vietnamese Army Force
 estimated at battalion size.   On
 the same date a heavily armed
 Viet Cong force of about 1,000
 combat troops attempted to use
 the cease-fire to infiltrate US
 Marine defensive positions west-
 northwest of Hue,  in northern
 coastal Thua Thien Province.
 A third major incident oc-
 curred on 1 January when two
 Communist steel-hulled trawlers
 unloading cargo on the southeast-
 ern coast of South Vietnam's
 southernmost province, An Xuyen,
 attacked US Navy coastal surveil-
 lance units with heavy machine-
 gun fire.   US forces returned
 the fire,  sinking one trawler
 and heavily damaging the other.
 Friendly casualties sus-
 tained during the 31 December -
 1 January truce included 23
 killed  (17 US)  and 41 wounded
 (27 US).   Known enemy losses
 totaled 41 killed and 20 cap-
 tured.
 No significant contact
 with large enemy troop concen-
 trations has occurred since
 the resumption of allied search-
 and-destroy operations on 2 Jan-
 uary
 Constituent Assembly
 South Vietnam's Constituent
 Assembly continues to make prog-
 ress on drafting a constitution,
 although its relations with the
 government remain unsettled.
 On 3 January, the assembly
 concluded its debate on basic
 constitutional principles and
 assigned subcommittees to for-
 mulate an initial detailed
 draft.   The assembly agenda

 calls for a plenary debate on
 the draft to begin on 11 Jan-
 uary.                     Some delegates estimate
 that these deliberations will
 be completed by late February.
 11owever, pr:)biems will un-
 doubtedly arise  given though the
 outline of the fiture government
 and the general principles of the
 constitution havE  been agreed
 upon.   Several snnecific issues
 which aroused controversy still
 remains to be resolved.   The as-
 sembly's rate of progress will
 generally depend upon the degree
 and the type of detail it attempts
 to =insert in the constitution.
 Meanwhile,  108 of 117 dele-
 gates have taken an oath to "de-
 fend" the assembly's final ver-
 sion of the constitution,  follow-
 i_ng the government's formal re-
 Eusal last week to relinquish
 its partial veto power. However,
 it remains uncertain whether the
 assembly would it fact be able
 to muster the twc-thirds majority
 vote necessary tc override any
 government amendments.   In order
 to avoid this situation--which
 would mean a loss of prestige
 for one side or the other--as-
 semblymen hope that the govern-
 ment will deliver any official
 suggestions it may have while the
 constitution is still being
 drafted.
 Hanoi on Nego tiations
 A Hanoi repr?sentative com-
 mented for the .fi--st time on
 Page 4
 5 January on recent efforts by
 US Ambassador. Goldberg and
 U Thant to probe Hanoi's in-
 tentions.   The DRV representa-
 tive in Paris, Mai Van Bo,  in
 an interview with Western news-
 men characterized Ambassador
 Goldberg's efforts as an "old
 song" and rejected any inter-
 vention in Vietnam by the UN.
 Prior to this statement,
 Hanoi propaganda media had
 handled the 19 December US
 letter to U Thant with consid-
 erable restraint.   Both Moscow
 and Peking quickly denounced
 the US initiative.   Hanoi's
 initial restraint conveyed an
 image of reasonableness, prob-
 ably in response to world-
 wide pressures for a cessation
 of hostilities during the year-
 end holidays.   Hanoi has fre-
 quently been advised by some
 of its allies to try to iden-
 tify with such free-world sen-
 timents and to improve its pub-
 lic image by appearing more
 moderate and reasonable on the
 subject of a negotiated settle-
 ment.
 Throughout this same time
 period, however, North Vietnam-
 ese leaders, when addressing
 foreign audiences, emphasized
 the necessity for the US to
 take the first step and-usually
 defined this as an unconditional
 cessation of the bombings.   In
 a 2 January interview with Der
 Spiegel, President Ho Chi Minh
 claimed that peace would return

 immediately once the "US stopped
 its aggression" and called for
 both a cessation of the bombings
 and withdrawal of US troops.
 All DRV statements remained ex-
 ceedingly vague about what North
 Vietnam might do in exchange for
 such a US concession.   The DRV
 representative in Paris,  for ex-
 ample, was quoted by Western press
 sources on 5 January, as promising
 only that an American approach for
 a Vietnam settlement, after a
 bombing cessation, would "be ex-
 amined" by his government.
 In a series of year-end speeches
 to domestic audiences DRV leaders
 underscored Vietnamese determina-
 tion to continue the fighting un-
 til they have achieved their basic
 and long-standing demands.   Both
 First Party Secretary Le Duan
 and Defense Minister Vo Nguyen
 Giap this week warned their
 people that they could expect
 harder times in 1967, and Giap
 characterized the DRV four-point
 proposal for a settlement of the
 war as  "fundamental aspirations"
 and "our unshakable position."

 SF CRET
 COMMUNIST AID TO NORTH VIETNAM IN 1966
 Communist economic and mili-
 tary aid to North Vietnam may
 have reached a value of $500 mil-
 lion in 1966.   The USSR and China
 supplied most of the aid.   Lesser,
 in some cases to}:en,  amounts were
 supplied by the Fast European
 Communist countries, Mongolia,
 North Korea,  and Cuba.
 The bulk of the deliveries
 consisted of trarsportation equip-
 ment:, heavy machinery for building
 :roads and airfields, medical sup-
 ]plies,  small arms,  artillery,  and
 air-defense weapcns.   The volume
 apparently has been limited by
 Hanoi's ability to absorb supplies
 and equipment,  and in no case has
 the cost placed any significant
 burden on the economy of the sup-
 plier.
 Economic aid reached a new
 high last year--some $250 million
 :_n value--and is likely to grow

 and machinery become necessary to
 maintain Hanoi's economy and re-
 pair war damage.   New aid agree-
 ments--many in the form of grants--
 were signed with all Communist
 countries except Yugoslavia in
 September and October.   Although
 the aid has gone mostly toward
 meeting needs created directly
 by the war,  the USSR is helping
 to build a number of electric
 power plants and to develop coal
 mines,  and Chinese are continuing
 to assist in construction of the
 Thai Nguyen steel plant.
 Military aid in 1966 probably
 also reached about $250 million,
 matching 1965 outlays.   Unless
 major new weapons systems--such
 as coastal defense missiles or
 ships to establish an effective
 naval force--are introduced,  de-
 liveries could slacken in 1967.
 Hanoi and Haiphong are probably
 already the most heavily defended
 cities in the history of air war-

 continue supplying artillery,
 vehicles,  small arms,  and radar,
 as well as replacement aircraft,
 surface-to-air missiles,  and anti-
 aircraft artillery.                                                                              China's main
 contribution will continue to be
 small arms, vehicles,   and some
 technical assistance.

 SUKARNO ATTEMPTING TO COUNTER PRESSURES FOR HIS REMOVAL
 Indonesian President Sukarno,
 in the face of growing pressure
 for his removal, has been trying
 to wrest the initiative away from
 his opposition.
 Sukarno has been emboldened
 by differences among his opponents
 and by hesitation by his powerful
 antagonist, General Suharto, to
 force a final showdown.   He has
 demanded that the cabinet be re-
 shuffled in his favor and has
 threatened to dissolve the con-
 gress.   At various times in the
 past few weeks he has alternately
 threatened to resign, refused to
 resign, threatened to go abroad,
 refused to go abroad, agreed to
 explain his past policies, refused
 to explain his past policies,
 and demanded increased funds.
 Despite a 21 December joint
 declaration of unity by the chiefs
 of the armed forces, their subse-
 quent series of meetings with Su-
 karno proved inconclusive in
 clarifying Sukarno's future role.
 Sukarno has succeeded in add-
 ing to the public confusion and
 the general restlessness among
 some of General Suharto's more
 "hawkish" colleagues.   Although
 Sukarno is reported to profess
 optimism over his prospects for
 a comeback,  in the final analysis
 he can probably do no more than
 fight a holding action.   The
 press is being encouraged to de-
 nounce him and the movement to
 oust him by constitutional means     25X1
 will probably receive new impetus
 when congress reconvenes in mid-
 January.

 NEW TURMOIL IN CHINA'S "CULTURAL REVOLUTION"
 China's leadership crisis
 appears to be moving into a new
 phase that will be even more
 disorderly and disruptive than
 the previous one.   Attacks on
 senior leaders are being stepped
 up in tempo and intensity,  and
 a new "cultural revolution" drive
 has been ordered in factories
 and villages..
 Red Guard posters displayed
 in Peking on 5 January reportedly
 assert that Mao Tse-tung and
 heir-apparent Lin Piao have per-
 sonally denounced chief of state
 Liu Shao-chi and party general
 secretary.Teng Hsiao-ping.  Ral-
 lies and demonstrations have
 been held almost daily in the
 past two weeks to denounce the
 two,  apparently in preparation
 for their public dismissal.
 In Mao's reported criticism,
 he bitterly complained that Liu
 and Teng had ignored his counsel
 --treated him like a "deceased
 parent"--during the past decade.
 He also charged that they had
 forced him out of the post of
 chief of state in 1958.   This
 appears to be a patent fabrica-
 tion,  since the transfer of this
 honorary post to Liu at that
 time seemed to be part of a de-
 liberate policy to groom him as
 Mao's successor.   No details of
 Lin Piao's denunciation are
 available yet
 Page  9
 On 31 December, Red Guard
 posters for the first time de-
 manded that former Peking mayor
 Peng Chen and other early vic-
 tims of the "cultural revolution"
 be executed.   During.the past
 week Red Guard posters and ban-
 ners have also directed their
 fire against several officials
 who seemingly have been in good
 standing.   These include three
 men who were brought into the
 party secretariat in July--Tao
 Chu, Liu Ning-i,  and Yeh Chien-
 ying.   Tao ranks fourth in the
 present hierarchy, Liu directs
 the All-China Federation of
 Trade Unions--apparently reor-
 ganized about 31 December--and
 Yeh Chien-ying is a member of
 the powerful Military Commission
 of the central committee.
 According to a Red Guard
 newspaper distributed on 5 Jan-
 uary, Tao Chu was denounced at
 a meeting on 4 January by Madame
 Mao and "cultural revolution"
 official Chen Po-ta as a "bour-
 geois reactionary" loyal to Liu
 and Teng.   Tao Chu reportedly
 was dragged around the streets
 of Peking by Red Guards on 5
 January.
 While tensions mount in Pe-
 king, orders have gone out to
 intensify the "cultural revolu-
 tion" in factories and farms.
 Party officials opposed to Mao
 and Lin continue to be the main
 target of this drive.

 SEC RE'i
 In the last two weeks,
 workers and peasants have been
 told to join in more vigorously,
 and Red Guards,  in a shift of
 policy emphasis, were encouraged
 to "exchange experiences" with
 workers.   All production units
 are thus exposed to the kind of
 politically inspired policies
 that brought vir:ual economic
 collapse during  :he 1958 "leap
 forward."  The permission is
 hedged with exhortations to main-
 -tarn and increase production,
 but there is no assurance that
 this will be an effective curb.
 With chaos reported in many
 factories even before "cultural
 revolution" agitation on their
 oremises was permitted,  it is
 :.zot likely that Eroduction will
 fare well if--as a number of
 sources have indicated--workers
 and peasants'  orcanizations led
 by activists take over manage-
 ment and are urged on by inspec-
 tion teams of outsiders with no
 appreciation of production proc-
 esses.
 The regime itself seems to
 be losing the economic realism
 of recent years.   Year-end claims
 --for the first time since the
 original "leap forward"--consist
 of outright falsehoods,  apparently
 to promote the belief that China
 is ready for another leap.
 up to 150 percent in a year.
 Instead of the usual at-
 tempt to mislead by unverifiable
 and meaningless claims, Peking
 now states flatly that in 1966,
 China had the biggest grain crop
 in history.   In fact, however,
 it was almost certainly less
 than the mediocre 1965 harvest.
 The claim was also made that in-
 dustrial output increased 20
 percent in 1966.   Many factories
 have been cited as examples where
 forces released by the revolution
 have brought production increases

 EUROPE
 The Christmas and New Year cease-fire arrange-
 ments in Vietnam again focused Western Europe's at-
 tention on the war.   The failure of some West European
 leaders to generate further peace moves seems to
 have reinforced an already pessimistic attitude to-
 ward peace prospects.
 De Gaulle,  during the New Year holiday,  issued
 two statements, his most critical yet of US policy
 in Vietnam.   He has previously called for unilateral
 US withdrawal, but in tones less sharp.   He ap-
 parently now feels that his position,  and his claim
 to a part for France in any postwar settlement, will
 get wider support.   Nevertheless,  the French press
 has criticized his castigation of the US as solely
 responsible for the war.   In Britain, US policy in
 Vietnam is in for another rough time.   The press
 there is making much of stories of bombing in Hanoi,
 and it will be against this background that Parlia-
 ment, when it reconvenes next week, will further
 attack Foreign Minister Brown despite his latest
 appeal for talks between North and South Vietnam
 and the US.
 The Soviets last week used  their army journal
 to put on the public record an expression of their
 concern over the military implications of their
 quarrel with China.   Moscow drove home the point
 that--because of what Mao has done to the Chinese
 army--Russians have no alternative but to regard
 Chinese forces as potential enemies rather than
 allies.
 Yugoslavia marked the New Year with an amnesty
 which included most notably Milovan Djilas, Tito's
 one-time comrade in arms and heir apparent, whose
 bold criticism of Communism's failings have twice
 landed him in jail.   His release highlights a trend
 toward liberalization apparent in other ways as
 well in Yugoslavia, but the regime will have to
 watch him closely for it is not clear that he has
 yet been persuaded to refrain from criticizing re-
 gime policies.

 MOSCOW DISPLAYS CONCERN OVER TRENDS IN CHINESE ARMY
 The USSR is showing growing
 concern, both publicly and co-
 vertly,  over the military impli-
 cations of its dispute with China.
 An editorial in Red Star on
 29 December warned that Mao Tse-
 tung and Lin Piao are turning the
 Chinese Army into a "blind weapon"
 in their political offensive
 against the USSR.   The editorial
 charged that Peking is inculcating
 the Chinese military with chauvin-
 ism and animosity toward the Rus-
 sians in order to further aims
 Page 13
 "hostile to the interests of in-
 ternational socialism."   Red
 Star said that Peking refused to
 acknowledge the need to unite
 the military strength of Commu-
 nist states against "imperialism"
 even in the event of a new world
 war.
 A summary of the article was
 broadcast internationally,  indi-
 cating that it is meant as another
 propaganda thrust in Moscow's
 campaign against "Mao and his
 clique."   However,  the editorial

 FINNISH-SOVIET FRICTIONS RECUR
 Finnish Prime Minister Paasio
 faces an uncertain political fu-
 ture as a result of frictions
 which have developed with Moscow.
 The Russians are also dis-
 satisfied with the line which the
 SDP--the dominant party in Fin-
 land's four-party coalition gov-
 ernment--took on international
 issues at its November congress.
 This dissatisfaction was reflected
 in a recent Pravda article attack-
 ing the SDP for failing to condemn
 West German "revanchism," for its
 alleged disinclination to dis-
 associate itself from the pro-
 Western stance of the Socialist
 International, and for its refusal
 to align itself with the Finnish
 "peace" movement.
 went
 as far as they could to conciliate
 the Soviet Union in the foreign
 policy resolution adopted by the
 congress.   There are indications
 that even if the leadership had
 been inclined to be more accommo-
 dating to Moscow, ordinary dele-
 gates would have opposed further
 concessions.   The mood of the ma-
 jority of the delegates was appar-
 ent in the sharp defeats of reso-
 lutions and candidates for office
 supported by the left wing of the
 party.
 Notwithstanding the results
 of the congress, the Social Demo-
 crats made another conciliatory
 gesture toward Moscow in a pre-
 Christmas statement by their par-
 liamentary group stressing the
 importance to Finland of develop-
 ing "especially active,  friendly
 relations" with the Soviet Union.
 The pronouncement also declared
 that it was imperative to work
 for peace and security in Europe,
 and particularly for a "normali-
 zation of the German situation."
 The Soviets probably hope to
 secure further concessions by
 maintaining pressure on Paasio
 and the SDP leadership, who fear
 that another effort may be under
 way by Moscow to blackball the
 party.   Only last May the SDP
 emerged from eight years of po-
 litical isolation imposed by
 President Kekkonen and Moscow,
 and then only after winning a de-
 cisive election victory and "purg-
 ing" its leadership of outspoken
 anti-Soviet officials.
 Kekkonen's position in this
 latest dispute between the Social
 Democrats and Moscow is unclear.
 However,  if Paasio is unable to
 establish a satisfactory working
 relationship with the Soviet
 leaders, Kekkonen is likely to
 replace him with an individual
 more acceptable to the Soviet Un-

 SOVIET COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT SALES IN THE FREE WORLD LAGGING
 Soviet commercial aircraft
 salesmen continue to find a re-
 ceptive market it  less-developed
 countries attracted by discount
 prices and long-term credits but
 have had little success elsewhere
 in the free world.
 The USSR is  trying to re-
 cover its once-dcminant place in
 Guinea's civil air operations.
 It managed to sell three AN-24
 (Coke)  aircraft to Air Guinea this
 fall and in the process succeeded
 in blocking Pan American's efforts
 -.:o keep a role in Guinea's civil
 air business.   Some 40 Guinean
 pilots and technicians are now
 in Moscow completing a five-month
 training course on the AN-24.
 The Somali Republic--a new cus-
 tomer--has just taken delivery
 of 2: AN-24s.
 Soviet aircraft promoters,
 however, have made no headway in
 Latin America.   Recent negotia-
 .ion.s for the sale of AN-24s to a
 Brazilian airline apparently ran
 into trouble over arrangements
 for technical servicing, a factor
 which will continue to hinder
 Soviet efforts to develop new :mar-
 kets.   A three-week visit to Rio
 de Janeiro last month by Soviet
 aircraft production and export
 officials did not result in any
 sales contracts, but :Brazilian
 aviation representatives have
 been, invited to pay a return
 visit to Moscow.   The Soviet
 salesmen, one of whom went on to
 Chile from Brazil, may intend
 to make a promotion swing through-
 out Latin America.
 The Soviet sales campaign
 elsewhere in the West has been
 similarly unrewarding.   After
 conducting extensive demonstra-
 tion                                                                          flights of the IL-18  (Coot)
 in Sweden, Moscow met with a
 rebuff when the prospective
 customer, a charter company, de-
 cided to purchase American Boeing
 727 jets instead.   The Soviet
 aircraft export agency, Aviaexport,
 having failed to dent the Western
 market through its own efforts,
 now has contracted with a British
 air sales organization, Trade-
 planes,  for an export demonstra-
 tion base at London's Gatwick air--
 port.   The British firm will
 promote sales of the AN-24 and
 Soviet helicopters.
 Cooperative arrangements may
 also be developing between the
 French and Soviet aircraft indus-
 tries.   This subject was discussed
 when the Soviet minister of the
 aviation industry visited Paris
 in November.   At that time the
 USSR expressed an interest in ac-
 quiring French turboprop engines
 for use in its helicopters,  in
 exchange for Soviet high-powered

 TITO FREES ARCHCRITIC DJILAS
 Tito's decision to release
 his long-imprisoned archcritic,
 Milovan Djilas, on 31 December
 will probably add to the politi-
 cal turmoil that has continued
 to mount in Yugoslavia since the
 dismissal of the heir-apparent,
 Aleksandar Rankovic,  last summer.
 Yugoslavia's liberals may take
 some encouragement but conserva-
 tives may oppose Tito's policies
 more and. more openly.
 Djilas broke his parole in
 the early 1960s--he was jailed in
 1956 and released four years
 later--because he believed his
 political future would ultimately
 be served by the martyrdom of
 prison.   There are few indica-
 tions of what Djilas'  present in-
 tentions are, but his chances of
 regaining political prominence
 in the near future are slight.
 The liberals will view
 Djilas'  release with mixed emo-
 tions.                       Since his past ups and
 downs have been taken as a gauge
 of the regime's permissiveness,
 many now will be encouraged to
 intensify -their calls for greater
 freedom of debate and to press
 for a more meaningful electoral
 and parliamentary system.   Other
 liberals,  however, probably fear
 that Djilas will jeopardize
 the progress already made by
 pushing his more radical ideas.
 Djilas is anathema to the
 conservatives because in 1956
 he criticized Yugoslavia's au-
 thoritarian system and its privi-
 leged party bureaucracy, and in
 1962 implicitly challenged the
 regime by publishing his anti-
 Communist tract, Conversations
 With Stalin.   Rankovic's conserv-
 ative__bacckers  will probably re-
 gard Djilas' release as evidence
 of the regime's commitment to
 complete diffusion of party con-
 trol,  thus making more remote
 their chances of regaining sig-
 nificant influence in the regime.
 Although apparently still
 leaderless and disorganized,
 the conservatives will probably
 become more openly opposed to
 Tito's political and economic
 reforms.   Some of the ultra-
 conservatives may also attempt
 to show their displeasure through
 activities embarrassing to the
 regime,  such as occurred on 20
 and 23 December, when anti-Amer-
 ican demonstrations on the Viet-
 nam issue apparently led by pro-
 Rankovic elements got out of
 hand.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Some of the continuing problems in the area
 have taken on a new and,  in some cases, dangerous
 twist.
 In Africa, the Congo's Mobutu has proceeded
 willy nilly to take over Union Miniere's assets
 regardless of the potentially disastrous economic
 implications for his country.   Immediate tensions
 may have eased in Nigeria now that the long-sought
 meeting between Supreme Commander Gowon and Eastern
 Region military governor Ojukwu has finally taken
 place--in Ghana--but no reconciliation of divergent
 substantive issues is yet in sight.   The Smith re-
 gime in Rhodesia remains adamant despite the threat
 of economic sanctions, and the Zambian economy still
 stands to suffer the most from this dispute.
 Jordan remains the principal trouble spot in
 the Middle East as terrorist attacks protesting
 King Husayn's vacillation toward Israel continue.
 Husayn, however, has succeeded temporarily in put-
 ting off the stationing of Iraqi and Saudi troops
 in west Jordan until after the Arab Defense Coun-
 cil meets again in mid-February to consider his
 government's proposal to strengthen Arab forces
 on all fronts with Israel.   The military lull in
 Yemen was broken by recent Egyptian bombing, and
 it is questionable how long Saudi King Faysal can
 restrain the royalists from a renewed offensive.
 India now has enough food on hand--or in the
 pipeline--to see it through the general elections
 scheduled for 15 February, but the Congress Party
 still has strains in the leadership and faces more
 trouble from Hindu protestations over the slaughter
 of cows.   In Pakistan,  the return to political life
 after seven years of exile of many capable civil-
 ian politicians will provide an interesting weather-
 vane on the fortunes of Ayub's military government.
 The future of parliamentary democracy in Afghanistan
 is in doubt because of the King's growing dissatis-
 faction with Prime Minister Maiwandwal's conduct of
 government.

 JORDAN STILL TROUBLED BY SECURITY PROBLEMS
 King Husayn's regime had to
 ;contend last weekend with an out-
 break of terrorist bombings in
 Palestinian west Jordan and may
 -race a renewal of demonstrations
 against the regime there next week.
 On 1 January there were two
 explosions in Jerusalem, one near
 an office of the government's
 broadcasting service and the other
 inside the headquarters' compound
 of the security po-_ice.   Another
 bomb exploded the next day at the
 governor's office.
 the deployment of Iraqi and Saudi
 troops in west Jordan may herald
 the end of recent pro forma coop-
 eration on joint Arab defense plans
 against Israel.   The government
 apparently intends to stand firm
 against permitting foreign Arab
 troops on its territory, despite
 formal claims that it is ready to
 accept them.   The conditions it
 has attached to their entry are to
 be discussed at another meeting of
 the Arab Defense Council in mid-
 February, but it is doubtful
 whether Jordan will attend.
 These bombings, like the six
 in Amman in late December, caused
 Little damage and no casualties,
 but it is evident that the govern-

 Live in stopping the infiltration
 of terrorists and rlunitions from
 Syria.   The Palest:_ne Liberation
 Organization, broadcasting from
 Cairo, has claimed credit for the
 Jerusalem bombings, alleging that
 they  were  the wore: of one of its
 "army" brigades.
 Many observers in west Jordan
 believe that new demonstrations
 may occur there after the Muslim
 holy month of Ramadan ends on 11
 January.   The mass turnouts ex-
 pected at Friday morning prayers
 on. 13 January probably will create
 a particularly tense situation.
 The government is also anxious
 about the reopening of schools af-
 ter Ramadan vacation
 Jordan's maneuvers in reaction
 to radical Arab pressure favoring
 Amman has also called for an-
 other summit meeting of Arab chiefs
 of state,  stressing that it is un-
 realistic to assume any effective
 Arab military alliance can be
 forged until political antago-
 nisms within the Arab world are re-
 solved.   Jordan's request stated
 Amman was opposed to meetings
 other than at the summit since
 lower level meetings would not
 have the authority to reach mean-
 ingful decisions.
 This continuing inter-Arab dis-
 pute has been accompanied by brief
 clashes along the Israeli-Syrian
 border during the past week.   These
 incidents thus far have not re-
 sulted in any Israeli fatalities,
 often the signal for an Israeli

 by the Israelis of land mines near
 the Syrian frontier and a 3 January

 border which presumably was caused  25X1
 by Syrian-supported terrorists sug-
 gest that further trouble can be
 expected.

 MOBUTU SEIZES BELGIAN MINING COMPANY'S CONGOLESE ASSETS
 President Mobutu's confisca-
 tion of Union Miniere's Congolese
 assets on 1 January   could be dis-
 astrous for the Congo's   finances
 and eventually for Mobutu's own
 political position as well.   He
 apparently is still hunting for a
 way out of the impasse, but there
 is no sign that Union Miniere is
 particularly interested in com-
 promise.
 Mobutu's government has set
 up a new company to run Union
 Miniere's activities in the Congo.
 Unlike the provisional adminis-
 trative council which  he estab-
 lished on 23 December, all of the
 new company's directors are Con-
 golese,  and the Congolese Govern-
 ment will hold 60 percent of its
 stock. On 15 January, unless
 Union Miniere pays the $150 mil-
 lion or more that Mobutu says it
 owes the Congo, the extensive
 Congolese interests of the related
 Societe Generale holding company
 allegedly are to be seized as
 well.
 Contrary to what the Congo-
 lese apparently expected, Union
 Miniere has shown no inclination
 to yield on important points.  The
 company--as well as Societe
 Generale--seems to have decided
 that now is a good time to get
 out of the Congo.   Both concerns
 have extensive interests outside
 the country and are in sound
 shape financially even without
 their Congolese holdings.
 Kinshasa's financial situa-
 tion, on the other hand, is be-
 coming critical.  Union Miniere
 is the source of about 70 percent
 of the Congo's foreign exchange,
 and the flow from this source
 has been cut off since 20 Decem-
 ber.   The Congo will not be as-
 sured of its foreign exchange un-
 less it can work out firm market-
 ing arrangements for its copper.
 Union Miniere, the most readily
 available agent, has said it will
 not do any marketing under pres-
 ent circumstances.   The company
 has also threatened to take legal
 action to attach any copper the
 new Congolese company does ex-
 port.   Even if there is no liti-
 gation,  it will take precious
 time to start foreign exchange
 flowing in again.
 Meanwhile,  activity in the
 Katanga mining region has al-
 ready been disrupted.   The com-
 pany's accounts in Katanga are
 blocked,  and no one is being
 paid.   The board of the new Con-
 golese company has yet to provide
 any firm direction,  and communi-
 cations with Brussels are almost
 nonexistent.   Perhaps most im-
 portant, the 2,100 Europeans
 essential to continued mineral

 production are growing increas-
 ingly nervous.   Company officials,
 who are still running the mines,
 are trying to keep departures
 to a minimum--in part because a
 rapid outflow might stimulate
 Mobutu to use force to restrain
 any remaining Europeans.   A sub-
 stantial and perhaps disruptive
 reduction in the European work
 force seems inevitable, however,
 unless Mobutu can provide the
 whites with credi:ole guarantees
 of personal safety and salary.
 Mobutu's position does not
 appear to be jeopardized for the
 time being by his moves.   Over
 the long run, however,  the eco-
 nomic disruption caused by the
 dispute is likely to have social
 and political repercussions which
 Mobutu will have trouble control-
 ling.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Four Latin American governments have recently
 undergone ministerial changes or made moves in that
 direction.   This has strengthened the stability of
 two of them but sharpened political tensions in the
 other two.
 Argentine President Ongania's replacement of
 two of his regime's four senior cabinet officials
 last week may have been timed to preclude a demand
 by the military for such changes.   The cabinet shuf-
 fle may temporarily lessen military and public criti-
 cism.
 In Bolivia, quarreling over patronage among
 the parties in the tenuous government coalition led
 the labor and agriculture ministers to resign on
 28 December, which in turn sparked pro forma resig-
 nation offers from the rest of the cabinet.   Presi-
 dent Barrientos, who may have staged the "crisis"
 himself, emerged with his authority enhanced, his
 cabinet intact, and his political base probably
 strengthened.
 A petulant opposition-controlled congress in
 Peru censured President Belaunde's education minis-
 ter for no good reason last week,  thereby automati-
 cally forcing the minister's resignation.   Such tac-
 tics have eliminated nine cabinet ministers during
 Belaunde's term, and the military is reported
 highly irritated.
 Meanwhile the latest spat between Guyana's
 Prime Minister Burnham and his coalition partner,
 Finance Minister D'Aguiar, continues as the two men
 consider further cabinet changes beyond those re-
 cently decreed by Burnham.   The main sticking point
 is whether Burnham or D'Aguiar is to control the
 economic development portfolio.   This issue--plus a
 host of others--could wreck the coalition with little
 or no warning.

 FIDEL. CASTRO'S EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY ADDRESS
 Iidel Castrc's speech on
 2 January commemorating the
 eighth anniversary of the Cuban
 revolution was a routine, compar-
 tively low-key address that gave
 no indications of  changes in pol-
 icy.
 Much of the speech was de-
 voted to a somewlat inflated ver-
 ,ion of his regime's achievements
 in public health,  education,  in-
 clustry, and agriculture.   He prom-
 ised continued repid economic de-
 velopment in spite of such draw-
 jacks as a seriot.s lack of ex-
 Derienced technicians and trained
 )ersonnel.
 Obviously irritated by US
 efforts to block Cuban trade with
 ,:countries of the free world,
 Castro lashed out at the "economic
 blockade," describing it as  "a
 -aolicy that consists of trying to
 spread hunger amcng the masses."
 Cuba currently has several im-
 ?ortant trade deals pending in
 Western Europe ard Castro pre-
 dicted, probably quite accurately,
 that the countries involved would
 turn a deaf ear to US requests
 that they refuse Cuba long-term
 redit.
 Although he admitted that
 the government is gradually buy-
 ing out those peasants who still
 have small landhcldings, a measure
 what has provoked grumbling,
 Castro maintained that "never in
 .he history of our land have we
 had greater unity."   Alluding to
 the "close contact" between the
 masses and the leaders, Castro
 suggested that he would be less
 and less in the limelight and
 that other high-ranking regime
 officials--Raul Castro, President
 Dorticos, Armando Hart, Ramiro
 Valdez, Juan Almeida, and other
 central committee members--
 should assume a greater share
 in the direction of the party.
 There is no reason to believe,
 however,  that Castro seriously
 intends to reduce his own role
 in running the country.   It is
 more likely that he was offering
 a verbal hedge against possible
 accusations that he is perpetu-
 ating the "cult of the personal-
 ity" in Cuba.
 A heavy rain that caused
 the cancellation of a scheduled
 fly-past by Cuban jet fighters
 probably was also responsible
 for the brief amount of time that
 Castro devoted to revolutionary
 movements abroad and the situa-
 tion in Vietnam, two of his fa-
 vorite subjects.   Toward the end
 of the address, which lasted two
 hours and 45 minutes, he reiter-
 ated Cuban solidarity with rebel
 groups fighting in Venezuela,
 Colombia, and Guatemala and dra-
 matically sent greetings to "'Che'
 Guevara and his comrades, wher-
 ever in the world they may be."
 He concluded by continuing his
 practice of attaching a slogan to
 the new year naming 1967 the "year

 DEMONSTRATIONS PLANNED IN PANAMA
 Panamanian student,  labor
 and civic groups plan a "march
 of sovereignty" in Panama City
 on 9 January to commemorate the
 third anniversary of the anti-US
 riots in 1964 and to denounce
 the alleged lack of progress in
 the canal negotiations.
 Ultranationalists and lead-
 ers of Panama's badly splintered
 Communist movement have called
 for "massive" demonstrations
 over the four-day period.   Pre-
 vious anniversaries have been
 relatively quiet, but emotional
 demonstrations may attract more
 popular participation this year
 because of increased interest
 in the canal negotiations and
 the government's handling of the
 1 December Rio Hato incident.
 This incident, which in-
 volved the alleged detention of
 a Panamanian commercial aircraft
 at a US-leased training area,
 touched off charges in the press
 and on the floor of the National
 Assembly that Panama's sovereignty
 had been violated.   The furor
 over the incident was quickly
 magnified into criticism of the
 US role in the treaty talks. The
 Robles government belatedly tried
 to restrict the anti-US campaign
 and set the record straight but
 its efforts were too late to
 erase the initial image of a US
 affront to Panamanian sovereignty.
 Extremist-led student groups
 staged "sovereignty" marches into
 the Canal Zone and the Rio Hato
 base in mid-December.   To dis-
 courage such incursions into the
 zone during the forthcoming an-
 niversary, government-influenced
 information media in Panama City
 recently have stressed the "de-
 sirable pace" of the canal talks
 and urged the public to avoid
 "excesses" that might retard
 them.
 President Robles, in an ef-
 fort to undercut extremist plans,
 issued an executive decree on 4
 January calling for official
 memorial observances next Monday
 to honor the "martyrs" killed
 in the 1964 riots.
 Although there is always a
 danger of an unexpected outbreak
 of violence,  it is probable that
 the anniversary will pass with
 no incidents beyond the capacity
 of the national guard to contain.

 IRGENTINE PRESIDENT REORGANIZES CABINET
 Argentine P.esident Ongania
 has reorganized :iis cabinet,
 ousting two members who had been
 strongly and consistently criti-
 cized by the nation's military
 leaders.
 Ongania too-, this step on
 his own initiative, hoping to avoid
 any impression tzat he was act-
 ing under milita=-y pressure.   He
 subsequently reaffirmed,  in a
 year-end speech, his determin,a-tion
 to keep the army out 6f politics.
 Ongania asked for the resiq--
 nation of all four cabinet min-
 isters and their subordinate
 secretaries following several
 weeks of controversy within the
 government over  labor policy and
 growing dissatis=action with the
 indecisiveness o= Economics Min-
 ister Jorge Salirnei   and the pro--
 Franco statement:3 of Interior
 Minister Martine: Paz.   These are
 the two who were dropped.  Foreign
 Minister Costa Mendez and Social
 Welfare Minister Petracca have
 been reappointed and Transport
 Secretary Antonio Lanusse, who
 Led a strong facu.ion opposed to
 conciliation with labor, was ap-
 pointed to the p=-eviously vacant
 post of minister of defense.
 The reorganization should
 help dispel idea,; that Ongania
 was beginning to favor a fascist-
 style government and should also
 give the regime a more dynamic
 image.
 Ongania's new choices for
 the economics and interior posts
 in the cabinet are well qualified.
 The new economics minister,
 Adalbert Krieger Vasena,  is a
 highly respected economist and a
 former minister of finance.   The
 new interior minister, Guillermo
 Borda,  served as a federal judge
 during the Peron era and had been
 appointed to the Supreme Court
 by Ongania soon after the coup
 last June which brought him to
 power.   However, Ongania's selec-
 tion of Lanusse as defense minis-
 ter may help perpetuate disagree-
 ment within the government on
 some issues.
 The new cabinet will probably
 act rapidly to resolve the labor
 policy question and also to firm
 up the 1967 budget, which should
 have been ready for announcement
 before the end of 1966.   It ap-
 pears that the generals are not
 opposed to the new appointments
 but are still impatient for the
 government to implement some of
 the policies promised by Ongania
 in his public s eeches.

 TENSIONS RISE AMONG RURAL LABORERS IN BRAZIL'S NORTHEAST
 Sugar-cane workers in Cabo
 in Brazil's northeastern state
 of Pernambuco have been on strike
 since mid-December trying to
 force employers to pay the legal
 minimum wage and back wages.   The
 strike may well spread to other
 sugar producing parts of this
 region, where widespread poverty
 and appalling social conditions
 provide a fertile breeding ground
 for discontent.
 This strike is one of the
 first among rural workers since
 the change of government in 1964
 neutralized Francisco Juliao,
 his peasant leagues,  and other
 left-leaning groups trying to
 exploit the misery of northeast-
 ern workers.                     Conditions have
 deteriorated for the sugar-cane
 cutters under the Castello Branco
 regime.   Landowners have moved to
 reassert their complete control,
 at times by the traditional method
 of hiring gunmen to intimidate
 recalcitrant workers.   Attempts
 to demand fair wages have been
 stifled,  and union leaders have
 been advised that military and
 police authorities would regard
 strikes as "subversive agita-
 tion.,,
 The Cabo union is supported
 by--although not affiliated with--
 the large Pernambuco Federation
 of Rural Workers, whose leaders
 claim that nearly 99 percent of
 the state's rural workers do not
 receive the minimum wage.   Father
 Paulo Crespo,  an aggressive and
 influential priest - labor or-
 ganizer, has attacked the gov-
 ernment for failing to alleviate
 the rural labor crisis.   He has
 denounced employers,  saying that
 conditions now are worse than in
 the time of slavery.   He warned
 that the government and employ-
 ers are running the risk of cre-
 ating desperate,  starving mul-
 titudes--hunger is an increasing
 problem--and predicted that
 strife would result.
 to prevent labor unrest from
 spreading throughout the north-
 A few employers apparently
 are hiring scab labor to try to
 break the strike,  and the govern-
 ment has promised to use the po-
 lice to prevent this practice.
 Some owners, on the other hand,
 may secretly be attempting to
 spread the strike in order to
 convince the government that they
 need higher sugar prices before
 they can pay minimum wages or meet
 expenses.   Some undoubtedly hope
 that the government will be
 forced to raise prices in order
