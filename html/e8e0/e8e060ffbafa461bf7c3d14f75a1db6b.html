COLUMBIA TODAY 
June 1976 
Columbia Law Symposium 
addresses the question: 
Can our freedom survive 
defense by 
the CIA and Fr31? 
"If. publicity has become a 
necessary part of the cure, the disease 
must be pretty deep .and serious." said 
Telford Taylor Columbia's Nash Pro-
fessor of Law. 
"It is deep," commented Columbia 
Professor of Government Roger ? Hits-
man, who was an assistant secretary of 
. state during the Kennedy Administra-
tion, "and the cost to us has been 
enormous. Absolutely enormous. Not 
in money terms but in wasting one of 
the -great assets we once had: the re-
spect for our integrity and goals and 
methods." ? ? 
"We have adopted the worst tactics 
of ?the Russians," agreed Frederick 
. A.O. Schwarz. Jr., who is the chief 
counsel for the Senate Select Commit-
tee to Study Governmental Operations 
With Respect to Intelligence Activities. 
"Our government, in the belief that it 
was defending freedom, used the tac-
tics of totalitarianism: unfair tactics, 
vicious tactics, tactics that are wholly 
outside the best traditions of the 
United States." . ? ? 
"The excuse for such operations has 
been that our national security re-
quired ? these acts," said - Paul C. 
Warnke, '48L, who was Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for International Af-
fairs under President Johnson. "I 
? would suggest that this is a flimsy ex-
cuse. It suggests a degree of danger to 
our national security that does not ex-
ist." 
The CIA and the FBI: Is the uproar 
over their tactics justified? How has 
the scandal affected the ? United 
States? What should we do to prevent 
future scandals? ? ? 
These were some ?of the ?issues con-
sidered by the men quoted. above as 
they participated in a panel discussion 
held this spring as part of Columbia 
Law ? Symposium. an annual event 
? . sponsored ?by The . Columbia Law 
School Alumni Association. Professor 
Taylor, who moderated the discussion, 
introduced the other speakers, noting 
"their broad range of .experience in 
the intelligence world." 
Hilsman offers some praise. 
"This is a- world of sovereign nation 
states," Professor Hilsman pointed. 
out. "We don't have a world 'govern-
Ment. Until we .do. each -nation must 
look to itself for its own security, and 
intelligence is part of that: ? 
- "And as intelligence, agencies got' 
the CIA isn't a bad one. It has central-
ized. our foreign intelligence gather-
ing. It has done some simply marvel-
ous jobs in technical fields?satellite 
photography ? and the U-2, for. exam-
ple. ? 
"I remember Chester Bowles once 
saying: 'Thank God for the U-2.. It 
showed us the Russians weren't as 
strong as we had suspected they might 
be.' If it hadn't been for the p-2, our 
defense budget in the Cold War would 
have probably been twice what it actu-
ally was. 
"But the CIA's most important con-
tribution has been the perfectly legiti-
? mate, perfectly overt, analysis of thou-
sands and 'thousands of periodical 
publications. This has been very well 
done. 
"Ali the armed services start their 
planning with the National Intelli-
gence Estimates, prepared under CIA 
chairmanship. Consider what .the last 
20 years would have been like if, in ad-
dition to the interservice rivalry we 
have had, each of the services would 
have started with its own intelligence 
estimates. Consider what it would 
have been like if Air Force planning 
had been based on intelligence docu-
ments dictated by Curtis UM ayl-
Warnke agrees: "Good . intelli-
gence serves a number of very effective 
purposes. Certainly the .national Intel-
ligence estimates have preVeoted gross 
miscalculations or. the part of our de-
fense planners. 
? "And if we did not have this, tre-
mendous late:hie:nee capability: we 
would tint have faith in the enforce-
ability of dis:irmantent 
"Even intelligence on the part of (lie 
other sick c:t11 be basically good for us. 
During the-Six .Day War in 1967. the 
Soviets were collecting, data that ena-
bled them to recognize the falsity of 
Kino, repurts that the Unit-
ed States was participatidg in the ale 
-attack," 
A case for Covert action? -As tond 
as it is a World of stow:reign mt.-
tions, there is a theoretical case for co-
-yen political action." said Professor 
Hilsmann ' 
"For example. if von believe that 
World War II could have been. avoid-
ed by the assassination of Hitler. then 
You have to admit that assassination is 
theoretically acceptable. I do not hap-
pen to believe that the removal of one 
man would do it. 
"If you believe that it would have 
been possible to remove the Nazi Party . 
in the mid-30s by encouraging zt coup ? 
by the German General Staff, then co-
vert political action Must also be theo-
retically acceptable. I have grave 
doubts that even that would have been 
possible, though I concede the theo-
retical point. 
-My own knowledge of covert polit-
ical action is that it is of marginal' 
value?that it has never worked ex-
cept when the event probably would 
have happened anyway. ? 
-For example, Allen Dulles used to 
take great credit for the removal of 
Mossadcgh and the establishment of 
the Shah of Iran. My guess is that the 
change would have occurred even if 
the CIA had never existed. 
-The covert actions in Chile were 
also marginal...and petty. What did 
the CIA do? They subsidized a news-
paper. Does anyone really believe that 
one little newspaper caused the events 
in Chile? I don't. They subsidized the 
truckers strike. Did that make the dif-
ference between a strike and ? no 
strike? I don't believe so. Everything I 
know about covert political action 
comes to that. The CIA takes credit 
for something- that; by and large. I 
think would have happened anyway." 
without CIA intervention." ?. 
Undeserved blame. Mr. Warnke 
pointed out. ? that "covert activities 
have sometimes ?led to our bent'!, 
; blamed for things we have not done.- . 
"For example," he elaborated. 
"some Soviet officials now try to de-
feed the 1968 Soviet invasion of 
Czechoslovakia on the grounds that 
they were entitled to counter Amen-
can subversion there?the same sort 
of subversion that we later carried cat 
in Chile. It is an excuse that in my 
Opinion is without basis. 
"But in the court of wotld opinion. 
we are i n. a sort of pot and kettle situa-
? tion. Covert activities have weakened 
our ability to influence world affairs, 
and have seriously eroded the credibil-
ity and good will that the United 
States has been able to assemble over 
the years."

VC:ITS. the FBI succeeded in coovine-
ing the American public that it was 
pure...that it was doing the right 
thing. 
"And in the area of pursuing crimi-
nals. the Bureau has done, generally ? 
speaking. a good job. It is when it has 
crossed the line from surveillaoce oh. 
criminals to. surveillance of dissent-
ers?and to -its. subsequent actions 
against dissenters?that it has gone 
beyond what this country can tolerate 
under its Constitution. 
The Bureau has spent far too 
much money on dissent as opposed to 
its appropriate activities against 
crime. Even today. after certain cut-
backs, it spends more than twice as 
much money on informers in the polit-
ical community as it spends on in-
formers in organized crime. This is a 
misallocation of resources. And under 
the.Constitution it shouldn't be doing 
this at all. 
"In the early 1970s. the f3ureati cov-
ered all black student groups in col-
leges across the United States. Every" 
single person who belonged to such a 
group was under surveillance aid had 
a tile created on him or her, regardless 
of whether or not that person?or that 
group?had participated in violent ac-
tivities. 
'The main violations of America's 
standards have occurred as part of the 
FBI's action programs, where they 
seek, as they put it, to 'neutralize,dis-
credit, and disrupt' political groups: ? 
-The targets of such activities have 
tanned from the famous, such as Mar-
tin Luther King. to the.obscure. The 
King case is well known. Equally sad 
for our country have been the many, 
many people who were ordinary pro-
testors?or who just associated with 
dissenters. 
-One case that, particularly sticks in 
my mind involved 'a 30-year-old worn-
an in Illinois whose husband was ac-
tive in the civil rights movement. The 
Bureau decided to write a fake letter 
to her, complaining about the hus-
band's sexual relations with peeple in 
the mowement_ Totally false. And 
then you see in the tiles of a federal 
government agency the notation: 'We 
have had the great effect of breaking 
UI) the people's marriage.' 
-Many, many Americans were at-
tacked in this way?secretly and false-
ly." 
Sharing the blame. The panelists 
indicated that responsibility for the il-
legalities committed by their agents 
does not rest solely with the CIA and 
FBI. 
"The principal culprits have been
the policymakers," said Prof essor 
Hilsman. n1 want to, kedge this by say--
;lig that Wynn give a very ubk group of 
people a lot of money. a secrecy 
and a very narrow responsibility. they 
4 
.are going to come up with ideas. And 
they are going to advocate and press 
for their projects. 
Ken nedy. for example, found him-
self under enormous pressure from 
Dulles and others to proceed .with the 
Cuban invasion. That does not excuse 
him. Ile could have avoided it. 
7.'So I am. not saying that ,the CIA 
doesift press Presidents. .Generally. 
. speaking. however, it is the other Way, 
around. It has been the policymakers 
who have demanded- that the Agency 
.clo something that it was either reluc-
tant t?. do or not very enthusiastic 
about doing?or maybe enthusiastic 
about doing but not legally allowed to 
do. The people responsible for the 
Chile business. were ?Richard Nixon 
and Henry Kissinger. It wasn't the 
Agency. Richard Nixon said. 'do 
something about this situation: And 
they d id." 
.1?,1r. Schwarz mentioned- that Con-
gress also -played a- very negative 
role" in the intelligence picture. 
"Congress knew what the FBI was 
doing to Martin Luther King?and . 
did nothing about it," Mr. Schwarz 
declared. -Congress also axissed the 
Smith Act_ which has led to the Bu-
reau 's justification of most 'surveil-
lance activities. 
Congressional oversight. One 
remedy considered by the panelists is 
the _creation of a Congressional over-
sight committee to monitor the activi-
ties of .U.S. intelligence agencies. (The 
Senate Select Committee on Intelli-
czence recommended the creation. of 
?such a committee in its report issued 
in late April.) 
"We need to return to the system of 
checks and balances planned by the 
Founding Fathers.". said Mr. 
Schwarz. "When people can operate 
in secrecy, when they are subjected to. 
the kinds of pressures that agents have 
been subjected to.. and when they be-
lieve action is required, they will tend 
to operate against liberty: it's too easy. 
It's too hard to remember the re-
straints that are placed on power. 
"We let the idea of secrecy. and the 
increasing power of the Executive. in-
sulate from Congress and the Ameri-
can public?and the courts?the na-
ture of the programs conducted in 
their name." 
Professor Hilsman was skeptical: 
"Congressional committees, like regu-
latory agencies, get captured by the 
people they are supposed to oversee. 
I'm afraid that such a committee 
would become a powerful advocate 
and defender--and protector?of the 
agency." 
Mr. Warae also felt that "Con-
gressional oversight committees would 
not be a really effective answer.' 
"I'm also very skeptical of sugges-
tions such as advanced clearance of 
proposed covert action by a Congres-
sional committee," he continued. "To 
the extent that a Congressional com-
mittee shares the responsibility, it 
tends to take on the face of the rcgu-
1. agency. - ? 
"Also, past experience with pre-
clearance has not really-been a happy 
one. Pre-clearance of covert activities 
smacks too much to me of a yonkin 
Gulf resolution, in which. the 'Execu-
tive comes to ,the Congress, secures ,a 
blank check, and then cashes it for a 
far greater amount ? than the Congress 
contemplated at the time the ? Execu-
tive presented it." 
Banning covert activities. Some 
people who have !testified before Con-
gressional groups investigating CIA 
and FBI misdeeds have advotated" 
that covert activities be banned entire-
ly. Others Maintain that such activi-
tiesi are justified n cCrtain cases. Mc-
, George Bundy. for example. has sug-
gested that covert activities would be 
acceptable to counter international 
terrorism or nuclear threats. 
-I think I would preserve some sort 
of a covert action capability." said Mr. 
Warnke, "but I would do it on an ad 
'hoc basis. I think there should be a 
presumption against it?a strong pre-
sumption. Only the most compelling 
of considerations ought to lead to the 
? permission of:covert activities. 
"But there is no justification, under 
any circumstances, for covert police or 
covert programs. Even is there is some 
justification for everyone not knowing 
how the government is trying to do 
something, everyone should know 
what his government is trying to do. 
Policies ought to be overt. 
"This was demonstrated in connec-
-tion with the Angolan debate. where 
.at one point it was contemplated that 
we provide overt aid. And Secretary of 
State Kissinger, in a press conference, 
said no, we couldn't give overt aid be-
cause that would bring about .a num-
ber of political and diplomatic prob-
lems. 
"If we can't justify a program as 
part of an overt policy, there is no jus-
tification for doing it covertly..' 
Professor Hilsman suggested `legis-
lation that flatly says 'no covert ac-
? lions of any kind can be taken by the 
FBI and CIA.' 
"I would also contemplate a 'law 
? limiting the terni of the director of the 
so the-person couldn't build up ? 
power?as J. Edgar Hoover did." 
Warnke considers Ford's pro-
posals. In February of this year. Ger-
ald Ford announced new guidelines 
for 'U.S. intelligence agencies. His Ex-
ecutive order bans the use of assassi-
nation and sets some limits?consid-
ered ambigtious by critics of the

telligence activities. under the direc-
tion of the National Security Couneil. 
President Ford's plan also estab-
? lishes an Operations .Advisory Group, 
composed of .top Administration offi-
cials, that will review and vote on all 
proposed coven operations. 
? Mr. Warnke is "not at all sanguine 
about the effectiveness of the Execu-
tive order. First of all, a problem de-
velops When you try to legislate against 
. just certain things. The things that are 
? not legislated against acquire a degree 
? of sanction that perhaps they did not 
have before. ? 
"This is the problem that exists as a 
result of the War Powers Resolution 
? passed in late 1973. That legislation 
'gave the President, for the first time, 
the explicit ability to conduct a war for 
? a limited period of time, subject to 
Congressional veto. Prior to passage of 
the resolution, I think a good argu- ? 
ment could have been made that the 
? President had no such power at all: 
So, while purporting to restrict Execu-
tive power, it in fact expanded the Ex-
ecutive's action capability. 
? "I think there should continue to be 
an executive interdepartmental com-
mittee to review intelligence agency 
? .proposals and make recommenda-
tions to the President. This sort of 
.committee can work?but not if the 
National Security Adviser is also the 
Secretary of State. 
"I also think there should be an 
overall intelligence czar?one who 
would not have direct operational re-
sponsibilities in any one of the agen-
cies. Theoretically, that has been the 
role of the director of Central Intelli-
gence, but because he has an individu-
al agency affiliation, be has sometimes 
been in the position of a competitor 
rather than an overseer." 
Legislating against leaks. Mr. 
Warnke also had some comments 
about the threat to intelligence opera-
tions of leaks: 
"I don't think the disclosures are

of our intelligence-gathering apparit-
tus. 
?It doesn't seem to me that the kind

"Some recent leaks of material .

unreliability of Congress. 
"Leaks are often designed to effect

General Westmoreland had requested 
an additional 206,000 troops be sent 
to Vietnam. There were those who felt 
that the President would not be able to 
turn down the request once it was 
made public. Others obviously leaked 
it because they hoped public furor 
would prevent the request from being 
granted." 
Law is the key. "The purpose of all

Schwarz, "is not simply to protect

Foe Claims Intelligence Officers Are Used Mainly to Recruit Others 
BY WILLIAM TROMBLEY 
Times Staff Writer 
SANTA BARBARA?A leading 
critic of the U.S. Central Intelligente 
Agency said Friday that the CIA 'has 
"one or two or perhaps several secret 
agents" on eath of more than 100 
American campuses. 
? Morton H. Halperin, a former 
member of the National Security 
Council, said his information was 
based on descriptions he has received 
of secret portions of the recent report 
of the Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence Activities, chaired by ? 
Sen. Frank Church (D-Ida.). 
Halperin told the American Assn. 
of University Professors, meeting at 
UC Santa Barbara, that the CIA 
agents are administrators, faculty 
members and teaching graduate stu-
dents who "basically are recruiters." 
"They try to spet students or facul-
ty members who might be useful" to 
the CIA by gathering 'information at 
international academic conferences 
and the like, according to Halperin. 
They also "look for other recruit-
ers," he said, "either. Americans or 
foreigners, people who will go back 
to their countries and be spies for the 
CIA." 
Halperin named no institutions .but 
said, "I assume it's concentrated in ? 
universities where there are a large 
number of. foreigners" as students or 
visiting faculty members. 
Campus agents generally are 
known only to the CIA and to them-
selves but occasionally their identi-

LONDON (AP) ? The 
editor of an American 
magazine that has named 
dozens of alleged CIA 
agents around the world 
was barred from Britain 
last night, the Home Office 
reported. 
A spokesman said Home 
Secretary Roy Jenkins 
ordered the ban on Perry 
Douglas Fellwock of 
Counter-Spy magazine be-
cause his presence in Brit-
ain would "not be condu-
cive to the public good." 
Fellwock writes under the 
name Winslow Pecin 
The Home Office said 
Fellwock arrived from 
West Berlin last night at 
London's Heathrow Airport, 
and immigration officials 
sent him back. The editor 
was reported on at spenaing 
tour. 
, 
ties are known ? to one or more col-
lege officals, Halperin said. 
Some ? are paid and others ? work 
"out of patriotism," he stated. ? 
; *Once a recruiter spots a potential 
CIA agent he send the -name to the 
agency, which conducts a security 
check, according to Halperin. 
Halperin also stated, as did the 
Church committee, that some scho-
larly research has been secretly 
funded by the CIA. ? 
The Church committee's report, re-
leased in late April, said generally 
that hundreds of professors, adminis-
trators and graduate students, as 
well as officials of private founda-
tions, have had 6Iandestine ties with 
the CIA, the FBI and other U.S. 'in-
telligence gathering agencies. 
However, specific descriptions of 
-these ties were-deleted from the final 
report at the request of the CIA. 
Halperin said his speech Friday 
was the first detailing of just how the 
CIA works on campuses. 
He said his information came from 
"the secret version of the Church re-
,port" but said he had not eeen the de-
leted material himself and would not 
say where he got the information. ? 
"I am confident that what I am 
:saying is true but I cannot tell you 
'where I got it," Halperin told repor-
ters after the meeting. 
, Halperin has devoted considerable 
time and energy in recent months to 
attacking the CIA for its undercover 
'ties to journalists, academics and oth-
ers in American life. 
He has filed suit against' Secretary 
d 
'of State Henry A. Kissinger and for-
Iner government officials because, he 
? contends, his telephone was tapped 
? for a 21-month period from 1969 to 
1.971.? ? ? . 
CIA ties with academic figures 
were defended at Friday's meeting 
by Cordon D. Baldwin; profes.sor of 
constitutional law at the University 
of Wisconsin and former counselor 
on international law for the State De-
partment. 
Baldwin argued that "foreign intel-
ligence gathering is vital to clua corn-
mon good" and said that "in a majori-
ty of cases. . . there was no wrong." 
He said if the CIA had received 
More academic input d'we might all 
have profited." 
He suggested that there is little dif-, 
ference between a Jaw firm asking a 
faculty member to recommend a new 
employe and the CIA asking special 
campus agents to identify possible re-
, cruits. ? 
? Halperin 'replied that scholars 
should have the right to publish un-. 
der CIA auspices if they wish but 
should acknowledge the source of 
their support. 
? He also said CIA agents on campus 
should identify themselves so their 
students arid colleagues would know 
.with whom they are dealing. 
And he proposed that names of 
possible recruits should not be sub-
mitted to the CIA without permission 
of the individuals and that security 
checks should not be carried out 
without their approval.

REGISTER, Des Moines 
12 June 1976 
?? -BySILBERT CRAN BERG V V V---. ? 
Central Intelligence Agency Director George Bush refused 
to answer when he was asked, during his appearance as 
American Society of Newspaper Editors luncheon speaker 
Apr. a, whether the CIA maintains "relationships" wittrjour-
nalists working for foreign news media. Bush said a response 
would reveal intelligence "sources and methods." 
The question Bush ducked was answeredr two weeks later ? 
? by the Senate Intelligence Committee. The committee 
reported that the CIA maintains ties to a number of persons 
? associated with-thSrin'al organizations and "a network of 
several hundred foreign individuals around the world who 
provide intelligence for the CIA and at times attempt to 
influence foreign opinion through the use of covert propa-
ganda. These individuals provide the CIA with direct access 
to a large number of foreign newspapers and periodicals, 
scores of press services and news agencies, radio and televi-
sion stations, commercial book publishers, and other foreign 
media outlets." ? ? 
The statement is italicized in the committee's report. A 
footnote explains that italicized material "has been substan-
.tially abridged at the request of the executive agencies." 
Even cropped and touched up, the picture of the CIA that 
emerges is of an agency ready, willing and able to employ a 
large-scale covert propaganda apparatus to pollute the news 
media.. _ . - 
. ? v . v 
And not only the foreign media. A former CIA official told 
the Senate committee: 'There is no way in this increasingly 
small world of ours of- insulating information that one puts 
out overseas and confining it to the area to where one puts it 
out.... If you plant an article in some paper overseas ... 
there is no way of guaranteeing that it is not going to be, 
picked up and published by the Associated Press in this coun-
try." - 
The CIA's propaganda activities include the use of "black 
propaganda" ? propaganda- that appears to originate from 
an unfriendly source. Because U.S. policy makers could be 
misled by these phony stories, "senior U.S. officials" are 
informed of their true source. But as the Senate Committee 
noted, "no mechanism exists to protect the U.S. public and 
the Congress from fallout from black propaganda or Any 
other propaganda." : 
?s??Russian and other foreign intelligence agencies employ 
, similar covert propaganda- tactics. Does -the KGB have 
American newsmen on its payroll planting stories in the U.S. 
i news media? Conceivably it does, though a Senate commit-
?, tee staff member who is familiar with the Clads covert prop-
aganda operation said he doubted that the Russians are 
planting stories in this country directly through U.S. news-
men, because the number and variety of U.S. media outlets 
would make it difficult to have an impact...He added that the 
Russians unquestionably have an extensive covert propagan-
da apparatus abroad. 
An appendix to the Senate committee report, which appar-? . 
eat's' was contributed by the CIA, describes a KGB depart-
? ment that specializes in "covert action and deception,? 
? including the use of "disinformation.".. ? - . . -

Wiretap bill 
astir in 
COngre 
Passage likely unless 
election intrudes 
By Robert P. Hey 
Staff correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor ? 
Washington 
If, election-year politics do not intrude, Con-
gress appears poised to approve this session a 
?proposal' that would prohibit_ government's. 
spying ituliscriminantly on Americans by wiree? 
tapping or other electronic meanso 2 
But that is a big'"ift" several congressional 
sources say, noting that historically Congress 
becomes preoccupied with politica by early 
smninerin a presidential year. 
? Nonetheless, Sen. Charles McC. Mathias Jr.: 
? (R) of Md., one of the proposal's prime spon-
sors, tells this newspaper hes rates. as ?"very 
good" its chances of becoming law this year. 
Re notes that President Ford ?who with At. 
NEW YORK TIMES 
2 JUL 1975 
tomey General Edward Levi proposed the bill 
? has indicated he will sign it. And he notes 
members' of Congress are now strongly self-
motivated to approve it. 
There now is "proof," he says, that under 
recent administrations members of Congress 
themselves were wiretapped without court ap-
proval. "What more do you need?" 
Had the current proposal been law, it would 
have made illegal or prevented entirely many 
of the questionable wiretaps by federal in-
telligence agencies over the past 30 years. 
Approval required 
The hill also would have made illegal the 
bugging by government agencies of such di-
verse targets as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr., members of Congress, members of 
the National Security Council, and several 
journalists. 
The proposal would require the FBI, CIA, 
and other federal intelligence agencies to ob-
tain inter court approval before wiretapping 
persons within the U.S. for national security 
reasons. To obtain that approved, the govern--
mit would have to ossavinee judge that 
there was reasonable cause to believe the per-
son it proposed to bug was acting a's a foreign 
agent, and was engaged in "clandestine in-
telligence activities." 
.The proposal has been approved by the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee and is being probed 
in beatings this week by the Senate Select 
Burglaries, Lies . . 
? Just as the impact of the revelations Of intelligence 
abdeas had begun to fade, Americans have been provided 
with two jolting reminders that the issues are far from 
resolved. A subcommittee of the Senate Select Commit-
tee on Intelligence Activities has' reported that the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation had been 'derelict in meeting their responsibilities 
- to. the Warren Commission. Almost simultaneously, it. 
? was reported that the Department of Justice had begun' 
a majoteineestigation into burglaries 'undertaken by the 
F.B.I. since 1971, when, say Director Clarence M. Kelley and 
other officials, they thought such activities had ceased. 
Though' the lapses in the Kennedy -investigation and 
the burglaries riciw, under, investigation occurred years 
apart, they are disturbingly similar. From all appear-
ances, the C.I.A. withheld 'information from ,the Warren 
Commission because it did .not want to reveal its. 
.?dssassina.6.on program against Premier Castro, while the 
withheld information about Lee Harvey Oswald 
because it wished to avoid embarrassment. 
In the severities, the F.B.I. had a national security. ? 
mission to ferret out the Weathermen 'and other targets 
on the New Left. Contrary to. assurances given by .F.B.I. 
spokesmen to the Senate committee that 'all relevant 
evidence had been turned over, many secret files were 
not even reviewed by the bureau, presumably to protect 
the integrity of the burglary program. 
In all of these cases the intelligence bureaucracies 
proceeded on the assumption that they had some purpose 
higher than both the missions and limits imposed by 
the appropriate authorities. Yet, to keep their secrets 
from Congress, their have attempted to cloak themselves 
in the presumption of regularity and responsibility., .. 
The agencies cannot have it beth ways. The only 
way for them to operate in a free society is to be 
responsive to 'higher authorities and the tem: The fact 
that the Department ai justice is conducting a broad. 
investigatiou iotn the burglaries is a hopefel same:, but 
the effort will be in vain i only. low-level egeent are

ering it at this time, 
Compromise legislation' 
The legislation represents a compromise be-
tween broader; more stringent proposals to 
protect Americans' privacy ? which sponsors 
have failed to enact into law in recent years --
and the desires of many in government not to 
hamper the legitimate intelligence-gathering 
requirements of government. 
The bill has some opponents, including Sen. 
John V. Tiinney (D) of California, who says it 
would permit too much government snooping 
on American citizens who have broken no law. 
Nonetheless, Senators Mathias, Edward M. 
Kennedy, and others hold that it is ? as the 
,Marylander told this newspaper ? "a step for-
ward" in protecting Americans' privacy. 
But 'Senator Mathias, like others, concedes it 
is not his "ideal." He ultimately wants what he 
? has been proposing vainly for two years: a law 
that would require court orders before govern-
ment agencies use what he calls "the many 
forms of governmental surveillance ? in-
cluding mail opening; the entry of homes; the 
inspection of bank, credit, and medical 
records; as well as the use of bugs and wire-
held to account for the F.B.I.'s lawlessness while superior 
officers, ultimately responsible for the program, go free. 
. and Oversight 
However effective criminal sanctions may be, they are 
only one of the Means of curbing intelligence community 
abuses. Aggressive Congressional oversight and careful 
legislation are two. others. The Senate's capacity ad 
to utilize those tools is being tested this week as the n.?-W 
, Senate Intelligence Committee, exereisingdts concurrent 
? jurisdiction with the Judiciary Committee, marks up. 
the peoposecl Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
This measure would impose for the first time a require-
? rnent that Warrants be 'obtained from the Federal courts 
.prior :to installation of 'national security Wiretaps. Though 
its purpose is commendable; the bill as now written has. 
severe shortcomings. Among its-more 'glaring defects is. 
the fact that it permits electronic Surveillance even if 
no evidence has .been presented that a crime has been or 
is about to -he committed.: Moreover, key terms and 
phrases used in the act are so broad that they do not 
effectively limit intrusive intelligence activities. 
? "In approving the bill over the lone opposition of Sena-
tor,Tunney of California, the Judiciary Committee gave 
the intelligence community the benefit of doubts, as 
if nothing had been learned during the past half denade.. 
The revelations of F.B.I. burglaries during the course 
'of the Socialist thenkers Party lawsuit against it and 
even tiering the Intelligence Committee investigation 
should impel the new Senate 'committee to examine the 
issues more closely than did Judiciary. ?

THE CHRISTIAN CENTURY 
2 June 1976 ' 
The Intelligence 
Lies My Linde Told Me 
The subversive activities of the FBI, CIA and Department of Defense 
have seriously undermined the security of the Republic, within and without. 
JANET KARSTEN LARSON 
+ ONCE UPON A TIME there was the frank and 
'fearless liar ? but sooner or later the facts would 
out, and make an end of him. Now we have the 
'bureaucrat, mumbling and amnesiac; the master of 
plausible denials and institutionalized cover-up; the 
limited investigation and the interpretive memo; 
the document-shredders, the secrecy-stampers, the 
propaganda machinists. And it. is no longer so easy 
to find them out. It took 15 months and $3 million 
for the Senate Select Committee on intelligence to 
unearth some of the things our roasters of deceit 
were not telling us about ? and to frame legal rem-
edies for keeping our intelligence establishment 
more nearly honest and law-abiding in the future. 
Now that the Senate panel chaired by Frank 
Church has released its censored final report, we 
; can assess the findings of the most extended peek in 
our history into the baroque machinations of U.S. 
intelligence. Although the initial waves of outrage 
have subsided; our unhappy right to know has 
burdened us with large responsibilities for the fu-
ture. Without strong public pressure, the Congress 
May be unable to sustain a critical posture toward 
the executive branch with its insistent claim that 
national security requires public trust in secret 
power. The House has already retreated, turning 
around from its aggressive inquiry into the spy 
establishment to compliant, worried investigation of 
itself. Nonetheless, what this pat year's massive con-
gressional effort has taught us we cannot afford to 
forget: that more than any House leak or Senate 
revelation, the subversive activities. of the FBI, CIA 
and Department of Defense have seriously under-
mined the security of the Republic, within and 
Without. 2 
I 
"This is a report that probably should never have 
been written," declares Senator Barry Goldwater in 
dissent from the Senate panel's final report. It has 
indeed caused "severe embarrassment" to the na-
tion, as he laments, for the Senate investigation has 
- laid before the public the -elements of a terrible 
irony:. that acts which are illegal and unethical for 
citizens to engage in at home are condoned, -even 
aggressively pursued, by American law-enforcement 
officers and secret agents both at home and abroad. 
Thus while FBI's COINTELPP-0 prying violated 
the civil liberties of Americans unjustly suspected of 
subversion, the CIA was conspiring to overthrow 
governments abroad, fix their elections, and assassi-

nate their leaders. While the FBI claimed it was,. 
hunting out terrorists and preventing violent acts,. 
both CIA and FBI were inciting groups to violence, 
here and overseas. The FBI tried to smear student 
activists by linking drug use. with "Red Chinese" 
narcotics plots to "weaken" our youth; the CIA and ? 
the army, meanwhile, were secretly spending mil-
? 
lions for LSD experiments on unsuspectingpersonse ? 
several of whom died, and shredding the evidence 
afterward. Responding to threats real and imagined 
?and the report documents both kinds of dangers 
? we adopted methods "more ruthless than the 
enemy," as a major lnaos policy statement advised, 
and our adversaries became ourselves. 
No communist plot could have succeeded so well 
to undermine American values and institutions. 
Even more disturbing than the now-familiar horror 
stories about what government agents have done to 
protect America are all the report's examples of how 
little was done to protect us from them. The Senate 
Select Committee concluded that our system of 
checks and balances has failed to curb secret power. 
. Six Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard ? 
Nixon, other top-level officials,. and particularly the. 
attorneys general "virtually abdicated their constitu-
tional responsibility to oversee and set standards for 
intelligence activity." Second. Congress has exer-
cised lax oversight, bowing to the will of the execu-
tive, and framed such vague, inadequate laws that 
the intelligence .agencies have filled in almost, at 
whim the blank checks at their disposal. Although 
the Constitution requires disclosure of how public 
monies are spent. Congress has never asserted its 
right to know the extent of the financial empire 
which intelligence commands. 
Third, the judiciary has been reluctant to inter-
vene, even where laws have dearly been broken. As 
the ACLU's Christine Marwick writes, for years the 
justice Departmentslit:Omised. the CIA that 
there would be no prosecutions for CIA illegalities ? 
if- a trial would threaten to reveal classified infor-
mation. And since virtually all information about an 
orzanization created for clandestine activities is secret, 
there were no pror.ectitions for illegal programs. As 
Committt,t. observed, the CJA was not out 
of control, it was "utterly responsive to the instruc-
tions of the Preideitt.'' It simply appeared to she 
naIve outsider to be out of control because it was, 
in fact, beyond the Law ["Reforming the Intelligence 
.Agencies," Priari pies (March 1976), p. !;]. 
In the intelligence "flap" as in Watergate, it b-a5 
been the fourth Estzic ? the press ? that has 'played

and the FBI's devious efforts to co-opt .or discredit 
the media. ? 
During its investigations the Senate panel probed. 
hard to find evidence of respect for law in the daily 
operations of intelligence. Certainly, honest and 
laudable officials are mentioned in the report. But 
an overwhelming number of cases turned up habit-
ual, even institutionalized, disregard for -law.: Re-. 
pe-atedly inspectors general warned about "potential 
flap activities" --not crimes. FBI memos 'acknowl-
edged illegality bot authorized bugs and black-bag 
jobs anyway because they were "invaluable tech-
niques" "necessary" for protecting the nation. The 
head of the FBI's Intelligence Division testified that 
he never heard anyone raise legal or ethical ques-
tions: "We never .gave any thought to this line of 
reasoning, becanse we were just naturally prag-
matic." How persistently officials maneuvered to. 
elude the requirements of law is well documented 
in the report: 
9 Although COINTELPRO came to light in 
1971 ?with its disregard of First Amendment free-
doms and its massive violations of .federal and state 
statutes against mail and wire fraud, incitement to 
violence; extortion, and sending obscene material 
through the mail? the Justice Department did, not 
look into the program until 1474, and even then it. 
uncovered no crimes. Its report, only mildly alarmed, 
was based on misleading FBI-prepared "short sum-
maries" of COINTEL. incidents_ That same, year 
Justice also issued sweeping authorizations for more 
COINTEL-type FIII investigations of "subversives," 
potential civil disorders and "potential crimes." . 
0 When President Johnson's I-Ptatzenbach Commis-
sion told federal agencies to halt covert financial 
relationships with "U.S. educational and private 
voluntary organizations which operate abroad," CIA 
sent out a field circular stressing stringent secrecy to. 
? prevent more exposes. "In simple terms," the circu-
lar said, "we are now in a.different ballgame. Some 
? of the basic ground rules have changed." Among the 
CIA's clever ruses was to shift the covert "ballgame" 
from institutions to the individuals within them. If 
CIA no longer funds the National Student Associa-
tion, it uses exchange students (some hold govern-
ment grants) t6 collect intelligence overseas. Even 
today the CIA is using "several hundred American 
'academics" to provide lead, make introductions 
for intelligence purposes, and write propaganda 
"theme material." Some are used "operationally," 
and at most of the iostitutions involved, no one 
knows of the CIX link except the atfent-prolessor. 
The CIA was not the only agile partner in this 
little dance of `reform." Katzenbach testified that 
his commission was (in the report's words) "de-
signed by President Johnson . _ to head olf a full-
scale Congressional investigation." 
0 In the past :congressional oversight has all too 
often been no more sharp-eyed than Edward V. 
Long's hearings in 1966 on electronic surveillance_ 
The senator allowed FBi agents to write Ilia press 
release stating that the subcommittee had "con-
ducted exhanative research- and was now "fully 
satisfied" that .the FBI had not abused its hugging 
authority. The "exhaustive" peek was a 9o-rnintite 
briefing from the FBI Which failed to disclose the 
bureau's most serious misdeeds. Wrote one bureau 
official to the associate director afterward: "We 
have neutralized the threat of being embarrassed by 
the Long Subconimittee...." ? 
While the existing intelligence charters are rag: 
it. can hardly be argued. that the officials who se 
tematically broke the law did- not know what they 
were -doing. A /957 CIA memo called its drug 
experiments "unethical and illegal" six years before 
they , were halted. While . former CIA Director 
William Colby was publicly taking the line that the 
President has constitutional pms-er to conduct covert 
operations, Colby himself had approved an internal 
CIA .study which found that, prior to the 1974 
Foreign Assistance Act,. there were no legal or 
constitutional grounds for covert action without the 
advance approval of Congress. From .1969 on, CIA 
Director Helms sent Warnings to the White House 
:that- CHAOS ? the domestic spying scheme which 
canie perilously close to giVing us a secret "thought 
police" ? had gone beyond the CIA charter. "I need 
not emphasize how extremely sensitive this makes 
the paper," Helms wrote in a study of "Restless' 
Youth." The program ? which was mandated to find 
proof that foreign elements supported the American 
peace .Movement (any kind of support, even "en-
couragement,""casual contacts" or "mu: eal inter-
est") ? was not halted until March 1974. 
To compound the problem of, questionable. legal 
authority, only recently did Congress become fully 
aware that a "secret charter" existed for the nation's 
cloak-and-daggering ? the accumulated classified 
executive orders issued over the years. While Amer-
icans Could debate the overt reform proposals in 
President Ford's February order (see March to 
Century 'editorial, p. 211), we may never know the 
full content_of Executive Order z 1905, which mere-
, ly'hints that "in some instances detailed implemen-
tation of the Executive Order will be contained in 
classified documents." On national television Ford 
said that .he trusted the American people to elect 
honest Presidents who would not 'abuse the powers 
? of secrecy, and in his message to Congress he 
proclaimed that his plan for reform "places respon-
sibility and accountability on indiViduals, not insti-
tutions.", Long before the exposure of *the CIA 
began, Richard Helms likewise maintained that the 
country had to "take it on faith that we, .too, are 
honorable men." 
Yet the Ainerican system is one not of persons but 
of laws. And in such a system, as justice Louis 
Brandeis wrote in )928, the "existence of the 
government will be imperilled if, it fails to observe 
the law scrupulously, ... If the government becomes 
a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites 
every man to become a law unto 'himself; it in-
vines anarchy- (Olmstead ? v. 177,1ited States). In 
COINTELPRO, the Senate report found, "the bu-
reau secretly took the law into its own hands," and 
the consequence was anarchy. If. the FBI's own 
agents did not directly carry out murder plots, the 
bureau intensified the climate of violence in which 
black. leaders were slain just :as the C.I.A set the 
stage for the kidnapping and then. the shooting of 
General Ren?chneider in Chile and the bloody

. the biggest covert operation of them all. Al-
though for years the CIA has assured the media that. 
.? it was planting no informers an their news teams, 
Until February of this year CIA was. using 50 
.unnamed ',American joiirrialistS and!, media em- ?? 
ployees for covert purposes. The CIA director 
pledged in. February that the agency "will .not enter 
into any paid or contractual relationship with any 
! or part-time news ?correspondent ? ac- ? 
credited by any U.S. news service, .newspaper, period-
ical,. radio or television network or station." But the s 
new policy permits the continuing? perhaps now ? 
expanding ? use of at. least two dozen journalists who 
are free-lance, unaccredited, unpaid, or rewarded by ?: 
? CIA "briefings" in lieu of money as well as the use 
:of American news executives who have been impor-
tant "media assets" in the past. .? ? 
t On May no George Bush issued a further opinion ! 
that ? the CIA "should not- be precluded" from 
'using part-time journalists who want, to cooperate 
with the agency. The CIA continues its 'refusal to 
give out names of its media "assets" ? especially not 
to American. editors 'who want to clean house. In 
'world news media the CIA is also using "several ? 
?hundred foreign individuals around the world" who 
"provide the CIA with direct access to a large number 
.of foreign newspapers and periodicals, scores of press - 
services and news agencies, radio and, television sta-
tions, commercial book publishers, and other foreign 
media outlets" (italics in the Senate report indicate 
agency censoring). In the past the CIA has main-
tained two "proprietary news services" in Europe, 
one of which served 'Ito U.S. newspapers, as well as 
regularly planting stories in the foreign press and 
frequently using Reuters, the well-respected: news 
service which is considered fair .game because it is ? 
British-based. 
Because propaganda is . aimed first at the ? 
intangible ? the shaping of perceptions ? its effects ? ? 
are hard to measure, especially when it comes from ? 
invisible sources. . "The most important weapon of - 
Strategic propaganda'', is the book, as one former. 
Clandestine Service officer testified. CIA has been in 
the book business for several ?decades: before 1967 . 
,it "sponsored,- subsidized or produced over ?n000 
? 
books," many of which were put out by CIA-backed. 
e- cultural organizations whose subsidy was "more - 
-: often than not" unknown to the writer. The Criss-
'commissioned Penhovskiy Papers ? (Doubleday, 
1965) was a commercial success; the publisher never, 
knew of the CIA link.. When Penkovskiy was serial- ? 
ized in: the ! Washington Post .and go other U.S.: 
newspapers, the Russians denounced the hook as the . 
"coarse fraud" it was, ? and, notes former Moscow ? . 
correspondent. Stephen S. Rosenfeld, they retaliated 
by closing the Post's' Moscow bureau for two years. 
In :967 ? a year of 200 CIA ? books, among them. 
translations of MachiavelIi's The Prince into Swahili 
and T. S. Eliot's works into Russian ?the CIA : 
pledged it would no longer "publish boOks, -maga-
zines and newspapers. in the United States," That 
Same year, however, . art agency order announced 
that "fallout in the United States; from a foreign 
,publication which- we support ?inevitable: and 
,consequently permissible." The CIA's leap in tailor-
? atiogic was elucidated by testimony from E. Froward 
Hunt, in charge of the CIA's U.S. publisher con-
tacts in the late iofios, who said that .domestic fallout. 
"may . not" (in the -report's words) "hasie been 
unintentional." 
The Senate report quotes a September -1 970 cablie 
summary during CIA's propaganda program in 
Chile to suggest that the agency regularly expected 
"fallout": ? 
Sao Paulo, Tegucigalpa, Buenos Aires, Lima, 
Montevideo, Bogota, Mexico City report continued 
replay of Chile theine materials.. Items also carried in 
New York, Times, Washington Post. Propagarida ac-
tivities. continue to generate good coverage of Chile 
developments al'ong our theme guidance.. 
Domestic fallout is "permissible" not only. because it 
iS inevitable but also because* it is 'desirable?
especially where the selective release. of "facts" or 
the currency of agency-favored ideas serves an ideo-
logical line or stratagem. To some it May seem accept-
able, if distasteful, for propagandists :hired by our 
!government to tell lies in order to protect American 
democracy. Yet the implication is that our govern-
ment and way of life have a monopoly on truth ? an 
attitude characteristic of totalitarian state's, not one 
embodied in traditional American values. If Senate-
approved treaties affirm our respect for the Sovereign-
ty of other nations, we cannot permit our govern-
ment's undercover agents to mount attacks ? military 
or -verbal ? that threaten the right to self4leterminaT 
tion, no matter how misguided we may judge other 
nations to be. . 
Like most other questionable Secret designs recent-
ly made public, propaganda is justified as counter-
weight to-enemy propagandizing. Yet as the Senate 
:report simply pins it: "The strongest defense a free 
'country has from propaganda of any kind, is a free and 
!vigorous press that expresses diverse points of view" 
;? withotit its 'credibility being jNapardized by our 
own covert propagandists: There are a number of 
;Stories in the Senate report which dbcument an inge-
nious system :by -which propaganda is made to look 
like the real thing: CIA's dOmestic "plants" can legit-

the CIA would not otherwise be able to command. 
When the Church panel found that the FBI too 
had been using "friendly" reporters at least througn

the 'head of the Crime Records .Division, who dis-
seminated to the bureau's "press friends" informa-
tion to discredit. the FBI's critics and targets and to 
disrupt their activities. The. most massive FBI prop-
aganda effort is now vcll known: the?. vicious 
campaign to take Martin Luther King "off his 
. pedestal". by . planting derogatory articles in the 
media, peddling secret tapes to journalists (such as 
Ben Bradlee when he was Newsweek's Washington 
bureau chief), and sending threat letters .to King 
? and his wife, Coretta. The bureau's specialty in 
covert propaganda has been forged poison-pen let-
ters, such as those sent to sow fear and hate among 
rival black groups so that their members might be 
provoked ? and some were? to kill each other off_ 
Hoover's propagandists aimed also at influencing 
foreign policy during the Vietnam years ?leading 
policy-makers to believe that antiwar sentiment as 
communist-inspired and thus did not need.to be tak-
en seriously. ?Hoover asked for and got reports that: 
judged communist -influence in the civil rights 
movement "vitally important" even though his. bu-
reau had found it an "obvious failure." Neverthe-
less, the National Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People was hounded for 25 years, despite 
an early report noting the NAACP's "strong tenden-
cy" to "steer clear of communist activities." (In all, 
the FBI conducted more than a half-million investi-
gations of alleged "subversives," yet was not able to 
prosecute a single individual or grout') for. planning 
or advocating overthrow of the g.overnment.) 
The most recent instance of an overt propagama 
campaign has been the CIA's public-relations.effott 
- to discredit its critics in the congressional inquiries. 
In December when CIA's Athens station. chief, Rich-
ard Welch, was ambushed outside his home- and 
killed ? after his name, .along with those of other 
agents, had. appeared in the offbeat -magazine Conn-
per-Spy ? the CIA at last unleashed its secret weapon: 
the public hero.' 
According to Daniel Schorr's Journal of those clays 
'("My 17 Months on the Cl: Watch," Rolling Stone 
, [April 8], p. (F), the plane carrying Welch's body 
was tinted to touch down at Andrews Air Force Base 
' for live. TV coverage on the morning news shows; 
the funeral and civilian Welch's special burial in 
Arlington National Cemetery ? with 'full military 
honors and the same caisson that carried the body of 
President Kennedy ? was elaborately orchestrated 
to impress upon Congress and the press the dire 
consequences of their reckless probes and leaks. 
Blaming Welch's death on the press was grossly tin-
' fair; and there are several good reasons to believe 
? that Welch's "cover" may already have worn dan-
gerously thin before his name was published. Fot 
one, his residence had been the home of the former 
Athens CIA chief; for another, counterspies could 
find good clues of our agents' identities in the State 
Department's own Foreign Service Liv (which ceased 
publication in March) and its Biographic :Register 
(now published only on a restricted hasis in order to 
protect State's employees abroad, according to the 
department's policy statement ? which- mentioned 
Welch's death). 
When Daniel !,;charr of. CBS ,leaked die secret 
House intelligence report to the flnice in 
February, accusations grew louder that Congress 
could not be trusted with oversight. The people 
believed.. Writing in the New York -Review of 
Books (April 1), I. F. Stone made an astonish-
ingly persuasive case for the bizarre possibility that 
the CIA leaked the House report to an unwitting 
'Schorr ? a-rnasterstrOke which channeled public an-
ger toward a virulent "secrety backlash." 
"It used to .be that a person could live isolated 
from the world's problems," muses the "Peanuts" 
character Lucy, playing psychiatrist. "Then it got to 
be that we all knew everything that was going on. 
The problem now," she tells poor Snoopy, "is that 
we know everything about everything except what's 
going on.. That's why you feel nervous. . . . Five 
cents, please!" _Given the clandestine community's 
past record, now only . tough legal restraints and con-
gressional oversight -- as well as genuinely indepen-
dent review, at the executive level and a. special 
prosecutor for intelligence cases ? can assure that 
intelligence ? will serve us. Otherwise, the Amer-
ican people will be short more than a nickel, we'll 
still be nervous, and we still won't know what is 
-going on. 
The Senate Select Committee asked fOr a new 
oversight panel to draft omnibus legislation to recast 
the N'ational Security Act of 1947 and frame explicit 
intelligence charters. Two initial "reform" efforts ? 
President Ford's February executive order and At-
torney General Edward Levi's April FBI guidelines 
on domestic investigations?are ,not yet embodied 
in law. While many of the Church committee's 1 Sa 
recommendations enn ust oversight responsibilities 
to agency types. cabinet officers, and President's men 
who have been untrustworthy in the past, the 
Church plan taken as a whole attempts, to put 
our check-and-balance system into better working 
order not to tie the hands of intelligence but to 
enable it to serve a democratic society's needs with-
out undermining its cherished principles.. Some of 
the Church committee's key points of reform are 
these: 
0 The CIA, the National Security Agency, and the 
clandestine arms of the Department of Defense must 
stay out of the domestic arena. Only the FBI should 
conduct domestic security investigations which are 
aimed at acts that violate federal laws. Under restric-
tions which some senators. believe are not stringent 
enough, "preventive intelligence investigations" are 
allowed. in order to .head off terrotist plots or 
counteract the designs of Itostile foreign agents. 
Current bureau plat:tie-es suggest that new laws, 
recommended by the panel, most be enacted to 
prevent COINTELPRO red ttx: the FBI still has 2

? A "comprehensive civil remedies statute" should 
be enacted to give American citizens clear claim for. 
?: litigation against the government. The Justice De-
? partment is making efforts to notify COINTELPRO 
victims, and under the Freedom of Information Aci 
Citizens may succeed in finding out about intelligence 
activity directed against them (a local ACLU office 
can help). 
? The. CIA must get out of the covert publishing 
business in the' U.S. While the "operational" use of 
? American academics would not be banned, top uni-
versity officials Must be informed of CIA use. Laws. 
arc also recommended to prohibit the operational 
use of missionaries and media personnel. (In Feb-
? ruary the CIA announced it had "no secret paid or 
contractual relationships" with U.S. clergy, but said 
? it would "continue to welcome information" from 
voluntary clergy-in for man ts. Even, when requested 
by the churches, former CIA Director Colby had re-
fused to halt the use of missionaries; the CIA under 
George Bush still insists that there is no "impropri?
ety" in its Clergy and media use. The Senate report 
tells of a Third World pastor-agent who carried out 
covert-action projects, developed CIA ."assets,". and 
passed its propaganda to the local press. He or ,she. 
was Only one of 21 similarly cooperative clergy.) 
O Covert activities, the Church panel says, should be 
?'employed only by the CIA and only when "required 
by _extraordinary circumstances to deal With grave 
threats to national security" a definition that . 
would drastically. curtail CIA's past habits. Going 
'beyond President Ford's- proposal, the senators 
? would ban all political assassinations, fixing of dem-
ocratic elections, and covert support for foreign 
police that systematically violate human rights. 
O The senators have asked that the FBI director be 
limited to an eight-year term, and they have chart-
ed myriad bureaucratic changes to improve intel-
?- ligence effectiveness and to create "paper trails" of 
accountability. Building on *Ford's plan for 
strengthening the role of the Director of Central 
Intelligence, the Church committee would have the 
DCI prepare the budget and allocate resources for 
the ntire clandestine community. ,His post should 
? be separated from that of CIA head in order to avoid 
a conflict of interest. 
0 The central clement in the Church ? plan is a 
? powerful, well-informed Senate oversight committee 
with rotating membership, budgetary authority, leg-. 
islative powers, and the 'right to receive advance 
notice of all ':significant" covert operations. How-
ever the Senate's oversight apparatus will actually 
function ?and that will be subj ecnto some senatorial 
political machinations ? it is. well to keep in mind 
Senator Mike NIansfield's general warning against "a 
? committee cloaked with only apparent importance, 
- in the end so impotent that it would itself be-
come a creature if not an active conspirator within 
?, the community over which it must exert scrutiny." 
..Iv.. 
In an age of proliferating nuclear, powers, it 
? would be -naive to propose that we have no need for 
intelligence services. It would be equally na? to 
trust the c/andestine establishment as the sole, SeCiet 
guardian of our national security. The Senate panel 
has attempted to steer carefully between these twin 
naivetes. It has envisioned comprehensive, if cau-
tious, reform which we clearly, need: yet for a num-
ber of reasons, it is altogether possible that we could 
get soniethiiig considerably less. ? 
First there is the nature of the Senate inquiry 
itself. Avoiding the House committee's adversary 
style and appearance of leakiness, the Senate panel 
strove *to be a tightlipped model for future over-
sight. The committee held most of its hearings. in 
secret and worked closely with the administration, 
even deleting at its request2.00 pages fiorsi'? the 
published text. Nantes arc frequently. missing, and; 
like the full House, the Senate panel voted at the 
last minute not to reveal the total intelligence 
budget. The, concessions made to secrecy seem to 
have undermined the impact of the report ?and 
even helped those forces which oppose strong over-
sight. Three panel members? Senators Walter F. 
Mondale, Philip A. Hart and Gary Hart ?have 
warned that the report is 'diluted" in important. 
respects, and-that the secrecy stamp has caused some 
of the report's "most important implications Ito be] 
either lost or obscured in vague language." 
In mid-May, however, the committee mounted an 
effective 'media strategy by steadily , releasing a 
stream of t5 supplementary reports, which made the 
nightly news with graphic tales of abuse for several 
weeks. The strategy forced the directors of CIA and 
IRS to reply, and finally ?after all this time?
wrung A down-in-the-mouth public apology from. 
Clarence Kelley, the FBI head who has been under 
pressure from the ranks of bureau faithful not to 
confess Hoover's wrongdoing. While drama was 
needed to heat the debate up again, zeal for reform 
is likely to cool as the refinements of law are worked 
out in the coming yeas. - 
The times are also against reform. After the 
mazive losses of Vietnam and 'Watergate, the intelli-
gence debate is set at a historic juncture for U.S. 
international, leadership and trust in American 
institutions at httme. It is commonly realized that 
political agreement about covert operations has. dis-
integrated. During oversight debate earlier this year, 
former CIA head. John McCone urged that the cold-
war -conSensus. be rebuilt. World events, national 
politics ?and covert propaganda somewhere? 
seem already to be moving the United States toward 
a 'os version of that old consensus, in spite of 
lessons learned. This emerging climate of opinion 
could block the overhaul of intelligence agencies 
? without which, in Nelson Rockefeller's \cords, we 
would be "a sitting duck in a World of loaded shot- . 
guns." 
In times that tolerate such cold-war rhetoric (and . 
a gargantuan new defense budget), security and rut-
tional-security have become common themes for an 
election year in which an ailing economy has further - 
weakened a progressive national spirit.' Carnpailn 
language everywhere betrays fears of the loss ()}7 
American omnipotence?or rather that delusion of 
superpower, in the view of Frank Church, which dis-
patches squads of. covert agents to police the world. 
In this climate the intelligence -flap" is a nou-
issue. While big-government fears fuel the presi-
dential campaigns, the cal menace of Big Brother

. government provokes from the major candidates 
nary a whisper. The perennial, inanities of our 
national politicking are in part responsible:for this 
omission. The intelligence., issue is far too complex 
and abstract to lend itself to sloganeering and head-
line-length promises. -We have beard more campaign 
yawp about abortion ? an. important issue but one 
with which Presidents have little to do ? than about 
where each hopeful stands on civil-liberties issues' 
such as Senate lull One. Where would each candi-
date.draw the line on covert activities? How weidd 
? he see his role as chief of the most awesome. system 
of clandestine power in the world? 
Although intelligence reform is fundamenially a 
law-and-order issue which ought to appeal to con-
servative voters, this cautious election year augurs ill 
for reform in two additional ways. The widespread 
. reaction against the tofios makes it hard for many to 
sympathize. with the victims of those years ? with the 
'single exception of Martin Luther King. The candi 
dates know this. They are not about to champion 
the Socialist Workers Party,. slain Black Panthers 
and New Left activists ?.although these are only the 
most outrageously maligned of the multitude spied 
upon, which included such sterling citizens as 
Eleanor Roosevelt and thousands of ordinary, tax7. 
return-filing Americans. We are still, it seems,. 
unwittingly suffering from the deceits of COIN-i. 
TELPRO propaganda. It becomes 'difficult toi 
picture those years other than the way we perceived 
them then ? and in the collective consciousness of 
the electorate, it was all so long ago. 
The test of vigilance which faces the American 
public comes in the year of our bicentennial when 
most of all we should, in the words of Torn Paine, 
"refresh our patriotism by reference to first princi-
ples." Yet the congressional probing of intelligence 
was inevitably' anticlimactic after Watergate's daily 
drama; and the audience, given to ephemeral in- .-
tensities, soon got tired of the show. There are other 
reasons too why our vigilance has flagged. In a New 
Republic interview with Oriana FaIlaci, Congress-
man Otis Pike speaks about why House members 
have not rushed. out to read the guarded copies of 
the intelligence report they had voted to keep to 
themselves: 
Oh, they think it is better not to know. There are 
too many things that embarrass Americans in that 
report. You see, this country went through an awful 
trauma with Watergate. But, ?even then; all they 
were asked to believe was that their President had 
been a bad person. In this new situation they are 
asked much more; they are asked to believe that 
their country has been evil. And nobody wants to 
believe that. . . . was one of [those who believed. 
the government]. It took this investigation to con-
vince me that I had always been told lies, to make 
me realize that 1 was tired of being told lies. [April 3, 
1976, p. to]. 
Perhaps it is hard to feel some personal animus 
toward typical bureau mumblings that defend the 
indefensible, like Clarence Kelley's apology for the 
FBI ("Power abused perhaps can be explained anti. 
possibly even be excused, but only when the ex-
planation is truthful, contrite, and is accompanied 
by a well-defined plan to prevent a recurrence"). In 
the broadest of human terms it is no unique indict-
ment that the average American citizen finds it bard 
to care very much about what the CIA has done. All 
of us like a personal world? we revel in gossip., in 
the Nixon of the bedroom and the White .,House 
chapel. 'We want persons behind the evil events of 
our times. The congressional inquiries did not raise 
up new national heroes or villains. 
As the psychologist Ernest Becker has 'tvritten, for 
the sensitive soul the impersonality of evil the 
central fact of the contemporary world ? is unbear-
able: it is, as he says, too much to believe. What has 
begun to seepinto public consciousness is that the 
horror of the CIA? and in the end, all of intelli-
gence, "theirs" or "ours" ? is its impersonality, ex-
pressed in its bland, emotionless, mind-deadening 
-prose. 'We know that its faceless agents are "out 
there" ? though we do not know quite where even. 
now ? on missions that sacrifice 'persons to ideology, 
human relationships to "contacts" and "assets," 
hearts and minds to the gears of the propaganda 
-machine. If the horror of CIA is its abstract imper-
sonality, that is also its impenetrable advantage: for 
we cannot act against what is vastly beyond our power 
to see and believe. 
Legal issues are abstract,, and as the framing of 
' new intelligence laws goes en through the rest of the 
year, most Americans -will probably not be able to 
keep up with. all the detail. The danger of partial, 
compromised reform is that it might create nothing 
more than a framework of loopholes ? a set-op for 
CIA's vanishing acts_ If Americans do not .press, for 
stringent intelligence laws in the emerging cold -way 
clirnate of Congress and country, even the news that-, 
reform has' been done could turn out to be the 
biggest lie yet that my Uncle Sam told ore.

1500 Wiedricti - 
Soviet spies ?b re 
deep into U S. 
SOVIET BLOC spies have tried to re-
cruit executive branch personnel of the 
American government as well as con-
. gressional staff members in Washington.' 
They have devoted special attention to 
Capitol Hill staffers with easy access to 
secret inforrnaticn, as well as code 
? clerks, secretaries, and typists across 
whose desks intelligence vital to the 
Communist dream of world domination 
might flow. 
They have hustled eide cross sec-
tion of other American citizens in the 
hope of developing undercover traitors 
err double agents ad they have even 
attempted to-influence the United States 
policy decisions by seeking to compro-
mise informants at the highest levels.. 
THESE ARE SOME .4f the facts about 
Soviet spy operations in the United 
States by the two Russian intelligence 
agencies?the KGB and the GRU?that 
lie buried within the pages of the 12-vol-
ume,report ,of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee , chaired by Sen. Frank 
Church ED., Ida.) , 
They -tick out a warning about the 
? Soviet threat to the national security of 
this country with the subdued ferocity of 
a time homli. 
? But they have been largely ignored by 
the media, possibly because . they are 
buried between more controversial chap-
ters bulging with critical appraisals of 
the American intelligence community. 
. In short, the Church committee did its 
job by inquiring into both American in-; 
telligence operations and the Soviet spy , 
, it as remis in failing t o dramatize the 
apparatus in/North America. However,

by the U.S.S.R. and its network of espio-
nage agents here. i 
; I 
ACCORDING Ti) the Senate report, 
about a third of the 10,000 personnel 'f 
countries where there are U.S. installa-
tions of where American citizens live. 
"Another objective is the recruitment 
and cultivation of 'agents of influence' 
or agents who can influence political 
events or decisions," the Senate report 
declared. - . ' ? 
"Soviet intelligence also mounts tech-
nical operations against U.S.- installa-
tions and personnel. ? -- ! 
"Planting of microphones and instalIa-

selective in the West, but they .do .on-

: "The primary targets are the offices_ 
and residences of U.S.- ambassadors, 
senior foreign personnel, CIA officers, 
.and defense attaches." 
The committee. reported there have 
been rare instances where the FBI has 
had reason to suspect that contacts be-

THOSE. ARE ANCY words for trea-
son by extortion or possible duplicity, 
but they nevertheless sound a macabre 
note for a nation that has just finished 
emasculating substantial segments of its 
own intelligence gathering apparatus.. 
Evidently, the FBI and CIA have em, 
joyed some success in positively identi-
fying some of the KGB and GRU spies 
who pervade the American landscape. 
The so called "illegals" are another 
problem not so expeditiously countered. ? 
The illegal is a highly trained espio-
nage specialist who has been slipped 
into the U. S. with' a phony identity. 
Some have, been trained in scientific. or 
technical fields to give them easy access 
to employment in sensitive areas. 
, Detection of such individuals presents 
a serious problem to the FBI because 
once they enter the United States seith 
either true or fraudulent identification. 
they become lost among the swamis of 
legitimate emigres that. have been arriv-
ing here in increasing numbers. - 
In 19721 there were fewer than 550 
Soviet immigrants to this county. In ? 
1974, the number rose to 4,000. 
"Relatively undetected," the FBI -told 
the Church committee. "they [the i1le-

Although the. committeereport avoids

THE 'UNITED STATES remains the 
prime target of the Soviet intellig,entie 
? services, detente notwithstanding... : 
The U.S.S.R. carries out espioene. 
, and covert action operations on a lei ge ? 
scale against this nation, because it con- . 
siders it its "mainenemy." 
. And, to achieve . these objectives both 
in the U.S. and abroad, Russia utilizes 
not only the talents of its two spy agen-
cies ? the KGB and the GRU'?- but the 
intelligence and security services of its 
Iron Curtain satellites. 
I?IAIN TARGETS of the Soviet assault, 
' 
on the national security of the 'United 
States are federal gevernment officials, 
Youth, journalist, tied trade. organiza-
tions, and the business, scientific, and 
political communities. . ? 
The Kremlin has upgraded Red Chine. 
to almost the same status of the U.S. as 
an espionage target since Soviet-Sino re-
lations soured. 
However, the United States remains 
the priority target of the KGB and 
CRU, so Soviet spies view detente with - 
mixed emotions. 
? 
For while it has afforded them greeter 
opportunities to plumb the U.S. toeiaury

enhanced the American capability as a

The committee also investigated the 
:threat posed to the United States by the 
, Soviet spy apparatus. It failed, however, 
to give equal emphasis to the depreda-
, tions of the KGB and its sister services 
: when it unleashed its criticism of the 
CIA and FBI last April. 
Nonetheless, ? there are shocking con-
clusions to be felled in .the chapters of 
the Senate report dealing with the Soviet 
intrusion here if one will take the time 
to root them out. 
"The espionage activities of the Soviet 
Union and other Communist nations di-
rected against the United States are ex-
tensive and relentless," the committee 
found. ? ? - 
e And, to carry . out such operations 
. against the U.S. awl other Western coun-
tries, the Kremlin maintains a clandes-
tine establishment estimated to total 10,-
000 personnel by the CIA. 
In addition, it supplements-this flying 
phalanx of professional spies with the 
resources of its T,,:ast European stooges 
and is said by the ? CIA to effectively 
control Fidel Castro's Cuban intelligence 
service, the DGI.

TRIBUNE, Scranton

Dallas Postscripts 
? Some students of American history, and 
various writers who researched and wrote 
on the subject, never accepted the general 
ac:count of the assassination of Abraham 
Lincoln, that it merely was the act of a 
? disgruntled actor, John Wilkes Booth. 
Instead, theories were offered of 
conspiracies of one kind or another, 
including plots put together by Lincoln's 
political rivals and even people high in his 
administration. 
Now, more than a decade after the 
assassination of President John F. 
Kennedy, it seems likely that 
dissatisfaction will persist far into the 
future over the shooting down of the 
President in Dallas. Calls are heard for a 
reopening of the investigation, for reviews 
of the work of the Warren Commission and 
for deep examination of the conclusions that 
Lee Harvey Oswald alone conceived and 
carried out the assassination. . 
Pennsylvania's U.S. Sen. Richard 
"Schweiker has become strongly identified in 
uncertainties and misgiving about the 
investigation of the assassination, 
particularly- on the point of whether the 
Warren Commission was given all of the 
data it should have received from the 
Central Intelligence Agency and the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Now a flat 
accusation is made that the CIA and FBI did 
hide facts. A Senate committee that 
investigated intelligence agencies said the 
commission did not consider the possibility 
That .Fidel Castro arranged the 
assassination because the CIA didn't tell the 
panel about purported U.S. plans to kill 
Castro. 
There are, of course, previous reports 
. that the late J. Edgar Hoover, FBI director, 
never told the commission that the FBI 
destroyed a threatening note Oswald sent to 
Dallas agents before the assassination and. 
did not disclose 17 agents were disciplined 
for failing to recognize Oswald as a security 
threat. All this has led the Senate committee 
to note "the possibility exists" of a 
deliberate cover-up 'by senior officials of 
both the CIA and FBI. 
Since the Warren Commission report 
was issued, there have been careful 
considerations of it and tests of many of its 
points, most of which have been resolved by 
the reviewers in favor of the commission. 
Even the Senate committee now accusing 
the CIA and FBI of not being fully candid 
says it has no evidence to overturn .the. 
finding of the conclusion that Oswald alone 
killed. President Kennedy. It seems 
reasonable, however, that many will agree 
with Senator Schweiker that "there is no 
reason to have faith" in the Warren 
Commission's "picture of the Kennedy 
assassination.'" On that score there always 
has been doubt and it very well will linger.

NEW REPUBLIC 
& 10 July 1976 
Un likely Assassin 
Once again the "Cuban Connection" has been raised to 
explain the assassination of President John Kennedy. 
But this time it carries the imprimatur of the United 
States Senate. Senator Richard Schweiker released last 
-week the report of the CIA subcommittee that 
investigated the Lillie of President -Kennedy. The 
report is 106 pages long and deals with many of the 
current theories held by assassination buffs. I cannot 
deal with all of these, but want to shed some light on 
one rased by Schweiker. 
Although the report comes to no clear conclusion, it 
does cite testimony, memos andmaterial that raise the 
possibility that Castro might have ordered Kennedy's 
death in retaliation for CIA attempts on his life. 
I do not want to defend or criticize the Schweiker 
report nor the various theories. I do want to put forth 
what Fidel Castro said about these theories. To my 
knowledge, in the fast two years Castro has spoken five 
times about the assassination of President Kennedy?
in July and September 1974, again in May and August 
1975, and recently in April of this year when he 
proclaimed in a public speech in Havana that he had 
nething to do with the killing of President Kennedy. 
But his personal and private conversations during 
the 1974 and 1975 meetings are far more interesting 
and comprehenive, and reveal in greater detail his own 
thoughts and feelings: not only in the words 
but in the style and mood- of the conversations. 
In July 1974 Frank Mankiewicz and I spent four days 
with Castro, including 13 hours of formal interviewing 
in Castro's office, making a television documentary for 
CBS. During this interview and in private conver-
sations, we talked with Castro about Kennedy and the 
:assassination. We asked Castro point-blank whether 
John Kennedy was killed in retaliation for an 'attempt 
on his own life. Castro paused, reflected, puffed on his 
cigar and gave a clear and detailed answer?in part as 
follows: "I have not read this in any serious American 
publication . there are so many imponderables 
behind President Kennedy's assassination that it would 
be a good thing if this were known someday. I .have 
heard that there are certain deruments that will not be 
published until after 100 years and I ask myself why. 
What secrets snrround the Kennedy assassination that 
these papers cannot be published? . . We have never 
believed in carrying out this type of activity of 
assassination of adversaries .... and our own 
background proves it . .. we fought a war. . . we were 
not trying to kill Batista. It would have been easier to 
kill Batista than to have .fought the Moncada. Why? 
Because we do. not believe that the system is abolished 
by liquidating leaders, and it was the system that we 
opposed . it went against our political ideas to 
organize any type of personal attack against Kennedy 
.. we understood what the implications were, and we 
were concerned about the possibility that an attempt 
would be made to blame Cuba for what had happened, 
but this was not what concerned us most. In reality, we 
were disgusted, because, all hone!) we were in conflict 
with Kennedy politically, w h.,d nothing against him 
personally, and there was 110 reason to wish him 
personal harm." 
In addition, Castro made a not her private point?one 
he repeated to Senator James Abourezk in August 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08: 
1975. "Wewould have been foolish tobarm Kennedy,". 
Castro said, "because Kennedy was thinking of 
changing his policy. toward . Cuba. Kennedy's 
negotiators werein Cuba at the time Of the assassina-
tion." 
Castro was referring to a November 1903 visit by 
French journalist Jean Daniel who, before he traveled. 
to Cuba, was personally asked by ['resident Kennedy to 
transmit messages to Castro. Castro described the. 
.meeting to me: 'As I was listeningtoei;erything Daniel 
was telling me about his conversation with Kennedy, 
the news broke over the radio that an attempt had been 
carried out against Kennedy's life. In reality, I tell you 
personally, and I _think 1 speak for ? all my 'fellow 
revolutionariese4We'Ml.felt a reaction of pain, of great 
displeasure . . it was really such a shame, such a tragic 
ending to Kennedy's life." 
As indicated in his discussions of July 1974, Castro 
has-been sensitive to the fact that some people might 
want to make .a connection between the Kennedy 
assassination and Cuba as a? result of activity in the 
"Fair Play for Cuba Committee" and Oswald's applica-
tion for a visa to Cuba. As. Senator McGovern 
remembers the conversation, Castro "expressed dis-
may over a possible association and wasfrightened at ? 
the prospect of circumstantial evidence." In - that ? 
conversation Castro said, "My God, if that [the Nisa 
application] had gone through, it would have looked 
terrible." In his conversation with me, Castro went into 
further detail: "It is very interesting that this man?
Oswald?who was 'involved in the ? assassination, 
'traveled to Mexico a few months prior to the. 
assassination and applied for a permit at the. Cuban 
Embassy to travel to Cuba, and he Was not given the 
permit. We had no idea who he was. But I asked myself 
why would a man who committed :such art act try to 
. come here. Sometime:, we ask ourselves if someone did 
not wish to involve Cub i in this, because Pm under the 
impression that Kennedy's assassination was organized 
by reactionaries in the United States, and that it was all 
a result of conspiracy. 
"What I can say is that he asked permission to travel 
to Cuba. Now, imagine that by coincidence he had been 
granted this permit, tht he had visited Cuba for a few 
days, then returned to the United States and killed 
Kennedy. That would have been material for provoca-
tion . In a later conversation with Saul Landau., 
Castro added, "Luckily the bureaucratic process 
prevailed and our consular officer routinely denied 
Oswald's visa. We had never heard of him." 
A look at the historical context seems to indicate that 
what Castro said has the ring of truth.  Why would 
Castro kill Kennedy at the very moment that Kennedy. 
had clearly indicated to personal messengers in Cuba on 
? November 22 that the US wanted to start a new 
dialogue? At no time under Castro's rule has Cuba been 
accused of assassinating or plotting to assassinate its 
adversaries. 'During the fighting in the mountains 
there was never a reported Castro attempt on Batista's 
life. And lastly, why tvcmid a small country like Cuba. 
attempt the assassination of the President of 0-is-1.Jnited 
States, when discovery and proof of that act would 
have meant certain and clear ? action and 
probably destruction of Cdstro't; Cittb,t?

Staff Split: 
By Cynthia Kadonaga. 
s ? 
Washington Post Mat t Writer. 
Political and Personal bick-
ering has split the staff of, 
Counter-Spy, a magazine the 
Central Intelligence Agency 
partially blamed for the mar- . 
der of an Athens agency of-
ficial last December. 
Although the magazine's. 
office is closed and four, of: 
Its seven staff members have. 
resigned, those who remain. 
said the magazine will con-' 
tinue to be published by a 
new staff: ? 
The magazine gained na-
tional attention after former 
CIA Director William E. Col-
by said it Contributed to the 
assassination of Athens sta-
tion chief Richard S. Welch. 
Counter-Spy had listed. 
Welch as a CIA official in 
its winter issue, and the in-
formation later was pub-
lished in an English-language 
Athens newspaper. 
Those who reject Colby's 
accusation point out that 
Welch lived in an Athens 
house traditionally reserved 
for the top CIA official. He 
was not operating under 
? cover. ? 
. According to Harvey Kahn, 
? a former Counter-Spy staff 
member, the split resulted 
partly from differences over 
how the staff should be or-
ganized. 
"Some people, like me, be-
lieved that a collective was 
still viable," he said in ? a 
phone conversation. "But 
other people wanted to aban-
don the collective process 
and go into a more tradi-
tional, less democratic orga-
? nization. Instead of going 
? through a power struggle, we 
decided to quit." - .? 
Both current and former 
members said that personal-
ity clashes also contributed 
to the split. One member re-

members of being police ' 
agents, anticommunists, sex-
ists and liberals.

has not resigned, said in an

The Schweiker disclosures 
The fresh disclosures on 
President Kennedy's assas-
sination by Sen. Richard 
Schweiker, R-Pa., raise 
? intriguing questions but 
they do not, as he suggests, 
vitiate the findings of .the 
Warren Commission. 
Schweiker's claim that 
his probings leave the na-
tion with no further cause to 
have faith in the Warren. 
Commission 
Commission is an exaggera-
tion. The senator has, it is 
true, found a gap in the 
commission's inquiry and 
he has somewhat laborious-
ly woven a tapestry of as-
sorted facts that point to 
. Fidel Castro as the man be-
hind Lee Harvey Oswald. 
,..Kennedy assassination 
buffs-will be stimulated to 
new frenzies by Schweik-e 
er's discovery that the com-
mission did not prod the 
CIA or the FBI into exten-
sive inquiries on the Cuban 
angle. There was more con-
cern with Oswald's links to 
Russia than with his friend-
liness toward Castro. One 
member, former Sen. John 
Sherman Cooper, is quoted 
as saying that he doesn't re-
call any deep discussions of 
the Castro angle. 
It is clearer now than it 
was then, even to members 
of the commission, that Cas-
tro had some cause to con--
? sider retaliatory measures 
against the American Presi-
dent. Richard Helms, then 
CIA director of operations, 
could have made the situa-
tion clearer by informing 
the commission that the, 
agency had take." serious 
; ? 
would have the same per-
sonality clashes .and disa-
greements over organization 
as the old staff.

steps, with presidential 
backing, to bump off Cas-
tro. But as Helms testified 
later, no one asked him 
about it and the agency had 
'lots of license in those days 
to keep its secrets, to itself.. 
But. 
? But. President Kennedy 
had not hidden his anxiety 
to see Castro out of the way. 
In his Miami speech four 
days before his death, he 
talked of Castro's -small 
band of conspirators as the 
only obstacle to good 
Cuban-American relations. 
"Once this barrier is re-
Moved," he declared, "we 
will be ready and anxious to 
work with the Cuban peo-
ple." These words could 
have-prompted the commis-
sion to consider Castro's 
reaction_ 
- However, Schweiker 
seems to be stretching his 
case when he links the 
assassination to the CIA ne-
gotiations with AMLASII, a 
high Cuban official who was 
entreating U.S. support for 
a coup d'etat. Agency offi-
cials refused to give AM-
LASH the weapons he want-
ed or to have any part of his 
assassination plans until al-
most ? the same hour the 
President was shot. This 
sad irony makes it hard to 
believe that Dallas was a 
retaliation for the AMLASH 
?dealings. 
Similarly, Schweiker's 
case gains interest but little 
added weight from his 
fascinating description of J. 
Edgar. Hoover's dog-in-the-
manger dealings with the 
Warren Commission. Hoov-

er's inclination to put the 
FBI's reputation ahead of 
its (lurk to work closely with 
the commission does not 
seem as surprising now as 
it might have in 1964. The 
country has learned a lot 
about the kinds of gimes 
Hoover played. 
But the FBI and CIA 
spared no efforts to estab-
lish the range of Oswald' 
contacts, and nothing in the 
Schweiker findings ties him 
any closer to Cuban intelli-
gence. He brawled on the 
street and talked on the 
radio in behalf of Castro in 
New Orleans. He did not 
hide from his wife his frus-
trated attempt to reach 
Havana.' This is not the 
behavior pattern of ,a man 
tapped bra secret mission. 
Schweiker has turned up 
some question marks. It 
would be interesting to 
learn more about the two 
men who slipped into Mexi-
co and flew to Cuba soon 
?after the assassination. 
? Perhaps More scrutiny 
should be given to Castro's 
unusual interview with an 
American reporter three 
months before the assassi-
nation. He warned then that 
American leaders would be 
in danger if they assisted 
any attempt to do away 
with Cuban leaders. ? 
But the grim episode 
should not be stirred into 
? another formal investiga-
tion unless there is new 
information which flatly re-. 
futes the conclusions by the 
Warren Commission. The 
Schweiker disclosures do 
not justify another ingeiry. 
A Lawsuit in Moscow 
? An :American newsmagazine correspondent has 
taken on a Soviet newsmagazine which called him a 
CIA agent. In a gutsy move believed to be the first of 
its kind, Alfred Friendly Jr. of Newsweek filed suit in 
Moscow demanding that the Soviet weekly Literatur-
, nya Gazeta retract the charge. A doubtless surprised 
judge accepted the complaint and set a hearing date 
for next Friday. "I can't let a smear like that stand,-
Friendly explained to a correspondent for The New 
? York Times, which also had one of its men in Moscow-
identified as a CIA spook. An Associated Press corre-
? spondent also made the Gazeta's list, and all of them

among Kremlinolog,ists is that the attack by the offi-
cial Soviet magazine was either: A) retaliation for re-
cent charges in the American press that some Russian 
? journalists here are KGB agents, or B) a warning to 
Sovictseitizens to keep shy of American correspond-

he - Cuban Connectioni 
. The report of the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence Activities 
on the assassination of President John 
F. Kennedy lends official substance to 
. suspicions that are widespread. 
? The 106-page report says that the 
Central Intelligence. Agency and the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation with-
held information material to the War-
ren Commission's investigation of the 
killing of President Kennedy in Dallas 
in 19'63. Both the CIA and, then FBI 
gave a greater priority to bureaucratic 
face-saving than to the pursuit of the 
truth. 
Both the CIA and the FBI were con-
cerned with keeping the Warren Com-
mission's investigation focused 
narrowly on Lee Harvey Oswald (who 
was killed by Jack Ruby in the Dallas 
jail, a murder millions saw on televi-
Sian) and closing the case quickly. 
Just four days after the assassina-
tion, Attorney General Nicholas Katz-
enbach sent a memo to the White 
House saying: 
"The public must be satisfied that 
Osviald was the assassin; that he did 
not have confederates who are still at 
large; and that the evidence was such 
that he would have been convicted at 
Furthermore, the Attorney General 
said that speculation about the mo-
tives of Oswald "ought to be cut off, 
? a - 
THE PHI LP.D ELPHIA 
27 June 1976. 
? and we should have some basis for re- . 
butting thought that this was a Com-
munist conspiracy or (as the Iron 
Curtain press is saying) a right-wing? 
conspiracy to blame it on the Commu-
nists." 
Specifically3 the report says that CIA - 
Director Allen W. Dulles never told 
? the Warren Commission of the CIA's 
involvement in assassination plots 
against Cuba's Fidel Castro. It details 
extensively the CIA's scheming to as-
sassinate the Cuban Premier and notes 
the fears, ignored at higher levels in 
Washington, "that Castro would retal-
iate in some way." 
Also the report says that Director J. 
Edgar Hoover was fearful that the FBI 
might be criticized for failing to inves-
tigate Lee Harvey Oswald thoroughly. 
Mr. Hoover viewed the Warren Com-
mission as an adversary body, the re-
port says, and concealed from its . 
members the disciplinary action he. 
took against 17 FBI personnel in the 
investigation's mishandling. ? (Some 
were not disciplined until the Warren 
Commission's work was completed in 
1964.) 
In sum, the Warren Commission's 
finding that Lee Harvey Oswald acted 
alone in killing President Kennedy 
was reached upon the basis nfincom-
plete information and facts pertinent 
to the probe were kept secret. Second-. 
A;diew JFK. probe is jusli'fi 
,?.. 
Sp;eaking- at a news conference on. 
the release of the fifth and final re-
port of the Senate Select Committee 
on Intelligence Activities, Sen. Rich-
ard _S_ Schweiker of Pennsylvania ac-
cused the CIA and the FBI of a "cov-
er-up" and declared that "there is no 
longer -any reasbn to have faith" in 
the Warren Commission's picture of 
the aS8assination of President John 
F. Kennedy. 
We -think Sen. Schweiker overstates 
the case. 
The Warren Commission, it will be 
recall "cl, had concluded that Lee Har-
vey.0swald, acting alone, had killed 
President Kennedy. The Senate Select 
Committee rep6rt, in which Sen. 
Schweiker played an important role, 
concludes that there is no evidence 
"sufficient to justify a conclusion that 
tlier:e-Nv.is a conspiracy to assassinate 
President Kennedy." 
ThiSh is not to say, though, that 
there is nothing to justify a new in-
vestigation of the tragedy, called for 
by Sea. ?Schweiker. For there is evi-
_ ? 
guessing the Warren Report has be-
come a national pastime virtually. 
The Senate committee stops short of 
suggesting that Oswald was part of a 
plot. The existing evidence is not 
"sufficient to justify a conclusion that 
there was a conspiracy to assassinate 
President Kennedy," the report says. 
Nevertheless, it notes that important 
leads were not pursued at the time 
and it hints strongly that there was a 
Cuban connection that might be cor-
roborated by a new probe. 
It may not be possible to establish 
the truth at this time.,But the Warren 
Commission's findings are disbelieved 
widely and may be completely discred-
ited by the Senate Select Committee's 
report. After he left the White House 
President Lyndon Johnson said that 
he thought President Kennedy was the 
victim of a Cuban plot. Senator Rich-
ard Schweiker, the Pennsylvania Re-
publican who has been demanding 
that the investigation be reopened, 
says that there are "important new 
leads" to be pursued, some still secret. 
Senators Frank Church (D.-Idaho), the 
chairman of the Select Committee. 
and Gary Hart (D-Colo.), who pre-
pared the report with Senator Schwei-
ker, wants a new probe too. Nothing 
less will be acceptable to a cynicak, 
public. 
dence, as the Senate intelligence 
panel reports, that the CIA and the 
FBI not only failed to investigate 
thoroughly but did in fact cover up 
crucial information from the investi-
gation and the Warren Commission. 
The CIA, it is now known, was at 
the time of -the assassination and in 
the months before actively working 
on plans to do away with Cuban -Pre-
mier Fidel Castro, and Castro knew 
quite a bit about what the CIA was up 
to. Yet the late Allen W. Dulles, CIA 
director, though himself a member of 
the Wan-en Commission, did not in-
form his fellow members -of the CIA 
plots. And, as the committee report 
declares, -senior CIA .officials "di-
rected their subordinates to conduct 
an investigation without- telling them 
of these vital facts:: 
As for the FBI, the late Director J. 
Edgar .Hoover within:31d vital informa-

BULLETIN, Providence 
11 June 1976 
? This is not a happy hour in Washing-
ton. The hot breath of scandal bangs 
like summer smog over Congress. 
? Charges of one member's private profit 
from his public office and another's 
personal gratification at public expense 
have electrified the House Ethics Com-
mittee into life, and this is as it should 
be; congressional abuse of power and 
public funds is a serious matter that 
cannot be permitted to go unchecked. 
But an additional tragedy of the cur-
rent controversy is that the balance of 
this session is likely to be spent attack: 
? lug or defending congressional honor

? . 
while our larger accomplishments are 
obscured and our major tasks go unfin-
ished. Nowhere is this more apparent 
than in the matter of congressional Ov-
ersight of our hydra-headed intelli. 
gence community. 
One accomplishment which should 
not go unnoticed was the Senate's over-
whelming Vote to establish a strong. 
new oversight committee; this was no 
? small accomplishment because it came. 
over .the strong opposition of commit.; 
tee chairmen who supposedly had been 
scrutinizing the intelligence agencies 
over the years. The Senate leadership 
fashioned a compromise that gained: 
the grudging support of a good many. 
. conservatives as well as most Senate' 
moderates and liberals: It is by . no: 
i means perfect in its structure or. corn-
? position. Nonetheless, the new Senate. 
committee is not designed to be a paper 
tiger, toothless and eager to purr con-
tentedly in the cozy executive lap. 
? . The committee has exclusive' jurii-
-diction over the CIA, formerly the sole 
preserve of the Armed. Services Com-
mittee. It will share authority: with. 
Armed Services over the huge defense 
intelligence establishment, including, 
? DIA and the National Security Agency.. 
Similarly it will be able to scrutinize 
? the intelligence activities of the FBIesa, 
major source of past abuses. It will, in 
addition, share jurisdiction over, the' 
State Department's small hut important" 
Bureau of Intelligence and Research 
with the Senate Foreign Relations Coro-. 
mittee. 
But the new Committee's most pow, 
,erful tool will lie not simply in its 
power to look over the agencies' shwa-
ders, but rather in its power of thee 
purse. The new zomin'atee has the 
power to authorize apprcpeiatiore of-
funds foe the intelligence agen.eies, a. 
'powerthat it shares with other corrinit-... 
tees for all but the CIA. Tho ,cower to 
atzthortzo &orrice veith It the rower and 
? 'the obligation to know the ageneles`' 
as the CIA 
done its job? 
'Yet another report on the Central intelli-
gence Agency has issued forth from the 
staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee, 
and in some respects this one goes more to 
the heart of the whole matter than any of 
its predecessors. ? ? 
: This study, a history of the CIA and its
deals not with dramatic wrong-
doing or secret weapons but with the basic 
question: how well has the agency done its 
principal job? If this job is to provide 
presidents with top-notch data on what is 
happening around the . world, the agency. 
(says this account) has fallen short. -? 
Because of the anti-Communist climate 
that prevailed when the CIA was formed, 
the study says, the agency focused much of. 
its effort on combating Soviet influence. 
This led naturally to a concentration on 
Covert operations, says the report; intelli- - 
gence gathering and analysis were given 
less attention than they deserved. . ? - 
Moreover, the agency has tended to 
devote much time to preparing a daily 
intelligence summary while its much more. 
important long-term assessments (known as. 
national intelligence estimates) often have 
gone- unread by presidents. Top-ranking 
policymakers, in short, too often have not 
paid .close scrutiny to the intelligence data' 
that has been offered. ? . 
purposes and pursuits. The Senate 'Ma': 
achieved a responsible balance bee. 
tween the need for intelligence activity. 
.and the need for congressional oyes-

Sight and restraint. . 
But while the "other body' his: 
proved itself capable of action, we in
Reuse are in woeful disarray. Our 
attempts at investigating the intelli-
gence agencies have been marred by. 
'Wholesale leaks and internecine squab- - 
bles. This unhappy fact was all too of-
ten noted by our Senate colleagues 
when the posiibiLity of a joint House-
Senate intelligence committee was un-
der consideration. The fact thut the 
Senate decided so decisively to go it

For all its. dry, social-science phraseology, 
this most recent appraisal of the CIA' may 
be the most alarming. For its message is 
that the intelligence function has been 
distorted by bureaucratic infighting and that 
even when the CIA does its own job well, 
men at the top are not inclined to pay dose 
attention. "Senior policymakers Must ac-
tively utilize the intelligence capabilities at 
their disposal," says the study: the Director 
of Central Intelligence "must be constantly 
informed, must press for access, must 
vigorously sell his product and must antici-
pate future demands." 
- This is a sound formula as far as it goes; 
but it provides no remedy for the situation 
in which a President simply ignores what 
the CIA tries to tell him. As Former CIA 
Director William E. Colby recently ob-
served, somewhat ruefully, you can provide 
the. President with plenty of data, "but you 
can't rub his nose in it." 
Despite the spotlight on the agency's 
'doings in the past 18 months, little has been 
done toward a major redirection_ The 
Senate now has a so-called "oversight" 
committee, but the House refused even this 
small step. 
All the new laws, all the internal 
housecleaning, all the congressional "over.-
Sight" ? none of this by itself will restore 
the CIA to effective performance of its 
major mission. The agency needs to keep its 
policy analysis function at the forefront of 
its concern, and its director needs to make 
every effort to see that CIA's long-term 
estimates get the President's attention.

The Warren Commission came to the 
conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald, ? a

and Cuban anti-American associations, 
acted alone in the assassination. 
The Senate committee does not refute 
that finding. Instead, it emphasizes "it

meats of, government, offi-
cials admit they are debet-
lag whether the United 
States' official, public 'action 
may rebound against it -la-
the long run, especially in 
Africa. 
The State Department 
overwhelmingly does not 
share these second thoughts, 
one administration source 
said yeeterday. The Presi-
dent's meesage was ? sent 
with a recommendation by 
Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger, And wan. report-
tro, praising the dictator for his "In-
tense rapport with the Cuban people." ? 
The International Olympic -Commit-
tee has protested Canada's decision; 
But it hastened to add that, although it 
deplores the injection of politics into 
the Olympics, it will not? contemplate 
withdrawing its sanction df the Mon-
treal games. That would be a jerk on-
the leash that Canada would under-
stand.. , ? 
In response to Canada's decision, the 
U.S. Olympic Committee made simper-
ing sounds, threatening to withdraw 
'-from the games if the IOC withdrew its 
sanction of the games. But the IOC said 
- that it has never "even suggested psi-
, tely it would take such action." 
? In 1980 the "host country" will be the 
Soviet Union, which undoubtedly will 
'edit the list of competitors. Will it ban 
Israel? Will it invite the Palestine Lib-
eration Organization to send a team? 
? Will this draw more than unhappy 
words from the U.S.? Such words were 
the only U.S. response when the IOC, at 
,Moscow's behest, banned Radio Free 
Europe from covering the winter 
Olympics in February. 
Speaking to his nation about the Na-
/is, Churchill growled: "What kind of 
people do they think we are?" It is easy 
to imagine what kind of people the Fe

West who still understand that it is dan-

and the November, 1970, un-
successful U.S. commando 
raid -at Sontay, in North Vi-
etnam, which failed in an at-
tempt to rescue American 
prisoners of the Vietnam 
war. 
In explaining the U.S: 
view on Israel's latest ac-
tion, Kissinger said in Chi-
cago on Tuesday, and a 
spokesman yesterday re-
peated that: 
"Clearly, the [Israeli] at 
tack on an airport [Entebbe 
Airport, in Uganda] is an 
unprecedented act. But, 
equally, the hijacking of air-
liners, the holding of a hun-
axed innocent people for 
ransom in a situation where 
the host government, at a

minimum, proved impotent 
?to enforce any, accepted? in-
ternational law, indicates 
that we face here a new in-
ternational problem." ? 
, "We believe," Kissinger 
said, "that it is essential 
that some international ar-
raneement be made to deal 
with terrorists, because it 
cannot be tolerated that in-
nocent people become the 
playthings of international 
thugs." 
While reiterating that pos-
ition yesterday, State De-
, partment spokesman Robert. 
L. Funseth declined to say 
at this time what the Ameri-
can response is to the 
. charge by 'Ugandan Presi-
dent IdiAmin that the Is-
raeli raid was international 
"aggression." 
Funseth said, "Our posi-
tion on these issues will be 
made known during the Se-
? curity Council debate." 
State Department lawyers, 
he said, are still "working 
out our position" on this 
matter and on Israel's use of 
, American C-130s. 
? Under 'the Foreign Mili-
tary Sales Act, Funseth said; 
weapons supplied by the 
United States are to be used 
only "for internal security, 
legitimate self-defense,' and 
to permit the recipient to 
participate in regional col-
lective [defense] arrange-
ments and measures consist-
ent with the U.N. Charter." 
In January, 1969, French 
President ? Charles de 
Gaulle, furious over Israel's 
use of French aircraft in a 
damaging raid on the Beirut 
Airport? in Lebanon, put a 
total embargo on French 
arm sales to Israel. As a re-
sult, Israel became almost 
totally dependent on I.T.S. 
weapons. 
The real rebound poten-
tial that now troubles some 
administration strategists is 
this: although many Afri-
cans, as most American offi-
cials, may welcome the blow 
to erratic Ugandan Presi-
dent Amin, some U.S. ex-
perts are troubled that in 
the long run many African 
blacks nevertheless will con-
clude that the white nations 
are "pushing them around."

- MEXICO CITY--The 
United States and Mexico 
doing their best to avert 
lee-or at least postpone until 
after their presidential dice-
tioes---a major public quar-
rel ovor the sensitive issue 
-of earcotics. 
Just last month, tempers 
:were running so high- that a 
?top Mexican narcotics . offi: 
vial indicated that several 
*U.S. agents were about to be? 
expelled from Mexico for 
-"insolent and inept behav-
ior" anti for "acting against 
our will and behind our 
backs.?. 
This dispute was' 
-:smoothed over at aa high-
level meeting in Washington 
*two weeks ago, when the at-
ttorneys *general of' the two 
-countries pledged coopera-
:tion and President Ford ? re-
-ceived the Mexican delegve 
-tion at the White Houk. 
Although both sides now 
'say publicly that their dif-
7ferenees are patched up, 
_sources close to the Mexican 
:anti-drug drive fear that se-
-rious problems still remain 
.and that new disagreements ? 
.are almost certain to arise.? 
? "There is a lot ?of pride 
-and rivalry on both sides of . 
the border," according to 
?one of these sources. 
? An official in the 'ideiiican 
:attorney general's office 
'asked, "How can we allow 
- 
American agents to ? act as 
police here, to arrest. Mexi-
cans, to carry arms when 
-they shouldn't, to make re 
;Connaissance flights on their

In public, American and 
?-Mexican officials stress the 
successes of their. six-year-
old joint campaign against 
the narcotics traffic from 
Mexico to the United Slates. 
But in practice, effective 
cooperation is increasingly 
hampered, by growing re-
.sentment and- rivalry be-
tween the' narcotics agents 
of the. two countries... ? 
, In exchange for the public 
embraces -Washington 
.earlier this month, the U.S. ? 
?Drug Enforcement Adminia - 
tration reportedly*. appeased 
-the Mexican delegation with. 
private assurances that con-
troversial U.S agents threat-
ened with expulsion would 
be replaced shortly.- There' 
were also reportedly Pledges 
of new U.S. equipment for 
the Mexican drug agents. . ? 
. In turn, Mexican federal* 
authorities dropped charges 
-against an American drug ? 
-agency "informant" being--
held for carrying out 
"illegal police actiyities" 
in-
Guadatalara, - instead; the 
man, Louis- Eisner,. was de-
ported to the United States 
two weeks ago. ? 
? According to a police re-
port, -Eisner had held at gun-
point two 'Mexicans he be-
lieved were related to drug 
traffic and planned to. hand 
them over to the authorities. 
The 'two Mexicans, accord-
ing to the report, succeeded 
in getting the attention of 
passing patrolmen, who de-
tamed Eisner. 
The report says Eisner, 
- who called himself a doctor,. 
confe:;-aetl ? that he had been 
doing undercover work ? in 
the Gua.'ala,lara area 'for al-
most- a year. ? Far that pur-
pose, the report says, he 
maintained contact with J;?i-
sePh Catoiale,,, the distriit 
director in GUadalajara for 
the hAl, &lig agency,' 
Ironically, much of the 
? 
growing rancor -stems from 
the reorganization .and new, 
?efficiency of the latest 'Alexi-
-can anti-drug ? drive, which 
was given strong political 
priority here last fall: 
? Under pressure from the 
'U.S. government and with,

. campaign to destroy thou-
sands of poppy fields by 
'spraying them from helleop-
,ters with herbicides. 
The. Mexican attorney. 
general's office, trained an 
entirely new and "clean" 
:narcotics squad, and- once 
into the campaign it set off 
..tremors among federal pa-
lice ranks by firing six cam-
tmanders, 13 ? agents and 
? three federal attorneys for 
confidence."*. 
As the new Mexican cam-
paign organizers .grew more 
confident and effective, they 
began to demand more con-
trol over the DEA activities 
on their territory. 
close to 30 DEA 
men are here to do liaison 
work with their Mexican 
- counterparts. They are per-
mitted CO carry guns .only 
when actually operating 
.with Mexican agents.

American Power and Foreign Policy 
The great debate on foreign policy 
this election year has focused almost 
entirely on the Soviet-American mili-
tary balance. Yet Americans will in-
creasingly face a new type of foreign 
policy issue: National security can be 
endangeree by events outside the tra-
ditional military sphere. 
. A melting of the Arctic ice cap be-
cause of a three-degree rise in the 
earth's temperature, depletion of the 
earth's ozone layer, theft of plutonium 
by terrorist groups, ill-fated experi-
ments with weather modification, 3 
prolonged world population explosion 
?all these could threaten our future 
as seriously as many occurrences that 
could arise in the traditional political-
military realm. 
Moreover, the debate over the al-
leged decline of American military 
power tells us little about our future 
ability to control these new issues. 
Power has always been an elusive 
concept in international affairs. Now 
-the nature of the resources that pro-
duce power capabilities has become 
. more complex, and the international 
power hierarchy more difficult to de-
termine. When a goad infantry was 
the crucial poi.ver resource, Europeen 
statesmen could calibrate the classical 
balance of power by counting the 
populations of conquered and trans-
ferred territories. The industrial revo-
lution complicated such calculations,. 
and nuclear weapons, as .a power re-
source too costly to use except in an 
extreme situation, further weakened 
the relationship between power meas-
ured in military resources and power 
in the sense of control over the out-
come, of events. 
This is not to say that military force 
has become obsolete, Quite the con-
trary. Military deterrence will remain 
a central concern of our foreign poi-
By Joseph S. Nye Jr. 
icy. But military force is difficult to 
apply to many of the new interde-
pendence issues on the agenda. 
The use of force is made more costly 
for major states by four conditions: 
risks of nuclear escalation, uncertain 
and possible negative effects on the 
achievement of economic goals, re-
sistance by nationalistic populations in 
otherwise weak states, domestic opin-
ion opposed to the human costs of the 
use of force. 
Even those 'states relatively unaf-
fected by the third and fourth condi-
tions, such as Communist countries, 
may feel some constraints from the 
first two. On the other hand, lesser 
states involved in regional rivalries, 
and terrorist groups, may find it easier 
to use force than before. The net ef-
fect of these contrary changes in the 
role of force is to reduce hierarchy 
based on military power. 
The erosion of the international 
hierarchy is sometimes portrayed as 
a decline of American power?as 
though the causes lay in our aging 
process. Admittedly, from the perspec-
tive of a policyrnaker of the 1950'.; 
there has been a decline. But American 
power in the sense of resources has 
not declined as dramatically as is 
often supposed. United States military 
spending was roughly a third of the 
world total in 1950, and after rising 
to slightly over half in the 1950's has 
returned to the earlier level. 
Over the same period, the American 
gross national product declined from 
-roughly a third to a quarter of the 
world total, but the earlier figure re? 
fleeted the wartime destruction of 
Europe and Japan, and the current. 
figure remains twice the size of that 
of the Soviet Union, three times that 
of Japan, and four times that of West 
Germany. 
To understand what is changing, we 
must distinguish power over others 
from power over Outcomes. What we 
are experiencing is not so Much an 
erosion of our power resources com-
pared to those of other countries (al-
though there has been some), but an 
erosion of our power to control out-
comes in the international system as 
a whole. 
The main reason is that the system 
itself has become more complex. There 
are more .issues, more actors, and less 
hierarchy. We still have leverage over 
others, but we have far less leverage 
over the whole system. 
Increased military spending will not 
be sufficient to solve this problem. In 
such a world, multilateral diplomacy, 
often through international institu-
tions will become more important be-
cause much of the agenda will be 
concerned with organizing collective 
action. 
Our foreign policy debate should pay 
more attention to the problem of 
organizing international leadership" 
where there is a tight interconnection 
between domestic and foreign policy, 
and we will need to think more imagi-
natively about the relations of our in-
stitutions to internatienal institutions.

Gloating is foolish. Poland's travail, in particular, is 
no boon for the West: Hard times mean Poland will 
shop less abroad and perhaps turn "east"?meaning 
tough and narrow?in its domestic policy. The West 
has no reason to wish communism well, but it does 
have a strong long-term economic and political inter-

can be separated from Moscow and drawn toward 
the Western mainstream, the better off the whole At-

of toughness?putting pressure on West Europe's 
Communists to prove they're not Soviet stooges?has 
paid off pretty well so far: Witness Moscow's discom-

from the West great- quantities of modern machinery that

t Russian adzation 
? ? 
rr HE ATTITUDE of the State Department toward 
J. the continuing and possibly harmful microwave 
- radiation that the Russians have been beaming at the 
U.S. Embassy in Moscow defies belief. One would 
think the department would have demanded long 
ago that this nerve-wracking threat to the health of 
Americans?its own employees, after all?be termi-
nated. But no. The radiation has gone on for years. In 
the months since it became public knowledge, the de-
. 'partment has pussyfooted inexcusably. The other 
-day, for instance, a department spokesman con-
tended that radiation at the present reduced level 
? ;poses "no cause for concern." He reported, however, 
that a $300,000?yes, $300,000?study had been com-
missioned of embassy medical records. A light slap on 
? the  Russians' wrist was delivered. Negotiations will 
'continue, it was declared. 
The radiation is, of course, not only a health hazard 
of uncertain dimensions but a-continuing affront to 
the national dignity of the United States. Why does 
the State Department take this double blow so mild-
ly? What is there to negotiate? Evidently the Rus-
,sians are directing the beams at American electronics

WASHINGTON, July 7?The

he level of microwave radia-

!Embassy in Moscow. .. 
But in its first detailed public 
ccount of the situation, the 
'State Department ;nonetheless 
"rebuked the Russians for con-
tinuing the . radiation even at 
the current insignificant level. 
-It said this showed "a lack of 
!concern for living and working 
;conditions of our people in 
;Moscow." 
; -Robert L. Funseth, the de-
Pertinent spokesman, said at . 
his regular news conference 
that 'as a result of official dis-
cussions "the strength of the 
signal beamed to the embassy 
".M Moscow has been greatly re-
duced from previous record; 
;ings, which were themselves 
equipment on or in the embassy building; diplomats 
and their families live on the lower floors. But the 
United States, or so it is contended without Soviet de-
nial, does not try to interfere with or counter Soviet 
electronics equipment on the Soviet embassy build-
ing in the same way here in Washington. Does the 
United States, which pokes its electronic beams all 
around the globe, fear that a strong protest against 
Russian radiation will elicit or legitimin other coun-
tries' protests against American radiation? If this is 
so, then it ought to be conceded directly, so that 
there can be a reasoned public discussion of the 
whole problem as it affects foreigners as well as 
Americans. 
Meanwhile, the physical and psychological well-
being of American personnel in Moscow deserve to 
be served by whatever measures are necessary for 
that purpose. In the absence of conclusive medical 
evidence to the contrary, it has to be assumed that 
the Russians are endangering the health, not to say 
the lives, of American citizens, and they should not 
be allowed to continue doing it. 
'well below established United 
:States safety standards." 
. According to Mr. Funseth, the 
/evel ?of radiation aimed at the 
!,embassy was now less than two 
microwatts per square centime-
ter. The installation of alumi-
)ium screens outside the embas-
sy earlier this year has further 
tut the level to less than one' 
anicrowatt, he said. 
The New York Times reported 
!Isn May 2 that the level late 
4ast year had gone as high as 
;8 microwatts. 
? American industrial safety 
"standards, Mr. Funseth said, 
p? ermit as much as 10,000 
'microwatts 'per square centime-
:ter; The Soviet Union's stricter 
-'indusbial standards ; permit 
ecualy 10 microwatts. 
s'; Mr. Funseth, while providing 
s 
steanical details, refused . to 
ieurnment on why the Soviet 
:Won was beatrung the rays, 
0 -practice that officials have 
began about 16 years ago. 
; viet officials have justified 
-tie beams as necessary to cur-
tall American electronic listen-
ling devices on the roof of upper. 
tioers of the ernbessy building, 
;situated on Tchaikovsky Street! 
:hadowntown Moscow. 
:American officials have pri-; 
inately conceded that these de-
'vices exist to monitor Soviet 
et'atilo and telephone trans?nis-
:siting, They have also said tint: 
monitoring effort was being' 
limpaired by the jamming( 
waves. 1 
What has irritated America:11 
;officials was that the Soviet 
{Embassy. on 16th Street in 
!downtown Washington also 
carries out similar interceptions 
of radio and phone conversa-
tions but has not been subject 
to the countermeasures because 
of concern for Americans work-
ing in the area. 
The beaming of radiation 
against the embassy in Moscow 
was known only to a few, 
American officials until last 
February when Ambassador 
Walter J. Stoessel Jr. briefed 
his staff on the situation. News 
of the briefing Was leaked to 
the press. 
The briefing was held because 
State Department medical offi-
cers Jeered that the radiation 
might post a health hazard over 
the long run, either to the eyes 
or to the genetic or nervous 
system. 
!Officials have stressed that 
there was as yet no evidence 
that the microwaves had been 
responsible for any illnesses, 
past or present. 
! Microwaves are unlike X-rays t 
and are net ionized. X-rays in' 
excessive amounts can cause 
!cancer, but no connection has 
been made between mi-
crowaves and cancer. 
; The decision to release infor-

Mr. Fun.sten said the discus-

aimed at ending the microwave

"Frankly, we regret that the 
Soviets have failed to turn off 
the transmissions completely, 
and thereby, in our judgment,

He also said no concessions 
were made to the Russians in

said to come from across the

are said to be ;two such beams

NATO's Tragic Confrontation 
A Turkish government vessel"' 
equipped with new seismic devices for 
underwater oil exploration is about to 
leave its berth near 'Istanbul for "re-
search" in northern Aegean waters 
claimed ? by Greece?a disaster-prone 
vcyage that dramatizes the tragic dec-
line of the Western Alliance. 
Passage of this ship, recently rechris-
tened Sim-lie, will add another bitter 
chapter in the hostility between Athens 
and Ankara once the Unified center of 
NATO's eastern flank. Far worse, pre-
cautionary measures being taken by 
both sides against possible Greek inter-
ferente with the ship point to a real. 
threat of shooting inside the disputed 
waters.. 
- Thus; the Sisrnic's scheduled sailing 
?deiayed s.everal weeks partly because 
of Washington's ardent persuasion?is 
now to coincide with Aegean Sea naval 
' exercises planned by both Greece and ? 
Turkey. The Aegean Sea, with massed 
Greek islands stretching close along-
side the Turkish coast, will then be a le-
thal cockpit. 
This dangerous confrontation poses 
further risks to the diminished .integ-
rity of Western defenses against the So-
viet Union, the new power in the east-. 
ern Mediterranean. Nevertheless, the 
U.S. is virtually powerless to do any-
thing but counsel delay in the ship's. 
sailing. The remote possibility that the 
Sismic could indeed trigger a shooting 
war between Greece and Turkey finds 
Washington fully as impotent as it has 
been for 15 months of Lebanon's tragic 
civil war.

Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey

The pending Turk-Greek confronta-
tion would come in Aegean Sea waters 
claimed by both countries in One of .the 
world's most bitter disputes over terri-
torial waters today. Greece, claiming 
that its close-to:Turkey. islands have 
their own continental shelf, has threat-
ened to blow up Turkish ships seeking 
underwater oil there. ? 
Turkey. which perceives the fabled ? 
Greek Isles as "floating" islands with no 
continental shelf of their own, claims 
the disputed waters lie over the Turk-
ish continental shelf, to which Turkey 
has sovereign rights. 
Behind Ankara's decision to chal-
lenge Greek claims in the Aegean Sea. 
lies an ever-worsening dispute with the 
U.S. It began with the 1974 Turkish in-
vasion of Cyprus in reaction to the at-
tempted takeover there by the then 
Greek military dictatorship. Ever since, 
the Ford administration has been 
pleading with the Democratic Congress 
?most receptive to the Greek lobby?
to lift the arms embargo and thus end 
one-sided punishment of Turkey. 
That effort now turns en the fate in 
Congress of the four-year, $1. billion 
U.S.-Turkish aid agreement signed 
March 26. The agreement would re-
store U.S. rights to intelligence bases, 
aimed at the Soviet Union, that Turkey 
closed last July: 
The Turkish government has been in-
formed by the administration that Con-
. gress will approve the agreement this

He added that the admin-
istration had dipped into the 
NATO reserve to obtain 
tanks and other armored 
'vehicles :to sell to foreign 
nations. The reserve was 
"substantially reduced be-
le mni 1973 and l75" and 
ims not heen restored. Hum-

chance of that. 
Democrats want to wait for a new 
- Democratic administration; Republi-_ 
cans perceive political misery in voting 
for Turkey just before the election. 
That the $1 billion agreement now 
seems dead for this year is extremely 
hard for the Turkish government to 
swallow. Contradicting the honeyed 
talk in Washington when the agree-
ment was signed, this means _Turkey's 
eligibility to buy U.S. arms is limited to 
only $125 million in each of the next 
two years. 
The resulting sense of betrayal now 
becoming manifest is likely to make 
Turkey even more adventurous in con-
fronting Greece over the Aegean Sea. 
Unable to see progress in its bitter 
struggle with Washington, Ankara is 
not held back by U.S. admonitions. 
When the Greek government pri-
vately urged the U.S. and NATO to dis-
suade Turkey from using the Sismic in 
disputed waters, it stated flatly the ship 
"will be sunk" if it shows up. U.S. per-
suasion delayed the Sismic's departure 
for two weeks, but it is now expected to 
sail in mid-July. 
Some diplomats here believe the sail-
ing will trigger not torpedoes but only 
a dangerous game of chicken. Realists 
disagree. 
"The hotheads on both sides are 
spoiling for a fight," one diplomat told' 
us. "And if it starts in the Aegean it 
could spread overnight to the border in

West German intelligence agencies: 
how coordinated? 
By David 3Intch 
? Staff correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Bonn 
It can be argued Guenther Guillaume; the East German spy, 
? whose arrest led to Chancellor Willy Brandt's resignation, did 
? one big favor for West Germany. 
The political stir caused by Mr. Guillaume's penetration of 
? the Brandt chancellery made it?possible to strengthen and 
coordinate the control over the government's three in-
telligence agencies. 
' "The great change that was needed was more coordina-
tion," said Manfred Schueler, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's 
right-band man in the chancellery, "and the post-Gienaurne 
climate enabled us to make that change." 
? The problem of controlling intelligence agencies is different 
in West Germany than it is in the United States. There are 
? several reasons why. . 
One is That the government here is in effect a "committee" 
of Parliament, whereas in the U.S. administration and Con-
gress are separated formally by the Constitution. 
This tends to make investigations by Congress tougher than 
are parliamentary investigations here. 
Another reason is that the most prominent problems here 
for the intelligence agencies are spying and terrorism, 
whereas in the U.S. the most prominent problem has been po-
litical. 
And West Germany as a "middle power" does not put the 
same resources into intelligence gathering as must the U.S. as 
a super power.

Indications are that the United States has been covertly 
intervening in the Italian political process during these 
past weeks and months, as the official American attitude 
toward possible Communist gains in the current elections 
there has approached hysteria. The position .of the ad-
ministration toward the political crisis in Italy, demon-
strates the difficulty of breaking our old habits of arro-
gance about the democratic processes of other nations. 
The corruption of postwar Italian politics by American 
official and nonofficial institutions has been pervasive. 
We now know that the great multinational corporations, 
most of them American, have made substantial puments 
to Italian politicians and parties. Lockheed's largesse

top intelligence man under Hitler who later found favor with 
the U.S. Army. And his post-war intelligence work was made 
? official by a Cabinet decree by Chancellor Conrad Adenauer in 
1955. Mr. Gehlen retired in 1968. - 
During the Guillaume investigation in 1974 it was found that 
the BND had built unauthorized files on people in West Ger-
many, including some journalists. 
Never set up under law, the BNB continues to exist by goy-
? sernment decree. But there is a measure of consensus That with 
new leadership and other control measures, the agency is in 
band. 
Another key intelligence agency is the Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution, comparable to the FBI. It 
watches over internal security, and it has a good record of de-
tecting and apprehending spies and of finding wanted terror-
ists. 
Gentleman's agreement ? . ? 
? Then there is an intelligence agency for the military. The 
control over these last two agencies exist both in, Parliament 
and in the chancellery. These two agencies report to a differ-
ent committee in Parliament. They are coordinated through.. 
two government ministries. 
Parliament's main control arm is what can loosely be trans-
lated as a board of trustees. This exists under a gentleman's 
agreement between the chancellery and Parliament. 
It consists of members from all parties in Parliament, 
meets regularly, and can question activities. Birt it has no le-
gal basis to "demand" answers. 
The Chancellery has perhaps the key watchdog function ? it 
must coordinate all three agencies. 
It was lack of coordination that permitted Mr. Guillaume to 
rise so high, since there were files on him and suspicions about 
him for years. But no one put it all together until after he had 
reached the chancellery. 
In 1974 Mr. Schueler, on orders from Mr. Schmidt, increased 
from 6 to 20 the chancellery's "intelligence watchdogs" and 
sought to make sure jealousies and rivalries between the agen-
cies do not supercede security needs. This was the "great 
change" Mr. Sclueler said was necessary. 
A great deal of mutual trust goes into the West German sys-
tem of managing the intelligence agencies. The Guillaume af-
fair di?not politicize the question as much as Watergate did in 
the U.S. ? 
A parliamentary committee on constitutional reform may 
make recommendations to formalize some present relation-

Was bribed to further the sale of fourteen Hercules

Premie-r in that period are now President, Premier and

as Lockheed called him, will necessarily have a major 
ifripact on the Italian Government. In addition, Exxon

that the British Government owns 70 per cent of B.P. 
' stock has been of some embarrassment in London);

official U.S. dollars to the same parties. According to the 
final report of the House Select. Committee- on 'Intelli-
gence, the agency gave $75 million to Italian parties 
and politicians between 1948 and .1972. Of this sum, 
$10 million was spent in the 1972 parliamentary elections. 
.The evidence is thar4ain. in 1976 OA .moneys helped 
finance the campaigns of anti-Communist candidates and 
parties. Indeed, The New York Times reported in January 
that on December. 8, 1975, President Ford approved a 
$6 million CIA expenditure for anticipated Italian 
elections. 
? 
This latest CIA installment in Italy, must be. seen ; 
in the context of official U.S. reaCtion to?Italian develop-1 
merits. Ever since. Harry Truman decided it necessary 
to "scare hell out of the. American people" to get public 
support for aid to Greece and Turkey after World War 
public hysteria by Secretaries of State has become. a - 
routine feature of the . foreign policy process. ? The in-
cumbent Secretary of Stan:I:is no exception. The prospect 
of Communist participation in the Italian Government 
has trignered Kissinger's world-historical pessimism about:. 
the struggle between Western civilization and Communist: 
"barbarism." At a London convocation of our nrnbast 
sadots to Europe last December (a few days after 
Preeident Ford approved the $6 million) Kissinger defined 
the issue as a threat to our values rather than our 
tangible, economic and strategic interests: 
The Western alliance has always had an importance 
beyond military solidarity. The 'United States would be 
alone: and isolated in a world in which we had no rela-
tions by values to other countries. 
If the, United States were to become an "island in its 
own values," he felt we "could probably survive this ? 
situation, but only through the use of a ruthless balance 
of power policy." .Such n policy would, presumably re-
place the benign search for world order that has pre-
vailed under Mr. Kissinger's leadership. The process by 
which the United States could become an island of virtue 
is a strikingly familiar one. Mr. Kissinger went on to say: 
? I believe that the advent, of communism in major 
European countries is likely to produce a sequence. of 
events in which other European countries will also be 
tempted to move 'in the same direction. 
In other words, United States policy is guided by a 
belief in the moral superiority of American values and 
the conviction that our allies will fall like dominoes if 
the Italian Communist Party participates in the next 
Italian Cabinet. The formula for American foreign policy 
? remains the, time-honored cold-war response: scare hell 
out of the American people and use theCIA to give 
our friends a secret advantage. . 
The administration's response to The New York 
Tirne.s's revelation of the authorized $6 million covert 
action money was to deny the story while attacking 
Congress for leaking it. Director Colby said the CIA 
had "not spent a nickel in Italy" in that period and 
the. White House issued a soeerreent that the President 
was "angry" and that the leak "undermines our 'capability 
to carry out our foreign policy," Colby's denial was true 
only because the director's contingency fund from which 
the expenditure was to be drawn had been emptied by 
the Angola operation, and the agency had a temporary 
cash flow problem. Presurnalily the $6 million--nod in 
all likelihood more?has been spent since January. 
Nor has the private %,:ctor been inactive in this Italian 
election. In May, immethitely after the Italian parlia-
ment was dissolved, John Coanally of Texas founded 
? AMBOILial 
a group called ? the. "Citizens Alliance for Mediterranean 
Freedom" to "raise ? American consciousness .about the 
? deteriorating situation in 'southern Europe, the iMiddle 
East, and northern Africa," and to Warn. the Italians 
"not to 'become beguiled by the unfulfilled promises of 
communism." The, group has been funded out of money 
'raised by a "Texas Salute to John Connally" 'dinner, 
held last stimmer to celebrate his acquittal on charges 
of bribery. The organization is hoping to alert the public 
in both the United. States and Italy to the dire con-
sequences of the "loss of Italy," and "encourage :the 
peoples of the Mediterranean nations in their efforts to 
. preserve their freedom." Connally concedes that this 
"probably is meddling" in another country's internal af-
fairs but, he says., "I don't think we should be criticized 
for doing just that. We meddled in them [sic) thirty years 
t ago." The Connally. group bar a like concern for the 
"future of freedom:" in Spain, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, 
Lebanon, Egypt, Israel and Libya. 
It is impossible to know whether, or in what degree, 
the Connally organization and its activities have been 
coordinated with US. foreign policy or intelligence of-
ficials. Connally, -however, is a member of the President's 
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a body of private 
citizens that is supposed 'togive the-President indepenad-
ent, objective advice about .foreign intelligence opera-
tions. Connally says be sees to confliet between his 
PFIAB job and his pedtiti6it as chairman of the "Citizens 
Alliance"; but, especially since President Ford's reorgani-
zation in February of the intelligence agencies assigned 
to PFIAB a new and peesumably more powerful responsi-
bility to _keep the agencies in line, it is clearly improper 
and alarming that Connally shrin.d sponsor private inter-
vention in Italian domestic politics and endorse "med-
dling" as a proper course for Americans. 
It is ironic that, during our Bicentennial celebration, 
and during a Presidential election of our, own, this coun-
try should once again interfere With the free democratic 
processes of a friendly country. It calls to mind the 
Vietnamese village, of Bentre, which the U.S. Army 
found it had to destroy in order to save'. We- cannot 
save Italian democracy by destroying it, and nothinn is 
. more destructive to: democrady than secret corruption_ 
Also, we. cannot preserve or promote our political system 
and its values by denying them. The essence of the 
democratic process is that the people, through free 
exercise of the vote, can turn out the. top political 
leadership, and that such leadership will keep faith with 
the people, by going quietly, in the hope of renaininn the 
voters' confidence. As Woodrow Wilson observed, non-
intervention in the internal ffairs .of other countries is a 
corollary of democracy. The two are inseparable in theory 
and in practice. . 
Nowhere is this more evident than in Italy where 
much of the difficulty in which the Christian Democatic 
Party finds itself stems from widespread evidence of its 
corruption. 'We contribute little to the revitalization of 
non-Communist forces in Italy when we contribute no 
corruption by CIA clandestine support or by tolerating 
American corporate bribery of foreign officials. As one 
self-described "dyed-in-the-wool pro-American" Christian 
Democratic politician pit it after The New York Times 
revelations in January. "If been planning a trip to 
the United States, t would cancel it for fear people 
would think 1 was just another 'bought' politician." 
To me it seem,: elementary that tile best way to support 
denim:racy in Italy is to bust it. if iett,wing or right-
wing groups do attempt the dismantlement of demo:retie 
institutions there, we will be in no position to objeto

? The size of the Communist win can 
. best be gauged by measuring it against 
the celebrated comeback of the Chris-
tian Democrats. With 38.7 per cent of 
the vote for parliament, the Demo-
ChaistianS made a gain of 32 per cent 
over the regional elections last Year, 
while standing just where they were in 
the 1972 legislative elections. 
? 'In contrast, the Communists, with 
34.4 per cent of the vote, registered a 
gain of 2.5 per cent over the 1975 elec-
tions, and 7.3 per cent over the 1272 eh

tions. 
They gained 48 seats in the National 
Assembly, as against a loss of ? one by 
the Demo-Christians. They, added to 
their fiefdoms large areas south of 
Rome which they had never held be-
fore. Around Naples, for instance, they. 
won 41 per cent of the vote as against 
28 per cent in 1972. ? 
Of course, the Demo-Christians, as 
the largest party, will take the lead in 
farming a government?probably with-
out the Communists, but with the Sca 
ciannts and three smaller parties. The 
-Socialists will not joinehowever, unless; 
there is first a dialegue with the Cora-
menists and agreement on a program 
of urgent action. 
The Communists are in excellent pos-
ture for such a dialogue. In the. past 
few years, under General Secretary En; 
rico Berlinguer, they have junked a 
load of ideological baggage, and come 
across as the defenders the Italian 
lower middle class, which is the majori-
ty, not of the proletariat which is a 
small minority. ? 
Their plans for urgent action center 
around a program for arresting infla-
tion. They would limit the government 
deficit by putting a ceiling on govern-
ment spending. They would. cut beth 
jobs and payments in government pro-
grams and enterprises (many of them 
now Demo-Christian fiefs) the better to. 
acquire money for investment in agri-
culture, housing and transport. 
That is plainly an appealing and sen-
sible program. If the Demo-Christiann 
accept it, the Communists will almost ? 
surely enter power to help in the exte? 
cution. If it is refused, the Communists 
will he in position to win the next elec-
tion. 
Put whit about the U.S. and its allies 
who have fought the Italian Cointraut- ? 
ists so herd for foreign policy reasons? 
Well, there is a tenipoiary breathing 
space after the election?which Is a 
piece of luck. - 
For the Italian Communists have 
come more than halfway toward the ac-
cepted canons of the West. They have 
shown a willingness to abide by demo-
cratic rules. They have turned their 
backs on expropriation of property. 
They have criticized Soviet domina-
tion in Eastern Europe and. the Com-
munist effort to take over Portugal. 
Until assured last week that their prin. 
? ciples of independence would not be 
compromised, they resisted Russia's 
call for an International meeting of

But clearly the present breathing

ing the automatic NATO hostility to-

tect an Italian party which can foster a 
kind of Euro-communisra that is as spilt 
off from Moscow as Chinese commun-
ism.

tplortiat9 s Death Cloaked in Secrecy 
Britons Question Whether Iranian Ambassador Committed Suicide 
By Bernard D Nossiter 
It'ash:,15ton Po t Foreign Seryiee 
LONDON-04 -the night 
of June 4, an Iranian diplo-
. mat ?noticed that the lights 
were on in the Kensington 
home of Mohammed Reza 
Amirteymour the newly re- - 
called ambaSsadore 
Since Amirteyritour- had 
said lie was going -away for 
the weekend, perhaps his 
last in England, the puzzled 
diplomat rang the doorbell. 
There was no reply. The dip-
lomat went around to the 
back, peered through a kit 
-
ellen window and saw two 
feet. ? 
Ile called the policeman 
on duty at the embassy near-
by, and the officer forced 
open the kitchen window. 
On the floor, staring lite- ? 
lessly at the ceiling, was the 
body of the 53-year-old Amir-
teymour. 
The embassy's first sccre- ? 
tary, Mortez Kakhi, told re-
porters the next day: ,.? 
"Ile died from thatural 
causes. The doctbr ' who ex-
amined him and the police 
are also satisfied."?  , 
This was untrue. t. 
. British and Iranian authori-
ties have now disclosed that 
?Ambassador Amirteymour 
took his own life. A note in 
Persian is said to have ? been 
found by the dead man's 
body, addressed to his 
daughter and. begging her ? 
forgiveness, e 
In the weeks that have 
passed, however, at least 
some hitclligence sources 
here are not Wholly con-

was a suicide. The fact that

post-mortem has left a cloud Shah Mohammed Reza t 
of suspicion.;. Pahlevi or the empress. 
An extraerdinary veil of ' "I would rule out any pos-
secrecy has been cast over 
the whole affair. The British 
look on Iran as a multibil-
lion-dollar customer for 
everything from arms to 
new towns, from Concordes 
to machine tools. London 
does not want to cross Teh-
ran for the soundest of com-
mercial reasons. ? 
First Secretary Kalthi's 
false statement has not in-
creased confidence in the 
handling of enc., ease. The 
new ambassador, Parviz 
Cambran Radji, who arrived 
the very day Amirtcyrnour 
died, said in an interview 
that he has rebuked Kakhi 
for his tale-telling. ? 
? Why should Amirteymour, 
a distinguished diplomat 
who had represented lran in 
Moscow before coming to 
London,. commit suicide on 
the eve of his recall? 
Several sources suggested 
that he feared he was going 
home to disgrace. He is said 
to have been, in the words 
of one well-placed aide, "a 
compulsive gambler" who 
had run up debts of perhaps 
$175,n00 In the clubs here. - 
In addition, Amirteymour 
Is thought to have offended 
Empress Farah' when she 
came here In April to open 
the World. of Islam festival. 
The precise nature of the of-
fense is not known, but she 
Is said to have been disturb-
ed by his arrangements. 
Radji, the new ambassador, 
will talk only of "rumors' to 
explain Amirteymour's pos-
sin:0 "disgrace." But he denies 
? that his predecessor. had got-
teaninto- the bad books of 
sibility of a political reason" 
? or "his majasty's displeasure," 
Radji said, "because I know 
. it would not be true," ? 
? There iS no doubt Radji, 
t whose posting here began with . 
%the tragedy, is well enough 
' connected to keow the shah's 
mind. Ile has the prized Lon-
-don embassy at the tender age 
of 40 and previously lie had 
been key adviser to Premier 
Amir Abbas Hoveydn. Radii 
said he had an interview with 
? the empress jiist before .he 
left. 
:Oh the British side, only 
the policeman on duty at the 
embassy, the police surgeon 
,  
he called, who ?certified the 
. death, and an officer from the 
coroner's office appear to 
. have looked .at -the ? corpse. 
, Scotland Yard has been order-
ed to tell the:" press as little 
as possible and stress that the 
Criminal Investigation Divi-
- sion was not called in. ? . 
The CID, ? however, could 
not be called in once dipice:-
matic immunity was claimed. 
Radji made the claim as 
soon as the coroner's man 
suggested an .autopay.. . 
Radji, who was summoned 
to see the body on the fatal 
night, said that -there was no. ? 
? blood or sign Of struggle, and 
that the only evidence of pills 
was a bottle of antibiotic- rape 
how, the putativc. 
suicide killed himself remains 
a mystery. 
Why did Radji claim dip-
, lomatic immunity, thereby 
.preventing any determination 
of death? . ? 
- He did it, he said, out of 
'consideration for his collea-
gue's ? ? ? 
According to the ambassa-
dor, a cable was sent to the 
Foreign Ministry in Tehran, 
which queried the dead man's 
aged ? Intim'. The' ministry 
cabled Radii that the father 
had refuSed permission for 
an autopsy and asked that the 
corpse be seat home, the am-
bassador said. 
Even if Amirteymour had re-
turned alive, his future was 
uncertain. Ambassador Radji 
said that his eminent prede-
cessor did not have a new 
assigment at the time he died. 
The ? many question marks 
around this- affair have led 
some intelligence officials 
here to think that the dread-
ed SAVAK, or state security 
and intelligence organiza-
tion, had a hind in it. 
SAVAK agents operate-from 
the embassy in London, as 
the Sunday Times disclosed 
two years ago. , ? 
This is hardly surprising, 
since SAVAK was reorganized 
and trained by the CIA nearly 
20 years ago,- and the CIA 
invariably has sizable station 
complements at major em-
bassies. 
If Amirteymour was marked 
for death, why was he killed 
in London, on the eve of his 
return? Would it not have 
been easier to dispose of him 
ill Tehran? Ills death there, 
how-ever, might have aroused 
unpleasant talk. At any rale, 
he does seem to have died en 
Iranian soil, his Kensington 
house, which is diplomatic-
ally immune from the in-
quiries of a coronet- or

from Washington on the Syrian govern-
ment to let the airport (dosed by Syrian 
troops) open for the evacuation. 
Having then opened the airport on 
behalf of fleeing Americans, the PLO 
believed that the Syrians would not 
dare close it to medical supplies desper-
ately needed by hundreds of gravely. 
? wounded Palestinian Arabs. 
This plan required the U.S. to brush 
aside major contradictions. Even 
though the British and the French had 
sent land convoys safely to Damascus 
on the four days immediately preced-
ing the planned June 20 American exo-
dus, the PLO quietly notified the Bri-
tish embassy in Beirut to inform the U. 
S. that the route had suddenly become 
? unsafe. Yet, on that very day, June 20, 
non-Arab civilians made their way with 
utter safety through the war-littered 
? region surrounding Beirut, up the 
mountain passes and into Damascus. 
Thus, the White House reacted with 
Immediate suspicion to this PLO play 
for U.S. pressure on Syria for air, evacu-
ation. Even before the land-route op-
tion was closed off, President Ford had 
been criticized for using the evacuation 
to promote himself as presidential cri-
sis-manager on the eve of the impor-
tant Iowa Republican state convention. 
Such criticism was deepened by the 
WASHINGTON STAR 
2 7 JUN 1976 1 
PLO 
THE NEW IMAGE 
By Jeremiah O'Leary . 
Washington Star Staff Writer. 
It has become a fact of life in the 
Middle East arena that the Palestine 
Liberation Organization has gained 
acceptance and status with the 
United States that is normally ac-
corded only to nation-states. ? 
. "What else would you say about 
the PLO after it joined forces with 
the American Navy to stage an am-
phibious and military operation such 
as the evacuation of foreign refugees 
across the beach in Lebanon last 
week?" asked a knowledgeable U.S. 
official. "We don't recognize the PLO 
de jure but we sure as hell have de 
facto dealings with it." 
Its new standing, another Amen- ? 
can policy-makertsaid, is generally. - 
parallel to what the Israelis did in 
their war for independence and inter-
national recognition that ended in 
"?The Israelis made themselves 
a fact and a reality that could not be - 
ignored when they fought six Arab 
nations, won their battle and finally, 
were admitted to the United Na-
tions," he said. "Before that, the 
? Israelis were ? as the PLO is today 
? a collection of armed guerrillas 
like the Paimach, the Irgun Zvai 
Leumi and the Stern Gang and not a 
nation at all." 
, . 
, U.S. OFFICIALS, who did not wish 
to be identified, say the relatively 
new role of the PLO as a moderate - 
? force compared with the splinter 
?rejectionist-front Palestinian groups . 
almost certainly carries with it a 
quid pro quo for the United States. 
. "Let's face it,' said tine informed 
.official,.!.?tney.are.actin responsiWy., , 
all-night White House meetings to find 
a new evacuation route (just after the 
overland evacuation of British and 
French nationals had worked without 
any trouble). Angered though they 
were by the PLO's sudden warning, Mr. 
Ford and his top military advisers 
could not prove the PLO was wrong 
and dared not risk finding out. 
So, to avoid playing the obvious PLO 
game and taking to the air, Mr. Ford or-
dered evacuation by sea. Washington 
was determined to force the issue with 
the PLO, privately sending word 
through foreign embassies that a U.S. 
Marine assault battalion would be put 
on the ground in Lebanon if needed to 
safeguard the short land route from 
Beirut's Riviera Hotel to the docks. 
Only then, threatened with U.S. 
force, did the embattled PLO admit it 
had lost the game to impose its will on 
Washington's crisis diplomacy. With 
the admission came fast and complete 
cooperation. 
' What is so disturbing about this sequ-
ence of events is its lessons for wider U. 
SI interests in the Middle East, as well 
as the immediate future course of this 
nation's diplomacy in Lebanon. The 
truth is that Washington has now be-
come spectator to passions unleashed 
by the Mideast's bloodiest civil war in 
and cooperatively with the U.S. in the 
Lebanese chaos and this is a bill that 
will come due and will have to be 
paid." 
Exactly what price tag the PLO 
has put on its services is one of Wash-
ington's most closely held secrets. 
The price that seems most likely is 
some form of official U.S. recognition 
that the PLO exists. Further, it ap-
pears possible that Secretary of State 
Henry A. Kissinger or his successor 
will adopt the policy that the PLO 
merits a place at any Middle East 
peace conference. 
If all this seems unreal, coming a 
relatively short time after PLO lead-
er Yassir Arafat appeared at the 
United Nations wearing a pistol hol-
ster and after years of American 
refusal to deal with the PLO on any 
terms, it is undeniable that the PLO 
- is reaching a crossroads in its rela-
tions with the United States. In the 
iew of many, the PLO has 
come closer than any other 
entity to organized and 
responsible conduct in strife-
torn Lebanon.. 
OFFICIAL pronounce-
anents from officials from 
TPresident Ford and Kissin-
her on down continue the 
_fiction that Washington has 
no dealings with the largest 
group of Palestinians, the 
.PLO. While it may be true 
that there are no direct 
dealings, there are indirect 
dealings aplenty. Kissinger 
has said that the evacuation 
'last weekend, something 
less than a dramatic affair 
as it turned out. was .11,7-
ranged with the PLO 
31 thraugh third-party inter-
generations. 
The U.S. has been unable even to tell 
the truth publicly about its private sup-
port for Syria's intervention in that 
civil war (first to help the PLO, then to 
save the beleaguered Christian Arab 
minority). Nor has the U.S. been able to 
impede the breakup of Arab unity, par-
ticularly between Syria and Egypt, that 
followed the second-stage Israeli with-
drawal from Sinai and severely threat-
ens Mideast settlement prospects. 
Some experts here trace the tragedy 
of Lebanon's civil war directly back to 
U.S. refusal to insist that Israel start 
long-overdue negotiations with the Pal-
estinians?or with Jordan?over the 1s:
west bank of the Jordar 
River two years ago. Instead the U.S. al-
lowed Israel to make a second-stage 
Sinai withdrawal agreement with ? 
Egypt, leaving the Palestinian prob-
lems both on the west bank and in Le-
banon ripe for exploding. 
Washington's inability 10 days ago to 
arrange a simple evacuation of its own 
citizens without being sandbagged by 
the relatively puny PLO is stark testi-
mony to the truth. As of today, the U. S.

The whole Lebanese civil 
war, in several other ways, 
has represented a foreign 
policy disaster for thefl Sovi-
et Union and a triumph for 
the U.S-Israeli allies even if 
the causes of the interne-
cine strife were self-gener-
ated within hapless 
Lebanon with no instigation 
from Washington or Jerusa-
lem. 
AMERICAN diplomats 
-are quick to point out that 
almost every Soviet initia-
tive in the Middle East in 
the past two Arab-Israeli 
wars has been an expensive 
debacle for Moscow. They 
paint a picture of Moscow's 
clients raining Russian 
weaponry on one another, 
their fellow Arabs, and 
paying little heed to the 
Soviet presence on their 
side except to draw up new 
shopping lists for arms. 
It may be no wonder, 
then, that the PLO may be 
casting around for a better 
relationship with the United 
States in the hope that 
Washington may be able to 
itself ender the mutual security 
tpact between the two. govern-
ments. 
The sale of the electronic air-
defense equipment comes at a 
time when the United States 
is gradually phasing out its 
own military presence on Tai-
wan, consistent with commit-
ments made to the Peking 
Government in the Shanghai 
Communiqu?f February 1972. 
Last week the State Depart-
ment said that the last Ameri-
can military advisers on Matsu 
and Quemoy, the Nationalist-
held islands off the China 
mainland, had been withdrawn. 
There had been one officer 
and two enlisted men on each 
island. 
A department official said 
that at the moment about 2,100 
American military men were 
still on Taiwan, most of them 
doing communications and in-
telligence work. Of that num-
ber, about 60 were assigned to 
the Military Assistance Group. 
Political ALpect Stressed 
The possible sale of 1-100's 
to Syria and Iraq was viewed 
by State Department officials 
as more politically than miii-
tarily significant. 
Both Middle Eastern min.: 
tries have relied. almost exclu-
sively on the Soviet Union for 
their aircraft, but recently the 
Syrians have been seeking to 
expand their contacts with 
Western countries. 
The United States recently 
praised the Syrians for theirl 
efforts to bring at nut a ha tH 
? anced political solution in Ieb-, 
anon and has begun a modesti 
? 
get for them by negotiation 
the homeland that they 
have never been able to win 
with Soviet arms. 
Some U.S. policy makers 
believe the Israelis see the 
diaphanous American-PLO 
connection growing more 
substantial and more work-
able. The Israelis are 
understandably suspicious, 
alarmed and wary, but Is-
rael is in a weak position to 
defy its only important sup-
porter. If the PLO and the 
United States find that they 
can work together over the 
long haul, no one in the 
State Department would be 
surprised if this administra-
tion or the next one comes 
forth with an offer Israel 
cannot afford to refuse. 
Should this relationship 
prosper, the assessment is 
that one day Washington 
can propose that the PLO 
be represented at the Gene-
va peace conference, along 
with Syria, Egypt, Jordan 
and the Soviet Union, or 
some other negotiating 
forum. This could happen

the mid-1960's as the civilian

a heavy transport with four

KINSHASA?One winter 
morning a European resi?
dent of Kinshasd awoke to 
find his Zairean cook jump- . 
mg up and down with joy. 
"The president is through 
?there's been . a. , coup ? 
d'etat," the servant exulted, 
. will havea

The . servant proved ; 
wrong. The Shots he heard . 
and took for, a revolution in .; 
fact were fired 'by troops 
searching for common crimi-
.. nes who had escaped from . 
a Kinshasa prison. . 2 
But his. reaction Within 
the privacy- of his employ-. 
er's house?and the average 
citizen's indifference in pub-
lic?typified a mood. ? 
More than 10 years after 
he seized power?much to 
the relief of his fellow-citi-
zens, who were sickened by-
the former Belgian Congo's 
first years of almost-constant 
civil war?President Mobutu 
Sese Seko is an' increasingly 
lonely and discredited figure. 
. His strongest card is his. 
t. lingering reputation as the 
man who ended the chaos. of; 
those early years of irides 
pendence. 
A common attitude is that 
summed up . by, a disen-
chanted, if resigned, taxi 
. driver who said: "We might 
. as well keep him because 
the next man almost 'cer-
tainly won't be any better?' 
- 
That, too, seems a view 
a shared by the Ford-
tration, which appears to 
Shore up an old ally who 
recently returned to the fold 
after disastrous radical eco-
- nomic measures, apparently'

In a speech in May. Alo-
butu. wept .e long way 
eieavz 
ward confessing to the coun-
try's gradual, but unmistaka-
ble decline since independ-
..ence in 1960. . 
"Let's make an effort- to 
get away from the mentality 
that we used to have during-
the colonial period," he ex-
horted his fellow-citizens. 
-"We are an independent pet); 
pie. Forget aboutthe golden 
days that you used to have 
during the Belgian presence 
here." ' 
Zaireans cannot 'he 
blamed for indulging in nos-
talgic ? selective memory. 
Once the' must prosperous 
colony in black Africa, the 
country has now gone back 
to a subsistence economy in 
many regions. 
Mobutu completed the. ef-
fect of natural neglect by 
forcing out the- Greek, Por-
tuguese and Pakistani trad-
ers who kept the Wish Mar-, 
keting and distribution sYs-
tern functioning. 
Farmers no longer can get 
their produce to market over 
, washed-out roads and are no , 
longer able to buy text-
iles, kerosene, and other 
? staples. Farmers have either 
stopped planting for want of 
.incentives or have taken to 
smuggling . their produce, 
abroad. Coffee,. tea, gold and: 
diamonds are among Zaire's 
. riches that nave -show up as 
.exp arts for- neighboring 
countries: - 
? The telephone service in. 
Kinshasa has become so pre-
carious. . that the govern-
ment's inner circle commu-?

walkie-talkie, . the -ultimate 
status symbol. Private firms'

gram and telex as the ? only

in a country- as large. as the 
United States past oi ? the 
. ? 
Mobutu has-taken to 
blaming ?others for his ? trou-
bles. The civil ' service .has 
undoubtedly undergone a 
? 
steady erosion. "In what 
? 
ere 
other country in the world 
'have you seen the whole 
. population in business,'! he 
complained. "Some work for. 
the government and . still - 
run a shop and don't pay 
taxes." , ? 
"Everybody . saying 
prices have gone up. What is 
Motubu doing? The roads 
arc in bad shape. What's 
Motubu doing? Not -enough 
buses in town? Don't look at 
.Mobutu because Mobutu is 
working 24 hones a day," he 
said. 
So difficult has it become : 
for average Zaireans to 
make ends meet?inflation 
is running well over 30 per 
cent annually and Mobutu 
himself admits that 90 per 
cent , of . imported goods 
never get outside the capital 
?that they are no longer 
satisfied with confessions, 
catalogues of shortcomings 
and exhortations promising 
instant change 
s "Everyone wants to 'buy a 
Mercedes overnight," he la-
mented. 
? 'If you want to steal, steal 
a little in a nice way," he in-
structed his listeners. "But 
if you steal too much to be-
cattle rich overnight, you'll 
soon be caught." 
Mobiltu. known as . "the 
president-founder" of the 
'country's only political 
party, or more simply as 
"The Guide," has yet to in-
clude these quotations in his 
Mao-like thoughts. published 
in the government-con-
trolled press. 
But there is an acute 
awareness in .Zaire that Mo-
butu has surrounded' him-
-self with men from north-
western Equator Province 
who are involved in many. of 
the juiciest, if questionable, 
government-run offices and 
projects.. 
South African goods?cs-
p.ecially foodstuffs?are reg-
- ulariy flown in aboard alt-
places belonging to a Zaire 
state trading ceinpany. No 
,. Zaire official seems ember-
;33 
rassed by such overt trading

cizeslor its apartheid policy 
or by the fact that identical.. 
fruit and vegetables not so 
many years. ago were avail-

Mobutu often complains 
about his fate, but.he has no 
intention of .quitting. "I've 
been in the front lines for 
16 years and that's where I. 
enjoy being," he confided in: 
a recent interview. 
Now that the United 
States shows sign of helping 
him out, he seems in better" 
spirits, especially since - 
Zaire's massive government 
and government-guaranteed 
foreign debt was recently 
rolled over by Western erect= 
itor nations. 
The United States seenis' . 
determined to place its faith 
in Mobutu's 55,000-man-
army, just as it did in the ? 
last decade. That army 
proved unable to' end the re-,

William F. Buckley 
The U.N.'s double standard 
.on violence in Africa 
The figures are not all in on South Afri-
ca, and it may be that, like the figures in-
volving the rioting Mexican students of 
1968, they won't ever be complete. But the 
last count showed that all of two white pen-
pie .were killed, and that therefore the rest 
of the casualties (133 again, at last 
count) were black. 
It is not yet clear how many of these 
were black policemen; not clear how many 
of them, were people killed by black and 
white policemen; and not clear how many 
were blacks killed by rioting blacks. That 
there were many of these is neither a) 
doubted; nor b) commented upon. Even 
though many newspapers featured, on 
page one, a picture of an automobile over-
turned by the rioters, not-so-neatly decapi-
tating the (black) driver, who was not a 
policeman. 
In short, although 'the disruption was 
ignited by resistance to a white order (that 
the local schools teach Afrikaans to the 
black natives), the principal victims were 
blacks. Not Only blacks killed and wound-
ed, but black enterprises burned, black 
hospitals and libraries destroyed. 
It isn't expected that much that is sensi-
ble should come out of the United Nations, 
and on this occasion the Security .Council 
.didn't let us down. The Council passed, 
unanimously, a vote deploring the use of 
force in South Africa. This was done with 
the usual animadversions on apartheid, 
which are entirely deserved in any moral 
frame, but with an undistributed middle, 
between a) deploring apartheid, and b) de-
ploring the use of force to stop rioters from 
killing non-rioters. 
One wonders what the South African po-
lice were supposed to do under the circum-
stances? Commit hara kin? Seal off 
Sowetho and permit its inhabitants to treat 
each other like Cambodians? 
What did we -- finally ? do in Watts? In 
order to restore the law, one uses force. 
Ptesident Eisenhower was willing to send 
paratroopers to enforce the law in Little 
Rock, Arkansas; and an entire armored 
division was ordered to stand by at the 
tithe of a major demonstration in Washing-
ton against the Vietnam War. 
To denounce South Africa for using 
force to stop the rioting is to do the kind of 
thing the United Nations is very best at: 
bringing discredit on itself by its hypocrisy 
and surrealism. It made no difference 
whatever to the Security Council that the 
charter of the United Nations specifically 
forbids intervention ? which in the United 
Nations means, actually, official commen-
tary ? in the internal affairs of sovereign 
states. It is a curious and unintended com-
mentary on white South Africa that its sins 
are thought worth denouncing, while those 
of black Africans are not. The easiest 
deduction is that when Amin kills a few 
thousand of his fellow citizens, or when 
one tribe sets out to eliminate another 
tribe, it isn't worth the attention of the Se-
curity Council, but that when the South 
African government acts to enforce its 
own (dismaying) laws, it is time for inter-
national indignation. 
A week before the South African Resolu-
tion, Mr. Leo Anderson, a Chicago resi-
dent, was returning home with his wife 
and children and was stopped at the en-
trance to a tunnel in a black section fo the 
city and ordered by a gang of young ruf-
fians to pay ten dollars for the privilege of 
going through. The driver declined, and 
started forward. Whereupon a young black 
materialized with a pistol, shot the driver 
twice, wounding him, and his wife once, 
killing her. Driver after driver went by, 
noticed the bloody chaos, but did nothing, 
and it was 30 minutes before help arrived. 
The widower, interviewed in the hospi-
tal, told a reporter that he harbors no ra-
cial resentment whatever against the kill-
er. "It was a set of rotten people who were 
there at the time. They happened to be 
black. There are rotten whites too." 
Just so. But it will be a long time before 
the Security Council finds any rotten 
blacks, and it has not even, on this occa-
sion, found any rotten whites. It is no safer 
to deduce the brutality of those who en-
force the law in South Africa from their 
use of force than it is to deduce the injus-
tice of American society from the fact of 
riots at Watts: no safer than to assume 
that blacks are evil because of a particular 
act of ugliness in Chicago. 
As is almost always the case, an individ-
ual spoke more wisdom, and showed more 
compassion, than an officially constituted 
tribunal. Mr. Leo Anderson should conduct 
seminars for the benefit of the ambassa-
hors to the United Nations.

South African riots 
The bloody race riots in 
the black suburbs of Johan-
nesburg have radically 
changed the perspective in 
the situation-in South Africa 
and pretty well knocked 
Secretary of State Henry 
Kissinger's newly con-
structed African policy into 
a cocked hat. 
The perspective and the 
policy were based on a 
number of assumptions. 
The first was that the major 
problem and danger spot in 
southern Africa was Rhode-
sia, where the white su-
premacist government of 
Prime Minister Ian Smith 
faces the virtual certainty 
of a disastrous war with 
black African guerrillas 
bent on establishing African., 
rule. 
The only hope of averting 
the war ? and the possible 
extinction of Rhodesia's 
white population ? is a 
very rapid transition to 
majority rule through ne-
gotiations with the black 
nationalist leaders. The 
concessions made so far, by 
the Smith regime toward 
easing racial restrictions in 
Rhodesia are universally 
considered to be too little 
and tot, -late to save the 
situation. 
The policy of the Ford 
administration has been to 
line up unequivocally be. 
hind rapid transition to 
black rule in Rhodesia. In 
the course of his recent trip 
to Africa, Mr. Kissinger 
made it clear that the re-
gime in Salisbury could 
count on no help from the 
United States in its confron-
tatien with the African 
35 
liberation movement. "On 
the contrary," the secre-
tary said, "Rhodesia will 
face our unrelenting opposi-
tion until a negotiated set-
tlement is achieved." 
So far as South Africa 
was concerned, the per-
spective was altogether dif-
ferent. 
There, the white minority 
regime was believed to be 
in firm control and the 
black population relatively 
passive ? an impression 
that the government in 
Pretoria eagerly encour-
aged. South Africa, further-
more, is a considerable 
military power, with mod-
ern equipment and an army 
of 50,000 men, backed by 
some 200,000 reservists. 
In cpntrast to Rhodesia, 
South African whites are 
hardly colonialists, having 
settled the country more 
than 300 years ago, long be-
fore most of the black popu-
lation arrived. 
Although South Africa's 
policies of apartheid are 
condemned by all the liber-
al democracies, including 
the United States, the coun-
try's strategic importance 
to the major shipping routes 
from the Middle East has 
argued against intensive 
pressure for political and 
social change at a faster 
pace than the white South 
Africans themselves are 
willing to accept. 
Indeed, Mr. Kissinger 
has been counting on the 
cooperation of the South 
Africans in coping with the 
problem of Rhodesia. In his 
meeting with South African 
Prime Minister John Vor-
ster in West Gen'tiany this 
week, the secretary had 
hoped to enlist the aid Of 
Rhodesia's only major ally 
in bringing pressure to bear 
on Ian Smith's beleaguered 
regime, and there was at 
least some reason to hOpe 
that Mr. Vorster was pre-
pared to be helpful. 
The riots starting Outside 
of Johannesburg have 
changed all that. Explosive 
pressures ? directly relat-
ed to South Africa's repres-
sive race laws ? have now 
been dramatically demon-
strated; ? the internal 
vulnerability of the govern-
ment in the face of a rising 
tide of black nationalism 
throughout the continent 
has now been starkly re-
vealed. 
It would be comforting to 
believe that the result of the 
explosion would be a height-
ened consciousness on the 
part of the South African 
authorities of the need for 
fundamental change and a 
speedup of essential re-
forms. Unfortunately, the 
contrary is more probable: 
That the riots will rest* in 
more repression, the devel-
Opment of a siege complex 
in white-ruled southern 
Africa, an end to efforts at 
accommodation and the en-
couragement of violence on 
the part of black Africans 
as the only means of achiev-
ing legitimate political 
goals. ? 
It also represents a sting-
ing setback for the emerg-
ing African policy of Henri 
Kissinger. And a singularly 
indigestible can of worms 
for a new American admin-
istration to inherit.

Taiwan Issue 
To the Editor: 
In his June 21 Op-Ed article, .Allen 
S. Whiting overstates the intenaity of 
Peking's irritation with the U.S. on the 
Taiwan issue and underestimates the 
obstacles to any serious Chinese move 
toward the U.S.S.R. On the Taiwan. 
? issue, the Times editorial of June 17 t, 
("The China Knot") was much closer, 
to the mark, but the editors could 
.have added that Peking's attitude may 
also be conditioned by. fear that the 
Nationalists might turn elsewhere for 
protection, namely to the U.S.S.R., if 
cast adrift by the U.S. 
Peking's main concern abet? the 
U.S. today is precisely the question 
raised by Auwalian Prime Minister 
Fraser last week with Hua Kno-feng. 
Fraser wondered if the U.S. now has 
the necessary cohesion and will to 
? provide an effective counter to the . 
outward thrust of Soviet power in 
Asia, the Indian; Ocean e,m1 other 
..regions of concern. No doubt, Hua 
'replied that those- were 'exactly ids

been stimulated by econom-
iii potential but is grounded 
In the cultural and language 
'differences among the. vari-
ous Wand groups., was an 
appeal from Roger Baldwin,. 
of the International League 
for Human Rights,' for the 
maintenance of Micronesian 
unity. 
Baldwin .and two 'col-
leagues charged . that the 
United States was seeking 
the separation of the Mari-
anas from the rest of Micro-
nesia in a "divide and rule".. 
tactic that is "colonial" in. 
nature. ? ? 
Council members are the 
United States, Britain, 
France, the Soviet .Union 
and China. 
Both the U.S. administra-
tion and the representatives 
from the Caroline island 
districts of Micronesia, which 
contain the majority of the 
114;000 Population but have 
:less ?economie potential than 
:Peking. ? ? 
? 
The points at issue in the Sino-
-Soviet dispute still relate to basic 
Chinese values and interests. They 
have to do with China's determination 
to pursue its own read to building 
?socialism, to assert its own strategy 
for world revolution and to establish. 
what the Chinese consider their proper 
role as a self-reliant nation playing an 
important and independent role in 
world affairs. Any meaningful rap-
prochement with the U.S.S.R.. would 
necessitate serious compromise of 
these values, unless, of course, the 
U.S.S.R. itself had undergone a basic 
change in its values and aspirations. 
And surely a turn toward the U.S.S.R.. 
would not be the way to speed. the 
U.S. departure from Taiwan. 
?Rut if the. alarmists are right and 
? Oa, consensus in Peking on the proper 
direction of China's basic interests is 
so fragile that it could be torn apart

reaenn to approach the deliaate process 
of normalization of reiatiana with

SOOTHSAYERS 
The China Experts 
One of the problems that bedevil 
Taiwan's diplomatic strategists is the 
difficulty in keeping up to date on what 
Washing-tor is thinking and doing about 
China. Thus, with the third "Sino-
American Conference on Mainland 
China" in Taipei last. Week (the others 
were held in 1971 and 1974), it was hoped 
? that the airing of opinion by some leading 
U.S. Sinologists would procide a few 
clues. In the event, the loca!s wound up 
even more mystified then twee: the 
guests not only disagreed with much of 
what Taiwan's own China-watchers had 
to say, but managed to pour scorn or, one 
anotiter as wir.,11.

Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : C A.RDP77-00432R0001003900d6-9 
That diversity of outlook is the price 
Taipei has had to pay for its recent 
success in opening contacts with a wider 
range of American opinion leaders, rather 
than shunning all but staunch anti-
communists. But if the academic visitors 
offered no peeps into the rinds of 
American policymakers, the Nationalists 
still had cause to consider the conference 
a success. For one thing, it attracted 
some 40 American scholars ? including 
some leading liberals ? and during 
formal sessions and informal encounters, 
the hosts had opportunity aplenty to 
press a central point: that American 
"derecognition" of Taiwan, for the 
purpose of placating Peking, was both 
unnecessary and undesirable. 
Among the guests were Jerome Cohen 
and Ezra Vogel of Harvard, Robert 
Scalapino of Berkeley, Ralph Clough of 
the Brookings Institution and Ray Cline 
of Washington's Georgetown University. 
In seeking closer relations with such 
? scholars, reports ASIAWEEK'S P.L. Hsia, 
Taiwan hoped to impress upon them the 
seriousness of its own mainland-
watchers' scholarship and thus eliminate 
the tendency of many foreign analysts to 
dismiss the locals as mere propagandists. 
But while many of the American 
participants seemed suitably awed by the 
fact-gathering capacity of their Taiwan 
counterparts, they had scant praise for 
much of the analysis (a sentiment that 
? was fully reciprocated). Most notably, 
the local scholars predicted that after 
Chairman Mao Tse-tung's death there 
would be such a fierce "crisis of 
succession" that central political author-
ity would yield to a number of regional 
power centres ? a sort of "new 
warlordism." Few of the Americans 
(agreed with that conclusion. 
The conference's liveliest session came 
on the last day when Thomas Robinson, 
associate professor of political science at 
Washington U., stood. up to advocate 
early U.S. recognition of Peking via the 
"Japanese formula" of reducing Amer-
ican representation in Taipei to unofficial 
level. If full relations were still not 
consummated when Mao died, he argued, 
Washington might risk the emergence of 
a moderate Peking leadership intent on 
? settling differences with Moscow. At 
such a point, declared Robinson (who 
joked that he'd been advised to wear a 
bullet-proof vest to the meeting), Amer 
-
ice's bargaining position would be badly 
weakened, especially since the U.S. 
would require Peking's support to help 
offset the growing strehgth of the Soviet 
Union. 
The chief spokesman for the opposite 
viewpoint was Georgetown's Cline, a 
onetime boss of the State Department's 
Intelligence & Research Bureau and a 
frequent critic of Kissingerie.n foreign 
policy. Contending that Peking needs the 
U.S. much more than vice-versa, Cline 
saw no compelling reason for Washing-
ton to abrogate its defence treaty and 
jettison diplomatic relations with old ally 
Taiwan. The U.S., he said, should offer 
to open an embassy in Peking without 
? closing the one in Taipei. If Peking 
accepts, he said, that will be fine; if not, 
? that will be their problem.

Twelve Christian Workers Released

Washington Post Foreign Service 
SEOUL, July 7?South Ko-
rean police repeatedly 
punched and threatened 
Christiar. ministers and lay 
workers when they refused 
;to falsely confess that their 
church community organiza-
tion was Communist-influ-
-?enced, It was alleged here 
today. ? 
The charges of police bre-
, 
.;--tality were made by mem-
- 
tiers of the Seoul Metropoli-
tan Community Organize-
tion soon after the release 
yesterday a the last three 
of twelve persons held for a 
six-week investigation.-- - ? 
Police gave no explana-
tion for the original arrests 
or for the unexpected re-
lease of nine staffers of the 
organization last Saturday 
and the group's chairman, 
the Rev. Park Hyung-Kyu, 
with two others late last 
night 
-.Justice Minister Whang 
San Duk said in an inter-
view that the prosecution 
was suspended to ?protect 
the freedom of religion and 
in consideration of the 12 
prisoners' social status. He 
said they had "deeply re-
pented of their past errors." 
Whang said he had not re-
ceived any report of police 
violence, and did -not believe 
it had happened. He -prom-
ised to investigate the 
charges. ?, 
The Rev. Park has been 
jailed three times since 1972 
when he founded the com-
munity% organization to 
bring medical aid and a 
sense of self-worth to 
Seoul's slum dwellers. 
Well-informed sources 
here say the decision to halt 
the prosecution was influ-
enced by an unusually 
strong effort on behalf of 
the eleven men and one 
woman by U.S. Ambassador 
Richard Sneider. 
An embassy spokesman 
declined to comment on U.S. 
intervention in the case. In 
the past, the embassy has re-
fused to disclose any efforts 
liege 
once 
to encourage the Seoul gote , 
ernment to respect human 
-rights on the ground that 
publicity would reduce the 
mission's effectiveness. 
Sneider, who has been ac-
cused of not exerting maxi 
mum persuasion in earlier 
cases, "fairly banged the ta-
ble on this one," a nondiplo-
matic source said. 
Since ? late 197Z when -' 
- Park seized wide powers via 1 
martial law, political opposi-
tion has been discouraged, 
and opponents of the gov-
ernment have been arrested 
frequently. People who have 
been released from prison 
have frequently -charged 
that they were mistreated 
by their jailers. - - - ? 
Sources say there was also 
a bitter. interdepartmental 
struggle over the case be-
tween .Korea's two largest 
law enforcement agencies, 
the Korean Central Intelli-
gence Agency IKCIA) and 
the national police The 
KCIA has conducted daily 
surveillance of the group's 
activities, and agency offi-
cials reportedly were out-
raged when the police 
claimed to have evidence of 
pro Communist eictivities go-
ing on under their noses. 
The KCIA, which has fre-
quently questioned and re-
leased workers of the -Chris-
tian action group, won out 
when the public prosecutor's 
office ordered the police to . 
relinquish the case. 
Another factor in the po-
lice failure to release the 
prisoners, according to these 
well-placed sourees, was an 
inability to obtain evidence 
for a credible conviction. 
Senior leaders of the Protes-
tant churches in Korea vig-
orously criticized the arrests 
in meetings with police offi-
cials and the minister of 
home affairs, Kim CM Yul. 
A resolution adopted by the 
Human Rights Commission 
of the - Korean National 
Council Of Churches 
37 
-ore.an. 
rutalit 
"rejected the government's 
implied charges of Commu-
nist conspiracy as ground-
less," accused the govern-
ment of misunderstanding 
the church's true mission, 
and interpreted the arrests 
as "an attack... against the 
church as a whole." 
"There's not a church 
? member in Korea who 
would believe they were 
Communists," an American 
? missionary comented. 
? Of the twelve people held 
and then released, six have 
told friends they were 
beaten up, three of them se-
verely. They said they were

tify the group's spiritual and

Americans worry about Cuban intervention 
ifl-Africa and thunder about Cuba's. annoying if 
ineffective subversion in Puerto Rico. Yet they 
fail to notice revolutionary change of an otni 
nous 'character taking place in the Caribbean, 
and especially the English-speaking ,Caribbean. 
Prime 'Minister Forbes Burnham, ? who was 
thought of as Washington's man when he took 
power in Guyana in 1954, is moving that South 
American mainland state by salami slices into a 
Marxist-Leninist dictatorship. Prime Minister 
. Michael Manley appears to be heading the same 
way in Jamaica, under. cover of Draconian 
emergency responses to widespread violence 
and in the name of democratic socialism:

West Indies, A W1011'1410 theory involving tite 
part by the quadrupling of oil prices, 
cutting off the massive help provided 
by the United States would be a form 
of suicide. 
Given his Marxist outlook, Castro 
may envisage Puerto Rico as a second 
Angola. Cuban troops would move in to 
keep order. But with Cubans them-
selves still rationed for many essentials, 
the food deficit could never be made 
up. The island would soon become a 
starving poorhouse. - 
As a measure of American help, out 
of a population of 3 million, 52 per cent, 
or 1,558,000, are on the food stamp pro-
gram. More than 200,000 are on the fed-
eral aid for families with dependent 
children, although the monthly pay-
ment of $45 does not go far. 
A determinded drive to build up in-
dustry and tourism has raised per cap-
ita income to more than $2,000, accord-
ing to a spokesman for the island. That 
income is the second-highest in Latin 
America, exceeded only by oil-rich 
Venezuela. With unemployment offi-
daily at 17 per cent and tourism falling 
off, it will be a struggle to sustain such 
a level. 
Even if they had had a moment to 
consider it, this must all have seemed 
irrelevant to the heads of government. 
Each has his own serious political-eco-

unemployment and the dangers if the 
brake is pushed down too hard on the 
current recovery: 
Puerto Rico is in a sense part of the

lone? in the last six months on Seaga : 
the CIA, for two reasons, ? 
First, the PNP won. four :by-elections: 
last yeer and has remained popular 
since coming to power in 1972, despite 
being faced with the political adversities ..? 
? of oil price increases and world reces-' 
non. So, Seaga as opposition leader 
'faces' near certain defeat at the next 
'election, to be held before next Febru-
ary. 
Second, Washington is believed to 
have become worried about the direc-
tion. of Jamaican politics. The PNP gov-
?-ernment openly declared its objectives 
to be socialist and madc no secret of its 
? friendship with Cuba. Thus, it is' alleged, 
the CIA began six .months ago to focus ? 
on determining the credibility of Seaga 
? as an alternative to Prime Minister and 
PNP leader Michael Manley. 
IT IS SUGGESTED that Seaga, who 
had a reputation? for using violence in 
"earlier political' battles, secured money

This .scenario is by no means univer-
sally accepted. But what is unquestioned. 
is that citizens have died in the last six 
. months in Kingston as guns have prolif-
erated along with Molotov cocktails and 
arson. Many victims have been young 
members of the PNP. Military discipline 
has been instituted, and Manley . and 
? members of his government have joined 
an expanded Home Guard. 
What alarms Jamaicans is that their 
country is being hit by violence of a 
clearly Political ? and evidently foreign 
? nature. It is not aimed at ? the 
wealthy, nor at. the tourists who cortin-. 
ue to crowd .the sun-drenched beaches 
on the north ?coast seeking tropical de-
lights. It is in the poorer parte of King-
ston, .and among the political protago-
nists, that the heat is felt. 
The allegation of CIA interference has 
gained credence with. the exposure of 
the agency's adtivities in other nations,.

World countries are increasingly seeking 
as an alternative to reliance on the rich

technology. Yet, it is generally accepted 
that such nations do not interfere in 
each other's politicel.systems. 
Jamaicans, with their history of turbu-
lent political pluralism, are little inter-
ested in the conformity of cornea:mist-a

h Kingdom Goes to Vkiaste7 
Recently, Jamaican Prime Minister 
Michael Manley invited supporters at-
tending the tenth annual conference of 
his Central Kingston constituency to. 
study closely a film called :Inc Rise and 
rf an? CIA. a British-made doeti-
mentary a tpaut alieged agency opera-

court of law that the (IA is here," Man-
ley told his audience. "What I have said 
is that certain stranee thines are hap-
pening in farnalca whieh we have not 
seen before." 
By "strange things," the Pi hue Min-
ister meant random nets of violence that 
so farthie year have led to the death of 
more than MO people, mi.,stly- in the 
slums of West 'Kingston, ast week.. 
though, Peruvian Ambassador Fenian-
? 
Seaga and Manley. agree national de-
velopment is the 'essential objective.. 
Seaga calls his policy nationalism; Man-
ley. speaks of. .democratic socialism.; 
communism has. never been an issue 
between them. 
Manley's socialisin is recognized as 
preserving Jamaica's democratic tradie, 
tins of a free and critical 'press, free 
speech and association. The trade un- : 
ions are divided between the two par-
ties. The police, security forces, and ju-
diciary are independent. 
If Jamaicans became convinced their 1, 
free choice between the parties at the 
next election was being subverted .front 
outside, much el the Third World would 
be incensed. 
? AT THE SAME TIME, the real alter-
natives would be submerged. Seaga rep-
resents the business interests cf this 
country and believes the national econo-
my can grow only if government con- 
trots. are removed from all but the rural , 
sector.. 
Manley would seek to narrow the gap ! 
in living standards between the minority . 
elite and the common masses until it 
disappears. He says government must 
create new jobs, insist on a minimum 
wage; build houses and roads, provide 
'tensions and health services, end supply 
'food to the needy.- in addition to contael-
Eng utilities and educational institutions. 
If the PNP should be defeated in the 
coniLrig elections, by either constitution-
al or subversive means, there would he 
a real danger that right- and leitewing 
forces would engage in a death stru;azle 
to impose their brands of totalitarian-
ism. And if they did, the chances ? for 
peace on this island and of trust in the

? found evidence that terrorism was to be 
deliberately stepped up this week. 
Nighttime Sounds. The Prime 
Minister, announcing the state of emer-
-genes,, also gave a vivid example of the 
kind of violence he intended to stop. On 
the night of May 19, Manley recalled, 
in what has become known as the "Or-
ange Street Massacre," a gang seeking 
vengeance for the stabbing of one of its 
members set fire to a tenement house. 
With gunfire the gang held firemen.at 
?. bey and the occupants inside the burn-
ing building. Fight children and three?  ? 
adults died in the fire. . 
? Even before the State of emergency, 
police and soldiers of the 8,000-man Se-
? curity force:had been-carrying Out night-
ly cordon-and-search operations in 
? Kingston under the country's weapons 
? control laws (automatic life imprison-
ment for anyone caught with guns, gres 
nades or explosive devices). A new ad-
? dition to the nighttime sights and sounds 
of the city is the loud whir of an irmy 
'helicopter with a powerful searchlight. 
hovering over an area where security 
forces have moved in to make a sweep. 
' U.S. Ambassador Sumner Gerard 
has protested that the CIA is not in any 
manner trying to upset the Jamaican 
government, even though Washington is 
less than happy about Manley's warm-
ing friendship with Fidel Castro. Ge-
rard's denials were reinforced last week 
by William H. Luers, Deputy Assistant 
? Secretary of State for International Af-
BALTIMORE SUN 
25 June 1976 
Post-Allende repression: 
fairs, who told a House subcommittee 
that allegations of U.S. interference were 
"totally false.- If American citizens are 
engaged privately in "destabilizing.' ac-
tivities, Luers added, "we are prepared 
to cooperate fully with the governments 
of the area to bring them to justice." 
Prime Minister Manley is not total, 
ly. convinced. "We have not said? that 
destabilization in Jamaica is the result 
of deliberate top-level U.S. Government 
. he told TIME Correspondent 
Bernard Diederich last week. "Dr. Kis-
singer has said that it is not so, and that 
may be so. Nonetheless, what upsets 
people now is that assurances were be-
ing given Allende and his ambassadors 
up to a few weeks before this death] 
?bland aesurances saying 'Of course 
we're not doing that'?and yet we now 
know it was happening." 
Specifically, Manley blames the vi-
olence on his right-wing political ene-
mies who are trying to impede Jamai-
ca's path to socialism. If, in that, they 
do get help from American sources,- he 
claims, it is partly because of his friend-
ship With Castro (who may visit Kings-
ton in August) and partly because Ja-
maica backed the pro-Soviet regime of 
Agostinho Neto in Angola. The U.S., ar-
gues Manley, "has been resentful of any 
country in the Western Hemisphere that 
came out in support of Neto and the Cu-
bans against the South Africans. They 
have been very bitter about it." 
A more plausible explanation for 
Jamaica's unrest is Maniey's efforts to 
turn the island republic into a socialist 
state. Even the Prime Minister's sup-
porters concede that the economy is in ? 
a shambles. Unemployment is running 
at about 22rda and is particularly high 
among urban youth. who police say 
are guilty of most of the recent mur-
ders. The country's foreign exchange 
earnings, principally from bauxite, sug-
ar and tourism, are down 40 to 60% . 
below last year's total .of $400 million,: 
and reserves have dropped from more 
than $102 million in November to less 
than $38? million. Wealthy Jamaicans 
have illicitly exported perhaps $200 mil-
lion abroad; some of the currency has 
been smuggled out in fake cigarettes, , 
fortune cookies and pork carcasses. Says. - 
One member of an intelligence force try-
? ing to halt the financial outflow:. 'It ? 
has replaced the smuggling of ganja 
(marijuana) to Grand Cayman; Miami 
and Canada." 
Chance of Winning. In additiOn; 
many wealthy Jamaicans have set up 
. second residences abroad. Whether they 
emigrate will depend on the outcome.of 
the next general election (probably in ? 
February). Manley's People's National. 
Party currently has 35 seats iii Parlia-
ment, to .17 . for the opposition Labor 
Party. led by Edward Seaga. An able 
economist. Seaga faces the. ethnic dis-
advantage of his Lebanese ancestry; he 
is light-skinned in an overwhelmingly 
black nation. Nonetheless, he stands .a 
goixi chance of winning if these is more 
violence and the economy continues to 
stagger. Many Jamaicans are convinced. 
that will be the case. In the sad words 
of a current hit by Ernie Smith, one of 
Kingston's top reggae singers, "As we 
fight one another fe de power and de 
glory, jab kingdom goes to waste." 
U.S. squeamishness b ffles Chile 
By HENRY L. TREWHITT 
Sun Staff Correspondent 
Santiago, Chile ? The 
words come with a rush Of 
puzzlement and fear that they 
will be misunderstood: "We 
thought the United States 
would welcome the change. ? 
We hoped all the Comrnunists 
would be killed." ? 
'She toys with her Coffee 
cup in a Valparaiso cafe, a 
trim, attractive, upper mid-
dle-class housewife who might 
be a social leader in Roland 
Park or Chevy Chase. Her 
husband, whose English is 
better, cringes faintly. 
In Santiago, Col. Gaston 
Zuniga Paredes, the military 
government's director of com-
munication, echoes the first of 
the two thoughts. "There has 
been some amazement," he 
says, "because Chileans 
thought the ? United States 
would help after, they threw 
out the Communists. There 
has been some surprise that 
the United States. instead of 
helping, backed away." 
Doubtless there is more 
than a touch of disingenuous-
ness in these attitude& at 
least on Colonel Zuniga's part. 
? They suggest none of the corn-
.pletity Cf the 'U.S.-Chilean re-
lationship since Gen. Augusto 
Pinoehet's military, junta 
? overthrew Salvador Allende, 
the Marxist president, in 
September, 1973. ?? 
But an element of unaf-
fected naivete, or simple ideo-
logical. ? ? self-righteousness, 
runs through the attitudes of 
much of Chile's' middle class 
? and military government. All 
things considered, the United 
States has been remarkably 
forthcoming to the junta. 
All things in this case 
include the Nixon administra-
? tion's efforts ? to prevent 
.Allende's.election in 1970: And 
after his election with 36 per 
.cent ? of the vote, its support 
for the democratic opposition 
and its barriers, in .effect, to 
? Chile in the international 
motley market. 
? How much U.S. policy had 
to do with Allencle's mail and 
death' will be disputed for 
years.' For Allende, paradoxi-
cally. a Marxist who partook. 
liberally of the good life, also 
naively assumed that 
enforced communism and 
? democracy were compatible. 
The result predictably was 
hews. Never huareseed by a 
' 01 
? majority, of the public or in 
? Congress, he tackled capital-
ism in a way that drove 
capitalists, technicians or 
anyone else who could salvage 
his assets out of the country. 
.Strikes paralyzed much' of 
industry. By the fall of 1973 
the inflation ? rate - was 
? somewhere about 500 to '600 
per cent?.no one knows for 
? sure?and Chile was sinking 
under its social, economic and 
political burdens. ? 
? Finally ? the ? disaster 
brought .the military out of its 
historic submission to civilian 
rale. As so often happens, the 
? .cure may be Worse than the 
illness. What, made the junta 
? of .General Pinochet, 60, an 
? instant embarrassment to the 
United States was its iron 
repreSs.ion of dissent. 
Pertiaps as many. as 2,500 
were slaughtered during, the 
coup. The junta has suspended 
the majority parties ..of :the 
center, abolished those of the 
left, suspended ali political 
activity, locked up anyone 
vocally to the left of tt faint 
. rose coloration, weeded even 
moderate le.fti5tS out of the 
taiiversines and generally has 
-
imposed on Chile an apolitical 
ideology of ?faire 
capitalism. 
Under Allende the techno-
crats fled Chile. Under the 
junta Chile's abstract thinkers 
have fled. 
' But worst of all, to the out-
side world, have been the doc? 
-
umented executions, the dis-
appearances, and the. torture 
conducted by DINA, the Di-
rector4e for National Intel-
ligence .:1-the ? secret police. 
Operated by Col. Manuel Con,

camps. near. Santiago. It re-
ports only to General Pinoch-

suspect that in the way of se-

erates beyond even his con-
trol.

accumulated on the record. 
They are on the record in 
large part for a peculiar rea-
son.. For despite its represe

admits foreign correspond-
ents who poke artnmd with 
some considerable freedom. 
Their findings, and those of 
several international agen-
cies, rue a familiar grisly 
gamut. There are the persons

arrested whose bodies are 
. found later, brutalized. There 
are the electrodes attached to 
genitals. There are the rapes 
by persons unseen from 
behind blindfolds. The list is 
undeniable. 
Nevertheless, Alvaro Pu-
ga, a political adviser to the 
government, argues that none. 
of the major U.S. publications 
has been willing to listen 
rationally to government 
objectives or to its 
explanations. 
? Basically, both Mr. Puga 
and Colonel Zuniga admit 
there have been abuses by 
physical mistreatment of pris-
oners. In fact, Mr. Puga says, 
109 police, military men or 
members of DINA have been 
punished for abuse?including 
ooe offender sentenced to 10 
years in prison. e 
Basically also, they deny 
abuse in the general pattern 
tA arrests and imprisonment. 
In the general pattern of left-
ist activities, they portray a 
Communist conspiracy, sup-
ported by the Soviet Union, to 
take over Smith America. 
"Chile," says Colonel 
Zuriiga firmly, "Is the only 
country really fighting the 
Communists." 
Whether the colonel and 
his leaders really think in 
such simple terms is one of 
the frustrating questions in 
assessing Chile. Certainly they 
have been successful in sup-
pressing anything resembling 
effective opposition. There 
are known Communists still 
on the job in Chile today?and 
they are resolutely silent. 
Punishments can be subtle. 
One radio editor who became 
too lax in self-censorship was 
banished to a mountain town 
at 12,000 feet in the Andes, an 
ordeal for a flatlander. He 
came home in the limited 
amnesty that honored the ar-
rival of Henry A. Kissinger, 
the Secretary of State, earlier 
this month. 
Outsiders who specialize in 
Chilean affairs will attempt 
anonymously to shed perspec-
tive on the current leadership, 
recognizing that perspective 
can be mistaken for 
endorsement. 
"These are military techni-
cians, unsophisticated politi-
cally, pragmatic and driven 
by emotional anti-Marxism," 
says one. "They are honest 
and without personal ambi-
tidn in conventional terms. 
Their politics is utter loyalty 
to Chile as a state and their 
economics is that of William 
E. Simon [U.S. Treasury 
Secretary]. Adam Smith is 
alive and well in Santiago and 
Washington." 
Somewhere between 300 
and 400 political prisoners are 
held at any given time under 
extralegal state of siege 
terms, one reports. It is these, 
passing through what another 
calls "DINA's revolving

subject to physical mistreat-

WASHDTGTON POST 
S JUL 19-16 
Stuff nits Threatened 
By Marlise Simons 
Suede! 0 The Vishin-stan Post 
MEXICO CITY, -July 8?
The editorial staff and man-
agement of Mexico's leading 
newspaper walked.. off the 
job today, saying*their cnly 
alternative was ti fight it 
out with dissident ecuscrva-
lives in the cooperative en-
terprise who had occupied 
the plant earlier in the day. 
The staff feels lteedom of 
the press in Mexico is at 
stake. 
Excelsior, the only impor-
tant independent newspaper 
in Mexico and one of the 
few remaining. in Latin 
America. has come under 
attack recently. by elements 
who the editor 'believes are 
supported by the govern. 
morn of President Luis 
Echeverria. The paper often 
has criticized the president. 
_ ? 
ing arms. Perhaps 2,000 more 
have been tried, convicted and 
are serving sentences for 
charges growing out of 'the 
political transition. 
"Theoretically," says one 
source, "this ties down all the 
corners, accounting for every-
body. But in fact there is a 
fourth category." This is the 
category of those arrested but 
unaccounted for by DINA, 
which still fails in many cases 
to fulfill new government 
requirements for full account-
ing, for physical examination 
of all prisoners by doctors, 
and for notification of 
families when a member is 
arrested. 
Some of the extralegal 
prisoners, an analyst says, 
would be a severe threat to 
the government by any objec-
tive standards. These are 
assassins and bomb-throwers 
of militant communism, 
members of the Revolution-
ary Left Movement. But many 
are victims of arbitrary judg-
ment, and no outsiders, appar-
ently, have a clear idea of 
where the lines are drawn. - 
The abuses and ambiguity 
have helped create a double 
standard in the appraisal of 
Chile by outsiders. To some on 
the left, Chile's repression is 
reprehensible, Cuba's defensi-
ble. Even some Latin govern-
ments with scarcely liberal 
governments are quick to 
attack Chile's record. 
The reasons are plain, 
according to a foreign diplo-
mat. First of all, Allende was 
t widely perceived as a social 
democrat, not a Communist. 
Then the coup, 'when it came, 
was quite bloody. Then, the 
source adds, "there is simple 
hypocrisy along with effective 
Communist prcipaganda." 
For its Ipart the US.. is 
trying to walk a delicate line 
in its relations with Chile, 
. joining the pressure for politi-
cal reform without cutting its 
strategic lines. Strategic 
? interests in the area are clear, 
given Chile's position along 
the whole southern half of , 
.South America's west coast. ' 
. The U.S., one specialist 
reports, "is trying to move the 
leaders along politically. It 
certainly is not trying to over-
throw them or to replace 
them. It sees no reasonable al-
ternatives for the short term." 
That is why Mr. Kissinger's 
words on human rights earlier 
this month were so carefully 
framed, to avoid condemna-
tion of Chile while keeping up 
. the pressure for reform. Pre-
sumably that also is part of 
the reason credits to keep 
Chile's struggling economy 
; afloat have become available. 
Indeed, according to one 
American analyst, the dual 
policy seems to be working as 
Chile's leaders feel the inter-
national heat. The level of 
, actual mistreatment of 
Chileans, he asserts, "is down 
considerably from a year ago, 
though it still is not something 
to trumpet from the 
housetops." 
Mexico Paper 
Printers and others oc-
cupying the plant. said they 
would not allow publication 
until editor Julio Scherer 
left. They sent word that 
they had removed vital parts 
of the presses to make their 
point. Scherer left, saying 
"our decision was to avoid 
violence or bloodshed at any 
cost." 
Early this morning, about 
50 conservative members of 
the cooperative invaded the 
Excelsior plant and stopped 
the presses. The paper later 
appeared ?with a blank back. 
page that was. to have con-
tained an editorial staff 
manifesto declarin g that 
freedom of the press was. 
? being threatened.. 
In a later assembly of tiie 
cooperative, which lacked a 
quorum, ? the conservatives 
. claired that Scherer and 
of the prinev's top 
managers were fired, 
The entire 'management 
and editorial staff, filen con-
?voked their 'own assembly 
.with a quorum of 812 of the 
1,300 members. This group 
called for a new and legal 
assembly on July 21. 
Until then, they said they 
would not produce a paper, 
claiming there was no guar-
antee the dissenters would 
not sabotage its contents. 
A month ago, a group ap: 
parcntly?backed by the gov-
ernment illegally ? occupied 
property owned by Excelsior 
claiming the land is !mons. 
0 1 h or newspapers and 
television stations have earn-
pair' 01$ to embarrass Excel-
sior's editor by puhiisning 
insulting ads and picturing 
the land occupation as legal.
