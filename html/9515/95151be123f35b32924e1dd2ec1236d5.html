 As the North Atlantic Treaty powers prepared to'
 discuss the difficult problems connected with financing an
 effective instrument-for the defense of Western Europe
 (see page 16); 'Germany's future role in these efforts re-
 maihed undetermined in the face of anticipated delays in
 German acceptance of limited membership in the Council
 of Europe (see page 2). Meanwhile, French and Italian
 Communists continued their preparations for more militant
 action, with violent manifestions likely in France and a wide-
 spread farm labor strike anticipated in Italy (see pages 2 and 3).
 In the Near East, prospects for an Arab-Israeli settle-
 ment have become more remote (see page 8). The UN Pal-
 estine Conciliation Commission has bogged down in its efforts
 to bring the protagonists together, and the armistice atmosphere
 is becoming more strained. In Iran, unemployment may reach
 critical proportions within a few weeks unless the government
 'can obtain additional funds for emergency measures (see page 9).
 In the Far East, progress was made toward stability. as
 the Makassar revolt was suppressed in Indonesia, (see page 11)
 and the Burmese Government scored successes against.Com-
 munist dissidents (see page 11). The imminent removal of
 Premier Long in Indochina, however, will further delay the
 establishment of an effective non-Communist Vietnamese
 government (see page 12).

 GERMANY
 Council of Europe   Internal political considerations are
 likely to further delay German accept-
 ance of associate membership in the Council of Europe.
 Although Chancellor Adenauer is anxious to align West
 Germany firmly with the Western Powers, he hopes to
 avoid antagonizing the considerable body of opinion which:
 (1) believes that membership on a limited basis is not
 worth the risk of Soviet reprisals; and (2) is reluctant to
 take a step which might partition the country irrevocably,
 Moreover, Adenauer wishes to regain the loss in popularity
 and prestige of his government resulting from such recent
 '.Western actions, as the Franco-Saar conventions, suspension
 of important Bundestag laws, High Commission criticism of
 the government's economic policies, and US efforts to enforce
 restrictions on East-West trade. Adenauer will therefore
 attempt to use the Council of Europe issue as a lever to
 obtain concessions from the West which will improve Germany's'
 international status and weaken the position of extremist nation-
 alist elements in the coming Land elections.
 Communist Tactics   The recent gradual shift in the French
 Communist Party toward greater
 militancy received official endorsement at the Party's National
 Congress, The' speeches and resolutions attested to a tougher
 attitude, a greater reliance on younger militants, and a ruthless
 weeding out of all deviationists. While not excluding the use
 of organized labor and the political means at, its disposal to

 achieve its goals, the Communist Party has embarked on
 a program of more'direct and vigorous action against the
 French national defense effort, possibly including direct
 sabotage and increasingly violent manifestations. More-
 over, the Party may be preparing its cadres to carry out
 effective illegal operations if it is forced to go underground.
 Farm Strike As in France, the Communists in Italy are
 relying increasingly on direct action in their
 offensive against the government and the defense effort. As
 part of this offensive, the Communists are currently organiz-
 ing a general strike of farm day-laborers which may erupt during
 the next month with violence so widespread that it may seriously
 tax the power of the police. As the poorest, most underprivi.=
 leged class in Italy, these farm laborers are not only susceptible
 to Communist leadership but can easily be provoked to violent
 action. This danger is aggravated by the presence of strengthened
 neo-fascist contingents supported by large landowners determined
 to resist demands for higher wages; Despite considerable agitation
 and possible bloodshed, the Italian police will probably be able
 to suppress the anticipated disturbances,
 Wage Problem   As the crucial parliamentary debate on the
 1950 budget begins, the Labor Government
 is meeting growing opposition from labor's rank and file on
 its wage stabilization and compulsory arbitration policy. It

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/21 : CIA-RDP78-01617AO02300150001-9
 is clear that the majority of unions affiliated with the. Trades
 Union Congress (TUC) no longer feel that a policy of wage
 restraint is justified. Moreover, the system of compulsory.
 arbitration carefully built.up by the government has been
 threatened by the Confederation of Engineers and Shipbuilders.
 This union will decide by ballot whether to submit its wage
 claim to arbitration or to resort to strike action. Although
 the TUC General Council will postpone ?any:action on labor's
 wage demands until after the budget debate, the wage question
 confronts the Labor Government with a difficult decision. The
 stability of the present government, as well as the slow progress
 being.made toward economic recovery, would be endangered by
 either the widespread strikes which might result from failure
 to grant labor's demands or the inflationary effect of higher wages.

 Crop Production   Prospects for 1950 grain crop pro-
 .                                 'duction In the Satellite orbit indicate
 that there will be an increase of 6.1 million tons over the
 record postwar crop of 1949. Total production, however,
 will be about 92 percent of the 1935-39 annual average.
 The largest percentage increase is in the Satellites, where
 1950 production will probably exceed. 1949 by 8 percent;
 in the USSR, production will probably increase 4 percent.
 On the basis of the 1949 estimated rates of domestic con-
 sumption with an allowance made for the increase in popu-
 lation, there should be an increase of 4,5 million tons of
 grain over the 1949 a mount available for export and stock-
 piling. Of this, the Satellites' share will probably be
 2,700,000 tens and the USSR's 1,800,000 tons. The Satel-
 lites are likely to increase their stotkpiles.to insure
 urban food supplies as they intensify the campaign to
 socialize agriculture; the USSR will probably attempt to
 export most of its.surplus.
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Anti-US Action     The continuing Satellite campaign against .
 Western and specifically US influence has
 focussed in Czechoslovakia with the closure of the US Infor-
 mation Service and the launching of a major espionage trial
 involving the US' Embassy, Such actions are designed to iso-
 late the,population from the West, eliminate manifestations
 of contiriuec1'.US interest in the area, and reduce the effectiveness
 of US missions. " These aims have been more or less attained

 Peace Prospects   Progress toward an Arab-Israeli settle-
 ment has come to a virtual standstill and
 prospects for breaking the impasse are poor. The recent
 efforts of the UN Palestine Conciliation Commission (PCC)
 have failed, and both the Arabs and the Israelis have temp-
 orarily closed the door on direct negotiations. The Arab
 states have in effect rejected the PCC's new approach in-
 volving a combination of mediation and direct negotiations,
 while Israel has further handicapped the PCC by publicly
 denouncing Arab resistance to the Commission's conciliation
 efforts. The recent elections in Jordan also revealed strong
 sentiment against reopening negotiations with Israel. Mean-
 while, the Arab League has adopted a number of resolutions
 tightening-the.Arab embargo against Israel and has drawn
 up a Collective Security Pact to strengthen the Arab position
 vis-a-vis Israel.
 With the possibility of peace and normal trade with the
 Arabs once again blocked, Israel is attempting to raise the
 specter of a second Arab invasion in order to mobilize world
 opinion and to induce US Zionists to contribute even. more
 generously to the current United Jewish Appeal.
 Thus the vicious cycle of accusation and counter-accusa-
 tion has been resumed, the belief that. an arms race exists is
 promoting an actual arms race, and the armistice atmosphere
 is becoming more strained. With peace .apparently unattainable,
 the completely negative relationship which the Arabs appear
 bent on maintaining is beginning to produce in Israel a psychology
 of desperation which may in time provoke a violent resolution of
 the current impasse. This feeling of-desperation will fade or grow
 in proportion to Israel's success or failure in solving its economic
 problems, which at present seem as formidable as ever.

 Unemployment Problem   Unemployment continues to be the
 nation's most serious problem
 and may reach critical proportions within a few weeks unless
 the government can obtain additional funds for emergency
 measures. During the winter the government made limited
 efforts to care for the unemployed, but destitute peasants
 from, the provinces continue to migrate to the cities, where
 severe industrial unemployment has existed for some months.
 For example, some 20,000 jobless are concentrated at the
 single town of Karaj, outside Tehran. The USSR is making
 strong propaganda efforts to exploit the situation, and Iranian
 sources suggest that Soviet or Tudeh agents are encouraging
 the movement of the peasants to the cities. Many peasants
 will'piobably return to the land during summer, and others
 Will-
 .be given public works jobs, but more frequent and more
 violent. demonstrations among the unemployed may take place
 unless the government takes more effective measures than
 it has in the past. Although Prime Minister All Mansur
 stated that immediate steps would be taken to provide addi-
 tional jobs in the construction of roads and railroads, it is
 questionable whether the government can provide emergency
 help on a large-scale basis wihbut making serious inroads
 into funds earmarked for the Seven Year Plan. With the
 1949-50, budget already showing a reported deficit of approxi-
 mately 11 million pounds sterling, the government has
 borrowed 2,900,000 pounds sterling from the Seven Year
 Plan Organization to pay normal salaries and to finance
 current relief projects, and maybe compelled?to borrow ..
 further from the present remaining sterling balances of the
 Plan for emergency relief purposes.

 Party Purge   Friction between the Stalinist leadership
 and anti-Stalinist factions in the middle
 echelons of the Chinese Communist Party may'soon lead
 to a public purge of selei ted anti-Stalinist Party figures.
 There is no reliable evidence, however, that the purge will
 extend to the Politburo or to the major Chinese Communist
 military commanders.
 Party Chairman Mao Tse-tung has not wavered in
 his Stalinist orientation and his leadership does not appear
 .to be challenged either by such firm Stalinists as. the Party's
 number two man, Liu Shao-chi, or such allegedly lukewarm
 Stalinists as Chou EnRlai. Even if a dispute should arise in
 the Politburo, it would probably be resolved, as in the past,
 without violence.
 Within the Party's military hierarchy, it is not
 known whether any of the major field commanders are in .
 fact anti-Stalinist. These military leaders, owing to the
 size and importance of their various commands, are still
 in a strong position in relation to the non-military Party
 leadership, and the Peiping regime will probably proceed with
 caution in efforts to restrict and reduce their authority further.
 None of the military leaders seems a likely candidate for purg-
 ing at least until the completion of military operations against
 the Nationalists, which should see them safely through 1950.
 Beyond that time, Peiping will presumably be reluctant to take
 action against any one of the military leaders until assured
 of the fidelity or neutrality of all the rest, and until con-
 vinced that political indoctrination has made the troops loyal
 primarily to Peiping rather than to their old commanders.

 INDONESIA
 Makassar Revolt  The complete collapse of the Makassar
 rebellion following the landing of USI
 forces in Celebes is an important step in. consolidation of
 USI authority over East Indonesia and places the USI in an
 Q             advantageous position to further its ambitions to create a
 unitary nation at a forthcoming conference with the states
 Q             of East Indonesia, East Sumatra, and the Jogjakarta Republic.
 Failure of the USI to act energetically on the Makassar issue
 might have encouraged East Indonesian leaders to persist
 in their efforts and the rebellion might have spread to other
 autonomous.elements _throughout'the islands. The USI has
 Q             now announced plans to station its forces throughout all
 East Indonesia. While sporadic resistance from former
 Netherlands Indies Army (KNIL) soldiers and local police
 units may be encountered on Ambon, Northern Celebes, and
 .Timor, it appears that no further serious challenge to USI
 authority. will be offered by the East Indonesian Government.
 Military Successes  Having successfully concluded the
 campaign against organized Karen
 resistance northeast of Rangoon, the Burmese Army is now
 concentrating its efforts against Communist dissidents con-
 trolling areas along the Irrawaddy River. Government
 troops are making good progress in their southward drive
 and have hopes of capturing the Communist "capital" of
 Prome before the mid-May monsoons, thus reopening the
 Irrawaddy to north-south traffic. Communist forces will
 probably.avoid a pitched battle and, like the Karens, strive
 to maintain their forces intact for guerrilla warfare. Even
 .though such resistance may continue following Prome's

 fall, the successful completion of the Irrawaddy operation
 will constitute a major triumph for the Burmese Govern-
 ment. Burmese prestige at home and abroad will be en-
 hanced; trade and communication on the most important
 trade route in Burma will be re-established; and a severe
 blow will have been struck at Communist hopes for, the
 establishment of a "resistance base" and.tlie receipt of
 .organized assistance from foreign Communist groups.
 French Tactics  The imminent replacement of Nguyen
 Phan Long.as Premier of Vietnam by
 the less popular Tran Van Huu is apparently the result of
 French displeasure over Premier Long's determination
 .that Vietnam prepare its own list of US aid requirements
 without French advice. French interference with the free
 .choice of government officials by the Vietnamese will
 further impede efforts. to establish a stable non-Communist
 government in Vietnam. Although the French may. remove
 Long ostensibly because of the need for installing "a gov-
 ernment. which can govern," actually Long has not been
 given a .chance to demonstrate his ability, especially as
 the Bao Dal regime has not received control over impor-
 tant sources of revenue promised by the French as long
 ago as 1 January 1949. Furthermore, the most Important
 source of revenue--the customs tariff--remains in French
 hands pending the outcome of the still, deferred Interstate
 .Conference. The absence of even a rudimentary Vietnamese
 parliament (promised In a decree of July 1949) has rendered

 Caribbean Unrest   The recent approval by the Council
 of the Organization of American States
 of its investigating committee's proposed resolutions re;-
 garding the Caribbean situation constitutes a further step
 toward restoring tranquility in the Caribbean. The Council's
 prompt and decisive action on all of the committee's recom-
 mendations, including the threat to apply the sanctions en-
 visaged in the Rio treaty, will probably curb future hostile
 activities by the countries implicated in the current disputes.
 Even the most effective implementation of the resolutions
 adopted by the Council, however, cannot be expected to
 solve such fundamental causes of Caribbean unrest as the
 long-standing struggle between democratic and authoritarian
 elements throughout the area and the limited opportunities
 for individual advancement outside of political and military
 activities. On the other hand, this second invocation of the
 Rio treaty has strengthened it against more serious tests that
 might arise in the future, and the high degree of solidarity in
 the Council's voting (only Chile and Honduras abstained on
 one resolution) is evidence of the unity on this matter among
 the American states:.
 Communist Gains   Although Communist strength and influence
 in Latin America remain generally at a
 low level, .the gradually declining trend which became evident
 in 1947 has reversed recently in at least three countries and
 has leveled out in a number Of others. The Communists have
 made political gains recently in Guatemala, El Salvador, and
 Cuba, where major political parties have accepted Communist
 collaboration. Such collaboration has reduced Communist
 political isolation, making anti-Communist action more

 difficult; has increased Communist respectability, thus
 enhancing Communist ability to attract new recruits and
 to collect funds; and has put certain politicians under
 obligation to them. The declining trend has leveled off
 in Brazil, Bolivia, and Chile, although continued repressive
 action has at least prevented the Communists from making
 gains. While it is true that these recent developments do
 not represent a large change in Communist strength and
 influence, they are significant as signs of possible future
 additions to the already irritating though minor Communist
 capabilities in Latin America.
 STAT

 Q
 A key issue at the forthcoming North Atlantic Treaty
 (NAT) Council meeting will be the crucial problem of how to
 finance plans for the defense of the North Atlantic area. The
 staggering cost of even minimal defensive strength (estimated
 at several billion dollars) and its possible impact on the. still
 shaky European economy have opened the eyes of NAT mem-
 hers- to the importance of adequate financing. The chief
 participants realize that. the Brussels Treaty machinery
 broke down at this point when the Foreign Ministers proved
 .unwilling to put up enough money for the Defense Ministers'
 plans. This problem must now be faced in the wider NAT
 context, and in the atmosphere of greater urgency created
 by Soviet atomic development and increased Soviet. power and
 aggressiveness.
 All participants. recognize that only the highest degree
 of joint effort can provide the extensive rearmament required
 and overcome the economic weakness of the European NAT
 members. Despite this realization, however, progress will
 .be blocked by continuing difficulties involved in fully integrat-
 ing military efforts and European reluctance to make substan-
 tial outlays for defense. Defense budgets are still prepared on
 primarily national lines instead of being adjusted to common
 .needs; there is still an effort to create national military self-
 sufficiency through balanced forces; each nation tends to prefer
 its own weapons, etc. Moreover, the various members are
 not making comparable outlays for the common defense. To
 meet. this problem, the Dutch and Italians, for example, have
 suggested some form of common financial "pool."
 While in general willing to undertake whatever limited
 rearmament is within their capabilities, the Europeans also
 insist on giving priority to economic recovery. Moreover,
 r'I
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/21 : CIA-RDP78-01617AO02300150001-9
 n.
 such countries as the UK, the Netherlands, and Denmark
 (the first two already spend a large portion of their budgets
 on defense) do not believe that they can spend much more.
 This conflict between defense and economic recovery will
 become a major obstacle if the European. defense effort
 .increases much beyond its present scale.
 It is, thus clear that transforming the NAT into an
 effective military instrument will be far more difficult than
 .the initial planning phase now finished. 'Concerned over
 .financial problems, the Europeans will anxiously seek US
 leadership and financial'support.. They will expect the US
 to take the initiative in working toward a more coordinated
 defense effort and in determining the relative emphasis on
 economic recovery and defense. In this respect, they will
 expect the US'to compensate for any major diversion of
 European funds from recovery to rearmament.
