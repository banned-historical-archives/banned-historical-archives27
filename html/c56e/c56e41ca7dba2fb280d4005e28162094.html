ITALIAN COMMUNISTS OPEN NEWS AGENCY. The Italian Communist Party (PCI) 
inaugurated in October a nes and feature service called PARCOMIT. 
Alessandro Curzi, head of the PC1's information office, is the director 
of PARCOMIT, which has its headquarters at 4 Via delle Botteghe Oscure, 
Rome. The first bulletin issued by PARCOMIT (dated 17 October) stated 
that it was to be published daily and would specialize in political 
information. According to Agence France Presse,PARCOMIT will also pro-
vide extensive coverage on labor matters. (Unclassified) (See ML of 
26 September and 24 October 1966, BPGs 200 and 202, for other developments 
in the Italian Communist press.)

Briefly Noted 
Is a Torrent of Repe-
titious Propaganda  
Counterproductive? 
"We should find out 
precisely the results 
and effects of our 
regular publicity channels and avoid 
repeating in the same way in enter-
prises what our colleagues have al-
ready heard on the radio or read in 
the newspapers." This was stated in 
an article in issue No. 23 (1966) 
of the East German theoretical journal 
NEUER WEG by Werner Lamberz, head of 
the Agitation Department of the 
Socialist Unity (i.e., Communist) 
Party Central Committee. He also 
argued that, since Marxism-Leninism 
has been taught for many years now 
in East German schools, Party orga-
nizations should adopt new goals in 
ideological work: "When someone has 
already been trained in higher math-
ematics at school, you shouldn't later 
go and teach him two-times-two!" 
Herr Lamberz went on to say that 
"this does not mean that oral agita-
tion and propaganda [i.e., propaganda 
conducted by agitators in the factories] 
are losing significance," but he 
cited statistics showing the scope 
of the mass media propaganda barrage 
which falls on East German workers 
(81/2 million out of a total population 
of 17 million) away from their jobs: 
there are 38 daily newspapers published 
in well over 6 million copies, 8 
illustrated magazines and weekly news-
papers published in almost 4 million 
copies, 5 radio programs on the air a 
total of 1,220 hours a week, and 72 
hours of television programs a week. 
He suggested that this frees the 
agitator to do his real job of 
giving an "informed interpretation" 
of Party and Government decisions. 
Certainly the saturation point 
has been reached in boring the 
East German workers with the "two-
times-two" of the "glories" of Com-
munism. Lamberz pointed out in 
his article that statistics on 
the numbers of meetings and semi-
nars were not so important as suc-
cess in convincing people, and for 
this one must consider "whether 
the right methods were used, whether 
one interested or bored people, and 
whether or not one had reached the 
mind and heart of the fellow-workers." 
Whether or not the East German 
agitprop workers succeed in any of 
this, Lamberz' suggestions are valid  
not only for them but for other  
propagandists as well.

East Germans Seize

and Send them to North

East German authorities 
advised West Berliners 
in early December that many of the 
Christmas gift packages they had 
mailed to relatives and friends on 
the other side of the Wall had been 
confiscated "because regulatiops were 
disregarded." Two of the chief "vio-
lations" cited by East German authori-
ties were the mailing of a baby's toys

to a mother or a woman's bathrobe to 
a man; everything must be for the sole 
use of the addressee on the parcel, 
postal regulations were said to require. 
The West Berliners received cards 
notifying them of the confiscation and 
informing them that the East German 
authorities had "as a matter of course 
put your package at the disposal of the 
freedom fighters in Vietnam." 
We call attention to this flagrant 
violation of the Yuletide spirit, stress-
ing that this is just one more example 
(in previous years East Germany had sent 
similarly confiscated packages to "free-
dom fighters"in Cuba) of the Communist 
puppet regime's disregard for their 
people whenever they want to make a 
politically motivated propaganda move 
in the battle of nerves with the West. 
We point out that in all probability, 
none of the packages was actually sent 
to Vietnam -- the limited transport 
facilities are too clogged with more 
"vital" things, such as weapons.

U.S. Pamphlets Dis-
tributed At Meeting  
Addressed by North  
Vietnamese Ambassador 
A student meeting in 
Aarhus, Denmark, on 
13 December featured a talk by the North 
Vietnamese Ambassador to Moscow followed 
by his answers to a few questions asked 
by the audience (hampered by the need 
to translate them from Danish to Russian 
and then to Vietnamese). At the end of 
the meeting the chairman, according to 
the independent Copenhagen newspaper 
INFORMATION, expressed appreciation to 
those who had been "kind enough" to dis-
tribute Danish-language material on Viet-
nam to the audience. 
This Danish-language material 
was actually "The War in South Viet-
nam and the American Freedom Offensive, 
a Chronology," published by USIS 
Copenhagen. Although such unusual 
opportunities as this to tell the U.S. 
side of the story about Vietnam do not 
occur everyday, nevertheless everyone 
should be constantly alert to determine 
what occasions -- even the most un-
expected ones -- are suitable for 
countering the growing tide of Commu-
nist and other anti-U.S. propaganda 
about Vietnam.

Contrasting Poli-
cies towards  
Western Journalists  
in East European  
Satellites  
The December 1966 
issue of the monthly, Analyse, published 
in Vienna, contained a long article 
based on the experiences of Vienna --
based Austrian and other Western 
journalists which contrasts the atti-
tudes of five East European Communist 
governments towards foreign (non-
Communist) correspondents. Poland 
and Hungary, which for several years 
had displayed a fairly tolerant atti-
tude towards Western correspondents, 
have noticeably altered this .attitude 
in the past year: Poland makes jour,. 
nalists wait at least two weeks for 
visas; Hungary, which had instituted 
"permanent" visas with unlimited re-
entry privileges in 1964, has abolished 
them as of 1 January 1967, and in 
addition has refused visas to some 
Western journalists. Moreover, in 
recent months, journalists have 
encountered an unfriendly attitude 
on the part of Hungarian officialdom. 
Albania, as might be expected, dis-
courages visits by Western journalists,

Rumania and Czechoslovakia have both

of course is also a way of influencing 
them.

#9 22 November 1966-2 January 1967 
CNRONOLOGY 
WORLD COMMUNIST AFFAIRS 
November 22 and continuing,: Chinese Communist media reflect the re-
gime's intense involvement in the confused events of the 'cultural 
revolution" (CR), -- now often called the "great proletarian CR" 
(GPCR). On the 22nd, for example, PEOPLE'S DAILY carries two articles 
and an "ed. note" attacking a new 'anti-Party element in the field of 
history, Hou Wai-1u," a historian and member of the Acad.of Sciences. 
Among other misdeeds, in Vol. IV of his COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF CHI-
NESE PHILOSOPHY completed in 1959, he ''created a false Chen Liang who 
dared to 'scold' the emperor;" 
November 22 & continuing Soviet media markedly increase both volume 
and sharpness of their reporting and commentary on China and the CR --
and the Chinese oust 3 of the 6 Soviet journalists in China (D 16). 
On the 22nd, for example, TASS reports that the Hung Weipings Med 
Guards"] continue their outrages.... In their efforts to fan anti-
Soviet hysteria, they have launched a slanderous campaign against two 
more socialist countries, Hungary and Bulgaria." (See #8 for causes 
of Chinese attacks on H & B.) PRAVDA same day carries one of a con-
tinuing series of self-righteous editorials -- "Our Banner Is Inter-
nationalism" -- condemning 'the splitting course of the CCP leaders" 
and justifying a new "international meeting of Communists." Separate 
items during this period cite more than a dozen national parties, 
mostly in LA, as publicly supporting the CPSU against the CCP, often 
with endorsement of an international meeting (this in addition to 
speecLes at the Hungarian Party Congress -- see Nov 28-Dec 3). 
Media of EE countries critical of the Chicoms follow a similar 
line in extensive reporting and commentary, especially the Czechs and 
Yugoslays. On the 22nd, for example, Prague CTK reports heavy damage 
to a Tientsin factory due to RG actions and Belgrade TAEYUG reports at 
length on internal conflicts among the RG, violent battles in factories, 
etc. 
November 22:  Djakarta Radio reports: "about 700 Gestapu-PKI fugitives  
are now in Peking and are engaged in directing a political 
war against the new order in Indonesia."... 
November 22 and continuing: The splitting process among Japanese Com-
munists and front leaders continues (see Nos. 7 & 8): 
JCP daily AKAHATA on the 22nd announces the expulsion of "13 anti-
Party elements" residing in Peking (adding 4 more next day): the 
first-mentioned, Hiromi Takano, has lived there 28 years! "They have 
somewhat lost touch with the actual situation under which the Japanese 
working class and people have been living," says A. Tokyo KYODO adds 
that the JCP has thus far expelled about 60 members said to be pro-Peking.

-- Tokyo MAINICHI on the 22nd reports: "With the development of splits 
in a series of leftist mass organizations due to the JCP-CCP conten-
tion, four leaders of the pro-CCP group in tilt New Japanese Women's 
Association resigned on 21 November to form another organization." At 
a press conference in the office of the Japan-China Friendship Asso-
ciation (Orthodox) they branded the JWA "a sub-organization of the 
JCP, which is hostile toward China...." 
AKAHATA on the 23rd carries a "declaration by the 10th general 
meeting of the Japan Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee on 22 November" 
which rejoices that the Committee preserved its unity when "schismatic 
activities are being stepped up against the Committee both from within 
and from outside." 
- AKAHATA on December 4 announces expulsion of Masayuki Yasui, Commu-
nist bookstore president and a director of the JCFA for anti-Party 
factional activities. 
-- Tokyo ASAHI on the itth reports that four recently-expelled pro-
Chinese dissidents left on the 3rd for China, where they have been 
invited to "establish for the first time a friendly trading company --
Toko Trading Co. -- as a route to supply funds to the China-affiliated 
... faction." 
- NCNA on Dec. 5 publicizes a lengthy report on a meeting of the 
Standing Council of the JCFA (Orthodox) in Tokyo 3-4: it decided to 
"set up its branches in all prefectures throughout Japan before the 
end of the year and to convene a national congress in April of next 
year." 
- AKAHATA on the 11th announces the expulsion of Yuichi Kobayashi, 
former chairman of the Japan Journalist Congress, for anti-Party acti-
vities: he "blindly followed the dictate of a particular foreign force, 
bringing a serious schismatic trend into the Party by organizing a 
splinter group called the Japan Journalist League." 
November 22 through December  11: NCNA on the 23rd reports from the 
Peking-sponsored "Economic and Trade Fair" in Nagoya Nov. 19-Dec. 11: 
"hooligans of Jap. right-wing organizations, with the connivance of 
the Sato Govt., yesterday carried out rabid sabotage activities" at 
the exhibit, beat up exhibit personnel, distributed anti-Chinese hand-
bilis, and even made a hullabaloo abusing Chinese state leaders," --
"right in front of large numbers of police sent out by the Jap. 
authorities." The official Chinese protest included the Soviets in 
its charge: "We solemnly declare that the Chinese and Japanese peoples 
will never permit the heinous crimes of following U.S. imperialism and 
collaborating with Soviet modern revisionism and the reactionaries of 
all countries in disrupting Sino-Japanese friendship." At the Fair's 
close, the Chinese claim a great success, with attendance of over 
2 million.

on President Liu Shao-chi and Party SecyGen Teng Hsiao-ring: Liu is 
called "a time bomb' menacing Mao and "the Chinese Khrushchev." Mos-
cow's "Radio Peace and Progress" in English says that "rowdies of the 
so-called Red Guard have opened special detention centers where they 
torture people who have been illegally detained. The teenage hooli-
gans practice similar outrages at individual factories and enterprises...." 
November 23 & Dec 15: NCNA rebuts PRAVDA correspondent Mayevsky's 
Nov. 21 Moscow press conference account of Chinese hostility which 
forced the M-headed Soviet friendship delegation to cut short its 
visit to China (see #8). "Citing incidents, Sino-Soviet Friendship 
Association council member Kang Chi-min told how Mayevsky and his 
party, on many occasions, picked quarrels and even openly interfered 
in China's internal affairs, -- and attacked China's GPCR and foreign 
policy." After the Soviets "openly slandered China's great CR by saying 
that it was 'destroying culture' and 'had no connection at all with 
proletarian revolution," the Red Guards, "their patience tried too 
far, refuted these statements by presenting the facts. At this moment, 
M. brazenly charged the RG with being 'anti-Soviet' and headed a demon-
strative walkout." Kang says that the Soviet visitors repeatedly left 
places in the middle of visits, lodged "protests" without reason, and 
issued statements threatening to terminate their visit. "Finally, they 
went so far as to decide unilaterally to stop their visit and flagrantly 
leave China ahead of schedule...." 
"The Soviet revisionist leading clique, which is doing every 
kind of vile thing, will be ultimately overthrown bythe Soviet 
people." 
November 24: CTK reports from Tokyo on an interview published there 
by a KYODO agency correspondent with a 15-year-old Peking schoolgirl: 
"The Red Guards will rise in Washington, Moscow, and Tokyo, 
as well as in London. The Soviet citizens will surely join the 
anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle of the CPR." 
NCWA reports at length a "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio 
broadcast of the 22nd which exults in the "brilliant victories" of the 
"People's Armed Forces' against "U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the 
Thanom-Praphat clique," in Thailand. The PAF claim that in this year 
up to mid-November they have fought 120 battles with the enemy, killing 
and wounding 300 of them, including more than 20 army and police 
officers. 
November 25: Radio Moscow satirizes the Mao cult with the following 
dead-pan report: 
"Recently two soccer matches took place in Shanghai between 
a local team and a team from the Congo (Brazzaville). On the 
first day, 30,000 spectators came to the match with booklets

containing Mao Tse-tung's quotations and chanted them. The 
Congo team won, 3-1. 
"At the second match, before the match and during the half, the 
spectators chanted Mao Tse-tUng's quotations. The Congo won 
again, 21." 
November 25-26: In what NCNA calls "the eighth and last review until 
spring next year,' 2.5 million RedllGuards get a glimpse of Mao and 
Lin Piao (also the beleaguered Lin,Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping). 
They included "Long March" teams shid to have come on foot from "13 
provinces and autonomous regions in the north, east, northeast, and 
central-south China, including one from Inner Mongolia, 850 km (about 
500 miles) away, which carried "a simple mimeograph machine which they 
used ... to duplicate bulletins and keep the peasants on the way posted 
on the CR." 
November 26: Radio Moscow describes the "depressing picture'' of the 
"shivering children and adolescents" marching in the snow in Peking. 
It also says that "the protests of the working people of China against 
the outrages and sometimes crimes of the Red Guards have put the leaders 
of the CCP into a state of confusion," again referring to cases of 
torture, invasion of factories, etc. 
Radio Peking, continuing the Chinese campaign against persecution 
of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia, says that "the Chinese Govt has once 
again lodged a strong protest and sternly pointed out that in pig-
headedly stepping up anti-Chinese activities, the Indonesian reaction-
aries will only suffer the consequences arising from its own actions." 
NCNA on the same day reports that "the Soviet revisionist leading clique 
has recently given political and economic support to the Indonesian 
rightwing military regime in an attempt to help it out of its domestic 
and international difficulties." 
November 27: Major PRAVDA editorial, "On the Events in China," goes 
back to the August 11th plenum of the CCP/CC, which "officially corro-
borated the great-power and anti-Leninist course of Mao Tse-tung and 
his group aimed against the unity of socialist countries and the entire 
WCM." 
"the arrogant attempt of the Chinese leaders to declare Mao 
Tse-tung's views the summit of M-L and to impose them on the WCM 
cannot but evoke a legitimate protest of the Communists of the 
whole world." 
PRAVDA specifically blasts Lin Piao's declarations that "Mao is 
much higher than Marx, Engels, Lenin" and that "the classics of M-L 
should consist 99 percent of works by Mao." 
Rebuffing all CPSU efforts to improve relations and restore unity, 
PRAVDA says, the Chinese leaders "openly declare that 'there is no place

in a united front' for the USSR," 'hurl slanderous fabrications at 
the USSR," and "concentrate all fire on the CPSU and the Soviet Union, 
whose 'defeat' is the declared prerequisite of the struggle against 
imperialism." 
"A systematic brainwashing of the population of China in an 
anti-Soviet spirit is now goilig on on an unprecedented scale.... 
Chinese leaders are trying to spread their anti-Soviet activity 
to the territory of our country. Tens of radio stations are 
incessantly beaming hostile and slanderous propaganda at the 
Soviet Union." 
Deploring the "steady curtailment" of cooperation between the two 
countries, P notes that "at the same time the trade turnover of the 
CPR with capitalist countries is growing year by year. 
Asking "With whom does the Chinese leadership want to rally?" 
P says: 
On the one hand, they are trying to impose upon the fra-
ternal parties a course which would lead to the constant aggrava-
tion of the international situation and ultimately to wary alleg-
edly in the name of world revolution. On the other hand, the 
Peking leaders themselves carry on a line designed for remaining  
aside from the struggle with imperialism.... 
Guided by the principle, 'The ends justify the means,' the 
CCP leaders have armed themselves with the most unsavory tricks  
and methods of political struggle.... 
The repeated calls by the CCP leadership for 'organizational 
demarcation' ... were to serve to create a bloc of parties and 
groupings headed by the CCP. But ... they have no one in the 
Communist movement with whom to form a bloc.... 
The pretensions of the Chinese leadership to establish its 
control over the international derlocratic organizations, the WPC, 
the WFTU, the women's, youths, and other organizations -- did not 
succeed.... 
The Chinese leadership's plans in relation to the national 
liberation movement have not been realized. The major failures 
of Chinese policy ... have seriously alarmed the progressive forces 
in the young national states...." 
All of this has caused,"as the Chinese press admits, growing dis-
content among party cadres, the intelligentsia, the army and broad 
strata of the Chinese people." But "instead of ... changing their 
mistaken course, Mao Tse-tung and his group have set out on the road 
of further development of this course, taking it to extremes. They saw 
the Party active, the Party cadres, as the chief obstacle in their 
way." However,

... the Party cadres, who have passed through the school of the 
revolution, have begun to understand, despite the anti-Soviet 
campaign,... the full extent df the harm for China itself of the 
line directed toward a split with the Soviet Union and the other 
socialist countries. 
It is difficult to deceive them with fabrications about some 
sort of 'plot' between the SU and the US, about 'the restoration 
of capitalism' in our country., That is why Mao and his group  
adopted a course of denigratioll and destruction of the Party cadres, 
the best representatives of the working class and the intelli-
gentsia, using for this aim part of the student youth and the 
military administrative apparatus. 
Coming up against opposition to their course, Mao and his 
supporters did not flinch from striking at the leading role of  
the Party. in the state....' 
November 23 and continuing: Chinese media continue on the theme of 
Soviet-U.S. "collution" in NCNA releases on: 
-- Nov. 28, pegged to visits of Canadian and British Foreign Ministers 
to Moscow; 
-- Dec. 1 (also PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on 2), and again on 21 (PD 
editorial on 22), pegged to UN General Assembly proceedings; 
Dce. 5, pegged to new Soviet loan of 970 million rubles "to the 
Indian reactionaries (which) is a component part of the new holy alli-
ance formed by the U.S. and the S.U...." 
-- Dec. 9, pegged to Soviet participation on a Singapore meeting of the 
"so-called Asian Advisory Committee of the US-controlled International 
Labor Organization," -- "the 11th time that the Soviet revisionist 
leading clique and the Chiang Kai-shek clique have sat at the same 
conference table in southeast Asia since October last year." 
-- Dec. 10,and 11, pegged to draft treaty on peaceful uses of outer 
space; 
-- Dec. 14, citing US press praise of Soviet moratorium on payment of 
Indonesian debt. 
-- Dec. 15 and 17, seeing Soviet "conspiracy of forcing peace talks on 
Vietnam by US bombing of Hanoi and then offering a bombing pause. 
-- Dec. 16, calling Japanese Premier Sato's Diet speech "chiming in" 
with US imperialism and Soviet revisionism "toward helping realize 
their fraud of 'forcing peace talks through bombing."'

Soviet media try to counter in a low key, following the Nov. 27 
PRAVDA line. Moscow's "Radio Peace and Progress" in English on the 
14th cites again Chen Yi's statements to a Japanese parliamentarian 
and some unidentified NYTIMES comments and reaches "the conclusion that 
the reports being spread in the West about the tacit agreement between 
China and the US really do have certain foundations." The same pro-
gram pushes the same line further on the 23rd, citing the NYTIMES again, 
George Kennan ("well known as a hard-core anti-Communist"), and Prof. 
Barnett of Columbia. Again on the 27th, it cites "well-known NYTIMES 
observer Harry Schwartz." Meanwhile, in Mandarin to the Chinese people, 
RM on Nov. 30 recounts UN action on China's admission, emphasizing that 
the Peking propagandists, who are desperately trying to undermine 
Soviet state policy in the eyes of the Chinese people," have avoided 
any mention of Soviet support of China's right to representation: on 
Dec. 17, it rebuts NCNA's charges of collusion in agreeing to peaceful 
use of outer space. 
November 28-Dec 3: The Hungarian Party's 9th Congress is held in Buda-
pest, with only 32 foreign Communist or workers party representatives 
in attendance. Kadar's keynote speech condemns Chinese actions and 
policies and approves a "great conference" for which "conditions are 
ripening," -- but adds that there is no need to excommunicate anyone. 
The Chinese and Albanians would be welcome, but if they cut themselves 
off, we cannot "wait to the end of time for a broader conference." 
Brezhnev likewise emphasizes the aim of unity and chastises imperialists 
for spreading "absolute nonsense' about the intent to excommunicate 
anyone. PRAVDA's round-up on Dec. 3 lists as supporting a world con-
ference Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, France (all repeated from 
the Bulgarian conference in Nov.), Mongolia, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, 
Greece (these five newly named), "and many others." Same report also 
quotes E. German and Spanish delegates as favoring a conference. 
November 29: The ambassadors or charges of the five Soviet-aligned 
East European countries walk out of an Albanian National Day reception 
in Peking in protest against an attack on the Soviet leadership by 
Albanian ambassador. Representatives of Rumania, N. Korea, and 
N. Vietnam stay. 
A long Moscow LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentary on the Chinese CR 
says: "It is strange, however, that neither the working class nor the 
hundreds of millions of peasants are taking part in this campaign which 
is called 'proletarian.'" 
November 30: A V. Vasilyev article in Soviet Ar daily KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA (Red Star), "Behind the facade of the CR, tells how the Chinese  
Army was purged of "men disagreeing with Mao's military propositions" 
as well as "military specialists advocating studying the experience 
of the Soviet Army" in order to make the Army a "docile mechanism for 
implementing the ideas and instructions of Mao Tse-tung."

A brief item in French CP daily L'HUMANITE, "Is the UNR Preparing 
Pro-Chinese Candidates?" implies charge that the Gaullists are colla-
borating with the pro-Chinese Communist dissidents to set up 'diver-
sionary candidates' to defeat regular PCF candidates. 
December 1: Presenting a 'hero award" to the Black Sea port of Novor-
ossisk, Politburo member Kirilenko publicly condemns the "great-power, 
anti-Leninist course" of the CCP leadership. 
AP correspondent Bradsher reports from Moscow that, according to 
"informed sources," semi-publicmeelings  are being held under CPSU 
auspices to spread information about Soviet-Chinese relations to the 
Soviet people. "Speakers go beyond what has been published in the 
increasingly strident press campaign against China. They say Chinese  
forces ... have crossed the Soviet borders and tried to build instal-
lations.... Speakers accuse China of having a secret agreement with 
the U.S.: if the Soviet Union and China get into war, the U.S. agrees  
not to help Moscow(!).' 
NCNA describes the struggle waged by the Chinese delegation at 
"the Fifth International Conference of Agricultural., Forestry, and  
Plantation Workers" in East Berlin, 8-12 November, where "they force-
fully exposed the ugly countenance of the Soviet leading group as 
accomplices of U.S. imperialism and as scabs." The Soviets "resorted 
to lies, calumny, bribery, and other shameless methods," "used such 
high-handed, undemocratic means as cutting off the loudspeaker and 
creating disturbances," etc. Thus, they succeeded in expelling from 
leading trade union posts such (pro-Chinese) leaders as the Ceylonese 
Sanmugathasan, and the Indonesian Tjugito, the Indian Lyallpuri." 
December 1-9: Soviet Premier Kosygin is feted by De Gaulle on an 
official visit which journalists see as "more show than content." 
Soviet media comment that "the expansion of Soviet-French relations 
opens up new opportunities for putting into practice general European 
cooperation of all the states on our continent." (Quote from PRAVDA 
on the 6th.) 
December 3: Two TABS releases describe further Red Guard outrages and

December 3-4 and continuim: Several weeks of unrest caused by Chinese

NCNA reports 'incomplete statistics" of 107 Chinese killed or wounded, 
including 7 dead. Mainland Chinese demonstrate and media denounce the 
"despicable fascist atrocities of the Port. imperialists"; PEOPLE'S

comply with all the just demands put forward by the Chinese side." 
Chinese gunboat patrols off Macao are reinforced. On the 20th, NCNA

the demands but warns that the Chinese departments concerned and the 
masses of Chinese'' will be watching closely for implementation of the 
demands. If you talk one way and act another,... (etc.) you will be 
doubly punished." IZVESTIYA steps in on Dec 23 with an I. Gavrilov 
article says that "Peking did not use this opportunity to put an end 
to Port. rule in Macao" because the Macao operation is so profitable  
for the Chinese. "The conciliation with the Port. colonialists in 
Macao serves as additional proof that Peking's talk about the need to 
fight colonialism does not correspond to its deeds.' Radio Moscow 
continues the same line on the 24th. 
December 4: PEOPLE'S DAILY devotes entire front page to a Nov. 28 
rally of 20,000 "revolutionary militants in the field of literature 
and the arts" at which it was announced that: (1) Mao's wife, Chiang  
Ching, had been appointed advisor on cultural work in the Ar; and 
(2) the Army has taken over the major performing arts companies -- the 
Peking Opera, the Philharmonic, the State Song and Dance Ensemble, etc. 
Chiang Ching's criticism of past errors and difficulties (treated as 
main event of rally) reveals that (1) CR initially hindered by opposi-
tion in old Propaganda Dept, Culture Ministry, and Peking City Commit-
tee; (2) some CR work teams hastily organized and sent out without 
Mao's permission; (3) Red Guard movement not well controlled; and 
(4) by implication, adherents of Mao line are in a minority, -- a point 
of great sensitivity in the Party. Also implies dissatisfaction with 
new Propaganda Dept chief and CR leader Tao Chu by conspicuously omit-
ting his name when praising comrades for support. 
Czech CTK reports from Peking on new posters and RG press items 
revealing that "the RG and revolutionary students will form an alli-

December 6-9: The 16th session of the WFTU General Council in Sofia 
has to cope with Chinese-Albanian attacks on the Yugoslav and Soviet 
revisionists (as acknowledged by ,Sofia BTA agency). Finally the Council 
on the 8th revoked the right of tAe Chinese delegation to participate  
in the session. NCNA furnishes a lurid detailed version of the "big 
anti-China scandal unparalleled in the history of the WFTU" on the 
9th. After the Council had denied the Chinese the right to speak, NCNA 
asserts, Han "took the floor and ekposed and denounced the vicious 
fascist-like move of the Soviet revisionists and their followers" and 
was supported by the Albanian, upon which the Soviets and Bulgarians 
"unleashed some strongmen ... who manhandled the Chinese and Albanian 
delegates.' NONA says that the delegations from Indonesia, Ceylon, 
N. Vietnam, S. Vietnam, N. Korea, Rumania, Cuba and Japan voted against  
the exclusion decision, while "not a few delegations" abstained. Radio

Peking rejoices in a new act of Maoist heroism: a Red Guard fell

Soviet media try to counter in a low key, following the Nov. 27 
PRAVDA line. Moscow's qRadio Peace and Progress" in English on the 
14th cites again Chen Yi's statements to a Japanese parliamentarian 
and some unidentified NYTIMES comments and reaches ?the conclusion that 
the reports being spread in the West about the tacit agreement between 
China and the US really do have certain foundations." The same pro-
gram pushes the same line further on the 23rd, citing the NYTIMES again, 
George Kennan ("well known as a hard-core anti-Communist"), and Prof. 
Barnett of Columbia. Again on the 27th, it cites "well-known NYTIMES 
observer Harry Schwartz." Meanwhile, in Mandarin to the Chinese people, 
RM on Nov. 30 recounts UN action on China's admission, emphasizing that 
"the Peking propagandists, who are desperately trying to undermine 
Soviet state policy in the eyes of the Chinese people," have avoided 
any mention of Soviet support of China's right to representation: on 
Dec. 17, it rebuts NCNA's charges of collusion in agreeing to peaceful 
use of outer space. 
November 28-Dec 3: The Party's 9th is held in Buda-
pest, with only 32 foreign Communist or workers party representatives 
in attendance. Kadar's keynote speech condemns Chinese actions and 
policies and approves a "great conference" for which "conditions are 
ripening," -- but adds that there is no need to excommunicate anyone. 
The Chinese and Albanians would be welcome, but if they cut themselves 
off, we cannot "wait to the end of time for a broader conference." 
Brezhnev likewise emphasizes the aim of unity and chastises imperialists 
for spreading "absolute nonsense" about the intent to excommunicate 
anyone. PRAVDA's round-up on Dec. 3 lists as supporting a world con-
ference Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, France (all repeated from 
the Bulgarian conference in Nov.), Mongolia, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, 
Greece (these five newly named), and many others." Same report also 
quotes E. German and Spanish delegates as favoring a conference. 
November 29: The ambassadors or charges of the five Soviet-aligned 
East European countries walk out of an Albanian National Day reception 
in Peking in protest against an attack on the Soviet leadership by 
Albanian ambassador. Representatives of Rumania, N. Korea, and 
N. Vietnam stay. 
A long Moscow LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentary on the Chinese CR 
says: "It is strange, however, that neither the working class nor the 
hundreds of millions of peasants are taking part in this campaign which 
is called 'proletarian." 
November 30: A V. Vasilyev article in Soviet Army daily KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA (Red Star), "Behind the facade of the CR," tells how the Chinese  
Army was purged of "men disagreeing with Mao's military propositions" 
as well as "military specialists advocating studying the experience 
of the Soviet Army" in order to make the Army a "docile mechanism for 
implementing the ideas and instructions of Mao Tse-tung."

A brief item in French CP daily L'HUMANITE, "Is the UNR Preparing 
Pro-Chinese Candidates?" implies charge that the Gaullists are colla-

December 1: Presenting a "hero award" to the Black Sea port of Novor-
ossisk, Politburo member Kirilenko publicly condemns the "great-power, 
anti-Leninist course" of the CCP leadership. 
AP correspondent Bradsher reports from Moscow that, according to 
"informed sources," semi-publicraeetings are being held under CPSU 
auspices to spread information about Soviet-Chinese relations to the 
Soviet people. "Speakers go beyond what has been published in the 
increasingly strident press campaigniagainst China. They say Chinese  
forces ... have crossed the Soviet borders and tried to build instal-
lations.... Speakers accuse China of having a secret agreement with 
the U.S.: if the Soviet Union and China get into war, the U.S. agrees  
not to help Moscow(I)." 
NCNA describes the struggle waged by the Chinese delegation at 
"the Fifth International Conference of Agricultural, Forestry, and  
Plantation Workers" in East Berlin, 8-12 November, where "they force-
fully exposed the ugly countenance of the Soviet leading group as 
accomplices of U.S. imperialism and as scabs." The Soviets "resorted 
to lies, calumny, bribery, and other shameless methods," "used such 
high-handed, undemocratic means as cutting off the loudspeaker and 
creating disturbances," etc. Thus, they succeeded in expelling from 
leading trade union posts such (pro-Chinese) leaders as the Ceylonese 
Sanmugathasan, and the Indonesian Tjugito, the Indian Lyallpuri." 
December 1-9: Soviet Premier Kosygin is feted by De Gaulle on an 
official visit which journalists see as "more show than content."

opens up new opportunities for putting into practice general European 
222peration of all the states on our continent." (Quote from PRAVDA 
on the 6th.) 
December 3: Two TASS releases describe further Red Guard outrages and 
clashes, and Czeck CTK reports a one-month extension of free transpor-

December 3-4 and continuing: Several weeks of unrest caused by Chinese 
militants in the Portuguese enclave of Macao lead to a bloody riot: 
NCNA reports 'incomplete statistics" of 107 Chinese killed or wounded, 
including 7 dead. Mainland Chinese demonstrate and media denounce the 
"despicable fascist atrocities of the Port. imperialists"; PEOPLE'S 
DAILY Commentator on the 11th 'lodges the strongest protest" and deli-
vers a "stern warning" that the Port. "must at once accept and fully 
comply with all the just demands put forward by the Chinese side." 
Chinese gunboat patrols off Macao are reinforced. On the 20th, NCNA

the demands but warns that "the Chinese departments concerned and the 
masses of Chinese will be watching closely for implementation of the 
demands. "If you talk one way and act another,... (etc.) you will be 
doubly punished." IZVESTIYA steps in on Dec 23 with an I. Gavrilov 
article says that "Peking did not use this opportunity to put an end 
to Port. rule in Macao" because the Macao operation is so profitable 
for the Chinese. "The conciliation with the Port. colonialists in 
Macao serves as additional proof that Peking's talk about the need to 
fight colonialism does not corresRpnd to its deeds.'' Radio Moscow 
continues the same line on the 24t1-
. 
December 4: PEOPLE'S DAILY devotes entire front page to a Nov. 28 
rally of 20,000 "revolutionary militants in the field of literature 
and the arts" at which it was annOunced that: (1) Mao's wife, Chiang  
Ching, had been appointed advisor on cultural work in the Army; and 
(2) the Army has taken over the major performing arts companies -- the 
Peking Opera, the Philharmonic, the State Song and Dance Ensemble, etc. 
Chiang Ching's criticism of past errors and difficulties (treated as 
main event of rally) reveals that (1) CR initially hindered by opposi-
tion in old Propaganda Dept, Culture Ministry, and Peking City Commit-
tee; (2) some CR work teams hastily organized and sent out without 
Mao's permission; (3) Ped Guard movement not well controlled; and

of great sensitivity in the Party. Also implies dissatisfaction with

December 6-9: The 16th session of the WFTU General Council in Sofia 
has to cope with Chinese-Albanian attacks on the Yugoslav and Soviet 
revisionists (as acknowledged by Sofia ETA agency). Finally the Council 
on the 8th revoked the right of the Chinese delegation to participate  
in the session. NCNA furnishes a lurid detailed version of the "big 
anti-China scandal unparalleled in the history of the WFTU" on the 
9th. After the Council had denied the Chinese the right to speak, NCNA 
asserts, Han "took the floor and exposed and denounced the vicious 
fascist-like move of the Soviet revisionists and their followers" and 
was supported by the Albanian, upon which the Soviets and Bulgarians 
'unleashed some strongmen ... who manhandled the Chinese and Albanian 
delegates." NCNA says that the delegations from Indonesia, Ceylon, 
N. Vietnam, S. Vietnam, N. Korea, Rumania, Cuba and Japan voted against  
the exclusion decision, while "not a few delegations" abstained. Radio 
Bucharest broadcasts a denunciation of the exclusion by the Rumanian

attempt to divert attention from Chinese obstruction which helps the 
aggressors in Vietnam. 
December 10: Claiming that it is rebutting lies of "Western news 
agencies," Hanoi VNA agency issues another "authorized" declaration: 
"The DRV Govt has many times affirmed that the CPR has always helped 
in transit, according to schedule, of all goods given to Vietnam as

Peking rejoices in a new act of Maoist heroism: a Red Guard fell 
through the ice into a lake; "out of their selflessness to help their 
class brother, many people rushed onto the lightly frozen lake and

acquiring practical experience at the scene of work. In the past the

Albanian Party daily ZERI I POPULLIT publishes an 18,000-word 
programmatic pamphlet of the Soviet Revolutionary Communists-Bolsheviks." 
The brief introductory note says that it was "distributed throughout 
the Soviet Union some time ago" and that, 'having received it with 
some delay for understandable reasons of difficult communications," 
and "after having removed some passages, we publish this important 
document in which "the Soviet Bolsheviks, continuers of the revolu-
tionary traditions of the Bolshevik Party of Lenin and Stalin, unmask 
the K. revisionist gang and launch an appeal to fight against it re-
gardless of any sacrifice." It begins by acknowledging that: 
"...The documents of the CCP and the Albanian Workers Party show 
throughout the road of concessions and of the betrayal of the 
interests of the social revolution on which the leadership of the 
CPSU embarked after the death of Stalin. Consequently, we our-
selves will frequently elaborate and repeat the theses of the  
Chinese and Albanian comrades...." 
Space precludes extensive review of this interesting document, but 
we quote a few of the most colorful passages: 
...If one compares Stalin with K, one cannot help thinking of 
Marx, who said that history repeats itself twice, the first time 
in the form of tragedy and later in the form of comedy... K is 
nothing more than a parody.... 
u ... Al]. those who now try to disguise Lenin as Jesus Christ should 
understand these words of Lenin --'We are revolutionaries on the 
side of the proletariat....' 
"And here we will dwell on the question of the 'persecution' 
carried out by Stalin. Gentlemen opportunists attempting to dis-
guise the social base of these persecutions try to present Stalin 
as a man who feared rivalry, arrested and executed everyone he 
regarded as a man of spirit. Undoubtedly, this is completely 
unfounded.... The revisionists ... have never seriously tried to 
understand the motives of these persecutions....

... Were there unjustified victims during the persecutions? We 
think there may have been, but whose fault was that? In the first 
place, the blame lies with the bureaucracy itself.... 
Stalin's attitude toward the excesses of that time are best 
seen in the fact that he had his Commissar for Internal Affairs, 
Yezhov, shot, solely for bureaucracy during the purges.. ..(i) 
"Look at the Soviet bureaucrats. Can there, here at home, 
be any real reelection of any responsible person; reelection not 
from the top -- by bureaucratic means -- but from the bottom by 
democratic method? 
Can there be any doubt about the total 5degeneration 
bureaucracy, and of the total elimination by it of all forms of 
social life and socialist conscience when one looks closely at our 
daily life today? A complete lack of any enthusiasm among the 
masses, complete indifference to work, social life transformed 
Into a farce, the complete domination of selfish principles, the 
crushing of everything living, active, fresh -- that is the sum 
total of the domination of the bureaucratic order.... 
But the Soviet bureaucrat is not a real bourgeois either, 
social conditions not allowing him to be one. He is an absurd 
paradox connected with the bourgeoisie.... This is why he whole-
heartedly endeavors to follow the "Western" way of life.... In 
private he surrounds his tortured soul with the ideas of the dregs 
of the bourgeois world and sees films which, because of their 
corruptive content, are banned even in bourgeois Europe. It is  
precisely from sash_ground that such avowed traitors to the home-
land as Penkovsky arise.... 
... One cannot but laugh when one hears them (the CPs of capitalist 
countries) boasting about their success, which they measure by the 
growth in the number of tarty members. If they only complement 
their program with the thesis that the founder of Communism was 
Jesus Christ, they will create a real possibility for having even 
the Pope in their ranks... .(i) 
... To overthrow  the bureaucratic order in the USSR, the revolu-
tionaries must be organized.... Obviously the new and truly pro-
letarian party can only be the Communist Bolshevik Party of the  
SU reborn.... 
... The hour has struck. From numerous and separate cells of the 
CP--Bolshevik of the SU to their fusion in a mighty lava which 
will sweep away the bureaucrats -- that is the way the Soviet Com-
munists must go.... Need it be said that heroes will be born out 
of this struggle?...

Japanese correspondents in Peking report new posters saying that 
Liu Shao-chi made a self-criticism at a "CC work conference" on 
23 November and that Teng Hsiao-ping had done so on 23 October. How-
ever, the poster denounces Liu's self-criticism as superficial and not 
at all serious. 
TANYUG Peking reports loudspeaker trucks branding Liu and Teng 
as leaders of the so-called black or anti-Mao line. "Mobile loud-
speakers also blared out the latest from Mrs. Mao, Chiang Ching, who 
demanded that all opponents of her husband's thinking be immediately  
arrested." TANYUG adds that it is clear that "a considerable majority  
of the oldest and best-known cadres from the top Party bodies still 
do not actively support the 'revolutionary minority' in the CR." 
December 27: PEOPLE'S DAILY (and other organs) features several

December 28 and Jan  2: NCNA arnounces from the port of Dairen that 
"the Soviet SS Zagorsk, which violated China's harbor regulations and

the Chinese harbor pilot, NCNA adds that: "Deliberately enlarging the 
incident, the representative of the Soviet Embassy in China openly 
supported this arrogant and unreasonable big-nation chauvinist atti-
tude of the Soviet captain." 
TABS on Jan. 2 publicizes a statement of the Soviet Maritime 
Ministry charging that the Chinese authorities "unlawfully detained" 
the Zagorsk on Dec. 8 and held her until the 28th on the "absolutely 
groundless charges that the Soviet ship had 'violated regulations.'"

ciled to their defeat." 
"Why were these persons who persist'. in the bourgeois reactionary 
line able for a time to hoodwink some people? They made use of the 
high prestige enjoyed by Chairman Mao.... They also made special 
efforts to spread the idea that people should obey the leadership of 
their immediate superiors unconditionally and in disregard of principle. 
Such an idea in essence advocates blind obedience and slavishness, and 
and it is opposed to M-L, Mao Tse-tung's thought." (!) 
It announces that "a new situation has developed in China's GPCR." 
"Vast numbers of workers and peasants have arisen. They are 
breaking through all obstacles to establish their own revolutionary

Acknowledging that "some muddleheaded people" think that the CR 
might impede production, it declares that "historical experience" 
shows that "production makes big headway wherever the CR is successful."

FINLAND: 
Soviets Still Critical of SOcial Democrats 1 
25X1 C1 Ob 
. SITUATION: When the Finnish Social emocratic Party' (SDP) formed 
a coalition government last May (see BPG Item #1026 of 6 June: "West 
European Communists Stress Popular Front Tactics: The Case of Finland") 
Soviet and other Communist propagandists mouthed pious hopes that this 
would open up a new era in Moscow-Helsinki relations, -which had been 
clouded in the past by continuing Soviet cHticism of SDP leaders and 
policies. 
An article in the September 1966 issue of the internationally distri-
buted WORLD MARXIST REVIEW (attached), fore example, reviewed the details 
of the unsuccessful efforts of the Finnish! Communist Party (FCP) to co-
operate with the SDP since shortly after Arid War II. It concludedby 
declaring that it would henceforth be the task of the FCP-"to see to it 
that the incipient cooperation with the Social Democrats is strengthened 
and developed all the way to joint struggle for socialist aims." 
Continuing this wooing of the Finnish! Socialists, the 21 September 
1966 issue of Moscow's NEW TIMES published a report on the impressions 
of a group Of Soviet tourists who visited 'Finland during the -summer, in-
cluding this passage of comment on the "improved" atmosphere which had 
been Observed since the FCP was taken into the government for the first 
time since 1948: 
"This sense of political realism finds concrete expression in the 
strong desire of the overwhelming majority of the people, and also 
of farsighted political and public leaders, for friendship and co-
operation with the Soviet people.... With the formation of a gov-
ernment representing the country's dsmocratic forces, Finnish public 
opinion now hopes for closer friendly relations with neighboring 
countries, first among them the Soviet Union, and for the strengthen-
ing of Finland's peaceable foreign policy." 
Less than 12 weeks later, however, M scow's PRAVDA shattered these 
dreams of friendship and cooperation by pAblishing an article which criti-
cized the November congress of the SDP fo having failed to "reach decisions 
which would express the desire of many Finnish Social Democrats to turn the 
party's policy decisively on a new road and to renounce everything old which 
has kept the party backward and has brought its policy closer to the anti-
Communist policy of reactionary circles in Finland and abroad."

(The text of the PRAVDA attack, as broadcast by Radio Moscow 
in Finnish, is attached. The printed version of the article is 
almost exactly the same as the broadcast version with the addition 
of explanatory passages [for the Soviet domestic audiences] such 
as one in the penultimate paragraph which describes the "Honka al-
liance," which the SDP helped to form, as a group representing the 
"forces of extreme right reaction.") 
Several stands which the SDP took at its November 1966 congress came 
in for particular criticism in PRAVDA: failure of the SDP to condemn West 
German "revanchism," failure to disassociate itself from the pro-Western 
line of the Socialist International (see BPG Items #1027 of 6 June 1966 
"The Socialist International Breaks Its European Shell" and #997 of 14 
March 1966 "The Socialist International Congress: Stockholm 5-8 May 1966"), 
and refusal to align itself with the Finnish "peace movement." 
Aside from Soviet unhappiness over statements made at the SDP congress, 
the PRAVDA attack probably reflects the annoyance of the Soviet Government 
and the CPSU over the failure of Finnish Prime Minister Rafael Paasio, who 
is also Chairman of the SDP, to give in to the Soviets' pressure. When 
Paasio was chosen to lead the Socialist, Communist, and Agrarian coalition 
government last May he was considered a compromiser, but he has turned out 
to be a tough-minded politician who has kept the FCP members of the Cabinet 
under fairly tight control. Furthermore, Paasio refused to accede to the 
Soviet proposal for party-to-party contacts between the SDP and the CPSU. 
In November the Soviets were reportedly disturbed by the Finnish Prime 
Minister's decision not to have talks with CPSU leaders but only with gov-
ernment officials while he was visiting Moscow. 
A further development was reported in the 25 December WASHINGTON 
STAR (attached). The STAR article notes that SDP "also failed to declare" 
for the reelection of President Urho Kekkonen in 1968 "as the Soviets would 
have wished." It goes on to observe that the left-wing Socialist splinter 
party headed by Justice Minister Simonen, which had formed an electoral 
alliance with the Communists in last March's elections,has called its SDP 
colleagues unfit to govern. 
The material in this "Situation" section with the exception of 
references to earlier BPG!s, is unclassified.

AEROFLOT: ECONOMIC COST 
ILO 
SITUATION: (Unclassified except where noted) The Free World acti-
vities of the USSR's Aeroflot have expanded rapidly and continuously 
since 1955, and technical assistance to developing countries in the 
establishment of air transport has been a significant feature of the 
Soviet Bloc aid program. These activities have undoubtedly yielded 
gains: prestige has been enhanced by the extension of the Soviet pre-
sence; some savings in hard currency have been effected; the potentials 
for intelligence operations and economic-political penetration have 
expanded substantially. On the other hand, the poor performance of Aero-
flot and Soviet aircraft in many countries offsets some of the advantage 
gained; indeed, unfavorable comparisons of Soviet and Free World air 
transport and aircraft have had a negative over-all effect in some coun-
tries. (Unclassified attachment contains details.) 
The international expansion of Aeroflot has been dramatic. Before 
1955, Aeroflot's operating sphere was limited to the Bloc countries. By 
1960 it had spread out beyond the Bloc, mainly to Western European capi-
tals; between 1960 and 1965 its network doubled as the USSR concentrated 
on obtaining air agreements with the less developed countries of Asia 
and Africa; and in 1966 a further expansion by 10 to 20 percent was 
achieved by new agreements which included routes to Canada, the US,* 
and Switzerland. The USSR now has air agreements with 54 countries, and 
*The agreement with the US does not represent a radical new step for 
Aeroflot; it differs little from the agreement which had been initialed 
by the US and USSR governments in 1961 but, because of growing tensions 
over Berlin, not signed at that time. The earliest interest in a civil 
air agreementby both governments was officially expressed in 1958.

serves more than 40 of them with its total network of about 60,000 nau-
tical miles.* 
Aeroflot is currently attempting to expand its operations to Japan, 
Latin America, and Africa. The Soviets are experiencing their greatest 
frustration in Africa. Largely because of Sudanese firmness (Secret) 
they have been unable to extend their present routes to the south from 
Khartoum. Furthermore, the Soviets' effort to set up a flight to 
Brazzaville via Conakry and Accra received a set-back when the inaugural 
flight crashed on takeoff in February 1966. In addition, Aeroflot's 
operations in Ghana were suspended after Nkrumah's overthrow. 
In the realm of economic aid, the Soviets have been selling aircraft 
and providing technical training to the developing countries. Prices of 
Soviet planes are more modest than the roughly comparable Free World 
models, repayment terms are longer, and interest rates are lower.** In 
addition, the Soviets train pilots and maintenance men in the USSR, and 
also send teams of 10 to 20 air line operation specialists to developing 
countries; reportedly, these services are offered at a discount, and 
sometimes the first 6 months or year of service is provided by the Sov-
iets free of charge. The African countries are the major targets of the 
Soviets' economic aid efforts. 
Aeroflot's international operations are undoubtedly heavily subsi-
dized by the Soviet government. Available data on load factors*** indi-
cate that Soviet international flights have been operating at well under 
the 50% level, which Western air lines generally accept as the break-
even point for such operations. In addition, the heavier Soviet craft, 
most of which were modelled after Soviet air force bombers, are more 
expensive to operate and also have a far shorter useful life than Free 
World aircraft. (See further details on-economic aspects of Soviet air 
operations in treatment). 
Other Soviet motivations, however, are obviously strong enough to 
outweigh the economic burden of losses in international air activities. 
The political prestige value of displaying advanced industrial power is 
*Aeroflot does not have lines to West Germany and Turkey; however, several 
Bloc air lines have flights to Frankfurt, and Czechoslovakia has flights 
to Ankara. 
**List prices are lower and, reportedly, discounts are made in accordance 
with political considerations so that Soviet planes can cost around half 
as much as Free World models; however, the usual differential is not that 
great. Repayment terms are reportedly 8 years or longer at interest rates 
as low as 21/2%. In spite of such inducements, Western countries have not 
been buying Soviet transport planes because of their exceptionally high 
operating costs.

recognized by Free World observers. Less obvious, however, are the other 
interests which the Soviets can serve through their air activities. For 
example, economic and political leverage on developing countries can be 
maintained and broadened through reliance on Soviet equipment and know-
how. Of particular value to the Soviets is the potential expansion of 
support for intelligence operations. 
Aeroflot provides excellent cover for Soviet intelligence officers. 
It is well-known in international air line circles that most of the Aero-
flot agents in foreign countries are intelligence officers. With minimum 
official duties -- sometimes being responsible for only one flight a 
week -- Aeroflot agents have abundant time to pursue a broad spectrum of 
intelligence objectives. Their job affords them good opportunities to 
contact the host countries' military officers and political figures. An 
example of political involvement was seen in the unsuccessful meddling 
by the Soviets in the Ceylonese elections of March 1965, involving Aero-
flot agent V.L. Kurin, whose earlier activities indicated that he was an 
intelligence officer. The Soviets' election activities were widely 
publicized and as a result one well-known Soviet intelligence officer, 
Second Secretary K.M. Shalkharov, was asked to leave Ceylon; but Kurin 
was permitted to stay. Another example of Aeroflot-covered intelligence 
operations involved S.S. Petrov. Petrov was denied a visa to return to 
France in February 1965, according to the French press, because of the 
evidence that he had been engaged in industrial espionage. 
Aeroflot can also provide communications and logistical support for 
clandestine activities. For instance, Aeroflot has supported insurrec-
tions in Laos and the Congo, conducting airdrops and carrying arms and 25X1 C1 Ob 
ammunition falsely labeled as Red Cross supplies. 
*US planes also hauled more than 21/2 times more ton-miles of air freight 
than did Soviet planes.

OUSTED DURING 1966 
25X1C10b 
SITUATION: The year 1966 revealed once more the world-wide spread 
of Communist subversion; some 68 Communist officials serving abroad were 
declared personnae non gratae by their hosts and sent home. A substan-
tial number was kicked out of Ghana in the aftermath of Nkrumah's over-
throw: a total of 29, including 20 Soviets, 4 Cubans, 2 East Germans, 
and 3 Chicoms. Kenya accounted for l. 
Since these incidents have been and continue to be important sub-
jects for propaganda play, particularly in coverage of new cases as they 
crop up, it will be useful for field stations to have on hand a brief 
digest of recent cases for reference purposes. Accordingly, an unclassi-
fied attachment accompanies this guidance listing all cases in which 
representatives from Communist nations have been overtly asked to leave 
by their host governments during 1966. The names are grouped by country 
of origin and listed alphabetically within these groupings. A short 
description of the reason for the subject's ouster is given, as well as 
his position and the country from which expelled.

Prague, Czechoslovakia September 1966 
Finland: Co-operation Among the Democratic Forces 
CPYRGHT 
CONSIDERABLE changes have taken place latterly in Finland's 
'?'political scene. A new situation has emerged as a result of 
developments over a relatively long period, in particular the evolu-
tion of the international situation and to no less an extent the fact 
that the general line pursued by the world Communist movement 
has deprived the anti-communists of their weaponry. 
.! Throughout the post-war period the support enjoyed by the 
People's Democratic Alliance, the main force in which is the Com-
munist Party, has remained stable with 20-30 per cent of the elec-
torate backing it at the polls. In 1945-48 we were in the government 
with the Social Democratic and Agrarian parties. These three 
groups have invariably been the biggest in the country. 
. After we were forced out of the government in 1948 the Social 
Democratic Party alone took over the administration. Soon, how-
l', ever, it was joined by the Agrarians in a coalition which lasted until 
1959, when foreign policy considerations impelled the Social 
; Democrats to go into opposition. 
? " Since 1954 we have been working to achieve co-operation and 
. unity of action with the Social Democrats. In that year the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party issued a call for united action, 
:.declaring its readiness to. work together with the Social Democrats 
:for a policy meeting the interests of the working people. This appeal 
; found an eager response in the trade unions and in the factories, 
where discontent was mounting with the Social Democratic policy 
- ;of raising prices and freezing wages to serve the purposes of big 
capital, a policy which led to the general strike of 1956. Demon-
strating the unity of the working class, this strike action alarmed 
I the Rights and Impelled the anti-communists and other reactionaries 
to combine. The Social Democratic Party itself was split. 
, In 1957 Tanner, the leader of the Right-wing Social Democrats, 
;notorious for his opposition to good-neighbourly relations with the 
Soviet Union and his record, was again elected chairman of his 
party. 
In general elections of the following year the People's Democratic 
Alliance won a resounding victory, securing 50 seats out of 200. 
;The Social Democrats in parliamentsplit and an opposition Social 
Democratic parliamentary group was formed. Later this group 
evolved into an independent party. 
The workers' parties., had the majority in the newly-elected 
; parliament. The leadership of the SUP headed by Tanner, however, 
would not hear of any co-operation with the Communists. In ?iew 
of this totally blind anti-communist stand, we redoubled our efforts 
to bring our united action policy home to the masses. We found a 
wide response among the Social Democratic following as well. 
The Rights in the trade union movement and the SDP leadership 
! bent every effort to prevent the growth of Communist influence, to 
i isolate us and to split the unions. A new trade union body supported 
by big business and .by Social-Democratic Vest European trade 
? union centres and the leaders of the International Confederation 
of Free Trade Unions was established in 1960, but it failed to win 
appreciable support among the workers. It remained a splinter 
group pursuing narrow partisan and anti-communist ends. 
Then, in 1961, the SDP leaders and the bourgeois extreme Right 
made a desperate effort to channel Finland's home and foreign 
policy on to the lines of the "thirties". On the eve of the presidential 
election of 1962 they entered into an electoral bloc in order to 
defeat President Kekkonen and to install an ultra-Right instead. 
The attempt failed. The Social Democrats were defeated in the 
general election as well. ? 
In the long run these manipuiations gave rise to sharp criticism 
in the SDP, and the party's convention in 1963 made changes in 
the leadership. For one thing, a new chairman was elected. Both 
the party and its parliamentary group made a re-appraisal of their 
policy, taking a firmer stand against the capitalist government. 
Foreign policy, too, was re-examined and the SDP began officially 
to favour good relations with the Sas let UnTon based on mutual 
confidence. 
All in all this record of the attempts made to steer the SDP along 
inti-communist lines is an instructive one for all the political forces 
and the working class of Finland. 
What is the situation today? 
The Social Democratic Party won a major victory in the elections 
of last March and emerged as the biggest party in the country. 
l'he workers' parties taken together gained the majority in parlia-
ment (103 seats). This put the Right- w lag Social Democrats in a 
different position. Fruitful co-operation in goy erament without the 
bourgeoisie was now a tangible possibility. 
During the election campaign we underscored the need for 
co-operation between the workers' parties, stressing that only if 
they won the majority and worked in a spirit of co-operation was 
it possible to efket a change of policy in a direction favourable 
to the working class.- A similar Niew was taken by some prominent 
SDP leaders. For instance, Vaino Leskinen, formerly known as an 
anti-communist and one of those who were not elected to the 
Party leadership in 1963, spoke already before the elections in 
favour of co-operation between the Social Democrats and Com-
munists. Today, too, he is influential, especially among the Social 
Democratic youth and students. Besides Leskinen there arc other 
SDP leadeis ho believe that the party should mold repeating the 
mistakes of the "fifties", that it should work out a new political H 
line, and that this can be done in co-operation with the Communists. 
It is believed that at least 80 per cent of the Social Democratic 
Party membership are for co-operation with the Communists in the 
government. The majority of the members of the Agrarian Union 
(now Centre .Party) are inclined to take the same view. 
The new government was formed towards the end of May, 
following prolonged negotiations. The number of ministerial port-
folios given to the People's Democrats did not correspond to the 
percentage vote - three instead of the four they should have received 
on the strength of their electoral support. The most difficult thing, 
however, was to reach agreement on a government programme. 
The programme finally worked out; apart from agricultural policy, 
corresponds to the interests of the Working class and the majority 
of the nation in both the domestic and foreign policy spheres.

experiencing grave unticuities as a result of tne monopoly-inspired  
policy pursued over a long period of time. In order to get out of 
the red it is essential mainly to increase revenue, since the oppor-
tunities for culling expenditure are rather limited. Reduction of 
military spending, which in Finland is comparatively low. cannot 
help much to re-establish equilibrium. I fence the government 
programnie calls for increasing revenue mainly through taxation 
of the big companies and the high-income groups. 
Briefly, our aims are the following: a foreign policy based on 
peaceful coexistence; maintaining and strengthening good-neigh-
bourly relations with the Soviet Union; an active peace policy; 
prevention of unemployment; accelerated economic development, 
above all by :expanding government-controlled industry; more 
housing construction; balanced foreign trade; prevention of any 
rise in. prices; improved social security; fair taxation, and a school 
reform. 
The Fourteenth Congress of the Communist Party, held in 
January-February this year, adopted an economic and political 
programme for the immediate period. The following are the main 
points in this programme: 
"To combat the grip of the monopolies and the economic pro-
grammes of big business our Party advances its own proposals 
aimed at building up, on.a national basis, a prosperous economy. 
"These proposals have as their point of departure the following: 
"I.. Parliament should exercise both direct and indirect demo-
cratic control over the economy, with the effective participation 
of the workers in management and genuine participation of the 
peasants in the work of the co-operatives and the conduct of 
their affairs. . . 
"2. The state sector in industry should be expanded both by 
building new state-owned enterprises and by nationalising 
monopoly-owned enterprises. The state-owned enterprises should 
play the leading role inbeconomic development. 
"3. Anti-monopoly eontrol should be established over prices, 
investment and taxes :in order to increase state accumulations 
essential for the development of :the economy. 
"4. The scientific and technological revolution calls for expanded 
research, improved training of specialists, increase of basic capital 
and expansion of production enterprises. 
"5. In order to modernise the economy effective measures should 
be taken to ensure full employment at the existing enterprises and 
to provide new job opportunities. 
-"The most effective way to do-this is through industrial develop-
ment. Equally important arc major hydrotechnical, road-building 
and irrigation projects and housing construction. Agriculture has 
unused potential which, if utilised could retard growth of unem-
ployment, 
"6. The state should take measures to check the growing influence 
of foreign capital in the. Finnish economy.. 
"7. The potential of non-monopoly private enterprise should 
also be utilised to promote economic development. 
"8. It is imperative to promote public planning and to draw up 
on the basis of thorough research a plan of general development 
for our country." 
ne t_ommumst programme contains speculc proposals con-
cerning, in particular, the engineering, chemical, wood-working and 
power industries. It recommends the building of an automobile 
plant and of a nuclear power station, improving quality of output 
in the -wood-working enterprises, and sets forth the target figures 
for housing construction in 1966-75. 
The programme calls for a reorganisation of state administration 
with a view to ensuring more effective state participation in economic ' 
planning and management.. 
For about a year now we have been conducting negotiations i 
with the Social Democrats on restoring the organisational unity 
of the trade union movement. We insist on ending the discrimina-
tion against the Communists, on equal representation and demo- ! 
cratic procedures. Since the election there has been greater under- , 
standing, and the Social Democrats in the trade unions are, in-
creasingly, coining to see our viewpoint. The Congress of the 
Central Trade Union Federation, the oldest trade union centre 
in the country, which we have supported .:igainst the splitters, held 
in June-July 1966. was a notable event in this respect. 
Prior to this CongresS only three of the servinteen members of ; 
the Federation's Executive were Communists. Now, however, 1, 
with the Social Democrats taking a favourable stand towards 
co-operation with us. it was agreed to give the Communists bigger 
representation. In the election of officers a Social Democrat, Nnlo ; 
Hamalitinen, was chosen as Chairman, and a Communist, Arvo : 
liautala, as Second Chairman. A Communist was elected Second 
Secretary of the Federation. With the exception of the election of 
the Chairman, all decisions were adopted unanimously. - 
Clearly, then, big changes have taken place in the Social Demo-
cratic movement. The anti-communists have lost ground. This 
opens up new opportunities in the struggle for the workers' interests, 
for extending democracy, for peace and for socialism. 
The experience of the past twenty years shows that anti-com-
munism and the alliance with the capitalist parties prompted by 
it. can only spell defeat for the Social Democrats, reduce their 
following and split their ranks. This has compelled them to review 
their political line in regard to the Communists. It is our task to 
see to it that the incipient co-operation with the Social Democrats 
is strengthened and developed all the way to joint struggle for 
socialist aims. 
Proceeding from the decisions of the Fourteenth Congress, we 
have taken steps to amend our programme and rules in keeping 
with the changed conditions and requirements. It is our purpose 
to define with the utmost precision our attitude to the existing 
democratic institutions, to the multi-party system and civil liberties 
generally both during the transition to socialism and after its 
triumph.. 
We believe that this will promote the growth of the socialist 
forces and facilitate co-operation among them in our country, 
where the objective conditions are exceptionally favourable for 
launching out on the road of socialist change.

Translation of broadcast by Radio Moscow 
in Finnish at 1630 GMT on 12 December 1966 
(Text) PRAVDA publishes today an article by its Helsinki correspondent entitled 
1 "At the Crossroads," dealing with the results of the 27th Congress of the Finnish 
!Social Democrat Party. The correspondent states that the congress has aroused 
attention both in Finland and abroad. The article says: 
1The interest in the Finnish Social Democrat Party congress is fully understandable. 
,Above all it can be explained by the fact that social circles had waited to see 
whether the congress would reach decisions which would express the desire of many 
Finnish Social Democrats to turn the party's policy decisively on a new road 
1 and to renouhce everything old which has kept the party backward and has brought 
i its policy closer to the anticommunist policy of reactionary circles in Finland 
! and abroad. ? 
The previous 1963 party congress started a critical revision of that political 
line, which in the past has created a party .impasse. In the period between. the 
party congresses! demands were often heard within the Social Democrat Party for a 
I complete, revision of the party' s foreign policy, to show by actions and not 
merely by words true readiness to support the Finnish foreign policy of friend-
' ship with the Soviet Union and to boldly throw aside prejudices toward the 
Finnish Communist Party and other progressive forces which more consistently 
stand for the interests of Finnish workers, for the national interests of the ' 
whole country, and for peace and social progress. 
After taking certain forward steps in solving-some questions, the congress did 
not, however, take those views into account, the writer of the article states. 
From the view point of Soviet social circles, one such forward step was the congress1 
foreign politigbal resolution which obliges the party leaders, the basic sections, 
the press, as well as its workers andmembers, to work actively and sincerely for 
the further development of Finnish-Soviet relations. A new feature for the Social 
Democrat Patty was the demand of the congress that the United States should end 
its bombings of the DRV and its positive attitude toward the proposals for forming 
nuclear-free zones in northern Europe as well as toward the convocation of an 
international conference to discuss measures to guarantee European security. 
NO unprejudiced observer could help wondering why the congress rejected the 
proposal of a Social Democrat Party organization that the Finnish Social Democrat 
!Party should join the Finnish _Peace Defense Movement as a member organization 
and why the congress in its resolutions did not deal at all with the dangers 
created to the peace and security of European nations by West German revanchism. 
_ 
1 It was apparently not acciuentni that the paper KANSAN LEHTI said duringthCOrigre 
that one must'not'close Jnels zyes to the danger of war, for instance, to tho danger 
of arming West Germny with nuclear arms'. 
i It is.notewopthy that the congress this time did not even adopt a clear..cut stand cr 
1 issue a resolution dissociating the SDP from the resolutions of the ;Jocialist 
1 International Congress which are permeated with a belligerent spirit of anticommunism 
! and direct support for the aggressive NATO alliance. 
As the Finnish press has stated, such inconsistencies and contraditions also 
I characterize the congresst decisions of questions of internal policy. The congress 
!supported the work of the present Finnish Government. On this question it was expected, 
ithat the congress would also explicitly express its views on ways for cooperation

workers place great hopes in such cooperation. But the documents of the congress 
- do not say one word about it. The congress approved many decisions on economic and 
social questions whose realization could promote an improvement in the position 
of the working people. However, it ignored the fact that the most important condition 
for carrying out these decisions is the wide cooperation of the workers, as the 
experience of the workers movement over the course of many years has shown. 
It is true that the congress urged members of the Finnish Social Democrat Party, 
. among other things, to energetically support efforts to consolidate the Finnish 
trade Union movement. At the same time one cannot ignore the fact that the 
; decision of the previous congress of the Finnish Social Democrat Party to support 
the disruptive federation of Finnish Trade Unions was not cancelled. This decision 
prevents the achievement of such unity. 
The positions taken by the congress nave aroused very lively comment in Finnish 
'Political circles. The congress did not define its views on the Finnish presidential 
election but left it to the party committee. This alerts Finnish social cirales 
1 because they still have fresh memories of the Finnish Social Democrat Party's 
;part in the formation of the so-called Honka-alliance before the last presidential 
election. ? 
; The Finnish press writes that the work of the whole congress and its decisions prove 
1 that the Finnish Social Democrat Party has remained at the crossroads, without.having 
; defined a new independent, political line which would be in keeping with the times. 
- Judging by statements of Finnish social circles on the results of the congress, the 
Finnish Social Democrat Party still has a lot to do before its policy can enjoy the 
full confidence of those progressive circles and forces which steadfastly stand 
for real interests 'of the workers movement and of all working people, the PRAVDA 
article concludes.

In 1958 the Russians declared 
the Social Democrats unfit to sit

were kept out of power until 
they won a major victory in the 
March election. They gained 18 
seats for a total of 55 and be- 
came the biggest party

The problem is that the Social 
Democrats are the natural 
enemies of the Finnish Commu- 
!lists. 
In 1961 the Russians caused a 
crisis in relations with Finland 
and demanded military consul- 
tations in a successful attempt 
to stop the chances of the Social 
Democratic candidate winning 
the 1962 presidential election.

PAASIO UNDER PRESSURE  
Nieuwe Rotterdamse Courant  
Rotterdam, Netherlands, 20 December 1966 
Even though the Finnish Parliament quickly approved the budget for 
the following year, the tensions in the coalition of Social Democrats, Left 
Socialists, Communists and the Agrarian Center Party are increasing con-
stantly. The Left Socialist Simonen remains aloof from the prudent re-
organization policy of the coalition, whereas he is also extremely critical 
of the foreign policy of the Social Democrats. 
The Center Party has other problems. It has for years been the leading 
Government party and finds it less easy to adjust itself to second fiddle 
position. It feels that the left wing is dictating the policy and that is 
causing its uneasiness. Since the Government program, according to the Center 
Party, is not clear enough, new negotiations will be necessary. The Center 
Party would deny its agrarian basis if a new permanent price system would not 
head the request list, coupled to a revision of the tax system for agriculture. 
The Center Party thus announces that it will conduct a fierce struggle to pre-
vent the left wing from nibbling too much at the subsidy adjustments for agri-
culture. 
The Center Party is also disappointed about the endeavor of the Social 
Democrats to present their own candidate in the 1968 presidential elections 
The Center had hoped that the Social Democrats would place themselves with 
the other parties behind the candidacy of Kekkonen, the present President of 
the Agrarian camp. However, at the recent Party Congress of the Social Demo-
crats, the interest centered more around a candidate of their own, although a 
decision in this respect has been postponed. 
From a tactical standpoint this postponement has great advantages, for 
when the time arrives the Social Democrats can demand a better political price 
for their support of Kekkonen. In any case, this postponement will prompt the 
Center Party to be more cautious. 
The refusal of the Social Democratic Party Congress to place itself be-
hind the candidacy of Kekkonen, has also been a disappointment for Pravda 
in other words, for the Russian leadership. Throughout the years, Kekkonen 
has been the politician in whom the Kremlin had the greatest confidence. The 
Social Democrats' desire to present a candidate of their own is reminding 
Pravda of the last presidential elections when a coalition of rightwing social-
ists and extremist reactionary forces (one can recognize here the old termi-
nology) put the neutral Honka in the field as opposition candidate. 
This clearly seems to be a warning to the Social Democrats not to have 
dealings with "rightist" figures. This warning, by the way, was contained in 
a complex of objections against the Social Democrats. Even though the evil 
glance of Moscow put an end earlier this year to the exclusion of the Social

Democrats from the Government, the Simonens could report prior to the Party 
Congress that the Social Democratic face was not yet clean enough accord-
ing to Moscow's views. And after the Congress that did not entirely take 
Simonen's warning to heart, Pravda can not state that it still has too many 
black spots. 
Pravda will certainly appreciate some points of the resolutions by the 
Congress, such as the demand to the Americans to stop the bombings in North 
Vietnam, the support for an atom-free zone in Northern Europe, and the de-
mand for a conference on European security. 
However, if the Congress thought that it could appease Pravda by stating 
that the decisions of the Socialist International that conflict with Finland's 
interest are not binding for the Party, then it has been under an illusion. 
This part of the resolution related to the resolutions of the Socialist Inter-
national of 1951 and 1962, which testified to a favorable attitude toward NATO 
and a hostile attitude toward the Soviet Union. Simonen had said already 
earlier that Moscow wished the Congress to stay aloof in this respect. This 
the Congress did. It kept its distance from NATO, but also, and that caused 
the Russians annoyance, from all other military front formations. That in-
cluded the Warsaw pact. 
Pravda is upbraiding the Party because it has not taken any decisive 
steps for the elaboration of a new political line that is considering the 
spirit of the time. The Finnish Social Democratic Party still is unwilling 
to let itself be hemmed in by the idea of the people's front, and that annoys 
Pravda. What matters in this respect is not only the exclusive condemnation 
of NATO, but also the refusal to abandon the old prejudices against the Com-
munist Party and the refusal to join the Finnish peace movement collectively. 
It has been learned from various sources that Paasio, the Finnish Prime 
Minister, has not been successful in bringing the relations of his Party with 
Russia on the right basis; he is even said to have refused to discuss Party 
questions with Russian leaders, but it is not yet clear whether this is an 
attempt to bring pressure on the Social Democrats or an indication of a new 
political exile.

SOVIET INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL CIVIL AIR OPERATIONS  
Until 1955 the Soviet airline Aeroflot's international routes 
stretched only to Communist countries. Since then the network has grown 
rapidly, and in the last six years it has more than doubled. It now totals 
about 60,000 nautical miles and serves more than 40 countries. Aeroflot 
schedules 82 international flights weekly, 52 linked with Free World coun-
tries and 30 with Communist countries. By international standards this 
operation is small. The Scandinavian Airlines System, a medium-size inter-
national airline schedules 386 flights weekly to and from cities outside 
Scandinavia. 
To formalize its aviation relationships with Communist states and 
to secure aviation rights in Free World countries, the USSR began signing 
bilaterial air agreements in 1955. It now has air agreements with 54 coun-
tries. In 1955 most of the agreements signed were with Communist countries 
and during the next three years with the aviation powers of western Europe. 
As a result of these agreements Aeroflot flies into most of the capitals of 
Europe, and 19 foreign airlines fly into the USSR. Since 1960 the Soviets 
have concentrated on obtaining air agreements with the less developed coun-
tries of Asia and Africa. 
1965 and the first quarter of 1966 was a period of frustration for the 
Soviets in Africa as they sought to extend their present routes into Africa 
further to the south. Air agreements were signed with Kenya, Uganda, and 
Tanzania, the Soviets have not been observed to have extended their air ser-
vice any further south than Khartoum, Sudan. The Soviets attempted to ex-
tend their west African route to Brazzaville. However, the inaugural flight 
from Moscow to Brazzaville via Conakry and Accra crashed on takeoff, and no-
thing more has been heard about this proposed route. 
One reason why Soviet representatives have had such trouble in Africa 
is the recognition by the Africans that Soviet competition would threaten 
the survival of their own budding airlines. Political obstacles also have 
impeded the Soviets. For example after the overthrow of Nkrumah, Aeroflot 
was expelled from Ghana, and the Soviets lost the route from Conakry to 
Accra. 
The Soviets are becoming more active in Latin America and have been 
discussing with Brazil and Mexico the possibility of Aeroflot air services 
to these countries. So far, however, the Soviets have not succeeded in 
gaining a civil air agreement with any Latin American country except Cuba. 
The Soviets also have been working for additional air rights in the 
industrial West and Japan. An air agreement between the USSR and Japan 
signed in January 1966 provides for the first direct scheduled route be-
tween Japan and Western Europe. The Japanese have agreed to a jointly 
operated service between JAL and Aeroflot, using only Soviet aircraft and 
flight crews for two years. The Soviets have promised that by the end of

the two-year period they will attempt to clear the way for the Japanese 
Air Lines to fly independently over Siberia. Snags have developed over 
the charter rates and revenue sharing, but both sides still hope to reach 
agreement on the financial arrangements in time to open the Tokyo-Moscow 
route in the spring of 1967, almost a year later than initially scheduled. 
West Germany is one of the few countries in Western Europe that is 
still not serviced by Aeroflot. West German-Soviet neogitations for 
Frankfurt-Moscow civil air services have progressed to an advanced stage, 
but thus far have faltered over West German refusal to permit Aeroflot to 
include Berlin/Schoenefeld (located on East German territory) as an inter-
mediate landing site. 
The aircraft used on Aeroflot international routes are the TU-104, 
the IL-18, the TU-124, and the AN-12. The most widely used, but obsoles-
cent TU-104 gradually is being phased out of service. The IL-18 4-engine 
turboprop is used on the longer routes. The TU-124 jets have assumed a 
larger role in the last two years and probably will be supplemented by 
the new TU-134 with its jet engines in the rear. The long-range TU-124 
turboprop is the only Aeroflot model to make scheduled transatlantic 
flights -- it has been flying to Havana regularly since late 1962. How-
ever, Aeroflot hopes to replace it with the more efficient IL-62, which 
is still not in production. The AN-12 is used on the only two all-cargo 
flights of Aeroflot, one to Paris and the other to Southeast Asia. 
The prime objective of Aeroflot's international operations appears 
to be to enhance the Soviet presence abroad. However, Aeroflot's impact 
on a Western Europe already crowded with airflights and modern aircraft 
has been minimal. The impact has been more pronounced in the less devel-
oped countries where there are fewer manifestations of western technology. 
Even in Africa, however, one has only to look at the extensive network of 
Air France and BOAC and their associated airlines to realize that Aeroflot's 
four round trip flights a week to Africa comprise a small share of the total. 
In Conakry, Guinea, for example, out of 24 outbound flights a week, only one 
is by Aeroflot. 
The Soviets get other benefits from Aeroflot international operations 
-- the saving of foreign exchange that occurs when they transport Soviet 
nationals abroad in Soviet, rather than foreign, aircraft, the opportunity 
to transport agents or clandestine cargo with minimum observation by for-
eigners, and the use of Aeroflot representatives abroad as intelligence 
agents. 
Profitability does not appear to be a significant Soviet objective. 
An analysis of passenger load factors on selected Aeroflot flights indicates 
that load factors range from 18 percent on the Belgrade-Tunis-Algiers-Rabat 
flight to 55 percent on the flight to Copenhagen. The average break-even 
passenger load factor for all international airlines is about 50 percent. 
It is apparent that the Aeroflot flights to Western Europe are considerably 
more profitable than those to other areas of the World.

Compared with other international airlines, Aeroflot does not get a 
high performance rating. Aeroflot flights are reasonably safe and adher-
ence to flight schedules is reasonably good, but the performance of Soviet 
aircraft is inferior to that of western aircraft. The Aeroflot aircraft 
are more difficult to handle; fuel consumption is higher; and engine life 
is much shorter. Service to passengers abroad Aeroflot is decidedly in-
ferior to the service on western airlines. Passenger comfort is also in-
ferior. Cabins are noisier. Pressurization is erratic. 
For the future Aeroflot aircraft and service can be expected to im-
prove, but other international airlines are moving forward so rapidly that 
Aeroflot will not be any great threat to Western airlines for the foresee-
able future.
