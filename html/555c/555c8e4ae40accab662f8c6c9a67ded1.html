 "  spy IN THE U.S.       7!8-       (n on t  x ag Baekerville
 reconnaissance On foot. At live that afternoon we met to turn in our
 car and take a night train back to Washington. While I paid for the
 car \Vi~niewski went to the station to pick up our tickets and reserve
 two roomettes. The FBI apparently saw him, for when I got to the
 station at (rain time to join him, the Pullman conductor had bad
 news for us.
 "I am sorry, gentlemen,he said, "but there has been a mistake.
 four space was reserved for passengers who will be getting on later.
 \Ve will have to move you to berths in another car."
 I did not like the sound of this maneuver, and I protested.
 "\Ve have paid for these rooms," I said, "and we have the tickets.
 1'ou will have to Put the other people somewhere else."
 "I can't do that," the conductor said. "I'm sorry, but you will have
 to move."
 " \Ve will not move," I said.
 \?Vi~niewski and I got on the (rain and went straight to our room-
 ettes. The train pulled out, and in a few minutes the conductor
 came by.
 "I still have to move you gentlemen," he said, a little sternly this
 time.
 "Move the other people who are not on the train yet," I said.
 The conductor shrugged his shoulders and left. He went to the
 car ahead of us and, through the passageway. I could see him talking
 to two strangers. One of them shook his head and motioned for the
 conductor to come back and take us to their car.
 Now I knew what was going on, and 1 was very angry. The FBI
 men who had to follow us to Washington had not been able to get
 space in our car at the last minute. So they were asking the con-
 ductor to move us to their car where they could watch us more easily.
 I was determined not to accommodate them.
 The conductor came by again. This time he looked desperate, and
 I felt rather sorry for him. But I did not like to be pushed around
 just to make it easy for the FBI. It was the principle of the thing.
 \Ve had a right to ride wherever we wanted to. I asked the conductor
 for his name, this time, and wrote it down in my notebook. Then
 I told hint I would write a full report on the incident to the Pullman
 company aml ask for our money hack.
 "If we have to move," I said, "we will move to the coaches."
 The conductor sighed, but he said nothing. He punched our
 tickets and went away. Wi~niewski and 1 locked ourselves in our
 roomettes.
 An hoar or so later I went to the diner for supper-leaving
 \Visniewski behind to guard our accommodations so no one could
 search them. As I walked down the aisle I glanced through the open
 door of another compartment in our car and saw our friends seated
 inside with their eyes fixed on the corridor. It was the FBI that had
 had to move. The mountain had come to Mohammed.
 It was an exhausting game, pitting wits and legs against the FBI's
 troops. And though I felt no friendship for them-and they none for
 inc. certainly- I sontetIines tried to lighten the day for all of us with
 a little friendly conversation. Once, in New York, when I had been
 racing.al I over Central Park for hours trying to lose the FBI on the
 winding trails, at the crowded zoo and even in the cavernous halls
 of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, we were all so hot an(l tired
 that I stopped for a moment at a water fountain. One of the FBI
 men took advantage of the recess to sit down on a bench and rest
 his feet. There was no one else on the bench so 1 went over and sat
 down next to him.
 "It's a very hot day, isn't it  I asked.
 ?{y friend was not in the mood to be friendly. He stared straight
 ahead, like one of those imperturbable guards at Buckingham Palace,
 and did not answer me. He was under orders, I suppose, not to get
 familiar with his quarry on the hunt. Or perhaps he was so fed up
 with me by now that he (lid not trust his tongue. After a few minutes
 we both got up and went on with the race. The FBI men won the
 prize that clay; I never did lose them. I did try to make it pleasant
 for them that evening, however. I let them folloly me to the Latin
 Quarter, an opulent night club where I think we all had a wonderful
 time. At least I liked the show very much. And the FBI men, who
 sat at an adjoining table, seentetl to enjoy themselves, too. But I
 never again saw the man whom I had spoken to on the bench. The
 fact that I hacl singled him out apparently ended his usefulness on
 the Monat posse. I dicl hope he was transferred to more pleasant
 duty.
 In Penn Station one evening, as I was waiting to board a train
 from New York to Washington, I saw three FBI men standing a few
 feet away from me. They were obviously impatient to see me off and
 get rid of nte. One of them had been my special enemy that clay.
 Every time I thought I was about to get away from him-in a Times
 Square restaurant, on a subway train or in an office elevator-he had
 been right on top of me. The race took us all over the city and it
 lasted for about eight hours. Even though my friend won, I was
 sure that by now he was sick of the very sight of me.
 He looked it, too. He was a tall, good-looking man with a youthful,
 athlete's face, bright eyes, a crew cut and a well-tailored suit. He
 could easily have passed as the young headmaster of a fashionable
 prep school or the junior partner in a leading New York law firm.
 I could tell from his manner that he had nothing but contempt for
 me. His eyes glanced just past or just over my head whenever he had
 to look in my direction. And as he stood there, calmly smoking a
 cigarette, a look of real disdain crossed his face. He seemed like a
 very good man-to have on your side, not against you.
 Partly out of boredom and pettiness-and partly out of profes-
 sional admiration for the man-I deci(lecl to speak to him.
 "Pardon me," I said, turning to face him, "but haven't I seen you
 somewhere today
 "No, I'm afralid not," he said, glancing down at me very quickly.
 " flut I'm sure I saw you in Times Square," I said.

 "I was not. in. Times Square," he answered.
 "Perhaps it was on the Seventh Avenue subway("
 "i do riot ride the Seventh Avenue subway."
 "That is very odd," I said. "i hardly ever mistake a face."
 My friend said nothing but kept pulling on his cigarette. He almost
 blew the smoke in my direction, but he thought better of it and
 turned away just in time.
 "Are you going to Washington  I asked him.
 "No," he said, "I am waiting for my mother-in-law."
 Then he dropped his cigarette on the cement floor and ground it
 out with a.stomping motion of his loot. I could see that he was
 extremely uncomfortable and wished only 'that I would go aboard
 the train and get out of his sight.. I decided to tease him once more.
 "Perhaps you have not seen me before," I said, "because I am not
 from New York. You see, i am the Polish military attache. I live in
 Washington."
 Now he looked straight at me.
 "So you are the Polish military attache," he said. "Well, I am the
 monkey keeper at the Bronx Zoo."
 I never saw that agent again, either.
 AMERICANS TALK TOO MUCH
 "It was lucky for me that not all of the Americans I met were as
 close-mouthed as the FBI. if they had been, I would never have been
 able to send as many secrets to Warsaw as I did. Soon after my
 arrival-and much to n-y aniazentent-i discovered that the U.S. is
 not a cliflicult country to spy on at. all. For one thing, it is rather
 ingenuous about keeping its secrets. It places armed guards and
 barbed wire around a new defense installation; but it also allows
 the contractor who built the place to print pictures of it in his
 publicity releases and in his advertising. It puts most of its Grade-A
 military eggs-the top generals and admirals and staff planners-
 into one basket-the Pentagon-but then it allows almost anyone,
 including Communist intelligence officers, to go prowling through
 the basket almost at will, searching for cracked shells and broken
 secrets/But one of the weakest links in the nation's security is a
 national trait which is also, ironically enough, one of the country's
 best and nwst charming assets-the yearning friendliness of her
 people.
 No simple characterization ever fits an entire population. But I
 have found-in general-that Americans are a likable people, a
 friendly people and a generous people. The only trouble with them
 on this score is that. they also seem to crave public recognition and
 appreciation for being likable, friendly and generous. Perhaps this
 is because they are self-conscious about being the world's nouveau
 riche and want to make up for their good luck and their comforts
 with organized kindliness. Or perhaps it is because America is such

 I finally deci(le(I could be formulated into a basic principle for
 getting along with Americans. At least, it stood me in good stead.
 The principle is this: if a strange foreigner tells an American often

 friendly person and that the U.S. is truly a magnificent country, the
 foreigner is almost sure to be accepted-and almost innnediately-

 of instant friendship in his eloquent advice from Polonius to Laertes.

 wanting to be liked and admired. Even with a Polish accent, I was

 One evening, in the winter of td.,6, Captain \Visniewski and I
 boarded a train in \Vashington for Chicago. The FBI had seen us
 off at the station. But apparently it trusted its this time not to get
 off en route, so none of otn? I`riends came along for the ride. \VM-
 niewski and i shared a Pullman compartment, and while he stowed
 away our luggage I stood in the corridor watching the train pull out..
 I noticed a tall, distinguished-looking gentleman with glasses and
 thinning gray hair standing next to me, also looking out the window.
 As i turned towards him we nodded and smiled to each other.
 "It looks like a pleasant journey," he said.
 "I hope so," I answered. "i hope we are oti time."
 "Oh, we will be," he said. "The B & O is pretty good about that."
 ''Do you travel very much  i asked him.
 "Yes, I'm afraid so," he sighed. "On the go most of the time.
 Busy, busy, busy."
 '''el I,'' I said, "you have a very beautiful country to travel in.
 It is very nice this time of year."
 "Yes, it is," my companion said. "Beautiful." We both looked out
 the window again.
 "i noticed your accent," he said, looking back at me. "Where are
 you from, if I may ask?''
 "Oh, you may ask," I said. "I'm originally from Poland. But now
 I live here in \Vashington."
 "I see," he said. "And what do you do

 I \vas returning to \\'ashington from \e\\? York by naiii one
 evening \vhen a young :\rnty lieutenant ('ante aboard at Trenton,
 \c\\? Jersey, and sat (1o\vn in the scat beside me. 1 could tell front his
 insignia that he was an ordnance officer. \\'e did not speak at first.
 The lieutenant leafed through a niagacine while I gaged oat of my
 \r?indo\\ and Watched his rellectiou in it for sonic sign of an ripening.
 Finally, when he seemed lured with his reading, 1 hrought out my
 cigarette case-Which I carried only as a prop, to help start con\'ersa-
 tions-and stuck a cigarette in my iuouth. I offered 0ac to the
 lieutenant. I-Ic said he \vas trying to quit, but 1\e accepted one and
 I gave him a light.
 "1'nt going to \V:ishington," I said. ' how far arc you going?"
 "Aberdeen," lie answered.
 "Oh, the ordnance proving grouauls," I said. I knew that this teas
 one of the most highly classified posts in the U.S. and that it tested
 ne\v \yeapons and equipment for the II.S.:\rmy. I t- iecl not to het ray
 too much interest, but 1 soon dis(overccl I did not have to worry.
 The lieutenant was ready atul pilling to tell mite all about it.
 "You must have a very interesting joh." I s:ticl, "For stub a young
 officer."
 "It sure is," he answered. "\Ve're on a fascinating project right
 now-We're trying to figure out the hest angle to tnottnt arnica- on a
 new tank. \'o1( know, so the shells won't penetrate it but will bounce
 oil."
 "Is that so?'' I exclaimed.
 "Right now we think it goes on about like this," the lieutenant
 said, holding his hands up tri show nue the angle.
 "You've probably heard about the new Nt-1rifle and the i\4-Go
 machine gun," he said, after we had loth milled on our cigarettes
 for a moment.
 "Very little," 1 said, speaking frankly.
 \ tell," he said, 'that little \i--.} is really terrific. We think that
 baby's going to give its a firepower of 7r,o rounds a minute. That's
 faster, you know, than some of our machine gums.'
 "I didn't know that," I said. And 1 really didn't.
 I kept nodding my head or exclaititing over facts for the?next hour
 until the train stopped at Aberdeen, Maryland, anti the lieutenant
 shook my hand anul got off. I spent the next hour-until the fain
 pulled into Washington-scribbling down notes of everything he had
 said. The next clay 1 discussed them with one of my assistants, who
 was an expert on ordnance. He knew most of the facts the lieutenant
 had given me, but some of the details were new to hint. I checked
 these with the Soviet military attache and they were news to hint,
 too. It was a profitable cigarette.
 In May, 197, i , when the U.S. Was celebrating Armed Forces Day
 at military bases all over the country, 1 deciclecl to send Captain
 Edward Gordon to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to take a good look
 at the fiend Air-borne Division, which we knew was putting on a
 big show for the public that day-including a demonstration para-
 chute jump. Gordot\ sneaked away from Washington without an
 FBI escort and arrived in Fayetteville on the day of the demonstra

 pulled up and a middle-agccl couple asked him where he was headed.
 Gordon told them he was going to Fort Bragg to see the show. The
 old couple told him to jump in-they were going there, too.
 The man in the car-a Mr. li-asked Gordon where he was from,
 and Gordon told him he had just arrived from Washington.
 "From your accent," Mr. B said, "I'd guess you work for one of the
 ~mbassics there."
 "Why, yes," Gordon admitted, "the Polish embassy."
 "And how do you like the United States?" Mr. B asked.
 "i think it is wonderful, very beautiful," Gordon said. "The people
 in Washington are very nice, very friendly."
 "Well," Mr. B said, looking around at Gordon in the back seat,
 "the people here in North Carolina are a lot friendlier than the
 people there in Washington. Just you wait and see."
 Gordon sat hack in the car, thinking that this was too funny to be
 true. He was not in uniform, so Mr. and Mrs. B could not guess that
 he was a military man. But even if they had, it would not have made
 much difference. Mr. and Mrs. B did not seem to think it was at all
 unusual for a Pole to be running around loose at a U.S, military
 demonstration. If Gordon (lid not belong there, they seemed to
 assume, somebody would have stopped him.
 "You know," Mr. B said, "you really are lucky that I picked you
 up. I know this outfit as well as anybody around here. If there's
 anything you want to know about it, just ask me."
 Mrs. B explained that her husband did a good deal of business
 with the Army people in town and that they were both devoted fans
 of the division.
 "They always give us VIP treatment at these shows," she said,
 "and we never miss one of them. 1 guess you'd say we've sort of
 adopted each other-the 82nd and Mr. and Mrs. B."
 Mr. B was right about Gordon's luck. He had a special sticker
 fastened to his windshield which allowed him to park close to the
 grandstand. And every soldier in the area seemed to know him. A
 sergeant. saw that he got a choice spot for his car. And while Mrs. B
 went off to join some lady Friends-mostly Army wives-her husband
 took Gordon into an enclosed area where he had a fine vantage point
 for watching the jump. Gordon had brought along both a movie
 camera and a still camera, and when the show started Mr. B oblig-
 ingly olierecl to operate one camera while Gordon was busy with the
 other. He also kept up a running commentary on the demonstration.
 He seemed to know a good deal about the division's parachute tac-
 tics and combat organization. Whenever an officer he knew came by,
 Mr. B stopped him and asked him to explain his job to Gordon.
 Gordon picked up at least one new fact from each officer he met.
 One of them told Gordon about a special training course he had
 helped devise to teach the paratroopers guerrilla tactics. This man
 alone was worth Gordon's trip, for a few weeks after Gordon re-
 turned to Washington we got a cable from 2-2 querying us on the
 same subject.
 Mr. B never did tell his Army friends where Gordon was from. It
 never occurred to him, apparently, that this was important. Perhaps
 he did not know where Poland was or that it belonged to the Com-
 munist bloc. Mr. B was a very kind man and an extremely patriotic
 American. The 82nd Air-borne was the salt of the U.S. to him, and
 the U.S. was the salt of the world. But Mr. B was also a kindly old
 fool.
 In 1g56 I sent two of my best assistants-Majors Edmund Bara-
 nowski and \\'fiaclysfiaw Kuhiski-on a trip through Texas to search
 for new drops. They flew to Dallas and rented a car there for the
 rest oF.the tour. They looked! for drops by day and spent their ?eve-
 flings looking for strangers who might disclose some information.
 Texas is crammed with Air Force installations, so my officers made
 a point of staying at motels close to the airfields and eating their
 meals in restaurants which they noticed were frequented by Air
 Force Den. Despite these preparations, however, and long hours of
 patient waiting, their pickings were slim. Then one night, as they
 sat at a bar outside San Antonio, Baranowski and Kufiusk.i looked
 up to see a tall young man come striding through the door, amble
 up to the bar an(I order a double bourbon-on-the-rocks. The majors
 were fascinated by him. The thing which impressed them most about
 hint, they reported to me later, was the rakish ten-gallon hat he
 wore. They had never seen one quite like it. They must have stared
 at him, for in a moment the Texan waved to them from his end of
 the bar.
 "Howdy, strangers," he drawled, "ah don't reckon ah've seen you
 two around! here before."
 My majors waved back and nodded. They admitted they were
 strangers, and the Texan sidled over to stand next to them. He told
 them his name; they told him their names. In the confusion of the
 moment they even volunteered that they were from Poland.
 "Well," he said, "you've come a far piece to see Texas. What do
 you-all think of it?"
 Kufiuski anti Baranowski assured the young man-who was still
 wearing his hat-that Texas was amazing. It was very big, it was very
 rich, it was everything they had ever heard about it.
 "Well," the Texan said, "we try to do our share. The old country
 up north wants to build herself a lot of automobiles-we dig up all
 the gas and oil to make 'em run. She gets hungry-we Fatten up the
 steers. She gets her little of self into a war-we bail her out. We've
 got a lotta fightin' folk down here. Ah guess you all've seen the big
 airfields we got all over."
 Kufiuski and Baranowski said they had seen the fields but did not
 know too much about them. So the Texan proceeded to fill them in.
 "Ah've been inside most of 'em,'he said. "Ah was a pilot nuysel~
 for nicre'n four years. Then my daddy died and ah had to get out
 and mind the ranch. Ah sure do miss ifyin'."

 Aly nten suggested that they were hungry and they asked the Texan
 if he would join than for dinner, lie agreed-"If you'11 let me pay
 my own way and buy the next round.'' 1)uring dinner the Texan
 talked on and on about his Air Force. He was a walking encyclopedia
 of niIitars' aviation. He knew the speed amid pcrformance of Air
 Force planes: he knew the training schedules of the local pilots-
 niany of whom were friends of his: he knew about their pay, their.
 morale and their proficiency; lie knew how the SAC alert system
 worked-and he went on to describe it; he knew how many bombers
 on an SAC base were loaded with nuclear weapons and ready to fly
 away to war: he knew about the armament of the planes and the
 radar systems and the best tactics for shooting down an interceptor
 in midair-a feat which he enacted dramatically with his hands; he
 knew what formations the fighter planes were trained to follow: and
 he went into detail about Air Force maintenance and repair crews.
 He not only knew all this, but he was eager to brag about his infor-
 mation to strangers. Kufiuski and Raranowski, who were not aviation
 experts, understood and retained about half of what he told them.
 As a result of this amazing adventure, I suggested in my report to
 \Vasaw that future missions of this kind into Air Force territory be
 staFl?ed with trained Polish Air Farce officers, even if they had to he
 sent all the way from Warsaw for the purpose. The Texan simply
 knew-and said-too much.
 One of our best sources of loose talk about military subjects was
 -of all places-the Pentagon in \V;tshington. r\nycme, from a four-
 star general to a fifteen-year-old boy, can get into the Pentagon.
 "There are information desks at the hall and River entrances where
 ladies sit ready to answer ditestions or direct strangers to the proper
 room in the proper corridor on the proper Floor of this gigantic
 maze. :\nd presumably, they also are there to sift out people who
 don't helong. But no one needs a pass to get past them. Ancl once
 inside the Pentagon-though nn:uty :areas are extremely well guarded
 to let the joint Chiefs, the intelligence stall's and the top-secret
 planners deliherate in privacy-anyone can roans the hallways and
 pause in the corridors. The hasetuent of the Pentagon houses a large
 Concourse which is filled with shops, snack bars, post offices and
 other public conveniences for the Pentagon's huge population. This
 area, along with the Pentagon lihr:n?y-where we were allowed to
 browse contentedly through the unclassified material-were our
 main stamping grounds.
 But we were not interested in buying stamps or drinking coffee or
 sinnply flipping the pages of nilitary history hooks. \\'e did all of
 these things-hut only as an excuse for h:tnging around. Our real
 purpose tvas to eavesdrop can conversations..\ good deal of the talk
 we overheard consisted of everyday military gossip. .~ general was
 being transferred or promoted, and his friends (-ante up to congratu-
 late hint. A new admiral ryas moving in and he went up to greet old
 friends. A colonel who was well known :wound the Pentagon was
 telling everyone hots he had taken over a new :\rnn)' branch involving
 research. Air Force captains stood around in groups worrying out
 loud about their pay. their housing and their pronlotions to niajor.
 Once in a tyhile, in the midst of all this chatter, aye picked up a
 juicy morsel. Two oliicers meeting iti a hall confirntecl a rumor the
 had heard that an infantry regiment was undergoing special nuclear
 training... colonel told a friend that he had just been ordered to
 evaluate a ne%y tyeapon that eve had never heard of. \Ve got our first
 real hint abcnu the reorganisation of the Arnnv into tic, streamlined
 "pentontic" divisions in the Pentagon cellar.:\nd one of Iii)' assist-
 ants fast heard about the new R-7o airplane from an   ir Force
 colonel who nientioned it to a colleague of his as the two of them
 stood ~-aiting for hattiburget?s at a Pentagon snack b:u.
 All of this information was choppy and fragmentary. It was col-
 lected on the edge of crowds and sometimes it gave us only the rough
 edge of a new fact. But each small tidbit helped us ho ild ult the
 mosaic. The eavesdropping also gage Warsaw-and Nloscow-att in-
 credibly intimate insight into the daily workings of the American
 high command.
 The Pentagon was so easy for us to get into, and so safe for us to
 work in, that 1 wanted very much to locate a secret drop there. \Ve
 found au excellent spot for one-a crack in the wall behind a door
 not far Iromn the underground taxi entrance. And I could have made
 wonderful use of it. Every now and then sonic co-operative soul in
 the Pentagon would send word that he had some classified material
 for us. We did not dare meet hint anywhere. And he did not want
 to carry his papers too far from the Pentagon for fear of getting
 caught with them.. drop was theii.cleal solution. But \1'arsaw tltrnecl
 us down. It was inconceivable to %-2 that we could work right under
 the noses of the top brass without getting into serious trouble.
 \Varsaw was wrong, of course. It would have been a stiap.

 THE PRESS IS A BIG HELP
 Americans are not only careless and loquacious in their speech,
 They also give away far more than is good for them in the public
 print.. This fact-which I soon realizc(I was another basic principle
 in American life-came in very handy for inc. It was nice to know,
 on a rainy clay or when the wind was howling down Wyoming
 Avenue or the snow was drifting outside, that I could go right on
 collecting secrets for Warsaw without ever leaving my desk. And,
 though I had an unlimited budget for buying information, it was
 also gratifying to know-since Poland is poor-that I could acquire
 a good deal of it, even in the money-conscious U.S., for next to
 nothing.
 Take February, tg57, for example. I really got a windfall that
 month. For the incredibly reasonable stun of two dollars, I was able
 to buy-in one tidy bundle-a long and extremely detailed series of
 facts concerning military aviation in the U.S. and allied countries.
 Here are just a few of the fascinating facts which I learned from this
 one source:
 The first s(lua(lr(m of twelve F8U-1 Crusader planes will soon he put
 into service in the U.S. Navy: the plane is powered by a Pratt R Whitney
 J?:i7 engine with a thrust of ten thousand pounds: an improved version-
 (lesignated the F8U-3-will have a speed of I\iach 2 and will I:ie ready in
 three )'cans. ;\ photographic version of the plane-designated the F8U-rP-
 is already on the books in the Fleet Introduction I'rogram.
 Clore than one hundred I)ouglas F4 I) Skyray all-weather fighters-also
 powered by J-7 engines-arc assigucd to the Elect, and quantity procluc-
 tior will coutinuc until nti(I-1938.
 "f he Cons?air F-tr2jet interceptor has a wingspan of 32 feet 2 inches,
 is fib feet and   inches long,  2t  feet ;ut(I 3 inches high, has a speed of
 l\fach  1,  is p overcd by the f-a7 and carries a Falcon missile produced by
 Hughes which is 6 feet long, 6 inches in diameter, has a wingspan 0f
 2 feet, weighs too pounds and is gui(fe(I to its target by a radar horning
 de\'Ice.
 Engineers at Boeing have discovered that they can save at least 30 per
 cent on the weight of a B-47 or B-52 bomber by constructing it of heat-
 trcatc(1 (i.\1-4V tit:uliunt alloy instead of the Typc 422 heat-treated steel
 whi(Ii they h;nc been using.
 "I?he British have a Saunders Roc SR/53 rocket-jet interceptor-powered
 by an  .\rmstrnng?Siddclcy Viper engine-ready for testing at  Boscome
 D(nans: the :\rmsu-ong-\vhitworth people arc working on a ship-to-air
 Weapon for the Royal Navy which will use a Sperry guidance system.
 (:ana(la has already sent one squadron of .\vro CF- tuu fighters to join
 NA'f O in Europe and gill h;n?c the second squadron there in another
 nt?nt.h. The (: nacli us plan a total of four CF-too squadrons, with the
 retraining eight squadrons to be equipped with F-86 Sabrejets.
 -I?he Saah Aircraft (: iiii :u s in Sweden has ccnnpletecl the maiden flight
 of its all-weather ( ;;2-B night fighter, which differs from the A 32 in that
 it has a store powerful Rolls-Royce engine, an enlarged afterburner, new
 ;un,;tn,ent, a new navigation system an(1 new fire-control equipment.
 Argentina has turned clown a tJ.S. offer of F-84 Thu nderjets at thirty
 thous 11(1 dollars each because the "Argentines thought the plane was too
 hot for them to handle." Argentina still has 70 of its original loo Gloster
 meteors, btu 0111)' f  of them arc in operation.
 The West Germans arc building   in Fouga-~fagister trainers and 469
 DO-27's for their own Air Forcc, with the s1csscrschmitt, Heinkel and
 llornien companies doing the work.
 Italy has three brigades of fighter-bombers, cacti outfitted with F-84's
 and F-S,1 F?'s, ;ut all-weather fighter brigade equipped with F'-86K's, a
 squadron of Fiat Vampires, ;ut(1 two antisubmarine groups equipped with
 Harpoons. Total strength of the Italian 'it Force is now 700 planes,
 which is a 27 per cent increase over t9i5?
 Japan is rehabilitating ;ut old field at Shizuma, near Nagoya, with a
 fi.ooo-foot runway. has an Soon-foot runway at Ffyakurihara near Tokyo,
 and is planning to spend a hill ile spirit of good neighborliness.
 But somehow the U.S. State Department caught on to our tricks
 and 'warned us to stop buying military publications under false
 Pretenses. \Ve dicl-for a few -uonths. Then we started up again.
 An(I, to our great surprise, we were once more fairly successful. But
 in 1g5(i I thought. of a refinement on this trick which I clecidecl would
 help eliminate the suspicion altogether. It involved our being able
 to 1>lace orclcrs under names which did not sound so obviously
 Polish. 1 knew that a Polish captain by the name of Edward
 Kucharski was ahout to leave \Varsaw to join my staff. I sent a cable
 requesting that Kucharski change his name before he left and come
 to the U.S. wit Ii a lapel that sotnuled Purely American.
 He would have to go through all kinds of legal shenanigans, of
 crnr1SC-take out a ne~v passport with his new name inscribed on
 it, and even get a new hirth certificate stuck into the files in \Varsaw
 so the deception (0111(1 not easily be discovered by American counter-
 intelligence. His wife and young son would have to change their
 names, too-since they were coming with him. And the new name
 would have to ring true. Kucharski could not switch to a name like
 Smith or S;dtonst;dl or O'Flaherty-since there are no such names in
 P0lancl. Rut he could come with a name like Gordon. Gordon, for
 SOIlle reason, is 1101. an uncommon name in Poland; several Gordons
 are even listed in the \Varsaw tclellhcme book.
 Kuch;rrski (I i(1 not like the idea at all; he was very fond of his own
 name. Rut my superiors liked it; and Kucharski, like a good soldier,
 had to 0hey. And so, when "E(Ity;u-d Gordon" showed up in \Vash-
 ington as my new assistant, I put. him to work immediately sub-
 scribing to magazines and writing in for books. The trick worked
 very well. (:aptain Gordon remained in the U.S. until early in
 -qfi-. I-Ic is hack in \Varsaw note, under his old name of Kucharski.
 /One of the hest sources of loose talk in the U.S. is the United
 States Congress. Almost Senator and Congressman likes to consider
 hiulself an expert on one phase of U.S. defense or another-if only
 to know how to wangle a new Air Fot?ce base or an :\rny post for
 his constituency back home. Sonic of the members, especially those
 who have served in the arned forces themselves, develop a real
 competence in the field and take a hand in helping to tttolcl the
 nation's defenses. One a year, when the military budget is being
 thraShccl out in Congressional hearings, the members of Congress
 put the top admirals and generals on the witness stand and talk it
 all over, cxllert-to-expert. The questioning goes on for hours. And
 all of it-except for the really secret material which goes off the
 record-is printed, vnrd for wcn?d, in big, fat reports which almost
 anyone can get his hands on simply by going to a Congressman's
 office or to the Government Printing Office and claiming to be a
 journalist collecting information for an article. (At least, that is how
 I got my copies of Congressional hearings on the defense budget.)
 In 1when the military appropriations for 1958 were being
 worked out, the herrings were immortalized in a stack of documents-
 one fcrr the Navy, one for the Army, one for the Air Force and one
 fo-? the Defense Department-which stood almost a foot high and
 ran to more than six thousand pages of very fine print. Many of the
 passages were extremely boring, even for the experts. One table,
 for example, suniunarized the number of square feet occupied by
 U.S. Army barracks in Hawaii, Alaska, the Caribbean and the U.S.,
 and broke it down into such singular categories as "permanent,"
 "improved temporary," "unimproved temporary," and "austere."
 Another section pinned down the amount of money the U.S. Navy
 would he asking for in 1958 ($1,200,000) for the "Transportation of
 Things."
 One of my favorite characters slurring these annual meetings was
 Representative Daniel Flood of Pennsylvania, a man who obviously
 took great delight in asking piercing questions of the brass. And
 sometimes Mr. Flood got an answer which was quite enlightening
 for me. On April  16,  ig57, he was in the committee room as
 Brigadier General Chester De Gavre, Director of Development in
 the Army's Office of Research and Development, was showing some
 movies and slides to a Congressional committee so the members could

 get a good look at the items they were being asked to l'aY for. i
 thought Mr. Flood's reaction to one gadget General 1)e Cavrc un-
 veiled was particularly interesting. Here is how the testimony went:
 CENERAI. DE. GAvRr?.. The item being shown is the Scorpion
 or the M-r,6 assault gull. It is not a tank. Mr. Sikes, as you
 recall, recommended this be named the Slugger. We have
 named it the Scorpion because it cannot stand up ante slug
 with tanks. The crew is entirely on the outside of the vehicle.
 It weighs i6.ooo pounds. It gives the Air-borne Division the
 first capability of antitank defense.
 MR. F-.oon. You are going to send that against tanks?
 GENRRAI. DE GA\'RE. Yes, sir. This is the only thing that can
 be delivered by air. The present status is that they are now
 being procured for the air-borne divisions.
 MR. Ft.oou. It would be a suicide operation against tanks.
 I suppose no one can blame the Congressmen who have to pay
 the militarv hills for wanting to make sure they are not throwing
 money away on dubious projects. But it must be difficult to run a
 defense establishment in a goldfish bowl.
 Both the Congressmen and the generals are careful to go "off the
 record" when the testimony involves classified material. But this act
 of patriotism is also duly recorded in the printed hearings, and I
 often learned as much from seeing where a deletion was made as I
 might have learned if the testimony had been printed verbatim.
 An example of this came on the afternoon of January R, I9r,7,
 when Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy was appearing before a
 House subcommittee on tlefense appropriations and Nir. I)an hood
 was leading him across the griddle. They were talking about setting
 up Thor missiles in England, and the testimony, as reprinted in the
 hearings, went like this:
 MR. Ft.oon. Now, do you fellows really think that you are
 going to have IRRNI bases, with squachrons, troops, hardware,
 installations, launchers, missiles: with the electric light all
 ready to push a hutton, in the British Isles before Christmas
 of tgr,S? Do you really mean that?
 SECRETARY MCEI.Ro Y.  I believe it.
 MR.  Ft.oon. So at the very, very earliest-and this is even
 mcntey-we will have one operational squadron. and paren-
 thetically I doubt it-

 opinion is you will have nothing resent hling-

 MR. Ft.ooo. You will have no British. or anything else, for

 SECRETARY NICEI.ROv. If that is true we will have had an
 outrand-out failure.
 MR.  Ft.oon. American?
 SECRETARY MCEI.ROY. AmericaItS or-
 MR. Fi.oon. rust Americans.
 SECRETARY NICEI.Rov. The early ones will be manned by
 Americans simply in order to get going.
 \IR. Fu.oon. That Is what I say.
 SECRETARY MCEl.ROY. We would expect to have the second
 one available by early tg5q.
 (Discussion off the record.1
 NfR. Fi.ooo. That makes my second question important, at
 least to tue. 't'hat makes me unhappy.
 It certainly slid not make \Varsaw or Moscow unhappy to learn
 that whatever was said "off the record'' in that conversation had
 matle A'Ir. Flood unhappy. I sent all of the fat volumes of Ccmgres-
 sional testimony to Z-2 by diplomatic pouch. But i usually skintnued
 through them first-if only for laughs.
 Despite the stacks of magazines, hooks, pamphlets and Congres-
 sional transcripts which i kept stuffing into the potuclu and sending
 off to Warsaw, !-2 was never quite satisfied. It wantetl maps anti
 charts, too. In Iqr~ I got a request to gather descriptions of all the
 major U.S. seaports. To make sure i did not forget anything, Warsaw
 sent along a list of some to questions which it wanted me to
 answer about each port. How sleep was the harbor? I-low wide and
 deep were the channels? \Vhere were the rail?oatl sidings and repair
 shops? Where slid the pilots go aboard? \Vhat was the tide?
 I knew from the sound of the query that these questions did not
 reflect only Warsaw's curiosity. As usual, Moscow was using us to
 learn some things its own attaches could not fund out. When the
 cable arrived I was tempted to answer that i could not possihly
 tackle such a task without at least a year to do the work and a staff
 of twenty or thirty people to help me. But I decided I had better
 give it a try. I sent for two assistants who hall already been to
 Norfolk-which was one of the ports on the list-and ordered them
 to start the project there as a test run. The men worked at Norfolk
 for several days, but when they returned they liad only a few rough
 sketches and a few pages of notes. The job was too tough for such
 a frontal approach.
 Then, a few weeks later, I had a great stroke of luck. I had gone
 to the Government Printing Office to pick up some unclassified
 reports i needed, and when the clerk brouilit them to me I asked
 him if-by any chance-he had a good unclassified report on the
 port of Baltimore, which was also on my list. He went to find out.
 A few minutes later he returned with two volumes. One was a book
 which had been put out by U.S. Army engineers describing the
 Baltimore port; the other was a catalogue listing similar studies of
 other U.S. ports. I thanked the clerk for his trouble and went out
 to my car. As I started to leaf through the books I almost jumped

 about twenty-five dollars-plus a gallon or so of gas getting us to

 saute information-and if he had been Stuart. enough to (tole it out
 to me a few facts at a time to make it look really difficult-he could
 easily have Ileeced me of at least fifty thousand dollars. To Warsaw
 and to Moscow, the information I turned in was worth every bit of
 that.

 lucky. i stumbled onto a catalogue one day, from a firm in
 California, which offered aerial maps of the U.S.-to U.S. citizens
 only.
 i wrote the firm a letter-over a phony signature-ancl explained
 that i was a private pilot and needed navigational maps of the
 Philadelphia-Baltimore-\Vashington area to keep me from getting
 lost. The firm apparently took pity on me, for, in a week or so I got
 the charts I asked for, :long with a friendly letter thanking me for
 my business. The charts were exactly what I needed. So I wrote a
 few store letters to the saute company-I always liked to do business
 with the same people ii they were efficient. In a few weeks I had
 gradually built up my collection until I had a complete set of maps
 covering the entire U.S. When i showed them to the Soviet air
 attache, he was so amazed that he tried to take them from me.
 I would not let him have them.
 "But how dicl you get them   he asked.
 i would not tell him. i knew that Moscow would receive its own
 copies of the maps eventually-Warsaw would have to see to that.
 But we clicl not have to inform Moscow how and where we got

 THE RUSSIANS RUN THE SHOW
 The Russians were never content just to sit and wait for the
 material I was gathering   ter id I, they were running the show, and
 as our senior partners in \Vashington they worked hard to keep us
 'stirred up atul eager and to co-ordinate and guide our efforts to their
 own ends. The Russians always wanted more details included in
 our reports than we would normally provide our own headquarters.
 They liked to get their facts by the gross, not by the dozen. And,
 like fish peddlers, they wanted the material delivered fast, while it
 was still fresh. They still do. If a small conntpany in Detroit receives
 a contract for five thousand dollars' worth of spare parts for tanks,
 Moscow heats about it innmecliately. If an Air Force jet crashes
 during a routine flight over the Nevada desert, 1\1oscow wants to
 know.Ancl if the Soviet attaches in \Vashington learn that a single,
 isolated battalion of GI's has just been moved from one post to
 another, they send a coded cable about it to Moscow that very day.
 Because of all this vitality, Moscow receives a tremendous flood of
 information every clay, a good deal of it made up of bits and pieces
 of unrelatec) minutiae. But 114oscow is ready and eager for all this
 chaff. At Soviet intelligence headquarters-which has the formidable
 name of Gfna'nnje Razwiedowatelnoje Uprawleni.e and is located
 near Red Square and the Kremlin-a task force of sore five thou-
 sand trained experts sloes nothing but sort, fit together and analyze
 the thousands of pieces of intelligence which pore in from the U.S.
 alone by mail, cable and radio. Nothing is too insignificant to wind
 up in Moscow. As the Soviet military attache in Washington, Gen-
 eral .Aleksander Rodionov, once told me, "\Ve can use every detail.
 If we do not use it in a war, we can at least turn it over to our
 sabotage teams. Bring us everything: be a sponge."
 Because the Russians could not travel freely around the U.S., my
 office did a lot of sponging for them. But the Russians also worked
 hard themselves. The office of the Soviet military attache in Wash-
 ington had a staff of about forty people. Sometimes these agents
 were joined by reinforcements. In 1957, a few days before a great
 Armed Forces Day celebration in Washington, three high-ranking
 Soviet officers flew in from Moscow disguised as diplomats on an
 inspection trip. Actually the officers were specialists in analyzing new
 weapons simply by lookitg at them from a distance, and their job
 on this trip was to watch the parades and visit the public displays
 and make an appraisal of any new guns, tanks, planes or other
 equipment that the Americans might unveil.
 The Russians were never bashful about asking for our help. In
 May, t 9,i7, the U.S. Navy was host to a gigantic naval review in the
 waters off Norfolk. The purpose of the review was to celebrate the

 In the spring of IO6 I got orders from \Varsaw to make a scouting
 trip to Oak Riclge, "Tennessee, and learn all 1 could ah0ut the
 Atomic Energy (A)IIIIIIissiull's huge center there for processing anti
 testing nuclear materials. I knew alsolutely nothing about nuclear
 physics or atomic energy.  nc1 though 1 had never been near Oak
 Ridge. 1 (11d know that the auea was extremely well guarded and
 that 1 would he lucky it 1 saw anything at all. None of these prob-
 Ien1s deterred \\'ais;nv. I was told to collect precise information on
 ally, nuc?le:u piles which were berated on the reservation, where the
 main resc:u'ch lahoratories were, what kinds of roads ran through
 the :urea, where the fences ;ttul guard posts were, how n)any people
 worked at Oak Ridge aucl where they lived, what the travel restric-
 tiOns were. where the power plants stood and exactly where the
 power lines ran from one section of the complex to another.
 It was ('leu? to 111(', as soon as I started to decode the orders, that
 \\'arsaw was not fully responsible for them. Only the Russians would
 want to know so much about a place like Oak Ridge-this was their
 style-and my real customer on this trip was obviously the Soviet
 Union. \?ly suspicions we,rc confirmed shortly before I left on the
 trip. Colonel Sergei L(lelnsky, the assistant Soviet military attache
 in \Vashington, looked nie (i]).
 "\Vherc arc yon going in Tennessee  he asked me.
 "l-Io\v did you know I was going to Tennessee?" I said.
 "Oh." Edc11lsky answered with a smile. "somehody told me.,.
 I took C;Ipulin C01a(h with inc. \Ve traveled the first leg, from
 \Vashington to Nashville, by train. The FBI joined us in Nashville.
 \\'e Ii lied a car there and tried to lose our friends before we left
 the city. But they covered all possible avenues of escape, and we
 fin.illy headed for Oak Riclge in a caravan of cars, three of which
 belonged to the Ii .5. government.
 As 1 had expected, we did not see much. \Ve were able to drive
 off onto a number of roads in the Oak Ridge area, but we could
 never go far. No matter what direction we drove in, we always ran
 into a high, guarded fence which kept everyone-including unau-
 thorized residents of the area-from getting even close to the im-
 portant sites. There were signs posted along the roads forbidding
 anyone to stop. So while Colach drove slowly, I took what pictures
 and notes I conlcl. The traffic piled up behind us several times, and
 we could hear horns honking. Therc were no signs which said we
 conlcl not chive at five miles an hour, however, so we ignored the
 impatient horn blowers. I was able to draw a rough map on which
 I tried to plot the fences, the gates and some of the distant buildings.
 But 1 had no idea which building was which. And with the FBI
 creeping along behind and ahead of us wherever we went, I could'
 hardly stop to take a gootl look or ask questions.
 A few weeks after I sent in my report I received a cable from Z-2
 complaining that it was neither very valuable nor very interesting.
 The Soviet air attache in Washington, however-who had apparently
 been given a good fill-in on what I wrote to Warsaw-was more
 charitable.
 "\\re would like to know a lot more." he admitted, "but we (lid
 learn some things from your report which we did not know before."
 I assured the colonel that he now knew everything that I knew
 about Oak Ridge-and probably everything that anyone could learn
 about it when he had such unwelcon)e company tagging along. I
 suggested, since the Russians could not even get within five hundred
 miles of Tennessee-much less Oak Ridge-that they ought to be
 satisfied with small favors. The colonel assured me they were.
 As in everything else, the Russians also took the lead in the
 Communist social whirl in Washington. The two biggest events on
 the annual calendar which were organized just for the brotherhood
 were a New Year's party for the children of all the Co>)nm)nist

 The best. bait for luring recruits is money. Some candidates re-
 spond well to more idealistic approaches-like appeals to peace,
 disarmament, love of the masses and so on. But idealism can vanish
 quickly in times of stress and changing conditions-or if the game
 gets rough. If a man has been hooked by money, however-and is
 literally in Communism's (lebt-he is much less likely to get away.
 In my safe at the annex I kept from four to five thousand dollars

 The season lasted all year. Every day, wherever I went, I checked
 Hil the streams I could find for promising ripples.. i met many peo-

 and on hustling streets. Every time I met. someone for the first time

 such an obsession with me-ancl such an automatic reaction-that I
 actually began to hate myself for it. i had friends and acquaintances
 in Washington-among the Americans, especially-whom i wool'l
 never have thought of trying to recruit. But. even when I saw one of
 these people the annoying thought crossed my mind--"Peru, n~

 who told her she hacl come from Argentina. That night 1vIrs

 the park together. Ancl at five o'clock, when the German came to
 meet his wife, she was already chatting with the Tananas. Tanana
 intro(luce(1 himself as a Polish diplomat-without mentioning that
 he was assigned to niy office. The man explained that lie had left
 Germany for Argentina after World \Var 11 and had come to the
 U.S. from there. Tanana was certain, since this fitted the pattern,
 that he was an SS officer or a ranking Nazi who had fled German"
 for his life. l'he Gcrnrin said he was now working in \Vashington
 as a scientific adviser for a government agency which Tanana knew
 (11(1 research in nuclear physics. The German, then, was a nrett"
 big trout, an(t "Tanana was careful to pick the right lure.
 As it turned out, the German and Tanana found a ~*ood deal to
 talk about. Before the war the German's family had owned an
 estate in Pomerania near the one-time German port of Stettin.
 \fter the war the city was returned to Poland and renamed
 Szczecin. This was just. the opening Tanana needed. The man had
 once lived in an area which he could no longer visit because it now
 belonged to us.
 \\rc I(Ivisecl WarsaW of all this, and Z-2 told us to pay out more
 line and take our time. Because of its location in the heart of Wash-
 ington's diplomatic colony, we knew that the park where Tanana
 first met the German was probably under FBI surveillance. But It
 Ivas also full of governesses and perambulators and squealing hahies,
 so I deci(lect to take a chance and let Tanana meet him there a few
 more times before we started to reel in.
 After a week or two the Tananas asked the German and his wife
 to their apartment for dinner, an(1 later on the Tananas returned
 the visit. The friendship grew, and after about a year the German
 mentioned that he and his wife were going to West Germany for a
 three-months' holiday. We advised \Varsaw of this, and Z-2 sug-
 gested we try to persuade him to visit his family home near Szczecin
 for old times' sake. 7_-2 said it would expedite visas for him and
 would try to recruit him for us when he got inside Poland.
 Tanana mentioned the idea of a side trip to his friend, but the
 German turned it down.
 "No," he said sadly, "I have no relatives left in Poland. It would
 be like visiting a cemetery. I will stay in Germany where my
 friends are."
 He and his wife did go to Germany. And when they returned to
 Washington, Tanana went to work on him again. I left the U.S. at
 this time and returned to Warsaw, but from the reports I read out
 of Washington I gathered that the friendship deepened to the point
 where the German was talking rather freely about his work and that
 Tanana was drawing him closer by loaning him money. The Ger-
 man always repaid these loans promptly-he did not want to be
 in anyone's debt. But Tanana had his friend's signature on several
 IOU's, and the German-whether he knew it or not-was hooked.
 In the fall of 1957 I got orders from Warsaw to recruit a new
 agent in the Washington-Baltimore-Wilmington Philadelphia area.
 Someone at Z-2 had apparently taken a look at the map and decided
 there was a pin missing.
 I split the assignment up among my assistants, and they went to
 work immediately. Because of its location I chose Baltimore as our
 main target and assigned it to Captain Golach. I paid special at-
 tention to his search. Golach and I held conferences at frequent
 intervals in my office to discuss the progress he was making. The
 going was slow and Golach became very discouraged. Then one
 morning he came in with a broad smile on his face.

 three hunched, but Golach gave only another hunched. Golach got
 an IOU lrotn Daniel and told him to write as soon as he got to
 California-in care of a special post-office box which he had set tip
 in Baltimore.
 This was part of Golach's second big mistake-which was really a
 triple header. I-Ic gave Daniel too much money: he neglected to ask
 Daniel to show him the letter from his uncle promising hint a job:
 and he failed to keep a leash on Daniel as he left. All of these mis-
 takes were inexcusable. Golach should have thought up sonic kind
 of pretext for going to California with Daniel-if indeed 1)anicl ever
 went there-and helping him get settled. Failing that, he should at
 least have warned Daniel in unmistakable terms that he would find
 him wherever he went, and that it would be extremely dangerous
 for Daniel to try to cheat him. Since I was responsible for Golach's
 work, I was also responsible for his mistakes. But it never occurred
 to me he would bungle the job so badly. By the time I found out, it
 was too late.
 It was humiliating to have to get back on the cable one more
 time and admit to Warsaw that Danicl had apparently disappeared
 with our two hundred dollars without leaving a trace. I assumed
 that he became frightened when Golach pressed hint too hard, and
 decided to run before he was trapped. He may have suspected that
 Golach and Pluta were intelligence agents. But I did not think he
 would report these suspicions to the FBI. His own behavior was
 not exactly savory.
 Considering the risks we took, it was a close call. I was relieved
 to get out of it with nothing worse than a stern reprimand from
 Warsaw. As T-2 was quick to point out, we had been extremely
 careless. We had gone fishing and let a really hungry one get away.

 THE FABULOUS PROFESSOR-
 AND A MATA HARI
 Espionage is a spider web, and few flies who come near it ever get
 away. Ancl the web stretches far. Though the United States is the
 chief target of Communist espionage, not all of the activities di-
 rected against the U.S. are carried on within her borders. The web,
 taut and strong, is spun into every corner of the world where
 Americans-or their friends-are likely to appear.
 One of the most colorful spiders ever involved in Polish espionage
 against the U.S. was a man we called "The Professor." He entered
 the U.S. only once or twice-and then on brief forays. But he played
 an important and fascinating role..\nd the preparations which went
 into creating the role are typical of the elaborate lengths to which
 the Communists will go to learn the \Vest's secrets-and trap its
 flies.
 We got to know The Professor in a strange way. Late one eve-
 ning in 1951, when I was still stationed at intelligence headquarters
 in Warsaw, the sentry at the front desk called to say that a stranger
 had just arrived and asked to see any of our top officials. This was
 not so easily done, of course. We had strong security measures at
 the door, to keep strangers out. The Duty Officer told the sentry to
 ask the visitor what he wanted.
 "He won't talk to me," the sentry said. "He wants to see one of
 the chiefs."
 The chiefs were gone for the day, but the Duty Officer had the
 stranger escorted inside to get his story. The man identified himself
 as Pioter Wlazlo, a member of the Polish Foreign Trade Ministry.
 He had information, he said, which he would give only to someone
 in authority. The Duty Officer decided, after studying his creden-
 tials, that Wlazo was on the level and arranged for him to meet
 with the Deputy Chief of intelligence the next morning. When
 Wlazo returned and was closeted with the Deputy Chief, he ex-
 plained that he had just returned from a trade mission to West
 Germany. While he was there, he said, he had made notes and
 sneaked some pictures of various French, British and American
 military installations. He thought they might be important and he
 wanted us to have them.
 Wlaz~o's report was well written. It did not contain anything very
 new or valuable, but we were much impressed. Here was a, dignified,
 good-looking and intelligent gentleman of about forty-five who
 showed a real flair for intelligence work and who had gone to a
 great deal of trouble to volunteer his services. We asked him about
 his background.
 W1azlo replied that he was born in Poland but had lived for
 many years in France with his parents, who went there as emigres.
 In 1936, he said, he went to Spain to fight with a group of Polish
 volunteers for the Republican Army. When this army was defeated,
 he returned to France, married a French girl and settled down.
 When World War II began, he volunteered again-this time with
 the French resistance groups-and, fought with them until he fled
 with his wife to England. After the war, he said, he came to Warsaw,
 joined the Communist party and got a job with the Foreign Trade
 Ministry. He spoke good English, excellent French-with no accent
 -and fluent Spanish.
 The Deputy Chief thanked Wlazo for this information and told
 him we would get in touch with him. Then we started checking into
 his past and looking up his records. Secret police and counterintelli-
 gence agents began to shadow him to determine who his friends

 were and the kind of life he led. His party record, we discovered,
 was impeccable. There seemed to be no personal or political skele-
 tons in his background.
 We called Wlazlo back when all the returns were in and bluntly
 offered him a job. As a staff member of the American section at
 headquarters, I sat in on these discussions. We agreed that the best
 assignment for such an enterprising man was intelligence work
 against the U.S. But we decided, because of his proficiency in Span-
 ish, to plant him next door to the U.S., in Mexico, where we knew
 there was a good deal of anti-Yankee sentiment among the Intellec-
 tuals and where he could he of more value to us. Wlazlo was agree-
 able to this plan. The only request he made was that we allow his
 wife to accompany him; he had no children. After a brief discussion,
 we agreed.
 Then began the process of training Wlazlo for his new career and
 of getting him into position. Since we expected him to be a senior
 and very valuable agent, the plans had to be drawn up with great
 care. First we had to devise a good cover for him-or, in Polish, a
 Legend, i matca. We decided he would play the role of a rich,
 slightly eccentric professor, a scholar who liked to write as a hobby,
 and who specialized in history. We had the Professor begin research-
 ing and writing a book on Mexican-U.S. relations of the nineteenth
 century. This, we knew, would bring him into contact with Mexican
 intellectuals, and would give him a logical excuse for residing in
 Mexico for a few years.
 We also decided not to send the Professor to Mexico as a Pole-
 which might have aroused suspicions and hampered his work-but
 as a Frenchman. This meant we had to give him a new nationality.
 Here, the special technical branch of 7_-a was put to work. This
 skillful office, which is located on Wawelska Street in Warsaw, next
 to Air Force headquarters, has a staff of about seventy expert crafts-
 men working behind guarded doors, who can turn out all kinds of
 fake espionage props from authentic-looking Florida drivers' licenses
 and Guatemalan birth certificates to Finnish alien registration cards
 and hotel stationery from Wilmington, North Carolina. The crafts-
 men are incredibly exact in their work. In order to forge a passport
 which will pass the most careful inspector, they must use paper, ink,
 watermarks, seals and even signatures which exactly match the real
 thing. They also develop tiny transistor radios and install miniature
 cameras in such unlikely places as tobacco pouches and coat lapels.
 And they once hollowed out a brick which the Polish attache in
 Brussels had found loose in a wall, sent along to Warsaw to be hol-
 lowed out by our professional brick hollowers, then replaced in the
 wall as a secret drop.
 The technical branch did an expert job of turning The Professor
 into a convincing Frenchman. It began by forging passports for him
 and his wife-along with a stack of other documents including birth
 certificates, employment records, a marriage license and similar
 forms which were identical in every respect to their French models.
 Then, to illustrate The Professor's claim that he came from a
 wealthy French family in southern France-when in reality he had
 grown up in a working-class Polish family in northern France-we
 presented him with an album of family portraits and snapshots
 which dated back several generations and reconstructed a make-
 believe family which had never existed. The album included group
 pictures of The Professor posing with children he did not have and
 an assortment of grandmothers, cousins and aunts who never lived-
 at least not in Wlazto's family. These tricks were performed in the
 technical branch by putting together fake photographs and clever
 montages, each of which had to be posed against authentic back-
 grounds, printed on authentic paper, mounted in authentic frames,
 signed on the bottom with authentic-looking signatures of actual
 photographers and then carefully aged, torn or wrinkled to make
 them look authentically ancient. The Professor, of course, had to be
 carefully briefed on who all these unauthentic people in the photo-
 graphs were.
 The next task was to make The Professor look, talk, behave and
 seem like a scholar. %\Tlazfo was an intelligent man, and this feat
 was not so difficult. But to give him more depth, we decided to pre-
 tend that he had been delving into the culture of the Aztec Indians
 before he got involved in Mexican-U.S. history, and had even writ-
 ten a learned treatise on the subject. We actually wrote that treatise
 in Warsaw-with Wlazfio joining in so he could answer questions
 about it if the subject ever came up-and we even went to the
 trouble of printing fake clippings from well-known newspapers com-
 menting on the paper as a brilliant exercise in anthropology. To
 top off this part of the project, we compiled a small personal library
 for The Professor to take with him. It consisted of some learned
 French volumes on Aztec lore and Mexican history, and The Pro-
 fessor had to read every word of them.
 All of this material-the passports, birth certificates, photograph
 albums, treatises, clippings and library-made up what is known in
 the espionage trade as an agent's "collection." It provided The Pro-
 fessor with good camouflage and an aura of real authenticity. Put-
 ting The Professor's collection together-and briefing him on how
 to use it-took two years. But, with an important mission at stake,
 we were in no hurry.
 There was one final touch. The Professor we had designed was
 also supposed to be eccentric. We decided that if he acted a bit
 strangely he would be more likely to pass unnoticed in the circles
 which we expected him to frequent. To accomplish this, we simply
 gave him a small, shiny, well-rubbed pebble to carry in a vest
 pocket. It was supposed to be a good-luck piece which he had found
 on a beach in southern France at the moment he first saw his bride-
 to-be. We told him to take the stone out once in a while, rub it
 and show it to his new friends. We hoped it would convince them
 that he was a gallant-and Gallic gentletnan.
 The biggest problen- now was to get The Professor into Mexico.
 Wes could hardly expect anyone to believe that a French professor-

 was impeccable. There seemed to be no personal or political skele-
 tons in his background.
 We called Wlazlo back when all the returns were in and bluntly
 offered him a job. As a staff member of the American section at
 headquarters, I sat in on these discussions. We agreed that the best
 assignment for such an enterprising man was intelligence work
 against the U.S. But we decided, because of his proficiency in Span-
 ish, to plant him next door to the U.S., in Mexico, where we knew
 there was a good deal of anti-Yankee sentiment among the Intellec-
 tuals and where he could he of more value to us. Wlazlo was agree-
 able to this plan. The only request he made was that we allow his
 wife to accompany him; he had no children. After a brief discussion,
 we agreed.
 Then began the process of training Wlazlo for his new career and
 of getting him into position. Since we expected him to be a senior
 and very valuable agent, the plans had to be drawn up with great
 care. First we had to devise a good cover for him-or, in Polish, a
 Legend, i matca. We decided he would play the role of a rich,
 slightly eccentric professor, a scholar who liked to write as a hobby,
 and who specialized in history. We had the Professor begin research-
 ing and writing a book on Mexican-U.S. relations of the nineteenth
 century. This, we knew, would bring him into contact with Mexican
 intellectuals, and would give him a logical excuse for residing in
 Mexico for a few years.
 We also decided not to send the Professor to Mexico as a Pole-
 which might have aroused suspicions and hampered his work-but
 as a Frenchman. This meant we had to give him a new nationality.
 Here, the special technical branch of 7_-a was put to work. This
 skillful office, which is located on Wawelska Street in Warsaw, next
 to Air Force headquarters, has a staff of about seventy expert crafts-
 men working behind guarded doors, who can turn out all kinds of
 fake espionage props from authentic-looking Florida drivers' licenses
 and Guatemalan birth certificates to Finnish alien registration cards
 and hotel stationery from Wilmington, North Carolina. The crafts-
 men are incredibly exact in their work. In order to forge a passport
 which will pass the most careful inspector, they must use paper, ink,
 watermarks, seals and even signatures which exactly match the real
 thing. They also develop tiny transistor radios and install miniature
 cameras in such unlikely places as tobacco pouches and coat lapels.
 And they once hollowed out a brick which the Polish attache in
 Brussels had found loose in a wall, sent along to Warsaw to be hol-
 lowed out by our professional brick hollowers, then replaced in the
 wall as a secret drop.
 The technical branch did an expert job of turning The Professor
 into a convincing Frenchman. It began by forging passports for him
 and his wife-along with a stack of other documents including birth
 certificates, employment records, a marriage license and similar
 forms which were identical in every respect to their French models.
 Then, to illustrate The Professor's claim that he came from a
 wealthy French family in southern France-when in reality he had
 grown up in a working-class Polish family in northern France-we
 presented him with an album of family portraits and snapshots
 which dated back several generations and reconstructed a make-
 believe family which had never existed. The album included group
 pictures of The Professor posing with children he did not have and
 an assortment of grandmothers, cousins and aunts who never lived-
 at least not in Wlazto's family. These tricks were performed in the
 technical branch by putting together fake photographs and clever
 montages, each of which had to be posed against authentic back-
 grounds, printed on authentic paper, mounted in authentic frames,
 signed on the bottom with authentic-looking signatures of actual
 photographers and then carefully aged, torn or wrinkled to make
 them look authentically ancient. The Professor, of course, had to be
 carefully briefed on who all these unauthentic people in the photo-
 graphs were.
 The next task was to make The Professor look, talk, behave and
 seem like a scholar. %\Tlazfo was an intelligent man, and this feat
 was not so difficult. But to give him more depth, we decided to pre-
 tend that he had been delving into the culture of the Aztec Indians
 before he got involved in Mexican-U.S. history, and had even writ-
 ten a learned treatise on the subject. We actually wrote that treatise
 in Warsaw-with Wlazfio joining in so he could answer questions
 about it if the subject ever came up-and we even went to the
 trouble of printing fake clippings from well-known newspapers com-
 menting on the paper as a brilliant exercise in anthropology. To
 top off this part of the project, we compiled a small personal library
 for The Professor to take with him. It consisted of some learned
 French volumes on Aztec lore and Mexican history, and The Pro-
 fessor had to read every word of them.
 All of this material-the passports, birth certificates, photograph
 albums, treatises, clippings and library-made up what is known in
 the espionage trade as an agent's "collection." It provided The Pro-
 fessor with good camouflage and an aura of real authenticity. Put-
 ting The Professor's collection together-and briefing him on how
 to use it-took two years. But, with an important mission at stake,
 we were in no hurry.
 There was one final touch. The Professor we had designed was
 also supposed to be eccentric. We decided that if he acted a bit
 strangely he would be more likely to pass unnoticed in the circles
 which we expected him to frequent. To accomplish this, we simply
 gave him a small, shiny, well-rubbed pebble to carry in a vest
 pocket. It was supposed to be a good-luck piece which he had found
 on a beach in southern France at the moment he first saw his bride-
 to-be. We told him to take the stone out once in a while, rub it
 and show it to his new friends. We hoped it would convince them
 that he was a gallant-and Gallic gentletnan.
 The biggest problen- now was to get The Professor into Mexico.
 Wes could hardly expect anyone to believe that a French professor-

 There was one final touch. The Professor we had designed was
 also supposed to be eccentric. We decided that if he acted a bit
 strangely he would be more likely to pass unnoticed in the circles
 which we expected him to frequent. To accomplish this, we simply
 gave him a small, shiny, well-rubbed pebble to carry in a vest
 pocket. It was supposed to be a good-luck piece which he had found
 on a beach in southern France at the moment he first saw his bride-
 to-be. We told him to take the stone out once in a while, rub it
 and show it to his new friends. We hoped it would convince them
 that he was a gallant-and Gallic gentletnan.
 The biggest problen- now was to get The Professor into Mexico.
 Wes could hardly expect anyone to believe that a French professor-

 was a totally dedicated Communist; (2) 1 was a professional soldier

 southeastern section of I'olanel, in an area-not far from the Ru-
 tttanian border-which is sonietin-es called Galicia. The name of
 the town was Stanislawow, i\?Iy father was not wealthy, but he was
 able to put me through high school-or gymnasium, as it is called
 in Europe. I was a good student, but no bookworm. I enjoyed sports
 and was an expert broad-juniper and a fair tennis player. The girls
 in town seemed to like tity jokes and company. One of them, whose
 name was 1\Iaria, later became nny wife. But we did not appreciate
 each other at thg time. She was too young for me. I had no brothers
 or sisters.
 The Russians carte into our lives in September, iO 9, when they
 invaded eastern Poland while the Germans starched in from the
 west. The name of our town was changed then-to Stanislav, to
 acconunodate the Russian tongue-ancl all the trappings of Soviet
 Conumniisni, including police and propaganda, descended upon us.
 That saute year, at the age of eighteen, I joined the local Conuntt-
 nist youth organization, Komsomol. Automatically, as was the case

 i protested as strongly as .i could that such an order was contrary
 to all the principles of Soviet-Polish friendship. But Kozuch was
 adamant.
 "If you do nnl wish to return to your own country," he said,
 "there is only one thing you can do. Ynu must get to the Soviet
 consulate here and sign a petition asking Ploscow to release you.''
 This. i knew, tvoulcl he a dangerous move. It would arouse the
 suslricions not only of the Russians but also of my ()vn government.
 It nvas ironic that. i vas not trying to Main Polish citizcnshili. I al-
 ready had that. i was sintlily trying to shake nfl' my Soviet citizen-
 ship so i could stay in Poland.
 it was not that any Polish citizcnship meant nose to one than
 being a good Communist. The troth, in fact, was the other way
 around..~ncl that ivas what hurt. i knew in ntv heart that I was as
 dedicated a Communist as anyone. Rut (:nnmittnis in to me wits an

 whether we were Russians, Poles, Germans-or :\ntericans. And

 be a good Communist. In this case. I thought, it tvas the Russians
 who were being petty anti chauvinistic. it was they, not I, who were
 indulging in bourgeois sentimentality.
 Finally I told Colonel Kozuch that i %0111(1 sign a petition and
 ask for permission to stay in Poland. Rut. I did not actually do so.
 I kept quiet for a few months, hoping ny case would get lost in
 red tape and that the crisis n?ould go away. But it did not. i was
 called hack to Colonel Kozuch's oli c, and another ctfficcr saw me.
 He knew I had been stalling, he said. Nnw I had to nrtke niy choice.
 I took a taxi home and cxplaincd the situation to Maria. She was
 terrified. She knew that if I went to the Soviet iJoinn she would
 probably never see tie again. Such human prohlculs as keeping a
 family together are not ccrosidercd innpnitant in the (:onitmunist
 world. I decided, aher talking with her, that I had to take a chalice
 and put my name on a petition. I went to the soviet consulate on
 First Army Alice in Warsaw and asked the clerk for whatever forms

 I left his office very depressed and wit Ii almost no hope. I heard
 nothing more about the problem for nearly a year. 1 worried every
 week that the order would come soon for me to pack and head for
 Russia. Then, at last, I got a special letter from the Polish State
 Council informing me that I was ncnv officially a Polish citizen. The
 Russians had finally relented and let inc go. i never did find out
 why. Perhaps, I decided, everyone had agreed that i could he more
 useful where I was. A friend of mine, however, tried to explain it
 to me with a joke.
 "In the Kremlin,'' he said, "they have a coin with a Polish eagle
 on one side and a Russian star on the other. Whenever they can't
 make tip their minds, they toss the coin. You wound up heads.''
 Back at the intelligence school, the lectures and the homework
 were tedious. Some of the training-to see how we would react
 under pressure-was rather severe. And being confined in the coun-
 try with nothing to do but work day and night was like being
 cooped up in a monastery. But I enjoyed the courses. i was espe-
 cially fascinated when we branched out from the school to practice
 recruiting strangers or listening for information in bars, cafes and
 theaters. Sometimes we discovered later that the stranger we had
 talked to was a special inspector from headquarters who had been
 planted there to see how well we performed.
 We also had to practice meeting other agents in public and pass-
 ing information back and forth without getting caught. One morn-
 ing I was instructed to meet a man at the main Warsaw Post Office
 on Nowogrodzka Street. I had to prepare the plan myself and sub-
 mit it to my superiors before the exercise. According to my own
 suggestion, I was to carry a handkerchief in my left hand-a sign
 which was repeated later for tie in New York-and a children's
 magazine called Pfornyk in my right hand. The stranger \vould hold

 illustrated magazine Przekrr j in the other. We both knew what
 kind of overcoat the other would he wearing, and we hall full stage
 directions. I was to enter the post office first, walk up to an empty
 clerk, take out my pen and start to address an envelope. The stranger
 was to follow me to the desk, take out his pen and fill out a money
 order.
 A classmate of mine-who was not aware of the plan-was sent
 along to observe the meeting and report back on my success. He
 watched me closely from across the room, and when he returned to
 the school he informed the class that I had failed to transfer any
 material. But he was wrong, and when the stranger arrived to
 critique the exercise he was able to prove it. I had rolled the ma-
 terial up in my pen, and my classmate was not quick enough to
 notice that when the stranger and I both laid our pens down to use
 the blotters on the desk, we quickly switched pens and I let him take
 mine. I got an "A" for that demonstration. My not-too-observant
 classmate did not do so well.
 Another favorite class was one in which we learned to under-
 stand foreign customs. I was especially interested in the U.S. way of
 life. Instructors who had traveled abroad told us how to behave in
 various countries so we could pass as natives. They showed us how
 clifl'erently different people use the knife and fork. And they told
 us that though a Polish man always offers his strong right arm to
 a lady on the street, a gentleman in the U.S. always walks next to
 the street-regardless of which arm this leaves free for the lady. We
 were also warne(1 that we would immediately give ourselves away as
 strangers in the U.S. if we ever got up on a bus, streetcar or subway
 to oiler our scat to a lady.
 After we graduated from Suloj(iwek we went to Z-2 headquarters
 on Aleja Niepodleglosci to draw our assignments. Headquarters is
 a huge, six-story office building which has been converted into a
 veritable fortress to protect all the secrets stored inside. All of the
 windows on the first floor-and many of them as high up as the fifth
 floor-are strongly barred. ;end the guard around the building is a
 heavy one. Even with a pass, a visitor must have an official escort
 to get inside. Special passes are required to take a brief case either
 in or out of the building. And even regular employees must stop at
 two (liflerent gates to show their credentials before they can pro-
 ceed. A young officer who once walked past one check point and
 into an elevator without showing his pass was machine-gunned
 through the elevator doors.
 I had my heart set on the American section at Z-2 even before I
 graduated. The idea ul pitting my wits against the U.S. intrigued
 inc most, an(I I bucked for the job. Most of my colleagues were
 being assigned to work against \Vest Germany, which the Russians
 ha(1 assigned to Poland as a special espionage responsibility. And
 though I ('0111(1 read English fairly well, I spoke very little of it.
 But I got the appointment, and my first assignment was as assistant
 chief of the :\ntcrican reports antl evaluation section. This was a
 fourteen-hour-a-day job an(l it, consisted of reading, compiling and
 elaborating on reports concerning U.S. clelense installations both in
 America( and in Europe. I pored over American field manuals and
 read stacks of American newspapers and magazines--a privilege
 which was then (lenie(l to the Polish public. I can remember to this
 clay that when I started work on the.U.S. it had ten army divisions
 for inc to worry about.. That was just before the Korean War.
 I can also remember how amazed I was at some of the things I
 learned about the U.S. in the American press. I could not under-
 stand the freedom with which Americans criticized their own insti-
 tutions and their leaders-though even then I envied this habit. And
 I was absolutely astonished to see American newspapers printing in
 full the speeches of ioseph Stalin and Mao Tse-tung. We never saw
 the speeches of Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman or Winston
 Churchill printed in our Communist papers, for they were the
 enemy. I decided that a country like the U.S., which could let its
 people he exposed to the full texts of Mao and Joseph Stalin, was
 either extremely foolhardy-or very secure and sure of itself.
 In between assignments in the American section, 1 continued a
 program of on-the-job-training to supplement the crash course I
 had taken at Sulojowck. I improved my English, took a few more
 courses in espionage techniques and stepped up my reading of
 American periodicals. And one day the training schedule was par-
 ticularly fascinating. I was allowed to visit a special storage area
 where Z-2 kept all the costumes and props from various countries
 which it might need someday to train or outfit an agent. There were
 five large rooms full of wall-to-wall closets devoted just to the U.S.
 The closets in this section were crammed to the doors with an assort-
 ment of American suits, belts, shoes, top hats, pipes and other ap-
 parel. I was told to study it all very carefully and acgaint myself
 with the look and style of the enemy.

 'OFF TO KOREA TO LEARN
 ABOUT THE U.S.
 The Korean War gave me my first golden chance to work against
 the U.S.
 I n'as still on the American clerk at 7.  when the wat' began, and
 I heard about it over an English-language broadcast which I was
 listening to at home. Tuning in on the \'Vcst was a serious off'cIlse-
 even for someone in Illy position-so I was reluctant to mention,
 when I got to the oflice, that there seemed to be a war ort. But my
 superiors were scx>n calling me up to find out what I knew about
 the .\uU?eican troops in Korea, and I knew then that the report must
 be true.
 For the first few clays of the war, while the North Koreans were
 pushing the South Koreans back along the 38th Parallel, \Varsaw
 was officially agog. A huge map was erected in a public square, and
 the advancing Conin>unist positions were plotted on it, clay by day,
 so the Polish people could follow the victory of their Asian brothers.
 But then the war bogged down. And when the U.S. and its United
 Nations allies began to chase the North Koreans hack where they
 came front, Ilo one bothered any longer to keep the map up to date.
 It just stood there in the square, a silent, mocking reminder of
 Communist frustration.
 \\'ith the U.S. at war, Communist intelligence agents had a field
 clay. Instead of watching Ameri an soldiers on harmless maneuvers,
 we could now see how they performed in actual battle. Our attaches
 were kept busy soaking up a I I the available information on U.S.
 troops in Korea-who their officers were, how well they fought, what
 equipment they were using, what new tactics they had devised and
 how they stood up under fire against an Oriental army on rugged
 Asian terrain. A colleague of mine. Lieutenant Colonel Stanislaw
 Sasin, was the Polish military attache in North Korea. He also
 served as our attache to Con>ntunist China, since Poland ccnld not
 afford to keep separate stalls in Ix>th countries. Sasin had his hands
 full clashing back and forth between Peiping and Pyongyang, and
 in both places his primary mission was to collect reports on how
 the ii IJICl7f!!>1 enemy was doing.
 In Septcnther, ty.,t, Colonel Sasin was killed-shot through the
 head by a U.S. jet which strafed a road he happened to he traveling
 on south of the Yalu. I was ordered to replace hint. A few months
 later, after sonic intensive briefing in \\'arsasv, Illy family and 1 got
 aboard a wain in \1'arsaw and 1 starlcd the long journey to the var.
 \Ve rode first to Moscow, where we transferred U) the trans-Siberian
 V      Express which took us to the small city of 1lanchuria on the Sino-
 Russian border. There 1 had a quick lesson in the strange behavior
 of our Chinese Conlmt>nist brothers. \\le had gone into the
 restaurant of the railroad station to have a mtcal while waiting to
 change trains, and 1 was trying to give my order to the waiter.
 Suddenly he dashed across the roost, grabbed ul> a II)' swatter anct
 beat two unfortunate flies to death. He rcttn?ned full of apologies for
 keeping mte waiting and explained that everyone had to be espe-
 cially vigilant along the borders because the flies kept sneaking in
 from foreign countries-like Russia.
 "I hope," the waiter said, "that Chairman Mao understands it is
 not our fault."
 This was only the beginning. Later on i saw thousands of Chinese
 at a time, beautifully organized into teams, racing around trying
 to catch mosquitoes by hand, anti stuffing the dead trophies into
 matchhoxes to see which team could make the best catch. it was a
 matter of patriotism. The Chinese went after sparrows and dogs
 with the same frenetic enthusiasm-1 could not find a Pekingese clog
 for ny family in all of Peiping. the reason behind this stational
 urge to obliterate nature was that Chairman Mao, who somehow
 finds time to say something about almost everything that goes on
 in China, had decreed that flies, sparrows, mosquitoes and dogs
 were breeders of disease and wasters of food and that they all had
 to go.
 Whatever Mao says is gospel. He is highly revered, even when
 the system he personifies breaks clown and there is a famine which
 could be traced to bad management. The people affectionately call
 him Mao Chi-si, or "Chairman Mao." And even when things are
 bad they are likely to say, "Mao Chi-si knows; he will take care of
 us." Of course if they do not say this, the man next door may notice
 and they will be reported. For the Communists have organized
 everybody-from blocks of houses up through villages to huge
 cities-into a fabulously efficient grapevine which keeps track of
 the whole population. A man is not allowed to walk to the next
 village-even to see his fiancee or his sick mother-without stating
 his reasons to the authorities and procuring a pass, which has a time
 limit. There is very little chance under such strict controls for a
 man to exercise judgment or raise his voice. And it was a sobering
 thought, even to a regimented Communist like myself, that any
 people could be so deeply motivated, so thoroughly organized and
 so efficiently deployed by their government.
 Chairman Mao even managed to have an influence on my private
 life. My wife and I returned home one clay from a shopping trip to
 discover that our young son had been amusing himself by throwing
 mud pies at our walls. The amah, or nurse, had clone nothing to
 stop him, and when Maria started to give him his belated punish-
 melt the amah stopped her,

 Since we were guests in the amah's country-and knew that she
 would report us to the authorities if we stepped out of line-+ve let
 our son off easy. I can imagine why Mao Chi-si may have a hold
 over the youngsters.
 When I left Warsaw I was un(ler strict orders to be extremely
 careful in nuy dealings with the Chinese. It was no secret in the
 Communist camp that they were the most sensitive and (lilficult of
 all the partners to get along with. Even the Russians-who some-
 times whispered to the in Peiping that they were convinced the
 Chinese wcie "nuts"-walked on eggs when they dealt with them.
 The Chinese are very demanding of the Russians, and when they
 sent a huge army mu) North Korea to help bail the Russians and
 the North Koreans out of a losing war, they Ina(le it clear that
 they were particilrtti ng in the battle on their own terms and fighting
 it in their own way. I was especially warned before I left Warsaw
 never to let. the Chinese think for a moment that I was spying on
 them. I was to assure them that I was only interested in what they
 knew about the U.S.
 In Peiping the Chinese and I got along line. The Chinese Com-
 munists have an excellent system of espionage which is particularly
 active in places like Tokyo, Manila and Taipeh where American
 military men are plentiful. i was soon learning a good deal about
 American military activities front Chinese sources and passing the
 information along to Warsaw.
 The most sensible way for me to report on American fighting
 capabilities, however, was to go to Korea and find out for myself.
 In July,  I(f52, I hoarded a Chinese train at 1N'iukden in Manchuria
 for the ride to the Yalu. An incident on the train gave me a new
 insight into how (leeply involved the Russians were in the war.
 My fellow travelers on the train included a group of two hundred
 men who got on at the last minute, dressed in the green summer
 uniforms of the Chinese People's Volunteers. But they were not
 Chinese: they were Russians. And they were not simply Soviet
 military advisers, who were also present in Korea in large numbers.
 They were combat troops-antiaircraft gunners, combat engineers
 and pilots-an(1 they were going to Korea to fight. I)espit.e the
 camouflage of their uniforms, which they had been issued at
 1\4ukden to make it more difficult for American pilots to recognize
 them from the air when they got to Korea, the Russians made no
 bones about their role in the war. One of their favorite jokes on the
 train went like this:
 FIRST RnssiAN. \Vc have the best pilots in the world.
 Seconn RusslAN. Flow is that?
 FiRsl' RUSSIAN. RC(?:t(ISC they can fly with no hands.
 SrcoNn RussiAN. \Vhy (lo they do that?
 FIRS' RUSSIAN. They have to use their hands to slant their
 eyes so the Americans will think they are Koreans.
 During nuy frequent visits to North Korea I lived at the Polish
 embassy there, which was nothing more than a group of farm huts
 snuggling against a mountain some eighteen miles from Pyongyang,
 the bombed-out capital of the country. We shared our compound
 with diplomats and attaches from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
 Outer i\'Iongolia. it was a drab place, and diplomatic. protocol was
 necessarily reduced to a mininltnn. Our (lady existence was cheered
 up mainly by some bleating goats which the Mongolians had
 brought along with them and by a shall swimming pool which the
 Hungarians dug out of a rice paddy. We all gathered at the pool
 (luring the summer nonths to cool off and wash away the (lust-all
 of us, that is, except the Mongolians. They were too bashful to
 undress in public.
 The Chinese who were on duty in Korea lived up to their reputa-
 tion for being difficult. They were not nearly so co-operative as the
 Chinese i had met back in China. But they had a good reason. They
 were bending over backward trying to pretend that they were not
 in Korea at all-at least not officially-though pore than a pillion
 Chinese troops were south of the Yalu. They were there, they
 claimed, only as "volunteers," not as Chinese Army soldiers. This
 was a myth, but the Chinese defended it and kept it alive with the
 same dogged enthusiasm I had seen them display when they were
 killing mosquitoes. It was an absur(1 myth, but not to then. And
 even their best friends were expected to believe it. When I went to
 their headquarters in Korea to ask for information, the Chinese
 usually informed me-politely but firmly-that they could not
 help me.
 "But I ap accredited to your Defense Ministry in Peiping," I said.
 "We have no connection with the Defense Ministry," they an-
 swered with a smile. "You are not accredited to us. We are the
 Chinese People's Volunteers."
 In a way, the Chinese in Korea were volunteers. They came from
 regular Chinese units, and they were led by Peng Teh-huai, a
 famous marshal in the Chinese Army. But before they left China for
 the crusade in Korea they were lined up and harangued for hours
 by their political officers. These officers, who are experts at mass
 brainwashing, warned them that the American imperialists were
 sneaking up on their hopes through Korea and would soon be
 destroying their homeland if they were not repulsed. Those soldiers
 who felt patriotic enough to go out and defend their country, the
 officers said, could take one step forward. Those who did not feel
 quite so loyal to their loved ones could stand still. Thus, there was
 a choice. Then, as all the troops stepped forward-I never heard
 of a man who did not-they were told to remove the patches on
 their uniforms which read "Chinese People's Army" an(1 sew on new
 patches which read "Chinese People's Volunteers." It was as simple
 as that. One of the volunteers who switched patches was the eldest
 son of Mao Chi-si himself, a brave young infantry officer who was
 later killed fighting against American troops near Seoul.

 During nuy frequent visits to North Korea I lived at the Polish
 embassy there, which was nothing more than a group of farm huts
 snuggling against a mountain some eighteen miles from Pyongyang,
 the bombed-out capital of the country. We shared our compound
 with diplomats and attaches from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
 Outer i\'Iongolia. it was a drab place, and diplomatic. protocol was
 necessarily reduced to a mininltnn. Our (lady existence was cheered
 up mainly by some bleating goats which the Mongolians had
 brought along with them and by a shall swimming pool which the
 Hungarians dug out of a rice paddy. We all gathered at the pool
 (luring the summer nonths to cool off and wash away the (lust-all
 of us, that is, except the Mongolians. They were too bashful to
 undress in public.
 The Chinese who were on duty in Korea lived up to their reputa-
 tion for being difficult. They were not nearly so co-operative as the
 Chinese i had met back in China. But they had a good reason. They
 were bending over backward trying to pretend that they were not
 in Korea at all-at least not officially-though pore than a pillion
 Chinese troops were south of the Yalu. They were there, they
 claimed, only as "volunteers," not as Chinese Army soldiers. This
 was a myth, but the Chinese defended it and kept it alive with the
 same dogged enthusiasm I had seen them display when they were
 killing mosquitoes. It was an absur(1 myth, but not to then. And
 even their best friends were expected to believe it. When I went to
 their headquarters in Korea to ask for information, the Chinese
 usually informed me-politely but firmly-that they could not
 help me.
 "But I ap accredited to your Defense Ministry in Peiping," I said.
 "We have no connection with the Defense Ministry," they an-
 swered with a smile. "You are not accredited to us. We are the
 Chinese People's Volunteers."
 In a way, the Chinese in Korea were volunteers. They came from
 regular Chinese units, and they were led by Peng Teh-huai, a
 famous marshal in the Chinese Army. But before they left China for
 the crusade in Korea they were lined up and harangued for hours
 by their political officers. These officers, who are experts at mass
 brainwashing, warned them that the American imperialists were
 sneaking up on their hopes through Korea and would soon be
 destroying their homeland if they were not repulsed. Those soldiers
 who felt patriotic enough to go out and defend their country, the
 officers said, could take one step forward. Those who did not feel
 quite so loyal to their loved ones could stand still. Thus, there was
 a choice. Then, as all the troops stepped forward-I never heard
 of a man who did not-they were told to remove the patches on
 their uniforms which read "Chinese People's Army" an(1 sew on new
 patches which read "Chinese People's Volunteers." It was as simple
 as that. One of the volunteers who switched patches was the eldest
 son of Mao Chi-si himself, a brave young infantry officer who was
 later killed fighting against American troops near Seoul.

 "Mao Chi-si," she chirped, "says we must not punish the children."
 Since we were guests in the amah's country-and knew that she
 would report us to the authorities if we stepped out of line-+ve let
 our son off easy. I can imagine why Mao Chi-si may have a hold
 over the youngsters.
 When I left Warsaw I was un(ler strict orders to be extremely
 careful in nuy dealings with the Chinese. It was no secret in the
 Communist camp that they were the most sensitive and (lilficult of
 all the partners to get along with. Even the Russians-who some-
 times whispered to the in Peiping that they were convinced the
 Chinese wcie "nuts"-walked on eggs when they dealt with them.
 The Chinese are very demanding of the Russians, and when they
 sent a huge army mu) North Korea to help bail the Russians and
 the North Koreans out of a losing war, they Ina(le it clear that
 they were particilrtti ng in the battle on their own terms and fighting
 it in their own way. I was especially warned before I left Warsaw
 never to let. the Chinese think for a moment that I was spying on
 them. I was to assure them that I was only interested in what they
 knew about the U.S.
 In Peiping the Chinese and I got along line. The Chinese Com-
 munists have an excellent system of espionage which is particularly
 active in places like Tokyo, Manila and Taipeh where American
 military men are plentiful. i was soon learning a good deal about
 American military activities front Chinese sources and passing the
 information along to Warsaw.
 The most sensible way for me to report on American fighting
 capabilities, however, was to go to Korea and find out for myself.
 In July,  I(f52, I hoarded a Chinese train at 1N'iukden in Manchuria
 for the ride to the Yalu. An incident on the train gave me a new
 insight into how (leeply involved the Russians were in the war.
 My fellow travelers on the train included a group of two hundred
 men who got on at the last minute, dressed in the green summer
 uniforms of the Chinese People's Volunteers. But they were not
 Chinese: they were Russians. And they were not simply Soviet
 military advisers, who were also present in Korea in large numbers.
 They were combat troops-antiaircraft gunners, combat engineers
 and pilots-an(1 they were going to Korea to fight. I)espit.e the
 camouflage of their uniforms, which they had been issued at
 1\4ukden to make it more difficult for American pilots to recognize
 them from the air when they got to Korea, the Russians made no
 bones about their role in the war. One of their favorite jokes on the
 train went like this:
 FIRST RnssiAN. \Vc have the best pilots in the world.
