 Perspective             OPEC: No Solutions in Sight
 OPEC ministers meet on Monday for the second time in less than three weeks
 amid an atmosphere bordering on despair. As the ministers gather this
 weekend in Geneva, the near term offers few promising options. Weak oil
 demand, rising competition from non-OPEC producers, and internal disarray
 continue to challenge OPEC's ability to avert a major price break. OPEC's
 falling oil revenues have placed financial pressures on its members and forced
 them to compete against each other for oil sales.
 At the early July meeting, financially strapped Nigeria, Iraq, and Ecuador
 bitterly opposed a stopgap plan to reduce every member's production quota by
 7 percent. Algeria, Iran, and Libya,,who have joined other members in
 underselling official OPEC prices through barter deals and discounting,
 argued against any adjustment in the official price structure. Such hypocrisy
 contributed to an atmosphere of distrust among members, who were quick to
 blame each other for the organization's predicament.
 A sword hanging over Monday's meeting is the Saudi threat to cease acting as
 the organization's swing producer. At the last session, Petroleum Minister
 Yamani bluntly warned that Saudi output would be boosted unilaterally if the
 members continue to violate established price and production guidelines.
 Poorer and more populous OPEC nations have little sympathy for the Saudi's
 economic plight, but they realize that a decision by Riyadh to follow through
 on its threats would trigger a price war.
 Pressure for a downward price adjustment has mounted in the two weeks since
 the ministers last met. Mexico lowered its oil prices for the second time in less
 than a month, US and Canadian producers have cut light oil prices, and press
 reports indicate that Egypt will do the same. According to US Embassy
 reporting, Venezuela-with exports down sharply-is waiting until after the
 meeting to announce a badly needed price cut
 OPEC members realize that even concerted action in Geneva will not alter the
 gloomy demand outlook for its oil over the next two years:
 ? Oil consumption will remain steady, while non-OPEC production is expected
 to rise by nearly 1 million barrels per day (b/d) this year and about 500,000
 b/d in 1986.
 ? Substitution of other fuels for oil is occurring at a rapid pace, and
 conservation efforts continue to improve energy efficiency.
 As a result, demand for OPEC oil probably will be only 16-17 million b/d
 through 1986, roughly one-half the 1979 level.

 Indeed, some members are seriously questioning the value of remaining in
 OPEC, if it means only additional production restraint and declining revenues.
 Production discipline is no longer viewed as a short-term sacrifice guarantee-
 ing a brighter future, but as a long-term headache with no relief in sight.
 While OPEC's most effective course of action would be to cut production
 further, an allocation scheme acceptable to all members does not appear
 negotiable at this time. The other alternative, price cuts, would be slow to spur
 demand and would only increase pressure on revenue-starved members to
 violate production quotas. Bolder initiatives-such as a central marketing
 organization for OPEC crudes-may be necessary to break the deadlock but
 have little support going into the meeting.
 In any case, OPEC lacks the innovative leadership and resolve needed to deal
 with its problems. In the unlikely event that members pull together in Geneva,
 they will still have little cause to celebrate. Yet, if OPEC fails to act, July 1985
 may well mark a de facto dissolution of the cartel as members attempt to solve
 their problems individually.

 Saudi Arabia: Threats To Boost
 Oil Output Unilaterally
 Shrinking government revenues have forced Saudi
 officials to consider boosting crude oil production
 unilaterally if other OPEC countries fail to adhere
 to production quotas and official prices. They be-
 lieve they are bearing an unfair burden as swing
 producer, particularly now that spending cutbacks
 are beginning to affect domestic programs. Petro-
 leum Minister Yamani has publicly threatened to
 boost Saudi oil production if other OPEC countries
 continue to "cheat." The Saudis hope their threats
 to increase production will prod other members to
 agree to a new quota and pricing scheme, but they
 are prepared to act on their own if no new agree-
 ment is reached and observed.
 Riyadh's goal of a $55 billion balanced budget was
 unrealistic from the outset. Despite projected
 spending cuts of about 14 percent, declining oil
 revenues are pushing the red ink to levels that
 Saudi officials find unacceptable. Saudi output fell
 to an estimated 2.1 million b/d in June, far below
 the 3.8 million b/d on which Riyadh's current
 budget is based. We believe Riyadh wants to avoid
 having to finance a budget deficit much larger than
 $10 billion because it has already drawn down its
 liquid international assets from $135 billion to $90
 billion in less than three years. If crude production
 averages 2 million b/d for the fiscal year, at
 current prices and spending levels, Riyadh would
 face at least a $20 billion deficit.
 If the Saudis tried to pare spending by an addition-
 al $10 billion, outlays would be nearly 40 percent
 below last year's level-an almost impossible feat
 for both political and bureaucratic reasons. For the
 first time since oil revenues began to decline,
 budget cuts are being targeted toward Saudi citi-
 zens. Allowances, benefits, bonuses, and other pay-
 ments received by civilian employees of the Saudi
 Government already have been severely curtailed,
 amid loud complaints. Saudi officials are chary of
 cutting broader consumer subsidies after seeing the
 political disturbances that followed similar cuts in
 Morocco, Tunisia, and Sudan.
 The Saudis are calculating that the prospect of the
 market disruption and downward price spiral that a
 unilateral production increase would cause will
 induce other OPEC members to maintain better
 discipline. The opening gambit came during a
 meeting of OPEC's Ministerial Executive Commit-
 tee in early June, in which Yamani read a letter
 from King Fahd stating that, if any OPEC member
 cheats, they all have the right to do so. According
 to the US Embassy, Yamani said that Saudi
 Arabia could easily expand production to 4.35
 million b/d-its implied quota under the current
 OPEC agreement.                       Ya- 25X1
 mani subsequently threatened a 9-million-b/d lev-
 elF1                                                                                          25X1
 A tentative agreement at the OPEC Ministers'
 meeting early this month to reduce quotas tempo-
 rarily by 7 percent fell through at the last minute,
 The Saudis insisted
 on a proportionate reduction for each member,
 which would allow the kingdom to produce 4
 million b/d. Nigeria, Iraq, the UAE, and Ecuador,
 however, demanded that their quotas be increased.
 There are risks for the Saudis if they unilaterally
 boost their production. If quotas are abandoned
 and a price war ensues, some industry experts

 indicate prices might initially fall to $12 to $15 per
 barrel. Lower prices probably would not be trans-
 lated into significantly higher demand-particular-
 ly in the short run-meaning little budgetary relief
 for Riyadh. For example, at a price of $15 per
 barrel and Saudi output of 3 million b/d, Riyadh
 would still face a $20 billion deficit in the absence
 of any additional spending cuts. At that price, the
 Saudis would have to boost output to 5.7 million
 b/d to hold the deficit to $10 billion without
 cutting spending. Only a smaller price drop or
 better demand response would permit the Saudis to
 stay within their deficit target
 The Saudis have delayed taking any unilateral
 action until after Monday's OPEC meeting. If an
 agreement on quotas is worked out then, the Saudis
 would probably wait a few months to see how well
 it is observed. If no agreement is reached or if an
 agreement is promptly violated, the odds are better
 than even that the Saudis would boost output
 unilaterally.

 Latin America:
 Limited Prospects for a
 Debtors' Cartel
 Latin American debtors probably will soon begin to
 develop new pressure tactics to try to ease their
 repayment burdens and draw Washington directly
 into efforts to solve the region's debt difficulties. In
 our view, however, there is little near-term poten-
 tial for these countries to organize a debtors' cartel
 or formally mobilize collective action to force con-
 cessions from creditors. Our judgments are based
 on the results of a
 simulation exercise.' Factors that could raise the
 odds on collective action include a dramatic deteri-
 oration of external economic conditions, an upsurge
 in domestic political instability, or perceived intran-
 sigence on the part of creditors. The decisive roles,
 in our view, will continue to be played by the
 leaders of the major debtor states, especially the
 presidents of Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina.
 Sentiment among Latin American countries for
 collective action to obtain debt relief-including
 forming a debtors' cartel-first surfaced in 1982.
 The cartel threat waned late last year after the
 major countries dramatically improved their trade
 performance, rescheduled their debts, obtained new
 lending, and saw interest rates fall.
 US bank-
 ers still remain apprehensive about the Latin
 American debtors collectively repudiating their
 debt. We believe that some governments, such as
 Bolivia and Cuba, may fuel this concern by advo-
 cating a cartel.
 ' Threats of a debtors' cartel have resurfaced, but we lack extensive
 reporting on the willingness of key debtors to support collective
 action. To assess the potential threat, we simulated a meeting of the
 Cartagena group (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
 Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Vene-
 zuela), a consultative mechanism on debt organized in 1984. The
 participants filled information gaps with their own analysis of the
 political and economic factors that would prove decisive in new
 deliberations. Through a role-playing exercise, we considered form-
 ing a debtors' cartel and then discussed other types of collective
 action to force repayment concessions from creditors. In this article,
 the judgments attributed to individual governments represent those
 The forum was a closed-door deliberation of a
 Cartagena group ministerial meeting, the typical
 setting in the past. Experienced analysts played
 finance ministers from Brazil, Mexico, Argentina,
 Chile, and Bolivia and foreign ministers from
 Brazil and Uruguay. We believe this incorporated
 moderate and radical viewpoints, involved the key
 decisionmakers as well as maverick elements, and
 struck a balance between financial concerns and
 political considerations.
 We believe the country analysts were good proxies
 for the Western-educated elites that conduct nego-
 tiations. Reliable reporting indicates that the debt-
 ors test their perceptions about banker response to
 their proposals. Consequently, we built in an auto-
 matic feedback mechanism by including a repre-
 sentative of a US moneycenter bank.
 In the exercise, the participants were instructed to
 defend their self-interests. The debtors viewed this
 mandate in terms of reducing the repayment bur-
 den while the creditors sought to protect interest
 payments. Unlike a brainstorming session, the
 simulation forced the group to interact dynamical-
 ly. We believe we were able to consider a broad
 range of variables in making policy recommenda-
 tions and gauge the extent to which rhetoric influ-
 enced the interaction among the participants.
 Simulation Results:
 A Debtors' Cartel
 Our simulation persuaded us, however, that there is
 only a slight possibility that such a group could
 coalesce:

 smaller, more radical debtors fragmented efforts
 to organize a cartel. Although La Paz and Lima
 argued there was little to lose, Buenos Aires
 maintained that confronting creditors would un-
 dermine efforts to obtain multiyear debt resched-
 uling and new loans. As the simulation pro-
 gressed, we saw a consensus that the economic
 costs of radical action would be too high. The
 largest and most influential debtors remain con-
 cerned about protecting access to new credit. A
 cartel, the group decided, might provoke retalia-
 tion from industrial governments, resulting in the
 potential loss of foreign aid and export markets.
 ? Mexico, Brazil, and Ecuador played key moder-
 ating roles in our simulation. Mexico City-

 relations with banks and to head off OECD
 protectionism. Quito, a strong advocate of
 market-oriented policies, philosophically rejected
 outright confrontation with creditors.
 Simulation Results:
 Collective Action for New Repayment Schemes
 According to the US Embassy in Buenos Aires, the
 foreign ministers of Argentina, Brazil, and Uru-
 guay recently discussed an Argentine proposal for
 Latin American debtors collectively to reschedule
 debt payments to commercial banks.
 this would be achieved by capping
 interest rates to provide fixed, lower repayments to
 banks with the IMF and World Bank issuing bonds
 to creditors to cover the difference. In our
 simulation:
 ? The Latin American nations found the idea of a
 fixed, predictable repayment schedule attractive
 and considered raising the issue in future discus-
 sions with creditors. Most were concerned, how-
 ever, that collectively forcing the scheme would
 alienate creditors, causing the immediate loss of
 trade credit lines and new lending, as well as
 derailing the possibility of future concessions.
 The debtor representatives also were sobered by
 the technical difficulties of formulating a specific
 plan. No major debtor country currently felt that
 foreign exchange strains were intense enough to
 justify a unilateral reduction in interest
 payments.
 ? Mexico, Brazil, and Chile each played a key role
 in our deliberations, but their positions were
 conditional on other factors. Although Mexico
 prefers to maintain its good reputation with credi-
 tors, it indicated that a drop in oil prices com-
 bined with domestic political pressures could push
 it to threaten a capping scheme. Similarly, Brazil
 and Chile indicated they would reconsider their
 opposition to the proposal if exports and reserves
 drop markedly.
 Over the past several weeks, Fidel Castro has
 attempted to ally himself with the Latin debtors by
 publicly speaking out on their financial plight. In
 numerous speeches, he has argued that creditors
 should cancel their debt; otherwise, Latin countries
 should simply refuse to pay. Castro's arguments
 were given short shrift in our simulation. Some
 debtors were piqued by his attempt to grab the
 limelight, while others pointed to his hypocrisy in
 espousing radical action while privately working
 out new debt arrangements for Cuba. Except for
 Bolivia, the group believed his proposal would
 jeopardize their good relationships with creditors
 and industrial country governments.
 Simulation Results:
 Intensified Joint Pressure for Concessions
 The option of cooperative pressure on creditors for
 concessions arose spontaneously in the course of our
 group discussions. It was the only proposal that all
 debtors would accept, because it highlighted finan-
 cial problems without jeopardizing the current good
 relations with foreign creditors. This option
 emerged, we believe, because Latin governments-
 under domestic political pressure to restore eco-
 nomic growth-feel compelled to find some course
 that will gain further debt servicing concessions:

 ? In the simulation, the debtors agreed to use both
 the press and direct lobbying-in particular with
 the US Congress and Washington bureaucra-
 cies-to publicize the need for easing Latin
 America's debt burden. They also opted to con-
 tinue the Cartagena group as a loose confedera-
 tion to provide mutual support and to share
 information on successful approaches.
 ? Throughout the discussion, Brazil and Mexico
 focused attention on the need to reduce trade
 barriers and lower interest rates. Conversely,
 Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru advocated high-
 lighting the danger of political instability and
 resulting economic chaos to nudge creditors to-
 ward providing new concessions.
 The Imponderables
 Although we are confident of our analysis, over the
 longer run dramatic changes in the economic and
 political equation could substantially heighten the
 prospects for a cartel or collective rescheduling. We
 believe this scenario could occur as a result of any
 of a number of developments:
 ? Deteriorating external conditions could severely
 diminish debt service capabilities. Slowed global
 economic growth, the spread of protectionism,
 and the collapse of commodity prices-notably
 oil-would reduce exports, or rapidly rising inter-
 est rates would swell the burden of interest
 payments.
 ? Foreign banks and the IMF could require more
 stringent austerity in return for new money or
 debt relief. In the view of debtor governments,
 such policies would likely lead to political
 instability.
 ? Domestic political reverses in one or more coun-
 tries could encourage Latin civilian governments
 to take firmer stands with foreign creditors.
 ? A leader of a large Latin debtor-Alfonsin of
 Argentina seems the most likely candidate-
 driven by a personal sense of destiny and ambi-
 tion, may tout revolutionary changes. Other
 countries could become more receptive to radical
 action if a well-respected, major debtor led the
 way.
 ? Collusion by two or more Latin countries on the
 debt issue could breed wider acceptance of collec-
 tive action throughout the region.
 Implications for the United States
 The simulation exercise complemented recent re-
 porting that indicates that the views of the Latin
 debtors are evolving in a more political direction.
 We expect the Latin Americans to mount increas-
 ingly frequent and intense joint lobbying efforts to
 obtain concessions from commercial banks and
 industrial country governments. Latin leaders, in
 our exercise, seemed convinced that resolution of
 their financial problems hinged largely on US
 Government policies and actions.

 Key LDC Debtor:
 Lackluster Investment
 Portends Problems '
 The high investment growth that powered the
 economies of the key LDC debtors during the past
 two decades may be a thing of the past. After an
 unprecedented four-year plunge, investment in
 these countries is only now beginning to recover.
 Even if this recovery is sustained, we believe invest-
 ment growth through 1989 will be slower than in
 the past. The fallout from this dramatic shift in
 investment behavior will multiply the economic and
 political problems these countries will face during
 the next decade. In particular, slow investment
 growth will limit their economic recovery, further
 aggravating existing political and economic ten-
 sions. Sluggish investment growth may also place
 additional strain on the international financial sys-
 tem by jeopardizing compliance with IMF-support-
 ed programs and eroding trade competitiveness.
 Investment Slump
 We believe three key factors underlie the recent
 investment slump:
 ? Financing difficulties probably were the major
 drag on investment. The pool of funds available
 for investment fell by 15 percent during the last
 two years. Lower domestic savings and reduced
 access to foreign borrowing stifled investment by
 either pushing up financing costs or, where inter-
 est rate controls exist, causing a shortage of
 funds.
 ? Economic recession produced an unprecedented
 slump in aggregate demand that led to an invest-
 ment decline when the expected returns from
 investment projects plummeted and internally
 generated investment funds dried up.
 ? Heightened economic and political uncertainty
 also contributed to poor investment performance.
 Investors found it impossible to gauge the future
 returns from projects, and massive capital flight
 In general, investment growth in the key LDC
 debtors was impressive before the international
 financial crisis shattered the two-decade-old trend.
 Over the past four years, investment in these
 countries declined by nearly $55 billion-a 30-
 percent drop. Investment last year was well below
 1980 levels in each country. (See foldout on page
 13.) fn Argentina, investment plunged by nearly 55
 percent during the past four years. The investment
 slump was severe, but less dramatic, in Chile,
 Brazil, Peru, and Mexico. At the end of last year,
 their investment stood 25 to 35 percent below 1980
 levels. Nigeria, the Philippines, and Venezuela
 fared somewhat better, registering investment de-
 clines of only 10 percent. F_~
 ' This article summarizes an upcoming research paper. Key LDC
 debtors include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru,
 the Philippines, and Venezuela. Investment refers to gross fixed
 investment-investment in structures, machinery, and equipment.
 All dollar values and growth rates are based on constant 1980 US
 restricted the supply of investment funds.
 Limited Investment Recovery
 Our analysis indicates that investment in the key
 LDC debtors will rebound during 1985-89, but it is
 unlikely that investment growth will be high
 enough to restore investment to its level before the
 international financial crisis. We expect investment
 to grow at an average annual rate of 3 to 5 percent
 during the rest of this decade, a dramatic improve-
 ment over the average decline of 8.2 percent regis-
 tered during the past four years, but well below the
 7.3 percent average growth of the 1971-80 period.
 Even if these countries sustain investment growth
 of 5 percent through 1989, only two-thirds of the
 1981-84 investment decline will be reversed.

 In our judgment, a modest economic recovery in
 the key LDC debtors during 1985-89 will lead to an
 investment rebound. Rising aggregate demand
 should stimulate investment by increasing the ex-
 pected returns from investment projects. We fore-
 see minimal improvement, however, in the other
 key factors affecting the pace of investment. Slug-
 gish domestic savings and limited access to foreign
 borrowing suggest that the high cost/limited avail-
 ability of investment funds will continue to put a
 damper on capital formation. A significant im-
 provement in the underlying level of political-
 economic stability in these countries also appears
 unlikely.
 Individual Country Outlooks
 Our analysis indicates that investment growth in
 the key LDC debtors will vary widely across coun-
 tries during 1985-89. We believe Mexico will lead
 with investment growth averaging 4 to 6 percent.'
 Although problems exist, Mexico's demand pros-
 pects and political-economic stability are ranked
 higher than those of the other countries. After a
 period of harsh austerity, demand is projected by
 the major economic consulting firms to grow at an
 average annual rate approaching 5 percent. Al-
 though opposition parties are gaining strength, the
 long tenure of the government party should lead to
 relative political-economic stability. Regarding the
 availability of investment funds, only Venezuela is
 ranked higher. Mexico's banking system is relative-
 ly mature and efficient, but inflation, devaluation
 fears, and capital flight will continue to dampen
 domestic savings and limit the supply of investment
 funds.
 In Venezuela and Brazil, annual investment growth
 is likely to average 3 to 5 percent through 1989.
 With demand projected to grow at an annual rate
 of about 4 percent, the demand prospects of these
 countries are relatively good. Venezuela's tradition-
 ally high savings rate, low inflation, and relatively
 stable currency earned Caracas the highest ranking
 for availability of investment funds. Investment
 funds may be more scarce in Brazil because of
 triple-digit inflation and high devaluation risk.
 Given Venezuela's two decades of democracy and
 the broad popular and military support for the
 constitutional process in Brazil, the future political-
 economic environment of these two countries
 should be relatively stable.
 In Peru, Chile, and the Philippines, we believe
 investment will grow 2 to 4 percent a year thfough
 1989. Demand prospects are considered fair-GDP
 ' Projections were developed by ranking each country according to
 the key factors that will determine investment growth during the
 1985-89 period-aggregate demand prospects, cost/availability of
 investment funds, and the stability of the political economic system.
 By examining these rankings, investment growth projections were
 assessed and a range of average annual investment growth was set
 for each country. Our projections were then compared to, and in
 some cases revised in light of, the investment growth forecasts of
 outside experts. Given the volatility of investment spending, our
 projections should be viewed as benchmarks that indicate the
 underlying trend in investment growth. As has historically been the
 case, annual investment growth may fluctuate dramatically around

 is expected to grow, on average, about 3 percent per
 year. Historically low savings in Chile and inflation
 and devaluation concerns in Peru and the Philip-
 pines should limit the supply of investment funds.
 Instability in all three countries should stifle invest-
 ment growth. In Peru, the nationalistic, left-leaning
 philosophies of President-elect Garcia, the Sendero
 Luminoso insurgency, and a history of shifting
 economic policies raise serious concerns about
 political-economic stability. In the Philippines, a
 country with a more stable economic system, the
 Aquino assassination, the presidential succession
 question, and a growing insurgency have boosted
 investor uncertainty. We believe rising opposition
 to the repressive rule of President Pinochet will
 keep the level of political-economic uncertainty
 high in Chile.
 Investment growth in Argentina and Nigeria
 should be slower than in the other countries, aver-
 aging only 1 to 3 percent through 1989. Demand in
 these countries probably will be sluggish, expand-
 ing at about 2 percent per year, on average.
 Historically, low savings have restricted the supply
 of investment funds in these countries. This trend
 should continue as inflation and devaluation risk
 discourage domestic saving and spur further capital
 flight. Although Argentina has recently taken bold
 steps to reduce runaway inflation, the country's
 economic system may remain unstable. Political
 stability, however, may improve marginally under
 President Alfonsin. If the economy limps along,
 Alfonsin may be the first democratically elected
 president since 1952 to complete his term. Nigeria,
 on the other hand, with a more stable economic
 system has dismal political prospects. Lagos is
 plagued by divisions in the ruling military, student
 dissatisfaction, and regional tension.
 Even if investment grows at the highest projected
 rates through 1989, only three key LDC debtors
 will regain the ground lost since the international
 financial crisis. Venezuela, the Philippines, and
 Nigeria could have investment in 1989 that is 2 to
 15 percent higher than before the crisis. Their full
 recovery will be the result of less severe investment
 downturns rather than to particularly rapid invest-
 ment growth during 1985-89. In contrast, we pro-
 ject investment in Argentina will still be roughly 50
 percent lower in 1989 than in 1980. Peru and Chile
 may regain more lost ground than Argentina, but
 their investment should still fall about 30 percent
 short of precrisis peaks. Mexico and Brazil should
 regain all but about 10 to 15 percent of the ground
 lost following international financial problems.
 Implications
 Recent and projected investment performance in
 the key LDC debtors foreshadow a number of
 problems. Because investment is required to expand
 productive capacity, slow investment growth will
 limit their rate of economic growth over the longer
 term. On the heels of the drop in living standards
 registered recently, any further declines would
 aggravate existing social tensions. Slow investment
 growth may also impede structural adjustment.
 Economic restructuring may require investment
 growth well above our projections. Slower structur-
 al adjustment could jeopardize compliance with

 IMF-supported programs and cause international
 financial problems and economic inefficiency to
 linger over the longer term. Slow investment
 growth may also limit the flow of new technologies
 to these countries thereby slowing economic growth
 and hurting trade competitiveness.
 If these problems develop, US relations with the
 key LDC debtors could become more contentious:
 ? There could be increased pressure on Washington
 to take these countries' needs into account during
 the formulation of US monetary, fiscal, and trade
 policies.
 ? These countries could press the United States for
 increased development assistance. In a cash flow
 bind, the United States may be forced into the
 role of "lender of last resort."
 ? If debtor-creditor conflicts arise, the United
 States may be caught in the middle; both debtors
 and creditors would pressure Washington to sup-
 port their positions.

 The Sino-Soviet Trade and
 Cooperation Agreements:
 A Step Forward
 China and the USSR signed a $14 billion five-year
 trade agreement and a separate economic coopera-
 tion agreement-the first such agreement in 20
 years-on 10 July as part of Vice Premier Yao
 Yilin's four-day visit to Moscow. Although some-
 what of a breakthrough in economic relations,
 bilateral trade by 1990 will still only represent less
 than 5 percent of each country's total trade. The
 cooperation agreement could prove more signifi-
 cant in that it will result in direct Soviet participa-
 tion in Chinese industrial projects. Together, the
 two pacts provide a framework for continued dia-
 logue and improvement in overall political and
 economic relations.
 Terms Negotiated Until Last Minute
 The trade accord reportedly calls for rising levels of
 bilateral trade, reaching $3.5 billion in 1990, for a
 total of $14 billion over the five-year period. By
 comparison, trade conducted during 1981-85 is
 expected to total only $4 billion, with this year's
 figure projected at $1.6 billion. Unlike the trade
 accord, no value was given for the cooperation
 agreement, although                   in May
 that USSR participation in Chinese industrial pro-
 jects could reach up to $1 billion per year by 1988.
 the long-term
 trade agreement sets out a general framework
 within which annual protocols can be negotiated.
 Two types of barter exchange have reportedly been
 established. The first-as is the case for trade
 now-requires the yearly settlement of accounts.
 The second allows the Chinese to pay for imports of
 capital goods and technical assistance over a multi-
 year period.
 The economic cooperation agreement reportedly
 involves the Soviet supply of machinery, capital
 equipment, and technical assistance to support
 China's Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90).
 the USSR wi
 participate in seven new Chinese development pro-
 jects-including two thermal power plants, two
 coal mines, and a 1,000 kilometer rail line-as well
 as the renovation of 17 existing plants. Several
 smaller projects have also been targeted for Soviet
 participation. This marks the first time in over 20
 years that the Chinese have asked the Soviets for
 assistance and technology in the construction of
 new plants. During the height of the Sino-Soviet
 relationship in the late 1950s, Moscow was involved
 in over 200 projects in China.
 Soviet deliveries of manufactured goods, chemicals,
 raw materials, and transport equipment are also
 likely to rise as a result of the new agreement.
 Beijing will continue to need imports of such Soviet
 metals as nickel and steel alloys. At the same time,
 despite recurring problems with quality and tardy
 delivery, China will probably want to increase its
 imports of timber, industrial chemicals, and fertil-
 izers.

 25X1

 We expect Moscow will seek higher imports of
 meat, soybeans, grain-mostly corn-and other 25X1
 agricultural products. Similarly, to supplement its
 own production, Soviet imports of wool, cotton,
 apparel, and textiles are likely to rise. Finally if the
 Chinese can increase their domestic production, the
 Soviets also may try to boost their imports of such
 consumer electronics as televisions and radios.

 this expansion within a multiyear trade agree-
 ment-after a 20-year hiatus-reflects a slow pro-
 cess of improving relations since 1980:
 ? Regular political consultations at the deputy for-
 eign minister level.
 ? A sharp increase in bilateral trade and a resump-
 tion of scientific and technical exchanges.
 ? Low-level nonpolitical contacts at athletic meets,
 cultural events, and the like.
 Probably the most important of these moves was
 the resumption of Sino-Soviet political discussions
 in October 1982. Although the six rounds of "con-
 sultations" to date have done little to resolve major
 political and security issues, the dialogue has,
 nonetheless, helped reduce tensions. Moreover, by
 expanding various forms of cooperation, as well as
 increasing bilateral trade, Moscow and Beijing
 have helped repair some of the damage inflicted on
 their relationship during the 1960s and 1970s.
 Their success in improving relations, in turn, has
 demonstrated to other countries that Sino-Soviet
 ties are not frozen, even though the two sides
 remain deadlocked on the main issues dividing
 them.
 Besides helping both sides to show some balance in
 their ties to the United States, both countries have
 individual reasons for signing the new accords. The
 Soviets almost certainly look upon the new agree-
 ments with China-especially the project assis-
 tance-as a means of regaining some of the influ-
 ence that they had wielded in Beijing before
 relations deteriorated in the early 1960s. Indeed,
 a number of
 the USSR's top Sinologists believe that there are
 Chinese officials who are dissatisfied with the
 current leadership's policy of developing close ties
 to the West, particularly with the United States.
 According to these Soviet experts, many of the
 more "hopeful" Chinese cadres were educated in
 the USSR during the 1950s, and want a return to
 better relations with Moscow or at least a more
 balanced approach to the two superpowers. F_~
 The Soviets almost certainly have tailored such
 remarks to their Western audience. While the
 degree of Chinese support is probably not as wide-
 spread as the Soviets claim, some Chinese appar-
 ently do see increased trade and economic ex-
 changes-which are unlikely to evolve into
 economic dependencies-as a comparatively safe
 way to improve their relationship with the USSR
 without compromising on more fundamental politi-
 cal issues. Furthermore, the Soviets appear to be
 including Chinese who, as Marxist-Leninists, ad-
 mire the highly centralized Soviet planning system
 (and who have reservations about China's economic
 reforms), but who also have serious problems with
 many Soviet policies, especially toward China.
 Economic Benefits: The Soviet Perspective
 In addition to political reasons, both countries had
 strong economic incentives to sign the new agree-
 ment. Moscow is undoubtedly anxious to boost
 imports of agricultural products and consumer
 goods from China. Besides reducing shortages and
 saving on high transportation costs particularly for
 the Soviet Far East, these increased imports also
 would provide a boost to the Soviet Long Term
 Consumer Goods program that is scheduled to be
 unveiled as part of the upcoming 12th Five-Year
 Plan.
 Another positive aspect of increased trade from
 Moscow's vantage is that it will allow the USSR to
 acquire through barter goods that would otherwise
 require the expenditure of foreign exchange. At the
 same time, Moscow will be supplying goods, pri-
 marily equipment, which have only limited demand
 in the West. Any hard currency savings will be
 relatively small, however, in comparison with total
 hard currency expenditures. China can probably
 supply the USSR with 1-3 million metric tons of
 grain-primarily corn-and several hundred thou-
 sand tons of soybeans annually for at least the next
 few years saving Moscow $200-500 million a year.
 Hard currency expenditures for meat-which aver-
 aged $350 million in 1981-84-could be cut by
 additional purchases from China; in 1984, imports
 of meat from China totaled over $100 million.

 The Chinese Side of the Ledger
 Increased sales to the USSR will provide China
 with an outlet for its growing production of textile
 fibers, fabrics, and apparel. Both the United States
 and Western Europe have placed restrictions on
 imports of some Chinese products-including tex-
 tiles and consumer goods-forcing Beijing to
 search for alternative markets.
 The use of Soviet capital equipment, machinery,
 and technical assistance-in addition to raw mate-
 rials-will also prove beneficial to Beijing. The
 Chinese have apparently decided that, for some of
 those factories built originally with Soviet help, it is
 cheaper to modernize using Soviet equipment. Al-
 though this equipment may not be as technological-
 ly advanced as that available from the West, it will
 still improve industrial performance. The Chinese
 probably also believe that for a number of new
 projects-primarily energy-the Soviets can pro-
 vide technology that is as good as in the West and
 without the expenditure of hard currency.
 Given these incentives, we believe the annual trade
 turnover goal of $3.5 billion by 1990 is possible.
 Nonetheless, even this level by 1990 would still
 probably represent less than 5 percent of each
 country's total trade.
 Although trade levels under the agreement will be
 a function of bilateral political ties, transportation
 problems may be the principal long-term impedi-
 ment. Even now, rail transport is so tight on both
 sides that many products are shipped by sea. Port
 congestion in both China and the Soviet Union,
 however, has also slowed deliveries. China is build-
 ing new port capacity to alleviate seagoing freight
 delays, but planned improvements to the rail sys-
 tem in both countries are not likely to be sufficient
 to eliminate major problems.

 Br zil's Difficult
 ,Negotiations
 With the IMF
 Finance Minister Dornelles believes the differences between Brasilia and the
 IMF have narrowed sufficiently to permit an early standby agreement,
 according to US Embassy reporting, but we believe the negotiations that
 resumed on Monday could be long and difficult. To pave the way for an
 agreement, Brasilia announced measures in early July to reduce by 36 percent
 the projected $18 billion public-sector deficit for this year
 the announced cuts were substantially smaller
 than those sought by the IMF.                         Brasilia intends to
 request from creditor banks another three-month rollover through November
 of debt repayments, suggesting that the government anticipates drawn-out
 talks. Dornelles continues to have difficulty selling his austerity proposals
 within the Brazilian government. Not only has President Sarney become
 increasingly agitated by Fund demands,
 but the US Embassy reports that many of the politicians in the
 PMDB-the larger of the two parties in the governing coalition-would like
 nothing better than to force a break with the IMF.
 Mexico
 Bud t Overruns
 Rising balance-of-payments problems and large budget overruns are pushing
 Mexico out of compliance with IMF targets and may force the government to
 seek new foreign loans. Mexico's recent oil price cut averaging about $1 per
 barrel, combined with earlier price adjustments and lower export volume, will
 reduce 1985 petroleum export earnings by about $1.5 billion from the 1984
 level. Capital flight has doubled and international reserves have dropped by
 one-half to approximately $4 billion
 rIn
 discussion with the IMF, the Mexicans are likely to plead extenuating
 circumstances and ask for easier terms; bankers will consider loans only if the
 Fund declares Mexico is in compliance with the IMF program.The deteriorat-
 ing foreign payments situation will soon force Mexico City to adjust the
 exchange rate. This is not likely to prevent financial problems from getting
 worse, especially if oil prices continue to drop. President de la Madrid so far
 has been unwilling to cut spending enough to bring the deficit near the IMF
 targets. While a third round of budget cuts will be made soon, we doubt they
 will be sufficient

 complete payments on arrears from the 1981 agreement, and to make interest
 payments on the rescheduled debt. Poland is unlikely to cover more than half
 of the $900 million due to governments if it continues to give priority to
 imports and payments to bank creditors. The Poles probably will demand new
 trade credits in the bilateral negotiations, but Western governments are
 unlikely to commit more than minimum amounts, at best. If Poland fails to
 pay, the Paris Club may demand a new private rescheduling that provides for
 equal treatment of creditors~                                 25X1
 Morocco's efforts to secure $300 million in IMF loans collapsed last week. The
 government's failure to conclude its 1983-84 commerical debt rescheduling
 agreement with the London Club, large arrears on official debt to Paris Club
 members, and poor performance on meeting IMF guidelines this year
 prompted the Fund's decision to postpone new assistance until at least
 September. Recent promises of large-scale aid from Saudi Arabia and Libya
 may be a factor in Rabat's intransigence as well as the favorable terms      25X1

 IMF preclude any progress on urgently needed debt rescheduling for 1985 and

 parties who are critical of the government's financial management, bending to
 creditor demands, and willingness to put the burden of austerity on the poor.

 cent is likely by the end of the year to help control import growth. In addition,
 cuts in the 1985 budget of up to $100 million are being considered to trim bor-
 rowing needs. The US Embassy says the government has not yet approached
 the IMF for financial assistance or help with debt rescheduling, but a        25X1
 continued oil market slump makes such a move likely by the end of 1986. The
 current domestic political situation, however, probably will cause officials to
 focus on short-term financial juggling rather than on long-term debt planning
 and on the difficult choices in subsidies as well as economic liberalization-
 especially in agriculture.                                                                                                     25X1
 Somalia's failure to meet an IMF performance target criterion that calls for
 the elimination of external arrears is jeopardizing financial liberalization
 efforts and the adjustment program approved earlier this year. Insufficient
 foreign exchange income has prevented Mogadishu from retiring overdue
 obligations. Earnings have been reduced by Saudi Arabia's continued ban on
 imports of Somali cattle, a switch by aid donors from cash to commodity
 contributions, contractor claims, and diminishing oil grants. Somali officials,

 will total 30 percent less then the projected $110 million current account
 deficit through December. To cover the gap, Montevideo is approaching its
 foreign commercial banks-which recently agreed to roll over principal

 pressing Tokyo to seek a limit higher than 18 percent in the final agreement. 25X1
 The others are unhappy at the prospect of Honda increasing its Canadian

 Canada, Honda apparently plans to ship more Japanese-produced cars to the

 Despite complaints from domestic manufacturers about a surge in imports of
 South Korean Hyundai cars, Ottawa thus far is sticking to its scheduled
 January 1987 date for imposing a tariff on LDC autos. Hyundai, which is us-
 ing Canada as a test market before beginning exports to the United States, has
 seen its Canadian sales soar 270 percent in first half 1985, as compared with
 the year-earlier period. South Korea is now behind only Japan in the Canadian
 auto market with a nearly 6-percent market share. The Canadian Motor
 Vehicle Manufacturer's Association has suggested Ottawa is avoiding action
 because it does not want to jeopardize attempts to sell South Korea a nuclear
 reactor. Canadian Finance Department officials stress South Korea's willing- 25X1
 ness to purchase Canadian auto parts, and especially Hyundai's decision to
 build a parts plant in Canada, as factors behind Ottawa's decision to delay tar-

 Italy's five-party coalition government is reviewing its policies with debate
 expected to focus on economic problems, particularly the rapidly growing
 public-sector deficit. Last week, Rome raised its 1985 budget deficit forecast
 by $5 billion to $60 billion-16 percent of estimated GDP-largely because of
 higher unemployment compensation and use of the wage supplement fund. So
 far, Prime Minister Craxi has been unable to win coalition agreement on
 cutting the deficit, and discussions at the policy review are likely to be divisive.
 Treasury Minister Goria, a Christian Democrat, has called for new taxes to
 make up the expected revenue shortfall. On the other hand, Republican
 Finance Minister Visentini, supported by the Socialists and Social Democrats,
 insists that spending must be cut before new taxes can be considered. Craxi an-
 ticipates a compromise which may include some new indirect tax measures.

 instead it awards employees lump-sum payments less than their usual cost-of-

 sides were unable to agree on the debt's size or on whether to apply Cairo's
 trade surplus funds, now frozen in Moscow, to repayment. Moscow reportedly
 rejected out-of-hand Cairo's argument that the size of the debt ought to be re-
 duced by the amount Egypt spent on reproducing Soviet spare parts after the
 arms cutoff in the mid-1970s and by the rapid depreciation of the equipment.
 The Egyptians told the US Embassy that the dispute is delaying implementa-
 tion of the trade protocol agreed on in May. Major progress was probably not
 achievable; even so Cairo proved to be more uncompromising than expected. It
 is clearly unwilling to sacrifice on thorny economic issues for the sake of
 improving overall relations. When the talks resume, probably this autumn, the
 USSR's desire for closer ties may lead it to consider Cairo's proposal that the
 frozen trade surplus be used to modernize Soviet-built plants in Egypt. While
 Moscow may allow a small amount for this purpose, it probably will demand
 that most be used to liquidate the military debt.

 Deposits of chromite ore on the southwest coast of Greenland have been
 opened to development, according to Embassy reporting. Although extensive
 drilling and core sampling will be required to determine ore quality, a
 Canadian mining firm, Greenex, will soon receive a nonexclusive prospecting
 license for chromite and other minerals in the region. The Danish Government
 said it would welcome interest by US mining firms as well. If exploitable, these
 deposits could provide a new, more reliable source of supply for this strategic
 mineral. The United States presently depends on imports for about 80 percent
 of its chromite needs-with half coming from South Africa. Currently, South
 Africa and the USSR provide over 50 percent of world production, and
 southern Africa holds 99 percent of the world's known reserves.
 Taiwan's 9 July decision to remove the import visa requirement on 3,000
 products represents only a small concession in its highly publicized plan to
 liberalize its trade barriers. The move follows a February 1985 decision which
 freed some 5,000 textile and agricultural products from the same import
 license requirement. The impact of these moves will likely be minimal, given
 the extent to which remaining tariff and nontariff barriers continue to restrict
 imports. Taiwan's trade surplus for the first half of 1985 was about $5 billion.

 Limitations in their own industry are forcing the Soviets to purchase foreign

 unusual, however, and Moscow may be holding out the promise of a major pur-

 used with other Western companies.                               25X1

 have improved the commercial environment for US firms. This is the first

 Beijing had decided to cut from 14 to four the number of coastal cities
 opened last year under regulations favoring foreign investment. The decision
 probably was made at a conference held in late June of mayors of coastal cit-
 ies.                                                     financial
 controls will be reimposed on the 10 smaller cities. Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian,
 and Guangzhou will remain open cities. The decision to modify the policy,
 which has been closely identified with top leader Deng Xiaoping, probably was
 made under pressure from conservative leaders, who have increasingly criti-
 cized corruption, waste, and inefficiency in the open cities. The reduction-
 part of an overall retrenchment in the economy-probably represents Deng's
 decision to cut his losses as he prepares for a major party conference in
 September. Recent press articles praising the general policy of opening to the
 outside world and the fact that Beijing is pushing ahead with controversial
 wage reforms indicate that the reformers are determined to keep the basic
 program on track.

 Seventh Five-Year Plan, 1986-90. The loans, which will carry an interest rate
 of only 0.25 to 0.375 percentage point over the London Interbank Rate and a
 10-year repayment period, can be drawn on for the next five years. This line of
 credit replaces a $2 billion arrangement negotiated with Japanese commercial
 banks in 1979 that expired unused last month.
 The Chinese probably will continue to avoid using commercial credit
 L
 lines until all available concessional financing is exhausted. They are currently
 seeking several billion dollars in export credits from West Germany, the
 United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada, and Austria, in addition to those
 from Japan. The Chinese may buy as much as $50 billion worth of capital
 goods during the next five-year plan, of which perhaps $10 billion will be
 financed with long-term loans. Nevertheless, China will have no problems
 servicing its debt, which currently stands at only about $6 billion.F-1
 a Japanese economic delegation visiting
 Havana has agreed to establish a joint corporation to promote bilateral trade.
 The corporation, to be established in Japan by mid-1987, will encourage
 imports of Cuban rum, frozen fruit pulp, and coffee by allowing Japanese
 packaging and processing. This would further Cuban attempts to increase
 exports to Japan through diversification of products. Bilateral trade volume
 has stagnated over the last two years after recovering from a sharp drop in
 1982 and early 1983. Although Japanese exports to Cuba have risen, imports
 have declined because of decreased sugar purchases.
