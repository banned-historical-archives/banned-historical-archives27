 key Judgments          The United States' interests in its relationships with China and Taiwan
 would be best served if Beijing and Taipei could reach some form of
 accommodation or association that would permit the two parts of China to
 coexist peacefully. The worst outcome would be a military confrontation
 that forced the United States to choose whether to provide assistance to
 Taiwan or to allow it to be overwhelmed by superior Chinese force. Trends
 over the past four years have moved fitfully toward an eventual accommo-
 dation, and they probably will continue in this direction.
 Chinese officials seem well aware of the disadvantages of using military
 force against Taiwan, even though they insist on retaining the option as a
 form of pressure. They also know that China has little in the way of
 inducements to persuade the authorities and people of Taiwan of the
 advantages of unification. Hence, they seem resigned to a lengthy process
 of building connections between the mainland and Taiwan as a necessary
 prelude to negotiations.
 The Chinese will almost certainly continue to regard US arms sales to
 Taiwan as encouraging Taiwan's leaders to refuse to negotiate. The
 agreement reached on 17 August 1982 provides a respite from Chinese
 pressure to end arms sales, but the Chinese have served notice that they
 will not be satisfied until a final "resolution" of the arms sales issue is
 reached.
 Taiwan's leaders remain reasonably confident that China will not use force
 against the island during the next few years, but they are worried about the
 implications of the 17 August communique for Taiwan's defense in the
 longer term. They probably will remain adamantly opposed to negotiations,
 while continuing to liberalize contacts with China. The broad consensus
 among leaders and people on keeping Taiwan free of Chinese control is un-
 likely to weaken. Influential politicians, both mainlanders and Taiwanese,
 recognize the need to adhere to the one-China position to avoid provoking
 the Chinese into resorting to force and are unlikely to opt for an
 independent state of Taiwan in the absence of a drastic shift by Beijing to
 coercive policies.

 Over the next five years the interaction between China and Taiwan
 probably will not take the form of negotiations on their future relationship,
 but of patterns of behavior that send a shifting combination of warnings
 and reassuring signals to the other side, so that tacit understandings
 gradually develop in a number of areas, comparable to the long-established
 understandings on the range of naval and air patrols in the Taiwan Strait.
 US policies that provide concrete and growing benefits to China and satisfy
 its leaders that the United States is not conniving in the establishment of
 an independent Taiwan would further the accommodation process, provid-
 ed that the people of Taiwan are not caused to feel abandoned by the
 United States.

 China and Taiwan:
 Attitudes, Policies,
 and Options
 Summary                In designating the return of Taiwan to the motherland as one of three main
 goals for the 1980s, Chinese leaders underlined the importance they attach
 to this issue, but they probably do not expect it to be finally resolved during
 this decade. They are becoming increasingly aware of the opposition to
 unification among the people of Taiwan and the disadvantages of trying to
 resolve the problem by military force. Consequently, they seem resigned to
 a long process of building connections with the people on Taiwan and
 persuading and educating them, with the military option held in reserve.
 They assert and probably believe that US arms sales encourage Taiwan's
 leaders to refuse negotiations and have made it clear that they expect the
 17 August 1982 communique on this issue to lead to the phasing out of
 such sales.
 The main elements of Chinese policy toward Taiwan are: formal proposals
 by the National People's Congress and its Chairman, Ye Jianying; peaceful
 behavior in the Taiwan Strait area; a wide variety of united front
 operations aimed at influencing the people of Taiwan; encouragement of
 trade between Taiwan and the mainland; and continuing efforts to
 undermine Taiwan's status as a separate political entity. Beijing's principal
 difficulty is its lack of inducements to persuade the people of Taiwan that
 they would be better off united with China. Contradictions in China's
 policies also undermine their effectiveness. For the people of Taiwan,
 Beijing's refusal to renounce the use of force against the island and its pres-
 sure on the United States to end arms sales belie the ostensibly conciliatory
 nature of its unification proposals, particularly the promise that after
 unification Taiwan could retain its armed forces. Chinese leaders are
 uncertain whether to direct their principal efforts toward Chiang Ching-
 kuo and other mainlander leaders on Taiwan or to the Taiwanese, whose
 political influence will increase with the passage of time. Their attempts to
 appeal to both groups often produces confused, ineffective propaganda.
 Taiwan's leaders see Beijing's proposals not as a basis for true autonomy
 for Taiwan, but as a starting point for negotiations that would end with the
 imposition of the Communist system on the island. Consequently, they
 flatly reject negotiations and place their hope in an eventual change in that
 system in China. Hardliners in the Kuomintang (KMT) see change as
 possible only through the overthrow of the Chinese Communist system by

 the people. Other mainlanders on Taiwan foresee the possibility of a
 gradual evolution of the system in China toward a system more like that in
 Taiwan. A third group, which advocates a "multisystem state" concept for
 China, places its hope in perpetuating a state of peaceful coexistence
 between Taiwan and China.
 Most native Taiwanese would prefer an independent state of Taiwan run
 by them, and many express fear that the KMT may make a deal with
 Beijing behind their back. Relatively sophisticated Taiwanese politicians,
 however, do not favor a formal declaration of independence for Taiwan, as
 they realize it would not significantly improve Taiwan's international
 position and would increase the risk that Beijing would attack the island. A
 strong consensus thus exists among influential mainlanders and Taiwanese
 inside and outside the KMT opposing either negotiation with Beijing or a
 declaration of independence for Taiwan.
 The principal concern of Taiwan's leaders is how to maintain an effective
 military deterrent to the use of force by China. They do not anticipate the
 use of force against Taiwan during the next several years, but they are con-
 cerned about the longer term. The US commitment in the 17 August
 communique to reduce and eventually phase out arms sales to Taiwan has
 heightened this concern. They will try to make Taiwan more self-reliant in
 weapons production, but they see little choice but to continue to rely
 heavily on the United States for Taiwan's security.
 Taiwan bans direct trade, travel, and postal and shipping services between
 Taiwan and the mainland, fearing that these could be used by Beijing to
 promote its united front policies and infiltrate agents into Taiwan. The
 authorities in Taiwan have, however, tolerated growing indirect trade and
 correspondence between Taiwan and the mainland, sub rosa visits to
 mainland relatives by residents of Taiwan, and increasing numbers of
 contacts between people from Taiwan and China in third countries at
 universities, scientific conferences, and athletic meets. The authorities
 believe that an exchange of information concerning conditions in China
 and Taiwan will redound to Taiwan's advantage. Many differences exist
 between hardliners, who would ban all contacts between people from
 Taiwan and China, and those who favor varying degrees of liberality in al-
 lowing such contacts. The trend has been toward liberalization, and it
 probably will continue.
 Recent trends seem to point toward some form of eventual accommodation
 between Taiwan and China. A scenario can be envisaged in which Chinese

 leaders accept the necessity of a prolonged period of gradually expanding
 relations and Taiwan's leaders accept the need in the long run to reach an
 understanding with China. No negotiations occur, but visits to Beijing and
 Taipei by trusted third parties lead to better understanding on each side of
 the thinking of top leaders on the other. As the network of connections be-
 tween China and Taiwan gradually expands, the status quo more and more
 comes to be seen as an acceptable state of affairs. Both sides agree that
 China is one. Taiwan's leaders describe it as a multisystem state in which
 Taiwan is one of two autonomous units; Chinese leaders designate Taiwan
 as a special administrative district of China with a politicoeconomic system
 different from that of the rest of the country. Neither accepts the other's
 designation, but they are willing to live with the situation. The United
 States expands its relations with both China and Taiwan, and Chinese
 leaders are satisfied that the United States is not committed to establishing
 an independent Taiwan state.
 The actual trend over the next five years
 between China and Taiwan probably wi  not take the form o negotiations
 on the future relationship between Taiwan and the mainland, but of

 patterns of behavior that send a shifting combination of warnings and
 reassuring signals to the other side, so that tacit understandings gradually
 develop in a number of areas, comparable to the long established tacit
 understandings on the range of air and naval patrols in the Taiwan Strait.
 A trend of this sort toward accommodation would serve US interests well,
 while a confrontation would present the United States with extraordinarily
 difficult and controversial policy choices and a high risk of damage to
 important US interests, whichever choice was made. US policies that
 provide concrete and growing benefits to China and satisfy its leaders that
 the United States is not conniving at the establishment of an independent
 Taiwan would further a process of accommodation, provided that the
 people of Taiwan are not caused to feel abandoned by the United States.

 China and Taiwan:
 Attitudes, Policies,
 and Options
 Views of Chinese Leaders
 Chinese leaders have designated "the return of Tai-
 wan to the motherland" as one of the three main goals
 for the 1980s, along with modernization and opposi-
 tion to "hegcmonism." These leaders, survivors of the
 revolutionary generation, have devoted most of their
 lives to unifying China, ending foreign intervention in
 China, and trying to overcome the longtime rival of
 the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the Kuomin-
 tang (KMT). They have strong feelings on the Taiwan
 issue. Because this is a deeply felt nationalistic issue,
 moreover, it is easy to mobilize popular support
 against US "interference" with the unification of
 Taiwan and the mainland. It is the kind of issue that
 can be used by opponents of Deng Xiaoping to put
 pressure on him. Chinese officials have asserted pri-
 vately that the Taiwan issue is a domestic political
 problem for Deng, but these have been Deng support-
 ers who spoke in the context of urging further US
 concessions on the arms sales issue. Evidence is
 lacking as to who Deng's critics on the Taiwan
 question are and how strong their alleged pressure on
 him has been.
 No perceptible differences exist among Chinese lead-
 ers on the importance of the goal of retrieving Taiwan
 or in their determination to achieve it. There may be
 important differences, however, on timing and meth-
 ods. It should be noted that "goal," as used by the
 Chinese, is a spongy word. The "goals" for the 1980s
 are not necessarily things to be accomplished or
 completed during that decade; they are tasks on which
 Chinese efforts and energies are to be concentrated.
 Beijing hardly expects modernization to be completed
 during the 1980s any more than it expects the need
 for opposition to "hegemonism" to have been elimi-
 nated by 1990. Some Chinese leaders, at least, while
 hoping for progress in resolving the Taiwan issue
 during the 1980s, clearly do not expect it to be finally
 resolved during that period.
 Some middle-level officials in China are known to be
 critical of official policy toward Taiwan. For example,
 one such functionary expressed the thought that
 Taipei's adoption of the "arrogant" slogan "Reunify
 China With the Three People's Principles" ' resulted
 from the superiority of Taiwan's economic conditions
 over those on the mainland, not from Taiwan's diffi-
 culties in domestic and foreign affairs and the acces-
 sion of a pro-Taiwan administration in Washington.
 He added that everyone recognized that Taiwan had
 no reason to want reunification; Deng's view that the
 problem could be solved in the 1980s was extremely
 unrealistic, he said. In October 1981 middle-level
 foreign affairs officials were critical of Deng for
 having offered too much too soon to Taiwan without
 getting anything in return. A senior provincial official
 also asserted that there was considerable opposition to
 the lenient terms offered Taiwan by Deng. Only
 Deng's prestige has prevented this opposition from
 surfacing, he said, as there were important elements
 in China, especially in the armed forces, that favored
 liberation of Taiwan by force. Other differences exist
 concerning whether the thrust of China's unification
 efforts should be aimed at President Chiang Ching-
 kuo and the KMT or at the Taiwanese majority, as is
 discussed on pages 7 and 8.
 The Chinese maintain that a settlement between
 Beijing and Taipei and the question of US "interfer-
 ence" in the form of arms supply to Taiwan are two
 separate issues. They do, however, link them by
 asserting that the continued sale of arms to Taiwan
 encourages its leaders to reject negotiations. Thus,
 they imply that eventual phasing out of arms sales by
 the United States may be a prerequisite for getting
 negotiations started.
 ' The "Three People's Principles," formulated by Sun Yat-sen,
 founder of the KMT, are nationalism, democracy, and the people's
 livelihood.

 As to how long it might take to reach a settlement
 with Taipei, Chinese leaders have expressed various
 views. Some have taken a rather relaxed attitude. For
 example, Deng Xiaoping was quoted as having said
 publicly in Tokyo in October 1978 that if the Taiwan
 issue "cannot be resolved in IO years or 100 years,
 then in 1,000 years." Politburo member Fang Yi in
 January 1979 said, "100 years is not too long, nor is
 one year too short." Taiwan must be given time to
 adjust, said Fang, adding that not much movement
 could realistically be expected while Chiang Ching-
 kuo was President. Wang Bingnan, President of the
 Chinese People's Association for Friendship With
 Foreign Countries, speaking on television just after
 the announcement in December 1978, of the normal-
 ization of relations between Beijing and Washington,
 cited Mao as having said that it might take 10, 20, or
 even 100 years to resolve the Taiwan question, al-
 though an earlier solution would be better than a later
 one. Liao Chengzhi, the person primarily responsible
 for carrying out policy toward Taiwan and probably
 the senior official best informed about attitudes on the
 island, stated                     that arriving at a
 settlement with Taiwan is likely to be a very slow
 Statements on how long it may take to resolve the
 Taiwan problem should not be taken literally, for
 policy on this issue can change quickly with circum-
 stances. A relaxed view of how long reunification may
 take is consistent with Beijing's present conciliatory
 policy toward Taiwan, but, if it should decide to shift
 to a coercive policy, leaders would promptly change
 their tune.
 As to how long Taiwan might be permitted to retain
 its separate political and economic systems after
 agreement on unification, several senior Chinese offi-
 cials have stated privately that these systems could be
 allowed to continue "for a certain time," clearly
 implying that Taiwan would ultimately be incorporat-
 ed fully into the Communist system.

 wan with the mainland was conveyed in a "Message
 to Taiwan Compatriots" from the Standing Commit-
 tee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on I
 January 1979, coincident with the normalization of
 diplomatic relations between China and the United
 States. The message was conciliatory, assuring the
 people of Taiwan that unification would not adversely
 affect their way of life and calling for negotiations
 without preconditions. The message also proposed the
 immediate establishment of postal, telecommunica-
 tions, and transportation links between Taiwan and
 the mainland, the opening of direct trade, and a
 variety of cultural and other exchanges. Deng Xiao-
 ping referred to this statement as constituting "the
 major policy, basic position, and attitude toward the
 return of Taiwan."
 On 30 September 1981, NPC Chairman Ye Jianying,
 spelled out the Chinese position in greater detail. In a
 nine-point statement, he offered Taiwan "a high
 degree of autonomy as a special administrative re-
 gion." He gave assurances that Taiwan's socioeco-
 nomic system would remain unchanged, as would its
 way of life and its cultural and economic relations
 with foreign countries. He said that the central
 government would not interfere with local affairs or
 encroach on proprietary rights, on the right of inheri-
 tance of private property, houses, land and enter-
 prises, or on foreign investments. Taiwan could retain
 its own armed forces, and persons on Taiwan would be
 offered senior positions on the mainland.
 The draft state constitution being circulated on the
 mainland in 1982 provides in Article 30 for the
 establishment of special administrative regions. This
 is a new article, intended to create a legal basis for the
 existence within China of places such as Taiwan,
 Hong Kong, and Macau with non-Communist politi-
 cal and economic systems. The new constitution also
 drops from the preamble the statement in the previous
 constitution "We are determined to liberate Taiwan,"
 replacing it with "Taiwan is part of the sacred

 Secret
 territory of the People's Republic of China. To accom-
 plish the great task of reunifying the motherland is
 the sacred duty of the entire Chinese people, including
 our compatriots in Taiwan." The constitution gives
 Sun Yat-sen a place of honor in China's revolutionary
 history.
 To achieve the special status offered by Beijing, the
 Taiwan authorities would have to acknowledge Chi-
 nese sovereignty over Taiwan and abandon the use of
 the naive Republic of China, together with its nation-
 al flag and anthem. In private conversations, Chinese
 officials have stated that defense and foreign affairs
 would be the responsibility of the central government.
 Thus, any arrangements for Taipei's armed forces to
 acquire materiel abroad would have to be approved by
 Beijing, and Taiwan's overseas representatives would
 become representatives of "China." How this would
 work out in practice would obviously have to be the
 subject of detailed negotiations.
 Peaceful Behavior in Taiwan Strait. Coincident with
 the National People's Congress message to compatri-
 ots on Taiwan, Beijing announced the ending of the
 odd-day shelling of the offshore islands that had
 persisted since the early I 960s in the form of shells
 loaded with propaganda leaflets. Also during 1979 it
 opened access to Xiamen (Amoy), directly opposite
 Taiwan-occupied Chinmen Tao (Quemoy), and re-
 duced emphasis on Fujian Province as a war area. In
 1981 it opened Fujian to travel by foreign correspon-
 dents and diplomats.
 Negotiations. All Chinese proposals for negotiations
 have been firmly rejected by Chiang Ching-kuo and
 other Taiwan spokesmen, and there is no evidence
 that any serious negotiations are under way between
 Beijing and the authorities on Taiwan. Chinese offi-
 cials charged with conducting policy toward Taiwan
 show some understanding of the difficulties that
 Chiang Ching-kuo would have in opening negotiations
 and do not seem unduly disturbed that negotiations
 have not begun.
 While there is no evidence of formal negotiations,
 there is a good deal of evidence of informal soundings
 being taken in each direction through a variety of
 channels. Officials in Taipei are extremely careful not
 to give the impression of exchanging views with
 officials in Beijing, and there is no evidence that they
 initiate soundings; nevertheless, they receive many
 visitors who have talked with Chinese officials at
 various levels and listen closely to what they have to
 say. Officials in Beijing no doubt do the same,
 although they do not share their Taiwan counterparts'
 concern about creating the impression of negotiating.
 On the contrary, Beijing has at times, particularly just
 after the announcement of Ye Jianying's nine points,
 deliberately sought to give the impression that talks
 might be going on behind the scenes.
 The timing and nature of the Ye Jianying proposals
 suggest that they probably were aimed as much at the
 United States as at Taiwan. Taipei's public charge
 that they were purely propaganda intended for the
 United States, however, goes too far. They appear to
 be a carefully crafted set of proposals designed to
 influence people on Taiwan and eventually to provide
 a basis for negotiation. Further elaborations and
 refinements probably can be expected.
 United Front Operations. Through a wide variety of
 united front activities and channels Beijing seeks to
 convince the authorities and people of Taiwan that the
 unification of Taiwan with the mainland is both
 desirable and inevitable. Those engaged in united
 front work stress the benefits of a peaceful settlement,
 playing down the military threat held in reserve. The
 Chinese began to increase emphasis on united front
 operations early in 1978 and intensified them after
 the normalization of diplomatic relations between
 China and the United States. Responsibility for con-
 ducting this work lies with the Taiwan Working
 Group of the CCP, nominally headed by Zhou Enlai's
 widow, Deng Yingchao, with Liao Chengzhi and Luo
 Chingchang as her deputies. United front work has
 taken three principal forms: activities within China
 intended to influence favorably the people of Taiwan;
 propaganda through various media aimed at Taiwan;
 and contacts in Hong Kong or abroad with people
 from Taiwan or third parties considered good chan-
 nels for conveying information to Taiwan.

 Secret
 Within China a directive has been issued to prohibit
 discrimination against persons with relatives in Tai-
 wan and to rehabilitate those falsely persecuted in the
 past. Special efforts are to be made to help those who
 are relatives of KMT personages who had fled to
 Taiwan. Some prominent persons with relatives in
 Taiwan are being allowed to leave China for family
 reunions.
 Propaganda directed to Taiwan reports extensively on
 the activities of persons of Taiwan origin in China.
 The long-established Taiwan Democratic Self-Gov-
 ernnment League has now been joined by the All-
 China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, which held
 its first congress in December 1981 in the Taiwan hall
 of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. As Liao
 pointed out at that congress, however, the Chinese are
 somewhat handicapped in utilizing effectively those of
 Taiwan origin in China by reason of their remarkably
 small number: only 20,000, as compared with 30,000
 in Japan, 200,000 in the United States, and 18 million
 in Taiwan.
 Propaganda reciting the activities of persons of Tai-
 wan origin has been eclipsed, especially during 1981,
 by reporting on activities that seem intended to appeal
 more to mainlanders in Taiwan than to native Tai-
 wanese. These include the commemoration of the
 70th anniversary of the 1911 revolution, the increased
 attention to Sun Yat-sen, the talk of a third period of
 KMT-CCP cooperation, and the revival of the minor
 parties that were active in the early 1950s. Among
 these parties, the Kuomintang Revolutionary Com-
 mittee (KMTRC) has been given the most prominent
 role. Leaders of the KMTRC appeal through broad-
 casts to "old friends" in Taiwan, assuring them that
 China is carrying forward the ideals of Sun Yat-sen in
 the "Four Modernizations."' The KMTRC is enroll-
 ing new members, setting up Taiwan work commit-
 tees in the provinces, and stepping up contacts with
 those who have relatives in Taiwan or overseas. In an
 effort to appeal to Taiwanese businessmen as well as
 the KMT, China has publicized the return of property
 to "national capitalists" and the resurrection of the
 long-moribund All-China Federation of Industrialists
 ' The slogan "Four Modernizations" refers to modernizing China's
 agriculture, industry, science and technology, and national defense.
 and Businessmen. China's news agency, Xinhua, re-
 fers to members of this organization as having broad
 ties with compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
 Macau and among overseas Chinese, placing them in
 a favorable position to work for the early reunification
 of Taiwan with the mainland.
 In July 1982 Liao Chengzhi wrote an open letter to
 his "old friend" Chiang Ching-kuo, recalling their
 association in Moscow and Nanking (Nanjing). He
 expressed concern at the state of Chiang's health and
 urged him to act before it was too late to secure
 himself an honored place in Chinese history by con-
 tributing to China's unification.
 United front work directives and comments by people
 engaged in this work show that they have learned a
 good deal over the past three years about the actual
 attitudes of people in Taiwan and have modified their
 techniques in an effort to make them more effective.
 They recognize that past assumptions of a widespread
 popular desire on Taiwan for unification were wrong;
 that, on the contrary, most people have serious doubts
 about the desirability of unification. According to
 reliable information, the deputy directors of the
 CCP's United Front Work Department have a clear
 picture of the present political climate on Taiwan and
 realize that Taiwanese and mainlanders alike are
 "absolutely solid" in wanting to preserve Taiwan's
 present political status. A fact-finding mission to the
 United States in 1980 reported back that students
 from Taiwan had many erroneous ideas about condi-
 tions on the mainland and there was great need to
 educate them. United front workers recognize that
 both the authorities and the people on Taiwan have
 many fears and worries about unification and that to
 overcome them will require a long, careful, and
 understanding effort. Liao Chengzhi appears to be
 well informed on attitudes on Taiwan, but the extent
 to which such knowledge percolates up to the top
 leaders is uncertain. In November 1981, Deng Xiao-
 ping reportedly said to former Japanese Prime Minis-
 ter Fukuda, "We think people may be unable to speak
 their mind." Deng and others, knowing that Chinese
 unification proposals are not published or publicly
 discussed in Taiwan, may believe that substantial
 suppressed prounification sentiment exists there.

 The increasing sophistication in propaganda toward
 Taiwan resulting from greater understanding of con-
 ditions there was reflected in a high-level decision not
 to play up the return to the mainland in late 1981 of
 Ma Bi, a special research fellow at the General
 Political Warfare Department of the armed forces in
 Taiwan, adviser to the Taiwan Garrison Command,
 and secretary general of the Sun Yat-sen Doctrine
 Research Society. High-level Chinese officials recog-
 nized that public gloating over the defection of a
 person engaged in such sensitive work, a close asso-
 ciate of Wang Sheng, head of the General Political
 Warfare Department, would be counterproductive.
 Chinese agencies showed similar sophistication in
 handling the defection of an F5-F pilot from Taiwan.
 Directors of united front work view personal contacts
 with people from Taiwan in Hong Kong and Macau
 and overseas as prime conduits for getting their
 message across. Earlier restrictions on contacts have
 been eased, and Chinese officials abroad are instruct-
 ed to take the initiative to establish friendly relations
 with people from Taiwan. They are told to inform
 them about conditions on the mainland, speaking
 truthfully, not trying to propagandize, but stressing
 areas in which the Communist system is superior to
 capitalism. Shifting from a posture of confrontation to
 one of conciliation, Beijing has authorized its officials
 to accept invitations to affairs sponsored by pro-
 Taiwan overseas Chinese associations and to join
 overseas press associations without demanding the
 ouster of the member from Taiwan. Sports events
 involving competition between teams from China and
 Taiwan have been encouraged and have taken place in
 the United States, Japan, and Hong Kong. Interna-
 tional scientific and technical conferences are other
 important arenas for contacts. Chinese representatives
 at sports events and conferences have been granted
 considerable flexibility to acquiesce in the designation
 used by a group from Taiwan, so long as the name
 Republic of China or the ROC nag and anthem are
 not used. The mainland delegation need not insist on
 identifying itself as from the People's Republic of
 China; it can use "Beijing, China," as the counterpart
 to "Taipei, China." A number of instances of long,
 friendly talks between scientists from China and
 Taiwan have been reported.
 A unique target for united front work are fishermen
 from Taiwan. Special stations have been established
 for the reception of fishermen forced ashore by storms
 or by the need of repairs to their boats. They are
 warmly welcomed, taken on sightseeing tours, and
 resupplied with food and fuel. The four reception
 centers in Fujian received nearly 400 boats and 2,800
 fishermen in 1981, a 10-percent increase over 1980. A
 lively trade in consumer goods has sprung up at sea
 between fishermen from Taiwan and the mainland.
 When the authorities cracked down on smuggling into
 Fujian by fishermen from Hong Kong, they condoned
 similar activities by Taiwan fishermen.
 Evidence that the authorities on Taiwan are respond-
 ing to China's conciliatory posture is favorably report-
 ed in mainland media. For example, the friendly
 reception and sightseeing tour given the Chinese crew
 of a foreign freighter that docked at Chilung (Kee-
 lung) in March 1980 was widely publicized in China,
 as was the reception of a table tennis team from
 China during a brief unscheduled stopover at the
 Taoyuan airport in May of the same year.
 Undermining Taiwan's Claim To Be a Separate
 Political Entity. While showing greater willingness
 than in the past to accept a de facto two-Chinas
 situation in nonofficial international bodies, China
 rigidly opposes the presence of representatives from
 Taiwan in international governmental organizations
 and refuses to allow its representatives to take part in
 any meeting, official or nonofficial, in which persons
 from Taiwan are identified as representing the Re-
 public of China.
 Through its propaganda, particularly that published
 in the Hong Kong press, the Chinese try to drive home
 the view that Taiwan is part of China. In negotiations
 with the United States it has sought acknowledgment
 of Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. After failing to
 dissuade the Dutch from selling two submarines to
 Taiwan, Beijing downgraded relations to the charge
 d'affaires level in order to put other countries, espe-
 cially the United States, on notice that China did not
 regard the arms trade as ordinary trade, but as a form

 Secret
 of trade that implied recognition of Taiwan as a
 separate political entity. In fact, however, Beijing has
 tolerated arms sales to Taiwan so long as they did not
 become publicly known. In March 1982 it sent notes
 to diplomatic missions in Beijing warning against any
 attempt to give official color to the nondiplomatic
 offices that some countries maintain in Taiwan or
 taking any action "which is tantamount to treating
 Taiwan as an independent political entity." China has
 not, however, taken any action against countries
 maintaining these quasi-official offices in Taiwan, nor
 has it taken any additional measures against the
 Dutch.
 Encouraging Trade With Taiwan. The Chinese have
 taken a variety of measures to promote trade with
 Taiwan, including exempting Taiwan goods from
 import duties, exempting Taiwan ships from tonnage
 fees in mainland ports, and exempting foreign ships
 from tonnage fees if they can show that they paid
 tonnage fees in a Taiwan port. Chinese broadcasts
 report that Taiwan goods are popular on the mainland
 and offer coal and oil in return, an offer that Taiwan
 so far has rejected. According to the Chinese-owned
 .Vin Wanbao in Hong Kong, China would welcome
 investment from Taiwan in joint exploration for off-
 shore oil. Taiwan businessmen are welcomed at the
 Guangzhou Fair, although none are known to have
 gone.
 The nature of the propaganda on Taiwan trade as well
 as private comments make clear that its main purpose
 is political, to forge ties between Taiwan and the
 mainland that will further the unification process.
 Economic considerations would be secondary if a
 long-term deal could be struck on coal or oil that
 would create an ongoing dependence by Taiwan on
 supplies from the mainland. Despite the underlying
 political motivation on Beijing's part, the actual indi-
 rect trade that has developed so far, mainly through
 Hong Kong, amounting to over US $500 million in
 1981, is based on economic factors. The decline in
 Taiwan's indirect trade with China in the first quarter
 of 1982 (imports down 24 percent, exports up 10
 percent) seems also to be attributable to economic
 factors, including shortage of foreign exchange on the
 part of buyers in China, overstocking, and tighter
 control from Beijing over purchases of Taiwan goods
 by organizations in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces.
 Reserving Right To Use Force, But Playing It Down.
 In April 1978, Wu Xiuchuan told a group of Japanese
 military experts that Taiwan would not be liberated
 without recourse to military force, although the "Four
 Modernizations" had priority and there was no hurry
 to liberate Taiwan. Since normalization of relations
 with the United States and the NPC's "message to
 Taiwan compatriots," however, China has stressed its
 intention to bring about the return of Taiwan to the
 mainland by peaceful means, dropping the term "lib-
 eration." Deng Xiaoping stated the official position in
 a response to American reporters in January 1979:
 "Of course we shall strive to solve the question of
 Taiwan's return to the motherland by peaceful means.
 But whether this can be done is a very complex
 question. We cannot commit ourselves that no other
 means than peaceful means will be used to achieve the
 reunification of the motherland. We cannot tie our
 hands on this matter. If we tied our hands, we would
 obstruct the realization of the good intention to solve
 the matter peacefully."

 Secret
 Problems in Formulating and Conducting Policy
 -I b.senee (d 'Inducements T O A ttract People oJ' Taiwan.
 I Living chosen to play down military threats and
 other forms of pressure, China has tried through its
 sNide range of conciliatory gestures to convince the
 authorities and people of Taiwan that it is in their
 long-term interest to come to terms. I'.xcept for the
 measures taken to encourage trade, however, they
 lack inducements that would appeal to the self--
 interest of people on Taiwan. Tic increased flow of
 inforniation about the mainland reaching people in
 I moan through credible personal channels has served
 only to confirm their vices that they are much better
 off than the Chinese on the mainland and that the
 ( onununist system ha; little to offer them. Beijing's
 offer of postunification financial aid to Taiwan pro-
 vokcs derisive laughter on that prosperous little island,
 v%ith its S8 billion in foreign exchange reserves and
 case access to loans from foreign banks. Trade with
 the mainland is attractive to a small number of'
 husinessnten, but so I'm- has not exceeded 2 percent of
 I aiv,an's total foreign trade. 1-he Chinese offer of
 large amounts of coal and oil at favorable prices in
 principle should appeal to resource-poor Taiwan, but
 the authorities, while permitting private individuals to
 engage in indirect trade, are reluctant to have govern-
 ment corporations become involved in mainland trade,
 as would be Accessary rf large amounts of coal and oil
 s ere purchased. An even stronger deterrent is their
 fear of becoming dependent on China for vital basic
 commodities or, indeed, for any substantial proportion
 of their foreign trade. It is also doubtful at the present
 time vN hethcr China could make large amounts of coal
 or oil :mailable to Taiwan, as there are shortages on
 the mainland and the bulk of that available for export
 is tied up in contracts with Japanese buyers.
 Contradiction Between Conciliation and Pressure.
 I or the people on Tais an the smiling face represented
 b~ the V'e .lianying proposals and other conciliatory
 gestures is belied by Beijing's refusal to rule out
 expressly the use of force and bv its pressure on the
 United States and others to end arms sales. Ye's offer
 to allow Taiwan to retain its armed forces seems
 meaningless if those forces are denied the right to
 maintain and modernize their equipment by pur-
 chases from abroad. Beijing's assertion in the joint
 US-Chinese communique of 17 August 1982 that
 striving for peaceful reunification is its "fundamental
 policy" does not compensate, in Taiwan's view, for the
 US commitment in that communique to reduce the
 sale of arms to Taiwan.
 ('ontradiction Between Modernization and Taiwan
 Recovery. A more basic contradiction for Beijing is
 that pressure on the United States to end arms sales
 to Taiwan risks damaging the prospects for continued
 US cooperation in C'hina's own modernization.
 Whether To Appeal Mainly to Chiang ('hing-kuo
 and Mainlanders or to Taiwanese. A dilemma that
 the Chinese have been unable to resolve satisfactorily
 is whether to direct the appeal for unification primari-
 ly at Chiang Ching-kuo and the mainlanders on
 Taiwan or to the Taiwanese. Policy differences are
 known to exist in Beijing over this question among
 those engaged in united front work toward Taiwan,
 people of Taiwan origin tend to favor emphasis on
 appealing to the Taiwanese, while others emphasize
 the need to reach agreement with Chiang ('hing-kuo
 and his mainlander associates.
 Arguments for aiming primarily at Chang Ching-kuo
 are strong for those who assume that agreement can
 be reached or the process of negotiation can be
 started, at ]cast, within the next few years. Chiang
 Ching-kuo and his mainlander associates hold power,
 they are longtime adversaries of the Chinese Commu-
 nists and thus are well known to the leaders in Beijing,
 and they have family and sentimental tics to the
 mainland. Most important of all, Chiang Ching-kuo
 has held firmly to the one-China position and has
 repressed Taiwan independence advocates.
 The longer it seems likely to take to reach agreement
 on unification, however, the more important it is for
 China to influence the Taiwanese, for it is apparent

 Secret
 that power will ultimately be in their hands. More-
 over, Taiwanese already own most of the private
 economy: mainlander-controlled government corpora-
 tions account for only 18 percent of total production.
 Chinese appeals narrowly focused on the mainlander
 leadership intensify suspicions among the Taiwanese
 that a deal may be struck with Beijing that ignores
 their views and interests and may increase proinde-
 pendence sentiment among them.
 Ilow to frame appeals to the Taiwanese is itself a
 tricky problem. As indicated above, China has few
 inducements to offer, other than the trade that inter-
 ests some Taiwanese businessmen. China is, of course,
 adamantly opposed to an independent state of Tai-
 wan. Playing up KMT repression of the Taiwanese is
 risky, for if such propaganda should intensify Taiwan-
 ese animosity toward the KNIT, it might result in
 increasing proindependence sentiment. United front
 work directives and comments by Chinese functionar-
 ies suggest a concern that leaders of a Taiwanese
 uprising against the KMT would not be persons
 favoring unification with the mainland. Chinese prop-
 aganda treatment of' the Kaohsiung incident of De-
 cenmber 1979 illustrated its problem: it denounced
 KMT suppression of the Taiwanese demonstration
 but it could not admit that the demonstration was in
 support of the concept "Taiwan for the Taiwanese.''
 Consequently, after some delay, it took the line that
 the KMT was attempting to put down a "patriotic
 and democratic movement" and trying to silence ever-
 louder calls for reunification of the motherland. After
 the trial and sentencing of the Kaohsiung defendants
 in the spring of 1980, Beijing urged their release,
 declaring: "We firmly support the democratic move-
 ment on the island of Taiwan for patriotism and
 unification." Far from influencing the people on
 Taiwan in the desired direction, this falsification
 could only undercut the credibility of Beijing's propa-
 ganda, for it was public knowledge in Taiwan that the
 Kaohsiung defendants stood for self-determination for
 Taiwan, not for unification with the mainland.
 Recognizing the need to appeal to Chiang Ching-kuo
 in the short term and to the Taiwanese in the long
 term, the Chinese have tried to do both. Some of Ye
 .1ianying's nine points, for example, seem aimed pri-
 marily at mainlanders and others at Taiwanese. Prop-
 aganda directives call for placing the primary empha-
 sis on "the people of Taiwan" and secondary emphasis
 on "the authorities." In practice, however, as indicat-
 ed above, the bulk of the united front operations in
 1981 and 1982 appear to have been aimed more at
 Chiang Ching-kuo and the mainlanders than at the
 Taiwanese. Chiang is not immune from criticism by
 Chinese propagandists, but they have been instructed
 not to be too severe with him. Nothing is to be gained
 by undermining Chiang's position, propagandists are
 told; on the contrary, he is deserving of praise for his
 unswerving commitment to one China and his opposi-
 tion to the Taiwan independence movement.
 Complications Produced by China-Taiwan Trade.
 Chinese encouragement of trade with Taiwan as a
 political measure to create links between Taiwan and
 the mainland has had some undesirable side effects
 for China. It has diverted scarce foreign exchange to
 the purchase of luxury consumer goods and in the
 process probably contributed to the growth of corrup-
 tion. Restrictions on the importation of luxury goods
 from Taiwan resulted in an increase in smuggling in
 Fujian. In January 1981. Xinhua reported that, from
 the latter half of 1980, smuggling had become ram-
 pant in the Xiamen customs area.
