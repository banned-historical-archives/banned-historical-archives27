 China: Foreign Trade
 ResurgenceF--]
 economy
 Earlier this year Beijing renewed its commitment to the open-door policy
 and economic reform. These decisions will greatly benefit foreign trade, as
 well as the domestic economy. Over the past 35 years centralized planning
 and an arbitrary pricing system have hampered China's integration into
 the world economy. The loosening of central controls and the adoption of
 price reforms at the October meeting of the party's 12th Central Commit-
 tee will help China realize greater gains from international trade by
 providing economically more rational criteria for trade and investment
 decisions. Conversely, increased competition through international trade
 will give the Chinese a barometer to assess the performance of the domestic
 forecasts China's balance of payments in 1984.
 This paper briefly describes the economic events that led to Beijing's
 decision to reassert an open-trade policy and examines current trends in
 China's international economic affairs. It also assesses the impact of the
 economic readjustment and reforms on China's international finances and
 the International Atomic Energy Agency.
 Late last year China began to resume its capital-import program after a
 three-year hiatus, and this year foreign purchases have picked up sharply.
 Although Beijing all but halted new orders for Western equipment and
 technology during its attempt to readjust the domestic economy, it
 continued to lay the groundwork for close trading relations with the West.
 It enacted legislation on foreign investments and patents, signed bilateral
 tax and investment treaties with several countries, and joined the Multi-Fi-
 ber Arrangement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and
 funds at home.
 Export expansion and import restraint have given the Chinese three
 consecutive years of substantial trade and current account surpluses.
 China's total international reserve holdings rose to nearly $20 billion by the
 end of 1983, the 10th largest in the world. Although this achievement
 improved China's already excellent international credit rating, China
 would have derived even greater economic benefits from investing these
 for foreign sales to and cooperative ventures with China.

 All signs point to a resurgence of trade this year. We expect imports to
 grow 25 to 30 percent. The largest gains-at least 50 to 70 percent-will
 be in capital goods. Transport equipment purchases in particular have
 surged, boding well for the United States in such areas as jet aircraft,
 helicopters, and locomotives. Agricultural imports, however, will continue
 to decline, reflecting four consecutive years of excellent harvests.
 Although exports jumped 22 percent in the first half of 1984 compared
 with the first half of 1983, we do not expect this trend to continue. For the
 year as a whole, exports probably will rise only 15 to 20 percent. Beijing it-
 self is concerned about developments at home and abroad that will affect
 long-term prospects for China's exports. Externally, protectionism has
 reduced the developed countries' demand for China's exports. Internally,
 budget deficits-partly caused by mounting subsidies to foreign trade-
 have occupied the attention of Chinese leaders.
 To compensate for volume quotas and other quantitative restrictions on
 their exports, the Chinese have had to export higher quality goods-
 products that compete more directly with items produced in the West.
 Beijing also has tried to open up new markets in the Middle East, the Sovi-
 et Union, South Korea, and Latin America. These markets have grown
 quickly but will not provide a solution for China's vast, long-term foreign
 exchange needs.
 Over the past two years domestic financial losses from foreign trade have
 ballooned. Because domestic prices are not in line with world prices,
 Beijing has had to subsidize both exports and imports of some products to
 achieve the desired product mix. Furthermore, as the foreign trade system
 became more decentralized, China's irrational domestic price structure
 tended to distort the desired commodity trade patterns.
 In March the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade an-
 nounced that trade would be recentralized under its aegis, ostensibly to
 solve these problems. There are serious disagreements in Beijing over the
 needed solutions, however, with many in power favoring price reforms
 instead of recentralization. We believe that even if recentralization were
 carried out-which now appears unlikely-it would not curtail trade at the
 local and provincial level, nor ease the need for subsidies.

 Beijing's slow progress in attracting foreign investment had been caused in
 part by disagreements between Chinese leaders on the extent of incentives
 that should be offered to foreign companies. This past year, however,
 Beijing pushed forward with its open-door policy by opening additional
 port cities to foreign investment and giving them greater decisionmaking
 authority. Foreign investment in China, which at the end of 1983 totaled
 $1.5 billion, including that in offshore oil, probably will climb to over $2.5
 billion by the end of this year.
 China's change in status from net debtor to creditor stems both from
 Beijing's readjustment policy and from stringent foreign exchange control
 measures established in early 1981:
 ? The Chinese have used very little of the $27 billion in commercial and
 government-supported credit lines they arranged in 1979.
 ? Last year China prepaid most of its long-term commercial debt as well as
 all of its first credit tranche from the International Monetary Fund.
 ? Beijing is restructuring the small foreign debt that remains by reducing
 interbank borrowings and taking on long-term, low-interest loans from
 the World Bank, Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, and
 other official sources.
 Nevertheless, over the longer term, China will need to tap the commercial
 markets in a big way if it is to complete its ambitious development plans.

 China: Fore* n Trade
 Resurgence
 The three-year hiatus in China's capital-import pro-
 gram that began in early 1981 has ended, and China
 is again seeking Western equipment and technology.
 Beijing has reordered its priorities and has begun to
 erect an institutional framework to attract foreign
 investment. It is now intensifying the search for

 foreign partners.
 Impact of the Economic Readjustment
 Under the economic readjustment program an-
 nounced in 1979, the Chinese cut investment in order
 to stimulate consumption. At the same time, they
 deemphasized heavy industry in favor of light indus-
 try. As a result, imports of producer goods and
 industrial supplies plummeted. Contrary to specula-
 tion in the Western press, the dropoff in purchases did
 not reflect foreign exchange difficulties. Chinese ex-
 ports were growing rapidly, and Beijing had access to
 large sums of credit in the West.
 The resulting trade surpluses boosted China's interna-
 tional reserves to nearly $20 billion by the end of
 1983, the 10th largest total reserves in the world and
 the seventh largest in terms of foreign exchange alone
 (see table 1). This level of reserves-more than one
 year's worth of imports-was much larger than need-
 ed to cover any exigencies.
 For a capital-poor country the change from capital
 importer to capital exporter made little economic
 sense. Interest earnings on China's deposits in foreign
 banks were far less than the potential return on
 capital invested domestically. Foreign exchange de-
 posits abroad did nothing to rebuild China's aging
 infrastructure nor to upgrade its inefficient industrial
 base. Moreover, maintaining a trade surplus created
 inflationary pressures at home-state procurement of
 goods for export injected more currency into circula-
 tion than was absorbed by domestic sales of imports,
 that is, more money chased fewer goods. The large
 buildup of foreign exchange reserves also raised the
 question of whether China deserved access to low-cost
 funds from the World Bank and other international

 In 1983 China began to put its foreign exchange
 earnings to more productive use. It invested them not
 only in domestic infrastructural projects such as
 energy, transportation, and communications, where
 lack of investment had severely constrained economic
 lending agencies.

 growth, but also in light industry and agriculture. By
 the fourth quarter of 1983, China's imports of capital
 equipment approached the record level of 1980, yet
 one of the biggest categories of capital goods-
 payments for industrial know-how, production li-
 censes, technical services, and various forms of con-
 sultancy-does not show up in the trade returns. We
 estimate that payments for such invisibles exceeded
 $1 billion last year.
 Although imports slumped during 1981-83, Beijing
 continued to lay the foundation for even closer trading
 relations with the West. It joined both the Multi-
 Fiber Arrangement under the auspices of the General
 Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the
 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It en-
 acted a joint-venture law and completed work on a
 patent law to make investing in China more attractive
 to foreign entrepreneurs. It also signed bilateral tax
 and investment treaties with Japan and other coun-
 tries, establishing the rights of foreign investors. And
 it established sizable lines-of-credit with Japan, the
 World Bank, and Western commercial banks, which
 will allow China to proceed rapidly with major infra-
 structure projects once technical negotiations are
 concluded.
 More than any other move, however, Beijing's deci-
 sion in April 1984 to open 14 additional port cities
 and Hainan Island to foreign investment reflects its
 commitment to the open-door policy. As a result of
 the decision, local authorities in these areas will be
 given greater freedom to accept foreign investments
 without Beijing's approval, similar in many respects to
 the powers granted the authorities in the Special
 Economic Zones. Foreign investors in the new "eco-
 nomic development zones" will be given preferential
 tax rates, a waiver of import duties on goods that will
 be reexported, and greater access to domestic
 markets.
 This decision is a major departure from the past.
 Under Deng Xiaoping, Beijing has now assigned a
 leading role to the port cities in China's moderniza-
 tion process, contradicting Mao's longstanding policy
 of balanced growth between the coast and interior. In
 large part we believe the new policy is a pragmatic
 attempt to deal with an economic reality-China's
 transportation system is so overburdened that in real
 terms it often costs more for the port cities to trade
 with inland areas than with foreign countries.
 The decision, however, also reflects the growing influ-
 ence localities have on policies emanating from Beij-
 ing. Local and provincial authorities have warmly
 embraced their new prerogatives-indeed, many in-
 land cities are now claiming to possess the same rights
 as those granted to the coastal cities. The ability of
 localities to attract foreign funds for their investment
 projects gives them an alternative to using central
 government funds and a means of circumventing
 Beijing's controls. Under the financial "responsibil-
 ity" system now being instituted, the ability to find
 new sources of funds may be critical to economic
 survival.
 These actions will begin to bear fruit this year,
 significantly boosting the opportunities for foreign
 sales to and cooperative ventures with China. All
 signs point to a resurgence of trade. China's imports
 already have started to take off-they are more than
 20 percent higher than at the same time last year.
 Imports of capital goods and industrial supplies-
 particularly steel, nonferrous metals, lumber, and
 plastics-lead the list; imports of agricultural com-
 modities have dropped following three consecutive
 years of excellent harvests. For the year as a whole we
 expect imports will climb 25 to 30 percent to $23-24
 billion.
 Exports have jumped even more-22 percent in the
 first half of 1984-to produce the highest first-half
 trade surplus ever, but we do not expect this trend to
 continue. The Foreign Trade Ministry's announce-
 ment in mid-March that trade would be recentralized
 may have caused a temporary surge that could lead to
 a subsequent slowdown. We believe export growth for
 the year will be limited to about 15 to 20 percent,
 reducing the trade surplus to $3-5 billion. Most of this
 surplus will have occurred in the first half. In the
 second half, China's trade balance will decline consid-
 erably (see figure 1).

 Whether China's reserves will continue to grow will
 depend in part on complex equity and debt consider-
 ations. Based on past patterns, we would expect
 reserves to follow the trend of the trade balance.
 Although Beijing wants to reduce the level of its
 reserves, much of the capital equipment China will
 get will be through direct foreign investment or on
 buyer's credits. Therefore, reserves might not decline
 and could even increase. We project that by yearend
 reserves will be $2-4 billion higher than at the end of
 1983.
 The Uncertainties Ahead
 This past May, in his report to the National People's
 Congress on the 1984 economic plan, Song Ping,
 Minister in Charge of the State Planning Commis-
 sion, announced that China's total trade volume in
 1984 would decline 5 percent from the 1983 level.
 Wang Weicai, director of the State General Adminis-
 tration of Foreign Exchange Control, has stated that
 China will run a merchandise trade deficit for the
 year. We believe the Chinese projections seriously
 underestimate trade growth in 1984, particularly for
 exports. In the last three years Chinese officials have
 consistently made inaccurate predictions of China's
 foreign trade prospects. Lack of up-to-date trade data
 and the volatility of the international economy are
 largely to blame. Growing uncertainty over the pros-
 pects for exports, caused by both external and internal
 developments, has added to Beijing's cautiousness this
 year.
 Recession and Protectionism. Externally, recession
 and protectionism have reduced developed-country
 demand for China's exports. Over the past two years
 lower world market commodity prices have hurt
 China's agricultural, mineral, and crude oil exports.
 At the same time, Chinese attempts to gain greater
 access to the US and EC textile markets have been
 rebuffed.
 In response China has attempted to boost sales to the
 Soviet Union, the Middle East, South Korea, and
 other untapped markets. Arms sales to the Middle
 East, for example, shot up from almost nothing in
 1980 to an estimated $1.5 billion last year-6 percent
 of total exports. In an attempt to earn foreign ex-
 change, China has even offered to store nuclear waste
 materials for several West European nations. Beijing
 hopes that increased trade with the Soviets may also
 help reduce Sino-Soviet tensions and that increased
 trade with the less developed countries will increase
 China's visibility, foster better political relations, and
 diminish Soviet influence. All of these markets, how-
 ever, involve some long-term political risks and will
 provide only a short-term boost to China's hard
 currency earnings.

 Budgetary Problems. Internally, budgetary problems
 continue to occupy the attention of Chinese leaders.
 The central budget remained in deficit in 1983,
 particularly because subsidies to agriculture and for-
 eign trade took an unanticipated jump.
 subsidies could restrict the growth of both exports and
 imports this year
 The trade subsidies are a result of China's irrational
 price structure-domestic prices are fixed arbitrarily
 and are not in line with world market prices. At the
 "internal settlement rate" of 2.8 yuan per dollar-the
 exchange rate at which Chinese entities are permitted
 to convert foreign exchange into yuan at the Bank of
 China-the domestic prices of primary products gen-
 erally appear to be lower than world prices and those
 of manufactures appear to be higher.' Hence, it is
 generally profitable for Chinese traders to export
 primary products and to import manufactures. The
 reverse-exporting manufactures and importing pri-
 mary products-tends to produce losses.
 At the official exchange rate in use prior to 1981,
 exports produced losses, on balance, while imports
 produced profits, a sure sign of the overvaluation of a
 currency.' Because foreign trade corporations (FTCs)
 under the Ministry of Foreign Trade handled all
 trade, the FTCs could offset the losses on trade in one
 commodity with the gains made on another, and such
 losses or gains did not affect the decision to trade. P
 As China's foreign trade system became more decen-
 tralized, however, the domestic price structure led to a
 trade pattern that was contrary to China's compara-
 tive advantage. The price system encouraged exports
 of capital- and land-intensive commodities that were
 in short supply (for example, oil, steel, and tobacco)
 and encouraged imports of labor-intensive manufac-
 tures that could have been produced for a lower real
 cost at home (for example, cameras, televisions, radi-
 os, and wristwatches)
 ' It is difficult to generalize about Chinese prices. The generaliza-
 tion above applies only to major commodities at the wholesale level
 that would enter into world trade; it does not apply to retail prices.
 ' During most of the 1970s, the official exchange rate, as published
 by the Bank of China, floated between 1.5 and 2.0 yuan per dollar.
 Since early 1981 Beijing has taken several steps to
 counteract these distortions. First, Beijing-in ef-
 fect-devalued the yuan by introducing the internal
 settlement rate. Although this step reduced the level
 of subsidies for exports, it increased subsidies for
 many imports. Moreover, with a decline in some
 highly profitable imports that resulted from the read-
 justment of the economy and with a decline in world
 prices for many of China's exports, net financial losses
 from trade increased sharply, resulting in record
 government subsidies last year.
 In 1982 Beijing introduced a trade licensing system
 and revised its tariff system to prevent local enter-
 prises from exporting goods in short supply or from
 importing goods that competed with domestic prod-
 ucts. The licensing system gave the Ministry of
 Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (MFERT)
 new regulatory and oversight capabilities, while the
 new tariffs-on exports as well as imports-helped to
 shield the domestic price structure from the effects of
 international trade.'
 Finally, in March of this year MFERT announced
 that trade would be recentralized under its aegis.
 Pricing and supply problems created by the decentral-
 ization were offered as reasons for reasserting
 MFERT control. While these problems are no doubt
 real, we believe the recentralization announcement
 also was part of an attempt by Chen Muhua and
 others in MFERT to boost their positions within
 China's economic bureaucracy.
 Even if the recentralization order were carried out, we
 doubt that it would have significant consequences for
 the trade of local and provincial enterprises. Its
 primary effect would be to shuffle lines of responsibil-
 ity for trade within the central government itself. Last
 year the FTCs under MFERT reportedly were direct-
 ly responsible for about 40 percent of China's foreign
 trade, other ministries of the central government
 conducted about 20 percent, and local and provincial
 ' Export tariffs prevented Chinese traders from price cutting and
 thereby passing windfall profits on to foreign buyers, and import
 tariffs raised the domestic prices of foreign goods to protect local

 Secret
 enterprises were responsible for the rest. Under the
 recentralization order, MFERT was slated to recoup
 most of the trade conducted previously by other
 ministries.4 The lengthy treatment given in the Chi-
 nese press to the recentralization announcement sug-
 gests that Beijing merely intended to make the opera-
 tions of MFERT an example of how administration
 and economic management can be separated. Thus,
 many of the local producers, end users, and trading
 firms would continue to make economic decisions,
 while MFERT would administer the plan, regulating
 provincial trade through the use of licenses, tariffs,
 and other indirect controls. Although MFERT would
 exercise greater oversight, it would not supplant pro-
 vincial corporations.
 In anticipation of the recentralization announcement,
 many trade organizations in China may have rushed
 to fill standing export contracts in advance-one
 possible explanation for the strong upturn in exports
 in the first quarter. According to business reports on
 the spring Canton trade fair, prices were up 10 to 15
 percent, perhaps an indication of MFERT's new
 effectiveness in coordinating foreign trade negotia-
 tions. Whatever the reasons for the recent surge in
 Chinese exports, if Beijing maintains a disproportion-
 ate incentive to export and continues tight controls on
 imports, China's current account surpluses are unlike-
 ly to evaporate.
 Balance of Payments: Flush With Reserves
 China's central planners have attempted to prevent
 domestic economic pressures from causing excess
 demand for foreign goods. Nevertheless, domestic
 economic developments are transmitted, at least par-
 tially, to the foreign sector after some lag. Hence,
 China's balance of payments has reflected Beijing's
 shifting national economic policies. Current account
 surpluses during 1976-78 gave way to deficits in 1979
 and 1980, as deliveries began on the $10 billion worth
 of complete plants and equipment China had ordered
 in 1978. Readjustment policies favoring light industry
 and agriculture-announced in early 1979-did not
 affect China's current account until 1981, when deliv-
 eries of capital equipment and industrial supplies
 began to subside. Although the domestic economic
 recovery has been under way since 1982, imports
 began to pick up only in late 1983. Continuing export
 expansion and restraints on imports have given the
 Chinese three consecutive years of substantial trade
 and current account surpluses (see figure 2).
 Although the growth rate of trade in services has
 outpaced that in merchandise, service expenditures
 have generally exceeded earnings. Last year payments
 for industrial know-how, production licenses, techni-
 cal services, and various forms of consultancy in-
 creased dramatically-we estimate that payments for
 such invisibles totaled about $1.2 billion. The Chinese
 are making a major effort to turn the deficit in
 services into a surplus by expanding their internation-
 al merchant fleet, improving tourist facilities, and
 boosting foreign sales of construction labor services.
 China now has 29,000 workers abroad, double the
 number in 1980, and plans to have 100,000 workers in
 LDCs by 1990. In addition, interest earnings on
 China's foreign exchange holdings have climbed
 sharply (see appendix).
 In recent years China's net receipts from unrequited
 transfers have declined, primarily as a result of a
 slowdown in remittances from overseas Chinese. A
 decline in monetary remittances from Hong Kong
 probably reflects the opening up of the Crown Colo-
 ny's border with China-relatives now bring gifts
 instead of sending money-and the declining value of
 the Hong Kong dollar. Between 1980 and 1983 China
 received $71 million in funds from the UN, including
 $23 million from the UN Development Program, $8
 million from the Fund for Population Activities, $25
 million from the World Food Program, $5 million
 from the High Commissioner for Refugees, and $8
 million from UNICEF (the UN Children's Fund).
 Since 1977 China has substantially cut back its aid to
 the Third World to conserve resources for its own
 economic development. Nevertheless, its aid abroad
 still exceeds the amount it gets from international
 organizations.
 ' The Ministries of Coal and Machine Building, the Chinese State
 Shipbuilding Corporation, and the China National Automotive
 Corporation are the only organizations known to have received a
 waiver to continue trading.

 and "soft" loan assets.
 Proceeds from the current account surpluses have
 been used to lift foreign exchange reserves to record
 levels, to reduce foreign commercial debt, and to
 increase investments abroad. China's international
 reserves, excluding gold,' totaled $14.9 billion at the
 end of 1983 and in mid-1984 amounted to more than
 $16.8 billion, while China's total foreign debt stood at
 only $5.7 billion. For the past three years Beijing has
 restructured its foreign debt by reducing interbank
 borrowings and taking on long-term low-interest loans
 from the World Bank, Japan's Overseas Economic
 Cooperation Fund (OECF), and other official sources.
 Last year China prepaid its first credit tranche by
 drawing from the International Monetary Fund
 (IMF) one year ahead of schedule; it also paid off
 almost $1 billion in commercial debt. In 1984, debt
 servicing probably will amount to less than 5 percent
 of China's export earnings. Last year foreign invest-
 ment in China almost quadrupled the level of 1980,
 the first year any significant amount came in. This
 increase was not enough, however, to offset the heavy
 outflow of Chinese investment funds, particularly to
 Hong Kong and the United States.
 China's change in status from net debtor to creditor
 stems both from its readjustment policy and from
 stringent foreign exchange control measures estab-
 lished in early 1981. The decline in imports of capital
 goods mainly reflects reductions in investment in
 heavy industry. State budget deficits have reinforced
 the cutbacks in capital imports: in some cases domes-
 tic funds have not been sufficient to pay for the local
 costs of imported plants.
 Central regulations controlling foreign exchange have
 added to the growing reserves. Beginning in March
 1981 Beijing required all domestic enterprises to
 deposit their foreign earnings with the Bank of China
 rather than in foreign banks. It further required
 enterprises to repay hard currency loans in hard
 currency. Imports by Chinese firms are thus limited
 largely by the value of their own exports; surplus
 foreign exchange can be sold to other enterprises, but

 in the absence of developed capital or foreign ex-
 change markets the regulations help assure a trade
 surplus. Although the Chinese began to relax their
 capital controls in 1983, particularly on the remit-
 tances of foreign partners in joint ventures, they still

 China is managing its foreign exchange reserves
 better than it did just a few years ago, keeping most in
 the form of interest-bearing short-term time deposits
 at banks in New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong, London,
 Paris, and Bern. For the past year the Chinese have
 not taken a strong position in the gold market,
 preferring instead to engage primarily in gold arbi-
 trage. They have, however, purchased some silver on
 the international market for sales in China, apparent-
 ly to soak up excess domestic currency. Chinese
 economists are aware of the irrationality of holding
 such a large amount of reserves and have recommend-
 achieved from 1978 to 1981 ~
 The Search for New Export Markets
 In 1983, for the second consecutive year, recession
 and protectionism in the developed West slowed the
 growth of China's exports. Exports totaled $24 billion,
 up only 2 percent from the year before. This is far
 below the 25- to 30-percent annual growth rates
 als wherever possible (see figure 3).
 We estimate that in 1984 China's exports will grow at
 a rate of 15 to 20 percent as recovery in the industrial-
 ized countries gathers momentum. Agricultural ex-
 ports will be mixed, caught between higher world
 prices and increased domestic demand. Although the
 long-term outlook for exports from the extractive
 sector-including minerals, ores, coal, and oil-
 appears promising, the near-term prospects are for
 slow growth. Exports of manufactures will make the
 largest gains this year, as the Chinese continue to
 substitute exports of processed goods for raw materi-
 Over the past two years domestic supply shortages
 and weak foreign demand have hampered Chinese
 exports to the developed countries. Exports of agricul-
 tural commodities, petroleum, and other raw materi-
 als have stagnated or declined because of increasing
 demands in China and decreasing prices abroad.
 Petroleum exports dropped to $4.2 billion in 1983,
 reflecting price cuts of almost 15 percent. The volume
 of crude oil exports, however, increased almost 2
 percent to 300,000 barrels per day (14.8 million tons),
 an indication that Beijing continues to give high
 priority to exports despite increased shortages at
 home.
 Inadequate rail and port capacity continues to con-
 strain coal exports. Nevertheless, this year the volume
 of exports should increase to nearly 7 million metric
 tons-1 percent of total output. Japanese, European,
 and US firms are actively negotiating joint develop-
 ment projects with the Chinese. A major agreement
 was signed earlier this year with a US firm concern-
 ing the development of China's potentially largest
 open pit mine-the Pingshuo Mine in Shanxi.
 Exports from the Chinese mines,
 years.
 The Chinese have attempted to increase export earn-
 ings from their manufactures by moving into higher-
 value-added lines. Part of the reason for this strategy
 has been the increase in volume quotas and other
 quantitative restrictions on imports from China in the
 West, which force the Chinese to export better quali-
 ty, higher priced goods than they otherwise would.
 But the Chinese are also trying to increase their gains
 from trade by moving into exports that reflect their
 comparative advantage in labor-intensive products.
 By branching out into industries that require large
 inputs of manual labor, they hope to absorb some of
 the large number of unemployed into the work force.
 Unemployment among the urban labor force of 114
 million probably is much larger than the official
 unemployment figure of 2.6 percent reported at the
 end of June 1983.

 A Resumption of Foreign Purchases
 Last year imports rose 10 percent to $18.4 billion,
 after bottoming out in 1982. In contrast to 1982,
 when foodstuffs-chiefly grain and sugar-were the
 only major category of imports that increased, last
 year China sharply stepped up imports of industrial
 supplies and capital goods. We expect imports to grow
 this year on the order of 25 to 30 percent. Capital
 goods will show the largest gains, and industrial
 supplies will show growth in selected areas, but
 agricultUral itports. will continue-to decline.
 area sown to food grains in order to increase the
 output of commercial crops such as cotton and oil
 seeds. These adjustments are having a major impact
 on China's agricultural trade. Last year, for example,
 China cut back substantially on cotton imports and
 began exporting for the first time. Within the next
 few years China probably will emerge as an important
 cotton exporter. This development could significantly
 hurt US exports, especially to major Far Eastern
 markets.
 Grain imports dropped from 15.4 million tons in 1982
 to 13.5 million last year, in part because of increasing
 supplies at home." US sales fell from 8.5 million tons
 to 3.8 million last year-a loss of more than $700
 million-as China shifted purchases to Argentina and
 Canada during the dispute over US restrictions on
 textile imports from China. Shipments fell 2.2 million
 tons short of the 6-million-ton minimum required
 under the US-China long-term grain agreement.F_
 We believe three factors explain the fall in US         25X1
 shipments: lower import demand, the textile dispute,
 and the efforts of France and Argentina to move their
 large stocks of wheat by price cutting. Lower import
 demand would have cut US exports by about 1 million
 tons, or $150 million, since this factor presumably
 would not have affected the US market share. But the
 US share of China's grain imports fell from 55
 percent in 1982 to only 28 percent in 1983 as a result
 of the combined effects of price cutting and the textile
 dispute. This lower share represented a loss of about
 $550 million, or 4.7 million tons. And the largest part
 of this $550 million drop-roughly $300-400 mil-
 lion-is the result of the textile dispute, without which
 China probably would have bought at least the
 6-million-ton minimum.
 We project that total grain imports will decline to
 12-13 million tons in 1984. For the first half of the
 year, imports from the United States totaled 2.5
 million tons. The Chinese would have to make sizable
 purchases immediately in order to reach the minimum

 required under the agreement. We think it is increas-
 ingly likely that China will use the recent change in
 US rules for determining the country of origin for
 textile imports,' when and if it is implemented, as a
 reason for retaliating with another grain embargo.
 Under these circumstances, we believe the Chinese
 will let the long-term grain agreement expire when it
 comes up for renewal at the end of this year.
 Imports of most industrial supplies picked up substan-
 tially in 1983, reflecting increases in domestic eco-
 nomic activity and growing domestic shortages. Steel
 imports nearly doubled to 9.9 million metric tons as
 China surpassed the United States as Japan's num-
 ber-one customer. Imports of copper, aluminum, nick-
 el, and zinc also made impressive gains. Record
 imports of logs and plywood, two-thirds of which
 came from the United States, reflected the speedup in
 Chinese construction activities. Aside from its lumber
 sales, however, the United States was one of the few
 countries that did not benefit from China's increased
 purchases of industrial supplies, perhaps because of an
 exceptionally strong US dollar.
 We expect that imports of industrial materials this
 year will remain at about last year's level, with some
 exceptions. Lumber, plastics, and fertilizer are grow-
 ing strongly. Rubber imports are down, however, and
 cotton and synthetic textile fiber imports will continue
 to slump. Imports of US lumber may be vulnerable if
 there is another imbroglio over textiles. China proba-
 bly could turn to the Soviets and Canadians to fill its
 needs.
 Recovery of investment in China has resulted in a
 resurgence of capital equipment imports, which in-
 creased to $5.2 billion last year, up 36 percent over
 1982. Transportation equipment especially had a ban-
 ner year, and as a result US sales of aircraft and
 trucks increased. US exports of computers, telecom-
 munications equipment, machine tools, medical elec-
 tronic apparatus, and heavy construction equipment
 ' According to the new rules, textile products that are shipped
 among several countries during manufacture would be charged
 proportionately to the quotas of the country where the processing is
 done. Past rules charged products to the quota of the country that
 processed them last. The new system has caused great concern
 among textile exporting countries because it is expected to stifle
 legitimate trade mechanisms. China expects to lose 50,000 to
 100,000 jobs and more than $300 million in revenues from the
 also grew. Associated with the jump in capital equip-
 ment purchases has been a Chinese push to obtain
 pure technology. In the past year the Chinese have
 purchased know-how in such diverse areas as tree
 cultivation, insecticide chemistry, water control, food
 preservation, coal excavating and gasification, build-
 ing materials research, iron ore dressing, large-scale
 integrated circuits, cargo handling, birth control, dis-
 ease treatment, environmental protection, and energy
 conservation.
 We expect China's capital equipment imports to
 climb 50 to 70 percent this year. Transport equipment
 purchases in particular have surged, boding well for
 the United States in such areas as jet aircraft,
 helicopters, locomotives, marine radar, and support
 vessels. Imports of mining and construction equip-
 ment, fueled by the offshore drilling activity, have
 also risen sharply. Imports of oil industry equipment,
 such as production platforms for the Bohai Bay and
 South China Sea, are increasingly being paid for by
 foreign joint-venture firms and thus do not represent a
 major drain on China's foreign exchange reserves.
 Similarly, imports of military equipment and weapons
 may increase, depending in large part on the willing-
 ness of the United States and other Western countries
 to sell. Although China's long-term commitment to
 military self-sufficiency remains firm, in the short run
 the Chinese are willing to buy some weapons systems
 outright and are negotiating such deals with both
 European and US companies.
 Foreign Investment
 Until last year Beijing's progress in attracting foreign
 investment had been slow, in part because of the
 uncertainty of Chinese leaders and planners as to the
 extent of the incentives that should be offered to
 foreign companies. Other obstacles have been China's
 inexperience, lack of credibility with foreign business-
 men, inadequate infrastructure, problems.with labor
 productivity and wages, and the lack of detailed
 regulations on taxes and remittances of profits.

 Last year, however, Beijing made a range of conces-
 sions to gain more foreign participation in moderniz-
 ing the economy. Scores of new laws have been
 released to attract or protect the foreign investor. In
 September, China issued regulations to clarify its
 1979 Joint-Venture Law. The rules offered longer tax
 holidays, increased opportunities to sell the output of
 joint ventures in the domestic Chinese market, and
 provided more decisionmaking autonomy for ventures.
 Early this year China introduced new tax rules that
 exempt joint ventures from import duties and abolish
 certain industrial taxes on ventures that import ad-
 vanced machinery and technology. Last April the
 opening of 14 additional port cities and Hainan Island
 to foreign investment gave entrepreneurs many of the
 advantages of the Special Economic Zones. In addi-
 tion to ratifying this decision, the National People's
 Congress endorsed laws clarifying the status of totally
 foreign-owned companies in China.
 At the end of 1983 there were 188 "equity" and 1,047
 "contractual" joint ventures in China.' In addition
 there were 18 cooperative projects for offshore oil
 prospecting and exploitation. At the end of 1983 total
 paid-in foreign investment on these three forms of
 direct investment amounted to approximately $1.5
 billion. Of that total about $380 million is in the four
 Special Economic Zones, with the bulk in Shenzhen,
 on the Hong Kong border. If licensing agreements,
 processing and compensation trade, and wholly owned
 foreign subsidiaries are included in the totals, in
 ' From a Western viewpoint, both forms of joint ventures, as well as
 joint oil exploration agreements and wholly owned foreign subsid-
 iaries, are considered direct foreign investment. In our balance-of-
 payments estimates, other forms of business arrangements, such as
 licensing, processing, and compensation trade agreements, are not
 treated as foreign investment since no foreign claims on real assets
 located in China exist. The Chinese, however, use the term "foreign
 investment" loosely to refer to all forms of foreign participation,
 even loans to Chinese enterprises. The Chinese appear to use the
 term "cooperative production agreement" synonymously with "con-
 tractual joint venture." From a Chinese legal viewpoint, there are
 three chief distinctions between contractual and equity joint
 ventures:
 (a) Equity joint ventures fall under the joint-venture tax law (a
 flat 33-percent tax), whereas contractual ventures are taxed on a
 graduated basis under the foreign enterprise income tax.
 (b) Equity joint ventures share profits in proportion to equity
 participation, whereas contractual joint ventures share profits
 according to a ratio agreed to in the contract.
 (c) Equity joint ventures form new legal entities with their own
 boards of directors, whereas contractual joint ventures are managed

 accord with Chinese practice, total paid-in foreign
 investment amounted to $2.3 billion through the end
 of December 1983 (see table 3).
 As of November 1983, American investors had spent
 $406 million on 23 joint projects in China. There were
 16 equity joint ventures involving $91 million, one $10
 million cooperative management project, and eight
 agreements for joint exploitation of offshore oil worth
 $305 million. The three largest nonoil Sino-US joint
 ventures are the Great Wall Hotel with US participa-
 tion of $35 million, the Jianguo Hotel with US assets
 of $11 million, and American Motors Beijing Jeep
 Corporation with $16 million in US assets.
 China's competitive offshore leasing program got
 under way last year and now boasts 23 exploration
 and development contracts with 31 foreign oil compa-
 nies, including 12 US firms. Drilling will begin this
 year on most of the blocks, which are located in the

 Exploration continued last year in offshore areas
 previously leased to Japanese, French, and US firms.
 The Japanese have had success exploring in the Bohai
 and will soon begin developing at least one field.
 Atlantic Richfield found a commercially viable natu-
 ral gas field in its concession south of Hainan, but the
 discovery was marred by the loss of the drill ship and
 its 80-member American-Chinese crew in an October
 typhoon. The Chinese have asked Atlantic Richfield
 to lead a multibillion-dollar joint venture to use the
 gas from this field to produce fertilizer on Hainan
 Island.'
 The Chinese have also signed preliminary agreements
 with foreign investors for the Guangdong nuclear
 power plant and for development of the Pingshuo and
 Jungar open pit coal mines. They are currently ar-
 ranging financing for these projects and work could
 begin by early next year.
 Despite the obstacles to foreign investment posed by
 differences in economic environments and investment
 philosophies between China and the West, China's
 efforts to attract foreign investment have been rela-
 tively successful. Foreign investment in China at the
 end of 1983 was on a par with that in South Korea,
 just slightly below that of Taiwan, and about one-
 quarter the level of the other Asian NICs (newly
 industrialized countries)-Hong Kong and Singa-
 pore-and Indonesia (see table 4). By midyear 1984,
 however, foreign investment in China-led by explo-
 ration for offshore oil-probably surpassed that in
 South Korea or Taiwan.
 Foreign Debt
 The Chinese have used very little of the $27 billion in
 commercial and government-supported credit lines
 they arranged in 1979 (see table 5). Fiscal conserva-
 tism and cutbacks in capital expenditures, rather than
 the previous ideological aversion to foreign debt, have
 left little need for these loans
 ' If approved, the fertilizer plant would be the largest in the world.
 Atlantic Richfield is attempting to enlist other Western firms to

 China's current outstanding debt of $5.7 billion is a
 mixture of commercial and official loans with a wide
 range of maturities. For the past three years commer-
 cial borrowing has been cut back sharply, and it now
 accounts for less than one-quarter of the total debt.
 China is seeking only concessionary loans and will
 avoid incurring commercial debt for all but short-
 term trade financing

 b During 1981 and 1982 China prepaid $800 million and $1,100
 million in loans, respectively, which accounts for the abnormally
 large increase in debt servicing. Excluding these prepayments,
 China's ratio of debt service to exports in these years amounted to
 8.6 and 5.5 percent, respectively.
 c Data include exports, total earnings, and total credits.
 Earlier this year Tokyo also agreed to extend another
 $2.6 billion in Japan Export-Import Bank resource
 development loans to cover oil and coal development
 projects. The new loans will carry interest rates of 7.1
 to 7.3 percent. This compares with the 6.25-percent
 rate on the $2 billion line-of-credit that the Export-
 Import Bank provided in 1979.
 The Chinese have also obtained commitments for over
 $1.9 billion from the World Bank. The loans will
 cover 18 projects, including four for energy, two for
 communications development, four for agriculture,
 and the rest for education and medicine. Loans for
 energy account for 27 percent of the total; those for
 communications, 18 percent; and those for education-
 al projects, 22 percent. Of the total, the International
 Bank for Reconstruction and Development has con-
 tributed about $1.2 billion and the IDA (the Interna-
 tional Development Association) has contributed $734
 million. Only a small fraction of the loans have been
 drawn. While at first glance these loans might appear
 to crowd out commercial lending, this probably is not
 the case, since most of them are for infrastructural
 projects that do not provide high or immediate returns
 and thus would not attract commercial lenders.
