Moving Toward Stability. Management of Transient, Population Achieves 
Initial Results" � 
� 
-1. A notable,sign that initial results have been'achieved - 
is that the concept of nationwide coordination of the effort has 
been established, altering the.situation in which some departments 
had been_fighting the battle on their own and making the management 
of the transient .population a-system-wide project-- 
In�July_199E� alongwith_the Ministry of Public Security and 
the-Ministryot'Laborthe'Central-Committep-forJtheComprehensive 
Managementof7_Social:.Security.held the "All-China Working Conference 
on-theManagementcf.-.theTransient PopulatiOn"44n.Xiamen City in. 
-.Fujian Province,- which was the firstspecialized�conference-since 
the beginning of opening up.to the outside and reforms to specifically 
study the management of thetransient:populationg April this - 
year, the same committee also formed a leading team for the management 
of the transient population. 'One can say.that the comprehensive 
effort to-manage_the floating population ha 'entered' a.new'development 
stage. � 
At present, 26 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities 
directly under the central government nationwide and the Xinjiang 
PLA Production and Construction Corps have established transient 
population management leading (cooperation) teams that are under�% 
the leadership and management of the Party committee or the government, 
with the participation of responsible comrades from concerned departments, 
and they have also established an administrative body. Some areas - 
(cities) and counties (cities, districts) with rather large transient 
populations have established transient population management leadership 
teams and offices. Guangdong, Hebei, Tianjin, and many other placed 
have formed a fledgling transient population management network' 
in which the counties (cities, regions) have transient population 
management leadership teams and administrative bodies, the townships 
and neighborhoods have transient population management stations, 
and the village (residential) committees have temporary resident 
. reporting points. , . . 
At the same tiMe,,a labor service coordination system has'� 
already .taken shape in several large regions duch as eastern, southern, 
and northern China. Sichuan Province has set up labor service management 
bodies in 20 provinces, autonomous' regions, and municipalities directly 
under the central government, including Beijing and Shanghai. Eight 
provinces and autonomous regions, including Guangdong and Hunan, 
have established labor service coordination relations. 
With increased management power, the coverage of unified credentials 
management is gradually expanding everywhere. The issuance rate 
for "Temporary Resident ^ertificates" for the temporary population �

,Shanghai was 76.5 percent last year. The unification rate for 
certificates and cards" for the outsider workforce managed by the 
labor departments reached 90.percent, the health inspection rate 
for workers and trade personnel reached 71 percent, with the rental 
housing safety license verification rate, the rental .housing sign-posting 
rate, and the rental personnel register utilization rate being over 
90 percent. The employment certificate compliance rate for outside 
workers in Fujian reached 82.7 percent. 
The transient population management work is also gradually. � . 
becoming institutionalized. Seventeen provinces, autonomous regions, 
and municipalities directly under the central government, including 
Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia,- Liaoning, Jilin, 
Heilongjiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong,- Hainan, Yunnan, 
Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu have already formulated comprehensive 
transient population management measures. . .. 
2: One of the important aspects to managing the transient 
population is to crack down and put things in order. 
Management of places where the transient population stays 
temporarily and their places of activity has been strengthened everywhere. 
Jiangsu and other areas have launched efforts to straighten out 
rental housing, cleaning up places that harbored evil elements and . 
nabbing a bunch of illegal criminals.. The Guangdong Provincial government 
formulated the "Management Regulations for Renting Roomain�the . � - � 
Towns and Suburbs," establishing and improving the lodging rental 
'al/stem. Beijing conducted continuous clean-up efforts focused on 
the transient communities, with fairly good social results. � 
,. 
In the Fengtai district of Beijing, there is a population 
of 250,000 outsiders, and in that district communities in excess - 
of .10,000 people have gradually taken shape. At its peak, the outsider 
population.in.the Dahongmen district exceeded 50,000 people. Concerned 
departments in Beijing transferred more than 200 work team members 
and more than .1000 public security.peoplep,s police to.Ponduct 
a comprehensive cleanup effort-in theiDahongmen district, tearing 
' down approximately 10,000 unlawful:sbructurestA17 illegally, constructed 
CompoUndi."�ind-moving more than 18,000 people out.of the district. 
'At the same time, they widened the roads and straightened out the 
traffic situation, thereby improving the chaotic situation in the'. 
district. During the cleanup�effort;'public security agencies stepped. 
up their efforts to crack down on various illegal and criminal activities 
in the district, investigating and prosecuting a variety of peOple 
committing crimes and violating the law,--including theft,. robbety;.:. 
selling and using drugs, and prostitution, breaking more than 14 
criminal cases and confiscating drugs, controlled knives, and pornographic 
video, tapes, etp. . 
During the cleanup campaign, housing and repatriation efforts . 
were strengthened everywhere.. Last year Guangdong launched a campaign 
targeting the "three-withouts" population, namely, those without 
legal credentials, those without fixed. residences, and those without 
proper sources of income, clearing out and repatriating nearly. 60,000 
persons and getting nearly 40,000 individuals to return to their 
home areas voluntarily. Shanghai has created a fledgling housing . 
and repatriation mechanism in which the public security departments 
handle the housing; civil administration departments are responsible 
for managing education, and public security, civil administration, ' 
.the peopleos armed police, the railways, and other departments 
handle escort duties jointly. .- - -- - ..�-
3..With the efforts to manage the transient population taking 
hold, propaganda, education, 'and service work related to the legal 
system for outside workers has been strengthened everywhere.' 
Guangdong Province has made education concerning the legal 
system for outside workers an important mission in its "three-five" 
law familiarization work, launching the "read a book, take a test, . 
and get a certificate" outside worker legal system educational campaign 
throughout the province. Of the eight million outside workers throughout 
the-province,.four million have received education and obtained 
their qualification certificates. Beijing, Tianjin, Gansu, and other 
'places have launched massive propaganda and education campaigns 
in keeping with the effo-,t to promulgate regulations on the management 
of the transient populatLc.i, and have achieved fairly good social

,ults. 
Aced on the guiding ideology that "management is also service," 
Jome places in Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Fujian have constructed a 
large amount of housing for the outsider population, providing a 
full range of services for outside workers. Shanghai has arranged 
personal accidental injury insurance for outside workers, setting . 
up civilian worker schools and opening a variety of training classes, 
service centers, cultural and educational centers, legal advice 
service centers, etc., in some districts, counties; townships', and 
neighborhoods, providing fairly good service to the transient population. 
In 1996, the Communist Youth League Central Committee, the 
Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Libor, the Ministry 
of Construction, the office of the Central Committee for the Comprehensive 
Management of Social Security, and other concerned departments launched 
a joint campaign to, select ."10 outstanding and'100'superior" young 
outside workers. During the first half of this year, along with 
the Ministry of Justice, the State Family Planning Commission, and 
the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the above five 
departments launched.a.joint "one thousand schools and one million . 
students" training campaign for young outside workers in communities 
nationwide. At present, this campaign has already spread throughout. 
the country. . 
Strengthening the education of the children in the transient 
population has also caught the attention of concerned departments. 
There are approximately 20 million children of school age in the 
transient population nationwide, and resolving the school attendance 
'problem of this group of people and helping them to reach healthy 
adulthood is not merely an educational issue, it also has an impact 
on social development and stability. In recent years, the various � 
regions and concerned departments have adopted some effective measures. 
In 1996, the State Education Commission formulated the "School Attendance 
Measures for children of School Age Among the Transient Population," 
setting up pilot projects in Beijing, Tianjin; Shanghai, Bebei, 
Zhejiang, and Guangdong, etc., and-they are already seeing results. 
At present this effort is being promoted nationwide.. 
4. Strengthening the management of the transient population, 
bringing them in and having them leave in a systematic manner, thereby 
turning the "civilian worker flood" into a "long stream" and reducing 
the negative effects of transient civilian workers is one aspect 
of the work. Another aspect and a long-term consideration is to 
shift the labor force from the rural areas to local neighborhoods 
as quickly as possible, developing small urban industries and township 
enterprises to accommodate the surplus rural workforce, etc., which . 
is the only good way to fundamentally solve the problem. 
Workers who leave to do manual labor are also a valuable resource 
to their home towns. "Behind the flood of workers is a flood of 
new businesses." They not only bring back considerable earnings 
to their home towns, in the work that they do they also forge talents, 
so when they return home with money, technology, and management 
experience to set up businesses, it promotes the economic development 
of the region and brings about changes in the rural industrial structure. 
! At present this trend is gradually succeeding. In Sichuan 
.more than 300,000 former manual laborers have returned home to set . 
up shops and factories, absorbing a lot of the surplus rural workforce 
in the local neighborhoods. The Fuyang district in Anhui already 
has more than 700 good-sized enterprises that have been set up by 
returning workers. 
� Furthermore, this is precisely something that the government 
at various levels encourages and guides. Faced with the enormous 
numbers in the transient population and the limited ability of cities 
to absorb them, in addition to strengthening their overall controls, 
governments at various levels are making the development of township 
enterprises, the strengthening of overall agricultural development, 
and the acceleration of the construction of small towns as the primary 
1 path in transforming the rural workforce. Sichuan Province is vigorously 
1 developing township enterprises and has absorbed a total workforce 
1 -of 11.5 million people. Last year, through reforms in the small 
town census registers, there were more than 74,000 people who went 
from agricultural to non-agricultural status.

IMP 
ditionally, Henan Province has been a major exporter of 
rplus labor. Over the past two years, in addition to implementing 
verall controls on such expbrts, they have also accelerated the 
implementation of the "enrich the people" project proposed by the 
provincial committee, shifting the surplus workforce to local 
neighborhoods. 
At present, the overall drain on Henan".6 surplus workforce. 
is gradually diminishing, and township enterprises are beginning 
to flourish in some of the economically underdeveloped counties 
.(cities) in the western part of the province: . 
The ourplus.workforce in Jiangxi Province is some six million. 
plus people. In recent years, the provincial committee and government 
have focused on transferring them and absorbing them in local 
'neighborhoods, 
and through the Comprehensive development of agriculture, the development 
of township enterprises, the acceleration of the construction of 
mall towns, and encouraging those who had left to return home to 
set up enterprise's, they have achieved a declining trend in the 
size of the labor exports throughout the entire province for two 
years in a row.

istics, persisting in the party's basic line and the fun-
damental policies af "seizing opportunities, intensify-
ing reform, opening up wider, promoting development. 
and preserving stability," in an all out effort to improve 
our judicial work. We need to continue to launch cam-
paigns to severely crack down on serious crimes and 
economic offenses, going all out to preserve social sta-
bility. advancing the anticorruption struggle, and more 
forcefully reconciling economic, civil, and administra-
tive relations. We need to speed up our reform. opening, 
economic development, and social advances, emphasiz-

and bringing our judicial functions into full play, to 
make a new contribution in providing forceful judicial 
support and legal service to Sichuan's achievement of
