 Cli?a
 The 4th National People's Congress was held
 last week, almost five years after its
 "imminent convening" was first announced in
 1970. Delayed repeatedly by writngling in the
 leadership, the congress-shorter and less revealing
 than the 3rd a decade ago-met to i atify govern-
 ment appointments and polices hammered out in
 what appear to have been tough party meetings
 over the last several months. Dominated by Pre-
 mier Chou En-lai and his allies, the five-oa;y affair
 (Ja'ruary  13-17) stressed the twin themes of
 moderation and continuity. Its brevity as well as
 the secrecy surrounding it, however, indicate that
 significant differences remain within the Chinese
 leadership.
 For the military, the congress meant new
 cuts in its political clout. Politburo member Yeh
 Chien-ying, a close associate of Chou who can be
 expected to keep a close watch on the army, was
 named minister of defense. The post itself was
 downgraded somewhat by not making the defense
 minister a vice premier. Only one military man
 was among the 12 vice premiers named at the
 congress-there were four officers before the
 Cultural Revolution-and the party plenum that
 preceded the congress stripped another senior
 military figure, the much criticized Li Te-sheng,
 of his party vice chairmanship and his seat on the
 Politburo standing committee. Li's powerful posts
 went to a civilian, Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping,
 Chou's associate and heir apparent.
 The congress restaffed the top levels of the
 civilian bureaucracy. For the first time since the
 Cultural Revolution, each ministry has a publicly
 identified head. Perhaps more importantly, ex-
 pertise apparently was the chief criterion in filling
 Page  1
 the vacancies. The majority of the 15 new min-
 isters are veteran bureaucrats, a number of whom
 were  severely  criticized  during  the Cultural
 Revolution. Only the new minister of culture can
 be considered a "leftist."
 Current moderate economic policies and
 China's expanded trade relations with the West
 were also endorsed by the congress. Trade policy,
 in particular, has been criticized by the leftists.
 Chou's report to the congress indicated that the
 demands of some military men for a bigger piece
 of the economic pie were also rejected.
 Concessions were made to the leftists in two
 areas. The right to practice the "four bigs"-es-
 sentially, permission to criticize leaders in wall
 posters-was written into the new constituticn,
 but was mitigated by the emphasis Chou's report
 placed on unity, discipline, and party control.
 Provincial revolutionary committees, the admin-
 istrative organs of local government, were also
 retained. A child of the Cultural Revolution,
 these committees replaced the older People's
 Councils, which many moderates would probably
 prefer to see reconstituted. Once a hotbed of
 leftist sentiment, the revolutionary committees
 have cooled considerably since they were formed
 and, in any case, the real power rests with the
 provincial party committees, where moderates
 generally rule.
 Vice premiers Teng Hsiao?ping and Chang
 Chun-chiao were the big winners at the congress.
 Teng, who was made a party vice chairman and
 member of the Politburo standing committee at
 the plenum before the congress, emerged as the
 ranking vice premier. Teng appears to be the
 logical choice to replace Chou once he passes
 from the scene. Chang, who may be the de facto

 tionary line in foreign affairs"-a formulation
 used to describe Mao's backing for China's open-
 ing to the Wes. and for continued hostility to
 Moscow.
 The principal losers seem to be the leftists,
 especially Mao's wife, Chiang Ching, Shanghai
 propagandist Yao Wen-yuan, and Wang Hung-
 wen, the youthful party vice chairman who
 soared to the number three spot behind Mao and
 Chou at the 10th Party Congress in August 1973.
 None received a government post.
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung,  who attended
 neither the plenum nor the congress, has now
 been away from Peking for over six months. Only
 once before has Mao been absent from the capital
 for a longer time, and that was immediately
 before the onset of the Cultural Revolution when,
 Mao complained later, he was being circumvented
 and ignored b  political opponents ~ j
 If Mao has remained in the countryside as a
 political gesture, it is likely that he is "sulking in
 his tent" and has not been deliberately excluded
 from the capital. The communique issued at the
 conclusion of the congress makes relatively little
 mention of Mao personally. The guiding role of
 "Mao Tse-tung Thought," however, was written
 into the new constitution, and the chairman of
 the party was designated commander of the
 armed forces. A!I of this suggests that the Chair-
 man is still a very active force in Chinese politics.
 Foreign Policy
 In his report to the congress, Chou En-lai
 reaffirmed  in clear terms established Chinese
 policy lines and themes. He said that China
 should continue to implement Mao's "revolu-
 Chou gav: a positive assessment of China's
 relations with the US. He said relations have im-
 proved "to srnne extent" despite the continued
 existence of i`undamental differences. This was

 ing that, in Peking's view, Sino-US relations have
 remained E:! sentially on track during the inter-
 vening  1,7 months. He seemed to  minimize
 Taiwan as ;i serious source of irritation. He men-
 tioned Taiwan only in passing and separately
 from his remarks on the US.
 Chou came down hard on Moscow. He re-
 peated Peking's conditions for a border settle-
 ment- anu for the establishment of normal state
 relations contained in China's message to the
 USSR last November, which Moscow has twice
 rejected at the highest level. Chou once again
 accused Moscow of violating an understanding he
 said he reached with Kosygin in September 1969
 that these conditions form the basis of a Sino-
 Soviet agreement. He also denigrated Soviet pro-
 posals for a settlement, charging that Moscow had
 done nothing to prevent border skirmishing along
 the frontier. Although the Premier said China was
 interested in improving state relations, he held
 little hope for a reconciliation on the party level,
 noting that the Sino-Soviet ideological debate will
 continue for "a long time."
 Chou repeated a propaganda theme that has
 received a good deal of attention lately-that
 intense  US-USSR competition, focused  on
 Europe, will lead to a world war-but he made it
 clear that the Chinese remain primarily concerned
 about a Soviet threat to China. Chou also devoted
 a goad deal of attention to the Third World, but
 he gave nearly equal attention to the "Second
 World" developed countries of some stature but
 lacking the power of the US and USSR.(

 ,Moscow Reaffirm Deteflte
 Moscow continues to offer public and pri-
 vate assurances that collapse of the US-Soviet
 trade agreement does not  signal it turn from
 detente. At the same time, Soviet criticism of the
 US, particularly in the media, is becoming increas-
 ingly truculent.
 The Soviets may have enlisted their allies in
 the effort to reassure the US on detente. On
 January 18, a Polish Central Committee member
 sought out a US official to rebut as "nonsense"
 Western speculation about a return to the Cold
 War. He said that neither the Soviets nor the Poles
 want to turn back from detente. In addition,
 Soviet UN delegates have recently approached
 their British and West German counterparts to
 assess the reaction to Moscow's renunciation of
 the trade agreemen
 The Soviet central press continues to affirm
 Moscow's commitment to detente and to give
 heavy coverage to recent public statements by
 President  Ford and  Secretary Kissinger that
 detente with the Soviet Union will be continued
 and strengthened. The press has also resumed
 frequent and positive coverage of the Vladivostok
 arms-control understandings in an evident effort
 to offset the "step backwards" in trade relations.
 Moscow's evident interest in preserving and
 extending the gains of its policy of improved
 relations with the US has not, however, kept it
 from reacting sharply to a number of irritants.
 Despite prompt US apologies for a shooting inci-
 dent at the Ukrainian UN mission last weekend,
 for example, the official Soviet protest delivered
 on January 22 was extremely sharp. The note,
 which was broadcast in its entirety to the domes-
 tic Soviet audience, said that unfulfilled US assur-
 ances and promises of prc-'entive action consti-
 tute "virtual connivance With criminal elements"
 by US authorities. Such acts, the note warned,
 "cannot fail to do damage to relations."
 The level of critical coverage of the US re-
 mains at the unusually high levels of the past
 month. The Soviets are concentrating their propa-
 ganda on US domestic economic problems, Wash-
 ington's policy in the Middle East, alleged abuses
 by the US intelligence community, and continued
 American support of South Vietnam.
 25X6 Meanwhile, Brezhnev's absence from view-it
 is now a month since his last public appearance-
 has fed the growing number of rumors about his
 physical and political health.
 In the face of these rumors and speculations,
 however, there is no evidence of concern on the
 part of other Soviet leaders. Prime Minister Kosy-
 gin, for example, is still on vacation in the Cauca-
 sus. Moscow party boss Grishin made a trip to
 Warsaw to take part in celebrations marking its
 liberation during World War II, and Defense Min-
 ister Grechko visited Soviet forces in East Ger-
 many and Poland. Trade union chief Shelepin,
 Secretary for Agriculture Kulakov, and Minister
 of Agriculture Polyansky took part in previously
 scheduled routine conferences in the capital, and
 press reporting indicates that republic-based mem-
 bers of the Politburo are also following their usual
 routine.                              25X1

 Eastern Europe
 REACTION TO US TRADE BILL
 East Europeans have generally followed the
 Soviet lead in blaming "anti-detente forces" in
 Washington for restrictions in the 1974 trade bill
 that caused Moscow to renounce the 1972 US-
 USSR trade agreement. The Kremlin's more loyal
 allies call it a temporary setback, however, and
 they point to the strategic arms limitation talks,
 the conference on European security, and imple-
 mentation of bilateral agreements as evidence that
 detente is a continuing process. Despite this up-
 beat note, some differences  in national ap-
 proaches hr-e emerged.
 Reaction by Albania, Poland, Yugoslavia,
 and  Romania reflects the particular national
 circumstances of each.  .
 Albania factually reported Secretary Kis-
 singer's announcement of the Soviet decision, and
 then predictably condemned  the  "revisionist
 rulers" in the Kremlin for their willingness "to
 sell thousands and tens of thousands of their
 citizens for US credits and goods." By contrast,
 Polish media have barely noted the Soviet re-
 jection of the trade agreement. Warsaw's cov-
 erage-the most favorable to the US in Eastern
 Europe-has stressed the positive, including Secre-
 tary Kissinger's statement that the administration
 wil I urge Congress to reconsider the trade bill.
 Bucharest's failure to give even factual cov-
 erage suggests it is having difficulty finding a safe
 middle ground. The Romanians are now deeply
 involved in negotiating new trade agreements with
 both the US and the USSR.
 The Yugoslavs were slow to  comment,
 perhaps because Moscow's action immediately
 preceded announcements in Belgrade and Wash-
 ington that President  Ford has accepted an
 invitation to visit Yugoslavia. Influential news-
 papers in Belgrade have recently stated that any
 other decision by Moscow would have meant
 capitulation. Yugoslav journalists have, however,
 carefully placed the blame on "those quarters" in
 Washington that have blocked moves by the US
 administration to expand economic cooperation
 with  Moscow and the Communist countries.

 US-USSR: LITTLE CHANGE IN TRADE
 Moscow's abrogation of the 1972 US-Soviet
 trade agreement will have little immediate impact
 on trade and technological transer. Over the long
 term, US-Soviet economic relations will depend
 on overall progress in detente and on the extent
 to which recent US legislative restrictions are
 modified.
 Under the 1972 agreement, Moscow ex-
 pected to get Most Favored Nation treatment and
 official US encouragement for the expansion of
 trade. The Trade Act of 1974, and the amend-
 ments to the Export-Import Bank Act, offered
 only conditional Most Favored Nation status, lim-
 ited Eximbank credits to $300 million over four
 years, and seemed to close the door on US par-
 ticipation in the large Siberian and Far E,-.-ern
 energy projects. Most seriously, the lei kslation
 made Most Favored Nation status and US gov,!!rn-
 ment credits subject to conditions that the USSR
 would not publicly accept.
 Soviet rejection or the agreement should not
 substantially affect the volume of US-Soviet trade
 this year. US exports are expected to be above
 the 1974 level of $600 to $700 million because of
 deliveries of capital goods ordered by the USSR
 in 1972 and 1973 when    Eximbank credits
 were available.
 The new restrictions on Eximbank credits
 are likely to result in a lower volume of orders for
 US equipment. Major US banks have indicated
 that they would continue to lend to the USSR,
 but new loans will be more costly to Moscow
 without the lower interest rates and longer credit
 periods previously available with Eximbank par-
 ticipation. Furthermore, US law  limits the
 amount of credit that banks can advance to any
 single borrower, so that consortium loans might
 be necessary. US private credit facilities will prob-
 ably be discussed when the chairman of the So-
 viet Foreign Trade Bank meets with US bankers
 later this month or early next.
 Eurodollar  funds-now reportedly  under-
 utilized-could also be used to finance imports
 from the US. In any case, the higher cost of
 financing US purchases will put US firms at a 25X1

 the project. Negotiations for the aluminum com-
 plex project, involving $1.4 billion in Western
 equipment, should not be seriously affected, since
 Kaiser had made tentative plans for financing the
 project without Eximbank. The Sakhalin Island
 oil exploration project, largely a Soviet-Japanese
 deal, will not be affected at this time because US
 participation does not include substantial capital
 involvement in the initial stages.
 The two gas projects-Yakutsk and North
 Star-will be hurt, but only the Yakutsk deal
 should prove to be a real disappointment to the
 Soviets. Most of the requirements for develop-
 ment projects can be met from non-US sources.
 Oil drilling and pipeline equipment and tech-
 nology are notable exceptions.
 Before 1972 and the availability of Exim-
 bank credits, Soviet purchases in the US were
 restricted to high-priority equipment not available
 elsewhere. US firms that can channel production
 to overseas subsidiaries to take advantage of sub-
 sidized credits available abroad would presumably
 be least affected.
 Moscow would prefer not to let economic
 relations with the US deteriorate and is probably
 looking for ways to remove the impediments to
 further growth of US-Soviet trade. In the mean-
 time, the Soviets will :ink their cutbacks in orders
 to the US restrictions, and will hope thereby to
 pressure American businessmen  and political
 leaders to seek modification of the 1974 trade
 bill. Tass has already begun to quote US busi-
 nessmen in Moscow who are said to sympathize
 with the Soviet attitude toward the restric-
 tions.

 SECURITY CONFERENCES RESUME
 The Conference on Security and Coopera-
 tion in Europe reconvened in Geneva on January
 20. The force reduction negotiations will resume
 next week in Vienna. Some observers have specu-
 lated that the delegates in Geneva will be able to
 complete their work by this spring. Whether they
 can accomplish this, however, will depend on
 whether East and West offer concessions that
 they have been reluctant to make so far. In Vi-
 enna, the two sides are deadlocked; the prospects
 that they will be able to resolve their differences
 on basic issues during this negotiating round ap-
 pear dim.
 In Geneva, the delegates from 35 states
 must:
 ? finish drafting texts spelling out the
 principles that govern international relations;
 ? adopt  some form of  "confidence-
 building measures" designed to make certain
 types of military activities appear less threat-
 ening;
 ? finish their discussion of the relatively
 uncontroversial subject of economic coopera-
 tion;
 practical measures to improve confidence and to
 facilitate East-West contacts. At the same time,
 some Europeans have shown some concern that
 Moscow's recent action on the US-Soviet trade
 accord might presage a lessened Soviet interest in
 detente.
 The security conference, however, is both a
 product and a symbol of detente, and both East
 and West will probably attempt to conclude the
 negotiations during this round of talks. Moscow
 probably believes that the gains it has already
 obtained-such as recognition of the existing bor-
 ders in Europe-and the prospect of obtaining
 language that will provide it with a rationale for
 reneging on any concessions regarding the freer
 movement of people and ideas, will enable the
 Soviets to make minor concessions to move the
 negotiations to a conclusion.
 In Vienna, after more than a year of negoti-
 ating, the two sides remain far apart on resolving
 the basic issues of which states should reduce
 their forces, when, and what type of forces
 should be reduced. Unless one side or the other
 changes its negotiating position, little progress is
 likely to be made during the coming round of
 talks.
 ? resolve the most sensitive issue: what
 type of practical measures should be adopted
 to facilitate the "freer movement of people
 and ideas" between East and West.
 In addition, the conferees will have to deter-
 mine what type of follow-up arrangements should
 be established once the conference itself ends.
 Several recent commentaries in the Soviet press
 suggest that Moscow will press to conclude the
 negotiations early so the summit-level meeting
 that the Soviets want to cap the conference can
 take place this summer.
 Many of the West European and neutral par-
 ticipants speculated earlier that the negotiating
 phase could end this spring. Recent discussions
 among the EC Nine suggest, however, that some
 of the major West European participants, particu-
 larly the West Germans, will be reluctant to force
 the pace of the talks or to drop their demands for
 For the Western allies, a matter of immedi-
 ate concern will be to reply definitively to a
 Soviet proposal made last November that the par-
 ticipants freeze the level of men in their armed
 forces for the duration of the negotiations. All
 the Western allies agree that the Soviet proposal is
 unacceptable, but several of them wish to make a
 counterproposal that could have the effect of
 changing the topic of the negotiations from force
 reductions to a freeze. The Allies will continue
 their discussion of how to reply on January 23.
 The Soviets, who appear to be under no time
 pressure in the force reduction talks, will prob-
 ably attempt to seize the initiative again during
 this  round. They may further modify  the
 "symbolic reduction proposal" they offered last
 October by suggesting that only ground forces be
 reduced during an initial stage of reductions

 PORTUGAL: CONTROVERSIAL LABOR LAW
 The Portuguese cabinet this week narrowly
 approved  Communist-backed  labor  legislation
 bor
 that  rovides for a sin le LlaonthddtIt
 ionLa ~~The milbe
 en under consideration for more than six
 months and appears to have caused divisions
 within the ruling Armed Forces Movement as well
 as in the government's three-party coalition.
 The Communists view the law as a way of
 improving their prc,ent domination of labor or-
 ganizations. Control of labor would ensure con-
 tinued Communist influence in Portuguese poli-
 tics, even if the party should fail to do well in the
 election. The other two parties in the coalition,
 the Socialists and the center-left Popular Demo-
 crats, are anxious to prevent the spread of Com-
 munist influence and have threatened to leave the
 coalition over the labor law issue.
 Passage of the law was in doubt until the
 Armed Forces Movement publicly endorsed it.
 Reports circulating in Lisbon indicate that the
 Movement was not as united on this issue as its
 press releases suggested and that approval was
 pushed through by a minority of more radical
 officers. According to US embassy sources, the
 Movement's 200-member assembly failed to reach
 agreement after an unruly session. At this point,
 leftist-oriented officers suggested that the deci-
 sion be left to the Superior Council, where they
 believed  the  chances  for approval  would  be
 greater. The vote in the Superior Council was
 reported to have been 11 to 9 in favor of the bill.
 The moderates within the Mover,2ent may
 have become sensitive to the implied alliance be-
 tween themselves and the Communists on this
 issue. Possibly to dispel this notion, the Superior
 Council issued a communique last weekend restate
 ing its determination to hold elections on sched-
 ule. The Communists have come out in favor of
 postponing elections and have been searching for
 ways of blocking them.
 Press coverage of the dispute has cast consid-
 erable doubt on Communist claims that the law
 had solid labor backing. Several unions have ex-
 pressed their displeasure with the legislation and
 the Catholic Church, which has kept silent on
 political matters since April, issued a communi-
 que favoring trade union liberty.
 Socialist leaders will meet this weekend to
 decide whether the party should stay in the gov-
 ernment. Party leader and Foreign Minister Mario
 Soares is opposed to withdrawal although he is
 under considerable pressure within the party to
 do so. Soares says that changes have been made in
 the final draft of the labor law that will enable
 the Socialists to operate freely, despite Commu-
 nist control of the superstructure. There are also
 reports of dissension within the Popular Demo-
 cratic Party over its future plans, but the party
 will attempt at all costs to avoid a public split
 before the constituent assembl   elec i  s in
 April.                              25X1

 UK: WILSON COMES TO !NASHINGTON
 Prime Minister Wilson and two cabinet min-
 isters, Foreign Secretary Callaghan and Chancellor
 of the Duchy of Lancaster Lever, will be in Wash-
 ington late next week for meetings with top-level
 US officials. The discussions will probably focus
 on the state of the world economy, oil-related
 problems, and on such matters as the Middle East
 and Cyprus. The leaders will probably also talk
 about Wilson's trip to Moscow, scheduled for
 mid-February.
 After a slow start, Callaghani hay been a
 fairly effective foreign secretary At first, he de-
 voted most of his energies to the EC ren9gotia-
 tions, but in recent months he has been involved
 in all sorts of foreign policy questions, inciuding
 Cyprus and the intractable Rhodesia problem.
 Because of his keen interest in and close involve-
 ment with Cyprus last summer, Callaghan most
 certainly will want to discuss this issue, including
 the British role, during his talks here.
 Lever is a cabinet official but serves pri-
 marily as economic adviser to Wilson. Probably
 the most moderate of the members of the cabi-
 net, he seems to function best in situations where
 orthodoxy and respectability are in order. He is
 considered knowledgeable in industry and finance
 and has  had considerable experience in the
 Treasury, the City of London, and other financial
 centers of Europe. One of his current roles is to
 meet with international oil  company  repre-
 sentatives engaged in the exploration of North
 Sea oil; they are highly skeptical and fearful
 about some of the Labor government's proposals
 for taxation and participation in the North Sea
 projects.
 The Labor government has made good rela-
 tions with the US a keystone of its foreign policy,
 and this is likely to continue as long as US posi-
 tions are not harmful to British interests. The
 most likely areas of conflict are oil-related issues
 and the Middle East. Britain's current-account
 deficit last year of nearly $8 billion can largely be
 explained by rising oil prices. Until North Sea oil
 makes Britain self-sufficient, the UK brill want to
 maintain good relations with the Arabs to assure a
 continuing supply of oil as well as markets for
 British  oods.

 CYPRUS: VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS
 The British government's decision last week
 to perm?t Turkish Cypriot refugees on its air base
 at Akrotiri to be airlifted to Turkey sparked
 demonstrations by angry Greek Cypriots that
 cat',ed extensive damage to British and US diplo-
 matic offices in Nicosia. The demonstrations have
 subsided, but Greek Cypriot resentment remains
 high because the refugees are to be resettled on
 former Greek Cypriot properties in the Turkish-
 controlled northern sector of the island.
 The demonstrations took a violent turn on
 January 17 as British officials were making prep-
 arations for the airlift of the 8-9,000 refugees. A
 group of demonstrators clashed with British
 security personnel at the edge of the base, result-
 ing in injuries on both sides and the death of a
 Greek Cypriot youth. The anti-British demon-
 strations, stirred by extreme leftist members of
 Vassos Lyssarides' party, soon took on anti-
 American overtones as well. Part of the US em-
 bassy as well as sections of the British consulate
 and the British Council building were ransacked
 and burned on January 18.
 The government, which had vehemently
 protested the evacuation of the refugees, did little
 to stop the demonstrators. Greek Cypriot police
 and National Guardsmen stood by and watched as
 the US embassy was assaulted. A strong demarche
 from the US government following the attack
 apparently prompted Greek Cypriot authorities
 to provide better protection. An attack against
 the USIS library on January 20 was beaten back
 by strong security measures, and the crowds were
 calmed by the arrival on the scene of President
 Makarios. The library suffered only slight damage
 and was not entered. US embassy officials re-
 ceived assurances that the government was deter-
 mined to prevent another assault against US in-
 stallations and that, if need be, Makarios would
 again appear to disperse demonstrators.
 In the meantime, the evacuation of the refu-
 gees, which is taking place on Turkish aircraft ar'd
 will be completed next week, continues unim-
 peded. Prior to its decision to allow the evacua-
 tion, the British government had taken the posi-
 tion that their fate was a political question to be
 Demonstrations against UK
 settled in the course of the intercommunal talks.
 Under severe pressure from the Turkish govern-
 ment, however, Whitehall reversed its position
 and permitted the .-efugees to leave. Ankara had
 insisted that the question was purely a humani-
 tarian one between itself and London since the
 refugees were on sovereign British territory.
 Greek and Greek Cypriot officials charged
 the British with betrayal and wit'i undercutting
 their bargaining position in the intercommunal
 talks, which last week turned for the first time to
 substantive political questions. They dismissed as
 specious the British contention that the Turkish
 side will now be under pressure to reciprocate on
 the humanitarian concerns of Greek Cypriots.
 While Turkish Cypriot negotiator Denktash
 hinted prior to the session on January 17 that
 some gesture might be forthcoming from the
 Turkish side, he apparently did not make any
 concrete proposals during the session or at his
 subsequent meeting with Greek Cypriot negotia-
 tor Clerides on January 20. Instead, the two men
 focused on the reopening of Nicosia airport. Their
 positions on that subject have been described as
 far apart.

 In Egypt...
 As expectations rise in Cairo over prospects
 for a second-stage Israeli withdrawal in the Sinai
 Peninsula, Egypt is coming in for renewed criti-
 cism from other Arab capitals for its willingness
 to satisfy its own negotiating demands without
 waiting for similar progress on the other Arab
 fronts. President Saadat has taken to the air with
 a series of interviews designed both to fend off
 this Arab criticism and to remind the Israelis that
 a Sinai withdrawal will not bring an end to Arab
 demands for the return of territory.
 The Cairo press has reflected a high degree
 of optimism that Israeli Foreign Minister Allon's
 discussions in Washington last week would result
 in a withdrawal proposal acceptable to Egypt.
 The simultaneous visit to Washington by US
 Ambassador Eilts was taken as an indication that
 serious negotiations were in prospect. Despite
 Egyptian government attempts to lone the media
 down lest public expectations be raised too high,
 the press has continued its optimistic tack.
 Ambassador Eilts' midweek return to Cairo was
 eagerly anticipated, and newspapers are predicting
 a swing through the area by Secretary Kissinger in
 early February.
 Egypt's undisguised hope for negotiating
 progress has brought heavy criticism from other
 Arabs, led by the Palestinians, who accuse the
 Egyptians of again moving ahead of the other
 belligerents in negotiations. Palestinian- and Iraqi-
 backed papers in Beirut have picked up a month-
 old Tel Aviv news report indicating that Israel had
 asked for an Egyptian commitment to a 12-year
 suspension of belligerency in return for a pullback
 in the Sinai. Commentators writing for these
 papers are attacking Egypt for allegedly acqui-
 escing in this demand.
 The criticism has brought a counterattack
 from the Cairo press, as well as the series of
 interviews by President Sadat intended to deflect
 the anti-Egyptian propaganda and reaffirm
 Egypt's continued solidarity with the Arab cause.
 Later in the week, Sadat told a Beirut news-
 paper interviewer that he would not "accept any-
 thing short of Israeli movement on the three
 fronts within three months"-again an apparent
 reference to the expiration of the UN mandate in
 the Sinai. Although the remark has been widely
 mistranslated as a demand for "withdrawal"
 rather than merely "movement," Sadat probably
 intended to be deliberately ambiguous about
 whether he was demanding an actual Israeli pull-
 back on the other fronts by April or was only
 speaking of diplomatic action.
 In any event, Sadat's statements are serving
 to reassure the other Arabs-and to warn the
 Israelis-that a Sinai withdrawal would not con-
 stitute a final Egyptian-Israeli settlement. Sadat is
 also reminding both parties that he will turn his
 efforts to gaining progress on other fronts when
 and if a Sinai agreement is concluded.
 ...And in Israel
 At the conclusion of his discussions with
 President Ford and Secretary Kissinger, Foreign
 Minister Allon was optimistic that progress was
 being made toward a resumption of talk-- with
 Egypt. Allon's optimism, however, was not en-
 tirely shared by the Israeli press, which expressed
 concern about Cairo's apparent silence on what it
 is prepared to offer in return for another Israeli
 withdrawal in the Sinai.

 King  Faysal's trip to Syria, Jordan, and
 Egypt last week resulted in now outlays of cash
 by the Saudi ruler, but apparently no significant
 now political developments. The final communi-
 ques were fairly predictable in content and tone.
 Faysal's visit to Damascus, symbolic of the
 improved  relations between the conservative
 Saudis and the Syrians, was a qualified success for
 both parties. President Asad took steps to ensure
 Faysal a rousing welcome and to play down the
 Damascus regime's Baathist origins. The final
 communique announced the Saudis' intention to
 provide Syria with $150 million for "urgent
 necessities" and $200 million for economic de-
 velopment projects. The $200 million was re-
 portedly a loan.

 Like the Syrians, the Jordanians made an
 effort to ingratiate themselves with Faysal; large
 crowds were on the streets of Amman, and
 Husayn uncharacteristically wore either military
 uniforms or traditional garb. Faysal's visit re-
 sulted in a Saudi grant to Jordan-in addition to
 funds provided in the Khartoum and Rabat agree-
 ments-of $57 million. Most of this-$47 mil-
 lion-is intended to cover the Jordanian budget
 deficit and to pay for development and construc-
 tion projects in the Jordan Valley and along the
 Saudi-Jordanian border. The other $10 million
 was designated for military officers' housing ~
 The Amman communique reiterated con-
 ventional  Arab criticism of Israeli settlement
 activities in occupied territories, and specifically
 condemned Tel Aviv's apparent determination to
 proceed with construction projects in Jerusalem.
 The communique also contained-probably at
 Saudi insistence-a reaffirmation by the two sides
 of support for the Palestine Liberation Organiza-
 tion and the "legitimate rights of Palestinians."
 On the surface at least, Faysal's visit to
 Egypt would seem to have been a sharp dis-
 appointment to the Egyptians. In contrast to the
 aid given Damascus and Amman, Cairo was the
 recipient of only $100 million-described as
 intended to ensure Egypt's "supplies of essential
 goods." Even the announcement of this grant was
 not included in the "press statement" released
 after Faysal's departure from Aswan, but was left
 to Egyptian Prime Minister Hijazi.
 The Saudis have already given substantial
 amounts of direct cash aid and project assistance
 to Cairo. The Egyptian stop was, in any case, only
 a last-minute addition to Faysal's itinerary, and
 aid was probably not intended to be high on the
 agenda.  Nevertheless, the Egyptians will un-
 doubtedly be chagrined that they came out be-
 hind Syria and only slightly ahead of Jordan in
 NORTH YEMEN: PRIME MINISTER OUS i ED
 The head of the ruling command council,
 Colonel Ibrahim al-Hamdi, last week abruptly dis-
 missed Prime Minister Muhsin al-Ayni. On Janu-
 ary 23, Hamdi asked Abd al-Aziz Abd al-Ghani, a
 young economist with no political following, to
 form a new cabinet.
 Hamdi had been under pressure for several
 months from powerful conservative Yemeni tribal
 sheikhs-and probably from some Saudi Arabian
 officials as well-to dismiss al-Ayni, who, his
 enemies claim, has connections with the leftist
 Baath Party of Iraq. The ostensible reason for the
 dismissal of al-Ayni was his failure to institute
 domestic reforms promised by the military when
 they took power in June 1974.
 The removal of al-Ayni followed the return
 to Sana earlier this month-aboard a Saudi plane-
 of Hasan al-Amri, a conservative former prime
 minister and military officer. AI-Amri had been in
 exile in Cairo since he was removed as premier
 and banished from North Yemen in August 1971.
 There is widespread speculation in Sana that he
 will eventually be named to North Yemen's three-
 member executive body, the Republican Council,
 which is expected to be re-established in the next
 few months.
 25X1
 Hamdi, a moderate who led the military
 take-over last June,
 e countrys strong man by virtue of his role as
 armed forces commander in chief. By choosing
 Abd al-Ghani to try to form a new cabinet,
 Hamdi was evidently trying to avoid giving the
 post to a potential rival, while maintaining a mid-
 dle-of-the-road posture in North Yemeni politics.
 Rightist forces, such as tribal sheikhs and
 religious leaders, wanted al-Amri or some other
 conservative to head the cabinet. Hamdi resisted
 their efforts in part to avoid the charge that he is
 bringing North Yemen openly into the Saudi or-
 bit. Abd al-Ghani will probably be acceptable to
 leftists in the government and armed forces who
 have been unhappy with the removal of al-Ayni.
 Three North  Yemeni  cabinet members with
 Baathist views resigned last weekend to protest
 al-Ayni's dismissal

 ZAIRE: NATIONALIZATION MEASURES
 President Mobutu seems determined to bring
 sweeping economic and social changes to Zaire in
 1975. He began the year by decreeing a series of
 measures designed to tighten government control
 over the economy and to make a number of
 Zaire's social institutions more responsive to na-
 tional needs. Under the measures, the government
 will take over all large production, distribution,
 construction, and transportation firms. Mobutu
 will appoint special "delegates" to manage the
 facilities, which apparently will be grouped under
 "national commissions" that will oversee various
 sectors of the economy.
 The take-overs are the second stage of a
 program introduced early in 1974 when the gov-
 ernment  nationalized all large non-industrial
 enterprises as well as petroleum storage and distri-
 bution facilities. Unlike action last year, which
 applied only to foreign-owned enterprises, the
 new moves include Zairian-owned businesses. In
 addition, government and party officials must
 turn over to the state all of their properties in
 Zaire and abroad, as well as all foreign bank
 accounts. Moreover, they will no longer be as-
 signed to manage previously nationalized busi-
 nesses although they will be allowed to engage in
 agriculture, the weakest sector of the economy.
 To avoid discouraging badly needed foreign
 investment, all foreign firms established under the
 Investment Code of 1969-which grants generous
 incentives to large-scale investors--are exempt
 from take-over. The majority of US firms in Zaire
 have been set up under the code. Foreign-owned
 petroleum and copper exploration and produc-
 tion facilities are also exempt. Although Zaire
 nationalized the copper industry in 1967, it has
 granted a number of concessions to small private
 firms on a 50-percent equity basis.
 Mobutu apparently believes the new mea-
 sures are necessary to reduce Zaire's serious infla-
 tion and unemployment as well as to curb corrup-
 tion and conflict of interest among government
 officials. Some measures, such as repatriation of
 foreign assets and restrictions on luxury imports
 and items that compete with Zairian goods, seem
 designed to improve the government's shaky for-
 eign exchange position, partly the result of infla-
 tion and low copper prices.
 In other moves, Mobutu ordered the army to
 revise its priorities. Agriculture, political educa-
 tion, and military training are to be emphasized-
 in that order. The educational system is also to be
 revamped. Although details are still unresolved,
 immediate moves include one year of compulsory
 civic service for all secondary school graduates,
 and the introduction of "courses in civics and
 politics" in place of religious training.
 It will probably be some time before the
 government can implement the new measures,
 many of which are vague or ambiguous at best. In
 the meantime, the commercial sector will prob-
 ably suffer some disruptions, although so far
 Mobutu has apparently met little resistance to his
 measures. Businessmen have adopted a wait-and-
 see attitude, and officials are making strong
 public gestures of support while probably hoping
 in private that they will not have to enforce the
 new measures. The military appears resigned to its
 new role, but does not have the equipment or
 logistic system to operate effectively. Students
 are unlikely to jeopardize their colle a educations
 by rebelling a ainst civic service.

 At midweek, a small and heavily escorted

 The arrival of the convoy will boost morale
 in Phnom Penh. Rice and fuel are now being
 rationed to civilians in the capital and the city
 continues to be hit by sporadic rocket attacks.
 Over 150 civilians have died since the attacks
 began on New Year's Day; the heavy casualties
 are partly the result of an influx of refugees from
 outlying areas into the city proper. Communist
 gunners this week also got the range of Pochen-
 tong airport, just west of the capital, destroying
 one aircraft and damaging another. The airport
 remains open, however, and increased deliveries
 of military equipment continue.
 Ground action along the capital's northwest-
 ern defenses picked up gate in the week following
 a period of relative quiet. The Cambodian army's
 battered 7th Division is bearing the brunt of the
 fresh attacks. Insurgent mortar crews have again
 moved within range of the military fuel depot on
 Route 5, and the navy headquarters near the city
 has been the target of some shellings. Seesaw
 battles also continue for several riverside and is-
 land positions north and east of Phnom Penh.
 Since widespread fighting began on January
 1, total casualties from both sides have averaged
 about 1,000 a day-the heaviest of the war F_

 The Communists' military campaign is now
 in its seventh week. So far, the fighting has bean
 moderately heavy in the southern half of the
 country, and there are signs that it will soon
 spread to other areas. Communist forces have
 already made some territorial gains, arid they will
 probably take additional ground before govern-
 ment troops can stop them.
 Combat has increased in the delta, but has
 tapered off north of Saigon, suggesting some
 Communist units are taking a brief respite to
 consolidate their gains and to refit. There are
 clear signs that the North Vietnamese will soon
 resume their attacks north of the capital, and a
 Communist buildup in the central part of the
 country points to new fighting in that area.
 North Vietnamese troops have captured all
 of Phuoc Long Province, a district capital in Binh
 Tuy Province, and an important mountain top in
 Tay Ninh Province. Communist inroads in the
 delta include seizing a district capital in Chuong
 Thien Province, overrunning numerous outposts,
 and expanding their infiltration corridors and
 base areas.
 losses. The Communists should, however, be able
 to replace most of their losses f,.irly quickly.
 They had few reserves on hand at the start of the
 current campaign, but additional troops are now
 arriving from North Vietnam.
 Next Round of Fighting
 In the delta, the second phase of the North
 Vietnamese winter campaign has already begun.
 The heaviest new fighting has occurred in the
 southern provinces of Chuon Thien, Kien G iang,
 and Bac Lieu.
 Uneven Match-ups
 Most Communist gains have been in remote,
 sparsely populated areas defended by South Viet-
 namese local forces. Except for a few instances in
 the delta, these troops have generally fought well
 against Communist main force units. The match-
 up in forces has favored the Communists, how-
 ever, and the outcome of most battles was seldom
 in doubt. In the struggle for the provincial capital
 of Phuoc Long, for example, the Communists
 committed parts of two divisions, togetreer  with
 armor, artillery, and air defense units to over-
 power a South Vietnamese force of less than a
 regiment. Even so, it took the North Vietnamese
 nearly a week to capture the capital.
 Both sides have suffered fairly heavy casual-
 ties in the recent fighting, but the South Vietnam-
 ese appear to have been hurt less than the Com-
 munists. Most government losses were suffered by
 the regional forces, while the Communists' main
 forces have borne the brunt of enemy combat

 In the central highlands, the Communists
 have begun shifting combat units, which points to
 a step-up in combat. The North Vietnamese
 968th Division is apparently moving into the
 highlands from southern Laos, and some of its
 troops have already arrived in western Pleiku
 Province. In addition, existing combat units in the
 province show signs of stirring. Several units from
 the Communist 320th Division have recently
 moved closer to South  Vietnamese positions

 along the western frontiers of the country. The
 government positions are defended by small, iso-
 lated garrisons that would be difficult to resupply
 and reinforce if they came under siege. The Com-
 munists, on the other hand, have large combat
 forces that they can concentrate against these
 positions. Moreover, the North Vietnamese have
 expanded their network of roads, have built large
 base areas, and have moved in large quantities of
 war materiel.
 The South Vietnamese have begun wide-
 spread military operations to disrupt the Commu-
 nists and blunt their offensive. Several of the
 government's efforts have already achieved some
 success. In the northern delta, for example, the
 South Vietnamese have sent a division into action

 against the infiltrating Communist 5th Division,
 blocking it from moving deeper into the region.
 In addition, government troops have carried out
 operations  against Communist  units,  supply
 routes, and staging bases throughout the delta,
 and these have caused heavy enemy losses.
 The government also has taken the initiative
 closer to Saigon. South Vietnamese forces have
 pushed the Communists out of several villages
 near Tay Ninh City, and they have used artillery
 and air strikes to bombard enemy positions on Ba
 Den Mountain. In Binh Tuy Province, government
 troops have broken the siege of one district town,
 and they have begun a drive to retake another lost
 to the enemy early last month.

 Thailand will go to the polls on January 26
 to elect a parliament and, indirectly, a govern-
 ment. The election concludes a frequently tumul-
 tuous 15-month-long transition from military to
 parliamentary rule. Even though the Thai people
 will have a direct hand for the first time in deter-
 mining the make-up of their central government,
 voter interest is not high. This is due in part to a
 lack of campaign issues. Political attacks against
 the government and its political party, which have
 often enlivened previous campaigns, are missing
 th,, time. The care`akor government of Sanya
 Thammasak has no interest in perpetuating itself
 and is eager to step down following the election.
 In addition, many Thai, especially in rural areas,
 are skeptical that representative government can
 work in Thailand's hierarchical society and be-
 lieve that the army generals will be back iii power
 within a year.
 Although the voting will take place over the
 weekend, it will probably be a week or so before
 the results are known and a government can be
 formed. Complicating the process---aside from the
 fact that the Thai have no experience in the
 workings of parliamentary government-is the
 likelihood that no single party will gain an abso-
 lute majority.
 Some 2,000 candidates representing 42 po-
 litical parties are vying for 269 seats in the Na-
 tional Assembly. According to a US embassy esti-
 mate, six parties will garner the bulk of these
 seats, with the Social Justice Party, backed by
 army chief Krit Siwara, leading the pack. Krit is
 also supporting two other parties that are ex-
 pected to do well in the voting. Should these
 forecasts prove accurate, Krit will be in a strong
 position to influence the selection of the next
 prime minister. Moreover, politicians will find it
 difficult to form a coalition government without
 at least Krit's tacit acceptance./

 South Korea
 PAK CALLS FOR REFERENDUM
 President  Pak Chong-hui's announcement
 this week of a national referendL!m on his leader-
 ship uilider the authoritarian 1972 south Korean
 constitution has drawn sharp protests from op-
 position groups. Pak hopes to demonstrate that
 he has national approval for his tough line toward
 domestic dissent. He contends that  softness
 would be especially dangerous at this time, in
 light of the nation's new economic difficulties
 and a continuing threat from the North.
 Pak set no date for the referendum, but it
 will probably be held in mid-February. Balloting
 will reportedly be secret, but under the law no
 public debate on the issues is permitted. Pak's
 opponents are concerned over the difficulty of
 presenting their case to the public and the possi-
 bility that the referendum presages additional
 s'~ppressive measures. Some activists seem ready,
 n metheless, to mount an anti-referendum cam-
 paign, and there is also talk of boycotting the
 balloting.
 Pak apparently sees the referendum as a
 means of taking the political initiative away from
 his critics, who have been preparing for another
 round of anti-government actions this spring. Pak
 hopes that a hig win at the ballot box would tag
 his opponents as nothing more than an anti-socia I
 minority. He may indeed also intend to use the
 results as a basis for tough new control measures,
 possibly including new legal restraints on opposi-
 tion political parties, if major protests develop in
 the coming months.
 Government agencies can probably guaran-
 tee a favorable vote for Pak, but the benefits of
 any referendum are questionable. The results wil
 not quiet his critics and, particularly if govern-
 ment security forces become heavy-handed in at-
 tempts to ensure an overwhelming victory, politi-
 cal tensions may only be a  ravated.

 The oil- and gas-producing countries, led by
 the Arab states, are utiliziog some of their surplus
 oil revenues to increase their national oil-tanker
 fleets. Their combined tanker fleets had reached
 some 2 million deadweight tons by the end of
 1974, still a small share of the world's total
 tanker fleet of over 200 million tons. By 1980,
 the fleets of producing countries are projected to
 reach about 27 million tons, or 7 percent of the
 total world tanker fleet, aggravating the world
 tanker glut. Moreover, the buildup of producer
 tanker capacity further presages the decline in the
 role of the major oil companies.
 Each of the major oil- and gas-producing
 nations has adopted wide-ranging programs to en-
 large its fleet. Kuwait has ordered four very large
 crude carriers totaling 1.3 million tons at a cost of
 $250 million. In addition, the Kuwaitis have allo-
 cated $275 million to organize a company to
 transport liquefied gas and $260 million to
 develop an oil-products tanker fleet of 13 small-
 to-mediu.n tankers.
 The Saudis are particularly active in forming
 new  private shipping companies with  foreign
 partners. One-a consortium of Saudi, Hong
 Kong, and British companies-plans to purchase
 two 200,000-ton tankers as well as tankers to
 move liquefied natural gas to the US, Japan, Ar-
 gentina, arid Brazil. In addition, Saudi Arabia and
 Japan have reached an agreement to establish two
 shipping companies in Saudi Arabia, one of which
 will operate oil tankers between the two coun-
 tries. Two large tankers have been ordered from
 Mitsui shipbuilding for this fleet. Other deals have
 been concluded with Spanish and US interests,
 and ventures involving petrochemical complexes
 and associated tankers are being considered.
 The organization of Arab Petroleum Export-
 ing Countries organized the Arab Maritime Petro-
 leum Transport Company in 1973 to expand their
 tanker assets. The original capital subscription of
 Iraq has ordered 1.3 million tons in the
 125,000 to 150,000 ton range and reportedly is
 in the market for additional tonnage. Libya has
 ordered 850,000 tons for delivery by 1976, while
 Iran has ordered four very large crude carriers
 totaling 900,000 tons. By the 1980s, Venezuela-
 with  foreign  participation-plans to develop a
 modern 2-million-ton fleet as wel! as support fa-
 cilities to haul up to half of its estimated exports
 of 2 million barrels a day. Ecuador is planning a
 national  fleet capable  of transporting about
 100,000 barrels a day by the end of the dc:;ade.
 Indonesia and Nigeria have announced tentative
 programs to develop oil-tanker fleets, and Saudi
 Arabia also has some formative plans.
 In addition to the development of national
 fleets, the producing countries-especially in the
 Persian Gulf-are entering into joint ventures with
 other producers and with Western firms to ovn
 and operate oil tankers. The establishment of
 joint ventures is more important for liquefied gas,
 petrochemicals, and refined products, for which
 more than 150 joint projects are currently under
 consideration by Middle East producers and West-
 ern companies.

 TRADE TALKS MOVE FORWARD
 Multilateral trade discussions resume in
 Geneva today, in the wake of the ?.!nactment of
 the US Trade Act of 1974. In spite of the precipi-
 tous rise in oil prices and emergence of wide-
 spread "stagflation" since the Tokyo discussions
 of 1973, many of the basic positions of the par-
 ticipants remain uncha.iged. Certain countries will
 doubtless voice concern about liberalizing trade in
 the midst of recession, and differences over the
 use of export controls will also emerge.
 French and the more liberal aims of the British
 and Germans Paris views the EC as an integrated,
 independent grouping that should be largely free
 of external influence. It regards both the Com-
 mon External Tariff and the Common Agri-
 cultural Policy as linchpins of European unity and
 will resist any changes that would weaken these.
 As the French see it, the harmonization principle
 could involve raising as well as lowering tariffs.
 Rising concern is evident within the EC,
 particularly in France and Italy, that new trade
 concessions will  increase domestic unemploy-
 ment. In this connection, the European and Japa-
 nese press characterize the US Trade Act as a
 "double-edged sword" with protectionist provi-
 sions that could be invoked if the economic
 decline continues.
 Assured access to goods in short supply has
 become a major issue since the Tokyo conference.
 Japan and the EC favor substantial limitations on
 the use of export controls. Canada and Australia
 regard control over raw material supplies as their
 main bargaining chip and will probably use their
 leverage in this area to obtain concessions in
 others. The less-developed couoir?es prize their
 new-found market power and will try to maxi-
 mize their benefits without conceding any free-
 dom to restrict supplies.
 The EC has two basic aims: preservation of
 community institutions, and limiting new trade
 barriers. The EC will push for "harmonization" of
 tariffs on industrial goods (reducing high tariffs
 by a greater percentage than low tariffs) and for
 international agreements covering major agri-
 cultural commodities. While it recognizes that it
 may have to make concessions on some com-
 modities, the EC intends to preserve the basic
 principles of the Common Agricultural Policy.
 The community position represents a com-
 promise between the limited objectives of the
 Bonn believes that tariffs should be cut ap-
 preciably and that harmonization is not an end in
 itself. West Germany is more willing than France
 to negotiate on agriculture because it is dis-
 enchanted with various aspects of the Agricultural
 Policy. While the Germans support the idea of
 world commodity agreements, they oppose the
 inclusion of food aid and internationally super-
 vised storage facilities in such arrangements. Lon-
 don shares Bonn's positions on tariffs and agricul-
 ture. Though favorably disposed toward the talks,
 the British feel that current economic uncertain-
 ties could stifle progress at Geneva.
 Less is known about the Japanese and Cana-
 dian negotiating positions since they, unlike the
 US and the EC, do not have to develop a nego-
 tiating mandate. Japan favors uniform percentage
 reductions in tariffs on all industrial products and
 supports the concept of agricultural commodity
 agreements. The Canadians want to negotiate in-
 dividual tariff reductions rather than apply an
 overall formula. While Ottawa is closer to the US
 than to the EC position on agriculture, preferring
 freer market access for agricultural products, it
 will probably not vigorously oppose the commu-
 nity proposals.
 The less-developed countries are expected to
 insist on preferential application of any new trade
 arrangements. They are concerned about market
 access for their products and the effects of tariff
 reductions on advantages conferred by trade pref-
 erences. They are likely to push hard for improve-
 ments in the  eneralized system  of  refer-
 ences.

 way as to appear sympathetic-especially with
 Caracas. Just last month, Venezuelan  President
 Perez promised substantial aid to help the region,
 which is almost entirely dependent on imported
 oil.
 The chiefs of state also pledged to cooperate
 in the settlement of the Honduras - El Salvador
 border dispute and in the reorganization of the
 Central American Common Market. Despic9 a
 number of organizational meetings last year, no
 revitalization of the stagnant regional body is yct
 in sight, and new disputes continue to surface.
 The latest problems arose from Nicaragua's deci-
 sion to impose new import and sales taxes on
 foreign goods and from selective stimuli for do-
 mestic industry decreed by El Salvador. Costa
 Rica reacted immediately with a bill authorizing
 "compensatory measures" against members that
 infringe on its national interests. El Salvador has
 also decided to limit fertilizer exports to Guate-
 mala, and Guatemala has retaliated by restricting
 timber supplies to its neighbor.
 Through  the gradual relaxation of tariffs
 among member nations, and the adoption of uni-
 form tariffs for imports from other nationns, the
 Common Market did realize impressive successes
 through the late 1960s. But the common cur-
 rency, uniform fiscal policy, and regional bank
 are as far from realization now as when they were
 projected over a decade ago. Disparate levels of
 development and growing nationalism have been
 major obstacles to the large-scale "rational" plan-
 ning originally envisioned.
 The most significant obstacle to regional in-
 tegration efforts, however, is the nearly five-year-
 old impasse between El Salvador and Honduras
 that erupted in the 1969 "Soccer War." The two
 countries have suspended diplomatic relations as
 well as bilateral trade, and continue to interfere
 with commerce in the rest of the area. When
 Honduras formally withdrew from the Common
 Market in 1972, drastic changes in the flow of
 goods drove Costa Rica's trade deficit to $98
 million and prompted it to initiate separate ex-
 change rates for essential products and  luxury
 goods.                             25X1

 CENTRAL AMERICA: LEADERS MEET
 The five Central American republics, caught
 in a cross-fire triggered by Venezuela's call for
 Latin solidarity against the US Trade Reform Act,
 are seeking agreement among thet selves on a
 policy that will alienate neither the US nor Vene-

 ation and for solidarity in protecting Central

 Reform Act would generally benefit trade rela-

 some Latin American countries should be re-
 solved through hemispheric dialogue rather than
 confrontation.  The Central  American leaders

 BRAZIL: THE CENSORSHIP ISSUE
 The Geisel government appears to be strug-
 gling with the issue of censorship-specifically,
 whether it can abandon all outward aspects of the
 practice or be forced to reimpose strict, overt
 controls.
 Earlier this month, the government removed
 the censors who have been present in the offices
 of the prestigious 0 Estacto de Sao Paulo. The
 unilateral move was accompanied by a request-
 as yet apparently not honcred-that 0 Estado
 agree to abide by telephone instructions as to
 what may not be printed. This practice, as well as
 self-censorship based on previous government
 directives, is in effect in other editorial offices. 0
 Estado, however, has consistently rejected the
 concept of self-regulation, thus obliging the
 regime to maintain a direct presence at the
 paper's headquarters.
 The government's recent initiative may be
 designed, in the final analysis, to create pressure
 that would finally oblige 0 Estado to adopt self-
 censorship. If, after the removal of the censors, 0
 Estado still will not f:,ll into line, its actions could
 well provide the excuse for the imposition of even
 stricter controls on it and, conceivably, on other
 papers. Moreover, by writing on some forbidden
 topic, such as torture or political dissidence, 0
 Estado could, in effect, scoop the other papers
 and incur their wrath, and reinforce any latent
 government wish to return to full censorship.
 Even if Geisel's effort is aimed at ending
 formal  censorship, the government will not
 tolerate a return to no-holds-barred journalism.
 At best, there will continue  to be lim its-self-
 imposed or not-on what sub'ects the press can
 treat.                            25X1
