 Power      Sixth WFTU Conress
 Fight
 Brewing    Soviet Communists will be
 put to a severe test at
 the Sixth WFI'U (World Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions) Congress,
 to be held in Warsaw from 8 to 22
 October.   Moscow-directed policy,
 present and future, will be serious-
 ly contested, especially on the
 grounds of WFPU failure to capture
 the interest of labor organizations
 in Europe and developing areas, no-
 tably in Africa and Latin America.
 The Chicoms and their followers
 will remain openly opposed to the
 Soviet planned focus on "united ac-
 tion" or penetration of non-Communist
 labor movements.  Rather than exclude
 them from the Congress, Moscow will
 more subtly use their (and others)
 failure to pay dues as the excuse. for
 economy moves.  Actually, the reduc-
 tion of activities is designed to
 remove opposition to Soviet control
 and to cover the basic switch in the
 Soviet approach to the labor target.
 These economy measures include.
 personnel reductions at WFTU head-
 quarters in Prague, closing of some
 information offices, discontinuation
 of publication of the WFTU organ,
 Would Trade    on Movement, notably
 in'.Japan and Peking.
 Rumania is stressing the role
 of the labor union in economic plan-
 ning in a Socialist state and perhaps
 in response to this the WFTU has re-
 cently been invited to take some part
 (probably token) in CEMA affairs.
 But the Italians pose the biggest
 problem for continued Soviet control
 because their reasons for coopera-
 tion with non-Communist labor dif-
 fer markedly.  the CGIL wants to
 concentrate on occupational matters;
 the Soviet on ideological and polit-
 ical.  While the Soviets have led
 the WFTU into greater efforts to
 -Join non-communist organizations
 (ILo, UNESCO), and invite non-
 commies to occupational union meet-
 ings (e.g., several Trade Union In-
 ternationals), and have extended
 their interest in regional and na-
 tional trade union activity in
 Europe and the developing areas,
 the WFIU is still stridently polit-
 ical [.e.g., at the ILO Geneva meet-
 ing (2-24 June), the II Conference
 of the International Trade Union
 Committee for Solidarity with the
 Workers and People of Vietnam
 (Hanoi 2?7 July)].  There is no
 indication that the Communist fac-
 tion (PCI) in the CGIL will bolt,
 but the Socialist (PSI) faction
 could well revolt against Soviet

 noting especially the concluding
 emphasis on exacerbation of dissen-
 sions within European Communist
 labor circles, East and West.      We
 add these points.  what the Italians
 say about Socialist countries as
 models for workers should be drawn
 to the attention of labor in devel-
 oping areas, the implication being
 that there are other models; WFTU

 Refuses to        Cuban Ambassador
 Represent         Resigns
 Castro's Cuba
 Your attention is
 invited to the
 article from the London Times of 28
 August 1965 (see Press Comment of
 1 September) Tahich carries lengthy
 extracts from the letter of resig-
 nation of Cuban Ambassador to London,
 Dr. Luis Ricardo Alonso Fernandez.
 In an eloquent plea he asks Cuban
 President Dorticos:  "... why not
 build [in the words of the intellec-
 tual author of the Cuban Revolution,
 Josh Marti] 'a republic with all and
 for all, whose first law should be
 respect for the dignity of man'?"

 A copy of the Senate document
 is available upon request.  We think
 it will prove to be a useful source
 of facts and especially of quotations
 demonstrating the nature of the Com-

 concern of the governments of the
 hemisphere, and their determination
 to cope with the problem.

 L.A. Apprehension    OAS Reports on
 Documented           Communist Sub-
 version
 The United
 States Senate's
 Committee on the Judiciary has just
 published a reprint of various re-
 ports originally issued by the Organ-
 ization of American States,  There
 are five documents reproduced in the
 Senate study, four relating to the
 general pattern of Communist subver-
 sion in the Western Hemisphere, and
 a fifth report dealing with the out-
 break of revolt in the Dominican
 Republic and the OAS decision to
 intervene.
 According to the study, the
 first report contained therein was
 widely circulated by the OAS in
 Spanish, Portuguese, and English,
 but the others received only
 distribution.
 Moscow Radio broad-
 cast to Rumania on

 great political and economic up-
 surge."
 Rumania's longstanding resist-
 ance to the Moscow-sponsored Council
 for Economic Mutual Assistance (CEMA),
 which body sought to keep Rumania in
 the role of pastoral breadbasket (and
 producer of raw materials, notably
 oil) for the Communist Bloc, culmi-
 nated in a 22 Apr 65 "declaration of
 independence" by the Rumanian CP Cen-
 tral Committee.  This declaration re-
 jected the suggestion that Moscow
 was the center of world communism
 and stated that USSR-Rumanian rela-
 tions must be based on "national

 independence and sovereignty, equal

 ference in internal affairs and
 respect for territorial integrity."
 Bucharest's anti-Sovietism was so
 vigorous at this stage that there
 was widespread fear of the Soviets
 being actually provoked to forcible
 intervention.  Certainly Rumania led
 the way in reducing CEMA to impotence.
 It is therefore possible to be-
 lieve that Moscow's applause off'
 Rumania's political and economic pol-
 icies is less than wholehearted or
 sincere.  Moscow's attempt to paint
 "Socialist Rumania's" progress as a
 triumph of "Leninist principles" also
 has a hollow ring.  Rumania's prog-
 ress has been in direct proportion
 to the degree of her escape from
 Soviet domination and her abandon-
 ment of orthodox Communist ideology.
 Postponed   II Afro-Asian Conference
 or
 Canceled?   In its most recent effort
 to ensure high level at-
 tendance at the II Afro-
 Asian Conference (AAC) scheduled for
 5 November in Algiers, the Algerian
 Government held consultations in
 Asian capitals, notably Peking, and
 then dispatched (in late August)
 seven new diplomatic teams into the
 Afro-Arab world.  A major problem is
 Ghana's move to postpone the OAU Sum-
 mit in Accra to 21 October, just be-
 fore the AAC.  Algerians feel that
 this would steal some of the thunder
 from the AAC and argue that the OAU
 should come after it.  Even if a
 sizable proportion of Africans con-
 cur with the Algerians, Ghana is
 not likely to yield.
 Those Africans who agree with
 Algeria may just be interested in
 avoiding the OAU meeting.  The En-
 tente states (former French colonies
 of the OCAM group), for example,
 remain disinterested in the AAC
 while others -- including ? Arab
 states at this time -- seem inclined
 to favor only low level representa-
 tion.  No matter what Foreign Min-
 ister Bouteflika's teams urge, most
 Arabs will follow Nasser's example.
 Although Soviet-Algerian re-
 lations are not overly warm (e.g.,
 the Soviet press publicized the
 fire at the Club des Pins, where
 the AAC is supposed to be held,
 implying that the security situa-
 tion there remains questionable;
 an official Algerian visit to Mos-
 cow has been indefinitely post-
 poned), the Soviets will want to
 be present if the AAC convenes.
 It may be assumed that further
 efforts were made to induce Nasser
 to support Soviet participation
 during his recent visit to Moscow
 and Belgrade.                        50X1-HUM

 PKI's   Sukarno S onsors Another
 Front   Chinese Communist Conference
 Man
 The Indonesian Communist
 Party (PKi) newspaper Harian
 Rakjat has announced that the Indo-
 nesian Peace Committee, one of the
 PKI's front organizations, will spon-
 sor an "International Anti-Foreign
 Military Base Conference" in Dja-
 karta October 10-15, 1965.  The con-
 ference is being held under the pa-
 tronage of President Sukarno who
 will deliver the opening address.
 It will reportedly be attended by
 representatives of Communist Front
 groups from more than 50 countries.
 The Indonesians and Chicoms have
 teamed up for several similar confer-
 ences in Djakarta over the past few
 years and they have developed smooth
 techniques for controlling and man-
 ipulating the delegates to the con-
 ference.  It is anticipated that one
 of the main objectives of this con-
 ference will be to denounce the U.S.
 role in Vietnam and the "British
 colonialist project," Malaysia.  It
 may also serve as a dress rehearsal
 for the Afro-Asian "Bandung" confer-
 ence scheduled for Algiers at the
 beginning of November.  The confer-
 ence will not discuss the fact that
 both Peking and Moscow, whose own
 vast territories are contiguous with
 that of multitudinous countries,
 have subversive bases in almost all
 countries of the world in the form
 of local Communist Parties and front
 groups, with their own guerrilla or
 paramilitary capabilities.
 Communist Blueprint for World Aggression
 Wolfgang Leonhard's Child of the Revolution is a
 detailed account of the manner in which the State
 apparatus of a Communist country trains exiled
 rebels of other lands in techniques, tactics and
 ideology against the day when they may be returned
 to lead "civil wars" against legitimate governments.
 The graduates of these Stalin days still rule in
 many East European countries; and they together with
 the USSR, ComChina and Cuba carry on the tradition
 of training foreign rebels to subvert their homelands.
 Shao-T'ang Liu's Out of Mao's China gives an autobio-
 graphical account of a more limited experience -- the
 year 19+9-1950 in a military-propaganda office in Red
 China.  It is again pertinent reading for current
 affairs.

 COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 ~+X
 Commentary
 Principal Developments:
 18-31 August 1965
 1.  Polemics are restrained.  The Chinese publish Volume 8 of
 Khrushchev's Statements without editorial comment and publicize a long,
 harsh anti-CPSU editorial from Japanese CP organ Akahata.   Soviet Kom-
 munist and Pravda articles repeat the call for unity and -- indirectly
 -- deplore Chinese conduct.
 2.  A series of top-level bilateral CP meetings are announced,
 mostly on the Soviet side.  CPSU leaders in Moscow met the chiefs of
 the Italian, French, East German and West German parties, all announced
 as being in the Soviet Union on vacation:   the Czech and Rumanian bosses
 are due in September on official party-state visits.  All are said to
 have "exchanged opinions" on questions of mutual interest:   only in the
 case of West German Reimann is there reference to "unanimityg"  In the
 opposing camp, two Japanese CP leaders and wives are feted in Peking.
 3.  Pro-Chinese factionalism advances in two West European parties.
 Nuova Unita, monthly organ of the Italian Communist dissidents, calls
 for the constitution of "a new Marxist-Leninist Party" and carries a
 statement by one of the PCI local sections resigning unanimously to
 "adhere to the new M-L Movement."  And Swedish dissident leader Holm-
 berg begins publishing a new organ, Marxist Forum.
 4.  Around the world, the Indonesian CP takes a new initiative in
 a message to the Burmese CP prodding it to "launch efforts to crush the
 modern revisionists," who, together with the imperialists,"are the prin-
 cipal enemy of the ICM."
 5.  A clandestine report says that a group of West European Com-
 munists met in Luxemburg 7 August in response to the Swiss CP initia-
 tive to discuss the founding of a new "Internationale Revolutionnaire"
 -- as had been forecast by earlier reports (see #59).  Reportedly, they
 drafted and mailed to various Communist elements around the world a
 "manifesto" which denounces both the Soviet and Chinese Parties and
 calls for a renaissance of revolutionary theses on a national Communist
 basis.   It includes a strong denunciation of the Belgian Jacques Grippa,
 who has been the most active and successful pro-Chinese Communist in
 Western Europe`.   Text not yet available here.

 Significance:
 The pattern of international Communist activity during this period
 befitted the summer vacation time, the uncertain leadership in the
 Kremlin, possibly also Peking's preoccupation with Vietnam.  A continu-
 ing lull in polemics, but considerable personal contacts by Party leaders.
 We note further evidence of the trend toward fragmentation, especially in
 Western Europe, where pro-Chinese elements have apparently made some ad-
 vances and the Swiss CP initiative toward forming a new "third force"
 alignment between the Soviets and Chinese seems to have moved a first
 step forward.  (The latter seems to be a small-scale move by a group of
 independent opportunists or malcontents which may not go far:  neverthe-
 less, it could add significantly to the confusion, ferment, and fragmenta-

 CHRONOLOGY -- COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 18-31 August 1965
 50X1-HUM
 June  delayed):  Nuova Unita, monthly journal of the pro-Chinese dis-
 sident 1 Italian Marxist-Leninist Movement" carries an article by
 Alberto Bucco attacking PCI discussion of creating a new unified party
 of the left as a "plan for the liquidation of the Party" which demon-
 strates clearly that "the situation of the Party is grave and the
 relations with the masses very weak."
 "At present, the modern reformists are seeking, not very
 skillfully, to mask their political failure and the liquidation
 of principles with the 'discovery' of the 'unified party.'  As
 the prestidigitator, to enchant the public, draws a rabbit
 out of the hat, so the leadership of the PCI, in order to
 deceive the masses once more, draws from its worn revisionist
 hat the 'little rabbit' of the organic unity of all socialist
 forces.  Rabbits, as is known, are prolific, and the leader-
 ship of the PCI is dreaming up millions and millions of
 revisionist rabbits which will meet in the great rabbitry of
 the 'unified party.'  And thus the plan for the liquidation
 of principles will be decisively advanced....
 ....     This signifies that one is ready to join a fake
 unity with all and abandon openly the M-L conception of the
 state, the central Leninist idea to destroy the bourgeois
 state machine and create a new one, the Leninist theory of
 the conquest of power, and the conception of the dictator-
 ship of the proletariat as the indispensable condition for
 the Leninist transformation of society.  These principles are
 established Points of thought and of revolutionary experience,
 and to modify and abandon them implies inevitably ... the
 transformation of the PCI into a social democratic rubbish
 heap....
 It is necessary to constitute a new M-L Party...."
 This issue also carries a statement signed by Secretary Dallaguda
 of the PCI Piacenca Section announcing that "we have decided unani-
 mously to resign from the PCI and to adhere to the new M-L Movement,"
 inasmuch as
 "It has now become clear to all of us that the bureaucracy
 and leadership of the PCI, faithful to the bitter end to

 Khrushchevian policy, are sliding even farther down the slope
 of revisionism and opportunism...."
 Jul, 17 (delayed):  Finnish CP daily KsnsenUutiset, which in recent
 months has carried an increasingly open discussion of Party policies,
 publishes a sharp challenge to the leadership by Toivo Ryhanen under
 the heading "Clarification Is Wanted."
 "...     If we as a party adopt peaceful transition as the
 main orientation, then that principle ought to be clearl
 recorded in the p rogramns of the Party.... Of the matters on
 which a new and clear standpoint is needed, I list the following:
 (1)  The Number of Parties.  ... the Finnish CP should state
 that ... there obviously will be several political parties in
 Finland and that freedom of opposition will be guaranteed....
 A monopoly of a single party can readily lead to bureaucracy
 and intellectual lifelessness, and it impedes progress.
 (2)  Dictatorship of the Proletariat.    ...  The FCP should
 therefore make it known, even in its program, that we do not
 pose the establishing of a dictatorship of the proletariat in
 Finland as one of our goals.
 (3)  Vanguard Position of the Party.  ...  The responsibility
 of leadership in a peaceful transition to socialism does not
 rest alone with the CP; it is basically a form of operational
 unity between socialists and Communists ....
 (4)  The Content of Socialism.  ...  Is it to be a form of
 Stalinist rule by force, or democratic socialism?  ...
 (5)  Party Internal Democracy.
 (6)  Reforms.  ... the political struggle will be waged
 mainly in the sphere of reform policies.  Its value must not
 be diminished through the expounding of false revolutionary
 ,premises....
 July 23-29 (delayed):  Swedish CP weekly Ny Dag article signed PF
 reveals that pro-Chinese Swedish Communist dissident leader Nils
 Hol.rner  is now publishing a newspaper (sic) entitled Marxist Forum
 which 'is all through extremely hostile to the SKP, and naturally
 above all to its Chairman C. H. Hermansson."
 August 18:  TASS reports that Italian CP Gensecy Longo, "who is now
 spending his vacation in the USSR,' held a "comradely exchange of~~
 views" with Brehnev, Suslov and Ponomarev in Moscow on the 17th  on
 questions of interest in both parties and on urgent international
 problems and the ICM."

 &?st 19:  The CPSU again urges unity and -- indirectly and in a low
 key -- deplores Chinese conduct in an editorial in Kounist No. 12
 and a Pravda article signed by I. Pomelov.  The Kommunist editorial,
 entitled Soviet Foreign Policy and Social Progress acknowledges
 that "ter.:porary differences ... may arise in the socialist community,
 which consists of countries with different historical conditions of
 development and different initial levels from which they started their
 socialist construction," saying that "the Soviet Union takes account
 of this in its policy" and "respects the sovereignty of the fraternal
 countries and the national dignity of the peoples."  "The CC of our
 Party continues and will go on exerting persistent efforts to rally
 together the countries of the socialist community....  Our Party and
 people believe that in the present situation it is necessary not
 to brine  le differences to a head artificially, but to do everything
 possible for joint actions...."  Pomelov, whose article is pegged to
 the 30th anniversary of the 7th Comintern Congress, quotes from its
 resolution to convey his message:
 "...  It is of prime importance to follow a principled M-L
 policy and flexible tactics, taking into account the concrete
 conditions, to wage a resolute struggle against right-wing
 opportunism, dogmatism., and sectarianism.  To achieve a united
 front in reality, Communists must overcome complacent
 sectarianism in their own ranks, which at the present moment
 in a number of instances is no longer an infantile disease
 but an ingrained vice...."
 A Yugoslav I AZst  commentary on Chinese policy toward the
 developing countries accuses the Chinese leaders of "trying to impose
 their influence and concepts"'on these countries to serve China's
 "interests of great-power policy" and to "bring about its hegerionistic
 projects."
 NCNA D      a reports on an 18 August Indonesian CP jKIJ release
 covering a press conference of PKI Chairman Aidit with "50 Afro-Asian
 and Latin American journalists" on the 16th.  In reply to a question
 on polemics, Aidit is quoted as saying:  "I think it would have been
 a__ pity if the -polemics had been discontinued.  From the open polemics
 the Communists of Indonesia have come to realize what modern revi-
 sionism actually is....  If the open polemics had not taken place,
 we might now have become revisionists without knowing it."
 August 22:  Inozemtsev in Pravda (according to a TASS summary)
 rebuffs bourgeois propaganda which claims that capitalism and social-
 ism are varieties of the same 'industrial civilization' and that the
 process of development tends to bring socialism and capitalism 'closer
 together''.
 TASS announces that Brezhnev, Suslov, and Ponomarev met on
 21 Aug    with French CP GenSecy Rochet,  who is resting in the

 REFUGEES:  A TOOL IN VIET CONG AGGRESSION
 The Refugee Problem in South Vietnam
 President Johnson has announced that he is sending Dr.
 Howard Rusk to South Vietnam to survey the needs and requirements of
 refugees with the purpose of developing plans to expand U.S. assistance
 to the South Vietnamese government in this area.  Dr. Rusk, Director of
 New York University Medical Center's Institute of Physical Medicine and
 Rehabilitation, performed a similar service for the United Nations in
 Korea when the Chicoms and North Koreans attacked South Korea and drove
 millions of people from their homes.
 The refugee problem has plagued South Vietnam since its earliest
 days.   In 1954 when the country was partitioned at the 17th Parallel
 with a Communist government to be installed in the North and a non-
 Communist government in the South, close to a million people fled their
 homes in the North rather than remain and face life under Communist rule.
 The South Vietnamese government undertook to resettle these people and
 assist them in building a new life for themselves.   It was not an easy
 task, particularly since the South Vietnamese authorities were confronted
 with other complex problems at the same time.   Steady progress was
 achieved, however, and by about 1960 the refugees from the North were
 mostly resettled and self-supporting.
 No sooner had that refugee problem been settled than another one
 began to assume major proportions.  As the Viet Cong stepped up their
 insurrection against the Vietnamese Government, they increased their use
 of terrorism, maiming and killing peasants and villagers, expropriating
 their rice and property, and threatening the people in diverse ways.
 Word of Viet Cong actions spreads through the rural areas and the peas-
 ants flee their homes in increasing numbers to seek refuge in areas con-
 trolled by the central government.   It is estimated that there are over
 400,000 such refugees at this time and that the number is increasing at
 the rate of 70,000 per month.   If this rate continues some 840,000 re-
 fugees per year will have to be cared for.   If Viet Cong terrorism con-
 tinues to increase, the number will go even higher.
 The South Vietnamese Ministry of Social Welfare has been made re-
 sponsible for administering the government program to provide for these
 refugees.   They have allocated about 25 kilos [approx. 55 lbs] of rice

 SECRET
 per month to every refugee over two years old.  After the food require-
 ment, the Vietnamese government has made housing the number one priority
 and an extensive construction program has been started.
 In addition to the daily needs of the refugees, a recent survey
 indicates that 35 schools must be built to take care of the refugee
 children and that a suitable teaching staff must be assembled; sanita-
 tion facilities in the refugee camps are inadequate and must be improved;
 water wells must be dug; orphanages must be built; and medical services
 must be provided.  All of these tasks would be difficult enough under
 normal circumstances.  They place a monumental burden on a government
 and people forced to defend themselves against Communist attack.
 Recently completed studies indicate that over $8.5 million has
 already been spent in providing for the refugees from the Viet Cong
 terrorism.   The US government is currently allocating some $12 million
 to provincial Vietnamese authorities for their use in this field.   It
 is estimated that the current plans of the US and Vietnamese Governments
 to expand their efforts to meet the needs of the refugees will come to
 well over $20 million.  But the cost is not in money alone:   scarce re-
 sources of trained leadership and material are being expended.
 The Communist forces are not burdened by such considerations.  On
 the contrary, they gain from the additional drain they place upon their
 adversary.   In times of danger, people do not flee to, but  f r o m
 Communist controlled areas for they have come to learn that the Com-
 munists have no tolerance for nor interest in their problems, nor are
 they willing to divert any of their funds or other resources to the
 comfort or rehabilitation of war refugees,   (See unclassified attach-
 ments for statements by Leo Cherne and Donald Luce on the Vietnamese
 refugee problem.  These statements were made to the US Senate Judiciary
 Committee, but need not necessarily be attributed as such because Cherne's
 and Luce's organizations have published the statements independently.

 .THE KONbSONDL -- THE SOVIET UNION'S MONOPOLY          50X1 -H
 ON YOUTH A  IVITIES
 The Komsomol is not an organization created to help
 students in their various problems. It is an organization created by
 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for the purpose of getting and
 keeping the Soviet youth within the party's control.  It accomplishes
 this by maintaining a monopoly control over the paths to advancement in
 every field; and it also accomplishes this by virtue of its power to pun-
 ish those who get out of line.  The Komsomol also fulfills a vital role
 ,in Soviet economics:  it recruits youth corvees to develop the virgin
 lands and to build fertilizer factories and it provides the organizational
 capability to oversee their performance.  A further important function of
 the Komsomol is its role in selecting, training  and testing future cadres
 for the Party and the government.  Finally, the Komsomol is in charge of
 all relationships of Soviet youth with foreigners.  It controls the
 chief international Communist youth fronts, the World Federation of Demo-
 cratic Youth (WFDY), and the International Union of Students (IUS).50X1 -HUM

 the New Communist
 Propaganda Strategy
 PARIS
 711E POET Robert Lowell has re-
 fused to attend a gala at the
 White House," a front-page editorial
 in the Communist l'Humanitd ex-
 ulted recently. "... Six other Pulitzer
 Prize winners, painters, composers,
 critics, and twenty writers or artists
 have associated themselves with his
 gesture. . . . These twenty intellec-
 tuals not only, do America honor;
 they are humanity's chances for
 peace. And we on our side do not
 begrudge  them  our  admiration."
 This unusual testimonial to the non.
 Communist protest movement in
 the United States, signed by Andre
 Wurmser, one of the French Party's
 leading journalistic hatchet-men, was
 naturally balanced with attacks on
 the Johnson administration's foreign
 policy. Even so, a hasty reader might
 have been impressed by the apparent
 sincerity of Wurmser's. disclaimer of
 any anti-American intent. Impressed,
 that is, until he turned to the third
 page, which featured reports on dem-
 onstrations or meetings organized
 throughout the country ley the Com-
 munist-controlled Peace Movement.
 In Marseilles, the newspaper noted,
 a crowd of several hundred persons
 demonstrated  on  the  Canebi@re
 against the arrival in port of a
 United States warship. Another street
 demonstration at Ivry in the Paris
 suburbs was punctuated, according
 to the paper, with cries of "Peace in
 Vietnam,"  "U.S. Assassins," "Out
 with the 'Ricains (Americans.)"
 A Concerted Attack
 Talking out of both sides of the
 mouth is not exactly a new accom-
 plishnient for l'Humanitd or for
 Communist propaganda in general.
 In recent years, however, the hate-
 America line, the basic theme of So-
 viet psychological warfare during
 TAYLOR
 the Korean war, has been so muffled
 under layers of Khrushchevian coex-
 istence that a number of supposedly
 hard-minded western policymakers
 thought it had disappeared for good.
 Its recent vicious revival is a phe-
 nomenon that does not yet appear
 to have received adequate attention
 either from the United States's allies
 abroad or from campus critics of the
 Johnson administration at home or
 from the administration itself.
 It is only within the last month
 or so that signs of a coherent offen-
 sive strategy have become apparent
 behind Communist propaganda and
 subversive tactics in Europe. There
 was, naturally, some ? ranting in the
 Communist press about the U.S.
 bombing of North Vietnam and the
 dispatch of marines to Santo Do-
 mingo;  there were meetings and
 street  demonstrations  in  various
 countries, including France. But to
 experienced students of Communist
 propaganda the campaign, if it could
 be called that, had an essentially de-
 fensive character: All the party really
 seemed concerned about was to show
 the European masses that its heart
 still bled for the victims, of imperi-
 alism, despite Peking's insinuations
 to the contrary. Sophisticated Euro-
 pean leftists were not taken in. "The
 Sino-Soviet split has paralyzed the in-
 ternational Communist movement,"
 declared the weekly Nouvel Observa-
 teur. ". . . Its inability to react is
 creating a kind of vacuum in his-
 tory."
 Gradually Moscow's anti-U.S. line
 toughened. Borrowing a favorite tac-
 tic of certain Gaullist publications,
 the official Communist organs in
 France and elsewhere in Europe re-
 pudiated  anti-Americanism  while
 stuffing their columns with written
 or pictorial matter calculated to
 make the United States look odious
 and contemptible. The Soviet-con-
 trolled  rumor-mills  and  forgery
 plants in western Europe which had
 been idling in the last few years be-
 gan to step up their output. One
 hitherto unheard-of literary agency
 has been calling up prospective cli-
 ents in Paris to offer documents
 allegedly filched from official archives
 and said to prove that President
 Roosevelt's State Department helped
 finance the Franco revolution in .
 1936.
 T HE STRATEGIC GOAL of  this new
 propaganda offensive emerged in
 an editorial signed. by Jeannette
 Thorez-Vermeersch, Maurice Thorez'
 widow, which appeared in 1'Human-
 itd on June 2. "By the admission of
 the American leaders themselves," the
 editorial declared, "their [foreign]
 military bases are not . . . intended
 to insure peace, to defend the coun-
 tries in question against an eventual
 aggression, but to impose on them by
 violence governments subject to the
 United  States...."  The  recom-
 mended counter-strategy for French
 patriots was summed up in the arti-
 cle's title: U.S. Go Home.
 The familiar slogan has some new
 trimmings that promise to give it
 -at least in France-a far greater
 potential for subverting the Atlantic
 Alliance than it has possessed in
 the  past.  For one  thing,  Mine.
 Thorez-Vermeersch's  editorial, re-
 flecting current Kremlin policy di-
 rectives, was peppered with catch-
 words borrowed from Gaullist pro-
 paganda and seemingly addressed
 more to the nationalist than to the
 revolutionary sentiments of 1'Hu-
 manitd's readers. It appeared, more-
 over, precisely ,at the moment when
 Paris was buzzing with rumors that
 President de Gaulle would soon de-
 mand the withdrawal of American
 troops from French soil or that of
 SHAPE headquarters. The Commu-
 nist intent apparently is at once
 to force de Gaulle's hand and to
 sow suspicion of him in the minds
 of his allies by creating the false
 impression that his nationalist poli-
 cies are secretly inspired by Moscow.
 Anything that can be exploited by
 Communist propaganda to exacer-
 bate French suspicion or disapproval

 gle, provided it is an anti-American
 angle. An editorial in Le Monde on-
 the success of Gemini IV must have
 seemed to Communist and Gaullist
 anti-American specialists a master-
 piece of its kind, Was there not, the,
 editorial asked, "some kinship be-
 tween the Big Stick which the U.S.
 is brandishing here and there and
 the brutal acceleration of the space

 Peaceful Engagement
 A Plan For Europe's Future
 HE  C O L D W A R in Europe has lost its
 Told meaning. It had vitality and passion as
 long as either side had reason to believe that
 it could prevail and felt genuinely threatened
 by the other. Neither condition truly exists to-
 day. The West feels that it cannot remove the
 Communist regimes in East Europe, re-unify
 Germany, or, most important of all, eliminate
 the Soviet presence on the banks of the Elbe
 by direct political action. The Communists, and
 particularly the Soviet leaders, now privately
 discount the likelihood of Communist revolu-
 tions in the West. The two Soviet rebuffs suf-
 fered in Berlin-in 1948-49 and again in 1958-62
 -have had much the same effect on Communist
 expectations as the passivity of the West during
 the East German uprising of 1953 and during
 the Hungarian revolution of 1956 had on
 Western hopes.
 Yet the status quo in Europe is far from
 satisfactory. The division of Europe on the Elbe
 TIIE  READER  of the two  comprehensive
 articles by Richard Lowenthal on "Has the
 Revolution a Future?" (ENCOUNTER, January
 and February) could scarcely help putting a
 question-in view of these radical changes in
 the present political situation what, then, can
 and must be done? With this new study of
 the tragic East-West partition, we offer for
 discussion a bold and dramatic plan for the
 future of Europe. Professor Brzezinski, a
 well-known member of Columbia University,
 has been travelling extensively in Eastern and
 Western Europe. His most recent books are
 The Soviet Bloc: Unity and Conflict (Pall
 Mall, London), and Political Power: USA/
 USSR (Chatto & Windus and Viking); his
 article on "How to Control a Deviation"
 appeared in the September x963 ENCOUNTER.
 is unnatural, unhistorical, and contrary to pre-
 sent trends favouring not only European econo-
 mic and then political unification, but also the
 rapidly spreading psychological sense of Euro-
 pean unity. Hardly anyone in Europe, on either
 side of the river Elbe, is willing to argue that
 the division is in the interest of Europeans, and
 this includes even the Russians. It certainly is
 not in the interest of peace.
 Yet policies derived from past illusions, fears,
 and aspirations freeze both sides on the dividing
 line. Meanwhile, the danger mounts that the
 East, frustrated ideologically, torn by internal
 divisions, will turn against itself, with the pos-
 sibility of bitter political explosions. The West
 at the same time becomes increasingly divided.
 Its former unity of purpose, born largely out
 of fear of Russian aggression, is dissipated in a
 destructive feud over priorities, objectives, and
 interests. Western spasms of resolve reinforce
 Soviet insecurity while Western irresolution re-
 awakens Soviet offensive hopes. Both postures
 serve to perpetuate artificially and pointlessly
 the European partition.
 Tua SOVIET ATTITUDE is still wedded.to the ex-
 pectation that West Europe will fragment,. and
 accordingly Soviet policy in Europe still makes
 the achievement of that fragmentation its prin-
 cipal objective. German policy, influenced by
 narrow national perspectives, remains com-
 mitted to the pursuit of basically contradictory
 goals, "reunification" and (formally, at least)
 frontier revision, with the latter having the
 effect of stimulating Polish and Czech support
 for the division of Germany. The French en-
 visage a- "Europe to the Urals," but by seeking
 simultaneously to exclude America from Europe,

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040006-0
 are fragmenting Western unity, re-awakening
 Soviet offensive hopes, and denying themselves
 the necessary Western wherewithal for the pur-
 suit of this grand goal. The British seem to
 speak simultaneously in terms of the Anglo-
 American alliance and European disengage-
 ment. The United States, having abandoned
 "liberation," is tending to pursue "bridge-
 building" to the East almost as an end in itself,
 thereby confusing means with ends of policy.
 Thus no major power is effectively addressing
 itself to the problem of European partition.
 How to bridge the gap dividing Europe with-
 out either side seeming to capitulate? How to
 achieve the restoration of Europe without creat-
 ing new tensions in the process? These ques-
 tions pose the central problem of the coming
 decade in Europe. With the internal pressures
 for change (accelerated by the Sino-Soviet dis-
 pute) surfacing in the Soviet Union and in East
 Europe, and with West Europe increasingly
 preoccupied with its identity, the division on
 the Elbe becomes more intolerable and the ques-
 tions more urgent. To-day Europe is still, to
 borrow de Gaulle's striking phrase, "without
 soul, without backbone, and without roots."
 But more and more Europeans, both eastern
 and western, are coming to resent this condi-
 tion.
 Indeed, the time has passed when Germany
 could be satisfied with a purely declaratory
 Atlantic policy on the issue of German reunifi-
 cation. The present internal trends in Germany,
 as well as general change in the European rela-
 tionship to America, point clearly to the re-
 emergence of "the German issue" as the key
 problem for Western policy, and the nature of
 the American response to it may determine the
 future American relationship to Europe. To be
 meaningful and effective, the response will have
 to be based on a broader evaluation of the
 European scene, particularly with regard to the
 changes in the eastern bloc. The problem of
 the German partition has become critically
 linked to the problem of the European partition,
 and neither can be resolved without the resolu-
 tion of the other.
 To as SURE, since that partition is the outcome
 of a historical process spanning two world wars,
 the European restoration accordingly cannot be
 accomplished by a single political settlement.
 Neither will it come about by American or Rus-
 sian disengagement from Europe. America and
 Russia will not abandon Europe, for neither
 could be certain that its departure will not mean
 the extension of the power of the other-no
 matter what formal guarantees, were seemingly
 provided. Moreover, in spite of de Gaulle's
 oratory, Europe in. the foreseeable future will
 not be powerful enough to end its own parti-
 tion. This partition can only be ended if the
 American-Soviet confrontation in Europe is
 gradually transformed into co-operation. That
 requires both patience and imagination. And it
 does not exclude an occasional bold initiative,
 designed to make the gradual process take a
 qualitative step forward.
 D D E  G A U L L E once wrote that great leaders
 are remembered "for the sweep of their
 endeavours." This is true of great nations as
 well, for their leadership is measured not only
 by their power but also by the scope of their
 goals. Commitment to a grand goal by itself can
 generate the power of attraction and mobilise
 adherents. Leadership is a dynamic-not a static
 --condition, and it expands with the tasks
 undertaken.
 To-day, the West faces a great and growing
 challenge: to take the initiative towards ending
 the partition of Europe. In present circum-
 stances, merely to strive to tie Western Europe
 to America in order to defend it from Russia
 will only awaken European suspicions of
 "American hegemony," especially as the Euro-
 pean fear of Russia wanes and the European
 sense of dependence on America declines. New
 security schemes (e.g., some form of MLF),
 even if otherwise desirable, will not solve the
 problem of the American-European relationship
 for the problem is now less one of European
 security than of the purpose of the relationship.
 There is widespread evidence of growing
 European feeling that America is becoming
 irrelevant to the future of a divided, safe, but
 somehow frustrated Europe. The fact that de.
 Gaulle's appeals for a "European Europe,  in-
 cluding a "Europe to the Urals," have been
 evoking an increasingly sympathetic reaction
 among a growing number of Europeans and
 the fact that German politics give every sign
 of mounting restlessness, are testimony to the
 proposition that a new era is dawning in
 Europe, that a new European mood is shaping.
 This new condition has special implications for
 America's relations to Europe.
 By taking the initiative in developing policies
 designed to bring both Russia and East Europe
 into a closer relationship with the West, and
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040006-0
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040006-0
 thereby to end the European partition, America
 would be furthering its own basic interests.
 First of all, the very fact of such commitment
 would do much to revive America's waning
 relevance to Europe. Secondly, it would pro-
 vide a framework for restoring the East Euro-
 pean nations to independence without simul-
 taneously creating new instabilities or stimu-
 lating narrow nationalisms. Finally, by laying
 the foundations for a broader East-West settle-
 ment, it would eliminate the persisting Euro-
 pean  fears  of  an  American-Soviet  power
 duopoly. All that would be consistent with
 domestic American values and the American
 quest for world order.
 IT Is SOMETIMES SAID that a Europe "free from
 America" would be in a better position to solve
 the problem of its partition. Such a Europe
 would seem less threatening to Russia and East
 Europe, and hence they would be more inclined
 to accept a closer relationship with it. But this
 view overlooks the probability that the process
 of achieving such an "independent" Europe,
 detached from America, would cause conflicts
 and instabilities which the Russians would be
 tempted to exploit. Secondly, and just as im-
 portant, such a Europe would probably be domi-
 nated by Germany, and hence would be un-
 likely to offer an appealing magnet to the East
 Europeans and to the Russians. Because the
 U.S. has no claims beyond the Elbe, its con-
 tinued association with Europe offers the best
 guarantee to the Russians and the East Euro-
 peans that the West poses no direct political
 threat to them.
 As far as the West Europeans are concerned,
 American commitment to the goal of peaceful
 reunification of Europe is more likely to com-
 mand European support than either past calls
 for "liberation" or present attempts to develop
 a more equitable control of nuclear weapons,
 not to mention efforts to involve Europe in the
 rather remote problems of Asian or African de-
 velopment. Such a broader design could displace
 the Gaullist appeal, or even preempt eventual
 Gaullist approaches to Russia. Moreover, it
 would mitigate the danger that the disintegra-
 tion of Western unity would leave the Ameri-
 can-German alliance as the sole bond between
 America and Europe.
 A bilateral German-American relationship
 could only be defensive; it would have no
 appeal in East Europe and no constructive
 Eastern policy could be based on it alone. Such
 a relationship could perhaps provide a shield
 for West Europe, but its effectiveness in this
 respect would paradoxically contribute to fur-
 ther divisions in the West. European dissensions
 would flourish in the protected haven provided
 by American-German power. There would be
 little room for America in such a Europe, and
 eventually  even  the  German-American  ties
 might crumble as their insufficiency in assuring
 German reunification became more evident.
 Three Assumptions
 T H R E E   C A R DIN A L assumptions should
 guide U.S. and Atlantic policy in the pur-
 suit of the goal of European restoration: First,
 Western military strength must be maintained
 and Western interests vigorously protected. This
 point may seem  self-evident.  But military
 strength is a prerequisite as much for policies of
 increasing co-operation and eventual reconcilia-
 tion, as for those of pressure and hostility. Pre-
 cisely because both the objectives and the means
 of the policy advocated here are peaceful, it is
 important that there be no uncertainty on the
 other side as to the West's determination to pro-
 tect its interests. If the status quo is to be the
 starting-point for an eventual reconciliation, it
 follows that the West must remain vigilant in
 protecting it.
 The Soviets have provided much evidence
 over the last two decades that they consider
 Berlin to be an exposed Western outpost, vulner-
 able to pressure. Occasional acts of Soviet
 pressure may, therefore, be expected. These
 ought to be resisted, for even a few hours' in-
 terruption of the lines of access to Berlin under-
 mines the Western position. The final release
 of a Western convoy after a fifty-hour delay
 represents not a Western victory, but proof of
 the Soviet capacity to interrupt access. More
 vigorous responses than those heretofore applied
 are needed in the future. Since the United
 States has indicated that it will not invade Cuba,
 Cuba could perhaps serve as a useful hostage for
 Berlin. Soviet-engineered delays in the Allied
 right of access to Berlin should perhaps be im-
 mediately reciprocated by similar harassment of
 Soviet shipping on the international waters
 around Cuba. Exactly because that action
 would be arbitrary, it would drive home the
 lesson to the Soviet leadership that the West will
 not tolerate impairment of its present position.
 The fundamental point is that no Western
 policy of conciliation is possible in a context
 which allows the other side opportunities for
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040006-0
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040006-0
 effective military blackmail. The historical sig-
 niiica.nce of the Cuban confrontation was its
 deflation of the confidence of Soviet leaders in
 their ability to extort concessions from the West
 by military threats. We must never allow them
 to think they can.
 SECONDLY,  any basic change in the East-West
 European relationship will have to involve East
 Europe jointly with Russia. A policy based on
 the assumption that individual East European
 states can be encouraged to defect to the West
 is not likely to succeed because in the final
 analysis the ruling Communist elites have no
 interest in becoming absorbed by the West, even
 though pushed in that direction by economic
 and popular pressures. The Soviet Union is
 likely to exert every effort to prevent open
 defections either from coMacoN or from the
 Warsaw Treaty Organisation. Moreover, the
 experience of Yugoslavia and Poland suggests
 that the ruling Communist elites gravitate back
 towards a closer relationship with Moscow, once
 the more objectionable aspects of the relation-
 ship with the Soviet Union have been elimin-
 ated. Their defections were thus limited and
 revocable.
 Indeed, defections of the East European
 countries individually, even if possible, might
 not be in the interest of peace. The United
 States and the Soviet Union will remain for a
 long time to come the two leading competitors
 for global power. Dramatic change either way
 -the defection of the East European states to
 the West or the fragmentation of West Europe
 and the expulsion of America-would directly
 threaten the present balance of power and set
 in motion dangerous reactions and counter-
 reactions. In addition, individual defections,
 especially if the result of encouragement from
 the West, would reduce the moderating in-
 fluence of East Europe on Russia, and thus de-
 celerate the ultimately crucial process of Russian
 evolution.
 The more desirable sequence of change would
 begin with the internal liberalisation of the
 East European societies and lead towards their
 gradual evolution into a Greater Europe jointly
 with the Soviet Union. This obviously does not
 mean a synchronised evolution. East Europe,
 given its historical links with the West and in
 some cases more advanced internal conditions
 prior to Communist take-over, is likely to
 evolve more rapidly than Russia. This is especi-
 ally true of Czechoslovakia, and to a lesser
 extent of Hungary and Poland. While it would
 be unrealistic to expect these East European
 countries soon to become democratic societies,
 or leave the Communist orbit, their more rapid
 evolutioft may be more effective in bringing
 similar evolution of the Soviet Union, precisely
 because of their continuing links with it. In
 its turn, change in the Soviet Union may stimu-
 late further changes in those East European
 states which (also for historical reasons) may
 lag behind even Russia. Thus East Europe,
 while not breaking away, may pull the Soviet
 Union forward while moving ahead of it, thus
 cumulatively preparing the ground for a better
 East-West relationship.
 Not that we should actively discourage the
 occasional acts of nationalist self-assertion, as,
 for instance, in the case of Rumania. Bucharest's
 nationalist self-assertion automatically reduced
 the restrictive influence of the Soviet Union on
 East Europe. To the extent that Moscow was
 compelled to reconsider its own heavy-handed
 economic nationalism in dealings with the East
 European states, the development was all to
 the good. Its importance, however, should not
 be overrated. It is doubtful that a healthy
 Europe can be built by prompt..  anti-Soviet
 nationalist dictatorships. They c:, ..d bring in
 their wake all the traditional territorial and
 ethnic conflicts, providing temptations for the
 U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. again to become in-
 volved. It would be short-sighted for the West
 to ride the tiger of nationalism in the hope that
 it will threaten only the Soviet dominated
 world; the tiger could endanger all of Europe.
 Tm RDLY, the end of the division of Germany
 will come only as a consequence of a gradual
 but qualitative change in the relationship be-
 tween: both Russia and East Europe and the
 West. In all likelihood, German reunification
 will be the last and not the first act in the evolu-
 tionary unification of the European continent.
 It will come about through a process of change,
 and it is not likely to be the outcome of some
 far-reaching diplomatic settlement around a
 green table. At long last, both German and
 American policies have come to recognise this
 reality. But this recognition carries with it addi-
 tional implications for our perspective on such
 problems as the Berlin Wall and the issue of. the
 eastern frontier.
 Paradoxical as it may seem, the Wall has in-
 creased the long-range prospects for German
 reunification. As long as East Germany was

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040006-0
 drained by massive defections of its population,
 the situation became increasingly unstable and
 the front-line confrontation on the German
 demarcation line .was intensified. Since the
 Soviet Union was far from ready to resign
 itself to the dismantling of the East German
 regime, this merely forced a further assertion
 of the Soviet presence in East Germany and the
 reinforcement of Soviet domination throughout
 the adjacent regions. Moreover, the events of
 1953 and  1956 show the improbability of
 Western intervention in support of a major re-
 bellion in Eastern Germany. Accordingly, the
 tensions and the massive flights merely increased
 the hostility between the East and the West
 without in any way increasing the prospects.
 that the dividing line could be erased.
 The Berlin Wall, however, provides the West
 with a striking symbol of the basic artificiality
 of the East German regime but without the
 dangers inherent in the daily exposure and
 exacerbation of that artificiality. More impor-
 tant, the relative quiet on the German front-
 line permitted Western activity in East Europe
 designed to stimulate evolutionary changes; the
 East Europeans were more responsive because
 of the seeming security provided by the buffer
 East German state. The cumulative effect was
 clearly in the West's (including Germany's)
 long-range interest, despite the anguish and
 demoralisation it caused.
 Moreover, the shifting of the central focus of
 the European problem from Germany to East
 Europe has created more favourable conditions
 for a more genuine enlistment of British and
 French support for the cause of European re-
 unification. Although paying lip-service to the
 proposition that Germany should be reunified,
 neither could look forward with equanimity
 to the prospect of a reunified Germany 7o
 million strong, and by far the preponderant
 power in Europe. But though a mere shift
 of the European partition from the Elbe to the
 Oder River, with East Europe in the Russian
 sphere and West Europe dominated by Ger-
 many, was not very appealing to many non-
 German Western Europeans, a broader solution
 involving  East  Europe  and  Russia  could
 mobilise the support even of those who are
 fearful of Germany, and make their commit-
 ment to German reunification more than a
 hollow ritual. This broader solution, however,
 requires a normalisation in Germany's relation-
 ship with East Europe, particularly on the
 critical issue of the German eastern frontier.
 WESTERN  POLICIES  IN EUROPE  thus  should be
 based on three main premises: the maintenance
 of Western military power, the joint involve-
 ment of Eastern Europe and Russia in any
 ultimate solution, and the interdependence of
 German reunification with evolutionary change
 in the East. These premises are interdependent
 and the policy goals they imply should be pur-
 sued simultaneously. The West cannot solve
 the  German  problem  without  developing
 policies which transcend it to encompass the
 whole range of problems associated with the
 division of Europe. The five policy goals that
 follow are designed to meet that need.
 The Problem of Eastern Germany
 1 To convince the East Europeans, particu-
 . larly the Czechs and the Poles, that the
 existence of East Germany limits their freedom
 without enhancing their security. Otherwise,
 the Czechs and the Poles will continue to sup-
 port the Soviet presence in East Germany as a
 convenient and reassuring buffer against West
 Germany. To undermine the East European
 stake in East Germany, the West will have to
 differentiate sharply in its attitude towards East
 Germany and towards the rest of East Europe.
 For East Germany, the policy must be one of
 isolation; for East Europe, one of peaceful en-
 gagement-economic, cultural, and eventually
 political. Only then will East Germany become
 a political anachronism on the map of Europe,
 a  source  of  continuing  embarrassment  to
 Moscow, and no longer a source of security to
 the East Europeans.
 The efforts so far undertaken by the West
 German government to establish closer relations
 with the East European states have already con-
 tributed greatly to isolating the East German
 regime. To further this process, the West Ger-
 man government should be encouraged to find
 some formula freeing it from the self-imposed
 limits oa relations with the East European states
 inherent in "the Hallstein doctrine." Perhaps
 excluding from the application of the doctrine
 those states which are members of the Warsaw
 Treaty Organisation (or possibly those that
 border on Germany) could provide a loophole,
 without encouraging other states to recognise
 East Germany. In any case, it is only through
 better relations with West Germany that the
 East Europeans can eventually become con-
 vinced that the reunification of Germany opens
 to them the doors to the West that are now

 shut by the Soviet occupation forces in East
 Germany.
 Only the Communist fanatics attach any
 ideological importance to the continued exist-
 ence of a Communist East Germany. Otherwise,
 East Germany is valuable to the East Europeans
 primarily in terms of their national interests,
 largely defensive since the East European states
 are themselves small and cannot entertain any
 aggressive designs. But with the progressive
 evolution of the East European states, skilfully
 abetted by a conciliatory West, East Germany
 eventually may lose even its appeal as a buffer,
 and begin to resemble a Soviet Mozambique-
 a source of irritation to the East Europeans and
 of embarrassment to Moscow. Only then will
 the Kremlin consider the possibility of liquidat-
 ing East Germany, and it is only the Kremlin,
 not the German Communists, who can consider
 its liquidation. Creation of conditions for this
 should be the goal of Allied and German policy
 -not merely the transformation of the East
 German regime into a more moderate Com-
 munist regime, more acceptable to the West
 and to its own people.
 THE OSTRACISM OF East Germany can be further
 advanced by treating the East European states
 as if in fact they were fully independent states,
 unlike East Germany doomed to remain a mere
 Soviet puppet. The East European states can
 gradually evolve because they are national states.
 Their nationalism inherently works in the direc-
 tion of increasing the independence of these
 states from the one state that now limits this
 independence-the Soviet Union. Therefore, the
 United States and Western Europe ought to
 respond seriously to any East European foreign
 policy proposals, and even encourage the East
 Europeans to make more.' Our response to these
 proposals need not be affirmative, but more of
 an effort should be made to engage the indivi-
 dual East European states in prolonged negotia-
 tions and discussions. These breed national
 pride, expose East European leaders to Western
 counter-arguments in relative privacy and with
 ' That this is becoming a more sensitive issue
 among the East Europeans was suggested to the
 author by the reaction of a high East European
 official when he was asked why his country, unlike
 Communist Poland, did not take any foreign policy
 initiatives. After an embarrassed silence, he agreed
 that perhaps his country had been remiss on the
 international scene and hoped that perhaps in the
 near future it would become more active in taking
 international initiatives.
 freedom from Soviet supervision, and stimulate
 an awareness of their own national interest. It is
 counter-productive to Western  interests to
 simply dismiss (as has often been the case) the
 East Europeans as proxies for the Soviet Union
 even when, in fact, they are acting as such.
 Poles and Germans
 2  To promote a German-Polish reconcilia-
 . tion, somewhat on the model of the
 Franco-German reconciliation of the 'fifties.
 Such a reconciliation should be a proclaimed
 goal of the United States, the closest ally of
 Germany and the home of many millions of
 Americans of both German and Polish parent-
 age. Just as peace and stability in Western
 Europe could not have been achieved unless the
 old Franco-German quarrel was ended, so a
 German-Polish reconciliation is the sine qua non
 of peace and stability in the East. The U.S.
 could benefit greatly in terms of moral prestige
 from proclaiming such a reconciliation as one
 of its principal objectives, in contrast to the
 Soviet Union and the Communists who find it
 convenient to keep alive the bitter Polish-
 German hatred.
 The pursuit of this goal inevitably raises the
 difficult and sensitive issue of the Oder-Neisse
 frontier. Perhaps some day frontiers will cease
 to be important in Europe, but that day will
 come only after the European frontiers have
 become secure and accepted. A sense of in-
 security as to frontier issues keeps alive national
 hatreds and fears. At the present time, since
 "anti-Germanism" is the principal asset of a
 weak and unpopular Polish regime, it may not
 be in the interest of the Polish government to
 reach any substantial agreement with Germany,
 which would include the frontier issue. Indeed,
 the ideal situation for that government would
 be to obtain Western economic aid while not
 obtaining but persistently demanding the recog-
 nition of the Oder-Neisse frontier. Moreover, it
 is certainly in the Soviet interest to keep the
 issue alive. Accordingly, Western moves will
 have to be designed to dispel the widespread
 Polish popular fears of the Germans, even in
 the absence of a formal German-Polish agree-
 ment.
 In seeking this goal, the U.S. will have to
 be careful not to rupture the American-German
 relationship, on which both the unity of the
 West and internal German democracy much
 depend. A German feeling that America has
 "betrayed" them will certainly not serve the

 cause of German-Polish reconciliation. The Poles
 ought to realise this, just as the Germans should
 pcrceivc that the propitiation of Polish fears
 would deprive Moscow of a major asset and re-
 present a major step towards German reunifica-
 tion. The Germans increasingly realise that it is
 politically sclf defeating to demand German re-
 unification without defining precisely the loca-
 tion of the eastern frontiers of Germany. But
 since sudden recognition of the present frontier
 would provoke bitter resentment in Germany,
 one can only proceed by stages, designed to con-
 vince the Poles that no one in the West either
 expects or favours a change in the present
 frontiers.
 A preliminary step would be an immediate
 opening of American consulates either in
 Szczecin or Wroclaw: this would be useful both
 politically and symbolically. Further, a NATO
 pledge to oppose the use of force to change the
 existing European frontiers would also go far
 in creating the preconditions for a German-
 Polish reconciliation (it would  fortify the
 unilateral 1954 German declaration to the same
 effect). Having made such a declaration itself,
 the West German government could hardly
 object to NATO doing the same. Yet an inter-
 national Western pledge would certainly be
 more convincing to the Poles than one coming
 from Germany alone, given the possible German
 interest in changing the frontier.
 A similar declaration by the American Presi-
 dent at some appropriately symbolic occasion
 (but not during an electoral season), with specific
 reference to the desirability of ending the Polish-
 German feud, would also serve to put to rest an
 issue which simply keeps alive old hostilities,
 primarily to the advantage of the Soviet Union.
 Such a statement could perhaps even be modelled
 on the several French statements on the frontier
 issue, made without harm to the Franco-German
 relationship.  This  declaration  would  have
 special significance to the Poles, given the popu-
 larity and prestige of America in Poland.
 Finally, the Western powers could pledge in
 advance their intention to recognise formally the
 present frontiers at the moment that Germany
 I This would be in keeping with the recent
 pledge made to East Europe by Chancellor Erhard
 (October 15th, 1964): "We shall therefore leave
 nothing untried to demonstrate to these countries
 again and again that the only hindrance to a mutual
 reconciliation is the unsolved German question,
 and that for this reason an early settlement for this
 issue would be in their own best interests."
 is  reunified,  thereby  stimulating a Polish
 national interest in that reunification, even if
 the Polish Communist government should
 initially oppose it.
 FROM  THE    STANDPOINT  of advancing German
 reunification, such assurances to Poland would
 be more productive if made at a time when the
 Poles feel so insecure on the frontier issue.
 Eventually, the sense of insecurity may fade;
 the Poles may come to care less for Western
 guarantees and may derive greater security from
 the existence of the two German states. German
 policy should strive to prevent the development
 of a lasting Polish vested interest in the partition
 of Germany; it should strive to rekindle the
 bonds of sympathy and co-operation that at
 different times in history did link these two
 neighbouring states. Only then will the founda-
 tion be laid for an eventual settlement. Without
 this foundation, the Poles can hardly be expected
 to see any interest in having any settlement of
 the German issue.
 On the West German side, this may require a
 non-partisan political approach, since it has been
 said that neither of the two major parties could
 afford to give the other the opportunity of
 charging that German interests have been sacri-
 ficed. A non-partisan stand, which explicitly
 links the solemn renunciation of claims to terri-
 tories lost in the aftermath of World War II to
 German reunification, and which is presented
 to the German people as a historical contribution
 to the reconciliation of the German and Polish
 peoples, could overcome much of the inevitable
 resistance from the more nationalistic elements 2
 The cause of German-Polish reconciliation is
 growing increasingly popular among German
 youth. Moreover, prior adoption of that stand
 by the Western allies would reduce the risk of
 charges that German politicians are precipitately
 "betraying" German interests.
 In addition, the U.S. could promote specific
 undertakings, designed to forge bonds of mutual
 understanding between the Germans and the
 Poles, thereby also re-emphasising America's
 own constructive relevance to Central Europe.
 To the extent possible, three-way meetings
 could be sponsored, in addition to the various
 bilateral German-Polish activities already in
 progress. Special emphasis should be put on
 youth  activities;  collaborative humanitarian
 efforts could perhaps help to erase the recent
 memories of conflict and restore some of the
 fraternal atmosphere that prevailed among the

 Germans and the .Poles as recently as during
 "the spring of nations" of 1848.
 The Russian Obsession
 To minimise the Russian obsession with
 3. Germany. It is probably impossible to
 rr.Ulieate the deeply-grounded Russian fears of
 the Germans, 'especially in view of the relatively
 recent memories of the war. Furthermore, there
 is no doubt that the Soviet leaders find it con-
 venient to use Germany as a bogey, and accord-
 ingly will take advantage of every opportunity
 to portray West Germany as "militaristic" and
 "revanchist." Nonetheless, given the slow but
 still discernible evolutionary trends in Russian
 society, it is desirable not to stimulate counter
 pressures or to provoke needless and pointless
 irritations. It is essential to bear in mind that
 the solution for the partition of Europe (and
 hence German reunification) is not to be found
 either in the context of worsening relations be-
 tween America and Russia, or intensified Rus-
 sian and East European hostility  towards
 Germany.
 The kind of approach to avoid is exemplified
 in the proposal, occasionally voiced in West
 Germany, that China be aided as a form of
 pressure on the Russians. The political argument
 on behalf of aiding China (leaving aside the
 purely economic interest of some business circles
 in obtaining Chinese trade), is based on the
 thesis that the Soviet Union can eventually be
 induced to seek an accommodation with the
 West if it becomes fearful of a new, hostile
 encirclement. A weak and isolated China (so'
 goes the argument) cannot effectively threaten
 Russia. Furthermore, a Chinese-West German
 trade agreement, containing the Berlin clause
 (which includes West Berlin as part of the West
 German mark area), will mean the further
 isolation of East Germany and hence be a step
 towards eventual reunification. Although in
 deference to the U.S., the matter was post-
 poned until after the 1964 elections, Germans
 apparently have considered exploring the possi-
 bility of concluding with the Chinese first an
 informal trade agreement, signed perhaps by a
 consortium of German firms, to be followed
 a Nervous editorials in Neues Deutschland sug-
 gest that the East German regime was quite un-
 easy about this possibility. On October 29th, 1964,
 a commentary concludes with the hope that West
 German calculations "will not succeed because the
 leadership of the Chinese People's Republic is not
 interested in supporting West German monopoly
 capitalism."
 later by a more formal arrangement, with the
 Berlin clause in it, and even including credits.
 An even more extreme point of view has been
 taken with regard to China by those Germans
 (fortunately a minority) who fear a reduction of
 tensions between Moscow and Washington and
 who see in China an instrument for upsetting
 the existing territorial arrangements in Europe.
 The notion of a "second intermediate zone,"
 directed at both Washington and Moscow, has a
 special appeal to those who chafe under the
 apparent restraints of the American-German
 alliance and who would like to pursue a policy of
 revision with regard to the territorial status quo.
 Yet to follow this course would be to - re-
 awaken the relatively dormant European border
 disputes. This would have a highly divisive
 effect in the West, where there is a universal
 lack of support for any change in the existing
 European frontiers. In Germany itself it would
 serve to strengthen the extreme right wing and
 eventually contribute to Germany's isolation in
 the West. Moreover, it still involves a "political
 warfare" approach to the problem of German
 reunification. It could only have the effect of
 intensifying East Europe's dependence on Rus-
 sia and of stimulating a new wave of anti-
 German Russian nationalist sentiments. Such
 pressure would merely confirm to Moscow what
 it tends to assume anyway: that West Germany
 is  unalterably  hostile  and  perhaps  even
 dangerous. It is difficult to see how this would
 contribute either to the cause of German re-
 unification or to that of peace. Indeed, in a self-
 fulfilling prophecy, it could help to produce an
 implicit Russian-American alliance dedicated to
 the preservation of the European status quo,
 thereby consummating the division of Germany.
 The road to East Berlin seems hardly shorter by
 way of Peking.
 THESE CONSIDERATIONS suggest why West Ger-
 many ought to be very cautious in even explor-
 ing trade ties with China. The objective of
 further isolating East Germany is desirable and
 perhaps an agreement with China (containing
 "the Berlin clause") would serve that end.'
 But it should not be forgotten that China once
 before, in 1957, signed such an agreement (which
 later was not renewed), and that this inherently
 reduces the political import of any new arrange.
 ment. More important, to generate real "pres-
 sure" on the Soviet Union a German-Chinese
 trade agreement would have to involve a very
 major effort to underwrite Chinese industrial

 development and hence also military potential.
 Such an undertaking is hardly possible now,
 without introducing strains in the German-
 American relationship, given the continued con-
 flict between the U.S. and China. And of
 course the inherent economic obstacles to any
 single-handed Western effort to sustain the
 development of as large and backward a country
 as China are close to insuperable.
 The effect would be the opposite from that
 achieved by limited collaboration with East
 Europe. Since East Europe does not represent
 a hostile and competitive challenge to Moscow,
 closer contact with the West can serve also to
 bring the West closer to Russia; Western and
 particularly German aid to China, Russia's
 "'For us, Central Europe is vital because it is a
 matter of life and death. It is a question of our
 survival. We think that neutrality would be a great
 danger  in  Central  Europe,  because  neutrality
 means a vacuum, and it would be a vacuum be-
 tween the immense mass of Soviet military might
 and what would be left of Western Europe, that
 is, France, the Benelux countries, and Italy." Couve
 de Murville, Interview, U.S. News and World
 Report (March 16th, 1964).
 American disengagement from Europe would
 also be politically  self-defeating,  "for nothing
 thrusts Germans more rapidly towards a Gaullist
 view of the world-or towards thoughts of a deal
 of their own with Russia-than fear of American
 disengagement from Europe." Robert Kleiman,
 The Atlantic Crisis (1964). For a good review of
 the various disengagement plans, see E. 1=Iinterhoff,
 Disengagement (1959).
 More recently, some warmed-over versions of the
 plan rested on the premise that the American role
 in Europe is finished and that a joint Soviet-Ameri-
 can disengagement would restore both European
 stability and unity. For example, see the somewhat
 obscure and pontificating attack on NATO by Ronald
 Steel, The End of Alliance (1964)-
 5 In this connection, there is an illusion shared
 by some that a West German military build-up
 may some day become a useful basis for bargaining
 with the Soviet Union: East Germany for the de-
 nuclearisation of West Germany. The fact is, how-
 ever, that the development of armed forces creates
 a vested interest. Subsequently, it becomes incon-
 ceivable that these forces be sacrificed, in toto or
 even in part, in return for Soviet political conces-
 sions, b :cause then the argument is raised that
 unity is. purchased at the price of dependence.
 Since (ire the meantime) the Soviet defensive stake
 in East. Germany would have been increased, re-
 armameitt as a bargaining device is an illusion.
 It is also wrong to think that the U.S. might be
 able to trade German participation in an MLF or in
 nuclear planning for Soviet concessions. Nothing is
 more l kely to undermine Western confidence in
 American protection than the thought that Western
 collecti- e security measures may be subject to bi-
 lateral American-Soviet negotiations.
 growing challenger, could hardly induce in the
 Russians a pro-Western orientation. Thus if
 trade develops between Germany and China,
 as well it might for purely economic reasons,
 the Germans would be well advised not to give
 it a political flavour or to strive to expand it
 artificially for political purposes.
 A MORE DIFFICULT PROBLEM in the Russian atti-
 tude towards Germany is raised by the issue
 of military security. In facing it, certain basic
 facts must be recognised: Germany is now re-
 armed conventionally; it is not going to be
 disarmed; no one in the West would contem-
 plate that task and it could not be undertaken
 without fragmenting the West. Thus all schemes
 advocating the "military neutralisation" of West
 Germany are politically unrealistic. The Central
 European problem cannot be solved by drastic
 changes in the existing security structure-
 faulty. and tense though it may be-for the
 problem is basically a political one, and the
 military situation is its consequence. Political
 changes will have to precede the military
 changes; and political changes, as both sides
 have now learned, can only come gradually.
 The creation of a "neutral" or disengaged
 vacuum through the co-operative efforts of the
 two adversary super-powers-leaving aside its
 general improbability, given West German and
 even French opposition to it'-would simply
 mean the creation of new "hunting grounds"
 for the two opposed sides, unless that step was
 preceded by profound changes in their political
 goals. by that time the scheme would no longer
 be necessary.
 Rejecting disengagement is not tantamount to
 standing pat on the present division of Europe,
 nor does it justify the argument for the indepen-
 dent development of a militarily powerful West
 Europe. The legitimate Western interest in Ger-
 many's defensive forces ought not to obscure
 the fact that under certain circumstances it may
 increase the Soviet military stake in East Ger-
 many. Again, this is not a matter for "either/
 or" solutions. It is now probably idle to speculate
 whether Germany should have been denied
 rocket weapons or kept out entirely from the
 nuclear club (especially given the complications
 of the France-American rivalry). However, the
 possibility should not be excluded that under
 certain conditions it might be desirable for
 Germany to limit its further military build-up,
 in view of the historically founded Russian fear
 of Germany.'

 It is therefore not too late to note that the
 cause of German reunification is not likely to be
 served by the development of an independent
 German national nuclear force. To the extent
 that the Russians and the East Europeans
 strongly suspect that the MLF-or some Atlantic
 nuclear force-is a first step precisely in that
 direction, it is in the interest both of Germany
 and the West to disabuse them of that impres-
 sion. Accordingly the United States might he
 well advised to reiterate formally and more ex-
 plicitly the position taken in this regard by
 President Kennedy in his Izvestia (November
 1961) interview. Germany might also derive
 political advantages from filing a formal declara-
 tion with the U.N. to the effect that under no
 circumstances will it seek an independent
 nuclear deterrent outside of multilateral control
 and management e
 Similarly, more thought should be given to
 the political implications of providing West
 Germany with rockets capable of striking
 directly at the Soviet Union. While still subject
 to the "two-key" system of control, the availa-
 bility of such rockets to the West German armed
 forces brings Russia directly within reach of
 German striking power for the first time since
 World War II. This cannot but intensify the
 Russian, Polish, and Czech feelings that a
 divided Germany is preferable to a united one.
 In this situation West Germany stands to lose
 little-and perhaps to gain a great deal-by
 repeatedly offering to conclude bilateral non-
 aggression treaties with the East European
 states and by reiterating past pledges never to
 use force against the security and territorial
 integrity of its neighbours.
 6 See  my  "Moscow  and  the  MLF:  Hostility
 and Ambivalence," Foreign Affairs (October 1964).
 This suggestion was subsequently seconded by
 Senator J. William Fulbright in November 1964.
 ' Those who advocate the development of the
 power of the West without much regard. for its
 impact on the East inadvertently perpetuate the
 division of Germany. See, for example, Dean
 Acheson, "Withdrawal from Europe? An Illusion,"
 The New York Times Magazine (December 15th,
 1963). That is also why the opposite point of view
 as expressed by George Kennan, namely, that East
 Germany should at least transitionally be accepted
 ("Polycentrism  and  Western  Policy,"  Foreign
 Affairs, January 1964) is also undesirable. Formal
 acceptance of the status quo would inevitably
 prompt dissension among the West Germans and
 the Americans and permit the Russians to have
 their cake and eat it too.
 IN A NUTSHELL, Western military policy should
 always strive to meet three basic requirements:
 to provide an adc quite defence of West Europe;
 to develop a satisfactory distribution of respon-
 sibility in order to cope with the political prob-
 lems of the Al',iance; and, without sacrificing
 either of the preceding, to avoid a negative
 political feedbac 1: to the East. The last considera-
 tion has been most often neglected, even though
 it has become all the more important since the
 West is now increasingly inclined to promote
 "evolutionary changes in the East." In our
 preoccupatior with Western security we often
 tend to forgc-.t that the world looks quite
 different fro.n the Russian and East European
 perspective, and that the history and psychology
 of the adver!;ary must be taken into account,
 especially when our policy has as its ultimate
 objective the peaceful resolution of existing
 differences a.nd a peaceful change in the status
 quo.
 It cannot. be stressed too often that no basic
 change in the division of Germany can be
 expected t.ntil such time as the Russians and the
 East Et:r,.)peans are prepared to accept the re-
 unificanon of Germany. Such acceptance will
 require at some point a qualitative change in
 their :rutlook. The way to it is by gradual,
 marginal steps, carefully calculated to bring
 about a situation whereby some day Moscow
 and i he East Europeans discover that they no
 longs  have any stake in East Germany (as in
 1955 in the case of Austria).'
 A- this stage the basic preconditions for a
 Ger.nan reunification that involve neither a
 Communist take-over (a maximum Soviet goal)
 not a unilateral Soviet pull-out (a maximum
 Western goal) can be outlined only in very
 ge coral terms:
 ,,a) The Soviet position in East Europe must
 h::ve changed to the point where the East
 European states are no longer pliant tools and
 Last Germany has become an isolated Soviet
 colony, still entirely dependent on Soviet gar-
 risons. It is clearly within the power of the West
 to exert some influence to bring about this
 coiidition.
 (b) Poland and Czechoslovakia, at least on the
 broad popular level, must have ceased to view
 Germany as a territorially revisionist power;
 they must no longer feel the need of a Soviet
 presence in East Germany, and must have
 ceased to be responsive to Soviet manipulation
 of the German bogey. Here, too, the West can
 exert influence by providing explicit guarantees

 of East European national and territorial in-
 tegrity.
 (c) The Soviet Union and the East European
 states must have been guaranteed that East
 Germany, once united with the rest of the
 country, will not become an outpost of NATO.
 This the West could certainly promise in
 advance. For example, commitments and arrange-
 ments could be made for an agreed period
 of time to keep East Germany a demilitarised
 area. While one German government would
 .exercise sovereignty in all of Germany, only the
 present western part would remain in NATO
 (assuming the organisation still existed), while
 in the present eastern part U.N. peace-keeping
 forces would temporarily be stationed. From the
 Soviet point of view, a more acceptable alterna-
 tive could involve the transitional retention for
 some years of Soviet garrisons in East Germany,
 even though the country will have been re-
 united under one political authority (in effect,
 the Austrian precedent). Furthermore, the resi-
 dual Polish and Czech fears of Germany would
 provide reassurance to Moscow that a new
 cordon sanitaire was not being created on its
 frontiers.
 (d) The economic benefits now flowing from
 East Germany to  COMECON  and to the Soviet
 Union must be maintained. This too is within
 the power of the West to assure. East Germany
 is the Soviet Union's principal economic partner
 and the Soviet Union's economic stake in East
 Germany is considerable. Substitute arrange-
 ments could be made bilaterally by Germany,
 or if such should develop, within a broader
 framework of European economic co-operation.
 However, for all of this to happen, more general
 changes in the East-West economic relationship
 will be required.
 Economics and Culture
 4  To relate the expansion of economic ties
 . to more extensive cultural and social con-
 tacts. In the expansion of East-West trade, the
 West should attempt to erode the narrow ideo-
 logical perspectives of the ruling Communist
 elites and to prevent them from restricting
 closer contact exclusively to the economic realm,
 thus resolving their economic difficulties while
 consolidating their power and perpetuating the
 present partition of Europe. The Communist
 leaders, with their public pleas for closer com-
 mercial relations (including Western credit..),
 have been successful in representing themselves
 as the apostles of international co-operation.
 Western statesmen should be as vocal in stress-
 ing that concrete improvements in cultural
 relations, more intellectual dialogue and free-
 dom of expression are as important as trade in
 creating genuine co-operative relationships. The
 two should always be related in every East-West
 negotiation.
 The economic situation in East Europe and
 (to a lesser extent) in the Soviet Union has
 arrived at a rather critical point. These countries
 desire closer economic relations with the West
 and in some cases even large Western credits.
 This makes East-West trade a potential Western
 asset, and it should be used to advantage. Those
 in the West who oppose the expansion of such
 trade on the grounds that it helps the Com-
 munist governments overlook the fact that, first
 of all, such trade will grow in spite of American
 objections and that, secondly, to the extent that
 such trade and credits are badly needed by the
 Communists, they could be useful as sources of
 leverage.
 The Communist leaders have made it plain that .
 they see in the "eventual economic superiority"
 of their system the way to victory. Helping their
 economic development can be justified only if at
 the same time other consequences follow, result-
 ing in the erosion of the Communist commitment
 to domination, in structural reforms in the Com-
 munist economic systems, in the growth of
 closer contacts, in an increasingly free flow of
 ideas and people.
 These changes will not take place spon-
 tatLeously, but as a result of steady pressure.
 Economic difficulties in the East stimulate in-
 tense power conflicts and tend to loosen the
 Communist structure. It should not be forgotten
 that the strongest impulses towards liberalisa-
 tion-the Malenkov period in Russia and the
 later  Khrushchev  period  of economic  de-
 centralisation, the first Nagy period in Hungary
 and the recent reforms in Czechoslovakia-came
 because there were severe economic crises. They
 strengthened the hands of those who argued on
 behalf of liberalising the system; they under-
 mined the position of those who wished to
 avoid making a choice between political totali-
 tarianism and economic reforms. It is no acci-
 dent that foreign trade officials of the Com-
 munist countries are foremost among those who
 advocate structural reforms in their economic
 system. An indiscriminate Western approach to
 trade and credits merely plays into the hands
 of those ruling Communist officials who would

 like to  avoid  making  substantial  internal
 changes .6
 Precisely because acceptance of Western aid
 and development of trade with the West is no
 longer proscribed as heretical by the Com-
 munists, the West needs to define for itself a
 clearer political perspective on the problem of
 East-West trade. It will not do to view it, as
 often is the case among otherwise conservative
 and staunchly anti-Communist businessmen, as
 merely an opportunity for profit-making, the
 more so because once the gates have been opened
 it becomes increasingly difficult to control
 economic appetites. Advance precautions will
 have to be taken to preserve a proper political
 perspective. Perhaps trade can be considered to
 be purely an economic issue when it takes place
 spontaneously, on the basis of reciprocal needs
 and advantages of the trading parties. But when
 such trade has to be artificially stimulated by
 Western governments, when such trade is fos-
 tered in the context of continued political and
 ideological conflict, and when the Western
 businessmen who wish to extend credits to the
 East at the same time desire their governments
 to underwrite these credits, such commercial re-
 lations cease to be purely an economic matter.
 IN  VERY  BROAD  TERMS,  American and West
 European economic assistance policy with re-
 spect to East Europe should be guided by two
 criteria: whenever a country increases the scope
 of its external independence from Soviet con-
 trol,                           or liberalises appreciably its domestic
 system, it should be rewarded. And similarly
 whenever an opposite trend develops, the West
 should be prepared to discontinue its assistance,
 withdraw special privileges (such as the U.S.
 "most-favoured-nation" clause, a matter of vital
 importance to the East Europeans), and should
 not hesitate to indicate the real reasons involved.
 aGiving aid to individual Communist states and
 letting them use it as they see fit is exactly what
 Molotov proposed in 1947, in response to the Mar-
 shall Plan invitation. It was unacceptable then and
 there is no reason to feel that it should be accent-
 able now. For details, see Harry B. Price, The
 Marshall Plan and its Meaning (Ithaca, 1955).
 9I-Iowever, the use of surplus food for this pur-
 pose is ill-advised, for it creates the impression
 that the U.S. is playing politics with people's
 hunger. Accordingly, the U.S. would be wise to
 avoid making surplus food the princinal com-
 mod;ty extended to countries to be influenced
 politically. Once granted, it becomes almost impos-
 sible to withdraw (e.g., the difficulties with Nasser).
 Given East Europe's acute need for foreign
 capital investment, the flexible use of American
 long-term credits in this regard could be an
 important factor for change.
 That is why it is cause for regret that the
 U.S. Congress has been so rigid with regard
 to the "most-favoured-nation" clause and to the
 application of Public Law 4$o to Communist
 countries. Legislative restrictions on economic
 policy towards the Communist states automati-
 cally restrict the power of the executive to
 negotiate with the Communist states. Increasing
 the executive's room for manoeuvre would in-
 crease its ability to negotiate concessions from
 the Communist states in exchange for more
 trade and credit?
 To be sure, it is difficult to use economic rela-
 tions simply as a spigot, turning them on and
 off. Applied too obviously, such leverage could
 become self-defeating, making trade relations
 with the West seem undesirable to the East
 European countries. Furthermore, it would be
 pointless to react to every unfavourable domestic
 turn in East Europe, given its political flux, by
 turning on economic pressures. Indeed, there is
 some long-range advantage in developing a
 relatively stable level in trade relations with
 East Europe as that inescapably helps to widen
 the range of its contacts with the West.
 Unlike the case of East Europe, it is diffi-
 cult at the present to see any political advantage
 in granting long-term credits to the Soviet
 Union. The West has no political interest in
 promoting Soviet economic development, or in-
 directly subsidising Soviet economic aid pro-
 grammes, designed to reduce Western influence
 and to increase Soviet prestige in the develop-
 ing countries, not to mention Soviet arms ex-
 ports and efforts to encourage subversion. The
 argument that "a fat Communist is a good
 Communist" is too patently specious to be taken
 seriously. One need only speculate what the
 Soviet attitude would be if a Western economy
 needed Soviet credits for further development
 and what conditions then the Soviet Union
 would try to impose. Therefore, limits on long-
 term credits to the Soviet Union should be
 maintained. Private enterprises which are per-
 mitted under special circumstances to extend
 longer term credits should do so at their own
 risk and not be entitled to government guaran-
 tees. The recently concluded trade agreements
 between West Germany and some of the East
 European states demonstrate that marginal
 political concessions can be sought and obtained

 in exchange for trade. The West Germans were
 wise at the same time not to demand too much
 (e.g., a rupture of relations with. the Ulbricht
 regime).
 Examples of marginal concessions which
 could be sought in exchange for a liberalised
 trade policy and for Western credits include
 rules governing' access to Berlin, thereby mini-
 mising Soviet opportunities for mischief-making
 arising out of the absence of formal rules guid-
 ing that access; binding and applicable consular
 agreements with all the Communist states; the
 admission and free circulation of the Western
 press; more extensive and less regimented cul-
 tural  exchanges;  relaxation  of  Communist
 controls on travel of their citizens to the West10
 IN THE CASE of actual aid to the East European
 states, either by grants or credits, it is important
 that symbolic items of a lasting nature be also
 included. This facet of the problem has been
 almost entirely neglected. Few Russians remem-
 ber to-day that millions of Russian lives were
 saved in the early 'twenties by the Hoover
 missions. Decades from now few Egyptians
 might remember the free distribution of Ameri-
 can food, but the Russian-built Aswan dam will
 remind them of Russian aid. Accordingly, at
 least some of the assistance extended occa-
 sionally ought to be earmarked for undertakings
 which represent a lasting investment in popular
 good-will. For example, the reconstruction of
 the Royal Castle in Warsaw with American
 funds (like the Rockefeller-financed restoration
 '"To promote such travel, the Americans and
 West Europeans might be well advised to consider
 lifting existing visa restrictions, especially with re-
 gard to the East European youth. It might be
 possible to consider a scheme whereby East Euro-
 pean students are freely admitted for visits to the
 West  and  benefit  from  special  arrangements
 designed to overcome the East European shortage
 of hard currency. For example, thought could be
 given to a plan under which the East Europeans
 would be permitted to exchange their currency at
 the frontier for convertible Western funds with the
 East European currency thus acquired then used by
 the West to finance common East-West under-
 takings designed to establish closer contacts: fellow-
 ships for worthy students, perhaps funds for West
 European tourists travelling in the East, highway
 systems, waterways, all of which would have the
 desirable effects.
 "The  American-built  children's  hospital  in
 Cracow, scheduled for completion in x966, is a
 good precedent. This venture, however, was con-
 ceived and executed by a private individual, who
 had to overcome obstacles on both sides of the
 ocean,
 of Versailles) would be a fitting symbol, con-
 trasting favourably with the generally un-
 popular Soviet-built Stalin Palace of Culture
 that dominates the Warsaw skyline. Better yet,
 the offer to construct a modern housing district
 in the war-devastated Polish capital would cer-
 tainly have a major impact, regardless of
 official response. Joint American-West German
 financing of such a scheme might also be bene-
 ficial, given the desirability of healing the
 Polish-German hostility." In Czechoslovakia or
 Hungary the offers to construct and operate
 schools of business administration and/or agri-
 cultural colleges have a real impact, given the
 present difficulties faced by the Communist
 governments in these areas. Similar gestures
 elsewhere would provide symbolic proof of the
 West's desire to bridge the political and ideo-
 logical partition of Europe.
 Western scholarships have already made a
 considerable contribution to bringing closer to-
 gether the intellectual communities of the two
 sides. In this connection it is important to
 make certain that scholarships for study in
 the West, especially in the U.S.-an opportunity
 most eagerly sought in the Eastern states and
 one providing enormous personal prestige to the
 recipients-are not misused as awards for loyalty
 to the Communist regimes and ideology. This
 danger is implicit in arrangements that leave
 the nominating process entirely in the hands of
 the Communist governments concerned. Obvi-
 ously, no Communist government will permit
 foreign institutions to reward its political oppo-
 nents; the point is that more of a systematic
 effort should be made in the West to be aware
 of those scholars and intellectuals who have
 demonstrated both creativity and intellectual in-
 tegrity and to insist that Western-financed
 fellowships not be awarded on the basis of other
 criteria. Unfortunately, departures from this
 standard have occassionally occurred, with some
 demoralising effects within the East European
 intellectual community. To the extent that the
 Communist governments are gradually becom-
 ing more sensitive to their own public opinion
 (and to the extent that the intellectual com-
 munity certainly has been pressing for closer
 contacts with the West), the West should be-
 come more vigorous in asserting its own stan-
 dards, while continuously and openly insisting
 that closer-economic contacts must be paralleled
 by closer and freer cultural relations.
 A special issue arises with respect to the role
 of East European public opinion. The present

 diversity in the Communist world has made
 the Communist leaders more responsive to the
 attitudes of the people. It would be counter-
 productive to focus U.S. and Western policy on
 the sole goal of improving relations with the
 present governments and to abandon efforts both
 to inform and. to shape East European public
 opinion. The 1964 trip by Robert Kennedy to
 Poland, with its direct access to the masses,
 provided a good illustration of how relation-
 ships with the people can occasionally be estab-
 lished. It is incorrect to dismiss this as merely
 an empty gesture or to argue that it complicates
 relations with the governments in power. Culti-
 vation of these relations, it should always be
 remembered, is a means to an end and not the
 end in itself. A certain amount of direct popu-
 lar appeal is desirable to keep alive pro-Wcstern
 popular sentiment and stimulate it anew. The
 Communist  leaders,  especially  Khrushchev,
 have done this on their trips to the West; there
 is no reason for Western leaders to be more
 reticent in appealing directly to the people.
 East and West
 5 To promote multilateral ties with West
 . Euro pe and East Europe. As direct Soviet
 control wanes, as East European nationalism
 (even under Communist leadership) reasserts
 itself, as the East-West dichotomy becomes less
 sharp, it should be an explicit goal of U.S. and
 Western policy to promote multilateral political
 and economic relations, lest East Europe-and
 even all of Europe-become Balkanised.
 Closer  multilateral  European  ties  would
 eventually render superfluous the present semi-
 totalitarian East European regimes which thrive
 on isolation; involvement in all-European under-
 takings would mellow their ideology and would
 inhibit  the  tendency already  noted   for
 some  of  them  to  become  more    autono-
 mous national-Communist technocratic dictator-
 ships. A Rumanian-style external independence
 with a semi-Stalinist dictatorship at home is not
 enough; a Hungarian-style internal liberalisation
 with almost complete external dependence on the
 Soviet Union is also not enough. The two pro-
 cesses should be linked, but the West cannot
 encourage that to happen from the positions
 of the Cold War. That is why economic
 assistance is important, but employed construc-
 tively with a long-range goal in mind. Had
 more of an effort been made in the early 'fifties
 to draw Yugoslavia into all-European activities,
 perhaps some of its recent drift towards more
 regimentation at home and closer identification
 with the Communist world abroad might have
 been averted.
 Therefore, in subsequent relations with states
 that have nationally asserted themselves, it is
 essential to emphasise their gradual internal
 liberalisation and the creation of more binding
 multilateral links with the developing European
 community. The response to such Western
 approaches is likely to be twofold: an effort to
 achieve a compromise with the West, thereby
 meeting some of its concerns; and, to prevent
 absorption by the West, avoidance of a com-
 plete break with Moscow. This would contribute
 to the desirable evolutionary trends in the
 region as a whole, both with regard to more
 autonomy and evolutionary liberalisation.
 A policy of bilateral differentiation made
 political sense in a period when Soviet control
 in East Europe was solid, because it weakened
 Soviet hegemony. In the period of greater East
 European. diversity, bilateral relations of in-
 dividual East European states with the West
 cease to have the same desirable effect. And just
 as in the West multilateral economic relations
 became the first step on the long road towards
 a broader political solution, so in the East-West
 European relationship the beginnings of a
 multilateral economic approach could pave the
 way to an eventual political reconciliation.
 Economic assistance to the East European coun-
 tries inevitably has to begin on a bilateral basis,
 in conjunction with the expansion of other re-
 lationships. However, it should be clear that it
 is neither in the interest of East Europe nor
 of Europe as a whole to assist the economic
 development of individual East European states
 entirely on a bilateral basis, for this will resolve
 neither their specific economic problems nor
 the basic political issues dividing Europe.
 THE TIME MAY HAVE COME to create a special fund
 for underwriting multilateral East-West econo-
 mic projects. Hungary, for example, has been
 eager to undertake common industrial enter-
 prises with Western partners. The creation of
 a special fund to assist such endeavours would
 encourage greater  economic  multilateralism.
 Also, to the extent possible, the multilateral
 West European institutions could make it a
 matter of policy to hire the quite numerous
 East European specialists now resident in West
 Europe in order to train a cadre of "'European

 states should be invited to permit their surplus
 working force to participate in the European
 labour market. Some East European countries
 suffer  from   hidden  unemployment,  while
 France, Switzerland, and Germany badly need
 labour and import it from afar. Greater East-
 West tabour mobility could be beneficial to all
 concerned while also undermining the existing

 member states. It would mean greater contacts
 with a major supranational European organisa-
 tion and hence it would have the effect of draw-
 ing the Communist states into a more involved
 relationship with Europe.13 Perhaps as a pre-
 liminary step, some third institution (viz., the
 Ford Foundation, which has sponsored many
 East-West conferences) may find it desirable to
 sponsor special conferences on the subject of
 the Common Market to which Eastern Euro-
 pean and Soviet economists would be invited.
 A more flexible and less ideological Com-
 munist attitude towards Western multilateralism
 may pave the way to other measures that could
 be economically beneficial to the Communist
 states and could serve to unite Europe. The
 domestic acceptance by the Communist states
 of world prices as a basis for their pricing system
 would facilitate multilateral trade, now in part
 inhibited by the arbitrary and incalculable Com-
 munist pricing system. Consideration could be
 given to special arrangements providing for the
 accession of Communist states to some sort of
 association with the oECO, or at least of inviting
 them into particular phases of work that con-
 cern them. The advantages of East European

 give them an indirect share in the economic
 decision-making of greater powers;  (2)  they
 would benefit from a certain amount of pooling

 and development; (3) they could take advantage

 vides to less developed states. Some members
 of the OECD have insisted on being categorised
 as less developed states so that they could bene-
 fit from such technical aid" East European
 participation in the OECD would thus symbolise
 the triumph of the Western conception of Euro-
 pean multilateral development, while also bene-
 fiting the East European nations economically.
 THY,  DEVELOPMENT  on a multilateral basis of
 economic relations between the East and the
 West could gradually pave the way for progress
 in the more sensitive field of politics. It would
 minimise the fear of the East European ruling
 elites that the West's intent is to absorb the
 East European states one by one. It would work
 against the revival of historically retrogressive
 inner-oriented nationalist states. With progress
 in increasing economic, cultural, and human
 contacts, consideration in turn could be given to
 more formal steps on the political level. For
 example, the formation could be explored of a
 standing committee of prominent East and West
 Europeans (also with Soviet and American
 participation) for the purpose of periodically
 examining and discussing East-West relations.
 14 Finland, which for political reasons must be
 extremely careful not to offend the Soviet Union,
 participates in OECD through observers and specifi.
 cally in regard to matters affecting its basic indus-
 tries.  Yugoslavia,  which  has  recently  become
 associated with eoMECON, is a full member for
 confrontation of economic policies, scientific and
 technical matters, agriculture and fisheries ques-
 tions, technical assistance and productivity, and par-
 ticipates through observers in other matters. Yugo-
 slavia and Finland could both serve as useful
 precedents for the other East European states.
 15 Whereas in many places in the world the
 United States seems to be losing its hold on popular
 imagination, in East Europe it is still viewed in
 highly idealised terms as the society of to-morrow,
 a feeling strengthened by personal bonds with
 many millions of Americans of East European
 origin. Symptomatic of the feeling of the youth
 was the finding of a survey conducted in Warsaw
 during the Communist May, Day Youth Celebra-
 tion: when asked where they would like to go
 if all restrictions were lifted, the universal answer
 was "America." (See Z. Bauman, Kariera, Warsaw
 1960.)
 A formal standing committee, on the model of
 the various precedents that paved the way for
 the West European unification efforts, would
 have an advantage over the occasional ad hoc
 bilateral and multilateral East-West conferences,
 for it could gradually develop into a working
 body with a professional staff, in effect creating
 the first nucleus of functional all-European
 bodies.
 It is to be expected that the Soviet Union
 would wish to take advantage of any multi-
 lateral forum to enhance 'the status of its East
 German regime. However, with the passage of
 time and with progress in the areas of policy
 already discussed, it' may be expected that not
 all of the East European states would give
 Moscow complete and unilateral backing on
 that issue. Some of them may be tempted to
 become involved in all-European undertakings,
 even if it does mean that East Germany is ex-
 cluded from them, provided some face-saving
 device could be found.
 The development of multilateral ties also
 within East Europe would be desirable as a
 stepping stone towards a larger European com-
 munity. Since much of the tragic history of
 East Europe can be traced to its internal
 divisions, there may be a special merit for the
 United States, which continues to enjoy un-
 equalled prestige among the East European
 peoples,'s to go on public record as favouring
 the eventual formation of an East European
 confederation,  thereby emulating the West
 European development.  Historically all the
 foreign efforts to "organise" East Europe have
 been associated with hostile designs to dominate
 the region. No one in East Europe could suspect
 hegemonistic designs on the part of the United
 States if, at some appropriately historic and
 symbolic occasion, the President was to outline
 in bold terms the hope for an East Europe that
 would rise above its traditional divisions and
 assume a more prominent role in the shaping of
 the future Europe. With the decline in Soviet
 control and with the weakening of the ideo-
 logical commitment of the ruling East Euro-
 pean elites, the resulting East European void
 could be filled by an idea that is in keeping
 especially with the widespread but often un-
 articulated aspirations of the younger generation
 to surmount the old divisions. Otherwise, there
 is the danger that as the Communist elites
 become "nationalised," the old antagonism will
 be rekindled and even exploited by internal and
 external forces.

 Such a U.S. statement might be particularly
 timely because many East Europeans (including
 even officials) are concerned that the new
 American-Soviet stability might result in East
 Europe becoming again a backyard of interna-
 tional politics-an area to be occasionally ex-
 ploited in order to put pressure on the Soviet
 Union, but otherwise left to its own devices and
 to its own more powerful neighbours, including
 eventually also Germany. That is why a con-
 structive policy statement defining the hopes for
 the future development of East Europe would
 have more than merely a propaganda effect.
 Even if initially criticised by the Communist
 press as "interference," it would inevitably give
 a new sense of direction to many East Euro-
 peans who are concerned about their future but
 see no one providing them with a constructive
 alternative to the present.
 From Confrontation to Co-operation
 UN T I L  Now, most East-West agreements
 have been negotiated during periods of
 tension and crisis. Since most of the crises were
 initiated by Soviet efforts to change the status
 quo, the initiative has tended to rest with
 Moscow. The settlements (with the exception of
 the Austrian Treaty and the Test Ban Agree-
 ment) involved merely the restoration of the
 previous situation. In the present post-Cuba
 detente there is a broader opportunity for the
 'Vest to come to grips with the basic problem
 of East-West relations. By taking the initiative
 America would point up the wider European
 scope of Western policy and also accelerate the
 tendencies in the East which are favourable to
 closer East-West relations. The appropriate con-
 tent of such an initiative would be economic,
 since this is the most sensitive point in Eastern
 Europe, and since the possibility of East-West
 economic co-operation has achieved a certain
 ideological respectability in Eastern Europe.
 To that end, a proposal should be addressed
 to the European powers, including Russia, to
 join with America and Western Europe in
 formulating a joint all-European economic de-
 velopment plan. The Plan would be designed
 to cut across the present European partition,
 to narrow existing disparities in European
 living standards, to reduce the economic and
 political significance of existing frontiers, and
 to promote East-West trade and human contacts
 by the development of an all-European system
 of communications. The proposal would be a
 fitting climax to past American efforts to foster
 the unity of Western Europe, to bring about
 closer contacts between East and West, and in
 this context to build a stable relationship be-
 tween Germany and East Europe. In such a plan
 American financial participation would be con-
 ditioned on complementary efforts by Western
 Europe. Britain and Europe could participate
 as an entity by creating a special fund to finance
 East-West trade and common European invest-
 ment projects, or by extending the scope and
 the size of both the Development Fund and the
 European Investment Bank. Working out new
 trade agreements with the East in the context
 of a larger plan of East-West economic activity
 would accelerate also the process of West Euro-
 pean co-operation.
 A venture of this kind would take advantage
 of the West's economic strength, of economic
 pressures in the East, and of the growing appeal
 of "the European idea" in Eastern Europe in
 contrast to the waning attraction of Communist
 ideology. There is reason to hope that West
 Europeans would be ready to make the contri-
 butions necessary to bring this collective enter-
 prise into being. For example, a 1962 poll
 showed a large majority of the West Europeans
 in favour of using national taxes to promote the
 development of the poorer regions of Europe
 (while a small majority opposed the same for
 Africa). That West Europe could contribute sub-
 stantial capital is suggested by the present size
 of 'Vest German commitments to international
 development: $1,050 million to the capital stock
 of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
 Development, $200 million to the development
 fund of the EEe, $300 million to the European
 Investment Bank. Together with contributions
 from the other Western European states and
 from the United States, a proposal of this kind
 would have a dramatic appeal in both Eastern
 and Western Europe.
 The proposal would be premised on a phased
 reunification of Germany and on an implicit
 acceptance by the East of the principle that the
 reconstruction of Europe would involve in time
 the reunification of Germany. A general plan
 of European economic co-operation, involving
 multilateral Western participation and open
 both to Russia and to East Europe, would be
 more acceptable in the East than any bilateral
 attempt by West Germany "to buy" East Ger-
 many in exchange for credits to Russia, as has
 at times been proposed in the West German
 press and repeatedly rejected by the East. A

 direct German-Russian relationship would create
 :mars and opposition in East Europe, not to
 speak of suspicions of "a new Rapailo" in the
 West. Only a solution of the German problem
 in the context of broader East-West co-operation
 could reasonably assure both that the conse-
 quence of unification will not be the fragmenta-
 don of one side or the other.
 No DOUBT the Soviet Union would try to take
 advantage of a proposal of this kind to legalise
 the existence of the two German states by insist-
 ing that East Germany should formally partici-
 pate in any all-European undertaking. Yet it is
 by no means certain that, if the West takes the
 steps already suggested to reassure the East
 Europeans on the German question, the Soviet
 Union would be able to count on the solid sup-
 port of the East European states. The idea of
 "rejoining Europe" would generate popular en-
 thusiasm in East Europe. The economic oppor-
 tunity thereby presented would doubtless be
 attractive to the harassed East European econo-
 mic cadres. The economic character of the pro-
 posal would diminish the suspicions of the
 political elites. Increasingly concerned with their
 own well-being, these governments might be
 receptive to a formula excluding East German
 participation on the grounds that East Germany
 benefits already from advantageous bilateral
 economic arrangements with West Germany.
 If actually launched, and in operation for a
 period of years, such unprecedented multilateral
 economic co-operation would sooner or later
 create a favourable context for resolving peace-
 fully the many outstanding European political
 and security problems." In the new atmosphere,
 it might be possible to find solutions for the
 more intractable problems of arms control; to
 achieve perhaps a freeze on nuclear weapons;
 and even to explore again various regional
 security schemes. In the present hostile con-
 frontation it is unavoidable that each side
 assumes that any security scheme proposed by
 the other has ulterior motives.
 Of course, the Soviet Union may reject any
 such co-operative venture; or, more likely, it
 may equivocate and attempt to shift the focus
 of the proposal to direct grants to individual
 Communist states, thereby frustrating the un-
 derlying purpose of the initiative. Yet at least
 some of the East European states would surely
 be attracted, and there would be great popular
 pressure in East Europe for participation. It is
 by no means certain that a Soviet refusal would
 be automatically followed by East European
 refusals, as happened with the Marshall Plan.
 Indeed, one should not assume that the Soviets
 will reject it indefinitely.
 In assessing possible Soviet reaction, one must
 recognise that the general evolutionary trend in
 Russia towards a more European orientation is
 counterbalanced by increasing Russian national-
 ism and even chauvinism, and by the power
 interests of the bureaucratic technocratic dic-
 tatorship which is likely to continue to dominate
 the Soviet political scene. It is quite possible
 that the ruling elite may justify their power by
 emphasising the global competition with the
 United States, building on the desire of many
 Russians to become "the Number One world
 power." It is therefore quite possible that the
 Soviets may be unwilling to participate in any
 scheme which would involve eventual reunifica-
 tion of Germany and lessening of Russian con-
 trol over East Europe. For this reason, Western
 policy must reckon both with the possibility of
 a favourable Soviet evolution, and with persist-
 ing Soviet hostility.
 The  proposed  initiative  for  all-European
 economic co-operation does just this. If the
 favourable Soviet evolution, foreseen in this
 article, comes to pass, the proposal opens the
 way for the Soviet Union and East Europe to
 move towards a grand settlement and recon-
 ciliation with the West. If Soviet hostility per-
 sists, the proposal would put increased strain
 on the Soviet control of East Europe. It would
 magnify the cost of Soviet domination by giving
 the East Europeans new leverage to extract
 greater Soviet economic assistance in return for
 their rejecting the Western initiative. Thus, the
 initiative is desirable on either assumption
 about  the  trends  of  Soviet  developments.
 Once   made,   the  proposal  would    become
 an objective force, just as Khrushchev's bold
 disarmament  proposals gave Soviet foreign
 policy a certain positive momentum, though
 they were never implemented. The initiative
 could revivify the West and attract the East,
 irrespective of formal acceptances or refusals.
 Its positive appeal would doubtless create at
 least some divisions of opinion in Moscow and
 might help the moderate forces in Soviet society.
 THE READER WILL NOT HAVE failed to note the
 historical connection between the proposal here
 made and the original proposal of the Marshall
 Plan. The immense political force of a far-
 reaching initiative, made at the right time, was

 never  more  clearly  demonstrated.  In  the
 eloquent words of its chronicler, Harry Price:
 The Marshall Plan demonstrated that the free
 nations can seize the initiative in the East-West
 struggle if goals are set which exert a wide and
 potent appeal and if enough intelligence, energy,
 and resources are devoted to the attainment of
 these goals.
 The Plan began with an idea. It was an idea
 which satisfied a widely felt yearning and fired
 the imaginations and hopes of millions. Its con-
 ception and projection was a creative event. Yet
 the uniqueness of the concept was less extra-
 ordinary than its historic timing, the way in
 which it entered into and became a part of exist-
 ing currents of thought and feeling.... To usher
 in a new era in relations between peoples-an era
 in which the energies released in co-operative
 enterprises eventually outstrip those dedicated to
 defence or destruction-not one or two ideas
 but a whole sequence of new concepts is needed.
 One of the lessons of the Marshall Plan appears
 to be that for an idea to be effective in the inter-
 national sphere, as has been true in the indus-
 trial sphere, it must be addressed to a situation
 that is ripe for it.
 Recall the starkness of the European situa-
 tion in 1947. The Marshall Plan was born of the
 frustration and failure of the Moscow Con-
 ference and was designed to be "a broad and
 dramatic effort." To-day, in the context of
 nuclear proliferation, the rise of West European
 nationalisms, the decline of U.S. influence on
 the European continent, the growing frustra-
 tion in West Germany, and the increasing
 opportunities in the more divided East, there
 is again a need and an increasingly ripe his-
 torical opportunity for a bold and creative idea.
 As long as the West is militarily strong and
 clear about its goals, we need not fear to extend
 to the Communist world a sincere offer of econo-
 mic co-operation designed neither to strengthen
 nor to weaken those who have made themselves
 our adversaries, but to bind us all together so
 that we cannot consider warring against each
 other. Even in the darkest days of.the 'forties,
 the Policy Planning Staff of the U.S. State
 Department felt (and rightly so) that "Ameri-
 can effort in the aid to Europe should be
 directed not to the combating of Communism as
 such, but to the restoration of the economic
 health and vigor of European society."
 THE IDEA of THE Atlantic community. was  a
 creative and effective response to a challenging
 Russia. The challenge we face is no longer the
 same. The Atlantic idea alone is not an adequate
 response to the opportunity presented :by a
 weakening Soviet bloc and to Europe's quest
 for identity. The proposed initiative would have
 the merit of creating a larger context for con-
 tinued American-European co-operation, some-
 what subsuming the inherent tendency for
 European processes to become also an expression
 of the European desire for autonomy from the
 United States. A larger conception of a co-opera-
 tive  community,  involving eventually  four
 major units, America and Russia as the peri-
 pheral participants, and West Europe and East
 Europe as the two halves of the inner core (in
 time perhaps becoming even more closely
 linked), would provide a more constructive and
 politically appealing image of to-morrow than
 a troubled Western partnership implicitly based
 on the notion of continued European partition.
 A broader conception, of which the Atlantic
 partnership could be one component, would be
 more likely to keep the United States relevant
 to Europe's future, to prevent the recrudescence
 in Europe of narrow nationalisms or the per-
 petuation of xenophobic national Communisms,
 and to create a new political context in which
 the legacies of World War II can at last be
 settled. The West can set itself no nobler or
 more timely task than to end the partition of
 Europe.

 FURTHER CHINESE COMMUNIST
 EFFORTS IN AFRICA
 Although the Chinese Communists have experienced several
 setbacks in their African campaign and encountered some'resistance among
 the leaders of the "Afro-Asian Bloc" (e.g., postponement of II Afro-Asian
 Conference, the Chicoms major propaganda effort of the last three years),
 her subsequent activities demonstrate once again both the fanaticism of
 her leaders and their ability to adjust their tactics swiftly and abruptly
 to the prevailing political winds.  In addition to direct approaches on
 the highest levels, Peking has been trying recently to improve her ima

 g
 in Africa through the cooperation of third countries, especially Indonesia,
 North Vietnam and to some extent Pakistan.
 Recent Chicom setbacks.  Since the beginning of the year, the Chicoms
 have been expelled from Burundi for interfering in its internal affairs -
 the first time 'this has hap e enp   d to them in Africa.  They have been strong-
 ly criticized by President Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, President
 Hamani Diori of Niger and President'Mau'rice Yameogo of Upper Volta for
 "teaching Africans to kill Africans" and coveting Africa's "empty spaces"
 for their own overflowing population.
 President Diori has had special cause to complain for, aside from
 the terrorist attacks in Niger by the Sawaba Party which he said were
 "organized, financed and directed by Communist China," an attempt in
 April 1965 was made on his life by a Chinese-trained Sawaba terrorist.
 As a result of reports in July 1965 that the Chinese were involved in
 a plot to assassinate President Senghor of Senegal, he is expected to
 expel the NCNA representative in Senegal and to refuse to establish
 diplomatic relations with the CPR.
 The diplomatic forays of Chou En-lai in June 1965 highlighted his
 miscalculation of African revolutionary prospects.  While in Dar-es-
 Salaam, Chou reiterated that an "exceedingly favorable" revolutionary
 situation still prevailed.  Although he received a warm initial welcome
 in Tanzania, enthusiasm waned steadily under the impact of Chou's re-
 petitive and ill-conceived attacks on "imperialism, colonialism and
 neo-colonialism."  President Nyerere then made it clear that Tanzanians
 were determined to assert their non-alignment and independence. The

 Kenya government also reacted to Chou's remarks by issuing an official
 statement that it intended to avert "all revolutions, irrespective of
 their countries of origin."
 When Chou returned to Africa, two days after the Algerian coup, it
 was clear that his lobbying to hold the Afro-Asian Conference on schedule
 and China's precipitate recognition of the new Algerian regime, untempered
 by any concern for the fate of China's erstwhile fraternal ally, Ben Bella,
 profoundly shocked other African leaders.  It was a striking; example of
 China's indifference to African views and interests when pursuinn  her own
 ends.
 The decision of the Government of Kenya to expell the New China News
 Agency (NCNA) correspondent, Wang Teh-ming, in July 1965, focused at-
 tention again on the unprofessional activities of China's official news
 service.  Wang, whose presence in Kenya was said to be "against the in-
 terests of national security," was known to have been in touch with dis-
 sident groups, including left wing elements in the ruling KANU.  The
 expulsion of Wang was welcomed by the Nairobi brance of KANU, which urged
 the government to make a full investigation into the activities of those
 embassies "which are causing misunderstanding and confusion to Kenya
 people."  At the same time, Defense Minister Mungal stated that Kenyan
 citizens would not be recruited into the armed forces if they underwent
 unauthorized foreign military training - a warning clearly intended to
 apply to trainees sent to communist nations.
 Although expressing sympathy for the views of moderate officials,
 President Jomo Kenyatta has refused, at least for the time being, to
 agree to their request that the Chicom embassy be closed and its staff
 expelled.
 New "official" Chicom, efforts.  Faced with the need to do some fence-
 mending in Africa, the Chicoms have stepped up their efforts, concentrat-
 ing on those countries that appear most ready to accept the wares they
 offer.  In August 1965, for example, Peking concluded a commercial pact
 with Guinea, a cultural cooperation treaty with the Somali Republic,
 and reached agreement with the Congo-Brazzaville on a plan to implement
 the cultural accord signed earlier this year.  (See unclassified attach-
 ment for major Communist moves in specific African countries.)
 The Chinese have found that while a number of African countries will
 not accept aid directly from them, they will accept it from Indonesia.
 One of the rain purposes of the visit of Communist China's Foreign Minister
 Chen Yi to Indonesia, in mid-August 1965, reportedly was to discuss the
 channelling 2f         economic assistance to Africa throuh :Indonesia.  It
 vas further reported that during First Deputy Prime Minister Subandrio's
 tour through Africa in July 1965, he committed Indonesia to a total of
 50 million dollars in economic assistance to African states; this sum
 will be sullied b~_,the Chicoms.

 Chicom strategy.  Peking appears to divide African nations into
 four ,eneral categories and tailors its program to fit the Chinese con-
 ception of the situation and circumstances which apply to each case.
 The First group, composed of the radical states with which close co-
 operation is possible, include Ghana, Guinea, Mali and Congo/B, and
 prior to the June 1965 coup, Algeria.  (There are encouraging indica-
 tions, however slight, of a less radical trend in the policies of both
 Mali and Guinea and some disillusion with Communist China.)  The Chinese
 maintain cordial ties with the leaders of these countries and work
 closely with them to establish bases for operation against third coun-
 tries.
 The Second category of states includes those which have recently
 become independent and where the political orientation of the govern-
 ment is still in the process of development.  Dahomey, the Central
 African Republic, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania fall into this group
 which Peking is attempting to steer towards the left.
 The Third category consists of conservative states, vulnerable
 to revolutionary efforts in the long run, but not targets ripe for
 active subversion at present.  Tunisia, Morocco and Ethiopia are in
 this group.  Peking has diplomatic relations with Tunisia and Morocco
 and makes periodic overtures for the exchange of diplomatic missions
 with Ethiopia.
 The Fourth category is composed of "reactionary" regimes -- those
 which do not recognize Peking and have been resisting Chicom blandish-
 ments.  Included in this group are Upper Volta, Niger, Chad, Gabon,
 Congo/L, and Rwanda.  All are targets for active subversion at the
 present time.  Other conservative governments - Liberia, Ivory Coast,
 Malawi and the Malagasy Republic - appear to be on the list for future
 attention.
 Peking now maintains diplomatic ties with 17 African nations.
 (See attachment)  Many conservative African governments, however, in-
 cluding Cameroon, Niger, Upper Volta, and the Ivory Coast, are genuinely
 suspicious of the Chinese potential for subversion and are not anxious
 to see them established locally.
 Propaganda mechanisims and media.  All Chicom posts abroad serve as
 major propaganda outlets.  Chinese diplomats and press representatives
 throughout Africa, as well as Chou En-lai and other lesser figures tour-
 ing the continent, assiduously echo the line that Peking is Africa's
 best friend, overflowing with understanding of African problems and
 sharing a common experience of foreign exploitation.
 The Chinese now beam more than 100 hours of radio propaganda to
 Africa each week, as compared with about 50 hours three years ago.
 Languages include English, French, Arabic, Cantonese, Portuguese,

 S,-zahili and Hausa-  The Cantonese -language broadcasts are directed
 toward the more than 110,000 overseas Chinese in East Africa, about
 half of ,Thom inhabit Mauritius.
 High-quality pamphlets and periodicals in both English and French
 are widely distributed. in Africa.  The NCNA, Peking's .?r.N incipal agency
 for dissemination _o:f  22a anddaa, now maintains offices in 15 African
 countries, and has numerous effective and often influential local
 stringers.  Tanzanian Minister Babu formerly served as an NCNA repre-
 sentative in East Africa.
 Economic aid and infiltration.  There are over 1,500 Chinese
 technicians and laborers in Africa.   This figure is likely to increase
 substantially in the future.
 The Chinese aid programs have stressed assistance for agricultural
 development and the establishment of small-scale industries for food
 processing and consumer goods.  Chinese schemes to grow sugar, rice
 and tea in Mali apparently are working out well and several hundred
 Chinese technicians continue to be employed on these projects.  In
 Ghana, Chinese technicians are providing assistance in growing swamp
 rice; others are to initiate similar projects for the production of
 vegetables, cotton and peanuts.
 Total Chinese trade with Africa has been small, amounting to ap-
 proximately $120 million in 1963, but is growing.  During the first
 half of 196+ total Chinese trade with Africa was 50 per cent larger
 than that in the comparable period of th22 previous year.
 Since Peking is unable to afford economic and technical assistance
 programs on the same scale as those offered by the West and by the
 Soviet Union, it relies heavily on the propaganda effect of its more
 modest efforts.  For example, Chou En-lai gained respect for the CPR
 by offering aid as one poor country to another.  Offers of economic
 assistance amounted to a, total of about $335 million. Agreements
 negotiated in 1964 alone came to approximately $195 million.  As in
 other parts of the world, however, Chicom economic assistance to Africa
 has remained, largely a paper proposition.  Only about one-fourth of the
 funds have been obligated (as of April  1965) and less than 10 per cent
 about $20 million - have been drawn.

 Fact Sheet                                       For Background Use Only
 13 September 1965
 The KOIOIDL -  The Soviet Union's Mono
 on Youth Activities
 Non-Communists are at a serious disadvantage in attempting to under-
 stand Communist organizations such as the Komsomol when they view it
 from their own background and experience.  A youth organization, for
 example, is normally conceived of as an organization formed and run by
 youths for their own purposes.  But the Soviet youth organization,
 Komsomol (properly the Vsesoyuznyy Leninskiy Knmmunisticheskiy S ro uz
 Molodezhi -- All-Union Leninist Communist League of Youth), can only be
 described as an organization of, not for the youth of the nation.  An
 organization of the youth by the Party for the State.
 Somehow the idea persists that the Komsomol is, to some degree at
 least, "independent" of the CPSU.  True, at the founding First Congress
 of the Komsomol, October 29 to November 4, 1918, a motion was passed that
 "The League is an independent organization."  This was for the deliberate
 purpose of permitting the Komsomol to reach beyond Party members to
 attempt to gather in other youth not yet in the Party.  Lest this word
 "independent" cause confusion, however, the Central Committee of the
 Komsomol abandoned the term at a Plenum meeting five months later, and
 adopted in its stead the word "autonomous."   Further to clarify matters,
 a joint resolution of the Central Committees of both the Party and the
 Komsomol proclaimed on August 8, 1919, that "The Central Committee of
 the Komsomol is directly subordinated to the Central Committee of the
 Party.... The local organizations of the Komsomol work under the control
 of the local committees of the Party."  And this has become the standard
 pattern for Party control of mass organizations; the Central Committee
 controls the leadership, the lower Party echelons control the lower
 levels of the organization.
 There are other facts which convincingly demonstrate the fact and
 nature of CPSU control of the Komsomol: Fifty percent of the voting
 delegates to the First Congress of the Komsomol were Party members; this
 figure rose to 97.8% at the Sixth Congress (1924), and fell to 59% at
 the Thirteenth Congress in 1958.  Although the normal age of Komsomol
 members is supposed to be limited to the 14 to 26 year bracket, 52% of
 the delegates to this Thirteenth Congress were over 26 years of age, and
 14 percent were even over 30.  And the largest single category of dele-
 gates consisted of full-time, paid, professional Komsomol employees
 (they formed 87% of the delegates in 1924; the percentage fell to about
 45% in 1954).  All of which proves that the Congress of the Soviet youth
 organization is controlled by Party members over 26 years old who are
 professional employees of the organization itself.  But it still pro-
 fesses to represent Soviet youth:

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040006-0
 The basic function of the Komsomol, it is obvious, is to control
 the youth of the Soviet Union.  And it does this both with a carrot and
 a stick.  As a carrot, the Komsomol offers practically the only path to
 advancement in those things to which youth aspire.  If a young person
 desires to get an advanced education, to join an athletic team, to
 travel abroad, even to go to a night club, the path is via the Komsomol.
 And the Komsomol carries a big stick too.  It organizes the "druzhiniki,"
 groups of young activists who patrol the schools, the night clubs, and
 the beach resorts to assure that the youth dress properly, stay sober,
 say the right things, and generally avoid the dissolute ways of "hooli-
 gans."  Zr way of punishment, the druzhiniki can send a wayward lard to
 a "Comrades' Court" where he can be severely reprimanded.  Or they can
 arrange for him to "volunteer" for service in the "new lands."  A clas-
 sic illustration of the size of the stick wielded by the Komsomol ap-
 peared in the organization's daily newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, on
 March 29, 1962:  A malingerer named Potapov was sentenced to three years'
 deportation to Siberia because "in the morning he went out into the
 courtyard and indolently ruminated 'what can I do with myself,' and then
 came to the invariable conclusion that the best thing would be to devote
 his attention to a tin can with which one can amuse oneself to one's
 heart's content in place of a ball, and to chase pigeons."
 Of course sending youth to the "new lands" serves a second purpose
 in addition to providing a punishment which helps keep people in line;
 it provides a steady flow of manpower for areas which could not other-
 wise hope to recruit sufficient workers to fulfill their plans.  And
 indeed support to agriculture and industry is a very major function of
 the Komsomol.  An indication of the scope of activity involved has been
 given by the current First Secretary of the organization, Sergey Pav-
 lovich PAVLOV:                          over a period of 4 years 2 million youths were recruited
 to work on farms (700,000 of them for the virgin lands) and many sectors
 of Soviet industry are organized around 54 million Soviet youths directed
 by the Komsomol.  In connection with the current stress on agricultural
 chemicals, Komsomol was called on to assist in the completion of more
 than 50 mineral fertilizer plants.  The Soviet news agency Tass compared
 the size of the call-up with Khrushchev's mammoth "new lands" campaign
 of the 1950's.
 Another important function of the Komsomol in the Soviet scheme of
 things is its role in selecting, training, and testing future cadres for
 the Party and the government.  By and large the Komsomol members are
 divided between those who join because it is a sine qua non for their
 schooling or other interests, and those who become activists in the
 Komsomol for the purpose of making a career in the ruling class.  This

 is readily reflected in the statistic quoted earlier to the effect that
 the largest group of delegates to Komsomol Congresses consists of pro-
 fessional workers in the Komsomol.  These activists receive excellent
 training in Communist ideology, Party organization, strategy and tactics,
 and in the various other matters necessary for the Soviet elite.  Two
 current examples of the value of this background may be cited which are
 not only to the point, they are devastating indictments of the Komsomol.
 The first case is that of Alexander Nikolayevich SHELNPIN, borm in
 Voronezli :n 1918, who rose through the Komsomol to the heights of the
 Soviet system.  In 1940 he began his career in the Moscow City Komsomol
 Committee.  In 1943 he became a Secretary of the Central Committee of
 the All-Union Komsomol and advanced to Second Secretary in 19+9 and
 First Secretary (i.e., boss) in 1952.  He graduated from the Komsomol
 to become Chairman of the Committee on State Security (KGB) in 1958.
 After three years with the ,KGB (the Soviet Secret Police organization)
 he was elected to the Secretariat of the Central Committee (October 1961),
 and was named Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman
 of the Party-State Control Committee in 1962.  Following Khrushchev's
 fall, Shelepin was elected a full member of the Presidium of the CPSU
 in November 1964 -- at the age of 46.
 Shelepin's replacement as First Secretary of the Komsomol was
 Vladimir Yefimovich SEMICHASTNIY, born 192+ at Grigoryevka in the Ukraine.
 He had worked up through the ranks of the Ukrainian Komsomol organization
 and had also been elected to the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Party
 in 19+9 (he arose  while Khrushchev was First Secretary of the Ukrainian
 Party).  In 1956 he made the Central Committee of the CPSU and in 1958
 was elected to the Council of the Union of the Supreme Soviet.  That
 same year he became boss of the Komsomol.  He distinguished himself dur-
 ing his tenure as First Secretary of the All-Union Komsomol by being one
 of the first to attack Boris Pasternak following the awarding of the
 Nobel Prize for Literature to the author of Doctor Zhivago in October
 1958.  Addressing the Plenum of the Central Committee of the Komsomol at
 a meeting commemorating the organization's 40th anniversary, in the pres-
 ence of Khrushchev and facing a television camera, he said Pasternak was
 worse than a pig since he had "defiled the place where he has eaten, ...
 defiled those by whose toil he lives and breathes...." After a year as
 head of the Komsomol he was transferred to Azerbaydzhan to try to
 straighten out messes in the oil and cotton industries.  A year later,
 however, he was back in Moscow as ... Chairman of the KGB, replacing
 Shelepin.  And he's still there.
 The current First Secretary of the Komsomol -- Semichastniy's
 successor -- is Sergey Pavlovich PAVLOV, born January 1929 in Kalinin.
 He rose through the Moscow City committee of the Komsomol, having been
 Secretary (1955), Second Secretary (1956) and First Secretary (1958).
 In April 1958 he moved over to the All Union Komsomol as a secretary and
 became First Secretary of the latter organization in March 1959 at the

 age of 30.  He became a full member of the Central Committee of the CPSU
 in October 1961.  He has been an active campaigner against the liberal
 writers and poets, having been a principal speaker during the meetings
 held with the intellectuals by Khrushchev in December 1962, and in March
 and April 1963-
 A final point to make in discussing the Komsomol is its role in
 international youth affairs.  Naturally the Komsomol is the organizer and
 leader of the international Communist youth fronts.  Shelepin was Vice-
 President of the International Union of Students from 19+7 to 1952 and
 was Vice President of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (TPDY)
 from 1953 to 1959.  (That is, for a period he was simultaneously head of
 the Soviet Secret Police and vice president of the chief international
 Communist youth front::  Bogdan Stashinskiy, the self-admitted KGB
 assassin of the Ukrainian exile leader Stepan Bandera, has testified
 that during this period he was awarded the Soviet Red Banner for the
 assassination by Shelepin himself.)  Shelepin was succeeded in the WFDY
 by Pavlov who became its First Vice President in 1959.  Pavlov was also
 leader of the Soviet delegation of some 800 "youths" at the Eighth World
 Youth Festival in Helsinki in the summer of 1962.
 The Komsomol is also charged with selecting all delegations of
 Soviet youth which attend the myriad meetings around the world each year
 and it receives all youth delegations visiting the USSR.  It has a very
 special role to play at the "People's Friendship University named after
 Patrice Lumumba" (known as PFU or Lumumba U.), where the students from
 Africa, Asia and Latin America are generally segregated from the bull
 of Soviet and European students.  In order that these foreigners not be
 entirely segregated from Soviet life, a certain number of Soviet students
 are assigned to PFU to be friendly with them, assist them ... and indoc-
 trinate them.  Of course these Soviet students are almost exclusively
 Komsomol activists.  And of course they are in close touch with the pro-
 rector of the University, Pavel Dimitriyevich YERZIN, a General in the
 KGB according to the London Daily Telegraph of 17 April 1963.
