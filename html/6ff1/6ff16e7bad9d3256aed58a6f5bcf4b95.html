CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN 
6 September 1958 
DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
*Taiwan Strait situation (information as of 0100 EDT, 
6 September): Chinese Communist air and naval activity in 
the Taiwan Strait area increased on 5 September after a lull 
of several days probably caused by severe weather conditions. 
Peiping radio announced that Mao Tse-tung on 5 September 
convened the 15th Supreme State Conference, a forum for an-
nouncing major policy decisions, and reportedly gave an "in-
cisive analysis" of the international situation. The Chinese 
Nationalists have expressed concern lest the Taiwan Strait 
situation be raised at the United Nations. 
(Page 1) 
USSR: On 5 September Pravda repeated strong ex-
pressions of Soviet support for Communist China, but 
again stopped short of committing the USSR to direct mil-
itary involvement. Extensive charges of American "pro-
vocative" moves and belligerent intentions are apparently 
intended to increase world-wide apprehension over the 
prospect of imminent large-scale hostilities and to dis-
credit American policy toward the offshore islands. A 
reference in the article to "a devastating counterblow" 
which would put an end to "US imperialist aggression in 
the Far East," taken together with the promise of "every 
kind of aid," could be preparing the way for an announce-
ment that the USSR may make advanced weapons available 
to Peiping. (Page 3)

Li vr CA.-lUll   
v.to 
Communist China: 
 the Chinese Communists will 
"avoid a major clash with the US if possible" but are "pre-
pared for it if they are forced by events." 
the Communists have adequate 
"troops� aircraft, and landing craft" on the South China 
coast, but he "did not give a direct answer" to the question 
of whether China planned to occupy the offshore islands. 
He would not hear of any "provisional settlement on the 
basis of the return of the coastal islands" with subsequent dis-
cussion of the Taiwan problem, as this would imply accept-
ance of the "two Chinas"theory. 
USSR-Japan: N. T. Fedorenko, the new Soviet ambas-
sador, is expedted by Japanese officials to propose reopen-
ing of negotiations for a peace treaty upon his arrival in 
Tokyo on 7 September. Fedorenko apparently accompanied 
Khrushchev to Peiping in early August when Sino-Soviet tac-
tics toward Japan may have been reviewed. The Japanese 
Government may sound him out on Soviet willingness to me-
diate trade and political problems between Japan and Com-
munist China. (Page 4) 
East Germany: The regime is disturbed over the con-
tinued high number of escapes to the West, which last week 
totaled more than 6,000, and is likely to adopt stricter con-
trol measures. Such action, if effective, would remove one 
of the East German population's major safety valves. 
(Page 5) 
IL ASIA-AFR1CA 
Arab League meeting: The meeting scheduled for 6 Sep-
tember in Cairo apparently will be attended only by ambassa-
dors of the member states. A meeting of the league foreign 
ministers, or possibly chiefs of state, may be held later this

month. The Lebanese opposition in particular is asking for 
a postponement until after General Shihab takes office on 24 
Sentember.  
Lebanon: Representatives of pro- Chamoun paramilitary 
elements of the Syrian Social National party (PPS) have 
threatened a general action against the rebels. Such a move 
would probably be opposed at this time by their own high 
command, but these local elements may attack Druze forces 
in the regionsoutheast of Beirut, near an area where Amer-
ican forces are located. The present tactic of the PPS, as of 
other pro- Chamoun groups, is to use the threat of force to 
deter Shihab from further compromises with the rebels. If 
Shihab becomes a figurehead for a rebel-dominated govern-
ment, fighting on a wider scale could occur. 
(Page 6) 
Iran: Kurdish tribes in the northwest and Arab tribes 
in the west,aliegedly under Iraqi encouragement, are re-
ported to be restive, and to be planning a disturbance as 
soon as the fall harvest is completed. Trouble in these 
tribal areas might encourage other disaffected elements in 
ountry to take action against the regime. 
Page 8) 
Cyprus: British officials on Cyprus predict a major 
EOICA campaign of violence beginning around 1 October when 
implementation of the new British plan is scheduled to begin. 
Such violence would probably be designed to demonstrate the 
need for UN intervention. Meanwhile the Greek foreign min-
ister has warned Britain that the decision to go ahead with the 
(2-) plan could ultimately result in a Greek-Turkish war and that 
Greece will fight "with all political means available" to im-
pede application of the plan. (Page 9)

Iceland-UK: Public feeling against the British is mount-

tion to protect its trawlers within Iceland's new 12-mile ter-

for a compromise and may endanger NATO and US interests 
in Iceland. (Page 10)

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Taiwan Strait Situation (as of 0100 EDT, 6 September) 
Chinese Communist air and naval activity in the Taiwan 
Strait area increased on 5 September after a lull of several 
days probably caused by severe weather conditions. The air 
activity, however, is still well below the level noted shortly 
after the occupation of the coastal airfields. Operations by 
Communist torpedo boats and patrol vessels in the Santu Bay 
area have continued at a high level since 4 September. 
With the return of good weather, a resumption of Chi-
nese Nationalist reconnaissance flights over the mainland 
coast,and Communist air operations near the offshore islands, 
additional and more frequent clashes can be expected. 
Peiping radio states that Mao Tse-tung convened the 15th 
Supreme State Conference in Peiping on 5 September. This 
is a forum, the sole purpose of which is to announce major 
policy decisions, 
the conference agenda did not refer specifically to the Taiwan 
Strait, but Mao is credited with giving an "incisive analysis" 
of the domestic and international situation. 
Chinese Nationalist Foreign Minister Huang has expressed 
concern that the Taiwan Strait situation may be raised at the 
United Nations. Even a condemnatory resolution regarding 
Communist actions would not be welcome in Taipei since it 
would raise the "two Chinas" issue. 
Another reflection in Taipei of the offshore island crisis 
has been a rise of approximately 25 percent in the blackmarket 
rate for United States dollars between 30 August and 3 Septem-
ber. This is the first indication of popular concern over the 
military situation.

Chiang Kai-shek allegedly has stressed that South Korea 
should attack North Xorea in the event of an armed con-
flict in the Taiwan Strait. Seoul appears anxious to exploit 
the situation, but apparently has made no moves to date to 
actively assist the Nationalists.

Pravda Repeats Warning on Taiwan Strait Issue  
Pravda on 5 September again expressed support for Com-
munist China in the Taiwan Strait crisis, stating that "the 
Soviet people will extend to...the Chinese people every kind 
of aid." The article, signed by the authoritative "Observer," 
asserted that the Soviet Union "cannot remain inactive" in the 
face of events on the "territory of its brave ally," and warned 
that the USSR "will not quietly watch US military preparations 
in the Pacific." It concluded with a warning that the US "can-
not count on the retaliatory blow restricting itself to the area 
of the offshore islands and the Taiwan Strait," but "will re-
ceive such a devastating counterblow that an end will be put 
to US imperialist aggression in the Far East." 
The tone of Pravda's latest warning is considerably harsher 
than the 31 August article and the 3 September lzvestia state-
ment which made reference to the Sino-Soviet alliance. Like 
the earlier statements, however, it stops short of committing 
the Soviet Union to direct military involvement in the event of 
a clash between American and Chinese Communist forces. 
Much of the article is devoted to a recitation of US moves--
including American references to the availability of atomic 
weapons�which Pravda interprets as "part of a plan for large-
scale military provocations" against Communist China and 
other Asian countries. Soviet leaders probably expect that 
charges of American provocations, when coupled with their 
own expression of support of the Chinese communists, will 
considerably increase world-wide apprehension over the pros-
pect of imminent large-scale hostilities. 
While the Soviet warnings are in part designed to inhibit 
US military counteraction, Moscow and Peiping are apparently 
seeking to convert tensions in the area into a major interna-
tional issue which could be exploited politically. They may hope 
to bring about high-level negotiations--possibly with Chinese 
Communist participation--or to set the stage for a full-scale 
debate in the forthcoming session of the UN General Assembly 
on US policy toward Taiwan and the offshore islands, and the  
Chinese representation question.

Moscow May Renew Peace Treaty Bid to Japan  
N. T. Fedorenko, the new Soviet ambassador to Japan 
and one of the Kremlin's top experts on China and the Far 
East, is expected by the Japanese Foreign Ministry to pro-
pose reopening of negotiations for a peace treaty upon his 
arrival in Tokyo on 7 September. Fedorenko, a former dep-
uty foreign minister, apparently accompanied Khrushchev 
to Peiping in late August, at which time Sino-Soviet policies 
toward Japan may have been reviewed and coordinated. 
The Japanese do not expect that Fedorenko's terms would 
be acceptable. Soviet officials now visiting Japan have given 
no sign that Moscow will relax demands that Tokyo relinquish 
its claims to the southern Kurils. The chief of the USSR's 
Gosplan fisheries department, A. A. Ishkov, said in Tokyo 
on 28 August that conclusion of a peace treaty "comes first." 
When prodded by Foreign Minister Fujiyama in regard to a 
Soviet guarantee of nonseizure for Japanese fishing boats, 
Ishkov declared,the._ issue was "inseparable" from the terri-
torial problem and peace treaty. Tokyo is opposed to making 
safe-fishing guarantees contingent on a peace treaty. The 
Japanese Government may, however, sound out Fedorenko 
on Soviet willingness to mediate trade and political problems 
between Japan and Communist China. 
Moscow's new team at the Tokyo embassy will be excep-
tionally strong. The minister-counselor, S. P. Suzdalev, is 
a former ambassador to North Korea, who previously served 
in Japan for six years, in Washington for two years, and was 
a delegate to the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina.

East Germany Concerned Over Increasing Escapes to West  
The East German regime is becomingly increasingly con-
cerned over the rising numbers fleeing to the West. The 
number of refugees reached the highest point since Apri11956 
during the week ending 2 September, with a total of more than 
6,100, and Berlin authorities expect the rate will soon reach 
1,000 per day. Pankow is particularly distressed at the large 
number of intellectuals and technicians leaving the country, 
as well as the continued drain of youths of military age, total-
ing 10,000 so far this year. More than 75 percent of eiscapes 
now are through West Berlin, because of successful East 
German measures to seal off the zonal borders between East 
and West Germany. Pankow appears to be trying to cut down 
on flights to West Berlin by controlling movement between 
East Germany and Berlin. A ban on rail travel from stations 
within 50 kilometers of the city has been put into effect, and 
travelers reportedly must now secure written permission 
from local police to travel to Berlin. 
East German party boss Walter Ulbricht is reported to 
have interrupted his vacation to confer with Moscow leaders 
on further measures to cope with the situation, 
Ulbricht himself favors harshness 
but may find the Kremlin unwilling to sanction extreme meas-
ures which would violate the four-power status of Berlin. 
The possibility of escaping to the West has hitherto acted 
as an important safety valve for release of the widespread 
popular discontent in East Germany. Some East German party 
circles may still believe that dissident elements should be al-
lowed to leave rather than remain as potential troublemakers.

II. ASIA-AFRICA 
Pro-Chamoun Militants Threaten New Fighting in Lebanon  
Military leaders of the pro-Chamoun Syrian Social Nation-
al party (PPS) in the mountains ten miles southeast of Beirut 
have informed local US military authorities that they intend to 
attack Karnal Jumblatt's rebel Druze forces soon. Jumblatt, 
who has been building up his forces in an area near American 
positions in the mountains, is said to expect further fighting 
after Shillala assume3 the presidene-3% 
 Some PPS members fear 
that after General Shihabts inauguration as president, the 
Lebanese Army will fall under the command of persons desir-
ing to eradicate the PPS as Syria did. Although local PPS 
units may take action against Jumblattgs forces, even before 
Shihab becomes president, it is doubtful that party leaders 
would countenance action on a wider scale until they are con-
vinced that Shihab has become a figurehead for a rebel-dom-
inated government. 
President Chamoun, who has stated that he too expects 
fighting to be renewed when American forces leave Lebanon, 
does not expect General Shihab to back progovernment groups. 
The belief that Shihab has reached an accommodation with 
the rebels under which rebel leader Rashid Karame will be-

Kurdish and Arab Tribes Plan Disturbances in Iran 
Kurdish tribes in northwest Iran are reported to be plan-
ning disturbances with support from the new regime in Iraq 
as soon as the fall harvesting is completed. The nature and 
objective of their plan of action is as yet unknown but the tim-
ing suggests they may be preparing for a long struggle. 
Iran, Turkey, and the former Iraqi monarchy have often 
expressed concern that their sizable Kurdish minorities would 
begin a coordinated campaign with foreign assistance to achieve 
their long-standing aspiration for an independent state. Sev-
eral factors, however, have been holding Kurdish ambitions 
in check. Many Kurds have been disillusioned with past out-
side exploitation of their cause; some have become prosperous 
and are reluctant to endanger their economic status. 
Therefore, if the 500,000 Iranian Kurds cause disturbances 
this fall, they will probably be striving for limited objectives 
such as better treatment by the government and increased eco-
nomic benefits. The delicate balance of political forces in 
Iran, however, is such that a Kurdish revolt coupled with an 
uprising of dissatisfied Arab tribes could, by keeping many 
of Iran's security forces occupied, give civilian and military 
plotters in Tehran the opportunity and the encouragement to 
stage a coup d'etat.

Cyprus  
British and Greek officials alike believe that the re-
newed EOKA violence on Cyprus will culminate in a major 
campaign of terrorism about 1 October, when London in-
tends to begin implementation of its new plan for govern-
ment of the island's Greek and Turkish communities. Greek 
Foreign Minister Averoff predicts that the arrival, sched-
uled about that date, of a Turkish representative to confer 
with Governor Foot on implementation of the new plan "will 
be the signal for general revolt." Averoff said Greece will 
first warn NATO of possible consequences of the new plan 
and will then use every available "political" means to prevent 
its being carried out. He warned that EOICA attacks may be 
aimed at the Turkish representative, a move which could ig-
nite intercommunal rioting on Cyprus and eventually lead to 
a Greco-Turkish war. 
Permission for the return of Archbishop Makarios to 
Cyprus during September presumably will be discussed dur-
ing Governor Foot's current visit to London. While the Brit-
ish exavernment has repeatedly stated that Makarios could 
return only after a period of peace on Cyprus, London might 
grant permission as a result of the rapidly deteriorating 
situation, in a last-minute attempt to prevent a complete 
breakdown of order on the island. It is by no means certain, 
however, that Makarios would return to Cyprus at this time 
if granted permission. His recent statements reveal a 
hardening of his attitude toward the British and indicate 
that he intends to concentrate on securing a UN-sponsored 
solution to the Cyprus controversy at the next session of 
the General Assembly.

III. THE WEST 
British-Icelandic Fisheries Dispute  
Anti-British feeling is mounting dangerously in Iceland 
as a result of Britain's ccatinued protection of its trawlers 
within Iceland's unilaterally proclaimed 12-mile limit. Par-
liament has reconvened, and the trade unions organized a 
large demonstration against the British on 4 September. Ear-
lier this week the Municipal Council of Reykjavik demanded 
the recall of Iceland's ambassador to London. 
The inflamed state of public opinion has made it more 
difficult for NATO officials to work out a compromise. The 
Icelandic Government will not agree to any proposal which 
does not amount to recognition of the new demarcation. A 
continuation of "incidents" could induce Iceland to raise in 
NAC itself the question of British "aggression." If Iceland 
fails to receive support in NAC and the impasse continues, 
resentment could easily shift to the US-manned NATO base 
at Keflavik. Itelandnight also raise the whole matter at the 
UN General Assembly. 
London hopes that by defending its rights while seeking 
to resume talks, it may induce Iceland to accept some for-
mula not involving British recognition of the 1,2-mile limit. 
Britain is worried about the practical problems of fishing 
under naval protection and the larger threat to its strategic 
position in the -North Atlantic. At the moment, however, 
London is primarily concerned over setting a dangerous 
precedent for fishing-limit extension by the Faeroes and by 
Norway
