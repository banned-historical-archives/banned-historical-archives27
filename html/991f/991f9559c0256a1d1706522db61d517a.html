 Beijing has interpreted the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as a
 significant expansionist thrust that poses global dangers, particu-
 larly to Western interests and indirectly to China itself.  In the
 past Beijing has viewed Southwest Asia as having relatively remote
 implications for China's own security, but it has now seized on the
 Afghan invasion to sound the alarm about Soviet intentions and to
 press its case against detente as a smokescreen for Soviet aggres-
 The Chinese view the Soviet move into Afghanistan as a particu-
 larly disturbing extension of the Brezhnev Doctrine outside of the
 Soviet bloc.  For the first time Moscow used its own troops against
 a Third World country.  With Cubans active in Africa--and in the Horn
 in particular--and the Vietnamese expanding in Southeast Asia, Beijing
 believes that the Soviets are moving to establish a stranglehold on
 the oil routes from the Persian Gulf.  This hold will threaten the
 balance of power between the Soviet Unicn and the West and will
 ultimately jeopardize China's own security.
 The Chinese have long held that Soviet expansionism is focused
 on Europe, and thus China is not immediately threatened.  Now, how-
 ever, introducing a new wrinkle into its strategic line, Beijing
 asserts that the invasion of Afghanistan  as "linked" Soviet
 strategies in the East and the West.  While still acknowledging that
 the primary threat is to the West, the new argument maintains that a
 growing threat to Chinese interests has increased Beijing's "inter-

 form than substantive assistance.  The major elements of Beijing's
 policy have been attempts to help broker a rapprochement between
 Pakistan and India and to encourage maximum assistance from the
 United States.  Chinese officials have frequently talked about in-
 creasing assistance to Islamabad above the levels already in the
 pipeline, but there is no evidence that Beijing has yet offered a
 new commitment.  China has also hesitated to provide a firm response
 '
 to Pakistan
 s request for a security guarantee.
 Renewal of Efforts at Normalizing Chinese Relations With
 India and Iran.  In the wake of both the Soviet invasion and the
 election of Indira Gandhi, China has renewed its effort to
 normalize relations with India; the effort was stalled a year ago
 when the Chinese invaded Vietnam while the Indian Foreign Minister
 was visiting China.  Before the trip soured, the two sides agreed
 to discuss the border question and made progress on other issues.
 After the trip, despite the strain caused by the Vietnam inva-
 sion, bilateral relations did not revert to the old level of hos-
 tility.  Beijing is continuing to seek improved relations with a
 notable degree of determination and finesse.   Gandhi, however, is
 cautious about responding to Chinese overtures.  Given her long-
 standing deep suspicions of China, her country's close relations
 with the Soviet Union, and her policy of opposing further arms
 assistance to Pakistan and the Afghan rebels, it is not likely
 that there will be an early breakthrough in bilateral relations.
 On the other hand, given the persistence of the Chinese effort,
 the inclination of some elements in the Indian bureaucracy to
 improve relations, and India's basic interest in coexistence with
 its largest neighbor, it is likely that there will be a gradual
 improvement in China's relations with India.  The first signifi-
 cant sign of this may come during a trip to India by Foreign Minister
 Beijing is also seeking to improve relations with the government
 in Tehran, but its efforts have been hampered by the chaotic situa-
 tion in Iran and the fact that China was a strong supporter of the
 Shah through the end of his reign.  Beijing is seeking to foster a
 more propitious atmosphere through its media commentary, which places
 some distance between China and the United States, and through a
 variety of private and official contacts.  Since the pace of normal-
 ization depends on Tehran, the prospects for the future are clouded.
 US Engagement in the Region's Defense.  Long before the December
 invasion of Afghanistan, Beijing sought to engage the United States
 and other Western nations in fuller support of Pakistan.  China was

 highly critical of the US aid cutoff to Pakistan in 1979 and expressed
 pleasure over indications that Washington would reverse this policy
 in response to the Soviet invasion.  Beijing's main concern is that
 the aid be of sufficient magnitude to encourage Pakistan to stand firm
 in its resistance to the Soviets; too little, China has argued, will
 be worse than useless.  Beijing, however, has not indicated the amount
 it considers sufficient; it has been reported that Chinese leaders are

 of sophisticated equipment.  Beijing has, however, consistently advised
 and supported Islamabad diplomatically.  After the April 1978 coup in
 Kabul, the Chinese counseled Pakistan to use restraint in the quiet
 support it gave the Afghan rebels lest it give the Afghans or Soviets
 pretext for a diplomatic crisis or military action.  To this end,
 Beijing approved of Islamabad's effort to improve relations with
 Moscow and Kabul.  China also encouraged the Pakistanis, with greater

 lion for the purpose of building a highway and airfield, Beijing's
 first new aid agreement since 1973.   In 1979, Beijing apparently

 actions in Afghanistan, Washington should have offered Pakistan
 greater support.  Beijing expressed concern              that the US

 refusal to supply arms and economic assistance to Pakistan might
 compel Islamabad to adjust its foreign policy and be more accom-
 modating toward Moscow.
 After the Invasion
 the major Chinese reaction to events
 in South Asia was to urge the United States to give Pakistan strong
 support and to attempt to accelerate the pace of normalization of
 relations with India.  The purpose of the latter move was, in part,
 to relieve pressure on Pakistan.  China was reported during this
 time to be considering promoting the creation of an informal regional
 alignment including Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey to oppose the Soviet
 move into Afghanistan and may have had hopes that India would join.
 Beijing hoped such a grouping would offset if not thwart the crea-
 tion of a Moscow-New Delhi-Hanoi axis.

 cautious approach toward substantive support to Pakistan.
 Judged by its public manifestations, the Huang visit was no-
 table for its subdued tone.  Huang, unlike Chinese leaders on earlier
 trips to Islamabad, made no provocative references to Kashmir--re-
 flecting China's new effort to improve relations with India.  Chinese
 media also gave the trip low-key treatment that appeared to play down
 Beijing's commitment to Pakistan, again possibly out of regard for
 Indian sensitivities.
 China, nonetheless, sees little alternative at this time to con-
 tinuing its support for Pakistan.  Since Huang's trip it has continued
 to lobby a number of countries about the need to step up assistance to

 Chinese Military Assistance
 While China has reacted cautiously to Pakistan's request for ad-
 ditional military equipment, the close military relationship between
 the two countries continued in 1980.  As part of an earlier aid agree-

 making a total of 200 given or sold to Pakistan since 1965   (-

 Cycles of Rapprochement and Hostility
 Normal relations between China and India have been blocked since
 1962 by a border dispute and by the tendency of the two countries
 to allow the vicissitudes of relations with third parties, especially
 Pakistan and the USSR, to affect the status of their bilateral rela-
 tions.  Since the early 1970s, relations between China and India have
 been marked by cautious, brief efforts at improvement, followed by
 long periods of renewed bickering.
 Some progress has been made, however.  In 1976 the two countries
 restored normal diplomatic ties at the ambassadorial level; relations
 remained strained, however.  After Indira Gandhi left office in 1977--
 to the undisguised glee of Beijing--China looked forward to better
 relations under the less pro-Soviet government of Moraji Desai and in
 early 1978 invited Indian Foreign Minister A. B. Vajpayee to Beijing
 to discuss outstanding issues.
 Vajpayee's trip, which occurred in February 1979, went well until
 China invaded Vietnam--which has close relations with India--while
 Vajpayee was still in China.  Following this affront, which was
 politically embarrassing to the Desai government, relations between
 the two countries remained chilled, but did not revert to earlier
 levels of animosity.
 After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Beijing again attempted
 to revive the effort at rapprochement, and the Indira Gandhi govern-
 ment has expressed interest in moving ahed.F____1                           25X1

 China to explore was the border dispute, a complex issue for both

 While Sino-Indian relations cooled again after the Vietnam inva-
 sion, they did not detericrate significantly.  India sharply criticized
 the Chinese for committing aggression and Vajpayee expressed indigna-
 tion at its occurrence while he was in China. New Delhi, however,
 did not yield to Soviet pressure to recognize the Heng Samrin gavr rn-
 ment in Kampuchea.  Beijing, for its part, did not revert to anti-
 Indian propaganda; its comments on Sino-Indian relations continued
 to be upbeat.  Chinese leaders recognized that a combination of bad
 feeling about China in New Delhi compounded by Indian political in-
 stability temporarily prevented progre-s in normalization.  Indian

 leaders were apparently impressed that China ignored the sharp
 criticism and remained temperate in its public comments about India.
 Over Chinese objections, India allowed
 the Dalai Lama to visit the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia.  Beijing
 did not make a serious issue of the trip, however, and New Delhi, in
 a reversal of policy, reportedly was willing to allow him to return
 to Tibet if China recognized his position as spiritual leader and
 would allow Tibetans to live as they choose--conditions that are
 unacceptable to Beijing.  The Indians were also reportedly irritated

 Chinese and Indian reaction to developments in Bhutan and Nepal

 Beijing nor New Delhi was willing to let minor irritants resulting
 from third-party relations further sour their bilateral relations.

 intrusion of Tibetan sheep across the unmarked Bhutan border, an

 caused concern in New Delhi, the concern did not appear to damage
 Sino-Indian relations.  Both China and India handled Sino-Nepali

 By the end of the year, Sino-Indian relations had not progressed
 much past the point reached on 15 February 1979.   Both sides were
 awaiting the outcome of the Indian general election for a new op-
 portunity to make further progress.

 After the Afghanistan Invasion
 The Chinese leadership's initial reaction to the election of
 Indira Gandhi was to view India as a country that was not a "stable
 factor for peace in South Asia."
 Other Ministry of Foreign Affairs of-
 ficials expressed similar concerns.  Beijing's already strong sus-
 picions of Gandhi were reinforced by the pro-Soviet statement the
 Indian representative to the UN made on 11 January in defense of the
 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
 China has changed"; instead, Beijing highlighted statements by Gandhi
 and other Indian officials expressing a desire for better relations.
 While Beijing privately viewed Gandhi's return to power with con-
 cern, it did not abandon its policy of moderate media comment on Indian
 affairs during the transition and sought immediately to establish good
 relations with the new government.  Hua Guofeng sent Gandhi warm con-
 gratulations on her return to power, and when New Delhi appeared to
 back away slightly from its 11 January position by making mildly
 critical statements about the Soviet invasion, Chinese inedia played
 up the Indian call for a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.  New
 Delhi, in turn, began generating a mixture of statements about China
 that Beijing chose to interpret in a positive light.  Beijing, for
 example, ignored Gandhi's statement in a press interview that India
 had been a victim of Chinese aggression and she did "not think that

 Indian sensitivities; he did not, for instance, refer to the Kashmir

 In line with this new assessment, Beijing began offering New Delhi
 Three days after returning to Beijing, Huang led the Chinese
 delegation to the Indian 30th anniversary celebrations in Beijing,

 The Chinese, however, continue to harbor doubts about India's
 intentions and the prospects of better relations any time soon.  These
 doubts were recently fed by a shrill statement Gandhi was reported in
 the press to have made to a political rally on 21 February condemning
 Chinese occupation of sections of Indian, Bhutanese, Nepalese, and
 Burmese territory and charging that China posed a danger to the.IIndian
 border.  Beijing dealt with this charge by expressing "surprise and
 regret" over Gandhi's remarks which flew "in the face of facts" and
 "vilified China."  Beijing's public commentary, however, ended on an
 upbeat note by recalling the Gandhi government's expressed desire
 to seek normal relations with all neighbors, including China.

 Despite this upbeat comment, Chines,.- officials continue to ex-
 press private concern about Gandhi's ultimate intentions.
 The Chinese Ambassador in Washington has re-
 cently indicated that Beijing's relatively sanguine view of Soviet-
 Indian relations may be eroding.  The pace of normalization, he told
 a senior American official in late February, has been slowed as a
 result of the new Gandhi government and there still existed a schism
 between the two countries.  In regard to Chinese-Indian relations,
 he said, the problem was not the border issue since China had not
 violated the border.  India's hostile attitude, he suggested, had
 not been caused by past problems, "but by good Indian-Soviet rela-
 Sino-Nepali relations continued to be close in 1979 and are
 likely to remain so in 1980.  The most significant bilateral event
 last year was the signing of a border demarcation protocol that China
 handled in a manner that did not raise the ire of New Delhi.  Because
 of its size and geographical location, Nepal has always tried to stay
 on good terms with its two giant neighbors, and India and China have
 traditionally been sensitive to each other's influence and activities
 When widespread political discontent erupted in civil disorders
 last spring, Beijing supported King Birendra's government and was
 careful to avoid the appearance of interfering in Nepal's internal
 affairs.  China was particularly concerned that the disorders would
 lead to Indian military intervention.

 The King's call for a political referendum in May

 the vote would lead to increased power for the supposedly pro-Indian

 In August King Birendra visited Beijing, reciprocating Vice Premier
 Deng Xiaoping's visit to Katmandu in 1978.   The Chinese assured him that
 Sino-Nepali relations were a "model" of good neighborliness.  In November,
 Foreign Minister Huang Hua visited Katmandu to sign a border demarcation
 protocol that concluded a year's work by a joint border commission.,
 Beijing was careful not to allow the Huang visit of the border
 accord to offend India.  The Indian Government has reportedly been
 concerned over Nepal's unilateral action of signing the border protocol
 without first consulting India.  The agreement Nepal and China signed,
 however, left untouched the sensitive trijunction area where the borders
 of Nepal, China, and India meet.  Huang avoided making anti-Indian
 statements in public
 Since Indira Gandhi's return to power, however, New Delhi's
 suspicions about Nepal have been renewed despite the apparent absence
 of real Chinese provocation.  In a conversation with a senior American
 official in late January, Gandhi complained about Chinese "mischief
 making" in Nepal.  When an American diplomat in Katmandu asked the

 reports that Gandhi was concerned about Sino-US collusion, the Ambas-
 sador said he was unaware of the exact cause but speculated that the
 concern might arise from periodic anti-Indian campaigns undertaken by
 pro-Chinese factions of the local Nepali Communist party.  These groups,
 the Ambassador said, had created an issue about Indian mistreatment of
 Nepalese in Assam when one really did not exist; if the Chinese Embassy
 in Katmandu was not act:.vely involved in this anti-Indian agitation, he
 suggested that it did not appear to be doing anything to curtail it

 Past Support for the Shah
 Iran and China established diplomatic relations in 1971 and
 began to exchange high-level economic and political delegations.
 China considered the Shah a major stabilizing force in the region.
 After the 1978 Afghanistan coup, Beijing moved to strengthen its ties
 with both Pakistan and Iran.  It viewed both countries, along with
 Saudi Arabia, as vulnerable to a Soviet "pincer movement" aimed at

 After the Shah
 During the last days of the monarchy and through the period just
 after Khomeini's return, the Chinese looked to the United States to do
 something to save the situation.  A middle-ranking Chinese diplomat in
 Europe suggested that the United States resort to assassination of un-
 specified persons to influence events.  Vice Premier Deng XiaopiT
 complained openly that US measures in Iran were "no good."  Referring
 to both Cuba and Iran, Deng warned that the Soviets would "never be

 When China realized an Iranian Islamic Republic was inevitable,
 it moved quickly to recognize the new regime and attempted to limit
 the damage caused by the memory of Hua's 1978 visit to Tehran.  Beijing's
 media coverage, which had been largely reportorial in the last days of
 the Pahlavi monarchy, began to describe the old regime as "autocratic" and
 noted that the new Bazargan government stood for opposition to the mon-
 archy, release of political prisoners, and establishment of a democratic
 republic.  The propaganda also noted that the Persian Gulf was menaced by
 both the United States and the Soviet Union, with the Soviets posing the
 rester threat.
 In private, Beijing conveyed to Iran, through Pakistani Foreign
 Affairs Adviser Agah Shahi, an explanation--bordering on an apology--
 for Hua's 1978 visit.  The explanation, given to Khomeini in July,
 stated that the Shah had invited Hua to stop off in Iran on his return
 from Eastern Europe.  Although Sino-Iranian relations were under a
 strain, Hua decided that it would have been improper not to accept the
 invitation.  Shahi explained that China had to deal with the government
 in power; that the return trip from Europe was long; and that Hua's
 plane needed to stop somewhere for refueling.  Khomeini reportedly
 replied that although Hua's trip was a tragedy, he would forget the
 past and maintai

 relations with Ch na.
 Shortly after the Shahi-Khomeini meeting, Iranian state television
 reported that Shahi had conveyed a Chinese "apology" to the Ayatollah.
 Both Shahi and the Chinese immediately denied the interpretation, but
 Iranian officials soon affirmed its validity.  after several weeks, the
 apology question faded and China began to rebuild its relations with
 Tehran.,                                                                          I

 about the fate of the hostages, Beijing issued a cautious statement
 on 26 November, three weeks after the takeover, that balanced an,
 affirmation of the principle of noninterference in the internal affairs
 of other countries with   call to respect the principle of diplomatic
 immunity.

 At the United Nations, China joined in the unanimous resolution
 calling on Iran to release the hostages and gave a qualified vote on
 31 December supporting the resolution calling for possible sanctions if
 the crisis were not resolved; Beijing's decision to cast this vote was
 an apparent reversal of an earlier decision and came only after receiv-
 ing the President's 31 December letter to Hua Guoferg.  On 13 January,
 China did not vote on the resolution imposing sanctions, taking the posi-
 tion that sanctions would not be effective in releasing the hostages,
 that they would serve to increase Soviet influence in Tehran, and that
 a Chinese vote for them would reduce Beijing's already marginal influ-
 Beijing's general policy toward Iran since the Soviet invasion of
 Afghanistan has been to step up efforts to normalize its own relations
 with Tehran.  China continues to be concerned about a possible ultimate
 takeover in Tehran by a pro-Soviet political group.  While Beijing sees
 the current regime as reactionary and unpredictable, it contends that
 there are elements that could coalesce into a stable government and could
 play a role in thwarting Soviet designs in the Persian Gulf.  Beijing
 therefore enthuastically welcomed the election of Bani-Sadr, sending him
 a warm message expressing hope for "friendship and amicable cooperation"
 On 11 February, Vice Premier Ji Pengfei led an unusually high-level
 delegation to the Iranian Embassy's reception marking the first anniver-
 sary of the Iranian revolution.  In publicly reported comments, Ji
 praised Iran for its success in opposition to foreign aggression.  In
 private remarks to an Iranian official, he soundly condemned the Shah
 and urged Iran to support the Afghan rebels and improve relations with
 between China and the "fraternal" Iranian people.
 China has kept up its contacts with Iran in other ways throughout
 the hostage crisis.  It maintains an Fmbassy in Tehran but apparently
 has not yet been allowed to send an ambassador.  It concluded a trade
 agreement with an Iranian delegation to Beijing during the second week
 of the crisis.  In early February, a delegation of Chinese Muslims
 visited Iran to attend celebrations honoring the revolution.  Chinese
 officials claim they used members of this delegation, as well as other
 contacts with Iranian officials, to urge an early, peaceful resolution
 Beijing is taking care, however, not to become too closely identi-
 fied with the United States.  While its media coverage tends to avoid
 negative comments about the United States, Beijing has reported
 Iranian statements that Tehran will follow a course independent of
 both Washington and Moscow.

 AFGHANISTAN
 Before the Invasion
 Beijing initially expressed little public concern about the
 April 1978 coup that installed the pro-Soviet Taraki regime in
 Kabul, and it recognized the new government within two weeks.
 China assumed that Afghan nationalism would assert itself even-
 tually, as it had in the previous Daoud regime.  As Soviet involve-
 ment in Afghanistan increased, however, Beijing sharpened its
 criticism of the USSR.  China was circumpect in its public comments
 about the Kabul government
 China maintained correct relations with both Taraki and Amin
 and retained a diplomatic mission in Kabul.   In March 1979, China
 gave Afghanistan a 250-bed hospital in Kandahar.   In the same
 month it signed a protocol for the construction of a textile mill
 in Bagrami.  In October the two countries signed an annual protocol
 (several months after an earlier protocol had expired) that called
 for some $6-7 million in mutual trade; Afghanistan had earlier
 agreed to deliver 5,000 tons of cotton to China.     Beijing's main

 We have no conclusive evidence of direct Chinese assistance

 Moscow and Kabul.  Reports of Beijing's willingness to furnish
 such assistance are contradictor v.
 China's major concern abcut the situation in
 Afghanistan appeared to be that it would lead to greater instability
 in  this  ranion
 After the Invasion
 China has kept open its mission in Kabul since the Soviet
 invasion, but it has not recognized the Babrak Karmal regime and
 has also urged Pakistan not to recognize it.

 By 18 January, however, Beijing had
 apparently changed its view and began to make disparaging public
 comments about "Soviet puppets in Kabul."  By mid-February China
 reportedly decided to suspend all trade relations with Afghanistan.
 We have no conclusive evidence that China is currently aiding
 the Afghan rebels.  Beijing is known to be willing to supply arms
 through Pakistan; Chinese diplomats have stated this willingness
 to numerous foreign officials.  Pakistan, however, was reported in
 January and February to be hesitant to cooperate with China in aiding
 the rebels until it has a foreign military aid commitment large enough
 to allow Islamabad to offer strop  resistance to a  ossible Soviet
 invasion.
 While China denies assistance to Afghan rebels, it has strongly
 endorsed their cause.  In media comments, Beijing has repeatedly
 stressed the need for the continued struggle of the Afghan people
 and also their need to unite.  In late January, for example, the commen-
 tator in an article in Renmin Ribao entitled "Unite and Persist in

 Afghan Muslims" as a possible beginning of unity among the resistance.
 Chinese media also stress the brutality of the Soviet occupation.
