 Communist China's Economy -- Current and Future
 It is a great pleasure to be at the Naval War College and to
 have the opportunity to discuss with you gentlemen the rapidly
 developing Chinese economy.  Today, we in the United States are
 primarily concerned with combatting the challenge posed by the Soviet
 Union.  And this course of action is eminently sound, for the USSR
 is not only pre-eminent within the Communist Bloc, but its formidable
 military, economic, subversive, and political power is also freely
 acknowledged to be dedicated to the liquidation of capitalism.
 Now, I cannot claim to have a particularly clear crystal
 ball, specifically designed to peer a generation ahead.  But let
 me state a personal conviction, that within 25 years we will face
 a second, and equally dangerous challenge, from the present junior
 partner in the Bloc, Communist China.
 The Communists took over Mainland China in 1949.  The period
 of detailed planning for forced draft industrial growth did not
 begin until 1953.  Just seven days ago Mao and his comrades
 celebrated the tenth anniversary of their accession to power.  During
 this short space of ten years, Communist China's leaders have driven
 the economy ahead in dedicated and ruthless fashion. They have
 made substantial progress in transforming a backward agricultural
 country into an industrial nation.  In 1958, the year which Peiping
 described as the 'great leap forward," by pressing for'increases in

 physical output at almost any cost, they succeeded in producing 20
 percent more goods than in 1957.  This is not the official Chinese
 claim, which is substantially higher, but our own reconstruction
 of probable performance.
 Let me give you a few figures.  Steel production 10 years
 ago was less than one million tons. It has now risen to a level
 which is challenging the output of Japan, China's major economic
 competitor in Asia.  China is now the seventh largest producer
 of steel in the world.
 One further example, that of cement.  Communist China has
 doubled its output of cement over the past three years.  It is
 now producing over 11 million tons annually, which, for this
 commodity, puts it in the same league with Great Britain.
 China - India Comparison
 To put this dynamic economic growth in perspective, it is
 helpful to compare the recent history of China with that of India.
 I have some overall statistics to show you.
 (Briefing Aid -- China and India,
 Gross National Product and Investment)
 1.   The column at the far left is an estimate of total
 output, or gross national product, in China and India for the
 year 1952.  The red is China; the blue India.  You can see that
 in that year, China's gross national product, or GNP, was about i.7

 billion U.S. dollars, or slightly more than 40 percent I~ ^than
 that of India.
 2.  Moving across to 1958, you can see that total output
 for China had increased to over 75 billion dollars.  It was now
 about 80 percent greater than that of India, compared to 4.0 percent
 greater only six years earlier.
 3.  Continuing across the chart, we can see one of the
 principal reasons, if indeed not the key reason, for China's
 superior performance. In the final analysis, the rate of economic
 growth is heavily dependent upon the rate of savings, and the plow-
 back of these savings in the form of investment.  You can see two
 significant facts about Chinese investment in 1958:
 a.  First, that it was about 15 billion
 dollars, or over four times as much as that of India,
 and second,
 b.  That even on a per capita basis, Chinese
 investment was more than twice that of India.
 The far more rapid rate of growth of the Chinese economy
 undoubtedly has a "demonstration effect" on the newly emergent
 countries of Free Asia.  These countries are characterized by
 intense nationalism, coupled with the determination to achieve a
 better way of life.  Rightly or wrongly, they are convinced that
 rapid industrialization is the true path to progress.  The leaders
 in Peiping are alert to the opportunity which this great trans-
 formation provides them.                                  In their propaganda to Southeast Asia,

 they stress China's rapid growth, and point to Communism as the
 magic blueprint which made it possible.
 Difficulties with Chinese Statistics
 Before going any further into the Chinese economy, I want to
 spend a few minutes on a subject which may be troubling some
 of you, and that is the reliability of Chinese Communist statistics.
 These statistics, which are based on Soviet concepts, have always
 displayed the general limitations that characterize Bloc data.  In
 addition, there have been weaknesses arising from Chinese Communist
 inexperience, faulty organization, and lack of figures.
 However, these weaknesses were being gradually overcome
 prior to 1958.  By 1954, the statistical system was operating
 at a considerably higher level of competence than in previous years,
 and a greater proportion of economic activity had come under the
 control of the State.  Therefore, data covering the years 1954-57
 were considered relatively good.
 In 1958 there was a pronounced deterioration.  Under the
 slogan, "let politics lead economics," statistical reporting was
 prostituted to political propaganda.  Local leaders were encouraged
 to set high production goals in order to encourage "production
 enthusiasm."  Under these circumstances, where local leaders
 were afraid to report the truth, it is not surprising that the
 central statistical authorities lost control of the situation.
 Approved For Release 2000/09/1I CIA-RDP   00545A000100090004-3
 Approved For Release 2000/09/11  CIA-RDP62$00545A000100090004-3
 Now, if one fact is certain about the running of a highly
 centralized economy, it is the need for reliable data.  For
 example, the planners cannot allocate to the export account
 non-existent materials in payment for needed imports.   Freight
 cars sent to a province reporting a food surplus come back empty.
 As a result, workers go hungry.  In short, the authorities at a
 minimum quickly find themselves in serious difficulties.
 We who had been following the reported data wondered how
 long this period of statistical nonsense could continue.  The
 answer was, of course, not very long.  Some of you may recall
 reading in the newspapers a month ago of the dramatic recantation
 by the Chinese leaders, who admitted that many of their statistics
 for 1958 and 1959 had been grossly overstated.  For example, they
 had claimed that grain production was 375 million tons in 1958, or
 double 1957's output, and this incredible figure was "reassessed"
 to 250 million tons.  The data presented in this morning's talk
 are based upon independent estimates made by people in my office,
 who believe that some of the revised Chinese output claims for
 agriculture are still too high.
 It is one of the ironies of history that, if the Chinese
 propagandists had told the world the truth, if they had stated
 no more than their actual achievements, the story would have been
 most impressive.  As it now stands, the primary effect of Chinese
 exaggerations has been to make outside observers skeptical of any
 of Peiping's claims.

 Soviet Aid to China
 I would like to turn now to another point that we should dispose
 of early this morning.  That point is the role the Soviet Union has
 played in China's economic achievements.
 There is no doubt that Soviet economic assistance has played
 an important part in the rapid build-up of industry in Communist
 China.  The regime has relied upon the Soviet Union and the
 European satellites for the more modern complex machinery and
 equipment needed.  While the domestic Chinese machinery manufacturing
 industry has grown rapidly, China was still dependent upon im-
 ported equipment for 30 percent of its requirements at the end of
 1958 -- more than half of which was Soviet-manufactured equipment.
 The large modern plants which the Chinese Communist periodically
 .exhibit as examples of current progress invariably turn out to
 have been Soviet-designed, Soviet-equipped and, often, put into
 pilot operation under the direction of Soviet technical advisors.
 Soviet aid in Chinese industrial construction has been concentrated
 on these large modern plants -- an excellent division of labor --
 and the Chinese leaders very rightly refer to these projects as the
 backbone of their industrial program.  Let me show you some overall
 figures which may help to put these relationships in perspective
 (Briefing Aid -- Communist China:
 Sources of Supply of Machinery and Equipment 1953-57, 1958)
 1.  This chart shows the relationship, in percentage
 terms, between interval and external sources of supply for industrial

 equipment.  The first column is the average for the years 1953-57,
 and the second column is for the year 1958.
 2.  You can see at the top that whereas Communist China
 supplied about 60 percent of her own needs for machinery and
 equipment in the five year period ending in 1957, that the trend
 was toward greater self sufficiency.  In 1958, 70 percent came
 from domestic sources, aided of course, by the opening of machine
 building plants equipped with Soviet tools.
 3.  The very small portion of machinery supplied by
 the Free World, 2 percent, is represented by the thin blue line
 in both columns.
 4.  Finally, you can see that the importance of the
 USSR and the European Satellites as a source of supply has been
 declining.  In our first column, the Soviet Bloc accounted for 38
 percent of total supply, compared to 28 percent in the most recent
 year.
 It is important to realize that while the Soviet Bloc has
 met Communist China's need for the import of capital goods, only
 a small part of this was on credit.  There is no evidence that
 China has received a single red kopek of economic grants from the
 USSR.  Aside from military loans, all that Peiping has received
 from Moscow over the past ten years is two economic loans, totaling
 $430 millions.  Finally, not only have all China's imports from
 the USSR been on a pay-as-you-go basis since 1956, but China has
 also been paying off the Soviet loans of previous years.

 The point is that economic relations between the two countries
 are on a businesslike basis. China does not act like a poor
 relation in these dealings; indeed the posture of near equality
 probably is a reflection of national pride.  At any rate, I think
 it is clear that the picture of China as a kind of bottomless
 pit down which Soviet wealth is being poured is a completely mis-
 leading one.
 Having covered briefly two subjects which I thought might
 be particularly troublesome -- first, the reliability of Chinese
 statistics, and second, the role of the Soviet Union in China's
 economic development, I propose to move on to outline some basic
 features of the Communist economic system.
 I stress communist rather than Chinese because all communist
 systems have a great deal in common.  The economy of China, as is
 also true in the Soviet Union, is shaped to serve the goals of the
 state, not the people.  What are these goals?  First, there is the
 driving ambition to transform China into a great world power.
 The achievement of great power status requires the industrialization
 of what is still essentially an underdeveloped country.
 The impatience of the present leaders of the Chinese Communist
 Party, a group of first generation revolutionaries, is reflected
 in the frantic, and indeed ruthless, pace of industrialization.
 The Communes
 The frantic pace of industrialization was established in the
 1958 "great leap forward" campaign.  The essence of this campaign
 Approved For Release 2000/09`/1' : C1A     S00545A000100090004-3
 Approved For Release 2000/09/11 : CIA-RDP62SO0545A000100090004-3
 was to mobilize the vast labor potential of China's population.
 The commune system was the form of organization and control chosen
 to implement the great leap forward program.
 The communes represent the most radical formula for re-
 organizing society attempted anywhere in recent times.  They go
 far beyond anything tried in the Soviet Union.
 They are tightly-knit, multipurpose administrative units
 which gather together in one package management of all agricultural,
 industrial I commercial, cultural, and military affairs in a
 given locality.  Generally, the commune coincides with the township
 boundaries, and includes about 5,000 families.  Once organized,
 a commune takes over all property and in the extreme case absorbs
 all privately held garden plots, fruit trees, and domestic animals.
 Within the commune, all the members, both men and women,
 are organized along military lines into production brigades.
 Among the most revolutionary aspects of the communes are those
 affecting the day-to-day life of the people.  Communal messhalls
 have been set up to replace private dining, and children are being
 placed in communal nurseries.  Old people are placed in1"happy
 homes" where they are assigned productive tasks within their physical
 capabilities, such as looking after the chickens.  These moves jtend-
 ing to break up the traditional family have proved to be the most
 repelling aspects of the commune to many of China's peasants and
 to the Overseas Chinese.

 The pace of work achieved is incredible by Western standards.
 There is plenty of evidence to show that the work day was, and
 still is in some cases, 18 hours.  Everyone was put to work.
 Small children were assigned to pulling weeds, grade school
 children made shoes, housewives dug ditches and stoked iron
 furnaces, and the old folks tended the hogs.  Excesses by local
 authorities became so general that the regime imposed a maximum
 work day of 12 hours.
 The commune program constitutes the biggest domestic gamble
 made by Communist China to date.  As of now, the communes remain
 in an experimental stage.  Many of the extreme communal practices
 have been at least temporarily discarded.  Communes represent
 an overturn of an ancient way of living and thinking, and they
 represent a call on human energy above what even the long-suffering
 Chinese may accept.  This is a far cry from the "new communist man"
 the communes are supposed to create.  However, the Chinese Communists
 have already demonstrated the ability to do many things which a
 decade ago would have seemed impossible, in view of the traditional
 character of Chinese society.  We believe that communes are here
 to stay.  However, the regime -- which has proved itself pragmatic
 and opportunistic -- may well modify the rules of the game and
 still call the resulting organizations "communes."  In short, it
 seems unlikely that the regime will have to choose between a blood
 bath or the abandonment of the communal experiment.  Once the

 commune system is tested and consolidated in rural areas, we
 believe it will be introduced in modified form in urban areas.
 Economic Decision Making
 We can pass now from the organization of people to the
 organization of government, with particular reference to the
 economic chain of command.
 (Briefing Aid -- Communist China:
 Typical Economic Chain of Command)
 1.  The Chinese economy, being a command economy, gets
 its orders and basic direction from the Communist Party.  At the
 top left of our chart, you will see the Party Central Committee.
 The major economic policy decisions are made by the Politburo
 of the Central Committee.  This group of about 20 party leaders
 is presided over by Mao Tse-tung.
 2.  In the top center of our chart is the State Council,
 headed by Chou En-lai.  Once the top party leaders have spelled
 out the major economic policies, it is the responsibility of the
 State Council, the highest executive organ, to draw up the
 national economic plan.  This top level administrative group
 executes all economic planning and administration in China.
 3.  Attached to the State Council are two planning
 commissions, shown on the upper right of the chart.  These are the
 National Economic Commission, responsible for annual plans, and
 headed by Po-l-Po, and the State Planning Commission, headed by

 Li Fu-chun, which is responsible for the five year plans.  Today,
 the regime is in the second year of the Second Five Year Plan
 period, 1958-62.
 4.  The second layer in the economic control structure
 is comprised of nine specialized industrial ministries -- iron
 and steel, coal, petroleum, construction, machine building, chemicals,
 electric power, light industry and textiles.  The armament producing
 plants are attached to the Ministry of Machine Building.
 5.  Most enterprises, about 80 percent at last count,
 are under the managerial direction of local governments, rather than
 under the specialized ministries.  The trend has been to more de-
 centralized control, following the November 1957 managerial reform.
 Actually, the plants still subordinate to the specialized ministries
 are really under dual authority, because they are dependent on
 local governments for manpower and commodity allocation.  Finally,
 the individual plants play a part in the planning procedure,
 drafting plans to cover their own expected level of output and
 requirements for labor and raw materials.
 Chinese economic planare directed to builder up heavy
 industry in the shortest possible time.  Living standards are kept

 large and increasing proportion of the nation's total output.
 Investment, as a proportion of total output, is now almost 30
 percent, compared with 21 percent in the United States, and 27
 percent in the Soviet Union.
 Chinese Communist investment policy calls for nine times as
 much investment in heavy industry as in the industries producing
 consumer goods.  As a result of this policy, the great masses of
 people work very hard to produce more,but do not enjoy proportion-
 ately higher levels of living.  The regime's purpose is to press
 for continued economic growth and to leave the improvement of
 living standards to the future.  Let me emphasize this general
 point, which is true of the Soviet Union as well as of Communist
 China -- not only is investment a higher percent of total output
 than is the case in the US, but a larger share of investment goes
 into the industries which are important from the point of view
 of basic economic and basic military strength.
 Population - Agricultural Production
 I would like to pass along to a brief consideration of some
 of the problems facing the leaders of Communist China, specifically
 to those problems which have a critical effect on economic growth.
 The first of these is really a set of three matters -- population,
 food supply, and foreign trade -- which are so closely bound to-
 gether that it is probably best to consider them as a single
 package.
 Approved For Release 2000/09/' 1   1"bA6.2S00545A000100090004-3
 Approved For Release 2000/09/11 CIA-RDP62S00545A000100090004-3
 One ancient problem which has been temporarily pushed into
 the background by the success of the 1958 harvest is the pressure
 of population on food supply.  The population of Communist China
 is now estimated at 680 million persons.  It is increasing at a
 rate of 2  percent a year, or 16 million persons, which is a
 number almost equal to the present population of Canada or East
 Germany.
 The Chinese leaders currently claim the vastness of their
 population is an asset rather than a liability.  They state that
 emphasis should be placed on people as producers, rather than as
 consumers.  If the population continues to grow at the present
 rate, the numbers soon become very large indeed.
 (Briefing Aid:  Communist China Population)
 1.  You can see that over the past ten years, the
 population of China has increased by about 100 million people,
 from 580 million to 680 million.  However, because the base is
 now larger, it will take less than seven years to add the next
 100 million, compared with ten years; that is, 1949-59-
 2.                                       Further, by 1975, if past trends of increase prove
 to be reliable guides, China's population will exceed the one
 billion mark.  This would be an absolute increase of 330 million
 in 16 years.

 One key question is whether or not the food supply can be
 expanded rapidly enough to feed such numbers.  Our agricultural
 analysts have looked at the prospects over the next five years.
 They believe that food production over this relatively short
 period of time will grow somewhat more rapidly than population.
 If these estimates are correct, then the food supply-population
 relationship should ease moderately.  Naturally, successive
 years of poor harvests, a sudden increase in the birth rate, or
 a decline in mortality rates could change this forecast.
 If the food situation does get tighter, the regime could
 again call for vigorous birth control measures.  You may remember
 that in 1957, faced with a marginal food supply, the Chinese
 leaders launched such a campaign.  Although they have been sub-
 merged in the leap forward, official birth control programs still
 continue on a small and unpublicized scale.  It is my own opinion
 that, in the long run, the regime will be forced to resort to
 programs which will reduce the birth rate.  I believe that the
 problem is not so much one of population outrunning food supply
 as it is one of finding rewards to increase worker incentives.
 One major step in this direction would be to increase the
 quantity, and particularly the quality, of foodstuffs.  The Chinese
 diet is monotonous and low quality by western standards.  Although
 there was an increase in grain stocks in 1956, foods rich in protein
 and fat, such as pork, eggs, and fish, have been gradually dis-
 appearing from the people's diet.  This cannot help but be a drag

 on worker incentives.  With the disillusionment of the workers
 with the regime, tangible steps must be taken to improve in-
 centives.  The alternative would be to jeopardize the program of
 rapid industrialization.
 Finally, the Chinese are faced with the problem of increasing
 exports of foodstuffs to pay for imports of needed machinery
 and industrial raw materials.  Let's look at a few figures.
 (Briefing Aid -- Communist China,
 Percentage Distribution of Foreign Trade)
 1.  You can see from the size of these circles that
 China's foreign trade tripled between 1950 and 1958.
 2.   Although this chart does not show it, the proportion
 of Chinese exports accounted for by agricultural raw materials and
 foodstuffs decreased during the period.  However, in absolute
 volume, such exports amounted to more than twice as much in 1958
 as in 1950, and were the most important single category of exports.
 3.  Of some interest, although not pertinent to the
 main line of our discussion, is the fact that China's trade with
 the Free World has been increasingly important over the past four
 years, while her trade with the Bloc has been declining as a
 share of total trade.
 The principal thrust of a failure to deal successfully with
 the population, food supply, and export availability complex of
 problems would be   11          a lowering of the rate of economic

 growth.  The achievement of Communist China's dreams of future
 power depends most heavily on a high rate of capital accumulation.
 To raise China from its backward status to a modern nation
 requires vast amounts of capital and considerable equipment imports.
 Agricultural production must generate much of this capital,
 which means that it must provide a substantial surplus over and
 above present restricted levels of consumption.
 Transportation
 I would like to move along to a further problem, that of
 uneven development.  Forced draft industrialization and the "leap
 forward" created serious imbalances between the various sectors
 of the economy.  Nowhere were these more obvious than in the field
 of transportation.
 The railroads carry 80 percent of the nation's freight.
 China has a territory which is somewhat larger than that of the
 United States, and with approximately the same east-west spread.
 Yet, when the Communists gained control, they inherited a railroad
 system which was only 16,000 miles in length compared to the 220,000
 miles of main-line track in the US.  Today, in addition to revamping
 and modernizing the entire railroad system, the Chinese Communists
 have added 6,000 miles of new routes, pushing the railroads west-
 ward into the hitherto unreached frontier areas of China, and have
 done extensive double tracking.
 In addition to the railroad system being much too small for
 the huge territory to be covered, and for the amount of freight

 of the rail system was concentrated in northeastern China, the
 area formerly called Manchuria, and the remainder was primarily
 two north-south trunk lines in the eastern sector, leaving large areas
 of China with little or no rail service.  It was a situation
 which would be roughly comparable to having one-half of all the
 railroads in the United States located in New England and the
 bulk of the remaining track clustered around New York City and
 Philadelphia.  Let's look at the map.
 (Briefing Aid -- Communist China:
 Railroad Construction, 19+9-59)
 1.  The green lines show the extention of trackage since
 1949.  The line identified as No. 1, going through Lan-chou and
 extending to Ha-mi, taps the rich oilfields of Yumen.  This line
 is now being extended to the Soviet border at Dzungarian Gate,
 and is scheduled for completion next year.
 2.  Line 2, has been completed south to Chunking.  It
 will hook up with the Krei-yang extention, to form a new major
 north-south line.
 3.  Line 5 is essentially a strategic line extending
 in two prongs to the coast opposite Taiwan.  Another strategic
 addition is line 7, running through North Vietnam to Hanoi.
 11. Although not shown on the map, the main exphasis
 in 1958 and 1959 has been on double tracking already existing
 main lines.    This includes the Peking-Canton line and the Tientsin-
 Nanking-Shanghai route.

 Despite these additions, railroad mileage is still too small
 and badly located, and is supporting the economy at its present
 level only with very considerable difficulty.  In the face of an
 overall transportation shortage in 1958, priority was given to
 heavy industry in the use of transport facilities.  This con-
 tributed to serious food shortages in some urban areas, and probably
 to the decline in exports which took place late in the year.
 The effort put forth by native transport during 1958 was
 staggering.  According to Minister of Communications Wang Shou-tao:
 "On the steel and iron transportation line, there
 were not only the professional (workers), but also
 millions of peasants of both sexes and all ages.  The
 army, navy, and air force also mobilized motor vehicles,
 fleets of vessels, and airplanes to render assistance.
 They formed a big army of transportation which did not
 exist before."
 The waste involved must have been fantastic.  There were
 millions of people moving over the land with backpacks or
 wheelbarrows full of coal and iron ore.  Sometimes 60 to 70
 percent of a local labor force would be used in transportation to
 supply the small native blast furnaces, which were turning out
 an inferior or even unusable product.
 The Chinese government's decision to devote 21 percent of
 1959 investment to transportation and communications, compared
 with 13 percent in 1958, constitutes a solid attack on the

 ,wA  AAi~
 transportation crisis.  Freight car production was scheduled
 to increase 22 times in 1959? A sharp reduction in the output
 of native blast furnaces will also ease the burden in the short
 run.  However, many serious problems remain.  The burden on the
 railroads over the next several years can be expected to increase
 roughly in proportion to industrial production.  At least for
 the next several years, the allocation of transportation priorities
 will be a major headache to the Chinese planners.
 Future Prospects
 I would like to turn now to the future prospects of China's
 economy.  Having briefly drawn your attention to some of the major
 problems which the Communist leadership face, I would like to
 mention some of the fundamental assets to be found on the credit
 side of the ledger.  It is important not to underestimate China's
 prospects for developing into a strong, highly industrialized
 economy.
 First of all, she has all of the basic natural resources
 needed by an industrial power based on present day technology.
 She has sufficient iron ore and coking coal to become at least
 the leading steel producer in Asia.  Even today, China is the
 third largest producer of coal in the world.  Given the availability
 of the essential natural resources, there is every reason to take
 seriously the communist leaders' plans for future industrial
 development, even if the targets may turn out to be somewhat
 exaggerated.

 Secondly, China's economic system, being state-controlled
 and centrally directed, can channel a far higher proportion of
 total output into investment than can free enterprise economies.
 The communist system seems well suited to a high investment-rapid
 growth type of economy; the free enterprise system to an economy
 of high consumption.
 Thirdly, the regime has succeeded in harnessing the labor
 potential W China's vast population to the economic develop-
 went program.
 Finally, industrialization requires an abundance of technical
 equipment and skills, both of which are in short supply in China.
 However, the other countries of the Communist Bloc, particularly
 the Soviet Union, have backed up China's efforts by providing
 large-scale technical assistance and by selling her essential
 equipment.  This means that China's future growth is not vulnerable
 to Western economic warfare.
 All this adds up to a conviction that China will continue
 to grow rapidly during the remaining years of the Second Five
 Year Plan, which ends in 1962.  Let me try to put this growth in
 some perspective.
 (Briefing Aid -- Communist China:
 Gross National Product)
 1.  This chart shows total annual production of goods
 and services, or GNP, for the years 1952-62.  The projection to

 Approved For Release 2000/09/11 : CIA-RDP62SO0545A000100090004-3
 1962 is based on an estimate that China will be able to increase
 its GNP by 10 percent a year over the next three years.  This rate
 would be significantly lower than the "leap forward" progress
 of 1958.   However, it would be a remarkably high rate by Western
 standards.
 2.  While agriculture would still be the largest single
 sector of the economy, its importance would have dropped from
 45 percent in 1957 to 33 percent in 1962.  At the same time, the
 absolute value of agricultural production is expected to increase
 about 30 percent over the five year plan period.
 3.  Finally, industrial output is expected to more than
 double over the five year plan period ending in 1962.  Industry,
 if this forecast is correct, would then account for about 27 percent
 of total output, compared to only less than 17 percent in 1957.
 In general, it appears that the production of.important
 industrial commodities will by 1962 be at levels which would have
 seemed inconceivable to foreign observers before the remarkable
 successes of 1958.  For example, should the present accelerated
 schedules of plants and delivery of equipment for the iron and
 steel industry be fulfilled, it is estimated that the output of
 crude steel in 1962 can be upped to 20 million tons of steel that
 is useable by Chinese standards.  Even though only about one-half
 of the 20 million tons would be considered of good quality by
 Western standards, it would still place Communist China among the

 major steel producers in the world.  In any case, if China
 produces 20 million tons of crude steel in 1962, it will be an
 almost unprecedented economic achievement by all previous
 standards.  Living conditions, of course, would still be pain-
 fully low by Western standards, and the price for the nation's
 economic gains would have been paid by the Chinese people.
 Implications of Rapid Economic Growth
 In conclusion, I would like to draw your attention to some
 of the implications of Communist China's expected progress on
 the economic front.
 First of all, rapid economic growth will provide the Peiping
 leaders with additional resources with which to maintain large,
 and increasingly modern, armed forces.  Her military forces today
 are about equal to those of all Free Asian countries combined.  With
 the help of its Soviet ally, Communist China has been able to
 undertake the production of modern artillery, jet aircraft, tanks,
 and submarines.  More importantly, an increasing proportion of
 the component parts for these items is now being produced by the
 Chinese.  She has now advanced beyond the "assembly stage" in which
 Soviet-made parts were put together in Chinese factories.  If
 recent trends and present policies continue, China's military
 spending could significantly increase in the next three years
 without increasing the relative burden on their economy.
 Secondly, Communist China can now supply over half of all her
 requirements for equipment and supplies essential to its industrialization

 program.  Three years from now, domestic equipment manufacturing
 facilities, based on present plans, are expected to provide three-
 fourths of their needs for equipment and suppples.  This increasing
 capability to produce large-scale precision machine-tools, mining
 and metallurgical processing machinery, aircraft, and submarines,
 will go a long way towards decreasing Communist China's dependence
 on foreign arms and manufactured goods.
 Thirdly, Communist China will continue to have a growing
 influence on Bloc foreign policy.  As the strongest Asian power,
 Peiping's impact will be most felt in Asia.  However, her ambitions
 are not limited to that continent. Following the 21st Party
 Congress in Moscow this February, the South American Communist
 delegates went home via Peiping.  China apparently now shares
 with the Soviet Union the responsibility for Communist penetration
 and subversion in Latin America.  They recently purchased a news-
 paper in Havana, and the Chinese are now active in the
 communist propaganda and cultural front activities throughout
 South America as well as beginning subversive training of Latino
 commies in Peiping.
 Fourthly, in its foreign economic relations, Peiping has
 already given clear evidence of its desire to employ some of
 its new economic strength in trade and foreign aid as a weapon in
 economic competition with the West.  It has already extended aid
 in the form of loans or grants to Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon,  Egypt,
 Indonesia, Nepal and Yemen.

 And finally, I would repeat a point I made at the opening
 of this talk.  That point is the "demonstration effect" of the
 dynamic growth of China on the newly emergent countries of Free
 Asia.  These countries are determined to "leap forward" into the
 twentieth century through rapid industrialization.  The Chinese
 leaders are alert to the opportunity which this great trans-
 formation provides them.  Potentially, I believe this is the
 most serious threat to our national security.
