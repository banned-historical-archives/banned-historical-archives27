FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
SAUDI ARABIA 
The Saudis may substantially increase 
their investment in US private equities, 
US government securities, and--to a lesser 
extent?real estate this year. 
Major Saudi investment plans include: 
--Purchase, barring adverse US reaction, of up 
to $1 billion in US equities this year. The 
limit will be 5-7 percent of the shares of any 
single company. 
--Purchase of between $1.5-$2.5 billion of US 
Treasury bills through the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York in the first quarter of this year. 
Additional purchases are expected in the spring. 
Saudi investment institutions will be modified 
to facilitate the shift. An investment advisory 
board composed of US and European financial experts 
will assist the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency in 
evaluating equity and government security purchases. 
This monetary agency is to have representation in 
London and possibly in New York. A real estate ad-
visory board is also planned. 
In the past, the Saudis have been very conserv-
ative in the placement of their surplus oil reve-
nues. At the end of 1974, over four fifths of 
Saudi Arabia's minimum total of $18.7 billion in 
foreign holdings were held in bank deposits and 
other liquid assets. About 80 percent of Saudi 
foreign assets were dollar-denominated.

EGYPT-FRANCE 
President Sadat left Paris yester-
day with the promise of sizable French 
arms sales. The French will also con-
sider a wide range of economic projects 
in Egypt. 
Sadat announced at a press conference in Paris 
that Egypt would be buying Mirage F-1 aircraft. Un-
named French sources have told the press that 50 
planes are involved. 
Egypt is already taking delivery 
Mirage aircraft, thought to be Mirage 
agreements concluded by Saudi Arabia, 
Abu Dhabi on Egypt's behalf. As many 
craft may eventually be delivered; by 
nine of these planes may be in Egypt. 
of other 
5s, under 
Kuwait, and 
as 72 air-
February, 
While in Paris, Sadat made a much-publicized 
tour of Thomson-CSF, the producer of Crotale surface-
to-air missiles and electronic equipment. War pro-
duction minister General Badri is remaining in 
France for further discussion with Thomson officials. 
A pointed reference in the communique issued 
at the end of the visit--France's agreement to sell 
Egypt arms as partial compensation for war losses--
probably was included at Sadat's request. Sadat 
has made much in recent public statements of Mos-
cow's failure to provide Egypt with replacement 
equipment. His activity in Paris is yet another 
reminder that he can go elsewhere to obtain at 
least some of Egypt's military needs. 
Sadat took care during his press conference 
to avoid giving the impression that new arms will 
impede the progress of talks with Israel. He re-
peatedly emphasized that delivery of the Mirages 
will take several years. He also reiterated his 
position that Egypt and Syria have no intention of 
starting a new war.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
Few firm aareements appear to have been made 
for French economic cooperation, although Sadat and 
French President Giscard held extensive economic 
discussions. Agreement was reached on construction 
of a conventional electric power plant and on a sys-
tem for color television. 
The communique's call for "guaranteed borders" 
adds a refinement to the language of UN Resolution 
242, which calls only for "secure and .recognized 
borders," reflecting France's desire to take part 
in settlement efforts. 
Sadat said he would welcome French troops to 
guarantee the border in a final peace settlement, 
if they were positioned on both sides. He firmly 
discounted rumors that he would ask for French in-
volvement in current negotiations, but did say that 
"in a coming stage" France and all of Western Eu-
rope should play a role.

PORTUGAL 
The Communist Party and some other 
leftist groups have called off the demon-
stration they had scheduled in Lisbon 
Friday. If the Socialists cancel their 
demonstration as well, the chances of vio-
lence this weekend will be reduced. 
The Communists' cancellation came in response 
to an announcement by the Armed Forces Movement 
that demonstrations should not take place. The Com-
munists, whose demonstration had been planned to 
draw off support from the Socialist rally that they 
expected to be a big success, were no doubt grati-
fied by the government's announcement. The announce-
ment indicates that the Armed Forces Movement can 
still act as a body, even though seriously divided 
between moderates and radicals. 
The government's concern over the rival dem-
onstrations increased yesterday when a Maoist party 
announced it planned to meet at the same location 
as the Socialists. The Socialists, at the time 
determined to make their show of strength in spite 
of competition, changed locations to avoid conflict. 
The announced times and places of the three demon-
strations, however, were so close that planned or 
spontaneous clashes were still possible. 
Before the announcement by the Armed Forces 
Movement, the Socialist leader, Foreign Minister. 
Soares, told Ambassador Carlucci that his party 
would go ahead with its demonstration, even if the 
government canceled it. The Socialists, neverthe-
less, may now back down. 
The Maoist group may not be as willing to fol-
low suit. Press reports indicate that the party 
is prepared to hold its demonstration in defiance 
of a government ban. 
If the Maoists do not have the Socialists to 
demonstrate against, they may substitute a new 
cause--the ten-day NATO antisubmarine exercise that 
began yesterday in international waters near Lisbon. 
The Maoists have been joined in condemning these 
operations by the Popular Socialist Front, a radical 
Catholic group that recently split from the Social-
ist Party.

GREECE-NATO 
The Greek government apparently is 
not yet ready to discuss in detail the 
consequences of its decision to withdraw 
from NATO's integrated military command. 
Athens had informed NATO on December 4 that it 
was prepared then to discuss questions raised by its 
decision to withdraw. In a conversation on January 
28 with our ambassador in Athens, however, a high 
Foreign Ministry official noted his desire not to 
cause unnecessary problems for NATO activities in 
Greece. In particular, Athens wants to ensure the 
continued operation of the NATO missile firing in-
stallation on Crete. The official explained that 
his government was still in the process of determin-
ing its relationship with NATO and would, therefore, 
prefer not to take a position on the fate of spe-
cific NATO facilities in Greece at this time. 
The Greek military establishment seems to 
favor the maintenance of as many ties to NATO as 
politically possible. While Prime Minister Kara-
manlis probably sympathizes with this position, he 
is also mindful of the popularity of last summer's 
decision to withdraw from NATO's integrated mili-
tary command.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
CHINA 
The appointment of two high-ranking 
officials--Teng Hsiao-ping and Chang Chun-
chiao--as army chief of staff and head 
of the army's political department re-
spectively, strengthens party control 
over the armed forces. Both Teng and 
Chang are civilian members of the Polit-
buro standing committee. 
Teng Hsiao-ping is the ranking vice premier 
and has been filling in for Premier Chou En-lai 
since the Premier entered the hospital last year. 
Teng had a distinguished military career during the 
civil war, but has been a party and government ad-
ministrator since then. 
Chang Chun-chiao, the new head of the army's 
General Political Department, is also a vice pre-
mier. He rose to the top party post in Shanghai 
as a result of the Cultural Revolution, but appears 
to have been working fairly closely with moderate 
elements in the leadership for the past several 
years. 
he has moved toward the political cen-
ter. Chang does not have an extensive military 
background and is reported to have clashed on a 
number of occasions with powerful professional mil-
itary figures. 
Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying, a senior party 
vice chairman, outranks Teng and Chang within the 
party hierarchy. In the government, however, they 
outrank him since they are both vice premiers and 
he is not. Party ranking is, of course, more im-
portant, and the bureaucratic demotion of the de-
fense portfolio appears to be a downgrading of the 
military establishment rather than of Yeh Chien-
ying himself. 
Teng's appointment apparently reflects the 
wishes of Chairman Mao Tse-tung. Mao reportedly 
told a Politburo meeting in December 1973 that Teng 
would make "an excellent chief of staff." There 
was almost certainly opposition from the political 
left to Teng's appointment; he had been purged dur-
ing the Cultural Revolution.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
Although Teng will probably enlarge his role in 
military policy making, it is not yet clear whether 
he will handle day-to-day military affairs. His 
broad government duties would seem to demand much of 
his time unless Premier Chou's health permits Chou 
to resume a more active role in government affairs. 
Teng may rely heavily on his eight deputy chiefs of 
staff, several of whom possess the necessary expe-
rience to fill the job themselves. 
Chang Chun-chiao will oversee the implementa-
tion of party policy in the armed forces. This job 
is congruent with ?that of party secretary-general, 
which Chang also seems to have been filling.

WESTERN HEMISPHERE 
Some hemispheric countries are be-
ginning to press local subsidiaries of 
US companies to do business with Cuba. 
This pressure has become stronger since 
the US authorized sales to Havana by US 
auto subsidiaries in Argentina. 
Mexico is in the forefront of this activity, 
but Canada and Colombia also could play a signifi-
cant role. 
Subsidiaries of US automotive manufacturers 
were told flatly last week by the Mexican govern-
ment that they must obtain whatever permission is 
necessary so that they can export to Cuba. The In-
stitute of Foreign Trade also asked all firms with 
an exporting capability to participate in Mexico's 
March trade fair in Cuba. 
Failure to respond to these requests undoubt-
edly will jeopardize the Mexican operations of 
those US companies which work under a system that 
links production and component import quotas partly 
to export performance. If the trade requests are 
not favorably received in Washington, the Mexican 
reaction most likely would be orchestrated criti-
cism. Furthermore, although there have been no 
threats of such action, Mexico has legislation 
that could be invoked to nationalize the US sub-
sidiaries if they refuse to sell to Cuba. 
Canada, prompted by a US firm's recent can-
cellation of a contract between its Canadian sub-
sidiary and Cuba, is in the process of passing 
legislation guaranteeing Canadian control over 
multinational corporations operating there. 
Colombia recently has joined the growing list 
of hemispheric countries doing business with Havana. 
The government has stated that subsidiaries of 
multinational corporations will be "allowed" to 
participate in this trade.

NOTES 
Iraq and the USSR reportedly concluded a major 
arms agreement late last year. 
The new arms package, which appears to have 
grown out of Soviet Chief of Staff Kulikov's trip 
to Iraq last November, is the latest sign that Mos-
cow and Baghdad have set aside their differences, 
at least for now. The USSR is to provide Iraq with 
additional Scud surface-to-surface missiles, a 
MIG-23 squadron, two MIG-17 squadrons, and some 
MI-8 helicopters. 
Ecuador's plan to buy $91 million in arms from 
France wills when executed, be the largest single 
purchase of ground force equipment by any Latin 
American country. 
A letter of intent signed last month provides 
for the purchase of 72 AMX-13 tanks, 12 armored 
personnel carriers, at least 68 other armored sup-
port vehicles, and 12 155-mm. self-propelled how-
itzers; $26 million in ammunition is included. An 
Ecuadorean army delegation is looking over other 
West European artillery and surface-to-air missiles 
and is to go to Israel in February to examine towed 
howitzers made there.
