 use.
 Deng Xiaoping has made important progress over the past year in his long
 effort to reform the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Judging from his
 speeches and actions, we believe Deng has pursued three broad goals for
 changing the military:
 ? Depoliticization. Weakening the military presence in top policymaking
 bodies, sharply reducing the importance of ideology within the military.
 ? Professionalization. Upgrading the equipment, training, and educational
 standards of the Army; rejuvenating its leadership; relieving the military
 of responsibilities other than national defense.
 ? Cost cutting. Reducing the military's share of the budget, cutting the
 Army's size, turning some defense production facilities over to civilian
 In a series of personnel and organizational moves, beginning last spring and
 culminating in the September Conference of Party Delegates, Deng and his
 allies:
 ? Retired nine Politburo members associated with the military.
 ? Reduced military representation on the Central Committee to a historic
 low of 16 percent.
 ? Replaced all but one of the deputy chiefs of the PLA's three General
 Departments with younger officers cast in Deng's reform mold.
 ? Announced a 1-million-man reduction in China's armed forces.
 ? Cut the number of military regions (area commands usually comprising
 several provinces) from 11 to seven, and appointed several new
 commanders.
 ? Announced minimum educational standards for promotion and
 established a National Defense University to train general officers
 an honest broker have been key elements in his success.
 In particular, Deng largely has succeeded in ridding the Army of leaders
 who advanced during the Cultural Revolution and has forced the Army to
 admit its "mistakes" during that period. On the basis of Chinese press
 reporting, we believe the campaign of reeducation and the leadership purge
 in the military are beginning to make some headway, reducing factional
 tensions and promoting greater acceptance of Deng's reform goals.
 Reforms also continued to relieve the PLA of nondefense responsibilities.
 In our judgment, Deng's high standing with the military and reputation as

 Despite Deng's achievements, some problems remain. The most serious
 relates to succession in the PLA. Deng has had difficulty identifying
 younger men of sufficient prestige and competence to assume the top PLA
 leadership posts, such as Military Commission Chairman, Defense Minis-
 ter, and Chief of the General Staff. As a result, the Army's High
 Command is still in the hands of septuagenarians. We believe Deng intends
 to relinquish his position as Military Commission Chairman-probably to
 General Secretary Hu Yaobang-but, for reasons that are unclear, has not
 been able to do so. Scattered and inconclusive evidence points to high-level
 political infighting as the main cause of the problem, but we cannot
 identify with any certainty the specific players or issues involved. We
 suspect the Military Commission problem has held up appointments to
 other senior PLA leadership positions; these appointments are also affected
 by disputes among senior leaders, who have not been able to reconcile their
 individual preferences for successors. Deng needs to resolve the succession
 problem soon, particularly in the Military Commission, to safeguard the
 reforms and forestall infighting after his death.
 Deng has successfully distanced the Army from party decisionmaking, but
 has not completely nullified its political influence. The military still plays
 an active policy role in matters concerning national defense and sometimes
 can frustrate Deng's intentions. For example, although Deng was able to
 formally establish a State Military Commission-intended to take over
 day-to-day oversight of the Army from the party commission-the two
 bodies have identical leadership, and the State Military Commission has
 never, to our knowledge, met separately. Problems with the commissions
 reflect a general problem Deng faces in all his reforms-guaranteeing
 honest implementation rather than lipservice. In general, we expect that
 the reformers' gradualist approach will yield continued results, but tensions
 between them and the military will linger
 In addition to strictly military issues, Army leaders also exert considerable
 influence over the development of science and technology, an area with
 military implications. For historical reasons, the military retains a strong
 voice in cultural and ideological policy, an area still politically sensitive in
 China. We judge military influence on China's strategic and foreign policy
 to be particularly weak, and likely to remain so. These areas are the
 jealously guarded preserve of the top party leaders.

 Secret
 Most senior military leaders have publicly supported the premise that
 economic modernization is a prerequisite to military modernization, and
 we do not anticipate a serious challenge to Deng's economic reforms from
 within the armed forces. However, the economic implications of several
 reforms raise issues Deng will need to address:
 ? Resource constraints will impede delivery of new equipment and training
 to the Army, possibly leading to disillusionment with reforms that fail to
 deliver and to pressure for a greater budget share.
 ? Interservice competition for scarce budget dollars may intensify.
 ? Demobilization and the shift to professionalism have caused some morale
 problems, which will increase as these initiatives proceed.
 We expect that the reformers will divert some national resources to deal
 with these problems when they flare up, but only enough to keep a lid on
 potential disruptions.
 Deng's structural military reforms have buttressed adjustments in China's
 strategic and foreign policies, which have important implications for the
 United States. China has publicly stated that it no longer believes war with
 the Soviets is inevitable or even imminent, but, privately, Chinese leaders
 have made it clear that they still consider the Soviet Union to be China's
 main enemy. This perception and the desire to modernize China's military
 combine to promote increasing Sino-US military cooperation, particularly
 in technology purchases and military exchanges. However, financial
 constraints and a reluctance to become dependent on foreign suppliers will
 make the Chinese cautious and selective about purchases.
 Our preliminary judgment
 reporting-is that many of the new military leaders are not necessarily in   25X1
 favor of extensive cooperation with the United States. They are less
 ideologically rigid than their predecessors, but some appear inclined to
 judge the value of bilateral military ties primarily on the basis of the speed
 and generosity with which the United States supplies China with military
 technology. This is particularly true of those officers associated with the
 defense industries. Indications are that many line officers favor increased
 contact with the United States.                                   25X1

 The organizational and political changes Deng has initiated do not affect
 China's ability to project force as much as other factors, such as the
 purchase of new weapon systems. To the extent that these changes
 contribute to a more professional, efficient, and modern Army, they will af-
 fect China's relationships with the Soviet Union, the United States, and
 other Asian nations-especially Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan. US and
 Chinese strategic interests now generally coincide. The degree to which
 they do so in the future is likely to depend more on the economic and politi-
 cal reforms than on the military ones.

 China: Forging Ahead
 With Military Reform
 Of all the reforms Deng Xiaoping has initiated in his
 eight years as leader of China, none, in our view, has
 been more difficult or proceeded more slowly than
 reform of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). In a
 1975 speech to the party's Military Commission, then
 Chief of Staff Deng attacked the Army as bloated,
 not combat worthy, factionalized, undisciplined, and
 unsupportive of party policy. Aging military leaders,
 secure in their privileges and threatened by his
 proposals, resented Deng's blunt, demanding tone and
 dragged their feet. In 1985, with the announcement of
 plans for a 1-million-man reduction in force and the
 retirement of numerous senior military leaders from
 the Central Committee at the September Conference
 of Party Delegates, Deng won important victories, but
 25X1        serious problems remain in completing the military
 reforms.'
 for political and economic reform.'
 In our view, Deng's military reform plans have three
 goals-depoliticization, professionalization, and cost
 cutting-and are closely connected to his wider plans
 Depoliticization
 Although in his public pronouncements on military
 reform Deng has always stressed upgrading pro-
 fessional standards and reducing expenditures, we
 believe his principal goal has been to ease the military
 out of policymaking. In the past, heavy PLA
 representation on the Politburo and Central
 Committee gave the Army a voice in decisions about
 all aspects of governing China (see inset). Although it
 did not act as a bloc,
 the senior PLA leadership-generally elderly,
 tradition minded, and reflexively conservative-
 viewed the reformers with suspicion, and the
 reformers saw them as a potential brake on effective
 implementation of Deng's program. Thus, the
 weakening of this political force was essential not only
 to carrying forward Deng's military reform but also
 for the sake of his broader goals. At the same time,
 Deng's speeches demonstrated his belief that the
 heavy politicization of the armed forces under Mao
 detracted from their national defense capabilities.
 Professionalization
 Compared with its potential opponents, China's Army
 is poorly educated, poorly equipped, and poorly
 trained-deficiencies that cost it heavily in the 1979
 border war with Vietnam. Until recently, it has
 operated on a 50-year-old strategic doctrine-
 People's War-that some officers have written is
 inappropriate for the military challenges China faces
 today. Deng has pressed hard to raise educational
 standards for officers and men and to improve
 discipline and morale; because he wants soldiers to be
 able to concentrate on soldiering, he is reducing the
 Army's non-combat-related responsibilities-farming,
 factory work, and the like. The PLA has developed
 new defensive strategies and is groping for a new
 strategic doctrine under the rubric of "People's War
 under modern conditions"-although many midlevel
 officers continue to rely on older People's War
 theories, such as guerrilla warfare, in discussions of
 tactics with foreign diplomats.' Deng has also set
 China on a course of selective modernization of its
 military hardware, technology, and production
 facilities.

 Secret
 Probably no army in a Communist state has been as
 closely identified with its ruling party as has the
 PLA. From the earliest years of the struggle for
 control of China, many of the party's leaders were
 also military leaders. Because the Army existed
 before the founding of the People's Republic of China,
 it has long considered itself the party's army rather
 than the state's. The close association between the
 Army and the party also contributed to the militar 's
 gaining influence over nonmilitary policy areas. 7
 This tendency reached its apex during the Cultural
 Revolution. In 1967, when the party began to lose
 control of the youthful Red Guards, the Army was
 called in to restore order. Military power at the
 center peaked when Marshal Lin Biao, Minister of
 National Defense, was designated Mao's heir
 apparent. (In 1971, Lin allegedly was killed in a plane
 crash. According to official statements, he was fleeing
 after a failed coup attempt against Mao. His death
 weakened but did not eliminate military influence at
 the top of the party hierarchy.) Military men moved
 into local governments, factories, and communes to
 take over the management of virtually all sectors of
 the society. Although they did restore a semblance of
 nonmilitary goods needed in society.
 some of their excess productive capacity to
 Reduction of Military Expenditures
 One of Deng's arguments for military reform has
 been that China's military budget has been too high,
 both as a proportion of national expenditures and in
 terms of the Army's wasteful use of resources. In his
 speeches and writings, Deng has insisted that effective
 military modernization can only be achieved by a
 healthy, modernized economy, and he therefore has
 advocated policies that strictly limit military
 expenditures. He also has called on the PLA to
 streamline its administrative, logistic, financial, and
 production procedures to eliminate redundancy,
 waste, and mismanagement. He has proposed that
 facilities once reserved for military use be shared with
 civilian enterprises, and that military factories devote
 order, their management of industry and agriculture
 frequently was inefficient and incompetent. Moreover,
 the military was often arbitrary and highhanded in
 its administration. The PLA also grew more brazen
 in its pursuit of privilege, arrogating to itself the best
 housing and such scarce resources as fuel,
 transportation facilities, and medical care. As a
 result, while the PLA grew increasingly arrogant and
 complacent, popular resentment climbed.
 The military had retreated from some of its
 administrative duties but few of its prerogatives when
 Deng assumed power in 1977 and began his drive to
 remold the PLA. Reform of the military took on
 greater urgency after the Sino- Vietnamese border war
 in 1979. The PLA, which intelligence reporting
 indicates had expected to dominate Vietnam easily,
 instead found itself in a bruising confrontation from
 which it emerged a dubious victor. The conflict
 revealed serious weaknesses in PLA equipment,
 training, organization, command and control, and
 officer competence. The Army's poor showing
 undermined PLA prestige and made its claims to
 special privilege and status difficult to justify
 Even though Deng had made slow and steady progress
 in bringing the leadership of the armed forces around
 to his points of view on military, political, and
 economic reform, 1985 was his most successful year,
 especially in depoliticization.
 Politics and Personnel:
 The Army's Orderly Withdrawal
 In our view, Deng's most notable gains have been in
 removing military leaders from policy bodies. At the
 September party conference, seven of the 10 Politburo
 members who resigned were senior soldier-politicians,
 and two of the others, although no longer active in the

 the first time with no representative-other than
 Deng-on the Politburo Standing Committee.' No
 military men were promoted to Politburo status, and
 the military retained only one representative on the
 party Secretariat. Although some new regional
 military leaders were promoted to full Central
 Committee membership, many more veteran soldiers
 resigned, and PLA representation dropped to a

 ' Although generally thought of as a civilian, Deng has long and
 close ties to the PLA. He has held a number of senior military
 posts, including chief of staff from 1975 to 1976 and again from
 1977 to 1980. He is seen by senior military leaders as someone who
 "understands" the military and is generally sympathetic. Deng's
 connections with the military began in 1926, when he became an
 instructor at the Xian Military Academy during the period of
 cooperation with the Nationalists. He organized the 7th Red Army
 in Guangxi in 1929, and in 1930 served as chief of staff of an army
 corps. He was political commissar of the army that defeated the
 Nationalist armored forces in 1949, in a period when political
 commissars took an active part in field command of their units.
 After the founding of the People's Republic, Deng held a number of
 military posts including vice chairman of the Southwest China
 Military and Administrative Council, vice chairman of the
 National Defense Council, and vice chairman-later chairman-of
 The net effect of these changes, in our judgment, is to
 diminish greatly the PLA's voice in the councils that
 decide China's overall policies. The party has always
 maintained control of the Army-even during the
 Cultural Revolution-but the party itself until now
 has had a markedly military cast. In the last several
 years, Deng has been promoting more civilian
 technocrats, thereby reducing the Army's say in
 decisionmaking outside its areas of competence.
 Although the influence of key military leaders was
 exercised through personal contacts rather than
 military status or specific posts, the simultaneous
 "retirement" of so many senior soldiers from the
 Politburo sends a clear message to both the party and
 the Army: that military influence will be reduced.
 That is not to say, however, that senior military
 leaders will have less influence over issues directly
 germane to the armed forces.
 Within the military hierarchy, retirement of the old
 soldiers has had a less visible impact. Deng has been
 careful to preserve appearances and avoid
 unnecessary loss of face for aged generals. For
 example, with the exception of the infirm Marshal Ye
 Jianying, who resigned all his posts, officers removed
 from the Central Committee who were also members
 of the party Military Commission were allowed to

 New Faces in the Leadership
 We believe Deng has also scored some success in
 rejuvenating the PLA leadership, beginning in earl,,
 1983, when he called for older military leaders to
 retire and make room for a new generation. Initially,
 progress was slow; a few batches of superannuated
 officers retired, but none of the prominent old
 generals stepped down. Real movement began in the
 spring of 1985 after Deng announced at a Military
 Commission meeting that the PLA would be reduced
 by 1 million men and the number of military regions
 would be cut from 11 to seven to increase command

 While reducing military influence, Deng
 Xiaoping has given the Army a prominent
 efficiency and facilitate the demobilization. It was
 soon disclosed that at least half of those to be
 demobilized would be officers.
 Deng used the opportunity afforded by the retirement
 of so many officers at the senior command level to
 promote numerous young, professionally competent
 officers to make up the core of the "successor
 generation" in the armed forces. Five of the current
 seven military region commanders are newly
 appointed, and have solid professional-rather than
 political-credentials. During the spring, all but one
 of the deputies of the three General Departments of
 the PLA (Staff, Political, and Logistics) were
 replaced, and new leaders were appointed in the Air
 Force and the National Defense Science, Technology,
 and Industry Commission
 Rectification-The Army Confronts Its Mistakes
 When the often-postponed rectification campaign-
 Deng's exercise in purifying the party, government,
 and Army-finally kicked off in the fall of 1983, it
 encountered especially stubborn resistance in the
 PLA. "Totally negating the Cultural Revolution," a
 shibboleth of the campaign, strongly implied criticism
 of the PLA's substantial role during that period, and
 was therefore opposed or ignored in many military
 units. Faced with this foot-dragging, Deng and his
 allies adopted an approach combining pressure,
 persuasion, and reassurance. Although reform leaders
 continued to insist publicly that the Cultural
 Revolution had almost no redeeming value and that
 the role of the Army during that period-particularly
 its supporting political factions-was incorrect, they
 also promised leniency to soldiers who admitted their
 mistakes.
 By late 1984 and early 1985, this steady pressure
 yielded results: more and more military leaders
 publicly condemned the whole Cultural Revolution
 experience and admitted their own errors. In some
 cases, PLA leaders returned to areas where they had
 been stationed during the Cultural Revolution and
 apologized to local authorities. Moreover, Deng took
 steps to diminish the factionalism within military
 units that originated in the Cultural Revolution and
 clearly diminished military effectiveness. In our view,
 the combination of retirements and transfers of
 faction leaders, plus "heart to heart talks"-
 discussions overseen by the General Political
 Department, where past and present problems within
 units were exhaustively examined-has significantly
 reduced but not eliminated the divisiveness within
 most PLA units. It is indicative of the deeply
 conservative, Maoist orientation of some segments of

 Professionalism-Progress Continues
 Deng's insistence on high professional standards
 might seem unexceptionable to Western observers,
 but it is a profound change for PLA officers. The
 educational standards, promotion criteria, strategic
 doctrine, political role, and emphasis on
 modernization that Deng has promoted run counter to
 much of what the party has said about military affairs
 during the past 30 years. The new line thus has been
 received with a mixture of enthusiasm and suspicion,
 particularly at upper levels. Building on strong
 support for modernization among younger officers,
 Deng continued to push these reforms in 1985.
 Although the PLA still falls far short of the modern
 professional standards he has set, there has been real
 progress, and the organizational reforms already
 instituted will, in our judgment, provide the basis for

 announced the founding of a National Defense

 academy. It will also foster educational and training
 exchanges with foreign counterparts, a significant
 departure from previous policy. The new university is

 Perhaps Deng's greatest success in enhancing PLA
 professionalism has been in shearing the Army of          7X1
 many of its non-defense-related responsibilities. In the  25X1
 last two years, the PLA rolls have been reduced by
 hundreds of thousands as Deng has split off
 construction, railway, and security units.' There is an
 economic payoff to this streamlining, of course, but
 most important for Deng's goals is that it focuses
 more command attention on national defense
 missions. Transferring internal security responsi-
 bilities as well as many troops to the newly created
 People's Armed Police under the Ministry of Public
 Security in June 1983 was especially significant, in
 our judgment. The transfer removed a bothersome
 and contentious area from PLA purview and provided
 convenient job opportunities for demobilized PLA
 officers and enlisted men.
 'The demobilized soldiers were, for the most part, absorbed by
 civilian entities. Some construction and railway units were
 transferred almost intact to local jurisdictions or state economic

 Changing the Role of the Political Commissar
 Deng's reforms have drastically changed the role and
 status of the political commissar in the PLA.
 Although the commissar remains responsible for the
 ideological indoctrination of his unit, that
 responsibility is far less important now that Mao
 Zedong thought has been discredited. The
 commissar's principal ideological tasks today are to
 relay decisions of the leadership, explain the intent
 and benefits of the reforms, and urge that soldiers

 However, Howe public portion of the military budget,
 which covers most PLA operating expenses, did not
 increase from 1979 to 1984, when China was
 experiencing some inflation as well as a significant
 growth in national revenue-indicating a declining
 PLA share of national income.6

 To replace his lost duties, the commissar has adopted

 As with political reform and professionalism, Deng
 has made significant progress, in our judgment,
 toward attaining his two top economic goals: holding
 down military expenditures and reducing the size of
 the military
 The Budget-Socialist Construction First
 Reformist leaders' speeches and policies have made
 clear for several years that they see China's most
 important task as modernizing and consolidating of
 the civilian economic structure, and that all other
 demands on national revenues have lesser priority.
 This has led to reduced military expenditures,
 strengthening of civilian controls over military
 industries, and diversions of military technology,
 expertise, and production facilities to civilian use.
 Accurate estimates of Chinese military expenditures
 The 1984 adjustment for inflation, which amounted to
 about 2.3 percent, according to official Chinese '
 statistics, did not offset the effects of China's inflation
 rate, according to Chinese press reports, and in 1985
 the PLA had to cut spending further. It reduced its
 planned expenditures by US $2.5 million and still had
 to draw on its reserves to the tune of US $206 million,
 according to the Hong Kong press. At an all-Army
 logistics work conference in December 1985, logistics
 chief Hong Xuezhi said that the shortage of national
 defense funds meant that the Army had to "make
 every cent count." In his speech, he ordered a
 tightening of administrative and supply procedures to
 control waste, a chronic problem in the PLA. Among
 the increased reforms he called for were
 computerization of logistic information and
 introduction of modern management methods.
 Reduction in Strength
 Although the announced plan to cut the PLA by
 1 million has significant political and profession-
 alization implications, it is also an important cost-
 cutting measure. Currently, we do not try to estimate
 Chinese military expenditures as a percentage of
 budget or GNP, but it is clear from the policies they
 have pursued that the Chinese leadership decided that

 time. New equipment in the PLA inventory suggests that the Army

 modernize and upgrade its weaponry, was simply too
 expensive. Moreover, with the USSR's increasing
 involvement in Afghanistan and with the growth of
 relations with the United States, the Chinese probably
 judged that a ground force attack against China was
 unlikely, and that their own ground forces could be
 reduced without jeopardizing their security.
 In our judgment, Deng, though he has many motives
 for the demobilization, probably concluded that the
 policy would be more palatable to the PLA if
 presented as driven by a need to economize. Chief of
 Staff Yang Dezhi summed up the official line in a
 July 1985 Xinhua interview: "If we reduce the
 number of Army men by 1 million, we will be able to
 save a great deal of expense for national defense each
 year. This will be of great benefit in concentrating our
 financial resources to carry out national construction
 and will quicken our pace in modernizing our Army."

 Details of the demobilization plan have trickled out
 only slowly.                         ost of the
 cuts will be made in main force units-as opposed to
 local forces and militia-because they are most
 dependent on the national budget. Local force units
 and militia receive a large part of their financing from
 local governments.' Half of the 1 million to be
 demobilized will be officers, and the General Logistics

 Successors at the Top
 Although the rejuvenation process has brought many
 competent and qualified officers to command
 positions at the corps and even the military region
 level, the PLA is still dominated at the very top by
 elderly veterans of China's revolutionary experience.
 Some of these leaders evidently cannot bring
 themselves to turn over their responsibilities;
 others are willing    25X1
 to step down but have been prevented by political
 factors-top leaders cannot agree on who the
 successors should be. Nowhere is this more evident
 than in the Military Commission, which Deng himself
 In our view, when Deng resigned his government posts
 in 1980, he believed that he had to keep the Military
 Commission job to ensure that his military reforms
 stayed on track. However, in the past year, he has       25X1
 spoken frequently of the need to retire from active
 supervision of affairs, and we believe he now wants to
 pass the post on.                        Hong       25X1

 flimsy military credentials and a personal style that
 many of the old soldiers find objectionable. Hu also

 military. He was prominent at the June 1985 Military

 Deng's intention to resign his chairmanship in favor of

 broaden his contacts within the military. Although he
 has been outspoken on the need for reform, he has
 also gone out of his way to demonstrate respect for
 Hu, who will be 72 next year, would be no more than
 a short-term solution at that point. In our view, the
 most likely scenario is that Hu will be given the job
 for a limited period-two years or so-though this
 may not be announced publicly. It is also possible
 that, even though he will hold the top slot, there will
 be an understanding with the Army that one of the
 vice chairmen will call most of the shots on military
 questions. To protect the reforms and prevent
 infighting after his death, Deng needs to settle a
 younger, more permanent replacement soon at the top
 of this critical body. It is possible that Hu's successor
 could be chosen and informally anointed early in Hu's
 tenure.
 The Military Commission is not the only high post for
 which Deng appears to have had difficulty identifying
 and promoting a successor. Despite Deng's success in
 rejuvenating leadership at some levels, notably the
 military region commanders and deputy general
 department directors, he has yet to move any younger
 men into the very top jobs. Minister of Defense Zhang

 One possible explanation for continued leadership by
 these aging veterans is the difficulty of finding reli-

 who are acceptable to all concerned parties.F_
 Given his own age and that of the
 men in the top military posts, Deng must press his
 search for successors. He may have to settle for men
 of less stature and ability than he would prefer, simply
 to ensure that he is able to oversee the transition.
 We believe-on the basis of public statements and
 written articles-that the majority of higher-ranking
 military officers concur with Deng on the need for
 reform. Most also agree with the trend of Deng's
 military modernization drive, although there is proba-
 bly considerable disagreement over the details of its
 implementation. There are, however, some reforms to
 which the military is distinctly lukewarm, none more
 so than Deng's commitment to transfer authority over
 the military from the party to the
 government. When Deng and other reformers under-
 took in 1982 to place day-to-day administration of the
 PLA under the genuine control of the state appara-
 tus-policy matters were still to be the party's prerog-
 ative-military and party traditionalists were able to
 prevent it. The Sixth National People's Congress in
 mid-1983 created a State Military Commission to
 oversee the armed forces, but its membership was
 identical to the party's Military Commission; to our
 knowledge, the State Military Commission has never
 held a separate meeting. In short, it was a reform in
 name only. In our estimation, Deng will continue
 working to establish an operational State Military
 Commission to further his goals of depoliticization
 and professionalization, but the longstanding special
 relationship between the party and the Army will
 most likely make progress slow.
 Especially difficult is ensuring honest implementation
 of promulgated policies. Not all opposition is political.
 According to the Chinese military press, a Liberation
 Army Daily reporter found a cadre burning sheaves of
 new regulations. When asked why, he replied that
 they were potentially troublesome and it was thought
 best to destroy them before too many people could
 read them.
 We believe residual leftism, while still present, poses a
 less serious problem. Deng has purged the Army of
 most of its high-ranking leftists, though at middle
 levels many who joined during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion remain. For the most part poorly educated,
 basically conservative, and schooled in the extreme
 "campaign" style of Cultural Revolution politics,
 many of these middle-level officers show little under-
 standing of what Deng is trying to accomplish in
 either the economic or military reforms. This is
 evidenced by the number of times in recent years
 elements in the Army have supported countercurrents
 to reform, such as the 1981 Army-sponsored attacks
 on "liberalism" in the arts, or the 1983 "spiritual
 pollution" campaign. Such episodes sustain the im-
 pression within the party that the Army as a whole is
 opposed to reforms, even though this is not the case.

 25X1    Indeed, what opposition exists is fragmented and
 parochial.                         "Some
 grumble because the new weapons are not being
 deployed fast enough, others don't want them at all;
 one group speaks of revolutionary purity, another tries
 to get into business."
 Deng has adopted a firm but nonpunitive approach to
 overcoming endemic problems in the Army. While
 refusing to retreat from his policies, he has
 concentrated on persuasion and education, making
 clear that compliance is expected but stopping short of
 penalizing soldiers for past "mistakes." Deng's tactics
 have enabled him to make steady progress, while
 avoiding a showdown with the Army. We expect the
 reformers' continued application of this approach to
 bring about gradual reduction of the importance of
 these political problems, but some tension between
 civilian reformers and their military targets will
 probably persist.
 systems they are trying to buy.
 Reluctance to Professionalize
 The shift to professionalism continues to concern the
 ranks and will require sensitive handling (see inset).
 Although the reformers have succeeded in imposing
 minimum requirements for officers, genuine
 upgrading of the educational level of China's armed
 forces will be a long struggle. Deng not only has to
 attract a new corps of educated officers, but also has
 to reeducate many of those now serving. In our view,
 China lacks the resources to educate the huge number
 of officers who have barely a primary education, or
 who joined the Army when expertise was suspect and
 the educational system was in disarray. Yu Qiuli
 admitted early this year that a considerable number
 of officers, especially at or below Army level, are of
 "poor quality." This problem exists also at higher
 levels. Foreign attaches in Beijing have concluded
 that even senior staff officers responsible for
 technology acquisition programs-such as the
 recently appointed Deputy Chief of General Staff He
 Qizong-often display little understanding of the

 A measure of the difficulty Deng faces in
 professionalization of the military is the problems he
 has had with reestablishment of ranks in the PLA.
 During the Cultural Revolution, ranks were
 abolished in the PLA as being bourgeois relics. Since
 1982, China has periodically announced that it is
 about to reintroduce rank designations. A variety of
 dates have been reported as the beginning of the new
 rank system, but implementation has always been
 postponed. The principal reason for the
 postponements, we believe, is not ideological
 resistance but economics.
 many PLA officers-especially those on the
 verge o being retired-believe they are entitled to a
 higher rank than the central authorities wish to
 assign them. Because their rank will affect their
 retirement pay and benefits, and thus the outlay
 necessary to retire them, progress has been stalled.
 The leadership is unwilling to accede but unable to
 enforce its will.
 A problem also exists among officers who are not
 scheduled for retirement. There are probably fears of
 creating a command topheavy with high-ranking
 officers who lack professional qualifications of the
 kind Deng has called for, and for whom there are not
 enough jobs                   s they believe
 they deserve.
 education can do much better outside the military.
 The new conscription law, which offers extra benefits
 to such people who join the military, probably will not
 significantly reverse this trend, in our judgment. In
 the past, China only rarely has had to resort to a
 draft, even though the law is on the books, because the
 PLA was an attractive career and the ranks could be
 filled by volunteers. If economic reforms continue to
 be successful, it is probable that there will be
 increased reliance on conscription to bring in soldiers
 better able to use and maintain more advanced
 weapon systems.

 college "equivalency" courses. However, the Chinese
 press has charged that, in fact, many of these are little
 more than ploys by units to protect their officers.
 Some officers reportedly have even resorted to faking
 credentials. The General Staff and Political
 Departments issued a joint circular last year
 25X1          attacking these practices, but we believe they lack the

 resources and will to seriousl  olice the many PLA
 schools and training units.
 the plan to cut the PLA by 1 million m
 also is meeting some resistance. Former military
 region commanders are reported to have used their
 influence to block major cuts in their regions. Our
 analysis suggests that the PLA has not been as
 successful as it claims in reducing its strength, and
 that the announced figure of 4.2 million men under
 arms may, in fact, be a target and not yet reality.
 Fierce competition over perquisites and compensation
 for those slated to be cut has complicated the
 reduction. The leadership has claimed that the
 interests of those who must leave the Army will be
 protected, but this has proved a difficult promise to
 keep. Younger officers almost always must take a pay
 cut when entering civilian life, and they also lose the
 numerous fringe benefits that PLA service bestows-
 for example, preferential housing, medical care, and
 transportation. Moreover, only a relative few can be
 placed in attractive jobs or receive training to make
 them competitive in the civilian sector. A former PLA
 doctor told a US Embassy officer that only those with
 sought-after technical skills receive much help in job
 placement; others are left to their own devices.
 The losers in the reduction may become a troublesome
 locus of dissatisfaction and resentment. Resistance to
 demobilization-which has already resulted in
 sporadic violence-could intensify. Conscription
 efforts will be hurt by the Army's inability to take
 care of its former members. Because most of the
 burden for placing veterans falls on local
 government's shoulders, complaints about the policy
 from this quarter will probably increase. In our view,
 the most likely scenario is that the reformers will be
 forced to divert some national resources to deal with
 the problem, but that they will expend only enough to
 prevent the situation from getting out of hand. For the
 next several years, as the Army goes through the
 personnel readjustment, the placement of veterans
 will continue to be a distracting but not crippling
 concern
 Competition between services and bureaucracies for
 the military dollar will also present continuing
 management problems. Feuding between the
 indigenous arms industry and senior officers who look
 to foreign purchases for quick fixes is already
 complicating some arms deals, and we believe it will
 grow. So far, the reformers have been careful to see
 that each service has benefited from the opening to
 the West, but we expect interservice rivalries to
 surface as each pursues its own modernization
 initiatives.
 After Deng Is Gone
 Deng's successes in transforming the Army have
 surpassed the expectations held by most analysts a
 few years ago. He has set the PLA, once an
 embodiment of Cultural Revolution problems, on the
 road to becoming a modern professional force. He has
 removed the military from the center stage of politics,
 and moved the Army toward civilian oversight.
 Despite considerable grumbling, no significant
 military challenge to the reforms has arisen
 Deng has undeniably been aided by circumstances,
 luck, and able assistants, but a major ingredient in his
 success has been his personality and prestige. His
 ability to combine coercion, persuasion, and bribery,
 to manipulate praise and blame, has been crucial to
 the reforms. Deng's reputation as an honest broker,
 willing to listen to grievances and objections, has
 helped keep the lid on a potentially volatile process.

 Deng is no doubt concerned that weak leader-
 ship wil dilute the ability of the Army to press
 forward with existing reforms or generate new ones,
 an important step in maintaining momentum. If Deng
 or his immediate successors cannot cultivate strong,
 supportive leadership in the military, reforms could
 boa down in formalism and lack of interest.

 Most Chinese observers credit Deng with resolving
 problems between the party and the Army-and
 therein lies the problem.
 We believe there is no younger party leader with the
 credentials to command the respect of the Army to
 the extent Deng does. None of the potential successors
 in the second or third echelons has anything ap-
 proaching Deng's experience, contacts, or unrivaled
 prestige in the PLA. We believe that to the degree he
 can make civilian chairmanship of the Military Com-

 his successors will be able to manage military affairs
 smoothly.

 cal skills to shepherd Deng's reforms are in short
 supply. There are no military counterparts to rising
 party stars like Hu Qili and Li Peng. At a recent
 conference on reforms and corruption, for example,
 party and State Council organs were represented by
 third-echelon leaders, while the only military spokes-
 The leadership problem goes deeper, however, than
 just finding a successor for Deng. Men with solid
 military skills are taking their places in the regional
 commands, but younger military men with the politi-

 Staff are having a great deal of trouble
 Spheres of Influence
 Although the Army's political influence has been
 reduced, it remains important in some areas of Chi-
 nese decisionmaking. Clearly, the leadership of the
 armed forces in the Politburo and below maintains a
 strong voice in matters directly relating to national
 defense and professional responsibilities, although
 Deng has taken care to see that those who speak for
 the PLA are in sympathy with his aims. After Deng,
 we expect the Army will continue to have a significant
 and occasionally decisive influence over defense mat-
 ters. As to the related area of strategic policy, we do
 not view the military leadership as having had much
 influence in the past, and there is no compelling
 reason to believe a post-Deng leadership will break
 the pattern of keeping foreign policy decisionmaking
 power in party hands. We consider it unlikely that the
 Army will play a decisive role in deciding the succes-
 sion. Much of the Army's past power in party affairs
 derived from the dual roles of the founding fathers as
 both military and party leaders. Today, we can identi-
 fy no military figure who has enough of a follow in to
 cross over to or influence the party leadership.-
 Judging by newspaper articles and other reporting, it
 appears that, in addition to military affairs, the PLA
 has considerable say-which we expect it to retain-
 in policymaking in at least two other areas: science

 and technology, and ideology and the arts. Military
 influence over S&T policy stems from the many
 research and production facilities still under PLA
 control, and from the obvious importance of
 technology to modernizing the military. Scattered
 evidence suggests that, despite the military's status as
 the fourth of the "four modernizations," it can still
 commandeer technology and trained personnel that it
 deems essential.
 together reform efforts like the 1-million-man
 reduction in force, less strident anti-Soviet rhetoric,
 and insistence that China needs a "generation of
 peace," we believe it is clear that the Chinese view the
 Soviet threat as having subsided and the need for
 close strategic cooperation with the United States as
 having been correspondingly reduced.
 Military concern for ideology and cultural policy is, in
 part, a residue of the extreme politicization of the
 armed forces under Mao, and, in part, a reflection of
 the fundamentally different views about motivation
 held by PLA veterans and reform economists. The
 premium placed on material incentives by economic
 reformers is at variance with the Army's necessary
 concentration on personal values, such as loyalty,
 patriotism, and courage, to motivate soldiers.
 Moreover, the military-particularly for its role in the
 Cultural Revolution-has been the target of
 "liberals" in the arts, and, as a result, has led efforts
 to curb artistic freedoms. Judging by his published
 comments, Deng appears to share these conservative
 concerns, and, in our judgment, probably also sees
 cultural policy as an area where he can make
 concessions to military sensibilities at relatively little
 cost to his core reform program.
 Military reform and modernization in China are of
 great strategic significance to the United States.
 Much of what Deng has tried to accomplish in
 military reform stems from the leadership's
 perception that sufficient strategic equilibrium
 between the United States and the Soviet Union has
 been restored since 1980 that China can afford to
 divert resources away from a military buildup to more
 pressing economic development needs. The reforms
 themselves-depoliticization, professionalization, and
 readjustment of military spending priorities-are
 directed at transforming the PLA from a huge,
 backward, and inefficient wartime Army to a
 "peacetime Army capable of rapidly mobilizing for
 war," as National Defense University Political
 Commissar Li Desheng recently put it. Adding
 There is little doubt, however, that the Chinese
 consider the USSR the principal long-term threat to
 China's security, and that they are directing their
 modernization efforts at countering that threat
 militarily. Military and civilian decisionmakers are
 aware that this drive for a leaner, better-equipped,
 and more professional military will require foreign
 technology, hardware, and organizational expertise.
 We believe, therefore, that China's military reform
 program favors continued growth in Sino-US
 cooperation, both in technology purchase and in
 military academic and training exchanges.
 In view of the lack of hard evidence, our preliminary
 judgment is that military reform will not necessarily
 bring into prominence military leaders more favorably
 disposed toward cooperation with the United States.
 Although some of the younger rising stars in the PLA
 appear marginally friendlier toward the United
 States, they are still clearly constrained by the
 continued dominance of the Old Guard. Judging from
 their comments to                                25X1
 any of them appear to evaluate 25X1
 bilateral military relations mainly on the basis of US
 willingness to provide sensitive technology on
 concessionary terms. We believe there is a difference
 of opinion within the PLA on relations with the
 United States, with officers associated with defense
 industries most inclined to take a hard line on
 technology transfer issues, while line officers and
 some of the best educated military technocrats are
 more interested in across-the-board improvement in
 Sino-US cooperation.
 China's financial constraints and longstanding
 reluctance to become dependent on outside sources
 will continue to slow progress on the issue of US arms

 sales to China. The Chinese will probably push to buy
 selected technologies rather than systems, and will
 continue to seek alternative suppliers and bargain
 hard for favorable prices and terms.
 Structural and political reform of the PLA will not
 have as direct an impact on China's ability to project
 its power, or on the war-fighting capabilities of its
 armed forces, as variables such as weapon systems,
 which are beyond the scope of this paper. To the
 degree that the processes Deng has put in motion
 succeed, however, they will create a more formidable
 military machine and are a concern to China's
 neighbors, including Vietnam and the Soviet Union,
 Japan and Taiwan." Some ASEAN nations have
 expressed concern to US diplomats about China's
 military modernization and the US role in it, and
 these concerns will probably grow as the tangible
 results of Deng's programs become more evident. In
 general, US and Chinese strategic interests now
 coincide. The degree to which they will in the future is
 likely to depend more on the success of the political
 and economic reforms under way than on the military
 ones.
