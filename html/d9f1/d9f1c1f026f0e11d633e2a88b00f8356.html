 First Lesson > What is the Chinese Communist Party??
 The Chinese Communist Party is a political party of the Chinese proletarians.  Its f-  a1
 final aim is to accomplish pr,sltatrian revolution and to establish a communistic
 society, Wet-t is proletarian?:  Proletarian is laborers$ class.  Because laborers.
 do not own land, houses, nor working tools, they are forced to work for the capitalists
 and are thereby oppressed by them.  They are people without any properties.  The
 Communist Party is organized by the most intelligent and-nooially-consdtous group,
 of persons among the laborers,   The Chinese Communist P rty was-,founded in 1911..
 It has twenty four years of history to date?  This party has gone through thee.
 great revolutionary movements during these twenty four years, namely: Peifa ( b     )
 (the Northern Expeditionary), land revolution, and war against Japan`
 Second Lesson ..What does the Communist Party do?
 The Chinese Communist Party is the most revalutionary party working for the
 Chinese revolution.  Whom are we, working for?  There are two big enemies to
 Chinese laborers and industrial workers,  The first one is the foreign devils
 who are taking advantage of us and drinking our blood in China.  The second one
 is the feudal influence] that is, the landlords' oppressing poor people by
 heavy land taxation and usury,  razti-imperialism and anti-feudalism are of major
 importance in the Chinese revolution.  After the Manchuriac mncident of 1931, Japan
 wanted to monopolize China,  The  Chinese people united together to fight the Japan.
 ese,  At that time, the essential duty of the Chinese Communist Party was to save
 the nation by fighting Japan..  After the war, we are going to establish a republic
 of new democratic doctrines. In this republic, everyone will be equals will have
 the right of speech, will have enough to eat and enough to wear.  Then and only
 then, will China be completely independent, bearing no insult of any foreif devils,
 Everyone is to be well off.  Each. member of the Chinese Communist Party should
 struggle for the establishment of this free, fortunate, and indepdndent republic
 without-any fear of sacrifice.
 Third Lesson  ? Communist Leader MAO Tse-tung

 province.  He is 5,, years of age, and was one of the promoters of the Chinese
 Communist Party,  The party, under his leadership, has emerged victoriously through
 its struggle*,  After the war against the Japanese stazt%under his direction
 the Eighth-Route Army and New Fourth Army, consisting of hundreds of thousands of
 troops., were founded?  Numerous strongholds in north and central China were esta-
 blished, great; numbers of new members were gained, and all united to fight the
 Japanese for over six years,,  At ;present, the Chinese Communist Party is a big
 national Bolshevik party with political power and an armyl  Comrade MAO is not
 only the leader. of the Chinese Communist Partyi he is also a well-known politio&in
 of the world.  Even our enemy, the Japanese, have recognized his capabilities,
 Fourth Lesson - What kind of persons are eligible to join the Party?
 Since the Party is of the workers'6 class, we should attract workers and the best
 members of employed farmers `to jo'Ln.our party,  Progressive members of other classes,,
 such as farmers (rich farmers excluded), workers of small hand industries, and office
 staffs,  Educated people may be asked to join the party if they are decisive and
 braves would struggle to the end andssprifioe everything for the benefit of the
 workers, and will follow the rules of the party*  On this sbbjeot Comrade Ldnin
 said, "All those who recognize our platform, pay their party fees, and join in one
 of our factional organizations can be a,?member of our party?"
 Fifth Lesson -Capitalists, merchants, landlords, and rich farmers are not allowed

 of the Communist Party, but they will try to get in for their own benefit.  'Under
 certain conditions they may sneak into the party.  To keep the party clear, we
 will not'ask them to join the party.  However, in some oases we may make exceptions.
 For instance, there is a rich farmer who is a small capitalist.  He realizes all,,
 and wants\to abandon the benefits of his class to attend the revolution.  He bra tt
 very sincere, and produces definite results after a long period of observation,
 He may then be admitted to the party.  Such a man is very rare.  In most cases'O
 landlords and rich farmers who wish to join the party are opportunists.  Therefore
 we do not allow those people to join in the party.  Rascals and hoboes who do not
 turn over a new leaf will betab eds)ted to join.  These type of people shake very
 easily and are not reliable?
 Sixth Lesson -.The motive for  joining the party&
 The motive of Communist members in joining the party should be to stfuggle to the
 end, with out any fear of sacrifice, for the benefits of the proletarians,,  Only
 this motive is right.  But wse  often discover that the motive of getting in the
 party of some members is not this, especially in areas behind the enemy.  It is
 because the Communist Party is not in power behind the enemy?  Therefore some
 opportunists get in.  They join. in the party not for revolution? but for promotion
 and money, for relying on our power, or to pay less taxes..  These opportunists gel
 eventually be discovered and kicked out.  There are some people Yho have strong
 national feeling"  They join the party merely because it fights the Japanese.  They
 do. not know that there are still greater aims in our party#  These people should
 be educated,
 Seventh Lesson - How to introduce new members to the Party.

 procedures when introducing new members.  When introducing new members to join
 the party, those who introduce them must fill an introducing list and report all
 information on new members to the chief of the "small group" and "small group
 meeting".  If agreed by "the small group" and branch department, new members are
 required to fill a document 66r joining the party,  After the discussion and approval
 by the branch department, new members will be allowed to get in by the sanction of
 the metropolitan commissioner or zonal commissioner corresponding to the metropolitan
 commissioner*

 members in organizations not connected with our party must be introduced to two
 regular members,,
 ce  High-ranking staff members in all classes of organizations must be introduced by
 three regular members,
 d,  These formerly belonging to other, arties must be introduced by three members
 who have,been in our party more than two years.  If he is only a general member in
 another party, he should be s==Md1mv9A,-;by the provincial commissioner (or zonal
 commissioner).  If he is in charge of another parky,c he should be san$ttmndd'
 by the central committee of our party?
 Ninth Lesson - Other matters to be attended to when reeommeHding new members.
 a,  Candidate members cannot introduce new members,  If candidate members desire to
 introduce new members,, they must ask regular members to recommend the new: members,

 like idolatrous religious rites.

 nt read any secret documents of the party, do not take leadership in party pork, have
 only the right of speech, but no right of decision, no electoral right in branch
 department meetings and small group meetings, cannot introduce new members themselves
 (they must transmit newmembers to regular members for introduction; but they share
 the same responsiblities as regular members),
 Thirteenth Lesson-- How is the length of the '"waiting period" determined)
 Workers and employed farmers do not have to go through the candidate waiting period.
 That is because their thoughts, ideas, and actions are similar to'that of the
 Communist Party; therefore they can be regular members without the candidate waiting
 period*

 Eighteenth Lesson   How to become a model member (5).
 Communist Party members; are the pioneers of workers class.  Labot is the original
 character of workers class?  aaly those of the pppressive class and rascal proletarians
 do not work.  But there are some members who were very good and laborious people,
 yet they do not work any more after joining the party because they think that they
 have participated in the revoluatione  This conception Of not working any more after
 one becomes a member of the party is absolutely wrong.       Nowadays, we participate in
 producttiton not only for ourselves but also for the nation and the party.  If no
 member of the party works, the Japanese need not fight.      We would die of starvation,
 Nineteenth Lesson - The basic nit (1)
 As the branch department is the basic organization which maintains contact directly
 with the people, all the policies and doctrines of the party must be known to the
 branch departments.  The party must rely on branch departments to proceed continua
 ously with the tasks of propaganda and organization among the people,  blanch
 departments can unite and lead the. people to protect the policies and doctrines
 of the party and fight for the revolution.
 As branch departments are the cell of uniting people and organizing them and the
 fortress of fighting, the party must rely on them to attract and educate new
 members, to distribute propaganda printings, to educate thepp*pple, to guide the
 workers of the party and people, and to organize the power of the party,  Therefore&
 the branch department is the basic unit of the party.
 Twentieth Lesson ? The basic unit (2).
 Generally speaking, branch departments should be organized in accordance with
 productive units or administrations, such as plants, railromjs$, steamships, military
 camps, shops, schools, governmental offices and villages.  Those members who do not
 belong to any of these units should be organized according to the regions where they
 are living.  This is to make branch departments the center of leading productive
 masses and the fortress of productive units,
 Branch departments, organi~ed according only to regions where members are living ~-
 but not according to productive units as in the Social Democratic Party (  jC1'f,J

 are not able to lead proletarians to fight.  They are only tools in the
 competition for political votes.
 Drench departments in plants and factories are the fortresses of workers.  Since
 our party is the pioneer party of workers, we must first establish branch depart-
 ments in plants and factories.
 Branch departments in villages must be organised in accordance with the village
 political standpoint,
 Branch departments in the army (Eighth Route Army, New Fourth Army and Partisans)
 should be organized with the company (        ) as the unit.  This is to make our
 branch departments as fortresses of our party in these armies,
 Twenty-First Lesson - The basic unit (3)
 Wheneser there are more than three members in a productive unit, a branch department
 may be organi ed.  Under a large branch  department, small groups may be established
 according to  he differences of work or region..  If there are only one or two members
 in a unit,, these members may be annexed to the nearest branch department,,  In a
 city, to concentrate the people to fight, branch departments may be organized with
 streets and roads as units,  when organization is primarily developed in the villages
 it is not suitable to establish a complete branch department with less than ten
 members.  It is better to establish small groups of branch departments and elect a
 member as the chief of this small group and a secretary,  When there are more members
 elect a secretary and a vieewseeretary of the branch department.  After a length of
 time, when members increase and the work develops, then a complete branch department
 ky be organized, with the following five off ioer&&  secretary, propaganda, seganieatio
 zation, political, and military affairs,
