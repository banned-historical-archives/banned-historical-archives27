 //In a conversation with Ambassador Toon on
 Monday, Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Korniyenko refused
 to discuss reducing the Soviet and Cuban presence in Ethiopia
 or stationing UN observers in the Ogaden.  Korniyenko's unyield-
 ing comments were the most authoritative defense in recent
 weeks of Soviet policy on the Ethiopian-Somali conflict.//
 //Korniyenko, whose demeanor was described as
 "tough" and "brusque" by the Ambassador, argued that any dis-
 cussion of the Cuban presence in Ethiopia or of a UN presence
 there would have to be with the parties directly involved. He
 implied that a US request for a reduction of Soviet and Cuban
 forces in Ethiopia was improper and rhetorically asked what
 the US response would be to a Soviet demand that the US reduce
 its personnel in Iran.//
 //The official also accused the US of distorting
 the USSR's position in leaks to Western media, particularly the
 notion that Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin had "reacted positively"
 to the idea of reducing the Soviet and Cuban presence in Ethi-
 opia. Korniyenko said this is not a matter for Soviet-US dis-
 cussion and implied that there would be no reduction in force
 levels as long as Somalia refuses to renounce its claim to the
 Ogaden.
 //South African Leaders seem to be weighing do-
 mestic political considerations and what they believe are changes
 in US attitudes about current developments in Africa before
 deciding whether to proceed unilaterally with a program for
 Namibian independence. The US Embassy in Cape Town estimates
 the odds as Less than even that South Africa will accept the
 Western .settlement proposal as it is now drafted.//
 //Recent informal discussions between South Afri-
 can diplomats and Western envoys indicate that South Africa
 is determined to maintain a military presence strong enough
 to cope either with truce violations by the South-West Africa
 People's Organization or with actions by the proposed UN peace-
 keeping force that the South Africans judge to be contrary to

 their interests. The South Africans are adamant that their
 residual force remain until an independent government is es-
 tablished, instead of leaving shortly after an election as the
 Western plan prescribes. They have shown some flexibility, how-
 ever, on other parts of the complex proposal.//
 //Foreign Minister Roelof B th
 that, if a settlement is achieved, his leadingproleninytheplong,
 hard bargaining will put him in line for eventual top leadership
 in South Africa. As a newcomer to the cabinet, however, Botha
 must solicit backing for a settlement not only from Prime Minis-
 ter Vorster but also from several veteran cabinet ministers who
 have far greater influence than Botha does in the ruling National
 Party. The strongest of these are Minister of Defense Pieter
 Botha and Minister of Information and Plural Relations Mulder.
 Mulder, regarded as the most likely successor to Vorster, is
 among the more conservative members of the cabinet.//
 //The Minister of Defense n
 d
 b
 o
 ou
 t will insist
 that the settlement terms preserve South Africa's capability
 for effective military action in Namibia until there is a re-
 liable new government. The conservatives in the cabinet and in
 Parliament are very likely to be sympathetic to appeals from
 white hard-liners in Namibia, who advocate breaking off settle-
 ment talks and proceeding with a unilateral program that gives
 priority to white interests in the territory.//
 //The Embassy reports that South Af
 i
 r
 cans also are
 speculating whether recent developments in the Horn of Africa
 and Rhodesia may modify Western policy toward Namibia.//
 //Many South Africans believe that the US is
 a opting a tougher policy toward Soviet and Cuban involvement
 in Africa, but they draw various inferences. Some South Afri-
 cans apparently think the US and other Western sponsors of the
 Namibian settlement talks may now tolerate a South African uni-
 lateral solution in Namibia. Others believe that heightened
 Western wariness of the Communist threat may make it safer for
 South Africa to accept the Western settlement package, arguing
 .that the West can now be trusted not to condone truce violations
 by SWAPO.//

 CHAD:   Situation Report

 continue,     however,  and there are rumors of coup plotting against
 President MaZZoum.

 The primary mission of the French force at Abeche is to protect

 nothing of significance. Peace negotiations between Chad, Libya,
 and the rebels will begin next Tuesday, but there is no assurance

 Libya last month and assert that they are not bound by the de-

 WEST GERMANY: Labor Problems
 West Germany's labor problems worsened Zast weekend
 wit   the breakdown of talks aimed at averting a strike today
 by metal workers in Baden-Wuerttemberg.  Union officials rejected
 management's offer of a pay raise of just over 4 percent and
 decided to strike for 8 percent. The strike is certain to heighten
 the already growing concern within the government over the pos-
 ible negative impact of labor unrest on the economy and, in
 the longer run, on the unity of the governing coalition.
 The metal workers' unions in the northern states of
 Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rhine - Westphalia last week over-
 whelmingly authorized their leaders to call a strike follow-
 ing unsuccessful attempts to narrow the gap between the unions'
 demand and management's original offer. No strike date has been
 set for North Rhine - Westphalia, but the metal workers there
 will probably follow the lead of the unions in Baden-Wuerttem-
 berg. Management in North Rhine - Westphalia is considering
 lockouts of employees even if there is no formal strike.
 I            Metal workers in Baden-Wuerttemberg would like to
 win a wage hike above the government's suggested 5 percent,
 a settlement that could then be used as a model for other re-
 gions. Management, however, seems reluctant to offer more than
 4 percent. Both management and the union rejected a compromise
 proposal of 4.8 percent late last month.
 I            Elsewhere, labor and management in the newspaper in-
 dustry have been sparring with spot strikes and lockouts in
 major West German cities for about two weeks. Newspaper pub-
 lishers have vowed to lock out workers in about 230 of the
 country's 250 dailies today unless the printers return to work
 in several large cities. Negotiations will resume or open with
 workers in public services, the construction industry, and
 private banking--all of whom are demanding wage increases in
 excess of 5 percent.
 The government is continuing its hands-off ap-
 proach, but there are indications that the prolonged labor un-
 rest is causing concern. An official of the Economics Ministry
 told the US Embassy that he was worried about the possible im-
 pact of excessive wage settlements on the economy. A strike in
 the steel and metal industry, he said, would almost certainly

 result in a wage increase exceeding the government's informal
 guideline. This could slow investment and jeopardize government
 hopes that present fiscal programs would be sufficient to at-
 tain the 3.5-percent growth target set for this year.  0      25X1
 SPAIN-UK: Gibraltar Talks
 //Another round of Spanish-British talks on Gi-
 ra tar is scheduled to get under way today in Paris. No quick
 solution is likely on the basic problem of sovereignty, but
 some progress toward easing tension over the issue seems possi-
 ble.//
 Neither Spain nor the UK expects the im asse t  b
 k,                  %J
 resolved soon. The authorities in Gibraltar refuse
 to open e
 substantive negotiations on sovereignty until the Spanish
 blockade, imposed by General Franco in 1969, is lifted. Spain,
 under intense domestic pressure, believes it cannot lift
 the blockade until negotiations have shown significant progress.
 Spain, according to Foreign Minister Oreja   is w411-
 11
 ing to offer Gibraltar enhanced autonomy,  including i
 ts own
 administration, courts, and public order force; Madrid would
 be responsible only for foreign and defense policy. The people
 of Gibraltar overwhelmingly favor remaining British, but it is
 clear that Gibraltar's colonial status cannot be maintained in-
 definitely. British officials, moreover, have ruled out full
 integration with Britain.
 The first round of the current talks took
 lace l
 t
 p
 as
 November. Although it accomplished little of substance, it did
 seem to improve the atmosphere. Subsequently, Spain extended
 indefinitely the customary Christmas opening of telephone com-
 munications with Gibraltar. More significant for the long run,
 the Spanish seem to have been making a greater effort since No-
 vember to understand Gibraltar's point of view. Representatives
 of Spain's principal political parties have visited Gibraltar,
 and a correspondent of the official Spanish news agency has
 been posted there.
 These contacts appear to have fostered

 tary matters than his predecessors. He has no apparent strong
 ties to Teng or to Party Chairman Hua Kuo-feng, the principal
 contenders for power, nor does he appear to have an independent
 power base in the People's Liberation Army. He is professionally
 competent, however, and as one of China's "old marshals" is
 widely respected within the armed forces.//
 //The issue is charged with emotion, and the Spanish,
 British, and Gibraltarian Governments all will have serious
 trouble with domestic lobbies in justifying any concessions.
 Nonetheless, if the Gibraltarians now respond to the Spanish
 concession on telephone links by satisfying Madrid that there
 is some movement on their part toward meeting Spanish goals,
 Spain is likely to reciprocate, perhaps by reopening ferr
 service from Algeciras to Gibraltar.//                                       25X1
 CHINA: New Defense Minister
 //The selection of Chinese Politburo member Hsu
 Hsiang-chien as defense minister at the National People's
 Congress last week is probably only a temporary solution to
 the political infighting over the defense portfolio. Hsu is
 76 years old and in poor health, and the circumstances of his
 selection suggest that he was a compromise candidate chosen
 for his political neutrality. The Chinese leadership apparently
 could not agree on a stronger personality to replace Party Vice
 Chairman Yeh Chien-ying, who became the de facto head of state.//
 //Before the congress, there were numerous reports
 that Canton Military Region Commander Hsu Shih-yu, thought to
 be an ally of Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping, would replace Yeh
 as defense minister. Chen Hsi-lien, commander of the Peking
 Military Region and an opponent of Teng's, was also a candidate
 for the job. A stalemate may have developed between pro- and
 anti-Teng forces on the Politburo over who should receive the
 defense portfolio, and Hsu Hsiang-chien probably was selected
 to break the deadlock.//
 //Hsu will probably have less influence on mili-

 //The defense minister is usually the de facto
 a rman o       the Military Commission, the party body that over-
 sees the armed forces, but there is no indication that Hsu has
 yet replaced Yeh in this critical post. At least two other
 members of the Military Commission, Teng and former Chief of
 Staff Lo Jui-ching, seem to have greater influence than Hsu.//
 //China's military establishment is re      bl
 as
 ona  y
 stable
 politically, but it faces several important questions
 that require effective leadership. The trend of military dis-
 engagement from civilian political activity is continuing.//
 //The issues of military modernization and wa
 r
 preparedness could cause considerable controversy, especially
 over budgetary allocations. The recently adopted program of
 screening and "purifying" the military leadership has already
 resulted in some shuffling and restructuring of command groups,
 mostly at middle levels, and instability could result if it is
 not carried out carefully.//
 //Hsu has consistently advocated "professionalism"
 and de-politicization of the armed forces, but his positions on
 these important military issues are not entirely clear. Hsu
 appears to rank behind Yeh, Teng, and Lo Jui-ching in the
 military hierarchy and can be expected to follow their lead
 i
 n carrying out these and other policies.
