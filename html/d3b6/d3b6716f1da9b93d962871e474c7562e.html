 Adopted at the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged)
 of the Seventh Central Committee of the
 Communist Party of China
 (These decisions were adopted on October 11, 1955, in the light
 of Comrade Mao Tse-tung's report "The Question of Agricul.
 tural Co-operation" delivered at a meeting of secretaries of
 provincial, municipal and autonomous region committees of the
 Communist Party of China on July 31, 1955)
 At the present moment, a profound movement of
 socialist transformation is taking place in the rural
 areas.         Between the spring of 1954 and the summer
 of 1955 the number of agricultural producers' co-
 operatives rose from 100,000 to nearly 650,000.  The
 number of peasant households in the agricultural pro-
 ducers' co-operatives rose from 1,800,000 to 16,900,000.
 That is about 15 per cent of all peasant households in
 China.  The progress of the movement is, however,
 uneven. In many parts of the old liberated areas it
 has already assumed the form of a huge mass move-
 ment.                            This is because the peasants there have a
 richer  experience  of  revolutionary  struggle,  and
 mutual-aid teams (which serve as a foundation for
 co-operation) have existed there for many years. For
 instance, in provinces in North China, like Shansi, 41
 per cent of the peasant households have joined the
 co-operatives while in Hopei, 35 per cent have joined.

 Thirty-four per cent of all peasant households in the
 three northeastern provinces are in co-operatives.  In
 some hsiang,1 districts and even counties in these re-
 gions, 60, 70 or even 810 per cent of all peasant house-
 holds have joined co-operatives.  In the provinces in
 Southeast, Central-South, Southwest and Northwest
 China that were liberated later on, most hsiang already
 have their first groups of agricultural producers' co-
 operatives.  This has paved the way for a great
 expansion of the agricultural co-operative movement.
 The facts confirm the estimate of the Central
 Committee of the Party that the tide of social reform
 in the countryside-in the shape of co-operation-will
 soon sweep the entire country.  It has already reached
 some places.
 Faced with the daily growth of the agricultural
 co-operative movement, the Party's task is to lead the
 movement forward, boldly and according to plan, not
 timidly.  It must be understood that in leading the
 peasants to overthrow imperialism and feudalism, our
 Party carried out a bourgeois-democratic revolution.
 But the aim of the working class is to continue the
 advance and follow up that revolution by leading the
 peasants to embark on a socialist revolution.  In the
 earlier stage of the revolution the class struggle in the
 rural areas was chiefly a struggle between the peasants
 and the landlord class.  The peasant question which
 had to be solved then was that of land.  In this new
 stage of the revolution, however, the class struggle in
 the countryside is chiefly between the peasants on the

 one hand and rich peasants and other capitalist ele-
 ments on the other.  It is essentially a struggle over
 the choice between two roads-the development of
 socialism or of capitalism.  The question to be solved
 is a new peasant question-the problem of agricultural
 co-operation.  New relationships within the worker-
 peasant alliance and the leading role of the working
 class in this alliance must be established and strength-
 ened on the basis of concerting the development of
 socialist industrialization and agricultural co-operation.
 China's industry is growing rapidly.  Facts show
 that if the development of agricultural co-operation
 fails to keep pace with it, if the increase in grain and
 industrial crops lags behind, China's socialist in-
 dustrialization will run into great difficulties.  The
 situation has already changed fundamentally, but the
 attitude of some of our comrades to the peasant ques-
 tion still remains at the old stage.  They fail to see
 the sharp struggle over the choice between the two
 roads which is now taking place in the rural areas.
 They fail to see the active desire of the majority of
 the peasants to take the road to socialism.  They are
 satisfied .that the peasants have obtained land from
 the landlords, and want to keep things as they are in
 the villages, or contend that the speed at which agri-
 cultural co-operation develops should be very slow.
 They fail to understand that this means abandoning
 the active leadership of the Party in the movement
 for agricultural co-operation and allowing capitalism
 to develop freely in the rural areas. This would result
 in undermining the worker-peasant alliance, losing
 working-class leadership of the peasantry and so head-
 ing the cause of socialism for defeat.  Comrades with
 such misguided views are afraid to trust the masses.
 They are pessimistic about the policy on co-operation
 of the Central Committee of the Party and about the

 leadership of the local Party committees at various
 levels.  They assume that our Party can hardly con-
 solidate the several hundred thousand small co-opera-
 tives that already exist, and that any large-scale
 expansion is certainly inconceivable.  They have put
 forward a Right-opportunist policy of "drastic com-
 pression," and in some places dissolved a large number
 of co-operatives by compulsion and "orders from
 above."  Yet this pessimism is in practice shown to
 be unfounded by the growing consolidation of the
 several hundred thousand co-operatives which already
 exist, the increased output of the great majority of
 them, and the active desire of the peasant masses to
 join them.  The bankruptcy of this Right opportunism
 is thus exposed and shown up for what it really is-a
 reflection of the demand of the bourgeoisie and the
 spontaneous growth of forces towards capitalism in
 the rural areas.  The Sixth Plenary Session holds
 that the criticism made by the Political Bureau of
 the Central Committee against Right opportunism is
 absolutely correct and necessary.  We can bring about
 a fundamental change in the Party's rural work and
 alter the situation in which leadership lags behind the
 mass movement only when this Right opportunism is
 thoroughly criticized and repudiated.  This change is
 vital if progress in the agricultural co-operative move-
 ment is to continue till complete victory is won.
 It is possible to develop agricultural co-operation
 primarily because we have established in our country
 a people's democratic dictatorship headed by the work-
 ing                                     class,  and  because  this  people's  democratic
 dictatorship is now engaged in organizing our socialist

 construction.  At the same time, it is possible because
 the majority of the peasants are willing to take the
 socialist road in order to get rid of exploitation and
 poverty.  The majority here referred to are mainly
 the poor peasants who have not yet risen to a better
 economic position, the lower middle peasants among
 the new middle peasants who were formerly poor
 peasants, and the lower middle peasants among the
 old middle peasants.'  Since the land reform the
 economic condition of these sections of the peasantry
 has improved to varying extents, but many peasant
 households still have their difficulties or are still not
 well-off, while some have again lost their share of land
 because of exploitation by rich peasants or speculative
 merchants, or because they were unable to withstand
 natural calamities.  Therefore, if the Party fails to
 give the peasants active guidance along the socialist
 road, capitalism will inevitably grow in the rural areas
 and the separation of the rural population into two
 extremes will become serious.  Actual experience has
 taught the peasants that they cannot go on living as
 they used to-farming scattered, tiny plots on their
 own-that the only way out is for a large number of
 people to come together, pool their labour and work
 under collective management.   The advantages of this
 method were first shown by the numerous mutual-aid
 teams and, even more, later, by the large number
 of agricultural producers'. co-operatives which were
 established.  Agricultural producers' co-operatives can
 organize labour power rationally so that productivity
 can be raised more rapidly; they can systematically
 and effectively use land and extend the area under
 I Old middle peasants are those who were middle peasants
 before the land reform. New middle peasants are those who
 have risen to the status of middle peasants since the land
 reform.-Translator.

 cultivation; they can resist or reduce the ravages of
 nature, and, with state help, gradually introduce
 technical reforms in agriculture.  For these and other
 reasons, they are able to bring about a speedy develop-
 ment of the productive forces in agriculture and
 give the peasants substantial benefits.  That is what
 accounts for the growing popularity of agricultural
 producers' co-operatives among the peasants.
 As the past few years' experience shows, the fol-
 lowing procedure will enable the co-operative move-
 ment to develop on an even firmer foundation :
 1.  As the movement progresses, an acute strug-
 gle will be waged against the rich peasants and
 speculative merchants, and the peasants themselves
 will be educated in the midst of the struggle.  The
 mass of the middle peasants in particular must be
 educated and convinced so that they can stop vacil-
 lating between the socialist and capitalist roads.
 Therefore, the movement must be given a firm core
 -a core formed of the active elements among the
 poor peasants who have not yet been elevated to a bet-
 ter economic position and those of the lower middle
 peasants among the new middle peasants who were
 formerly poor peasants.  It should also include part
 of the active elements of the lower middle peasants
 among the old middle peasants.  The first step to be
 taken by the Party in the co-operative movement
 should be to organize these people, so that they can
 set an example and convince other peasants.
 2.  Although these sections of the peasantry-
 the poor peasants and the lower middle peasants among
 both new and old middle peasants, stand fairly close
 to each other as far as their economic condition is
 concerned, their active desire to join the co-operatives
 will for a time differ in degree for various reasons.
 Therefore, every year we should carry out work among

 them so that they will, over the next few years, or-
 ganize themselves group by group, according to the
 degree of their understanding, into new co-operatives,
 or be absorbed into existing ones.  Patience must be
 exercised towards those who, for the time being, do
 not wish to join, even if they are poor or lower middle
 peasants.  The principle of voluntariness should never
 be violated ; they should not be dragged into co-opera-
 tives against their will.  A peasant may put forward
 and withdraw his name for membership several times
 before he finally makes his mind up.  He should be
 given plenty of time to consider the matter.
 3.  Well-to-do middle  peasants  (that is,  the
 upper middle peasants among both the old and new
 middle peasants) have better farm tools and draught
 animals, their land is more intensively cultivated, its
 yield is higher, or they derive a bigger income from
 subsidiary occupations. As long as they still do not
 realize that the benefits derived from co-operative
 farming are greater than-or at least, for the time
 being, equal to-those obtained by working on their
 own, they will not readily join a co-operative.  If they
 join reluctantly, frequent conflicts are bound to arise
 among the members over the practical question of
 benefits. That is why, when a co-operative is organized,
 it is not advisable at the start to accept well-to-do
 middle peasants unless they show a genuine willing-
 ness to join, still less to drag them in against their
 will.  Efforts should be made to influence them by
 showing them the advantages of co-operative farming,
 letting them wait and see for a bit and not enrolling
 them till their understanding grows.
 4.  The middle peasants are the permanent allies
 of the working class and the poor peasants.  Good
 relations should be maintained with them both inside
 and outside the co-operatives.  Their interests should

 never be infringed nor their property taken from them.
 The backward ideas of the middle peasants, particular-
 ly the tendency towards capitalism of the well-to-do
 middle peasants, should be properly countered by
 convincing argument, not dealt with by arbitrary
 administrative methods.  The purpose of criticism
 must be to achieve unity. It must never be used as a
 pretext for attacking the middle peasants.
 5.  Before setting up co-operatives it is essential
 that the masses should be mentally prepared and
 that Rightist tendencies in the Party should be
 censured and overcome. Our Party's principles, policy
 and measures on agricultural co-operation must be
 publicized, systematically and repeatedly, among the
 mass of the peasants.  And not only should the ad-
 vantages of co-operation be made known to them; they
 should also be made aware of the difficulties that may
 arise in the course of co-operation and how such
 difficulties can be overcome.
 6.  The masses should be prepared organiza-
 tionally for the formation of co-operatives.  Agricul-
 tural producers' mutual-aid teams must be promoted
 on a really widespread scale; wherever possible they
 should be combined into joint teams so as to lay the
 groundwork for turning them into co-operatives. Joint
 committees of mutual-aid teams and co-operatives may
 be established in villages where there are mutual-aid
 teams and co-operatives.  These should hold regular
 meetings, to which representatives of individual peas-
 ants should be invited so that experience can be ex-
 changed and arrangements made for whatever mutual
 help is needed and possible.  This will pave the way
 for the future merging of co-operatives, the gradual
 transformation of mutual-aid: teams into co-operatives
 and the drawing of individual peasants step by step
 into the co-operatives.

 7.  Short-term training of cadres for running
 co-operatives is an important preparation for the
 setting up of co-operatives. Those to be trained should
 be carefully chosen.
 The growth of the co-operative movement should
 go hand in hand with the consolidation of existing co-
 operatives. It is one-sided and wrong to pay attention
 only to consolidation and disregard expansion, to deny
 that an increase in the number of co-operatives would
 help raise their quality.  It is equally one-sided and
 wrong to pay attention only to expansion and to
 disregard consolidation, attaching importance only to
 the number of co-operatives and ignoring their quality.
 Therefore, once they are established, co-operatives
 should take steps to check over their work systematic-
 ally.  Checking over of the co-operatives should be
 carried out not just once, but twice or three times a
 year, so as to keep on improving their quality.
 L. Each co-operative, in the light of its own
 special characteristics and current practical problems,
 should draw up a policy and measures for checking.
 2.  The work of checking should be carried out
 group by group, starting with those co-operatives
 which have the most problems. The varied experience
 gained in checking over different types of co-operatives
 should be made known to help push forward the entire
 movement.
 3.  Those carrying out the work of checking
 should have a warm and helpful attitude and approach
 this work with care.  It should not be done in an over-
 simplified and arbitrary manner.  It is utterly wrong
 to decide beforehand the number of co-operatives that
 must be cut down and then forcibly dissolve them.

 It is also entirely wrong to be harsh towards
 those co-operatives which have been "spontaneously
 organized."  They should be given warm help after
 careful consideration of their cases.
 4.  In   checking  over  co-operatives,  attention
 should be focussed on production, for that is the key
 issue.  In the course of organizing production various
 problems should be unearthed and solved methodically ;
 ideological work among co-operative members should
 be intensified ; management improved ; and the Party
 policy on the co-operative movement of voluntariness
 and mutual benefit thoroughly carried out.
 5.  During such checking, attention should also
 be paid to improving the make-up of the co-operatives,
 reshuffling their leading members as need arises, and
 training of new key personnel from among the poor
 peasants.
 6.  The hsiang Party and Youth League branches
 must be relied on both for establishing co-operatives
 and checking them over.  The key to the successful
 running of co-operatives lies in the strengthening
 of the work of Party and Youth League branches.
 Therefore, the work of building and checking over
 co-operatives should be closely associated with the
 building and strengthening of the Party and Youth
 League branches in the countryside.  In carrying out
 all such work the local cadres in the rural areas should
 be the mainstay, cadres sent from above should be an
 auxiliary force.
 At the present stage agricultural producers' co-
 operatives in our country are generally of an elemen-
 tary, semi-socialist type, characterized by the pooling

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 of land and a single management.  This kind of
 co-operative is a transitional form to the fully socialist
 type.  Private ownership of land and some other
 important means of production is, in the main, or to
 a considerable extent, retained, and privately-owned
 means of production are not to be hastily turned into
 common property.  That is to say, both during the
 period of establishing and of checking over co-
 operatives, the private property of the members should
 be dealt with in a reasonable way, in line with the
 principle of mutual benefit, so as to make it easier to
 expand the co-operatives and put them on a sound
 footing.  This means that co-operatives pay a certain
 amount of compensation for the use of private land,
 draught animals and large farm tools, and reasonable
 prices for such private means of production as
 draught animals and farm tools when transferred to
 the co-operatives as common property.
 The means of production owned by members of
 co-operatives differ in number and quality.  Moreover,
 it is necessary for different co-operatives in different
 areas to take varying circumstances into account
 when they decide on how and when the means of pro-
 duction owned by members are to be hired or trans-
 ferred to the co-operatives as common property.                                       In
 view of this, suitable agreements must be reached
 between co-operative members, and chiefly between the
 poor and middle peasants, on all these questions, as
 well as on the question of subsidiary occupations.
 1.  As regards the land belonging to members of
 the co-operatives:
 a.  Methods of assessing the yield of land to be
 pooled in the co-operatives should be based on the
 quality of the land, giving due consideration to the
 economic interests of those members the yield of whose
 land is, owing to lack of means, relatively low but
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 can be raised after being pooled in the co-operative.
 Likewise, due consideration should be given to the
 value of the labour and fertilizer previously applied to
 the land by its owner on the basis of its actual yield
 for a normal year.  In this way, conflicts arising out
 of differences in the actual yield as well as in the latent
 productivity of the land can be solved amicably
 between the poor and middle peasants, and this will
 make for greater enthusiasm on the part of the mem-
 bers to raise the productivity of the land and to invest
 in it.
 b.  Different methods are used in different areas
 to decide what dividends will be paid on land pooled
 in co-operatives.  Generally speaking, the method of
 giving a fixed dividend is good for encouraging the
 members' enthusiasm for work.  The method of giving
 dividends on land and paying for labour according to
 a fixed ratio is suitable, however, in newly organized
 co-operatives or in areas where the yield tends to
 fluctuate.  In certain places some methods supple-
 mentary to these have been adopted. Whatever method
 is used, attention should be paid to the following
 points :
 The amount paid out in dividends on land should
 generally be lower than the amount paid out for labour.
 It is wrong to set the dividend on land too high. But
 at the same time consideration should be given to those
 co-operative member households which are short of
 labour power but have more land, especially those of
 the old, weak, orphaned or widowed, so that they can
 get a suitable income.  It is just as wrong to fix the
 dividend on land too low.
 The proportion of income decided on as dividend
 for land should not be arbitrarily standardized. Con-
 sideration should be given to the difference in condi-
 tions between areas which have relatively less land
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 and more people, and those which have more land and
 fewer people, as well as to the specific circumstances
 of certain areas which grow industrial crops requiring
 more field work.
 In view of the peasants' predilection for the
 private ownership of land, the amount of dividend
 which the co-operatives decide to pay on land should
 remain constant for a certain period, say two or three
 years after a co-operative is founded, and should not
 be lowered each year; still less should dividends on
 land be discontinued prematurely.
 c.  Co-operative members should be allowed to
 retain small plots of land of their own, amounting to
 about two to five per cent of the average individual
 land-holding in the village, for growing vegetables, or
 for subsidiary agricultural products and occupations.
 The produce of such plots may be kept for home use
 or sold on the market.  Some co-operatives have re-
 fused to allow their members to retain any land for
 their own use.  That is wrong.
 2.  As regards draught animals and farm tools
 belonging to members of the co-operatives :
 a.  Great care must be taken while deciding
 whether draught animals belonging to members shall
 be transferred to the co-operatives as common prop-
 erty.                                   During the first year or two after they are
 formed, and while they are still economically weak or
 lack administrative experience, the co-operatives may
 retain the private ownership and rearing of draught
 animals, and hire them on a temporary or long-term
 basis so that the co-operatives may avoid incurring
 too many debts or losing animals through improper
 feeding.  As productivity increases, the co-operatives
 may purchase the animals in such ways as circum-
 stances permit.  Those co-operatives which bought
 draught animals when they were established need not,
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 however, reverse their decision, provided that they are
 organized on a sound basis and economically fairly
 well off and that the original owners of the animals
 or other members of the co-operative raise no objection.
 In some places, there is no difficulty in getting
 fodder but the charge for the hire of draught animals
 is rather high.  In cases like this, if it is beneficial
 to the production of the co-operatives to buy the
 animals somewhat earlier and if the owners consent,
 the co-operatives can do so provided local conditions
 permit.  In other places, because of production needs
 or the local custom among the peasants of feeding their
 draught animals jointly, co-operatives may, in the
 period before the animals are purchased, adopt the
 method of individual ownership of animals and co-
 operative rearing (or co-operative rearing during busy
 seasons and private rearing during slack seasons).
 This is permissible if it is convenient for farm work
 and the draught animals can be fed properly.
 b.  Contracts for the hire or purchase of draught
 animals should be signed after the co-operatives have
 conducted thorough negotiations with members who
 own the beasts.  Reasonable fees should be fixed for
 the hire of animals depending on their condition, and
 reasonable prices and terms of payment should be
 fixed for the purchase of animals by co-operatives.
 When payment is made by instalments, a certain
 amount of interest should be paid to owners before the
 final instalment is cleared. The length of time taken to
 pay off the instalments may vary according to econom-
 ic conditions in various areas and co-operatives.  In
 general, three years is reasonable; anyhow, it should
 not be longer than five.  There are some co-operatives
 which set too low a price on draught animals and too
 long a period for payment; there are even cases where
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 no definite date is set and no interest is paid at all.
 This has led to members neglecting their animals.  It
 must be put right.
 c.  Co-operatives should make appropriate ar-
 rangements for the use of the big, medium and small
 draught animals which are hired, bought by the co-
 operatives or owned and used privately.  In order to
 breed more draught animals, special care should be
 given to pedigree beasts and the protection of young
 animals.
 d.  In dealing with large and fairly large farm
 tools owned by members, too, co-operatives can, after
 renting for a certain period, buy them over one by one.
 Co-operatives should pay a reasonable sum for the
 hire of such tools and pay by instalments if they are
 bought. There are some co-operatives which use their
 members' farm tools for prolonged periods but pay
 nothing for their hire or upkeep, and no compensation
 when they are damaged.  This must be corrected.
 3.  As regards means of production for sub-
 sidiary occupations such as groves of trees, fish-ponds,
 etc. belonging to members of the co-operatives :
 a.  A distinction should be made between those
 subsidiary occupations which are best run individually
 and those which are best run collectively.  It is un-
 suitable to bring into the co-operatives means of pro-
 duction used in subsidiary occupations which can be
 made better use of under individual management, and
 it is even more unsuitable to make them the property
 of the co-operatives.  Those which can be better used
 under collective management, which will help improve
 the economic status of all members to a greater ex-
 tent, may be gradually brought under the management
 of the co-operatives after negotiations with the owners,
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 either by hiring them or buying them on the instal-
 ment plan.
 b.  Members' small holdings of trees (including
 fruit trees, bamboos and other trees used for industrial
 purposes) may in general be left to the management
 of members themselves.  Where members own groves
 or orchards and there is need for unified planning of
 agricultural and forestry production, they may be
 brought with the owners' consent under the single
 management of the co-operative, but the private own-
 ership of them remains.                                            The method of distributing
 income from such groves and orchards must be settled
 through thorough negotiations among members.
 The question of fish-ponds owned by members may
 be dealt with according to circumstances in the same
 way as that of groves and orchards.
 In order to put their collective economy on a sound
 basis, agricultural producers' co-operatives should
 gradually build up common funds in two main forms,
 namely, a shares fund and a reserve fund.
 The shares fund is built up in the following way.
 Every member makes a contribution towards the costs
 of production covering seed, fertilizer, fodder, etc., or
 towards the cost of draught animals and tools bought
 from members.  The amount of the contribution is
 based on the amount of land pooled (or in some cases
 on an agreed ratio between the land and labour con-
 tributed, or in others, where land is plentiful and
 payment for it low, on labour only).  The share each
 should pay should be properly worked out, and should
 be within the power of the majority of members to
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 pay.  Payments to the shares fund may be made in
 cash or kind.  If the amount paid in kind is more
 than is needed, the balance should be credited to the
 member concerned as investment.  Poor peasants who
 cannot afford to contribute to the shares fund may be
 helped by state loans.
 The amount to be set aside each year as a reserve
 fund for increasing the co-operative's means of pro-
 duction must be decided according to the actual cir-
 cumstances.  Generally speaking, it is better in the
 first few years that it should not exceed five per cent
 of the total annual income from agriculture and sub-
 sidiary occupations  (gross  output less production
 costs).  Later, as output grows, this proportion can
 be suitably raised. The fund set aside for the wel-
 fare of members should, in the first few years, gen-
 erally speaking, not exceed one per cent of a co-
 operative's total annual income.  Depending on local
 conditions, the relative amounts to be set aside for
 the reserve and welfare funds may be slightly higher
 in co-operatives in areas cultivating industrial crops.
 When a member withdraws from a co-operative,
 he may take with him his share contribution but not
 any of the reserve fund or welfare fund.  There must
 be a revision of the regulations given in the "Decisions
 on the Development of Mutual Aid and Co-operation
 in Agricultural Production" issued by the Central
 Committee of the Communist Party of China in March
 1953, in as far as they specify "complete freedom for
 members to withdraw both their invested capital and
 their contributions to the reserve fund" when leaving
 the co-operatives.
 Apart from the shares fund and the reserve fund,
 members should be encouraged to invest in the co-
 operatives, which should repay capital so invested, with
 interest, at regular intervals.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Agricultural producers' co-operatives must adopt
 measures to ensure the growth of their productive
 powers and prove in practice that co-operatives are
 much superior to individual farming and mutual-aid
 teams.
 1.  They should draw up their annual production
 plans and long-term over-all production plans, make
 full use of all favourable factors in the co-operatives
 or. in the locality, unearth the key factors which make
 for increased output, and develop the latent capacity
 in agricultural production.
 a.  They should improve farming skills  and
 methods by such means as deep ploughing and inten-
 sive cultivation, planting rationally in close rows, in-
 creasing the number of crops harvested annually,
 using good seed, popularizing new farm tools and
 fighting plant diseases and pests.
 They should pay attention to learning from
 veteran farmers and absorbing all that is valuable in
 their experience; they should take energetic measures
 to teach the young men and women members to im-
 prove their farming skills.
 b.  They should undertake capital construction
 where necessary and possible, for example, building
 small water conservancy projects, terracing fields,
 improving the soil, work on conservation of soil and
 water, buying draught animals and farm tools.  They
 should use locally-produced natural fertilizer and make
 great efforts to accumulate and prepare fertilizer.
 Appropriate payment should be made to members who
 hand over their accumulated fertilizer to the co-
 operatives for public use.
 c.  They should expand the area under cultivation
 and  plant high-yield crops.  Wherever there are
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 water-ways or other water sources, the acreage of rice
 should be extended as much as possible in order to
 further increase grain output.
 d.  A diversified economy should be developed in
 accordance with local conditions and with the plans
 of the local state organs, to include agriculture, handi-
 crafts, livestock breeding, forestry, fruit growing,
 fishery and other subsidiary occupations.
 To develop the economy of hilly, well-forested
 areas where livestock breeding prevails, producers' co-
 operatives may be organized to combine agriculture,
 forestry and livestock breeding.
 2.  The valuable experience of those co-operatives
 which have successfully built up a system of fixed
 responsibility for a specified job should be publicized,
 and labour power should be rationally organized.
 Where such a system of responsibility cannot be
 practised all the year round, it may be adopted on a
 temporary or seasonal basis to prepare the ground
 for a year-round system of responsibility.
 a.  Systems should be introduced to specify the
 responsibilities of production brigades and groups and
 their individual members as regards cultivation, live-
 stock breeding and the care of farm tools.  Labour
 discipline should be tightened up.
 b.  A labour production quota (that is, a standard
 work-day) system covering both quantity and quality
 should be introduced on a piece-work basis, on the
 principle that "he who works more is paid more and
 he who works less gets less."
 c.  A regular inspection system should be in-
 troduced whereby the work of the production brigades
 and groups and their individual members can be ex-
 amined at all levels and any work that falls below
 standard improved in good time.
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 d.  A system of rewards for above-quota produc-
 tion  should  be  adopted,  tied  to  a  seasonal  or
 year-round  system  of  responsibility. Those who
 overfulfil their production plans should be rewarded
 and those who fall behind because of slackness should
 have deductions made from their pay. In the event
 of natural calamities, production quotas should be
 revised taking into account the resultant difficulties.
 Those who work hard in combatting calamities and
 exceed their revised production quotas should be re-
 warded.  Those who do little or nothing to combat
 natural calamities and so fail to reach the revised
 quotas should be penalized.
 3.  An industrious and thrifty attitude should
 be encouraged in running co-operatives.  Financial
 management and book-keeping should be improved.
 Financial work should be such as to supervise and
 ensure a growth in production and a proper distribu-
 tion of income.  Slack financial management should be
 cut out and waste and extravagance checked.
 a.  A limit should be set to all expenditure. The
 simple and convenient system of "fixing a maximum
 expenditure for each item" should be widely adopted.
 Those who economize should be rewarded, and those
 guilty of corruption or waste penalized.
 b.  Reliable book-keepers should be selected and
 a mutual-help network set up among. book-keepers of
 co-operatives to exchange experience.
 4.  Political, cultural and educational work should
 be improved to raise the level of socialist conscious-
 ness among co-operative members and develop their
 keenness and creativeness.
 a.  Our country's socialist cause and the momen-
 tous significance of agriculture in the economic life of
 the nation should be widely publicized among co-
 operative members.  The state plans for economic

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 construction, particularly the agricultural production
 plan and the plan for the purchase of agricultural prod-
 uce, should be publicized among co-operative members
 and they should be shown how to properly implement
 the policy of the state on rural work and the planned
 purchase of grain and other farm produce.
 b.  The idea of collective concern for the co-
 operative and for common property should be instilled
 in members, and efforts should be made to gradually
 overcome individualist tendencies.  Behaviour detri-
 mental to labour discipline should be checked.
 c.  Unity and mutual help should be promoted
 among production brigades and groups and individual
 members, and emulation in labour introduced.  Un-
 remitting research into and improvement of farming
 technique should be fostered.  Care should be taken
 to bring the energies of the women and the younger
 members of the co-operatives into full play.
 d.  Democracy should be promoted within the co-
 operatives and members encouraged to put forward
 rationalization proposals to improve the work.
 e.  Plans should be drawn up to eliminate illiter-
 acy over a period of years and to raise the cultural
 level of members, particularly of cadres.
 f.  Co-operative members should be educated to
 raise their political vigilance so that they can wage
 an unrelenting struggle against all forms of counter-
 revolutionary sabotage.
 Financial and economic departments concerned,
 and especially  agricultural  administrative  depart-
 ments, must treat financial and technical aid for the
 agricultural co-operative movement as one of their
 most important tasks.
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 1.  Besides issuing loans to poor peasants to help
 them take up shares in agricultural producers' co-
 operatives, and thus facilitate co-operation between
 them and the middle peasants, the People's Bank and
 the Agricultural Bank should gradually increase the
 amounts loaned to agricultural producers' co-opera-
 tives for investment in capital construction, reduce
 interest rates where appropriate, and extend the
 period of repayment of loans which can be set at three
 to five years.
 2.  Departments  concerned  with  agriculture
 should set up agro-technical stations in a planned
 way and make them centres for passing on technical
 aid by the state to agricultural producers' co-operatives
 (e.g., demonstrating the use of improved types of
 farm tools, the cultivation and use of better seed,
 methods of improving farming skills and eliminating
 insects and pests).
 The work of state farms should be improved so
 that they give better assistance to the co-operatives
 and set an example to be followed.
 3.  Administrative departments concerned with
 the engineering  industry,  and  with  trade  and
 handicraft production should make reasonable reduc-
 tions in prices not only of farm tools but also of
 insecticides and insecticide spraying equipment. The
 quality of these products however must not be lowered
 when prices are reduced; on the contrary, efforts
 should be made to improve their quality.
 To keep pace with the growth of the agricultural
 co-operative movement, all departments concerned
 with the engineering industry should pay special at-
 tention to research on the design, assembly and repair
 of improved types of farm tools.  The first tractor
 plant should be completed as quickly as possible, and
 preparations begun at the earliest possible date for
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 the second and third.  They should also produce more
 machinery and equipment for water conservancy
 undertakings.  Departments  concerned  with  the
 chemical industry should increase the output of
 fertilizer.
 4.  Departments        concerned  with  agricultural
 administration should pay attention to the training of
 a large number of book-keepers and gradually send a
 sufficient number of book-keeping instructors, who can
 travel from place to place to give guidance to co-
 operative farms in improving their book-keeping and
 accounting  methods.  Book-keepers  in  district  or
 hsiang branches of the People's Bank, the Agricultural
 Bank and the supply and marketing co-operatives
 should do their best to help agricultural producers'
 co-operatives with their book-keeping and accounting.
 As the co-operative movement develops, many
 former landlords, rich peasants and counter-revolu-
 tionaries of various sorts will undoubtedly engage in
 all kinds of sabotage.  We must be alert to the serious
 danger of such sabotage in the agricultural co-
 operative movement.                                          Quite a number of landlords,
 rich peasants and counter-revolutionaries have already
 wormed their way in various guises into co-operatives.
 Some have even seized important positions in them,
 pushing their way into the leadership in an effort to
 turn them into their tools or destroy them by under-
 hand means.  They try to undermine the Party leader-
 ship in co-operatives, attack and victimize the active
 elements among the masses and the cadres of the co-
 operatives, slaughter livestock, destroy farm crops and
 even commit such crimes as arson and assassination.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Some landlords, rich peasants and counter-revolution-
 aries have even organized sham co-operatives.  It
 must therefore be laid down that:
 1.  In places where the great majority of peas-
 ants have not yet joined co-operatives, for the next
 few years landlords or rich peasants must be resolutely
 debarred from joining co-operatives.  Only in those
 places where the great majority of peasants have
 joined co-operatives and the co-operatives are on a
 sound basis can former landlords or rich peasants be
 permitted to join in different groups at different time,
 and then only on condition that they are law-abiding
 and have for a long time ceased to exploit others and
 have themselves engaged in work.  This may be done
 in order that their reform can be continued through
 collective work in production.
 2.  Landlords or rich peasants who have already
 joined the co-operatives should be dealt with in-
 dividually according to how they have behaved since
 joining. Those who have engaged in sabotage must
 be resolutely expelled. Cases of serious misdemeanour
 should be handed over to the courts.  Only those who
 work and are law-abiding may be permitted to remain
 and continue their reform in the co-operatives.
 3.  Measures appropriate to the circumstances
 must be taken to clean up and reorganize those co-
 operatives in which landlords, rich peasants or counter-
 revolutionaries have gained control of posts.
 4.  Sham co-operatives organized by lardlords,
 rich peasants  or counter-revolutionaries  must be
 dissolved.  Educational work suited to each individual
 case should be carried out among the poor and middle
 peasants who joined such co-operatives; they should
 be reorganized in a proper way.
 In various provinces there are still backward
 villages where the agrarian reform was not carried
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 out in a thorough-going way.  Such villages total
 approximately 5 per cent of all villages.  Feudal land-
 lords, rowdies, counter-revolutionaries and other bad
 elements in these places are still exploiting and op-
 pressing the peasants, either openly or in secret.  In
 such villages, it is also possible to organize the active
 and reliable elements among the poverty-stricken peas-
 ants to form co-operatives.  At the same time, it is
 essential to get the masses fully on the move as soon
 as possible, resolutely wipe out the feudal and counter-
 revolutionary forces, and so create the conditions
 necessary for  smooth  development of agricultural
 co-operation.
 To give active, planned leadership to the move-
 ment for agricultural co-operation, national, provincial
 (or autonomous region), administrative region  (or
 autonomous chott), county (or autonomous county),
 district, hsiang (or nationality hsiang) and village
 plans should be drawn up for the co-operative move-
 ment to be carried out in stages.  In making such
 plans, attention should be paid to specific differences
 which the co-operative movement shows in different
 places, as well as to similarities.
 Because different conditions obtain in different
 areas, the progress of agricultural co-operation may,
 generally speaking, differ in the following ways:
 1.  In  places  where  the  mutual-aid  and  co-
 operative movement is relatively well advanced, and
 where, by the summer of 1955, between 30 and 40 per
 cent of all peasant households had joined co-operatives,
 the movement can, generally speaking, be expanded
 by the spring of 1957 to embrace 70 or 80 per cent of

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 the peasant households.  That is to say, in such areas,
 the building of semi-socialist co-operatives can be
 basically completed by that time.  Provinces in North
 and Northeast China and a larger or smaller area in
 certain other provinces will fall into this category.
 2.  Over a large part of the country, by the sum-
 mer of 1955 approximately 10 to 20 per cent of all
 peasant households had joined co-operatives.  In such
 areas the work of building semi-socialist co-operatives
 can be basically completed before the spring of 1958.
 3.  More time is needed to build co-operatives in
 areas where the foundations of the mutual-aid move-
 ment are relatively weak and where there are still
 only very few agricultural producers' co-operatives.
 These are for the most part border areas.  There are
 some border areas where land reform has not yet been
 carried out and no mutual-aid teams or co-operatives
 have been organized at all.  In such areas, it is
 necessary to advance fairly slowly, or even wait and
 see for a long time.
 In drawing up plans for agricultural co-operation,
 the Communist Party committees in various provinces,
 municipalities and autonomous regions should select
 areas where conditions are ripe to try out the establish-
 ment of agricultural producers' co-operatives of an
 advanced (that is, entirely socialist) type.  In some
 areas where the work of building semi-socialist co-
 operatives has been basically completed, plans may be
 drawn up to transform co-operatives of an elementary
 type into co-operatives of an advanced type, bearing
 in mind the need for increased production, the degree
 of the people's political consciousness and local eco-
 nomic conditions.  Such a transformation should be
 carried out step by step-that is, by the trial establish-
 ment of a few co-operatives of an advanced type and
 a gradual, stage-by-stage increase in their number.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 In areas where many nationalities live together
 co-operatives may be formed either by people of a
 single nationality or of several different nationalities.
 In areas where livestock breeding is the only
 occupation of the people, experimental livestock breed-
 ing co-operatives may also be established if conditions
 permit.
 Plans for agricultural co-operation in the various
 areas should include such branches of the economy as
 forestry, livestock breeding, fishing, salt production
 and other  occupations.  They  should  also  include
 plans for supply and marketing co-operatives, credit
 co-operatives,  handicraft  producers' co-operatives,
 transport co-operatives, and plans for cultural and
 educational work and for the growth of the Party and
 the people's organizations.
 In drawing up plans for agricultural co-operation,
 the Party committees at all levels, and first and fore-
 most the hsiang Party branches and county Party
 committees,  should  simultaneously  work  out  all-
 embracing, long-term production plans based on local
 conditions, all with the development of agriculture as
 their central aim.
 In planning agricultural co-operation, particular
 attention should be paid to the plans for hsiang and
 villages, because such plans are the foundation of the
 whole plan of agricultural co-operation.  Party com-
 mittees at all levels should give the Party organizations
 of a number of selected hsiang or villages guidance in
 the preparation of comprehensive plans for stage-by-
 stage development in the light of local conditions. This
 will build up experience that helps to guide the whole

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 movement.  Such plans should include the following
 measures:
 1.  The making of a concrete analysis of class
 relationships in the village and the way in which
 the mutual-aid and co-operative movement is being
 organized.
 2.  The  making  of  arrangements  for  the
 establishment or expansion of mutual-aid teams and
 agricultural producers' co-operatives stage by stage
 and group by group.  This should be done on a
 voluntary basis, taking into account the degree of un-
 derstanding of various strata of the peasantry, their
 social relations and where they live and work.
 3.  The making of suitable arrangements to train
 and supply key personnel for the establishment of
 mutual-aid teams and agricultural producers'  co-
 operatives, taking into account the interests of the
 whole movement for agricultural co-operation in the
 hsiang or village.
 These plans should be carefully studied by the
 cadres and active elements among the peasants ; they
 should be repeatedly discussed with the mass of the
 people. Running things by simply issuing orders must
 be avoided and necessary revisions made from time
 to time as the work goes ahead.
 The Party organizations of provinces (or autono-
 mous regions), administrative regions (or autonomous
 chow), counties (or autonomous counties), districts
 and hsiang (or nationality hsiang) should pay close
 attention to rural questions and energetically improve
 the quality of their leadership in rural work.  The
 leading responsible comrades of local Party committees

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 at all levels should spare no pains in learning to be-
 come experts in agricultural co-operation.  In short,
 what is needed is initiative, not passivity; active
 leadership, not its relinquishment.
 Those in the leadership should base their work
 on the method of learning from the mass movement,
 familiarizing themselves with the actual situation,
 summing up  experience and adopting  a  flexible
 approach in guiding the movement. Ignorance coupled
 with unwillingness to learn, the issuing of arbitrary
 orders and an irregular tempo of work-these are
 things which violate the principles on which the growth
 of the movement must be founded in actual practice.
 They represent subjectivism, not Marxism.  There can
 be no correct leadership unless such subjectivism is
 opposed.
 The leadership should respect and encourage
 initiative and creative ability among the masses; it
 should protect and foster these growing, developing
 forces.  To impede or discourage the growth of new
 things emerging in society, instead of helping them
 wholeheartedly, or to try and force their growth
 artificially, in a rash and impetuous way, before con-
 ditions are ripe, instead of taking appropriate measures
 to foster their natural birth and development-are
 both methods which injure the tender shoots of the
 new.  They are opportunist, not Marxist methods.
 There can be no leadership unless such opportunism
 is opposed.
 The aim of the co-operative movement is to lead
 about 110 million peasant households from individual
 farming to collective farming and then go on to bring
 about technical reform in agriculture; it is to eliminate
 the last vestiges of capitalist exploitation in the rural
 areas and establish socialism.  This is a tremendous
 change affecting the livelihood of several hundred

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 million people, and it is inconceivable that difficulties
 should not crop up.  Opportunists and subjectivists
 lose the ability to exercise sober judgement and over-
 come the difficulties with which they are confronted,
 either because they do not realize that they need to
 rely on the masses and the Party, or because they
 have no confidence in them.  However, ours is a well-
 tempered, well-steeled Party, a Marxist-Leninist Party
 closely linked with the people.  Throughout the thirty
 years and more of its existence, our Party has weath-
 ered many storms in the revolution and faced many
 serious difficulties.  But its close unity with the
 masses enabled it to overcome such difficulties one by
 one and lead the people's revolution to victory.  The
 building of socialism is the cause of hundreds of
 millions of people.    In the industrialization of our
 country, in the building up of agricultural co-opera-
 tion and in every other aspect of our work, we should
 give full play to the creativeness and initiative of the
 masses, work in a realistic spirit and shun complacency
 and impetuosity.  It is the conviction of the Sixth
 Plenary Session that if we do this we shall overcome
 all difficulties and go on to new and greater victories.

 EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT
 DECISIONS ON AGRICULTURAL
 CO-OPERATION
 (A Speech Delivered on October 4, 1955 at the Sixth Plenary
 Session of the Seventh Central Committee of
 the Communist Party of China)
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung's report on agricultural
 co-operation, delivered on July 31, 1955 at the meet-
 ing                                of  secretaries  of  provincial,  municipal  and
 autonomous region committees convened by the Cen-
 tral Committee of the Communist Party of China,
 summed up many years' experience of the agricultural
 co-operative movement in our country.  It pointedly
 criticized the main ideological errors-Rightist errors
 -now existing in our Party on the question of ex-
 panding agricultural co-operation, and gave policy
 directives on a series of questions, such as the neces-
 sity and possibility of agricultural co-operation, the
 practical way forward and the steps to be taken, and
 the way to lead agricultural co-operation.  These
 directives of Comrade Mao Tse-tung have enabled all
 our Party comrades to prepare themselves ideologically
 and organizationally for the coming upsurge in the
 socialist mass movement in the countryside, and to
 avoid serious mistakes at this vital turning point in
 history.
 On the basis of Comrade Mao Tse-tung's report,
 the Political Bureau of the Central Committee has

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 prepared draft Decisions on Agricultural Co-operation
 which are now submitted to this plenary session.  As
 I am in charge of part of the work in the Rural Work
 Department of the Central Committee, the Political
 Bureau has appointed me to give explanations of the
 draft Decisions.
 I wish to draw attention to the following points:
 THE POLICY OF EXPANDING AGRICULTURAL
 CO-OPERATION
 (1)  The draft Decisions point out that the
 nature of the peasant question is different in each
 of the two stages of the revolution.  Our Party must
 adapt its policy in the rural areas to a new turn in
 the revolution and to new changes in class relations
 and in the forms of class struggle in the rural areas
 since the land reform.  Rightist mistakes made by
 some comrades arise precisely from their failure to
 see this new situation and the new changes.
 As you all know, our Party's general line in the
 period of transition has three parts: socialist in-
 dustrialization, socialist transformation of agriculture
 and handicrafts,  and  socialist  transformation  of
 capitalist industry and commerce.  These parts can-
 not be separated one from the other, because the work
 of socialist construction and socialist transformation
 covers the whole national economy.  A      socialist
 economy must include the two main branches of pro-
 duction-industry and agriculture.                                                        As Comrade Mao
 Tse-tung pointed out in his report, socialist industrial-
 ization is not something that can be carried out in
 isolation, separate from agricultural co-operation ; our

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 country must, therefore, adopt the policy of keeping
 agricultural co-operation in step with socialist in-
 dustrialization. We cannot stand with one foot planted
 on socialist industry and the other on a small-peasant
 economy.  The victory of socialism is unthinkable un-
 less we win over the five hundred million strong rural
 population to take part in socialist construction. There
 is a rising tide of socialist industrial construction; and
 in view of this, it is highly significant that Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung has in good time put the expansion of
 agricultural co-operation as an important item on the
 agenda of work for the whole Party.
 (2)  Our  Party  led  the  bourgeois-democratic
 revolution for almost thirty long years.  The work of
 every comrade in the Party centred round the struggle
 for victory in this revolution. It is quite natural,
 therefore, that some comrades are not mentally pre-
 pared  for the                             transition from this          stage  of the
 revolution to the stage of socialist revolution. But
 our Party has Comrade Mao Tse-tung at its head and
 is armed with Marxism-Leninism; even when it was
 working to overthrow the system of land ownership by
 feudal landlords, it was preparing to lead the peas-
 ants on from the point where the land was returned
 to the tillers to socialist co-operation.  Comrade Mao
 Tse-tung in his report recalled the history of the
 agricultural co-operative movement in our country;
 this is also the history of the gradual putting into
 practice of the policy of our Party on agricultural co-
 operation.
 It would be as well for us to review Comrade Mao
 Tse-tung's exposition of this Party policy in his works
 written in various periods.  As you all know, as early
 as the time of the First Revolutionary Civil War
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung, in his Report of an Investiga-
 tion into the Peasant Movement in Hunan, described

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 the co-operative movement as an important part of
 the peasant movement, though, in view of actual
 conditions at that time, mention was made only of
 supply and marketing co-operatives and credit co-
 operatives.
 During the Second Revolutionary Civil War,
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung, drawing on the experience of
 mutual-aid  working  groups  and  ploughing  teams
 created by the masses in the revolutionary bases,
 pointed out the great role played in agricultural pro-
 duction by this kind of mutual aid in labour (that is,
 co-operative organizations for agricultural produc-
 tion).                                     (See Comrade Mao Tse-tung's Survey              of
 Changkang Hsiang.)
 During the  War  of  Resistance to        Japanese
 Aggression, Comrade Mao Tse-tung gave two famous
 speeches, On Co-operation and Let Us Get Organized,
 in which he called on the people in all the anti-
 Japanese bases to organize this rudimentary form of
 mutual-aid production group in large numbers on a
 voluntary mass basis.  Later, in other works (such
 as On Coalition Government), Comrade Mao Tse-tung
 continued to draw attention to this question.  At the
 Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Com-
 mittee of the Party in 1949, speaking of economic
 construction after the liberation of the country, Com-
 rade Mao Tse-tung said:
 If we have only a state sector in the national
 economy and no co-operative sector, it is impos-
 sible to lead the individual economy of the
 labouring people gradually on to the road of col-
 lectivization ;  we cannot consolidate the pro-
 letariat's leadership in the political power of the
 state.  Anyone who ignores or underestimates
 this point will be making a grave mistake.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 After the founding of the People's Republic of
 China, the Central Committee of our Party, on the
 basis of Comrade Mao Tse-tung's views, passed the
 "Decisions  on  Mutual  Aid  and  Co-operation  in
 Agricultural Production" in December 1951, and the
 "Decisions on the Development of Agricultural Pro-
 ducers' Co-operatives" in December 1953.                                      All this
 shows that the Party has consistently adhered to the
 policy of agricultural co-operation ; this is not some-
 thing put forward all of a sudden.  Some of our com-
 rades are somewhat taken aback by this policy because
 they have not had time to study the question seriously.
 The main reason for this is that many of our comrades
 joined the Party during the bourgeois-democratic
 revolution against imperialism and feudalism, and
 are acquainted, in their day-to-day practical work,
 only with the programme of that revolution (that is,
 our Party's minimum programme) but are not yet
 familiar with the Party's programme relating to
 socialist revolution (that is, our Party's maximum
 programme).  That is why, as with many other im-
 portant new questions, we must take up the question
 of agricultural co-operation again and devote serious
 study to it; and in the course of our study we must
 realize what our mistakes are and correct them, so
 as to correctly grasp our Party's principles and policy,
 and raise our knowledge of Marxism-Leninism to a
 higher level.  That is the task confronting all Party
 comrades.
 (3)  The draft Decisions criticize the illusions
 harboured by certain comrades who are quite content
 with things as they are in the countryside, and with
 the small-peasant economy.  The Party must criticize
 such mistaken ideas.  At the Third Conference on
 Mutual Aid and Co-operative Work called by the Cen-
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 tral  Committee  in  October  1953,  Comrade  Mao
 Tse-tung had this to say :
 If positions in the countryside are not held
 by socialism, capitalism will assuredly occupy
 them.  How then can we say that we will take
 neither the socialist nor the capitalist road?
 It is an invariable law that, once the feudal land
 system is overthrown, a struggle begins in rural areas
 in which the choice lies between the capitalist and
 the socialist roads.  It is either the one or the other:
 there is no middle course.  Some comrades took quite
 a  radical  stand  in  their  attitude  towards  the
 bourgeois-democratic revolution, but once they pass
 through that stage of the revolution, they remain quite
 content with the peasants' having got back their land.
 So they loiter at the crossroads, between socialism and
 capitalism, and are actually more interested in pre-
 serving the small-peasant economy than in giving a
 lead in its transformation to a socialist agriculture.
 Such comrades fail to realize that a small-peasant
 economy is not a paradise for the peasantry, but a
 garden in which capitalism grows.  We have Lenin's
 dictum on this:
 Small production engenders capitalism and
 the bourgeoisie continuously, daily, hourly, spon-
 taneously, and on a mass scale.
 It is impossible to compromise with a small-peasant
 economy.  To entertain such an idea is mere self-
 deception.
 We can cite plenty of facts to prove that where
 the mutual-aid and co-operative movement has grown,
 the poor peasants in general have rapidly improved
 their economic condition, the tendency towards Cass
 differentiation has been slight, the grain question has
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 been easily solved and a lively spirit prevails in the
 villages.  On the other hand, where the mutual-aid
 and co-operative movement has failed to take root or
 its growth has been slight, in such places, even though
 the landlords no longer own the land, even though the
 peasants are, to a greater or lesser extent, living bet-
 ter, there are still many poor peasants whose economic
 condition has not improved, there is already the begin-
 ning of a new trend towards class differentiation, with
 some poor peasants again losing their land, some old
 middle peasants sinking to the status of poor peasants,
 and a certain number of new rich peasants emerging.
 In places like this we have run into a fair amount of
 trouble in our work, and, taking advantage of this
 backward state of affairs, landlords, rich peasants and
 all sorts of counter-revolutionary elements are at-
 tempting a come-back.
 The recent report of the Kansu Provincial Party
 Committee to the Central Committee said that some
 comrades feared there might be "disturbances" or that
 "emperors" might arise if we gave the co-operative
 movement its head.  Facts,  however,  prove that
 "emperors" do not spring up in places where the
 mutual-aid and co-operative movement has grown,
 where socialism has dug itself in and broadened out,
 where the peasants have reached a higher level of
 political consciousness fairly fast. They spring up in
 places where the level of political consciousness among
 the peasants is low, where the co-operative movement
 has not taken root, where the struggle against
 feudalism has not been properly carried out.  From
 the Kansu Provincial Party Committee's report we
 reach the conclusion that the growth of co-operation
 is the only way to guarantee the peasants the land
 they hold, to go on consolidating the worker-peasant
 alliance, to strengthen the leadership of the working

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 class in that alliance after land reform, and to make any
 counter-revolutionary come-back utterly impossible.
 (4)  There is bound to be some resistance to the
 transformation to a socialist agriculture.  It is in-
 conceivable that there should not be.  What Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung's report sets out to do is precisely to
 destroy the ideas behind this resistance.  Agricultural
 producers' co-operatives are a newly emerging force,
 and we know that any such force encounters resist-
 ance from conservative forces.  The agricultural co-
 operative movement will be no exception.
 The conservative forces are two.      On the one
 hand, there is the class enemy-the landlords, rich
 peasants and other capitalist exploiters in the country-
 side.  On the other, there is the spontaneous tendency
 towards capitalism inherent in the dual character of
 the peasants  (mainly well-to-do middle peasants)
 with all the prejudices and customs inseparable from
 prolonged individual farming.  Since such forces do
 exist in society it is natural that they are reflected
 in our Party in various forms. This is specially true
 of the sentiments of some well-to-do middle peasants.
 The recent dissolution of large numbers of co-opera-
 tives, the acts of "drastic compression," certainly
 originated in the conservative outlook of some of our
 comrades who are content with the small-peasant
 economy.  Such misguided activity, viewed as a social
 phenomenon, is not accidental, but reflects pressure
 from the bourgeoisie and the rich peasants or the well-
 to-do middle peasants who tend to move spontaneously
 in the direction of capitalism.  On the one hand, we
 have the peasant masses (and first and foremost, the
 active elements among the poor peasants and the
 lower sections of both the old and the new middle
 peasants) who have the active desire to follow the
 Party's lead and organize co-operatives.  On the other
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 hand, we have the bourgeoisie and the rich peasants
 or the well-to-do middle peasants with the spontane-
 ous tendency towards capitalism, who want to stifle
 it.  That is the contradiction that exists in our society.
 The comrades who make mistakes fail to see the
 two sides of this contradiction.  They do not realize
 that if we are to consolidate the worker-peasant
 alliance, we need, on the one hand, to give full play
 to the peasants' active desire to take the road to so-
 cialism, and, on the other, to continue to reform and
 overcome the backward ideas they still have.  Such
 comrades, as Comrade Mao Tse-tung points out,
 "usually take the standpoint of the bourgeoisie and
 the rich peasants or that of the well-to-do middle peas-
 ants who have a spontaneous tendency to take the
 capitalist road. They think in terms of the few, rather
 than take the standpoint of the working class and
 think in terms of the whole country and people."
 That is why they find themselves in an extremely
 awkward position among the peasant masses.  On the
 one hand, they publicize the general line among them
 and call on them to take the socialist road ; on the
 other, they refuse to approve the setting-up of co-
 operatives, or impose restrictions on those already in
 being by invoking "countless taboos and command-
 ments."  On the one hand, they want to train the more
 active elements among the peasants to organize co-
 operatives.  On the other, in some places such strange
 things take place as actually "training active elements
 to withdraw from the co-operatives" or "convening a
 conference of co-operative members who want to quit
 them, so pursuing the `task' of compression."  Some
 peasants say, "The general line calls on us to take the
 road of co-operation, but when we start our co-opera-
 tives, you refuse to give your approval and prevent
 us from taking that road."  Others complain :  "You
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 told us that small-peasant economy was no good. Now
 you are deliberately telling us to go back to individual-
 ism."  Some cadres say, "We've learnt to organize
 co-operatives.  We've never been taught how to scrap
 them !"  These are all legitimate complaints.
 But a newly emerging force is irresistible. Every-
 one knows that when our Party was first formed, when
 it was leading the peasant revolution and guerilla
 warfare and establishing bases, many people refused
 to recognize it because at the outset it was small. But
 what happened?  Our Party and the newly emerging
 force which it represented triumphed, and those who
 refused to recognize it were the ones who failed. Those
 who refused to recognize the Party finally had to do
 so.  Nowadays there are many people who adopt an
 attitude of "non-recognition" of the co-operatives.
 They will fail too.
 What lesson can we draw from all this?  That
 we must shake off the dead hand of conservative
 forces ; that we must look ahead ; that we must pay
 attention to those things among the people which are
 new and positive.  We must not keep looking back,
 only seeing what is backward and negative.  As the
 draft Decisions say, the leadership has a responsibility
 to respect and encourage the creativeness and initiative
 of the masses and protect this newly emerging force.
 PRACTICAL WORK IN EXPANDING AGRICULTURAL
 CO-OPERATION
 Once we have the policy, the main thing is how
 to do the work well.
 (1)  We must follow Comrade Mao Tse-tung's

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 injunction to handle the work "in the light of actual
 conditions," "work out proper measures suited to
 varying local conditions and give timely guidance."
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung said :
 We should realize, here and now, that an
 upsurge in socialist transformation will soon
 come about all over the country's rural areas.
 That is inevitable.
 What do we mean by an upsurge?  We mean the
 stage at which the movement draws in the broad
 masses and is no longer limited to a few active ele-
 ments.  This upsurge will come about not simply as
 a result of what the Party's leading body or a few
 individuals want, nor can it be forcibly created.  It
 will come about when objective conditions are ripe,
 when the issue involves the broad masses, not only
 a few people.
 Some comrades say :  "If the leadership says
 there is an upsurge, then there must be an upsurge!"
 This is a very thoughtless way of talking, to say the
 least.  Let us see why Comrade Mao Tse-tung chooses
 the present moment to say that a nation-wide upsurge
 in the agricultural co-operative movement is inevitable.
 In his report we find that there are three main
 reasons for this :
 First, the tremendous expansion of our national
 economy resulting from the First Five-Year Plan,
 particularly, our socialist industrial construction and
 its achievements, daily increase the peasants' en-
 thusiasm for co-operation.
 Secondly, China's mutual-aid and co-operative
 movement already has a fairly long history; the move-
 ment for mutual aid which has developed extensively
 in various places has, in fact, laid foundations for

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 organizing co-operatives.  Moreover, the superior abil-
 ity to increase output demonstrated by most of the
 hundreds of thousands of co-operatives already formed
 is an encouragement to great numbers of peasants.
 Thirdly, this upsurge has already started in some
 areas.
 All this heralds a nation-wide upsurge in the
 agricultural co-operative movement.  If we fail to see
 these signs, if we fail to discern this main trend in
 our life, we shall inevitably be left behind by the
 masses and, as Comrade Mao Tse-tung has said, in
 this upsurge of co-operation, simply totter along like
 a woman with bound feet, or become so stunned by
 success as to be quite incapable of shouldering the
 task of leadership.  Of course, this is not to say that
 the nation-wide co-operative movement will develop
 everywhere according to a uniform pattern and ad-
 vance in different places at the same rate.  The draft
 Decisions clearly state that development of the move-
 ment will be uneven.  It points out that in the main
 three different types of situation exist in different
 parts of our country. In view of this new situation,
 where a national upsurge in the co-operative move-
 ment is imminent, we must consider all the various
 local differences that exist and pay suitable attention
 to these differences at all times in our work.  Only
 by so doing can the agricultural co-operative move-
 ment be set on a common path of healthy growth.                                             In
 May 1948, the Central Committee of the Party, giving
 instructions on the work of land reform and the
 strengthening of the Party, said:
 It is necessary to train cadres to be skilled
 at analysing the actual situation and deciding on
 their task and method of work at a definite place
 and time according to the actual conditions in

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 different areas and their varying historical back-
 grounds.
 There is no doubt that this directive of the Central
 Committee is just as applicable in leading the co-
 operative movement today.
 (2)  This upsurge in the co-operative movement
 comes about because, on the one hand, objective con-
 ditions make it possible, and, on the other, because
 of the hard and careful work the Party has put in.
 It does not come about by itself.  Comrade Mao
 Tse-tung has pointed out that the key to running the
 co-operative movement well is for the Party leadership
 to be really in the lead ; the leading body of the Party
 must throw itself heart and soul into the work ; it
 must show initiative, enthusiasm and hearty welcome,
 and so give leadership to the whole movement (see
 the preface to How to Run Agricultural Producers'
 Co-operatives).  That is to say, it must be able to link
 the Party's leadership with the enthusiasm of the
 masses in organizing co-operatives.  Provided the
 Party goes on giving sound leadership, it is possible
 to hasten the onset of this upsurge in co-operation.
 On the other hand, if the Party fails to give good
 leadership, there will be no upsurge even when con-
 ditions are ripe for it; and even if an upsurge is already
 in being, it will probably meet setbacks for want of
 correct Party leadership.  Isn't it true that in some
 places where the upsurge actually started cadres and
 people became downcast and despondent because it
 was met with the wholly wrong policy of what was
 called "drastic compression"?
 Good leadership, in the first place, means that
 leading Party organizations must take care not to ad-
 vance blindly, they must show more foresight.  To
 achieve this, every province, county, district and

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 hsiang should have a comprehensive plan and not
 "allow things to be done piecemeal, tinkering with
 things here and there"  (preface to How to Run
 Agricultural Producers' Co-operatives), as Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung has said.
 In his article "On Practice," Comrade Mao Tse-
 tung wrote :
 We often hear the remark made by a comrade
 when he cannot bravely accept an assignment:
 "I have no confidence." Why has he no confidence?
 Because he has no systematic understanding of
 the nature and conditions of the work or has had
 little or even no contact with this kind of work ;
 hence the laws governing it are beyond him.
 Now on this question of co-operation, there are some
 comrades who have no understanding of the situation
 or understand only one side of the picture but not the
 whole ; there are others who have quite a bit of mate-
 rial to work on, but fail to apply the Marxist-Leninist
 method of class analysis to the question.  Such com-
 rades cannot grasp the laws governing the co-operative
 movement.  They cannot see the essential, the main
 aspects, and so they lack foresight and confidence in
 their work. The result, as Stalin has said, is that
 "they row conscientiously, pulling hard all the time;
 their boat floats smoothly, with the current, but not
 only don't they know whither the current is carrying
 them, they do not wish to know."
 Not long ago, in a report to the Central Com-
 mittee, a Provincial Committee of the Party stated :
 In carrying out the actual work, there are
 many organs of the Party committee at every
 level which have still failed to make a deep,
 consistent and diligent study of the work of the
 co-operatives, nor do they go very deep in their

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 understanding of the key questions of the move-
 ment or in summing up their experience in ex-
 tending the movement.  That is why, while we
 can carry out measures which are correct, we also
 accept measures which are wrong, even though
 we have a feeling that they are not quite right.
 This_ is really working in a daze!  The reason why
 the possession of "a comprehensive plan for co-
 operation" can become an important method of putting
 an end to this sort of daze is because such planning
 makes it necessary for all Party bodies which have
 a genuine sense of responsibility towards the revolu-
 tion to strive to grasp the whole situation, and to study
 it.  They are then bound to learn to apply the Marxist-
 Leninist method of class analysis in considering issues
 that arise.  In this way they gradually familiarize
 themselves with what was formerly unfamiliar; they
 gradually learn the laws of the co-operative move-
 ment and this enables them to foresee things. Naturally
 in drafting a comprehensive plan, especially in the
 beginning, things are liable to happen very often
 which are not quite right, and these must be sys-
 tematically corrected in the light of the actual situa-
 tion.  However, things should be easier once we have
 a plan-a plan which has been framed collectively as
 a result of thorough and repeated surveys and study,
 and which has been adopted only after the leadership
 has issued it as a draft to all Party bodies lower down,
 and after it has been thoroughly discussed and
 amended at all levels from below.  Such a plan will
 encourage us to work energetically; it will remind
 us to pay regular attention to and examine the various
 problems which confront us in every field of our work.
 As our movement develops, it will show us where we
 are right and where we are wrong.

 (3)  Pay attention to the relation between num-
 bers and quality.
 Between spring and summer of this year some
 comrades advocated "lopping off some of the co-
 operatives," their "theory" being that "when you've
 got too many co-operatives, it's difficult to manage
 them." This "theory" has gone bankrupt.  What we
 actually find in plenty of places is that the more co-
 operatives are set up, the more active the masses are,
 the fewer problems arise in the co-operatives, the
 easier it is to improve and consolidate them, and the
 greater their success in increasing yields.  Why?
 Because as more and more co-operatives are set up,
 they attract more attention from the whole Party.
 Then, because there is more opportunity to make com-
 parisons between them and compete one with another,
 they have the chance to exchange experience, the more
 backward co-operatives have an incentive to catch up
 with the more go-ahead, and that makes it far easier
 for cadres to do a better job.  Moreover, it stands to
 reason that as the socialist positions expand while the
 capitalist positions contract, more forces become avail-
 able to withstand the spontaneous tendency towards
 capitalism.  However well a co-operative starts off, it
 cannot, in the absence of large numbers of co-opera-
 tives giving one another mutual encouragement and
 co-ordinating production among themselves, expand
 reproduction to a greater extent, and it is bound to
 be seriously handicapped in its task of providing its
 members with a better life.  We can, therefore,
 reasonably draw the conclusion that a change in
 quantity will, at a certain stage, bring about a change
 in quality : quality cannot be improved independently
 of quantity.  It is wrong to work on the supposition
 that consolidation of the co-operatives can be divorced
 from the work of increasing their number, or to make

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 a sweeping generalization that the fewer co-operatives
 there are, the easier it is to consolidate them.
 That is not to say that we should go on to draw
 another unwarranted conclusion from all this, and
 imagine that the growth of co-operatives is simply a
 question of numbers and that quality can be disregard-
 ed.                                Success in agricultural co-operation is not meas-
 ured simply by growth in numbers.  As Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung says,
 Great emphasis must be placed on the quality
 of the co-operatives.  We must oppose any tend-
 ency to neglect quality and concentrate solely on
 increasing their number or bringing a greater
 number of peasant households into them.
 He makes the point that not only do co-operatives need
 a series of checkings over to bring about improve-
 ments after they have been formed, but that systematic
 spade-work needs to be done before they are set up.
 In that way the increase in number can be linked with
 improved quality.  Comrade Mao Tse-tung gave us the
 warning:  "Fight no battle that is not well prepared,
 no battle whose outcome is uncertain," and added, "If
 you want to be sure of the outcome, there must be
 preparedness, full preparedness."  That is by way of
 reminding us that we cannot run a co-operative in a
 slipshod way; we cannot work in the "help a plant to
 grow by pulling it up" way.
 Some Party members, quite content with their
 formalistic approach and with no stomach for a mass
 line which entails doing the hundred and one prepara-
 tory jobs needed to establish a co-operative, resort to
 compulsion and the giving of orders to satisfy their
 love of impressive figures.  There are even some who
 imagine that "you can shout a few slogans and get
 socialism in a few days' time."  That, too, is a dis-

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 tortion of Party policy, a distortion which kills the
 enthusiasm of the masses for co-operatives.  In no cir-
 cumstances will the Party stand this sort of thing.
 (4)  Interlink plans for co-operation with pro-
 duction plans.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung pointed out that land re-
 form is a measure designed to break the shackles of
 feudal relations of production.  It is the first step
 towards releasing the productive forces in agriculture.
 "That is the first revolution."
 Socialist co-operation is designed to transform
 the relations of production, to switch them from an
 individual economic basis to a collective one; it is
 designed to break the shackles of capitalist relations
 of production.  That is the second step towards re-
 leasing the productive forces in agriculture.  "That
 is the second revolution."  Unless this second revolu-
 tion is carried through, we cannot hope for any huge
 growth in our productive forces.
 Our peasants are industrious and hard-working.
 But in the old days, as a result of the threefold yoke
 of imperialism, feudalism and capitalism, the produc-
 tive forces in agriculture were weak and our country
 had a far lower yield per unit area of many farm
 products than many capitalist countries.  What must
 we do to overcome this backwardness? Some comrades
 pin their hopes on small-peasant economy. That is use-
 less.  The Central Committee of our Party has refuted
 this mistaken idea.  What then?  Shall we put our
 hopes on capitalism? The capitalist way of increasing
 production is, as far as the mass of peasants are con-
 cerned, a long road strewn with untold suffering. The
 Party Central Committee has shown that we cannot
 take that road.  The only possible road for us to take
 then is that of agricultural co-operation backed by a
 socialist industry.  In that way we can swiftly in-
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 crease the productive forces of our country's agricul-
 ture and enable it to catch up with and surpass
 capitalist countries.  All available data show that a
 co-operative, if it works well, can, from the day it is
 formed, start increasing production and go on doing
 so year by year.  There have been cases of co-opera-
 tive members doubling their income in a matter of
 four, five or six years.  For our Chinese peasants who
 have suffered so much for thousands of years, that is
 something truly wonderful.  The reason is clear: as
 soon as the peasants get together and organize pro-
 ductive work, they can begin to make use of their
 tremendous latent productive power.
 The Rural Work Department of the Heilungkiang
 Provincial Committee recently published some mate-
 rials summing up experience gained in agricultural
 co-operation.  "Investigation," it says, "shows that
 during its first year the efficiency of labour of a co-
 operative generally rises from 15 to 20 per cent above
 that of mutual-aid teams, and 20 to 25 per cent more
 use can be made of draught animals.  This more effi-
 cient use of means of production, including draught
 animals and farm tools, makes it possible to divert
 part of the productive forces to new production.  If
 all the 22,000 co-operatives in the province were well
 managed, this means that we should have a productive
 power equal to the labour of 150,000 people and over
 100,000 beasts, besides considerable funds to organize
 reproduction on an expanded scale.  But this is not
 all.  The continual growth of the agricultural co-
 operative movement will in future provide greater and
 greater opportunities of increasing productive forces."
 In other words, agricultural producers' co-operatives
 have a far greater chance of making full use of favour-
 able conditions to continually increase production.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 For this reason every co-operative, right from
 the start, should set about drafting a plan for increas-
 ing production.  Every county, district, hsiang (or
 village)-and particularly the hsiang (or village)-
 should, at the same time as it makes comprehensive
 plans for co-operation, draw up plans to increase pro-
 duction in its area.  Such comprehensive production
 plans will, to a far greater extent than hitherto, give
 the peasants a long-term target for building up agri-
 culture based on actual local conditions and taking
 into account the common interests of the various co-
 operatives in the hsiang or village concerned.  In this
 connection, we do not have much experience to go on
 at the moment, but we do know that as co-operatives
 spring up group by group or area by area, the need for
 an all-embracing production plan will be keenly felt.
 Local Party committees at the various levels must pay
 proper attention to this matter, and, drawing on the
 good sense of the masses, start to make a study of it.
 So much by way of explanation of some aspects
 of the draft Decisions.  I think these are the main
 things I want to talk about.  In his report Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung said :
 Needless to say,  neither socialist indus-
 trialization nor socialist transformation is easy.
 A host of difficulties are bound to crop up as some
 110 million peasant households turn from individ-
 ual to collective management and go ahead with
 technical reforms in agriculture.  But we should
 have confidence that our Party is capable of
 leading the masses to overcome such difficulties.
 We should not shirk difficulties, for instance, by being
 too scared to take the affairs of the co-operatives

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350016-7
 firmly in hand.  It is even more important that we
 should not panic in the face of difficulties and, for
 instance, start "lopping off" large numbers of co-
 operatives.  On the contrary, we must at all times
 hold ourselves ready to surmount difficulties that may
 crop up as we push ahead.  Even if difficulties are
 only local, it is still wrong to neglect them.
 The policy of co-operation laid down by the
 Central Committee of our Party is the right one and
 the steps taken to carry it out are sound.  Can there
 be any doubt that, if all Party comrades unite and
 follow the lead of the Central Committee of the Party
 headed by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, if they keep close
 to the masses and work hard and well, we shall ac-
 complish this historic task?  I should say, none.
