 oan, 49r, .a limited nuclear test ban
 treaty, for civil rights legislation, for meas-
 ures to support educational opportunity and
 manpower retraining, to name but a few,
 were quickly forgotten.  And the Nation, and
 the party, watched in immobilized fascina-
 tion as a small, zealous and willful handful
 slowly captured the mechanism of a great
 political party.
 The results of November , 8 were not so
 much support for the present administra-
 tion as the repudiation of a party which tem-
 porarily seemed to have forgotten its heri-
 tage.
 With the exceptions that take place when
 men do political combat with each other
 over time, by and large the Republican Par-
 ty since its founding in the explosive, decade
 before the Civil War has stood cona.istently
 for certain broad, principles and themes of
 public policy.  With Abraham Lincoln, early
 Republicans fought for a preservation of the
 Union-for a nation rather than for separate
 States-for internal improvements to bind
 together a growing America, and for free-
 men...
 It was Lincoln, in a speech in Springfield,
 6, years prior to his election in 1860, who
 provided Republicans with a criterion as
 applicable today as it was then as we seek
 to determine what programs are appropriate
 and inappropriate for government to under-
 take.  Said the first Republican President:
 "The legitimate object of government is to
 do for a community of people whatever they
 need to have done, but cannot do at all, or
 so well do for themselves, in their separate
 and individual capacities.  In all that the
 people can individually do as well for them-
 selves, government ought not to interfere.
 It was for succeeding generations to deter-
 mine the community to be served and the
 level of government most appropriate to meet
 those needs.  It was for succeeding genera-
 tions to determine whether particular needs
 of society might most appropriately be met by
 the public or the private sectors of our econ-
 omy or by a combination of the two.  Thus
 have ensued the struggle and the challenge of
 federalism and of a free economy regulated
 in the public interest.  It has been the Re-
 publican Party,                              whether led  by Theodore
 Roosevelt, Robert A. Taft, or Dwight D.
 Eisenhower, which has attempted to strike
 the correct balance between the demands of
 a few and the welfare of the many.  Anti-
 trust regulation, conservation of our natural
 resources, equitable labor-management rela-
 tions, and incentive for the States and the
 private economy to solve specific problems
 have all beer} Republican initiatives.
 Serious problems confront our Nation in
 the jungles of South Vietnam, in the weak-
 ened NATO alliance, in the financing of the
 United Nations, and in the growing prob-
 ability of proliferating nuclear nations. Mil-
 lions of fellow human beings suffer from
 All health and malnutrition.  Is it top much
 eo expect to put some of the finest minds
 in the country, who are Republicans, to work
 on these problems  Perhaps, as in science,
 a breakthrough is in order by leapfrogging
 ahead of the inertia of ideas and practice
 which often builds up in the governmental
 mechanism.
 In  international. affairs,  the Republican
 Party has  never  been  like  the proverbial
 ostrich with its head in the sand despite the
 outcries one. hears from a few "againers"
 in our party, who would abandon the United
 Nations, repeal the income tax, repudiate
 mutual security and junk the theory of col-
 lective security alliances such as NATO.  This

 McKinley, who stated clearly that America  a scientific elite can devise cannot avert
 had  a responsibility to educate backward  danger for such a society.  Sterility of the
 peoples and to help bring them into the    mind means that men all too easily accept
 20th century.  It was Republican Theodore
 Roosevelt who used the office of the Presi-
 dency to promote peace between warring
 nations such as Russia and Japan.  It was
 Republicans, such as Wendell Willkie, Henry
 L. Stimson, and Herbert Hoover, who clearly
 stated America's responsibilities in combat-
 ing foreign dictatorships whether of the left
 or of the right.  It was Republican Christian
 Herter, as chairman of a special committee
 in the Republican controlled 80th Congress,
 who recommended, along with another Re-
 publican, the late Senator Arthur Vanden-
 berg, that stricken Western Europe, the vic-
 tors and the vanquished, be resuscitated,
 and that we agree with the Atlantic nations
 to stand together in defense of the freedom
 of each of us.
 Republicans in the U.S. Senate during the
 Kennedy and Johnson administrations have
 worked to strengthen the President's hand
 in Cuba, in Berlin, in mutual security, and
 in South Vietnam.  We gave leadership to
 Senate ratification of the nuclear treaty.
 As an American, I hope that the foreign
 policy of the Johnson administration may
 be successful.  All free men must work to
 advance the cause of peace and freedom.
 As a Republican, I am concerned that ab-
 stract piety not be a substitute for calm
 and courage.    Republicans,  under Eisen-
 hower, squarely faced the tensions and the
 threats and demonstrated, I think, a unity
 and determination in such crises as Guate-
 mala, Berlin, Suez, Lebanon, and the For-
 mosa Straits.                                                                                  Americans, under a Demo-
 cratic administration, deserve no less.  The
 times demand candor in stating for the
 American people why we must continue to
 sacrifice in far-away and inconvenient places
 if we are to prevent the inevitable encroach-
 ment upon free peoples which seems to be
 the appetite of totalitarian states.
 When the Republican Party has welcomed
 to its ranks men and women of good will
 from all walks of life, from all faiths, and
 from all races it has been successful in Na-
 tional, State and local elections.  When it
 has not, a national political tragedy such
 as 1964 was inevitable.
 I believe that freedom has been best pre-
 served and human well-being best advanced
 in the American society by two vigorous,
 competitive political parties, each creatively
 seeking to devise methods by which decently
 to gain the confidence of a majority of peo-
 ple and go on to win.  Yet, only once since
 1932, has a Republican captured the Presi-
 dency, the highest prize of American poli-
 tics.  Only twice since 1932, have Republi-
 cans  controlled  Congress.   Public  opinion
 polls show that nationally but a quarter of
 the American  people  identify themselves
 with the Republican Party, while the re-
 mainder consider themselves as Democrats
 or independents.
 A persistent imbalance in political power
 in favor of a single political party poses con-
 public relations for public programs.  Such
 sterility of the mind can mean a paper set-
 tlement at Geneva instead of actual political
 stability in southeast Asia.  It can mean a
 continued nibbling at the edges of poverty
 and unemployment rather than facing the
 hard decisions required, the moral awaken-
 ing involved, and the sacrifice needed to ex-
 pand educational, health, and job opportuni-
 ties for young and old alike.
 Nowhere is such mental sterility more ap-
 parent than in our cities, which continue to
 be clogged with slums, with traffic, and with
 crime.  Racial  tensions  remain.       All  the
 urban renewal and, public housing in the
 world will not mean a better America unless
 we work to aid people in becoming better.
 Houses  alone   do  not  cure the  problem.
 Money alone, no matter how bountifully ex-
 pended, does not make for morality.                                                                                                                                            Legis-
 lation alone cannot guarantee solutions.
 The need is for dedication, for thought,
 for a decent consecration by our people to the
 public interest and to public affairs.  Who
 can provide this leadership?  Who can fill
 the vacuum which now exists in this land
 and in the Republican Party?  You can, and
 so must the rest of young America if we are
 are protect what we have, and to go about
 improving our lot and discharging our duty
 to mankind.
 The birth rate of the Second World War
 has provided the Republican Party with a
 new opportunity which, regrettably, it was
 not able to provide for itself.  Next year 1
 million more young Americans will reach
 age 18 than have this year.      The average
 yearly increase in America's teenage labor
 force in the 1960's will be almost six times
 the average yearly increase in the 1950's.  By
 the next presidential election, the age of the
 average American will have dropped from 33
 years of age in 1960 to 25 or less.
 You and your companions enter American
 life with a clean slate.  For you, the political
 battles of the 1930's have faded and receded
 into  history.   You are entering a society
 where our philosophy must be one of ever-
 expanding horizons for all, rather than mere-
 ly dividing up what exists between the haves
 and the have-nots.  You are entering a so-
 ciety where all the slogans and imagery of the
 past, "New Frontier," "Fair Deal," or "New
 Deal"  will not solve the problems of  an
 urbanized America and a deeply troubled
 world.
 Without the rigor of thought and the en-
 thusiasm for ideas which an education such
 as yours should provide; without the self-
 discipline to face a variety of challenges;
 without the will to deal with reality rather
 than appearances, this Republic could decay.
 Yours is a historic opportunity to strengthen
 the Nation by bringing your own energy and
 your zeal  to  the service of the Republic
 through the Republican Party.

 The very fact that a man is poor means

 hopefulness to lift himself unaided.  Chang-

 symbol of what is happening across the Na-
 tion, where all of us are realizing that all
 the poor are the responsibility of all America.
 I am struck, too, by the way the VISTA

 PROBLEMS  OF COLLEGE EDUCA-
 TION-MORE  CONTACTS  WITH
 PROFESSORS NEEDED
 Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, in a
 recent issue of the Washington Evening
 Star there. appeared an article entitled
 "It's Time to Return to 'Old Main'."
 The article was written by Jenkin Lloyd
 Jones, who very effectively demonstrates
 weaknesses that have developed in our
 institutions of higher learning because
 of the chasm that separates the mem-
 bers of the student body from true con-
 tact with the professors.
 I wish to quote a few of the pertinent
 statements that Mr. Jones made in his
 discussion of this important subject:
 A college is not a factory or a supermarket,
 and college bigness doesn't bring down the
 cost per student.  The Federal Government
 and thegreat'foundation should quit en-
 ticing professors away from teaching by the
 lavish and idiotic business of offering re-

 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the entire article by Mr. Jones
 be printed in the RECORD.  I also ask
 unanimous consent to have printed in
 the RECORD, in connecion with the article
 by Mr. Jones, an article entitled "Jet-
 ;.Age Professors," written by Leonard
 Gross.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows;
 IT'S TIME To RETURN TO "OLD MAIN"
 (By Jenkin Lloyd Jones)
 On most, university campuses of any an-
 tiquity in the United States ,there remains
 the original building from which the school,
 amebalike, has divided and grown.  Usually
 they call it old main.
 Old  main  is  almost  invariably  ugly,  a
 belfried Victorian pile of narrow windows.
 creaky floors, uncertain  heat  and  roller
 shades. And in spite of its central location it
 is getting harder, to find.
 Dominating and dwarfing old main now
 are the modern classroom buildings, the
 super new laboratories, the conference cen-
 ter, the student union-and farther out, the
 fieldhouse. the stadium and the high rise
 dormitories.
 Yet old main is loved.  Its picture appears
 most often on the cover of the alumni maga-
 zine.                                                                               It represents the vanished day when
 students knew their professors and profes-
 sors their students. It is a wistful reminder
 of the age when the institution had what
 the  cheerleaders  used  to  call  spirit,  a
 collective  personality  with  which     both
 faculty and students could identify them-
 selves with pride.
 It doesn't do to grow too sentimental about
 old main.   It didn't represent any golden
 age of knowledge. It dates back to frock-
 coated professors and 'a rigid diet of Greek,
 Latin, rhetoric, logic, and a shotgun course in
 philosophy that included such sciences as
 there were. But when the entire graduating
 class could assemble in their wide cravats
 and stiff collars on the steps of old main for
 their final photograph there was no doubt
 that alma mater was a mother to them all.
 Following the recent student riots at the
 University of California at Berkeley, which
 are, perhaps, to be expected under any ad-
 ministration  that  seems  to  be  uncertain
 about who's running the school, there has
 been consideralile inquiry into the origins of
 the unrest. And one theory advanced is that
 students at Berkeley are sick of being non-
 entities in a giant learning machine.
 With 25,000 students that university has
 ceased to be.a personality. As its capacity to
 inspire loyalty among its charges his dimin-
 ised, so has its ability to maintain discipline.
 Alma mater has died and her place has been
 taken by a bewildering and amorphous city
 of classrooms in. which the immature and
 recently arrived citizens can neither identify
 themselves with any traditions nor feel any
 kinship with the powers in city hall.
 The time is overdue when we must con-
 sider how to rehumanize our colleges and
 universities.
 Our first job is to handle the problem
 of bigness.  Ten years ago there were 2.25
 million college students in America.  Now
 there are 4.5 million.  University presidents
 have been deep in the business of empire
 biulding, aided by heavy Federal grants. In
 the meantime, many privately endowed col-
 leges, with good academic standards, have
 been starved as the income tax has dried up
 sources of gifts.  Everywhere there are lean
 little junior colleges and miserable teachers
 colleges that haven't had the favor of State
 legislatures.
 What we ought to do is stop the physical
 expansion of the great State universities.
 This can be done easily by cutting the un-
 dergraduate enrollments by stiff entrance
 requirements  so that these schools may
 concentrate on graduate work.
 Then we must reequip and upgrade the
 smaller schools  and build  a lot more  of
 them.  This would not be more expensive.
 A college is not a factory or a supermarket
 and college bigness doesn't bring down the
 cost per student.  The ideal should be a
 top enrollment of 5,000.  The football teams
 might not be so hot, but students would
 begin to belong to something again.
 Then the Federal Government and the
 great foundations should quit enticing pro-
 fessors away from, teaching by the lavish
 and idiotic business of offering research
 grants -to almost any applicant.
 3669
 In a recent article in the New York Times,
 Peter Schrag, secretary of Amherst College,
 quotes one college administrator as follows:
 "It's so easy to get grants,that a fellow's
 dedication to teaching declines.  Why labor
 in the vineyards when you can get a Ful-
 bright or some other grant that enables you
 to. study or work at what you want?  The
 old publish-or-perish becomes travel-and-
 triumph while enjoying life more fully in-
 stead of plugging away at the old routine."
 The "old routine," of course, is the busi-
 ness of teaching young people, which is what
 professoring used to be about.  But no more.
 In most of the great universities the actual
 teaching is being done by graduate students
 who are only slightly more acquainted with
 the subjects than their pupils. It is ridicu-
 lous to let brilliant lecturers amuse them-
 selves in private research, writing compli-
 cated treatises of interest only to other ad-
 vanced scholars.  Let's get them back to the
 rostrum and the blackboard.
 The United States should not be appalled
 by the flood of young people now hammering
 at the college gates. We should be delighted.
 But  at  no  greater  cost  than  academic
 megalopolises we can have undergraduate
 schools small enough to have personality and
 esprit, where students can once again have
 contact with professors.
 Old main must rise again.
 JET-AGE PROFESSORS
 After a century of ridicule and neglect, the
 American university professor has come upon
 sweet times.  Everyone wants the benefit of
 his  brain-government,  industry,  founda-
 tions and, of                                                                                                                                              course,  universities. Their
 blandishments are glittery: expensive tools,
 extensive time, intensive travel, and excellent
 pay.  Yesterday's   tower-bound  professor
 often moonlighted to make ends meet.   The
 jet-age professor, if he's good, can write his
 own ticket.   One who is and does is pictured
 here.
 George Maslach, dean of Berkeley's College
 of Engineering, is a professor of aeronautical
 engineering.  A colleague calls him "the out-
 standing experimentalist in the world" in his
 field, rarefied-gas dynamics.  Twice recently,
 Maslach has turned down "$50,000 kind of
 things" from industry because life as he now
 lives it is too exciting.  It's 3 minutes from
 his campus office, where he supervises the
 education of an inordinate number of the
 Nation's better engineering students, to his
 contemporary home in the hills above, where,
 from his balcony, the entire bay area spreads
 before him.  During the school year, he aver-
 ages at least one trip a month East as a con-
 sultant, and turns another down.  During
 summers and sabbaticals, he jets with his
 wife and three children to Europe, where he
 serves on a NATO advisory board. What-
 ever can be gained from life among the aca-
 demic elite, George Maslach is getting.
 But are students getting what they should
 from professors like George Maslach? The
 question dominates academic debate today.
 Critical educators charge that many profes-
 sors find research grants and consulting fees
 so seductive they have all but abandoned
 teaching.  If it's not the professor, it's his
 university, which, mindful of its reputation,
 demands that he "publish or perish."  Either
 way, the argument holds, the student loses
 out.  Teaching is frequently shunted to as-
 sistants and graduate students.  Many un-
 dergraduates have only passing contact with
 the best faculty minds.  Students are all
 but forgotten,. says a recent Carnegie Foun-
 dation report, in the "headlong search for
 more and better grants, fatter fees, higher
 salaries, higher rank."  And because Cal's
 faculty is rated among the top  four na-
 tionally, the Berkeley campus is invariably
 cited as the villainous prototype of a "uni-
 versity on the make."
 Such abuses dismay Maslach and George
 Pimentel, the restless, committed chemistry
 professor pictured on the next page.  At

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE                 March 1
 Berkeley, it is a matter of policy that even
 the most venerated faculty stars teach under-
 graduate courses in addition to graduate
 seminars.  It is a matter of honor that pro-
 fessors not let outside work interfere with
 their teaching, and not accept work that
 doesn't enhance it.  Neither honor nor pol-
 icy is violated nearly so often as charged.
 Maslach and Pimentel agree, but each would
 like to see such violators as do exist sent
 packing.
 Both men make conscious efforts to work
 with  undergraduates.  Says  Maslach:  "If
 any student thinks enough of me to ask me
 to advise him, I, by God, am going to respond,
 even if it takes hours." Pimentel never locks
 his office  door.  His students revere him.
 Says one: "With him, you're a colleague rath-
 er than an underling." The author of a pop-
 ular high school chemistry textbook, Piinen-
 tel learned a few years ago that high school
 teachers were counseling their better stu-
 dents to avoid Berkeley, lest they be lost in
 the bigness.  Pimentel organized. a freshman
 science honors program designed to stimu-
 late talented minds through close faculty-
 student contact.
 In one vital respect, however, both pro-
 fessors find the current criticism specious.
 To them, there is no choice between research
 and teaching.  The only choice is between
 mediocrity and excellence.  There are few
 good teachers who don't do research, they
 contend; most research translates into good
 teaching. Maslach: "Research and teaching
 are synonymous words.  If you don't do re-
 search, you're going to be a trade school."
 Pimentel: "Research and teaching are like
 sin, and confession.  If you don't do any of
 the former, you don't have anything to talk
 about in the latter."
 Beneath the heat are questions that Amer-
 ican universities, already splitting at the
 seams, must confront at once: What is a
 university for?  Who should study there?
 The vision of men like Maslach and Pimentel
 is as new as the future, as old as medieval
 Oxford.  A university is, above all, for schol-
 arship, and for students with the potential
 to be scholars.  Says Pimentel.: "The pri-
 mary obligation of the university is to make
 sure there is a place for the very best stu-
 dent.  If we don't do it, nobody else will."
 The average student?  This year, Maslach
 predicts, Berkeley will suggest to its 20,000
 applicants that many of them might learn
 more and be happier at one of California's
 many good 4-year colleges.  Given the de-
 mands of the jet age, such a solution may be
 unavoidable.  "We want a growing percent-
 age of our population to be going to the
 university," says George Pimentel, "but we
 don't want the caliber of their education to
 decline."

 Into this home was born the man we are
 future.  The captive nations of Europe
 will not be captive for long, for such
 subjugation is contrary to the basic de-
 sires of the people.
 One of the smallest of these nations
 is Estonia. Last Thursday, February 24,
 she celebrated her independence from
 Russia which was proclaimed on Febru-
 ary 24, 1918.  Russia invaded the land
 of this brave people in the early part of
 World War II, and again in 1944, sub-
 jecting them once more to Russian im-
 perialism and control.
 Yet no people has held more tena-
 ciously to the idea that their subjection is
 only temporary. Estonian history teach-
 es that the dedication to liberty and
 independence in that country is strong
 and enduring. In America, the Estonian
 National Committee has been doing su-
 perior work to alert all Americans to the
 necessity of supporting our friends in
 Eastern Europe.
 America is dedicated to the idea that
 all men ought to be able to choose their
 own government. In commemoration of
 this special day, we rededicate ourselves
 to this ideal, and extend to the Estonian
 people our hopes for a better world in
 the near future.  They have not been
 forgotten, nor will they be. Even though
 the Estonians themselves cannot cele-
 brate Estonian Independence Day, we in
 this country can. By doing so, we show
 to the entire world that we deeply believe
 that communistic imperialism is doomed
 to destruction.  Tyranny of one group
 of rulers over another people has never
 been successful, and never can be per-
 manent.
 Mr. President, I take this opportunity
 to express my respect for the Americans
 of Estonian descent who continue to work
 for the day when Estonia will once again
 be free.
 GEORGE WASHINGTON, THE FA-
 THER OF OUR COUNTRY
 Mr. ELLENDER.  Mr. President, each
 year on February 22, radio station KDBS,
 in Alexandria, La., broadcasts a commen-
 tary on the life of George Washington
 and the great importance his influence
 held for the birth of our Nation.  Station
 KDBS is owned and operated by Mr.
 Irving Ward-Steinman, of Alexandria, a
 longtime friend of mine.  Mr. -Ward-
 Steinman has always interested himself
 in civic service to his city, State, and Na-
 tion, and he has had this eloquent com-
 mentary on George Washington printed
 for distribution to all interested persons.
 I believe it is worthy of inclusion in the
 RECORD; and, as a matter of fact, I am
 thinking about-today, some 230 years later.
 Born into wealth, into luxury, into com-
 fort.  Born without the necessity of proving
 his right to anything.  It was ready made.
 All he had to do was to sit in the lap of
 destiny and enjoy the fruits of his father's
 diligence and inheritance.
 Like his - father who had inherited a tre-
 mendous land estate, he was in line for this
 preprepared estate.  No work-no worry-no
 want.  All this young man had to do was to
 pass his days pleasantly; enjoy his nights,
 and arise for the following day's round of
 enjoyment and good fellowship.
 If this was all-we would not know about
 our young man.  If the story ended where
 it began, with wealth and ease and plenty,
 this would not be a memorial.
 We can go further.  We can make a stark
 statement.  If this young man had not been
 born, would there be a United States of
 America.
 What is there in the spark known as des-
 tiny, that glow which creates history, which
 selects one person and to that person points
 an eternal finger and whispers: "Your coun-
 try needs you."
 Ever since that memorable day, on Feb-
 ruary 22, 1732, the nobility inherent in man
 has outraced the pitiful apathy of unthink-
 ing man.
 The wealth this young man inherited came
 from another source.  The real wealth he
 contained came, not from his earthly father,
 but from his heavenly father-God.
 He had a belief in God.  He felt his re-
 sponsibility- to man and mankind.  Not con-
 fined by the realisms of having to make a
 living, he devoted his resources. both tem-
 poral, and spiritual, to building a nation un-
 der God.  He represented a steadfast leader-
 ship.    There was hostility.  His country-his
 native land, now ours, was under a foreign
 power.
 There were injustices. Instictively, he re-
 jected foreign domination.      God had given
 man an instrument to think with, a heart
 to act under, and a forum to place into op-
 eration the combined results.
 To this person, an opportunity to serve is
 a mandate from on high. Nothing is by
 accident.  He counted his blessings and ac-
 quired skills.  Throughout all these learning
 processes, he retained a humility. Why had
 his forebears come to this wild and un-
 disciplined land.
 There was work to do.  Every child of
 God, of every age, has a task to perform; a
 work to execute; a job to complete.
 And this man of destiny went to work.
 The land had to be surveyed, farms laid
 out, crops planted, trees grown, communi-
 ties organized,  leaders selected, stools es-
 tablished, roads laid out, policy created, gov-
 ernment achieved.
 One obstacle remained.  Absentee owner-
 ship, foreign rule,  external  control-these
 were alien to the ideals of justice and self-
 government.  No foreign entanglements and
 what had been had to be severed.  The um-
 bilical attaching the child to the mother had
 to be cut.  The child was growing-with all
 its pains.
 Disagreement  was  inevitable.    Disagree-

 tong bombs crumpled the 4-story concrete
 building.  The soldier was in the rubble for
 18 hours before he was pulled out.
 By late Thursday, the toll from the blast
 was :
 One American killed in the hotel when a
 bomb went off in the hotel bar.  Another
 died later in the hospital.  Sixteen Ameri-
 cans were wounded but survived and got out.
 Four escaped injury, and got Out. Twenty-
 two others, including two believed to be still
 alive, were buried under the mountain of
 debris.
 The blast also buried 12 Vietnamese house
 servants working in the hotel.  The mangled
 leg of one could be seen protruding from the
 rubble.
 FAMILY  OF  SEVEN KILLED
 A family of seven Vietnamese living in a
 nearby house also died.
 All the Americans in the hotel were Army
 enlisted men with the 140th Maintenance
 Detachment, except for the American killed
 in the bar.  He was a Special Forces man.
 Soon after the first cries for help, the cries
 of three other men in the rubble were heard.
 One of them was pulled out, leaving two
 Others trapped late Thursday.
 One of the heroes of the bloody night
 killed two of the Vietcong attackers and sur-
 vived himself.
 Spec. 5 Robert K. Marshall was on the
 second floor of the building when the at-
 tack began.  Vietcong squads poured  ma-
 chinegun fire into the building.
 FIRES BACK WITH RIFLE
 Marshall rushed onto the balcony of the
 building with his carbine and emptied his
 magazine at two terrorists firing from a street
 across the way.  After killing both, he rushed
 back into his room for more ammunition,
 but the explosion went off at that moment.
 Marshall was evacuated to Saigon.
 Marshall saved himself by diving under his
 bed when the building collapsed.
 The Vietcong bomb squad hit the building
 from  three  sides.  A  40-pound  explosive
 charge in a suitcase was found later in a
 store across the street.
 Capt. Charles A. Brassart, 32, of Pittsburgh,
 Pa., saw the hotel go down.

 Hon. ROBERT C. BYRD,
 Senator from West Virginia,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SIR: I don't know if you remember
 me.  I was the Army captain who fired the
 small arms demonstration for you at Vet-
 erans' Day ceremonies at Welch, W. Va., 1962.
 In early 1963, the Army was asking for
 volunteers  for  combat  duty  in  Vietnam.
 Being a career infantry captain, I felt if my
 country needed volunteers for combat duty,
 it was my responsibility. I responded to this
 call.  After 8 months of extensive schooling,
 I reported for duty with Military Assistance
 Advisory Group, Saigon, Vietnam, on Decem-
 ber 6, 1983.
 With my schooling and combat experience
 from the Korean war, I was immediately as-
 signed to a line infantry battalion as bat-
 talion adviser.  After 31/2 months as battal-
 ion adviser, I was moved up to regimental
 adviser.  On the morning of April 4, 1964,
 my regiment was ordered to retake a town'
 2 kilometers  from the  Cambodian border
 that the Vietcong had taken the night be-
 fore.  At 1030 hours that morning we made
 first contact with a Communist outpost.  We
 reduced the Communist resistance and con-
 tinued to advance.  By 1430 hours that after-
 noon, after three times failing to heed my
 warnings to secure his flanks, the Vietnamese
 regimental commander lead his regiment into
 Star for gallantry in action. In my opinion,
 it makes no difference whether I lost the use
 of my legs in Korea or Vietnam.   Either
 place, I was fighting a common enemy of
 the United States with the ultimate goal of
 keeping this country and other countries
 free from Communist domination.
 Any consideration or assistance that you
 can render in getting this law amended will
 be greatly appreciated by me and other mem-
 bers of the Armed Forces who have lost the
 use of their legs while fighting In Vietnam.
 I have the honor to remain,
 Yours very truly,
 DONALD S. CUNNINGHAM,
 Captain, AUS, Retired.
 WEST VIRGINIA-THE NATION'S TOP
 COAL PRODUCING STATE
 Mr. BYRD of West Virginia.  Mr.
 President, the Nation's top coal produc-
 ing State is about to reach another mile-
 stone.  Sometime this month the mines
 of West Virginia will produce the 7 bil-
 lionth ton in the history of our coal in-
 dustry.  The occasion is important not
 only in tribute to the comfort of our peo-
 ple and the industrial progress of our
 Nation; it also provides an opportunity to
 emphasize that there is a vast volume of
 solid fuel remaining within the confines
 of our State which will be available to
 provide heat and power for generations
 to come.  Coal was first found in our
 part of the Appalachian basin more than
 two centuries ago.  As early as 1800,
 commercial mines were operating in
 Brooke and Monongalia Counties. When
 West Virginia became an independent
 State  in  1863,  annual  production
 amounted to about a quarter of a million
 tons-most of which came from Ka-
 nawha, Preston, Mineral, Mason, and
 Marshall Counties. As soon as the War
 Between the States was-terminated, pro-
 duction Increased quickly, passing the
 million-ton mark in 1869.
 By that time coal's advantages as a
 heating fuel were becoming generally
 recognized; railroads branched out to
 mine communities and began to take
 over a growing share of the transporta-
 tion that previously had been confined to
 water movement.  With the develop-
 ment of the bessemer process for steel-
 making, coal became established as one
 of the world's most important commodi-
 ties.
 West Virginia's coal output first ex-
 ceeded 100 million tons after World War
 setled slightly in the middle twenties,

 problem: How to assure that any political
 settlement reached can be enforced on the
 scene.
 The point is made that there once was a
 political settlement-the Geneva agreement
 of 1964-but that its terms have been vio-
 lated by Communist infiltration from North
 to South Vietnam.  The need, therefore, is
 to find arealistic way of seeing that agree-
 ments are observed.
 For these reasons British officials see the
 necessity for continuing American air attacks
 in North Vietnam.  They think a real set-
 tlement can come only if North Vietnam is
 persuaded that the price of trying to take
 over the south is too high.
 The important thing, as one official put it,
 is for the  West to leave any  conference
 table convinced that South Vietnam will be
 left alone.
 The support for continuing air strikes is
 conditioned on one factor-that the strikes
 be aimed specifically at northern support of
 the Vietcong guerrillas inT the south.  Gen-

 It    agreed that the the shaping of any
 crucial al part to play iin
 settlement.  Only if Moscow believes that
 the risk is getting too high In the Vietnam
 fighting will the time be ripe for negotia-
 tions, officials say.
 One element that gives concern about Gen-
 eral de Gaulle's  activity is the possibility
 that it may be premature.  Government of-
 ficials do not think publicized peace moves
 are particularly helpful now.
 The attitude in the British Government
 seems to be close to the American position,
 as far as that is known.  It is a hard-boiled
 attitude, based on the belief that negotia-
 tions in Vietnam cannot be a cover for a
 handover of the south to the Communists
 without endangering the Western position
 in Asia generally.
 It continues to surprise many observers
 that a labor government is taking so firm
 a line.  The Government is doing so despite
 restiveness in the Labor Party's leftwing.
 The leader of the conservative opposition,
 Sir Alec Douglas-Home, said today that he
 thought    a  political  solution  in  Vietnam
 would be desirable.      Then he added:
 "But I must say America is taking the
 right position on the question of negotia-
 tions now.                     There is no basis for a confer-
 ence unless we have the certainty that there
 would be a way to police what the conference
 decides."

 CLAIR ENGLE: A EULOGY
 Mr. KUCHEL:  Mr. President, last
 July 30, 1964, it was my sad duty to an-
 nounce to the Senate the death of a dis-
 tinguished  American  statesman,  our
 beloved friend and late colleague from
 California, U.S. Senator Clair Engle.
 Clair Engle was a man of high courage
 and unique ability.  Forceful, colorful,
 articulate, and persuasive, he faithfully
 served the people of California and the
 Nation during all of his adult lifetime.
 The Senate had a sweet fondness and a
 real respect for him, which reflected the
 continuing esteem in which he was held
 by all who knew him.
 Clair Engle was a Californian in every
 sense of the word. He was born in Bak-
 ersfield on September 21, 1911.  His
 grandfather Engle, who was of German-
 English decent, had fought in the Mexi-
 can War under Gen. Zachary Taylor,
 emigrated to California in search of gold
 in 1849, and ended up as a cattle rancher.
 Clair's father, Fred J. Engle, worked
 variously as a cattle rancher, school-
 teacher, lawyer, and railroad man. His
 mother, whose maiden name was Keeran,
 was of Irish heritage and also descended
 from California pioneers.
 In a State where most of the people are
 newcomers,  Engle's  third-generation
 status--on both sides of the family-
 made him a Californian indeed.
 A  top  House  Republican today     labeled
 President Johnson's  Great Society plan a
 blueprint for  an  all-powerful,  one-party
 Government.
 Representative MELVIN R. LAID, Republi-
 can, of Wisconsin, chairman of the House
 Republican conference and principal author
 of  the  1964 GOP national        platform,  also
 assailed Mr. Johnson's conduct of foreign
 affairs. He  predicted  the  administration
 would seek a negotiated end to the war in
 Vietnam and that this would lead to a Com-
 munist takeover.
 He said Republicans know that commu-
 nism respects strength and seeks accommo-
 dation only for its own purposes.  But he
 said the administration apparently will seek
 eventually to negotiate itself out of South
 Vietnam.
 In a speech prepared for House delivery,
 Representative LAID said the painfully small
 Republican minority in Congress would con-
 tinue to speak its piece, and with the voice
 of a moral majority.

 DECLARATION OF THE NEUTRALITY OF LAOS,
 JULY 23, 1862
 (The  1954 Geneva accords provided  for
 the withdrawal of Vietnamese Communist
 forces from Laos and for the reintegration of
 the Pathet Lao Into the national community.
 However, it was not until 3 years later that
 the Pathet Lao, having achieved important
 concessions from the Royal Lao Government
 agreed to the reunification and ostensibly to
 the  dissolution of Pathet Lao  forces.  In
 1959, the Pathet Lao reverted to the use of
 force and by spring of 1961 won a series of
 military victories and were in a position to
 take over the country.  In 1961 a de facto
 cease fire was achieved under the govern-
 ment of Prince Boun Oum and the Geneva
 Conference to settle the Lao question con-
 vened, which finally resulted in agreement in
 1962, by which a coalition government would
 be established, all foreign troops and mili-
 tary personnel withdrawn, and the use of
 Lao territory for "interference in the internal
 affairs of other countries" was prohibited.)

 objection?  The Chair hears none, and
 the clerk will state the nomination.
 The legislative clerk read the nomina-

 The nomination was confirmed.
 Mr. HILL. Mr. President, I ask unan-
 imous consent that the President be im-

 the nomination.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  With-
 out objection, the President will be noti-
 fied forthwith.
 LEGISLATIVE SESSION
 On request by Mr. HILL, and by unan-
 imous consent, the Senate resumed the
 consideration of legislative business.
 THE SITUATION IN VIETNAM
 Mr.  McGEE.   Mr.  President,  the
 Members of this body have been making
 significant contributions, it seems to me,
 in their willingness to discuss the many
 ramifications concerning Vietnam which
 bother not only this country but also the
 world at large.
 It was on the 17th of February, I be-
 lieve, that the marked increase in the
 tempo of the discussions on this issue
 began.  On that occasion, the distin-
 guished senior Senator fromIdaho [Mr.
 CHURCH] and the distinguished junior
 Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Mc-
 GovERNT made known their thoughts.
 We have had a very protracted collo-
 quy on the implications of their sugges-
 tion, that we negotiate now.  A conse-
 quence of that long colloquy has been
 the further development and, may I say,
 sophistication of the-discussion of this
 question.  Over this weekend one notes
 that a number of things have come to a
 head.
 In making my own remarks I advo-
 cated that in the United States we make
 certain that no one on the other side
 misunderstands our intentions, that we
 get much tougher, that we seal off the
 border of South Vietnam, and call the
 hand there.
 Over the weekend there has been much
 discussion of the statement by Soviet
 Premier Kosygin.  We cannot know its
 full meaning, but we can see the range
 of what is implied and make our selec-
 tions.
 I would suspect that his remarks are
 met best by the explanation that he is
 seeking to get the initiative back from
 Peiping, to which it had been lost in 're-
 cent weeks, and that they are aimed more
 at Peiping than they are Washington.
 To the extent that they may have been
 addressed to Washington we see the same
 kind of language being employed that
 was employed by Stalin at the time of
 the Berlin crisis, and that was employed
 when Khrushchev threatened us in Cuba.
 We gave our answer then, and it is
 imperative that we likewise be prepared
 to give the same answers today; namely,
 that we will stand and see it through.
 A part of that answer has already been
 given by Secretary of State Rusk, in re-
 stating our basic position in southeast
 Asia, in which he left no doubt as to
 where we stand; namely, that as long as
 the Reds continue to violate the border
 between South and North Vietnam, we
 will not go to the bargaining table with
 them.  We have said again that in-
 transigence, belligerence, aggression, and
 terror are not suitable credentials for
 entrance to honorable negotiations be-
 tween nations.  Just this weekend the
 State Department presented overwhelm-
 ing evidence to show the nature of the
 new brand of aggression.
 I do not agree that all the guerrillas
 could be called back by Hanoi, even if
 Hanoi wanted to pull them all back, be-
 cause many thousands of them could not
 be found.
 As I have suggested several times in
 recent days, I believe we should announce
 that the cessation of the act of infiltra-
 tion across the Vietnam border by the
 forces--regular or irregular-of North
 Vietnam, and that the cessation of ac-

 nomic, and military strength in being to
 make aggression unprofitable, but also that
 there must be a demonstrated willingness of
 major external power both to assist and to
 intervene if required.
 3. In southeast Asia, finally, there was a
 third major flaw-the difficulty of liquidating
 colonial regimes and replacing them by new
 and stable independent governments.  The
 Philippines became independent and with
 our help overcame the ravages of war and
 the Communist Huk rebellion.  The British,
 who had likewise prepared India and Burma
 and made them independent, were in the
 process of doing the same in Malaya even as
 they joined with the Malayans in beating
 back a 12-year Communist subversive effort.
 Indonesia was less well prepared; it gained
 its independence, too, with our support, but
 with scars that have continued to affect the
 otherwise natural and healthy development
 of Indonesian nationalism.
 LEADERSHIP FALLS TO COMMUNISTS
 French Indochina was the toughest case.
 The French had thought in terms of a slow
 evolution to an eventual status within some
 French union of states--a concept too lei-
 surely to fit the post war mood of Asia.  And
 militant Vietnamese nationalism had fallen
 to the leadership of dedicated Communists.
 We  all know the results.   Even France
 was unable to defeat the Communist-led na-
 tionalist  movement.   Despite       last-minute
 promises of independence, the struggle in-
 evitably appeared as an attempt to preserve
 a colonial position.  By 1954, it could only
 have been won, again, by a major U.S. mili-
 tary  commitment,                                                                                                                                              and  perhaps  not  even
 then.   The  result  was  the settlement at
 Geneva.   The accords reached    there were
 almost certainly the best achievable, but
 they left a situation with many seeds of
 future trouble. Briefly:
 1. North Vietnam was militantly Commu-
 nist, and                                                                                                                                            had  developed  during   the  war
 against the French an army well equipped
 and highly skilled in both conventional and
 subversive warfare.  From the start, North'
 Vietnam planned and expected to take over
 the south and in due course Laos and Gam-
 .podia, thinking that this would probably
 happen by sheer decay under pressure, but
 prepared to resort to other means if needed.
 2. South Vietnam had no effective or popu-
 lar leadership to start with, was demoralized
 and  unprepared for  self-government,  and
 had only the remnants of the Vietnamese
 military forces who had fought with the
 French.  Under the accords, external military
 help was limited to a few hundred advisers.
 Apart from its natural self-sufficiency in food,
 South Vietnam had few assets that appeared
 to match those of the north in the struggle
 that was sure to come.
 3. Cambodia was more hopeful in some
 respects, more remote from North Vietnam,
 with a leader in Prince Sihanouk, a strong
 historical tradition, and the freedom to ac-
 cept external assistance as she saw fit.  From
 the start Sihanouk insisted, with our full
 and  continuing  support,  on  a  status of
 neutrality.
 4. Laos, however, was less "unified and was
 left under the accords with a built-in and
 legalized Communist presence, a disrupted
 and weak economy, and no military forces of
 significance.
 ACTION STARTED IN 1954
 Such was the situation President Eisen-
 hower and Secretary Dulles faced in 1954.
 Two things were clear; that in the absence
 of external help communism was virtually
 certain to take over the successor states of
 Indochina and to move to the borders of
 Thailand and perhaps beyond, and that with
 France no longer ready to act, at least in
 South Vietnam, no power other than the

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE                 March 1
 United States could move in to help fill the
 vacuum.
 Their decision, expressed in a series of ac-
 tions starting In late 1954, was to  move in
 to help these countries.  Besides South Viet-
 nam, and more modest efforts in Laos and
 Cambodia, substantial assistance was begun
 in Thailand.
 The appropriations for these actions were
 voted by successive Congresses, and in 1954
 the Senate likewise ratified the Southeast
 Asia Treaty,  to which Thailand  and  the
 Philippines adhered along with the United
 States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zea-
 land, and Pakistan.  Although not signers
 of the treaty, South Vietnam, Laos, and Cam-
 bodia could call on the SEATO members for
 help against aggression.
 COMMITMENT WAS MADE
 So a commitment was made with the sup-
 port of both political parties, that has guided
 our policy in southeast Asia for a decade
 now.  It was not a commitment that en-
 visaged a U.S. position of power in south-
 east Asia or U.S. military bases there.  We
 threatened no one.  Nor was it a commitment
 that substituted U.S. responsibility for the
 basic responsibility of  the nations them-
 selves for their own defense, political sta-
 bility, and economic progress. It was a com-
 mitment to do what we could to help these
 nations attain and maintain the independ-
 ence and security to which they were en-
 titled-both for their own sake and because
 we recognized that, like South Korea, south-
 east Asia was a key area of the mainland of
 Asia.  If it fell to Communist control, this
 would enormously add to the momentum and
 power  of  the  expansionist  Communist
 regimes in Communist China and North Viet-
 nam, and thus to the threat to the whole free
 world position -in the Pacific.
 Let us look at Vietnam from the beautiful
 city of Saigon.  I visited Saigon in December
 of 1963 with five of my colleagues, and spoke
 at length with Gen. Paul D. Harkins, com-
 mander of our Military Assistance Advisory
 Group, Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, and
 many of our American military and business-
 men. in the area.  The most striking thing
 about Vietnam is the fact that it is the
 richest agricultural area in the world.  The
 experts have said that sufficient food can be
 produced in this area to feed almost all of
 Asia.  This territory in the southern portion
 of Vietnam also permits guerrilla forces to
 live off the land without a constant resupply
 to sustain their activities in the field.  The
 area is abundant in geese, ducks, and of
 course the staple commodity-rice.
 During the early phase of the Vietnamese
 operation against the Vietcong, our military
 adviser initiated a policy wherein all of the
 villages of the country were organized and
 defended in a unique manner.  Instead of
 letting the farmers fall prey to small ma-
 rauding bands of Vietcong, each town was
 fortified.   The valuables were placed in a
 warehouse or hut in the center of town, and
 at the first sign of an attack, the villagers
 would retreat to this redoubt, and a radio
 call for help was sent to the nearest army
 force whose immediate response was guaran-
 teed through the use of helicopters and other
 high-speed aircraft, in conjunction with para-
 troop operations.  When the war was vir-
 tually won in the north the Vietcong were
 starved out, but in the south they could rely
 upon  the  overabundance  in  the  Mekong
 Delta to support their opeartion, hence their
 success in the Saigon area.
 HAD TO STOP WAR
 The war has been further complicated by
 the very complex situation within the coun-
 try.           You can imagine the problems our ad-
 visers had with the turnover of governments.
 The American advisers had to get military
 advice to the proper authorities, and to de-
 termine who was in power very often caused
 a cessation of combat operations with the
 enemy.  In effect, the war would stop while
 the heads of government and the key lead-
 ers In the army were change(L and this meant
 a complete retraining program by the Ameri-
 can mission of all military unit heads as well
 as political subdivision chiefs.
 Probably one of the hallmarks of our mis-
 sion in Vietnam has been the extreme pa-
 tience of our American advisers, from our
 Ambassador and military commandars, down
 to the valiant  Americans who spill  their
 blood along with their Vietnamese comrades.
 The situation to say the least is vexatious
 but we must always keep our eyes on our
 strategic role-that of thwarting these Com-
 munist advances.
 We will be successful.  The Vietnamese
 will win their struggle.  However, the road
 to victory never has been easy.  The future
 may call for more intensive strikes at the
 base and source of Communist power and
 aggression in North Vietnam.     The borders
 of South Vietnam may have to be sealed
 to prevent the flow of reinforcements and
 war material to the subversive Communist
 army.  The 1,800 miles of coastline must be
 patrolled and the potential for resupply of
 North Vietnamese operations on the sea be
 destroyed.
 The American people stand firm behind
 their President and behind the principles of
 freedom everywhere.
 AGREEMENT  ON  THE  CESSATION  OF  HOSTILI-
 TIES IN VIETNAM, JULY 20, 1954
 (The  Geneva  agreements       theoretically
 ended the war between French Union forces
 and the Vietminh In Laos, Cambodia, and
 Vietnam. These states were to become fully
 independent countries, with the last named
 partitioned near the 17th parallel into two
 states  pending reunification  through  free
 elections to be held by July 20, 1956.   The
 United States and Vietnam are not signa-
 tories to these agreements.)

 'VO THOI
 Sgt. Vo Thoi (Communist party alias Vo
 Bien) was an assistant squad leader in the
 Vietcong Tay Son 22d Battalion.  On the
 night of October 7, 1963, his unit attacked
 An Tuong village in Binh Dinh Province.
 After overrunning the village, Vo's company
 was assigned to set up an ambush against
 Republic of Vietnam troops rushing to de-
 fend the village.  In the ensuing fight, Vo
 was seriously wounded.  He was picked up
 by local farmers and turned over to the au-
 thorities.
 Vo's life and experiences were similar to
 those of thousands of Vietcong.  Born in
 Quang  Ngai Province in  1932,   he went
 through 5 years of school and then worked
 on his parents' small farm. During the war
 against the French, he joined the Viet Minh
 forces. When the fighting ended, he was
 transferred to North Vietnam with his unit,
 the 210th Regiment.  He remained in the
 North Vietnamese Army until 1960 when. he
 was sent to work on a state farm lu,Nghe An
 Province. In September 1962, Vo was told he
 must join the newly activated 22d Battalion.
 All the members 4f the battalion came from
 provinces in South Vietnam, from Quang Tri
 to, Phu Yen.  But it was not an ordinary
 battalion; two-thirds of its members were
 cadre with ranks up to senior captains.
 The group was put through an advanced
 training course that lasted 6 months.  It in-
 cluded combat tactics for units from squad
 to company and the techniques of guerrilla
 and counterguerrilla fighting.  There were
 heavy doses of political indoctrination.
 On March 5, 1963, the 22d Battalion was
 ordered to move South.  They were trans-
 ported in trucks from Nghe An Province to
 Doug Hoi in Quang Binh, just north of the
 17th parallel.  From there the unit was
 moved westward to  the Laotian border.
 Then the more than 300 men began walking
 to the south following mountain trails in
 l,,aos and the Vietnam border area.  'they
 marched by day, rested at night.     Every
 fifth day, they stopped at a way station for a
 full day's rest.  One company dropped off at
 Thua Thien Province.  Vo and the remainder
 of the group marched on to Pleiku Province.
 Two fully, armed companies from a neighbor-
 ing province were assigned to the battalion.
 The assignment given to the 'Tay Son Bat-
 talion was to harass strategic hamlets in the
 Hoaian district of Binh Dinh, to round up
 cattle and rice, to kill or kidnap cadre of the
 Government forces, and  to recruit 'local
 youth for service with the Vietcong.
 NATIVES, TOO
 Native North Vietnamese military personnel
 The Communist authorities in Hanoi are
 now assigning native North Vietnamese in
 increasing numbers to join the Vietcong
 forces in South Vietnam.
 Vo Thanh Vinh was born in Nghe An Prov-
 ince in North Vietnam in 1936.  He, was
 captured by South Vietnamese forces on
 May 5, 1964. He described himself as a mili-
 tary security officer.  He infiltrated into
 South Vietnam in April 1964 with a group of
 34 police and security officers from North
 Vietnam.
 Another,. native North Vietnamese captured
 in the,$outh ,was V}eteong Private First Class
 Vo Quyen. His home was in Nam Dihn Prov-
 ince.  He was a member of the 2d Battalion
 of the North Vietnamese Army's 9th Regi-
 ment.  He said the entire battalion had
 infiltrated  into  South  Vietnam  between
 February and May last year.    He was cap-
 tured in an action in Quang Tri Province on
 July 4. He told interrogators that the bulk
 of his unit was composed of young draftees
 from North Vietnam.
 Le Pham Hung, also a private first class,
 was captured on July 7 in Thua Thien Prov=
 ince.  He is a-native of Nam Dinh in North
 Vietnam.  He had been drafted for military
 service in May 1963.  His unit was the 324th
 Division. His group, consisting solely of 90
 North Vietnamese draftees, infiltrated into
 South Vietnam in May 1964.  He reported
 that another company of North Vietnamese
 entered the'south at the same time as his
 unit.
 A former member of the 90th Vietcong Bat-
 talion reported that his unit had been rein-
 forced by native North Vietnamese troops
 earlier this year.  Le Thua Phuong, an in-
 formation cadre, surrendered to government
 forces on April 23, 1964.  He said that the
 90th Battalion had received 80 North Viet-
 namese replacements in February.
 A medical technician named Hoang Thung
 was captured in Thua Thien Province on
 July 4, 1964.  He said he had infiltrated into
 the south in late 1963 with a group of 200
 Vietcong, the majority of whom were ethnic
 northerners, 120 of them draftees.
 These reports destroy one more fiction
 which the authorities in Hanoi have sought
 so long to promote-that the fighting in the
 south was a matter for the South Vietnamese.
 They underline Hanoi's determination to
 press its campaign of conquest with every
 available resource.
 INTELLIGENCE
 The heart of the Vietcong intelligence or-
 ganization is the central research bureau in
 Hanoi.  Communist agents are regularly dis-
 patched from North Vietnam, sometimes for
 brief assignments but often for long periods.
 Many of these agents move into South Viet-
 nam along the infiltration trails through
 Laos,  But others are carried by boats along
 the coasts and landed at prearranged sites.
 A special maritime infiltration group has
 been developed in North Vietnam and its
 operations are centered in Ha Tinh and
 Quang Binh provinces just north of the 17th
 parallel.
 In July 1962 a North Vietnamese intelli-
 gence agent named Nguyen Viet Duong be-
 gan training to infiltrate South Vietnam.
 A native southerner, he had fought against
 the French and had gone to North Vietnam
 after the war ended.  Selected for intelli-
 gence work, he was assigned to the central
 bureau in 1959.
 After a period of intensive instruction in
 radio transmission, coding and decoding, and
 other skills of the intelligence trade, he was
 given false identity papers and other sup-
 plies and was transported to the South.  His
 principal task was to set up a cell of agents
 to  collect  military  information.  He flew
 from Hanoi to Dong Hot.  From the latter
 port, the maritime infiltration group took
 him by boat to South Vietnam.        That was
 in August 1962.
 In January 1963, Luong reported to Hanoi
 that he had run into difficulties.   His money
 and papers had been lost and he had been
 forced to take refuge with Vietcong contacts
 in  another  province.  Another agent was
 selected to go to South Vietnam.     One of his
 assignments was to contact Duong, find out
 details of what had happened to him, and
 help Duong reestablish himself as a Vietcong
 agent.  The man selected for the task was
 Senior Capt. Tran Van Tan of the central
 intelligence organization.
 Tan had already been picked to go to the
 South to establish a clandestine Vietcong
 communications center to maintain contact
 with Hanoi.  Helping Duong was one of his
 secondary  assignments.   After  intensive
 preparations, Tan was ready to move to
 South Vietnam in March.   He was trans-
 ferred to an embarkation base of the mari-
 time infiltration group just north of the 17th
 Parallel.
 He was joined by three other Vietcong
 agents and the captain' and three crewmen
 of the boat that would take them south.
 Each was given false identity papers to con-
 form to their false names.  They also were
 provided with fishermen's permits, South
 Vietnamese voting cards, and draft cards or
 military discharge papers.  The boat captain
 received a boat registration book, crew lists,
 and several South Vietnamese permits to
 conduct business.  The agents had to be-
 come familiar with simple boat procedures
 so they could pass as fishermen.
 The expedition left the embarkation port
 on April 4.  In addition to the four agents,
 the boat carried six carefully sealed boxes.
 These contained a generator, several radios,
 some weapons, and a large supply of South
 Vietnamese currency.  They also carried some
 chemicals   and materials for making false
 identification papers. Their destination was
 a landing site on the coast of Phuoc Tuy
 Province.
 Soon after leaving North Vietnam, the
 Vietcong boat encountered high winds and
 rough seas.  On April 7, the storm became
 violent.   The  boat threatened to capsize.
 Strong northeasterly winds forced it ever
 closer to shore.  Finally, the boat captain,
 Nguyen Xit, ordered that the six boxes be
 thrown overboard.  This was done and the
 boat then was beached.  The eight men de-
 cided to split up into pairs and try to make
 contact with Vietcong forces.  They buried
 their false papers and set out. Six of the
 eight were captured almost immediately by
 authorities in Thua Thien Province.  The
 other two were taken several days later.
 Student propaganda agents
 The student population of South Vietnam
 is an important target group for Vietcong
 propagandists.  These agents seek to win
 adherents for the Communist cause among
 young workers, students in high schools and
 universities, and the younger officers and en-
 listed men in the armed forces of the Re-
 public of Vietnam.
 Typical of the agents sent into South Viet-
 nam for this purpose is Nguyen Van Vy, a
 19-year-old native of the Vinh Linh district
 In North Vietnam, just north of the demili-
 tarized zone.  He was a member of a Com-
 munist Party youth group in his native vil-
 lage.                                                                                                                 He was recruited for propaganda work
 in the south in the fall of 1962. He was one
 of 40 young persons enrolled in a special po-
 litical training course given by the Commu-
 nist Party in his district.
 PHASE  1
 The first phase of the training consisted of
 political indoctrination.
 Those who successfully completed the first
 phase were selected for the second level of
 training, the so-called technical training
 phase. In this, the trainees were given their
 mission in the south.
 Vy was told he should infiltrate into South
 Vietnam and there surrender to the authori-
 ties, describing himself as a defector who was
 "tired of the miserable life in the north."
 He was to say he wanted to complete his
 schooling which was impossible in the north.
 He was told to ask to live with relatives in
 the south so he could go to school. Once his
 story was accepted and he was enrolled in a
 school, he was to begin his work of propa-
 gandizing other students.
 He was assigned to work under an older
 agent to whom he had to report regularly.
 A third member of the team was a younger
 man who was to assist Vy.  The three were
 to infiltrate into South Vietnam separately
 and to meet here at a rendezvous point.
 At first, Vy was to do no more than ob-
 serve his fellow students carefully, collecting
 biographical data on them and studying
 their personalities and capabilities.  He was
 then to select those he thought might be
 most influenced by Communist propaganda
 and try to make friends with them.
 THE TARGETS
 Once he had selected targets, he was to
 begin to influence them favorably toward

 the north and to implant Communist prop-
 aganda. Be was responsible then for bring-
 ing into his organization those he had in-
 fluenced effectively.  These individuals were
 to be given their own propaganda assign-
 ments to work on other students.
 Students who wanted to evade military
 service in the Government forces were con-
 si4ered prime targets.  Where possible, Vy
 was to help them get to North Vietnam. He
 was also told to make contact with any stu-
 dents who were suspected of Communist ac-
 tivities. These, too, were to be helped to es-
 cape to North Vietnam. Any useful informa-
 tion concerning developments in the south or
 military  activities  were  to  be  reported
 through his superior, Nguyen Van Phong.
 In case he became suspect, he was either
 to make his own way back to North Vietnam
 or to go into the jungle and try to contact a
 Vietcong unit.
 Vy entered South Vietnam on January 2,
 1963, by swimming across the Ben Hai River.
 He encountered an elderly farmer who led
 him to the local authorities in Hai Gu.
 There he toldhis story but it was not be-
 lieved.  He then admitted his true mission.
 THE SOURCE
 When Hanoi launched the Vietcong cam-
 paign of terror, violence and subversion in
 earnest in 1959, the Communist forces relied
 mainly on stocks of weapons and ammuni-
 tion left over from the war against the
 French.  Supplies sent in from North Viet-
 nam came largely from the same source.  As
 the military campaign progressed, the Viet-
 cong depended heavily on weapons captured
 from the armed forces in South Vietnam.
 This remains an important source of weap-
 ons and-ammunition for the Vietcong. But
 as the pace of the war has quickened, re-
 quirements for up-to-date arms and special
 types of weapons have risen to a point
 where the Vietcong cannot rely on captured
 stocks.  Hanoi has undertaken a program to
 reequip its forces in the South with Com-
 munist-produced weapons.
 Large and increasing quantities of military
 supplies are entering South Vietnam from
 outside the country.  The principal supply
 point is North Vietnam which provides a
 convenient channel for materiel that origi-
 nates in Communist China and other Com-
 munist countries.
 An increasing number of weapons from
 external Communist sources have been seized
 in the south.  These include such weapons
 as 57 mm. and 75 mm. recoilless rifles, dual-
 purpose machineguns, rocket launchers, large
 mortars, and antitank mines.
 A new family of Chinese Communist-
 manufactured weapons has recently appeared
 in Vietcong hands.  These include the 7.62
 semiautomatic carbine, 7.62 light machine-
 gun, and the 7.62 assault rifle.  These weap-
 ons and ammunition for them manufactured
 in Communist China in 1962 were first, cap-
 tured in December 1964, in Chuong Thien
 Province.  Similar weapons have since been
 seized in each of the four corps areas of
 South Vietnam. Also captured have been
 Chinese    Communist   antitank  grenade
 launchers and ammunition made in China
 in 1963.
 CASE IN POINT
 On February 16, 1965, an American heli-
 copter pilot flying along the South Vietnam-
 ese coast sighted a suspicious vessel.  It was
 a cargo ship of an estimated 100-ton capacity,
 carefully camouflaged and moored just off-
 shore along the coast of Phu Yen Province.
 Fighter planes that approached the vessel
 met machinegun fire from guns on the deck
 of the ship and from the shore as well.  A
 Vietnamese  air force strike was launched
 against the vessel and Vietnamese Govern-
 ment troops moved into the area.                     They
 seized the ship after a bitter fight with the
 Vietcong.
 The ship, which had been sunk in shallow
 water, had discharged a huge cargo of arms,
 ammunition, and other supplies. Documents
 found on the ship and on the bodies of sev-
 eral Vietcong aboard identified the vessel as
 having come from North Vietnam.  A news-
 paper in the cabin was from Haiphong, and
 was dated January 23, 1965.  The supplies
 delivered by the ship-thousands of weapons
 and more than a million rounds of ammuni-
 tion-were almost all of Communist origin,
 largely from Communist China and Czecho-
 slovakia as well as North Vietnam.  At least
 100 tons of military supplies were discovered
 near the ship.
 A preliminary survey of the cache near
 the sunken vessel from Hanoi listed the fol-
 lowing supplies and weapons:
 Approximately 1 million rounds of small
 arms ammunition.
 More than 1,000 stick grenades.
 Five hundred pounds of TNT in prepared
 charges.
 Five hundred antitank grenades.
 Two  thousand  rounds  of  82-millimeter
 mortar ammunition.
 Five hundred rounds of 57-millimeter re-
 coilless rifle ammunition.
 More than 1,000 rounds of 75-millimeter
 recoilless rifle ammunition.
 One 57-millimeter recoilless rifle.
 Two heavy machineguns.
 Two thousand 7.95 Mauser rifles.
 More than 100 7.62 carbines.
 One thousand submachineguns.
 Fifteen light machineguns.
 Five hundred rifles.
 Five hundred pounds of medical supplies
 (with  labels  from  North  Vietnam,  Com-
 munist  China,  Czechoslovakia,                                                                                  East  Ger-
 many, Soviet Union, and other sources).
 The ship was fairly new and had been
 made  in  Communist China.           Documents
 aboard the ship included three North Viet-
 namese nautical charts (one of the Haiphong
 area and one of Hong Gay, both in North
 Vietnam, and one of the Tra Vinh area of
 South Vietnam).  The military health rec-
 ords                                                                        of  North  Vietnamese  soldiers  were
 found.  The man had  a political history
 sheet showing he was a member of the 338th
 Division of the North Vietnamese Army.
 POWER LINES
 Military affairs of the Vietcong are the re-
 sponsibility of high command of the People's
 Army of North Vietnam and the Ministry
 of Defense, under close supervision from the
 Lao Dong Party (North Vietnamese Com-
 munist Party).   These responsibilities in-
 clude operational plans, assignments of in-
 dividuals and regular units, training pro-
 grams, infiltration of military personnel and
 supplies, military communications, tactical
 intelligence, supplies, and the like.  The six
 military regions are the same as those of
 the Vietcong political organization * * *
 The hard Core of the Vietcong military
 organization is the full-time regular unit
 usually based on a province or region.  These
 are  well-trained  and  highly disciplined
 guerilla fighters.
 The size of the Vietcong regular forces
 has grown steadily in recent years.  For ex
 ample, the Vietcong have five regimental
 headquarters compared with two in 1961.
 And the main Vietcong force is composed of
 50 battalions, 50 percent more than before.
 There are an estimated 139 Vietcong com-
 panies.  Hard-core Vietcong strength now is
 estimated at more than 32,000 whereas it
 was less than 20,000 in 1961.
 Supporting the main force units of the
 Vietcong are an estimated 60,000 to 80,000
 part-time guerrillas.  They are generally or-
 ganized at the district level where there are
 likely to be several companies of 50 or more
 men each.  These troops receive only half
 pay which means they must work at least
 part of the time to eke out a living.
 THE CRA
 Below the Irregular guerrilla forces of the
 district are the part-time, village-based guer-
 rillas.  They are available for assignment by
 higher headquarters and are used for har-
 assment and sabotage.  They are expected
 to warn nearby Vietcong units of the ap-
 proach of any force of the legal government.
 They provide a pool for recruitment into
 the Vietcong district forces. * * *
 A key element in the Vietcong effort is an
 elaborate organization in Hanoi called the
 Central Research Agency (CRA-Cuc Nghien-
 Cuu Trung-Uong).  Though it handles Ha-
 noi's intelligence effort on a worldwide scale,
 the main focus of its operation is on South
 Vietnam.  The research agency is able to
 draw on the intelligence capabilities of both
 the Lao bong Party and the North Viet-
 namese armed forces for information, per-
 sonnel, and facilities.
 The CRA reportedly operates under the
 close personal scrutiny of Ho Chi Minh him-
 self.  Some of the top officials in the Hanoi
 government reportedly sit on its directing
 committee, Including Premier Pham Van
 Dong, Deputy Premier Truong Chinh, and
 Defense Minister Vo Nguyen Giap. * * *
 The headquarters of the CRA in Hanoi is
 divided into six main sections, not includ-
 Ing a special code unit.  The six sections are
 responsible for administration, cadres, com-
 munications, espionage, research and train-
 ing. * * *
 CRA headquarters directs a number  of
 special centers for oversea operations. One
 such center maintains intelligence channels
 to oversea areas.  It operates through spe-
 cial units at Haiphong and at Hongey.
 A second special center is responsible for
 Vietcong intelligence operations in Cambodia
 and Laos.  A third center handles activities
 along the  "demarcation  line,"  the border
 with South Vietnam.  The unit is based in
 Vinh-Linh in southeast North Vietnam. This
 center is responsible for sending agents and
 supplies to the south by sea. * * *
 Inside South. Vietnam, the Vietcong have
 a large intelligence network.  Some of its
 units are responsible for receiving and send-
 ing on agents arriving from the north.  They
 feed and give instructions to groups infil-
 trating into South Vietnam.  They take de-
 livery of equipment and supplies received
 from the north and relay them to Vietcong
 units in the south.
 Many Vietcong agents have been captured
 in the city of Saigon.  They have exposed the
 extensive effort by the CRA to penetrate all
 Republic of Vietnam government agencies,
 foreign  embassies,  and  other  specialized
 organizations. * * *
 Taken as a whole, the North Vietnamese
 intelligence operation in support of the Viet-
 cong is one of the most extensive of Its kind
 in the world.
 AND NOW
 Today the war In Vietnam has reached
 new levels of intensity.  The elaborate effort
 by the Communist regime in North Vietnam
 to conquer the south has grown, not dimin-
 ished.  Military men, technicians, political
 organizers, propagandists and secret agents
 have been infiltrating into the Republic of
 Vietnam from the north in growing num-
 bers.  The  flow  of  Communist-supplied
 Weapons, particularly those of large caliber,
 has increased.  Communications links with
 Hanoi are  extensive. Despite  the  heavy
 casualties of 8 years of fighting, the hard-
 core Vietcong force is considerably larger
 now than it was at the end of 1961.
 The government in Saigon has undertaken
 vigorous action to meet the new threat. The
 United States and other free countries have
 increased their assistance to the Vietnamese
 Government and people.  Secretary of State
 Dean Rusk visited Vietnam in 1964, and he
 promised the Vietnamese: "We shall remain.
 at your side until the aggression from the
 north has been defeated, until it has been.
 completely rooted out and this land enjoys
 the peace which it deserves."
 President Johnson has repeatedly stressed
 that the U.S. goal is to see peace secured in

 Another $4 million is going to improve
 Burma's inland waterways fleet. The United

 coming.
 An additional $4.8 million is for the ex-
 pansion of the government's lumber industry.
 With this aid, the Burmese have purchased
 five sawmills and reequipped seven others.
 To help launch a controversial land re-
 form program, the United States is giving
 Burma more than $3 million to develop its
 land and water resources.

 STATEMENT By RUSK ON U.S. POSITION IN
 SOUTHEAST ASIA
 (Secretary of State Dean Rusk issued the
 following prepared statement yesterday at his
 news conference.)
 1. The nations of southeast Asia have a
 right to live in peace, free from aggression
 directed against them from outside their
 borders.  This is not an empty theory, it is
 a point of vital importance to the safety
 and, indeed, the very existence of more than
 a hundred smaller nations all over the world,
 2. North Vietnam, In callous disregard of
 the Agreements of 1954 and 1962, has directed
 and supplied the essential military personnel
 and arms for a systematic campaign of ter-
 ror and guerrilla action aimed at the over-
 throw of the Government of South Vietnam
 and at the imposition by force of a Commu-
 nist regime. The evidence of North Vietnam's
 direct responsibility for this aggression has
 been repeatedly presented by the Govern-
 ment of Vietnam, the U.S. Government, and
 the International Control Commission.  A
 full and up-to-date summary of the evidence
 establishing, this responsibility will be avail-
 able within a very few days.
 3. The attitude of the United States to-
 ward threats to the peace in southeast Asia
 has been made clear many times and in the
 most serious and formal ways:
 (a) by the ratification of the Manila Pact
 in February 1955, which includes South Viet-
 nafn as a protocol state;   (This treaty was
 ,approved by the Senate by a vote of 62 to 1.)
 (b) by a decision of President Eisenhower
 in 1954, set forth in a letter to the President
 of South Vietnam: "The implications of the
 agreement concerning Vietnam have caused
 grave concern regarding the future of a coun-
 try temporarily divided by an artificial mili-
 tary grouping, weakened by a long and ex-
 hausting, war and faced with enemies without
 and by their subversive collaborators within.
 "The purpose of this offer to assist the
 Government of Vietnam in developing and
 maintaining a strong, viable state, capable of
 resisting attempted subversion or aggression
 through military means."
 (c) by the joint resolution of the Congress
 of the United States, passed in August 1964
 by a combined vote of 502 to 2, which stated,
 among other things:
 "That. the Congress approves and supports
 the determination of the President, as Com-
 mander in Chief, to take all necessary meas-
 ures to repel any armed attack against the
 forces of the United States and to prevent
 further aggression.
 'The United States regards as vital to its
 national interest and to world peace the
 ma4ntenance of international peace and se-
 curity in southeast Asia.
 "The United States is, therefore, prepared,
 as the President determines, to take all nec-
 essary steps, including the use of armed force,
 to assist any member or protocol state of
 the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty
 requesting assistance in defense of its free-
 dom,"

 on the oocesipn of signing that joint resolu-                          1965]
 tion:                                        NEGOTIATION?-U TISANT'S VIEW ON VIETNAM
 "To any in southeast Asia who ask our help
 in defending their freedom, we shall give it.
 "In that region, there is nothing we covet,
 nothing we seek-no territory, no military
 position, no political ambition.  Our one de-
 sire-our  one  determination-is  that  the
 people of southeast Asia be left in peace to
 work out their destinies in their own way."
 4. It has been stated over and over again
 that the key to peace in southeast Asia is the
 readiness of all those in that area to live at
 peace and to leave their neighbors alone.
 There is no mystery about that formulation;
 those who are not leaving their neighbors
 alone know exactly what it means.  It is an
 obligation under the 1954 Agreements, under
 the 1962 Accords on Laos, and under general
 International law.  The Illegal Infiltration of
 military personnel and arms cannot be de-
 scribed as "leaving your neighbor alone."
 5. There have been negotiated settlements
 in southeast Asia, the most recent one as late
 as 1962.  Those several agreements were in-
 tended' to establish peace in that area; com-
 pliance with them by all concerned can
 achieve that result.
 6. Since the Geneva Conference. of 1962,
 the United States has been in active and con-
 tinuous consultation with other governments
 about the danger created by aggression in
 southeast Asia.  It has been discussed in the
 United Nations, in the SEATO and NATO
 Councils, and on innumerable occasions di-
 rectly with other governments through dip-
 lomatic channels. We have had direct discus-
 sions with almost every signatory of the
 Agreements of 1954 and 1962.  What is still
 missing is any indication that Hanoi is pte-
 pared to stop doing what it is doing against
 its neighbors.  The absence of this crucial
 element affects the  current discussion  of
 "negotiation."  Political channels have been
 and. are open and a considerable number of
 governments are actively interested in keep-
 ing them open to explore the possibilities of
 a peaceful solution, But a negotiation aimed
 at the acceptance or the confirmation of ag-
 gression is not possible. A negotiation which
 simply ends in bitterness and hostility merely
 adds to the danger.
 7. Let me remind you that on February 17
 the President said:
 "As I have said so many, many times, and
 other Presidents ahead of me have said, our
 purpose, our objective there is clear.  That
 purpose and that objective is to join in the
 defense and protection of freedom of a brave
 people who are under attack that is controlled
 and  that  is  directed  from  outside  their
 country.
 "We have no ambition there for ourselves.
 We seek no dominion.     We seek no conquest.
 We seek no wider war.    But we must all un-
 derstand that we will persist in the defense
 of freedom, and our continuing actions will
 be those which are justified and those that
 are made necessary by the continuing aggres-
 sion of others.
 "These actions will be measured and fitting
 and adequate.  Our stamina and the stamina
 of the American people is equal to the task."
 Let me conclude by reaffirming, still once
 more, that the central object of American
 policy and action is peace in southeast Asia
 and the safety of the independent states
 in that region.  Many of the peoples of that
 area have been subjected to 25 years of tur-
 moil and violence; they are entitled to peace.
 We should much prefer to use our resources
 as a part of an international effort to assist
 the economic and social development of the
 peoples of that area than to have them di-
 verted into the harsh necessities of resisting
 With a rarely matched twisting of the
 truth, but at least with a certain insolent
 candor, Secretary General U Thant of the
 United Nations has now openly become an
 apologist and propagandist for Communist
 aggression in southeast Asia.
 U Thant has now trumpeted as revealed
 truth, and without hesitation or qualifica-
 tion, the whole basic Communist line that
 the war in South Vietnam was only a little
 homegrown contest involving two sets of
 local boys until dreadful old Uncle Sam in-
 tervened to assist the anti-Communist gov-
 ernment of  that country.  He has  called
 upon us to negotiate and to withdraw our-
 selves as soon as possible.
 In the process, he has rewritten 10 years
 of history, annulling 10 years in which the
 Communist government of North Vietnam
 has undeniably and consistently directed and
 supplied  and commanded a tireless  and
 savage invasion of South Vietnam in endless
 violation of agreements made in 1954 at just
 such negotiations as are now being so pressed
 upon us.
 Thus, with U Thant's now unhidden re-
 cruitment to them, those forces seeking to
 blackmail or persuade the United States into
 abandoning its commitments in South Viet-
 nam and to cut and run are at last complete.
 And what a pretty company they make for
 any American to travel with.
 Thant, the Soviet Union, and Charles de
 Gaulle of France-this is the splendid trinity
 that, whatever the intention in individual
 cases, is taking actions to remove the Ameri-
 can presence in Asia, to sully an American
 effort against pillage and murder of signal
 honor and decency, and to open all south-
 east Asia to the faceless hordes of Commu-
 nist China.
 And it would all be done under definitions
 that only Thant and the Communists can
 understand: If Communist forces invade or
 infiltrate a country, the resulting fighting is
 only local and nobody is intruding anywhere.
 If anti-Communist forces respond to an in-
 dependent country's appeal for help against
 marauders, then this is not only interven-
 tion but also quite unacceptable interven-
 tion.
 Even the precious little band of Demo-
 cratic Senators that has been crying for
 weeks for negotiation-even though it Is per-
 fectly plain that negotiation at this stage
 would be outright surrender to aggression-
 may find itself a bit unhappy with the in-
 ternational associates it,now has.
 When the Soviet Union pushes us toward
 negotiation-again, at this stage, before we
 could possibly negotiate from strength in
 South Vietnam-is it really likely that this
 would be in the interests of the United
 States?  When Charles de Gaulle of France
 pushes us toward negotiation, is it really
 likely that this would be in the interests
 of the United States, considering that Charles
 de Gaulle for years has been attempting to
 break down American influence all over the
 world?
 Is it not odd that U Thant should feel
 free to interfere in this matter anyhow, since
 neither North Vietnam, the aggressor state
 here, nor Communist China, its master, is
 even a member of the organization for which
 he speaks?
 And does the Democratic splinter in the
 Senate know that, according to word to me
 from a distinguished allied Ambassador, it
 has already succeeded in convincing the
 diplomatic community here that the majority
 party of this country is not behind the Presi-
 dent in Vietnam?  The fact that this esti-
 mate is absurdly wrong and that a vast ma-
 jority of both parties backs the President

 RED AGGRESSOR: EVIDENCE AGAINST HANOI
 (By Roscoe Drummond)
 The United States is ready to submit to
 the United Nations Security Council or any
 other proper body, massive, and mounting
 proof that the war in South Vietnam is
 armed and directed from Hanoi.
 The evidence is now fully prepared for use
 by the Government at the right moment.
 It rests on captured arms, captured docu-
 ments, testimony of  Communist defectors
 and interrogation of North Vietnamese pris-
 oners of war.
 It proves that the aggression against South
 Vietnam is inspired, commanded, controlled,
 and supplied by the Communist regime in
 Hanoi.
 This evidence shows a systematic viola-
 tion of the frontier that Hanoi agreed to
 respect in the Geneva agreements-of 1954 and
 In the Laotian agreement of 1962.
 This evidence makes North Vietnam the
 procuring force in the attempt to overthrow
 the Government of South Vietnam and, in
 the words of Under Secretary of State George
 W. Ball, "the mainspring of the whole Viet-
 cong effort."
 Here is a good cross section of the infor-
 mation that documents the role Hanoi has
 played from the beginning:
 Infiltration: From 1959 to 1964, Hanoi sent
 19,000 military personnel across the border to
 wage war against South Vietnam.  This fig-
 ure comes from cross-checked reports from
 prisoners, defectors, and secret documents.
 There is substantial information that 15,000
 additional infiltrators entered South Viet-
 nam during this period. In guerrilla warfare,
 20,000 guerrillas can be equal to a regular
 army of 200,000 to 300,000.
 Vietcong leadership: Most officers, the key
 cadres and the technicians for hard-core
 Vietcong units operating in South Vietnam
 are from North Vietnam.
 Arms supplies: Large and increasing quan-
 tities of weapons are entering from outside.
 One captured Vietcong said that his entire
 company had recently been supplied with
 modern Chinese weapons.  .A Vietcong arms
 cahe contained recoilless rifles and ammuni-
 tion, carbines, detonating fuses, 110 pounds
 of TNT, fuses for mortar shells, and other
 arms.  Their identifiable sources were: North
 Vietnam, Red China, East Germany, and
 Hungary.
 Another massive cache was seized last
 week.  Included in the capture were 1,000
 Russian-made carbines,  900  Red  Chinese
 rifles, several hundred Soviet submachine-
 guns, antiaircraft guns, recoilless rifles, and
 grenades.
 Supposedly the source of manufacture of
 these weapons is to be obliterated.  Cap-
 tured documents reveal instructions from
 Hanoi directing the infiltrators to remove
 all markings from their munitions.    The
 infiltrators themselves start out from near
 Hanoi in North Vietnamese uniforms and
 change into South Vietnamese uniforms at
 the frontier.
 The admission: Hanoi has officially de-
 clared that its army Is the instrument of
 the class struggle to liberate South Viet-
 nam.  It has said that it Is the brain and
 the factor that decides.
 The thanks:  The Vietcong have several
 times thanked Hanoi for its armed support.
 No deviation: The Vietcong Communists
 have never once deviated from the Hanoi
 party line.
 This is the evidence that caused the three-
 nation  International  Control  Commission
 (India, Canada, with Communist Poland dis-
 senting) to report that "beyond any reason-
 able doubt North Vietnam, has sent arms and
 men into South Vietnam with the aim of
 overthrowing the legal government."
 This is the evidence that has caused the
 United States to conclude that the Hanoi
 regime is In full strategic control of every
 action by the Vietcong and is providing the
 major share of its equipment and supplies.

 PARTIAL TEXT OF THE U.S. WHITE PAPER ON
 VIETNAM
 (Following is a partial text of the State
 Department's white paper on Vietnam.)
 South  Vietnam  is  fighting  for  its  life
 against a brutal campaign of terror and
 armed  attack  inspired, directed,  supplied
 and controlled by the Communist regime
 in Hanoi.  This flagrant aggression has been
 going on for years, but recently the pace
 has quickened and the threat has now be-
 come acute.
 The war in Vietnam is a new kind of war,
 a fact as yet poorly understood in most parts
 of the world.  Much of the confusion that
 prevails in the thinking of many people,
 and even many governments, stems from
 this basic misunderstanding.  For in Viet-
 nam, a totally new brand of aggression has
 been loosed against an Independent people
 who want to make their own way in peace
 and freedom.
 In Vietnam, a Communist government has
 set out deliberately to conquer a sovereign
 people  in  a  neighboring  state.  And  to
 achieve its end, It has .used every resource
 of its own government to carry out its care-
 fully planned program of concealed aggres-
 sion.  North Vietnam's commitment to seize
 control of the south is no less total than was
 the  commitment of the  regime  in North
 Korea in  1950.   But knowing the  conse-
 quences of the latter's undisguised attack,
 the planners in Hanoi have tried desperately
 to conceal their hand.  They have failed,
 and their aggression is as real as that of an
 invading army.
 This report is a summary of the massive
 evidence of North Vietnamese aggression ob-
 tained by the Government of South Vietnam.
 This evidence has been jointly analyzed by
 South Vietnamese and American experts.
 THE EVIDENCE
 The evidence shows that the hard core of
 the Communist forces attacking South Viet-
 nam were trained in the North and ordered
 into the South by Hanoi.  It shows that the
 key leadership of the Vietcong, the officers
 and much of the cadre, many of the tech-
 nicians, political organizers and propagan-
 dists have come from the North and operate
 under Hanoi's direction.  It shows that the
 training of essential military personnel and
 their infiltration into the South is directed
 by the military high command in Hanoi.
 The evidence shows that many of the
 weapons and much of the ammunition and
 other supplies used by the Vietcong have
 been sent into South Vietnam from Hanoi.
 In recent months, new types of weapons have
 been introduced in the Vietcong Army for
 which all ammunition must come from out-
 side sources.  Communist China and other
 Communist states' ammunition have been
 primarily channeled through North Vietnam.
 The hard core of the Communist forces
 attacking South Vietnam are men trained in
 North Vietnam.  They are ordered into the
 South and remain under the military disci-
 pline of the military command in Hanoi.
 Special training camps operated by the North
 Vietnamese Army give political and military
 training to the infiltrators.  Increasingly the
 forces sent into the South are native North
 Vietnamese who have never seen South Viet-
 nam.
 White paper text
 The infiltration rate has been increasing.
 Fron ,1959 to 1960, when Hanoi was establish-
 lag: its infiltration pipeline, at least 1,800
 men and probably 2,700 more moved into
 South Vietnam from the North.  The flow
 increased to a minimum of 3,700 In 1961 and
 at least 5,400 in 1962.  There was a modest
 decrease in 1963 to 4,200 confirmed infiltra-
 tors, though later evidence is likely to raise
 this figure.
 MORE THAN 7,400 IN  1964
 For 1964, the evidence is still Incomplete.
 However, it already shows that a minimum
 of 4,400 infiltrators entered the South and
 more than 3,000 others probably were sent in.
 There is usually a time lag between the
 entry of infiltrating troops and the discovery
 of clear evidence they have entered.  This
 fact plus collateral evidence of increased use
 of the  infiltration routes suggest strongly
 that 1964 was probably the year of greatest
 infiltration so far.
 Thus, since 1959, nearly 20,000 Vietcong
 officers, soldiers, and technicians are known
 to have entered South Vietnam under orders
 from Hanoi.  Additional information indi-
 cates that probably 17,000 more infiltrators
 were dispatched to the South by the regime
 in Hanoi during the past 6 years.  It can
 reasonably be assumed that still other in-
 filtration groups have entered the South for
 which there is no evidence yet available.
 It is now estimated  that the Vietcong
 number approximately 35,000 so-called hard-
 core forces, and another 60,000 to 80,000 local
 forces.  It is thus apparent that infiltrators
 from the North-allowing for casualties-
 make up the majority, and probably the
 overwhelming porportion, of the so-called
 hard-core  Vietcong.  Personnel  from  the
 North, in short, are now and have always
 been the backbone of the entire Vietcong
 operation.
 CASE HISTORIES
 Following are individual case histories of
 North Vietnamese soldiers sent by the Hanoi.
 regime into South Vietnam.  They are only
 an illustrative group.  They show that the
 leadership and specialized personnel for the
 guerrilla war in South Vietnam consists in
 large part of members of the North Vietnam
 armed forces trained in the North and sub-,
 ject to the command and discipline of Hanoi.
 Dan was a Vietcong major, commander of
 the   60th   Battalion,   Disillusioned   with
 fighting his countrymen and with commu-
 nism and the lies of the Hanoi regime, he
 surrendered to the authorities in South Viet-
 nam on February 11, 1963.
 At the age of 15 he joined the revolu-
 tionary  army   (Vietminh)   and  fought
 against the French forces until 1954 when
 the Geneva accords ended the Indochina
 war.  As a regular in the Vietminh forces,
 he was moved to North Vietnam. He be-
 came an officer in the so-called People's
 Army.
 In March 1962, Major Dan received orders
 to prepare to move to South Vietnam.  He
 had been exposed to massive propaganda in.
 the North which told of the destitution of
 the peasants in the Souh and said that the
 Americans had taken over the French role
 of colonialists.  He said later that an im-
 portant reason for his decision to surrender
 was that he discovered these propaganda
 themes were lies.  He found the peasants
 more prosperous than the people In the
 North.  And he recognized quickly that he
 was not fighting the Americans but his own
 people.
 With the women of his unit, Major Dan
 left Hanoi on March 23, 1962.  They traveled
 through the Laos corridor.  His group joined
 up  with  the  Vietcong  first regiment  irn
 Central Vietnam.
 The 35-year-old major took part in 45 ac-
 tions, and was wounded once in an unsuc-
 cessful Vietcong attack on an outpost.                                                                                                                                       As
 time passed, be became increasingly discour-
 aged by his experience as a troop commander
 of the Vietcong.  Most of all, he said, he was

 derground had never received any out-
 side help because the Burmese Govern-
 ment had not itself asked for any outside
 help in fighting the Communists.  "Not
 one precious American life has been lost
 in Burma," he was quoted as saying.
 "Not one precious American dollar has
 been spent in Burma in the form of mili-
 tary assistance in the last 17 years."
 Is it not strange that Mr. U Thant
 had no words of condemnation against
 North Vietnam for its acts of aggression?
 Why did he not condemn the violations
 by North Vietnam of the Geneva pacts
 of 1954 and 1962?  Just because his own
 government in Burma did not seek mili-
 tary assistance from the United States,
 does he deny the right under the SEATO
 treaty, of South Vietnam to ask the
 United States for help against Commu-
 nist subversion?  Does he deny that the
 Communists in Burma, in South Viet-
 nam, in Cuba, are controlled by Peiping
 or the Kremlin? Do his statements
 sound like those of a representative of
 the United Nations, whose charter says:
 We the peoples of the United Nations
 [are] determined to establish conditions un-
 der which justice and respect for the obli-
 gations  arising  from  treaties  and  other
 sources of international law can be main-
 tained.
 And for these ends to practice tolerance
 and live together in peace with one another
 as good neighbors.
 Does Mr. U Thant believe that North
 Vietnam has been acting like a "good
 neighbor"?
 I invite attention that the Geneva
 agreement of 1954 provided among other
 things as follows:
 Article 5. To avoid. any incidents which
 might result in the. resumption of hostilities,
 all military forces, supplies, and equipment
 shall be withdrawn from the demilitarized
 zone within 25 days of the present agree-
 ment's entry into force.
 Article 6. No person, military or civilian,
 shall be permitted to cross the provisional
 military demarcation line unless, specifically
 authorized to do so by the Joint Commis-
 sion.
 Article 17, (a) With effect from the date
 of entry into force of the present agree-
 ment, the introduction into Vietnam of any
 reinforcements in the form of all types
 of arms, munitions, and other war material,
 such as combat aircraft, naval craft, pieces
 of ordnance, jet engines and jet weapons
 and armored vehicles, is prohibited.
 I invite , attention that the Geneva
 agreement of 1962 provided among other
 things as follows:
 The parties undertake that:
 (a) they will not commit or participate
 in any way in any act which might directly
 or indirectly impair the sovereignty, inde-
 pendence, neutrality,. unity or territorial in-
 tegrity of the Kingdom of Laos;  (b)  they
 will not resort to the use. or threat of force
 or any other measure which might impair the
 peace of the Kingdom of Loas; (c) they will
 refrain from all direct or indircet interfer-
 ence in the internal affairs of the Kingdom
 of Laos; * * ? (i)  they will not use the
 territory of the Kingdom of Laos for inter-
 ference in the  internal, affairs  of other
 countries.
 I note' from the World News Digest
 that last July 8, Mr. U Thant proposed
 reconvening the 1954 Geneva Confer-
 ence to negotiate an end to the war in
 Vietnam. What good does he think this
 world do when North Vietnam has vio-
 lated the Geneva accords of 1954 and
 1962?
 On last August 6, following a confer-
 ence with President Johnson, Mr. U
 Thant told reporters that he believed
 the UN Security Council was currently
 in no position to be "usefully employed
 in a settlement" of the problem, being
 hampered by the nature of the dispute
 and by the fact that Hanoi is not a
 member of the UN.
 With respect to Mr. U Thant's state-
 ment, "Not one precious American dol-
 lar has been spent in Burma in the form
 of military assistance in the last 17
 years," I note from the February 24 is-
 sue of the Davenport, Iowa, Times-
 Democrat that the Allen and Scott Re-
 port refers to a secret $9 million arms
 program furnished by the United States
 to Burma; and, I might add, for fiscal
 year 1964 we furnished $1.5 million in
 foreign aid of a nonmilitary nature.
 I find Mr. U Thant's behavior one-
 sided, prejudiced, ungrateful, superfi-
 cial, and unrealistic. How can he com-
 mand the trust and respect so necessary
 for the performance of his duties?  He
 should resign.
 Let me remind Senators that last Au-
 gust 7, by a vote of 88 to 2, the Senate
 passed the southeast Asia resolution,
 following the retaliatory raids on North
 Vietnamese PT boat bases ordered by
 President Johnson as a result of attacks
 on our destroyers in the Bay of Tonkin.
 This resolution was approved without a
 single negative vote in the House of
 Representatives.
 It states:
 That the Congress approves and supports
 the determination of the President, as Com-
 mander in Chief, to take all necessary meas-
 ures to repel any armed attack against the
 forces of the United States and to prevent
 further aggression.
 The United States regards as vital to its
 national interest and to world peace the
 maintenance of international peace and se-
 curity in southeast Asia.  Consonant with
 the Constitution of the United States and
 the Charter of the United Nations and in
 accordance with its obligations under the
 Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, the
 United States is, therefore, prepared, as the
 President determines, to take' all necessary
 steps, including the use of armed force, to
 assist any member or protocol state of the
 Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty re-
 questing assistance in defense of its freedom.
 I do not criticize the sincerity of my
 two colleagues who voted against this
 resolution; and their continued criticism
 is completely consistent with their vote
 at that time. But what I am wondering
 about are the statements of some of
 those Senators who voted for this resolu-
 tion which, in light of the evidence,
 hardly represent support for the Presi-
 dent in his action to put a stop to Com-
 munist aggression in South Vietnam. It
 is these statements which might collec-
 tively be interpreted by Hanoi as a "sign"
 that the United States is not going to be
 as steadfast in pursuing the President's
 policy as we must be. We simply cannot
 be inconsistent about this matter.
 It will not do to contend that we are
 following the wrong course of action just
 because there are frequent changes in the
 Government of South Vietnam.  Our
 previous policy of accommodation has
 contributed to this. When we were asked
 for help to stop Communist aggression,
 it would be only natural that the South
 Vietnamese expected that help to be ef-
 fective,.. It was not effective, and one
 cannot blame the people for becoming
 disillusioned.  Ambassador Taylor's in-
 dication that the morale of the people
 improved following our attacks on North
 Vietnam bears out this point.  These
 people wish to be left alone, but if they
 are not left alone by North Vietnam, and
 if it appears that the United States is not
 going to take sufficient action to put a
 stop to it that the Vietcong will win, it is
 understandable why a good many of
 these troubled people would wish to be
 on the side of the winner.  Costly air-
 strikes against the privileged sanctuary
 of North Vietnam have been designed to
 persuade Hanoi that we mean business,
 and if aggression continues, more of the
 same can be expected.  Hanoi must be
 persuaded that any gain from continued
 aggression will be more than offset by
 its losses. No one in the Pentagon whom
 I know is saying that airstrikes against
 guerrillas will stop them. But there are
 other targets besides guerrillas.  They
 may have to be destroyed before the cost
 of continued aggression is brought home
 to the Communist regime in Hanoi.
 In the final analysis, the war in Viet-
 nam is a test of the wills of the people of
 the United States and those of the Com-
 munist world, particularly in Hanoi and
 Peiping, as of the moment.  The moral
 fiber, the character, the patience of our
 people to break the Communist will to
 win in this area are involved. Ours is a
 truly moral cause-completely in con-
 sonance with the Charter of the United
 Nations and the principles which have
 caused millions of freedom-loving people
 to turn to the United States for leader-
 ship in the cause of peace with justice
 and respect for the dignity of man. We
 must not fail to provide this leadership.
 Let me say, in behalf of our President,
 that great leadership does not always
 mean  the  most  popular  leadership.
 What is important is the righteousness
 of the cause and the perseverance of a
 leader to see it through. Neville Cham-
 berlain was, undoubtedly, popular for the
 moment following the Munich agree-
 ment. Winston Churchill was not always
 popular, but he will go down in history
 as the finest leader the world has known
 in our time.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent'that the following be placed in the

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 of freedom and our continuing actions will
 be those which are justified and those that
 are made necessary by the continuing aggres-
 sion of others.
 These actions will be measured, and fitting,
 and adequate.  Our stamina, and the stam-
 ina of the American people, is equal to the
 task.
 On February 25, Secretary of State
 Dean Rusk issued a prepared statement
 amplifying the policy statement of the
 President.  The key points of this state-
 ment are as follows:
 1. The nations of southeast Asia have a
 right to live in peace, free from aggression
 directed against  them from outside their
 borders.  This is a point of vital importance
 to the safety and the very existence of a
 hundred smaller nations all over the world.
 2. North Vietnam, in callous disregard of
 the Geneva agreements of 1954 and 1962, has
 directed and supplied the essential military
 personnel and arms for this aggression, aimed
 at the imposition of a Communist regime by
 force.
 3. The position of the United States to-
 ward threats to the peace in southeast Asia
 has been made clear many times, going back
 to 1954, when President Eisenhower wrote
 to the President of South Vietnam that our
 offer of assistance was to enable South Viet-
 nam to maintain "a strong, viable state, ca-
 pable of resisting attempted subversion of
 aggression through military means."
 4. The key to peace in southeast Asia has
 been repeated over and over again.  It is the
 readiness of all in that area to live at peace
 and to leave their neighbors alone.  Those
 who are not leaving their neighbors alone
 know exactly what it means-the illegal in-
 filtration of military personnel and arms
 cannot be described as "leaving your neigh-
 bor alone."
 5 Compliance with the  Geneva agree-
 wary of the massive evidence estab-
 lishing North Vietnam's responsibility
 for the aggression against South Viet-
 nam---evidence which has been pre-
 sented to the International Control
 Commission.
 The "white paper" points out that the
 war in Vietnam-and note that it uses the
 word "war"-is a new kind of war; a
 totally new brand of aggression against
 an independent people who want to make
 their own way in peace and freedom; that
 a Communist government has set out
 deliberately to conquer a sovereign peo-
 ple in a neighboring state; that South
 Vietnam is fighting for its life against a
 brutal campaign of terror and armed
 attack inspired, directed, supplied, and
 controlled by the Communist regime in
 Hanoi-an aggression which has been
 going on for years.
 The evidence shows that the hard core
 of the Communist forces attacking South
 Vietnam was trained in North Vietnam
 and ordered into South Vietnam by Ha-
 noi; that the key leadership of the Viet-
 cong, the officers and much of the cadre,
 many of the technicians, political orga-
 nizers, and propagandists have come
 from North Vietnam and operate under
 Hanoi's direction; that the training of
 essential military personnel and their in-
 filtration into South Vietnam is directed

 th'    ant we may

 war materiel from Communist China and
 other Communist states has been chan-
 neled through North Vietnam for the
 Vietcong army.
 The evidence shows that these attack-
 ing forces remain under the military dis-
 cipline of Hanoi after they enter South
 Vietnam, and that increasingly the forces
 sent into South Vietnam are native North
 Vietnamese.
 The infiltration rate has been as fol-
 lows, and these are minimum figures:
 Year :                                  Minimum
 1959-60--------------------------- 1,800
 1961------------------------------- 3,700
 1962------------------------------ 5,400
 1963------------------------------- 4,200
 1964------------------------------ 4,400
 Thus, since 1959, nearly 20,000 Viet-
 cong officers, soldiers, and technicians
 are known to have entered South Viet-
 really is not reasonably firm, it would be
 misinterpreted by the Communists as a
 sign of weakness. That is what has hap-
 pened in Vietnam, and I am encouraged
 that the State Department has faced up
 to this fact.   Whether or not the air
 strikes on North Vietnam are indeed
 fitted to the aggression by the Viet-
 cong, only time will tell.  I hope that
 they are.   I am concerned that Hanoi
 may interpret this new policy of firmness
 as merely an interlude in what has been
 a policy of accommodation rather than
 a change in the policy of accommoda-
 tion.  If Hanoi misreads the policy in-
 tentions of our President and the Sec-
 retary of State, things will get worse be-
 fore they get better. More lives will be
 lost-American as well as Vietnamese.
 More devastation will come to North
 Vietnam, and probably to Hanoi itself.
 Concern is being expressed over the pos-
 sibility that Red China will send troops
 to North Vietnam and Laos for eventual
 use against South Vietnam.  I suggest
 that this possibility will be in direct pro-
 portion to our failure to continue a policy
 of firmness, as distinguished from a
 policy of accommodation.  That is why
 it is so important that not one sign of
 a return to the unfortunate accom-
 modation policy be shown; and it will
 not be shown as long as the present policy
 Ana while j, am on  is p
 trust that Peiping will understand that
 the privileged sanctuary policy which
 down with the bombs on Korean
 North Vietnam.
 I have not been particularly concerned
 over the reaction in some capitals to our
 change from a policy of accommoda-
 tion to one of firmness. After all, there
 has been general satisfaction to let the
 United States and South Vietnam bear
 almost all of the cost of repelling the
 aggression by North Vietnam. Too many
 of these capitals have long been follow-
 ing a policy of accommodation, ex-
 changing ambassadors with Red China,
 failing to pay their obligations to the
 United Nations, accepting our foreign
 aid, and influencing our foreign policy.
 Words like "peace," "negotiations," "set-
 tlement " and "restraint" are expedients
 which seem to blind them to the evidence
 ments of 1954 and 1962 can establish peace.
 6. What is still missing is any indication
 that Hanoi is prepared to stop doing what it
 is doing against its neighbors.  The absence
 of this crucial element affects the current
 discussion of negotiation.  A negotiation
 aimed at the acceptance or the confirmation
 of aggression is not possible.
 I repeat here today what I have said
 ever since our retaliatory air strikes
 against North Vietnam. I fully support
 President Johnson in his actions of firm-
 ness, and I fully support his policy state-
 ment of February 17 and the policy
 statement of Secretary Rusk to which I
 have just referred.
 I would go a step further than
 Indeed
 ,
 the Secretary and say that not only
 must Hanoi indicate that it is prepared
 to stop what it is doing to its neighbors
 in South Vietnam, but it must also bring
 back the many thousands of guerrillas
 and Infiltrators to North Vietnam, where
 they belong, before negotiations begin.
 This would not preclude a period of a
 truce during which these people, along
 with their war materiel, are pulled back
 to North Vietnam. Perhaps this is im-

 OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT JOHNSON ON
 VIETNAM
 We, as members of the academic com-
 munity, feel impelled to raise publicly with
 you, Mr. President, the question of our Gov-
 ernment's present policy toward South Viet-
 nam.  We ask you to reconsider our present
 course of action in view of the following
 facts:
 We are intervening unilaterally in support
 of a succession of undemocratic regimes that
 are opposed by a majority of the South Viet-
 namese people.
 We are waging an immoral and inhumane
 war that has brought untold suffering to the
 people of South Vietnam.
 Our .recent air attacks on North Vietnam
 intensify the danger that a local conflict will
 develop into a major war.
 It is maintained that the United States is
 protecting a popularly supporter government
 against foreign subversion.  We maintain,
 Mr. President, that the evidence available to
 the Congress and to the public does not sup-
 port this interpretation of the Vietnamese
 conflict.
 The fact is that the United States is main-
 taining regimes which are not supported by
 the bulk of the rural population.  How else
 explain a situation in which 35,000 Vietcong
 regulars have been able to make increasing
 gains against a Government army of over
 200,000 men together with 23,000 American
 "advisers"?  The close-range attacks on Bien-
 hoa and Pleiku indicate the lack of support
 by neighboring villagers for the Saigon gov-
 ernment.
 What has our policy meant for the people
 of South Vietnam?  Only a small minority
 of the people profits from the $600 million
 in foreign aid we send annually to South
 Vietnam.  The peasantry of Vietnam has
 been terrorized.  The country, once one of
 the most prosperous areas of southeast Asia,
 is being devastated by the napalm bombing
 of peasant villages, by the unbridled strafing
 of the countryside by American-supplied air-
 craft, by the detention and mass transfers
 of the South Vietnamese people.  Prisoners
 are being tortured in South Vietnam.    It
 does not seem likely that this could be done
 without the knowledge of American officials.
 What effect has our policy had on U.S.
 prestige abroad?  By supporting dictatorial
 military regimes in South Vietnam we have
 undermined confidence in our professed be-
 lief that nations should be allowed to develop
 their own destinies free from outside inter-
 ference.  Although we pledged to respect the
 Geneva accords of 1954, we have violated
 those agreements by supplying troops and
 weapons to South Vietnam.  We have belied
 our adherence to international law by re-
 fusing to submit the dispute to an interna-
 tional conference, such as the parties to the
 Geneva accords or one of the bodies of the
 United Nations.
 Our justification for intervention in South
 Vietnam _ has been that we are preventing
 the spread of communism in southeast Asia.
 The effect of our policy, however, has been

 to alienate both the neighboring countries
 and our allies.
 As recent events have shown, the longer
 the war in South Vietnam continues, the
 greater are the chances of escalation.  Our
 air and sea attacks upon North Vietnam have
 not appreciably altered the situation in the
 south, but they have succeeded in increasing
 the danger of a major conflagration on the
 continent of Asia and of nuclear war.
 When 81 percent of the American people,
 according to a recent Gallup poll, indicated
 they were In favor of a conference with the
 leaders of southeast Asia and China in an
 effort to reach a peace agreement, must we
 continue any longer along this dangerous
 path?
 Mr. President, we urge you to consider
 another course of action:
 We ask that you bring an end to the in-
 vestment of American men and money in the
 war in South Vietnam.
 We ask you to seek a negotiated settle-
 ment by every possible means in order to
 create an independent, neutralized govern.
 ment and to bring about the withdrawal of
 U.S. troops.
 We ask you to la the problem immediately
 before an international body and to put an
 end to our unilateral and illegal actions.
 We urge you, Mr. President, to take im-
 mediate action to end the war in South Viet-
 nam.  The longer we persist in our present
 policy, the fewer will be the alternatives open
 to us.

 Secretary McNamara, one of the most level-
 headed executives ever to boss the Pentagon,
 was mousetrapped when he got out of his
 sickbed to hold an emergency press con-
 ference ,and defended the 'American forces as
 victims of a "sneak attack."  Obviously he
 knew that some of the great military vic-
 tories of  American  histgry                          have  resulted
 from sneak attacks, as when George Wash-
 ington sneaked across the Delaware to sur-
 prise carousing Hessians in Trenton.                            Mc-
 NNmara also knew that his own men were
 being trained in the art of the sneak attack
 at the very time he held the news conference.
 Only on a few occasions have American
 troops telegraphed their attacks in advance,
 as when General Pickett sent a Confederate
 flag at the head of his troops in the famous
 charge at Gettysburg-a charge, incidentally,
 in which his defeat turned the tide of the

 McGeorge Bundy, therefore, joined Taylor
 in rushing back a premature, exaggerated
 account of the Pleiku'raid, the White House
 finally yielded to advice which the Bundy
 brothers had been giving for some time and
 which has now caused serious loss of Ameri-
 can prestige, demonstrations against Amer-
 ican embassies around the world, even in
 pro-West counties and eroded the better un
 derstanding Mr. Johnson had personally built
 up with the new leaders in the Kremlin.
 What the American public has a right to
 expect is a congressional investigation or
 the court-martial of American officers asleep
 at Pleiku.  The Pentagon alibi is that they
 are highly trained men who are not sup-
 posed to stand guard, which is correct.  But
 the fact remains that no one, not even South
 Vietnamese, was on guard and, as a result,
 approximately 100 wounded, and several mil-
 lion dollars worth of planes destroyed.

 UNITED STATES SHOULD GET OUT OF VIETNAM
 (By Drew Pearson)
 When     Senator Dion  RUSSELL  of  Georgia
 visited the LBJ ranch, to confer on Vietnam,
 right after the November elections, he re-
 marked:
 "We made a mistake in going in there, but
 I can't figure any way to get out without
 scaring the rest of the world."
 There are a lot of reasons to support Sen-
 ator RUSSELL as to why we should get out,

 the Chinese were hated and feared in this
 part of the world, Now It's the United States,

 is the  drain  on  the  American dollar,  as
 pointed out by R. V. Roosa, the man in
 charge of watching the dollar balance until
 he recently retired as Under Secretary of the
 Treasury.
 Finally,  there is the statement of Gen.
 Maxwell Taylor, the sincere, harassed Amer-
 ican Ambassador to South Vietnam: "Mili-
 tary action outside the country, just as pure
 military action inside the country, will not
 win."
 With all these factors supporting Senator
 RUSSELL, the question is how we get out.
 While I agree with the Senator from
 Georgia that the answer is not easy, there
 are certain factors putting President John-
 son in a stronger position than his predeces-
 sors.
 As Vice President, for instance, he was
 urging social reforms rather than military
 support for President Diem at the very time
 President Kennedy was beating the tomtoms
 for all-out intervention.
 Finally, the President knows as perhaps
 no other man that the United States has
 the power to destroy the world but not the
 power to make it obey us.  For the moment,
 though not for long, he leads from a certain
 amount of strength.  His retaliation against
 the north has put him in a stronger bargain-
 ing position.
 SOLUTION FOR VIETNAM
 He has, therefore, the following alterna-
 tives  for                                                                                                      getting out  of  the  Indochinese
 peninsula:
 1. He can do what President de Gaulle did
 in Algeria and pull American forces out with-
 out any face-saving formulas, but simply by
 admitting we made a mistake.  When De
 Gaulle did this he faced rebellion. in the
 French army and was almost assassinated.
 But France has been stronger, more prosper-
 ous, more respected ever since De Gaulle stop-
 ped the Algerian drain on French money
 -and manpower.
 2. The President can call for the fulfill-
 ment of the pledge signed at Geneva In 1954
 for an election on the unification of North
 and South Vietnam.  This election, was sup-
 posed to be held in 18 months.  It has not
 been held because it was known that the
 North Vietnamese would win, just as we
 know that in any German election on uni-
 fication the West Germans would win.
 However, we can't demand an election in
 Germany yet deny one in Indochina.  And
 even if the North Vietnamese do win, it
 doesn't necessarily mean the area will line up
 with the Chinese Communists. There's a lot
 of Titoism in southeast Asia.
 3. The President can tllrcyv the Vietna-
 mese problem into the arms of the,United
 Nations and thereby help to resuscitate that
 gasping organization.   A request that the
 Assembly settle Vietnam while simultane-
 ously demanding that only those nations
 which have paid their dues can vote would
 put the Russian and French nonpayers in
 an extremely awkward position.
 Once before when Russia absented itself
 from the U.N. the Korean crisis came before
 the Assembly.  Russia doesn't want to make
 that mistake again.  Certainly, if so vital a
 problem as Indochina came before the U.N.,
 which we have always kept away from the
 U.N. in the past, the Communist bloc na-
 tions could not afford to be sitting on the
 sidelines.

 of scaring the other nations of the Pacific

 VIETNAM    FALLACIES-JOHNSON    INHERITED
 SITUATION  IN  WHICH  UNITED  STATES  IN-
 STEAD OF FRANCE IS IN TROUBLE
 (By Drew Pearson)
 There are three important fallacies to be
 considered  regarding  the  Vietnam crisis
 which President Johnson inherited.
 1. We contend that we are in South Viet-
 nam at the request of the popular govern-
 ment,                                                                                                                                    to          protect  freedom.  This  is  pure
 bunk.  The  government  has  changed   so
 often that no one can keep track of whether
 Big Minh, Little Minh, or Minnie Mouse is
 in, power.  There have been 14 changes of
 government since January 30, 1964, which
 is an average of one government per month.
 The government is of the military, by the
 military, and for the military, and Vietna-
 mese civilians have no illusions about it.
 2. We believe that the best way to stop
 Vietnamese fighting is by retaliatory raids
 against the north.  There are many indica-
 tions that this also is pure bunk.  First, the
 North Vietnamese are led by Ho Chi Minh,
 a tough guerrilla fighter who battled against
 the French for 8 years and defeated the
 cream of the French Army, totaling 380,000
 men,  backed  by  $4  billion  of American
 money.  Ho now has an army of 270,000 men
 and if he wants to move south our bombing
 raids would never be able to halt him. His-
 tory shows airplanes cannot find troops on
 foot in the jungle.
 However,  it is highly doubtful that Ho
 could call off the Vietcong war against us in
 South Vietnam even if he wanted to. You
 have to remember that the Vietcong were
 part of the force that also fought for 8 years,
 with implacable will, to get the French out
 of Indochina, and we have merely substi-
 tuted ourselves for the French.     The Viet-
 cong are equally determined today to get all
 white men out.
 After  the  French  evacuated Indochina
 under the terms of the 1954 Geneva agree-
 ment, there were approximately 90,000 Viet
 Minh pro-Communists guerrilla fighters left.
 They became the Vietcong.  Already tough
 revolutionaries, they are now doubly effective
 because they have seized new, modern Amer-
 ican arms.
 American intelligence shows that very few
 of the Vietcong infiltrated down from the
 North until last year. It is estimated that in
 1964 between 4,000 and 5,000 men moved in.
 Therefore, Ho Chi Minh would have little
 control over them, even if he wanted to yell
 "uncle" as a result of the U,S. retaliatory
 raids.
 Our intelligence also shows that the Viet-
 cong is composed of about 35,000 hard-core
 fighters, plus 65,000 militiamen-a total of
 about 100,000.  This is enough, given support
 from the countryside, to engage in hit-and-
 run operations indefinitely.
 3. The United States has told our allies
 privately that we are ready to negotiate a
 settlement in Indochina but that we want
 to negotiate from strength.  Unfortunately,
 the longer we remain in South Vietnam the
 more our strength deteriorates.
 When we had 1,000 American advisers in
 Vietnam, as in the early days of the Eisen-
 hower  administration,  we                                                                                                                                            were  probably

 ideological and military coalition.  But our
 policy in Vietnam is producing exactly the
 effect we seek to avoid. Nothing that has
 i. append since the original rupture between
 the two major Communist powers has done
 more to bring the Soviet Union and Commu-
 nist China together again than recent Amer-
 ican actions in Vietnam.    The Communist
 Chinese have long argued that the Russian
 idea of coexistence was an anti-Marxist and
 ant historical notion that could only be ad-
 vanced by naive sentimentalists. They claim
 war is inevitable because of the nature of
 capitalism.  As evidence, they assert that the
 United States, despite its claim that it sought
 only to promote the  internal stability of
 Indochina,   was  actually pursuing  a  war
 against Asian peoples as an extension of the
 very imperialism Asians had fought so hard
 to expel.  The Soviet Union, which is no less
 concerned than the United States about Chi-
 nese expansion throughout Asia, also has to
 be concerned about its standing in the world
 Communist community.  It cannot allow it-
 self to appear indifferent to military action
 involving a member of that community.
 Any expansion of the war by the United
 States into North Vietnam would force the
 Soviet Union to identify itself with North
 Vietnam and thus with China. In any event,
 in pursuit of one goal the United States ap-
 pears to be losing a larger one.  If the Com-
 munist Chinese had deliberately set a trap
 for the United Sttaes, they could not have
 more effectively achieved the result they
 sought.
 The fifth fact is that American newsmen
 have had a more difficult time in getting
 unmanipulated news out of Vietnam than
 out of almost any crisis center in recent
 years.  James Reston, associate editor of the
 New York Times, testifying before a congres-
 sional investigating committee in 1963, said
 the news in Vietnam was being managed in
 a way inconsistent with the traditions of this
 society.  In the past 2 years there has been
 some improvement in news policy on Viet-
 nam but the American public has yet to be
 fully informed about the nature of the Amer-
 ican involvement, the degree to which U.S.
 arms have been sustaining the attackers, the
 extent of the popular opposition, and the in-
 ability of the South Vietnam Government to
 mount  an  effective  response  against  the
 guerrillas.
 The sixth fact is that President Johnson
 has genuinely tried to keep the military lid
 on in Vietnam, recognizing the ease with
 which the hostilities could mushroom into a
 general war; but he has been under extrava-
 grant pressure, much of its political, to trans-
 late American military power Into a dramatic
 solution.  The  national frustration  about
 Vietnam has far exceeded the national com-
 prehension of the problem, for much of which
 the Government has only itself to blame. In
 any event, there has been comparatively lit-
 tle counterpressure in support of a policy of
 restraint and an eventual nonmilitary set-
 tlement-a failing that the American people
 have It within their means to change when-
 ever they wish to do so.
 The United States is concerned, and prop-
 erly so, that the loss of South Vietnam would
 lead to grave consequences-territorial, polit-
 ical, psychological-throughout Asia and in-
 deed most of the world.  Already, the fact
 of developing atomic power in China has
 made a deep impression on many nations
 whose histories have pitted them against
 Western outsiders.  American policymakers
 fear that United States withdrawal from
 Vietnam or even a reluctance to press the
 war would weaken or destroy the image of
 the United States as a resolute, dependable,
 and successful foe of aggressive communism
 in the world.  These are not illogical or non-
 historical fears, but it Is equally logical and
 historical to raise questions about the dam-
 aged image of the United States that is em-
 erging from the present actions in Vietnam.
 There has been an outpouring of anti-Amer-
 ican sentiment not just in Asia but through-
 out the world-and it would be a mistake
 to charge it all to Communist manipulation
 or propaganda.  Even among our friends in
 France, Great Britain, and West Germany
 there has been a sense of shock and outrage.
 If we thought we were building prestige by
 taking to the air and dropping bombs in
 Vietnam, we have built strangely indeed.
 It is tragic that most of the debate over
 Vietnam has vibrated between total war and
 total withdrawal.  It is made to appear that
 the only choice Is between absolute victory
 and absolute defeat.  There is an alterna-
 tive-if our main objective is to promote the
 stability and security of the area.  And that
 alternative is to Involve the United Nations,
 with all its limitations, to the fullest pos-
 sible extent.  Any general war growing out
 of the combustibles in Vietnam would bring
 Catastrophe to most of the world's peoples.
 On the principle of no extermination with
 out representation, they have a right to ask
 that they be consulted now, while there may
 yet be time.
 The situation in Vietnam is far more com-
 plicated than it was in Korea, but no one
 can say that no good can come out of a U.N.
 effort  similar  to  one  existing  in  Korea.
 Korea has had numerous truce violations and
 difficulties, but because of the U.N., Korea at
 least is not aflame today.   Secretary General
 U Thant has provided an opening for such
 an effort by calling not just for restraint but
 for "shifting the quest for a solution away
 from the field of battle to the conference
 table."  To the extent that the United Na-
 tions could be brought into this quest, the
 chances for a constructive outcome will be
 increased.
 There are no easy answers to Vietnam.
 But some answers may be less volatile and
 more   morally  imaginative  than  others.
 Moreover,  at some  time  soon the United
 States will have to recognize that a military
 policy without a full ideological and social
 program will not only fall short of its goal
 but may actually boomerang.    In any case,
 the prospectfor finding a workable answer to
 Vietnam will increase, not decrease; in direct
 proportion to the unblocking of an Ameri-
 can conscience and the activation of an
 informed debate.-N.C.
 [From the New York Times, Feb. 28, 1985]
 STORM SIGNALS  OVER ASIA
 The 'Johnson administration seems to be
 conditioning  the  American                      people  for  a
 drastic expansion of our involvement in
 Vietnam.                            The  State   Department's white
 paper accuses North Vitnam of intensified ag-
 gression and stresses that military efforts
 aimed solely at the Vietcong guerrillas in the
 south no longer suffice.
 The logic of all this is that the United
 States, which only last week moved from the
 role of "adviser" to active and undisguised
 combatant in South Vietnam, now feels free
 to strike at will-whether by air, sea or
 land-at any targets it chooses in North Viet-
 nam.  In  the  3  tense  weeks  since  the
 Vietcong attack on Pleiku, American policy
 has plunged dangerously beyond the one
 enunciated then by the President and Secre-
 tary McNamara of limiting ourselves to re-
 taliatory action and shunning a wider war.
 And what has happened to alter our policy?
 The assertion that North Vietnam is a prin-
 cipal supplier of men and munitions to the
 Vietcong is certainly not new, nor is the
 charge that the extent of its support is
 increasing.  Such activity by Hanoi consti-
 tutes the sole reason for our being in South
 Vietnam, and has since the United States
 moved in the vacuum left by the French
 withdrawal in 1954.
 Apparently, the major new evidence of a
 need for escalating the war, with all the
 hazard that this entails, was provided by
 the sinking in a South Vietnamese cove
 earlier this month of a 100-ton cargo ship
 loaded with Communist-made small  arms
 and ammunition.  A ship of that size is not
 much above the oriental junk class, The
 standard Liberty or Victory ship of World
 War II had a capacity of 7,150 to 7,650 tons.
 Page after page of similarly minuscule de-
 tail about Communist infiltration from the
 north merely raise anew  the question of
 whether massive air strikes would accom-
 plish  anything  except  large-scale  civilian
 casualties in industrial centers and ports.
 The question is made sharper by the ab-
 sence of any stable government in Saigon
 to fight or even to speak in the name of
 the South Vietnamese people.
 Communist China, the nation whose im-
 perialist ambitions the world has most to
 worry about, will be a clear gainer from the
 ill timing and judgment of our warning to
 North Vietnam.  It comes just as the Soviet
 Union is about to begin an international
 meeting of Communist parties in Moscow-a
 meeting originally called to pronounce Peip-
 ing                                                                                                                          a  renegade  from  Marxist-Leninism.
 Washington is now doing precisely what that
 most   sophisticated   of Kremlinologists,
 George F. Kennan, former U.B. Ambassador
 to Moscow, cautioned against in his Senate
 testimony Friday: Forcing the Soviet Union
 to come down on the side of Communist
 China.
 Washington and Peiping are in bizarre tan-
 dem as the only major capitals in the free
 or Communist worlds openly resistant to
 seeking a negotiated settlement of the Viet-
 namese conflict now.  It is not too late for
 the President to make it plain that the
 United States is ready to talk as well as fight,
 and thus leave China isolated as the ob-
 structor of any attempt to achieve a sound
 and enforcible peace.

 PLEIKU ATTACK NOT A HANOI PLOT
 (By Drew Pearson)
 Shortly after the Vietcong raid on Pleiku
 that caused the United States to retaliate
 with its first definite large-scale bombing
 raids on North Vietnam, this column reported
 that the United  States had been mouse-
 trapped and that the Pleiku attack was the
 result of a Chinese or North Vietnamese
 plot deliberately staged while Premier Kosy-
 gin was visiting Hanoi.
 More complete information, now available
 from the battlefront, shows this column was
 in error.  The Vietcong attack was staged
 by a bedraggled handful of 100 men, or half
 a company, which was able to achieve success
 only because of sheer stupidity and lack of
 alertness by the Americans and the South
 Vietnamese. The attackers had no idea that
 they would be able to penetrate to the very
 center of the American installation as they
 did.
 That it was no Hanoi-conceived plot is ob-
 vious from the fact that Hanoi could not have
 planned to have all South Vietnamese per-
 sonnel and all Americans asleep.
 A little band of Vietcong passed through
 two villages before reaching Pleiku.   The
 South Vietnamese in the villages are sup-

 the barbed wire around Pleiku completely

 completely unguarded. They retreated with-
 out an American  or a South Vietnamese

 There were some Vietcong casualties, but
 only from their own mortar fire.  Their com-
 mander had never expected them to penetrate
 so far inside, therefore aimed mortars into
 the center of the American installation-an-

 ammunition and other supplies used by the
 Vietcong, have been sent from North to
 South Vietnam
 Seventh, the scale of infiltration of rpen
 and arms, including regular units of the
 Armed Forces of North Vietnam, has in-
 creased appreciably in recent months.
 Eighth, this entire pattern of activity by
 the regime in Hanoi is in violation of gen-
 eral principles of international law and the
 Charter of the United Nations, and is in di-
 rect violation of the Geneva accord of 1954.
 Such a pattern of violation of the treaty ob-
 ligations  undertaken at Geneva was  con-
 firmed by a special report of the Interna-
 tional. Control Commission in 1962 and it
 has been greatly intensified since then.
 These facts about the situation in Viet-
 nam make it ,unmistakably clear that the
 character of that conflict is an aggressive war
 of conquest waged against a neighbor-and
 makes nonsense of the cynical allegation
 that this is simply an indigenous insurrec-
 tion.
 I request that you circulate copies of the
 report, together with copies of this letter,
 to the, delegations of all member states as a
 Security Council document.
 In making this Information available to
 the Security Council, my Government wishes
 to say once more that peace can be restored
 quickly to Vietnam by a prompt and assured
 cessation of aggression by Hanoi against the
 Republic of Vietnam.  In that event, my
 Government-as it has said many times be-
 fore, would be happy to withdraw its mili-
 tary forces from the Republic of Vietnam
 and turn promptly to an international effort
 to assist the economic and social develop-
 ment of southeast Asia.
 In the meantime, my Government awaits
 the first indication of any intent by the
 Government in Hanoi to return to the ways
 of peace and peaceful resolution of this in-
 ternational conflict.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, I
 should like to read to the Senate the con-
 cluding sentences of Mr. Stevenson.
 They are very brief; it seems to me they
 state something which has not been ex-
 pressed to the world:

 Mr. CANNON.  Mr. President, will the
 Mr. PROXMIRE.. I am happy to yield
 to the distinguished Senator from Ne-
 vada.
 Mr.  CANNON. I congratulate  the
 Senator from Wisconsin for a very fine
 and excellent outline of our goals in
 South Vietnam and what we have been
 trying to do to assist the people of South
 Vietnam.
 Most important of all, the fact is that
 all we desire is peace, an end to the fight-
 ing and terror in South Vietnam, and the
 preservation of the freedom of the South
 Vietnamese people or any other people to
 make their own determination as to the
 kind of government under which they
 wish to live.  I agree with the distin-
 guished Senator from Wisconsin that this
 is no time to talk about negotiation, be-
 cause even a discussion of the possibility
 of negotiation leads our allies to believe
 that we perhaps are getting into a
 position of thinking about abandoning
 them and to pull out of southeast Asia.
 In my opinion, if we were to pull out of
 South Vietnam and, in effect, turn over
 all of southeast Asia to communism, it
 would certainly constitute surrender.
 I again congratulate the Senator for a
 very fine outline and a very fine speech
 on the subject.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, I
 thank the distinguished Senator from
 Nevada very much. I deeply appreciate
 his supporting statment.
 Mr. SCOTT.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. PROXMIRE, I am happy to yield
 to the distinguished Senator from Penn-
 sylvania.
 Mr. SCOTT.  While I did not hear the
 distinguished Senator from Wisconsin
 deliver his speech, I have had an oppor-
 tunity to read a considerable portion of
 it. I commend the Senator from Wiscon-
 sin, not only for his forthright approach,
 but also the fact that he has clarified the
 big question which people frequently ask.
 That is, Why are we in South Vietnam?
 The questitul has been asked of me by
 any number of pepole. The Senator's
 speech helps greatly to answer the ques-
 tion.                                                        I have discussed the subject with
 the President.  I have had the benefit of
 the most candid kind of briefing. For the
 first time in my experience, the present
 President of the United States not only
 gave us,a briefing, but invited questions,
 which he offered to answer himself.  I
 think this is better than the equivalent
 of the British system, under which there
 is a question period on the floor of Par-
 liament.  We were not only compli-
 mented by that procedure, but we were
 immensely helped, because we posed to
 the President rather pointed questions
 and we received answers with which I
 found myself in agreement.
 The President has made it perfectly
 clear-and I am referring, now, not to
 brieflings but to public statements-that
 he intends to stay in North Vietnam until
 our responsibilities and objectives have
 been achieved.
 As the Senator from Wisconsin him-
 self has said in his speech, we seek
 nothing of material advantage. We are
 there at great sacrifice. Our future poli-
 cies there must be not only to preserve
 our commitment but to seek in every way
 we can to reduce casualties. In my con-
 sidered judgment-and I ask the Sena-
 tor if he agrees with it-the surest Way
 to reduce casualties in South Vietnam is
 not to negotiate from weakness, which
 is not. to say that we may in the future
 be in a 'position to negotiate from
 strength, should the aggressor at some
 point sue for it.   To negotiate from
 weakness would merely transfer the war
 from South Vietnam to Thailand, which
 the CotnmunisttS hAve .alreally indicated
 is next on their list, a country which has
 been independent for a thousand years,
 a country which has never been occupied
 3,711
 colonially. If Thailand goes and Burma
 goes, and if India comes under the guns,
 the question seems to me to be, When
 do we stop running?
 I do not believe the American people
 are yet aware that if we withdraw from
 southeast Asia, the Communists would
 not give up a single objective, which is
 to expand their empire-their material-
 istic, imperialistic empire-to include all
 of the islands, including the fifth largest
 country in the world, Indonesia.  If
 that happened, the 7th Fleet would in
 time retreat.  We would be faced with
 the loss of Okinawa.  Under those cir-
 cumstances, we would have to move our
 fleet from the area of Formosa and would
 cease to be a Pacific power.  We would
 then have left the world in a state of
 the most dangerous imbalance in all his-
 tory, certainly in all modern history. We
 would then be forced back upon Guam,
 as our farthest outpost, and the Hawai-
 ian Islands.
 The President has strongly indicated
 that arguments urging that we withdraw
 from Vietnam at a time when we are in
 the worst possible position for negotia-
 tion have increased, and the diplomatic
 corps in Washington tell their nations
 at home that the President does not have
 the support of the Senate and the House
 of Representatives. They are wrong, but
 I know a number of those ambassadors,
 and I am aware of what they are saying.
 Does not the Senator from Wisconsin
 agree that eventually we shall have to
 come to a place where we shall have to
 stop running and stand and face this ag-
 gressor?
 Mr. PROXMIRE. I agree wholeheart-
 edly with the distinguished Senator from
 Pennsylvania. Also, I am most grateful
 to him, as I am sure the President i., for
 his graceful reference to the President's
 conferences and to his responding to
 questions.  I have also participated in
 those conferences.  They are most in-
 formative and helpful.
 The Senator from Pennsylvania is an
 outstanding leader of the Republican
 Party, and has been for many years. He
 speaks in a completely bipartisan sense
 when he says that we must recognize
 that if we do not stand in South Vietnam,
 we shall have to fight under worse con-
 ditions, under conditions in which we will
 have encouraged the Communists and on
 territory closer to home. We shall have
 to fight under conditions in which they
 will have been strengthened. Our dan-
 ger is increasingly this kind of subver-
 sive operation. _ The Communists have
 the opportunity to send infiltrators into
 Vietnam according to the new Commu-
 nist military strategy which Khrushchev
 and his successors have said is to be the
 wave of the future, so far as communism
 is concerned. They may not rely on nu-
 clear weapons; they will move with sub-
 version, terror, and violence. If they can
 achieve success in South Vietnam with
 this, we shall be in terrible danger.
 Mr. SCOTT.  Does not the Senator
 agree with me that certain things have
 happened which may demand the care-
 ful attention of the American people
 generally, in that we are moving now de-
 termined, at least, to improve our post-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE                  March. 1
 tion in South Vietnam?  The most im-
 portant thing that happened recently
 was the decision to use our planes in
 South Vietnam. Certainly this will save
 lives. It will save the lives of the South
 Vietnamese by protecting them from the
 people who have terorrized them. Also,
 by the use of new jet planes, we shall
 more successfully make a response to the
 rather damaging sorties of the enemy
 than we have heretofore.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  I agree.  It is one
 thing to have military power; it is some-
 thing else to be willing to use it.
 Mr. SCOTT.  Exactly.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  No  matter  how
 great our power may be, if the enemy
 thinks we are afraid to use it, that power
 counts as nothing. The fact that we
 have used it, used it in a limited way,
 used it responsibly, and have not tried to
 extend it in any broad way, but have
 confined it to military targets, has, I be-
 lieve, enhanced our position and greatly
 strengthened the position of the South
 Vietnamese.
 Mr. SCOTT. I have spoken with mem-
 bers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as well
 as with the President. Without any at-
 tempt to quote them, except as they have
 publicly confirmed some of the things
 they have said, they have answered to
 my satisfaction the common, rather un-
 thinking statement that the South Viet-
 namese people are not with us; that they
 want us out of their country.  Their
 reply has been quite to the contrary.
 I have said, for example, that some
 have argued that the Vietnamese are a
 good deal like the Laotian.  The Lao-_
 tian, it is argued, are like Ferdinand
 the Bull. They want to smell the flow-
 ers, have picnics, loll around the temples,
 and do things of that kind.  Whether
 that be true of the Laotian or not-and
 there is some evidence that some of that
 trait exists-these informed and quali-
 fied experts have said to me, first, that
 the South Vietnamese have some excel-
 lent fighting men, as do the North Viet-
 namese; that there is a trait or a quality
 of the Vietnamese which makes them
 good fighting men.
 In South Vietnam, hundreds of thou-
 sands have escaped from communism,
 have become refugees, have taken their
 lives and their future in their hands to
 defy communism, and are now living in
 South Vietnam.
 If we were to leave the country, we
 would turn over to the Communists all of
 those refugees who have "voted with
 their feet," as the saying goes; who by
 their actions have rendered themselves
 vulnerable to total annihilation by an
 enemy that knows that they are there.
 So how can we consider abandoning a
 nation which has opted for freedom, and
 whose people, in my opinion, except to the
 degree to which they have been terror-
 ized in the fields, as just as anti-Com-
 munist as we are, perhaps even more so?
 I think the maxim prevails that the
 closer one is to communism, the more he
 dislikes the possibility of having to par-
 ticipate in it.  I well recall the large
 numbers of Chinese and North Korean
 soldiers who defected from the Panmun-
 jom armistice Communists.
 It seems to me that we are reading
 the whole picture wrong in thinking that
 the Vietnamese do not want to fight, be-
 cause if we extrapolate, to use a State
 Department word-and I also know how
 to use "vis-a-vis"-the casualties sus-
 tained in Vietnam, North and South, re-
 lating their population to ours, would
 compare with about 325,000 people in the
 United States.  That is more than the
 number of casualties we sustained in the
 Korean war.
 It seems to me that not only would a
 nation that has been willing to fight on
 and on in the cause of freedom feel
 abandoned; but the word would get
 around through all of Asia and probably
 pretty well through Europe that the
 Americans are a "paper tiger"; that we
 make high-sounding statements; that we
 sign treaties, as we have with Thailand;
 that we are strong on promises and talk;
 but that whenever imperialism, that is
 the Communist menace-really presses
 us, we say we are no longer interested.
 Mao Tse-tung has predicted the same
 thing.  He said to a correspondent not
 long ago that the Americans will tire and
 give up. That is obviously what they are
 waiting for.
 I commend the Senator again.  I re-
 gret that I have taken up so much time.
 I thank the Senator for the opportunity
 he has given me--as well as for the
 excellence of his own statement-to show
 that the loyal opposition Is a responsible
 opposition.
 I have not criticized the President in
 this Congress in any way on any part of
 his present foreign policy. As a matter
 of fact, I have not yet criticized him for
 any part of his domestic policy. But I
 assume that in time I shall get around
 to that.
 I speak for every Republican Senator.
 We support the President and uphold
 him. We recognize that he has proceeded
 with dignity and discretion. But, so far
 as guaranteeing peace is concerned, we
 have not only the freedom of South Viet-
 nam to consider, but also the freedom of
 this country. I think that freedom, like
 peace, is indivisible.
 I thank the Senator.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, I
 thank the distinguished Senator from
 Pennsylvania.  I say once again that I
 deeply appreciate his superlative ex-
 pression of bipartisan support for the
 President's position.
 I know it makes a difference not only
 to President Johnson, but also to our
 forces in southeast Asia, that a leader of
 the Republican Party, who has freely
 criticized when he decides the policy is
 incorrect, is supporting the President.
 Senator  SCOTT  has demonstrated a
 great capacity for constructive and posi-
 tive criticism in the past.  He is very
 effective, sometimes too effective for our
 comfort.    But in this crisis, the great
 spokesman and statesman for the Repub-
 lican Party has expressed an unqualified
 and all-out support for the President's
 policy in South Vietnam.
 Mr. President, I yield the floor.
 Mr. SCOTT.  Mr. President, I thank
 the Senator.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, I have heard the speech of the Sen-
 ator from Wisconsin, and I have read all
 of his prepared text.  I congratulate the
 Senator on a very excellent speech and a
 very significant speech, particularly in
 view of the fact that the speech is made
 by the senior Senator from Wisconsin,
 whom I know to be completely independ-
 ent.  He has not been satisfied to follow
 anyone's leadership unless he thought it
 to be right, and he has at times taken
 that position at considerable cost to him-
 self.  He has not been willing to take
 that lead if he thought it was in error.
 His speech supporting the administra-
 tion and the President on Vietnam is
 especially significant in view of that fact.
 I congratulate him.
 The  Senator from Wisconsin  has
 brought out a number of facts which I,
 even as a member of the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee, was not completely
 aware of.
 I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for
 his contribution.  I believe his speech
 will prove to be one of the most construc-
 tive contributions to the debate over
 Vietnam.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  I appreciate what
 the  distinguished assistant  majority
 leader has said.  It Is very encouraging
 to hear him say that.
 THE MESS IN VIETNAM-V
 Mr. GRUENING.  Mr. President, I
 congratulate the distinguished senior
 Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. PROXMIRE]
 for his comprehensive, well organized,
 well knit, sincere presentation in de-
 fense of the course which the adminis-
 tration has been pursuing to date.  I
 do not, as I have sought to make clear for
 the past year, agree with it and with
 him.
 "What are our goals?" my able col-
 league asks, and he answers, there are
 three, and the first is "Peace.  An end
 to the fighting and terror in South Viet-
 nam."  Peace.
 I recall the words of the prophet who
 castigated those who cried "Peace, peace,
 when there is no peace."  I refer those
 who cry "Peace, peace," and support the
 extension and escalation of the unde-
 clared war and of the fighting not mere-
 ly in South Vietnam, but beyond, to the
 fact that we have been in South Vietnam
 militarily and financially, for 10 years.
 We continue to cry "Peace, peace, when
 there is no peace."  I have for a year ad-
 vocated a peaceful approach, a new ap-
 proach, an effort at least which has never
 been made to try to enlist the United
 Nations and to wage peace at least as
 vigorously as we have waged war.
 Now, what has happened in the past
 48 hours since the Senate adjourned on
 Friday?
 The State Department has issued a
 "white paper" over the weekend.  It
 certainly adds no new facts to the al-
 ready muddied waters of Vietnam.
 Of course, North Vietnam is and has
 been aiding the South Vietnamese Viet-
 cong.                                                                                        That is nothing new.  But the
 fact does remain that we have been aid-
 ing the South Vietnamese on a scale far

 OFFICIALS
 (See sec. IV, A, 1.)
 Huynh Van Nghia and Nguyen Van Tien
 are  officials  of the  "National Liberation
 Front of South Vietnam."  Though they pro.
 fess to be citizens of South Vietnam, their
 ties are with and their support comes from
 North Vietnam and the Communist regime
 in Hanoi.  In  1963, when t:he two men
 traveled  abroad  on front business, they
 traveled as North Vietnamese with passports
 and other documents issued by the Hanoi
 regime.
 . Photographs of these documents follow
 (not printed in the RECORD).
 APPENDIX G
 THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY PARTY (SOUTH)
 _ AND  THE  LAO           DONG  PARTY  (NORTH)  ARE
 ONE COMMUNIST PARTY
 (See see. IV, A.)
 In May 1962 a military force of the Gov-
 ernment of Vietnam' captured a number of
 Vietcong documents in Ba Xuyen Province.
 One of these documents contained instruc-
 tions from the provincial committee of the
 Lao Dong Party (Communist Party) in Ba
 Xuyen to the party's district committees con-
 cerning formation of the new People's Revo-
 lutionary Party (PRP).
 Pertinentsections of the instruction, dated
 December 7, 1961, follow:
 "To D2 and K:
 "In regard to the foundation of the People's
 Revolutionary Party of South Vietnam, the
 creation of this party is only a matter of
 strategy; it needs to be explained within the
 party; and, to deceive the enemy, it is neces-
 sary that the new party begiven the outward
 appearance corresponding to a division of
 the party (Lao Dong) into two and the foun-
 dation of a new party, so that the enemy
 cannot use it in his propaganda.
 "Within the party, it is necessary to ex-
 plain that the founding of the People's Revo-
 lutionary Party has the purpose of isolating
 the Americans and the Ngo Dinh Diem re-
 gime:, and to counter their accusations of an
 invasion of the South by the North.  It is
 means of supporting our sabotage of the
 Geneva agreement, of advancing the plan of
 invasion of the South, and at the same time
 permitting the Front for Liberation of the
 South to recruit new adherents, and to gain
 the sympathy of nonalined countries in
 southeast Asia.
 "The People's Revolutionary Party has only
 the appearance of an independent existence;
 actually, our party is nothing but the Lao
 Dong Party of Vietnam (Vietminh Commu-
 nist Party), unified from North to South,
 under the direction of the central executive
 committee of the party, the chief of which
 is President Ho. * * *
 "During these explanations, take care to
 keep this strictly secret, especially in South
 Vietnam, so that the enemy does not perceive
 our purpose. *  *  *
 "Do-not put these explanations in party
 bulletins."
 Another party circular of the same date
 said:
 "The reasons for the change in the party's
 name must be kept stricly secret.  Accord-
 ing to instructions of the Central Commit-
 tee, one must not tell the people or party
 sympathizers that the People's Revolutionary
 Party and the Lao Dong Party of Vietnam
 are one.  One must not say that it is only a
 tactic, because it would not be good for the
 enemy to know."
 A  third party circular, dated December 8,
 1961, said:
 "Study the instructions so that you will
 be able to execute them.  In passing them to
 D2V, D2, and K, be very careful that the
 documents do not fall into enemy hands.
 After D2N/C has passed to the sections, de-
 stroy the written documents immediately."
 The originals and translations of the above
 documents were submitted to the Interna-
 tional Control Commission by the Govern-
 ment of Vietnam on May 30, 1962.1
 In 1964 new rules and regulations were
 promulgated for the People's Revolutionary
 Patty. A copy of the new rules was captured
 from the Vietcong in Chuong Thien Province
 I For picture of captured documents and
 text, see the white paper "Communist Viet-
 minh Aggressive Policy," published by the
 Government of the Republic of Vietnam,
 Saigon, July 1962.
 in  November  1964.  A photograph  of the
 captured document appears on the next page.
 Key portions of the instructions said that
 new rules and regulations had been ap-
 proved for the PRP, "but the real nature of
 those rules and regulations is that they still
 are the rules and regulations of the Vietnam
 Lao Dong Party (in North Vietnam)."
 The instructions added: "* * * we should
 realize that our country is one country, that
 the Vietnamese People's Revolutionary Party
 and the Vietnam Lao Dong Party are one
 party. * * * There is nothing different be-
 tween the two parties."

 LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE U.N.
 SECURITY  COUNCIL
 (Signed by A. Stevenson)
 (Circular No. 1589, dated February 27.)
 For the information of members of the
 Security Council, I am transmitting a spe-
 cial report entitled "Aggression from the
 North, the Record of North Vietnam's Cam-
 paign To Conquer South Vietnam," which
 my Government is making public today.  It
 presents evidence from which the following
 conclusions are inescapable:
 First, the subjugation by forces of the
 Republic of Vietnam by the regime in north-
 ern Vietnam is the formal, official policy of
 that regime; this has been stated and con-
 Armed publicly over the past 5 years.
 Second, the war in Vietnam is directed
 by the Central Committee of the Lao Dong
 Party (Communist) which controls the gov-
 ernment in northern Vietnam.
 Third, the so-called Peoples Revolutionary
 Party in the Republic of Vietnam is an inte-
 gral part of the Lao Dong Party in North
 Vietnam.
 Fourth, the so-called Liberation Front for
 South Vietnam is a subordinate unit of the
 Central Office for South Vietnam, an integral
 part               of  the  governmental  machinery  in
 Hanoi.
 Fifth, the key leadership of the Vietcong-
 officers, specialists, technicians, intelligence
 agents, political organizers and propagan-
 dists-has been trained, equipped and sup-
 plied in the north and sent into the Republic
 of Vietnam under Hanoi's military orders.
 Sixth, most of the weapons, including new
 types recently introduced, and most of the

 means for providing for South Vietnam's
 defense were required.  Therefore, air strikes
 have been wage against some of the mili-
 tary assembly points and supply bases from
 which North Vietnam is, conducting its ag-
 gression against the South.  These strikes
 constitute a limited response fitted to the
 aggression that produced them.
 Until the regime in Hanoi decides to halt
 its intervention in the South, or until effec-
 tive steps are taken to maintain peace and
 security in the area, the Governments of
 South Vietnam and the United States will
 continue  necessary  measures  of  defense
 against the Communist armed aggression
 coming from North Vietnam.
 VI. CONCLUSION
 The evidence presented in this report could
 be multiplied many times with similar ex-
 amples of the drive of the Hanoi regime
 to extend. its rule over South Vietnam.
 The record is conclusive.  It establishes
 beyond question that North Vietnam is carry-
 ing out a carefully conceived, plan of ag-
 gression against the South.                            It shows that
 North Vietnam has intensified its efforts in
 the years since it was condemned by the In-
 ternational Control Commission.  It proves
 that Hanoi continues to press its systematic
 program of armed aggression into South
 Vietnam.  This  aggression  violates-  the
 United Nations Charter. It is directly con-
 rary to the Geneva Accords of 1954 and of
 1962 to which North Vietnam is a party. It
 shatters the peace of southeast Asia.  It is a
 fundamental threat to the freedom and se-
 curity of South Vietnam.

 as appropriate in each individual case."

 FINDINGS  OF , THE  INTERNATIONAL  CONTROL
 COMMISSION
 On June 2, 1962, the International Com-
 mission for Supervision and Control in Viet-
 nam (ICC) sent a special report to the Gov-
 ernments of the United Kingdom and of the
 Soviet Union in their role as cochairmen of
 the Geneva Conference on Indochina.  The
 ICC is composed of delegates from India
 (chairman), Canada, and Poland.
 In its report the ICC noted the following
 finding of the Commission's Legal Commit-
 tee:
 "Having examined the complaints and the
 supporting material sent by the South Viet-
 namese mission, the committee has come to
 the  conclusion that  in  specific  instances
 there is evidence to show that armed and

 other supplies have been sent from the zone
 in the north to the zone in the south with
 the object of supporting, organizing, and

 LIST OF  COMMUNIST WEAPONS  CAPTURED IN
 SouTH VIETNAM
 (See sec. II.)
 On January 29, 1964, the Government of
 Vietnam  submitted                                                  to  the International
 Control Commission a list of weapons and
 other military equipment which had been
 captured from the Vietcong.  The weapons
 and  equipment                                                    came  from  Communist
 sources outside South Vietnam and obvious-
 ly had been introduced clandestinely into
 the country in support of the Vietcong cam-
 paign of conquest directed by Hanoi.

 A. Political organization.
 -Political direction and control of the Viet
 cone 3s supplied by the Lao Dong Party," i.e.
 the Communist Party, led by Ho Chi Minh.
 Party agents are responsible for indoctrina-
 tion, recruitment, political training, propa-
 ganda,  anti-Government  demonstrations,
 and other activities of a political nature.
 The considerable intelligence-gathering fa-
 cilities of the party are also at the disposal
 of the Vietcong.
 Overall direction of the VC movement Is
 the responsibility of the Central Committee
 of the Lao Dome Party.  Within the central
 committee a special reunification depart-
 ment has been established. This has replaced
 the  committee  for  supervision  of  the
 south mentioned in intelligence reports 2
 years ago.  It lays down broad strategy for
 the movement to conquer South Vietnam.
 Until March 1662 there were two principal
 administrative divisions in the VC structure
 in the south?  One was the interzone of
 South; Central Vietnam (sometimes called
 interzone 5); the other was the Nambo re-
 gion.                  In a 1962 reorganization these were
 merged into one, called the central office for
 South Vietnam.   The central' committee,
 through its reunification' department,  is-
 sues dirctives to the ' central office,. which
 e
 translates them into specific orders for the
 appropriate subordinate command.
 Under the central office are six regional
 units (V through IX) plus the special zone of
 Saigon/Cholon/Gis' Dinh.  A regional com-
 mittee responsible to the central office directs
 VC activities in each region:  Each regional
 committee has specialized units responsible
 for liaison, propaganda, training, personnel,
 subversive  activities,  espionage,  military
 bases, and the like.
 Below each regional committee are simi-
 16rly structured units at ' the province and
 district levels.  At the  base  of the Com-
 munist pyramid are the individual party
 cells, which may be organized on a geographic
 base or within social or occupational groups.
 The elaborateness of the party unit and the
 extent to which it operates openly or under-
 ground is determined mainly by the extent
 of VC control over the area concerned.
 1. The Liberation Front:  The' National
 Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam
 is the screen "behind which the Communists
 carry out their program of 'conquest.  It '1s
 the creature of the Communist Government
 In Hanoi.  As noted above the 'Communist
 Party in the North demanded establishment
 of such a front 3 months before its forma-
 tion was actually announced in December
 1960.  It was designed to create the illusion
 that the Vietcong campaign of "subversion
 was  truly indigenous to  South  Vietnam
 rather than an externally directed Commu-
 from  the  North
 Party in Hanoi?
 Vietnamese. Communist
 time guerrillas.  They. are generally. orga
 nized at the district level where there are
 likely to be several companies of 50 or more
 men each.  These troops receive only half
 pay, which means they must work at least
 part of the time to eke out a living.
 Below the irregular guerrilla forces of the
 district are the part-time, village-based guer-
 rillas.
 They are available for assignment by higher
 headquarters and are used for harassment
 and sabotage.  They are expected to warn
 nearby VC units of the approach of any force
 of the legal government.   They provide a
 pool for recruitment into the VC district
 forces.
 The record shows that many of the village
 guerrillas are dragooned into service with
 the Vietcong.  Some are kidnapped; others
 are threatened; still others join to prevent
 their families from being harmed.  Once in
 the Vietcong net, many are reluctant to leave
 for fear of punishment by the authorities or
 reprisal by the Communists.
 Lam Van Chuol is a typical example.  He
 was a member of the village civil defense
 force in his home village in Kien Giang pro-
 vince.  In March 1960, he was kidnaped by
 the Vietcong and kept a prisoner in the
 highlands for 1 month.  There he was sub-
 jected to intense propaganda and indoc-
 trination. He was returned to his village but
 kept- under close observation  and  steady
 pressure. Finally, he was convinced he must
 join the VC.  Later, he was transferred to
 a Communist military unit In another pro-
 vince.  After learning of the Government's
 open arms program, he decided to defect
 from the VC.  In May 1964, he walked into
 a Government outpost and asked for protec-
 tion.
 Money to pay the regular VC units comes
 from a variety of sources. . Funds are sent
 from Hanoi.  "Taxes" are extorted from the
 local population.  Landowners and planta-
 tion operators often must pay a tribute to
 the VC as the price for not having their lands
 devastated.  Similarly, transportation com-
 panies have been forced to pay the VC or
 face the threat of having their buses or boats
 sabotaged.   Officials and wealthy people have
 been kidnaped for ransom.  The VC have
 often stopped buses and taken the money
 and valuables of all on board.
 For the most part, the VC have concen-
 trated their attention on individuals, iso-
 lated or poorly defended outposts, and small
 centers of population.  They have mercilessly
 killed or kidnaped thousand of village chiefs
 and other local officials.  But over the past
 year the VC have moved into larger unit
 operations.   Their ability to operate on a
 battalion level or larger has substantially
 increased.
 C. Intelligence organization
 A key element in the Vietcong effort is an
 elaborate organization in Hanoi called the
 Central Research Agency (CRA)  (Cue Nghi-
 en-Cuu Trung-Uong).   Though it handles
 Hanoi's Intellience  effort  on  a worldwide
 scale, the main focus of its operation is on
 South Vietnam.  This agency is able to draw
 on the intelligence capabilities of both the
 Lao Dong Party and the North Vietnamese
 armed forces for information, personnel, and
 facilities.
 The CRA reportedly operates under the
 close personal scrutiny of Ho Chi Minh him-
 self.  Some of the top officials in the Hanoi
 government reportedly sit on its directing
 committee,  including  Premier  Pham  Van
 Dong, Deputy Premier Truong Chinh, and
 Defense Minster Vo Nguyen Giap.
 Considerable information on the organiza-
 tion of the CRA has become available from
 captured Vietcong agents and from the work
 of intelligence agents  of the Republic of
 Vietnam.  Much of this information cannot
 be made public for security reasons, but it
 is possible to describe the CRA organization
 and its operations in broad outline. .
 The front has won support primarily from
 the Communist world.  Its radio faithfully
 repeats the propaganda themes of Hanoi and
 Peiping.   When its representatives travel
 abroad, they do so with North Vietnamese
 passports and sponsorship a The front's pro-
 gram copies that of the Lao Dong Party in
 North Vietnam:
 In late 1961, in still another effort to con-
 ceal the extent of Communist domination
 of the front, the Communists announced
 formation of a new Marxist -political unit,
 the  People's Revolutionary Party  (PRP).
 This mechanism provided a way to explain
 the Communist presence In,the front while
 at the same time making it appear that the
 Communist voice. was only one of several
 affiliated organizations In the front. The
 MP itself clalip.ed direct descent from, the
 original Indochinese Communist Party and
 s Pictures of North' Vietnamese passports
 and travel documeints used by front officials
 'are in app. F.  [Not printed in RECdRD.],
 B. Military organization
 Military affairs of the Vietcong are the
 responsibility of high command of the Peo-
 ple's Army of North Vietnam and the Min-
 istry of Defense, under close supervision from
 the Lao Dong Party.  These responsibilities
 include  operational plans,  assignments  of
 individuals and regular units, training pro-
 grams, infiltration of military personnel and
 supplies, military communications, tactical
 intelligence, supplies, and the like. The six
 military regions are the same as those of
 the VC political organization.
 The military structure of the Vietcong is
 an integral part of the political machinery
 that controlg every facet of VC activity in
 South Vietnam under Hanoi's overall direc-
 tion.  Each political headquarters from the
 central office down to the village has a mili-
 tary component which controls day-to-day
 military operations.  Similarly,` each mili-
 tary headquarters has a political element, an
 individual or a small staff.  This meshing
 of political and military activity is designed
 to insure the closest cooperation in support
 of the total Communist mission.   It also
 gives assurance of political control over the
 military.
 Associated with the central office, believed
 to be located in Tay Ninh Province, is a mili-
 tary headquarters.  Through this headquar-
 ters, as well as through other channels, Hanoi
 maintains direct contact with its principal
 military units in the south.
 In addition to its supervision of the gen-
 eral military effort of the VC, the military
 section of the central. office is believed to
 have  direct  command  of  two  regimental
 headquarters and a number of security com-
 panies.
 The hard core of the VC military organiza-
 tion is the full-time. regular unit usually
 based on a province or region.  These are
 wall-trained and highly disciplined guerrilla
 fighters.  They follow a rigid training sched-
 ule, that Is roughly two-thirds military and
 one-third political In content. This com-
 pares with the 50-50 proportion for district
 }tits and the 70 percent political and 30
 percent military content of the village guer-
 rilla's training.
 The size. of the Vietcong regular forces has
 grown steadily in recent years.  For exam-
 ple, the Vietcong have five regimental head-
 quarters compared with two in 1961.  And
 the main. VQ force is cQmposed of 50 battal-
 ions, 60 percent more than before. There
 are .au_estimated 139 _VC_-companies. Hard-
 core VC strength now is estimated at about
 35.000, whereas it was less than 20,000 in
 1961,
 The main force battalions are well armed
 with a variety of effective weapons includ-
 ing 75-millimeter recoilless rifles and 81-82-
 millimeter  mortars. _The  companies  and
 smaller units are equally well equipped and
 have 57-millimeter recoilless rifles and 60-
 millimeter mortarsirk their inventory. It is
 estimated that the Vietcong have at least
 130 81-millimeter mortars and 300 60-milli-
 meter mortars.  Thereis no precise estimate
 for the number of recoilless rifles In their
 bands, but it is believed that most main
 force units are equipped with them.  In at
 least one recent action the Vietcong em-
 ployed a 75-millimeter pack howitzer.  This
 mobile weapon, which has a range of 8,500
 yards, will increase the Vietcong capabilities
 to launch long-range attacks against many
 stationary targets in the country.
 Supporting the main force units of the
 Vietcong are an estimated 60,000-80,000 part-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE                  March 1
 The headquarters of the CRA in Hanoi is
 divided into six main sections, not including
 a special code unit.  The six sections are re-
 sponsible for administration, cadres, com-
 munications, espionage, research, and train-
 ing.          Each section has units to handle the
 specialized activities of its particular area of
 responsibility.  The research section, for ex-
 ample, has subsections that handle political,
 economic, and military affairs respectively.
 CRA  headquarters directs a number  of
 special centers for oversea operations. One
 such center maintains intelligence channels
 to oversea areas. It operates through spe-
 cial units at Haiphong and at Hongay.
 A second special center is responsible for
 VC intelligence operations in Cambodia and
 Laos.  A third center handles activities along
 the  "demarcation  line,"  the  border  with
 South Vietnam.  This unit, based in Vinh
 Linh in southeast North Vietnam, is respon-
 sible for sending agents and supplies to the
 south by sea.  It also cooperates with the
 North Vietnamese army in planning and
 carrying out infiltration.  The CRA main-
 tains intelligence bases in Laos and other
 countries.
 Inside South Vietnam the Vietcong have a
 large intelligence network. Some of its units
 are responsible for receiving and sending on
 agents arriving from the North.  They feed
 and. give instructions to groups infiltrating
 into South Vietnam.  They take delivery of
 equipment and supplies received from the
 North and relay them to Vietcong units In
 the south.
 Many Vietcong agents have been captured
 in Saigon.  They have exposed the extensive
 effort by the CRA to penetrate all Republic
 of Vietnam Government agencies, foreign
 embassies, and other specialized organiza-
 tions.  Party and military intelligence units
 and agents work closely with the CRA.
 Each of the main centers operating under
 CRA headquarters has its own sections and
 units designed to carry out its main func-
 tions.  The center at Vinh Linh, responsible
 for the main infiltration effort of the Viet-
 cong, has separate sections for radio com-
 munications,  coding,  documentation  and
 training, and liaison.  It also has specialized
 units for Infiltration through the moun-
 tains, infiltration by sea, and "Illegal action"
 In the mountain area.
 The CRA maintains a large and expanding
 radio communications network.  Agents also
 are used to carry messages, usually in secret
 writing or memorized.
 Taken as a whole, the North Vietnamese
 intelligence operation in  support of the
 Vietcong is one of the most extensive of its
 kind in the world e
 P. A, BRIEF HISTORY  OF HANOI'S CAMPAIGN OF
 AGGRESSION AGAINST SOUTH VIETNAM
 While negotiating an end to the Indochina
 war at Geneva in 1954, the Communists were
 making plans to take over all former French
 territory in southeast Asia.  When Vietnam
 was partitioned, thousands of carefully se-
 lected party members were ordered to remain
 in place in the south and keep their secret
 apparatus intact to help promote Hanoi's
 cause.  Arms and ammunition were stored
 away for future use.  Guerrilla fighters re-
 joined their families to await the party's call.
 Others  withdrew  to  remote  jungle  and
 mountain hideouts.    The majority, an esti-
 mated 90,000, were moved to North Vietnam.
 Hanoi's original calculation was that all
 of Vietnam would fall under its control with-
 out resort to force.               For this purpose, Com-
 munist cadres were ordered to penetrate offi-
 cial and nonofficial agencies, to propagandize
 and sow confusion, and generally to use all
 means short of open violence to aggravate
 war-torn conditions and to weaken South
 Vietnam's government and social fabric.
 e Charts of the VC organizational structure
 are in appendix if.
 South, Vietnam's refusal to fall in with
 Hanoi's scheme for peaceful takeover came
 as a heavy blow to the Communists.  Mean-
 time, the Government had stepped up ef-
 forts to blunt Vietcong subversion and to
 expose Communist agents.  Morale in the
 Communist  organization  in  the    south
 dropped sharply.  Defections were numerous.
 Among South Vietnamese, hope rose that
 their nation could have a peaceful and inde-
 pendent future, free of Communist domina-
 tion.                                                          The country went to work.  The years
 after 1955 were a period of steady progress
 and growing prosperity.
 Food production levels of the prewar years
 were reached and surpassed.  While per cap-
 ita food output was dropping 10 percent in
 the north from 1956 to 1960, it rose 20 per-
 cent in the south.  By 1983 it had risen 30
 percent, despite the disruption in the coun-
 tryside caused by intensified Vietcong mili-
 tary attacks and terrorism.  The authorities
 in the north admitted openly to continuing
 annual failures to achieve food production
 goals.
 Production  of textiles  increased in the
 south             more  that  20  percent   in  1  year
 (1958).  In the same year, South Vietnam's
 sugar crop increased more than 100 percent.
 Despite North Vietnam's vastly larger indus-
 trial complex, South Vietnam's per capita
 gross national product in 1960 was estimated
 at $110 a person while it was only $70 in the
 North.
 More than 900,000 refugees who had fled
 from Communist rule in the North were suc-
 cessfully settled in South Vietnam.  An
 agrarian reform program  was instituted.
 The elementary school population nearly
 quadrupled between 1956 and 1960. And
 so it went-a record of steady improvement
 in the lives of the people.  It was intolerable
 for the rulers in Hanoi; under peaceful con-
 ditions,  the south was                                                                        outstripping the
 north. They were losing the battle of peace-
 ful competition and decided to use violence
 and terror to gain their ends.
 After 1956 Hanoi rebuilt, reorganized, and
 expanded its covert political and military
 machinery in the South.  Defectors were
 replaced by trained personnel from party
 ranks in the north. Military units and polit-
 ical cells were enlarged and were given new
 leaders, equipment, and intensified training.
 Recruitment was pushed.  In short, Hanoi
 andits forces in theSouth prepared to take
 by force and violence what they had failed
 to achieve by other means.
 By 1958 the use of terror by the Vietcong
 increased appreciably.  It was used both to
 win prestige and to back up demands for
 support from the people, support that poli-
 tical and propaganda appeals had failed to
 produce.  It was also designed to embarrass
 the Government in Saigon and raise doubts
 about its ability to maintain internal order
 and to assure the personal security of its
 people.  From 1959 through 1961, the pace
 of Vietcong terrorism and armed attacks ac-
 celerated substantially.
 The situation at the end of 1961 was so
 grave that the Government of the Republic
 of Vietnam asked the United States for in-
 creased military assistance.   That request
 was met.  Meantime, the program of stra-
 tegic hamlets, designed to improve the peas-
 ant's livelihood and give him some protec-
 tion against Vietcong harassment and pres-
 sure, was pushed energetically.
 But the Vietcong did not stand still.  To
 meet the changing situation, they tightened
 their organization and adopted new tactics,
 with increasing emphasis on terrorism, sabo-
 tage, and armed attacks by small groups.
 They also introduced from the North tech-
 nicians In fields such as armor and anti-
 aircraft. Heavier weapons were sent in to the
 regular guerrilla forces.
 The military and insurgency situation was
 complicated by a quite separate internal po-
 litical struggle in South Vietnam, which led
 in November 1963 to the removal of the
 Diem government and its replacement with
 a new one.  Effective power was placed in
 the hands of a Military Revolutionary Coun-
 cil.  There have been a number of changes in
 the leadership and composition of the Gov-
 ernment in Saigon in the ensuing period.
 These internal developments and distrac-
 tions gave the Vietcong an invaluable op-
 portunity, and they took advantage of it.
 Vietcong agents did what they could to en-
 courage disaffection and to exploit demon-
 strations in Saigon and elsewhere.  In the
 countryside  the  Communists  consolidated
 their hold over some areas and enlarged their
 military and political apparatus by increased
 infiltration. Increasingly they struck at re-
 mote outposts and the most vulnerable of
 the new strategic hamlets and expanded their
 campaign of aggressive attacks, sabotage,
 and terror.
 Any official, worker, or establishment that
 represents a service to the people by the Gov-
 ernment in Saigon is fair game for the Viet-
 cong.  Schools have been among their favor-
 ite targets.  Through harassment, the mur-
 der of teachers, and sabotage of buildings,
 the Vietcong succeeded in closing hundreds
 of schools and interrupting the education
 of tens of thousands of youngsters.
 Hospitals and medical clinics have often
 been attacked as part of the anti-Govern-
 ment campaign and also because such at-
 tacks provide the Vietcong with needed med-
 ical supplies.  The Communists have en-
 couraged people In rural areas to oppose the
 Government's antimalaria teams, and some
 of the workers have been killed. Village and
 town offices, police stations, and agricultural
 research stations are high on the list of pre-
 ferred targets for the Vietcong.
 In  1964, 436 South Vietnamese hamlet
 chiefs and other Government officials were
 killed outright by the Vietcong and 1,131
 were kidnaped.  More than 1,350 civilians
 were killed in bombings and other acts of
 sabotage.  And at least 8,400 civilians were
 kidnaped by the Vietcong e
 Today the war in Vietnam has reached new
 levels of intensity.  The elaborate effort by
 the Communist regime in North Vietnam to
 conquer the South has grown, not dimin-
 ished.  Military men, technicians, political
 organizers, propagandists, and secret agents
 have been infiltrating into the Republic of
 Vietnam from the north in growing num-
 bers.  The  flow  of  Communist-supplied
 weapons, particularly those of large caliber,
 has increased.  Communications links with
 Hanoi are extensive. Despite  the  heavy
 casualties of 8 years of fighting, the hard-
 core VC force is considerably larger now than
 it was at the end of 1961.
 The Government in Saigon has undertaken
 vigorous action to meet the new threat. The
 United States and other free countries have
 increased their assistance to the Vietnamese
 Government and people.  Secretary of State
 Dean Rusk visited Vietnam in 1964, and he
 promised the Vietnamese: "We shall remain
 at your side until the aggression from the
 north has been defeated, until it has been
 completely rooted out and this land enjoys
 the peace which it deserves."
 President Johnson has repeatedly stressed
 that the U.S. goal is to see peace secured in
 southeast Asia.  But he has noted that "that
 will come only when aggressors leave their
 neighbors in peace."
 Though it has been apparent for years that
 the regime in Hanoi was conducting a cam-
 paign of conquest against South Vietnam,
 the Government in Saigon and the Govern-
 ment of the United States both hoped that
 the danger could be met within South Viet-
 nam itself.  The hope that any widening of
 the conflict might be avoided was stated
 frequently.

 tion of South Vietnam
 The student popula                   is an important target group for VC propa-
 gandists.  These agents seek to win adher-
 ents for the Communist cause among young
 workers, students in high schools and uni-
 versities, and the younger officers and en-
 listed men in the armed forces of the Repub-
 lic of Vietnam.
 Typical of the agents sent Into South
 Vietnam for this purpose is Nguyen Van Vy,
 a 19-year-old- VC propagandist.  He is a
 native of the Vinh Linh District in North
 Vietnam, just north of the demilitarized
 zone.  He Was a member of a Communist
 party youth group in his native village.  He
 was recruited for propaganda work in the
 south in the fall of 1962.  He was one of 40
 young persons enrolled in a special political
 training course given by the Communist
 Party in his district.
 The first phase of the training consisted of
 political indoctrination covering such sub-
 jects as the advance of communism, the
 North Vietnamese plan for winning control
 of the country, the responsibility of youth
 in furthering this plan, the war in the south,
 and the need for propaganda supporting the
 Liberation Front.
 Those who successfully completed the first-
 phase were selected for the second level of
 training, the so-called technical training
 phase. In this the trainees were given their
 mission in the south.  Vy was told he should
 infiltrate into South Vietnam and there sur-
 render to the authorities, describing himself
 as a detector who was "tired of the miserable
 life in the north."  He was to say he wanted
 to complete his schooling, which was impos-
 slble in thg north.  He was told to ask to
 live with relatives in the south so he could
 go to school.  Once his story was accepted
 and he Was enrolled in_a school, he was to
 begin his work of propagandiizng other stu-
 dente, ? He was' to wait for 3 or 4 months,
 however, until he was no longer the subject
 of local suspicion.  He was assigned to work
 under an older agent to whom he had to
 report regularly.
 A third member of the team was a younger
 man who was to assist Vy.  The three were
 to ,inftitrate into South Vietnam separately
 and to meet there at a rendezvous point.
 At first Vy was to do no more than` to
 observe his fellow students carefully, col-
 lecting biographical data on them and study-
 ing their personalities, capabilities, and as-
 pirations.  He was then to select those he
 thought might be most influenced by Com-
 munist propaganda and try to make friends
 with them.
 Once he had selected, targets, he was to
 begin to influence them favorably toward the
 north and to implant Communist propa-
 ganda. He was responsible then for bringing
 into his organization those he had influenced
 effectively.  These individuals were to be
 given their own propaganda assignments to
 work on other students.
 Students who wanted to evade military
 service in the Government forces were con-
 sidered prime' targets.  Where possible, 't 'y
 was to help them get to North Vietnam. He
 was also told to make contact with any stu-
 dents who had been picked up by the author-
 ities for suspected  Communist activities.

 3.'Other Agents
 The Communist authorities in North Viet-
 nam send their agents into South Vietnam
 by a wide variety of means.  A few like
 Nguyen Van Vy cross the demilitarized zone,
 more infiltrate by sea, and still more along
 the infiltration routes through Laos.  But
 there are other methods for entering South
 Vietnam.  VC  espionage  agent Tran    Van
 But attempted one such method.
 But was a graduate of the espionage train-
 ing school in Haiphong, North Vietnam.                                                                                  He
 completed a special 6-month course in July
 1962.  The training included political In-
 doctrination, but most of the time was spent
 on such things as use of weapons, preparing
 booby traps, and methods of sabotage.  He
 was also given instruction in methods for
 enlisting help from hoodlums, draft dodgers,
 and VC sympathizers.  Once in South Viet-
 nam, he was to organize a small unit for
 sabotage and the collection of information.
 On specific assignment by his superiors he
 was to be ready to sabotage ships in Saigon
 harbor and to blow up gasoline and oil stor-
 age points and Vietnamese Army installa-
 tions.  He was told to be prepared to assas-
 sinate Vietnamese officials and American per-

 II, HANOI SUPPLIES WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND
 OTHER WAR MATERIEL TO ITS FORCES IN THE
 SOUTH                 -
 When Hanoi launched the VC campaign of
 terror, violence, and subversion in earnest
 in 1959, the Communist forces relied mainly
 on stocks of weapons and ammunition left
 over from the war against the French.  Sup-
 plies sent in from North Vietnam came
 largely from the same source. As the military
 campaign progressed, the Vietcong depended
 heavily on weapons captured from the Armed
 Forces in South Vietnam.  This remains an
 important source of weapons and ammuni-
 tions for the Vietcong.  But as the pace of
 the war has quickened, requirements for up-
 to-date arms and special types of weapons
 have risen to a point where the Vietcong can-
 not rely on captured stocks.  Hanoi has
 undertaken a program to reequip its forces
 in ' the south  With  Communist -produced
 weapons.
 Large and increasing quantities of mili-
 tary supplies are entering South Vietnam
 from outside the country.   The principal
 supply ' point is North Vietnam, which pro-
 vides a convenient Channel for materiel that
 3703
 originates in Communist China and other
 Communist countries.
 An increasing number of weapons from
 external Communist sources have been seized
 in the south.  These include such weapons
 as 57-millimeter and 75-millimeter recoilless
 rifles, dual-purpose  machineguns,  rocket
 launchers, large mortars, and antitank mines.
 A new group of Chinese Communist-manu-
 factured weapons has recently appeared in
 VC hands.  These include the 7.62 semiauto-
 matic carbine, 7.62 light machinegun, and
 the 7.62 assault rifle.  These weapons and
 ammunition   for  them,  manufactured. in
 Communist China in 1962, were first cap-
 tured in December 1964 in Chuong Thien
 Province.  Similar weapons have since been
 seized in each of the four corps areas of
 South Vietnam. Also captured have been
 Chinese    Communist   antitank   grenade
 launchers and ammunition made in China
 in 1963.
 One captured Vietcong told his captors
 that his entire company had been supplied
 recently with modern Chinese weapons. The
 reequipping of VC units with a type of weap-
 ons that require ammunition and parts from
 outside South Vietnam indicates the growing
 confidence of the authorities in Hanoi in the
 effectiveness of their supply lines into the
 south.
 Incontrovertible evidence of Hanoi's elabo-
 rate program to supply its forces in the south
 with weapons, ammunition, and other sup-
 plies has accumulated over the years.  Dra-
 matic new proof was exposed just as this re-
 port was being completed.
 On February 16, 1965, an American heli-
 copter pilot flying along the South Viet-
 namese coast sighted a suspicious vessel. It
 was a..cargo ship of an estimated 100-ton
 capacity, carefully camouflaged and moored
 just offshore along the coast of Phu Yen
 Province.   Fighter planes that approached
 the vessel met machinegun fire from guns on
 the deck of the ship and from the shore
 as well.  A Vietnamese Air Force strike was
 launched against the vessel, and Vietnamese
 Government troops moved  into  the  area.
 They seized the ship after a bitter fight with
 the Vietcong.
 The ship, which had been sunk in shallow
 water, had discharged a huge cargo of arms,
 ammunition. and  other  supplies.   Docu-
 ments found on the ship and on the bodies
 of several Vietcong aboard identified the ves-
 sel as having come from North Vietnam.                                                                                                                         A
 newspaper in the cabin was from Haiphong
 and was dated January 23, 1965.  The sup-
 plies delivered by the ship-thousands of
 weapons and more than a million rounds of
 ammunition-were almost all of Communist
 origin, largely from Communist China and
 Czechoslovakia, as well as North Vietnam.
 At least 100 tons of military supplies were
 discovered near the ship.
 A preliminary survey of the cache near the
 sunken vessel from Hanoi listed the follow-
 ing supplies and weapons:
 Approximately 1 million rounds of small-
 arms ammunition;  more than  1,000  stick
 grenades;  500 pounds of TNT in prepared
 charges; 2,000 rounds of 82-millimeter mortar
 ammunition;  500 antitank  grenades; 600
 rounds of 57-millimeter recoilless rifle am-
 munition; more than 1,000 rounds of 75-
 millimeter recoilless rifle ammunition; one
 57-millimeter recoilless rifle; 2 heavy ma-
 chlneguns; 2,000 -'7.-95 ldauser rifles;  more
 than 100, 7.62 carbines; 1,000 submachine-
 guns; 15 light machineguns; 500 rifles; 500
 pounds of medical supplies (with labels from
 North Vietnam, Communist China, Czecho-
 slovakia, East Germany, Soviet Union, and
 other sources).
 The shlp'ivas `fairly new and had been

 North Vietnam, and one of the Tra Vinh area
 of South Vietnam).  The military health
 records of North Vietnamese soldiers were
 found. One man had a political history sheet
 showing he was a member of the 338th Di-
 vision of the North Vietnamese Army.  (See
 app.. E.)
 Also abroad the North Vietnamese ship
 were: an instruction book for a Chinese
 Communist navigational device; postcards
 and letters to addresses in North Vietnam;
 snapshots, including one of a group of men
 in North Vietnamese Army uniforms under a
 flag of the Hanoi government.
 Members of the ICC and representatives of
 the free press visited the sunken North Viet-
 namese ship and viewed its cargo.  The
 incident itself underlined in the most drama-
 tic form that Hanoi is behind the continuing
 campaign of aggression aimed at conquer-_
 ing South Vietnam.  It made unmistakably
 clear that what ishappening in South Viet-
 nam is not an internal affair but part of a
 large-scale carefully directed and supported
 program of armed attack on a sovereign state
 and a free people.
 There have been previous seizures of large
 stocks of ammunition and weapons and
 other  military  supplies  that  could  only
 have come from Communist sources outside
 South Vietnam.   In December 1963, a Re-
 public of Vietnam force attacked  a VC
 stronghold in Dinh Tuong Province south-
 west of Saigon.               A large cache of VC equip-
 ment was-seized.  Included in the captured
 stocks were the following weapons and am-
 munition, all of Chinese Communist manu-
 facture:
 One 9b-millimeter rocket launcher; 2 car-
 bines (type 53); 120 rounds of 75-millimeter
 recoilless rifle ammunition; 120 detonating
 fuses for recoilless rifle ammunition; 14,000
 rounds of 7.62 (type P) ammunition; 160,000
 rounds of 7.62 carbine ammunition; 150 fuses
 for mortar shells;  100,000 rounds of 7.92
 Mauser-type ammunition; 110 pounds (ap-
 proximate) of TNT; two 60-millimeter mor-
 tars.
 These weapons and ammunition are the
 same as those used in the North Vietnamese
 Army.  Some of the 7.62-millimeter am-
 munition was manufactured as recently as
 1962.4
 Materiel is sent into South Vietnam from
 the North by a variety of methods--over-
 land, by river and canal, and by sea.  In one
 instance  Vietnamese  troops discovered  a
 cache in which the 75-millimeter ammuni-
 tion alone weighed approximately 11/2 tons.
 It has been estimated that it would require
 more than 150 porters to carry this quantity
 of ammunition over rough terrain.     How-
 ever, a few sampans, each manned by a few
 men, could transport it with little difficulty.
 It is worth noting, in this connection, that
 the delta where the cache of materiel was
 seized has 460 miles of seacoast as well as
 2,500 miles of canals navigable by large water-
 craft and another 2,200 miles of canals over
 which sampans can move easily.  Much of
 the transport of large stocks of ammunition
 is undoubtedly waterborne for at least much
 of its travel into South Vietnam.5
 Large quantities of chemical components
 for explosives have been sent into south
 Vietnam  for  the  Vietcong.   During  1963
 there were at least 15 incidents in which
 boats, junks, or sampans were seized with
 explosives aboard. More than 20 tons of
 potassium chlorate or nitrate were captured.
 4 On Jan. 29, 1964, the Government of the
 Republic  of Vietnam  supplied the Inter-
 national Control Commission with a list of
 weapons, ammunition, and other equipment
 of Communist origin captured in South Viet-
 nam since June 1962.              The list is summar-
 ized in app. D.
 B Photographs of additional Vietcong weap-
 ons and ammunition of Communist origin
 are contained in app. E.
 All these cases were in the delta area, and
 the majority were on or near the Mekong
 River. Red phosphorus made in Communist
 China has been among the chemicals cap-
 tured from the Vietcong.
 The  Communists have  shown extreme
 sensitivity to exposure of the fact that war
 material is going to the Vietcong from North
 Vietnam, Communist China, and other Com-
 munist countries.                                                            A secret document cap-
 tured from a VC agent last year reflected
 this sensitivity. The  document was sent
 from VC military headquarters in Bien Hoa
 Province to subordinate units.  It ordered
 them to "pay special attention to the re-
 moval of all the markings and letters on
 weapons of all types currently employed
 by units and agencies and manufactured by
 friendly East European democratic countries
 or by China."  It said incriminating mark-
 ing should be chiseled off "so that the enemy
 cannot use it as a propaganda theme every
 time he captures these weapons."
 III. NORTH VIETNAM:  BASE FOR CONQUEST OF
 THE   SOUTH
 The Third Lao Dong Party Congress in
 Hanoi in September 1960 set forth two tasks
 for its members: "to carry out the socialist
 revolution in North Vietnam" and "to lib-
 erate South Vietnam."
 The resolutions of the congress described
 the effort to destroy the legal Government
 in South Vietnam as follows: "The revolu-
 tion in the South is a protracted, hard, and
 complex process of struggle, combining many
 forms of struggle of great activity and flexi-
 bility, ranging from lower to higher, and
 taking as its basis the building, consolida-
 tion, and development of the revolutionary
 power of the masses."
 At the September meeting the Communist
 leaders in the north called for formation of
 "a  broad  national  united  front."  Three
 months later Hanoi announced creation of
 the "Front for Liberation of the South."
 This is the organization that Communist
 propaganda now credits with guiding the
 forces of subversion in the south; it is pic-
 tured as an organization established and run
 by the people in the south themselves.  At
 the 1960 Lao Dong Party Congress the tone
 was different.  Then, even before the front
 existed, the Communist leaders were issuing
 orders for the group that was being organized
 behind the scenes In Hanoi.  "This front
 must rally"; "The aims of its struggle are";
 "The front must carry out"-this is the way
 Hanoi and the Communist Party addressed
 the Liberation Front even before its found-
 Ing.
 The Liberation Front is Hanoi's creation;
 it is neither independent nor southern, and
 what it seeks is not liberation but subjuga-
 tion of the south.
 In his address to the Third Lao Dong Party
 Congress, party and government leader Ho
 Chi Minh spoke of the necessity "to step up
 the Socialist revolution in the north and,
 at the same time, to step up the national
 democratic people's revolution in the south."
 The  year before, writing for Red  Flag,
 the Communist Party newspaper of Belgium,
 Ho had said much the same thing: "We are
 building socialism in Vietnam, but we are
 building it in only one part of the country,
 While in the other part we still have to direct
 and bring to a close the middle-class demo-
 cratic and antiimpertalist revolution."
 In the same vein, the commander in chief
 of the North Vietnamese armed forces, Vo
 Nguyen Giap, spoke at the 1960 party con-
 gress of the need to "step up the national
 democratic people's revolution in the south."
 Earlier in the year, writing for the Commu-
 nist Party journal Hoc Tap in Hanoi, General
 Glap described the north as "the revolution-
 ary base for the whole country."
 Le Duan, a member of the Politburo and
 first secretary of the Lao Dong Party, was even
 more explicit when he talked at the party
 congressabout the struggle in the south and
 the party's role.  After noting the difficulties
 involved in overthrowing the existing order
 in South Vietnam, Le Duan said: "Hence the
 southern people's revolutionary struggle will
 be long, drawn out, and arduous.  It is not a
 simple process but a complicated one, com-
 bining many varied forms of struggle-from
 elementary to advanced, legal and illegal-
 and based on the building, consolidation, and
 development of the revolutionary force of the
 masses.  In this process, we must constantly
 intensify our solidarity and the organization
 and education of the people of the south."
 Another high official of the Hanoi regime,
 Truong Chinh, writing in the party organ Hoc
 Tap in April 1961, expressed confidence in the
 success of the struggle to remove the legal
 government  in  South  Vietnam  because:
 "North Vietnam  is  being  rapidly  con-
 solidated and strengthened, is providing good
 support to the South Vietnamese revolution,
 and is serving as a strong base for the strug-
 gle for national reunification."          -
 He outlined the steps by which the Com-
 munists expect to achieve control over all
 Vietnam as follows:  The Liberation Front
 would destroy the present Government in the
 south;  a  coalition  government  would  be
 established;  this government would   agree
 with the North Vietnamese government in
 Hanoi regarding national reunification un-
 der one form                                                                                                                                 or another.  It takes little
 imagination to understand the form that is
 intended.
 "Thus,"  wrote Truong Chinh,                      "though
 South Vietnam will be liberated by nonpeace-
 ful means, the party policy of achieving
 peaceful national reunification is still cor-
 rect."
 The official government radio in Hanoi is
 used both overtly and covertly to support
 the Vietcong effort in South Vietnam.  Cap-
 tured agents have testified that the broad-
 casts areused sometimes to send instructions
 in veiled code to Vietcong representatives in
 the south.
 Hoc Tap stated frankly in March 1963:
 "They [the authorities in South Vietnam]
 are well aware that North Vietnam is the firm
 base for the southern revolution and the
 point on which it leans, and that our party
 is the steady and experienced vanguard unit
 of the working class and people and is the
 brain and factor that decides all victories of
 the revolution."
 In April 1964 the Central Committee of the
 Lao Dong Party issued a directive to all
 party echelons.  It stated: "When the forces
 of the enemy and the plots of the enemy are
 considered, it is realized that the cadres,
 party members, and people in North Viet-
 nam must ? * * increase their sense of re-
 sponsibility in regard to the South Vietnam
 revolution by giving positive and practical
 support to South Vietnam in every field."
 Nguyen Chi Thanh, writing in a Hanoi
 newspaper in May 1963, underlined the im-
 portance of the role of the North Vietnamese
 Army in Hanoi's plans to unify Vietnam un-
 der Communist rule: "Our party set forth two
 strategic tasks to be carried out at the same
 time: to transform and build socialism in the
 north and to struggle to unify the country.
 Our army is an instrument of the class strug-
 gle in carrying out these two strategic tasks."
 IV.  ORGANIZATION,  DIRECTION,  COMMAND,  AND
 CONTROL OF THE ATTACK ON SOUTH VIETNAM
 ARE CENTERED IN HANOI
 The VC military and political apparatus
 in South Vietnam is an extension of an
 elaborate military and political structure in
 North Vietnam which directs and supplies
 it with the tools for conquest.  The Ho Chi
 Minh regime has shown that it is ready to
 allocate every resource that can be spared-
 whether it be personnel, funds, or equip-
 ment-to the cause of overthrowing the legit-
 imate Government in South Vietnam and
 of bringing all Vietnam under Communist
 rule.

 Vo's life and experiences were similar to
 those of thousands of Vietcong.  Born In
 Quang Ngai Province  in  1932, he went
 through 5 years of school and then worked
 on his parents' small farm. During the war
 against the French he joined the Viet Minh
 forces.  When the fighting ended, he was
 transferred to North Vietnam with his unit,
 the 210th Regiment.  He remained in the
 North Vietnamese Army until 1960 when he
 was sent to work on a state farm in Nghe An
 Province.  Vo said 3,000 men and women
 worked on the farm, of whom 400 were sol-
 diera.                    In September 1962 Vo was told he
 must join the newly activated 22d Battalion.
 All the members of the battalion came from
 provinces in South Vietnam, from. Quang Tri
 to Phu Yen.  But it was not an ordinary
 battalion; two-thirds of its members were
 cadre with ranks up to senior capitain.
 The group was put through an advanced
 training course that lasted 6 months.  The
 training  program included combat  tactics
 for units from squad to company and the
 techniques of guerrilla and counterguerrilla
 fighting. There were heavy doses of politi-
 cal indoctrination.
 On March 5, 1963, the 22d Battalion re-
 ceived orders to move south.   They were
 transported in trucks from Nghe An Province
 to Dong Hoi in Quang Binh, just north of
 the 17th parallel.  From there the unit was
 moved westward to the Lao border.  Then
 the more than 300 men began walking to
 the south following mountain trails in Laos
 and the Vietnam border area. They marched
 by day, rested at night.  Every fifth day
 they stopped at a way station for a full day's
 rest.  One company dropped off at Thua
 Thiem Province.  Vo and the remainder of
 the group marched on to Pleiku Province.
 Two fully armed companies from a neighbor-
 ing province were assigned to the battalion.
 The assignment given to the battalion was
 to harass strategic hamlets in the Hoai An
 district of Binh Dinh, to round up cattle
 and rice, to kill or kidnap cadre of the
 Government forces,  and  to  recruit local
 youth for service with the' Vietcong.
 3. Nguyen Thao
 Nguyen Thao was a VC weapons tech-
 nician.  A native of Khanh Hao Province in
 South Vietnam, he joined the Viet Minh in
 1950. He worked at a secret arsenal manu-
 faoturing weapons for use by the guerrilla
 forces. He went to North Vietnam after the
 Geneva. accords  were signed in  1954.   In
 North Vietnam    he  attended a technical
 school specializing in arms and manufacture.
 He received special training in foreign small
 arms and artillery.
 At the end of 1962 he was ordered to Ha
 Dong to attend a special course of political
 training in preparation for infiltrating into
 South  Vietnam.,   On  completion  of  the
 training course  e was assigned to a group
 of 14 men who would move to the south to-
 gether.                           Nguyen Thao said the group was
 composed of four armament specialists, two
 chemical engineers, and eight middle-level
 technical cadre.
 They left Ha Dong in March 1963, crossed
 into Laos, and reached their destination in
 the northern part of South Vietnam in May.
 Nguyen Thao went to work at a secret VC
 arsenal near the Quang Ngai border.  Fifty
 men, some local workers, manned the arsenal
 weapons section.  The group manufactured
 mines and grenades for the VC units in the
 area and repaired weapons.
 Nguyen Thao said he soon realized from
 talking with the local workers at the arsenal
 that most of what he had heard in the North
 about 'conditions in South Vietnam was
 wrong.  He said the Communists had de-
 ctived, him.; Two months after his arrival at
 the arsenal he decided to defect.  He asked
 permission to rejoin his family and to work
 in a national defense factory and continue
 his studies.
 4. Nguyen Viet Le
 This VC soldier was born in Quang Nam
 Province in South Vietnam.  He served with
 the 305th Division of the Viet Minh and
 moved to North Vietnam in 1954.  In April
 1961, Nguyen Viet Le and his unit, the 50th
 Battalion, moved into Laos. He said the unit
 remained in Laos for 2 months, during which
 it  fought  in  four  battles alongside  the
 Pathet Lao.   During these engagements one
 of the battalion's four companies was badly
 mauled and had to be returned to North
 Vietnam.
 The other three companies were assigned
 to South Vietnam.  They arrived in Quang
 Ngai Province in the summer of 1961.  For a
 month they rested and waited for orders.
 They took part in a major action against an
 outpost of the Government of South Viet-
 nam in  September.   Nguyen Viet Le was
 captured during  a battle in  Quang   Ngai
 Province in April 1962.
 5. Nguyen True
 Corp. Nguyen True was born in 1933, the
 son of a farmer in Phu Yen Province in
 South Vietnam.   From 1949 to 1954 he served
 as a courier and then as a guerrilla fighter
 with the Viet Minh.  In early 1955 he board-
 ed a Soviet ship and moved with his unit,
 the 40th Battalion, to North Vietnam.  He
 remained in the army, but in 1959, bothered
 by illness, he went to work on a state farm.
 In August 1962 Nguyen True was notified
 that he was back in the army and that he was
 being sent to South Vietnam.  He reported
 to the Xuan Mai training center and under-
 went 6 months of military and political re-
 education.  His unit was the newly activated
 22d Battalion.  The training course was com-
 pleted in February 1963, but departure for
 South Vietnam was delayed until April.
 For infiltration purposes the battalion was
 divided into two groups.  On April 27, Ngu-
 yen True and his group boarded trucks at
 Xuan Mai.  They went first to Vinh, then on
 to Dong Hoi, and finally to the Laos-North
 Vietnam border.  There they doffed their
 North Vietnamese army uniforms and put on
 black peasants' clothing. The march to the
 south began,  sometimes  in  Lao  territory,
 sometimes in Vietnam.  They passed through
 Thua  Thien   Province, then Quang      Nam,
 Quang Tin, and Quang Ngai, and finally to
 their destination, Pleiku.  Each day they had
 a new guide, generally one of the mountain
 people of the area.
 Nguyen said that he and most of the troops
 who were sent north after the Indochina
 war wanted to.return to their homes and
 rejoin their families.  In August 1963 Nguyen
 True was sent out on a foraging expedition
 to find food for his unit.  He took the oppor-
 tunity to defect to Government forces at An
 Tue in Binh Dinh Province.
 6. Nguyen Cam
 Cam is the son of a farmer in Quang Tin
 Province.  Born in 1929, he joined the Viet-
 minh youth group in his home village in 1946.
 In 1 year he became a guerrilla fighter.  In
 1954, as the Indochina war was drawing to a
 close, he was 'serving with the Vietminh 20th
 Battalion. In May 1955 he went to North
 Vietnam with his unit.
 Ill health caused his transfer to an agri-
 cultural camp in 1958.  By 1960 he was back
 in uniform, serving in the 210th Regiment.
 In May of that year he was assigned to a
 small group that was to set up a metallurgi-
 cal workshop.  Early in 1961 he was sent to
 a metallurgical class in Nghe An Province.
 They were taught a simple form of cast iron
 production, simple blast furnace construc-
 tion, and similar skills. Their instructor was
 an engineer from the Hanoi industrial de-
 partment.
 Their special course completed, Cam and
 his group of 35 men prepared to go to South
 Vietnam.  They went by truck from their
 training center at Nghe An to the Lao bor-
 der.  After 19 days marching through Laos,
 they arrived in the vicinity of Tchepone.
 There they waited for 3 days until food sup-
 plies could be airdropped by a North Viet-
 namese plane.   Nineteen days of walking
 took them to the Laos-South Vietnam bor-
 der.
 Delayed en route by illness, Cam finally
 reached his destination in November 1961.
 It was a secret VC iron foundry in Kontum
 Province.   Several iron one  deposits  were
 nearby, and the hill people had long used
 the iron to make knives and simple tools.
 Cam's job was building kilns to smelt.the
 ore.   The Vietcong hoped to use the iron
 for mines and grenades.
 On August 4,  1963, Sergeant Cam went
 to a nearby village to buy salt for his group.
 On his return he found his comrades had
 gone   to  one of their cultivated fields to
 gather corn, and he joined them.  The group
 was interrupted at their work by a Viet-
 namese ranger company.  After a brief fight
 Cam was taken prisoner.
 7. Nguyen Hong Thai
 Thai, 32 years old, was born and grew up
 in Quang Nkai Province in South Vietnam.
 After service with the Vietminh  we  was
 moved to North Vietnam in 1954.  After 3
 years of military service he was assigned to
 a military farm.  In December 1961 he was
 recalled to his former unit, the 305th Divi-
 sion, and went to the special training camp
 at Xuan Mai in preparation for fighting with
 the Vietcong in South Vietnam..
 Training  began  in  January  1962  and
 lasted for 4 months. The training group,
 designated the 32d Battalion, was composed
 of 650 men who came from various branches
 of the North Vietnamese Army-engineers,
 artillery, airborne, transport, marines, and
 some factory workers and students.  Three-
 fourths of the training was military (guer-
 rilla tactics, ambushes, sabotage, etc.)                                                                                                                                          and
 one-fourth  was  political.   In  the latter,
 heavy emphasis was laid on the necessity
 for armed seizure of power in the south.
 Group 32 was divided into sections and
 began infiltrating to the south on July 14,
 1962.  It moved in three groups.  Thai said
 it took his group more than 55 days to travel
 from North Vietnam through Laos to Quang
 Ngai Province in the south. He reported that
 all the communications and liaison stations
 on the route to South Vietnam are now op-
 erated by the Army of North Vietnam.  Soon
 after his arrival in South Vietnam, That was
 promoted to the rank of lieutenant.  He was
 made a platoon leader in the 20th Vietcong
 Highland Battalion.  In February 1963 the
 unit moved from Quang Nam to Kontum
 Province.
 Combat conditions and the rigors of guer-
 rilla life began to depress Thai.  He said he
 wanted only to rejoin his family and live in
 peace.  In September he asked and received
 permission to visit his family in Quang Ngai.
 When he got home, he surrendered to a South
 Vietnamese Army post.
 8. Dao Kien Lap
 Lap is a civilian radio technician.  He has
 been a member of the Communist Party in
 North Vietnam since 1955.  In February 1963
 he was selected for assignment to South
 Vietnam where he was to work with the
 Liberation Front.  He infiltrated into South
 Vietnam with a group of about 70 civilian
 specialists.  They included doctors, pharma-
 cists,  union  organizers,  radio  specialists,
 propagandists, and youth organizers.  One of
 the infiltrators in Dao's group was a man
 named Binh, publisher of the newspaper
 Labor of the Lao Dong Party.  Another was
 a member of the city soviet of Hanoi.
 The specialists in Dao's group received 3
 months of basic military training at Son
 Tay, and then departed for the south in mid-
 June.  Their orders were to report to the
 central office of the Vietcong in South Viet-
 nam where they would be assigned accord-

 lag to their individual specialties. Dao and
 Binh were to help run a radio station of the
 Liberation Front.
 They traveled through Laos and along the
 Vietnam border.  They had to atop for sev-
 eral weeks In Quang Nam Province to recu-
 perate from their travels. On October 1 they
 were directed by guides to a VC station in
 Ban Me Thuot.
 Dao said he had by then decided to defect
 to the government authorities in the south.
 He set off with one companion, but they were
 separated as they crossed a swiftly flowing
 river.  Dao gave himself up at a government
 post in Ban Me Thuot on October 13, 1963.
 9. Tran Ngoc Linh
 Linh  was  a  Vietcong  senior  sergeant,
 leader of a reconnaissance platoon. He Is the
 son of a middle-class farm family in Tay
 Ninh Province. He served  with the Viet
 Minh against the French and moved to North
 Vietnam in 1954. He spent the next 7 years
 in the North Vietnamese Army.  In Septem-
 ber 1962 Linh was assigned to the Xuan Mai
 training center at Ha Dong to prepare for
 duty in South Vietnam.  His group was given
 a 4-month refresher course in infantry tac-
 tics with emphasis on guerilla fighting.  Then
 he received 6 months of special training in
 the  use of  machineguns  against aircraft.
 Antiaircraft training has become an increas-
 ingly important part of the preparation of
 North  Vietnamese troops  assigned to the
 Vietcong.
 Linh and about 120 others made up the
 406th Infiltration Group commander by Sen-
 ior Capt. Nguyen Van Do. They were divided
 into four platoons. During the final 2 weeks
 of preparation each member of the group
 was issued new equipment-black, pajama-
 like uniforms, a khaki uniform, a hammock,
 mosquito netting, rubber sandals, and other
 supplies, including two packets of medicine.
 In the early morning hours of July 4, 1963,
 his group started its journey from the Xuan
 Mai training center outside Hanoi. The con-
 voy of six Molotov trucks moved south along
 Highway 21 to Nghe An Province and then
 on to Quang Binh.  On July 7 they arrived
 at the final processing station near the Laos-
 North Vietnam border.  There they turned
 in their North Vietnamese Array uniforms
 as well as all personal papers and anything
 else that might identify them as coming from
 the north.  But their departure for the south
 was delayed for several weeks.  In August
 they set off through Laos.
 Twice along the way Linh had to stop at
 liaison stations because of illness. When the
 infiltrators recovered from their illnesses,
 they were formed into special groups to con-
 tinue their penetration into South Vietnam.
 Linh reported being delayed once for 8 days,
 and the second time for 10 dflvs.
 Finally, in the first week of November 1963,
 Linh was sufficiently recovered to begin the
 final leg of his journey to a VC center where
 he was to be assigned to a combat unit.  He
 and three others who had been similarly de-
 layed by attacks of malaria and other sickness
 made up a group.  They moved through the
 jungles of Quang Due Province near the Cam-
 bodian border.  On the morning of Novem-
 ber 9 they crossed the Srepok River.  There
 they ran into a unit of the South Vietnamese
 Army.   One of the infiltrators was killed,
 Linh was taken prisoner, and the other two
 Vietcong escaped.
 These are typical Vietcong.  There are
 many other officers like Tran Quoc Dan, tech-
 nicians like Nguyen Thao, and simple sol-
 diers like Nguyen Truc.  They were born in
 South Vietnam, fought against the French,
 and then went north and served in the army
 of North Vietnam.  They were ordered by the
 Communist rulers in Hanoi to reenter South
 Vietnam. Violating the Geneva accords of
 1954 and 1962, they used the territory of
 neighboring Laos to infiltrate into the South.
 They are the means by which Communist
 North Vietnam is carrying out its program
 of conquest in South Vietnam .3
 0. Infiltration of native North Vietnamese
 The Communist authorities in Hanoi are
 now assigning native North Vietnamese in
 increasing numbers to join the VC forces
 in  South  Vietnam.  Heretofore,  those  in
 charge of the infiltration effort have sought
 to fill their quotas with soldiers and others
 born in the south.  The 90,000 troops that
 moved from South Vietnam to the north
 when the Geneva accords ended the Indo-
 china War have provided an invaluable res-
 ervoir for this purpose.   Now, apparently,
 that source is running dry.  The casualty
 rate has been high, and obviously many of
 those who were in fighting trim 10 years
 ago are no longer up to the rigors of guer-
 rilla war.
 In any case, reports of infiltration by na-
 tive North Vietnamese in significant num-
 bers have been received in Saigon for several
 months.  It is estimated that as many as
 75 percent of the more than 4,400 Vietcong
 who are known to have entered the south
 in the first 8 months of 1964 were natives
 of North Vietnam.
 Vo Thanh Vinh was born in Nghe An Prov-
 ince in North Vietnam in 1936.  He was cap-
 tured by South Vietnamese forces on May 5,
 1964.   He described himself as a military
 security officer.  He infiltrated into South
 Vietnam in April 1964 with a group of 34
 police and security officers from the north.
 Another native North Vietnamese captured
 in the south was VC Pfc. Vo Quyen.   His
 home was in Nam Dinh Province.  He was a
 member of the 2d Battalion of the North
 Vietnamese Army's 9th Regiment. He said
 the entire battalion had infiltrated Into
 South Vietnam between February and May
 last year.  He was captured in an action in
 Quang Tri Province on July 4.  He told in-
 terrogators that the bulk of his unit was
 composed    of  young  draftees from North
 Vietnam.
 Le Pham Hung, also a private, first class,
 was captured on July 7 in Thua Thien
 Province.   He is a native of Nam Dinh in
 North Vietnam.  Drafted for military service
 in May 1963, he was in the 324th Division.
 His group, consisting solely of 90 North
 Vietnamese draftees, infiltrated into South
 Vietnam in May 1964.  He reported that an-
 other  company                                                                        of  the North  Vietnamese
 entered the south at the same time as his
 unit.
 A former member of the 90th VC Battal-
 ion reported that his unit had been rein-
 forced by native North Vietnamese troops
 earlier this year.  Le Thus Phuong, an in-
 formation cadre and a native of Quang Ngai
 Province in the south, surrendered to Gov-
 ernment forces on April 23, 1964.  He said
 that  the  90th  Battalion  had received  80
 North Vietnamese replacements in February.
 A medical technician named Hoang Thung
 was captured in Thus Thien Province on
 July 4, 1964.  He said he had infiltrated into
 the south in late 1963 with a group of 200
 Vietcong, the majority of whom were ethnic
 northerners, 120 of them draftees.
 These reports destroy one more fiction
 which the authorities in Hanoi have sought
 so long to promote-that the fighting in the
 south was a matter for the South Viet-
 namese.  They underline Hanoi's determina-
 tion to press its campaign of conquest with
 every available resource.
 D. Infiltration of Vietcong agents
 No effort to subvert another nation as
 elaborate as that being conducted by the
 Ho Chi Minh regime against South Vietnam
 can succeed without an intelligence-gather-
 Ing organization.  Recognizing this, the au-
 thorities in Hanoi have developed an exten-
 sive espionage effort.  An essential part of
 See app. C for additional details on mili-
 tary infiltrators.
 that effort is the regular assignment of secret
 agents from the north to South Vietnam.
 The heart of the VC intelligence organiza-
 tion is the Central Research Agency in Hanoi.
 (See sec. IV, C.)   Communist agents are
 regularly dispatched from North Vietnam,
 sometimes for brief assignments but often
 for long periods.  Many of these agents move
 into South Vietnam along the infiltration
 trails through Laos;  others are carried by
 boats along the coasts and landed at pre-
 arranged sites.                                                                                                                                    A special maritime infiltra-
 tion group has been developed in North Viet-
 nam, with its operations  centered in  Ha
 Tinh and Quang Binh Provinces just north
 of the 17th parallel.
 1. Maritime Infiltration
 The following case illustrates the methods
 of  maritime  infiltration  of secret agents
 used by the Communist regime of North
 Vietnam.
 In July 1962 a North Vietnamese intelli-
 gence agent named Nguyen Viet Duong be-
 gan training to infiltrate South Vietnam. A
 native southerner, he had fought against the
 French and had gone to North Vietnam after
 the war ended.    Selected for intelligence
 work, he was assigned to the Central Re-
 search Agency in 1959.
 After a period of intensive instruction in
 radio transmission, coding and decoding, and
 other skills of the intelligence trade, he was
 given false identity papers and other sup-
 plies and was transported to the south.  His
 principal task was to set up a cell of agents
 to  collect  military  information.   He flew
 from Hanoi to Dong Hot, and from there the
 Maritime infiltration group took him by boat
 to South Vietnam. That was in August 1962.
 In January 1963 Duong reported to Hanoi
 that he had run into difficulties.  His money
 and papers had been lost, and he had been
 forced to take refuge with VC contacts in an-
 other province.  Another agent was selected
 to go to South Vietnam.  One of his assign-
 ments was to contact Duong, find out details
 of what happened to him, and help Duong
 reestablish himself as a VC agent.   The man
 selected  for  the  task was  Senor  Captain
 Tran  Van      Tan  of  the Central  Research
 Agency.
 Tan had already been picked to go to the
 South to establish a clandestine VC commu-
 nications center.                                                                                                                                    Making contact with Du-
 Ong was one of his secondary assignments.
 After intensive preparations Tan was ready
 to move to South Vietnam in March.  He
 was transferred to an embarkation base of
 the maritime infiltration group just north
 of the 17th parallel.
 He was joined by three other VC agents
 and the captain and three crewmen of the
 boat that would take them south.  All were
 given false identity papers to conform to
 their false names.  They also were provided
 with fishermen's permits, South Vietnamese
 voting cards, and draft cards or military dis-
 charge papers.  The boat captain received a
 boat registration book, crew lists, and sev-
 eral South Vietnamese permits to conduct
 business.
 The  agents and  boatmen  were  given
 cover stories to tell if captured.  Each man
 had to memorize not only the details of his
 own story but the names and some details
 about each of the others.  The agents had
 to become familiar with simple boat proce-
 dures so they could pass as legitimate fisher-
 men.
 The expedition left the embarkation port
 on April 4.  In addition to the four agents
 the boat carried six carefully sealed boxes
 containing a generator, several radios, some
 weapons, and a large supply of South Viet-
 namese currency.  They also carried some
 chemicals and materials for making false
 identification papers.  Their destination was
 a landing site on the coast of Phuoc Tuy
 Province.
 Soon after leaving North Vietnam the VC
 boat encountered high winds and rough seas.

 The internal political divisions and above
 all the inexperience in government of the
 south itself.
 Yet the balance sheet is by no means all
 one sided.
 Our advisory effort, on all fronts, has done
 great things and, in the wide personal rela-
 tionships involved, must stand almost unique
 in the history of relations between an Asian
 nation under fire and an outside Western
 nation.
 Although there are from time to time signs
 of anti-American feeling, working relation-
 ships at all levels remain close and friendly.
 With our help, the Government has been
 able to maintain economic stability and to
 move to help areas secured from the Vietcong.
 Our military effort and' our equipment,
 supplied to the Vietnamese, have largely off-
 set the unfavorable numerical ratio favoring
 the Vietcong.
 The Vietnamese military forces continue
 to fight well. Our own military men consider
 most of them as tough and brave as any in
 the world,  Though there have been military
 reverses; there have also been significant vic-
 tories-which sometimes do not make head-
 lines.  On the Military front, the Vietcong
 is not capable of anything like a Dienbien-
 phu.
 Above all, the Vietnamese people are not
 voting with their feet or their hearts for
 communism.
 As to our basic policy, the alternatives to
 our present courses might be, on the one
 hand, to withdraw or to negotiate on some
 basis such as what is called neutralization,
 or, on the other hand, for the Vietnamese
 and ourselves to enlarge the war, bringing
 pressure to persuade Hanoi, by force, that
 the game they are playing is not worth it.
 It is also suggested that the United Nations
 might be of help.  There may emerge pos-
 sibilities for a U.N. role, but it is not clear
 that the U.N., which has been unable to
 carry through commitments such the Congo,
 would be able to act effectively to deal with
 this far more difficult situation in its present
 form.  And this has been the public judg-
 ment of the U.N. Secretary General, W. U
 Thant.
 As to the basic alternative, so long as
 South Vietnam is ready to carry on the fight,
 withdrawal is unthinkable.  A , negotiation
 that produced a return to the essentials of
 the 1954 accords and thus an independent
 and secure South Vietnam would of course
 be an answer, indeed the answer.  But
 negotiation would hardly be promising that
 admitted communism to South Vietnam, that
 did not.get.Hanoi out, or that exposed South
 Vietnam and perhaps other countries of the
 area to renewed Communist aggression at
 will, with only nebulous or remote guaran-
 tees.
 As for enlarging our own actions, we can
 not speak surely about the future-for the
 aggressors themselves share the responsibility
 for such eventualities.  We have shown in
 the Gulf of Tonkin that we can act, and
 North Vietnam knows it, and knows its own
 weaknesses  But we seek no wider war, and
 we must not suppose that there are quick or
 easy answers in this direction.
 The root of the problem, to repeat, is in
 South Vietnam.  We must persist in our ef-
 forts  there,  with  patience  rather  than
 petulance, coolness rather than recklessness,
 and with a continuing ability to separate the
 real from the merely wished for.
 As a great power, we are now and will
 continue to find ourselves in situations where
 we simply do not have easy choices, where
 there simply are not immediate or ideal solu-
 tions available,  We cannot then allow our-
 selves to yield to frustration, but must stick
 to the job, doing all we can and doing it
 better,
 'I'l e- laiiona ' inf"erests that` have bi6kigiit
 us into the Vietnam struggle are valid, and
 they do not become less so just because the
 going gets rough- and the end is not yet in
 sight.  President Johnson said in his state
 of the Union message: "Our goal is peace in
 southeast Asia.  That will come only when
 aggressors leave their neighbors in peace.
 What is at stake is the cause of freedom.  In
 that cause, we shall never be found wanting."
 AGGRESSION PROM THE NORTH-THE RECORD
 OF NORTH VIETNAM'S CAMPAIGN To CONQUER
 SOUTH VIETNAM
 "Our purpose in Vietnam is to join in the
 defense and protection of freedom of a brave
 people who are under attack that is con-
 trolled and that is directed from outside
 their country." (President Lyndon B. John-
 son, February 17, 1965.)
 - INTRODUCTION
 South Vietnam is fighting for its life
 against a brutal  campaign of terror and
 armed attack inspired, directed, supplied,
 and controlled by the Communist regime in
 Hanoi.  This flagrant aggression has been
 going on for years, but recently the pace
 has quickened and the threat has now be-
 come acute.
 The war in Vietnam is a new kind of
 war, a fact as yet poorly understood in most
 parts of the world.  Much of the confusion
 that prevails in the thinking of many peo-
 ple, and even many governments, stems from
 this basic misunderstanding.  For in Viet-
 nam a totally new brand of aggression has
 been loosed against an independent people
 who want to make their own way in peace
 and freedom.
 Vietnam is not another Greece, where in-
 digenous  guerrilla  forces  used  friendly
 neighboring territory as a sanctuary.
 Vietnam is  n another Malaya, where
 Communist guerrillas were,  for the most
 part,           physically distinguishable  from the
 peaceful majority they sought to control.
 Vietnam is not another Philippines, where
 Communist guerrillas were physically sepa-
 rated from the source of their moral and
 physical support.
 Above all, the war in Vietnam is not a
 spontaneous and local rebellion against the
 established government.
 There are elements in the Communist
 program of conquest directed against South
 Vietnam common to each of the previous
 areas of aggression and subversion.  But
 there is one fundamental difference.  In
 Vietnam a Communist government has set
 out deliberately to conquer a sovereign peo-
 ple in a neighboring state.  And to achieve
 Its end, it has used every resource of its
 own government to carry out its carefully
 planned program of concealed aggression.
 North Vietnam's commitment to seize con-
 trol of the South is no less total than was
 the  commitment of the regime in North
 Korea in 1950.  But knowing the conse-
 quences of the latter's undisguised attack,
 the planners in Hanoi have tried desperately
 to conceal their hand.  They have failed
 and their aggression is as real as that of
 an invading army.
 This report is a summary of the massive
 evidence of North Vietnamese aggression ob-
 tained by the Government of South Viet-
 nam.  This evidence has been jointly ana-
 lyzed by South Vietnamese and American ex-
 perts.
 The evidence shows that the hard core of
 the Communist forces attacking South Viet-
 nam were trained in the north and ordered
 into the south by Hanoi.  It shows that the
 key leadership of the Vietcong (VC), the
 officers and much of the cadre, many of the
 technicians, political, organizers, and propa
 grandists have come from the north and oper-
 ate under Hanoi's direction.  It shows that
 the training of essential military personnel
 and their infiltration "into"the"south is di-
 rected by the military high command in
 Hanoi. (See sec. I.)
 The evidence shows that many of  the
 weapons and much of the ammunition and
 other supplies used by the Vietcong have
 been sent into South Vietnam from Hanoi.
 In recent months new types of weapons have
 been introduced in the VC army, for which
 all  ammunition must come  from  outside
 sources.  Communist China and other Com-
 munist States have been the prime suppliers
 of these weapons and ammunition, and they
 have  been  channeled primarily  through
 North Vietnam. (See sec. II.)
 The directing force behind the effort to
 conquer South Vietnam is the Communist
 Party in the north, the Lao Dong (Workers)
 Party.  As in every Communist State, the
 party is an integral part of the regime itself.
 North Vietnamese  officials  have  expressed
 their firm determination to absorb South
 Vietnam into the Communist world.       (See
 sec. III.)
 Through its central committee, which con-
 trols the government of the north, the Lao
 Dong Party directs the total political and
 military effort of the Vietcong.  The military
 high command in the north trains the mili-
 tary men and sends them into South Viet-
 nam.  The Central Research Agency, North
 Vietnam's central intelligence organization,
 directs the elaborate espionage and subver-
 sion effort.  The extensive political-military
 organization in the north which directs the
 Vietcong war effort is described in sec-
 tion IV.
 Under Hanoi's overall direction the Com-
 munists have established an extensive ma-
 chine for carrying on the war within South
 Vietnam.   The focal point is the Central
 Office for South Vietnam with its political
 and military subsections and other special-
 ized agencies.  A subordinate part of this
 Central Office Is the Liberation Front for
 South Vietnam.  The front was formed at
 Hanoi's order in 1960.  Its principal func-
 tion is to influence opinion abroad and to
 create the false impression that the aggres-
 sion in South Vietnam is an indigenous rebel-
 lion  against  the                                                                                                                                         established  government.
 (See sec. IV.)
 For more than 10 years the people and the
 Government of South Vietnam, exercising the
 inherent right of self-defense, have fought
 back against these efforts to extend Commu-
 nist power south across the 17th parallel.
 The  United States has responded  to  the
 appeals of the Government of the Republic
 of Vietnam for help in this defense of the
 freedom and independence of its land and its
 people.
 In 1961 the Department of State issued a
 report called "A Threat to the Peace."   It
 described North Vietnam's program to seize
 South Vietnam.  The evidence in that report
 had been presented by the Government of
 the Republic of Vietnam to the International
 Control Commission  (ICC).   A special re-
 port by the ICC in June 1962 upheld the
 validity of that evidence. The Commission
 held that there was "sufficient evidence to
 show beyond reasonable doubt" that North
 Vietnam had sent arms and men into South
 Vietnam to carry out subversion with the
 aim of overthrowing the legal government
 there.   The ICC found the authorities in
 Hanoi in specific violation of four provisions
 of the Geneva accords of 19541
 Since then, new and even more impressive
 evidence of Hanoi's aggression has accumu-
 lated.                                                                                                                                                The Government of the United States
 believes that evidence should be presented
 to its own citizens and to the world.  It. Is
 important for freemen to know what has
 been happening in Vietnam, and how, and
 why.     That is the purpose of this report.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE                 March 1
 1. HANOI SUPPLIES THE KEY PERSONNEL FOR THE
 ARMED AGGRESSION AGAINST SOUTH VIETNAM
 The hard core of the Communist forces
 attacking South Vietnam are men trained in
 North Vietnam.  They are ordered into the
 south and remain under the military dis-
 cipline of the military high command In
 Hanoi.  Special training camps operated by
 the North Vietnamese Army gave political
 and military training to the infiltrators.  In-
 creasingly the forces sent into the south are
 native North Vietnamese who have never seen
 South Vietnam.  A special infiltration unit,
 the 70th Transportation Group, is responsible
 for moving men from North Vietnam into the
 south via infiltration trails through Laos.
 Another special unit, the maritime infiltra-
 tion group, spends weapons and supplies
 and agents by sea into the south.
 The infiltration rate has been increasing.
 From 1959 to 1960, when Hanoi was establish-
 ing its infiltration pipeline, at least 1,800
 men, and possibly 2,700 more, moved into
 South Vietnam from the north.  The flow
 incerased to a minimum of 3,700 in 1961 and
 at least 5,400 in 1962.  There was a modest
 decrease in 1963 to 4,200 confirmed infiltra-
 tors, though later evidence is likely to raise
 this figure.
 For 1964 the evidence is still incomplete.
 However, it already shows that a minimum
 of 4,400 infiltrators entered the south, and
 it is estimated more than 3,000 others were
 sent in.                            -
 There is usually a time lag between the
 entry of infiltrating troops and the discovery
 of clear evidence they have entered.  This
 fact, plus collateral evidence of Increased use
 of the infiltration routes, suggests strongly
 that 1964 was probably the year of greatest
 infiltration so far.
 Thus, since 1959, nearly 20,000 VC officers,
 soldiers, and technicians are known to have
 entered South Vietnam under orders from
 Hanoi.  Additional   information   indicates
 that an estimated 17,000 more Infiltrators
 were dispatched to the south by the regime
 In Hanoi during the past 6 years.  It can
 reasonably be assumed that still other infil-
 tration groups have entered the south for
 which there is no evidence yet available,
 To some the level of infiltration from the
 north may seem modest in comparison with
 the total size of the Armed Forces of the Re-
 public of Vietnam.  But one-for-one calcu-
 lations are totally misleading In the kind of
 warfare going on in Vietnam.  First, a high
 proportion of infiltrators from the north are
 well-trained officers, cadres, and specialists.
 Second, it has long been realized that in
 guerrilla combat the burdens of defense are
 vastly heavier than those of attack.  In Ma-
 laya, the Philippines, and elsewhere a ratio
 of at least 10 to 1 in favor of the forces of
 order was required to meet successfully the
 threat, of the guerrillas hit-and-run tactics.
 In the calculus of guerrilla warfare the
 scale of North Vietnamese infiltration into
 the south takes on a very different meaning.
 For the infiltration of 5,000 guerrilla fighters
 in a given year is the'equivalent of marching
 perhaps 50,000 regular troops across the
 border, in terms of the burden placed on the
 defenders.
 Above all, the number of proved and prob-
 able infiltrators from the north should be
 seen in relation to the size of the VC forces.
 It Is now estimated that the Vietcong num-
 ber approximately 35,000 so-called hard-core
 forces, and another 60,000 to 80,000 local
 forces.  It- Is thus apparent that infiltrators
 from the north-allowing for casualties-
 make up the majority of the so-called hard-
 core Vietcong:  Personnel from the north,
 in short, are now and have always been the
 backbone of the entire VC operation.
 It is true that many of the lower level ele-
 ments of the VC forces are recruited within
 South Vietnam. However; the thousands of
 reported cases of VC kidnapings and terror-
 ism make it abundantly clear that threats
 and other pressures by the Vietcong play a
 major part in such recruitment.
 A. The infiltration process
 The infiltration routes supply hard-core
 units with most of their officers and non-
 commissioned personnel.  This source helps
 fill the gaps left by battle casualties, illness,
 and defection and insures continued control
 by Hanoi.  Also, as the nature of the conflict
 has changed, North Vietnam has supplied
 the Vietcong with technical specialists via
 the infiltration routes.  These have included
 men trained in armor and ordnance, anti-
 aircraft, and communications as well as med-
 ical corpsmen and transport experts.
 There is no single infiltration route from
 the north to South Vietnam.  But by far
 the biggest percentage of infiltrators follow
 the same general course.   The principal
 training center for North Vietnamese Army
 men assigned to join the Vietcong has been
 at Xuan Mai near Hanoi.  Recently captured
 Vietcong have also reported an infiltration
 training camp at Thanh Hoa. After comple-
 tion of their training course-which involves
 political and propaganda work as well as
 military   subjects-infiltrating   units   are
 moved to Vinh on the east coast.   Many have
 made stopovers at a staging area in Dong Hof
 where  additional  training  is    conducted.
 From there they go by truck to the Laos
 border.
 Then, usually after several days' rest, in-
 filtrators  move                                                                    southward through  Laos.
 Generally they move along the Laos-South
 Vietnam border.    Responsibility for Infiltra-
 tion from North Vietnam through Laos be-
 longs to the 70th Transportation Group of
 the North Vietnamese Army.   After a time
 the infiltration groups turn eastward, enter-
 ing South Vietnam in Quang Nam, Quang
 Tri.  Thus  Theen, Kontum, or another of
 the border provinces.
 The Communists have established regular
 lanes for infiltration with way stations es-
 tablished about 1 day's march apart.  The
 way stations axe equipped to quarter and
 feed the Vietcong passing through. Infil-
 trators who suffer from malaria or other ill-
 nesses stay at the stations until they recover
 sufficiently to join another passing group
 moving south.
 The map on page 4  not shown in RECORD]
 shows the infiltration route from North Viet-
 nam to the south followed by VC Sgt. Huynh
 Van Tay and a group of North Vietnamese
 Army officers and men in September 1963.
 Tay was captured during an engagement in
 Chuong Thien Province in April 1964.
 Local guides lead the infiltration groups
 along the secret trails.  Generally they di-
 rect the infiltrators from halfway between
 two stations, through their own base sta-
 tion, and on halfway to the next supply base.
 Thus the guides are kept in ignorance of all
 but their own way stations.  Only group
 leaders are permitted to talk with the guides
 In order to preserve maximum security. The
 men are discouraged from asking where they
 are or where they are going.=
 The same system of trails and guides used
 along the Lao infiltration routes is used
 within South Vietnam itself.  Vietcong in-
 filtrators may report directly to a reassign-
 ment center in the highlands as soon as they
 enter South Vietnam.  But in the past year
 or more some groups have moved down trails
 in South Vietnam to provinces    along the
 Cambodian border and near Saigon before re-
 ceiving their unit assignment.  Within South
 Vietnam infiltration and supplies are han-
 dled by VC units such as the Nam Son Trans-
 portation Group.
 At the Laos border crossing point infil-
 trators are reequipped.  Their North Viet-
 namese Army uniforms must be turned in.

 by VC infiltrators Into South Vietnam, see
 app. B.
 They must give up' all personal papers, let-
 ters, notebooks, and photographs that might
 be  incriminating.  Document  control  over
 the infiltrators has been tightened consider-
 ably over the past 2 years.                                                                                                                              A number of
 Vietnamese infiltrators have told of being
 fitted out with Lao neutralist uniforms for
 their passage through Laos.
 Infiltration groups are usually issued a set
 of black civilian pajama-like clothes, two
 unmarked   uniforms,   rubber  sandals,   a
 sweater, a hammock, mosquito netting, and
 waterproof sheeting.  They carry a 3- to 5-
 day supply of food.  A packet of medicines
 and bandages is usually provided.
 The  size  of infiltration  groups   varies
 widely.  Prisoners have mentioned units as
 small as 5 men and as large as 500.    Gen-
 erally the groups number 40 to 50.                                                                                                                                  When
 they arrive in South Vietnam these groups
 are usually split up and assigned to various
 VC units as replacements, although some
 have remained intact.
 B. Military personnel
 The following are individual case histories
 of North Vietnamese soldiers sent by the
 Hanoi regime into South Vietnam.  They are
 only an illustrative group.  They show that
 the leadership and specialized personnel for
 the guerrilla war in South Vietnam consists
 in large part of members of the North Viet-
 nam armed forces, trained in the North and
 subject to the command and discipline of
 Hanoi.
 1. Tran Quoc Dan
 Dan was a VC major, commander of the
 60th Battalion (sometimes known as the 34th
 Group of the Thon-Kim Battalion).  Disil-
 lusioned with fighting his own countrymen
 and with communism and the lies of the
 Hanoi regime, he surrendered to the authori-
 ties in South Vietnam on February 11, 1963.
 At the age of 15 he joined the revolutionary
 army (Viet Minh)  and fought against the
 French forces until 1954 when the Geneva
 accords ended the Indochina war.  As a regu-
 lar in the Viet Minh forces, he was moved to
 North Vietnam.  He became an officer in the
 so-called people's army.
 In March 1962 Major Dan received orders
 to prepare to move to South Vietnam.  He
 had been exposed to massive propaganda in
 the north which told of the destitution of the
 peasants in the south and said that the
 Americans had taken over the French role of
 colonialists.  He said later that an important
 reason for his decision to surrender was that
 he discovered these propaganda themes were
 lies.  He found the peasants more prosperous
 than the people In the north.  And he recog-
 nized quickly that he was not fighting the
 Americans but his own people.
 With the 600 men of his unit, Major Dan
 left Hanoi on March 23, 1962.  They traveled
 through the Laos corridor.  His group joined
 up with the Vietcong 1st Regiment in cen-
 tral Vietnam.
 The 35-year-old major took part in 45 ac-
 tions and was wounded once in an unsuc-
 cessful VC attack on an outpost.  As time
 passed he became increasingly discouraged
 by his experience as a VC troop commander.
 Most of all, he said, hewas tired of killing
 other Vietnamese.  After several months of
 soul-searching he decided to surrender to
 the authorities of the Republic of Vietnam.
 He has volunteered to do "anything to serve
 the national cause" of South Vietnam.
 2. Vo Thoi
 Sgt. Vo Thoi (Communist Party alias Vo
 Bien) was an assistant squad leader in the
 VC Tay Son 22d Battalion.  On the night of
 October 7, 1963, his unit attacked An Tuong
 village in Binh Dinh Province.  After over-
 running the village, Vo's company was as-
 signed to set up an ambush against Repub-
 lic of Vietnam troops rushing to defend the
 village.   In the ensuing fight Vo was seri-
 ously wounded.  He was picked up by local
 farmers and turned over to the authorities.

 the war now by blasting Hanoi and all
 of North Vietnam off the face of the
 earth.. The realists are on. neither side
 of this argument.  The realists oppose
 both solutions, The realistic policy is to
 prepare to stay in South Vietnam for
 years and years and years-no matter
 how long it takes, to outlast the Com-
 munists, to outeducate them, to outwork
 them, to outserve them in the cause of
 peace.
 The difference is between those who
 think we have done too much in South
 Vietnam and the time has come to get
 out or to mount a full-scale invasion of
 the North and those who think we have
 not done enough, and that we have to
 broaden and deepen our commitments-
 especially our economic and social com-
 mitments in Vietnam.
 Mr. President, if we are going to stop
 Communists in South Vietnam or in
 Cambodia or Burma or Malaysia or South
 Korea or the Philippines, it is not going
 to be' easy. Throughout our lifetime and
 very likely throughout the lifetime of
 our children there will be no end of strug-
 gle and sacrifice, of danger and heavy
 cost.  Not because America wants war,
 now or ever, in South Vietnam or any-
 where else, but because the Communists
 and especially the Red Chinese have
 made it clear that they will use war to
 achieve, their ends whenever it suits their
 purpose and because we will oppose this
 gradual Communist conquest in defense
 of freedom.
 . This world contest against communism
 is a struggle we,are not sure to win. We
 could lose. But certainly if we help this
 independent country of South Vietnam
 to maintain its independence, we en-
 hance the prospect of freedom and of
 peace surviving.
 Which is better, Mr. President, to stay
 and slug it out in stalemate in South
 Vietnam or to give in, give up, retreat,
 fall back, and have to slug it out else-
 where in Asia against an encouraged
 and victorious Communist enemy?
 Does any Senator honestly think that
 the Communists will stop with South
 Vietnam, if we give it to them?  Does
 any Senator really think that such a
 course will discourage the Communists
 from continuing this successful course
 until they have all of Asia and push on
 from there?
 And where, Mr. President, is the basis
 for our negotiation now.  What do the
 Communists offer?  Indeed, what will
 they offer, when they are convinced they
 are winning?
 The plain and perhaps brutal truth,
 particularly to those who have urged the
 President to negotiate a settlement, is
 that the Communist camp has given us
 nothing to negotiate short of U.S. with-
 drawal from South Vietnam which would
 open the door to ,a takeover by the Hanoi

 ve engaged in vast, far-reach-
 ing, and successful efforts to help educa-
 tion, health, transportation, and so forth
 in South Vietnam.  This assistance is
 not the kind of thing that enrages or in-
 furiates people.  When they know that
 they have worked with Americans who
 helped them train thousands of teachers,
 develop a pure water system, stop ma-
 laria, and so forth, it seems to me that
 this is an ingredient for support of their
 position.
 The important thing-and here we are
 in agreement with the Vietnamese-is
 not to let the problems in Saigon sap
 our efforts in the deeper struggle against
 the Communists. The two problems are,
 of course, related. Victory over the Com-
 munists is hard to achieve even with a
 otrong central government.  But let us
 not fall into the Communist propaganda-
 fed trap of thinking that a coup in Saigon
 means the South Vietnamese people
 would rather be governed by the Com-
 munists in Hanoi.
 This is a mistake which we make be-
 cause there is a coup resulting from a
 sharp difference of opinion among mili-
 tary leaders, all of whom agree on vigor-
 ously opposing the North Vietnamese and
 Vietcong. Certainly it seems to me it is
 not, a basis for assuming that our posi-
 tion in South Vietnam is not supported
 by the South Vietnamese.
 It, would be the peak of irony if our
 own` will were to weaken as a result of
 South Vietnam's internal political prob-
 lems, for this would deliver to the enemy
 precisely what they desire.  The Com-
 munists' methods of conquest are politi-
 cal as well as military.  Whatever the
 means, the result is the same, as far
 as they are concerned: the takeover
 of South Vietnam, a goal they have
 sought-and we have opposed-for over
 10 years.
 If the Communists can take over in
 type of Communist offensive of Infiltra-
 tion, subversion, and guerrilla activities
 supported externally.  The long view of
 the study of history indicates that ap-
 peasement or withdrawal in the face of
 aggression has never been conducive to
 the establishment of a lasting peace.
 As the Senator from Wisconsin has so
 ably pointed out, in our dealings in Viet-
 nam, we must again apply the principle
 that unless we are willing, now, to take
 the risks involved-and we are all cog-
 nizant of the risks involved-in drawing
 the line in South Vietnam, we shall have
 to draw it somewhere. I, for one, would
 like to see it drawn in South Vietnam,
 rather than in Thailand, in Malaysia, in
 the Philippines, in Hawaii, or in San
 Francisco and Seattle.
 For those who have questioned the
 policy of this country, I believe that it
 would be well for all Senators, as well as
 for the people of this country, to recall
 that Congress in Public Law 88-408, last
 session, set forth, in speaking of the
 attacks in South Vietnam :
 Whereas these attacks are part of a de-
 liberate and systematic campaign of aggres-
 sion that the Communist regime in North
 Vietnam has been waging against its neigh-
 bors and the nations joined with them in the
 collective defense of our freedom;
 In the "Resolved" part of the resolu-
 tion it is further stated:
 The United States is, therefore, prepared
 as the President determines to take all neces-
 sary steps including the use of armed force
 to assist any member or protocol state of the
 Southeast Asia Defense Treaty requesting as-
 sistance in defense of its freedom.
 That is what we are doing. As to the
 question that has been asked as to what
 we will do in the future, the resolution

 Furthermore, there is no sense in nego-

 assurance that the people with whom
 we negotiate toward an agreement will
 carry out the agreement.
 It is obvious from the study of the
 history of that problem that all that is
 necessary for peace to come to that trou-
 bled area of the world is for the Commu-
 nists in Hanoi and elsewhere to fulfill
 the agreements they entered into 1954
 and again 1962.
 Therefore, for one, wish to uphold the
 hand of the President of the United
 States, who is the leader of the free
 world.  He has a full understanding of
 the facts, which perhaps many of us
 do not have, because he has the means
 by which he can learn them.  Further-
 more, I am confident that he under-
 stands the grave and serious meaning of
 what is going on in southeast Asia as it
 relates to the protection of this country's
 interests and to the protection of the
 peace and security of the world.
 Therefore, I am happy to have the
 opportunity to associate myself with the
 remarks of the distinguished Senator
 from Wisconsin, and to commend him
 for the very lucid explanation of the
 problem in that area and its history and
 what needs to be done about it.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  I thank the Sena-
 tor from Oklahoma [Mr. HARRIS] for a
 remarkable statement, impromptu and
 off the cuff, very thoughtful and well or-
 ganized, and certainly most appropriate.
 I deeply. a ppreciate his support in this
 matter.
 AMERICAN GOALS
 What then are our goals?  As I see it,
 Mr. President, they are three in number:
 First. Peace-an end to the fighting
 and terror in South Vietnam.
 Does anyone question that goal? Why
 are we there?  The only other reason
 why countries engage in this kind of war
 is that they want to annex territory, or
 to gain some kind of economic advan-
 tage. We do not want anything of that
 kind.  Does anyone believe that Presi-
 dent Eisenhower, President Kennedy, or
 President Johnson had any other objec-
 tive at all except to achieve peace and
 freedom, recognizing that if we do not
 fight there we shall have to fight else-
 where?
 Second. Preservation of the freedom of
 the South Vietnamese people to develop
 according to their own wishes, free from
 outside interference.
 No one can say we are dominating the
 Government of South Vietnam.  If we
 had dominated it, perhaps there would
 not have been all the coups that have
 taken place.
 We have not attempted to dictate to
 the Government. No one can charge us
 with trying to interfere.
 Third. An end to the spread of com-
 munism by force in southeast Asia-a
 program fostered and supported by Red
 China and one which poses a serious
 threat to our American security.

 attitude..
 Mr. SIMPSON.  I thank the Senator
 from Wisconsin for his learned discus-
 sion,               In the main I agree with his entire
 speech, but I am in disagreement with
 him on this particular point.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  I thank the distin-
 guished Senator from Wyoming very
 much.
 We are there in response to the request
 of a native, indigenous government seek-
 ing to preserve itself against aggression.
 We are not involved in Vietnam in pur-
 suit of national military alms. Secretary
 of State Dean Rusk recently pointed out
 that in 1959 "no foreign nation had bases
 or fighting forces in South Vietnam.
 South Vietnam was not a member of any
 alliance. If it was a threat to North Viet-
 nam it was because its economy far out-
 shone the vaunted Communist paradise
 to the north."
 . Much of this- progress represents the
 fruits of. economic aid furnished by the
 United . States.  While there has been
 much discussion of military aid we have
 sent to South Vietnam, it is important
 to recognize that our military, aid has
 been defensive in nature.  Our forces
 there have been advisory.  Until the
 provocations of recent months, American
 servicemen were engaged almost exclu-
 sively in training and advisory posi-
 tions.
 When American forces participated in
 any combat action, with the exception of
 the limited air strikes, their efforts were
 defensive.  The air strikes themselves
 were defensive in that they were designed
 to deter further aggression, not to expand
 the war.
 Last night at the Leipzig Trade Fair
 Soviet Premier Kosygin said:
 I haven't read the American white book.
 It cannot be a white book, but rather a black
 book.,  The dirty acts of the Americans in
 Vietnam cannot be put down in a white book.
 Mr. President, disregarding the dirty
 acts of the Soviet Union, with which his-
 tory is replete ever since the Soviet has
 been in power in Russia, what is the real
 American story in Vietnam? Our record
 is South Vietnam is a great record. Of
 course, it has not been talked about by
 Premier Kosygin, the Red Chinese, or the
 Red North Vietnamese. But the tragedy
 is that it has not been talked about
 much by U.S. Senators either.  It is a
 peaceful record, an amazingly peaceful
 record, for which, the only precedent is
 the American, people's peaceful attempts
 at international. assistance and our an-
 swer to appeals from other nations in the
 world since World War II.
 SOLID U.S. RECORD OF PEACEFUL AID
 A study of our record in South Viet-
 nam shows clearly our peaceful inten-
 tions-and more than intentions-a re-
 markable working for peace.
 Much of our effort there has been eco-
 nomic and technical, to build the coun-
 try's agricultural and industrial econo-
 mies,
 Our support in South Vietnam has
 stressed education, health, and com-
 munity development.  Since 1962 alone
 we have spent more than $228 million in
 food-for-peace shipments to South Viet-
 nam-and. Kosygin talks about a dirty
 record and about a black book of Ameri-
 can performance in South Vietnam.
 During the same period, counting es-
 timated expenditures for this year, our
 economic aid will total $599,800,000. And
 since 1955, again counting estimated ex-
 penditures for 1965, we have committed
 $2.8 billion in nonmilitary economic aid.
 Compare that with the record of the
 Soviet Union anywhere in the world.
 This is a. record of generosity, a record
 of  help  and  peaceful,  constructive
 assistance.
 What programs are these funds sup-
 porting?                                                                 Do they represent a threat to
 the security of North Vietnam?
 DETAILS OF U.S. AID
 Illustrative of the social and economic
 activities being implemented with United
 States help are-
 Introduction of improved varieties of
 pigs and construction of improved pig-
 pens.  This is the kind of thing that
 helps the peaceful agriculture economy
 in South Vietnam.
 . Teaching the primitive Montagnard
 tribal people how to use water buffalo as
 beasts of burden rather than as sacri-
 ficial animals.  The Montagnards are
 people somewhat different from the rest
 of the South Vietnamese. They are more
 primitive people, and from all records
 they have a deep affection, admiration
 and gratitude to the American people.
 They are also fine fighters.
 Developing and helping build a variety
 of simple, economical and practical de-
 vices which will improve the life of rural
 people, such as water wheels for irriga-
 tion purposes.
 Introduction of wooden windmills.
 Introduction of cheap, locally made
 hydrojet well drilling rigs.
 Helping the Vietnamese to build simple
 and inexpensive hamlet school buildings.
 Assisting hamlet leaders in planning,
 selection and mobilization of support for
 self-help projects.
 Training  teachers  in  agricultural
 methods.
 When I said thousands of man-years,
 I meant that'. Thousands of man-years
 have been spent to help the economy of
 South Vietnam.  These teachers will
 then form demonstration teams to teach
 improved agricultural practices to peas-
 ants.
 . Introduction of fertilizer, which has
 often doubled yields.
 Introduction of improved varieties of
 crops which are suited, to the climate and
 soil, such as onions, sweetpotatoes, and
 corn.  That Is the American record. of
 South Vietnam,
 In addition to stimulating rural prog-
 ress, the economic aid has laid the
 groundwork for substantial economic,
 educational and social progress in urban
 areas.
 U.S. EDUCATIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS
 Some of these achievements include-
 Vocational education: This American
 Nation of ours has built and equipped a
 central polytechnic institution and three
 secondary-level polytechnic schools in
 South Vietnam.  The United States has
 reequipped six other vocational schools.
 We have provided technical assistance
 for nine rural 2-year trade schools.  In
 1955, there were only 1,700 students.
 Now there are 7,000 students enrolled in
 vocational schools receiving American
 assistance in South Vietnam.
 General  education:  America  has
 helped  build  four  teacher-training
 schools-one at Saigon, two in the prov-
 inces and one designed for Montagnard
 teachers. Americans are right now en-
 gaged in helping train more than 2,000
 prospective teachers in these schools.
 We have helped build some 900 ham-
 let  classrooms  since  mid-1962.  We
 helped build 3,590 elementary class-
 rooms and 282 secondary classrooms
 earlier.  Over 1,000 teachers have at-
 tended a 90-day training course with
 American help. We have helped train
 over  4,000  teachers  at  vocational
 workshops.  Enrollment in elementary
 schools has increased from 300,000 in
 1955 to 1,400,000 in 1963.  More than 3
 million textbooks have been published.
 That is the kind of record that Kosy-
 gin calls a dirty record, best reflected in
 a "black book."
 U.S. HEALTH AID
 Health: This American Nation of ours
 in pursuit of a strong, peaceful South
 Vietnam has helped establish and stock
 12,500 villages and hamlets.  Each sta-
 tion has been staffed with a local person
 trained with American help in first aid
 and health courses.  A malaria eradica-
 tion program, financed by the United
 States, has resulted in a drop in the
 malaria incidence rate from 7.22 percent
 in 1958 to .77 percent in 1962.
 That was in only 51 years.  In other
 words, a 7 percent malaria incidence was
 reduced to less than 1 percent, thanks to
 an American-financed health program.
 Public administration: With American
 help the National Institute of Adminis-
 tration, which will graduate some 350
 qualified civil servants annually, has been
 built and staffed.  We have assisted in
 establishing training centers for village
 officials in 21 provincial centers.
 U.S. INDUSTRIAL ASSISTANCE
 Transportation: With American help
 substantial progress has been made in all
 areas                                                                     of  transportation. We  have
 helped build 272 miles of roads in South
 Vietnam.  A $7.7 million United States'
 loan financed the purchase of equipment
 for the Vietnam National Railway sys-
 tem.  American funds provided eight
 dredges to keep water arteries open. We
 financed a 10,000-foot jet runway at
 Saigon airport.
 Water supply: Americans helped to
 drill more than 1,400 wells that will pro-
 vide clean, fresh, sanitary water for
 750,000 rural inhabitants.  Thanks to
 America, fresh water will be supplied to
 some 500,000 urban dwellers through the
 installation of water systems in 35 cities.
 .Electric, power: In pursuit of an Inde-
 pendent, peaceful South Vietnam, we
 have helped provide the chief province
 and district towns with the electric power
 of 162 diesel generating units.  We will
 step up this program.
 This is the kind of peaceful, strong
 economy we are building in South Viet-
 nam. The reason why the Communists
 are invading is that they cannot afford
 to. have another show window. for the
 West, a window to show how people can

 A $12.7 million AID-American-loan
 is being used to construct a 33,000 kilo-
 watt powerplant In the Saigon metropol-
 itan area. When the plant is completed
 shortly it will be a boon to industrial
 users who are now often dependent on
 costly individual diesel generators.
 Industry: About 13,000 workers are
 employed in 50 new factories, built with
 American aid.  South Vietnam is now
 largely self-sufficient in the spinning and
 weaving of cotton textiles as a result of
 this U.S. program.
 Communications:  We  have  helped
 build a national network of seven major
 radio stations. With American help 6,000
 community listening centers were estab-
 lished.        A modern microwave telecom-
 munications system is nearing comple-
 tion, which will give Saigon telephone
 connection with, the principal towns of
 the Delta provinces.
 What a brilliant and proud record of
 constructive contributions to peace this
 story of American services in South
 Vietnam represents.  We have devoted
 ourselves unstintingly to education and
 health, to the patient, peaceful develop-
 ment essential to independence for this
 country.
 This is the story that has not been
 told in the headlines of violence, murder,
 coups, and retaliation in South Vietnam.
 But this is the big American story.
 V.S. PEACEFUL AID VS COMMUNIST _.TERROR
 I detailed these programs to point out
 that not one of them-not a single one-
 can be in any way interpreted as pro-
 viding a threat to the North Vietamese
 Government or people. There should be
 no doubt of this.
 Let there be no doubt on another score.
 The Communists in North Vietnam are
 responsible for the aggression against
 South Vietnam. They direct and supply
 it; if they desire they can bring it to an
 end.  Recent evidence makes it clear
 that a majority, possibly as much as
 three-fourths,  of hard-core  Vietcong
 strength in South Vietnam comes from
 the north..
 North, Vietnam provides nearly all the
 more sopl7lsticated weaponry used by the
 Vietcong, such as high-caliber guns, mor-
 tars, and antiaircraft weapons. The evi-
 dence is that the flow of men and equip-
 ment from North Vietnam increased in
 1954, and continues to increase.
 Those who have been criticizing our
 policy in South Vietnam are quick to
 argue that, after all, the Americans have
 installed more weaponry in South Viet-
 nam than North Vietnam has sent in,
 more than the Vietcong has supplied.
 Of course we have. But what a differ-
 ence: We are sending in our weaponry
 to defend South Vietnam because its duly
 constituted governments have asked us
 to do so.  The other side is supplying
 theirs to subvert, dominate, overwhelm,
 and control that country.
 Along with the men and equipment
 comes command and strategy, and the
 basic training and guidance in the sordid
 arts of guerrilla warfare.  Hanoi's sup-
 plies, direction, support and inspiration
 are crucial to the continuation of the
 Vietcong campaign against the south.
 Faced with this kind of attack It Is
 hardly surprising  that the fledgling
 country of South Vietnam has had its
 share of problems. It ishard enough for
 a new nation to govern successfully un-
 der the best of conditions.  Fighting a
 counterinsurgency ware imposes enor-
 mous additional burdens.
 POLITICAL INSTABILITY
 The weakest part of the situation in
 South Vietnam is its political instability.
 This is a really vulnerable position. The
 distinguished Senator from New York
 is correct in asking the question.- It is a
 question that is extremely difficult to
 answer. How can we determine whether
 the people of South Vietnam really sup-
 port our position?  But, of course, this
 is what the Communists are working
 toward.
 One consequence of the difficulties has
 been the chronic political instability of
 the central government in Saigon.  A
 succession of coups has installed one gov-
 ernment after another, creating an im-
 pression that is both bewildering and dis-
 turbing to those of us who are used to
 having our governments assume office as
 a result of elections, not coups-and
 every 4 years, not eight times in 16
 months.
 This political instability is a serious
 matter, both because it Interferes with
 successful prosecution of the war against
 the Vietcong and because it makes it
 harder to build a better life for the peo-
 ple of South Vietnam.  We are doing
 what we can to aid the cause of political
 unity and stability in South Vietnam-
 but this is an area in which we can play
 only a limited role.
 Mr. McGEE.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator from Wisconsin yield?
 Mr. PROXMIRE. I am glad to yield.
 Mr. McGEE. I commend the Senator
 from Wisconsin for the focus of his com-
 ments on Vietnam.  So much informa-
 tion is on the loose today that it seems
 to me that an attempt is being made to
 reduce the question to very simple
 terms-to jump to the conclusion, for
 example, that the people in South Viet-
 nam do not approve of the government
 in Saigon.  Like the Senator from Wis-
 consin, I share the view, first, that we
 cannot know for certain.  There is no
 way we can measure in South Vietnam.
 It is difficult enough to measure here,
 sometimes; but as Winston Churchill
 once reminded us, we are not conducting
 a foreign policy with a thermometer in
 one hand and a George Gallup poll in the
 other. We have to take policy positions
 because they are fundamental in the na-
 tional interest.
 I doubt very much whether the posi-
 tion of the Montagnards, vis-a-vis the
 United States, is not to operate their own
 government.
 The instability of the Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment is a headache.  Its uncertain-
 ties create frustrations for us.  But it
 seems to me that that is not the major
 criterion.  The black marketeers and
 the monarchy were headaches to us in
 Greece.  But that did not deter us from
 holding off the Communists so that the
 Greek people themselves could improve
 their lot and improve their position.
 I say that we ought to get our ducks
 in the right kind of order, to borrow an
 old cliche; that is, to put first things
 first.  The first thing is to keep the
 forces from the north from forcibly in-
 truding their influence and the impact.
 of their force on the land to the south.
 I suspect that the mistake we made, in
 part, was in trying to equate Saigon with
 Washington, in a political sense; trying
 to imagine that because we have democ-
 racy, the Vietnamese can have democ-
 racy.  They have only recently emerged
 from generations of colonial domination
 by one great power after another.  On
 the other hand., democracy is one of the
 most difficult, sophisticated, and compli-
 cated arts of government.
 We have been working at it for nearly
 200 years ourselves. We still have a lit-
 tle way to go.  We-tried to spoon-feed
 democracy to the Germans, who were a
 very sophisticated political people fol-
 lowing World War I.  The Weimar re-
 gime went down the drain.  Democracy
 is something that one must learn. One
 must grow up with it.
 I submit that the ingredients for de-
 mocracy will not be present in Vietnam
 for a long time to come.  Probably we
 shall see in the Senator's lifetime, and
 mine, little but a succession of one kind
 of dictatorship after another, in that
 part of the world.
 While we do not like that, in compari-
 son with our own experience, I thing it
 is a fair substitute to achieve that kind
 of success, to win them over to preserv-
 ing their national independence.
 I think the Senator has done well to
 place stress on the importance of keeping
 first things first.
 I have been to Vietnam only twice.
 Both times I was In the jungles, and in
 the areas where the fighting was going
 on. I was struck by the warm reception
 and almost the worship that many of
 these Montagnards have for the Ameri-
 cans who are living with them, and help-
 ing them meet their day-to-day prob-
 lems. This is the kind of story that we
 are not relating frequently enough.  I
 have talked to American boys who have
 just come back from some of the Viet-
 namese villages.  They want to go back
 again.
 These are matters that are often omit-
 ted for the sake of tradition and having
 a contrast between "good guys" and "bad
 guys," truth and falsehood, and peace
 and war.  Most of the story is impor-
 tant in that area.
 I hope the Senator will pursue, on
 other fronts, the approach he has taken
 in the Senate to stress what happens to
 have gone right in Vietnam, what hap-
 pens to have been on the constructive and
 historical side of the picture in terms of
 making improvement in Vietnam.
 These people were not expected to last
 beyond 1954, when they became inde-
 pendent.  They were given 12 months'
 time, and then they were expected to
 fold up. But here we are, nearly 11
 years later.  They are still going for-
 ward, and I suspect from the kind of de-
 termination that is theirs, and the kind
 of determination that President Johnson
 has manifested with regard to his own
 policy position, that they will be there
 for all time to come.

 purposes-has been directed toward our
 peaceful goal of building a solid and
 stable South Vietnam.
 For years our Vietnam policy has been
 carefully, and sometimes painfully, de-
 signed, to avoid overt military action by
 American soldiers.  This has been-done
 in spite of the most serious and con-
 tinuous provocation.
 Even following the Tonkin Gulf and
 Pleiku incidents the President had con-
 fined our retaliation in size. He has
 limited it to military targets and he has
 limited its duration and made it appro-
 priate to the provocation.
 These are not the reactions of a Presi-
 dent or an administration interested in
 extending the war, or of developing a big
 war.  It is the obvious reaction of an
 administration deeply interested in se-
 curing peace.' Above all, he has an-
 nounced that the retaliation was for the
 sole purpose of preventing further ag-
 gression.
 LONG RECORD OF NORTH VIETNAM AGGRESSION
 To understand what is happening in
 Vietnam-and what is at stake in the
 whole of southeast Asia-it is necessary
 to go back to the fundamentals of the
 situation: to the history of Communist
 efforts to capture South Vietnam and our
 commitment to prevent this from hap-
 pening.
 The root of the problem is well known.
 From the time of the Geneva Confer-
 ence in 1954, the Communist authorities
 in North Vietnam planned and expected
 to take over the area south of the 17th
 parallel. At first, they probably believed
 South Vietnam would fall to them like
 an overripe fruit, theirs for the pluck-
 ing, as a result of failure to achieve in-
 ternal. stability and unity in the South.
 But their fond hopes were thwarted by
 the progress achieved by South Vietnam
 in the areas of political stability-this
 was at the beginning-and economic de-
 velopment.
 In these fields, the South soon out-
 stripped the North.  From the first, it
 was clear that whatever internal prob-
 lems South Vietnam had, they were
 united in their opposition to falling un-
 der the Communist domination of Hanoi.
 By 1956, South Vietnam had become a
 self-governing republic and had assumed
 its place in the family of nations.
 Thwarted in their initial hopes of easy
 conquest, the Communists undertook a
 campaign of terror and subversion aimed
 at undermining the South Vietnamese
 Government and social structure.  By
 1959, a war of covert aggression was well
 underway.  Without openly declaring
 war, the Hanoi government began to in-
 filtrate guerrilla fighters and military
 equipment from the north, supplement-
 ing a base of loyal Communists who had
 stayed behind and gone underground af-
 ter the 1954 accords. Any thought that
 this was a small effort which would soon
 end was quickly shown to be false.
 In this confusing situation, we cannot
 argue-and I do not believe that any per-
 son;. devoted to the administration has
 argued-that all the invasion is from
 outside.  There are fifth columnists liv-
 ing in South Vietnam.  They, too, in-
 elude a substantial and significant part
 of the Vietnamese population.

 nam at this moment, compared with 26,-
 000 Americans over there. Furthermore,
 for every casualty we have suffered, the
 South Vietnamese themselves have suf-
 fered at least 10 casualties.   Also, it
 should be remembered, that for every
 South Vietnamese soldier who has been
 wounded or killed in combat, the South
 Vietnamese  soldiers  have  killed  or
 wounded two Vietcongs.
 When some people say that the Viet-
 namese are not fighting for their coun-
 try, it seems to me that statement is dis-
 proved by the ratio of their killing or
 wounding two Vietcongs for every cas-
 ualty that they suffer. To me that indi-
 cates that the South Vietnamese are
 doing a pretty good Job of fighting for
 their country.
 Mr.  PROXMIRE.  The  Senator  is
 absolutely correct.  I might point out,
 also, that not only have the South Viet-
 namese engaged In this very difficult war
 for many years, but they have also suf-
 fered the infiltration and Intimidation
 and terror that is so remote from any
 experience that we have ever had, in
 which the mayors or the leaders of their
 little hamlets are tortured and murdered,
 and even the South Vietnamese children
 of local officials are tortured and mur-
 dered to break the continued will to re-
 sist.
 We must not lose sight of this kind of
 terror, torture, and murder.
 As the distinguished Senator from
 Louisiana has said, the South Vietnamese
 soldiers are fighting and are fighting well
 and Inflicting more casualties on the in-
 filtrators and invaders than they are
 themselves suffering.  That Is not the
 conduct of people who are not willing to
 support their friends and defend their
 nation. This, I believe, is the real answer
 to the question raised by the Senator
 from New York [Mr. JAVITS].
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana. If our coun-
 try should pull out, we would be running
 out on hundreds of thousands of coura-
 geous fighting men who are fighting on
 our side, with the result that those peo-
 ple would have no hope of being able to
 continue their fight against the Com-
 munist aggression.
 Red China knows that it would con-
 front the United States if it got into the
 war.  Does the Senator have any doubt
 that Red China would be using every
 method of subversion and infiltration
 available to that country if they felt the
 United States would stay completely out?
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  The Senator from
 Louisiana raises an excellent point that
 I had not thought of. If it were not for
 our presence in South Vietnam, there is
 no question that the rich ricefields of
 South Vietnam and its potentially very
 rich economy would induce the hungry
 Chinese to move down, in view of their
 philosophy that war should be an instru-
 ment of foreign policy.
 The Red Chinese have a very militant
 kind of government, which would not
 hesitate to do exactly what the Senator
 has suggested, if it were not confronted
 with the kind of language it understands,
 and that is the language of real military
 power.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, I have had an opportunity to read
 through the first part of the Senator's
 speech, and I regret that -I have not had
 an opportunity to read all of It.  I agree
 with the portion of the speech that I
 have been able to read, and I am sure
 that I would also agree with the Sena-
 tor's entire presentation.
 I should like to ask the Senator this
 question.  If we were to pull out and
 start running, can the Senator tell me
 where we are supposed to fight, in view
 of the fact that we have been trusted
 by people who have 600,000 men fighting
 in this war, in behalf of a cause that is
 very dear to our heart?
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  The Senator raises
 a good point.  It would be far better, in
 my opinion, if the war were to end in a
 stalemate in South Vietnam, or if it were
 necessary for us to stay there 5'or 10 or
 15 years, than to retreat and fight else-
 where.  If the Communists can win this
 kind of war of intimidation and violence
 and infiltration, they will not stop. Why
 should they stop, when they will have
 been rewarded?  They will continue.
 Our present policy of standing up to the
 Communists is by far the best way to
 achieve peace.
 -Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  If we pro-
 ceed to limit ourselves to fighting the
 war on the enemy's terms, after we have
 suffered two or three hundred American
 casualties, and then proceed to say the
 price is too high and desert this friendly
 government and put it in the position of
 being forced to surrender the 600,000
 well-armed troops into the hands of the
 enemy, can the Senator from Wiscon-
 sin tell me what the attitude of the
 Communists would be the next time they
 started to infiltrate a friendly nation?
 Would they not say, "If we inflict a few
 casualties on the Americans"-and they
 have been relatively light casualties, if
 we relate them to the kind of casualties
 that we have been accustomed to suffer-
 ing when we have decided to fight-
 "they will lose their nerve and courage"?
 Is it not true that the Communist doc-
 trine is to take over the whole world,
 including this country, and that that
 doctrine, particulary on the part of the
 Chinese Communists, which is voiced by
 Hanoi, is that there must be no coexist-
 ence, that they must stop at nothing un-
 til they have taken over the whole world,
 and that the sooner they do it the better?
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  I could not agree
 more with the distinguished Senator
 from Louisiana.  These are dangerous
 policies on our part, but any policies that
 we could follow would be dangerous.
 We are making a sacrifice.  It is a ter-
 rible thing when American men lose
 their lives.  The expense is very great.
 But after all, considering the strength
 and wealth of this country the burden is
 on us in Vietnam is relatively light, not
 heavy. If we must give in, if we cannot
 win under those circumstances, light as
 this burden is, If we have to complain of
 a burden when we have tax cuts at
 home, when our personal income has
 never been higher, when the foreign aid
 bill is being cut, and the defense budget
 is being cut-if we cannot bear this kind
 of burden, the Communists will not be
 stopped.  Of course, they will continue.
 Mr. SIMPSON.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator from Wisconsin yield?
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  I am delighted to
 yield to the Senator from Wyoming.
 Mr. SIMPSON.  I have had the ad-
 vantage of reading the script of the
 speech of the Senator from Wisconsin.
 In the main, I agree with him whole-
 heartedly. He has done his usually good
 job. He is very articulate and persuasive.
 One portion of his speech disturbs me,
 and I should like to have the Senator
 address himself to that portion.  The
 Senator stated:
 Even following the Tonkin Gulf and Pleiku
 incidents the President has confined our re-
 taliation  in  size,  limited  it  to                                                                                         military
 targets, limited its duration and made it
 appropriate to the provocation.
 And above-all, he has announced that the
 retaliation was for the sole purpose of pre-
 venting further aggression.
 Does the Senator believe that we can
 only fight up to the strength of opposi-
 tion and then lie by waiting for the
 enemy to gain new strength?  Let us
 take the example of a prizefighter in the
 ring.  He does not merely retaliate in
 kind.  He pours on the heat and tries
 to win the bout by his own force. In the
 instance about which we are speaking, it
 would be the full force of arms.
 It seems to this cat-and-mouse busi-
 ness is bad for America. If we are in a
 war, why do we not conclude it?  We
 have the strength and power to do so.
 Why do we not conclude it and restore
 peace to South Vietnam, even at the risk
 of a great loss to the North Vietcong?
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  The question of the
 Senator from Wyoming is very helpful.
 It is helpful because it defines what I
 believe Is the position taken by the ad-
 ministration under the circumstances
 and the position taken by other people
 who feel that we should undertake an all-
 out effort and do whatever is necessary
 in order to win, even if winning should
 mean an invasion of North Vietnam-
 and, in my judgment, it might very well
 under those circumstances mean draw-
 ing China in and being involved in a
 major war on the continent.  There are
 many well-informed and able people like
 the Senator from Wyoming who take
 that position.  I do not take that posi-
 tion.  It seems to me that is clearly not
 the position at the present time of the
 administration.  The position of the ad-
 ministration at the present time appears
 to be that we are not trying to win un-
 conditional surrender of North Vietnam,
 let alone China or Russia.  Many people
 feel we should never have settled for the
 qualified termination of hostilities that
 we did in Korea, and that we should have
 insisted on unconditional surrender in
 Korea.
 Others-and I think more wisely-
 have felt that that was the only way we
 could settle the problem without in-
 volving ourselves in a catastrophic war
 on the continent of Asia that would have
 been endless or would have required our
 use of nuclear weapons.
 I am inclined to feel that the position
 which the administration is taking in
 South Vietnam is a halfway position
 It is not a position that would go all out
 and use all of our weapons, including our
 nuclear weapons, and whatever else is
 necessary, in order to win.  The admin-
 istration is taking a position that we

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 In sumplary, Mr. President, I would
 like to commend the senior Senator
 from New York for the questions which
 he raised ten days ago because I have for
 him the highest admiration and affection.
 The Senator has made an effective con-
 tribution to the debate on Vietnam.
 I express the hope that he will elabo-
 rate his thoughts, as I am sure he will,
 and that he will shed further light on how
 we may best go about finding the answers,
 not only to the questions which he raises,
 but also to the larger questions of a dura-
 ble peace in Vietnam and southeast Asia,
 as a whole
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield so that I may respond?
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President. I
 shall yield, but I shall yield very briefly.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I have
 asked witnesses many questions in my
 day.  On' occasion, I have been asked
 questions, and sometimes as a lawyer I
 have said, "I am glad you asked me that
 question."
 I am very much reminded of that, as
 the Senator has made a very well pre-
 pared statement in response to a question
 which I asked him,
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, if
 the Senator will yield briefly, these re-
 marks were prepared a week ago Friday,
 in response to. questions raised the pre-
 ceding day by the Senator from New
 York on this floor.
 Mr. JAVITS. 'I thank, my colleague,
 but I am prepared to deal with this
 question.  I should like to do so very
 briefly.
 I believe there are ways of finding out
 about and reporting to the American
 people the will to resist by the South
 Vietnamese.  We hear of more or less
 sporadic attempts to resist in one area or
 another in South Vietnam, but they are
 quite diffused.  We do not see an ac-
 curate map of areas of resistance.  I
 think the President, or his spokesmen,,
 could do something about locating these
 areas, so it could be pointed out to the
 American people just how much of this
 country is really controlled by the Viet-
 cong and what other areas are in control
 of the South Vietnamese.  Just how
 much is there left of the strategic hamlet
 ,program, for ' example, which we have
 supported with' a considerable amount
 of money?  This is a very important
 question?
 In addition, there is a large complex of
 'activity to get us out which certain
 :Buddhists have engaged in that affects
 the results as far as the Americans are
 concerned and as far as the South Viet- are concerned.
 I believe a finding on the will to resist
 in South Vietnam would be very con-
 ;vincing to me, and I think to the Ameri-
 can people. I would credit the President
 with the greatest good faith in respect to
 such a finding so far as policy is con-
 !cerned.  The question of whether the
 +South  Vietnamese want  the United
 States in could very well be answered in
 -much the same way by the degree to
 which the country still remains in con-
 trol of the South Vietnam people, as im-
 sportant proof of their will to resist.
 Some proof of their will to resist is what
 remains to them in control. It deter-
 ,mines the question of what degree of
 .cooperation the United States gives,
 whatever may be the regime in power
 at the moment. Considering the emana-
 'tions of opinions, the great number of
 correspondents who are there, and the
 many visitors who come here and go
 there, I think a window can be kept open
 on the country. The central point of my
 'remarks is that I affirm a need for a
 finding of fact by the'President, based on
 ,his information.
 The Senator from Montana has asked
 what I would suggest we do if the South
 Vietnamese people are behind the resist-
 ance movement.  If it is found that a
 majority of the people are for resistance,
 and that finding is made by the Presi-
 dent, we would be .behind that finding.
 If a majority of the people have lost the
 will to resist, there is a serious question
 as to how long the United States can
 continue the struggle at this large cost
 in money and cost in lives.
 With respect to Asian allies giving help,
 I did not mean that the President is not
 trying. The President may be trying, but
 Is the U.S. diplomatic machinery trying
 enough, giving enough emphasis and
 priority to this aspect?  As long as the
 President tries ardently that would be
 fine.  Essentially, my point was raised
 not with respect to whether the Presi-
 dent has tried, but with respect to the
 actual efforts of our Asia and southeast
 Asia allies.  We are entitled to receive
 from them more help than we are get-
 ting.
 Finally, on the question of negotia-
 tion, the Senator from Montana had be-
 fore him reference to my recent remarks.
 Memory is always poorer than the words
 themselves, but my desire and intention
 was not to say if the Nation is willing
 to negotiate, let it negotiate with dignity,
 but rather, that we are ready to negoti-
 ate at any time.  If I did not say it, I
 apologize to the Senator for that.   I
 think I used somewhere former President
 Eisenhower's analogy that we should
 walk the extra mile-provided our nego-
 tiations are not in a frame of reference
 which would sell out the South Vietnam-
 ese people.  I would like to see an an-
 nouncement made, since there is such
 confusion about our willingness to nego-
 tiate. I have endeavored to indicate that
 if the United States will negotiate, it
 will be only on the understanding that
 it was absolutely sure there are no sell-
 outs of the hopes of the South Viet-
 namese people.
 That, it seems to me, represents a sum-
 mation of my thinking in reply to the
 Senator's questions.
 I will accept his suggestion that I state
 in greater detail my views on this matter,
 but I thought I should reply to the Sena-
 tor's questions at this time.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, I
 yield 2 minutes to the Senator from
 Oregon, without losing my right to the
 floor.
 3687
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I am
 deeply sorry that I shall not be able to
 remain in the chamber to hear the speech
 of the Senator from Wisconsin. I find
 myself in deep disagreement with him.
 I shall have remarks to make on the sub-
 ject later in the week. I am on my way
 downtown to make a speech on the "white
 paper,". which can be described as Swiss
 cheese with holes in it made by the lips
 of the administration people to the For-
 eign Relations Committee who said time
 and again that was a civil war fought by
 South Vietnamese rebels largely with
 equipment captured from the govern-
 ment.  Now we are excited because in
 recent weeks the North Vietnamese are
 going in on a big scale. Why should they
 not go in?
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that an editorial in the New York
 Times of yesterday and Mr. Reston's col-
 umn in the New York Times be inserted
 at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 and article were ordered to be printed in
 the RECORD, as follows:
 STORM SIGNALS OVER ASIA
 The Johnson administration seems to be
 conditioning the American people for a dras-
 tic expansion of our involvement in Viet-
 nam.                                                                                                                   The State Department's white paper
 accuses North Vietnam of intensified aggres-
 sion and stresses that military efforts aimed
 solely at the Vietcong guerrillas in the south
 no longer suffice.
 The logic of all this is that the United
 States, which only last week moved from the
 role of "adviser" to active and undisguised
 combatant in South Vietnam, now feels free
 to strike at will-whether by air, sea, or
 land-at any targets it chooses in North Viet-
 nam.                                                                                                                   In the 3 tense weeks since the Viet-
 cong attack on Pleiku, American policy has
 plunged dangerously beyond the one enun-
 ciated then by the President and Secretary
 McNamara of limiting ourselves to retalia-
 tory action and shunning a wider war.
 And what has happened to alter our policy?
 The assertion that North Vietnam is a prin-
 cipal supplier of men and munitions to the
 Vietcong is certainly not new, nor is the
 charge that the extent of its support is in-
 creasing.  Such activity by Hanoi constitutes
 the sole reason for our being in South Viet-
 nam, and has since the United States moved
 into the vacuum left by the French with-
 drawal in 1954.
 Apparently, the major new evidence of a
 need for escalating the war, with all the
 hazard that this entails, was provided by the
 sinking in a South Vietnamese cove earlier
 this month of a 100-ton cargo ship loaded
 with Communist-made small arms and am-
 munition.  A ship of that size is not much
 above the oriental junk class. The standard
 Liberty or Victory ship of World War II had a
 capacity of 7,150 to 7,650 tons.
 Page after page of similarly minuscule de-
 tail about Communist infiltration from the
 north merely raises anew the question of
 whether massive air strikes would accom-
 plish  anything  except  large-scale  civilian
 casualties in industrial centers and ports.
 The question is made sharper by the absence
 of any stable government in Saigon to fight
 or even to speak in the name of the South
 Vietnamese people.
 Communist China, the nation whose im-
 perialist ambitions the world has most to
 worry about, will be a clear gainer from the
 ill timing and judgment of our warning to
 North Vietnam.. It comes just as the Soviet
 Union is about to begin an international

 meeting of Communist parties in Moscow-
 a meeting originally called to pronounce Pei-
 ping          a  renegade  from Marxist-Leninism.
 Washington is now doing precisely what that
 most sophiscated of Kremlinologists, George
 F. Kennan, former U.S. Ambassador to Mos-
 cow, cautioned against his Senate testimony
 Friday: Forcing the Soviet Union to come
 down on the side of Communist China.
 Washington and Peiping are in bizarre
 tandem as the only major capitals in the
 free or Communist worlds openly resistant
 to seeking a negotiated settlement of the
 Vietnamese conflict now.  It is not too late
 for the President to make it plain that the
 United States is ready to talk as well as fight,
 and thus leave China isoalted as the ob-
 structor of any attempt to achieve a sound
 and enforcible peace.
 WASHINGTON:   PRESIDENT  JOHNSON  UNDER
 PRESSURE
 (By James Reston)
 WASHINGTON,           February 27.-President
 Johnson Is making no excuses for anything
 he has done in Vietnam, and is visibly irri-
 tated with the critics of his policy.
 He knows he is now up against the most
 difficult policy decision of his life, and that
 all the options open to him In Vietnam are
 risky, but this is all the more reason, in his
 view, for the country to back the President
 and stop the critical chatter.
 This Is not a new attitude on the part of
 Lyndon Johnson.  When he was majority
 leader in the Senate, he often criticized Presi-
 dent Eisenhower's domestic policies but in-
 variably backed him without a murmur on
 major foreign policy questions.
 THE CONSOLING POLLS
 Accordingly, his attitude toward Demo-
 cratic Senators who have differed with him
 publicly on Vietnam has not been to assume
 that they are expressing what they believe to
 be a better course of action, but to charge
 them with letting him down-sometimes
 merely to get themselves in the headlines.
 He is particularly sensitive to charges that
 he is not talking enough to the American
 people about the complexities and risks of
 the Vietnamese war.  He carries around in
 his pocket a series of private polls that pur-
 port to show that the vast majority of the
 people not only know what he Is doing but
 approve what he is doing.
 NO EAR FOR CRITICS
 The mall coming into the congressional
 and newspaper offices here does not support
 his polls, but when anybody ventures to
 mention this criticism, he insists that the
 polls are right, the people understand his
 problems better than the newspapers, and
 besides, the Congress authorized the action
 he has taken, with only two opposing votes.
 Lyndon Johnson has gone through other
 hard times in his career but nothing like
 this. He sat in on the two Cuban crises with
 President Kennedy, but he did not have pri-
 mary responsibility for the decisions.
 The decision to bomb the bases of the
 Communist torpedo boats after their attack
 on the American Navy was difficult for him
 in only one respect.  One of the bases was
 very close to the Chinese Communist coast,
 and in the end he gave the order to hit It.
 But he was elaborately calm all through that
 night of decision and, anyway, he felt he had
 no honorable option but to retaliate.
 His present situation is different.  All his
 opinions now seem unsatisfactory and even
 dangerous.  If he doesn't keep up the mili-
 tary pressure on North Vietnam, his advisers
 fear that his first attacks on North Vietnam
 will seem a bluff.  But if he does, every day
 that passes raises the prospect that new
 Colnmunits antiaircraft weapons and defen-
 sive fighters will be added to the battle.
 Usually he is at home with middle-of-the-
 road policies, but the middle of this road is
 full  of dangers.  lie does not want to talk
 out on negotiationss because this might im-
 pair the morale of the South Vietnamese,
 and also because he feels it is difficult to
 speak about negotiations without setting
 conditions that nSght make negotiations all
 the more difficult.
 Johnson is a poker player and he knows
 that the man who raises is always in a more
 difficult position than the man who calls. In
 Vietnam, it is Johnson who is raising, and
 the stakes get higher in this game with every
 succeeding play.
 In recent days, he has spent a great deal
 of his time defending his policies to groups
 of Congressmen and newspapermen.  He has,
 indeed, been running a series of seminars,
 with Secretary of Defense McNamara de-
 fending  the  military  policy,                                                              Secretary  of
 State Rusk defending the diplomatic process,
 and Vice President HUMPHREY and himself
 appealing for understanding and unity.
 His faith in polls is astonishing, maybe be-
 cause the polls were so accurate in predicting
 the size of his own electoral victory last
 November.
 CHURCHILL'S ADVICE
 "Nothing is more dangerous," Churchill
 once said, "that to live in the tempermantel
 atmosphere of a Gallup poll, always taking
 one's pulse and taking one's temperature.
 There is only one duty, only one safe course,
 and that is to try to be-right and not to fear
 to do or say what you believe to be right."
 President Johnson is undoubtedly doing
 that, but it is an agonizing problem for a
 man who is not accustomed to losing and not
 yet at ease with the devilish complexities of
 foreign affairs.
 Every American President since the war,
 however, seems to have faced a frightful for-
 eign policy decision early in his administra-
 tion.  For President Truman it was whether
 to drop the atomic bomb on Japan.  For
 President Eisenhower it was whether to ex-
 pand the war or negotiate a truce in Korea.
 For Kennedy it Was the Bay of Pigs adven-
 ture in Cuba.  And for Johnson it is Viet-
 nam.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President-
 The  PRESIDING                                                               OFFICER.  The
 Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, I
 wholeheartedly support the President's
 policy. I admire the restraint and per-
 severance he has shown in carrying it
 out.
 The present policy offers the best
 chance for us to achieve an enduring
 peace in this enormously complex situa-
 tion.
 Mr. President, this policy has been
 under serious attack lately.
 In his statement as modified last week,
 the Secretary General of the United
 Nations, U Thant, charged that although
 the American people are the best in-
 formed in the world, he doubts that even
 in the United States is it possible to re-
 ceive fully balanced information on Viet-
 nam.  The Secretary General said that
 Americans are not sufficiently aware, and
 these are his exact words, "of the serious
 risks and dangers implicit in a war course
 without political efforts to bring the war
 to an end."
 Other Senators have seriously ques-
 tioned our Vietnam policies.  My visits
 in recent weeks with hundreds of Wis-
 consin people convince me that this pro-
 test is widely shared by the American
 people.
 WHY ARE WE IN SOUTH VIETNAM?
 Mr. President, why are we in South
 Vietnam? Why are we pouring so much
 of our taxpayer dollars into this remote,
 far-off land?  Why have we ordered
 thousands of American soldiers to risk
 their lives and, indeed, hundreds have
 laid down their lives in this distant cor-
 ner of Asia? Why?
 Do we want South Vietnam or any part
 of it?
 The question is so ridiculous that even
 the Chinese Communists have not ac-
 cused us of it.
 It is transparently clear that we have
 no desire for any territorial aggrandize-
 ment in any part of the world, certainly
 not in remote southeast Asia.
 Why, then, are we in South Vietnam at
 such painful cost?
 Do we seek any economic advantage
 there?
 Has anyone, even the North Vietnam-
 ese or the Vietcong, accused us of eco-
 nomic exploitation?  Are we pursuing
 dollar diplomacy?
 The answer again is a resounding
 "No."
 From an economic standpoint, Amer-
 ica would be far better off if there were
 no Vietnam.  We have poured literally
 billions of dollars as well as the priceless
 lives of some of our finest young men into
 South Vietnam.
 We will get nothing In return, not a
 penny.
 Mr. President, if any nation's hands
 can be said to be clean, ours are clean in
 South Vietnam.
 We seek no power, no territory.  We
 want no money, no oil, no food, no re-
 source of any kind in this distant nation.
 Why, then, are we there?       Why?
 Why?
 We are there for one very simple rea-
 son, Mr. President. We were invited by
 the Government of South Vietnam to
 come. We were asked to help. So we did.
 The Geneva accords formally recognized
 South Vietnam as a nation.  Its sover-
 eignty is established by solemn agree-
 ment, ratified by the principal powers of
 the world.
 That sovereignty has been challenged
 by an invasion from outside its bound-
 aries.  Tl. e fact of aggression has been
 proved beyond any doubt, repeatedly-
 and of course, most recently, by the white
 paper released over the weekend by the
 State Department which documented the
 facts in great detail and over a period of
 time.
 It has been proved over and over and
 over again virtually every day for more
 than 10 years now.
 SINGLE AMERICAN MOTIVE: PEACE
 But why should we, the U.S. Govern-
 ment, become so involved? What is our
 motive, if our hands are so clean, if we
 desire no territory, no power, no eco-
 nomic advantage? What do we want?
 Mr. President, we want peace. Peace.
 Our record proves that we want peace.
 Every action we have taken has been
 taken to prevent aggression and restore
 peace.  Every pound of food-and we
 have sent millions of tons-every man-
 hour of education in peaceful pursuits-
 and we have poured in thousands of man-
 years in such education-every dollar
 spent to provide health facilities, build
 schools, construct roads and improve
 agriculture-and we have spent hun-
 dreds of millions of dollars for these

 cations for space.  We have slit into space
 more "devices, more sophisticated in their
 instrumentation, more versatile and varied
 in their functions than Soviet spacecraft.
 Even the superiority which they have claimed
 in, rocket thrust will soon be overcome by
 our Saturn vehicles.
 We must continue an unrelenting pursuit
 of knowledge and experience in the fields of
 space.  If this country, through complacency
 or lack of foresight, permitted any other na-
 tion to seize ascendancy in space, we would
 be relegated to a secondary role not only in
 the military area but also in the other prin-
 cipal affairs of men.
 Since the time of its founding 46 years ago,
 the American Legion has devoted itself to
 advancing the Nation's interests and its des-
 tiny.  Today, our destiny is manifest in the
 space above us.  The same sense of mission
 that ignited our strong Nation's westward
 expansion a century ago should now be
 brought to bear in support of the President's
 space objectives.
 An imaginative and venturesome spirit
 has always been our country's distinguishing
 characteristic in its thrust to the summit of
 world leadership.  I am confident that it will
 continue to inspire our people as wesur-
 mount the cosmic challenge that lies ahead.
 CLOSING BENEDICTION BY FATHER DANIEL E.
 POWER,  JR.,  OF   GEORGETOWN  UNIVERSITY,
 WASHINGTON, D.C.
 WASHINGTON'S PRAYER
 I now make it my earnest prayer, that God
 would have you, and the State over which
 you reside, in his holy protection, that he
 would incline the hearts of the Citizens to
 cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedi-
 ence to Government, to entertain a brotherly
 affection and love for one another, for their
 fellow Citizens of the United States at large,
 and particularly for their brethren who have
 served in the Field, and finally, that he would
 most graciously be pleased to dispose us all,
 to do Justice, to love mercy, and to demean
 ourselves with that Charity, humility and
 pacific temper of mind, which the Character-
 isticks of the Divine Author of our blessed
 Religion, and without an humble imitation
 of whose example in these things, we can
 never hope to be a happy Nation.
 Mr. MUNDT.  All in all, Mr. President,
 today's awards luncheon of the national
 department of the American Legion was
 a most impressive and significant occa-
 sion.  Surely, David Sarnoff's informa-
 tive address provides us all with both a
 challenge and a cause for confidence.

 Mr, MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will

 and the Senator from Wisconsin has a
 lengthy speech to make.
 Mr. JAVITS.  I withhold my request.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HAR-
 Ris in the chair).  Is there further
 morning business? If not, morning busi-
 ness 1s concluded.
 Mr.,PROXMIRE obtained the floor;'
 Mr.  MANF`IELD.   Mr.  President,
 will the Senator from Wisconsin yield?
 Mr, PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I am
 happy to yield to the majority leader,
 with the understanding that I will not
 lose my right to the floor.
 WHITE PAPER ON VIETNAM
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, the
 State Department's white paper on Viet-
 nam underscores what able American
 journalists have been reporting for some
 time: that there has been a new and
 higher level of North Vietnamese mili-
 tary involvement in the conflict in the
 South.  This is the second time that
 the Department has seen fit to issue what
 amounts to an official confirmation of
 this kind. It will be recalled that in De-
 cember, 1961, a white paper was issued
 on the same subject.  At that time, the
 issuance coincided with a marked in-
 crease in our indirect military and eco-
 nomic aid to South Vietnam.  The pres-
 ent white paper coincides with still
 another major-a geometric increase in
 American aid.
 In my judgment, the white paper does
 not set forth a new policy.  It confirms
 the necessity uof what has been under-
 taken to date by this Government.  It
 is anew explanation, not a new prescrip-
 tion.
 The paper helps to make clear why
 this. Nation has been compelled to take
 steps which it has taken in recent weeks,
 if South Vietnam is not to be abandoned,
 if the United States is to honor its com-
 mitment to help the Vietnamese of the
 south to retain a degree of choice in their
 future.  In that respect, it should satisfy
 those who have been insisting that the
 President should address an explanation
 to the American people as to what is in-
 volved in Vietnam.  The President, so
 far as I can see, is trying to keep a lid on
 a dangerous volcano in southeast Asia.
 He is not seeking to blow it off.  Insofar
 as information is concerned, we have had
 the white paper, statements from Secre-
 tary McNamara and Secretary Rusk,
 Ambassador Stevenson, and many other
 distinguished members of the adminis-
 tration as to what we are doing, and why.
 American press coverage of the situation
 has been exceptionally extensive and well
 informed.  Insofar as our policies are
 concerned, the President is receiving a
 wealth of advice from his administration
 and from Senators who have partici-
 pated in the highly useful debate on Viet-
 nam-and all of them may I say are to
 be commended for participating.
 The truth of the matter is that the
 President has a policy in Vietnam, and
 it is not expressed in any single action
 or nonaction.  He is trying to prevent a
 great war in Asia, and he is trying at the
 same time to meet a coimmitment to the
 people of South Vietnam of many years
 standing in a situation which changes
 constantly.  He seeks to aid the South
 Vietnamese people to find a solution to
 their difficulties, as did his two predeces-
 sors in office.  And he seeks a peace in
 which freedom in that part of the world
 will not become a dead letter.  That is
 all, even though it is a great deal.
 The paper also emphasizes indirectly,
 the need for an end to the jealous rival-
 ries,`military, and others, which have led
 to coup on coup in Saigon since the un-
 fortunate and most deplorable assassi-
 nation of President Ngo Dinh Diem.  If
 3685
 we are to aid the people of South Viet-
 nam in a situation such as is detailed in
 the white paper, there must be a dedi-
 cated and responsible leadership in South
 Vietnam, through which they can be
 aided, through which their choice, what-
 ever it may be, can be expressed, and
 their right to a choice defended.
 This Nation-no nation can supply an
 alien leadership where only an indigen-
 ous leadership can suffice in this day and
 age in Asia.  Despite the serious inten-
 sification of the military conflict, the
 problem in all Vietnam is still primarily a
 Vietnamese problem.
 I thank the Senator from Wisconsin
 for yielding.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, I am
 happy to have yielded to the majority
 leader on this subject.  My speech is on
 the same subject. The majority leader
 has discussed the white paper, which I
 also intended to discuss.
 President Johnson's Vietnam policy is
 to restore peace and to help the South
 Vietnamese defend their country from
 subversion and attack by the Commu-
 nists.
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator, yield at this point?  I wish to
 say something about what the major-
 ity leader has said.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  I yield.
 Mr. JAVITS.  I hope to be in the
 Chamber  for   all practical  purposes
 throughout the Senator's speech.  I con-
 sider him one of the most thoughtful
 Members of the Senate.  I want very
 much to hear how he feels about this
 subject.
 I should like to say about the majority
 leader's ,statement, just read, that it
 raises a serious question, which is: Do
 the Vietnamese people really want to
 fight for freedom, and do they want us
 there?  We cannot hold plebiscites in
 Vietnam; nonetheless, it is essential that
 this question be before us, because I be-
 lieve it is basic to every other question as
 to whether we stay in South Vietnam or
 not.  I therefore express the hope that
 the President and his spokesmen in Con-
 gress, such as the majority leader, will
 keep us apprised, so far as information
 on this situation is. available to us which
 ought to be made public. It is a subject
 that is under constant review and is of
 constant concern to the American people.
 I have read the speech of the Sena-
 tor from Wisconsin; and, of course, we
 know the position of the majority leader.
 I, too, have supported the President.  I
 do not go along with those who seek ne-
 gotiation as a way to get out.  We must
 fight this problem through until there is
 some result consonant with our objec-
 tives. I know there are tragic losses, and
 that we all must bear them. As the Sen-
 ator feels, and as I know I do, we only
 wish we could go there and do the job
 ourselves.  It would be so much easier
 than standing here and saying that the
 struggle must_go on. However, I feel that
 essentially there is a majority in South
 Vietnam who are interested in fighting
 for freedom, and that they want us there.
 I again address an appeal to the Pres-
 ident. I do not do so to imply that he'is

 not taking action or will not do so. How-
 ever, what the Senator from Montana has
 said bears so heavily on the subject that
 I hope we shall be kept, as far as pos-
 sible, closely in touch with that aspect
 of the matter.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield without losing his
 right to the floor?
 Mr. PROXMIRE.   I yield.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 have been considering what the dis-
 tinguished senior Senator from New
 York said on Thursday, February 18,
 at which time he raised similar ques-
 tions which I think are entitled to an
 answer.
 One of those questions was, of course,
 whether the President should take to
 the airwaves to inform the American
 people on the situation in Vietnam and
 our policy with respect thereto. I have
 stated since, and I reiterate, that in all
 honesty I cannot see the need or desir-
 ability for such a course of action and
 statement at this time.  But getting
 down to specifics, if the Senator from
 Wisconsin will allow me, I would recall
 that on Thursday, 10 days ago, the dis-
 tinguished Senator from New York [Mr.
 JAVrTS] joined in a debate on the Viet-
 namese situation.
 As the Senator from New York knows,
 I hold him in the highest esteem and I
 have great respect and admiration for
 his knowledge and judgment in ques-
 tions of foreign relations.  We have
 from time to time engaged in colloquies
 on certain subjects in this particular
 field, and I have invariably emerged
 from them with an enrichment of my
 own understanding.  So what I say is
 not in criticism of the recent remarks
 of the Senator.  It is for purposes of
 clarification.
 The Senator will recall other collo-
 quies which we had a year or so ago.
 Unfortunately, I do not have the REC-
 oRAS here covering these colloquies, but
 they are in my office. When I sought to
 examine certain premises and policies
 with respect to Vietnam or southeast
 Asia, the Senator's great concern was
 not so much with what I was suggest-
 ing, but rather with the possibility that
 it might be misconstrued.
 The Senator noted, as I recall, that my
 remarks might erroneously be inter-
 preted as an advocacy of a pullout or the
 abandonment of solemn commitments.
 With all due respect, I would suggest that
 a similar misconstruction could be placed
 on the remarks of the Senator in his
 talk on February 18, although I per-
 sonally didnot so interpret them. But,
 lest there be any doubt that the Senator
 from New York stands foursquare be-
 hind the President, I would point out
 that he did vote for the Vietnamese res-
 olution on August 7, 1964, as he has
 stated many times. Part of the resolu-
 tion reads:
 The Congress approves and supports the
 determination of the President as Com-
 mander in Chief to take all necessary meas-
 ures to repel any armed attack against the
 forces of the United States and to prevent
 further aggression.
 As I said, the Senator from New York
 voted-for that resolution. So there ought
 to be no doubt that he supports fully
 and completely the military actions
 which the President has felt compelled
 to take in Vietnam.
 With that as background, I should
 like to commend the Senator for raising
 certain questions on February 18 with
 respect to the present situation In Viet-
 nam.
 First, the Senator from New York
 asked the President whether the ma-
 jority of the people in South Vietnam
 are determined to fight for their free-
 dom. This is very pertinent indeed, for,
 as President Johnson has said, our ob-
 jective in South Vietnam is to help the
 people of that country defend their free-
 dom.  May I say in all frankness that
 the inability of their leaders to form a
 stable government, as evidenced by at
 least 13 coups, or attempted coups, in
 less than 16 months, the last being about
 2 weeks ago, is not a source of encourage-
 ment.
 I would say to the distinguished Sen-
 ator from New York the hour now is late
 for his question. I would ask him: How
 do you find out now, while the American
 forces are becoming the prime targets of
 the Vietcong, whether the Vietnamese
 people are determined to fight for their
 freedom, especially when their leaders
 compound the difficulty by their feuds
 and struggles for prestige and power?
 Do you take a Gallup poll? Do you have
 a congressional investigation? This is a
 very serious question.  But how in the
 present circumstances do you set out to,
 answer It?  And if the answer could be
 obtained and if it were found that the
 Vietnamese people are not determined
 to fight for their freedom, what would
 the Senator suggest that the President
 do? Would he have the President nego-
 tiate out, or simply pullout, or move in
 further?
 The Senator could make a great con-
 tribution, I think, not only by raising
 the questions, but also by exploring the
 implications of the answers.
 Second,  the  distinguished  Senator
 from New York asked whether the peo-
 ple of South Vietnam actually want the
 United States in their country.   This,
 too, is a vital question.  But I would
 most respectfully suggest that it is diffi-
 cult to consider this question now, while
 the guns are being fired at Americans,
 and Americans are losing their lives in
 increasing numbers.  The time to have
 examined this question with the dis-
 passion that it warrants was months
 ago.
 But the Senator, as far as I can recall,
 generally expressed the view in his col-
 loquies with me a year ago that the ex-
 amination of any such vital questions
 would invariably introduce worldwide
 doubts as to our steadfastness.  How
 much more would that be the case in the
 present circumstances?
 So I would say to the Senator with all
 due respect that his question is likely to
 remain rhetorical unless he can also
 focus attention on it and suggest to the
 President ways in which it can be in-
 telligently answered while the fighting
 Is In progress.
 Third, the Senator from New York
 asked whether the United States has
 done everything possible to get our Asian
 allies-Japan, Australia, New Zealand,
 Pakistan, Thailand, and so forth, to help
 in the fighting.  Here the answer` is
 plain.  Everything  possible has been
 tried as it was in 1954, when President
 Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles were con-
 fronted by a similar problem, as it was
 in 1961, by the late President Kennedy,
 with respect to a crisis in Laos at that
 time.  The  response  has  been  very
 meager in so far as military assistance
 to Vietnam is concerned.
 So I would say to the Senator that If
 he feels we must have significant inter-
 national or Asian support as a condition
 for remaining in Vietnam in a limited
 conflict, there is little sign that it is go-
 ing to materialize.  In present circum-
 stances, sacrifices of life and resources
 insofar as they are borne by other than
 Vietnamese are going to be continued to
 be borne almost wholly by the United
 States, as they have been for a long
 time.
 Finally,  the  distinguished  Senator
 from New York asked that if the United
 States is willing to negotiate, will it nego-
 tiate with dignity, and not at the expense
 of the South Vietnamese people.   The
 phrasing of the question reveals an un-
 certainty in the mind of the Senator,
 which I must confess I do not understand,
 and which I find somewhat disturbing.
 I cannot imagine President Johnson,
 or any President, entering into negotia-
 tions other than with dignity and honor.
 Did not President Truman negotiate with
 dignity and honor in Korea?  Did not
 President Eisenhower, when he continued
 these same negotiations which led to a
 cease-fire, insist upon dignified and hon-
 orable negotiations?  Does the Senator
 from New York really doubt that Presi-
 dent Johnson, if he felt negotiations de-
 sirable, would negotiate with any less
 dignity and honor, or with less aware-
 ness of the realities in the Vietnamese
 situation?
 I do not believe that the Senator from
 New York thinks that the President
 would repudiate our obligations to the
 Vietnamese People. Who has suggested
 that we should?
 Certainly, the senior Senator from
 Idaho [Mr. CHURCH] made clear in his
 recent speech, for example, his support
 of the President's military actions, as did
 the Senator from New York.  In his
 argumentation in this Chamber a few
 days ago, Senator CHURCH stated ex-
 plicitly that, "Having made a solemn
 commitment to Saigon, we intend to keep
 it.,,
 To suggest that negotiations be con-
 sidered, is not to break a Commitment,
 as the Senator from New York well
 knows; in some situations, negotiations
 may well be the best way to keep a com-
 mitment.  And despite the possibility of
 misconstruction, I would say to the
 Senator from New York that any sug-
 gestions which he may have as to how
 negotiations, both dignified and honor-
 able, may be applied in this situation
 to bring the bloodshed' to an end would
 be welcomed.
 I, for one, would urge him to make
 such suggestions.

 in acreage has been made. In fact, the ,rec-
 ommendation is for an increase in acreage
 solneghat beyond that which the current ap-
 propriation would purchase.
 My plea to you, gentlemen, is to give us
 the funds to make this acquisition immedi-
 ately.  The time is late.  The city govern-
 ment of Greensboro already has turned down
 two rezoning requests for property adjacent
 to the park in order to preserve the land for
 purchase by the Park Service.  In addition,
 the city government of Greensboro recently
 purchased five areas adjacent to the park
 which was threatened for development.  In
 addition, the city of Greensboro has expressed
 e willingness to purchase some additional
 land adjacent to its own city park in order
 to join up with land to be purchased by the
 Federal Government in order to give a large
 continuous park area surrounding the battle.
 ground site.
 Our individual citizens and our city gov-
 ernment have exhibited their good faith and,
 Indeed, have invested money in the prospect
 that this park can be increased.  The amount
 contained in the budget request is, we feel,
 a modest request, considering the greatness
 of the need; but it is a vital request which,
 if granted, can save this park from encroach-
 ment, and eventual engulfment by undesir-
 able commercial and industrial development.
 = In addition, an enlarged park would given
 the National Parks Service a better oppor-
 tunity to tell the historic story of the Battle
 of Guilford Courthouse.  At the  present
 time, a road runs directly through the park;
 and there is little room for a scenic drive or
 for the re-creation of-sections that would
 have been familiar with those in the battle.
 With enlargement of the park, the en-
 trances  can  be  protected.  The  city  of
 Greensboro has plans for relocating the road
 through the park to the north. A loop drive
 through the battlefield area could then be
 constructed; and as a long-range project, the
 recreation of the village of Guilford Court-
 house has been suggested.  All of this would
 give our citizens and those devoted to our
 historic heritage everywhere a dramatization
 of the brave deeds that took place during this
 Battle of Guilford Courthouse..
 We have been advised of the support of the
 entire 11-man congressional delegation of
 the State of, North Carolina, as well as our
 2 Senators.  We hope you gentlemen will
 look with favor upon this budget request for
 Guilford Courthouse National Military Park,
 and help us to acquire this historic land
 before it is lost to us forever.
 Thank you for giving me the opportunity
 to appear before you today.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM H, AYRES
 Tuesday, February 9, 1965
 Mr. AYRES.                   Mr. Speaker, we are
 justifiably proud of the many distin-
 guished sons that the State of Ohio has
 furnished to these legislative halls.  We
 are  equally proud  of that       eminent
 daughter of our great State whose 25th
 anniversary of service, I would call to
 your attention.
 The Honorable FRANCES P. BOLTON was
 elected' at a special election to fill the
 unexpired term of her late husband,
 Chester WC. Bolton, and took her oath of
 office on February 27, 1940.  That most
 able Member of this body served five
 terms with great distinction.
 I need not detail the entire legislative
 career of the most competent gentle-
 woman from Ohio.  Her capability as a
 Member of this House is fully recognized
 by us all.
 As senior ranking Republican member
 of the Committee of the House on For-
 eign Affairs, she has demonstrated that
 she is indeed possessed with outstanding
 diplomatic ability.  Her capability in
 this field has received recognition, not
 only here in our country but throughout
 the world.  I am of the firm conviction
 that the gentlewoman from Ohio [Mrs.
 BOLTON] would be a most able Secretary
 of State.
 I know of no one who has a greater
 knowledge of the complex problems of
 the newly founded nations of the con-
 tinent of Africa.  She has studied these
 with great diligence and has traveled in
 that continent to improve her knowledge.
 I need not speak of her personal at-
 tributes.  Here indeed is a most gracious
 lady.  I wish to here acknowledge the
 aid and good advice that she gave me
 when I first came to the House of Repre-
 sentatives.  Now 15 years later, I still
 rely on her good judgment.
 I would not have you think that she
 has confined all of her activities to the
 field of foreign affairs.  Her great inter-
 est has brought fine advances in the
 fields of education and health.  Her
 great modesty prevents us from learning
 of the many philanthropic things that
 she has originated and continues to
 support.
 I have often heard it said that the gen-
 tlewoman from Ohio [Mrs. BOLTON] is a
 great inspiration to all of the women of
 the world. Certainly she has shown that
 women can be most successful in public
 service.  I do say that the Honorable
 FRANCES P. BOLTON Is an inspiration to all
 Americans, men and women alike.
 Here is a truly great American.

 Contribution to an area and State.  And
 all too frequently the importance of this
 contribution to the life and economy of
 the area is overlooked.  Recently, an

 my district passed on.  On that occasion,
 a noted Georgia editor wrote a tribute
 which I would like to share with my col-
 leagues.

 Regrettably, and all too young, another
 member of the public-spirited Morgan fam-
 ily of Effingham and Chatham Counties has
 passed from the Georgia scene.  lie was
 A881
 Samuel H. Morgan, whose recent death at
 the age of 59 stopped a career that had fol-
 lowed the pattern set by his forebears.
 This is a pattern of service to God, to
 country, to fellow men.  The saga of the
 Morgan family is inspiring.  It runs back
 into early American history and in the more
 recent years has been carried on by the gen-
 erations headed by the late Samuel H. Mor-
 gan, the senior.  Mr. Morgan and his chil-
 dren had a tradition to live up to, and they
 heeded unhesitatingly the call of character
 and responsibility.
 As is not unusual on a team, and we apply
 that term to the Morgan family in Its best
 sense, there are members whose works are
 better known publicly than others, although
 each member of the team makes his valuable
 contribution to the whole.  The senior Mr.
 Morgan served well in several public areas-
 his church, education, and the development
 of Georgia's economy.  His sons and daugh-
 ter had the benefit and the inspiration of
 sound paternal and maternal precept and
 example and in discharging the obligations
 of their generation they did not fail.
 Samuel Hughes Morgan, who to countless
 friends was simply and affectionately "Sam,"
 was the youngest of the Morgan brothers.
 As a lad he lived in the home place at Guy-
 ton but, following his graduation from high
 school there, spent most of his life in Savan-
 nah,  The interests that had long stirred the
 family found active appreciation in him.  He
 had served on the Georgia Forestry Commis-
 sion  and                                                                                                                                            quietly associated  himself with
 many altruistic community and Individual
 efforts.  His was the quiet way of service,
 sincere and effective.
 Sam Morgan was the last of his generation
 in the family business, which now comes un-
 der the guidance of the third generation of
 kinsmen.  If we were to sum up his philos-
 ophy of life, It mould be to repeat his fre-
 quent greeting: "What can I do to help
 you?"     The can be no finer motto.

 so masterfully at a farewell dinner that he   Congressman, began building a reputation as
 an effective behind-the-scenes force at the
 international level.
 WRIGHT was one of the 21 U.S. Congress-
 men who met with 25 Mexican Congressmen
 in the fifth - interparliamentary conference
 between the two nations in the Baja Cali-
 fornia city of La Paz.                      -
 The news magazine said two Democrats
 in Texas see him as their -best bet to unseat
 Republican JOHN TowER.
 Congressmen  from  both  countries  said
 privately he deserved a major share of the
 credit for several of the agreements of the
 two-nation conference.
 Chief among them was the virtually unan-
 imous consensus by the two delegations that
 the bracero agreement should be renewed.
 WRIGHT headed the American side on the
 committee that discussed the bracero situa-
 tion, and emerged as the spokesman for the
 five-man coalition of border State Senators
 and Representatives that pushed hard to get
 that consensus.
 The committee's final report, written by
 WRIGHT,  spoke optimistically of "any and
 all future (bracero) agreements."
 Before the conference began, the Mexican
 delegation was reported to be preparing to
 push for stiffer controls and more stringent
 labor department supervision in any future
 bracero agreement.
 By the time it ended, both sides said the
 Mexican delegates would willing back a re-
 newal of the contract under its old terms.
 WRIGHT's  delivery of the committee re-
 port to the concluding session of the con-
 ference drew the loudest round of applause
 of the evening. It took him several min-
 utes to get back to his seat from the stage
 as he worked his way through the delegates
 waiting to congratulate him.
 WRIGHT was picked to deliver the final
 words of the U.S. delegation, a speech of ap-
 preciation given by the Governor of southern
 Baja  California  after the  conference  of .-
 cially ended.
 One of the things that impressed several
 Mexican  delegates  was  WRIGHT'S  use  of
 Spanish occasionally outside the committee
 sessions. (The sessions were conducted with
 translators   and  the  use   of   U.N.-style
 earphones.)
 "We know Mr. GONZALEZ and Mr. MoN-
 TOYA (Representative HENRY GONZALEZ, Dem-
 ocrat of Texas, and Senator JOSEPH MONTOYA,
 Democrat, of New Mexico) both Mexican-
 Americans, speak Spanish, but they learned
 it at home, as children," said one Mexican
 deputy.                 --
 "But for Mr. WRIGHT to speak Spanish
 means he must have taken the time and
 trouble to study the language, and practice
 it.  This demonstrates a real desire to work
 toward a closer understanding."

 casion because most of the 11th Congres-
 sional District as It is now constituted
 w0s iyf presefited in Congress"2ryears ago
 by this most gracious and most capable
 Congresswoman.
 .I believe, that it would .be of interest, to
 my -fellow Members of Congress that,
 with the exception of 6 years, members
 of the Bolton family have represented
 the county of take in Congress since
 March 4, 1929.
 My first recollection of the Honorable
 Chester"C, Bolton was on the occasion
 of a >i'lag Day, speech in the city of
 Painesville some 33 years ago when I re-
 member my father telling me that we
 were going down to the city park so that
 I might have an occasion to hear one
 of the great leaders of our times, the
 Honorable Chester C. Bolton, give the an-
 nual Flag Day address.
 It is with. great pleasure that I ex-
 tend                 my  warmest congratulations to
 Mrs. BOLTON, with the hope that the Good
 Lord, who has been so kind to her in the
 past, will allow her to stay with us for
 who are willing and prepared to haul down
 the U.S. flag and put up foreign flags want
 peace at any price.
 The Vietnamese people, all but the profit-
 eers of war, want peace.  And it is probable
 that the great majority of them want peace
 at any price,  They do not share either our
 ideals or our ambitions for them.
 The French, who have maintained busi-
 ness, agricultural, and cultural interests in
 Vietnam despite their defeat by the Vietminh
 in 1954," want peace for their own practical
 political and sentimental reasons, but they
 hope to see and perhaps to influence a nego-
 tiated peace.  They are convinced that we
 cannot, win a war that they failed to win
 with 400,000 troops, at least half of them
 French regulars.
 The Chinese don't want peace in South
 Vietnam.  They want the United States to
 get hurt. And they want to end up with
 greater  influence  in  southeast  Asia  than
 to come to the United States and learn about
 life here.
 And please, Mr. President, stop asking
 these people to invite you to see their great
 land and people.  Do not embarrass us.
 Instead, help us by example to show our
 respect to our heroic dead and to the fine
 young men who are doing their duty, as they
 have learned to do their duty, in battle even
 today and tomorrow and in the days to come.
 -A.G..
 I especially like the magnificent idea
 that we try leading the world by ex-
 ample, in a manner at least as exemplary
 as the young men fighting and dying for
 us and for principle in the stinking
 jungles of a far-off country about which
 most Americans could care less.

 We Do Not Envy President in Dilemma of
 HON. BURT L. TALCOTT
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 1, 1965
 Mr. TALCOTT. Mr. Speaker, to better
 appreciate the dilemma of the admin-
 istration in Vietnam, we all ought to
 ponder the alternatives available to` us
 now.    One of the most "astute and
 thoughtful dissertations on this subject
 was, made in an editorial by Allen Grif-
 fin, president of the Monterey Peninsula
 Herald, dated February 18, 1965.
 Under unanimous consent I insert
 Colonel Griffin 's editorial at this place in
 the RECORD:
 WE Do NOT ENVY PRESIDENT IN DILEMMA OF
 VIETNAM
 What Is U.S. policy toward the war in Viet-
 nam? The policy is as undeclared as the war
 is.
 It is entirely possible that between the
 time this column is being written and the
 time it is printed, the President of the United
 States will c411 an unscheduled press con-
 ference and announce U.S. policy toward
 the war in South Vietnam, that has moved
 over the border' to southern areas of North
 Vietnam, causing worldwide repercussions.
 Here to request clarification is French For-
 eign Minister Couve de Murville.  He is re-
 questing information as to policy, that has so
 far been denied the American people al-
 though the American press has vigorously
 pressed for a statement of policy.
 Meanwhile, splendid American soldiers and
 airmen are'befng lost in increasing numbers,
 gallantly meeting the call of duty in a war
 increasingly difficult for them to understand.
 These meii are'tl a salt of our earth.  They
 will do their duty.  They believe in their
 country.  But they are modern men, and
 they have the right to know.
 There is one thing certain: the American
 people want peace. However, only those few
 Moscow.
 The Russians don't want peace in South        Teenage Drinking in New York
 Vietnam unless it can be arrived at through
 humiliation of the United States.  They are
 shipping and delivering arms to bring down
 American planes.   They are providing aid
 and comfort to our minor enemy, but they
 and China are the major enemies.
 Would any American not drunk or sick
 with political ambition enjoy being President
 of the United States under this condition?
 We don' think so.  How would any reader of
 this newspaper  like to make a choice of
 possible decisions?
 Here are some alternatives:
 1. Escalate  the war.    Send  American
 doughboys or marines to guard our airbases
 and installations. " Extend  bombing  in  a
 northerly direction, testing the will of the
 minor enemy.  Will that stop the Vietcong
 ground attacks or slow them down?  What's
 your opinion?
 2. Ask the" British again             (as we did in
 Korea) to plead with the Russians to act' as
 intermediaries to bring about a cease-fire,
 an armistice, and negotiations for peace. The
 negotiations in `Korea have worked, so far.
 Those made under the auspices of the Hon-
 orable Averill Harriman in Laos did not work.
 The arrangement dividing South and North
 Vietnam also failed to work, but the blame
 for that may be divided.
 3. Escalate the war to the point that the
 Chinese enter it In Vietnam and Korea; then
 knock out the Chinese nuclear development
 plants and other means they have to build
 a nuclear capability, because within 5 or 6
 years or less China and Russia will be able
 to whipsaw the United States into a state of
 perpetual tension, no matter how they hate
 one another.  But-when the first nuclear
 bombs descend upon China, what will the
 Russians do?  They hate the Chinese, but
 would the balloon go up?
 4. Move up our war effort only to the point
 where our men die trying to maintain a
 status quo, not winning, not losing (any-
 thing but their lives), while we wait for the
 breaks.  Time is on whose side?
 5. Pull out through a means to be devised,
 although this may mean the beginning of
 another war of liberation in Thailand, in
 which we would again be committed on an
 even more difficult frontier, trying to save a
 gentle people who have no love for war and
 who have preserved themselves through the
 generations  by  patient  negotiations  and
 friendly wiles.  Not a powerful, tough-fight-
 ing ally such as the South Koreans were
 under Syngman Rhee.  And then, a stepup
 of liberation in the Philippines, and so forth.
 There is only one piece of advice we would
 care to give President Johnson in the face
 of these disturbing problems:
 Please, Mr. President, for the sake of the
 dignity of your office and of the American
 people, stop asking the temporary rulers of
 Russia, Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin or
 his boss, Party Secretary Leonid Brezhnev,
 HON. FLORENCE P. DWYER
 OF NEW JERSEY
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 1, 1965
 Mrs. ' DWYER.  Mr.  Speaker,  on
 Thursday, February 25, 16 of our col-
 leagues joined me in introducing iden-
 tical concurrent resolutions expressing
 the sense of the"Congress that New York
 State should raise its minimum legal
 drinking age from 18 to 21 in conformity
 with the laws of all its neighboring
 States-a highly significant display of
 the concern with which the people we
 represent view the harmful effects of
 New York's teenage drinking law.
 This weekend. we have received fur-
 ther evidence of New York's irrespon-
 sibility in the form of a report to the
 Governor of Connecticut by the State's
 teenage liquor law coordination commis-
 sion based on a 2-year study of the teen-
 age drinking problem in that State.
 It is evident from a reading of the
 story published this morning by the New
 York Herold Tribune, which I include
 herewith as a part of my remarks, that
 the commission's study was thoroughly
 and responsibly done.  The commission
 has recommended both a tightening of
 Connecticut's own laws and, in self-de-
 fense, an increase in New York's legal
 drinking age.
 New York's law, the commission pro-
 tested, "acts as a magnet drawing teen-
 agers into New York and acts as open in-
 vitation and attractive nuisance."
 The Herald Tribune story follows:
 A CONCLUSION ON TEEN DRINKING   PARENTS'
 FAULT
 HARTFORD, CoNN.-A special State commis-
 sion that spent 2 years studying the problem
 of teenage drinking has come up with a con-
 clusion: Parents are mostly to blame for the
 drinking practices of their children.
 The teenage liquor law coordination com-
 mission submitted its report to Gov. John N.
 Dempsey over the weekend.  Its key recom-
 mendation to curb drinking among tenagers:
 A law should be passed.    .
 The commission recommended that since
 "Connecticut law does not forbid minors to
 drink," but merely forbids adults to serve or
 sell them liquor, the State needs a new law
 making it illegal for minors "to knowingly

 possess alcoholic beverages without parental
 consent."
 The effect of the proposed law would be
 that parents could be brought into court, if
 their children got into trouble while drink-
 ing, to testify whether they had knowledge
 of the drinking and approved of it.
 The commission recommended that "all
 adults, in the conduct of their business, their
 affairs, and in their home life, recognize that
 their (own) drinking practices influence to
 a great degree teenagers in their imitation
 of adult drinking."
 The commission report continued: "Teen-
 age drinking is learned experience where the
 youngster is attempting to emulate the adult
 to be accepted by his peers.  If parents and
 States differ widely in attitude toward uni-
 form behavior in this regard, we cannot ex-
 pect laws to be respected."
 What can adults do to keep their children
 on the wagon?  "Adults, especially parents,
 the commission said, "are urged to consider
 carefully their drinking customs and prac-
 tices and to engage responsibly in them in
 light of their influence on minors."
 As an "example of the kind of practice
 that might well be discontinued," the com-
 mission noted "the ;custom of serving chil-
 dren simulated cocktails in bars, restaurants,
 and homes."
 The commission also took a swipe at New
 York State for continuing to permit persons
 18 to 21 years old to buy liquor legally in
 bars and package stores.
 "This law acts as a magnet drawing teen-
 agers into New York and acts as open in-
 vitation and attractive nuisance," the com-
 mission report said.
 Connecticut and New Jersey have long
 urged New York to raise its minimum age
 to 21, to match their own statutes, but the
 New York Legislature has turned a deaf ear.
 There are pressures from within and with-
 out New York State, in the current session
 of the legislature, to raise the drinking age,
 and there are six bills on file to accomplish
 this.  But there seems little _.chance of the
 legislation getting through.
 New York's Governor Rockefeller, who has
 opposed past, attempts to raise the drinking
 age, claims that studies of teenage drinking
 patterns across the country have shown
 youngsters pick up the habit in their homes
 at the average age of 14.
 The Connecticut commission studying the
 problem was obviously in agreement on that
 point.
 Drinking, the commission said, seems to be
 an American social heritage, and children
 get on to it at an early age."
 The commission also dipped briefly into
 the problem of narcotics addiction among
 teenagers, indicating drinking is connected
 with that problem.
 It suggested that another commission be
 set up to make another 2-year study-this
 time on narcotics-since it found that some
 teenagers "have gone to drugs for a greater
 kick than is provided by alcohol.."
 Need for an Inter-American Approach
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. DANTE B. FASCELL
 OF FLORIDA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March .1, 1965
 Mr. FASCELL.              Mr. Speaker, for more
 than a decade following World War II a
 succession of rapid-fire emergencies-
 Greece, the Marshall plan, the Suez
 situation,  the             Berlin  airlift,  Laos,
 Lebanon, the Hungarian revolt, Quemoy
 and Matsu, sputnik-riveted our atten-
 tion on Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
 In the process, developments in Latin
 America were largely ignored by the news
 media.  At the same time, interest in
 Latin America among our academic
 community waned as more prestige be-
 came  attached  to  studies  of  other
 regions.
 Fortunately, the period of indifference
 to our Latin American neighbors has
 ended.  Universities, foundations, and
 Government agencies now are attaching
 more importance to an understanding of
 the vast region stretching from the Rio
 Grande to the Straits of Magellan.
 I am pleased to report that the
 University of Miami is making a special
 contribution to the effort to increase
 inter-American  comprehension.   The
 University of Miami has become the
 headquarters for the  Inter-American
 Academy, a group founded to foster bet-
 ter  understanding  and                                                    cooperation
 through cultural exchange between dis-
 tinguished scholars, teachers, writers,
 and leaders of the Western Hemisphere.
 The University has joined with the Inter-
 American Academy in publishing the
 Journal of Inter-American Studies, a
 quarterly  publication  which  includes
 scholarly articles representing all phases
 of inter-American affairs.
 With volume VII, No. 1, dated January
 1965, the Journal of Inter-American
 Studies makes its debut in an attractive
 new format for which the University of
 Miami Press is to be commended.  The
 edition contains an article by Dr. Henry
 King Stanford, president of the Univer-
 sity of Miami, which sets forth the pur-
 poses and goals of the Inter-American
 Academy and Journal. According to Dr.
 Stanford:
 We have no choice but to see our futures
 as inextricably joined.  We have no choice
 but to study each other and to learn from
 each other.    Even the very diversity that
 exists among us can be understood only as
 we pool our knowledge and research, only as
 we study ourselves comparatively.
 I  strongly  endorse  Dr.  Stanford's
 views on the need for an inter-American
 approach as well as recommend the
 Journal of Inter-American Studies to all
 serious observers of hemisphere develop-
 ments.
 Dr. Stanford's article follows:
 TIME NEED FOR AN INTER-AMERICAN APPROACH
 Fortunate good judgment led the founders
 of the Journal of Inter-American Studies to
 place major emphasis in their new enter-
 prise of 6 years ago on the most neglected
 aspect  of studies  related to  the  Western
 Hemisphere: the Inter-American aspect.
 North Americans at that time had long
 been devoting scholarly attention to their
 neighbors to the south.  But generally their
 study--sympathetic      and    understanding
 though it was-was of one people looking at
 other peoples through eyes that saw back-
 grounds, outlooks, and problems essentially
 different from their own.  Thinking on the
 part of the North Americans was in terms of
 Latin American studies, Hispanic American
 studies, or even South American studies.
 Latin Americans viewed North Americans
 as similarly alien to themselves and theirs.
 One exception existed on both sides.  From
 the early 19th century the dream of a pan-
 Americanism existed, and slowly studies and
 activities emerged that focused on a special
 sort of pan-American cooperation, or even an
 assumed special affinity.  But in all frank-
 ness, much  that was involved was either
 highly artificial, or taken up with narrow In.
 stitutional arrangements.
 Perhaps even more striking has been the
 lack of study by Latin American peoples of
 each other. Writing in the April 1964 issue
 of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Philip W.  Quigg
 pointed  out that  "there  are  some 30
 North American correspondents in Mexico
 City; none from other Latin American coun-
 tries.                                                                                                                        There are at the very least a dozen
 universities in the United States where one
 can study the history, culture, politics, and
 economics of Latin America in some depth;
 there is no Latin American university offer-
 ing more than the most superficial survey in
 the same field. * * * Similarly, the average
 cultivated Latin American will have made
 several trips to the United States and to Eu-
 rope,  but  none  to  other  parts  of  Latin
 America." 1
 There can be no gainsaying that great di-
 versity exists within the Americas.   Certainly
 the last thing that ' should be attempted
 would be to cast this vast hemisphere, or
 even Its various subregions, into a single
 mold and direct study and research to a
 search for uniformities.
 Nevertheless, while Brazilians and Argen-
 tinians differ greatly from each other, they
 have much in common.  If nothing else, they
 share many of the same sorts of problems.
 And the same goes for all of us.  We should
 all respect each other's individuality.  But
 only ignorance can come from an attitude
 that provincially sets each of us off as quite
 different from all others.
 Beyond the impact of history and geogra-
 phy, modern technology has squeezed us all
 into a single small village.  A disaster in a
 Rio de Janeiro has its instant repercussions
 in a New York.  Buenos Aires is as close to
 San  Francisco  as  the  instantaneous  link
 through a communications satellite.     -
 We have no choice but to see our futures
 as   inextricably joined,    We   have    no
 choice but to study each other and to learn
 from each other. Even the very diversity
 that exists among us can be understood only
 as we pool our knowledge and research, only
 as we study ourselves comparatively.
 It  is  here  the  approach  taken by the
 founders of this journal looms so large.
 These men sought a medium where the varied
 intellectual  resources  of  this  hemisphere
 could be brought to bear on problems and
 matters of common importance and interest
 to us all.
 A similar objective marked the establish-
 ment of the Inter-American Academy, of
 which the Journal of Inter-American Studies
 is the official organ.  This body, which is still
 in its infancy, aims to bring together in a
 single grouping and on a continuing basis
 representative leaders of thought and in-
 tellectual life  throughout the Americas.
 The roster of members  of the academy
 gives assurance that as communications and
 exchanges  are developed among them,  as
 their  intellectual powers are increasingly
 pooled on matters of common moment in
 this hemisphere, a significant forward step
 will be taken toward meeting the pressing
 need for greater inter-American knowledge
 and understanding.
 The headquarters of the Inter-American
 Academy are now at the University of Miami,
 and the university joins with the academy
 in publishing the Journal of Inter-American
 Studies.
 The University of Miami is impressed by
 the opportunity opened by its association
 with the  academy and the journal.   The'
 University of Miami since its founding ha=
 looked upon its location at the gateway of the
 Americas as thrusting upon it a special re-
 sponsibility and a unique opportunity with
 regard to hemispheric affairs.  And within

 BASIL WHITENER.  He is one of the hardest
 working and most respected Members of Con-
 gress.  I have watched with something ap-
 proaching awe BASIL's determined campaign,
 against long odds, to bring order out of the
 chaos that threatens ..the textile industry.
 As you well know, the textile industry is
 being jeopardized by the almost unrestricted
 importation of goods from cheap-labor coun-
 tries across the sea.  Congressman WHITENER
 has been striving mightily to tighten up laws
 that permit this condition to exist-a condi-
 tion that has contributed, at least, to the loss
 of more than a half million jobs in the do-
 mestic textile industry since World War II.
 T am glad to say that BASIL is making
 progress to guarantee some needed protec-
 tion to the American textile industry and to
 the ;em$3ding tens of thousands of men an_ d
 women who }earn their livelihood from it=
 BASIL WHrrENER was instrumental last year
 in the .passage of legislation  that makes
 Americapi,cotton:available to. .American mills
 at the same price Americans were selling it
 to textile manufacturers overseas.
 Prior to enactment of t?his_, long overdue
 legislation, our own mills were compelled to
 pay 8 cents a pound more for cotton grown
 in North, Carolina, for example, than it was
 being sold to foreign producers._ In short,
 the United States actually was  ubsidizing
 mills overseas, at the,. expense of our own
 textile manufacturers and, employees. Hap-
 pily, Congressman WHITENER was, able to
 help correct this gross inequity .
 I know that ,you in North Carolina are
 well aware of BASIL WHITENER'S continuing
 light to preserve the domestic textile indus-
 try-which means so very much to theecon-
 omy of the South.I just wanted you to
 know that we, in other regions also recognize
 that he is a Cann-do.,Congressman.
 Now, we Democrats meet here tonight in
 the warm afterglow of one of the most deci-

 by a political party in the United States.  The

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX                March 1
 So let us go forth from this place and carry
 the message of the Democratic Party to every
 crossroad and branchhead in this great land
 of ours.  It is a message that all of us can
 be proud of. It is a message that can be used
 to keep the Republican Party in its accus-
 tomed place-second place.
 I  have  some  spent  little  time  tonight
 roasting our Republican friends.  I should
 make it clear, however, that despite our dif-
 ferences, I regard them as good, loyal, pa-
 triotic Americans who are interested in sound
 government and doing what, in their judg-
 ment, is best for our country.                 It is just
 that they weigh the role of government in an
 entirely different scale than we Democrats
 use.   As Franklin Roosevelt so eloquently
 said: "Governments can err, Presidents do
 make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells
 us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the
 coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted
 in a different scale.  Better the occasional
 faults of government living in the spirit of
 charity," F.D.R. went on to say, "Than the
 omissions of a government frozen in the ice
 of its own indifference."
 Nobody has ever heard of a, coldblooded
 donkey--or a warmblooded dinosaur, which
 seems to be the symbol of the Grand Old
 Party.
 Now, If I may, a personal word of expla-
 nation about my pursuing a political career.
 I am an ordained Lutheran minister.  Many
 people have asked why a man of the cloth
 would involve himself In the sweat and toil
 and pragmatism of politics.
 The answer to that question, perhaps, may
 best be found in the parable of the Samar-
 itan (St. Luke 10: 29-37) .
 You will recall that a man fell in with the
 thieves and they stripped him and left him
 half dead by the side of the road.  Coming
 upon the unfortunate man, the priest and
 the Levite passed him by. They had no time
 to administer to the needs of their fellow
 man.  But the Samaritan came along and
 did extend a helping hand to him.      And
 Jesus said, "Go, and do thou likewise."
 It seems to me that the profession of pol-
 itics and government affords us the greatest
 opportunity to "Go, and do thou likewise,"
 to lend a hand to the poor, and the forlorn,
 to the sick and the halt.  In short, to join
 in the exciting and challenging task of help-
 ing to build a better America.
 objective
 That Is m
 .
 y
 That is the objective of our Democratic
 Party.
 What greater goal could man set for him-
 self than to live by the teachings of the
 Master?
 In closing, I want to cite a poem that to
 me points up the virtue of perseverance and
 the evils of complacency.  I hope that we
 heed it always:
 "Great nations rise and fall,
 The people go from bondage to spiritual
 faith,
 From spiritual faith to great courage,
 From courage to liberty,
 From liberty to abundance,
 From abundance to selfishness,
 From selfishness to complacency,
 From complacency to apathy,
 And from apathy back again Into bondage."

 V       ENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 1, 1965
 Mr. RYAN.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to
 bring to the attention of my colleagues
 an article by Drew Pearson which ap-
 ik
 Pl
 peared in the Washington Post of Fri-
 day, February 26.  The following article
 sheds light on the recent incident at
 Pleiku in South Vietnam.
 PLEIKU ATTACK NOT A HANOI PLOT
 (By Drew Pearson)
 Shortly after the Vietcong raid on Pleiku
 that caused the United States to retaliate
 with its first definite large-scale bombing
 raids on North Vietnam, this column re-
 ported that                                                                 the United  States had been
 mousetrapped and that the Pleiku attack
 was the result of a Chinese or North Viet-
 namese plot deliberately staged while Pre-
 mier Kosygin was visiting Hanoi.
 More complete information, now available
 from  the  battlefront,  shows  this  column
 was  in  error.  The  Vietcong  attack   was
 staged by a bedraggled handful of 100 men,
 or half a company, which was able to achieve
 success only because of sheer stupidity and
 lack of alertness by the Americans and the
 South Vietnamese.     The attackers had no
 idea that they would he able to penetrate
 to the very center of the American installa-
 tion as they did.
 That it was no Hanoi-conceived plot is
 obvious from the fact that Hanoi could not
 have planned to have all South Vietnamese
 personnel and all Americans asleep.
 A little band of Vietcong passed through
 two  villages before reaching Pleiku.   The
 South Vietnamese In the villages are sup-
 posedly friendly to the United States but they
 sounded no alarm.  The attackers cut the
 barbed wire around Pleiku completely un-
 disturbed, and walked right Into the center
 of the installation to place bombs alongside
 the barracks where Americans were sleeping
 and alongside planes which were completely
 unguarded.   They  retreated  without  an
 American or a South Vietnamese wounding a
 single one.
 SUCCESS UNEXPECTED
 There were some Vietcong casualties, but
 only from their own mortar fire. Their com-
 mander had never expected them to pene-
 trate so far inside, therefore aimed mortars
 into the center of the American installa-
 tion--another indication that there was no
 Hanoi plot.
 Secretary McNamara, one of the most level-
 headed executives ever to boss the Pentagon,
 was mousetrapped when he got out of his
 sickbed to hold an emergency press con-
 ference and defended the American forces
 as victims of a sneak attack.  Obviously he
 knew that some of the great military vic-
 tories of American history have resulted
 from sneak attacks, as when George Wash-
 ington sneaked across the Delaware to sur-
 prise carousing Hessians in Trenton.  Mc-
 Namara also knew that his own men were
 being trained in the art of the sneak attack
 at the very time he had the news conference.
 Only on a few occasions have American
 troops telegraphed their attacks In advance,
 as when General Pickett sent a Confederate
 nag at the head of his troops in the famous
 charge at Gettysburg-a charge, Incidentally,
 in which his defeat turned the tide of the
 Civil War.
 Those who were really mousetrapped as a
 result of the Pleiku incident were not only
 McNamara  but  President  Johnson  and,
 momentarily, the State Department. Singe
 then, Acting Secretary of State George Ball
 has tried to restore some reason and sanity
 to our mousetrapped thinking, which could
 have precipitated nuclear world war.
 What happened was that Ambassador Tay-
 lor, an able but severely harassed man who
 has seen his hitherto great prestige gradually
 eroded in Vietnam, seized this opportunity
 to recommend retaliatory raids.  He sincerely
 believed this was a Hanoi plot.  Ordinarily
 his recommendation might have been dis-
 counted in Washington, but it happened that
 McGeorge Bundy, White House adviser on
 security matters, was in Saigon at precisely
 that time.
 WHITE HOUSE PRESSURED
 Bundy's brother William is Assistant Sec-
 retary of State for the Far East and has long
 advocated a stronger hand in Vietnam, In-
 cluding bombing the north.  When Mc-
 George Bundy, therefore, joined Taylor in
 rushing back a premature, exaggerated ac-
 count of the Pleiku raid, the White House
 finally yielded to advice which the Bundy
 brothers had been giving for some time and
 which has now caused serious loss of Ameri-
 can prestige, demonstrations against Ameri-
 can embassies around the world, even in pro-
 West countries, and eroded the better under-
 standing Mr. Johnson had personally built
 up with the new leaders in the Kremlin.
 What the American public has a right to
 expect is a congressional investigation or the
 court-martial of American officers asleep at
 Pleiku.  The Pentagon alibi is that they are
 highly trained men who are not supposed to
 stand guard, which is correct.  But the fact
 remains that no one, not even South Viet-
 namese, was on guard and, as a result, ap-
 proximately 100 wounded, and several mil-
 lion dollars' wortla of planes destroyed.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. HORACE R. KORNEGAY
 OF NORTH CAROLINA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 1, 1965
 Mr. KORNEGAY.  Mr. Speaker, this
 morning I appeared before the Subcom-
 mittee on the Department of the Interior
 and Related Agencies of the House Ap-
 propriations Committee to testify in be-
 half of an item which would permit a
 greatly needed acquisition of land to en-
 large the Guilford Courthouse National
 Military Park, located in my congres-
 sional district and my home county of
 Guilford.
 I had hoped that Mr. Burke Davis, a
 longtime resident of my congressional
 district, and eminent historian, biog-
 rapher, and novelist, could also testify
 before the subcommittee in view of his
 historical perspective on the importance
 of the Guilford Courthouse National
 Military Park and the great importance
 of the Revolutionary battle fought there
 in March 1781. Mr. Davis, however, who
 now has an important connection with
 Colonial Williamsburg, Inc.,  and who
 presently resides in Williamsburg, Va.,
 had an important engagement in New
 York in connection with his duties and
 was unable to appear.  He prepared a
 fine statement in support of the appro-
 priation, however, and in view of its
 historical Interest and the importance of
 the subjects discussed, I should like to in-
 sert it in the RECORD believing that it will
 be of great interest to my colleagues.
 Mr. Davis' statement follows:
 The American Revolution was won in the
 South, and the climax of the bitter running
 campaign of 1781 came at Guilford Court-
 house, on March 15.  In a 2-hour battle, Lord
 Cornwallis lost a quarter of his already weak-
 ened army.  His retreat from this point led
 him to Yorktown.
 Today, the southern campaign of the Rev-
 olution is almost forgotten.  The field of
 Cowpens, S.C., is remote and neglected and
 seldom seen by visitors.  Sites of the fre-
 quent clashes between the forces of Corn-
