 EAST-WEST RELATIONS   .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  1
 In his 21 June speech and his 15 June television
 "report" on the Vienna meeting Khrushchev again em-
 phasized his determination to carry through with his
 announced policy on Berlin and Germany.            He has now
 publicly committed the USSR to sign a separate treaty
 and transfer to the East Germans control over access
 to Berlin if no East-West agreement is reached by the
 end of this year.   On the other aspects of the Ger-
 man problem and on the questions of disarmament and a
 nuclear test ban treaty, Khrushchev's statements fol-
 lowed closely the position set forth in the Soviet
 aide-memoire on 4 June.   He made no effort to rep-
 resent  the talks in Vienna as more than a "necessary"
 and "worthwhile" first step.   He did, however, defend
 top-level diplomacy as "essential" to the solution of
 current issues and indicated that these problems
 urgently required meetings by the heads of govern-
 ment.

 Basic agreement on the formation of a provisional
 government of national unity was announced by Boun Oum,
 Souvanna Phouma, and Souphannouvong in a 22 June commu-
 nique on their talks in Zurich.                               Details remain to be
 worked out in later talks, but it was announced that
 the coalition government would be formed through the
 "special procedure" of designation by King Savang with-
 out referral to the National Assembly.   The announce-
 ment of agreement at Zurich should give new impetus to
 the deadlocked Geneva and Namone deliberations, but
 does not assure a swift settlement of domestic and
 international differences over Laos.   Communist rep-
 resentatives at Geneva are still delaying implementa-
 tion of an effective cease-fire, and anti-Vientiane
 forces in Laos continue to improve their already
 strong military position.

 With the 19 June agreement between representatives
 of the Leopoldville and Stanleyville regimes on the re-
 opening of parliament, the long impasse between Kasavubu
 and Gizenga may be nearing an end.   Premier Ileo prob-
 ably will be dropped as head of the government; his
 likeliest replacement is Cyrille Adoula,  the able in-
 terior minister in Ileo's cabinet.                    Gizenga might ac-
 cept a vice-premiership under Adoula.  The Gizenga bloc
 probably still controls no more than 40 of the 137
 members of parliament, but his supporters probably will
 wield an influence out of proportion to their number
 as a result of their superior organization.   Katanga's

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Peiping's uncertainty on how to deal with the na-
 tion's numerous problems is indicated by its failure
 so far this year to convoke the National People's Con-
 gress--Communist China's legislature, which normally
 meets in the early part of the year to approve party
 programs.      The Congress has reportedly been postponed
 until fall, apparently in the hope that domestic news
 will improve by then.   Meanwhile the early vegetable
 and grain harvests have eased the food shortages, but
 since the early grain crop was poor, the improvement
 in the diet may be only temporary.

 The Soviet party central committee met on 19 June
 in a one-day plenary session and heard Khrushchev and
 Kozlov explain drafts of documents they are to present
 to the 22nd party congress in October.   Khrushchev re-
 ported on the new party program which is to chart the
 course of Communist development in the epoch of the
 "expanded building of Communism," and Kozlov,  apparently
 recovered from his recent heart attack, reported on a
 new set of party rules.   The shortness of the plenum
 makes it unlikely that there was serious discussion of
 other topics.   The fact that party leaders were sum-
 moned to Moscow on short notice suggests, however, that
 more urgent'subjects were under consideration; other
 high-level meetings at which such discussions could
 have taken place apparently preceded the plenum.

 The recently announced Soviet credit to East Ger-

 late the economy, but it probably is not large enough
 to support the investment goals and high growth rate
 of the original Seven-Year Plan (1959-65).   The credit
 may reflect a Soviet decision to effect a  gradual,
 rather than an immediate, reduction in East Germany's
 dependence on imports from the West, particularly
 West Germany.

 THE "TROIKA" DOCTRINE IN SOVIET DIPLOMACY   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 The tripartite control of international executive
 bodies has become a basic Soviet foreign policy objective.
 This doctrine, originally introduced by Khrushchev before
 the UN General Assembly last September, has been ex-
 tended to the control system of a nuclear test ban treaty
 and, by implication, to the control authority for any
 disarmament agreement short of "complete and general
 disarmament."  In advancing these proposals the Soviet
 leaders readily concede that their aim is to establish
 a veto over the decisions of any international enforce-
 ment agencies.  They insist in any case that such a veto
 is inherent in the concept of sovereignty.  The proposals
 reflect the Soviet premier's insistence that the execu-
 tive organs of international agencies must reflect the
 USSR's status as the great-power equal of the US.
 In an attempt to win support for this program, Moscow
 insists on a position of equality for the neutrals in
 the tripartite concept.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SU MRY
 The Soviet leaders on 21
 June took advantage of the pub-
 lic rally marking the 20th an-
 niversary of the German inva-
 sion to blame the Western de-
 mocracies for encouraging Hitler
 and to draw parallels with the
 current situation in Germany.
 Khrushchev's speech and an ad-
 dress by Marshal Malinovsky
 were generally anti-Western in
 tone and stressed that the USSR
 had the military capability to
 meet any Western challenge
 which might grow out of the sit-
 uation in Germany and Berlin.
 Khrushchev added that if
 the "imperialist powers" con-
 tinued to increase defense ex-
 penditures and the size of their
 armed forces, the USSR would
 be confronted with the neces-
 sity of increasing "allotments
 for armaments" and,  "if need
 be," of increasing the "numer-
 ical strength of our armed
 forces."
 had been at least partially suc-
 cessful by claiming that "I have
 the impression that President
 Kennedy understands the great
 responsibility that lies with
 the governments of two such
 powerful states," and that this
 awareness gave rise to hopes
 that international disputes
 could be solved.
 Khrushchev implied that
 in general there were still
 major obstacles to an accommo-
 dation between the US and USSR.
 As a specific example he ac-
 knowledged that a different
 interpretation of peaceful co-
 existence had emerged from the
 talks.   His discussion of the
 historical process of social
 revolution and his allegation
 of US interference in the in-
 ternal affairs of other coun-
 tries appeared designed to re-
 spond to those parts of the
 President's report on the Vienna
 meeting which dealt with the
 international Communist movement.
 In his "report" of 15 June
 on his meeting with the Presi-
 dent in Vienna, Khrushchev made
 no effort to represent the talks
 as more than a "worthwhile and
 necessary" first step.   However,
 he defended such high-level
 diplomacy as "essential" under
 modern conditions because con-
 troversial questions cannot be
 solved through normal diplomatic
 means; such questions "urgently
 demand a meeting of heads of
 government."  He indicated that
 the Soviets had had no great
 expectations, but that a frank
 exchange of positions on major
 issues was in itself quite im-
 portant.   He sought to convey
 the impression that the talks
 The most significant as-
 pect of Khrushchev's report
 was the emphasis on his determi-
 nation to carry through with
 his announced policy on Berlin
 and Germany.   He has committed
 himself publicly for the first
 time to take unilateral action
 and to sign a separate peace
 treaty if there is no East-West
 agreement before the end of
 1961.   He declared  on 21 June
 that the USSR would sign a peace
 treaty with East German  "at
 the end of this   ear."

 The Soviet premier's ex-
 position of other aspects of
 the Soviet position on Germany
 and Berlin has adhered closely
 to the memorandum of 4 June
 given to the US in Vienna.   In
 both speeches he stressed the
 danger of delaying the conclu-
 sion of a peace treaty and cited
 the US-Japanese peace treaty
 as a precedent for a separate
 Soviet - East German treaty.
 Although he made it clear that
 the East Germans would be grant-
 ed full control over Allied ac-
 cess to Berlin, Khrushchev on
 15 June stressed that access
 would not be prevented if the
 Western powers reached agree-
 ment with East Germany concern-
 ing such access.   He also warned
 that if "arms are brought into
 play" after a treaty,  the So-
 viet Union is capable of giving
 a "proper rebuff,"
 and guarantees for 'Vest Berlin.
 After contending that agreement
 had been nearly reached on the
 main points of difference during
 the Geneva foreign ministers'
 conference in 1959, Ulbricht
 asserted that he was confident
 that "satisfactory results"
 could be achieved "if the nego-
 tiations are now continued in
 a serious and businesslike man-
 ner."
 However,  the East German
 leader also set forth new de-
 mands for a Berlin settlement.
 For the first time he dealt in
 detail with the refugee problem
 after a separate treaty.   He
 demanded that the refugee camps
 in Berlin be abolished and that
 the "people engaging in this
 trade" leave Berlin.   He also
 made the usual reference to the
 end of occupation forces,  "agent
 centers," radio stations,  and
 any other means which serve the
 "preparation of war."
 Against the background of
 a stiffer bloc attitude on a
 peace treaty,  the East German
 regime has stepped up its de-
 nunciation of the Evangelical
 to Berlin, but emphasized that    I Church's all-German congress,

 sectors of the city.   These so-
 called "border crossers," now
 estimated to number almost
 57,000, are now being subjected
 to a "persuasion" campaign to
 take employment in East Germany,
 where their services are badly
 needed.   The East German party
 central committee issued a
 directive in late May calling
 for an intensification of this
 campaign.   However, unless the
 East German regime can seal off
 all access to West Berlin, fur-
 ther pressure will risk pro-
 voking a mass exodus.
 On the question of disar-
 mament, Khrushchev has taken a
 generally negative view.   He
 claimed in both speeches that
 all postwar negotiations had
 failed because the Western
 powers were not ready for seri-
 ous negotiations.   On 15 June
 he said,  "To put it frankly,
 they still do not want" disar-
 mament.   He repeated the stand-
 ard Soviet offer to accept any
 form of controls if the West
 agreed to complete and general
 disarmament and asserted that
 the control organs would operate
 freely without any "so-called
 veto."
 In his television speech
 Khrushchev referred only briefly
 to the bilateral talks on dis-
 armament which began on 19 June
 in Washington.   He stated,  "One
 hopes that this time we shall
 finally meet with a constructive
 approach from the US."  He did
 not reiterate his previous con-
 tention-that these talks should
 deal with more than the procedure
 for resuming multilateral nego-
 tiations; at the first session
 on 19-June,  however,  Soviet
 representative Zorin promptly
 suggested that the question of
 complete and general disarmament
 be discussed prior to negotiation
 on the precise forum for a new con-
 ference.
 Soviet propaganda has also
 emphasized that the main task for
 the Washington discussions was
 to "find ways" of solving the
 problem of general disarmament
 as well as agreeing on the com-
 position of the new forum.   A
 TASS dispatch criticized the
 "definite tendency" by the Amer-
 ican side to emphasize "procedural
 questions" concerning the composi-
 tion and work of a new disarmament
 committee.
 Having stressed that the
 Soviet Union was willing to
 accept any control over disar-
 mament, Khrushchev on 15 June
 claimed that the Western powers
 were "resolutely refusing to ac-
 cept Soviet proposals on the forms
 of control" for a nuclear test
 ban.   He repeated the position
 taken by the Soviet aide-memoire
 on the difficulties of achieving
 agreement in Geneva.   In support
 of the Soviet position, he raised
 the question of the consequences
 of French testing and warned that
 France's example may be followed
 by other countries when they
 have the appropriate technical
 prerequisites.   He concluded
 that in the "prevailing condi-
 tions there is no other way
 out" but linking the test ban
 with disarmament.
 On 21 June Khrushchev re-
 peated this line, and added
 that the USSR in its reply
 to the US note of 17 June
 dealing with the test ban nego-
 tiation's would "firmly ad-
 here  to the views we have
 stated."   In addition Khru-
 shchev warned that "as soon
 as" the US resumed nuclear
 tests the USSR would do so,
 and the US would bear the re-
 sponsibility.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMARY
 Agreement on the formation
 of a provisional government of
 national unity for Laos was an-
 nounced in the communique is-
 sued on 22 June in Zurich at
 the conclusion of the four-day
 talks held there between the
 Boun Oum,  Souvanna Phouma,  and
 Souphannouvong delegations.   No
 details were included in the
 communique,  although it was
 specified that the coalition
 government--consisting of rep-
 resentatives of three factions
 --would be formed through the
 "special procedure" of designa-
 tion by King Savang without re-
 ferral to the National Assembly.
 A new conference is to be ar-
 ranged at an unspecified time
 and place "in order to achieve
 national accord as soon as pos-
 sible."
 The developments at Zurich
 should provide impetus to the
 deadlocked deliberations at
 Geneva and Namone, but they do
 not assure an early settlement
 of domestic and international
 differences over Laos.   Tough
 negotiations lie ahead on such
 critical matters as the composi-
 tion of the coalition government,
 integration of the opposing mil-
 itary forces, and the timing of
 a new general election.   Also
 remaining to be worked out are
 the fundamental questions of
 guaranteeing Laos' neutrality
 status and of establishing ef-
 fective international supervi-
 sion and controls to assure
 that end.
 The special procedure
 adopted for forming the planned
 coalition government represents
 a compromise between the ini-
 tial positions held by the three
 factions,   The Boun Oum dele-
 gation had wanted to form a
 government headed by King Savang
 and approved by the National
 Assembly.   Souvanna and Souphan-
 nouvong were opposed to this
 on the grounds that the assembly
 was only a creature of General
 Phoumi, and that assumption of
 the premiership by the King
 would be unconstitutional.
 Savang himself has expressed
 unwillingness to participate so
 directly in the politics of the
 country.
 Phoumi's role in the pro-
 jected new government is of ma-
 jor interest.   Souvanna and
 Souphannouvong previously have
 indicated willingness to accept
 his participation provided he
 divests himself of his military
 connections.   On the unresolved
 question of division of the
 portfolios,  Peng Phongsavan,
 head of the Souvanna delegation
 at the Namone talks, recently
 said that a coalition cabinet
 should consist of six Souvanna
 supporters and four each from
 the Phoumi and Neo Lao Hak Sat
 factions.
 Phoumi's apparent willing-
 ness to reach a compromise set-
 tlement at Zurich  probably re-
 flects his realization that the
 longer the impasse continues, the
 more vulnerable individual mem-
 bers of the government delega-
 tion will become to offers by
 Souvannaof personal deals. This
 could eventually lead to Phoumi?s
 isolation and the collapse of
 the Boun Oum government.
 The Geneva and Namone
 talks, meanwhile,  have been

 marking time pending the out-
 come of the "little summit" meet-
 ing at Zurich.                        The talks at
 Namone, particularly,  have been
 ish agreement to a draft message
 from the Geneva co-chairmen ap-
 pealing to both the United
 States and South Vietnam  to
 sporadic and unproductive ever              abandon  the implementation of
 since mid-June when the Souvanna            military measures  which the
 and Souphannouvong delegations              USSR contends were agreed
 began insisting that the ICC rep-
 resentatives be excluded from
 both the political and military
 discussions.   This maneuver may
 have been dictated by growing
 Western pressures at Geneva for
 a more effective role for the
 ICC in investigating and super-
 vising the 3 May cease-fire.
 Soviet propaganda has por-
 trayed the Western position at
 Geneva as "unrealistic" and has
 charged that Ambassador Harri-
 man's 20 June proposals for
 strengthening the protocol to
 the French draft proposal actual-
 ly provided for setting up more
 control posts throughout Laos
 than those deemed sufficient by
 the 1954 Geneva conference. Mos-
 cow radio also claimed that the
 US delegate's proposals levied
 conditions which would prevent
 the early withdrawal of US per-
 sonnel from Laos.
 A Chinese spokesman in
 Geneva promptly denounced the
 US proposals as treating Laos
 like a vanquished nation.   Re-
 flecting Peiping's determina-
 tion to reject any arrangement
 which would circumscribe the
 activities of the Pathet Lao,
 he warned that US insistence on
 imposing an "international con-
 dominium" on Laos would lead to
 the breakdown of the conference.
 The Chinese spokesman asserted
 that a renewal of the war in
 Laos was certain if the US at-
 tempted to eliminate Communist
 forces there.
 On a related front,  the
 USSR has tried to obtain Brit-
 on                                                        during Vice President
 Johnson's visit to  Saigon.
 The proposed message  would
 take note of a North Vietnamese
 letter of 24 May expressing
 concern over a US decision to
 send additional arms and mili-
 tary personnel  to South Viet-
 nam.
 The North Vietnamese del-
 egation in Geneva has already
 cited the South Vietnamese issue
 as one which seriously threat-
 ens peace in Southeast Asia and
 continues to hinder the work of
 the conference. Hanoi formally
 requested the Geneva co-chair-
 men on 12 May and again on 24 25X6
 May to take urgent measures to
 prevent further US aid to South
 Vietnam.
 Moscow
 probably feels it will be able
 to cite this overture to Brit-
 ain as a matter of record if
 the bloc demands an expansion
 of the Geneva conference to in-
 clude the Vietnamese question.
 In Laos, the main military
 fronts remain generally quiet,
 but   behind  the lines  enemy
 forces   continue mopping-up
 efforts against isolated govern-
 ment  pockets.   Meo  forces

 lished about three miles south-

 Skirmishes and ambushes
 continue to occur in~other sec-
 tors, particularly along Rotate
 13 north of Vientiane and in
 the Luang Prabang area.   Some
 fighting about 25 miles north-
 east of Pak Sane appears to
 have resulted more from reac-
 tion to incursions made by gov-
 ernment forces since the cease-

 enemy efforts to take new ter-

 On 17 June there  was a
 skirmish involving   Pathet Lao
 and   South  Vietnamese   patrols
 about  six miles   inside    Laos
 where  Route   9   crosses   the
 Lao-Vietnamese  border.   The
 South  Vietnamese   patrol   con-

 killed  and wounded  on  the
 Pathet  Lao  side  and one  Viet-
 namese  killed                   and one wounded.
 As yet there has been no bloc

 incident, but it is susceptible
 to exploitation as a means of
 diverting attention from Commu-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 CONGO
 The agreement on 19 June
 between representatives of the
 Leopoldville and Stanleyville
 regimes on the reopening of
 parliament raises the prospect
 that the long impasse between
 Kasavubu and Gizenga may be
 nearing an end.   The agreement
 calls for parliament to meet
 at Lovanium University near Leo-
 poldville on 25 June, but the
 senior UN representative in
 the Congo considers 15 July
 a more likely date.   The UN is
 to provide protection for all
 deputies and institute rigid
 security measures to minimize
 the threat of outside influence.
 The agreement apparently
 was reached over the protests
 of Premier Ileo, who has long
 been reluctant to call parlia-
 ment.   Ileo, who has little
 legislative backing,  probably
 will be dropped as head of the
 government; his most likely re-
 placement is Cyrille Adoula,
 the moderate and able interior
 minister in the Ileo cabinet.
 Adoula would probably be able
 to obtain support from elements
 in both the Kasavubu and the
 Gizenga groups; Gizenga?s spokes-
 man in New York has expressed
 the opinion that the Stanley-
 ville leader would accept a
 vice premiership under Adoula.
 Estimates of the relative
 parliamentary strengths of the
 Kasavubu and Gizenga blocs con-
 tinue to indicate that the Leo-
 poldville faction is in the
 lead.    Gizenga has a strong
 minority position, however, with
 about 40 of the 137 votes, and
 many of the other legislators
 are unknown quantities.   More-
 over,  his supporters are the
 best organized group and prob-
 ably will be able to wield an
 influence out of proportion to
 their number.   There are indi-
 cations that the Leopoldville
 faction is becoming increasingly
 concerned at its inability to
 exert close control over its
 supporters.
 The position of the Katanga
 regime on the question of parlia-
 ment is unclear.   Negotiations
 in Milan earlier this month be-
 tween Katanga and Leopoldville
 officials produced the begin=
 nings of a rapprochement; how-
 ever,  Congolese in Elisabeth-
 ville,  in conversations with UN
 representatives, have been ignor-
 ing the talks and their implica-
 tions.   On 20 June the parlia-
 mentarians from Katanga announced
 they would not come to Leopold-
 ville unless Tshombd was released
 and the confederal structure
 proposed at the Tananarive con-
 ference last March adopted as
 the basis for a constitutional
 revision.
 Tshombe has now been re-
 leased and has announced his
 plans to return to Elisabeth-
 ville,   and  a  Katanga spokes-
 man has apparently withdrawn
 the condition concerning the
 Tananarive resolutions.   The
 deputies controlled by Elisa-
 bethville would furnish valuable
 support to the Kasavubu bloc
 in its disputes with Gizenga.
 Congolese Foreign Minister
 Bomboko recently told an Ameri-
 can official that Leopoldville
 authorities had proof that In-
 dian Charge Rabman had been in-
 volved in subversive activities
 against the Leopoldville govern-
 ment.
 a member of the Indian    25X1
 UN contingent and other UN of-
 ficials were implicated as well.

 and Congolese army elements.

 was arrested last week and may

 have furnished a basis for
 Bomboko's charges.   Bomboko
 allegedly hoped to ask Nehru
 to remove Rahmah quietly in the
 interest of Congolese-Indian
 relations.   Should the charges
 be widely publicized, the re-
 cent improvement in New Delhi's
 attitude toward the Congolese
 Government probably would be
 nullified.
 Neutralist nations continue
 to encounter difficulties in
 their efforts to send aid to
 Gizenga.   A flight to Stanley-
 ville, of a Ghanaian IL-18 al-
 legedly to transport "medical
 supplies" and "embassy person-
 nel," was canceled at the re-
 quest of the UN chief in the
 Congo.
 In Brussels,  Foreign Min-
 ister Spaak recently took is-
 sue with Hammarskjold's view
 that UN forces in the Congo
 probably could be reduced from
 20,000 to 5,000 by the end of
 the year.   Spaak believes the
 situation will remain so un-
 stable for at least a year that
 any substantial UN withdrawal
 would be dangerous.  Hammarskjo].d,
 in stating his views to British
 officials in early June, had
 also said he hoped to reduce
 the annual cost  of UN operations
 in the Congo from $120,000,000
 to $20,000,000.

 withdrawal of Belgian elements
 from the Congo.   He has told the
 American ambassador in Brussels
 that if Munongo does not release
 all of the 23 advisers whose re-

 they will be ordered to return

 other hand,  Spaak is reluctant
 to force the return of Belgian

 gendarmerie until replacements
 are available.   He has also de-

 Ministry official to Katanga to
 represent him, although for "po-

 immediately withdraw Belgian Con-

 behind the reform program,pub-
 licly expressed confidence that

 rectorate will have enacted the

 the directo-
 rate has apparently decided it
 can accommodate the increasing
 demands of the political parties
 for early elections. Most of the
 parties                       agreed
 to hold joint demonstrations for
 elections unless the directorate
 indicates by 30 June that it
 will put into effect an elector-
 al law which these parties re-
 cently drafted. Under this law,
 congressional and municipal elec-
 tions would be held on 17 Septem-
 ber and congress would in turn
 choose a provisional presidentto
 serve until regularly scheduled
 elections could be held in 1962.
 Heretofore, the armed forces
 have been doubtful that any
 Salvadoran political party is
 powerful enough to overcome
 the opposition leveled at the
 reform program both by the upper
 classes and by extreme leftists.
 The directorate, which hopes to   25X1
 receive shortly a number of
 loans from US and internation-
 al lending agencies, is anxious
 to use these funds on projects
 that will have an immediately
 visible effect in improving the  25X1
 national economy and the living    25X1
 conditions of the poorer classes.
 The Soviet party central
 committee met on 19 June in a
 one-day plenary session and
 heard Khrushchev and Kozlov ex-
 plain drafts of documents they
 are to present to the 22nd party
 congress in October. Khrushchev
 reported on the new party pro-
 gram which is to chart the
 course of Communist development
 in the epoch of the "expanded
 building of Communism," and
 Kozlov, apparently recovered
 from his recent heart attack,
 reported on a new get of party
 rules.   Although the committee
 was called into session on
 short notice, there are no in-
 dications that it considered-
 other subjects.
 High-level party meetings,
 however, were apparently held
 earlier in Moscow  for preliminary
 screening of the draft program
 and rules.   Other matters--the
 ticklish state of Soviet-A
 banian relations, for example
 --could also have been dis-
 cussed at that time.   Party
 presidium member Furtseva re-
 turned to Moscow on 15 June,
 cutting short her good-will
 visit to England by two days,
 presumably for meetings of the
 presidium.   Moreover, several
 Foreign Ministry officials who
 are also important party figures
 came back from assignments
 abroad.
 The program and the rules,
 technically speaking,  are party
 documents, which may explain
 why the plenum was a closed meet-
 ing restricted to party offi-
 cials rather than a mammoth semi-
 public assemblage on the pattern
 of recent plenums which dealt
 primarily with state economic
 matters.   The plenum resolution
 calls for publishing the pro-
 posed program on 30 July and
 the rules on 20 August 1961 for
 discussion by party members "and
 all USSR workers."

 The recently announced
 Soviet credit to East Germany
 of more than $475,000,000 for
 1961-65 will stimulate the econ-
 omy, but it probably is not large
 enough to support the investment
 goals and high growth rate of
 the original Seven-Year Plan
 (1959-65),   The credit apparently
 reflects a Soviet decision to
 effect a gradual, rather than
 an immediate, reduction in East
 Germany's dependence on imports
 from the West,  particularly
 West Germany.   However, Moscow
 has repeatedly indicated that
 if the West imposes economic
 sanctions,  the USSR will fully
 support East Germany.
 The form of the credit,
 announced only in a brief East
 German statement, has not been
 disclosed, but it probably rep-
 resents refinancing of outstand-
 ing East German indebtedness.
 Repayments on previous Soviet
 credits due during the next
 five years are estimated to be
 about the same size as the new
 credit.   There is no evidence
 that the Soviets have both post-
 poned these repayments and ex-
 tended new credits, nor is there
 any indication that foreign
 exchange is being made available
 to East Germany.
 This new aid agreement is
 thus probably not as favorable
 as that announced in the preced-
 ing five-year period (1956-60),
 when East German drawings on
 Soviet commodity and foreign
 exchange credits amounted to
 over $400,000,000 and most of
 the repayments due during that
 period were postponed.   Even
 if this new credit is only in
 effect a deferment of repayments,
 it still represents substantia L
 Soviet support, as about $100,-
 000,000 a year in East German
 resources which otherwise would
 have been used to meet debts
 will now be available for the
 investment program.
 At least part of these
 additional resources will prob-
 ably be used to purchase addi-
 tional goods from the USSR.
 According to the protocol, in-
 creased imports from the USSR
 will consist primarily of in-
 vestment goods, such as com-
 plete installations for the
 metallurgical, power,  and chem-
 ical industries, rolling mill
 products, nonferrous metals,
 chemicals, and machine tools--
 goods which will permit East
 Germany to continue its high-
 priority projects.   Probably a
 large part of the aid is ear-
 marked for the plants that are
 scheduled to deliver chemicals
 and machinery to the USSR and
 other bloc countries.
 This new aid is, however,
 only a partial response to re-
 peated East German pleas for
 support.   The magnitude of East
 Germany's aid requirements is
 indicated by the request made
 in September 1960 for a credit
 of over $375,000,000 to finance
 a trade deficit expected in 1961
 alone.   Because Moscow rejected
 this request,  East Germany had
 to cut back its 1961 investment
 program and initiate revisions
 in both its foreign trade and
 production plans.   An East Ger-
 man commentator has stated that
 the planned rate of growth
 through 1965 will continue to
 be 7.2 percent, the revised
 rate set for 1961, as compared
 with the 9.4 percent rate pro-
 jected in the original long-term
 plan.
 East Germany will continue
 to depend on the West for sup-
 plementary supplies of priority
 materials for the investment
 program,  for commodities not
 available within the bloc, and
 for new technology.   In the long
 run,  however,      increased Soviet
 deliveries of investment goods
 will result in a proportionate
 decline in the West's share in
 the East German investment pro-
 gram and will thus hasten the
 trend toward a diminishing level
 of dependence on imports from
 (Prepared by ORR)
 the West.

 Although North Korean trade out-

 almost nonexistent, trade pacts
 at present provide for commer-

 COMMUNIST CHINA
 Uncertainty ,among the party
 elite on how to cope with Commu-
 nist China's manifold ills and
 an unwillingness to see a pub-
 lic airing of its troubles are
 suggested by Peiping's failure
 to convoke the National People's
 Congress.   In addition, there
 has been little to suggest that
 the regime intends to make a
 gala of the 40th anniversary of
 the founding of the Chinese Com-
 munist party.   This event is
 less than two weeks away, but
 there has been almost no public-
 ity for what would normally be
 a major celebration.
 The National People's Con-
 gress--Communist China's rubber-
 stamp legislature--usually meets
 in the first half of the year
 to hear party policy explained
 and to ratify decisions taken
 earlier by the party leadership.
 This year's meeting, already
 postponed several times  has now
 been deferred until
 fall, perhaps in the hope that   25X1
 the news from the domestic front
 will Improve by then.
 The Chinese Communist lead-
 ers sorely need a domestic suc-

 for them to have so little to

 pecially since conservative op-
 ponents of the schemes--excori-
 ated at length by the party--

 policies of the leap forward
 and communes. The industrializa-
 tion drive has been slowed down,
 and all signs point to the prob-
 ability that 1961 will be a
 year of-further-consolidation and
 retrenchment.
 A bright spot for the au-
 thorities is the fact that the
 worst of the year's food short-
 ages is over.  The annual run
 of harvests--which will contin-
 ue until November--has  begun.
 With the taking of the early
 vegetable and grain crops, the
 quantity and variety of the
 marginal diet on which the av-
 erage Chinese has been existing
 should improve.   The American
 Consulate General in Hong Kong
 reports that some amelioration
 of the extensive malnutrition
 of last winter and spring fire
 became noticeable several weeks
 ago.   The authorities, by pro-
 viding supplementary rations
 and medical treatment and by
 easing workloads as well as
 other demands on energy,prob-
 ably reduced the symptoms in the
 worst cases. Advance distribu-
 tion of some foods stocks made
 possible by the promise of the
 early arrival of grain imported
 from Australia and Canada may
 also have helped.
 The improvement probably
 will be minor, however,  and pos-
 sibly only temporary. The winter
 wheat harvest in North China is
 about complete, and the press
 is conceding losses from the
 third consecutive year of
 drought, complicated by severe
 wind storms, hail, and frost dur-
 ing April and May. The provinces
 that suffered most from the ad-
 verse weather--Honan, Hopei,
 Shantung, and Shansi--are in the
 heart of the wheat belt and
 account for more than 60 percent
 of the total winter wheat acre-
 age.
 In the early-rice belt of
 southern China, rainfall has been
 unusually heavy over the past     25X1
 several months and there have
 been local floods.
 Ithe extent of
 the damage has not been estab-
 lished.   As of 18 June the heavy
 rainstorms had moved into the
 Yanztze and Huai river basins.
 It is too early to estimate
 prospects for agriculture for
 the year as a whole.   Clearly,
 however, much depends on the
 late-rice crop, which will have
 to be outstanding to avoid an
 even more barren winter and
 spring than those just past.
 For the present, however,
 the  emergency  food  situation
 is  at  an  end  and  the lead-
 ers                                                        can       turn  their  atten-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 THE SUDAN
 The 25,000-member Sudan
 Railway Workers Union (SRWU)--
 by far the largest trade union
 in the Sudan--went on strike on
 17 June despite a last-minute
 attempt by the government to
 avert this by dissolving the
 union.  According to the Ameri-
 can Embassy in Khartoum, the
 strike, which also includes the
 workers on the Nile River steam-
 ers,  is about 50 to 75 percent
 effective in the larger rail
 centers of Khartoum, Atbara,
 and Port Sudan, and slightly
 less effective in the smaller
 outstations.   The government
 has been forced to curtail
 train service drastically, and
 Labor Ministry officials have
 privately said that all rail
 traffic will cease if the strike
 continues to spread.
 Last March the SRWU pre-
 sented the government with de-
 mands for a 45-percent pay in-
 crease and a raise in the cost-
 of-living allowances.   The gov-
 ernment rejected the demands as
 unrealistic, although it has
 for some time been searching for
 a way to improve salaries and
 retirement benefits. When sub-
 sequent negotiations broke down,
 the union announced its inten-
 tion to call a two-week strike
 beginning 17 June.  On 14 June
 the government  dissolved the
 union, believing that the Com-
 munist party, which has heavily
 infiltrated the union, was insti-
 gating the strike in an attempt
 to embarrass the regime.
 The Supreme Council--the
 Sudan's top ruling body-
 surprised and cha-
 grined that this tactic had
 failed to halt the strike and
 is now uncertain as to what
 course it should take.   It has
 launched a propaganda campaign
 in an effort to curtail the
 strike's effectiveness, combin-
 ing threats of "severe legal
 procedures" against strikers
 with assurances that the govern-
 ment will try to settle the         25X1
 workers' complaints fairly.
 The American Embassy in
 Khartoum believes the government
 will try to "wait out" the strike
 on the assumption that the need
 for pay will force the workers
 back to their jobs; this same
 union maintained a strike for
 33 days.
 The coalition of political
 and religious leaders which for
 some time has been pressing for
 a return to civilian government
 is watching the situation close-
 ly, but so far has made no at-
 tempt to take direct action to
 capitalize on the situation.
 Siddiq al-Mahdi, the mainstay
 of the group,
 brought some 4,000 of his Ansar
 followers into the Khartoum area.
 However, in a speech to them on
 18 June, the Mahdi stressed the
 use of peaceful means for attain-
 ing their goal,  i.e., a return
 to civilian government.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 SPECIAL ARTICLES
 THE "TROIKA" DOCTRINE IN SOVIET DIPLOMACY
 Khru-
 shchev remarked that the time
 had passed when the United
 States could arbitrarily have
 its own way throughout the
 world.   He said the US must
 now take into account the views
 of other countries,  including
 the USSR.  These statements re-
 flect the Soviet premier's de-
 termination to gain acceptance
 of the USSR's claim to be recog-
 nized as the great-power equal
 of the US in the international
 arena.
 One of the instruments
 Moscow has devised for press-
 ing this claim is the "troika"
 doctrine, which insists that
 the executive organs of inter-
 national organizations be con-
 trolled by tripartite councils
 composed of representatives of
 the bloc,  the West,  and neutral
 states.   This doctrine, orig-
 inally introduced by Khrushchev
 before the UN General Assembly
 last September, has been ex-
 tended to the control system
 of a nuclear test ban treaty
 and,  by implication,  to the
 control authority for any dis-
 armament agreement short of
 general and complete disarma-
 ment.    The Soviet leaders
 have readily conceded that
 their aim is to establish a
 veto over the decisions of
 these bodies.
 Khrushchev has admitted
 that his proposal to replace
 the UN secretary general by a
 tripartite council grew out of
 the Soviet defeat in the Congo
 crisis last fall.   When he ar-
 rived in New York,                   bloc diplo-
 mats had been ignominiously
 expelled from Leopoldville by
 Colonel Mobutu and the Soviet
 UN delegation had been badly
 outmaneuvered in the special
 General Assembly session on the
 Congo crisis.   The Soviet pre-
 mier's reaction was to make
 Hammarskjold the scapegoat for
 this setback. He told neutral-
 ist leaders that the USSR had
 been humiliated in the UN for
 15 years,  but that the world
 power situation had changed
 and the Soviet Union was en-
 titled to a position commen-
 surate with its power position.
 In the face of almost unan-
 imous adverse reaction, Khru-
 shchev vehemently defended his
 proposal and warned that the
 bloc might consider establish-
 ing a competing international
 organization if the Soviet de-
 mands were not met.   Since the
 Soviet plan opened up the entire
 question of revising the UN
 Charter, including a review of
 the veto power, Khrushchev pru-
 dently stopped short of a formal
 proposal to revise the Secre-
 tariat.   He fell back on the
 standard Soviet proposal that
 any reform of the United Nations
 should await the admission of
 Peiping.   He did, however, seek
 to capitalize on some of the sen-
 timent in favor of charter revi-
 sion by suggesting that the
 Security Council be enlarged to
 ensure more representative geo-
 graphical distribution of the
 permanent seats.
 After Khrushchev's depar-
 ture, the Soviet delegation
 used the meetings of the spe-
 cial committee of experts on
 the Secretariat's activities
 and composition as the pretext
 to suspend its effort for UN
 reorganization.   The Soviet
 delegate stated that the USSR

 would be willing to wait for a
 special report on the structure
 of the Secretariat, which would
 be considered by the 16th Gen-
 eral Assembly next September,
 before taking up the proposals
 for reform of the executive or-
 gans.
 The tripartite concept
 again appeared when the nuclear
 test ban negotiations resumed
 in Geneva on 21 March after a
 recess of several months.   In
 his opening statement, the
 Soviet delegate withdrew previ-
 ous consent to a single adminis-
 trator for the control system
 and proposed instead that a
 three-member administrative
 council be established.   He de-
 fended this proposal along the
 same lines that Khrushchev had
 used at the UN--that interna-
 tional organizations must re-
 flect the realities of the world
 and the distribution of power.
 In the subsequent sessions the
 Soviet delegation made the tri-
 partite proposals an essential
 condition for a test ban treaty;
 top-level Soviet officials em-
 phasized that the Soviet Union
 would insist on Western accept-
 ance, even to the point of the
 breakdown of negotiations.
 Parity
 The Soviet drive for in-
 ternational equality dates back
 to the fall of 1957, following
 the launching of the first
 sputnik.   It has since been a
 consistent and fundamental So-
 viet policy aim to gain, when-
 ever possible and expedient,
 equal East-West representation
 in international conferences.
 Parity has sometimes taken the
 form of a demand for equality
 between Western and bloc coun-
 tries and sometimes for equal-
 ity of the total number of bloc
 and neutral countries on the
 one hand and Western countries
 on the other.
 In late 1957 the USSR in-
 sisted on reconstituting the
 UN Disarmament Commission so
 as to put the USSR in a less
 isolated position.   During the
 1958 summit campaign, Moscow
 proposed a conference of all
 members of NATO and the Warsaw
 Pact and,  alternatively,  sug-
 gested a more limited confer-
 ence, such as a US-Soviet meet-
 ing,  perhaps with a neutral par-
 ticipant.   During the inconclu-
 sive preparatory talks in 1958
 on a possible summit,  Soviet
 Foreign Minister Gromyko refused
 to meet the American, British,
 and French ambassadors together
 unless the Polish and Czech am-
 bassadors were also present.
 The first Soviet break-
 through in achieving parity
 occurred in the 1958 meeting
 of technical experts to dis-
 cuss methods of detecting nu-
 clear tests.   After the US had
 invited British,  French,  and
 Canadian experts to participate,
 the USSR invited Poland,   Czech-
 oslovakia, and Rumania.                                                                     A some-
 what similar situation occurred
 in the talks in 1958 on measures
 for the prevention of surprise
 attack, with five Western and
 five bloc countries participat-
 ing.                                                       A third breakthrough oc-
 curred in July 1959 when the
 Western powers agreed in prin-
 ciple to a disarmament forum out-
 side the UN with equal represen-
 tation of bloc and Western coun-
 tries.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 measure to ensure equal treat-
 ment.           The veto, Vishinsky once
 declared, is a means of self-
 defense.   In supporting the
 right of great powers to a veto
 in the UN Security Council,
 Stalin repeatedly rested his
 case on the principle of "una-
 nimity of action by the great
 powers."   "It is essential,"
 Stalin wrote to President
 Roosevelt in 1944, "that the
 council base its work on the
 principle of agreement and una-
 nimity between the four leading
 powers on all matters."
 Khrushchev and his col-
 leagues have defended the tri-
 partite concept in almost iden-
 tical terms.   If there is no
 agreement between the great
 powers--particularly the US
 and the USSR--it would be pref-
 erable to take no decision,
 Khrushchev has argued to sev-
 eral Western statesmen.   As he
 put it in defending the troika
 system for a nuclear test ban:
 "We demand for ourselves pre-
 cisely the same rights as the
 other parties to the treaty
 will have.   We do not seek to
 dominate, but neither shall we
 allow anyone to dominate us."
 Gromyko told Secretary
 Rusk in Vienna that the troika
 system without its veto aspect
 would make no sense.   Gromyko
 also told another American of-
 ficial that the USSR was seek-
 ing a veto over nuclear test
 controls but claimed that Mos-
 cow would apply it with dis-
 cretion.   Moreover, Khrushchev
 has argued that the US will
 eventually support the troika
 doctrine, since the UN majority
 will shift away from the US,
 and that the US and USSR will
 then have a common aim of pro-
 tecting their interests with
 the veto power.
 In elaborating the ration-
 ale behind the demand for equal-
 ity and the right of a veto,
 Khrushchev has added a new con-
 cept to Stalin's principle of
 great-power unanimity.   In the
 past,  the Soviet attitude toward
 the UN secretary general de-
 pended almost entirely on the
 extent to which he associated
 himself with the Western posi-
 tion--Trygve Lie, for example,
 was bitterly attacked only
 after the Korean war began.
 Khrushchev now contends, how-
 ever,  that there is no inter-
 national civil servant who
 could be expected to respond
 impartially to UN instructions.
 The Soviet aide-memoire on nu-
 clear testing of 4 June states
 flatly:   "While there are neu-
 tral states, there are not nor
 can there be neutral men."
 Moscow has nevertheless
 made itself the champion of the
 sanctity of the UN Charter and
 has consistently opposed any
 attempt to tamper with it.
 The USSR has assumed that any
 change in the charter aiming
 at greater effectiveness of a
 body dominated by unfriendly
 states would result in changes
 detrimental to Soviet interests.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 Khrushchev has sought to cap-
 italize on this by directing
 the troika system toward these
 states. The addition of a neu-
 tral representative also re-
 flects the gradual post-Stalin
 evolution of Soviet policy to-
 ward the neutral states which
 Khrushchev endorsed at the 20th
 party congress.
 Khrushchev contends that a
 revision of the UN structure is
 dictated by changes in the bal-
 ance of power since the UN was
 founded.   He recognizes that
 the UN structure was normal for
 the time it was devised and re-
 flected the actual state of
 affairs, but he claims that it
 now is out of date.   The UN, he
 says, no longer corresponds to
 the realities of political life
 because it fails to take into
 account the rise of the "great
 and powerful camp of the social-
 ist countries as well as the
 emergence of "new young states"
 which adhere to a neutral pol-
 icy.            The interest of the neu-
 tralists, Khrushchev contended
 last October, is not taken into
 account either in the Security
 Council or in the Secretariat
 of the UN.  In such a situation,
 Khrushchev argues, the only solu-
 tion is to make the UN reflect
 the "realities" of international
 life and to rebuild the UN Secre-
 tariat and Security Council so
 as to protect the interests of
 the three main groups of states.
 As part of his efforts to
 stimulate neutralist support
 for the tripartite plan,  Khru-
 shchev has sought to exploit
 the appeal of disarmament.   He
 claims that complete and gen-
 eral disarmament would not be
 possible without a revision of
 the UN executive, because a
 disarmed world would need ab-
 solutely impartial UN control
 of an international police force;
 by his own definition,   such
 impartiality could be guaran-
 teed only by tripartite control.
 Although Khrushchev has
 attempted to appeal to the neu-
 trals ~by granting them an equal
 status in his proposals, he is,
 of course, unwilling to accord
 a neutral representative the
 deciding vote.   He attacked the
 system of deciding by majority
 vote and asserted that it is
 "untenable" to apply a parlia-
 mentary system to an interna-
 tional organization.   The chief
 Soviet delegate to the Geneva
 nuclear talks explained that
 while the principle of a single
 individual responsible to a
 supervisory body did prevail in
 domestic affairs, this had noth-
 ing to do with the situation in
 international organizations.
 The chief Soviet delegate at
 the nuclear test talks has also
 explained that, while a single
 individual administrator could
 not be neutral in practice, a
 single individual in a tripar-
 tite council could represent
 the interests of neutral states,
 since they are all agreed on
 questions of "peace, colonial-
 ism, disarmament, and control
 of nuclear weapons and tests."
 Outlook
 The Soviet leaders prob-
 ably view the tripartite cam-
 paign as a protracted struggle.
 While Khrushchev insists on the
 principle of equal status for
 the bloc,  the West,  and the neu-
 trals, in practice the USSR
 probably will proceed by stages
 to achieve this aim.   In the
 UN, the Soviet initiative has
 renewed interest in the ques-
 tions of the enlargement of the
 Security Council and the reform,
 if not  revision,' of  the

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Secretariat.   There is some UN
 sentiment in favor of-appoint-
 ing three deputies to the secre-
 tary general; the USSR would
 undoubtedly view this as a step
 toward tripartitism.   The So-
 viets may also see such a com-
 promise as an expedient pending
 the end of Hammarskjold's term,
 when the original proposal
 would again be pressed.
 Another Soviet maneuver to
 reduce the secretary general's
 effectiveness and strengthen
 Soviet influence is the proposal
 to build up the Department of
 Political and Security Council
 Affairs,  currently headed by So-
 viet Deputy Under Secretary
 Arkadiev. The Soviet member of
 the UN experts' committee on
 the Secretariat also has sought
 to abolish the post of   ex-
 ecutive assistant to the secre-
 tary general, a position now oc-
 cupied by an American.
 In the nuclear test negoti-
 ations, Khrushchev and the So-
 viet delegate have made it clear
 that the USSR will stand by the
 troika principle. They have
 sought to undercut the objections
 to the veto feature by suggest-
 ing that this could be met by
 writing into the treaty specific
 guarantees for veto-free inspec-
 tions. However, on all other de-
 cisions,  some of which vitally
 affect the inspection plan,  the
 USSR insists on unanimous ap-
 proval. This manuever to reduce
 criticism of the veto as applied
 to disarmament reflects the So-
 viet leaders' sensitivity to the
 charge of self-inspection. Khru-
 shchev in his conversation with
 Ambassador Thompson last March
 implied that in the event of
 disarmament agreements,   there
 could  be  certain "rights"
 which  would not be subject to
 a veto.
 In the negotiations on a
 new forum for a multilateral
 disarmament conference, the So-
 viets originally proposed a 15-
 nation committee divided along
 tripartite lines.   In the sub-
 sequent bargaining, however,
 Gromyko indicated that full par-
 ity for the neutrals was not
 essential and that the USSR
 would settle for less. The USSR
 has also raised the troika con-
 cept in other international
 agencies.  In the International
 Atomic Energy Agency, Soviet del-  25X1
 egate Molotov did raise the pos-
 sibility informally.
 In
 UNESCO, the Soviet delegate only
 "recommended" a three-member
 board last fall.
 Khrushchev has, nonetheless,
 committed himself to the doctrine
 of tripartite control of interna-
 tional activities. On his return
 to Moscow from the UN last fall,
 he reported to a workers' meeting
 that the USSR had not put for-
 ward "proposals" for reorganiza-
 tion of the UN but had raised
 some "points of principle." He
 declared, however,  that if the
 organizational structure of the
 UN  is not  so arranged that the
 three groups of states are on an
 "equal footing," the UN "will
 commit suicide." In that event,
 "no group of states can oblige
 other states to carry out the de-
 cision adopted." As Walter Lippmann
 wrote after his discussion of the
 troika system with Khrushchev, a
 Soviet veto is to be the USSR's
 price for international coopera-
