 CCP PtTRGE AS REPORTED IN MAINLAND NEWSPAPERS,
 JANUARY - MAY 1  2
 From autumn 1951 to late spring 1952, the Chinese Communist Party carried
 out a purge of so-called recalcitrants, malfeasants, and deviationists from
 its ranks.  The number of members expelled does not seem to have reached serious
 proportions since the emphasis was on reform anr.reeducation rather than ejection
 from party ranks.
 The average CCP tenure of the purged members was 15-plus years.   The posts
 they occupied were predominantly on the intermediate and lower levels of the
 party machinery and government organs.  Top-level officials -- the "hard core"
 of the CCP -- have not been touched by the dismissals according 'o reports in
 the newspapers surveyed for this report.
 Party members operating in China's major cities constitute the bulk of
 purge victims.  The chief crime attributed to expelled members was breach of
 financial discipline; viz., acceptance of bribes, misappropriation of state
 funds and property, theft of state ecouomIc intelligence, and tax evasion.
 A few cases of opposition to higher level bo:ies of the CCP were present as
 noteworthy exceptions.  The emphasis throughout the purge appears to have
 been on habits of simplicity, honesty, frugality, and rigorous adherence to
 party tenets.
 Charges of bureaucratic style of work against top-level Communist officials
 evoked public confession from the officials but have not led to expulsion from
 the party.
 :here are iclications that new young activists are being taken into the
 party in increasing numbers.  The nationwide campaigns -- Resist America, Aid
 Korea, Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, and the Three-Anti's and Five-Anti's --
 have brought to notice, youths who seem to have discharged their campaign duties
 with near perfection.   In the words of a 9 April 1952 editorial in the Peiping
 Jen-min Jih- ao, these are the activists whom, "the party dared to promote" to
 solve the c   e problem.  The cadre problem refers to an apparent shortage of
 fully indoctrinated young people for work in the economic rehabilitation of
 China.

 This emphasis on youth and disparageme?:t of age appears to to an attempt
 to attract and maintain a high proportion of younger persons on the intermediate
 and lower levels of the CCP.   In this respect, the current purge may be viewed
 as party renovation.  It injects new blood into party ranks.  Years of party
 membership and revolutionary contribution are no longer major considerations
 in party status.  The chief criteria for political status appear to be per-
 fection in the execution of tasks designated by higher bodies and devotion to
 these bodies and their leaders.
 A.  Scope of Report
 In the preparation of this report on the nature and extent of the CCP purge,
 only Chinese Communist  newspapers have been used as sources.   They are listed
 in the appended sources and cover the period from 1 January to 1 May 1952.
 Special attention was given materials found in the Party Life Section of the
 Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao.
 B.  Course of Purge
 Since autumn 1951, the CCP has effected a purge of party members in organs
 ranging from hsien to regional level,   An editorial publishei in the 1 January
 1952 issue of the Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao stated that this purification move-
 ment would be keyed to the Three-Anti's Campaign.. The statement read as follows:
 "But members of the CCP must ltkewiee stut'y and reform their thinking.  Beginning
 in the autumn of 1951, the CC? has begun to reorganize its own basic-level
 organs.  This work will be universally developed in 1952..  The artiwaste,
 anticorruption, and antibure.iucracy struggle has furnished the reorganization
 work of the CCP with rich eo!,tent.?"
 Subsequently, mainland newspapers expanded their coverage of reports of
 disciplined or expelled CCP members.   Ir isolated caves, where recalcitrant
 members were executed, some papers carried as many as five articles on the
 affair.
 On 10 January 1952, Kan Kang, chairman of the Northe:.st People's Govern-
 ment and member of the central Commitaee, CCP, accelerated the drive with a
 report to the High.-Level Cadres Conference, Northeast itureau, Central Committee,
 CCP.  Eao scored liberalism and righ.iet deviations to the party in the follow-
 ing phrases;   "Whether  in :?rh??r or rural work,  we must oppose the rightist
 thought and overcome the huurcecs corrosion of  the party.  We must purge the
 party of any influence of nonproletarian thought.  and must avoid the vulgar
 atti,.ude of liberalism..,  Only by rigid regulation of the party ranks... shall
 we be able to accomplish our great tasks in 1952."
 In March and April 1952, reports on the p'trge in newspapers were at a
 peak.   By 1 Ma  1952, reports of the purge and reorganization had diminished.
 C. Et.,ent of Purge
 Expelled members of the CCP held positions in ch'u, hsien, municipal,
 provincial, and regional organs.   They ha' been in the party from 2 to 26 years.
 The average membership was 15-plus years.   Most of the expelled members held
 positions in China's major cities.  There were fever removals among party
 members working in rural areas.
 In some cases, staffs in party and government agencies were purged either
 in part or in full.  Examples of this on higher and intermediate levels are
 as follows:   on 2 Fet'uary 1952, the director and deputy director of the
 Administrative Office, Ministry of Public. Security, Central People's Government,
 were expelled from the party and shot; their entire staff was purged.   On

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/19: CIA-RDP80-00809A000700070594-4
 9 February 1952, the secretary of the Urban-Rural Liais,n Office, Wuhan
 Municipal People's Government, was expelled from the party and his entire
 staff was punished.
 Examples on lower levels are as follows:  on 9 January 1952, the Hankow
 C_h'ang-Chiang Jih-pao reported that all officers of the Sui-ch'uan Hsien Party
 C      ee,    angsi, had been expelled from the party; 20 percent of the com-
 mittee's cadres had also been found corrupt.  On 23 January 1952, the Peiping
 Jen-min Jih-pao reported that the entire leadership body of the Cbin-ch'i
 Es:ea Party Committee, Kian3si, had been dismissed from tneir posts and that
 corrupt elements had been expelled from the party.
 D.     Nature of Purge
 A significant aspect of the purge is the admission by CCP leaders that
 certain veteran party members were corrupted by the urban bourgeoisie.  This
 has taken place during the 3-odd years that the CCP has operated in China's
 major cities, but the number of party members thus corrupted is reportedly
 small.
 On 1 January 1952, the Shanghai Chieh-fang Jih-pao carried the report
 Chen I, mayor of the Shanghai Nomicipal People's Government, made to an anti-
 corruption conference of the East China Military Command.  Chen stated that
 the social atmosphere in the major cities of East China had had a degenerative
 effect on weaker party cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.
 On 10 January 1952, Kan Kang stated that some veteran members of the CCP had
 succumbed to the bourgeoi, "attack" during the 3-odd years since the party
 moved to the major cities of the Northeas-
 Articles in the Party Life Section of the Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao reveal
 Chinese Communist concern over the challenge presented by the large cities.
 The articles criticized malfeasance and lapse in discipline,   Poor responsiveness
 to and deviation from high-level directives were attributed to the geographic
 shift in the CCP's foci of operation, that is, the move from rural areas to
 the cities.  Some articles praised model cadres for maintaining habits of'
 simplicity, honesty, frugality, and discipline after entering the cities.
 A typical article lauded a party member, now 55 years old, who, after
 receiving the post of Commander, Communizations Battalion, Public Security
 Bureau, Hangchow Municipal People's Government, vowed that he would never
 compromise the principles of rural living.  He warned against the evils of
 urban living in the following sentences:    If after entering the cities, we
 forget the past and cast away our simple a.,d Spartan habits, our thinking will
 be transformed.   We will proceed to plan for gr:.t and gain.   This is a very
 dangerous matter."  This article covered one-fourth of a page of the Party Life
 Section, 20 February 1952 issue, Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao.
 Top-level party members working in China's major cities were held responsib,.e
 for setting an example in conduct.   On 8 January 1952, the Peiping Jen-min
 Jih-pao carried the confession of Shih Liang, Minister of Justice, Central
 People's Government.  In confessing tc luxurious urban living, the use of
 face-saving and other bourgeois emotions in administering justice, and advocacy
 of private ownership of property, Shih srid that it was necessary for high
 officials to set the proper example for city living.  A passage from the
 report of her confession reads as follows:  "Shih Liang declared that now she
 realizes that as a revolutionary cadre and a minister of the Central People's
 Government, it was wrong to lead a petit bourgeois or bourgeois city life.
 Shih considers it imperative that cadres practice introspection and endeavor
 to lead simple lives."

 Newspaper reports mention at least seven other errors committed by CCP
 members since their entry into the cities.  These are as follows:   (1) opposition
 to higher levels,   (2) rightist tendencies,   (3) breach of financie  discipline,
 (4) cooptation of colleagues and unqualified persons,   (5) sectarianism,
 (6) adherence to seniority and past achievement, and (7) bureaucratic style of
 work.
 1.  Opposition to Higher Levels
 There have been relatively few charges of CCP members opposing the
 rulings of higher bodies of the party.  In at least two Important instances,
 however, when senior members were accused of opposition, it was charged that
 the offenders had openly disagreed with rulings of' the Central Committee, CCP.
 These were the cases of Sung Ying, female, deputy director, Public Health
 Bureau, Wuhan Municipal People's Government, and Tai Chi.-ying, secretary,
 K'ai-feng Municipal Committee, CCP.   In addition it was charge' that the
 offenders had suppressed criticism from the masses,   in defendln; them3elves,
 they had dared to question information given the authorities by the masses,
 and, had denied the principle of party infallibility   Both were expelled from
 the party.
 This error was the central theme of the 10 January 1952 address of
 Kao Kang, chairman of the Northeast Peoples Government.   In his address, Kao
 Kang crfeicized the leniency shown the urban bourgeoisie by solicitous cadres.
 He demanded more militant action of CCF cadres in the following words'   "The
 national victory of the Chinese Revolution has led some members to an erroneous
 idea.  This idea has bred certain mistaken concepts on the party of our members
 who, instead of intensifying their class struggle under new conditions, tend
 to slacken in this struggle...   If we let the crafty merchants corrupt our
 cadres with unlawful acts and fail to punish these merchants, then that is
 undoubtedly a rightist trend.."
 In their Party Life Sections, Chinese Communist newspapers have
 stressed this tendency toward rightism.   Senior cadres havc peen accused of
 leniency and kindness in prosecuting the Five-Antis Campaign against the
 bourgeoisie.   In several instances, cadres having over 14 years of party member-
 ship have been accused of rightist deviation.   For example, on 19 January 1952,
 the Party Life Section of the Peiping Jen?min Jih-pao carried the CCP decision
 to expel Han Lin-ktang, deputy chief, Chu Austerity Inspection Committee,
 Peiping Municipal Committee, CCP.   Han was charged with having shown kindness
 to local merchants and with having ordered subordinate cadres to overlook
 minor misdemeanors.
 There have been charges that rightist tendencies become manifest when
 senior cadres fail to carry out the anticorruption drive in their own organi-
 zations.  For example, Yuan Ti-min., editor of the Kansu Jih-pao, replied to
 the demands of the drive by writing a letter to theeKansu Provincial Committee,
 CCP.  Kan submitted that if one person in his organization who had grafted or
 otherwise misappropriated over 100 million yuan were found, he, Yuan, would
 voluntarily accept party punishment.   Several instances of such corruption
 were discovered.   On 6 March 1952, Yuan publicly confessed, in the Party Life
 Section of the Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao, to rightist tendencies.   His punish-
 ment was not reported,

 Other members of the CCP    in most cases party veterans -- have been
 accused of. rightist tendencies in the execution of the following tasks:   sup-
 pression of counterrevolutionaries,  implementation of land reform, effectuation
 of the united front policy, and investigation of merchants.  Their unwillingness
 to adopt more militant attitudes and more vigorous tactics in the prosecution
 of the class struggle was scored and subsequently they were expelled from the
 Party.
 This is the charge most frequently leveled against members who have
 been expelled from the party.  The crime has usually consisted of acceptance
 of bribes, graft, embezzlement, tax fraud, and theft of state property and
 economic intelligence.
 The newspapers have also carried reports of veteran CCP members who
 were purged for having clandestinely operated private business enterprises or
 for having invested capital in private firms.
 The primary reason for loss of party status any membership has been
 the victims' misappropriation of 100 million yuan or more.   In two impo.cant
 cases, senior members who had pilfered Huge sums of mo_:y -- Liu Ch'ing-san
 and Chang Sou-sham -- were expelled from the CCP and executed.  The rule
 appears to have been expulsion from the party in instances where fiscal theft
 exceeded 100 million yuan.
 On 10 February 1952, the Hankow Chang-chiang Jih-pao reported what
 appears to have been an exception to this ru c.  Wi Wen-s     ecretary of the
 Northwest Culture and Education Committee, and member of the CCP, was given a
 notice of demerit and an opportunity to confess publicly his embezzlement of
 1,070 million yuar and establishment of a private business.   He was not erpelled
 from the party.
 Members of the Public Security Bureau have al--o t-en expelled from the
 CCP and relieved of their posts during the course of the purge    On 30 January
 1952, cadres of the Ping-nan Helen Public Security Bureau, Shantung revealed,
 in a letter to the editor of the Peiping Jen-min Jih?pao, that Tung If'o-chung,
 deputy director, Ping-nan Hsien Public Security Bureau had obtained large
 sums of state funds through graft..   Tung was subsequently expelled from the
 party.  On 19 April 1952, the Nanking Hain-hu- Jih-pao disclosed that five
 subbureau officers of the Nanking Public Security Bureau had been relieved
 of their posts and imprisoned for failure to return misappropriated funds.
 According to newspaper reports, the crtegories of punishment for
 breaches of financial diucipline are as follows.   (1` execution,   (2) expulsion
 from the party,   (3) 1-2 years of party surveillance,   (4) mass accusation, and
 (5) reprimand and notice of demerit.
 Such punishment has been seldom mentioned.   Newspaper reports
 reveal that only responsible senior party member, who had misappropriated huge
 sums of money and who had bribed, or otherwise corrupted many subordinate
 cadres, have been shot.
 On 10 January and 2 February 1952, the Peiping Jen-min Jih?-pao
 reported the corruption case of the director and deputy director, respectively,
 of the Administrative Office, Ministry of Public Security, Central People's
 Government.     These top-level officials had corrupted over 80 percent of their
 staff and office personnel in the course of mishandling hundreds of millions
 of yuan.  They were relieved of their posts, expelled from the CCP, and sub-
 sequently shot.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/19: CIA-RDP80-00809A000700070594-4
 Another example of the execution of corrupt party members is the
 case of Liu Ch'ing-san and Chang Tzu-shan, secretaries of the Tientsin Chu
 Committee, CCP.  Reports on 2, 5, and 15 January in the Party Life Section of
 the Peiping Jen-mih Jih-pao, disclosed that they had corrupted subordinate
 cadres by se   ng merc     use to them,  The Hopeh Provincial Committee, CCP,
 requested their expulsion from the party s.   immediate execution; all impli-
 cated party members were required to svti                                         _,; written confess tons and await less
 severe punishment.
 b.  Expulsion From Party
 Most cases of breach of financial discipline have resulted in dis-
 missal of the offender from the party.
 c.  Party Surveillance
 Accomplices of corrupt senior party cadres usually have been put
 under party observation.  Misappropriation of sums under 100 yuan have been
 sufficient cause to apply this punishment.   The punishment consists in re-
 moving the offender from party and civil posts or, in the event that such
 action is not taken, the offender is placed under surveillance of the party or
 civil organ to which he is attached.   He is then given an opportunity to study
 and reform.     The studies to be mastered during reformation are selected from
 Marxist-Leninist literature and the works of Mao Tse-tung.   It is not clear
 whether reform-through-labor is applied in such cases.
 d.   Mass Accusation
 This punishment is usually applied in cases where investigation
 has exonerated the offender in part.   Oral and written confessions are usually
 required, the former at joint cadre meetings,
 e.   Reprimand and Notice of Demerit
 Such punishment is administered to members for minor misdemeanors
 and usually evokes confessions and promises to reform   Reprimands and con-
 fessions are made in public at mass meetings.
 On 4 January 1952; a general statement on the severity of punish-
 ment to be given fiscal offenders was printed in the Peiping Jen-min Jih-
 An editorial, which opened with a quote from Mao Tse-tung's  a             uao
 pronouncement on financial  malfeasance  among CrP members,  arreder 1942 ll
 ing
 s, carried the follow-
 ing statement:
 those of 'unclean hands' ought to be classified accord-
 ing to severity and number Zof crimes], thoroughly investigated, and given
 commensurate punishment.          If those who have faithfully contributed to the
 struggle of the people's revolution but subsequently lost their footing -- if
 they candidly confess to these small errors, they will be given light sentences,
 or not sentences at all.         But serfou., ,,rafters, like Liu Ch'ing-san and Chang
 Tzu-shan, can never be forgiven regardless of their revolutionary achievements
 and contributions.  All such renegades and poisonous insects must be extermi-
 nated.  In purging them, the party suffers no loss, but gains instead; it does
 not lose in popular faith, but gains to trust.   If we are resolute and militant
 in this expurgation, then we can fix and strengthen the ranks of the popular
 revolution and the CCP.   We will be eternally free of the degenerate ideology
 of the capitalist class."

 The following passage, taken from the Party Life Section of the
 23 January 1952 issue of  he Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao, is a more detailed
 example of the manner in which punishment for errant party members is graduated:
 "Members of the Sui-ch'an Hsien Party Committee, Kiangsi, have
 impaired party activity, squandered state funds, and destroyed popular faith
 in the CCP and the central People's Government by becoming bourgeois degenerates.
 To expunge their names from the party roster and to purify 'tarty organizations,
 the Kiangsi Provincial Committee, CCP, has decided tc punish the Sui-ch'uan
 Helen Party Committee by completely cutting away its leadership machinery,
 "Chico Erh-kung, secretary of the Haien Party Committee, shall
 be expelled from the party.  Sun Yuan-fa, member, listen Party Committee and
 concurrently hsien magistrate, shall be put under party surveillance for one
 year (the Kiangsi Provincial Committee has applied to the government to relieve
 him of his post of hsien magistrate).   Lu Pin, director, Hsien Public Security
 Department, shall be expelled from the party (the Kiangsi Provincial Committee
 has applied to the government to relieve him of his posts).  Yu Han-feng,
 director, Hsien Party Committee Propaganda Department, shall face mass accusation
 and submit a confession.
 "The Chi 'an Local Party Committee, which has taken an individual-
 istic attitude with regard to the Sui.-ch'uan listen Party Committee incident,
 shall by punished by reprimand.   Other offenders, whose mistakes are more
 serious, shall be given special punishment.   For example, Wang Chih-Jung,
 secretary, Chu Party Committee, shall immediately be expelled from the ranks.
 Judicial organs shall be asked,  in compliance with procedure, to give Wang
 the extreme penalty,.
 "Since the Kiangsi Provincial Committee, JCP, did not take timely
 action in this case, the committee shall also cobalt a confession."
 A similar example of graduated punishment we" carried in the
 30 March 1952 issue of the Peiping organ.   Another hsien party committee ??-
 Chiao-ho in Kirin Province -- wea charged with breath of financial discipline.
 The entire leadership staff was expelled from the CCP and lesser cadres given
 various sentences,
 4.              Cooptatlon of Colleagues - 71 Unquai.ified Person_
 There have been a feu instances o:  party members employing personal
 friends and persons of duuiuuc ccciai and rviitieal b..ckgrosnds    Offenders
 have been accused of marring the purity o' party organizations.   On 31 March
 1952, the Party Life Section of the Shanghai Chieh?fanc, Jih-pao discussed the
 case of Ma Nai-sung, deputy secretary, Shanghai Iransport Enterprise Committee,
 CCP.  Na, a party member for dO years, had been working as an agent for the
 Shanghai Public Security Bureau; he was accused of having appointed 19 personal
 friends t;: hii Transport Enterprises Committee. He had also hired 20 or 30
 persons of dubious social and political origins for work with the Public Security
 Bureau.   For this, Ma was expelled from the CCP.
 The Chinese Communists broadly define this crime as the disparagement
 of younger cadres by party veterans; an intraorgan schism between the different
 age groups is usually the result.  During the recent purge mention of sectarian-
 ism has been frequent.   On 23 January 1952, the Party Life Section o: the Peiping
 organ carried a report of the dissolution of the entire Sui??ch'uan Hsien Party
 Committee, Kiangsi. Grave sectarianism was one of the charges leveled against
 committee members; the result was intracommittee feuding between younger and
 older cadres.  In other cases, especially when old party members were expelled
 from the party, charges of slighting and neglecting the younger cadres have been
 lodged.

 6.  Adherence to Seniority and Past Achievement
 Veteran cadres, who had openly manifested pride over long party member-
 ship and past achievement, have been accused of egotism.  Veterans have been
 expelled from the CCP for such conceit.  According to newspaper reports, self-
 pride has been considered a sin in itself; but the inference appears to be
 that lack of aggressiveness and discipline are the real sins.  Editorials and
 feature articles have warned older cadres that their liberalism and individual-
 ism cannot be forgiven on the grounds of early contribution to the revolution.
 Strict compliance with party policy and discipline has been presented as a
 postulate not to be compromised by either the young or the old party member.
 On two separate occasions, the Peiping Ten-min Jih-pao devoted the
 entire Party Life Section to the matter of seniority and pride.   Tn 3 February
 1952, the Peiping paper defended the expulsion of I Chi-kuang, former vice-
 mayor, Wuhan Municipal People's Government.   Soviet doctrine was cited.  The
 following is an excerpt from the article:
 "Some party members say,  'I Chi-kuang is an old party member. He has
 contributed much to the cause of the revolution and despite one bad affair --
 actually a trifling matter -- he should be given only a light sentence.'  This
 is incorrect.   It is just because he is an old and important cadre that the
 party and the people may make the highest demands upon him.   He must remain a
 member of the highest standards.
 "We must point out how Stalin dealt with this problem in the VKT (b):
 'fuch member must be cut off from leadership positions regardless of what
 merit they have accrued in the past.... We must smash this arrogant attitude
 of reckless egoism.   Officials must rot be ennobled.   Party members must be
 called upon to beware of this evil.  We are severe in this matter because it
 is axiomatic that party and Soviet discipline must remain inviolate in all our
 undertakings.'   (See Problems of Leninism, p 637)"
 On 15 March 1952, the Party Life Section of the Peiping official party
 organ carried an article which discussed seniority in the CCP.   The concept
 of seniority and the twin evils of arrogance and individualism to which it
 gives rise were condemned in the following phrases:   "A small part of the old
 cadres are becoming ircreaal.naly useless and decnd^nt because they believe in
 seuiority....They regard themselves as special pers,nages -- possessors of
 seniority -- insiuc aria outside of the party.  They nevelot serious tendencies
 toward individualism, liberalism, and attitudes which ebnee'ite organization
 and strict discipline.... Those old party members who nave been expelled, while
 few in number, suffice to show the degree oi  bourgeois corrosion of party
 ranks."
 The willingness of the CCP to have propagandists discuss this purge
 in party newspapers reaffirms the role of these papers as primary vehicles for
 indoctrination in Chins today.   Readers are advised to pay close attention to
 and learn the "correct" lesson from these accou:.ts of expulsion.   On 17 March
 15 2, the Su-nan Jih-pao was severely criticized by the Shanghai. Chieh-fang
 Jih- ao for not publishing news of and comment on the dismissal of senior party
 in the East China area.
 This charge has been leveled primarily, altLough not exclusively,
 against top-level officials of the CCP.   It refers to laxity in the execution
 of administrative matters and delay in the adjudication of lower-level corruption
 cases.     The charge by itself '.oes not appear to constitute grounds for expulsion
 from the party; concomitant charges seem to be necessary for such action.

 Instances of confessions of e. few top-level Communist officials to
 bureaucratic style of work are given below with their newspaper sources:
 a.  Li Li-san, member, Central Committee, CCP, and Minister of Labor,
 Central People's Government, (Peiping Kung- en Kih-pao, 9 January 1952 and
 Peiping Pang-ming Jih-pao, 13 January 195
 b.  Teng Tzu-hui, member, Central Committee, CCP, and vice-chairman,
 Central-South Ch.L.na Military and Administrative Committee, (K'ai-feng Honan
 Jih-pao, 21 February 1952)
 c.  Liu Ning-i, chief, International Liaison Department, All-China
 Federation of Labor, and member, representing the All-China Federation of
 Labor, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, (Peiping Kung-,den
 Jih-pao, 3 January 1952)
 d.  Li Mu-an, Vice-Minister of Justice, Central People's Government,
 (Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao) 8 January 1952)
 There have been no reports of punishment of these officials.
 Entire provincial party committees have been accused of bureaucratic
 style of work.   On 5 January 1952, the Peiping Jen-min Jih-pao carried charges
 of bureaucracy against the Hopeh Provincial Committee, C P, and on 9 January
 1952, the Hankow Chang-chiang Jih-pao carried a similar charge against the
 Kiangsi Provincial Committee, CCP.  Both committees were accused of failing
 to act promptly in handling lower-.'.evel corruption cases.  They were briefly
 reprimanded in the papers and required to submit confessions.  There has been
 no subsequent mention of punishment.
 Expelled CCP Members
 The following table lists 32 purged CCP members, their party and/or
 government positions held, date of party entry, number of years of party member-
 ship, and charges leveled against them.  From this table it can be seen that
 the average years of membership of the purged members was 15 plus, that toe
 positions held were on the intermediate and lower levels, and that the crimes
 charged were primarily some ;  n of corruption.  The table does not include
 all purged members mentioned in the newspaper sources appended.  Although
 other victims of the purge were mentioned, they were not included in the
 table because the date of entry into the party and/or charges against them
 was not reported.
