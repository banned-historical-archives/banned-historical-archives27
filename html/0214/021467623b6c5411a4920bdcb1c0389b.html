 OPEC's latest failure to agree on oil prices and production quotas will
 intensify downward pressure on prices. We would expect some further efforts
 to forge an agreement with OPEC before the Saudis cut prices as threatened.
 Mexico: Fast Start but Long Way To Go
 President Miguel de la Madrid has made a fast start in addressing Mexico's
 financial and economic crisis, but we expect increasing pressures on him to
 backslide and we see no letup in persisting financial problems. We believe that
 concessions to maintain what he views as minimum consumption and to
 preserve the ruling party's traditional social and economic programs will cause
 Mexico to miss-perhaps by wide margins-some of its quarterly IMF
 stabilization targets. Economic recovery and expansion in consumption are
 likely to be postponed until 1985 at the earliest.
 Saudi Oil Capacity: Impact of the Weak Market
 Saudi Arabia has decided to reduce oil production capacity to 8.5 million b/d
 over the next several months. Anticipated reductions in Saudi capacity should
 not by themselves affect the market.
 USSR: The Astrakhan' Natural Gas Project
 Having secured Western assistance in developing the Siberia-to-Western
 Europe gas pipeline, Moscow is again turning to the West for equipment to
 develop its natural gas reserves at Astrakhan'. The Western countries involved
 in the bidding are considering ways of accommodating Soviet demands for
 highly concessionary interest rates.

 OPEC's latest failure to agree on oil prices and production quotas will
 intensify downward pressure on prices. Buyers will further delay purchases
 and draw upon inventories in anticipation of lower prices and a seasonal
 downturn in consumption this spring. Unless an agreement on production
 quotas or price cuts is reached soon, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab
 producers in the Persian Gulf could bear the brunt of the 1-million-b/d or
 more decline in demand that we project for the second quarter. Rather than
 accept this outcome, we believe that Gulf producers will carry out their threat
 to cut prices, risking retaliatory cuts by other producers.
 OPEC ministers reached tentative agreement on the first day of their Geneva
 meeting on an allocation scheme to restrict overall crude output to about 17.5
 million b/d. According to the Venezuelan Oil Minister, under this scheme
 Saudi Arabia would be limited to production of 4.5 million b/d, Iran would be
 allowed 2.5 million b/d, and Libya would produce 1.2 million b/d. These
 quotas represent significant concessions from demands that earlier had
 obstructed a pact. OPEC production has fallen sharply this month, however,
 and it is questionable whether the 17.5-million-b/d ceiling would be sufficient
 to absorb the market surplus in the months ahead.
 Arab Gulf states foresaw difficulty in marketing their allotted production
 without some realignment of prices and made their support for new quotas
 conditional on an increase in the prices of Iranian and high-quality African
 and Iranian crudes. The agreement broke down when these producers refused
 to accede. After the meeting, OPEC President Dikko from Nigeria claimed
 that a consensus on the 17.5-million-b/d ceiling still stood, but Saudi Oil
 Minister Yamani labeled the session a complete failure.
 Saudi Arabia now faces a difficult decision. Early this month its largest
 customers told Riyadh that they would reduce purchases drastically unless the
 Saudis cut prices. Saudi output already has fallen under 5 million b/d this
 month and could drop well below 4 million b/d early this spring. The Saudis
 had hoped to improve their situation through the OPEC forum and took the
 lead in calling for the special session. Evidence has been mounting that the
 Saudis are considering discounts or price cuts to buoy sales in the absence of
 an OPEC agreement, but any move along these lines probably would be taken
 in concert with other Arab Gulf producers. Kuwait's Oil Minister has been

 among the most vociferous in threatening to cut prices, and the UAE Oil
 Minister said after the Geneva meeting that the Emirates will increase their
 output by several hundred thousand b/d.
 Any Saudi move to cut prices unilaterally would be a major change in policy
 by Riyadh. In addition, the risks of a price war may cause the Saudis to delay
 any unilateral price moves until further efforts to forge an agreement within
 the cartel are attempted. The Saudis did achieve significant progress toward
 an acceptable production sharing arrangement at Geneva, and Nigeria's
 delegate indicated afterward that the African states would be willing to meet
 next month to address the issue of price differentials. The Saudis, moreover,
 recognize that further weakening of the market will probably increase the
 willingness of other OPEC members to bargain, particularly if North Sea
 producers or Mexico yield to buyer pressure to reduce prices. In our judgment,
 the Saudis still see substantial benefits in operating within OPEC.
 If OPEC cannot reach an agreement on realigning prices, we believe the
 likelihood of independent action by the Arab Gulf states will grow. The Saudis
 then might attempt a price cut of about $2 per barrel, which they believe
 would restore the proper price differential with African crudes. Riyadh could
 argue that a cut of this magnitude would not warrant competitive price cuts by
 Iran or producers outside the Persian Gulf. If these producers held the line on
 prices, a cut of this size probably would lead to a more even sharing within
 OPEC of the further decline in oil sales that we expect next quarter.
 An unmatched Saudi price cut on the order of $4 per barrel, the maximum the
 Saudis reportedly are considering, probably would be required to head off
 further erosion in Saudi sales. We would expect other producers-both within
 and outside of OPEC-to match a cut of this magnitude. Should the Saudis
 adopt this course, we believe that they would try to defend prices at about $30
 a barrel to avert a major price collapse.

 A major Japanese steel producer recently said, however, it had lost confidence
 in the collaboration between Japan and Western Europe. It complained that
 Spot Oil               Spot crude oil prices plunged following the OPEC meeting last weekend when
 Market Trends          members failed to reach agreement on new production quotas. Arab Light fell
 by about $2 per barrel to $29.25, the lowest level in over nine months. North
 Sea and light North African crudes also declined sharply. North Sea Brent
 crude dropped to $29.10 per barrel, more than $4 below its official price.
 While underlying demand for both crude and products remains weak, many
 analysts attribute most of the recent price decline to speculative trading. We
 expect spot prices to weaken further in the coming weeks unless OPEC can
 agree on production quotas.

 evidence concerning this cartel activity refers to non-EC West European or

 New Banking Institute  Representatives of 35 international banks from nine countries have founded
 the Institute of International Finance, which will have its headquarters in
 Washington. The Institute will provide economic information on debtor
 countries to member banks, particularly to assist smaller US and foreign banks

 conditions and plans in debtor countries, consult with international agencies
 and banks, provide information to its members, and give financial advice to

 committee recommendations on senior permanent staff, recruitment of new

 Major international banks that have lent heavily to developing countries are
 concerned that smaller banks are jeopardizing repayment by reducing their
 lending to these countries. The Institute is intended to help persuade the
 smaller banks to maintain their lending levels by giving them more adequate
 financial data. It may have difficulty, however, getting data because banks
 may be reluctant to report the amount loaned to individual countries, and the
 IMF probably will be reluctant to share confidential informatio

 Portugal's Balance-   Portugal's current account deficit widened to $2.6 billion for the first three
 of-Payment Deficit    quarters of 1982, 30 percent above a year earlier. The US Embassy estimates
 Worsens               that the deficit for the full year will total $3.2-3.4 billion, equal to 14 percent
 of GDP. The deterioration during the first three quarters was attributable
 entirely to net tourism receipts and worker remittances, which were both down
 significantly, and to sharply higher interest payments. Official reserves of $8
 billion-most in the form of gold-are adequate to forestall a near-term crisis.
 The problem is severe enough, however, that Lisbon will have little choice but
 to implement an austerity program similar to the one proposed in December by
 now acting Premier Balsemao. The Portuguese probably will also need
 assistance from the IMF, but no progress is likely on that front until the 1983
 budget is passed. At this point, it is far from certain that Balsemao's caretaker
 government will pass even emergency economic legislation before President
 Eanes follows through on his recent pledge to dissolve parliament and schedule
 an early election.

 Foreign Banks         been in force since the 1940s. Entry will be limited by several regulations-in-
 cluding a domestic equity requirement that will limit foreign participation to
 50 percent unless the bank can prove a clear benefit to the Australian
 economy. Canberra expects to approve the entry of about 10 banks in 1983;
 several banks already have expressed an interest in doing business in Australia.
 The opposition Labor and Democratic Parties have made it clear that they
 oppose the plan, and Labor Party leaders are suggesting that a Labor victory
 in the 1983 elections will result in a review of the terms and conditions of
 entry.
 Major French          The nationalized French aluminum company Pechiney and the government of

 million for the construction of a smelting-manufacturing complex near Trois
 Rivieres. The project would be the largest single investment in the province's
 industrial sector and Quebec's first major deal with France. Quebec's commit-
 ment to invest $81 million in the project and Hydro-Quebec's promise to
 provide electrical power at half price for at least the first five years of the facil-
 ities' operations apparently persuaded Pechiney to proceed. The project will
 boost employment in Quebec by 1,200 jobs during the construction phase, and
 800 permanent jobs are expected when production begins; it also will provide
 Hydro-Quebec with a market for a portion of its surplus electricity.

 Iraq Seeking           Deputy Prime Minister Aziz visited Paris this month to request payment
 Financial Relief       deferments from France for arms purchased earlier, according to the US

 Iraq has delayed payments on a wide variety of economic projects already
 under way. Iraq now requires firms bidding on contracts to offer credit as a
 prerequisite for new orders. Most exporters probably will go along with Iraq's
 payment deferrals in the hope that Iraq's economic situation eventually will
 improve and because there is not much they can do to force payment.
 Iraq can do little now to augment its foreign exchange earnings. Because of the
 closure of the pipeline through Syria last April, oil revenues will be even lower
 this year than last. Iraq's foreign exchange reserves have plummeted from

 $21 billion at the beginning of 1982 to about $5 billion-the equivalent of less
 than three months' worth of imports. The Persian Gulf states so far have not
 responded to Iraq's pleas for more financial aid. They will find it more difficult
 to provide Iraq with the $5.5 billion they gave last year because of their own fi-
 nancial situation. A weak world oil market also will prevent them from selling
 much oil for Iraq.

 Outlays For           of greatly reduced oil revenues, significant cuts in outlays for imports of
 Military Imports      military equipment, services, and construction will be difficult. Saudi pay-
 ments for deliveries are scheduled to increase by more than 40 percent in
 FY 1983 and remain high for at least three years. We estimate between
 $22-25 billion will be due over the next three years if estimated payments for
 non-US deliveries are included. The largest payments will be for construction
 of military facilities, an air defense system, combat and transport aircraft, and
 for the AWACS program.
 These programs are unlikely to be canceled or delayed because of Riyadh's
 commitment to the gradual creation of a complete, modern defense establish-
 ment by the early 1990s. New contracts to modernize Saudi weapons are
 expected over the next three years, and significant future savings could be
 effected through selective delays for high cost programs like the M-1 Abrams
 tank or a replacement fighter for the F-5E.

 Despite political costs, Caracas may be forced to impose exchange controls or a
 major devaluation to stop capital flight that drained some $5 billion in reserves
 last year, according to Central Bank estimates. Growing banker anxiety about
 dwindling reserve levels also could increase Venezuela's difficulties in refi-

 Chilean Debt          Chilean officials earlier this week met with foreign creditors to discuss
 Rescheduling Talks    rescheduling on $4.8 billion in medium- and short-term debt due in 1983 and
 to secure some $1 billion in new loans. Chile's debt crisis was precipitated by
 Santiago's decision to liquidate three financial institutions, intervene in the
 operation of five banks, and appoint inspectors for two others, which together
 have a combined foreign debt of $3.5 billion. The interventions-aimed at
 boosting domestic confidence in the country's weak financial system-upset
 foreign bankers and caused them to cut off Chile's access to new credits. In an
 effort to restore confidence, the government has assured foreign creditors that
 it will guarantee the loans of the 10 banks. Moreover, Chile's excellent past
 debt servicing record, its willingness to implement austerity measures, and the
 prospect of a rebound in copper exports probably assure a successful outcome
 to the rescheduling negotiations.

 with the Bishop regime. Moscow established a diplomatic mission on the island

 provide $10.5 million in credits for a satellite receiving station, a feasibility

 Malawi Miffed by       Senior Malawian officials are bitter about a recent decision by the Bank of
 US Bank Pullout        America to withdraw its $12 million equity from Malawi by the end of 1983,
 according to the US Embassy in Lilongwe. They blame Washington for failing
 to dissuade Bank of America and see the move as another indication that
 Malawi ranks low on the list of US priorities in Africa. Despite Lilongwe's un-
 happiness about the bank's decision, the economic impact on Malawi is likely
 to be slight. We believe that Barclays Bank and Standard Bank, British
 institutions that are the principal shareholders of Malawi's only other commer-
 cial bank, will be strongly tempted to take over Bank of America's equity.
 Barclays and Standard already own and operate the largest commercial banks
 in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Kenya.
 Yugoslav Hard         The Yugoslav press reports that banks in Yugoslavia have lifted the $250 limit
 Currency Restriction  on withdrawals from hard currency accounts. The restriction had been
 Lifted                imposed last October in conjunction with other foreign exchange 'controls.
 According to the US Embassy, however, only a few banks thus far have
 carried out the relaxation.
 The federal government probably hopes the removal of the restriction on the
 approximately $7 billion worth of deposits will lead to an increase in
 remittances from Yugoslav workers living in Western Europe. Remittances,
 which are a key source of hard currency, apparently fell off substantially
 following the imposition of the restriction. Yugoslav bankers probably believe
 depositors will have more confidence, now that a $1.3 billion financial package
 with Western governments has been announced.
 Soviet Nongrain Crops Agricultural performance figures for 1982 have been released by the Soviet
 Below Plan            Central Statistical Administration, and for the second consecutive year, data
 on grain production were not included. These figures indicate that with the ex-
 ception of cotton, the 1982 output of the principal nongrain crops-sugar
 beets, potatoes, vegetables, sunflowers-increased over last year. Even so,
 production for all of these crops, except for vegetables and cotton, was well be-
 low plan, and the production of sugar beets and potatoes was below the 1976-
 80 average.

 Weather conditions, poor seed quality, improper handling, and the lack of
 transportation equipment all contributed to this year's shortfall in nongrain
 crops. Soviet admission of disappointing harvests of sugar beets and potatoes,
 which are extensively grown in and on the perimeters of some of the major
 grain-producing areas, also lends credence to our previous estimate that the
 Soviets suffered another poor grain harvest last year.
 Beijing Hikes Prices  In a bold move certain to spark consumer protests, the Chinese Government
 of Cotton Textiles    has ordered a 20-percent increase in retail prices of cotton textiles. The action
 comes after increases in prices paid cotton growers and is intended to cut down
 on massive subsidies that have contributed to a string of deficits in the state
 budget. At the same time, Beijing is cutting by 20 to 30 percent consumer
 prices of synthetic fabrics in order to dislodge inventories and help soak up ex-
 cess purchasing power. The government is attempting to put the best face on a
 politically sensitive issue by arguing that the growth of its synthetic garment
 industry has reached the point where the average Chinese should now be able
 to dress better. Although the price changes may be less unpopular in the cities,
 the rural poor will be hit hard, which the government has acknowledged by au-
 thorizing subsidies for certain areas. Chinese media are billing the price
 changes-which also involve a number of slow-selling consumer durables-as
 a major step in reforming the country's highly irrational price system.
 China has cut back sharply on imports of synthetic fibers over the past year
 because of increased production and stockpiles of synthetics and because of
 record cotton crops. Although Beijing last week restricted future purchases of
 US-origin fibers to protest controls on textile trade, China probably will
 reenter the market-but buy less than in past years-after the domestic supply
 situation stabilizes.
 Abolition of Communes China's rural communes-the centerpiece of China's rural development
 in China              strategy for 25 years-will be abolished and replaced by village cooperatives
 and village governments. The change, which is mandated by China's new state
 constitution, is now being implemented experimentally in 60 localities. The
 new administative system will be similar to that of the 1950s. The communes,
 which combined both governmental and economic functions, were viewed as
 too large and inefficient to. play a useful role under Beijing's increasingly
 market-oriented agrarian policies.
 The abolition of communes is important mainly as a political symbol of
 Beijing's willingness to reject Maoist institutions. The commune system had
 been closely associated with Mao Zedong since its inception in 1958 during the
 Great Leap Forward, and its egalitarian ideological basis is at odds with the

 current leadership's emphasis on rewarding individual productivity. The
 communes' cadres, most of whom will lose their jobs, have frequently been
 accused of blocking reforms and interfering with decisionmaking at lower
 levels to protect their own power.
 In the short run, the new rural institutions are unlikely to have much effect on
 agricultural production. Agricultural responsibility systems-under which
 individuals or groups can exercise greater control over production outside state
 plans-are already in place in most communes. They are given credit for the
 rapid gains in production over the past few years, which have given Beijing
 confidence that the communes are no longer needed. Joint economic and
 trading companies will take over some of the communes' economic functions,
 but individual households and cooperatives will be the basic economic units.

 Mexico: Fast Start but Long Way To Go
 President Miguel de la Madrid has made a fast
 start in addressing Mexico's financial and econom-
 ic crisis, but we expect increasing pressures on him
 to backslide and we see no letup in persisting
 financial problems. For 1983 we project a steep
 drop in economic activity, high inflation, and a
 sharp falloff in consumption compared with the
 previous year. As a result, keeping the cooperation
 of labor and the middle class for austerity will
 become progressively harder. We expect to see
 increasing consumer demonstrations, growing dis-
 sension among factions within the ruling party, and
 perhaps violent antigovernment protests.
 In these circumstances, we think that de la
 Madrid's dedication to economic stabilization will
 wane in favor of maintaining domestic stability. He
 already has eased projected austerity by reversing
 commitments to cut food and public transport
 subsidies and by offering a huge new public works
 program. We believe that concessions to maintain
 what he views as minimum consumption and to
 preserve the ruling party's traditional social and
 economic programs will cause Mexico to miss-
 perhaps by wide margins-some of its quarterly
 IMF stabilization targets. This will cause periodic
 gaps in foreign financing as Mexico seeks to extract
 more lenient conditions from the IMF. These set-
 backs will add to problems in restoring public
 confidence and reversing capital flight, while un-
 dermining business recovery. Economic recovery
 and expansion in consumption are likely to be
 postponed until 1985 at the earliest
 Austerity and a New Beginning
 De la Madrid's quick fleshing out of the emergency
 economic program announced in his 1 December
 inaugural speech and his ending of antibusiness
 rhetoric have reassured the international financial
 community, gained Mexico access to $9 billion in
 new IMF and commercial bank credits, and set the
 stage for a $21 billion public-sector debt reschedul-
 ing. Meanwhile, his seizure of economic initiative
 and establishment of a new "clean" presidential
 image have earned him cautious public approval.
 His strong support for the IMF program-he pub-
 licly stated that the loan was essential to avoid even
 worse austerity-helped end the acrimonious de-
 bate in the Mexican press over loan conditions that
 had persisted since the last months of the Lopez
 Portillo administration.
 Most Mexicans give de la Madrid high marks for
 his vigorous attack on inefficient policies and his
 measures to attack official abuses of power. Legis-
 lation pushed through Congress in December estab-
 lishes a cabinet-level Comptroller General to moni-
 tor government spending procedures and strictly
 limits outside income for officials. It also better
 defines categories of illegal activities-including
 influence peddling, unjust use of power, and illegal
 enrichment-sets punishments, and closes loop-
 holes in existing anticorruption laws. Additionally,
 in an unprecedented move, de la Madrid publicized
 public salaries-including his own.
 To implement the IMF program of tight limits on
 public spending, domestic credit expansion, and
 foreign borrowing and purchases, Mexico City
 slashed the projected 1983 budget. The new budget
 mandates a 20-percent real cut in non-debt-related 25X1
 spending and a 30-percent real increase in revenues
 in order to reduce the public-sector deficit from 17
 percent of GDP in 1982 to 8.5 percent in 1983.
 Government ministries are slated to cut expendi-
 tures an average of 25 percent. Increased revenues

 are projected largely from a boost in the value-
 added tax and gasoline prices while nonfuel subsi-
 dies are projected to grow.
 In a step to lessen market distortions, Mexico City
 removed most price and foreign exchange controls
 and sharply raised interest rates. The Commerce
 Ministry removed price restrictions on 4,700 of the
 5,000 controlled items, leaving controls on basic-
 largely public-sector supplied-commodities. In
 mid-December Mexico City devalued the peso for
 the third time in 1982, boosted the controlled rate
 from 70 to 95 pesos to the US dollar, and reestab-
 lished a free market rate. The controlled rate is
 being adjusted downward 13 centavos a day, with
 an eventual goal of unifying it with the free market
 rate, presently at 148 pesos to the dollar or 82
 percent below the value a year ago. Interest rates-
 although they remain negative in real terms-have
 been raised substantially to reduce the disincentive
 for domestic savings.
 Crucial Labor Support
 De la Madrid's most successful move thus far-in
 our view-has been that of gaining union leaders'
 support for only moderate wage hikes. At the end
 of 1982, the government announced a labor, gov-
 ernment, and management solidarity pact designed
 to keep wages in line, maintain subsidies, and
 control food prices while assuring supplies. As a
 part of this deal, labor accepted an increase in
 minimum wages of 25 percent, with an additional
 12.5 percent promised this summer. We believe
 labor's willingness to accept pay well below project-
 ed rates of inflation reflects de la Madrid's success
 in convincing Mexicans of the need for belt tighten-
 ing. Moreover, we believe the early acceptance of
 the modest wage hike will help persuade interna-
 tional lenders and business leaders that de la
 Madrid is committed to austerity, and that he can
 control major domestic interest groups
 As an indication of the importance that de la
 Madrid attaches to successful worker relations, he
 appointed Arsenio Farrell-described by the US
 Secret
 28 January 1983
 Embassy as a decisive leader and totally familiar
 with labor issues-as Secretary of Labor. In ex-
 change for labor's support of moderate wage hikes,
 de la Madrid made important concessions. Taxes
 on low-cost housing and medicines were reduced
 and plans to raise public transport fares postponed.
 The National Minimum Wage Commission-com-
 posed of government, private-sector, and labor rep-
 resentatives-is now allowed to meet more than
 once a year to discuss raising wage rates.
 Debt Refinancing Exercises
 Against this backdrop, Mexico City is pulling
 together a series of huge financial deals totaling
 more than $30 billion over the next three years.
 These arrangements involve the IMF, more than
 1,400 foreign commercial banks, and numerous
 foreign governments. Successful completion of
 these deals is needed if Mexico is to avoid default
 on a portion of its $82.5 billion foreign debt and
 maintain essential imports. Although the IMF will
 provide only a fraction of the funds, its support is
 needed to gain other financing. In early January,
 Mexico drew its first quarterly installment of $330
 million from the three-year, $4 billion IMF pack-
 age.
 Quantitatively more important is the $7 billion in
 new credits that commercial banks and foreign
 governments are reluctantly committing. We be-
 lieve most of the requested amount will be forth-
 coming by next week. Foreign governments and
 international organizations have committed $2 bil-
 lion for 1983, a sizable increase from their support
 in recent months. Through last week, $4.7 billion of
 the $5 billion requested from commercial banks
 had been subscribed. To assure participation of
 other institutions that had made their subscriptions
 contingent on full syndication of the loan, we
 expect some large banks to make additional
 pledges. Payments from this credit are to be made
 in four equal installments, contingent on and imme-
 diately following the quarterly IMF tranches.

 Secret
 Labor leaders-long an integral part of the govern-
 ing process-are willing to go along with austerity
 measures, mainly because they consider them-
 selves equal partners with the government in run-
 ning the nation. Labor officials-representing the
 ruling party's biggest and best organized sector-
 hold the largest share of national, state, and local
 government offices. Union members traditionally
 have gained numerous benefits from close labor-
 government ties and are relatively immune to
 opposition party blandishments to alter the rela-
 tionship. The major trade union leader, Fidel
 Velazquez, recently told US Embassy officials that
 he recognizes the gravity of the situation and the
 necessity for austerity. He indicated that union
 leaders will attempt to educate their members on
 the seriousness of Mexico's problems.
 In addition to the recent tax and.price concessions,
 wage gains late in the Lopez Portillo administra-
 tion helped union leaders keep the rank and file in
 line. Moreover, the recent emphasis on job preserva-
 tion rather than large wage hikes has served the best
 interest of skilled workers, the bulk of unionized
 labor. Few skilled laborers have lost their jobs,
 despite the 1 million added to the unemployment
 rolls since August.
 Unions not affiliated with the ruling party represent a
 small minority of laborers and have yet to display the
 strength or inclination to force changes in the govern-
 ment's labor policies. High wages, more fringe bene-
 fits, and better working conditions make challenges
 by affiliates of the Independent Federation of Work-
 ers-the nation's largest independent union organiza-
 tion-unlikely despite the country's economic prob-
 lems. Although leftist-dominated unions and labor
 organizations have increased their efforts to expand    25X1
 links with labor since economic problems intensified       I
 last August, their influence is limited to electrical,
 telephone, and teachers' unions.
 Mexico's bank advisory group would like to turn to
 the even more complex debt rescheduling package,
 which needs attention before the moratorium on
 principal payments expires at the end of March. At
 yearend 1982 Mexico's public-sector foreign debt
 totaled $68.5 billion. Mexico has proposed resched-
 uling $21 billion in arrearages and principal obliga-
 tions due on this debt through 1984. We expect
 most of Mexico's creditors to accept public-sector
 debt rescheduling, although they are likely to press
 for higher interest, new collateral, and some longer
 term stabilization agreement that would restrict
 Mexican economic policy initiatives throughout
 most of the seven-year rescheduling period.
 Mexico City has proposed a new scheme for pri-
 vate-sector debt relief, according to US Embassy
 reporting. Since August, private firms have built up
 arrears of $2 billion, nearly equally divided be-
 tween interest and principal payments on the $14
 billion privately held debt. If a foreign creditor is
 willing to reschedule principal payments on a firm's
 debt, the government has announced that foreign
 exchange will be available for purchase by the firm
 to pay its debt. Although details of the scheme are
 not yet worked out, we believe foreign creditors will
 jump at the chance to clear up private-sector
 principal arrears.
 Miguel Mancera, director of the Bank of Mexico,
 stated that this mechanism will not apply to inter-
 est payments. To meet interest obligations, the
 private sector will have to deposit pesos with the
 Bank of Mexico at the controlled exchange rate.
 Mancera said Mexico will pay 10 percent of the
 outstanding balances of these accounts at the end
 of January. Thereafter, the Bank will make month-
 ly payments on private-sector interest as foreign
 exchange becomes available.

 In our assessment, planned financial inflows will
 slow, but not reverse, the steep decline in economic
 activity that began in late 1982. Economic
 performance during early 1983 will be particularly
 weak. Imports are running 50 percent below last
 year, and businessmen report that capacity utiliza-
 tion has dropped to 50 to 70 percent compared with
 90 percent between 1980 and mid-1982. Because of
 these trends, we largely agree with the forecast of
 Data Resources Incorporated (DRI); they project
 that economic activity will fall at a 6-percent rate
 for first-quarter 1983 and that inflation will rise to
 a 100-percent annualized rate during the time
 period
 Shortages of foreign exchange and domestic credit
 will intensify the private-sector slowdown at least
 until debt arrears are reduced. Business leaders
 claim that few dollars are available outside the free
 market because of the critical foreign exchange
 needs of the government. They indicate that even
 firms earning foreign exchange from exports are
 having trouble maintaining production levels.
 Moreover, drastically reduced inventories of spare
 parts and raw materials are reported by business
 leaders. Industrialists interviewed by US officials
 in Guadalajara say that productivity is falling and
 that they are relying on the free foreign exchange
 market for necessary imports despite government
 guarantees of subsidized exchange for those pur-
 chases. As a result, they are cannibalizing ma-
 chines for parts to maintain production
 Inflation in January-March 1983 will almost surely
 stay at triple digits. Floating the peso and removing
 price controls- boosted the cost of living by 10.7
 percent in December alone, a 240-percent annua-
 lized rate. The soaring peso cost of imports will
 continue to be a large component of price increases,
 while the boost in the value-added tax will give
 another fillip to inflation. Decontrol of prices on
 many consumer goods and the government's 15-
 percent hike in prices of controlled items in mid-
 January will add more fuel to inflationary fires.
 Secret
 28 January 1983
 Austerity Challenged
 Accumulating Social Pressures. Continuing eco-
 nomic deterioration could generate a prolonged
 crisis that would put Mexican institutions under
 stress unprecedented in several generations. Pres-
 sures on de la Madrid to weaken the program will
 mount as the austerity program intensifies econom-
 ic problems of important interest groups:
 ? Further reductions in food and transport subsi-
 dies will especially hurt the lower classes.
 ? Additional devaluations-which policymakers in-
 dicate will be an important instrument to force a
 more export-oriented economy-will undercut
 middle class consumption as imports become even
 more expensive.
 ? Job losses will increase as the government cuts
 public spending and falling sales force business to
 cut production.
 Union leaders may push for new concessions if they
 believe government policies or private-sector un-
 willingness to limit price increases are putting a
 disproportionate share of the burden on labor.
 Victories by dissidents in local union elections
 would send a clear message to national leaders that
 policy changes were in order. Strikes by unions
 affiliated with the ruling party would be an indica-
 tor that the difficulties plaguing the system were
 too complex to handle in traditional, behind-the-
 scenes negotiations. Disorganization within labor's
 hierarchy would also complicate continued union-
 government cooperation. Fidel Velazquez remains
 in undisputed control of Mexican labor, but at age
 82 his health is uncertain. His death could bring
 union disarray because potential successors lack his
 influence.
 External economic factors could also throw de la
 Madrid's efforts off course. Despite the devalua-
 tions that have undervalued the peso for trade

 slightly because of weak world commodity demand
 and continuing economic policy uncertainties. To
 boost nonoil exports more would require major
 long-term investment to reorganize Mexican-
 indus-try, which for years has concentrated on the local
 market because of domestic incentives and an
 overvalued peso. On the other hand, tourism and
 border trade should be a small plus, adding up to
 $1.5 billion to service receipts.
 The greatest shortfall from Mexican projections
 will reflect lower oil revenues, which represent 70
 percent of all merchandise exports. While we assess
 that Mexico could boost oil production and export
 capacity by 200,000 b/d on average this year as
 Pemex had earlier planned, the US Embassy re-
 ports that Pemex has scaled back its production
 and sales targets because of budget constraints, the
 weak world oil market, and concern over alienating
 OPEC. Largely for budget reasons, Pemex explo-
 ration and development spending was slashed        25X1

 1982. This forecast assumes constant nominal oil
 prices and a slight increase to 1.5 million b/d in
 export sales. For each $1 change in world oil prices,
 Pemex receipts change $550 million annually.
 Missing IMF Targets
 We believe the odds of de la Madrid's further
 backsliding on austerity are better than even and
 that, as a result, Mexico will fail to meet some IMF
 targets this year. The requirement to lower the
 public-sector budget deficit from 17 percent to
 8.5 percent of GDP is probably the most unlikely
 target to be met. Even so, noncompliance with this
 Secret
 28 January 1983
 goal could remain hidden by the slow process of
 budget reporting at least until the end of the year.
 We think that strong government ministries will
 not accept slashed budgets without a fight. Firing
 the hundreds of thousands of public employees it
 would take to meet the goal is unrealistic both
 because of Mexican job security laws and because
 we believe key government ministries such as In-
 terior (cut 50 percent), Defense (cut 30 percent),
 and Health and Education (cut 25 percent) will
 resist]
 At the same time, we project government income
 will fall short of budgeted revenue levels because of
 a deteriorating tax base and a weakening of the
 receipts of government enterprises. Price controls
 on basic goods will keep revenues substantially
 below inflation in many government-owned busi-
 nesses. Moreover, we expect tax remittances by

 Pemex to the central government to be at least
 $1 billion below the $11 billion the budget projects.
 We calculate that receipts from the higher value-
 added tax probably will fall 20 percent below
 projected revenues because of a falloff in economic
 activity.
 Other targets likely to be missed-and much easier
 to detect-are net credit to the public sector by the
 Bank of Mexico and the change in net domestic
 assets of the Bank of Mexico. Recent monetary
 policy has been designed to meet the financing
 needs of the public sector. Between September and
 December, net credit to the public sector increased
 by 31 percent and net domestic assets soared by
 almost 100 percent. The IMF program, however,
 limits the increase in both to just 34 percent for all
 1983. A 9-percent increase in net domestic credit to
 the public sector in the first quarter seems particu-
 larly difficult in light of triple-digit inflation. With
 a large part of its new foreign credits already
 committed to interest obligations, Mexico City will
 have to depend on domestic credit to finance
 continuing subsidies and its new public works
 program. Moreover, we expect Mexico City to be
 faced with unanticipated wage hikes and financing
 requirements for business transactions that will
 boost public and private domestic credit because its
 goal of cutting inflation to 50 percent in 1983 is
 unrealistic.
 In our assessment, Mexico City could meet the
 other three of its six quantitative IMF targets. The
 probable successes, in our view, will be the reduc-
 tion of foreign borrowing, the $2 billion increase in
 net foreign reserves, and the reduction of debt
 arrears by $600 million. On the other hand, if
 devaluation begins to substantially lag inflation and
 other economic shocks drive a skittish public into
 another round of capital flight, even these targets
 could be missed.
 Implications of Backsliding
 Even though we foresee economic deterioration and
 backsliding, we believe that the international
 financial community will allow a fair amount of
 flexibility if they perceive the thrust of de la
 Madrid's economic policies as positive. Then the
 IMF and world bankers will allow Mexico to
 readjust austerity criteria based on the administra-
 tion's six-year economic plan now scheduled to be
 released by de la Madrid in May.
 In this case, we see only temporary delays in
 financial disbursements, with a gradual increase in
 the foreign exchange availability by the end of
 1983. Even so, the bulk of the improvement will be
 swallowed up by the need to stay current on
 government interest obligations, reduce private-
 sector debt arrears, and rebuild inventories. Thus
 the volume of imports in 1983 will be lower than in
 1982
 Under these circumstances, we project that 1983
 economic performance will be substantially worse
 than in 1982. Construction, manufacturing, and
 commerce will be the hardest hit by import short-
 ages. Domestic budget cuts will, in a similar fash-
 ion, slice government and other service activities.
 Even the mineral sector-which paced by oil devel-
 opment has been the engine of dynamic Mexican
 economic growth for the past eight years-will not
 avoid the slump. For 1983, at best, we assess that
 GDP will fall 3 to 5 percent and that inflation will
 run between 70 and 90 percent.
 25X1
 25X1
 If Mexico misses its IMF targets by wide margins
 and international bankers perceive that de la Ma-
 drid's policies are off base, we believe that the risks
 of losing international financing are significant. In
 this case, Mexico could lose IMF support and
 additional commercial bank credit; imports would
 then plummet, private-sector debt arrears would
 expand, and many Mexicans, particularly intellec-
 tuals and leftwing politicians, would call for an
 interest moratorium. To remain current on interest, 25X1
 Mexico would be forced to cut imports by as much
 as one-third in 1983. In this situation, the economic
 activity would fall by 10 percent and inflation
 would stay at triple digits.                    25X1

 Saudi Oil Capacity:
 Impact of the Weak Market'
 Saudi Arabia has decided to reduce oil production
 capacity from 10 million b/d to 8.5 million b/d
 over the next several months. They plan to moth-
 ball 1.5 million b/d of capacity, which, according
 to Saudi directives, should be capable of being
 returned to operation within 90 days. Recent bud-
 get reductions, however, may adversely affect up-
 keep and maintenance of the mothballed equipment
 and lead to further postponements of new capacity
 development projects.
 Anticipated reductions in Saudi capacity should
 Saudi output of 8.5 million b/d will not be required
 before the end of the decade. The reductions,
 however, will substantially reduce the world's cush-
 ion of spare productive capacity to offset supply
 disruptions in the short term.
 Saudi Oil Capacity Policy
 With proved and probable reserves estimated by
 Aramco at 178 billion barrels, Saudi oil capacity is
 dictated by policy considerations rather than re-
 source availability. The Saudis maintain some
 spare productive capacity to use as leverage in
 OPEC pricing decisions and to protect Saudi politi-
 cal, economic, and security interests in response to
 supply disruptions. In 1976 the Saudis, at US
 urging, reluctantly agreed to raise sustainable ca-
 pacity to 12 million b/d. For several years Saudi oil
 officials cited the 12-million-b/d figure as existing
 capacity, although actual sustainable capacity was
 only about 10 million b/d. We believe that the
 Saudis made this claim to enhance their leverage
 over OPEC oil prices during a period of peak
 OPEC production and substantial u ward price
 pressures.
 Now, however, with the current weak oil market,
 many Saudis feel that existing underutilized capac-
 ity-4.5 million b/d or more in recent months-is
 too expensive to maintain merely as an emergency
 cushion to protect the industrial nations. Moreover,
 the foreign manpower requirements to build and
 maintain capacity exceed what many Saudis con-
 sider prudent to avoid social and cultural disrup-
 tions
 In November 1982 the Saudis instructed Aramco
 to adopt an 8.5-million-b/d-capacity level as a cost-
 saving measure. This 1.5-million reduction in ca-
 pacity will be achieved by shutting in several
 marginal oilfields and mothballing the associated
 processing facilities. In some cases, facilities shut
 down are to be available to be returned to service
 within 90 days. Regular maintenance and periodic
 testing will be required to prevent deterioration of
 these facilities. Given likely spending cuts, we
 believe that proper maintenance will not be carried
 out, leading to a loss of part or all of mothballed
 capacity

 Aramco plans call for the maintenance of
 8.5-million-b/d operating capacity during the next
 five years. The plan, however, is currently under
 revision, and we believe that cuts in productive

 Aramco capital spending targets-which must be
 self-financed under Saudi regulations-have been
 sharply reduced in recent months. As of November
 1982, total Aramco capital spending for the
 1983-87 period was already down about 40 percent
 from the amount targeted in mid-1981. Since then,
 the government has directed Aramco to recalculate
 the budget based on lower production projections.
 Thus far, most cuts have come in heavy crude
 development. We expect this trend to continue
 because the Saudis can meet capacity targets less
 expensively by emphasizing maintenance of light
 crude capacity.
 A major victim of the Saudi budget cuts is Ri-
 yadh's long-term goal of matching the composition
 of production by crude type with the composition of
 reserves. The existing physical crude production
 system remains heavily geared toward producing
 Arab Light. To balance production among the
 crudes, it would be necessary to either reduce light
 crude production or to develop medium and heavy
 crudes. While recent planning emphasizes develop-
 ment of medium and heavy crudes, these projects
 have been delayed because of the greater market-
 ability of lighter crudes and Sandi need for the gas
 associated with the Arab Light production. Recent
 production figures indicate that Arab Light again
 comprises over 70 percent of total production.       25X1

 The Saudi Government's goal of balancing produc-
 tion of the light, medium, and heavy crudes in
 accordance with their reserves could conflict with
 domestic requirements for associated natural gas.
 Most of the existing gas-collection facilities are
 designed to gather gas produced at onshore Arab
 Light crude fields. These oilfields have a higher
 gas-oil ratio than the medium and heavy crude
 fields, and the volume of gas collected per barrel of
 oil produced is considerably higher if Arab Light
 crude output is emphasized. The Saudis now want
 to develop gas facilities at medium and heavy crude
 fields and nonassociated gas deposits. Over the
 longer run, the Saudis are planning to advance
 development of the Khuff gas formation and possi-
 bly the Abqaiq and Aindar gas caps to eliminate
 gas requirements as a constraint on oil production.
 Aramco's financial limitations might force further
 delays in expansion of Saudi oilfields. The Khurais,
 Manifa, and Qatif oilfields, for example, would
 require expensive pressure maintenance systems to
 boost capacity. Expansion at the Marjan oilfield
 also may be delayed; the impetus to increase
 capacity here has been Saudi concern that Iranian
 production in the extension of this offshore field in
 Iranian waters would deplete its reserves. Iran,
 however, has not produced from the field in two
 years. Postponement of these projects alone would
 reduce projected Aramco capacity in 1987 by more
 than 500,000 b/d in the absence of other less
 expensive development programs.

 USSR: The Astrakhan' Natural Gas Project
 Having secured Western assistance in developing
 the Siberia-to-Western Europe gas pipeline, Mos-
 cow is again turning to the West for equipment to
 develop its natural gas reserves at Astrakhan'.
 Astrakhan' gas, however, will be used primarily for
 domestic purposes rather than export. A revitalized
 Soviet interest in developing the Astrakhan' deposit
 reflects the USSR's need to restore gas supply to
 the Caucasus region following the cutoff of Iranian
 gas in 1979, to increase chemical fertilizer produc-
 tion, and to activate backup capacity for the Soyuz
 export pipeline.
 Negotiations with potential Western suppliers for
 $1.5 billion worth of pipe and equipment needed to
 develop the gasfields have accelerated since the
 summer of 1982; the Soviets-perhaps optimisti-
 cally-hope to conclude most if not all of the
 contracts early this year. The Western countries
 involved in the bidding are considering ways of
 accommodating Soviet demands for highly conces-
 sionary interest rates.
 Dimensions of the Project
 Soviet geologists estimate that the Astrakhan' gas-
 field may contain up to 6 trillion cubic meters of
 gas, making it nearly as large as the one at
 Urengoy. When brought on stream, the project
 could eventually produce 30-60 billion cubic meters
 of gas, nearly 3 million tons of sulfur, and 1.8
 million tons of stable condensate annually. The
 sulfur and condensate will be used as feedstock for
 chemical plants. The Soviets were forced to halt '
 deep exploratory drilling at Astrakhan' in the late
 1970s because they lacked sulfur-resistant tubing,
 casing, and drill pipe.
 Development of the Astrakhan' gas reservoirs will
 be extremely difficult and time consuming. Over
 one-third of the gas consists of noxious, noncom-
 bustible contaminants-about 25 percent hydrogen
 sulfide and 12 percent carbon dioxide-which are
 highly corrosive and hazardous. Moreover, the gas
 reservoirs are located at depths of more than 4,100
 meters-twice as deep as those at Urengoy-with
 extremely high reservoir pressures of 630 atmos-
 pheres (9,300 psi) and temperatures of up to 150
 degrees Celsius.
 The Need for Western Technology                25X1
 The Soviets will require substantial Western equip-
 ment and technology to ultimately drill and equip
 some 2,000 wells, construct gathering systems, and
 build gas-processing and sulfur recovery plants to
 develop the Astrakhan' deposits. We expect the
 hard currency cost to be about $1.5 billion, of
 which as much as $650 million may be needed for
 special corrosion-resistant seamless tubular steel
 and large-diameter pipe. About $100 million is to   25X1
 be spent on well equipment, $250-300 million on
 the gathering system, and perhaps $550-650 mil-
 lion on the gas and sulfur processing plants. An
 additional $350-450 million could be spent on
 pipeline construction. Maintenance of the gas com-
 plex will be tied to the procurement of Western
 equipment and technology.

 and continued sporadically over the next four years.

 proceed with development of Astrakhan'.' The tem-
 po of the talks, however, did not pick up much until
 the summer of 1982, when Moscow stationed a
 negotiating team in Cologne.
 At least 15 major Western firms reportedly are
 vying for Astrakhan' contracts. A French consor-
 tium led by Technip signed a $400 million contract
 for the gas plant and related pipe and tubes on 21
 In their negotiations with the West European and
 Japanese firms, the Soviets have stipulated that
 equipment is to be purchased from the United
 States only if it is unavailable elsewhere. Some US
 equipment and special corrosion resistant seamless
 tubular steel are likely to be needed.
 Financing the Project
 The Soviets are pressing hard to obtain concession-
 ary Western loans. They would probably balk at
 interest rates over the 7.8 percent obtained on
 Western government-backed credits for equipment
 for the new Siberia-to-Western Euro a natural gas
 pipeline.
 The Western governments are complaining that
 they are being whipsawed between a desire for their
 firms to win contracts and the wish to at least
 appear not to be straying too far from the OECD
 interest rate consensus. In July 1982 the OECD
 countries agreed to fix minimum interest rates to
 be charged on official lending to the USSR at
 12.4 percent for high interest rate countries and at
 0.3 percentage point above the long-term domestic
 market rate for low-interest-rate countries.

 In an attempt to get around the new OECD
 consensus guidelines, the Western countries have
 been considering "grandfathering" offered rates to
 earlier periods and-in some cases-raising equip-
 ment prices to compensate for reduced interest
 rates. Although there apparently is as yet no
 agreement on credits for the French contract, the
 press reported that earlier in December French
 banks offered financing at 7.8 percent.
 Canada (a high-interest-rate country) was
 considering offering a stated loan rate below the
 consensus by "grandfathering" the rate to 1977,
 when negotiations on Astrakhan' began. Japan (a
 low-interest-country) could come close to the Soviet
 interest rate requirement by offering 8.7 percent
 and still be within the OECD consensus. The
 Japanese long-term prime rate was 8.4 percent
 when. ne otiations got under way in earnest last
 summer.
 We have little information on the repayment terms
 for the Astrakhan' credits, but Moscow probably
 will attempt to procure terms of eight years or more
 with an initial grace period. The OECD consensus
 agreed to in July stipulated that no East European
 country would be eligible. for credits of more than
 eight and a half years. Financing of machinery and
 equipment for the Siberia-to-Western Europe
 pipeline included credits with repayment periods
 over eight years after an initial three-year grace
 period on repayment of principal. In the case of
 financing for pipe, it is likely that the Western
 lenders will insist on annual negotiations and will
 not offer repayment periods of more than five
 years.
 The Astrakhan' project is important to the USSR
 as a source of additional gas and sulfur and natural
 gas liquids needed for expanding production of

 fertilizers and petrochemicals. Kremlin leaders
 want to use Astrakhan' natural gas to compensate
 for depleted gas-producing capacity at the vast
 Orenburg field and to replenish nearly exhausted
 supplies in the Transcaucasus and North Caucasus.
 Iranian gas was being imported at the rate of 10
 billion cubic meters a year when shipments were
 halted in 1979. Natural gas from Astrakhan' could
 flow at a rate of 3 billion cubic meters a year by
 1985 and perhaps 30 billion to 60 billion cubic
 meters a year by 1990. Present Soviet output of
 natural gas is about 495 billion cubic meters a year.
 Although intended primarily to fill domestic gas
 requirements, the Astrakhan' fields will help main-
 tain Soviet gas exports to both Eastern and West-
 ern Europe via the Orenburg pipeline by making up
 for any production decline elsewhere. At present,
 the Orenburg line carries some 16 billion cubic
 meters a year to Eastern Europe, and it could carry
 another 13 billion cubic meters to Western Europe.
 In 1981, hard currency receipts from sales of gas
 totaled $4 billion, or about 15 percent of total
 Soviet commodity export earnings.
 When the new Siberia-to-Western Europe pipeline
 is completed, the Astrakhan' project will give the
 Soviets even greater flexibility to maintain or-as
 has been hinted-to increase gas exports to Eastern
 and Western Europe. An offer of stepped-up gas
 deliveries would help offset the impact of cutbacks
 in oil shipments to Czechoslovakia, East Germany,
 and Hungary.
 The Astrakhan' project includes ambitious plans
 for sulfur production of about 3 million tons a year,
 larger than any sulfur complex in the world. Al-
 though the USSR, with an output in excess of 11
 million tons, is second only to the United States in
 production, sulfur is in tight supply in the USSR.
 Because there are few large reserves of sulfur
 suitable for mining, the Soviets are turning increas-
 ingly to recovery of byproduct sulfur from sour gas,
 oil, metal smelters, and possibly coal. Moreover,

 Poland-which in 1980 provided about 7 percent of
 Soviet sulfur consumption-cannot be counted on
 for large increases in deliveries. Thus, the USSR
 has had to turn to Western countries to help meet
 its domestic needs.
 Finally, the project is expected to make available
 1.8 million tons of stable condensate for feedstocks
 at petrochemical plants. In addition, the carbon
 dioxide recovered from the gas will be transported
 via a 630-kilometer pipeline for injection into the
 Gur'yev oilfields to enhance oil recovery
