 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 KHRUSHCHEV LAP THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY MEETING .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 1
 Khrushchev devoted the final phase of his UN activi-
 ties to an effort to restore disarmament and renewed East-
 West negotiations to the forefront of public attention.                      He
 called for a special UN session on disarmament next spring
 with heads of government in attendance and claimed that
 Prime Minister Macmillan had assured him of a new summit
 meeting on Berlin.   The postponement of Khrushchev's visit
 to North Korea and his own admission that he stayed in New
 York longer than he expected provide additional evidence
 that one of his purposes in attending the General Assembly
 session was to strengthen his hand in dealing with the
 Chinese Communists.   In view of the erosion of support
 for Nationalist China, many of the supporters of a mora-
 torium believe this procedure would be doomed if presented
 in any future session.

 The power struggle in Leopoldville remains stale-
 mated, but army chief Mobutu is determined to arrest
 Lumumba.   The situation is described as extremely tense,
 and use of force by Mobutu would bring him into conflict
 with the UN Command in Leopoldville.   Meanwhile, Lumumba
 continues to enjoy the support of Ghana, Guinea, and the
 UAR.   The situation in Katanga Province is becoming more
 serious as the tribal fighting against President Tshombd
 spreads throughout the central and northern regions of the
 province.
 SITUATION IN LAOS   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    .  .  .  .  .       .  .  .  .   Page 6
 The peace talks between the Souvanna Phouma govern-
 ment and the Communist Pathet Lao which began in Vientiane
 on 11 October have been limited to a review of the "general
 situation" and the establishment of ground rules for future
 sessions.  The Pathet Lao has taken two government outposts
 in Phong Saly Province and is reportedly operating through-
 out the southeastern part of the province in augmented
 strength.  A four-man Soviet delegation is expected momen-
 tarily in Vientiane, presumably to complete the establish-
 ment of diplomatic relations between the USSR and Laos,
 and is likely to offer Souvanna economic assistance.

 state.
 Argentine President Frondizi faces one of the most
 severe crises in his two and one half years in office as
 a result of the 11 October army demands to dismiss some
 of his advisers and modify some of his policies. These
 demands are widely varied, but center on the removal of
 advisers who favor an attempt to attract Peronista politi-
 cal support and moves to strengthen the national petroleum
 company.   The crisis was eased somewhat following Frondizi's
 12 October radio appeal for constitutional procedures, but
 new difficulties may result from negotiations with the
 powerful army commander in chief, Toranzo Montero, whom
 Frondizi dismissed but was apparently compelled to rein-
 BRAZILIAN POLITICAL OUTLOOK  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .       .  .  .  .  .   Page  2
 Janio Quadros' victory in Brazil's 3 October presi-
 dential election will bring about the first basic shake-
 up in Brazil's administrative machinery since Vargas came
 to power in 1930.   The new regime, sponsored by the
 traditional "out" parties, will probably lay heavy stress
 on its declared intention to "clean house" when it takes
 office on 31 January, but it is likely to retain most of
 the basic programs of the popular Kubitschek regime.
 Under Quadros, a temperamental and controversial personality,
 the government is likely to be even more aggressive than in
 the past in bargaining for US economic aid and may also
 seek broader ties with the Sino-Soviet bloc.

 Cuba is symptomatic of opposition to Castro, it does not

 approaches of Moscow and Peiping to "peaceful coexist-
 ence."  Moscow sees modern war as unacceptably destruc-
 tive and therefore urges strategies which do not press
 the West to the point of armed retaliation.  Peiping
 feels that the balance of military power has shifted
 so decisively in favor of the bloc that the Communists
 now can pursue more militant strategies than were
 feasible before the Soviet ICBM successes of 1957.
 SOVIET MILITARY MANPOWER REDUCTION PROGRAM . .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  6
 Although some progress has been made in Khrushchev's
 .program to reduce Soviet armed forces by 1,200,000 by
 1961, the number of demobilized personnel thus far seems
 to be below what might have been expected.   Problems of
 resettling dischargees and morale among:remaining service
 personnel, particularly officers, may have contributed to
 this apparent slowdown.
 RACISM RISING AMONG AFRICANS IN SOUTH AFRICA .  .  .  .    .  .   Page  7
 Although all African nationalist organizations in
 South Africa were dealt crippling blows by the Verwoerd
 government's repressive actions earlier this year, the
 moderate leaders of the African National Congress, which
 advocated equal rights for all races, apparently have
 suffered the greatest loss in prestige.   The effective-
 ness of the Pan-Africanist Congress' demand for an
 "Africa for the Africans,"  with its appeal to racism,
 indicates that African nationalists may espouse racism
 to an increasing extent in the future.   At the same
 time, this may lead to a weakening of the influence
 among Africans of the largely non-African local Commu-
 nist party.
 FRENCH COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENTS   .  .
 Page  8
 The four French Community states associated in the
 Conseil de l'Entente--Ivory Coast, Upper Volta, Niger,
 and Dahomey--appear increasingly determined to assert
 the independence they gained last August.  While ready
 to negotiate bilateral cooperation accords with Paris,
 the four states are unwilling to accept French direction
 of their coordinated foreign policies--especially on the
 Algerian issue--as the price for continued French economic
 aid.   Moreover, they all regard the diversification of
 sources of foreign aid as politically.necessary, and three
 of the states, which presently lack non-French resident
 diplomatic representatives, are extremely anxious to ac-

 PART II (continued)
 PAKISTAN EXTENDS CONTROL OVER NORTHWEST FRONTIER BORDER
 AREAS   .  .  .. . .  .  .  . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .    .  .  .    .  .  .  .  .   Page  10
 The Pakistani Government apparently is exploiting its
 border trouble with Afghanistan to increase its presence
 in tribal areas on the Pakistani side of the frontier
 which traditionally have been autonomous. The govern-
 ment's action in deposing two tribal rulers will enable
 it to install more amenable leaders and to deploy security
 forces directly on the frontier.   Some fighting apparently
 is continuing in various border zones, although on a
 smaller scale than previously.   Elements of Pakistan's
 quasi=military security forces have been involved, but
 none of the regular army units being moved to the vicinity
 have been committed.
 JAPANESE POLITICAL SITUATION .
 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  11
 The Japanese Diet will convene on 17 October for an
 extraordinary session in expectation of lower house elec-
 tions tentatively scheduled for 20 November.   Prime Minister
 Ikeda plans for the session to deal with only perfunctory
 legislative business and quickly to announce dissolution
 of the Diet and a definite date for the elections.   In
 planning no significant legislation for this final session,
 Ikeda presumably hopes the wave of early public enthusiasm
 for his cabinet will carry over to election time.   The
 Socialists, however, will seek to prolong the session by
 exploiting popular emotional response to the assassination
 of Socialist party chairman Asanuma and by attacking
 the government on the rising price level and policy
 toward Communist China.
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  12
 The UAR and Jordan are continuing their free-swinging
 propaganda battle, with Cairo accusing King Husayn's uncle
 of murdering a Syrian MIG-17 pilot who crash-landed in
 Jordanian territory.   Syrian troops have so far not at-
 tempted to interfere with Israeli dredging work begun on
 10 October south of the Banat Yaqub bridge in the Israeli-
 Syrian demilitarized zone.   In Libya, the House of Deputies
 has sharply increased its pressure for replacement of the
 Kubar government.   The situation in Oman is relatively
 quiet, but Omani rebel leaders in Saudi Arabia are.con-
 tinuing their efforts to train and equip an  "Omani expedi-
 tionary force" for an eventual move to "liberate" the
 country from the rule of the British-backed Sultan of
 Muscat and Oman.

 support by aligning themselves publicly with prominent
 individuals who are worried by De Gaulle's policies on
 NATO and supranational European institutions.   Some of
 these rightists are linked with plots to overthrow the
 regime or efforts to reverse De Gaulle's policy of self-
 determination for Algeria.   Meanwhile, De Gaulle is
 beginning to show concern that his middle-of-the-road
 policy may be imperiled by the increasing polarization
 of French opinion between proponents of a French Algeria
 and of an independent Algeria.
 TENSIONS OVER BERLIN .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  15
 Bonn's cancellation on 30 September of its 1961 inter-
 zonal trade agreement with East Germany has aroused serious
 misgivings among West German government and party leaders.
 Many view it as an ineffective countermeasure to the re-
 cent East German traffic restrictions in Berlin, and
 some fear that it will ultimately enhance the prestige
 of the East German regime by necessitating new trade
 negotiations on a government-to-government basis.
 There is also concern in Bonn over the-evident unwill-
 ingness of other Western European nations to join in
 an economic embargo against East Germany.   East Germany,
 which has shown some concern over the projected embargo,
 is trying to exploit these West German misgivings.
 BRITISH LABOR PARTY OUTLOOK  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  17
 Despite Hugh Gaitskell's recent defeat on pro-NATO
 defense policies at the Labor party conference, he seems
 assured of enough support from the Labor members of
 Parliament, who are predominantly moderates, to retain
 the party leadership for at least the coming year.   The
 conference intensified the party rift over policy and
 leadership, and the left wing will probably continue its
 agitation for unilateral nuclear disarmament by Britain.
 Labor's effectiveness as a parliamentary opposition will
 further decline.
 FINNISH LABOR SCHISM    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  18
 The expected formation later this fall of.a new na-
 tional labor federation controlled by regular Social
 Democrats will complete the breach within Finnish organ-
 ized labor.   Creation of a rival organization will in
 effect abandon the present federation to the dissident
 Social Democrats and the Communists and involve Finnish
 labor in a tug-of-war between the two politically oriented
 groups.   Prospects for the new federation are uncertain
 in view of the relatively small membership it will begin
 with and the tendency of employers to favor dealing with
 the larger existing group.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PART III
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 CHINESE COMMUNIST INTEREST IN AFRICA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 1
 Communist China, which has pledged support for all
 national independence movements, has directed particular
 attention toward Africa in this year of emerging African
 states.   It has sought to enhance its prestige through
 propaganda, trade, economic assistance, and cultural
 ties.   Having gained diplomatic recognition by five
 African states, Peiping has laid the groundwork for
 increasing its influence throughout the area.
 JAPANESE ACTIVITIES IN THE RYUKYU.  ISLANDS  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 6
 The Japanese Government is moving quickly to carry
 out limited economic and technical assistance programs
 for the Ryukyus within a framework recently authorized
 by the US High Commissioner.   Tokyo's stated immediate
 objective is to allay sentiment in Japan for reversion
 of the islands to Japanese control.  There are some
 indications, however, that Tokyo is moving ahead of,
 rather than merely satisfying, popular Japanese desires
 for participation in Ryukyuan affairs, and that Tokyo
 is eager to broaden the basis for eventual assertion
 of its rights there.
 THE PERUVIAN-ECUADOREAN BOUNDARY DISPUTE .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 10
 The new Ecuadorean Government's informal denunciation
 of the Rio Protocol of 1942, which provided for the settle-
 ment of the Peruvian-Ecuadorean boundary dispute, has re-
 vived the animosity between the two countries that led to
 an undeclared war in 1941.   Although both Peru and Ecuador
 insist they will not resort to armed force except in self-
 defense, the.dispute could provoke a series of frontier
 clashes.   Latin American Communists, who are waging a
 continuing campaign to undermine the Organization of
 American States, will probably attempt to exploit the
 boundary dispute to create an atmosphere of violence
 around the 11th inter-American conference, now set for
 Quito in March 1961.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 Khrushchev devoted the final
 phase of his UN activities to an
 effort to restore disarmament
 and renewed East-West negotia-
 tions to the forefront of public
 attention. On 11 October he wrote
 off the value of this UN session
 in dealing with disarmament and
 sought to blame the US elections
 for preventing the United States
 from taking "an active part in
 the discussion."  Anticipating
 defeat of his proposal that dis-
 armament should be discussed by
 the General Assembly itself
 rather than be referred to the
 Political Committee, Khrushchev
 called for a special session
 of the assembly next March or
 April in Europe to be attended
 by the heads of government and
 to deal only with disarmament.
 In a second address on the
 same day, Khrushchev adopted an
 aggressive pose and warned that
 failure to reach agreement would
 lead to war.   While disclaiming
 that he was serving an ultima-
 tum to the assembly, Khrushchev
 reserved the right to withdraw
 from disarmament discussions
 in the UN Political Committee
 and urged the creation of a new
 15-nation committee as Moscow
 has proposed.  He indicated
 willingness to change his plan
 to return to Moscow on 13 Octo-
 ber and remain in New York as
 long as necessary toxeach a
 disarmament agreement..
 Following Khrushchev's de-
 mand for a condemnation of the
 U-2 and RB-47 flights as the
 conditions for a meeting with
 President Eisenhower, the Soviet
 bloc abstained throughout the
 General Assembly voting on the
 formal resolutions for a meeting
 sponsored by the neutralists
 and on the Western amendments.
 Khrushchev then told UN press
 correspondents on 7 October that
 Prime Minister Macmillan had
 assured him a summit meeting.
 would take place after the US
 elections.   In return, Khrushchev
 publicly reaffirmed the position
 he took after the abortive Paris
 summit meeting--that the status
 quo would be maintained in Ber-
 lin.
 In a further move to justi-
 fy his refusal to agree to a
 meeting with the President,
 Khrushchev alleged on a tele-
 vision program on 9 October that
 the US had planned a U-2 flight
 on the eve of his departure for
 the UN meeting, and claimed that
 only a strong warning 'had de-
 terred the United States.
 The Soviet premier also
 used his press conference with
 UN correspondents and his tele-
 vision interview to intensify
 his warnings of possible Soviet
 noncompliance with UN actions.
 He declared that even if 99 per-
 cent of the UN supported the
 secretary general, the USSR would
 not accept the decision and
 would "rely on its own strength"
 to uphold its position.   He also
 confidently predicted that in
 such a situation the UN. would
 "wither and die."
 The political objective of
 Khrushchev's personal antics at
 the assembly, climaxed by a dis-
 ruptive display during the 12
 October debate on colonialism,
 was to demonstrate that without
 Soviet cooperation the UN's work

 beginning of the end...it shows
 how shaky the UN is."

 everything that goes on.   We
 have sown good seeds here...."
 Sino-Soviet Relations
 The postponement of Khru,-'
 shchev's visit to North Korea,
 originally scheduled for early
 October, and his admission that
 he stayed in New York longer
 than expected strongly suggest
 that his performance has been
 calculated to strengthen his
 hand in dealing with the Chinese
 Communists.  The apparent fail-
 ure of a reported meeting be-
 tween top Soviet and Chinese
 negotiators either to reach an
 accommodation of views or ar-
 range for a further meeting with
 Khrushchev during his Korean
 trip probably increased his in-
 centive to prolong the UN ven-
 ture and obtain some results
 he could use to "prove" the
 success and correctness of his
 policies.
 Soviet propaganda has
 stressed the close identity be-
 tween Soviet proposals and the
 attitudes and desires of neutral
 states.    At the same time,  Soviet
 commentaries have attempted to
 portray the West as increasing-
 ly isolated.  According to Mos-
 cow, the General Assembly vote
 on the Australian amendment
 calling for a four-power summit
 rather than on the neutralists'
 request for contacts between
 Khrushchev and the President
 was an "overwhelming defeat for
 the West."  Bloc propagandists
 also assessed the results of
 the debate on the representation
 for Communist China as a pyrrhic
 victory for the United States
 and its allies.
 Khrushchev may have had
 the Chinese in mind when he
 told reporters, "He who be-
 lieves that our efforts were
 An additional factor in
 Khrushchev's decision to extend
 his stay may have been his hope
 that he could exploit the impact
 of a successful technological
 achievement such as a space
 flight.
 East-West Issues
 Khrushchev's four-week stay
 in New York yielded no important
 advances in Soviet positions
 on disarmament, Germany and Ber-
 lin, nuclear testing, or the
 general question of renewed con-
 tacts between East and West.
 Khrushchev clearly indicated
 that serious East-West talks
 will be deferred until a new
 administration takes office in
 Washington.   In his second con-
 versation with Prime Minister
 Macmillan, he acknowledged that
 Berlin negotiations at the sum-
 mit would have to wait until a
 new American administration was
 firmly established, thus backing
 down from his insistence in
 their first meeting that a sum-
 mit should be held in January.
 Khrushchev has virtually
 ignored the negotiations on a
 nuclear test ban,   Although

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 Prime Minister Macmillan raised
 the issue,  Khrushchev did not
 respond.   At the talks in Geneva,
 the Soviet delegation adhered
 to its proposal for a four- to
 five-year moratorium on small
 underground tests,  and termed
 a US proposal for a two-year
 moratorium unacceptable.
 The Soviet chief delegate
 also reiterated the USSR's po-
 sition that any action by the
 United States to conduct uni-
 lateral nuclear tests during a
 research program for improving
 detection techniques would be
 regarded as an indication that
 the US was resuming weapons
 tests,  and the Soviet Union
 would consider itself free to
 resume testing.   Izvestia re-
 peated this warning on 8-73cto-
 ber in an article charging the
 US with the intention of break-
 ing up the talks as part of a
 campaign to prevent an improve-
 ment in East-West relations.
 On the Berlin and German
 questions,  Khrushchev'. New
 York performance has been ac-
 companied by an extensive diplo-
 matic and propaganda campaign.
 Since the announcement on 30
 September of Bonn's abrogation
 of the interzonal trade agree-
 ment, bloc moves against  .rest
 Germany have been gradually in-
 creased and sharpened.
 On 6 October Po-
 land dispatched to
 the NATO countries
 an aide-memoire in-
 tended to document
 charges of stepped-
 up West German mili-
 taristic and revanch-
 ist actions.   At the
 same time, Moscow
 protested to the
 four powers against
 West German rearma-
 ment with nuclear
 weapons and warned
 that the bloc countries would
 take measures to ensure their
 own security.   Moscow and War-
 saw then joined with East Ger-
 many and Czechoslovakia in a
 joint declaration appealing to
 all the wartime allies to pre-
 vent West German nuclear re-
 armament and press for the con-
 clusion of a German peace treaty.
 The well-coordinated cam-
 paign may be part of an effort
 to justify bloc countermeasures
 against Bonn.   After playing
 down any suggestion of impend-
 ing crisis on the Berlin issues,
 Pravda on 9 October reportedly
 tooTFan unusually sharp line in
 claiming that the West; German
 action in denouncing the trade
 pact was provocative and could
 lead to "a general war."   At
 the same time, however,  bloc
 comments have been careful to
 stress the probability of sum-
 mit negotiations on Berlin.
 Chinese UN Representation
 The 8 October vote of the
 15th UN General Assembly to up-
 hold the moratorium on discus-
 sion of the Chinese representa-
 tion issue emphasized the con-
 tinuing erosion of support for
 Nationalist China.   Forty-two
 nations voted for,  34 against,
 and 22 abstained,  giving Taipei
 the slimmest margin since 1951.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 None of the 16 newly admitted
 states supported the moratorium,
 and opposing votes were cast by
 three--Mali,  Senegal,  and Ni-
 geria.   Taipei also lost the
 support of Laos and Malaya,
 both of which abstained.  Ethi-
 opia and Cuba,  which had ab-
 stained last year,  voted against
 the moratorium.
 Initially a few of the new
 African. states planned to vote
 for the moratorium,  but after
 the opening of the General As-
 sembly session,  a strong trend
 developed toward abstention and
 even opposition.   Delegations
 which had previously indicated
 they would support it,  later
 explained their abstention on
 the ground that they could not
 break the unity of the   new
 states.   Even the abstentions
 were obtained with great dif-
 ficulty by the West in view of
 the energetic campaign by the
 Soviet bloc and some neutralist
 members in behalf of Peiping's
 admission.
 Following the balloting,
 various African delegates made
 public statements indicating
 that the abstentions were grudg-
 ing                                                               and would not be repeated
 in the future.   The general
 mood of many supporters of the
 moratorium after the voting
 was that the issue would be
 doomed if presented to any future
 session.
 REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
 The power struggle in Leo-
 poldville remains stalemated,
 but army chief Joseph Mobutu
 is determined to arrest Lu-
 mumba.   His efforts have led
 to a very tense situation, and
 any implementation of his
 threats to use force would
 bring him into open conflict
 with the UN Command.   On 12
 October he reportedly had
 about 1,000 Congolese troops
 in the vicinity of Lumumba's
 residence.
 His first effort to send
 a Congolese Army unit to arrest
 the former premier was frus-
 trated by the UN guard..---largely
 Ghanaian-.at his official res-
 idence.   Mobutu then demanded
 that the UN yield Lumumba,  but
 was turned down on 11 October.
 A government spokesman then
 threatened a "nation wide up.
 rising" if Lumumba were not
 surrendered.   However,  UN rep-??
 resentat ive Dayal has stated
 that Lumumba can can'be surrend-
 ered only'if parliament with-
 draws his parliamentary immunity.
 Mobutu then charged the UN of-
 ficial with a "false interpreta-
 tion" of Congolese law, and
 Dayal countered that the move
 to arrest Lumumba was a "trick"
 and not a proper solution to the
 Congo's problem.
 Mobutu is likely to move
 slowly on any appeal to the
 populace because of Lurrrumba's
 demonstrated spellbinding capa-
 bility.                                                                         If Mobutu is dissuaded
 from using force, however,  he
 may be prompted to reconvene par-
 liament, whose members have
 lately been. critical of Lumumba,
 in order to deprive thef.ormer
 premier of his legislative im-
 munity.
 Active support for Lumumba
 from Ghana, Guinea, and the UAR
 has counterbalanced to some ex
 tent the fall in Lumumbals

 Meanwhile, the situation
 in Katanga Province is also
 serious.,   Anti-Tshomb6 Baluba
 tribesmen appear to control
 large areas of northern and
 central Katanga and to have
 made numerous depredations
 against Europeans.   Many offi-
 cials in Elisabethville re-
 portedly fear that this tribal
 guerrilla conflict with the
 Katanga government now is en-
 tering a critical phase which
 could become a full-scale civil
 war.   The widened scope of
 rebel activities suggests that
 some form of Baluba political
 organization is taking shape.
 President Tshomb6 has strongly
 criticized the UN Command for
 failing to give his troops a
 free hand in putting down the
 disorders.
 Tshomb6 also seems to be
 under pressure from anti-Bel-
 gian elements within his Conakat
 party, and apparently as a re-
 sult has lately attacked Brus-
 sels for failing to grant Ka-
 tanga diplomatic recognition.
 SITUATION IN LAOS
 Peace talks between the
 Souvanna Phouma government and
 the Pathet Lao began in Vien-
 tiane on 11 October.   During
 the initial encounter, the gov-
 ernment reportedly demanded a
 cessation of Pathet Lao guerril-
 la:-,attacks, the restoration of
 Sam Neua Province to government
 control, and the rearming of
 government troops disarmed by
 the Pathet Lao after the fall
 of Sam Neua town in late Sep-
 tember.   The Pathet Lao pro-
 posed the integration of Pathet
 troops with Vientiane troops
 to fight General Phoumi and of-
 ficial action by the Souvanna
 government condemning Phoumi's
 Savannakhet Revolutionary Com-
 mittee.
 The Pathet proposals ap-
 pear propagandistic in nature
 and will undoubtedly be aug-
 mented in future sessions by a
 set of more specific demands
 bearing on..the role the Pathets
 hope to play in the national po-
 litical life.   These may include
 reintegration of Pathet func-
 tionaries into the civil serv-
 ice,  fixed territorial enclaves
 for Pathet troops, membership
 in Souvanna's government, and
 new national elections.
 Souvanna has claimed to
 the American ambassador that
 he will break off the talks if
 the Pathet Lao rejects the pre-
 conditions for substantive talks
 enunciated in the first session.
 In any event, he states that he
 will attempt to string the nego-
 tiations out for as long as
 possible.   The premier will be
 under considerable pressure,

 will be watching the course of
 the talks and may move to over-
 throw                Souvanna if he precipi-
 tately breaks off the talks or
 takes too hard a line with the
 Pathet Lao.
 Reports from Phong Saly
 Province indicate continued
 Pathet attacks on government
 outposts despite the nominal
 cease-fire supposedly obtain-
 ing in the area.   The local
 Laotian Army commander reports
 that the Pathet Lao has consid-
 erably augmented its strength
 in the southeastern part of the
 province and that
 two government out-
 posts have fallen.
 This activity is
 clearly designed to
 bring additional pres-
 sure on Souvanna to
 give the Pathet Lao
 what it wants in the
 Vientiane negotia-
 tions.
 No discernible
 progress has been made
 in bringing about a
 reconciliation be-
 tween Souvanna and
 General Pho,umi or in
 repairing the related
 deep split in the
 Laotian Army.   The
 King has in effect
 washed his hands of
 the problem, indicat-
 ing to Ambassador
 Brown that, whatever
 his personal feelings,
 he was in no posi-
 tion to impose a set-
 tlement on the two
 sides.   He stated that
 he would not form a
 new government unless
 Souvanna resigned or
 was forced out by the
 National Assembly.
 The King implied that
 public opinion was running
 against Savannakhet and had
 been attracted by Souvanna's
 "illusory" offer of peace through
 negotiations with the Pathet
 Lao.
 Phoumi's position was bol-
 stered somewhat by another turn-
 over in the military command
 structure in the Second Military
 Region,  after which it was an-
 nounced that the region had re-
 aligned itself with Savannakhet.

 tivity inXieng Khouang Province.
 Pressure from Meo tribal groups
 was said to have played an
 important, if still somewhat
 obscure,  role in the realign-
 ment.  This development may
 tend to stiffen Phoumi's re-
 sistance to any new attempts
 by Souvanna to induce him to
 drop his opposition to the gov-
 ernment.
 A senior Laotian Foreign
 Ministry official   has informed
 Ambassador Brown that a Soviet
 delegation will arrive in Laos
 on 13 October and will probably
 "not come empty-handed."   The
 delegation reportedly will be

 who will also be accredited to
 Laos.   In addition to complet-
 ing the establishment of dip-
 lomatic relations, the dele-
 gation will probably extend
 offers of aid to the Souvanna
 government.   Recent Soviet
 propaganda commentary on the
 Laotian situation has em-
 phasized the dire consequences
 of the Thai economic blockade
 and has accused the United
 States of "stifling" the legal
 government by suspending aid.
 Souvanna may be tempted to ac-
 cept any Soviet offer of assist-
 ance as a means of widening his

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 ARGENTINE POLITICAL CRISIS
 Argentine President Fron-
 dizi faces one of the most se-
 vere crisis .yin his two and one
 half years in office as a re,
 sult.c f the 11 October army ul-
 timatum to dismiss some of his
 advisers and to modify and
 "clarify" some of his policies.
 His skill in negotiating a rec-
 onciliation of his policies
 with the army demands will de-
 termine the continuance of his
 regime and of his petroleum
 and US-backed stabilization pol-
 i0ies.,.,  which have been consid-
 ered models for Latin America.
 The army demands vary wide-
 ly, but important among them are
 the removal of advisers who
 favor wooing Peronista political
 support away from Peron and
 steps to strengthen the national
 petroleum company.  A particular
 target is Rogelio Frigerio--now
 an "unofficial" but influential
 adviser.  He helped negotiate
 Peronista support for Frondizi's
 election in February 1958 and,
 as a member of Frondizi's pres-
 idential staff, pressed for
 the adoption of the US-backed
 stabilization program initiated
 in January 1959.  The army,
 which forced Frigerio's ouster
 in May 1959, mistrusts Frigerio's
 economic advice as well as his
 own political ambitions in the
 future
 The army believes Frigerio
 encourages official help for
 "soft-core" Peronista labor
 leaders in union elections in
 an effort to attract support
 for Frondizi's Intransigent
 Radical party in the gubernato-
 rial and congressional elections
 in March 1962.   The Peronistas
 are still badly split, and those
 supporting Peron openly call
 for subversion.
 Frondizi's petroleum policy
 of making contracts with foreign
 companies, mainly US, for aid in
 developing oil resources and his
 moves to reduce funds for the
 state oil company (YPF) have
 aroused fears of a sellout-"t6
 foreigners,  While major army
 spokesmen say they favor such
 foreign contracts, at the same
 time they wish to see YPF
 strengthened and made more ef-
 ficient.
 Other related demands of
 the army, which has had to re-
 press Peronista and Communist
 terrorism for the past two years,
 include firmer anti-Communist
 measures, federal control over
 several provincial governments
 accused of Peronista or leftist
 leanings, and paradoxically a
 change in economic and financial
 policies to reduce state coni
 trols and opportunities for
 graft.

 his party's traditionally
 nationalist platform in the

 direction of free enterprise
 has caused him severe difficul-
 ties even within his own party,
 and there is widespread dissat-
 isfaction over the austerity
 measures of the stabilization
 program.  These complaints af-
 fect army attitudes.  Highly
 respected retired General Pedro
 Aramburu, who helped oust Peron
 is 1955 and turned over power
 to Frondizi, stated on 11 Octo-
 ber that "the army is a sound-
 ing box for all the unrest....
 The country suffers from a pro-
 found moral and material crisis."
 In a radio reply to the
 army's ultimatum, Frondizi
 strongly defended his policies
 and constitutional procedures
 as essential to economic and
 political recovery.  This eased
 the situation somewhat, but new
 difficulties may result; from
 negotiations with the powerful
 army commander in chief, General
 Carlos Toranzo Montero, whom
 Frondizi  dismissed  on    12
 October,  but    was apparently
 compelled to  reinstate.
 POLITICAL' OUTLOOK.
 Janio Quadros' victory in
 Brazil's 3 October presidential
 election will bring about the
 first basic shake-up in Brazil's
 administrative machinery since
 Vargas came to power in 1930.
 The new regime, sponsored by
 the traditional "out" parties,
 will probably lay heavy stress
 on its declared intention   to
 "clean house" when it takes of-
 fice on 31 January, but it is
 likely to retain most of the
 central programs of the popular
 Kubitschek regime.  Under Quad-
 r'os`;, a temperamental and con-
 troversial personality, the
 government is likely to be even
 more aggressive than in the
 past in bargaining with the
 United States for economic aid
 and may also seek broader ties
 with the Sino-Soviet bloc.
 During the campaign, Quad-
 ros refrained from direct at-
 tacks on Kubitschek's program
 and promised to continue its
 two distinctive features:   rapid
 economic development and "Opera-
 tion Pan America," a plan  for a
 massive assault on underdevelop-
 ment in the hemisphere.  Quad-
 ros also promised to control
 inf lat ion:_and balance the budg-
 et  without sacrificing develop-
 ment.
 Quadros' restraint during
 the campaign and the wide mar-
 gin of his victory have been
 attributed by some sources to
 a reported secret deal. between
 him and Kubitschek.   Kubitschek
 was ineligible to succeed him-
 self but is believed eager to
 run again in 1965; he may there-
 fore consider it an advantage
 to have his party out of power
 during the next five years.
 Quadros will inherit far
 fewer problems than the outgo-
 ing regime did in 1956, but is
 likely to have difficulty meas-
 uring,, up to Kubitschek's

 extraordinary popularity and
 preventing a sense of letdown
 after the exuberant economic
 growth of the past five years.
 He will also face a serious bal-
 ance-of-payments crisis--the
 deficit will probably be at
 least $125,000,000 for 1960--
 a continuing coffee surplus,
 and strong pressure for wage
 increases that if granted
 would undermine this year's suc-
 cess in curbing the rate of in-
 flation.
 Quadros will also confront
 the problem of patching togeth-
 er a working majority in con-
 gress; the present body was
 elected in 1958 and will not be
 renewed until 1962.   Some ob-
 servers fear that Quadros' emo-
 tional instability may lead him
 to adopt ill-considered posi-
 tions in attempting to deal
 with these problems.
 Brazil's relations with
 the United States, which have
 been severely strained several
 times in the past few years--
 mainly over questions of eco-
 nomic aid and trade policy--
 will probably be
 especially
 delicate during the early
 months of

 CUBAN DEVELOPMENTS
 The growing counterrevolu-
 tionary violence in Cuba, al-
 though symptomatic of increas-
 ing opposition, does not at  ,
 this point seriously threaten
 the Castro regime.   Counter-
 revolutionary groups are di-
 vided into mutually antagonistic
 factions and lack leaders with
 wide popular appeal.   The re-
 cent capture of two guerrilla
 leaders and a number of their
 followers in the Escambray
 Mountains of Las Villas Province
 is a sharp setback for the
 counterrevolutionaries.   These
 men and others captured in
 Oriente Province were tried
 promptly.   Sixteen,  including
 one American, were executed on
 13 October.
 On the other hand, the es-

 is an important psychological
 blow for the regime.         These of-
 ficers were associated with the
 popular anti-Communist Major
 Huber Matos, formerly a close
 associate of Fidel Castro`; who
 was denigrated and jailed a
 year ago.  They may eventually
 form the core of a fighting
 group with a genuine popular
 following.
 In Oriente Province, where
 only a few of last week's small
 band of "invaders" .' remkin,+  at
 large, there are reports of de-
 fections by armed forces elements
 and militia personnel, who have
 apparently taken to the moun-
 tains for antigovernment guer-
 rilla operations.
 The Cuban petroleum indus-
 try, forced to shut down opera-
 tions at the nationalized Esso
 refinery because of a shortage
 in the catalyst used in the re-
 fining process, received eight
 carloads of the material on 3
 October from a company in the
 United States.  Plans were made
 to reactivate the refinery, and
 a scheduled rationing of petro-
 leum products was indefinitely
 postponed.
 Cuba has received what are
 probably its second and third
 major shipments of Soviet bloc
 military equipment, and further
 shipments are expected.   The'
 Soviet vessel Sergey Kirov began
 unloading at a small port some
 38 miles west of Havana on 1
 October.
 The Nikolay
 n ro arrived in Havana on 9
 October, and there is strong evi-
 dence that it carried a large
 military cargo.
 The Cuban-Bulgarian com-
 mercial agreement signed in Ha-
 vana on 7 October was the sev-
 enth such agreement concluded
 by Cuba this year with a Sino-
 Soviet bloc country.   Bulgaria
 agreed to buy at least 20,000
 tons of Cuban sugar annually
 for the next five years and to
 increase its purchases of other
 Cuban products.  A protocol on
 scientific and cultural coopera-
 tion was also signed, and the
 two countries agreed to estab-
 lish diplomatic relations on
 the embassy level.
 The US Embassy has received
 an unevaluated but plausible
 report on current thinking with-
 in high Cuban Communist circles.
 Communist leaders are said to
 estimate that Cuba will be sub-
 jected to military attack by the
 United States early next year.
 The Cuban Communists, who re-
 portedly control 8,000 to 10,000
 members of the militia, would
 have the mission of fighting to   25X1

 One of the USSR's most
 noted writers on military doc-
 trine, Maj, Gen. Nikolay Talen-
 sky, presented in the October
 issue of the magazine Interna-
 tional  life the most explicit
 scussion yet to appear in the
 Soviet press on the effects of
 modern war. He condemned as
 "harmful and inhuman" the idea
 --which he almost certainly im-
 putes to the Chinese Communists
 --that war might be justified  ;
 if it meant the end of capital-
 ifmte. on the grounds that another
 war, even if it were '-'local or
 limited" would  be  "nothing
 less than a prelude to a general
 rocket nuclear war." This, he
 implied, would result in un-
 acceptable destruction to the
 USSR. Talensky said failure to
 see these dangers was harmful,
 whereas to see and then under-
 estimate them was "criminal."
 Talensky wrote that casual-
 ties in such a war in   "the
 probable main theater"--North
 America and "almost  all  of
 Europe"--would run to "not less
 than 500 to 600 million"--some
 three quarters of the population;
 this estimate was said to have
 been made "according to the most
 careful calculations"  and did
 not include the effects of chem-
 ical and bacteriological weapons.
 He also said,  "Immense territo:-
 ries will be poisoned by death
 dealing doses of  radiation."
 In a veiled jibe at the Chinese,
 Talensky said that "the most
 active and most cultured part
 of mankind" would thus disappear.
 In presenting this argument,
 Talensky dismissed the point de-
 bated by Soviet military theo-'
 r;ists'in recent years that a mass
 surprise attack by any power
 could bring victory, arguing that
 retaliation would still destroy
 all the vital centers of the at-
 tacker.
 Talensky argued that the
 bloc cannot afford  to  adopt
 policies which run a serious
 risk of even limited war. He
 explained   to  the   Chinese
 that with the advent of the nu-
 clear age,                                                              it is necessary to

 a receding possibility.   He re-
 affirmed Mao Tse-tung's views
 that "atomic bombs could by no
 means destroy the human race"
 and that the outcome of a fu-
 ture war would depend on men
 and not atomic bombs.  These
 have long been fundamental con-
 tentions of the Chinese, who
 look to their 650,000,000 popu-
 lation, their communes; and par-
 ticularly to their 200,000000-
 man militia, for the survival
 of Communist China in a nuclear
 war.
 General Fu's articles were
 in the form of a commentary on
 the publication  of  a,  new
 volume of Mao Tse-tung's writ-

 begun to get volunteers to go
 to the New Lands,
 There is some evidence that
 the number of such volunteers
 has been less than the regime
 hoped for.   Several press arti-
 cles have criticized the failure
 of some unit commanders to "take
 the most elementary steps" to
 induce their men to serve on
 the frontier.   In the staged de-
 mobilization of a heavy tank
 division in Belorussia, observed
 by Western correspondents early
 this summer, the contingent of
 volunteers which entrained at
 Osipovichi for the New Lands ap-
 pears to have been but a minor
 part of the command; the others
 evidently either returned to
 their home villages or went to
 Moscow.   The capital city is
 doubtless the goal of many.
 Poor planning and adminis-
 tration of the resettlement pro-
 gram is also indicated by re-
 ports of friction between volun-
 teers and the local population,
 probably occasioned by competi-
 tion for housing and other
 scarce facilities.   Various
 press articles have castigated
 the inhabitants of some areas
 for an "inhospitable attitude"
 and even for "cheating the ex-
 servicemen`  out of their
 rights,"
 Disgust at such developments
 has evidently caused some volun-
 teers to leave the areas to
 Which they were sent and "shame-
 lessly run home."  Others, chief-
 ly officers, have been, visiting
 several localities before choos-
 ing one or perhaps rejecting all.
 Aside from difficulties as-
 sociated with absorption of the
 released personnel into the
 civilian economy, there are seri-
 ous.,:; problems affecting the
 morale of career officers.   Ac-
 cording to the original plan,
 250,000 of the dischargees were
 to be officers, who, unlike the
 draftee enlisted men, have a
 vested interest in a military
 life that provides them with se-
 curity and status.   Recognizing
 this, the government has made a
 great effort to reassure vulner-
 able officers, sending; high of-
 ficials to meet them and promis-
 ing aid for resettlement.   Never-
 theless:,, there are numerous in-
 dications of great and continuing
 concern among officers.   Selec-
 tions of officers to be retained
 may also injure morale by arous-
 ing suspicion of favoritism.
 The effect on the morale': of
 promising junior officers whom
 the government would wish to
 retain in service will, suffer as
 a result of the doubts as to the
 security offered by a military
 career.   There have been hints
 of this in two recent Red Star
 articles describing the _"ie-
 habilitation" of young; officers
 who had "rashly" resigned their
 commissions.

 National Congress (ANC) and the

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 suffered the greater loss in
 prestige.
 African leaders reportedly
 were impressed by the effective-
 ness of the PAC's demand for an
 "Africa for the Africans," with
 its implied appeal to racism, in
 contrast to the ANC's cautious
 advocacy of equal rights for
 all races.   They also believe
 that ANC President Luthuli was
 outmaneuvered by, the PAC's ag-
 gressive campaign and that the
 ANC leaders then bungled in
 their effort to recover the ini-
 tiative.   As a result the PAC
 has emerged with an enhanced
 reputation for energetic action,
 while the indecisive leadership
 of Luthuli has been discredited.
 The PAC's success derived
 from the emotional appeal of its
 program father than from any or-
 ganizational strength, as the
 imprisonment of its leaders ap-
 pears to have destroyed what
 little organization it had.  PAC
 President Robert Sobukwe remains
 a popular hero: however, it is
 questionable whether his popular-
 ity will survive his absence
 during his present three-year
 jail term. Nonetheless, it seems
 likely that the racist appeal of
 Sobukwe's aggressive program
 will be copied by other black
 South African nationalists to an
 increasing extent in the future.
 Such a trend is evident in
 reported attempts to foment un-
 rest in rural African reserves,
 and in increased aggressiveness
 among activists within the ANC.
 The ANC's "leftist" faction has
 long been dissatisfied.with Lu-
 thuli's moderate approach,  and,
 with some members defecting to
 the PAC,  those militants who re-
 tain some freedom of action are
 attempting to establish a reputa-
 tion for strong leadership.
 Shortly after the state of emer-
 gency in South Africa was lifted
 on 31 August, one such militant
 stated,  "If we are arrested
 again,  let's go to jail fighting,
 not doing nothing."
 The ANC's leftist militants
 will be hampered in their compe-
 tition with the PAC by their long
 history of association with the
 clandestine South Africa Commu-
 nist party.   South African Com-
 munists, most of them white or
 Indian, have become influential
 in the nonwhite movement through
 their organizational abilities,
 and the ANC's "nonracial" plat-
 form was designed in part to
 protect these key Communists
 from African racism.
 With the growth of militant
 African sentiment, however,  look-
 ing to such African states as
 Ghana for organizational support,
 Africans may tend to reject or-
 ganizations and individuals that
 have become associated with a
 "European" ideology.   The few
 black African Communists in         25X1
 South Africa may therefore break
 at least their overt ties with
 the party.

 with Paris, the four states are
 unwilling to accept French direc-
 tion of their coordinated for-

 Entente as well, told the Ameri-

 accredited to all four states,
 in late September that Niger
 and its partners would begin
 negotiations with France 'in mid-
 October for diplomatic, military,
 technical, and other bilateral
 agreements. Unlike the other
 seven Community states which have
 gained their "international sov-
 ereignty" so far,  the Entente
 states were unwilling,  despite
 their previous pro-French orien-
 tation, to negotiate such accords
 before being admitted to the UN,
 a goal attained on 20 September.
 Although he expressed con-
 fidence in the outcome of these
 negotiations, Diori pointedly
 stated that his government would
 not accept any French aid condi-
 tioned on Niger's following French
 direction in foreign affairs,
 "such as voting for France on the
 Algeriangilestion." .Ivory Coast Pres-
 ident Houphouet-Boigny  creator and
 dominant personality of the~Entente
 --and Upper Volta President,. Y. ameogo
 have also indicated recently that
 their states would not support
 France on the Algerian issue at
 the UN even if threatened with
 the loss of much-needed French
 assistance.
 Diori also revealed to the
 charge that he was thinking of
 requesting the withdrawal of
 French military elements now sta-
 tioned in northern Niger. He ap-
 peared to link them with incidents
 which he alleged occur almost
 LIBYA
 daily along the Niger-
 Algerian frontier as a
 result of attempts by
 "a few stupid French"
 to incite nomadic Tuareg
 tribesmen to "stay with
 France" by going to
 Algeria.
 Viewed in conjunc-
 tion with a recent re-
 port of similar con-
 tacts between Tuaregs
 and French army officers
 in neighboring Mali,
 Diori's allegation sug-
 gests that the French
 have recently stepped
 up their efforts to se-
 cure the southern ap-
 proaches to Algeria.
 The clash between rebel guerril-
 las and French troops which oc-
 curred late last month in the
 heart of the Algerian Sahara near
 In Salah has undoubtedly added
 strong impetus to such efforts.
 Since becoming independent,
 the Entente states have indicated
 that, for political as well as
 economic reasons,,  they desire to
 obtain economic aid from other
 countries besides France, especial-
 ly from the United States. More-
 over,  three of the states--Niger,
 Upper Volta,  and Dahomey--which
 presently lack non-French resi-
 dent diplomatic representatives,
 are extremely anxious to obtain
 them. In both cases the feelings
 of Entente leaders are so strong
 that they are probably prepared
 to turn to the Sino-Soviet bloc--
 despite a wariness of involve-
 ment with Communist countries--
 if other Western nations do       25X1
 not act promptly to fulfill ' their
 desires for enhanced interna-
 tional status.

 The Pakistani Government
 apparently is exploiting its
 present border trouble with Af-
 ghanistan to increase its pres-
 ence in its frontier tribal
 areas which have traditionally
 enjoyed considerable autonomy.
 Rawalpindi has long wanted to
 bring these isolated mountain
 areas along the Durand line--
 the old boundary between Afghan-
 istan and British India--under
 its regular local administration,
 Foreign Minister
 Qadir announced on 8
 October that the Nawab
 of Dir, hereditary
 ruler of a tribal
 state bordering Afghan-
 istan north of the
 Khyber Pass, had been
 arrested along with
 the Khan of Jandul,
 the Nawab's son and
 ruler of a small trib-
 alI. region just to the
 south of Dir.  Qadir
 explained that the
 arrests were made fol-
 lowing "many accusa-
 tions of double-deal-
 ing" against the Push-
 toon leaders "by people
 and leaders of the trib-
 A l' areas who were en-
 gaged in heroic efforts
 to repel Afghan tribes-
 men."  The Nawab re-
 portedly had appealed
 to Kabul in September
 for help against rival
 tribal elements seek-
 ing, possibly with the
 support of the Paki.-
 stani authorities, to
 overthrow his regime.
 Rawalpindi prob-
 ably felt the recent
 Afghan incursions
 provided a pretext to
 intervene and install
 an amenable ruler.
 It probably was also
 motivated by a desire
 to position border security
 forces directly on the Durand
 line, thereby enabling it for
 the first time to control con-
 tacts between tribal groups in
 this:region living on both sides
 of the frontier.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY 'SUMMARY
 Rawalpindi's strong-arm
 action in deposing the Nawab of
 Dir probably will arouse con-
 siderable resentment among his
 tribes and may lead them to re-
 sist forcibly the government's
 attempts to extend its control
 over the region.  Rawalpindi,
 however, has named another of
 the Nawab's sons to succeed
 him, apparently having decided
 not to abolish the tribal dy-
 nasty or to bring the state
 under West Pakistan's adminis-
 trative system, as it is attempt-
 ing to do with other tribal
 regions along the frontier.
 Some fighting apparently
 is continuing in the Afghan-
 Pakistani border zone, although
 on a smaller scale than in
 September.  Despite reports
 from Kabul that Pakistani
 "troops" have been involved,
 there is still no evidence that
 Rawalpindi has committed regu-
 lar army forces.  Units of the
 quasii4ailit'azcy . border security
 forces have, however, been
 moved  into  the troubled
 Bajaur  area  and  reportedly
 have been engaged in some
 clashes.
 The Japanese Diet will
 convene on 17 October for an
 extraordinary session, its
 first under the Ikeda govern-
 ment, and what will probably
 be a brief but stormy launching
 of the final phase of the campaign
 for lower house elections, ten-
 tatively set for 20 November.
 Prime Minister Ikeda and
 his principal cabinet ministers,
 including Foreign Minister Kosaka
 and Finance Minister Mizuta, are
 scheduled to deliver major policy
 speeches in which they probably
 will reiterate the Liberal Demo-
 cratic party's (LDP) platform
 pledges of close cooperation with
 the free world, tax reductions,
 and expanded welfare services.
 This platform and the public
 revulsion against leftist excess-
 es in the May-June demonstrations
 appear to have been major reasons
 for LDP victories in four guber-
 natorial elections since early
 July as well as for the strong
 conservative showing in a recent
 series of public opinion polls.
 Ikeda does not plan any
 significant legislative action
 at this session, presumably on
 the assumption that the wave of
 early popular enthusiasm for
 his cabinet will carry over to
 election time.   He hopes to
 dissolve the Diet well before
 the end of October.
 The Socialists probably
 will strive to prolong the ses
 sion while seeking a new approach
 for attacking the government.

 lacked an issue to exploit, but
 may have found one in the recent
 marked rise in consumer prices,
 which had been relatively con-
 stant since 1953.  The price
 rise, although not yet a serious
 liability to Ikeda, does under-
 line contentions by the Social-
 ists and many Japanese finan-
 ciers that Ikeda's expansionist
 economic program will create a
 serious inflationary problem.
 The government has announced
 a four-point program to counter
 the increase.
 Communist China's strong-
 propaganda attacks on Ikeda on
 11-October ended Peiping's hope-
 ful waiting for a less "hostile"
 policy from the new Japanese
 prime minister.  Obviously in-
 tended to assist the Japanese
 Socialists in the elections,
 Peiping's move may backfire as
 in the elections of May 1958.
 Nevertheless,  the current
 two-week visit of Tatsunosuke
 Takas9k?,a second-line conserv-
 ative:, leader, to Communist
 China could also prove untimely
 for the Ikeda government.  Al-
 though Takasaki failed to ob-
 tain governmental endorsement
 for his trip, which is intended
 to explore means for solving
 Sino-Japanese differences, he
 favors a more liberal policy
 than Ikeda toward Peiping and
 could play into Socialist hands
 by causing  difficulties  in
 Tokyo's efforts to hold the line
 against Peiping's terms for a
 full-scale resumption of trade.
 The most immediate effect
 of the assassination of Social-
 ist party chairman Asanuma on
 12 October probably will be on
 the JSP itself.  Asanuma, who
 was the symbol of the JSP's
 anti-American, pro-Communist
 orientation, recently had been
 attempting to retreat to a more
 neutral position in the wake of
 adverse public reaction to So-
 cialist extremism in the May-
 June crisis.   Strong opposition
 by intraparty elements and the
 Sohyo labor federation to any
 retrenchment may result in a
 struggle in naming a new party
 chairman.
 The Socialists have inti-
 mated that Asanuma's assassina-
 tion was a calculated plot and
 will use the incident in an ef-
 fort to develop a sympathy vote
 in the elections.   However, there
 is no indication of conservative
 involvement or sign as yet that
 it will significantly affect the
 elections.
 For the Democratic Social-
 ist party (DSP), caught; in the
 middle with a moderate but nebu-
 lous program,  the forthcoming
 election is critical.   Informed
 observers believe that unless
 the DSP adds substantially to
 its 40 seats in the lower house,
 it cannot survive.  They believe
 further that if the party does
 increase its strength, which
 is not at all certain, it will
 probably  do  so  at  the  ex-
 pense                                                       of  the  Socialists         in
 the  form of  a   protest
 against  the  JSP's  extremism.

 and continues support of Kubar,
 he will risk a       further  build-
 up of antigovernment                   pressures
 endangering  the  monarchy       it-
 self.
 Omani rebel leaders, with
 headquarters in Dammam on the
 Saudi Arabian Persian Gulf
 Coast, are continuing their
 efforts to train and equip an
 "Omani expeditionary force"
 which could eventually return
 to "liberate" the country from
 the rule of the British-backed
 Sultan  of  Muscat  and Oman.
 Although the rebels are still
 able to smuggle occasional ship-
 ments of weapons through to
 their supporters in inner Oman,
 sniping and mining activities
 there have diminished in recent
 weeks: In Saudi Arabia, on the
 other hand, the rebels are
 gradually augmenting and train=
 ing a force of several hundred.
 Offices of the
 "Imamate of Oman" in
 Cairo and Damascus
 have stepped up their
 publication of propa-   25X1
 ganda booklets; their
 handouts get frequent
 play in the radio and
 press of the UAR, Iraq,
 and Saudi Arabia; and
 they are pressing for
 increased support from
 all the Arab states.
 Meanwhile,  the
 British, hoping to
 avoid again becoming
 involved in a major
 military operation-
 against the rebels,
 have moved both to
 strengthen the Sultan
 and to maintain clan-
 destine contacts with
 rebel leaders.  London
 has little hope that these nego-
 tiations will result in a settle-
 ment in the foreseeable future
 but considers them useful to
 occupy the rebels.   British
 forces continue coastal patrols
 against smuggling and periodic
 military exercises in the inter--
 rior -:to 'n'timjdats the :rebels.
 Over the long term, however,
 the British emphasize -they, expect
 to win support for the Sultan
 through implementation of a
 development program.   London
 recently agreed to provide near-
 ly $3,500,000 in capital costs
 for the Sultan's army and air
 force, $784,000 in capital costs
 for development, and a recurrent   25X1
 annual subsidy of $3,780,000,
 which is more than double the
 previous: Subsidy.

 reverse De Gaulle's policy of
 self-determination for Algeria.
 The willingness of  many

 restrictions in Berlin and fear
 that it ultimately will enhance
 the prestige of the East German
 regime by necessitating new
 trade negotiations on a govern-
 ment-to-government basis.
 Bonn apparently is retreat-
 ing a little from its trade pact
 decision and feels somewhat de-
 fensive about it.   Chancellor
 Adenauer is reported to have
 told members of his Chribtian
 Democratic party (CDU) that he
 was maneuvered into the move by
 the Western Allies.  He added,
 however,  that although the ac-
 tion might lead to an improve-
 ment of the international status
 of East Germany,  Bonn could not
 afford to leave the whole burden
 of taking countermeasures to the
 Allies.
 West Berlin Mayor Willy
 Brandt is said to view the trade
 pact cancellation as of doubt-
 ful value and sees no possibili-
 ty of effective Western action to
 prevent a further deterioration
 of,.~the ,situation in Berlin: -: He
 stated that if Adenauer desired
 to relieve the Allies of some
 of their burden,  he should have
 moved to establish closer ties
 with the Berlin government.  This
 could have been done by treat-
 ing traffic to and from West
 Berlin as actually traffic be-
 tween two parts of the Federal
 Republic, any interruption of
 which would have resulted in
 Bonn's cutting all East German
 transit traffic in West Germany,
 including the use of the ports
 of Hamburg and Bremen.
 Foreign Minister von Bren-
 stated,
 "These other Allies have grown
 tired of the Berlin issue."
 American Ambassador Whitney re-
 ported after an interview on 7
 October that Macmillan believes
 the pressures on Berlin are not
 serious at present;  the ambas-
 sador inferred that Britain was
 not willing to apply any economic
 sanctions at this time.
 Belgian banks on 11 October
 agreed to extend a five-year
 credit of $8,000,000 to East
 Germany, with a possible future
 increase to $12,000,000. Belgium,
 which has lost sizable markets
 in the Congo and believes that
 its NATO allies have not sup.--
 ported it there, will probably
 not be influenced by West Ger-
 man protests.
 East Germany appears to be
 attempting to exploit a number
 of these West German misgivings
 on the trade agreement   issue.
 In an article on 9 October in
 Neues Deutschland,  Foreign Trade
 Minister Rau  a=ccred that any
 new agreement would have to re-
 flect the legal and factual sit-
 uation,suggesting that East Ger-
 many will attempt to secure the
 reopening of negotiations on at
 least the Foreign Trade Ministry
 level.   Moreover,  in a Leipziger
 Volkszeitung  article oc-
 oer, Rau contended--?in an obvi-
 ous attempt to appeal to West-
 ern businessmen and neutralists
 --that any attempt to impose an
 embargo on the bloc countries
 would be "madness," since the
 bloc would then develop its own
 production and become a competi-
 tor of Western businessmen.
 Both Rau and Premier Grote-
 wohl have strongly asserted that
 Bonn's measures--if implemented
 --would at most have only a
 temporary adverse effect on the
 regime's economy, evidently in
 an effort to allay the reported
 fears of East German foreign
 trade and planning officials
 who hold contrary views.  Never-
 theless,  they have aLso recent-
 ly called for special efforts
 by East German enterprises to
 expand production, which sug-
 gests that the regime is less
 confident of its ability to
 stand up to a West German embar-
 go than public statements allege.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 In an apparent move to as-
 sert its claim that West Berlin
 is "in its territory," the East
 German regime since 2 October
 has ceased to issue transit per-
 mits for certain shipments from
 bloc countries to West Berlin.
 The regime  on  12  October an-
 nounced that, under a ruling
 not hitherto known to exist,  it
 reserves the right to refuse
 permits "only if similar goods
 of equal quality, offered  by
 East Germany,  were rejected by
 the West Berlin authorities as
 an act of sabotage againstintra-
 German 'trade."  Although West
 Berlin`:  obtains only 1.4 per-
 cent of its total imports from
 the bloc, the East German ac-
 tion  is designed to underline
 the regime's ability to isolate
 West Berlin without further
 notice.
 Meanwhile, West Berlin
 officials are concerned with
 the recent increase in the number
 of East Berliners and East Ger-
 mans who work in the  Western
 sectors of Berlin.   The increase
 of more than 6,000 since 30 June
 1960--for a total of almost 50,-
 000--seems to be in response to
 abundant work opportunities
 rather than deliberate Commu-
 nist political infiltration.
 Berlin  officials .:have
 privately warned West   Berlin
 manufactures of the risks they
 incur by permitting themselves
 to become dependent on East
 German labor.
 British Labor party leader
 Hugh Gaitskell seems in no im-
 mediate danger of losing his
 position despite his major-de-
 feat on 5 October on defense
 policies at the Labor party con-
 ference.   Because some 80 per-
 cent of the local Labor con-
 stituency representatives--the
 political arm of the Labor move-
 ment--endorsed his pro-NATO
 policies at the conference,
 Gaitskell will probably be re-
 elected by a fairly large ma-
 jority when the 255 Labor mem-
 bers of Parliament--who  are
 predominantly moderates--or-
 ganize for the beginning of
 the new session early in No-
 vember.
 Faced with this endorse-
 ment, the left-wingers led by
 the transport workers' Frank
 Cousins' are likely to continue
 their agitation for unilateral
 nuclear disarmament by Britain
 but will bide their time on
 trying to oust Gaitskell. Their
 representation in the top party
 hierarchy has been increased
 by the election at the confer-
 ence of Harry Nicholas, Cousin'
 principal union assistant, as
 party treasurer.
 In the vote for new members
 of the party's powerful 25-mem-
 ber National Executive Committee,
 two moderates were replaced by
 proponents of unilateral disarma-
 ment. Chairmanship of the com-
 mittee goes this year by rota-
 tion to leftist-inclined Richard
 Crossman, whom Gaitskell dropped
 from the "shadow" cabinet last
 spring for his opposition to the
 party's official defense state-
 ment.
 Gaitskell's tenure as party
 leader depends largely on the
 absence of any immediate alter-
 native and will continue to be
 precarious. His longer range
 prospects will depend on the
 positions taken by such moderates
 as George Brown and James Callag-
 han, who generally support Gait-
 skell but feel that his leader-
 ship has been a major factor in
 the party's decline.   Gaitskell's
 chances may also be affected by
 the tactical moves of "shadow"
 chancellor of the Exchequer

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 Harold Wilson, the leading con-
 tender for election to Anelirin-
 Deva.n's former. position,. as dep-
 uty leader. of the, party in Par- .
 liament . Now the favorite of the
 left wing,  Wilson may try to
 broaden his support so that he
 can seriously challenge {:'.Gait-
 skell  some  timef':tin,the fu-
 ture.
 The radicals' success in get-
 ting the conference to administer
 the first major rebuff to the par-
 ty leaders in the postwar period
 will stimulate their heretofore
 futile campaign to capture the
 Labor party organization. The re- 25X1
 sultant strife will further limit
 Labor's effectiveness as a parlia-
 mentary opposition.
 The expected formation later-
 this fall of a new national labor.
 federation will complete the
 breach in Finnish organized labor.
 The regular Social Democrats
 plan to form the new federation
 to rival the Finnish Confedera-
 tion of Trade Unions (SAK), now
 controlled by a coalition of
 dissident Social Democrats
 (Skogists) and Communists.  Last
 May, after the Skogists and Com-
 munists had gained control of
 the SAK executive committee,
 the regular Social Democratic
 chairman resigned, and other
 party regulars have since been
 replaced by Skogists in almost
 all the confederations _ execu-
 tive posts.
 Creation of the new organi-
 zation will lead to labor unrest,
 because the two politically
 oriented federations will be
 competing in most branches of
 the labor market.   The Social
 Democratic organization will
 initially be handicapped by its
 relatively small membership--
 perhaps 50,000-75,000 members,
 as compared with the 150,000-
 200,000 expected to remain in
 SAK. Employers, although prob-
 ably more sympathetic political-
 ly to the new confederation,
 prefer to deal with a strong
 central labor organization. Tb
 be prepared for the wage con-
 tract negotiations this fall,
 the regular Social Democrats
 plan soon to announce formation
 of the new organization in the
 hope of affiliating immediately
 a number of the unions already
 out of SAK.   A formal assembly
 of the members will not take
 place before late December.
 The Skogist leaders in SAK
 depend on support from the Com-
 munists, who have so far re-
 mained in the background and
 have not fought Skogist moves
 blocking them from executive
 posts.   At the same time, they
 are consolidating their posi-
 tion by refusing to agree to
 admit additional unions which
 might strengthen the position
 of the Skogists. The Communists
 probably expect that the steady
 withdrawal of Social Democratic
 unions will inevitably result
 in shifting the balance of power
 in their favor.

 the   International  Confedera-
 tion of Free Trade                                                              Unions
 (ICFTU), of which SAK   is a
 member, may also  be affected
 by these developments.   It ap-
 pears likely  that the                                                               affilia-
 tion will be switched to the
 new organization once it is
 established, and the ICFTU chair-
 man has already been approached
 by various Social   Democratic   25X1
 leaders  in  regard  to this
 problem.

 Communist China,  which
 has pledged support for all na-
 tional independence movements,
 has directed particular atten-
 tion toward Africa in this year
 of emerging African states.   In
 seeking influence there,  it en-
 counters formidable competition
 not only from Nationalist China,
 which so far has been more suc-
 cessful than Peiping in gaining
 recognition from the new states,
 but also from the UAR,  which has
 ambitions of its own for hegem-
 ony over Africa. Peiping also
 finds itself in disagreement
 with Moscow over how best to
 exploit the situation in Afri-
 ca.   Despite their limited ad-
 vances to date, the Chinese
 Communists feel they have paved
 the way for increasing their
 influence on the continent as
 leftist African forces gain as-
 cendancy.
 Propaganda
 In broadcasts and other
 propaganda to Africa, Communist
 China depicts itself as a fel-
 low victim of past foreign ex-
 ploitation,                           implying that its
 progress since "liberation" is
 a model for other new states.
 The Chinese have concentrated
 on "neo-colonialism" or US eco-
 nomic aid,' which they warn is an at=
 tempt by the US--,,,the most vicious
 enemy"--to supplant the old
 colonial powers.   Timely prop-
 aganda and mass rallies are de-
 voted to special themes such
 as "Quit Africa Day," "Congo
 Day," and "Portuguese Africa
 Day."
 Peiping's effort involves
 an ambitious and expanding pro-
 gram of broadcasts to Africa
 in English,  French,  Portuguese,
 and Arabic.   In addition, Can-
 tonese-language broadcasts are
 directed toward Chinese minori-
 ties, which number about 6,000
 in South Africa,  5,000 in the
 Malagasy Republic, and 16,000
 on Mauritius.
 Peiping is also trying to
 enlist African talent, and may
 be contemplating broadcasts in
 African tongues.   Three Zanzibar
 residents were recently brought
 to China to train as broadcast-
 ors.,
 Peiping frequently finances
 such trips and then prompts its
 African guests to make anti-US
 remarks which it can quote in
 its propaganda.   The Chinese
 have offered scholarships to
 students from Guinea, Ghana,
 Cameroun,  and the Somali Repub-
 lic.
 Large quantities of Chinese
 Communist publications are re-
 portedly available in Zanzibar
 bookshops,  and increasing num-
 bers have been appearing in Sen-
 egal and Guinea.   Peiping has
 also moved to expand the activ-
 ities of its New China News
 Agency  (NCNA) in Africa.   NCNA
 offices have been set up in
 Morocco and Ghana, and one is
 planned for Guinea.   The head
 of the NCNA office in Paris
 visited the Congo shortly after
 it attained independence and
 said consideration was being
 given to opening an office there
 after the situation quiets down.
 On the "people's diplomacy"
 level, a Chinese-African Peo-
 ple's Friendship Association was
 formed in April 1960 to promote
 cultural contacts with Africa.

 A local friendship association
 was set up in the Congo in July
 during the visit of the NCNA
 Paris representative.   Touring
 dance ensembles and opera
 troupes from Peiping are used
 to arouse popular interest in
 China; an acrobatic troupe, for
 example,  recently concluded a
 seven-month tour of Sudan, Guin-
 ea,   Morocco, and Ethiopia. The
 activities of such groups are
 not, however,  limited to on-
 stage performances--a Chinese
 Moslem delegation devoted its
 recent nine-day visit to the
 Somali Republic almost entirely
 to the cultivation of opposition
 parties.
 The Afro-Asian movement
 affords Peiping a potentially
 valuable vehicle for enhancing
 its prestige and influence in
 Africa.   The scope for maneu-
 ver,                   however,  is often circum-
 scribed by Nasir and other neu-
 tralists who are ambitious to
 extend their own influences in
 the movement.   The Chinese Com-
 munist representative on the
 Permanent Secretariat of the
 Afro-Asian People's Solidarity
 Organization in Cairo led a
 drive in 1959 to discredit the
 incumbent UAR secretary general,
 and at the organization meeting
 in Conakry in April of this
 year the Chinese delegation
 made a strong but unsuccessful
 effort to depose the secretary
 general and move the secretari-
 at from Cairo.
 Communist China sent the
 largest delegation to the Con-
 akry meeting and made a strong
 bid to inject its bitter hos-
 tility toward the US into the
 "national liberation struggle."
 Peiping's heavy-handed approach
 turned out to be self-defeating,
 however,  and even the bloc-ori-
 ented President of Guinea
 rebuked those who brought to
 Africa "their quarrels and dif-
 ferences."
 Peiping is also a member
 of the Afro-Asian Economic Or-
 ganization, an informal group-
 ing of chambers of commerce.
 In this organization,  as in the
 Solidarity Organization, Peiping
 has been only partially success-
 ful in projecting its influence.
 At the second Afro-Asian econom-
 ic conference in Cairo in April
 and May 1960,  Peiping fought un-
 successfully to get the USSR
 and the five Central Asian So-
 viet republics admitted to mem-
 bership.   Here again it clashed
 with the UAR.  After the UAR
 Withdrew its initial support
 for the proposal,  the session
 became the occasion for angry
 exchanges between the Chinese
 and UAR delegates.
 Recognition
 The quest for broader in-
 ternational recognition and the
 concomitant undercutting of Tai-
 pei's international standing
 are major motivations in Com-
 munist China's campaign in Afri-
 ca.   It has been quick to ac-
 cord recognition to new states,
 in some cases taking this step
 before the date of actual inde-
 pendence.   However, none of the
 16 states which have gained in-
 dependence this year has recog-
 nized Peiping.   Togo, Cameroun,
 Senegal, Mali, the Malagasy
 Republic,  and the Congo Repub-
 lic  (former French),  which were
 recognized by both Communist and
 Nationalist China,  chose Taipei,
 and the Nationalists stand a
 good chance of gaining recogni-
 tion from other former French
 territories.
 However, several of the new
 states apparently believe they
 can recognize both Peiping and
 Taipei.    When '' faced  with

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 Chinese Communist trade
 with Africa has been slight,
 remaining since 1957 around
 $100,000,000 annually--about
 half of which is with the UAR.
 The exchange involves Chinese
 light industrial goods--plus
 tea to Morocco--for basic com-
 modities such as wool,  cotton,
 fertilizer, and other raw ma-
 terials.
 The importance of this
 trade for China lies in its
 potential for promoting Pei-
 ping's political position in
 Africa.   Peiping has pushed the
 establishment of trade offices
 in nonbloc countries as the
 first major step toward diplo-
 matic recognition.   It signed
 a trade pact with Morocco in
 October 1957, hoping it would
 promote interest in China. Af-
 ter Morocco announced recogni-
 tion "in principle" in Septem-
 ber 1958,  the Chinese Commu-
 nists quickly sent a high-
 level trade delegation to push
 for full recognition, which
 came the next month.
 There is a potential for
 trade expansion,  although some-
 what limited by distances in-
 volved and the inability of
 China to provide a large quan-
 tity of industrial goods.   A
 trade pact signed with Guinea
 during President Tourd's visit
 last month to Peiping calls for
 an annual exchange of almost
 $10,000,000 in goods--some 10
 percent of Guinea's foreign
 trade.   The Chinese will be
 receptive to opportunities for
 similar trade agreements with
 the other new states of Africa.
 While the Chinese are in
 no position to extend aid to
 Africa on the scale of the So-
 viet outlay,  Peiping is alive
 to the political gains that can
 accrue from an assistance pro-
 gram.    Guinea--again the target
 of Peiping's first major effort
 --received a $25,000,000 inter-
 est-free credit during Tourd's
 visit.   Because of its inability
 to extend sizable credits to all,
 Communist China will probably
 continue with smaller scale,  eas-
 ily implemented projects that
 have a high utility and there-
 fore a high psychological impact.
 Along this line,  China be-
 fore the recent agreements had
 sent rice agronomists to Guinea.
 Similarly, Peiping last winter
 sent tea-growing experts to
 Morocco.   The Chinese pleased
 their hosts by declaring cer-
 tain areas there suitable for
 tea cultivation, after UN in-
 vestigators had given an un-
 favorable report.   To Sudan, Pei-
 ping has offered to give Chinese-
 made short-wave radiotransmitters,
 aware of the value underdeveloped
 countries place on possession of
 these prestige items.
 Reflection 'of SinoSoviet 'Rift
 The differences between
 Peiping and Moscow on the best
 strategy for exploiting the op-
 portunities in Africa derive in
 part from their differing as-
 sessment of the possibilities
 for early revolution there and
 in part from the status,  or lack
 of status,  which the two regimes
 have on the international diplo-
 matic scene.   The Chinese be-
 lieve there is an "unprecedent-
 edly favorable" situation now
 for revolutions in colonial and
 semicolonial areas and that
 Africa is a key area for turn-
 ing the balance of international
 forces against the West by mil-
 itant methods,  including revolu-
 tionary violence.   At the same
 time, they are not constrained--
 as is the USSR--by diplomatic
 negotiations with the West, bi-
 laterally and in the UN.
 Chinese discussions of "na-
 tional liberation" movements thus
 assume a more aggressive note than

 those of the Soviet Union.
 While professing adherence to
 the principle of peaceful co-
 existence,  the Chinese argue
 that peace can be assured only
 by the destruction of im-
 perialism, and that "just wars"
 against imperialism should be
 encouraged and supported.   In
 the specific case of Algeria,
 Peiping has been in obvious
 disagreement with the Soviet
 Union over such encouragement
 and support.
 In contrast,  the Russians
 feel the situation in most
 African countries is not ripe
 for revolutionary action, and
 they are less willing than
 Peiping apparently is to accept
 the risk that such action may
 rapidly develop into major war.
 The example of Soviet economic
 progress and a program of
 trade, aid, and political sup-
 port for the governments
 are major factors in Moscow's
 plans for raising the pres-
 tige of revolutionary movements
 and promoting the acceptance
 of Communism in Africa.   It
 recognizes that strong national-
 ist and anti-imperialist feeling
 cannot automatically be har--
 nessed in support of a Communist
 revolution,  and for the present
 it is content to exploit these
 feelings to undercut the West.
 Nevertheless, when the
 USSR sees a "national liberation
 movement", such as that in the
 Congo, which it believes:can
 immediately be turned to its
 advantage, it:rushes in with
 strong propaganda and diplo-
 matic support and material aid.
 As Pravda put it on 26
 August, the national bourgeoisie
 must assume the initial leader-
 ship in the liberation struggle.
 It scored "doctrinairians" who
 "sniff "at this form of nation-
 al liberation movement--as ex-
 emplified by present govern-
 ments in India, Indonesia, the
 UAR, and Iraq--just because
 they are of a democratic and
 not a socialistic character.
 The typical Chinese rejoinder
 evidences Peiping's impatience
 with Moscow's gradualist strat-
 egy.  People's Daily on 30 Aug-
 ust expressed dismay at the com-
 rades who applauded liberation
 movements led by the bourgeoisie
 while disregarding the "anti-
 imperialist struggles of the
 masses of revolutionary people."
 The disagreement with Mos-
 cow apparently turns around the
 length of time during which
 cooperation with the national
 bourgeoisie will be toler-
 ated.   The Russians argue that
 in Africa the struggle for some
 time to come will be against
 "medieval remnants" rather than
 capitalism, and therefore
 "lengthy cooperation" with the
 bourgeoisie is necessary.
 Moscow has indicated a lack of
 complete satisfaction with
 nationalist leaderships, but
 where it feels there is no other
 choice it is prepared to bide
 its time; Peiping apparently
 is not.
 Moscow feels that it is
 necessary first to build up its
 influence through economic ties,
 and only later, when Communist
 parties develop and are stronger,
 to take control through action
 of local Communists.   Peiping's
 inability to provide extensive
 aid may in part account for its
 more impatient attitude.
 The expense-paid trips to
 China show that the Chinese are
 not insensible to the need for
 courting non-Communist African
 leaders.   Peiping, moreover,
 has never gone to the extent
 of naming the nationalist lead-
 ers it feels are ready for.re-
 placement.   It continues to in-
 sist, however, that Communist
 countries should give more
 active support to revolutionary
 forces not yet represented in
 today's African governments.

 JAPANESE ACTIVITIES IN THE RYUKYU ISLANDS
 The Japanese Government
 is moving quickly to carry out
 limited economic and technical
 assistance to the R,yukyus with
 in a framework authorized by
 the US High Commissioner for
 the islands.   This approach,
 conceived by the Kishi govern-
 ment in 1958,                 is Tokyo's attempt
 to resolve the conflict between
 Japanese and Ryukyuan desires
 for reversion of the islands to
 Japan, on the one hand, and
 American retention of full ju-
 risdiction, on the other.
 The Japanese have never
 really diverted their attention
 from the Ryukyuan question since
 a protest vote against US land
 policies resulted in the elec-
 tion of a pro-Communist mayor
 of Naha in late 1956.  Periodi-
 cally,  issues have arisen which
 rekindled Japanese demands for
 greater authority in the Ryukyus.
 Prominent among these was the
 proposed revision by the US
 Civil Administration for the
 Ryukyus (USCAR)   of  the
 Ryukyuan penal code, which
 the Japanese contend is onerous
 rivalry in Africa; without
 specifically mentioning the
 USSR, he affirmed that Com-
 munist China was the most
 effective world leader against
 colonialism and that China a-
 lone should be regarded as
 the savior of the Africans.
 and discriminatory.  There
 have been disputes over per-
 sonal liability claims result-
 ing from the crash of an
 American jet fighter in mid-
 1959.
 Relatively inactive but
 potentially dangerous issues
 include the question of greater
 self-government for the Ryukyus,
 symbolized  principally by  a
 desire for the..popular election
 of the chief  executive;  the
 introduction  of  nuclear
 weapons; the acquisition of
 additional land for missile
 sites; and controls over labor
 organizations, especially those
 including  employees of the
 government and  US  security
 forces.
 The Japanese and Ryukyuan
 governments have been seeking
 the agreement of US officials
 to a US-Japanese-Ryukyuan coun-
 cil which would constitute a
 formal mechanism for handling
 matters of mutual concern.  The
 United  States  however,   has

 Ryukyu Islands (GRI), an in-
 digenous apparatus.; closely
 supervised by USCAR, wants the
 broadest      possible assistance
 from Japan.   It believes, as
 does Tokyo, that the Ryukyus
 must be given a standard of
 education equal to Japan's
 and based on the Japanese
 system.   The GRI points out
 that many of the 6,000 Ryukyuan
 teachers in elementary and high
 schools. were only partially
 trained when they were employed
 at the end of World War II and
 that they remain below par but
 cannot be discharged because of
 tenure rights.
 At GRI initia-
 tive and following
 discussions with
 USCAR officials,  the
 Japanese Government
 last year began an
 in-service teacher-
 training program,

 cation and the Edu-
 cation Ministry
 were sent to the
 Ryukyus for six
 months to give class-
 room demonstrations
 and specialized
 guidance to teachers
 in elementary and
 junior high schools.
 Japan also undertook
 to train 43 Ryukyuan
 teachers in Japan
 for six months.
 The GRI contends that
 the program has been not only
 highly effective, but ex-
 tremely popular; there is, in
 fact, some indication that this
 and other Japanese programs
 have lessened Ryukyuan concern
 that tide United States might
 attempt to annex the islands or
 otherwise detach them completely
 from Japan.
 USCAR initially refused
 to renew the program for 1960
 but relented after Tokyo con-
 tended that the Diet had already
 approved the government's budg-

 cancellation would have serious
 political consequences in Japan.
 The new program is less ambi-
 tious,  and Foreign Minister
 Kosaka has stated that his gov-
 ernment will screen out leftist
 teacher consultants and in-
 struct those approved to avoid
 political statements and activi-
 ties.
 Kosaka has indicated that
 Japan does not contemplate a
 formal educational consultants'
 program in 1961.   Tokyo never.
 theless is seeking USCAR ap-
 proval for a broadened program
 of educational assistance for
 the fiscal year beginning next
 April.   The Education Ministry's
 budget request for this pur-
 pose totals $480,000.
 Included in the draft pro-
 gram are scholarships for
 Ryukyuan students to attend
 Japanese high schools, univer-
 sities,  and medical and dental
 schools; an   exchange of pro-
 fessors between Japan and the
 Ryukyu University;  a summer
 program of in-service training
 for Ryukyuan teachers;  a new
 dormitory near Tokyo especially
 for Ryukyuan students;  and a
 loan fund for students attend-
 ing Ryukyuan'schools.                  Addi-
 tional educational projects
 will probably be listed in the
 budget request.
 Iriomote Development
 A USCAR plan to develop
 the sparsely settled,  heavily
 forested island of Iriomote,
 in the southern Ryukyus,  to en-
 able large numbers of Okinawans
 to resettle there brought forth
 a request by the Kishi govern-
 ment in 1959 to participate in
 the program.   The Japanese were
 permitted to explore the agri-
 cultural and irrigation po-
 tential, and USCAR undertook to
 investigate mineral and fishery
 resources, road and power de-
 velopment,  and the potential
 for land reclamation and com-
 mercial lumbering.   The surveys,
 to which USCAR contributed
 $100,000 and Japan $12,000,
 were completed earlier this year.
 USCAR '3 '  plan'., to  have
 the GRI sell land in Iriomote
 to settlers has created fric-
 tion with Tokyo concerning the
 disposition of public lands--
 in Iriomote as well as else-
 where in the Ryukyus--over which
 the Japanese still claim tech-
 nical ownership.   Tokyo insists
 that the lands be leased, where-
 as USCAR contends that by the 1:9,52
 US-Japanese peace treaty, Japan re-
 linquish jurisdiction' offer their.:
 disposition.   USCAR also points
 out that funds derived from the
 sale or lease of public lands
 are placed in a special account
 which heretofore has been used
 only to maintain Japanese-owned
 buildings and other property in
 the Ryukyus.   The Ikeda govern-
 ment has grudgingly acceded to
 USCAR's plan but has reserved
 its final position.
 Other Programs
 The Japanese Government
 has drafted programs to provide
 pensions to Ryukyuan veterans
 of the World War II Japanese
 Army or their survivors; to ex-
 tend relief to Okinawan victims
 of the war;  and to redeem Japan's
 pre-1945 obligations under the
 nationwide postal savings and
 insurance systems.   These pro-
 grams, which ultimately would
 affect perhaps 400,000 persons--
 almost half the population of
 the islands--will serve to alert
 a broad segment of the Ryukyuan
 people to Tokyo's more active
 interest in their affairs.
 Some aspects of these plans
 may not be completely salutary
 from the Japanese viewpoint.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 For example,  based on pre-1945
 valuations of the Japanese cur-
 rency, the postal redemption
 obligations amount to $82,000,-
 000, but they amount to only
 $229,000 in terms of present
 values.   Because the US dollar
 has replaced the Japanese yen
 as the medium of exchange in
 the Ryukyus,  the settlement
 presumably would represent a
 loss of foreign exchange for
 Japan.   Although a final con-
 version rate is yet to be de-
 cided, Tokyo is inclining
 strongly toward a settlement
 which would average about one
 dollar per claim--a move not
 likely to arouse enthusiasm
 among the claimants.
 Also during 1961, Japan
 contemplates rehabilitating its
 leprosarium facilities,  at an
 estimated cost of perhaps $400,-
 000, to accommodate up to 1,000
 Ryukyuan lepers.   Japanese doc-
 tors also may be sent to re-
 mote Ryukyuan villages at the
 joint expense of the Japanese
 and Ryukyuan governments.   A
 model farm and technical aid
 projects in forestry and fish-
 eries are among other programs
 under consideration.   Total
 Japanese Government assistance
 to the Ryukyus in fiscal 1961
 is tentatively estimated at
 $1,600,000.
 The idea of the islands'
 eventual reversion to Japan is
 widely  endorsed  throughout
 Japan and the Ryukyus, but it
 does not appear to be a burn-
 ing issue at present.   Although
 the Japanese assistance pro-
 grams for the time being prob-
 ably have allayed sentiment in
 Japan for reversion of the is-
 lands, there is some indication
 that Tokyo's quest of a role in
 the Ryukyus, however limited,
 has been greater than is nec-
 essary to accomplish this pur-
 pose.
 The two major Ryukyuan
 political parties,  the conserva-
 tive Okinawa Liberal-Democratic
 party and the middle-of-the-
 road Okinawa Socialist Masses
 party, have appealed to Japan's
 Liberal-Democratic party (LDP)
 and Democratic Socialist party,
 respectively,  for moral and
 material support in the campaign
 for the Ryukyuan legislative
 election in November, but there
 has been little response.   A
 large factor in the attitude
 of the Japanese parties is that
 they themselves are facing gen-
 eral elections in November, but
 in addition the ruling LDP's new
 election platform has eliminated
 the party's previous call for
 speedy return of Japanese admin-
 istrative rights in the Ryukyus
 as well as mention of the US-
 Japanese-Ryukyuan liaison coun-
 cil.
 Japanese leftists,  however,
 appear to be more active on the
 Ryukyuan scene.   The Okinawan
 People's party reportedly is un-
 der the operational guidance
 and control of the Japanese Com-
 munists, who provide it with
 $550 to $600 monthly, On the oth-
 er hand, when Sohyo,  Japan's
 leftist labor federation, made
 a systematic attempt last Jan-
 uary to establish ties with
 Okinawan unions,'the reaction of
 Ryukyuan labor leaders, still pre-
 occupied with internal ;problems,
 was unenthusiastic.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The new Ecuadorean Govern-
 ments informal denunciation of
 the Rio Protocol of 1942, which
 provided for the settlement of
 the Peruvian-Ecuadorean bound-
 ary dispute, has revived bitter
 animosity between the two coun-
 tries and could lead to a series
 of clashes along the frontier.
 Both Peru and Ecuador insist,
 however,  that they have no in-
 tention of resorting to armed
 force except in self-defense.
 Ecuadorean President Velas-
 co, who began his fourth term
 on 1 September, has
 publicly declared--
 both before and since
 his inauguration--that
 the Rio Protocol is
 null and void.  For-

 The extreme position taken

 History of the Dispute
 The dispute concerns por-

 an unpopulated and economically
 unimportant area--and dates from
 the early 19th century when Ecua-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 arbitration by the King of
 Spain in 1887 was the one
 serious attempt at settlement
 prior to 1942, but the award
 was deferred for several years
 and was never implemented be-
 cause of Ecuador's violent ob-
 jection to the decision.   The
 territorial division tentative-
 ly allowed followed lines simi-
 lar to the demarcation set forth
 in the Rio Protocol of 1942,
 which was highly favorable to
 Peru's claims,
 Various efforts subsequent
 to 1887 failed to achieve a
 settlement,  and there were
 sporadic border clashes which
 in 1941 expanded into a short,
 undeclared war.   Peru, which
 had superior armed forces,  in-
 vaded Ecuador and was occupy-
 ing two of its southern prov-
 inces:  at the time hostilities
 were suspended later in the
 year.
 At the American foreign
 mi.niste?s' meeting in Rio de
 Janerio in January 1942,the
 "Protocol of Peace, Friendship,
 and Boundaries" was signed
 providing for the withdrawal
 of Peruvian troops from Ecuador
 and outlining the general bound-
 ary demarcation.   The United
 States,  Brazil, Argentina,
 and Chile, which persuaded the
 warring nations to reach a
 settlement and were signatories
 along with the disputants, be-
 came the guarantor powers of
 the treaty, agreeing to assist
 in implementing its provisions
 until "a definitive demarcation
 of frontiers between Ecuador
 and Peru has been completed."
 A mixed boundary commis-
 sion proceeded to carry out the
 demarcation,  and by 1947 only
 about 60 miles in two zones
 remained undelineated:   the
 small and noncritical Lagarto-
 cocha segment in the extreme
 northeastern part of Ecuador
 and the sector between the
 Santiago and Zamora rivers in
 the southeast, which still has
 a strip of about 50 miles with-
 out boundary markers and is the
 real focus of conflict.
 These two areas were subject
 to arbitral award by the noted
 Brazilian geographer Braz Diaz
 de Aguiar--whose decisions have
 been partly or wholly contested
 by Ecuador on grounds of sub-
 sequently discovered geographi-
 cal information.   The demarca-
 tion of the Santiago-Zamora
 sector, which the Rio Protocol
 delineated by the watershed,
 has been complicated by the
 existence of a second watershed
 revealed by a US aerial survey
 in 1946, a discovery on which
 Ecuador has based its refusal
 to proceed with the final de-
 marcation.
 Issues at Stake
 Ecuador's legal position
 until recently was premised
 essentially on the inapplicabil-
 ity of the provision governing
 the Santiago-Zamora sector be-
 cause of the existence of two
 watersheds instead of one.
 Ecuador had not overtly chal-
 lenged the validity of the
 treaty, although it frequently
 asserted that the division of
 territory was inequitable.   Its
 real motive has been to block
 final demarcation in order to
 gain eventual territorial con-
 cessions from Peru.   It partic-
 u.lar:ly,, wants direct access
 to the Amazon River via the
 Maranon River--which would re-
 quire at least a broad revision
 of the protocol.
 Ecuador's most convincing
 argument is that the protocol
 was signed under duress when
 two of its provinces were oc-
 cupied by Peruvian troops--
 "with a knife at our throats;'
 as Ecuadorean politicians claim
 --and that it was highly favor-
 able to Peru.   Ecuadorean
 leaders insist that their na-
 tion's "soul" is tied to the
 Amazon, and their claims can-
 not be renounced.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 13 October 1960
 Peru's equally inflexible
 position is essentially that
 the Rio Protocol is a valid in-
 ternational agreement; that the
 discovery of the second water-
 shed in the Santiago-Zamoro
 sector does not affect the
 boundary at all or the undemar-
 cated sector in any material
 way; that the Diaz de Aguiar
 awards are binding and must be
 accepted by both parties; and
 that the boundary commission
 should proceed with demarcation
 of the final disputed sector.
 Peru believes that Ecuador's
 position is a legalistic ruse
 to abrogate or substantially
 alter the protocol and gain
 direct access to the Amazon
 River.
 A number of suggestions
 for overcoming the present im-
 passe  have received some con-
 sideration by the guarantor
 powers or by the disputants
 themselves.   These suggestions
 --which include aerial survey
 of the Santiago-Zamora zone,
 arbitration, submission of the
 issue to the International
 Court of Justice, and improve-
 ment of bilateral relations--
 seem, if anything, to have in-
 tensified the mutual suspicions
 of Peru and Ecuador,
 Political Considerations
 Any cool, rational ap-
 proach to a settlement seems
 virtually impossible.   The
 frontier question arouses
 nationalistic sentiments among
 all politically articulate
 groups in both countries.   In-
 termittent border clashes since
 1942 have deepened the hatreds
 in each country, and the press
 and politicians on both sides
 have consistently taken a
 chauvinistic stand on the issue.
 The political careers of
 the two incumbent )Presidents
 are intimately connected with
 the dispute.   Velasco was in
 exile from Ecuador at the time
 the protocol was signed,and
 later overthrew the government
 which was the signatory.   Dema-
 gogic by nature and quick to
 exploit any issue to promote
 his personal popularity and
 mass appeal, he now seems bent
 on making his niche in history
 as the renouncer of the Rio Pro-
 tocol and, ipso facto, Ecuador's
 modern hero.
 Peru's Prado, on the other
 hand, was serving his first
 term as President when the war
 broke out with Ecuador in 1941
 and is unlikely to entertain
 any proposed modification of
 his country's stand, particular-
 ly in view of Peru's superior
 armed forces and Velasco's in-
 formal denunciation of the pro-
 tocol.  Highly incensed by
 Velasco's position, he recently
 advised US Charge Neal that he
 blames the United States for
 blocking a joint declaration by
 the guarantor powers reaffirm-
 ing the validity of the proto-
 col, and he categorically stated
 that Peru had no intention of
 attending the Quito conference
 under present circumstances.
 The Outlook
 The sentiment in each coun-
 try is so explosive on the prob-
 lem that the granting of even a
 minor concession by either govern-
 ment to promote a settlement
 would probably threaten its
 stability.  All guarantor powers
 have displayed grave concern
 over the latest Ecuadorean po-
 sition on the treaty and are
 attempting to prevent a formal
 repudiation; some other Latin
 American countries have also
 expressed their concern.
 With virtually no prospect
 for any constructive progress
 on the dispute, the outlook for
 the OAS conference in Quito is
 clouded.  Latin American Com-
 munists, in line with their
 continuing efforts to under-
 mine the prestige and effective-
 ness of the OAS, were making
 plans to disrupt the inter-Amer-
 ican conference in 1960, and
 will probably attempt to sur-
 round the meeting in 1961 with
 an atmosphere of violence by
 exploiting Ecuadorean national-
 ist feelings on the boundary
 dispute,
