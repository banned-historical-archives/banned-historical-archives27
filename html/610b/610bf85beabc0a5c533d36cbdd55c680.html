of the:peace "Crusade of the peoples democratic countries headed' 
by the USSR," Father Buchta wrote. 
-"That is Why they do not hesitate to commit the unheard-of: 
sin in Korea, to destroy the happiness and lives of innocent people, 
also our brothers and sisters, only for their selfish and profit-
seeking interests. 
"1 conderim the American campaign against the freedom of the, 
Korean people, I condemn the.godless plans of so-called Western

No priest could remain indifferent or passive when evil people 
were tryina to unleash the third world war of the century, FethJr 
Buchta added.

priests and faithful take an active pert in the world struggle for 
the preservation of 'apace. I promise that I shall not only pray for 
peace but shall also work for it."

"Postal employes, who have in their hands the telephone and 
telegraph, the radio and mail transport, must know how to express

refused to unload arms and other war material in the knowledge 
that these weapons are aimed against them and their most vital

In a statement given to the Press tonight, the former head 
of the American gift parcels mission to this country criticised 
American policy whichhe called "the war policy of the criminal 
rulers of the United States." He condemned American intervention 
in Korea and .praised the economic and social conditions in this 
country which he said contrasted sharply with conditions in the 
United States. 
"I cannot cpntinue delivering American -parcels while American 
pirplaneS bomb the peaceloving Korean people,"Mr.Lass declared. 
oannot remain in the services of people who, I am convinced, 
are preparing death and destruction for the whole world. I do not 
want to become an instrument of a policy which, under the cloak 
of aid,is trying to conceal its brutal crimes in Korea,Formosa, 
Vietnam and in the Philippines." 
Saying that he had been offered the post of CARE Director 
in Israel, more responsible and better paid than the Prague 
post, Mr.Lass added: "They will not succeed in turning me from 
what T consider to be the duty of every honest American and 
every honest person in the world:from contributing with all my 
strength to the defence of world peace. 
"That is why I am giving up my post in CARE. I want to do 
everything in my power to help unmask and fight against the war 
policy of the present criminal rulers of the USA. I am firmly 
convinced that by doing so I am best expressing the feelings of 
decent people in the United States and am best serving the in-
terests of the American people in general, as well as the cause 
of progress and world peace." 
Mr.Lass opened his statement by referrtag to Korea. "As an 
American citizen, I want to express my indignation at the crimi-
nal attack of American imperialists in Korea," he said. "These 
base crimes against humanity are being committed in the name of 
the American people at the orders of a handful of enemies of peace.

"I am in a country in ./hich I can raise my voice as an honest 
erican citizen without fear of persecution, in a country in 
which the defence of peace is not considered a crime but the duty 
of every single perSon. IT therefore add my voice to the protest 
of hundreds of millions fighters for peace against the criminal 
attack of American warmongers in Korea." 
It was beginning to be as dangerous to be suspected of demo-
cratic views in the United States today as it had been in Germany 
under Hitler, the former CAPE Director went on. 
"People fighting against the obvious instalment of fascism 
or showing their disagreement with the war policy of the imperial-
ists are being thrown into gaol," he said, adding that these fasc-
ist methods were intended to make the American people the first 
victim of-the American policy of world domination. 
"They are to preVent the American people from learning the 
truth about other countries in which there is no exploitation Of 
man bY man and in which a 'peace loving and happy life has become 
reality," the statement continues. 
"This reality I saw in Czechoslelrakia; Vull employment, free 
medical care for all, education for all, the constantly rising 
living standards, social insurance for every worker, thousands of 
nursery schools for small children," Mr.Lass writes. 
He contrasts this with conditions in New York slums and Negro 
quarters in which he worked as a social worker before and during 
the last war. "In all those year I saw tens of thousands of 
human wrecks for whom America had neither schools nor work, broad 
or housing," 
Juvenile delinquency was "one of the most ch,3xacteristic 
aspects of the American way of life", Mr.Lass said. One in two

orders and one in every for American marria,ses ended in divorce,

"TLe difference between the Amorican way of life and my ex-

tions approved and supported by the present criminal rulers of th-i

The main purpose of CARE parcels was not to help the ncedv 
but to spread the lie about the American "paradise", Mr.Loss adds, 
emphasising that among the member Elegieties of CARE were organi-

The people of the Philippines want to free themselves from 
American domination and are determined to fight for their free?
dom, "M 1ada Fronts." writes today. 
Giving a short account of the history of the Philippines ,the 
youth paper says that the independence granted them in 1946 had 
become a farce. The aconomid situation was critical and the Phi?
lippines were one of the countries with the largest deficit in 
trade With the United States, 
"The Philippine Quirino and his regime plays a special role 
in American plans and calculations," "Mlada Fronta" emphasises. 
The-Philippines were to be a bait with which the Americans wished 
to win over other Asian peoples and were, furtbermoro, to be?
?cane the centre of a Pacific equivalent of tha North Atlantic 
Pamt "which would tie the shaky 0,arts of the 4mperia1ists ? the 
Philippines, Australia, Malaya, Burma, Indonesia, India and of 
course also MacArthur's Japan ? still closer to the American team,? 
The Americans had, howeverltmiscalculated, the paper adds. 
"They are not good mathematicians, as they have shown to the world 
in China, as they are just now showing in Korea, and as they will 
find out one of these days also in the Philippines."

Karlovy Vary, July 28th 
Introducing the American film "Strange Victory" at the late: 
national 
national Film Festival here yesterday /see our Bulletin No.2. 
today/9 the progretsive journalist David Platt described the 
film aS the most progressive one to be mode in America in the

of the Hollywood screen writer John Howard Lawson. 
Was this well-known writer imprisoned by the US Government 
for producing brutal films, or films inciting to racial hatred. 
and war? David Platt askod. 
"Not at all. Tho Crime for which ho was sentenced is thyt

"John Howard Lawson would not be in prison today if he had 
bowed before Parnell Thomas / Un-American Activities Committee 
Chairman/ and if he had consented to produce films teaching people 
how to hate the USSR. But Mr.Lawson, who always believed that a 
writer had a special responsibility to serve democracy and to 
furthe3r the free exchange of ideas, has preferred prison to the 
production of films which woald be controlled by our Gestapo." 
One of the "crimes" for which Lawson .had boon sentence a was 
that in 1938 he wrote the screenplay for the anti-Franco IIIm 
"Blockade", the first and only. Hollywood picture dealing with the 
abolishment of freedom in Spain. "If Mr.Lawson had placed his 
talents at the service of the. enemy - as many Hollywood. writers 
did - if he had written a film sympathisiree with the Franco regime 
and had lauded this murderer of women and children, I am sure he 
would no-CIA in gaol today," Mr.Platt declared. 
Another of Mr.Lawson s "crimes" was his scenario for the anti-
fascist film- "Action in the North Atlantic", the first Hollywood' 
film sympatetically'to depict the trade unions. Had Mr.Lawson 
described the trade anions as a vice den, had he made an agent 
provocateur the hero of his picture, he would hot today be on the 
black list and in gaol, Mr.Platt continued. 
Has any Western Writer attackinp the Communists and trade 
unions ever been put in gaol? Such sentences are reserved only 
for those writers who protect the workers interests and who fight 
a7ainst films with a fascist tendency," he added. 
In 1944 John Howard Lawson had committed_another "crime" by 
writing the screenplay for the outstanding anti-fascist film 
"Sahara" giving the picture of a brave 7egre soldier. 
"Had Mr.Lawson shown that a white Nazi is a better man than 
a black democrat, had he not violated the Uncle Tom tradition, 
he would not have been sentenced for un-American activity. In the

Last but not least, Mr.Lawson hod written the scenario for 
the war film "Countcr Attack" which hri a friendly attitude to 
the Soviet ally. This was a furthor crime for which Lawson was now 
being punished. 
"When writrs and artists ore ? being sentenced for their creed 
the nation starts on the road towards fscism", David Platt said 
in conclusion. "Nevertheless I am confident that the American 
people, with its democratic tradition of Thomas Jefferson, Abraham 
Lincoln, Andrew Jacksonand Franklin. Roosevelt, will reject the-
. 
policy of a police State. The Americai. people has in its history

Prague, July 29th 
Czechoslovak creative artists have replied to an open letter 
of their Soviet colleagues by assuring them that they will work 
for the prevention of a new world war. 
"The loathsome and base actions of imperialist mercenaries 
in the beautiful land of freedom,- the land of the peaceloving 
and creative Korean people - are a new proof of the great decay 
and inhumanity of the imperialist word," the artists said in their 
letter. 
"At this time, when imperialist bombers are dropping death 
on unarmed civilians in Korea, no singfe honest artist can approach 
his creative work without the feeling of profound indignat,ioi_ and 
hatred towards those destroying all that is human and progressive, 
without the feeling of the great responsibility of the creative 
artist for the victory of lasting peace throughout the world. 
"We assure you," the letter to the Soviet artists concludes, 
"that we shall exert all our ability towards preventing a new 
World bloodshed and towards showing in truthful works of art that 
the world's,future bel.ongs to honourable and diligent people, 
people with love and firm faith in world peace in their hearts."

PRESS REVIEW No. 160. 
The main subject of the Press .eontinUes to be the successful 
harvest, details of which in various areas of the country are given front-
-page prominence. 
Re-Militarization of Western Germany. 
Under the heading "Official Re-Militarization", "Likve_UoviDy" 
writes that Western Germany is being systematically transformed into an 
arsenal for war material and the workshop of a new war. Plans for the re-
-militarization of the Western zones of Germany were approved in March this 
year at a meeting of Ministers of the 12 countries of the Atlantic Pact, 
The Western imperialists are devoting 4,550m. marks solely to preparations 
for war. The occupation authorities are re-assaL4ling HITLER's army in 
various military formations with innocent names, and are arming them with 
American tanks and equipment. Mr. MCCLOY is requesting HITLER's generals 
to work out a plan for a "federal police" as a substantial element of the 
West German army. 
The conference, in Stuttgart, of the occupation Powers worked out 
directives for recruiting military pilots, who will be selected in accordance 
with a list compiled by the American espionage service. The conference was 
attended by members of the Fascist-militarist organization IlEuderschaft, the 
chief "trainer" of which is General MANTEUFEL. A drill-ground ra, the West 
German army has been Laid out between Augsburg and Munieh and at Ldneburg, 
where drill will be directed by officers of the Western Powers. The con-
ference decided that the preparatory work in this connexion should be strict-
ly secret, but that recruiting should be public. The Germans present were 
requested to swear that they would preserve absolute silence on all that had 
been discussed at the meeting. 
Korea. 
Several papers to-day contain a Czechoslovak Press Agency report 
from North Korea stating that American troops and "the hordes of SYNGMAN 
RBEE" are now resorting to the methods of HITLER's gangs, and are carrying 
out the mass murder of the population during their retreat and the senseless 
destruction of towns and villages in order to postpone for a while their com-
plete defeat. 
The report then mentions. the names of places such as Sotshen, 
Nekwan, and Ohirye which the American troops have allegedly razed to the ground. 
/From Lidolil Novi./ 
It is reported from Delhi that "the progressive paper 'Crossroads" 
has published an open letter to the Indian Parliament reminding it, on the 
occasion of its debate on foreign policy, of its responsibility in the ques-
tion of Korea, and exhorting it to support the standpoint of Mr. STALIN.

that the meting was called by the United States, which demanded that all 
member countries should increase their war budgets. The report also asserts 
that hr. BEVIN promised to devote an extra 2100m. to military expenditure, 
and M. SCHUMAN 18,000m. francs. 
The report continues by stating that the Council of Europe met 
in Strasbourg yesterday, this meeting being merely a continuation of the 
Hague discussions on the speeding up of rearmament and the arming of Western 
Germany. The aggressively military character of the meeting is emphasized by 
the presence of Mr. Winston CHURCHILL, 
English Bishops and the Stockholm Resolution.

Writing in "Rude Pravo" on the large number of signatures all 
over the world gained for the Er5ckholm "peace resolution", hr. Mislay 
tULO states that it has been signed by many priests and ministers of re-
ligion, such as the Abb?OULIER and the Protestant bishops of England. 
Malaya. 
The Czechoslovak Press Agency reports from Singapore that the 
colonial administration in Malaya has published an official communique ad-
mitting that 63 members of the "national liberation movement" who were 
taken prisoner have been executed. The report also states that 546 British 
and colonial soldiers, pilots, and police have been killed in Malaya, and 
133 wounded. "As is known," concludes the Agency, "the British Labour 
Government has been waging a criminal war against the Malayan people for 
over two years."

Fascism in England. 
Under the heading "Fascism in England is not Asleep", "Mad6 
Fronta" writes that [Ater the War, England was perhaps the only country, 
MR-Ihe exception of Spain, where the Fascist Party was officially per-
mitted. Sir Oswald MOSLEY's party was in no way hindered in its Fascist 
propaganda and adniration of HITLER and his policy. The British authori-
ties explained their procedure by saying that this party was a small and 
harmless group which should be allowed "freedom of thought". Only recently 
this "harmless group" attempted to carry out gross provocation in front of 
the Soviet Embassy in London. It is significant that not even in this case 
did the British police take the necessary steps. 
Anti-State Group Caught. 
Nr. JiI TUNEL writes in 'Mad& Fronta" that not long ago two 
men who were behaving suspiciously in-77-rilonTrer area of Czechoslovakia 
near the 'Western zones of Germany were arrested by the S.N.B. /security 
police/ and found to be equipped with revolvers, cameras, and so on. It 
was found that one of them had been sent into Czechoslovakia by the American 
C.I.C. to disable an important electricity works. The arrest of those two 
men led to the discovery and trial of a group of 36 persons who were plot-
ting against the Republic.

Soviet Actress's Letter to Czechs. 'F?E's?ritferE4) 
certain amount of prominence is given by "LiapyLlIalny" and 
other papers to-day to a letter addressed by MMe S.V. GIACINTOVA, an actress 
and National Artiste of the U.S,S.R., to the artistes of Czechoslovakia, ex-
pressing the inexpressible happiness she feels when she sees how they /the 
Czechoslovak artistes/ are fighting for peace. The letter attacks the United 
States for its preparations for chemical and atomic warfare, and its "impudent 
invasion of Korea", and states, in violent language that lasts for two-thirds 
of the letter, that "the Lmurican bandits desire to make use of the experience 
of the Japanese murderers" in the last War, that they want to disseminate 
cholera, typhoid, the plague, and other diseases, that they have already 
started experimenting on the Eskimos in Canada, that they are protecting 
the Emperor HIROHITO and General ISSI, etcetera. 
Music For The Aim.. 
Mr. Miroslav 13,',RVIK, secretary of the Union of Czechoslovak Com-
posers, makes a plea in "Lickvd_NoyLny" for more marches and songs for the 
army, and writes that "it is an honour for us progressive composers if we 
can greet, in the name of the people, GOTTWALD, MAO TSE-TUNG, KIM IR-SEN, 
and STALIN, the lariors and partisans of Korea, the heroes of China and 
Viet Nam, the workers of France and Italy, and the partisans of Greece". 
The slogan of all Czechoslovak composers to-day must be: "Composers, write 
for the army". 
"14dovii Demokracie" reports that the VIA Nejedl Army Ensemble 
has appealed to al Czechoslovak composers to write for the army. Among the 
works that have already been written by young composers are "Song of Cottwald" 
by M. SEDMIDUBSKY; "Glory to the Tanks", by R. DREJSL; "Parachutist" Sym-

The Voice of America 
25X1A 
-s-micrav 
The millionaires' press of the United States seeks to create in the 
minds of its American as well as foreign readers a certain picture of 
"America" and "the American people". It would be unwise to dispose of this 
picture as a fabrication, when we think of the considerable influence of 
that press and the great political and economic power of its milers and 
business friends. But it would be equally unwise to aocept this pioturo as 
complete; for there is yet another kind of information which one may think 
less depressing. It may be found in such periodicals as the "Co-operative 
Consumer"in Kansas City, Missouri, which quotes from various publications 
127577ame kind published either in the United States or in Canada. 
Tho author of the article, Lt.-Comdr. Edgar P.YOUNG, R.N., then fea-
tures two of these quotations, namely from the "Rural 0o-0 ratoepublished 
in Toronto and from the "Southern Farmer" which appears in Montgomery, 
Alabama. 
The first of these answers the question whether Canada would willing-
ly go to war against the U.S.S.R. and the people's democracies (which is 
answered in a strong affirmative by the millionaires' press), as follows; 
"We believe that it is neoessary to preserve peace almost at any 
cost. We believe that in our time peace cannot be achieved without a cer??? 
tam n price; since the prospects of another war are becoming still more ter-
rifying, we believe that even a very stoop price to be paid for peace is 
worth considering." 
"It is hard to believe that the political blood-hounds of Washington 
would earnestly desire peace, if we judge them by their deeds of recent 
weeks. Hysterical slanders and furious threats coupled with the silly fsbia 
and tired nerves represent a real threat to peace." 
"With few exceptions, the Americans have never shown any impressive 
political and diplomatic, abilities, but their behaviour on the opening of 
the H-bomb race would easily cost than their prestige and confidence - if 
they ever had any - in world affairs." 
"If We must have atomic and hydrogen bombs, we must also have capa-
ble statesmen who, would guarantee the troubled world that everything pos-
sible would be done so that these bombs are never used. Men of goodwill 
and common sense are on both sides. The hope of the world depends on whether 
these men will be given the chance to secure permanent peace or whether they 
will be thrust aside by noisy, hysterical boasters who cause all the unrest 
of the present time." 
Lt.-Comdr. Edgar P.YOUNG, LEE, then quotes from the "Southern Farm-
er": "In the unsettled months following the Fasoist and Nazi defearWe 
Tr'ought that politicians who talked about our country having been turned 
over to the Communists were talking propaganda. I still think that thisis 
the case." 
"But there is the AINDT-FLRGUSON-JOHNSON Bill which must not be 
taken light-heartedly. This law wants to outlaw QOMMUDiSM and the Commu-
nists and it wants to establish a police state in Amerioa. It gives the 
FBI directives and full payers to spy on the trend of thought and talk in 
this country." 
"If this over became law, a person could be imprisoned for having 
said that ho did not wish war against the Soviet Union, or that the U.S. 
should not produce the H-bomb, or that the U.S. should recognize the pres-
ent Chinese Government, or if he suggested that farmers should form a co-
operative." 
"You could be imprisoned for anything you may have said, if an agent 
of the secret police found out that the Russians had said something of the

E.P.YOUNG concludes by expressing his hope that the Editor of the 
"22:2perative Consumer" is not going to be prosecuted and oonvioted of 
non-Ame2rean7KAIREIes" once these views of "the other America" have ap-
peared in the press outside America.

American Automobile Factories 
A Soviet engineer, Vasili BARYKIN, describes his experiences from 
his post-war visit to the U.S. and its automobile factories. He begins by 
emphasizing that the American man in the street does not think of war 
against the U.S.S.R. and recognizes the importance of Soviet World War II 
victories for the United States. 
As for the motor industry, BARYKIN says that in the organization of 
production Soviet factories, notably the MOLOTOV works, are far more ad-
vanced than their American opposites. In America workers do not submit im-
provement proposals nor do highly qualified workers teach their comrades as 
in the Soviet Union; this is because they fear that they would be dis-
charged if more workers know their job. B1RYK1N found no schools attaehed 
to U.S. automobile factories in which the workers could improve their qual-
ifications. On the other hand, American workers fear the future because they 
are afraid of unemployment. This fear causesincreasing prostitution and hin-
ders workers having families. Medical care for workers on the Soviet scale 
is unknown in the U.S. There are no works clubs or libraries, and the cine-
ma is the only sort of entertainment available to the working man. BLRYKIN 
concludes his article by referring to the discrepancy between prices of 
foodstuffs and workerst wages and says that recreation is unattainable to 
an American worker, but he must not fall ill or else he would be dis-
charged and left without any kind of support and his family would die of 
hunger.

"La Beaute du Diable" 
CLAIRts "La Beaute du Diable", a satire on GOETHEts "Faust" affords 
much room for thought. Reno CLAIR is a splendid, talented artist who in the 
past created a number of works inspired with love for the French common man, 
giving him joy and optimistic laughter. But in "La Beaute du Diable" we see 
another CL AIR who takes the great work which is progressive by its endeavour 
to conquer the truth, for a chance to make intellectual jokes and to bring 
into play -mostly for its awn sake - all the producer's mastery as well as 
to show two really exceptional artistic performances (by Gerard PHILIPPE 
and Michel SIMONE). But even in this method of elaboration of the Faust 
theme which ho realizes with a considerable mount of questionable daring, 
he comes up against problems which must now be clearly and uncompromising-
ly answered. And at this point CLLIR hints - the question remains whether 
deliberately or instinctively - that even to him imperialist attempts to 
misuse science for aims of mass murder are not a matter of indifference, 
but a moment later he envelopes the answer in a smoke-screen, avoids the 
issue and in a trivial conclusion blunts the point of a favourable expla-
nation of his work.

It must be said about OLLIR as well as about the other masters of 
itern films that their past is better than their present work, and that 
al world expects of them works in whioh they would plaeo their art at the 
rvioe of man and his struggle for the ralization of great ideals, ono of 
- - which is to liberate science from financial interests and put it at the 
service of the people, as is the case in countries ruled by the people. 
Non-committal, unclear answers like that of CLAIR in "LA Beaute 
du Diable" aro nowadays by far not enough. An artist who does not see his 
full responsibility in those decisive moments, will boom? a lackey of im-
perialism tomorrow and will end up on the dust-heap. OLLIR and Western art-
ists of his kind whom we esteem for their work, deserve a better fate. We 
trust that they do and that they are going to create works which the work-
A ng people expect of them.
