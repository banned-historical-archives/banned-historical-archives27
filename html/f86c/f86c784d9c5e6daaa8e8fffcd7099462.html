 ICM AND "SOCIALIST CAMP" AFFAIRS
 5 July-1 August 1966
 1.   The Warsaw Pact and CEMA "summit" meetings in Bucharest last only 3 days
 and 1 day, respectively, with no  significant new moves or agreements thus
 far revealed. The former produces a hard-sounding statement on Vietnam, and
 a lengthy, 7-point declaration on European security, further developing
 earlier Soviet pronouncements on the subject.   The communique of the latter
 does not indicate Soviet progress toward greater integration, but rather
 talks of the coordination of national plans and "collaboration in accordance
 with the principles of complete equality in rights, respect for sovereignt
 and national integrity-," etc.                                                50X1-HUM
 the decisions were made in advance at the Moscow foreign minis-  50X1-HUM
 ters' meeting (which stretched from an anticipated 3 days to 11, see #3),     50X1-HUM
 and       the Rumanians successfully led the opposition`to Soviet efforts to
 strengthen and tighten both  alignments.
 2.   Sino-Soviet polemics flare anew as the Chinese goad the Soviets into
 counter-attacks over the, issue of escalated U.S. bombings in N. Vietnam.
 Each accuses the other of serving the U.S. imperialists by its conduct.   The
 Chinese also lash out at the Soviets on a number of other matters and occa-
 sions (as well as at the non-Communist Indonesian, Indian, Japanese and
 Dutch Governments); -- see below.
 INTERNATIONAL FRONT ORGANIZATIONS
 3.   The Peking "Afro-Asian Writers' emergency meeting on Vietnam" stretches
 3 days beyond schedule (see #3), and many delegates are reported touring
 and meeting throughout China afterwards.   Its communique and 37 resolutions
 on various A-A "anti-imperialist. struggles" reflect the Chinese line, -- but
 they do not specifically mention the Soviets (in contrast to harsh'anti-
 Soviet attacks by the Chinese and some of their closest allies in speeches
 during the sessions), or even mention Cairo as the site of the condemned
 "splittist meeting" of the rival group!   TANYUG's Peking correspondent ex-
 plains this restraint as due to the refusal of the North Vietnam and NLFSV
 representatives to accept any accusations directed against the Soviet Union
 and other "socialist countries."  NCNA publicizes a statement attributed to
 5 "delegations" from Africa to the meeting which denounces 6 Cairo-based
 "African organizations" as "bogus revolutionary organizations ... tools of
 the ... foreign policy of the Soviet Government."  The Ghanaian Embassy in
 Peking protests the meeting's resolution on Ghana.   (Details in Chronology)

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/06/28: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400010002-6
 4.   A TASS statement on a 10-day Cairo meeting of the Executive Committee
 of the International Union of Students (IUS) reveals no disagreements, -- but
 does not mention the long-postponed 9th World Youth Festival.  A long NCNA
 account more than a week later describes a violent struggle between the
 Chinese -- and Soviet-aligned factions.   (Details in Chrono, July 20 and 29.)
 5. See under China for Peking's "1966 summer physics colloquium of the
 Peking Symposium" -- not truly an "international front," though the Chinese
 are obviously trying to build it up as such.
 6. The rival Chinese-line and Soviet-line "World Conferences Against Atomic
 and Hydrogen Bombs" are scheduled to be held in Japan in August:   see under
 China for Chinese reaction to Japan's banning of the Chinese delegation chief.
 SOVIET AFFAIRS
 7.   A week-long visit by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko to Japan brings
 agreement on a consular convention and on a Japanese role in develo in
 g
 Sib-
 erian resources  -- and blistering Chinese attacks.   (July 24-30)
 8.   Duputy Premier Polyansky achieves agreement in Canada on reciprocal
 direct air fli hts, the first direct air link between the USSR and North
 America.   (July 11)
 9.   Moscow is host to a procession of top-level visitors from the non-
 Communist world: India's Gandhi, Britain's Wilson, the UN's U Thant, and
 Iraq's Al-Bazza.   The Soviets manage to draw Mrs. Gandhi one step closer to
 their views on Vietnam and to have U Thant relay scare propaganda on the
 .dire consequences of U.S. "escalation."   (July 12-August 1)
 10. French CP GenSecy Rochet visits Brezhnev,     they reaffirm complete
 unity.   (July 15)
 13. U.S. analysts see in the Soviet-announced figures for plan fulfillment
 in the first half of 1966 no improvement over the unsatisfactory performance
 of the soviet economy in recent years.   "A decline in the rate of
 principal civilian uses of
 h
 mac
 inery seems to suggest a further increase in
 the share of durable
 d
 s
 evoted to military and space programs."

 COMMUNIST CHINA
 14. The Party's "cultural revolution" sweeps on, with Chen Po-ta identi-
 fied as "leader of the group in charge."  Lu Ting-yi, the Party's propa-
 ganda chief and one of Mao's closest associates since the Yenan days, be-
 comes the second (after Peng Chen) purge victim at the Politburo .level.
 Lu's removal is known through identification of Tao Chu as his successor.
 And Lo Jui-ching's long-suspected ouster from Army Chief of Staff position
 is confirmed by identification of Yang Cheng-wu as Acting Chief.  Mean
 while, the elusive Mao not only surfaces but swims!   (See details in
 Chrono.)
 15. Peking holds a 9-day "1966 summer physics colloquium of the Peking
 Symposium," -- attended, according to the communique, by "l4 scientists
 from 33 countries and regional institutions in Asia, Africa, Latin Ameri-
 ca, and Oceania."  Although Peking boasts in general terms of scientific
 gains, published reporting indicates that it is heavily loaded with the
 Chinese political line.   (July 23-31)
 16? Liberation Army Daily viciously attacks Sholokhov's(Khrushchev-favored)
 novel The Fate of Man.   Reprinted in all Peking papers, it denounces those
 who "exaggerate the terror and misery of war" and preach "the philosophy
 of survival."  "A true fighter considers it shameful to be taken prisoner
 ... would rather die standing than live kneeling."  "Of course, in wars
 ... some 'pots and pans' are bound to be broken and sacrifices made.   But
 these are completely justifiable, and worth while...."   (July 13)
 17. Peking continues its running attacks on
 implicating Americans and"the Chiang Kai-shek gang  in the "anti-Chinese
 outrages" in I.   (Details in Chrono)
 18. The Chinese Government heavily attacks the Netherlands Government in
 connection with the mysterious case of a Chinese engineer attending a
 welding conference in The Hague.   He was seriously injured jumping from
 the house where he was quartered, taken by the Dutch to a hospital, ab-
 ducted from the hospital by the Chinese, and died in their hands.  The
 Chinese blame it all on "secret U.S, agents, with the connivance of the
 Dutch Govt.'!.", The Dutch expel the Chinese Charge d'Affaires, and the
 Chinese reciprocate, keeping the Dutch charge as "hostage" for the other
 Chinese engineers, wanted by the Dutch police as witnesses.
 (July 19-22)
 19. Reacting to Japan's denial of an entrance permit for Liu Ning-yi,
 head of the Chinese delegation to the "12th World Conference Against
 Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs," the Chinese lash out at the "grand joint anti-
 China performance by U.S. imperialism, Japanese militarism, and the Soviet
 revisionist clique."   (July 26-28)
 20. Peking again blasts India, this time (together with the Soviets) in
 connection with Mrs. Gandhi's Moscow visit.   (July 26)   On August 1,
 Delhi releases an official protest note revealing that Chinese troops

 along the Sikkim border have been "making propaganda broadcasts through
 loudspeakers" to Indian forces urging rebellion.
 21. A Chicom diplomat defects to the U.S. from the Embassy in Damascus.
 (July 29)
 22. Hanoi creates a "Committee to Investigate the War Crimes of the U.S.
 Imperialists in Vietnam  and issues a memorandum on "the new criminal
 U.S. steps in the escalation of the war in N. Vietnam; 31 January-15 July
 1966.'''  T1   NLFSV issues a new "black paper on-the crimes of the American
 aggressors and their satellites in S. Vietnam."   (July 22-23)
 23. American Marine/ARVN troops just south of the Demilitarized Zone cap-
 ture documents and weapons which reveal that they are fighting the North
 Vietnamese 324th Division recently arrived via the DMZ and being supplied
 with food directly from North Vietnam, -- and that the Division brought
 new tes of Soviet and Chinese weapons which have never before fallen into
 American hands.   (Secret)
 YUGOSLAVIA
 24. The  Yugoslav Party and police purge and reorganization proceed with
 limited publicity.  Moderate former Foreign Minister Koca Popovic is
 elected to replace Rankovic as Vice President; several provincial security
 police chiefs are ousted.
 25. The Albanians make the most of Yugoslavian developments:   in admit-
 ting the secret police abuses, the Tito clique is telling the truth for
 the first time,but is is only a tiny morsel of the truth.  Actually, as
 "the great Stalin said 20 years ago" and as the Albanians have been say-
 ing ever since, "Yugoslavia is a terrorist police state, a ferocious
 dictatorship" where "there is only one power, the UDB" which has drenched
 its road with "the blood of thousands and tens of thousands of workers
 and peasants killed without trial," etc.   (July-71-9772-17
 26. Another editorial denouncing the K revisionists of Eastern Europe for
 wanting to build "bridges" with imperialism strikes a telling note when
 it adds that "each wants its 'bridge' to be its own, so as to be able to
 cross it without the permission of Moscow!"   (July 8)
 27. An Albanian Party plenum decides to convene its 5th Con ress on
 November 1 (more than a year late according to the statutes).   (July 14)

 "Observers here believe that such a tenor was imparted to
 these documents only by the representatives of South and North
 Vietnam, who unmistakably showed in their speeches that 1,heey
 could not accept accusations against the Soviet Union and other
 socialist countries...."
 -- NCNA on the 10th publicizes a "press statement" attributed to the
 delegations of Bechuanaland, Basutoland, Swaziland, Southwest Africa,
 and Azania (name used for South Africa) which denounces as "diabolical,
 malicious, and slanderous'' a June 24 statement "b    organizations with
 offices in Cairo, namely:  Southwest African People's Organization
 (SWAPO), Frente de Libertacao de Mozambique (FRELIMO), Movemento Popu-
 lar de Libertacao de Angola (MPLA), Idea Popular de La Guinea Equaltor-
 ial (IPGE), African National Congress of South Africa (ANC), and the
 Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU).
 "These bogus revolutionary organizations ... have time and again
 been exposed as tools of the counterrevolutionary foreign policy of
 the Soviet Government...."
 -- TANYUG Peking on the 17th reports that the Embassy of the Ghana
 Republic in Peking protested the conference's resolution on the Febr-
 uary coup d'etat in Ghana, and noted that only 30 lives were lost
 during the event, not 2,500 killed and 3,000 wounded as claimed by the
 resolution.
 -?-? NCNA reports from Nanking on the 27th on anti-Soviet remarks made
 by A-A writers visiting there, such as:  "One valuable lesson we have
 learned during this tour,' Agam Wispi from Indonesia said, 'is that
 the Soviet revisionists' so-called technical aid, as we saw for our-
 selves, is nothing but a deception, a U.S.-type of trade."

 July 5, 10, 11, 14, 15, 28:  A new round of Sino-Soviet recriminations
 flares over the escalated U.S. bombing in N.-Vietnam since June 29.
 Highlights include:
 --- A People's Dail1 editorial on July 5 charges that the bombings "are
 a product of the filthy political deal concluded between the U.S. and
 the S.U., which are working hand in glove.  The Johnson administration
 confessed that before the bombing it had informed various 'key inter-
 ested governments' of its decision ... and that the S.U. was a 'key
 interest govt.'  In additon, it admitted that it was 'in continuous
 touch' with the S.U. and other countries on 'all aspects of the strug-
 gle in Vietnam.' It added that 'there have been cautious approaches'
 between the U.S. and S.U."
 -- At a July 10 protest rally of 10,000 headed by Chou En-tai in
 Peking, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi declares,

 ``... The bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by U.S. imperialists was en-
 tirely the result of U.S.-Soviet collusion."  He also adds that "they
 are making a militar  deployment along the Chinese border in coordina-
 tion with the U.S. imperialist encirclement of China.:'
 -m A Pravda article on the llth, without referring to the Chinese
 charges, brands the American statements the ""nonsensical" work of
 "psychological warfare services."
 -W- On the 11+th, however, TASS states that it "is authorized to deny
 emphatically" American reports alleging that the S.U. was informed in
 advance.  Referring to Chen Yips speech, TASS concludes:
 "The impression is made that this lie was fabricated in
 Washington with the special intent that it would be picked up by
 the people in Peking who are eager to pounce on anti-Soviet fab-
 rications.                           By this new slander against the S.U., made in unison
 with the concoctions of American propaganda, Chen Yi is in effect
 rendering a service to the U.S. imperialists who are waging a ban-
 dit war against the Vietnamese people."
 People's Daily strikes back on the next day, saying:  "Nobody can
 deny the numerous facts of Soviet collusion with the U.S. in trying to
 force peace talks through bombing."
 July  ?:  People's Daily Commentator uses reports by UPI, British and
 Indian newspapers on June 16?.-17, with a VNA denial of June 19 (#3),
 all on the subject of alleged Chinese obstacles to shipment of aid to
 Vietnam, to charge the USSR again with anti-Chinese rumormongering:
 "... The lies fabricated by the Soviet revisionist leadership and
 circulated by Western news agencies have become ever more absurd
 and nonsensical....  These incidents reflect the fact that the
 S.U. and the U.S. are working hand in glove on the Vietnam issue,
 banding together for sinister purposes... to oppose China, under-
 mine the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Vietnamese
 people...."
 July 7:  Ouagadougou, Upper Volta, radio reports that Central African
 Republic President Bokassa, in his Paris meeting with General de Gaulle,
 warned that:
 "The Chinese have created difficulties in the Central Afri-
 can Republic.                           I did not hesitate to break relations with the
 Chinese.  To have peace, one must not admit the Chinese into one's
 country because they teach subversion.  I must tell you that the
 CAR had in its territory a Chinese school for subversion, and even
 a camp to train marksmen."

 Against Internationalism,"includes the charge that:

 Ju   11:  Capping a visit to Canada by Soviet Deputy Premier Polyansky,

 July 12 & 13:  Two separate cases of Communist espionage in the U.S.
 are disclosed on successive days.  On the 12th, retired Army Lt. Col.
 Whalen is arrested by the FBI on charges of conspiring with two Soviet
 Embassy officials to pass high-level military information to the USSR.
 Both Soviet officers have since returned to the USSR.  On the 13th,
 the State Dept. revealed that a Dept. employee, John Mrkva, who had been
 cooperating with the FBI since he was "recruited" by a Czech Embassy
 officer in 1961, had held 48 meetings with and received a total of
 $3,440 from the original officer and his successor over the 5-year
 period.  Mrkva's final assignment ?-- which precipitated the FBI's
 decision to terminate the operation -- was to plant a "very effective"
 self-contained microphone-transmitter in the office of the Director of
 Eastern European Affairs.  The State Dept expelled Mrkva's ?'contact,"
 and notified UN SecyGen Thant that the original recruiter is now with
 the Czech UN Mission in New York.

 July 13:   NCNA announces that all leading Peking papers have reprinted
 a July 9 Liberation Arm,  Daily attack on Sholokhov's The Fate of Man,
 under the heading "The Bugler of the Clique of Revisionist Renegades."
 Bellicose passages include:
 "The literature of the revisionist renegades is in the com-
 plete service of the political bargaining between revisionism and
 imperialism.  They sling mud at the nature of revolutionary wars
 and wantonly distort the truth about them.  The exaggerate the
 terror and misery of war and preach bourgeois 'pacifism'....
 What Sholokhov is destroying is the proletarian world out-
 look.  What he is destroying is revolutionary heroism and what he
 is building up is the philosophy of survival....
 A true fighter considers it shameful to be taken prisoner.
 ... A true fighter would rather die standing than live kneeling....
 ... At one stroke, you (Sholokhov) venomously club to death both
 the great October Revolution and the Patriotic War.  Why?
 By exaggerating the sufferings of war, you are trying to
 scare people in the vain hope of inducing them to take the sinis-
 ter revisionist road,the road of selling out to the enemy, just
 as people of your kind are doing....
 Marx said:   'Combat or death; bloody struggle or extinction.
 It is thus that the question is inexorably put.'
 Of course, in wars resulting from aggression and suppression
 by imperialism, some 'pots and pans' are bound to be broken and
 sacrifices made.  But these are completely justifiable and worth
 while....
 The wheel of time moves on inexorably.  K. has long been
 thrown out of the political arena and is an object of people's
 contempt.  Although Sholokhov, under the wing of the Soviet re-
 visionist clique, is still ferociously snarling against revolution,
 his unclean soul smells to high heaven and he will never escape
 the punishment of history!  Down with the revisionist philosophy
 of survival!  Long live the victory of the people's war!1

 Brezhnev and Ponomarev in Moscow:  they "reaffirmed the complete ident-
 ity of their views on all major problems of the time."
 July 18:  The U.S. House Committee on Un-American Activities makes
 public some of the testimony it received from Wladyslaw Tykocinski,
 former head of the Polish military mission in West Berlin who defected
 to the U.S. in May 1965.  He stated that at least 38 of the 50 members
 of the mission were actually intelligence agents, and that their number
 had increased in recent years as the "hard-liners" strengthened their
 control of the Warsaw Government.
 Ju_1y 19:  The leadership of the Lutheran World Federation discloses
 that the East German Government had barred the Federation from sched-
 uling its 5th International Assembly in Weimar in 1969.
 July 19-22:  A public fracas between the Chinese and Netherlands Govern-
 ments breaks out over the mysterious death of a Chinese engineer in
 The Hague, where he had come for the 19th assembly of the International
 Institute of Welding.  Press reports indicate that the engineer was
 found injured in front of a Chinese-rented house and taken to a Dutch
 hospital, from which he was abducted by Chinese diplomats and subse-
 quently died.  The Chinese Charge d'Affaires, Li En--chiu,was expelled
 by the Dutch on the 19th.  A scathing July 21 NCNA denunciation of the
 Dutch action ("coarse," "arrogant," "unjustifiable," "unscrupulous,"
 "vicious") blames it all on the U.S.I  It claims that "secret U.S.
 agents, with the connivance of the Dutch  Government, used every sor-
 did means to induce, illegally and repeatedly, members of the Chinese
 delegation to desert and betray their country."  The deceased's in--
 juries were sustained, it says, when, "incited by U.S. agents," he
 Jumped from the building where he was lodged and attempted to run
 away.  The Chinese retaliated by declaring the Netherlands Charge in
 Peking persona non grata on the 22nd _-?? but detained him as hostage
 until all members of the Chinese delegation had left the Netherlands.
 Reporting on the incident from The Hague, NYTimes correspondent
 Edward Cowan says:  "Dutch experts believe that The Hague is a center
 of Chinese espionage activity.  About a month ago the Govt said that
 Chinese working in the Netherlands without permission must apply for
 residence and work permits or leave the country."
 July 19 & 21:  The Albanian Zeri I Popullit  takes off on the Yugoslav
 Party and police purge and reorganization in a long, 2-part article:
 "The Lamentable Bankruptcy of the Political and Economic System of
 Titoite Yugoslavia."  It first recalls that almost 20 years ago Stalin
 and the Cominform "denounced the lack of democracy in Yugoslavia and
 the introduction in that country of a 'shameful, terrorist, purely
 ottoman regime."'  It goes on:
 "Through examples and authentic facts, our press and our
 propaganda have shown what is going on in the Titoist hell....

 They have protested with revulsion and profound indignation
 against the terrible Titoite concentration c_amps, the mass perse-
 cutions, the assassinations and the tortures inflicted....  We
 have shown that T. Yugoslavia has been transformed into a irison
 of the peoples, where national divisions and chauvinistic passions
 prevail, where the nationalities are divided into superior and
 inferior categories, into rulers and subordinates....
 All that we have said is quite harmless compared to the un-
 masking which the T. gang inflicted upon itself at the recent
 plenum....  Tito is now obliged to admit that there is only one
 power in Yugoslavia, that of the UDB....
 ... Even what was said at the plenum is sufficient to confirm once
 again -- and this time out of their own mouths -- what the great
 Stalin said 20 years a*o, what our party has always declared and
 said, what Yugoslav internationalist Communists declared, and
 what the Yugoslav people declare every day, namely that the
 counterrevolutionary white terror does rule in Yugoslavia and
 that Y. is a terrorist police state, the ferocious dictatorship
 of a gang in the service of American imperialism....
 The UDB has soaked its bloody road against the peoples of
 Y. and against socialism with the blood of the thousands of inter-
 national Communists killed in the prisons and police stations;
 with the blood of the thousands and tens of thousands of workers
 and peasants killed without trial and without documents in city
 and country....
 ... This is the first time that we can say that the Y. revisionists
 do not lie,... although they admit only part of the truth, a very
 small part, a morsel.  The question arises:  why did they do this?...
 The denunciation of Rankovic concerns the total political and
 moral degeneration, the profound rot, of the Y. Titoite gang,
 which is like those gansters who, after their misdeeds, attack
 each other and kill each other off for a share in the booty.  The
 Serbo-Croatian chauvinists are quarreling at theeexpense of the
 peoples of Yugoslavia....  The Y. Titoites feel that the people's
 hatred is rising like a tempest....  So now they try to divertthe
 discontent and the hatred of the people of Y. onto a Rankovic or
 a Stefanovic, to make the people believe that henceforth things
 will change...."
 July 20 & 29:  TASS on July 20 announces the close of a 10-day session
 of,the Executive Committee of the International Union of Students (IUS)
 attended by representatives of 50 countries in Cairo:  its bland
 statement indicates no disagreements, nor does it mention the long-
 postponed 9th World Youth Festival.  On the 29th, however, NCNA issues
 a long account of how the Chinese delegation in Cairo "adamantly
 opposed the revisionist leading clique of the Soviet Union in its
 position of accomplice of U.S. imperialism and its use of the IUS to

 further its own erroneous line of capitulation and splittism."  It
 describes in detail how the Soviets "manipulated the meeting," how,
 whenever the Chinese or their allies took the floor, the Soviets "had
 the executive chairman arbitrarily stop their speeches, ... had the
 microphone cut off ... had their hatchetmen create a foul atmosphere
 by pounding tables, booing, and stamping their feet."  "Not trusting
 their arguments at the meeting, the Soviet revisonist bloc indulged
 in all kinds of shameless base dealings outside the meeting."  "Some
 delegates to previous IUS meetings said that some pretense of
 democracy had been preserved at these earlier meetings, but at this
 meeting even this fake democracy had been dropped."
 July 20:  Clandestine Communist radio "Voice of the People of Thailand"

 terrorizing the Philippine countryside Vietcong-style may by
 the beginning of a long campaign in Luzon and new unrest in South-
 east Asia.  The initiative is presently in the hands of the Huks,
 a Communist-.led peasant force that revolted and was crushed in
 the early 1950's and renewed activity this year, killing at least
 30 people and kidnapping some 60 others....
 Thursday night a Huk commando squad blasted its way through
 police barricades in a town in rice--growing Nueva Ecija Province,
 killing two policemen:  Wednesday, what is believed to be the
 same group brought down two wounded Philippine constabulary troops
 and destroyed at least one police vehicle...."
 On the 25th APP cites "a central Luzon official" as stating that

 ambush on July 19.  APP adds that "Communist Chinese propaganda appears
 to have increased in the Philippines."

 by 144 scientists from 33 countries and regional institutions in Asia,
 Africa, Latin America, and Oceania."  The list includes only three from
 LA (Chile, Colombia, and Mexico) -- and not Cuba.  "Among those present,"
 reports NCNA, "were Robert Williams, the noted American Negro leader;
 Djawoto, SecyGen Of the A-A Journalists Association; and foreign peace
 champions and expe.ts in Peking."  "The colloquium held that only by
 first opposing imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism would it
 be possible to develop the national science and culture of the masses
 of the people of the four continents."  110 of those attending are
 reported by NCNA to have signed a statement condenming U.S. aggression
 in Vietnam.  NCNA's detailed reporting as the colloquium proceeded

 July 24-30:  Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's visit to Japan brings
 agreement on a consular convention and on Soviet-Japanese cooperation
 in developing the economic resources of Siberia.  The USSR rejected
 Japanese efforts to win reconsideration of Japan's claim to the South-
 ern Kurile Islands, taken by the USSR at the end of WWII.  NCNA and
 People's Daily attack the visit on the 31st as "a new stage in the col-
 lusion between teen the Soviet revisionist leading clique and the Japanese
 reactionaries" and in the development of the "unholy alliance" of the
 U.S. Japan, and the USSR against China.
 Jul, r 26:  Fidel Castro surfaces. after long absence from public view,
 with a long, fiery, frustrated speech on the 13th anniversary of his
 attack on the Monads Barracks which launched his revolt against the
 Batista regime.  He is particularly critical of the "pseudorevolution-
 aries," "defeatists" and "capitulationists" in Latin America who fail
 to make revolutions even though they often have "better conditions"
 than he had in Cuba.  He opposes "technical and economic assistance"
 to Chile, which is "a show window of imperialism trying to smuggle
 Christian Democracy in L.A., but the flirtations of Frei won't dupe
 anyone....  The prostitute will not become virtuous."  (See July 2
 report of a Soviet aid delegation to Chile.)

 July 26-28:  The !Japanese Government's decision on the 26th to deny an
 entrance permit to Liu Ning-Yi, head of the Chinese delegation to the
 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, draws sharp
 Chinese attacks.  People's Daily Commentator on the 28th, notiig that
 Liu had visited Japan many times, including the last two bomb confer-
 ences in 196+ and 1965, asks why this sudden negative decision.  It
 points to the July visits of Rusk and Gromyko in Japan.  "What obviously
 is being staged is a grand joint anti-China performance by U.S. im-
 perialism, Japanese militarism, and the Soviet revisionist leading
 clique...."
 J2 9:  The  eirut press reports that a diplomat attached to the
 Chinese Communit Embassy in Damascus has defected and asked the U.S.

 the U.S. Embassy in Damascus.
 Radio Dar es Salaam reports that Tanzanian President Nyerere laid
 the foundation stone for 2.5 million-pound textile mill being construc-
 ted at Ubungo, a suburb of the capital, "with an interest-free loan from
 the People's Republic of China."  He thanked the Chinese experts for
 their hard work.
 "At the nearby new 100-kilowatt radio transmitter, also being
 built with Chinese aid, the President was conducted on a tour of
 the site by a fluent Swahili-speaking Chinese interpreter and met
 four Tanzanian  radio engineers who are understudying the Chinese
 experts."
 July 29:   Guatemalan newspapers report a press interview with Communist
 guerrilla leader Luis Turcios in his mountain hideout:  he rejects the

 tinue fighting to seize national power "for the people."
 August 1:  The New Delhi INFORMATION SERVICE OF INDIA releases the
 text of a July 28 note to the Chinese Embassy in India:
 "The Indian Government has received reports that since 3 July
 1966 Chinese troops entrenched across the Sikkim-Tibet border at
 Nathu La have been making propaganda broadcasts through loudspeakers
 to the Indian defense forces on the Sikkim side of the border.
 During the last week these broadcasts have become virulent, pro-
 vocative, and abusive.  They malign the Government and people of
 India and even call on the officers and men of the Indian Army
 to oppose the Indian Govt...."
 After quoting some extracts from the broadcasts, the note says:
 ''It is time that the Chinese Govt realize that neither the people of
 India nor the peoples of Asia and Africa will tolerate such attempts
 at interference and domination from outside."  It concludes by lodging
 "the most emphatic protest' and demanding that "this provocative and
 interventionist propaganda cease forthwith.
