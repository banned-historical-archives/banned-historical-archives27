The Value 
Of the 
? C? I? A? 
By Ray S. Cline 
? WASHINGTON?The surge of senti-
mental piety and outrage over the 
public disclosure that the Central In-
telligence Agency had attempted to ? 
influence the Course of political events 
in Chile in the nineteen-seventies has? 
'shed' more heat than light. 
All great countries attempt to influ-
ence events in other countries when: 
these events affect . their interests: ' 
Other nations try to influence our 
domestic politics; the Soviet Union 
and China have a well-defined and 
widely-known philosophy of attempt-
ing to promote violent social and po-
litical revolution in all non-Communist 
countries. 
The C.I.A. did not invent covert 
political-action programs?that is, ac-
tion to influence political events abroad 
without the Government's official 
hand showing. It was Soviet efforts to 
intervene through local Communist 
parties and large-scale infusion of 
money into Western Europe that first 
led to a C.I.A. counter-effort. 
President Truman took this step on 
the advice of very competent and pa-
triotic men, particularly Gen. George 
C. Marshall and Defense Secretary 
James V. Forrestal. 
This happened in 1948, a crucial 
year, especially for the future of Eu--
rope. The Soviet occupation of Czecho-
slovakia and the Berlin blockade 
frightened most Americans then. Fear 
of Soviet domination of most of 
Europe led to the Marshall Plan and 
creation of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
The same fear led to the decision 
In favor of secret efforts to assist 
moderate, center and center-left po-
litical leaders re-establish a multiparty 
parliamentary system in Italy and in 
other nations threatened by strong 
local Communist movements supported 
by Moscow.

PRESS GROUP ASSAILS' 
C.I.A. ROLE IN CHILE 
CARACAS, Venezuela, Oct. 
19 (UPI)?The Inter-American 
Press Association yesterday con-
demned the United States Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency's fin-
ancing of Chilean newspapers 
opposed to the leftist govern-
ment of the late Salvador Al-
lende Goseens and urged Presi-
dent Ford to identify the re-
Thus, American funds were made 
available to democratic political parties 
and the democratic press. Because the 
Europeans were determined to avoid 
one-party dictatorship and Soviet 
domination, they accepted this covert 
aid; using it to their advantage, and 
ours. ? - 
The C.I.A. did not act on its own. 
It has never initiated such covert 
programs without approval of appro--
priate authorities acting on the Presi-
dent's behalf or on direct instructions 
from the Presidant himself. 
The authority for such decision-mak-
ing is the National Security Council, 
set up in 1947 to deal with military 
and political considerations in Ameri-
can strategic and foreign policies. The 
C.I.A. is purely an instrument of pol-
icy. To belabor it for carrying out 
covert-action programs is pointless. 
The tendency to blame the CIA.. 
for failed programs when they are pub-
licized is dangerous because the effect 
on the public and on Congressmen who 
vote for C.I.A. funds is to discredit the 
country's whole intelligence organiza-
tion. 
The best term for this organization 
is "intelligence community" because 
it is a coordinated group of agencies 
in the State, Defense and other depart-
ments as well as in the C.I.A. Most 
of the agencies' work involves collec-
tion, evaluation, analysis and report-
ing of intelligence. The entire intel-
ligeece community's total effort 
devoted to covert political actions of 
any kind in recent years has been 
between one and 2 per cent of the 
total program. 
This level is falling. There are no 
political-action programs under way 
.now. It would be a shame if a furor-
over the Chilean operation caused the 
C.I.A. to be so damaged in public 
and Congressional esteem that it can-
not carry on its absolutely indispensa-
ble work on behalf of our safety. 
The Chilean program, whether well-
advised or not, was focused on 
furnishing money needed to keep the 
opposition news media alive so that 
groups whose activities are consid-
ered compatible with United States 
interests would continue to be heard 
despite efforts to silence them. It also 
provieied campaign funds to center 
parties, mainly the Christian Demo-
crats. The money spent in Chile, and 
other places, was spent to keep op 
cipients of the moneY. 
1 The action on the final day 
of the association's 30th annual 
general assembly marked the 
first time it has criticized the 
United States in a report of its 
freedom of the press committee. 
The five-day convention, at-
tended by some 400 United 
States and Latin American pub-
lishers, also condemned the 
take-over by the Peruvian Gov-
ernment of six newspapers- and 
what it called a lack of press 
freedom in Brazil and Argen-
R000100340004-6-
tions before the voters. 
The principal supporters of Presi-
dent Salvador Allende Gossens' ad-
ministration intended to establish a 
dictatorship of the revolutionary left, 
abolish Congress and neutralize or 
destroy the entire managerial and 
middle class. The administration re-
ceived aid and credit from Communist 
countries, Much, of which it did not 
have time to use, totaling about $600 
million. The United States gave about 
$8 million to the parties fighting to 
keep Congress and constitutional 
democratic guarantees alive unti the 
.1976 election._ . . 
, I hope the center groups still sur-
viving will be able to restore parlia-
mentary government. If so, it probably 
will be done without American help, 
in view of United States Congressional, 
and public criticism. . ? 
Clearly, American covert aid should. 
'be given rarely, specifically 'when it 
will help stabilize a friendly nation's 
politics by keeping constitutional 
government alive. 
. Perhaps the effort in Chile was a 
mistake. It certainly did not succeed. 
Everyone is entitled to his own view 
'of whether Americans will ever again 
want, or be able, to conduct covert 
political action to support like-minded 
people abroad when our help would 
make a crucial difference in their 
survival. I suspect that in the troubled 
world situation ahead the responsible 
consensus will again favor it just as 
in 1948. ? ' . 
I think we should not be obsessed , 
with piety but instead should think 
earnestly of every way possible short 
of total war to insure that our society 
and political structures and alliances 
with like-minded peoples will continue 
to flourish in the face of a threatening 
international economic and political - 
environment.

Foreign Companies Aided Anti-Allende 
By JONATHAN KANDELL 
Special to The New York Times 
SANTIAGO, Chile ? The 
widespread strikes that set the 
stage for the military coup that 
overthrew the late President 
Salvador Allende Gossens were 
partly financed by funds pro-
vided by companies based in 
Mexico, Venezuela and Peru, 
according to leading Chilean 
businessmen. 
. The businessmen, ranking 
members of the SOFOFA, the 
most important industrial asso-
ciation in 'Chile, said that they 
had personally channeled these 
funds?amounting to $200,000 
?to striking truck owners, 
shopkeepers and professional 
groups in the weeks preceding 
the fall of the Allende Govern-
menton Sept: 11, 1973. 
They said that a company 
called Protexa, based in Mon-
terrey, Mexico, contributed 
$100,000 to the anti-Allende 
campaign and Grupo Mendoza 
of Caracas, Venezuela, $50,000. 
Money From the C.I.A. 
The businessmen said that a 
Peruvian concern, which they 
declined to identify, gave close 
to $50,000 to help finance the 
Chilean strikes. 
It was disclosed in September 
that the United States Central 
Intelligence Agency had secret-
ly financed unions and trade 
groups for more than 18 
months befOre? President. Al-
lende was overthrown. More 
than half of the $8-million au-
thorized for clandestine C.I.A. 
activities in Chile was used to 
provide benefits for anti-Al-
lende strikers in 1972 and 1973, 
according to United States In-
telligence sources. 
How the funds were chan-
neled to Allende opponents was 
not disclosed. The Chilean busi-
ness sources did not link the 
money they received to the 
C.I.A. 
"I would have no way of 
knowing whether. those funds 
were indirectly from the C.I.A. 
or whether those companies 
were merely sympathetic to our 
cause as they claimed they 
were," said one businessman. 
"We did not 'ask any ques-
tions," he added. "We had a 
very tough time collecting 
funds both here and abroad be-
cause people were giving up 
hope that things could change 
in Chile." 
"All these stories that money 
was pouring into Chile to fight 
Allende," said another busi-
nessman. "They were just not 
true. It was not that easy." 
The sources described a half-
dozen fruitless fund - raising 
trips through Latin America, 
Europe and the United States. 
"Most of the time, we were 
promised money and it never 
came" said a former SOFOFA 
member. "The Europeans espe-
cially madelools of us." 
The sonrces said that the mo-
ney from the Mexican, Vene-
zuelan and Peruvian companies 
,suddenly started to arrive dur-
ing the first half of 1973 in time 
,to help finance the anti-Allende 
, 
strikes that began in July of Strikers, Chileans Sa 
that year. 
Protexa, the Mexico-based 
concern, was founded in 19451 
as a small manufacturer of 
waterproofing material for 
roofing. It has grown rapidly 
and now owns at least eight 
Mexican companies, and has: 
eight affiliates abroad, includ-
ing Asfaltos Chilenbs Protexa, 
with offices in Santiago. 
According to business sour-
ces, Protexa was not expro-
priated or seized by workers 
during the Allende years when 
hundreds of foreign and 
Chilean companies came under 
government control. 
The Grupo Mendoza, one of 
the largest Venezuelan business 
groups, is involved in machine-
ry imports, cement and paper 
production and other activities. 
Chilean sources said they did 
not know of any affiliate here 
of the concern. ? ' 
SOFOFA officials said the 
money was distributed to strik-
ers weekly in July, August and 
September of 1973. The dollars 
were converted on the black 
market at up to 500 per cent 
the official exchange rate. 
"We were giving the truckers 
about $2,000 a week," said one 
'businessman, adding that he 
believed the truck owners also 
received support from other 
fi-
nancial sources. Le6n Vilarin, 
the -president of the Truck 
Owners Association, has been 
traveling in Europe. Previously 
he has asserted that the truck-
ers depended on their own fi-
nancial resources dur?ng the 
strik. Other ranking Members of 
the Truck Owners. Association 
could not be reached or com-
ment. 
Firm Foes of Allende 
The truck owners ? about 
40,000 controlling some 70,001), 
vehicles?were the stanchest 
opponents of . the Allende 
Government during its waning 
months. Their 50-day strike 
crippled this country's econo-
my, which depends far more 
heavily on trucks than on 
the state-owned railways for 
the movement of goods. 
The truck owners' hostility 
was due to the Marxist coali-
tion Government's efforts to 
create a parallel, state-owned 
trucking group. Mr. Vilarin, a 
former Socialist party member, 
liked to surprise critics by 
pointing out that he was once 
an Allende supporter. Even af-
ter the coup, he kept a large 
photograph in his office show-
ing the late President embrac-
ing him. 
The opposition to Dr. Allende 
was broadly divided into those 
who sought a military coup 
with an end to civilian politics 
and those who wanted to tem-
per the President's socialist pol-
icies and defeat his coalition 
through elections in 1976. 
The C.I.A. helped finance 
both groups even when they. 
were in bitter disagreement 
with each other. Although de-
fenders of C.I.A. intervention in 
Chile, including President Ford, 
have asserted that the goat of 
the agency was to maintain de-
mocratic -political parties and! 
other institutions, its rule of 
thumb apparently was to throw 
;its weight behind the strongest 
'source of opposition to the Al-
,lende Government. 
At times, this meant' support-
ing strikers intent on overthrow-
ing the Government and at oth-
er dines it meant heavy finan-
cial contributions to anti-Al-
lende candidates when legisla-
tive elections were considered 
the best method of overturning: 
Dr. Allende. 
Some Were Annoyed 
-In interviews, left-wing mem-
bers of the Christian Democra-
tic party, which received heavy 
financial support from the 
C.I.A., recalled with annoyance 
the agency's support of a 26 
day work stoppage by truck 
owners,- profeesionals and busi-
nessmen that failed to over-
throw Dr. Allende in October, 
1972. 
At that time, a left-wing, 
member, Ren?uentealba, was 
the party's secretary general.! 
He called a party meeting with 
Mr. Valarin to tr yto get the 
truckers and other strikers to 
moderate their demands. ? 
"We asked Vilarfn who was 
funding the strike" said a rank-
ing Christian Democrat who 
'participated in the meeting. 
"All he said was that he wanted 
to bring down Allende. We told 
him that we were willing to 
back the strikers' legitimate 
economic ? grievances, but that 
we would not go along with a 
coup." 
The October, 1972, strike 
ended when Dr. Allende, 
-backed by moderate Christian 
Democrats, persuaded military 
leaders to join his Cabinet. Al-
lende opponents thought the 
military officers would put a 
brake on the Government's so-
cialist program while both sides 
geared up for the March, 1973, 
legislative elections. 
The C.I.A. contributed $1.5-
million to opposition candi-
dates who banked heavily on 
gaining a two-thirds 'legislative 
majority that would have en-
abled them to remove Dr. Al-
lende by impeachment: 
Although the opposition par-
ties maintained solid majorities 
in Congress,. the Marxist coali-
tion received a surprising 43.4 
per cent of the. popular vote, 
,compared with 36 per cent re-
ceived when Dr. Allende was 
voted into office in 1970, and 
picked up two Senate seats and 
six seats in the Chamber of De-
puties. 
According to informed sour-
ces, the C.I.A., which had cor-
rectly predicted an Allende vic-
tory in 1970, underestimated 
Allende support in the 1973 le-. 
gislative elections, predicting 
less than a 40 per cent vote for 
the Marxist coalition. 
The disclosure of C.I.A. aid to 
anti-Allende groups has caused 
relatively little impact in Chile. 
Few Chileans, even leftists, be-
lieve that the C.I.A. itself could 
have provoked the coup or ac-
counted for the widespread 'dis-
content with the Allende 
Government. 
Most Chileans assumed all 
along that the agency was in-
volved in the country's politics 
along with intelligence groups 
from Communist countries. 
As long as we could main-
tain our political independence, 
we would have taken money 
from the C.I.A., the Russians or 
anybody,", said Gabriel Caceres, 
a leading fund raiser for the 
PIR, a small party .that broke 
away from the Allende. coali-
tion. "We didn't because it was 
not offered." ? 
El Mercurio, theleadinA anti-
Allende newspaper, which is 
reported to have receivd finan-
cial backing from th?C.I.A., has 
published news of the disclo-
sure in detail. 
'Such Incredible Cheapness' 
In editorials, the newspaper. 
has asserted that the disclosure 
"undoubtedly has Communist 
inspiration, , which blows 
through the minds of liberals in 
the Country to the north."

Decision-Making and 'Covert Operations' 
This town is disturbed about what 
the CIA did in Chile and is asking 
itself where to place the blame and 
how to prevent something similar 
from happening again. 
? Some people?Sen. James Abourezk. 
(D-S.D.), for example?are saying that 
so long as you- haVe covert operators 
ready to operate somebody is going 
to approve a plan to use them, and 
that the best way to avoid future mis-
adventures is to abolish the jobs of th 
operators and forbid the hiring of-any 
more. 
? On the other hand, Sens. Howard 
Baker (R-Tenn.) and Lowell Weicker 
(R-Conn.) think they can envision 
occasions when covert operations 
might be essential to the survival of 
the nation. What went wrong in the 
Chilean affair, they say, is that Secre-
tary of State Henry Kissinger approved 
a plan which was not only not essential 
to the survival of the nation but not 
even conducive to the nation's good. 
They have introduced a bill to give 
Congress an official oversight function 
on covert operations. But they are 
not very clear as to whether Congress 
should approve the operations in 
advance or merely be told -about them 
after they are under way. 'P-'.

responsible. On the other hand.- if

covert operations after the fact,' what 
good would that do? 
There's a third aspect to the argu-
ment, and it is put forward by Sen. 
Frank Church (D-Ida.). Church spent 
a lot qf time last year investigating 
an earlier CIA effort in Chile ? the 
campaign to defeat Salvador Allende 
at the polls. Obviously, he didn't probe 
deeply enoitgh. At the same time he 
was getting testimony 'about a 1970 
operation, the CIA was off on another 
one. 
What irritates Church even more 
is that Henry Kissinger, whom he 
regarded as a friend, was 'a great deal 
less than candid with him when 
Church asked him questions about the 
downfall of Allende. 
Kissinger kept repeating he knew 
nothing of the coup?without saying 
he knew a good .4.ea1 about what 
brought about the coup. He also told 
Church that the CIA intervention Was

Church took him at his word and

What disturbs Church is the lack of 
trust as well as the lack-of judgment.. 
He's even willing to finesse the judg-`

By SEYMOUR M. HERSH 
Special to The New York Times 
? than S50,000 was actually spent 
because of the coup d'etat in 
Chile the next month. 
Mr. Eagleburger's intention in 
? briefing Mr. Schorr, the sources 
said, was to rebuff off-the-
record statements made to the 
,newsman earlier by Ray, S. 
;Cline, the former director of 
the State Department's Bureau 
of Intelligence. Mr. Cline par-
ticipated in 40 Committee de-
.liberations on Chile from 1970 
to 1973 and has recently criti-
cized Mr. Kissinger's role at 
? those Meetings. 
The disclosure of the docu-
ments took place less than a 
week after Mr. Kissinger, 
through his spokesman, had 
publicly called such leaks "a 
disgrace to the Foreign Serv-
ice" and dangerous to national 
security. 
One of -the 1970 documents 
shown to Mr. Schorr included 
the name of a Chilean Govern-
. . 
ment official who served as a' 
conduit for C.I.A. views and 
also apparently helped relay 
funds to anti-Allende forces. 
Such information traditionally 
has been among the most close-
ly guarded government secrets. 
A number of persons familiar 
with State Department opera.' 
tions expressed doubt that Mr. 
Eagleburger would have shown 
Mr. Schorr such documents 
without the direct ;or indirect 
concurrence of the Secretary of 
State. 
Mr. Eagleburger has- denied 
showing Mr. Schorr any docu-
ments and insisted that he had 
personally made the decision to 
brief Mr. Schorr. "I did not, 
show any documents, cables, 
letters or memoranda to any-
body," he said. "I did not 
describe any of the particular 
events that were being argued 
about. All I . provided was a 
general broad statement {deal-
ing with Mr. Cline's- role]." 
"Henry's role was only to 
ask me to do a check of the 
files," Mr. Eagleburger. said. 
"It was me, on my own, who 
told some people what the files 
said." 
Mr: Schorr has made no 
public use of the materials; 
reportedly supplied by Mr. i 
Eagleburger and in a telephone' 
interview refused to discuss; 
the issue, adding: "I don't: 
know what you are talkingi 
about." 
I The first word of Mr. Eagle-
burger's action came indirectly1 
from State Department officials' 
who learned that. a search had: 
been made of the department's! I 
special vault containging its 40 
Committee documents. 
In a telephone interview yes-
terday, Mr. Eagleburger ac-
knowledged that Mr. Kissinger 
had authorized file searches 
both of the National Security 
Council minutes in the White 
House and of the 40 Committee 
documents stored in the State 
;Department in an effort "to see 
whether we &mid come up with

? istratiOn over the clandestine 
C.I.A. operations in, Chile, have 
instead .raised new questions 
'about the _extent of the secret 
United 'States involvement ;in 
the overthrow of Dr. Allende. 
The sources said that Law-
rence S. Eagleburger, Mr. Kiss-
inger's executive assistant,, 
leaked three summaries of :pro-' 
posals for clandestine C.I.A. 
operations in Chile during a 
briefing for the CBS television 
newsman Daniel Schorr. The 
documents had been prepared 
for 'meetings in 1970 and -1973i 
of the 40 Committee. the high?
level intelligence board that re-
views covert activities for the 
United States Government.

July 5. 1973. the C.I.A. recom-

that -$200,000 be -provided clan.: 
destinely to the National party 
in Chile, a conservative group 
that had urged Chileans to re-
ject?with violence if neces-
sary?the Allende Administra-
tion as "illegitimate" and "un-
constitutional." 
The Nationa lparty was con-
sidered to represent the views 
of the propertied class in Chile 
and, in the year before the 
overthrew of Dr. Allende, was 
known to have close ties to 
Patria y Libertad, a reactionary 
group that openly boasted of 
its involvement in military ef-
forts to overthrow the Allende 
Government. 
Since the first published dis-
closures last month of the C.LA. 
operations in Chile, knowledge-
able Ford Administration . offi 
'cials have mainted that the 
;main goal was to enable mod-
I erate political factors to sur-
vive the Allende period: . 
Whether the 40 Commit-
tee specifically .approved the 
proposed funds for the National! 
party could not be learned, 
but William E. Colby, the C.I.A. 
director, told a House intelli-1 
gence subcommit tee Periled

authorized in August, 1973, for 
use in Chile. Mr. Colby further 
testified, however, that less 
Rightists in '73 
ly after Mr. Kissinger learned! 
that Mr. Cline, who retired last! 
year, "had made some state-
ments about his opposition to 
a number of activities in Chile 
and Henry and Nixon had over-
ruled him and the State Depart-
ment." 
"It is true," Mr. Eagleburger 
added, "that I have told some 
people who asked about it that 
the documents made available 
demonstrated the opposite of 
what Cline said." 
? "I guess that I have ,.t) say 
that a chec kof the fil:s showed 
nothing to support the conten-
tion that Mr. Cline registered 
any opposition to proposals 
that had gone to the 40 Com-
mittee on Chile," he added. "In 
? fact, those files demonstrated 
the opposite." 
In an interview with The 
New York Times published 
Thursday, Mr. Cline said that 
the impetus for the Chile pro-
grams had come from either 
Mr. Kissinger or President 
Nixon, or both. Mr. Cline also 
confirmed that the C.I.A.'s ac-
tivities in Chile included the 
financial support of strikes by 
shopkeepers and truckers. 
President Ford and Mr. Kis-
singer have said that the C.I.A. 
!funding in Chile was limited to 
lopposition- newspapers and pol-
iticians. 
Told of Mr. Eagleburger's 
efforts to contradict his views, 
Mr. Cline said that he was "un-
willing to comment on the 
staff papers prepared for 40 
Committee meetings." 
"No one should discuss in-
ternal papers of such impor-
tance," he added. 
Mr. Cline, who served with 
the C.I.A. for more than 20 
years before becoming the 
head of State Department in-
telligence, is now executive di-
rector of the Georgetown 
University School of Strategic 
Studies, 
The Three Documents 1 
The three documents des-
cribed by Mr. Eagleburger dealt' 
with the State Department's 
comments on C.I.A. proposals! 
to be discussed at 40 commit-
tee meetings. 
According to reliable sources, i 
Mr. Cline, as director of in-
telligence, could make addition-' 
al recommendations or com-
ments on the documents, which 
were to be forwarded to the 
Undersecretary for Political Af-
fairs, the official who tradi-, 
be 
tionally represented State on 
the 40 Committee. 
The first document, the 
sources said, was dated Aug. 
31, 1970, and dealt with the 
C.I.A. recommendations in. case 
the pending Chilean presiden-
tial elections resulted in a run-
off involving Dr. Allende. 
Three proposals, or options, 
for investing money in amounts 
ranging from $350,000 to $900,-
000 were reported discussed, 
with the State Department urg-
ing limited funds or no funds 
at all for covert activities. Mr. 
Cline, in a handwritten com-
ment, called for major financial - 
support for anti-Allende forces 
if it could "make a differente" 
between victory or defeat- for. 
Dr. Allende, the source said: 
A second document, dated 
Sept. 4, 1970, the day Dr. 
Allende barely won the Chilean 
election, reportedly discussed a 
C.I.A. proposal for bribing 
members of the Chilean Con-
gress, which, under that coun-
try's Constitution, would have 
to ratify the election and thus 
ultimately choose the President. 
Wymberly Coerr, then thd 
State Department's coordinator 
for 40 Committee staff recom-
mendations, urged that Trio 
,program involving what he 
termed "subornation" be initi-
ated, according to the sources. 
Mr. Cline, in another -hand-
Written comment, reportedly 
depicted Mr. Coerr? as being 
"hung up" ? on the emotional 
overtones of the word suborna-
tion. "In the world of realpoli-
tik," Mr. Cline is said to have 
written such activities do take 
_place. . 
Spending Authorized ' 
The 40 Committee eventually 
recommended that $350,000 be 
spent in an attempt to bribe 
the Congress, which voted 
nonetheless in October to ratify 
Dr. Allende as President. 
The third document, dated 
July 25, 1973, was said to have 
been forwarded to William 
Porter, then the Under Secre-
tary for Political Affairs,"by 
Jack B. Kubisch, then the As-
sistant Secretary for State for 
Inter - American Affairs. The 
document reportedly discussed 
C.I.A. proposals for clandes-
tine financing of the anti-Al-
lende political parties, includ-
ing a specific recommendation 
that $350,000 be given to the 
Christian Democrats and an- . 
other suggestion that $200,000 
be given to the National party.

'-DOUBT ON U.S. ROLE 
IN CHILE RECALLED. 
; 
Ex-Intelligence Aide Asserts, 
C.I.A. and State Dept. 'Went, 
Along' With Nixon Plan ' 
By SEYMOUR M. HERSH 
special to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16?Ray 
S. Cline, a former high-level 
intelligence official in the 
Nixon Administration, said to-
day that he was dubious about 
the ultimate wisdom of the Ad-
ministration's covert interven-
tion against President Salvador 
Allende Gossens of Chile but 
that he supported it because 
he feared more serious inter-
vention by the Soviet Union. 
Mr. Cline, who was inter-
viewed by telephone, is the 
first high official to permit his 
name to be used in confirming 
published reports that the role 
of the Central Intelligence 
Agency in the effort to oust the 
Marxist Government included 
the direct financing of a num-
ber of anti-Allende trade groups 
and labor unions, including 
truckers. 
Despite warnings about the 
Allende Government's inten-
tions relayed in the intelligence 
reports, he said, many high of-
ficials did not believe that clan-
destine operations would ac-
complish the "goal in mind"?
to keep a center coalition alive 
until 1976. 
"State and the, C.I.A. were 
dubious - but naturally went 
along," Mr. Cline said, because 
the White House?either Nixon 
and Dr. Kissinger, or both?
decided the push the program." 
"They key role in this whole 
thing was in the White House," 
he added, "but it's impossible 
to tell whether only one or 
both were enthusiastic about 
it because the orders came 
through Kissinger and the 40 
Committee. It was a National 
Security Council decision and 
not a decision made by the 
C.I.A. or the State Depart-
ment." 
'Resistance Strikes' 
"Some of the money was in-
tended for financial support of 
the small businessmen and the 
truckers in their resistance 
strikes against the Allende 
Government," Mr. Cline said. "I 
think it was very logical to en-
'able those groups to keep alive 
economically so that we could 
maintain a core of private 
entrepreneurs until the .1976 
elections." 
Disclosed by C.I.A. Chief 
The extensive C.I.A. role in 
Chile became known Sept. 8 
When it was reported that the 
Agency's directar, William E. 
:Colby, had told a Congressional 
Committee that $8-million in 
.clandestine funds, was author-
-ized for operations against the 
. Allende Government between 
-1970 and 1973. Dr. Allende died 
a military coup that over threw his Government in Sep-
, tember, 1973.

;of. the State Department's Bu-
reau of Intelligence and Was. 
directly involved in much of 
the planning and discussions: 
.that went on in the 40 Com-I

board that oversees all covert

agency. Before joining the State

At a televised news confer-
ence on Sept. 16, Mr. Ford said 
:that Dr. Allende had been at-
tempting to suppress opposi-
, tion newspapers and politicians. 
He added that the "effort that 
was made in this case was to 
help and assist the preservation 
of opposition newspapers and 
electronic media and to pre-
Serve opposition political_ par-
.:ties." 
" Program Termed Broader 
In the interview, however, 
Mr. Cline said the program?
as approved by the 40 Commit-
tee, he noted?was far broader. 
"What the C.I.A. was trying 
to do," he said, "was to see that 
.at least 50 per cent and proba-
bly 60 per cent of the electorate 
,would be disillusioned by the 
time. of the presidential elec 
lions in 1976" ? when, under 
the Constitution, Dr. Allende 
could not run again 
- "Well," the former State De-
partment official added, "by 
.1973 they were totally disil-
lusioned with him." Mr. Cline 
was alluding to the protests 
and strikes in the last months 
of the Allende Government. 
"I decided to speak out be-
cause I feel that there's such 
a superficial understanding as 
to why the United States has 
tried to assist democratic po-
litical organizations abroad," 
Mr. Cline asserted. 
"I'm not happy about the', 
way I can defend them because! 
think our strategy was not 
unreasonable or immoral. It 
was our duty to preserve insti-

He explained that the ulti-

activities was to enable the I

Getting to the Bottom. 
Of the CIA Cover-up 
Tad Szulc, in his article that follows, writes about Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency subversion in Chile and the 
hiding of it from congressional scrutiny. The judg-
ments that led to secret intervention in Chilean politics 
deserve to be criticized, but at least the CIA was with-
in its legal authority.under its charter. That is not the 
case with CIA's complicity in Watergate "extra-agency 
activities." The law barring the agency from under- i 
taking domestic operations was dearly violated. More-
over, when former CIA Director Richard Helms gave i 
misleading and inaccurate answers to questions posed 
by senators about past CIA assistance to Watergate 
conspirator E. Howard Hunt, who worked for the, 
Nixon White House, he was covering up .possible 
criminal activity; 
On May 21, 1973 Helms was recalled from his post 
as ambassador to Iran and questioned under oath by 
members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
The break-in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychi-
atrist, Dr. Lewis Fielding, by then had been uncovered, 
along with information that CIA had given equipment 
and aid to Hunt who had directed the illegal entry. 
Helms said he had never heard of Dr. Fielding until 
the psychiatrist's name appeared in the newspapers. 
When asked about photographs that had been taken 
by Hunt with a CIA camera and developed by-the 
agency, Helms swore, "I do not know what the con-
tents of the film were in the latter part of August 
[1971]." One senator asked if anyone at the agency who 
. reviewed the film thought Hunt might be contemplat-
ing a break-in. "I never heard anybody at the agency 
mention such a theory," Helms replied and later ad-
ded, "nobody had given us the slightest indication 
that anything underhanded was afoot." 
Helms was asked why CIA had cut off its assistance 
to Hunt on August 27, 1971. Twice the former director 
said it was solely because Hunt's requests had. be-
come "too extensive." To support that, he recollected 
that Hunt asked to have a secretary brought back from 
Paris and a covert New York telephone and address 
established for him. Helms never mentioned the 
photographs and what they appeared to show as the 
reason for the agency's stopping its aid to Hunt. 
A review of the House Judiciary Committee material 
on the Ellsberg break-in and CIA's role indicate Helms', 
Senate testimony was not the true agency -story. On: 
July 7, 1971 White House aide John Ehrlichrnan called 
then CIA Deputy Director Robert Cushman, and ac-
cording to Cushman's secretary's notes, said: "I want 
to alert you that an old acquaintance [of Cushman's], 
Howard Hunt, has been asked by the President to do 
some special consultant work on security problems. 
He may be contacting you sometime in the future for 
some assistance. Lwanted you to know that he was in 
fact doing somethings for the President. He is a long-
time acquaintance with the people here. He may want 
some help on computer rims and other things. You 
should consider he has pretty much carte blanche." 
Cushman did not know that Ehrlichman's call had 
? been prompted by Hunt's then-White House boss 
Charles Colson. And at the time Cushman could not 
know that the reason for the call was to pave the way 
for Hunt to get alisguises, false identity cards, a clan-
destine camera and tape recording equipment from 
the CIA which were to be used for domestic political 
purpoises. 
In making this July 1971 request to the agency for 
"carte blanche" aid to Hunt and wrapping it in vague-
ness about "security problem4" Ehrlichman and 
Colson seemed to- be sure they-iCFolild encounter no 
CIA demand for proof that Hunt was not violating the 
agency's charter? and the law?prohibiting domestic 
operations. Would Cushman have cared? Why were 
these White House aides either. unaware of the law or 
not fearful such an illegal request, if identified, would 
be turned down, or worse, exposed to the public? - 
gain, another flashback ,-- this time to 1969. Ac-
cording to the-House Judiciary Committee's final re-
port on the impeachment articles against Richard 
Nixon: "In 1969, Haldeman and Ehrlichman asked the 
Central Intelligence Agency to conduct physical sur-
veillance of Donald Nixon, the PieSident's brother, 
who was moving to Las Vegas. Haldeman WaS re-
ported-to have feared that Donald Nixon would come 
into contact with- criminal elements." Thereafter is 
cited a report by the CIA inspector general and Deputy 
Director Cushman dated June 29, .1973. Thefl House 
report goes on to. say that the CIA refused to under-
take that mission because it had "no jurisdiction to 
engage in domestic law enforcement or internal a 0 
se-
curity activities.. ." So some line was drawn. 
Sometime after the July 7 Ehrlichrnan call to Cush-
man, which was dutifully reported to the CIA staff 
meeting the next morning, and before July 27, 1971, 
CIA was asked to prepare a psychological profile of 
Daniel Ellsberg. The request came from White House 
aide David Young, who along with Hunt and others 
were investigating Ellsberg. Young reportedly said 
that both Henry Kissinger, then running the National 
Security Council, and Ehrlichrnan wanted CIA to help. 
Helms' director of security, Howard Osborne, to whom 
the request was first, made, has stated he initially 
told Young it would hare to be cleared by Helms, since 
Ellsbeig was "a United States citizen who was pre-
sently involved in a legal sense with the United States 
government." He.lms approved the project after talk-
ing to Young. He told Osborne that nothing was to 
be sent to the White House "without his personal 
prior approval." It is interesting that Helms, in later 
testimony on the matter, said he complained to Young 
that for the agency to write a profile on an American 
citize.n was "an imposition," since CIA knew nothing 
about Ellsberg. Nowhere did Helms complain that the 
task involved CIA in a domestic matter. Later Helms 
was to weasel out some language in the law that per-
mitted the agency to study problems associated with 
the security of CIA classified documents. 
Vi th the profile project approved, FBI documents on 
Ellsberg and published materials were sent to the CIA 
employee who handled the job, Dr. Bernard Malloy. 
Meanwhile Hunt followed up on the July 7 Ehrlich-
man call and visited CIA Deputy Director Cushman

y . ape o at meeting relates that Hunt 
said the equipment was needed because of "a highly 
sensitive mission by the hite House to visit and 
elicit Information from an individual whose ideology 
we aren't entirely sure of.. That "individual" was 
? Clifton DeMotte, a man who supposedly had informa-
?tion on the Kennedys. Hunt also said it would be a ? 
"one time opteration] . . in and out." Cushman did ? 
not ask if this was a domestic activity, instead he 
said: 'I don't see why we can't" provide the equip-
ment. The next day Hunt .got what he wanted. One 
week later Hunt called the CIA technician who sup- o 
plied the first material and asked for a tape recorder 
and additional, help, including credit cards, a second 
speech alteration device and a New York address and p 
telephone number. 
On August 11 the CIA's first profile on Elisberg was .6 
delivered -to the White House, after having been re- s 
viewed by Helms. Attached to it was a note from CIA 
Security Director Osborne stipulating: "I know that H 
you appreciate that however thrs is used, the agency 
should not become involved." 
The report disappointed Young and his colleagues 
at the White House. That same day, Young and Emil 
Krogh proposed "a covert operation be undertaken 
to examine" the files of Ellsbera's former s ct-Cati t 
the technicians began to question the use to which 
Hunt was putting the equipment. The camera had 
been used by Hunt and Liddy to clandestinely photo-
graph Dr. Fielding's office, inside and outside, in 
order to prepare for the burclary, Th- photographs 
were reviewed by CIA technical supervisory person-
nel before they were delivered to Hunt. They revealed 
a shot of a parking space with the name "Dr. Fielding" 
dearly visible. They also disclosed shots of the office 
and one .CIA official speculated at the time they were 
"casing" photographs. Deputy Director Ctishman's 
ffice was informed. A decision was made to tell Hunt 
that no more requests for assistance would be honored. 
According to Gen. Cushman's aide, the CIA technical 
eople thought the assistance given Hunt "appeared 
o involve the agency in domestic clandestine opera-
ons," a finding confirmed by the CIA general court-
el's office. That same day, August 27, Cushman called 
Ehrlichman at the White House and told him aid to 
tint was being halted because of those concerns. 
On September 3, 1971 the break-in-at Dr. Fieldirtg's 
ffice took place. On October 14 or 15, 1971 the CIA 
echniciart who had developed the pictures for Hunt 
was told Gen. Cushman was lunching with Hunt the
briefingext day and wanted a complete briefing on what 
assistance Hunt had been given. The technician in-
cluded in the briefing material z:erox copies of the 
Hunt photographs. What happened at that meeting 
(if it took place) between. Hunt and Cushman, and 
why did the CIA deputy-director at that time want to 
be brought .up to date ox + Hunt's requests? Did the 
agency figure out that there was a relationship between 
e Ellsberg profile and the Hunt casing job of Field-
ng s office? Was any additional material supplied 
y CIA on Ellsberg after the Fielding break-in? I've 
sked that question several places and have no answer. 
is known that the final CIA profile wept to the White 
ouse on November 9, 1971 and carried with it a note 
om Helms stating: "I do wish to underline the point 
at our involvement in this matter should not be 
vea/ed any context, formal or informal." Though 
elms was later to testify he meant the work might 
flect adversely on the capabilities of the agency, the 
en who put the study together have said that their 
ncern was that the "agency's involvement become 
own and particularly that it might come to light 
uring any proceeding." 
Dr. Lewis Fielding. Thus plans were launched for 
the subsequent break-in, and on the following day 
Mr. Malloy of CIA met with Young, Hunt and G. 
Gordon Liddy to discuss the agency .report on Ellsberg. 
Malloy has recalled that when he was told that Ellsberg 
had been under the care of a psychiatrist, Dr. Field-
ing's name was also given to him. Though Huntaske 
Malloy to keep his name out of any report on the meet-
ing, Malloy responded he could not. The White House 
aides asked Malloy what additional material he needed.. 
to expand what had already been done. Malloy, sug-
gested data from Elisberg's early life, "from nurses 
or close relatives...." ? 
Conversations continued to take place over the nex 
? weeks between Malloy and Hunt with the latter pre?s 
su:ing for a new profile. On August 25, 1971, Hun 
and Cordon Liddy requested and received additiona 
disguise material from CIA, along with a. camera con-
ce..zied in a tobacco pouch. A day later the CIA tech-

NEW REPUBLIC * 
28 Sept. 1974 
Candid but Mistaken about Chile.. 
IAThere Presidnt 
by 'Fad. Szulc 
Gerald Ford's first public pronouncement on a con tro 
?versial foreign policy question?secret intervention 
in Chilean politics prior to last year's bloody coup 
d'etat ?was as startling in its sweep as it was erroneous on virtually every point of fact. Probably the first 
.American President to do so publicly, Mr. Ford last 
week delivered an extraordinary defense of covert 
intelligence operations abroad, claiming that in this 
particular case it was "in the best interest of the people 
of Chile, and certainly in our best interest," and that 
"our government, like other governments, does take 
certain actions in the intelligence field to help imple-
ment foreign policy and protect national security." 
By thus advertising the subversion engineered on a 
continuing basis by the super-secret "40 Committee" 
of the National Security Council, the President handed 
the worldwide Communist propaganda mill some of 
? the best grist it has had in years. 
Now for the facts. 
Mr. Ford stated that the US government "had no 
involvement in any way whatsoever in the coup it-
self." In the strictest sense, this is probably true: the 
Chilean army needed no further physical help from 
us to launch the September 11, 1973 revolution and the 
subsequent terror. Chile's armed forces are equipped 
mainly with- US materiel, and Our military. advisers 
worked with the Chileans throughout the Allende 
period. Likewise between 1970 and 1974, when the US 
deprived Chile of commercial credit, including credit 
for vitally needed food imports, it supplied the Chilean 
armed forces with at least $30 million worth of arms, 
primarily aircraft,. on credit. A squadron of S-5 jet 
fighters: was delivered a few. Weeks before the coup 
,and more planes were in the pipeline. The regime fell 
:after jet fighters bombed the presidential palace.-For 
what it was worth psychologiCally, a US naval task 
force was. off the shores of Chile the week of the coup 
in preparation for joint exercises with Chilean war-
ships: Most loans to Allende's Chile were refused by 
the US on the grounds that Chile lacked credit worthi-
ness, although this was no bar to military credit sales. 
What of US assistance. to anti-Allende forces before 
the coup and before Allende took office? Here is where 
the President was misinformed, perhaps by Secretary 
of State Kissingerwho himself is caught in a credibility 
squeeze on - 
Until the surfacir. ig of secret Clonessional testimony 
last April by CIA: -Director William E. Colby, the ad-p. 
ministatiort had. insisted, as did Kissinger a month 
after...the coup, that. the US did virtually nothing to 
damage Allende. C_Olby testified, however, that the 
CIA spent eight million dollars in Chile between 1970 
and 1973 to prevent Allende, in effect, from governing 
Ford and Frankfurter 
Q. Mr. President, under what international law do we 
_ 
have a right to attempt to destabilize the constitu-
tionally elected government of another country? And 
does the Soviet Union have a similar right to try to 
destabilize the government-of Canada, for eXample, or 
the United States? 
A. I'm not going to pass judgment on whether it's 
permitted or authorized under international law. It's 
a recognized fact that historically as well as presently 
such actions are taken in the best interests of the 
countries involved.

I remember shocking him [the Judge Advocate General] 
. . when he came into my room and said, "Frank-
furter, I want you to help me. I've just been over to the 
White House"?this was just after we had seized. the 
customs house at Vera Cruz (April 19141 "and I'm 
asked to write a memorandum whether that seizure 
should be treated as an act of war and what its status 
is in international law. Will you work with me on that?" 
I said, "General, I'm going to ask to be excused. I 
don't have to work on that. I know the answer to that." 
"You do?" 
"Yes, I do." 
"What is the answer?" 
"It would be an act of war against a great nation; it 
isn't against a small nation."

from Felix Frankfurter Reminiscences 
Reynal & Company, C) 1960 by Harlan B. Phillips 
efficiently. He also said that three million dollars had 
been expended in 1964 to keep Allende from winning 
in that election. This is how Mr. Ford explained these 
-pre-coup activities: "In a period of time, three or four 
years agp, there was an effort being made by the 
Allende government to destroy opposition news me-
dia, both the writing press as well as the electronic 
press. And 'to destroy opposition political parties. And 
the effort that was made in this case was to help and. 
assist the preservation. of opposition newspapers and 
electronic media and to preserve opposition political 
parties. I think this is in the best interest of the people 
in Chile, and certainly- in our best interest." 
The President's statement is inconsistent with 
reality in these respects: 
1) The US, through authorizations issued by the 40 
Corrunittee, embarked on undercover support of the 
anti-Allende press and opposition parties nearly four 
Months before Allende took office. Former CIA Direc-
tor Richard Helms te_stified last year that $400,000 was 
approved for media support in Chile on June. 27, 1970. 
After Allende won a plurality, but not a majority in

the elections on September 4, 1970, the US, according 
to Colby's testimony, invested $350,000 to bribe Chil-
ean congressmen to vote against Allende in the run-
? off in the Congress on October 24. So there was no 
. question of saving opposition parties and press at that 
time from persecution by Allende.-
2) After Allende became 'President, minority 
Marxist re-gime, the Unidad Popular, did Precious little 
to "destroy opposition news media." El Mercurio, the 
principal anti-Allende newspaper in Santiago, was 
closed down only once for several days, after publish-
ing an. editorial calling, in effect, for insurrection. 
When its owner, Augustin Edwards, fled Chile im-
mediately after Allende took office (Edwards came 
to the US and became a member of the board of di-
rectors of the Pepsi-Cola company, which is headed by 
Richard Nixon's close friend, Donald Kimball) the new 
governnient began tax and antitrust litigation against 
the Edwards empire. While El Mercurio remained the 
voice of the opposition (it could be read in the waiting 
room of the Chilean embassy in Washington, along 
with pro-regime leftist publications), the Edwards 
family was divested of its bank and other nonpress 
holdings:A right-wing newspaper, La Tribuna., ran into 
some trouble after charging in print that Allende had 
been expelled from medical school for raping a 14-
year-old girl. - 
The Allende regime did refuse to authorize the 
Catholic university in Concepcion to go on the air 
with a new radio station. The university thereupon 
set up a relay from the Catholic .university's station 
in Santiago. After the regime began jamming these 
broadcasts, persons believed to be linked to rightist. 
militant groups blew up the jamming facility. 
3) There is no evidence. that Allende was out to 
?  
"destroy opposition political parties," 'unless we are 
. willing to say that the Nixon administration was out 
to destroy the Democrats here. The Chilean Senate 
.and the Chamber of Deputies, both with anti-Allende 
:.'majorities, functioned until the day of. the coup. 
Allende resisted pressure from the extreme left of his 
coalition to call a plebiscite to abolish the existing 
Congress and replace it with a hand-picked unicam-
eral parliament. There were few political prisoners in 
Chile under Allende_ Today there are over 20,000. 
If the opposition was not in that much' trouble 
(Allende failed to win.a majority in the Congress in the 
1972 parliamentary elections), the question arises why 
the CIA. needed eight million dollars to._ preserve-
the "best interest- of the Chilean people. Colby, who

4) Mr. Ford; asserted that ..the 40 Committee keeps 
the appropriate congressional committees informed 
of its plans for covert intrigue. This is not so. The 40 
Committee as such has never briefed the ,Congress 
and, as far as it is known, Kissinger, . who runs the 
secret group, never confided in congressmen on its be 
half. There is an oversight authority in four subcom-
mittees over the CIA's activities, but these bodies meet 
seldom and their members rarely ask searching ques-
tions. Colby has acknowledged that the congressional 
subcommittees are told of CIA activities post facto 
rather than before the fact as Mr. Ford claimed. ? 
The day after the President spoke, the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee voted unanimously to 
reopen its investigation of the US role in the Chilean 
events. Its staff. recommended that perjury or con-
tempt. citations be considered against formir CIA 
Director Richard Helms and former senior. CIA and 
State Department officials for misleading the Senate 
in earlier testimony. And the senators want to hear 
again from Kissinger, who heads the 40 Committee. 
The question I find so puzzling is why Mr. Ford is 
so misinformed about the history of our involvement 
in Chile?and about the Chilean situation in 1970-
1973.-- and why the 40 Committee. approved the eight. 
million dollars: for covert operations, a rather large 
? 
sum to keep ,Chileans newspapers going and "our 
democratic friends" in pocket money. lf, in the name 
of democracy, the US was aiding the opposition in 
Chile against art elected government; was it also aid-? . 
ing,the press and the opposition under dictatorships 
ins Brazil, Greece. and Spain or the Soviet Union? It 
would be interesting to know. Is it helping the new 
opposition in Chile, where a police state has been 
constructed by,. the military junta? Kissinger claims 
that the US must not interfere in the internal affairs of 
others?even to encourage Soviet dissidents. 
If the issue was the nationalization by Chile of US 
foreign investments with inadequate.inderanification 
or none, why not admit it insiead of sermonizing 
about the opposition press and parties? WhY doesn't 
this "open administration" come clean? 
has carried the burden well. Moreover he has been 
sensitive to the rising opposition in this country to 
"a secret government" and has opened the hereto-
fore closed CIA window enough to provide the 
agency with a new image. If he can resist the tempta-
tion of introducing new legislation calling for 10-
year jail terms and $10,000 fines for anyone writing a 
book about the CIA, he will retain the admiration 
and high standing he so richly deserves.

Ex-Envoy to Chile 
Denounces Leaks 
Discrediting Aides

WASHINGTON, Oct. 22?The 
? director general of, the foreign 
service has expressed concern 
.in the State Department's 
newsletter about "malicious or 
calculated" leaks aimed at dis-
crediting high officials. ? ? 
.. Nathaniel Davis, former Ain-

regular column in ?the monthly 
newsletter that there were 
three kinds of leaks.

Mr. Colby had gone into 
considerable ' detail about' 
? C.I.A. operations in Chile 
at an informal session last

subcommittee headed . .by 
? Representative Lucien N. 
Nedzi, the Michigan Dem-
ocrat. The subcommittee was 
exercising its authority to 
eaersee C.I.A. operations.

however, the intelligence

covert operations.

EX-CIA OFFICER REPLIES. TO WTOP CRITICISM OF CIA 
ANNOUNCER: A recent WTOP editorial criticized the 
role of the Central Intelligence Agency in Chile during the 
'regime of President Salvador Allende. With an opposing view, 
here is Thomas Ernst. 
THOMAS ERNST: As a former CIA and U. S. Air Force 
dntelligence officer, I take issue with WTOP's recent editorial 
regarding the covert operations of the Agency. In my judgment 
WTOP erred in its criticism of the'Agency and in the covert 
nature of some of its activities. 
I believe the American people and most liberal 
critics of the CIA would support many of the follbwing'tovert 
operations, and I ask; would.WTOP object to a covert operation' 
designed to free black political prisoners in racist South 
Africa? Would WTOP object to secret activities directed 
against the. racist government of Rhodesia? If such covert 
-actioh would result in a bi-racial and black majority govern-
.ment in that country, I think not. 
Would most Americans, liberal or conservative, 
object .to CIA-directed operations in Southeast Asia to free 
,POWs and. MIAs? Again, I think not. Would WTOP and most Ameri-
cans object to covert operations designed to free Soviet 'Jews 
from that still oppressive country? I think not 
Who could object to Secret CIA. moves to capture or 
kidnap-Arab terrorists or PLO leaders who planned and'.ordered 
the Mahlot massacre? Hopefully, not WTOP. 
For these reasons I believe the majority of the Ameri-
can people should and do-support such CIA operations. In cl\%s-
ing, I ask WTOP to criticize the policy makers like Mr. Kissi,:ger, 
and I ask that it refrain from criticizing the CIA in its 
necessary secret operations- Thank you.

Uncovering the CIA: 
is congressional oversight needed? ? 
? By Editorial Research Reports 
The past two years have not been 
kind to the American intelligence 
community in general, and especially 
not to the Central Intelligence 
Agency. 
Tainted by Watergate, the CIA is 
taking it on the chin for having spent 
$8 million to "destalailize'! the Marx-
ist regime of Chile's late president, 
Salvador Allende, The Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee immediately 
launched an fnvestigation into the 
matter. ? 
In addition, Sens. Howard H. Baker 
(R) of Tennessee and Lowell P. 
Weicker (R) of Connecticut have 
introduced legislation to establish a 
14-member congressional oversight 
committee for all federal agencies 
with intelligence functions. These in-
clude not only the CIA but also the 
FBI, Secret Service, Defense In-
telligence Agency, and National Secu-
rity Agency. 
The idea of an intelligence over-
sight committee is hardly a new one. 
In s an extensive survey of the in-
telligence community in 1966, a team 
of New York Times reporters found 
that the "overwhelming consensus" 
of those interviewed was that Con-
gress should not attempt to "control" 
the' CIA through a special committee. 
It was felt such a panel "might 
-become anew intelligence empire on 
Capitol Hill that could exert a direct 
policy influence on the CIA separate 
?from and challenging the President's 
policy decisions." 
Covert activities 
If the CIA ?did nothing but gather 
and evaluate intelligence, It would 
have few critics. But the agency also

Mr McMahon's 
denial on 
CIA connexion 
From Our Correspondent 
Melbourne, Oct 7 
Mr William McMahon, the 
former Liberal Pritne Minister 
of Australia, denied today that 
his Government had authorized I 
the Australian Securityintelli-
gence Organization to cooperate 
with the American Central In-
telligence Agency in any activity' 
designed ? to overthrow the 
Allende Government in Chile. 
Mr McMahon said that there, 
was no 'truth in the, allegation 
(reported to have been made 
by an unnamed official in the - 
United States State Department) 
that the Australianintelligence 
organization had acted as a 
watchdog for the CIA in Chile. 
? The Liberal Government It, ? 
? 
abroad, and these occasionally have 
brought it into disrepute. The disas-
trous invasion of Cuba at the Bay of 
Pigs in 1961 is perhaps the classic 
example of a bungled CIA adventure, 
From time to time the agency's 
intelligence-gathering activities also 
cause embarrassment, as when the U-
2 spy plane was shot down over the 
Soviet Union in 1960. 
President Ford and Secretary of 
State Henry A. Kissinger both de-
fended the CIA's covert activities in 
Chile as in the best interests of that 
country as well as of the United - 
States. Others are not so certain. 
"Special operations pose dangers 
not only to the nations against which 
they are directed, but to ourselves,". 
wrote David Wise and Thomas B. 
Ross in "The Invisible Government," 
a book about the U.S. intelligence 
Community. "Thei,aise the question 
of how far a free socit. in attempt-
ing to preserve itself, emulate a 
closed society without bet. -..ning in-
distinguishable from it." 
Apprehension justified 
? The CIA's involvement in NS ver-
gate, limited and reluctant thoug it 
was, has raised questions about -i.e 
nature of the agency's activ!`it.3 
within the United States. Vic... r 
Marchetti and John D. Marks, a 
thors of a recent book about the CIA 
say that Americans are justified in 
feeling apprehensive. 
? "Nurtured in the adversary scling 
of the ? cold war," they. w:lte, 
"shielded by secrecy, and spurrec 
by patriotism that views dissent as 
threat to the national security, the 
clandestine operatives of the CIA 
have the capability, the resources, the 
experience - and the inclination - to 
ply their skills increasingly on the 
domestic scene." . ? 
The CIA's capacity to defend itself 
against such attacks is limited by its 
overriding need to operate in secret. 
To provide a detailed rebuttal might 
expose sensitive matters of national 
security. Still, the mover for greater 
congressional oversight of the CIA is 
gathering force and may become law. 
affairs of other nations. It 
would certainly have never 
countenanced activities whose 
object was to overthrow . the 
legally elected Government of 
Chile. . 
Mr McMahon also repudiated 
any ? suggestion that the CIA 
might have contributed funds 
to the Liberal Party genera)

made in a book entitled

Kissinger Assures India That A.Won't interfere! 
By BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Special to The New York Times 
NEW DELHI, Oct. 30 ? Sec 
retary of State Kissinger bluntl 
assured India today that th 
Central Intelligence Agenc 
would not interfere in the po 
litical situation here. . 
Mr. Kissinger, ending a three 
day visit to New Delhi, said 
at a news conference: "I rejec 
the implication that the United 
States is engaged on a sys-
tematic basis in undermining 
any government, and, particu-
larly, constitutional govern-
ments. Exactly the opposite is 
true." 
In making the comments be-
fore departing for Bangladesh, 
Mr. Kissinger sought to ease 
the persistent and expressed 
fears of Indian politicians, in-
cluding Prime Minister Indira 
Gandhi, that the C.I.A. was 
bent on subverting India. Amer-
ican officials-here have termed 
the fears obsessive and Mr. Kis-
singer was questioned several 
'times about the agency as well 
as United States involvement 
in the coup. 
? A year later, American news-
papers reported that the di-
rector of the intelligence agen-
cy, William E. Colby, had told 
Congress that the Nixon Ad-
ministration had authorized 
more than $8-million for covert 
activities ?by the agency in 
Chile between 1970 and 1973 in 
an effort to prevent the elec-
tion of Salvador Allende Gos-
sens as President after he was 
elected anyway, to make it 
impossible for him to govern. 
Dr. Allende died in the 1973 
0 coupe. 
Asked by several Communist 
newsmen about United States 
- involvement in the coups in 
y Chile, and last summer In 
e Cyprus, Mr. Kissinger replied: 
y ? "The United States did not 
- foment the overthrow of a ccin 
stitutional government in Chile 
- That has been made suffi 
ciently Plain by the President 
"Secondly, the United States 
had nothing whatever to do 
with the coup in Cyprus. This 
is simply repeating totally un-
founded propaganda. 
"Thirdly, the United States 
is not engaged, directly ,or in-
directly in any attempt to influ-
ence the domestic situation in 
India." 
Mr. Kissinger added: "It has 
not authorized such a program, 
it is not engaged in such a pro-
gram and it has repeatedly 
pointed out that if any of its 
officials should ever be caught 
? in unauthorized action, we 
_would take strong measures." 
'New Page' Turned 
Mr. Kissinger's visit to India 
has been widely applauded by 
Indian and American officials. 
The Secretary relaxed ?and 
seemingly cheerful at a crowd-
ed government auditorium, said 
that "a new page". had been 
turned in Indian-American re-
lations.i 
"In terms of the purpose 
that we set ourselves, which 
was to establish a basis for a 
new and mature relationship, 
I consider the trip completely 
successful," Mr. Kissinger said. 
He flew from here to Dacca, 
Bangdalesh, on a trip that will 
also take him to Pakistan, Af-

Mr. Kissinger's visit, at the 
behest of the Indian Govern-
ment and his first time here in 
three years, was largely de-
signed to lift relations between 
India and the United States. 
Resentments linger here over 
Washington's support for Pak-
istan before and during the 
1971 war that resulted in the 
Creation of Bangdalesh. 
'Also, many Indians view the 
$10-billion in United States eco-
nomic assistance to India in 
the nineteen-sixties as a sym-
bol of dependence and a soiree 
of American political leverage 
there. 
Americans See Hostility 
Americans often contend that 
the Indian Government has been 
hostile to the United States in 
recent years and has spent too-
much time lecturing and criti-
cizing successive United States 
Administrations whileignoring 
repressive tactics of the So-
viet Union, such as crackdowns 
on dissidents. 
t? Moreover, Indian comments 
that the United States seeks to 
exploit India's poverty political-
ly and economically have soured 
the relationship and annoyed 
Americans. 
Mr. Kissinger said today, 
'while discussing food aid to 
India, "I think one of the as-
pects of the relationship that is 
Ideveloping now between India 
iand the United States is that

Decision on Food Awaited

he returned to Washington-next

that India will receive about 
500,000 tons of food at-prefer-

'that by next summer the total

the establishment of a -United

A former United States spy 
turned Marxist, Philip Agee, 
Thursday moved to embarrass 
the Central Intelligence Agen-
cy (CIA) by making public a 
list said ? to be the agency's 
. operatives in Mexico. 
A book by Agee, to be pub-
lished here in January, tells of 
'his work ,with the CIA in Lat-
in America up to the time he 
resigned, disillusioned, in 
1969. 
Thursday he told a press 
conference held above a 
Fleet Street pub that he want-
ed to expose CIA officers and 
drive thdm out of the coun-
tries where they operated. 
He said his list of agency 
personnel in Mexico, under 
Station Chief Richard Samp-
son; was drawn up recently 
."by comrades who I trained 
to follow the comings and go-
ings of the CIA." 
? The 39-year-old writer, who 
now lives in southwest Eng-
land, attacked the agency as 
the "sectet political policy of 
American capitalism and the 
enforcer of economic ex-
ploitation."

DESPITE COLBY CLAIM, IT WASN'T AGENCY'S FINEST HOUR 
The CIA in Laos: 'An Equivocal Success' 
! 
B.Y CHARLES A. STEVENSON 
The Central Intelligence Agency doesn't 
brag very much, nor does it get many com-
pliments. With its reputation. tarnished by 
such misadventures as the Bay of Pigs and 
.secret support to opposition groups in 
Chile, the CIA is seldom credited for its po-
litical analyses and its intelligence on So-
viet weaponry. 
So it was somewhat unusual when CIA 
Director William E. Colby emerged from 
,the shadows in September to defend covert 
operations. And it was ironic that he decid-
ed to praise the "effective but modest man-
ner" in which the CIA operated in Laos. 
Over the past dozen years, he said, "a small 
commitment of CIA Americans and a small 
expenditure? had defended Laos so well. 
that the battle lines remain "essentially un-
changed." 
To a student of American policy in Laos, 
this was hardly a "small" effort. , 
The CIA spent about $100 million per 
year in Laos in the early 1970s ? an 
amount equal to about half of that small 
country's total gross national product in 
those years. Together with even larger. 
sums openly given in military and econom-
ic aid, U.S. assistance dwarfed the local 
economy, giving the United States a dom-
inating influence. 
CIA-financed Americans?probably num-
bering fewer than 1,000?supported, sup-
plied, advised, and in effect commanded a 
45,000-man army (at its peak) in a bloody, 
decade-long war. 
This struggle produced an estimated mil-
lion refugees and left uncounted civilian 
casualties. The Meo and other hill tribes, 
for whose benefit. and protection the CIA 
aided the conflict, saw their villages devas-
tated and their populations decimated. . 
Even U.S. air support, which dropped 21 
million tons of bombs during 1964-73, could 
not alter the outcome of the war?a 
stalemate. 
Whatever one's judgment on the magni-
tude of these efforts in Laos, the most ba-
sic question is what we want the CIA to 
do?and to be. 
When established by law in 1947, the 
CIA's chief purposes were "to correlate and 
evaluate intelligence" and to coordinate -the 
,various intelligence activities of the 
government. Authority for covert actions 
was derived from a catch-all clause allow-

where," a study of American policy toward 
Laos. 
..ing the CIA "to perform such other func-
tions and duties related to intelligence af-
fecting the national security as the Nation-
al Security Council may from time to time 
direct." 
Although Director Colby favors no re-
strictions on the CIA's ability to conduct 
covert operations, he did tell the Senate 
Armed Services Committee .last year that 
the agency "undoubtedly" went beyond 
.what Congress had intended by running 
the war in Laos: 
? This admission suggests that we should 
look more closely at the record before ac-
cepting the CIA's 'effective but modest" 
ac-
tions in Laos as a good example to follow. 
The CIA got a key role in Indochina on 
Aug. 20, 1954, when the National Security 
Council adopted a policy of "covert opera-
tions on a large and effective scale." 
Acting sometimes without the knowl-
edge or approval of the U.S. ambassador, 
CIA agents in Laos proceeded to bolster 
their own chosen factions as cabinets were 
'made and broken. 
According to U.S. personnel in Laos at 
the time, the CIA supported groups which 
brought down Prince Souvanna Phouma's 
.neiltralist coalition government in 1958 and 
almost succeeded in bringing down its suc-
.cessor in 1959. (This later attempt was 
foiled when the U.S. ambassador, unable to 
harness the CIA. obtained diplomatic sup.: 
port for his stand from other nations.) - 
In 1960, the CIA helped rig elections to 
. keep its clients in power. When an indigen-
ous, grass-roots military coup returned 
Souvanna Phourna to 'power later that 
year, the CIA continued monetary and 
material aid to its military friends, who 
sent rebel forces to oust the government. 
All the while, President Eisenhower and 
the U.S. ambassador proclaimed their sup-
port for Souvanna Phouma. 
' CIA assistance to the hill tribes, which 
had been organized into a 9,000-man army, 
also contributed to the breakdown of the 
1962 Geneva agreements on Laos, which 
had put Souvanna Phouma once again in 
charge of a coalition government. 
-As the conflict in-Vietnam intensified., 
the United States expanded its efforts in 
Laos and secretly aided the fighting there 
as a rear-guard action against the North 
Vietnamese. Said former Secretary of State. 
.Dean Rusk: "After 1963 Laos was only the 
wart on the hog Of Vietnam." 
The U.S. Air FOrce concentrated on the 
so-called Ho Chi Minh trails leading 
through Laos into South Vietnam, but it 
also bombed heavily in support of Laotian 
.units, the most aggressive and effective of 
.which were the CIA's clandestine army. - 
As the Meo were forced to rely more and 
more on preteen-age boys for soldiers, the 
CIA expanded its secret army with Thai 
."volunteers" Eventually these forces: num-
bered over 40,000 ? and could mot really 
be kept secret.. _ 
Some 'members of Congress and theiress 
had piecemeal knowledge of these activi-
ties, but they generally accepted the opera-
tions as a useful adjunct to the Vietnam 
war. 
Now, according to news reports, the 
CIA's presence in Laos has been greatly 
reduced. A new, shaky coalition govern-
ment has brought peace. 
A new mood is taking over in the United
States as well ? a rejection of the-cold 
War mentality of the 1950s, of unrestrained 
presidential power and of secret wars. 
Many people are beginning to question 
whether the President should have, in ef-
fect, a private army to use to intervene in 
other nations (often in their domestic polit-
ical affairs), with little it any accountability 
to Congress and the public. 
- Colby has justified covert CIA operations 
as the only choice "between a diplomatic 
protest and sending the marines." In Laos. 
however. other Options were available and 
used with some beneficial effect: suspend-
ing aid, soliciting international diplomacy 
or refusing to deal with certain self-pro-
claimed local governments. 
.These steps were at least open to.
public 
scrutiny, while the CIA's clandestine mani-
pulations and intervention were not. 
Secrecy tends to produce a moral blind-
ness toward the means, ends and conse-
quences of U.S. actions. In Laos. the CIA's 
'record of political interference' and of 
bloody, stalemated war can be judged, at. 
best, only an equivocal success.

.S. Said to Fear Lisbon Shift to Left 
By Miguel Acoca 
Special to The Washington-Post 
LISBON?Secretary s of 
, 
State Henry Kissinger, appar-
enUy skeptical of U.S. Ent-
bassy reports from here mini-
mizing the peril of a Commu-
nist takeover in Portugal, sent 
high-level intelligence and. dip-
lomatic experts to this Iberian 
:country recently to make inde-
pendent evaluations. 
Informed sources said that 
,Xissinger dispatched Lt. Gen. 
- 
k Vernon Walters, deputy direc-
tor of the Central Intelligence 
:Agency, to Lisbon in August 
'for a "personal appraisal." 
:The general, who speaks excel-
:lent Portuguese and is consid-
.ered a specialist on Portugal, 
;was in Lisbon from August 9 
to 12 for meetings with high 
government officials and se-
nior U.S. embassy staffers. 
The CIA would not com-
ment on the persistent reports 
sof Walters' visit, refusing even 
rto confirm that it took place. 
LA CIA spokesman said that 
,:the agency never comments 
;)on the travels of its top per-
;sonnet. 
1,, Two weeks ago, Kissinger 
sent a four-man State Depart-
; 
anent mission to Lisbon for 
still another independent re-
:view of Portugal's future 
:course, the sources said. The 
!group, headed by Alan Luk-
:ens, director of the depart-
ment's Iberian section, in-
'eluded Robert Ryan, a depart-
;ment monetary expert, and 
:Michael Samuels, an authority 
?on Portugal's African colonies. 
:The identity of the fourth mis-
sion member was not dis-
closed. 
The pro-Soviet Portuguese 
Communist Party has become 
;an important factor in Portu-
gal since the right-wing, pro-
:U.S. dictatorship which ruled 
Portugal for 48 years was de-

:Rau officers who have been 
running the country since 
Then have given the Commu-
nists a Cabinet post and full 
'participation in the country's 
new military-controlled gov-
ernment. Much of the strength 
and popularity of the Commu-
nists derives from their long 
.!underground fight against the 
+dictatorship, which had out-
lawed the party, ? 
: While . nothing could be 
!learned of the thrust of Wal-
.ters' report to Kissinger, 
sources said that the Lukens 
:group diverged from the em-
bassy's appraisal. The extent 
:of the differences was not dis-
closed, but sources said that 
the embassy's reporting had 
'grown more cautious as a re-
sult. 
; The sources said that Kise 
singer and others in Washing-
ton were obsessed with the 
lear that Portugal will be the 
:first country to go Communist 
,in what was called "a southern 
?Europe domino theory" also 
involving Spain, Italy and 
''Greece. This fear apparently 
has been fed by pessimistic in-
telligence assessments, press 
reports stressing the power of 
the left in Portugal, and the 
Anxieties of multinational 
'companies with interests in 
Portugal and its African colo-
nies. 
? Washington apparently 
fears that the emergence of 
the .Portuguese Communists 
following the fall of the dicta-
torship will be duplicated in 
!neighboring Spain, the last re-
maining pro-American rightist 
1 government in Western Eu-
rope. . ? 
_. Since his visit to Portugal, 
Walters has also been in Spain 
'for secret talks with high 
Spanish officials, the sources 
said. The CIA deputy direc-
tor's latest visit reportedly 
took place two weeks ago 
when he had a briefing on 
Portugal with senior Spanish-, 
military and civilian authori-
ties. 
Spanish and U.S. officials 
are known to be concerned by 
the potential for Communist 
- infiltration from Portugal,, 
which has a long and hard-to-1 
guard border with Spain. The' 
Communist Party has been1 
banned in Spain since the end 
of the civil war in 1939. but it 1 
has remained a major clandes-
tine political forge in indus-
-trial urban centers and the 
backbone of opposition to 
Generalissimo Francisco 
Franco. 
Another recent visitor to 
Spain was William 'Colby, the 
, CIA's director, but sources 
said that he had merely stop-
ped in Madrid on his way east. 
One source, however, pointed 
out that visits to Iberia by 
high 'U.S. intelligence official 
I could become more frequent 
because the Mediterranean 
has risen in U.S. priority. 
Many Portuguese rightists 
who fled following the popu-
list military coup in April are 
now living in exile in Madrid. 
Some have been heating a 
path to the U.S. embassy in 
Madrid to lobby for their 
views and to plead for help in 
presenting a Communist take-
over. 
Conservatives and moder-
ates still living in?Portugal are 
'also said to be seeking to in-
fluence the United States. 
Informed sources here said 
that during Walters' visit in 
August, he met with Gen. An-
torilo de Spinola, then provi-
sional president. At the time, 
Spinola, a conservative, was 
locked in a struggle for power 
18 
1 with populist Prerper Vasco 
Goncalves and the coordinat-
ing committee of the Armed 
Forces Movement. 
Spinola resigned Sept. 20 af-
ter failing to win a bid for 
one-man rule and martial-law 
powers. He sought to curb 
Communist activities and the 
leftist-controlled press and to 
increase his control over the 
decolonization of Portugal's 
African colonies. 
. Both U.S. and Portuguese 
government sources have pri-
vately confirmed Walters' 
meeting with Spinola, and a 
subsequent conference with 
Gen. Francisco da Costa Go-
mes, the armed forces chief 
who succeeded Spinola. 
? High-ranking revolutionary 
military officers have claimed 
repeatedly that there are at 
least 100 CIA agents operating 
in Portugal, striving to create 
"another Chile."

been in Portugal, reported ,in 
Atigust and September in the

BOOK BLOWS COVER 
CIA and Mexico: 
Close Association 
Leaves Red Faces 
BY STANLEY ME1SLER 
Timaa Staff Writer 
. MEXICO CITY?Both the. United' 
States and Mexican governments 
have been embarrassed recently by 
an accelerating serie,z of revelations 
about the work of the U.S. Central. 
Intelligence Agency in -Mexico. 
The revelations are far different 
from those 'about the CIA efforts in 
Chile to weaken the government of 
the late Salvador Allende. There has-
been no hint that the CIA is doing' 
anything to hurt the government of, 
President Luis Echeverria of ?Mexi-. 
Co and his ruling Party of the Insti-
tutional Revolution (PRI). In fact, 
the stories stress that there has been 
close cooperation between the Mexi-
can government and .the CIA.. That 
is what makes the revelations so em-
barrassing to Mexico, 
Though it won't be listed on any 
public agenda, a disens.s 10 n . of. 
changes in CIA personnel and per-
haps operation stemming from the 
'revelations will probably take up 
' some of the time of President Eche-
verria and. President Ford when 
they meet at the border towns-of 
No-
tales, Ariz., and Nagales? Sonora, 
-
next Monday. . 
The revelations- have come from -a 
former CU agent in Mexico, Philip 
B. F. Agee, who is now 'living in 
London. Publishers in London and 
Paris plan to publish his book, "In-
side the Company: A CIA Diary." in 
January. In advance of publication. 
Agee- has been talking with news-
men about the work of the CIA in 
Mexico and the rest; of Latin Ameri-
ca. These interviews have made the 
front pages of most Mexi-
can newspapers. 
In some ways, the reve-
lations have been less 
startling than the Mexican 
reaction to them. They 
have provoked confusion 
in government statements, 
recriminations among pol-
iticians, accusations and 
counteraccusations, and a 
campaign by some Mexi-
can journalists and polti-
cians to blame a good deal 
of Mexico's troubles on the 
CIA. 
.In an interview in Lon-
on in early October, Agee 
amed 35 agents within' 
he U.S. Embassy in Mexi-
o City and two others 
outside-. He said that Rich-
ard Sampson was the CIA 
station chief. in Mexico 
and that Jonathan Henke 
was his assistant. Both are 
classified officially as po-
litical officers of the em-
bassy. 
There were obvious er-
rors on Agee's list. One 
man listed had left the 
emb as sy a few months 
a go. Another, Winston' 
Scott, whom Agee identi-
fied as a former station 
chief now living in 
feigned retirement in 
Mexico, died a few years 
ago. 
Despite this, most inde-
pendent observers believe 
that the list is, in general, 
very accurate and up to 
date. The identity of most 
of the CIA agents within 
an embassy is usually an 
open secret, known both 
by other employes of the 
embassy and by outsiders, 
like American newsmen, 
who spend much time 
talking with embassy- offi-
cials. 
The-publication of. the 
list has .Put. the Mexican 
government in :a kind .of 
quandary. It is doubtful 
that .many of the Lames 
? surprise Mexican officials. 
Most of the CIA employes. 
listed were probably what 
are known in. the .diplo-
matic world as "revealed 
agents." . That term de-
scribes CIA agents, usual-
ly working in an embassy, 
whom the. I.T.S. govern-
ment identifies to afriend-
ly and cooperative govern-
ment. 
But the 'Mexican 
government does not want 
to be known as friendly, 
and cooperative to the 
CIA.' A few days after the 
list was published, a Mexi-
can delegation asked the 
Interparliamentary Union. 
meeting In Tokyo to con-
demn the interference by 
intelligence ? agencies in 
.the internal affairs Of oth-
er countries. The Mexi-
cans, however, cited .the 
CIA in Chile, not Mexico, 
as an example. 
? So ' 'far, the Mexican 
government has not ex-
pelted' any of those on the 
list. Asked about this at a 
news conference. P r e s-
Went Echeverria. in a 
mild and somewhat con-
fusing comment. said, "In 
regard to two or three of 
the people, we can never 
expel them from the coun-
try because they died 
some time ago. The others 
are officials' of the Ameri-
can Embassy who worked 
there publicly in different 
offices. 
? "This man (Agee) Was 
here. in 1968," ? Echeverra 
went on.. "and he had in-
terests, who knows why,

tions, and, curiously, he is 
very,. insistent about the

cdead people on the pub-
lished list. I believe that it

precise for me who is dead 
.and who works in. the 
American Embassy, 
? This is the present si-
tuation. We are going to 
invite this man to Mexico 
to help us find them." 
The reaction of the U.S. 
Embassy has been about 
what might be expected. 
When Agee's first revela-
tions came, U.S. Ambasa.7 
dor Joseph John Jova told . 
Mexican, newsmen, -"You' 
have to realize that ,Agee 
is a bitter, fired ex-em-
ploye. That's why you 
should take these things 
with a grain of ?salt." 
But once the list was 
published, ? the embassy

In early July, a U.S.

Agee denied this and said 
he had visited ebbe only

source later withdrew the 
accusation' but said "the. 
presumption is that he 
(Agee) was very forthcom-

any case, the source said 
the CIA. arranged some of 
its Latin American opera-

Cuba: - 
in his many press inter-

scribed -Mexico as an ex-

Coperations for the CIA., 
"Because of the strategic 
importance of Mexico to 
the United States, its size 
and proximity, and the 
abundance of enemy (i.e., 
Communist) activities, the 
Mexico City (CIA) station 
is the largest in the hemis-
phere," Agee has said. 
Agee has also character-
ized the 'relations between 
the CIA and the Mexican 
government as "exception-

station chief. But acrbfd-
ing to Agee this personal 
relationship with the CIA 
was broken when Eche-1 
verria took over the office 
of president in 1970. 
This disclosure has so 
upset the Mexican govern-
ment, Agee has said, that 
the Mexicans have tried to 
pressure his publishers to 
delete all references to 
Echeverria in the book. 
Besides naming the 
American agents within 
the U.S. Embassy, Agee 
has said that at least 50 
iMexican agents, working 
for the Americans, have 
infiltrated the Mexican 
government, t h e ruling 
party and other Mexican 
oianizations. 
The Ministry of the In-
terior issued a statement, 
saying, "The government 
of Mexico does not permit 
and will not permit activi-
ties in our territory by any 
foreign agency, no matter 
what its origin, that tries 
to interfere in our internal 
affairs:" The ministry 
promised an investigation 
of Agee's charges. 
? Although the govern... 
meat has not expelled any 
American on Agee's list of 
CIA agents, some Mexi-
cans have peen using the 
publicity over Agee's dis-
closures to blame many of 
Mexico's troubles on the 
CIA.

'? By Harry Rositzke 
'Special to the Star-News 
According to its author, "Without 
Cloak or Dagger" will set the record 
straight on CIA's remarkable success in 
its operations overseas, a "balanced 
and accurate" inside account to place 
against the dismal record of publicized 
failures and hostile exposes. It pro-
fesses to offer "the truth about the new 
espionage," though author Miles Cope-
land has stated that he left the CIA 
more than 17 years ago. 
It is a naive and unpersuasive per-
formance. 
, What emerges is the writer's main 
bent, as a schoolmaster. Apparently an 
,intelligence instructor in his early days, 
he refers frequently to training courses, 
curricula, and lectures. Like any good 
? teacher, he likes tidy rules and number-
edtoxes. 
THE MOST ludicrous example of 
the author's schematic approach is his 
model for "the ideal espionage opera-
tion." An agent is handled, through a 
Cutout,. by a principal agent who, 
through a cutout, trarrmits both in-
structions from and intelligence reports 
to a resident who in turn contacts his? 
"case-officer" ? five points of contact 
and possible exposure. Ideally, the 
case-officer handles only one agent, 
though elsewhere the author notes that 
the best case-officer is the busiest case-
officer. 
The author also has a flair for making 
flat statements that are wrong: 
About half the agents in the world 
have been recruited through their 
wives, and many agents are wives (this 
is a notion, IChrushchey tells us, shared 
by Stalin).

THE MURDER OF .CHE GUEVARA ACCORDING TO MARCHETTI AND MARKS 
Athena EPIKAIRA in Greek 5 Sep 74 PP 32734, 41 
ifext7 EPIKAIRA starts today the exclusive publication of 
1-he most revealing document that has ever come to light on 
the activities of the American CIA. It concerns the book 
"CIA and the Cult of Intelligence" by Victor Marchetti and 
John Marks, two former CIA senior officials. 
The things revealed in the 1.400 pages of the Marchetti and 
Marks book are truly shocking; so much so that the CIA tried 
through every legitimate and illegitimate means to prevent 
its publication. When the CIA found out that it could not 
stop publication, it resorted-to the courts and asked for? 
the deletion of 368 "hot" paragraphs which referred to 
specific persons and events. Publication was delayed for 
over a year. Finally, the courts "cut" 168 paragraphs and 
allowed the other 200 to go through. From the very first 
week of publication the book became an instant best-seller 
in the United States, the first book in American history to. 
have been censored before publication. 
In the two chapters published today by EPIKAIRA, the, authors 
reveal how the CIA developed into such a powerful agency 
that operates beyond the law, and CIA's involvement in the 
capture and execution of Che Guevara in 1967 in Bolivia. 
CIA: Above and Beyond the Law 
A powerful and dangerous cult is currently prevalent throughout the United 
States--a cult which holds spying as its god. The saints of this cult are 
the professional agents of the CIA. Its patrons and protectors are the 
highest officials in the federal government. Its membership which extends 
beyond government circles includes leading personalities in industry, commerce, 
finance and labor. Its friends are many in all those sectors which exert 
significant influence on public opinion, the academic world and the media. 
The cult constitutes a secret fraternity of the American political elite. 
The CIA is both the center and the main instrument of this cult. Its task 
is intelligence and counter-intelligence, propaganda and nprovocatsia"--
the deliberate distribution of false information--psychological warfare 
and paramilitary actions and activities. It infiltrates and manipulates 
private institutions, it even establishes its own organizations?known as 
"companies"--when this becomes necessary. It recruits agents and mercenaries. 
It bribes and blackmails foreign leaders to carry out the most malodorous 
objectives. It uses any means to accomplish those goals, without any 
reservations as to the methods used or as to the moral consequences of its 
activities. The CIA's most potent weapon is its covert intervention in the 
internal affairs of countries the American government wishes to control or 
influence. 
The Presidents Lie 
The cult insists on directing the US governmental affairs without informing 
the people and without public participation. It does not accept any checks 
on its activities from the legislative bodies or the press. Its followers 
believe that they alone have the right and the obligation to decide what 
is needed to serve the national interest. 
The "mentality, of secrecy" is cultivated in a climate of illegality and 
fraud. It encourages professional amoralism--the belief, that right 
objectives may be achieved by unholy and normally unacceptable means. In 
this way, the leaders of the cult keep their official activities out of

public view with constant vigilance. 
Whenever necessary, the members of the cult--including the presidents of 
the United States who always know, generally approve and often inspire the 
more significant CIA operations--have lied without shame to protect the 
secret service and to conceal their own responsibility for its actions. 
The Eisenhower administration lied to the American people on the CIA 
involvement in the Guatemala coup in 1954, on its support to the unsuccess-
ful uprising in Indonesia in 1958 and on the mission of Gary Powers with 
the U-2 spy plane over Russia in 1960. 
The Kennedy administration lied on the CIA role in the unsuccessful 
invasion in Cuba in 1961 and confessed its involvement only after the 
catastrophic failure of that operation. 
The Johnson administration lied on the extent of the American commitments 
to Laos and Vietnam and totally concealed the role of the CIA. 
The Nixon administration, too, lied on the CIA attempt to "manipulate" 
Chile's election in 1970. 
For the cult followers, 4ynocricy and deceit as well as secrecy are the 
,sacred methods used to prevent the public from learning about the CIA's 
secret operations and to avoid any accounting on those operations by the 
American government. 
Blunders and Luck 
The absolute secrecy surrounding the CIA's activities has resulted--and 
continues to do so--in keeping the public from even imagining how many 
times the agency has failed. In the sector of classic syping, the CIA's 
secret services have failed dismally in their efforts to infiltrate their 
major targets. The Penkofsky affair, in the early 1960s--the only intelli-
gence operation against the Soviets for which the CIA can be proud--was 
just a "lucky break" due entirely to the British Intelligence Service. 
The widely-advertised operation of the Berlin tunnel in the middle 1950s--
in reality it was a giant wiretapping network?resulted in meager gains 
in terms of significant information that could be of use to the CIA brain-
trust. The true value of that operation lay in the embarrassment it 
caused to the KGB and the favorable publicity it brought to the CIA. Not 
.a single intelligence success was scored against China. 
The CIA secret services were more successful in counter-intelligence than 
in the sector of classic spying. But even in this case, the successes are 
mostly due to luck. Most successes were not due to CIA spies but to the 
good offices of escapees who divulged all they knew in exchange for gaining 
safety for themselves. 
In the CIA's favorite sector of covert activities, the Operatives scored 
their greatest successes but it is also true that their blunders and 
failures often very seriously embarrassed the United States. 
Specifically, the CIA played a basic

Some of its "successes," however, boomeranged and hit the American govern-
ment itself. It is hard to understand how the CIA braintrust failed to 
realize that it would have been more prudent for the agency not to get 
involved in Guatemala, Cuba or Chile, to avoid its secret role in Iran or 
in other parts of the Middle East and to avoid getting so deeply involved

the CIA became involved and the American nation has to live with the 
consequences of those activities. 
More recently, the Watergate investigation revealed some of the CIA secret 
operations within the U3 itself and presented a terrifying picture of the 
methods used by the CIA for so many years in other countries. Its assis-
tance to the White House "plumbers" and the attempt to put all the blame 
for the cover-up on the CIA revealed to the American public the dangers' 
involved for a democracy in an inadequately controlled secret intelligence 
agency. The issue is simple: Should the CIA operate in keeping with its 
original objectives--as a coordinating agency responsible for gathering, 
evaluating and processing information for the perusal of the appropriate 
officials as they formulate government policies--or should it be allowed 
to operate in this fashion for so many years as a secret instrument of the 
White House and of a clique of powerful individuals who are not subject 
to accounting for their actions and whose main objective is interfere 
in the internal affairs of other countries--and possibly of the United 
States as well--through agents, propaganda, covert paramilitary interventions 
and all kinds of dirty tricks? 
Hunting Che in Bolivia 
When Ernesto "Che" Guevara disappeared from the political stage in Cuba in 
the spring of 1965 nobody could give a specific explanation. Some reports 
said that the Argentine revolutionary, a physician and a comrade-in-arms 
of Fidel Castro, had challenged the authority of the Cuban leader and that 
he had been imprisoned or executed as a result. Other reports claimed that 
Guevara had lost his mind and with no hope of recovery he had been confined 
to a country villa in one of Cuba's provinces. Some other reports said that 
Che had formed a band of devoted followers and had left Cuba to start 
another revolution somewhere else. 
At first the people in the CIA did not know what to believe. But gradually 
some information on Guevara's whereabouts began to filter in from the CIA 
field stations. The clues were loose and imprecise but they all seemed 
to point to Africa. In the Republic of the Congo (today's Zaire) another 
uprising had broken out and the reports from the CIA agents there indicated 
the presence of foreign revolutionaries. Some of their methods and tactics 
revealed Guevara's unique style. But the uprising fizzled out suddenly 
before one could verify those reports. By the fall of 1965 that area was 
calm again. But the CIA mercenaries--some of them "Bay of Pigs" veterans--
who assisted the Congolese government in putting down the uprising were 
convinced, and so were their superiors in Washington, that Che was indeed 
in that area. 
It was later.that the CIA learned that Che Guevara and a band of over. 100 
-revolutionaries had slipped into the Congo from neighboring Tanzania in 
the spring of 1965. Their objective, was to spark a general uprising in 
Africa but their revolutionary zeal found no worthy imitators among the 
native guerrillas and the local population. "Disillusioned, Che returned ? 
secretly 6 months. later to Cuba to make plans for his next adventure At 
that time, however, all that the CIA knew wasthat he had disappeared again. 
Once again conflicting reports regarding his role, his health, etc, began 
to reach the CIA. In early 1967, reports reaching the agency pointed to 
the heart of South America--to Bolivia. 
Mary of the: CIA officials in charge of secret operations were convinced 
that Guevara was the brain behind the guerrilla movement in Bolivia's 
southern mountains but some of the CIA top leaders were reluctant to 
agree. In spite of this climate of doubt, come CIA special operations 
agents were sent to Bolivia to assist the local forces in their' fight 
against the guerrillas. Ironically, not even the then president of Bolivia,. 
Rene BarrientosIbelieved that-Guevara was involved in the guerrilla move-
ment. 
Two months later, in April 1967, two events dramatically reaffirmed the 
belief of the CIA agents in Bolivia as well as in the CIA headquarters

that Guevara was the leader of the guerrillas. At the beginning of the 
month, a unit of the Bolivian army caputred the guerrilla base in Nanda-
chausu fEransliteration7 where they found a wealth of documents, pictures 
and diaries left by the guerrillas as they fled. Included in the material 
seized by the army were pictures of a slightly balding gray-haired man 
with glasses who bore a striking resemblance to Guevara, as an exhaustive 
study of the pictures revealed. Moreover, two fingerprints seemed to 
resemble those of Guevara. The documents further revealed that some of the 
guerrillas operating in Bolivia were Cubans, possibly the same individuals 
that had gone to the Congo with Guevara. 
Ten days later, the French leftist journalist Regie Debre was arrested 
near Muupamba /transliteration7 together with two other foreigners who 
were suspected ofhaving contacts with the guerrillas. Debre had disappeared 
a few months after he had cone to Bolivia to collect material for a geo-
political study. As he stated several months later, Debre escaped 
execution thanks to the intervention of the CIA operatives who accompanied 
the Bolivian forces which arrested him. Those CIA agents later showed him 
certain confidential data which convinced him that the CIA knew much more 
about his activities abroad and especially in Bolivia than he could ever 
imagine. Debre initially refused to admit that he knew anything at all 
about Guevara's involvement in the guerrilla movement. But soon he gave 
in and started talking in an effort to save himself from being tried and 
executed. 
The clues were coming in fast. But the CIA director, Richard Helms, 
continued to refuse to believe that the legendary revolutionary had indeed 
appeared again and that he was leading another revolt. Helms derided the 
reports of the field agents who claimed to have in their hands prel)f of 
Guevara's presence in Bolivia. Helms was of the opinion that Guevara 
was probably dead. 
But Thomas Karamesinis, chief of secret operations in the CIA at that time, 
who had presented the case to.Helms, did not give up his conviction that his 
agents were on Guevara's trail. Other CIA "advisors," some of them Bay of 
Pigs veterans, were soon dispatched to Bolivia to help in tracking down 
Guevara. A group of specialists from the American Army Special Forces came 
to La Paz from the Canal Zone to train Bolivian commandos in anti-guerrilla 
warfare. 
The-secret services were obsessed with Guevara, and in a way they were 
afraid of him. He was a constant, irritating reminder of their Day of Pigs 
failure. Unable to vent their anger on the American officials who had 
undertaken that desperate operation, and without any possibility of getting 
even by destroying Castro himself or his Soviet or Chinese allies-, the 
CIA Secret Services continued to deplore their failure--until the reappear-
ance of Guevara offered a provocative target to the CIA. His arrest or 
death would give the CIA an opportunity to take revenge for past failures. 
.A$14,200 Reward 
In the summer of 1967, while the men of the CIA Special Operations division were 
helping the Bolivian army in its pursuit of Guevara, reports came in regarding 
the way he had entered Bolivia. It was made known that he had arrived in La Paz 
in Noverber 1966 from Havana by way of Prague, Frankfurt and Sao Paolo, traveling 
with a false Paraguayan passport and disguised as a bald, gray-haired bespectacled 
merchant?totally different from his familiar appearance on posters, Fifteen 
other Cubans had preceded him to help him with the Bolivian operation, 
There was no longer any doubt that Che Guevara was in Bolivia, leading the 
guerrilla movement in the country's southern region. The Bolivian govern-
ment offered a reward of $41200 for Che Guevara--dead or alive. Now his 
extermination was only a matter of time. 
In the following months the guerrillas met one defeat after another at the 
hands of the Bolivian commandos who had been trained by the Americans and

were assisted by CIA advisors. One encounter on the last day of August 
ended with the death of the mysterious Tania, the only woman in Guevara's 
guerrilla band. Although she appeared as a Cuban secret agent, a liaison 
between the guerrillas and Havana, it was at last revealed that this East 
German woman was in reality a double agent. Her main employer was the 
Soviet KGB which--like the CIA--wanted to keep an eye? on the Cuba-financed 
revolutionary activities of Guevara in Latin America. Less than 6 weeks 
later, on 8 October, Guevara himself was wounded and captured near the 
small mountain village of La Biguera. 
,As with Debre earlier, the CIA advisors who were with the Bolivian aliv 
tried to bring Guevara alive back to La Paz for an in depth investigation. 
.But the commander of the Bolivian units had orders to execute him. The 
only proof he had to bring back was the head and the hands--irrefutable 
proof that Guevara was dead. 
While the CIA advisors were trying. to delay the Bolivian colonel, the 
chief of the CIA field station in La Paz was trying to persuade President 
Barrientos of the long-term advantages to be gained by having Guevara moved ? 
.from the mountains to the capital as the government's prisoner. But 
.Barrientos was adamant. He claimed that Dare's case had caused him enough 
headaches and Guevara's arrival at the capital alive night possibly set off - 
demonstrations by university students and leftists--demonstrations that the 
'government might find impossible to contain. - 
Desperate, the field station chief turned for help that same evening to 
the CIA headquarters at Langley but to no avail. Convinced that neither 
the field station nor the Washington headquarters could convince Barrientos, 
,the CIA chief agent at La Higuerammade.an effort to interrogate Che. 
But the revolutionary did not appear willing to 000perate. He was willing 
to talk about political philosophies and the revolutionary movements in 
_general but he refused to give any information on the details of his 
Bolivian operation or on his previous activities in other areas. The CIA 
had to be content With his personal diary which he carried at the time of 
his arrest. 
Che 16 Executed 
The final decision came from the capital early the next morning. The 
prisoner was to be executed on the Spot and his body, tied to the landing 
gear of a helicopter, was to be transferred to Villagrande for identifica-
tion by a small group of journalists and government representatives. Then 
the body was to be buried in a nameless grave outside the city. As soon 
as the CIA agent learned of this order...rushed to the school building 
where Guevara was being held and made a last attempt to interrogate the 
prisoner. There was not much time left. The execution would.take place 
in a couple of hours. 
Guevara' s last moments are described in a rare, moving report sent by the 
agent to the CIA headquarters. The Cuban, a veteran CIA liaison officer, 
remarked that Guevara was certain at the beginning that somehow he was 
going to come out alive from this ordeal. But when he finally realized 
that he was about to die, his pipe slipped from his mouth. But soon he 
regained his composure and asked for some tobacco. His painful leg wound 
seemed no longer to bother him. He accepted his fate with a stoic sigh, 
without asking for any last favor. The 5gent7...apparent1y felt admiration 
and compassion for the man whose capture and aecution he had aided. A 
few minutes later Che Guevara was dead. 
The following summer Che's diary appeared suddenly and quickly reached the 
hands of his comrades in Havana and some of his American admirers--the 
magazine RAMPARTS--which immediately verified its authenticity and began 
its publication, to the great discomfort of the CIA and of the Bolivian 
government which had made public only those parts which supported their 
charges against Guevara and his guerrillas. In the confusion of conflicting 
accusations, Antonio Arguentas, the Bolivian minister of interior, 
disappeared in July while an orgy of rumors identified him as the in 
who had given the diary for publication. As minister of interior, Arguentas

was the chief of the Bolivian Secret Service, which had close ties with 
the CIA. Arguentas himself was a CIA agent. 
It soon became known that Arguentas had escaped to Chile where he intended 
to seek political asylum. But the Chilean authorities delivered Arguentas 
to the CIA field station and the agent who was initially his superior 
was immediately dispatched from the Washington CIA headquarters to bring 
him back to his senses. But in spite of the CIA admonitions, Arguentas 
continued to speak in public against the CIA and its activities in Bolivia. 
He denounced the Barrientos reglme as an instrument of American imperialism, 
criticized the government for its handling of the Guevara case and then 
he disappeared again, causing a serious political crisis in Bolivia. During 
1968, Arguentas appeared from time to time in London, New York and Peru. 
Sometimes deriding and sometimes threatening the CIA agents in every field 
station who were trying to keep him from talking, the former minister 
confessed that he was the one who made Che's diary public. He claimed that 
he didso because he agreed with the motives of the revolutionary and with 
his effort to impose popular social, political and economic changes in 
Bolivia and in the other countries of Latin America. In the end, to the 
consternation of the CIA and the Barrientos government, he revealed that 
he had been a CIA agent since 1965 and that some other Bolivian politicians 
were also included in the CIA's payroll. He described the circumstances 
of his recruitment and he revealed that the CIA had threatened to disclose 
his radical past as a university student and thus destroy his political 
career if he did not agree to become an agent. Finally the CIA came to 
some agreement with Arguentas who returned voluntarily to Bolivia--
apparently to stand trial. 
During the flight from Lima to La Paz, Arguentas told a NEW YORK TIMES 
reporter that in the event "something happened" to him, a tape recording 
with all his charges against the CI 1 and the Barrientos government would 
be delivered to certain persons in the United States and in Cuba. The 
tape, he said, was in the custody of Lieutenant Mario Teran. Strangely, 
Teran had been previously identified as the man who executed Guevara. 
In his interview, Arguentas hinted at the extent of his potential revela-
tions by disclosing the names of several CIA officials with whom he had 
worked together in the past: Hugo Murrey, field station chief, John 
Hilton, former field station chief, Larry Sternfield and Nick Lendiris. 
He also revealed the identity of some CIA liaison officers who had assisted 
in the capture of Guevara: Joli Gabriel Garcia, a Cuban, and Edie and 
Mario Gonzales, Bolivians. Arguentas also stated that the Gonzales brothers 
had saved Debre's life. He claimed, however, that Barrientos and even the 
American ambassador did not know the full extent of the CIA's infiltration 
into the Bolivian government. 
The last act of the story was written the following summer, almost 2 years 
after the death of Che Guevara. President Barrientos was killed when his 
helicopter crashed on his return from a tour. Six weeks later, Antonio 
Arguentas, by his own admission a CIA agent who was to be tried for treason 
and for the publication of the Guevara diary, was murdered in one of La 
Paz' narrow back streets. A month later, Herbert? Rojas, the guide of the 
Bolivian commandos and of their CIA advisors in the search for Guevara 
and one of the very few people who probably knew where the revolutionary 
leader was buried, was murdered in Santa Cruz. 
The tapes with the incriminating evidence, which Arguentas claimed to have 
entrusted to Mario Texan, disappeared.

Ford, Moscow and Pekin 
WASHINGTON 
By Jarnes Reston 
-WASHINGTON, Oct. 26?The 'rela-
tions between the United States and 
,both the Soviet Union and China have 
.changed in subtle ways since Presi-
;dent Ford moved into the White Hotise. 
Washington's 'policy toward the two 
major Communist states remains the 
'Same, but Moscow - and Peking are 
'rbeing very cautious about Mr. Ford, 
:who is a new figure on the world 
'stage, and they are wondering what 
:he's like, how long he will last and 
vwho will succeed .him. 
, All the civilities and diplomatic 
courtesies of the last couple of years 
were extended "to Secretary of State 
Kissinger in his latest mission to Mos-
cow, but progress toward the control 
-of nuclear arms was slight_at best, and 
for obvious reasons. 
Any really serious agreement to end 
the nuclear arms race could not begin 
to be effective for two or three years, 
and it would limit freedom of action, 
for the major nuclear powers there-
after, but who would be President of 
the United States in three years? Mr. 
Ford, whom the Soviets don't know, 
or maybe even "Scoop? Jackson, the 
:Democratic Senator from Washington, 
,who is regarded in Moscow with al-
most as much suspicion as Mao Tse-
'lung and Chou- En-lai. 
So there is a pause now in talks 
among representatives of the big con-
tinental and nuclear nations. Nobody 
knows what is going to happen after 
the departure of Gerald Ford in Wash-
ington or the aged leaders in Peking. 
.They are all willing to meet but not 
'to decide, and particularly not to lock 
themselves into long-range policies for 
a future nobody can foresee. 
There is another change in the re-
cent propaganda of both Moscow and 
Peking. They seldom agree these days 
in their relations with one another, but 
-lately they have been agreeing about 
the economic crisis 'in the capitalist" 
world. Both have been dramatizing 
the problems of inflation in Europe, 
the Unitecb.States and Japan; the crises 
Of colonialism in Portugal; the transi-
tion from fascism to monarchy in 
Spain. 
Both have also been supporting the 
Arab oil states against the industrial 
capitalist states and seeing in the "en-
ergy crisis" a new economic oppor-
tunity to weaken the free world, and 
'-a new strategic opportunity to block-
ade Europe, Japan, and even the United 
States at the, source of their oil and 
:industrial power in the Middle East. 
Leonid I3rezhnev, by all reports, was 
very tough on Mr. Kissinger in Mos-
cow. He was bitter about Senator 
Jackson's insistence on the immigra-
tion of 60,000 Jews a year from the 
Soviet Union to Israel and astonished 
that Mr. Jackson would be allowed to 
Rome out on the White House steps 
And define, inaccurately, the compro-
mise. Mr, Kissinger was furious about 
this and President Ford ignored it at 
? 
first and finally had to correct it, bu 
Mr. Kissinger had to deal with thi 
confusion when he got to Moscow. - 
President Ford, out campaigning fo 
Republicans in Congress, is not reall 
putting his Mind to this world prob 
lem. He is looking for Republican seat 
in the House and Senate, and arguin 
that somehow this will help deal wit 
these larger world questions. n 
The truth is that even his own Cab 
inet, which is also trying to deal wit 
.iflation, the balance of payments, th 
Russians and the Chinese, thinks tha 
? he is not only wasting his time bu 
_ is raising doubts about his judgment. 
In the next two or three years, the 
? leadership of the United States. Chin 
_ and probably the Soviet Union, i 
going to pass from the old generatio 
to the new. In the United States, i 
may .pass fromnGerald Ford to Nelson 
Rockefeller, to Henry Jackson, or even 
? to a third-party conservative coalition 
of Ronald Reagan and George Wallace. 
In China, it may even pass from the 
anti-Soviet leadership of Mao Tse-tung 
and- Chou En-lai to a new military 
junta that will revive the Soviet-
Chinese Communist alliance agains 
? the West, 
Nobody knows, so everybody ; is 
waiting. Mr. Kissinger hoped when' he 
came to Washington that he was going 
to define. and organize arrangements 
? for the coming world, but it is not 
working out exactly as he had hoped. 
There is no political, economic or 
financial stability in the world today. 
Last year, it seemed that the major 
powers were coming together on the 
control of arms and the avoidance of 
? war, and they are still trying to do so. 
But on the problems of food, energy 
and population, and on the organiza-
tion of a new order of the world, they 
are still deeply divided. 
In fact, the political trend now is 
toward division and confrontation. The 
Communists are seeking economic dis-
array of the capitalist world as con-
firmation of their Marxist prophecies. 
The Jacksons and Reagens in America 
are swinging American politics toward 
nationalism and anti-Communism, and 
the Russians and Chinese are watching 
all this with their usual skepticism. 
The result is that no big deals abotit 
disarmament or anything else are like-
ly to be made in the next few years 
with either the Russians or the Chi-
nese or even the Europeans: They know 
that American power in the world is 
probably decisive, both economically 
and militarily, but they don't know 
how President Ford is going to use 
that power or who is going to succeed 
him. 
So the Russians have been polite 
with Mr. Kissinger in Moscow, and the 
Indians will probably also be polite in 
the next few days, and so will the 
Chinese when he goes to Peking later 
on. But nobody is in a mood now to 
make any long-range commitments: 
We are now in a holding operation for 
the next few years. waiting to find out 
who is going to come after the tem-
porary leaders who now preside over 
the major capitals of the world.

Communists 
djust, for 
Power's Sake 
By? ANDRE FONTAINE 
PARIS?Lenin in his day- denounced the treason 
of the Social Democrats and broke with them be-
cause they rejected what he saw as inescapable re-
course to violence and instead 'accepted "class col-
laboration." What would he say today? seeing the 
Communist parties of the Latin part of Europe set 
out, one after the other, on the very road? he 
condemned? 
The French Communist party has just held In a' 
Paris suburb an extraordinary congress, the first in 
its history. Its objective was to turn into durable 
strategy, not to say doctrine, the political line that 
has led to its alliance with the Socialist party and 
aims to gain power legally, even if it is shared. The 
French Communist chief, Georges Marchais, does nth 
hesitate to reduce to mere "nuances" the past dis-
agreements of his party with Charles de Gaulle to 
be able to invite "the authentic Gaullists" to join, 
the union of the left. 
The Italian Communist party is going even further. 
While in France it is a case of having the right 
beaten by the left, the Communists of the Itailan 
peninsula are campaigning for an "historical corn-
promise" with the Christian Democrats in order to. 
avert a threat to existing freedoms posed from the 
extreme right. 
The same game is played by the Spanish Com-
? munist party, now reconciled with the Kremlin after 
a long quarrel. The party's boss, Santiago Carillo,' 
has taken up contacts in almost all quarters, includ-
ing the army.-And, together with Rafael Calvo Serer, 
.the Catholic and monarchist who was one of the 
founders of the famous Opus Dei and one of the 
pillars of the Franco regime, he has constituted a' 
"junta of national union" which aspires to govern 
the country after the Caudillo has left the scene. 
Finally in Portugal, the Communist party is al-
ready partaking in power through its Secretary 
General, Alvaro Cunha!, back from a long exile in 
Prague immediately after the fall of the Caetano' 
regime. In a short time he has become the principal 
political force in the country and has officially 
rejected all references to "the dictatorship of the 
proletariat," a notion going back to Marx and as 
fundamental to Leninist thought as that of class 
struggle. 
The Rise of the 'Maoists' 
As always when an extreme left movement 
modifies its political line, a more eXtremist move-
ment arises on its left. That is the case in all four 
countries. In France, the radicalism that had its high 
point in May, 1968, appears to have lost ground 
since and the "Maoists" are now only a handful. 
But "gauchiste" influence has much increased inside 
of the rejuvenated Socialist party. 
In Italy and in Portu 
94)3tOgetitgiiik8i6Wg 2001/a/08 : 
is surfacing. Particularly in Lisbon, there is not a 
day when the radical press does not denounce 
"revisionist" compromises. In Spain, the clandestine 
nature of politics does not permit a clear idea of the 
balance of forces,, but a Marxist-Leninist party 
favorable to the Peking's ideas does exist, especially 
among the Basque separatists responsible for the 
!assassination of Premier Carrero Blanco. These 
groups do not hesitate to resort to armed action. 
It is significant that the 'softening of the Com-
munists' doctrinal positions comes when everywhere 
in Mediterranean Europe they are closer to power 
and in Portugal share it already. Violen8e does not 
seem necessary when the inability of capitalist states 
to face world economic crises and social imbalances 
is leading a growing number of voters to put faith 
in those who promise them a society, at once more? 
equitable and more rational. 
, Elementary tactical intelligence should thus suf-
fice to lead the Communist parties to adopt a 
moderate line that respects existing institutions. But 
doubtless there is more: The party workers and 
Communist leaders?it is enough to watch them in 
the flesh to be convinced of this?have not escaped 
the sociological changes of the Western countries. 
The time of the robots remote-controlled from Mos-. 
tow, if it ever existed, died with the myth of Stalin-
?ist infallibility. It is, incidentally, manifest that in 
the East there is too much need for Western tech-
nology and capital for there to be much encourage-
ment for violent adventures: The Chilean tragedy is 
still too much in the minds of all the Communist 
leaders, and who knows how the United States 
would react? 
The Americans, it would seem, find themselvess-
embarrassed by ? the erosion of their positions. in 
Mediterranean Europe. For having recklessly bet on - 
regimes cut off from all popular root., they lost, 
two vital bridgeheads. Admittedly Portugal has 
? stated its intention to remain in NATO, in 
spite of the presence in its governmeet of a Com-
munist Deputy Premier. As to Greeceeif it has left 
:NATO, like France it remains a member of the At-
lantic alliance, and the vigor with which the Com-
munists are denouncing as premature the Greek 
elections scheduled for November confirms the im-
pression that they have little chance -of winning 
,more than 15 per cent of the seats. However, in 
-both cases, the Soviet Union has applauded the 
downfall of dictatorships while the United States 
? cannot wield as much influence on the new teams-
as it did over the old. 
If, added to this, the precarious situation on Cy-
prus is taken into account, where the local Commun-
ist party can take advantage of the idea prevalent on 
the island that it was the Central Intelligence Agency 
that encouraged the coup against Archbishop 
Makarios, the balance sheet appears negative for the 
United States. The United States would be wrong, 
though, to view those events. through the spectacles 
of the Cold War. Much as the Eastern Communist 
regimes are keeping their distance vis-a-vis the 
Soviet model, the West European parties are dif-
ferentiating themselves as they approach power and 
ally themselves with other political groupings. 
It is significant that in France, where the current 
in favor of the left has been so powerful over the 
last 18 months, the Communist party has regressed 
rather than progressed in elections, whereas the So-
cialist party?supposed to he its "hostage" according 
to government spokesmen?has registered a specta-
cular advance. This means that the memories of the 
Stalin .era and of the .invasion of Czechoslovakia 
still weigh on the image of the French Communist 
party. Perhaps it cannot enlarge its area of influence 
without establishing more clearly the distance be-
tween itself and the superpower of which it used 
to proclaim itself the unconditional ally. If that day 
came, many things would change, not only in France 
but in all of Europe, perhaps inclusive of the Europe 
east of the Iron Curtain,

FOREIGN AFFAIRS' 
By C. L. Sulzberger 
PARIS?The most urgent task Henry 
Kissinger has set himself on his cur-
? rent diplomatic foray is moving the 
-Cyprus crisis along the path to 
.peaceful settlement, thereby healing a 
.aerious breach in NATO. The under-
taking's magnitude may not compare 
with the ultimate goals -sought in 
sontinued talks with Russia; but the 
immediate dangers of failure are great. 
Mr. Kissinger's efforts to get some 
Motion on Cyprushave been delayed 
by two things. First, the United Statas 
Congress sought to impose a handicap 
on Presidential policy-making by 
'abrupt termination of aid to Turkey. 
This would have removed a principal 
:trump from the Secretary of State's 
hand as he began negotiations. Even 
now he has very limited leeway but 
? -at least he is not in a position of 
appearing to be an outright bully to 
the Turks, something he must avoid. 
The second obstacle has been 
Turkey's failure to replace the Ecevit 
Government after it resigned. Mr. - 
Ecevit's widespread popularity, stem-
ming from the landings in Cyprus, 
?'nevertheless hasn't yet enabled him 
-to make a deal with other party 
leaders and his parliamentary backing 
-remains a minority pending next 
:spring's elections. 
Thus, curiously, the politic 's of 
Turkey where a strongman seemed 
ato be emerging, have proved to be a 
,greater hurdle than the politics of 
Greece, where an entire system of 
'government has been replaced. Mr. 
Kissinger desperately hopes to see a 
new Turkish Cabinet formed under 
.Mr. Ecevit within the next few days 
_so he can include Ankara--and perhaps 
-Athens?on his forthcoming schedule 
-and pull Cyprus away from the brink. 
, No contemporary Greek leader save 
:Constantine Caramanlis, the provi-
sional Premier running for formal 
;leadership in the Nov. 17 elections, 
_Ithe first in many years, has the 
? eastrength and prestige to get a sensible 
_deal with Turkey accepted by the 
:,Greeks. Therefore Mr. Kissinger hopes 
.to obtain some yield from the Turks 
by early November, in order to im-
prove Mr. Caramanlis's vote-getting 
-position and set the stage for Greco. 
Turkish talks. 
Before Mr. Ecevit's resignation, he 
had already promised Mr. Kissinger

when Mr. Kissinger passed the formula 
On to James Callaghan, chairman of 
the first Cyprus peace talks in Geneva, 
the British Foreign Secretary failed to 
;present the paper. 
Mr. Kissinger's Margin of maneuver 
is very slender. Congress has put a 
time limit on future Turkish aid ? un- , 
less Ankara budges considerably on 
Cyprus. This has irked many Turks 
who a..alt of quitting NATO completely. 
The Greeks themselves have already 
withdrawn from the alliance's military 
commands but are moving very slowly - 
to implement their decision. 
The Secretary of State's chances of. 
cutting the Cyprian knot depend al-
most wholly on two. men: Mr. Ecevit 
as Premier in Turkey and Mr. Cara-
mantis as head of the first parliamen-
tary government Greece has had since 
1967.

utation as a dii.lomatic miracle-maker 
rides along with. them. . 
Mr. Kissinger, aware of the political 
intricacies inside Greece and Turkey 
and of the ancient passions involve 
was quietly proceeding along lines de-
sired by an emotional Congress re-
sponsible to well-organized American 
lobbies. 
But Congress did not sufficiently 
appreciate either the present complex-
ities or the past historical background. 
Professor Arnold Toynbee wrote in 
1923 ("The Western Question, in Greece 
and Turkey") words that could apply 
today in Cyprus: 
The Greeks have shown the same 
unfitness as the Turks for governing a -

Zulfikar All Bhutto 
By BERNARD WEINRAUB 
RAWALPINDI ? Prime Minister Zulfikar All Blintto .of 
Pakistan rarely goes to bed before 2 or 3 in the morning, 
and sometimes he hardly sleeps at all. He prowls his official 
residence, reading documents, leafing through American 
news magazines, writing statements, abruptly phoning for-
eign diplomats about food imports or arms supplies or aid. 
Within the past few weeks, Mr. Bhutto has been partic-
ularly busy. He has stepped up his pleas to the United 
States to relax the ban on arms sales to coincide with the 
visit this week of Secretary of State Kissinger to India and 
Pakistan. Mr. Bhutto visited Baluchistan, the most troubled 
province in Pakistan, and announced that "organized" re-
sistence by anti-Government rebels had ended. He has ex-
pressed readiness to hold talks with India over the peren-
nial Kashmir issue. At the same time he has been exultant 
over a quiet but significant breakthrough in Indo-Pakistani 
relations: the resumption of telephone and postal links be-
tween the two nations after a break of nearly three years. 
Mr. Bhutto's activity ? he makes pronouncements and 
calls news conferences with the abandon of a New York city 
mayoral candidate is a measure of the style and pace of 
Pakistani politics. After three years in power, and after tak-
ing over a divided and undisciplined nation, Mr. Bhutto has 
thrust Pakistan forward and sought to shape a new identity 
for the country of 70 million. The results are mixed. 
Pakistan's internal problems are glaring. The nation, with 
an annual per capita income of about $110 and illiteracy 
that totals nearly 80 per cent, is impoverished and riven 
with despair. One out of every four babies dies before the 
age of five. 
Nevertheless, Pakistan's economic position seems sur-
prisingly bright, compared with that of her neighbors. In-
flation is running at 25 per cent annually, but the Govern-
ment subsidizes such essentials as wheat, flour, vegetable 
oil and sugar. ? 
Pakistan says she needs to import about a million tons 
of wheat, but this is because the current record crop of 
about 8 million tons was below expectations. Pakistan does 
not suffer from the large-scale food problems of India or 
Bangladesh. 
Even the oil price increase has been less damaging to 
Pakistan than to her iahhor 
ApprOValuF d'&g4t200 ilk38/0?1: 
imports will reach $385-million 'next year, but loans from 
two fellow Islamic nations, Iran and Saudi Arabia, will help. 
Although the economy has proved surprisingly buoyant, 
Pakistan is weighted down by internal troubles. Rebellious 
tribesmen in Baluchistan resent Mr. Bhutto's efftors to gain 
firm central control in the state, which could be a potential 
source of oil. 
There are troubles along the Afghan border, persistent 
Pakistani fears of being Swallowed up by India, and a con-
sistent need by Pakistan to feed her own military machine. 
Without\ American arms, Mr. Bhutto relies on China for 
weapons as well as support. The relationship is based on 
the mutual fear of Soviet involvement on the subcontinent 
and the anxiety, on Mr. Bhutto's part, that Moscow is step-
ping up its role in the area. 
As an independent magazine, Outlook, commented last 
spring in a discussion that dealt with the enduring angers 
on the subcontinent that trap India, Pakistan and Bangla-
desh: "It is a bizarre setting in which cupboards full of 
poverty-stricken skeletons are rattling with the din of 
sophisticated and outdated armaments. Countries which 
cannot afford to provide two square meals a day to their 
teeming millions are wrapped up in visions of hegemony, 
spheres of 'peace' and their 'manifest destiny.'" The mag-
azine, like several opposition newspapers, has since been 
banned. ' --
Bhutto supporters assert that the 1971 Bangladesh war, ' 
when Pakistan lost her eastern wing, still affects the nation, 
13hutto critics point out that several assassination 
attempts have been made on his key opponent, Khan Abdul 
Wali Khan, leader of the?National Awami party, whose-
strongholds areBaluchistan'`and, the Northwest Frontier 
province. Lesser Opposition figures 'eave been "bullied" and, 
tough security, police generally forbi?ct ,are public gather-
ings. Defenders of Mr. BhUtto, however,, and even some 
of his critics, maintain that the Prime Minister is adept and, 
pragmatic, and his singular achievement remaia,s impres-
sive: He has restored some self-respect to a nation that was 
an object of scorn three years ago. 
The 
Pivotal 
Figure 
Indira Gandhi 
NEW DELHI?She has been called the Empress of India 
and the most powerful woman in the world. In New Delhi, 
she is known as "Mrs. G." or "Mataji," Big Mother. 
Whatever the title, Indira Gandhi remains the pivotal 
figure in the nation of 580 million, a woman who has 
plainly decided to move in .new directions at home and 
abroad. To Prime Minister Gandhi, the changes are neces-
sary because India's economy is in a shambles, food scarci-
ties are growing, the mood in the cities where inflation is 
limbing annually at 30 per cent, seems bleak and uneasy. 
India is hardly. on the verge of revolution, but the nation 
does face a deepening crisis. To avert it, Mrs. Gandhi has 
reshuffled her Cabinet, cracked down on smugglers, sought 
to fragment her political opposition and in foreign affairs, 
seems bent on easing relations with the United States. 
Beyond these shifts, and intertwined with them, is a 
persistent and melancholy criticism that the idealism and 
adventure in democracy of the 1950's has turned cynical,. 
that too many people are going hungry, that there are too 
many allegations of corruption and manipulation and police 
activities. Government allocations to maintain law and order 
have doubled in the past five years, and climbed by 52 
times in the last 24 years, a figure termed "alarming" by 
a parliamentary committee. 
"The nation is adrift," said one columnist. Jayaprakash 
Narayan, an ailing figure whose prominence dates to the 
time of Mahatma Gandhi, has abruptly emerged politically 
to frighten the Congress party. He said the other night that 
Jawaharlal Nehru "was one hundred times more democratic" 
than his daughter, Mrs. Gandhi, who has served as India's 
CiRtMrs. Gandhi prot

are immense. The 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100340004-6 
nation needs anywhere from 5 to 10 million tons of food 
imports to avid widespread starvation. The population is 
growing by 13 million each year, and per capita food con-
sumption is steadily declining. Industrial growth is negligi-
ble, despite sizable assistance. Land reforms have failed. 
Shortages of water, seeds and fertilizer have throttled the 
"green revolution." ? 
Mrs. Gandhi's critics place much of the blame for the 
nation's faltering policies on radic'al?and unkept?promises 
such as "Garibi Hatao," or "Abolish Poverty." "The appeal 
of the Garibi Hatao promise was based on the fact that 
it articulated the vast needs of society," Rajni Kothari, a 
prominent political scientist said. "The violence that is 
engulfing the country is the result of the Government's 
failure to even make a start in fulfilling that promise."-
? Perhaps the key criticism of Mrs. Gandhi is that the 
Government has twisted its priorities and has concentrated 
on the development of heavy industry despite the fact that 
India is an agrarian nation: 80 per cent of the populace 
lives on farms: 
To critics, the symbol of India's distorted priorities was 
the nuclear blast on May 18. Indians insist that the blast 
was "for peaceful purposes" but the'Government obviously 
weighed the propoganda and military impact of the surprise 
move. As the Economic and Political Weekly said recently: 
"Deaths from starvation are taking place. No famine is go-
ing to be declared. But officially the country will continue 
its 'progress.' 
"This year it was the first nuclear implosion followed by 
[the takeover of] Sikkim, Next year, perhaps, it will be an 
Indian version of the sputnik, and we will have arrived in 
space. Once you hate Attained such heights, people and 
their need for food must indeed seem remote and trivial." 
The annual outlay for agriculture has dwindled. Last year, 
for example, it was about $1.03-billion. This year it amounts 
to $850-million. ? 
In fairness to Mrs. Gandhi, who remains an aloof and 
chilly figure, the task of dealing with India's poverty is 
extraordinarily difficult. "I think that the only reason I'm 
able to survive this with equanamity is that I'm just myself, 
regardless of the situation in the country," she has said. 
"I know the condition of the people. There's nothing I can 
see that I don't know about already. It's not that you 
don't feel it but?it's like a nurse and illness. You see it 
in perspective." 
To Mrs. Gandhi's numerous critics, however, the recent 
steps taken by the Prime Minister are cynical gestures to 
cope with India's emergency. Yes, critics say, Mrs. Gandhi 
has finally reshuffled her Cabinet and placed Jagjivan Ram, 
a tough and powerful figure, in the key post of Food Minis-
ter, a position that has too often been held by inept figures. 
But the Cabinet, the critics add, consists of merely the same 
old faces in new jobs. ? 
Even critics have welcomed the crackdown on smugglers, 
whose illicit trade threatened to damage the economy. But 
there is resentment that the pay-offs by the smugglers, and 
the alleged involvement of government officials, is ignored. 
Moreover, the seizure of the smugglers under emergency 
measures coupled with the increased use of such laws to 
arbitrarily arrest strikers, students and terrorist suspects as 
well as the dismissal of an anti-Government newspaper 
editor, B. G. Verghese, have spurred debate about the 
quality of India's democracy. The nation remains an open, 
free-wheeling society, with a lively press, but recent events 
have left Indian intellectuals uneasy. 
In recent months, Mrs. Gandhi has managed her foreign 
policy with some success. Relations with Pakistan, always 
fragile, are still so but India's friendship with Iran has 
deepened, with the recent visit here of Shah Mohammed 
Riza Pahlevi. Now Secretary of State Kissinger's visit is 
expected to lift relations between Washington and New 
Delhi whose friendship soured during the 1971 Bangladesh 
war when the United States sided with Pakistan over India. 
32 
"It's a question of Kissinger and Mrs. Gandhi meeting again 
and, hopefully, hitting it off after three years," said one 
American source here. "If they do, that's fine, and if they 
don't, well. ..." 
The American merely shrugged. ?BERNARD WEINRAUB

Figure? 
Sheik Mujibur Rahman 
r.Jy KASTURI RANGAN 
NEW DELHI ? After winning Bangladesh's admission to 
the United Nations, when China withdrew its opposition, 
Prime Minister Sheik Mujibur Rahman returned home this 
month asserting that his country's "dark days" were over. famine {threatening and industry almost entirely idle, 
there w_ere sthne to whom his optimism seemed premature. 
The diplomatic breakthrough at the United Nations was 
accompanied by a shipment of 5,000 tons of urgently needed 
rice' from China. The Dacca Government has also received 
an offer from the United States of 150,000 tons of wheat 
and rice. and the promise of a large development loan. 
But the grain from the United States has not arrived and 
officials in Dacca complain that Washington has ignored a ? 
plea to speed deliveries by diverting some grain going to 
nearby countries. Only last weekend, because of prodding by 
the United Nations, an American shipment of 10,000 tons of 
rice to Indonesia was diverted, but even this consignment 
will not reach Bangladesh before the end of this month. 
Officials here are hurt by the belated sympathy for the 
millions of people starving following floods earlier this year. 
Further, more than a half-mililon workers have been 
rendered jobless by the closure of hundreds of factories be-
cause of a shortage of fuel and raw material. Nearly 200 big 
textile, jute, sugar and paper mills, perform on the average 
40 per cent below normal capacity. At least 10 of the 70 jute 
mills, which contribute the bulk of foreign exchange earn-
ings, were closed for, many months by labor troubles. 
According to the Government, the floods destroyed nearly 
a third of the expected grain crop; the loss in crops, homes 
destroyed and factory production could exceed $300-mililon. 
Foreign observers say that, even with foreign aid, 100,000 
people could starve. 
The Government has concluded that these compulsions re-
quire Bangladesh to adjust its foreign policy to maintain 
good relations with all the parties seeking influence on the 
subcontinent, not just with- India and the Soviet Union, but 
also with China and the United States. 
But relations with the Soviet Union and India, the two 
countries that wholeheartedly backed Bangladesh in win-
ning her independence from Pakistan four years ago, have 
cooled. Despite a recent pledge of $21-mililon dollars from 
the Soviet Union, people remain suspicious about Moscow's 
gestures. 
Smuggling over the 1,300-mile border the two countries 
share is the principal irritant in relations with India. 
Despite these troubles, Sheik Mujib's popularity remains 
intact. Even though his administration is saddled by inexpe-
rienced, inefficient and corrupt officials, there is hardly any 
political opposition to his rule. He is still venerated by most 
? people as the father of the nation.

WASHINGTON STAR 
21 October 1974 
? By Henry S. Brads her 
Star-News Staff Writer 
SAIGON ? Throughout Indochina 
today; the gloom is deepening. 
The old threat that has loomed 
larger ever since the United States 
-began withdrawing from South Viet-
nam has now acquired a greater, 
sense of immediacy. 
Government officials, politically 
aware citizens and diplomats are 
wondering with growing concern 
whether this blood-soaked peninsula 
is moving with accelerating speed 
toward eventual control by North 
Vietnam, or by local Communists 
under strong influence from Hanoi. 
This concern still falls consider-
ably short of desperation, despair 
or a sense of inevitability. A col-
lapse of anti-Communist morale is 
not in sight. But there is a distinct 
ebbing of confidence in long term 
prospects. It results from a strong 
apprehension that resistance to con-
tinuing Communist pressure cannot 
be sustained at an adequate level. 
THE WAR GOES ON in South 
Vietnam, little affected by the 
American unilateral declaration of 
peace almost two years ago. Cam-
bodia, too, suffers unending war, 
stalemated at the present level of 
outside aid to the two sides. The 
fragile cease-fire in Laos has shift-
ed the nature of that struggle with.
out ending it. And in Thailand, 
Communist insurgency continues 
with North Vietnamese aid. 
The basic problems remain the 
same as they were when the Ameri-
cans were here with their half-mil-
lion soldiers and their willingness to 
pour in whatever money and 
material was needed to meet the 
threats to friendly governments. 
If the Americans had never been 
here, those governments would not 
exist in their present form, but they 
were and they do and hence the 
gloom. 
The problems are the same; the 
old solutions are either no longer 
available or no longer work very 
-well. 
With American support dwin-
dling, the governments of South 
Vietnam and Cambodia, and non-
Communists in Laos who are now in 
uneasy coalition with the? 
Communists, are caught between 
continuing Communist pressure and 
their own inability to generate 
greater internal strength. 
No one knows just where the 
threshold lies at which U.S. military 
keep viable the Saigon and Phnom 
Penh governments, and the non-
Communist element in Vientiane. 
Computing a dollar figure for each 
country is complicated by unstable. 
local factors, varying degrees of 
corruption and wastage, and 
deliberate exaggeration of need in 
order to provide a margin for cuts. 
There is also the psychological 
factor of maintaining confidence in 
each country. The feeling.is. wide-
spread in Indochina that the United 
States public in general and Con-
gress in particular misjudge the 
threshold, or simply do not care. 
Congress has cut military aid to 
South Vietnam in the year which 
began July 1 to about one half in. 
real terms what it had been the 
previous year, and chopped econo-
mic aid to Saigon, and. refused to 
give special military aid to Cam-
bodia like that which kept the 
Cambodian army going in the last 
fiscal year. 
Just how- real and direct 
is the tie between aid cuts 
and the ability of these gov-
ernments to survive is, how-
ever, open to debate. 
A SENIOR AMERICAN 
official in one of the Indo-
chinese countries said can-
didly the other day that "I 
don't know how we can 
spend all the money" that 
was left after Congress had 
made cuts in the now-post-
poned version of the foreign 
aid bill. A deputy premier 
in another of the countries 
said, "American aid is more 
than sufficient if we can use 
it properly" ? adding that 
it is not used properly now. 
Some military officers in 
the third country feel that 
their army could and would 
fight better if it had less 
American equipment and 
ammunition to perpetuate 
the addiction to inappropri-
ate U.S. Army tactics. 
These are, though, dis-
puted opinions. The more 
general attitude, as well as 
the official posture, among 
both government ministers 
and diplomats is that while 
inflation is pushing up the 
threshold Congress is going 
the opposite direction. 
The psychological result 
is perhaps as significant as 
any measurement in 105mm 
artillery shells. M79 gren-
and economic aid will be too low to ade launchers and gallons of 
aviation fuel. If the feeling 
spreads in these countries 
that they cannot keep going 
on the old basis, not only for 
lack of ammunition but also 
because inflation makes it 
impossible for a soldier to 
feed his family, then that 
alone can cause a crumb-. 
ling. 
. Some of the same top offi-
cials who talk one moment 
of the desirability of negoti-
ations with the Communists 
? whether directly with 
Hanoi or with local ele-
ments whom they view as 
Hanoi's agents ? speak the 
next moment of the im-
placability of the adver-
sary. They remain equivo-
cal whether their hope of a 
negotiated settlement is 
sufficient to overcome their 
assumption, based on long 
and bitter experience, that 
North Vietnam will never 
settle for less at the negoti-
ating table than it hopes to 
win from protracted war. 
HERE IN SOUTH Viet-
nam "our war will not be 
solved by military means, it 
must be negotiated," Hoang 
Duc Nha said in an inter-
view the other day. Nha, 
the minister of information, 
has been President Nguyen 
Van Thieu's key adviser 
and was the only South 
Vietnamese official to sit 
with Thieu in all the tortu-
ous negotiations two years 
ago that finally produced 
the Paris agreement, which 
was supposed to halt this 
war but did not. . ? 
The Cambodian regime of 
President Lon Nol has been 
seeking futilely for years to 
establish contact with its 
enemies in order to negoti-
ate a truce but the other 
side appears to be divided 
and rejects every negotiat-
ing offer, even when the re-
gime retreated last July to 
offering talks without any 
preconditions. 
In his office at the educa-
tion ministry in Phnom 
Penh, from which his prede-
cessor was dragged to a 
mysterious death last June, 
acting Premier Pan Sothi 
said recently that "low-
intensity war is the pros-

Norodom Sihanouk's exile 
regime to take away the 
Cambodian seat in the 
United Nations is causing 
grave concern. 
"A doubt exists that we 
could go on and fight the 
war" if the seat is lost, Pan 
Sothi said, because the cli-
mate of confidence would-
be destroyed. 
Laos has negotiated, and 
the result has been the re- , 
establishment of coalition 
government, which has 
broken down twice before in 
the last two decades. Now 
members of the old Vienti-
ane government that had 
been fighting the Pathet 
Lao are-worried that the 
Pathet Lao are deminating 
the coalition. One of them, 
Major General Oudone Sa-
nanikone, said in his De-
fense Ministry office recent-
ly that "the war goes on, a 
political war now." He com-
plained that the 
Communists had all the 
advantages in the coalition, 
getting a share of power in 
Vientiane without giving up 
any control of their own 
territory and supported by 
the neutralist premier, 
Prince Souvanna Phouma, 
in arguments with the 
rightists. . 
The deputy foreign minis-
ter of Thailand, Major 
General Chatichai Choonha-
van, in his ministry building 
overlooking the fabulously 
spired and tinted roofs of 
the royal palace at Bang-
kok, said that if North Viet- , 
nam "wanted to bring back 
peace in one region it could 
in a few days." But Hanoi 
goes on supporting wars 
and the Communist insur-
gency in Thailand, he said. 
The opening up of demo-
cratic debate in Thailand 
which began a year ago 
with the overthrow of mili-
tary rulers who committed 
the country to American 
policy in Indochina has 
created uncertainty over fu-
ture attitudes of this situa-
tion. For now, however, 
American warplanes re-

Thailand for possible re-
sumption of bombing in 
Indochina. 
IT IS ONLY in Thailand 
that basic policy toward the 
Communist problem seems 
to be under active consider-
ation. 
Officials and opposition 
political leaders in South 
Vietnam, Cambodia and 
Laos talk gloomily of short-
term prospects. There is a 
marked reluctance to dwell 
upon the ultimate result of 
the current gloomy trends 
in the economic and mili-
tary situations, should they 
continue unchecked by 
some presently unforesee-
able change of circum-
stances. Some kind of men-
tal block seems to make it 
impossible to face the possi-
bility of losing these long 
wars and falling under the 
control of the enemies, or a 
single enemy for those who 
see the local threat as only 
a front for Hanoi. This 
block exists on conversation 
with outsiders, anyway. 
It is generally assumed 
among foreign observers 
and even among lower offi-
cials that many of the top 
people in these countries 
are looking ahead to the 
possibility of collapse. Al-
though no proof is offered, 
many say that Swiss bank 
accounts and other fallback 
arrangements are being 
made with funds which 
originate through U.S. aid. 
Diplomats are also more 
open in their speculation 
about the future than local 
people, being less personal-
ly involved. Many of them 
wonder aloud whether the 
three Indochinese countries 
are already on an inevitable 
slide into Communist con-
trol, and how long it will 
take. A few years? A dec-
ade? 
It is an impossible ques-
tion to answer, as everyone 
realizes, even though the 
essential importance is the 
pessimism of the asking. 
The ability of nations to sur-
vive apparently hopeless 
situations is often surpris-
ing; and conditions that look 
desperate can sometimes 
drag on indefinitely. 
THE MILITARY situa-
tions in South Vietnam and-
Cambodia are the primary 
reason for the regional 
gloom. Economic problems 
are generally seen as a re-
sult of the continued fight-
ing, although the difficulties 
of paying former soldiers in 
Laos suggests that a cease-
fire alone fails to remove 
economic problems. Since 
the Paris agreement sup-
posedly went into effect in 
South Vietnam almost 21 
months ago, fighting has 
continued at approximately 
the same level as it did in 
between major offensives of 
the war. Each side has been 
guilty of violating the 
cease-fire when it felt it 
could gain territorial or 
population advantages. 
The Saigon government's 
internal propaganda has 
wavered between proclaim-
ing a major Communist 
offensive to be underway or 
te be imminent, as if the 
Thieu regime cannot itself 
decide. This has been paral-
leled by U.S. embassy 
wavering that has appar-
ently been keyed to efforts 
to obtain larger aid alloca-
tions from Congress. 
The current intensive 
'fighting around Hue and Da 
Nang along South Viet-
nam's northern coat, and 
in almost uninhabited parts 
of the central highlands, is 
more jockeying for future 
positions of value in any big 
Communist offensive than a 
major drive in itself. 
There is no doubt that the 
North Vietnamese army, at 
a currently estimated 
strength of just below 200,-
000 soldiers in the South, is 
stronger than it has ever 
been. It has more artillery, 
some big enough to shell 
government positions from 
outside the range of return 
gunfire, more armored 
vehicles, more anti-aircraft 
cover and better mobility 
than when it launched the 
last big offensive at Easter 
1972. 
The development of roads 
and pipelines into 
Communist controlled areas 
of South Vietnam has sig-
nificantly changed the pros-
pects for any future up-
surge. Hanoi can now rush 
reinforcements south in a 
few weeks instead of taking 
months on the old bomb-
harassed Ho Chi Minh trail. 
The trail itself remains in 
use, contrary to North Viet-
nam's obligation to remove 
its troops from Laos after 
the cease-fire there. In 
Cambodia some 50,000 sol-
diers, labeled by the Ameri-
cans "Khmer Communists" 
34 
for lack of any more dis-, 
criminating identification of 
probably still disparate 
opponents of Lon No!, con-. 
trol most of the country. 
Neither side presently has 
the manpower or arma-
ments to make a decisive 
breakthrough. The Phnom 
Penh government just stag-
gers on from one dry season 
to the next wet season, 
reacting to what the enemy 
does. 
"As long as U.S. aid stays 
at last year's level, this war 
could go on for another 10 
years," one informed ob-
server commented as Con-
gress was cutting the aid. 
Unlike the Viet Cong, how-
ever, enemy propaganda in 
Cambodia does not talk of a 
long war. It emphasizes 
that the withdrawal of U.S. 
aid would bring a quick end 
with the collapse of Lon 
Nol's regime. Pathet Lao 
_ 
troops in Laos, who have 
mostly replaced in forward 
positions North Vietnamese 
units that did the actual 
wartime fighting for them, 
have been jockeying for ter-
ritorial advantage, particu-
larly around the royal cap-
ital, Luang Prabang. But a: 
Pathet Lao spokesman in 
Vientiane, the government 
seat, serves .cold drinks and 
talks of his side observing 
the cease-fire. He also still 
insists U.S. and Thai mili-
tary forces must leave Laos, 
although independent ob-
servers agree that they al-
ready have.

INDOCHINA IA/CONY 
ic Woes intensify 
By Henry S. Bradsher 
Star-News Staff Writer 
SAIGON ? Duch Stile sat 
on a wooden bed in the gar-
den outside his weather-
beaten house near Phnom 
Penh, talking with the quiet 
air of an educated man, but , 
worried. 
"I tried to get a job as a 
taxi-bus driver, but I could-
n't. Some of the other teach-
ers have part-time jobs, but 
even then it's hard." 
Before war came to 
CaMbodia, Duch Side earn-
ed 78,000 riels a month at 
his school. It cost about 8 
percent of that to buy the 
basic staple, rice, for his 
family. 
Now he earns 30,000 ries 
and rice takes up half of it. 
Other 'food expenses take 
the remainder. His wife is , 
able to earn only 400 riels a 
day in the marketplace ? 
not enough for all the other 
things the family reds. 
?On the outskirts of Sai-
gon, Nguyen Van Than, who 
was called away from 
teaching to fight in the 
army, is now back teaching 
SS pupils all subjects in five 
elementary grades after 
losing his right eye in com-
bat. 
When he started teaching 
in 1960, Than paid one-sev-
enth of his salary of 5,500 
piasters to feed his family. I 
Now it costs two-thirds of 
his current salary, 34,000 
piasters. He and his wife 
sew mosquito nets at home 
to try to make ends meet. 
While hundreds of thousands, per-
haps 2 million, persons are unem-
ployed and unable to pay for enough 
rice, even people on fixed govern-
ment salaries in .Indochina like 
teachers are hard-pressed theses 
days to survive. Both South Viet-
namese and Cambodian soldiers, 
whose monthly pay has been ,whit-
tied, down by inflation to only 
enough to feed their families for 
about 10 days, are resorting to loot-
ing and petty extortion from the 
people they are supposed to be pro-
tecting from Communism. 
IT WAS just such military abuse 
of the civilian population in Viet-
nam more than a decade ago that 
alienated popular support and ena-. 
bled the Viet Cong to built up its 
strength. The massive American in-
volvement in Vietnam reduced this 
problem for some years. But now the 
combination of reduced U.S. aid and 
roaring inflation has brought it 
back to South Vietnam, posed addi-
Approved 
tional problems for Cambodia and 
led to rioting by soldiers in Laos. 
These three Indochinese countries 
have for years existed on American-
money. 
The United States provides ap-,' 
. 
proximately two-thirds of the com-
bined civilian and military financial 
needs of South Vietnam. As the 
Cambodian government's territorial 
control and tax base have contract-
ed, the U.S. contribution to the n,a-
-tional budget has risen from about a 
nuarter two years ago to two-thirds 
now ? and if military supplies are 
added, the American share comes 
,close to 90 percent of total expenses: 
Laos would scarcely 'have' 
monetized 
'monetized, economy without U. S, 
'aid.. , , ? 
All three countries are worried 
how they might survive in the fu-
ture. Their economies have been 
adapted to the modernization that 
War has brought, and it is no easier 
to send an unemployed Saigon dock-
worker or former U. S. army camp 
laborer back to the rice paddy than 
it is to get a laid-off Detroit factory 
hand to return to a Kentucky farm 
?harder, even, when the farm is 
now occupied by the enemy. 
Officials in Vietnam and Cambo-
dia are even more urgently con-
cerned with the possibility that 
reductions of military aid will leave 
- their soldiers without adequate aril-
munition to withstand Communist 
attacks. Some outposts have been 
abandohed as no longer feasible to 
maintain with less firepower avail-
able, enabling the enemy to- expand 
his control. 
Despite the arguments being 
made for continuing American aid 
at more or less same levels, there is 
widespread skepticism among ob-
servers in Indochina that even the 
full amounts would do much more 
than keep the governments grinding 
into seemingly endless wars, rather 
than solving basic problems. It is 
even uncertain that the same levels 
would remain adequate as inflation, 
both the imported worldwide vari-
ety and that spurred by deficit fi-
nancing in these countries, eats into 
resources. 
NOR IS THERE any-certainty 
that aid cuts will have the theoreti-
cally ideal effect of forcing clearer 
thinking about priorities and sensi-
ble economies in spending. The 
Indochinese governments look even 
less capable of that than most. 
In none of these countries is there 
any serious long-term consideration 
of economic problems. They all 
have planning ministries but plan-
ning is impossible under the strain-
ed circumstances. 
In fact, Vietnam and 
areconcerneW t 
FproReleitaes 
;. le; 
little better in Laos. ? '-
This makes the Nixon and Ford 
administrations' requests to 'Con-
gress, for "postwar reconstruction 
assistance" a sad joke. There is 
nothing post about the wars in Viet-
nam and Cambodia, nothing is 
being reconstructed while the de-
struction goes on and fighting 
deters any meaningful productive 
investment, and rather than assist-
ance the U. S. aid is primarY suste-
- nance. . 
' Nonetheless, the administration 
has contended that a five-year pro-
:gram of declining aid for South 
Vietnam would enable this country 
-to take off into economic self reli--. 
ance. This was an early salespoint 
on this year's foreign aid program. 
It was not thought up by U. S. eco-
nomic experts in Saigon. When 
bressed on the idea that South Viet-
-nam can become selfsufficient with-
in- any foreseeable future, 'they 
agree with the foreign observer who 
commented that the idea depended 
upon half a dozen or more favorable 
assumptions all coming true, but 
none of them looked very likely. ' 
, Only the 'glimmer of offshore oil 
holds much encouragement, and the 
Communists are trying their best to 
discourage foreign exploration for it 
off. South Vietnam. Cambodia is in-
volved in disputes over delineation 
of its offshore waters with Vietnam: 
and Thailand, -which between them 
want to reduce Phnom Penh's share 
to almost nothing, while Laos is left 
out in oil like almost everything else 
of economic value. 
For years this correspondent has 
been hearing in these countries 
moan ? from U. S. officials about 
congressional cuts in aid appropria-
tions. Each year there would be 
explanations how goods in the pipe-
line or some fortituous circum-
stance had allowed the client gov-
ernment to survive the previous 
year's cats, but this year the full 
amount was really needed if eco-
.nomic stability and the war effort 
was to be maintained. 
The repetition of the year after. 
year suggested considerable water-
.ing of aid requests to insure that the 
reduced appropriation would still be 
enough. But if there was water, offi- - 
cials contend, it has evaporated and! 
Congress is now cutting into essen-
tials that help these countries stay 
led and armed. The contention is 
hard to evaluate, but the visible 
problems of declining living stand-
ards tend to support it. 
"AN ECONOMY with less resili-
ency than ours would have collaps-
ed by now," the minister of trade 
and industry, Nguyen Duc Cuong, 
said in a recent interview. 
Cuong said the country faces a 
dilemma whether to put primary 
emphasis on fighting inflation, 
"only 50 percent this year if we are 
lucky," or on trying to spend out of 
the recession caused by U. S. froop 
Withdrawals, imported inflation, the 
war and other problems. "We can-
not expect the economy to do any

so the situation won't be too explo-
sive:: 
President Nguyen Van Thieu 
vows that South Vietnam "will cer-
tainly be ready to fight until the last 
drop of blood, the last bullet and the. 
last grain of rice," if the United 
States fails to provide enough aid._ 
In a rather gloomy speech recently, 
one in which he only vaguely de-
fended himself against corruption 
charges, Thieu said the U. S. gov-
ernment had promised him ade-
quate aid at the time of the so-called 
? cease-fire. Americans are now "en-
countering economic and? financial 
difficulties," Thieu said. "Neverthe-
less, they cannot swallow their 
promises and shirk their obligation 
to one of their allies." 
When the Paris agreement was 
:signed 21 months ago to let the' 
Americans out of the war, the U. S. 
_government also promised, Thieu 
? said, that it "would react vigorously 
to 'Communist violations of the 
cease-fire, their continued infiltra-
'tion into the South and their lack of 
respect for the Paris agreement. 
?-
? "What have we seen so far?'' 
Thieu asked. "There has been no U. 
S. reaction to the Communist infil-
.tration into the South and their 
grave violations of the cease-fire., 
This is. because of the U. S. internal 
situation." 
In an interview, Tram Van Lam, ' 
who as foreign minister signed the 
Paris agreement for South Vietnam, 
said that Henry A. Kissinger had 
given him assurances during the ne-
gotiations which have failed to work 
out. Now it does not make sense for 
the United States to cut its aid, Lam 
protested. ? ? ? 
" While such protests are heard 
from the government, old political 
opponents of Thiel/ have beenreiri-
vigorated by the signs of fading 
American backing for his regime. 
THIEU HAS COME to represent 
American interests in Vietnam in 
the eyes of many people here, fairly 
or unfairly. He has been able to 
deliver aid. Now if he can no longer 
deliver, his usefulness is more like-
? ly to be questioned.. 
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the? 
ousted leader of Cambodia who now 
from Peking fronts for Communist 
effort to take over his country, said 
the other day that the territory con-
trolled by the Lon Nol regime is 
"nothing but an economic corpse ? 
a 'non-state' which has no economy 
of its own and is surviving with 
great difficulty on the constant and 
massive aid injections from its U. S. 
masters." 
Early this year the U. S. embassy 
in Phnom Peah was saying that it 
had a virtual blank check from the 
Nixon administration to provide 
whatever military and economic aid 
was needed to sustain "the finest 
example of the Nixon Doctrine in 
action," as the former president 
once called it. Now the mood has 
changed. 
Congress has been closing loop-
holes which made it possible to find 
extra money for Cambodia. At the, 
same time the Communists have 
shut off the flow of rubber from 
their zone, bartered against U. S. 
aid goods, which provided the 
Phnom Penh regime with its only 
significant foreign exchange earn-
ings. 
CORRUPTION is a problem in all 
three Indochinese countries but in 
none is it more of a drain on the war 
effort and homefront economic 
stability than in Cambodia. ? 
"We copy the French in so many 
'things" in this former French 
colonial area, one official in Phnom 
Penh commented, "its a shame we 
don't use their system of taxing vis-
ible wealth instead of official in-
come." The visible wealth-of gener-
als and some civilian officials since 
U. S. aid began flowing into Cambo-
dia has increased enormously while 
salaries have remained low. 
But Marshal Lou Nol ignores the 
obvious corruption of top military 
and civilian officials, making .it 
:impossible to clean up a malignant 
situation. When the U. S. embassy 
insisted last spring that repaYment 
be made for some stolen aviation 
gasoline provided by American aid, 
it was paid ? but the payment origi-
nated ultimately from other U. S. 
'funds. 
? The economic situation in Cambo-
dia, where inflation is now running 
some 250 percent a year in the 
Phnom Penh enclave, is a major 
factor in political unrest. Subsidiza-
tion of rice at such a low level that 
much was smuggled abroad while

U.S. SAYS HANOI EXPLOITS DISSENT 
CIA Role 19 ffl 
4:151.0 
By George Esper 
Associated  Press 
SAIGON ? The United States 
Embassy today denied that the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency is involved 
in demonstrations against South 
Vietnam's President Nguyen Van 
Thieu and accused North Vietnam 
of a "crudely obvious attempt to ex-
ploit the dissent" 
The U.S. Embassy statement was 
issued after anti-Thieu demonstra-
.tors in Saigon yesterday burned a 
police jeep and stoned the National 
Assembly building. Quieter anti-
government rallies were held in 
Hue, Can Tho and other towns. 
THE EMBASSY cited Viet Cong 
statements in the past two weeks 
.charging that the CIA is giving sup-
port to dissident political groups in 
South Vietnam. 
"The United States does not en-
courage, nor does? it support in any 
way, any political faction in Viet-
nam," the American statements 
said. "These accusations are utter-
ly groundless and totally false." 
' The statement also said that by 
Viet Cong and North Vietnamese 
destruction of roeds, bridges and 
other important installations in 
military attacks, Hanoi is "seeking 
to increase the economic suffering 
of the South Vietnamese people in 
the hope that it can exploit po itical-
ly the resulting misery." 
, THE WET CONG claimed Oct. 12 
that the United States was trying to 
infiltrate agents into the dissident 
South Vietnamese political groups' 
to "manipulate and turn" the dis-
sent to its own benefit. 
The Communists charge that the 
United States is conducting a 
"double-faced" policy: Pushing 
Thieu to make reforms to strength-
en his position and the same time 
trying to develop a position of influ-
ence with the opposition in case 
Thieu is overthrown. 
officials contend that the 
Viet Cong is conducting the 
"double-faced" policy: Assailing 
the United States for its support ol 
Thieu and at the same time accus-
? ing the United States of preparing a 
fallback position should he be oust-
ed. 
SOME ANALYSTS say they be-
lieve the Viet Cong is laying the 
groundwork, should Thieu be forced 
out, to refuse to cooperate with his 
successor by claiining that the 
United States was behind . the 
change. So far, however, there is no 
suggestion that the anti-Thieu

movement is strong enough to top-? 
? ple him. 
The demonstration in Saigon yes-
terday began with a march by about 
100 politicians, Buddhist monks and 
nuns and Roman Catholic priests 
? through downtown Saigon. 
They were joined by several 
hundres students and children who 
broke away from the older people; 
burned a police jeep smashed the 
ornate glass doors and porcelain 
flower pots at the National Assem-
bly building, and burned portraits 
of Thieu. 
At least two of the demonstrators 
were injured, and a govertunent 
spokesman claimed 36 policeman 
were hurt. 
In Inchon, South Korea, mean-
while, an American bishop, the Reg. 
William McNaughton of Boston, ledi 
SOO Roman Catholic priests, nuns 
and laymen yesterday in a demon-
stration that police tried to break 
up withitear gas. 
The marchers shouted "Dictatori-
al regime go away" in the second 
antigovernment protest since Au-
gust, when President Chung Hee 
Park lifted two goventunent decrees 
banning political dissent. 
'South Vietnam seems to be heading into another of 
its convoluted political crises. As the war rumbles 
on and economic hardships increase, opponents of 
the Thieu regime are showing a surprising capacity

two months ago, President Nguyen Van Thieu 
seemed still at the height of his police-state powers. 
The legislature was utterly under his thumb and 
political foes either were in jail, in hiding or 
ostentatiously inactive. While his regime was as 
unpopular as ever, no real protest wds in evidence. 
Why the change? Why the spectacle of crowds 
marching on the National Assembly building in 
Saigon with many a Thieu poster cross-hitched by .a 
large black X? One reason is that Thieu has been 
duly warned by the American Embassy that any 
display. of harsh strongarm methods would so 
outrage the U.S. Congress that economic and 
military aid would be slashed even more deeply. 
Another reason?a more pervasive one?is the 
? growing intolerance of the Vietnamese people for 
the corruption that riddles their government from 
cop to general. When American money and arms 
were giving the Vietnamese economy a phony flush 
of prosperity, graft was tolerable to the masses?to 
those who were doing better than ever provided they

SAIGON, Oct. 12?Low 
army morale is threatening 
President Thieu's traditional 
military power base at a 
time when . he is under 
mounting political pressure 
to enact democratic reforms, 
make peace, and end cOrrup, 
tion. 
Desertions duriqg a re-
cent period reached the 
staggering rate of between 
4,000 and 5,000 a week, ac-
cording to reliable Sources. 
At that rate, more than 20 
per cent of the 1.1 million. 
man armed forces would de-
sert during the year, al-
though many of these might 
be repeaters. The rate is in-
creasing. 
Also, government soldiers 
are dying at a rate of 300 
per week this year, a 50 per 
cent increase over last year. 
Army pay continues to be 
low, and field commanders 
are reporting that lack of 
rice for soldiers and their 
families is becoming- an 
even bigger morale problem 
than the aggressiveness of 
the Communist forces. 
The Communists are tak-
ing advantage of Saigon's in-
creasing morale problems 
by massing overwhelming 
forces to' score dramatic psy-
chological victories against 
small isolated outposts; iso-
lated towns and even battal-
ion-sized government units. 
Government soldiers are 
still firing five times as 
many shells as the Commu-
nists, hut this is less than 
half the firepower that was 
available to the government 
a year ago before severe 
congressional military aid 
cuts began. 
The army is riddled with 
corruption, and reports from 
the field indicate that: the 
common soldiers are in-
creasingly unhappy with 
this as reports of anticorrup-
tion rallies in major cities 
spread thrbugh the ranks. 
"There's no talk of a mili-
tary, coup right now, but 
there's more direct criticism 
of Thieu in the army than 
there ever has been below." 
said a well-placed Western 
observer. 
A military librarian at the 
armed forees headquarters 
made the front pages here

protest when he declared, 
"high-level army corruption 
has eroded the eonfidence 
and fighting spirit of the

diers, 
President Thieu promised 
in his Oct. 1 speech to the 
nation to try to eliminate 
corruption in the armed 
forces by the. end of the 
month, and as commander-
in-chief he has issued orders 
- to accomplish that. 
But Thieu's problem, ac-
cording to, observers here, is 
that he cannot get rid of the 
numerous high-ranking eor--
rupt generals under -his 
command without destroy-
ing his power base and thus, 
bringing about his own dem-
ise. 
Thieu has retired or fired 
more than a dozen generals 
since the beginning of the 
/year, but the changes were 
of little significance since 
many of the generals had 
long before already been 
placed in insignificant jobs 
because of old age, physical 
disabilities or alleged cor-
ruption. 
Western diplomats and 
other sources picture Thieu 
as enmeshed in an intricate 
web of corruption and favor-
itism with many of his top 
commanders that makes it 
Impossible for him to fire 
them. 
His positicin is - becoming 
increasingly delicate as the 
result of Mounting pressure . 
from his political opponents 
that he clean house. 
Thieu, a lieutenant gen-
eral at the time of his elec-
tion in 1967 and a partici-
pant in the 1963 coup that 
overthrew President Ngo 
Dinh Diem, has skillfully 
played off the loyalties, aspi-
rations and greed of his gen-
erals to keep himself firmly 
entrenched and immune" 
from coup attempts. 
Most of the generals who 
are considered non-corrupt 
and apolitical are serving ? 
far from Saigon in the 
northern part of South Viet-
nam where there is no possi-
bility of their suddenly mov-
ing against Thieu in a coup. 
These include the com-

Gen. Cao Van Vien, com-

uses Vien only to implement 
them.

He has failed to retake 
key positions lost to the 
Communists, and has gained 
a reputation among most 
Western observers here, in-
cluding the U.S. Embassy, as 
a corrupt general 'com-
pletely beholden to Thieu. 
The commander of the 
Mekong Delta south of Sai-

commanders of the several 
divisions stationed near Sai-

Thieu's right-hand military

He said : "I suggested a

firm we called in .during the 
middle.icii 1966 suggested the 
buggink device so that Harold 
would not have his desk clut-

The device installed was a pen 
set with a " bug " inside it and 
two tape recorders on a 'shelf 
in the private secretary's office 
next door, 
"But the bug proved a. 
disaster. Harold never could 
get used to it. It was so realis-

socket thinking it was a real 
pen. it was so much trouble 
having it fixed up all the time 
that eventually we had a plug-

Mr Eggleston had never 
been in-.0Ived in using the 
device for anything but provid-

Oct_ 29?In this tiny royal

to prevent the President's four-

Nov. 18. With the rather light-

that prevailed tonight, it 
seemed doubtful that they had

their obIective. 
The liftists, however, have 
the first real issue they have 
had since the end of the Viet-

accounted for the largest turn-
out they have had at this an-
nual "antiwar day" rite in 
a secret "transit agreement" 
that permits the United States 
to bring nuclear weapons into 
Japan temporarily. 
The Government's denial 
seems not to have been very 
effective. Yomiuri Shimbun, 
Japan's second largest cir-
culating newspaper, said in an 
editorial: "Many people now

when swirling riots in the 
streets forced the Japanese

Tonight, a Communist speak-

Forced isolation takes toll on

Seoul?A year and? three

begun to take its physical and 
emotional toll on Kim Dae

under constant surveillance 
since his abduction from a 
Tokyo hotel room in August, 
.1973. 
Harassed by threatening 
phone calls, disturbed by mys-

' "With so many, many things

difficult thing has been to con-
trol myself," Mr. Kim said. "I 
can well understand how politi-
cal prisoners in Russia end up 
suffering from mental prob-
lems." 
Mr. Kim is suffering from 
sciatica, and said his condition 
has deteriorated considerably 
during his confinement, with 
particularly strong pain in his 
legs. He walks stiffly, has trou-
ble bending over, and said he 
cannot sleep well at night. 
He said he frequently. takes 
sleeping pills and sleeps during 
the day instead of at night. His 
face appears puffy and aged, 
and his mind wanders occa-
sionally during a conversation,. 
While he was still anxious to 
talk about politics last spring, 
in a recent interview Mr. Kim 
appeared preoccupied with his 
own problems. 
My house is surrounded. 
They have surveillance sta-
tions in buildings on three 
sides of me. Wherever I go, 
two cars follow me. If I see 
friends, they are taken in for 
interrogation," he said. , 
"Basically, I am a politician. 
I know my people are out 
there, and still remember me, 
and support me," he said. 
"But I am completely cut off. 
My name can't be mentioned 
in the news media, and I 
go anywhere or see anyone, 
except foreign visito"s."

Although the South Korean 
Anti-Red Priest Leads Foes of 'Thieu 
By JAMES M. MARKHAM 
Spedat to The New York Times 
SAIGON, South Vietnam, 
Oct. 18?The Roman Catholic 
priest at the of the thinly dis-
guised movement to oust Pres-
ident Nguyen van Thieu reck-
ons that 3,000 South Vietna-
mese colonels and lieutenant 
colonels passed through his 
courses on anti-Communist 
Psychological warfare. 
"Among my students, I can 
count six generals," said the 
Rev. Tran Huu Thanh, chuckl-
ing. "It is because of this that 
'Thieu is afraid of me." 
Father Thanh no longer gives 
those courses, because he is 
busy trying to get President 
Thieu to resign. He sees no con-
tradiction between the lifetime 
he has spent combating Vietna-
mese Communists and his cur-
rent efforts to overturn their 
No. I enemy. ? 
"It is a labor that I have pre-
pared for over the past 30 
years," the priest said, speaking 
French. Father Thanh, a calm 
man on the surface, chain-
smokes even at demonstrations, 
flecking ashes over his black 
soutane. 
About two months ago, the 
59-year-old priest, a member of 
the Redemptorlst orcer, entered 
a tentative opposition scene 
that was dominated by over-fa-
miliar names and faces, veter-
ans of unsuccessful causes. 
He had begun his pastorate at 
Hue at the end of World War 
H, training young Catholics to 
counter the mounting influence 
of the Vietminh. And it was 
there that he began his cam-
paign against Mr. Thieu. 
In Hue last Sept. 8 Father 
Thanh and several thousand de-
monstrators were tear-gassed 
by South Vietnamese police-
men. He had launched a de-
Tear-Gassed at Hue i 
monstration, ?and his political 
career, with an audacious, six-
point accusation that charged 
President Thieu and his family 
with gross acts of corruption. 
Since then "Accusation No. 
i 
1," as t was called, promising 
others to come, has become the 
catalyst of a revived opposi-
tion Mr. Thieu has been put on 
the defensive, at least for the 
moment, and Father Thanh is 
the Opposition's hottest politi-
cal property. 
'Tacit Approal' of Rome 
The priest says that he has 
the "tacit approal" of the Vati-
can for his activities. That be-
came apparent on the morning 
of Oct. 1, a day when P?res-, 
ident Thieu was to go on the airl 
to defend himself, and when 
the cautious Archbishop of Sai-
gon, the Most Rev. Nguy-
en Van Binh, endorsed the anti-
corruption front. 
"We are only demanding, at 
first changes in the Govern-
ment, not a change of the 
Government," Father Thanh 
said, ticking off a familiar list 
of generals frequently accused 
of corruption. But he said that 
he "certainly" hoped that Pres-
ident Thieu would ultimately 
resign. "But softly, not by 
force," he was quick to add. , 
Mr. Thieu's resignation, he 
speculated, could be followed 
by elections for a constitutent 
assembly in which the commu-
nists would be invited to parti-
cipate "in a political party, like 
in France," as he put it "We 
accept the Communists in the 
bosom of Vietnamese politics," 
he said. 
Though he has spent his adult 
years trying to undo the politi-
cal handiwork of-the Vietminh 
and .the Vietcong, he obviously 
retains an admiration for their 
skills at indoctrination: "They 
use logic," he said. 
While he is generally pigeon-
holed as a "rightist Catholic," 
he says he endorses "the' Com-
munists' Promises of social re-
form" while rejecting their au-
thoritarian methods. "That is 
why, even todaytoday, my anti-
Communisin is different from 
that of this Government," he 
said. 
The early work in Hue honed 
his anti-Communism. ."Of 80 
cadres I had, 40 were arrested 
and shot by the Vietminh," he 
said deferring to workers. In 
1954, he was sent by Rome to 
northeastern Thailand to work 
among pro-Communist Vietna-
mese refugees and afterward to 
Hanoi,, where he aided people 
seeking to flee the north in the 
wake of the Geneva agreements 
that created the two Vinams. 
"I left Hanoi by the last air-' 
plane," he said, and the next 
day Ho Chi Minh came into 
Hanoi. Father Thanh returned 
to Saigon and presented to 
them Premier Ngo Dinh Diem a 
plan for a network of anti-Com-
munit agents along what was 
to become known as the Ho Chi 
Minh trail, in Laos and 'Cambo-
dia. The plan was rejected but 
Father Thanh was offered the 
job of forming Republican 
Youth cadres under the direc-
tion of Ngo Dinh Nhu, the Pre-
mier:s brother and the power fi-
gure of the regime. 
Subsequently, the young 
priest was appointed head of 
the School of Personalism and 
set about writing textbooks on 
the foggy, eclectic doctrine to 
which the new government 
tried to anchor itself as an in-
tellectual counterweight to 
Communism. This was a mix-
ture of the Christian existentia-
lism of Gabriel Marcel, Domini-
can ideas about the distribution 
of wealth and Mr. Nhrs -perso-
nal philosophical insights. 
ark foe 
Supreme Court recently asked 
the Appeals Court to review 
the Kim case, the favorable 
Supreme Court action has 
served to further drag out the 
already, lengthy, proceedings. 
Meanwhile, the government 
says Mr! Kim cannot leave the 
country as long as the court 
case is unresolved. 
Mr. Kim said he wants to 
accept a teaching position at 
Harvard University. In addi-
tion, he said he wants to un-
dergo medical treatment in the 
United States. 
He said that, although he has 
been told he should be hospi-
I talized, he is afraid to enter a 
South Korean hospital for fear 
of being drugged, poisoned or 
killed in the hospital. 
Mr. Kim's situation has also 
made life difficult for other 
members of the Kim family. 
His second son, for example. 
has been unable to get a job, 
and Mr. Kim's wife and chil-

CHILE IS ACCUSED 
BY JURISTS GROUP 
kternation'al-BodY beClareS 
I 'Repression Is Widespread 
* and More Systematic 
Special to The New York Times 
GENEVA, Oct. 23?The Inter-
national Commission of Jurists 
charged today that political re-
pression in Chile was now 
"more ubiquitous and more 
systematic" than at any time 
since President Salvadore Al-
lende Gossens was overthrown 
by the military 13 months ago. 
"For every detainee who has 
been released in recnt months 
at last two new arrests have 
been made," the commission 
said. 
The 40-member commission 
Is a private organiziion based 
in Geneva that draws support 
from lawyers groups in na-
tional chapters in 50 countries. 
It describes itself as "strictly 
nonpolitical" and is recog-
nized by the United Nations. 
The commission gathers in-
formation for its reports from 
lawyers on the spot, observers 
sent to follow trials and spe-
cial teams such as the three-
man group that went to Chile 
last May to study the situation 
there. 
Lawyers Supplied Data 
Most of the information'in 
today's report was obtained 
from Chilean defense lawyers, 
the commission' secretary gen-
eral, Niall MacDermott, a Brit-
ish lawyer, said. "I cannot be 
more precise than that," he 
declared. 
? The commission said that 
from May to August there were 
700 known arrests of political 
suspects in Chile. Most of the 
? arrests, it said, were carried 
out without warrants by un-
identified persons in plain 
clothes armed with machine 
guns. 
Since Miguel Enriquez, lead-
er of the Movement of the Rev-
olutionary Left, was killed on 
Oct. 5 in a shotout with secu-
rity forces there have been 600 
further arrests, according to 
the report. 
.The commission said that the 
announcement last month by 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, 
the head of Chile's military jun-
ta, that the "state of war" was 
being ended and that all prison-
ers who were prepared to go 
abroad would be released was 
'designed for external con-
sumption." 
The legal system, it declared, 
"continues to contravene basic 
principles of justice accepted by 
civilized nations." 
Besides individual arrests, 
there are mass arrests in the 
shantytowns, with the inten-
tion apparently being to intimi-
date the population, the com-
mission said. Some 10,000 to 
15,000 people have been arrest-
ed in this way in recent 
months, it reported, with most 
being released after seven to 10 
days. 
The effect of such measures, 
including the extension of mili-
tary control over the schools, 
has been t "heighten the fear 
and tension ainong the working 
population," the commission 
said. 
'The Great Injury' 
? Before the military coup 
d'etat Chile was a "participa-
tory democracy," the commis-
sion said, in which all sections 
of the population through trade 
unions, professional associa-
tions and other groups took an 
active part in the national life. 
"All this has now been sys-
tematically supressed," the 
'commission said. "This is per-
haps the greatest injury of all 
to have been inflicted on the 
people of Chile." 
The present members of the 
commission include Edgar 
:Faure, the former French Pre-
mier; Masatoshi Yokota, the 
!former Chief Justice of Japan's 
Supreme Court; Sir Adetokunbo 
!Ademola, the former Chief Jus-
tice of Nigeria, and Eli Whitney 
Debevoise, a New York lawyer, 
' who is chairman of the five-
man executive committee. 
Another member is Sean 
;MacBride, winner of hte Nobel 
Peace Prize and former Irish 
;Foreign Minister. Mr. MacBride 
:served ,for seven years as sec-
retary general of the commis-
sion.

U. S. Policy and Soviet Subs 
By Barry M. Blechman and 
Stephanie E. Levinson. 
WASHINGTON ? Today marks the 
twelfth anniversary of the Cuban mis-
sile crisis. At its conclusion, in 1962, 
the Soviet Union conceded that it 
would no longer deploy strategic of-
fensive weapons in Cuba. 
Eight years later, in September, 
1970, after renewed tensions, this 
commitment was broadened to disal-
low the servicing of submarines from 
Cuban ports. 
Let, last April, a Soviet Golf-class 
?this is an Atlantic alliance designa-
tion?diesel-powered strategic missile 
submarine visited Havana. No confron-
tation ensued this time. What hap-
pened to bring about this change? And 
what implications can be drawn from 
this incident for United States policy? 
There is no question that in 1970 
the Soviet Union built a facility for 
servicing submarines at the Cuban 
'port of Cienfuegos. The construction 
work included barracks, recreational 
facilities, a water tower, rehabilitation 
.of an existing pier, and the sinking of 
moorings for visiting submarines. 
Also, two barges, associated exclu-
sively with the disposal of effluents 
from nuclear-power plants, were 
brought to the port. All these facilities 
Still remain. All that is necessary to 
make use of the base is the arrival of 
a' submarineand a tender. . 
As a result of United States pro- i 
tests, Soviet plans to operate from the 
port were shelved, at least temporari-
ly. An understanding was reached in 
1970 defining what the Soviet Union s 
would and would not do with respect 
to the basing of naval vessels in Cuba. 
But this agreement remains secret to s 
all but a handful of officials. Further- e 
more, the official United States inter-
pretation of the agreement seems to 
have narrowed. 
Initially, United States concern over a 
the Cienfuegos facilities was directed 
at preventing the Soviet Union from N 
basing strategic missile submarines in a 
the Western Hemisphere. In this sense, c 
the understanding was viewed as 
an extension of the 1962 Kennedy-
Khruslichev agreement on nondeploy-
ment of strategic weapons in Cuba. 
In the face of recent visits by the 
Golf-class submarine, the understand-
ing is now interpreted to apply only 
to nuclear-powered vessels. 
The Defense Department's current 
position is summarized in a statement 
by former President Nixon in January, 
1971, that "in the event that nuclear 
subs were serviced in Cuba, or from 
Cuba, that would be a violation of the 
understanding." 
If, in fact, this, was an accurate de-
scription of the agreement, it was vio-
lated in February, 1971. That month, 
a nuclear-powered November-class 
submarine with a tender visited Cien-
fuegos. Whether the submarine actu-
ally was serviced in the port remains 
a moot point, but there were no Unit-
ed States protests. Nor did the United 
States protest subsequent visits by-
Echo-class submarines ?nuclear-pow-
ered vessels carrying tactical missiles. 
It seems evident that the So-
viet Union has been probing the 
margins of the 1970 understanding. It 
has done the following, in this order: 
put a nuclear-powered attack subma-
rine into Cienfuegos with a tender, 
put a nuclear-powered tactical missile 
submarine into Cienfuegos with a 
tender, diesel-poweredstrategic 
missile submarine into a different Cu-
ban port quietly, and put a diesel-
powered strategic missile submarine 
nto a different Cuban port publicly. 
This is just what may be learned from 
the public record. 
The ramifications of this activity 
hould not be overstated. The Soviet 
Union has not, as yet, challenged the 
understanding directly, by for example 
ending a Yankee-class nuclear-pow-
red strategiv submarine into Cien-
uegos. 
Nonetheless, it seems clear that the 
oviet Union is gradually but deliber-
tely encroaching upon the agreement. 
? Since the military advantages that 
vould result from the establishment of 
submarine base in Cuba are not 
ommensurate with the risk of pro..

A TIMES REPORTER 
IS BARRED BY CHILE 
SANTIAGO, Chile, Oct. l4 
(UPI) ? The military Govern-
ment annOunced today that a 
New York Times correspondent, 
Jonathan Kandell, had been 
permanently banned from the 
country. Mr. Kandell was 
turned back when he arrived at 
the airport. 
Comdr. Enrique Montero, Un-
der Secretary of the Interior, 
yoking a strong political response by 
the United States, Soviet motives must 
be more complex. 
? In effect, the submarine visits pro-
vide a test of United States willing-
? ness to take risks in its broad relations 
with the Soviet Union in order to 
prevent a shift in the two sides' rela-
tive military capabilitie 
- If this indeed is the Russians' pur-
pose, then the United States response 
to the visits?essentially an endorse-
ment of the Russions' conduct?can 
only encourare similar future actions. 
Thus, thij series of submarine visits 
to Cuba poses a political challenge for-
United States foreign policy. 
More important, if this Soviet tactic 
is successful over the long-term United 
States reluctance to insist on compli-
ance with the accord could help bring 
into question its credibility in world ? 
affairs. Ahe implication of this assess-
ment is that the United States should 
adopt a firm attitude toward Soviet 
submarine activity in the Caribbean. 
This does not mean that all opera-
tions should become a cause celebre. 
It would be difficult to balk at those 
types of visits for which the Soviet 
Union has established precedents. 
New ?steps, however, such as the 
servicing of a Golf-class sub in Cien-
fuegos, should stir a strong reaction. 
Only by demonstrating a willingness 
to make issues of single events that 
in isolation appear relatively insig-
nificant can the United States cause 
the Soviet Union to understand that 
normalizing our relations requires 
mutual concessions. 
Barry M. Blechman and Stephanie E. 
Levinson are staff members of the
