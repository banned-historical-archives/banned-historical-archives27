 GORBACHEV IN ASIA
 The key questions are:
 What is Gorbachev trying to do in Asia with his new initiatives?
 How will the Asians react?
 How far will the Soviets go if the Asians play along, or fail to
 respond?
 The first question is easy:  Gorbachev is trying to turn the USSR from a
 badly underachieving actor into something more like a real political
 superpower in Asia.  The gap between the Soviet image of what they ought to be
 and where they are is perhaps wider in Asia than it is in the Middle East.
 The Soviet military power base is considerable and has been growing.
 But it is still rickety as a base for political power.  Soviet land
 combat power is largely limited to facing China.  The navy is
 susceptible to being bottled up.  Nuclear strike forces offend the
 locals without gaining the USSR much political clout.
 Soviet clients and allies -- Vietnam, Mongolia, North Korea -- are
 weak, isolated, and two not really under Soviet control.
 The USSR is from nowhere on the economic front, while East Asia
 witnesses a Wirtschaftswunder impressing the whole world.
 Gorbachev wants to break into this scene.  His tools are:
 A vague Asian Security System/Conference (a loser for Brezhnev 15
 years ago).
 A series of very niggardly "offerings" to China (Mongolian
 deployments, possible dealings on regional arms control, promise of
 better relations) and Japan (visits to the N. Territories, economic
 inducements) to see what can be got on the cheap.
 A lot of diplomatic flag-showing in regional capitals.
 This is certainly only a beginning.  But it is not clear whether Gorbachev
 is now willing to go further in substance to sweeten his offerings to Asia.
 Because of the great overhang of Soviet military power, he has the
 most room for maneuver on Sino-Soviet military/border issues.  But
 the Chinese are also the hardest to bamboozle with moves that don't
 really change their regional security situation.

 The Soviets are not as inflexible as they sound on the Northern
 Territories.  They are probably (and some senior Soviets have said
 so) willing to give on this issue for something really big, e.g., to
 finalize a real break in US-Japanese security relations.  But the
 Japanese are not so stupid.
 For the USSR to go very far on other issues, e.g., Indochina,
 Afghanistan, regional military balance, they risk their present
 equities in the region and might end up worse off than they are
 without changing Asia's orientation.
 How will Asia react?  We already have indications of mild interest but
 great skepticism, a kind of collective shrug of the shoulders.
 Moscow lacks political/psychological leverage of the sort it still
 has in Europe:  A "longing" to overcome the division of the Old
 Continent (and for the Germans, their country), and a lingering
 leftist nostalgia for solidarity with the Land of Revolution.  Most
 Asians are not touched by this sentimentality.
 Whatever their problems with the US, the Asians don't want another
 superpower, especially of the Soviet type, stomping around their
 region.  What's it get them?  From a power-political point of view,
 only trouble.  From the economic point of view, only the opportunity
 to provide charity.
 Local and even internal political/security issues can give the
 Soviets entree in some areas -- which regional experts must track.
 But these don't seem to promise to carry the Soviets into a new
 position of influence, unless there is an internal upheaval in China
 that somehow works to Soviet favor.
 China is at the top of the list.  But Chinese and Soviet aims are quite
 antithetical.  China wants to use a modest Sino-Soviet rapprochement to assert
 the independence of its foreign policy, to gently pressure Washington to be
 more accommodating to China, to influence Soviet behavior, and generally to
 underwrite China's emergence as a regional superpower.  If the USSR is ready
 to restrict its own ambitions sharply and to support China's, China will
 applaud.  But Soviet aims are the opposite, and China will not applaud.
 From Japan, the Soviets want erosion of the security tie to the US,
 limitation on Japanese military potential in the future, and economic help.
 It has very little to offer to get this; the islands are not enough, unless
 Japanese internal politics go haywire.  Economic cooperation could be tempting
 in principle, but would require the Soviets to go beyond their present
 policies on joint ventures to make it profitable for the Japanese.
 The stance of the United States, is a crucial factor.  If isolationism and
 protectionism or a body blow to out military posture (e.g., in the
 Philippines) were to alter the fact and image of US superpower commitment to
 East Asia, the Soviets would have much better prospects for the game they want
 to play.
 Excessive US anxiety about current Soviet diplomacy in the region
 could also give the Soviets leverage.

 Assuming the US does not pull back from the region and that its countries
 are only mildly interested in Soviet approaches, but generally resistant to
 Soviet regional ambitions -- what do the Soviets do?  Probably more of the
 same.
 The Soviet foreign policy dilemma in Asia is of a piece with the entirety
 of Soviet foreign policy, made somewhat more visible by the lack of the
 "peace-arms control-detente" charade which can be played in Europe.  The
 Soviet Union has only three ways to be a real superpower on a par with the US
 as it wishes to be:
 The way it now proceeds, through a combination of essentially
 deceptive diplomacy (arms control, detente, etc.), aimed at
 magnifying the USSR's importance at little risk or cost, and
 subversion/penetration of vulnerable spots.
 A bolder, more aggressive effort to project military cum subversive
 power in regions, to elicit cooperation (Finlandization) from the
 locals by threatening them more directly.
 To join the community of advanced and advancing nations by paying the
 price of membership in reforms to the external policies and the
 internal life of the USSR.
 In the late 1970s and early 1980s, we feared the Soviets might be headed
 for a global policy of the second type because the US seemed in decline and
 Soviet power in the ascendancy.  But Soviet internal problems, US resurgence,
 and the enduring difficulties of playing raw power politics in the nuclear age
 blocked this development.  It is not precluded in the future, but the risks to
 the USSR are great.
 The third course really means a basic change, in a civilized direction, of
 the nature of the USSR and of its role in the world.  Gorbachev wants us to
 think he's headed in this direction.  We are unconvinced.  Nevertheless, the
 logic of history has its claims, too.  Even as the NomEklatura and Russian
 tradition resist, history pushes in this direction.  But these prospects
 cannot mature unless the outside world denies the USSR full superpower status
 based on imperial foundations, in Asia and elsewhere.

 The vector of Central Intelligence
 Washington, D.C. 20505
 National Intelligence Council
 NIC #04254-86
 11 September 1986
 MEMORANDUM FOR:     Director of Central Intelligence
 Deputy Director of Central Intelligence
 FROM:               Carl W. Ford, Jr.
 National Intelligence Officer for East Asia
 SUBJECT:            Secretary Shultz's Asia Seminar:  Sino-Soviet Relations
 and the US
 1.  Gorbachev's Vladivostok speech with its enticements for improving
 relations with China set off alarm bells in Washington and stimulated the
 Department of State to order a review of American foreign policy in Asia.
 Secretary Shultz, as a part of this process, has invited a number of key
 policy officials and outside experts to participate in a 13 September seminar
 examining Soviet intentions and activity in Asia.  Much of the excitement and
 attention among Soviet specialists focuses on the motives for Gorbachev's
 initiative and whether or not Russian rhetoric will be followed by substantial
 concessions.  Asian watchers look for signs that Beijing may be prepared to
 take the Soviets' bait.
 2.     Those assembled by Shultz can be expected to conclude that:
 -- Gorbachev's more sophisticated diplomatic offensive, coupled with the
 Soviet military muscle in Asia will be a far greater challenge to US
 interests in the Pacific basin than the ham-handed, might is right
 approach that traditionally has alienated and frightened most Asians.
 -- The Soviet Union's relations with China will improve somewhat if Moscow
 is prepared to make concessions along the Sino-Soviet border and more
 so, if the Cambodian obstacle is overcome.
 -- But, Beijing is not expected to alter its current stance and
 orientation significantly.  No one, for example, will argue that
 Sino-Soviet relations are returning to those of the early 1950s.

 -- Some, however, will probably suggest that the new circumstances make it
 even more important that the US take Chinese sensitivities into account
 in our dealings with Taiwan (read: pressing Taipei on reunification and
 being more careful on arms sales).
 -- In short, the US faces more complex challenges and potentially
 troubling relationships with both Beijing and Moscow in the years
 ahead, but is not on the verge of a calamitous change in Sino-Soviet
 relations.
 3.  In support of this assessment, virtually all China watchers accept as
 an article of faith that Deng's opening to the West, and to the US in
 particular, signaled a fundamental shift in direction for China that will not
 be easily reversed by Deng or his successors.  The twin challenges of the long
 term Soviet military threat and the requirements of economic modernization
 dictate that for now China will not adopt a genuinely equidistant position in
 its relations with Moscow and Washington.
 4.  But, the close working relationship envisaged by many US policymakers
 in 1979 and the early 1980s--when Deng talked of China, Japan and the US
 coordinating their activities to block advances by the "Polar Bear"--is a
 thing of the past.  Increasingly, Beijing talks about a foreign policy
 independent of both superpowers and signals in various ways and deeds that
 such an objective is more than mere rhetoric.  Prime Minister Hawke of
 Australia, for example, quotes Deng Xiaoping's approach to the Soviets as, "We
 want to improve economic relations and political relations, but in the end we
 will be friends but never allies," strikingly similar to the Chinese
 description of Sino-US relations.
 5.  The optimistic interpretation of Chinese intentions holds that while
 China's foreign policy rhetoric may have changed somewhat and even some
 backsliding may have occurred in its relations with Washington, Deng and other
 leaders privately still tilt decidedly toward the US.

 They note that China has not changed its fundamental assessment of the Soviet
 threat--nor it is even reevaluating it.  At the same time, they contend that
 Beijing is well aware that too positive a response to Gorbachev's proposals

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/07: CIA-RDP88GO1117R000903350002-9
 could jeopardize its access to US, Japanese, and Western European advanced
 technology, investment, trade, and defense cooperation--major Chinese
 political goals.  Nor does Beijing want to signal its friends and enemies in
 Southeast and South Asia that it might reconsider its stand on Cambodia and
 Afghanistan.
 6.  While not quarreling with essential judgments, a revisionist
 view--admittedly speculative and only a whisper among the chorus--paints a
 somewhat less sanguine picture of US-China relations than suggested by the
 more upbeat conventional wisdom.  It contends that China has already moved
 more equidistant between the two superpowers than most analyst wish to admit
 and many policymakers would be comfortable considering.

 RELATIONS WITH
 MOSCOW AND WASHINGTON
 EQUIDISTANT

 It does not contradict Ambassador Lord's view that, "we can believe the
 Chinese when they assert flatly that they will never return to the
 relationship of the 1950s."  It also accepts the view of last year's NIE,
 "that for the next two years and probably longer Beijing will not move to an
 equidistant position in its relations with Moscow and Washington."  But, while
 the "three obstacles" remain an impediment to equidistant relations with
 Washington and Moscow for now, it believes the clear trend is for Beijing to
 move more toward the center and maximize its leverage with both superpowers.
 7. Although this quasi-debate strikes me as simply a variation on the old
 argument of whether or not the glass is half full or half empty, there are
 several observations worth making.
 -- China in the conduct of its international relations operates on the
 principle of national interests not friendship.  In fact, we know that
 the Chinese instead use friendship to entangle unsuspecting
 interlocutors for tactical advantage.
 In its drive to become the predominant power in Asia and a major actor
 on the world stage China will increasingly run afoul of US interests
 and alliance relationships as it pursues economic/trade advantages and
 political influence.

 -- Our habit of justifying US-China relations on the basis of a common
 enemy--the Soviet Union--and parallel strategic interests masks
 Beijing's perception of the United States as a secondary, but
 important, long-term adversary, and gives China more opportunity to
 play one superpower off against the other.  A failure to appreciate the
 flip side of this coin could over the longer term undermine US
 interests.
 8.  In fact, we have operated in Asia during the last decade or so under
 especially ideal conditions.  It has been a time when Communist nations fought
 and bickered:
 -- China and the Soviet Union faced off along their common border with a
 real danger that it could lead to major hostilities.
 -- China's invasion of Vietnam ended a long close relationship between
 communist neighbors.
 -- Hanoi became bogged down in a no-win war in Cambodia.
 -- Khmer Rouge atrocities soured several generations of non-communist
 Asians (except in the Philippines) on the promises of communist
 revolution.
 -- North Korean miscalculations and blunders, such as the Rangoon bombing,
 left the regime isolated from civilized nations and, for the most part,
 even its communist allies.
 9.  At the same time, our friends and allies prospered:
 -- Japan rocketed to the number two most potent economy in the world.
 -- Asia's "Tigers," South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, emerged with
 strong economies and equally strong connections with the US.
 -- ASEAN somehow hung together and began to make its influence felt.
 Particularly important, despite some reservations on the part of
 Indonesia and Malaysia, was ASEAN's united stand in support of Thailand
 and opposition to Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia.
 -- Also, American troops have not been engaged in combat in Asia in over a
 decade.
 10. But, the future does not look nearly so bright:
 -- Japan's economic success and the progress several other Asian nations
 have made has now begun to pinch--the shoe will get smaller, count on
 it!
 -- Relations with Australia and New Zealand will become more complicated,
 if not worse.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/07: CIA-RDP88GO1117R000903350002-9
 -- And, a communist victory in the Philippines could dangerously undermine
 US strategic interests in the region.
 11.  Even more worrisome is the possibility that the splits between the
 communist powers in Asia over the past 15 years, which we have benefited from
 greatly, may have been more anomaly than real.  We are unlikely to be so lucky
 over the next 10-15 years.  Although a monolithic communist block is not in
 the cards, look for closer relations and cooperation between Moscow, Beijing,
 Pyongyang, and Hanoi, not less.
 12.  We also should not get so bogged down measuring the legs of the
 strategic triangle and boldly predicting no return to the 1950s, that we lose
 sight of the fact that it is almost certainly in China's interest to have
 better if not warm relations with Moscow.
 13.  Improved Sino-Soviet relations and even an equidistant relationship,
 however, need not seriously harm US interests.  We still retain important
 political, economic, and military advantages for protecting and advancing US
 interests in Asia.  The danger lies in not adjusting policies incrementally as
 new situations and conditions pertain.  In fact, I suspect that much of the
 passion expended arguing China's continued tilt to the west and the stress put
 on the Soviet Union being China's principal adversary, stems primarily from
 present and future policy considerations.
 14.  Our China policy is essentially founded on the state of play in the
 world circa 1979--China seriously at odds with the Soviet Union, in a shooting
 war with Vietnam and having newly normalized relations with the United
 States.   Seen from this perspective, policies such as transferring dual use
 and military technology to China, and restricting arms sales to Taiwan make
 some sense.
 15.  But, if you accept the proposition that circumstances have changed,
 if only a little, and the future prospects are somewhat more worrisome, you
 might expect some rethinking and fine tuning of our approach coming out of
 State and the Pentagon.  Instead, we put the best face on the changes
 occurring in Asia and especially Sino-Soviet relations, and continue to march
 down the same road--only faster.  Quite frankly, I would be far more
 comfortable with marching on, but a little more carefully.

 Possible Soviet Initiatives Along The Chinese Border
 Summary
 Gorbachev's. comments in Vladivostok last month indicate that
 his regime is indeed making a more determined effort to improve
 the USSR's position in Asia, as several Soviet officials have
 predicted within the past year.          His remarks also suggest that
 the Soviets, after years of 'hanging tough,' are now willing to
 address at least some of China's main security concerns--
 especially on its northern border--in order to achieve that goal.
 The Soviets could follow-up on Gorbachev's speech in various
 -- Adopt a more conciliatory position on China's territorial
 claims against the USSR.
 -- Announce a token force reduction in the Soviet Far East.
 -- Withdraw some of their forces from Mongolia.
 Judging from the evidence at hand, the Mongolian option may be
 exercised first, perhaps even before the next round of Sino-
 Soviet political consultations is held in Beijing this October.
 The Soviets could, however, hold off until after the October
 round ends, if only to get a better reading of Chinese intentions
 before making any concessions.
 This memorandum was prepared byl                      Office of Soviet

 JGI.RL I
 Gorbachev has not made any promises on the China border
 question akin to his announcement that the Soviets will withdraw
 six regiments from Afghanistan by the end of this year.   But he
 has shown more flexibility than any of his predecessors on three
 issues--the Sino-Soviet border dispute, troop deployments on both
 sides of that boundary line, and the Soviet military presence in
 Mongolia.   These issues together are one part of the "three
 obstacles" cited by China as impediments to improved relations
 between Beijing and Moscow; the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan
 and Soviet support for Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia are the
 other two.
 In his Vladivostok speech, Gorbachev spoke about turning the
 frontier between the USSR and China into a  'zone of peace and
 friendship" and noted that the two sides had already taken a few
 steps in that direction, especially along the Amur River in the
 Far East.   He added that the official border there "could pass
 along the main navigation channel"--raising the possibility of a
 deal  regarding Chimnaya Island (Heixiazi), opposite Khabarovsk--
 long a major sticking point in the Sino-Soviet border
 negotiations. According to                          the Sino-Soviet
 border talks during the 1970s,   or ac ev
 offer to cede that island to the Chinese.
 Gorbachev also called for major force reductions in Asia and
 proposed starting in the Far East, adding that Moscow was ready
 to discuss with Beijing "specific steps aimed at a balanced
 reduction in the level of land forces."  His statement on that
 point was the first time any top Soviet leader has publicly
 endorsed reductions of that sort since the Soviet
 buildup opposite China began in the mid-1960s.
 Gorbachev also announced that the Soviet and Mongolian
 leaders are examining the question of the withdrawal of a
 "considerable number" of what we believe to be 60,000 Soviet
 troops now stationed in Mongolia.   He said nothing about any
 preconditions for such a withdrawal.   No Soviet leader has ever
 publicly stated that the USSR was considering reducing its forces
 in Mongolia--some units have been there "temporarily" since
 1966.   Moreover, both Moscow and Ulaanbaatar have insisted for
 nearly a decade that China must sign a nonaggression pact with
 Mongolia or find another way to alleviate Mongolian security
 concerns before       oviet troops can be withdrawn from
 Mongolia.
 Concrete progress on any of these matters will, of course,
 require a good deal of give on both sides.   Beijing has

 SECRETI
 stonewalled repeated Soviet requests for a resumption of their
 border talks, and Moscow has insisted repeatedly that it will not
 improve relations with China at the expense of its friends or
 allies like Mongolia.   But Gorbachev and his colleagues
 reportedly are convinced that Moscow has made some mistakes with
 China over the past few years, as Gorbachev himself reportedly
 stated in a wide-ranging critique of  oviet foreign policy
 They may believe that an
 of its main security
 concerns is worth certain risks, given the strategic importance
 of China in their overall  scheme of things.
 -- Sino-Soviet relations still lag behind China's ties with
 the West, and Moscow could lose more political ground by
 standing still if Washington and Beijing move closer.
 -- An improvement in Sino-Soviet ties would weaken the US
 position in the Sino-Soviet-US triangle.  Moscow also may
 again hope for an opDortunit      influence Chinese
 domestic politics.
 The following is a speculative look at various steps that
 the Soviets might take--based on what we know about their
 territorial dispute with China, the military balance along
 China's northern perimeter, and the situation in Mongolia--to
 follow up on Gorbachev's speech in Vladivostok.   We would
 emphasize at the outset, however, that the Kremlin has yet to
 admit that there are any "disputed areas" along the border with
 China, or that its military forces in that area pose any "threat"
 to the Chinese.
 Possible Soviet Moves on the Border Dispute
 The Soviets have asked the Chinese on a number of occasions
 over the past five years to agree to a resumption of their border
 negotiations, which have been suspended since June 1978.   To
 encourage the Chinese, Moscow could take a more conciliatory
 position than previously on some or all of Beijing's main
 demands--that Moscow admit that certain parcels of land are in
 dispute, withdraw its military forces from those areas (all of

 them are in Soviet hands at present), and agree in advance to
 return all territory that is subsequently determined to be
 rightfully China's.  A few Chinese leaders have, in recent years,
 hinted at some flexibility on those points in their own public
 statements, and while the Soviets almost certainly are not
 prepared at present to make wholesale concessions, they may be
 willing to make some conciliatory gestures:
 -- The Soviets might start the bargaining by proposing that
 both sides keep their regular army units and border guard
 detachments out of all disputed areas along their common
 border (see map 1).   This gesture would cost Moscow very
 little in military terms, but probably would be seen as a
 significant move in Beijing.   The Soviets currently have
 only small border guard units stationed within those
 disputed areas.
 They could recognize Beijing's claims to almost all of the
 700 disputed islands in the Amur and Ussuri Rivers.   Most
 of those islands have little importance in either economic
 or military terms.   The Soviets could, at the same time,
 offer to purchase the strategically important Chimnaya
 Island [Heixiazi], opposite the city of Khabarovsk.   We
 doubt that they would hand the island over to the Chinese,
 however, except as part of a final settlement on the
 border dispute.
 -- They might revive their suggestion about setting up a
 joint commission to restudy the old treaties and other
 relevent documents, and then conduct a new survey before
 installing additional border markers where needed.   This
 approach would finesse for the moment the question of
 which documents, other than formal treaties signed by both
 sides, have a legitimate bearing on the subject.
 Potential  Force Reductions in the Soviet Far East
 The Soviets could make some token unilateral gestures
 involving their forces opposite China.   Although our
 understanding of how the Soviets see their military requirements
 in that part of the world is imprecise, we can conceive of
 several  "disengagement" packages that would probably not disturb
 the existing balance of forces.  The USSR has such an overall
 advantage vis-a-vis China that even if the Soviet air and ground
 troops in the area were cut by as much as ten percent--that is,
 by about 60-70,000--they would still retain a decisive local
 advantage in ground forces.   While Beijing has about 1.7 million
 troops opposite the USSR and Mongolia, its armed forces have much
 less firepower and mobility than Soviet or Mongolian units.
 China's main forces are, moreover, based 100-200 miles back from

 SECRET
 the border, and thus hardly in a position to mount a sudden
 offensive into the USSR or Mongolia.   This situation may change
 in the coming years because the Chinese have abandoned their old
 strategy of "luring the enemy in deep" for a more forward defense
 posture,2 but the Soviets have a good opportunity at present to
 deal from strength.   While they presumably remain unwilling to
 make moves which would significantly alter the military balance,
 they could:
 -- Withdraw or deactivate one or more of their ground force
 divisions stationed in the Soviet Far East near the
 Chinese border.   Units guarding strategic targets, such as
 the Trans-Siberian Railroad or the Vladivostok naval base,
 probably would not be pulled out, but other units in that
 area could be moved and not have a major impact on Soviet
 capabilities.
 -- Withdraw some SS-20s from areas close to China.   The
 Soviets would, however, have a hard time finding
 alternative sites that would not have adverse effects on
 European arms negotiations.
 A leadership decision to remove significant numbers of
 Soviet troops from the Chinese border would test Gorbachev's grip
 on the Soviet Ministry of Defense.   There are signs that he has
 been managing leadership relations with the military pretty well
 so far, and in the end would probably get his way on ChJnPsP
 border cuts of the size contemplated in this analysis.
 Reducing the Soviet Presence in Mongolia
 While determined to keep Mongolia in the Soviet camp, the
 Kremlin could undertake any one of several moves to alleviate
 Beijing's concern over the extent to which Mongolia has been
 transformed into a staging area for an offensive Soviet drive
 into China.   The five Soviet divisions stationed in Mongolia are
 the most combat-ready Soviet ground forces facing China.  These
 divisions, plus the three divisions that the Mongolians now have,
 have acquired added importance in recent years as a counterweight
 to the Chinese buildup on the Vietnamese border.   The Soviets
 could withdraw one or more divisions at this time, however,
 without seriously eroding their overall security situation.
 Indeed, they would only be trimming their military presence in
 Mongolia back to its level during the 1970s.   A move of this sort
 would not necessarily call into question Moscow's support for

 Ulaanbaatar, and it could easily be reversed by reintroducing the
 withdrawn units if Sino-Soviet relations worsened.
 -- Moscow also could make a greater effort to promote a Sino-
 Mongolian political dialogue, especially if the Chinese
 gave any sign of a willingness to negotiate a
 nonaggression pact or an agreement on nonuse of force with
 the Mongolians.
 -- The Soviets may regard the consular pact signed during the
 recent visit to Mongolia by a Chinese vice foreign
 minister, the first agreement of its kind between China
 and Mongolia in over 20 years, as an earnest of Chinese
 good intentions toward Mongolia
 We have examined the possibility that Moscow might, as a
 more significant gesture, offer to keep all  regular ground force
 units, as distinguished from KGB border guards, some distance--
 say, 30 kilometers--from the Chinese border.   Such an offer could
 even be part of a package of confidence-building measures (CBMs)
 that also provided for advance notice of any military exercises
 or major troop movements within, say, 200 kilometers of the
 border, better cross-border communications, and the like.
 Our analysis of the Soviet force posture along the bores
 indicates, however, that creation of such a narrow "demilitarized
 zone" would require the USSR to relocate some seven divisions and
 dicmantla an extensive system of fortified zones along the border
 A move of this magnitude would, in our view, be
 we    beyond the kinds of gestures examined so far and have
 significant strategic implications.   It would, for example,
 require the Soviets to leave long segments of the Trans-Siberian
 Railroad unprotected, and probably would have large cost
 implications.   Accordingly, we believe that such a demilitarized
 zone, while probably impressive to the Chinese, would be such an
 important military concession by the Soviets that it would be
 seriously considered only as part of a major political
 agreement.
 Implications
 Although all of these possible gestures would fall well
 short of Beijing's stated demands regarding the "threat from the
 North," they would point to a Soviet willingness to discuss

 Chinese concerns in that area seriously.  In time, moreover, they,
 might lead to further progress on the Sino-Soviet border dispute,
 significant force reductions on both sides of that line, or some
 sort of an understanding on Mongolia.
 If the two sides were to make progress on any of these
 issues, it would be the most significant development in their
 relationship since the low point in 1969, following the sharp
 clashes along their border.   Moscow and Beijing would,- of course,
 still have major differences--especially over Afghanistan and the
 Vietnam/Cambodia question.   But even a hint that the Soviets and
 Chinese were making progress toward what Gorbachev termed "the
 creation of an atmosphere of good-neighborliness" along China's
 northern perimeter would have an impact in the West, complicating
 US and allied dealings with both the USSR and China.
 There could, at the same time, be certain negative
 consequences for the Soviets.   In particular, the Japanese would
 almost certainly regard any Soviet concessions to the Chinese on
 their border dispute as a precedent for their own territorial
 claims against the USSR.   The Japanese might well fail to
 recognize the differences between the two cases, and decide to
 press their claims to the Northern Territories with more vigor in
 the future, believing that this approach would eventually force
 the Soviets to return at least some of the islands to Japan.   By
 the same token, Hanoi and Kabul  could well become a good deal
 more worried about the possibility that Moscow might sacrifice
 their interests to its own.  and thus seek even more in the way of
 Soviet reassurances.

 Possible Chinese Responses to Gorbachev's Speech
 Summary
 We  believe  China                           will  seize  the  opportunity  presented  by
 Gorbachev's Vladivostok speech to push for further Soviet concessions, to
 increase Chinese leverage with the United States, to explore ways to
 reduce the Soviet threat to China, and to sow concern in Hanoi about the
 reliability of Soviet support.                      Domestically, Deng may see an opportunity
 to set the course for China's relations with the USSR before he hands over
 power to his successors, leaving them free to focus on the reform
 program.
 In  our  judgment,  China  has  not  changed  its  fundamental
 assessment of the Soviet threat--nor is  it even  reevaluating  it.  By
 publicly calling for Soviet concessions on Cambodia, Beijing has placed a
 constraint on how far it can go with Moscow and tried to reassure
 Washington.  In responding to Gorbachev, we believe Beijing will attempt
 to probe for and encourage additional concessions from Moscow without
 alarming the United States and China's Asian friends or allowing Moscow

 to exploit a Sino-Soviet dialogue to enhance Soviet leverage in the
 triangle. In keeping with its "independent foreign policy," moreover, China
 will continue to send mixed signals in its press commentary on both
 Soviet and US actions.
 When the ninth round of bilateral consultations begins in Beijing in
 October, we believe, in addition to pressing on Afghanistan and Cambodia,
 Beijing will push Moscow to:
 ? Withdraw the majority of Soviet troops from
 Mongolia.
 ? Pull back troops from its border with China.
 ? Reduce SS-20s deployed in the Soviet Far East.
 ? Curtail reconnaissance flights against China
 through North Korean airspace.
 ? Relinquish Chimnaya/Heixiazi Island across from
 Khabarovsk.
 to our judgment, significant Soviet concessions in at least one area
 could  induce  China  to  make  one  or  more  of  the  following
 counter-concessions:
 ? Conclude a mutual nonaggression pact with Mongolia.
 ? Revive Sino-Soviet border talks.
 ? Agree to confidence-building gestures along its northern border.
 ? Set dates for foreign ministerial talks.
 ? Expand Soviet access to senior Chinese leaders.
 ? Increase working-level exchanges and consultations
 We believe the Chinese will continue to rebuff Soviet efforts to
 reestablish party ties and will not agree to a summit between Gorbachev
 and either preeminent Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping or General Secretary
 Hu Yaobang prior to significant Soviet concessions on Cambodia and
 Afghanistan.  China will most likely normalize party relations with Eastern
 Europe--a move apparently sanctioned by Moscow as a way to facilitate
 possible normalization of Sino-Soviet party ties later--to promote Chinese
 influence in the region at Moscow's expense.   The Chinese also will
 cont~ o expand defense and economic ties with the United State

 Beijing's Soviet Policy on the Eve of Gorbachev's Speech
 In the months preceding Gorbachev's speech on 28 July, the Chinese increasingly
 exhibited signs of frustration with Moscow's refusal to follow up its smooth rhetoric
 with concessions on any of what China calls the "three obstacles" to improved relations:
 Soviet support  for  Vietnam's  occupation  of  Cambodia,  the  Soviet  presence  in
 Afghanistan, and the deployment of Soviet troops in Mongolia and along the Sino-Soviet
 border. Beijing last year tried to encourage Gorbachev to reassess Moscow's hardline
 policies toward China's security concerns by agreeing--without corresponding Soviet
 concessions--to resume long-suspended trade union and parliamentary relations and to
 exchange visits by their foreign ministers in 1986.  We believe these moves were also
 designed to increase Beijing's leverage with Washington.'
 Moscow's  continued  intransigence  at  the    last  three  biannual  Sino-Soviet
 consultations and its blatant efforts to exploit the impression of improved Sino-Soviet
 ties to enhance its position vis-a-vis Washington, however, caused Beijing to brand
 Gorbachev's foreign policy as meaningless "smile diplomacy" and to back away from the
 exchange of foreign ministers.  We believe Beijing chilled political relations for two
 reasons.  First, the Chinese wanted to remind Moscow that the Soviets must address at
 least one of the "three obstacles" if gradual normalization of relations were to continue.
 At the same time, the Chinese sought to reassure the United States, Thailand, Pakistan,
 and others that China remained committed to resisting the security threat posed by the
 Indeed, Soviet military developments prior to Gorbachev's speech did little to
 persuade Beijing that Moscow had altered its long-term strategy of encircling China.
 Although Gorbachev has not deployed any new ground forces or SS-20s in the Far East,
 he  has markedly stepped  up  reconnaissance flights targeting the Chinese  coast
 exoanded the Soviet Pacific Fleet, and upgraded Soviet airpower in the region

 Gorbachev's Proposals
 In his speech given in Vladivostok on 28 July, Gorbachev made the
 following new proposals concerning China:
 ? The Soviet Union will withdraw six regiments from Afghanistan by
 year's end.
 ? Moscow is ready to discuss "concrete steps" to reduce land forces
 along the Sino-Soviet border.
 ? Soviet and Mongolian leaders are examining the removal of a
 "substantial part" of what we believe to be approximately 60,000
 Soviet troops in Mongolia.
 ? The Soviet Union and China could cooperate in space exploration.
 Gorbachev once again:
 ? Proposed bilateral discussions "any time, and at any level"
 on improving relations.
 ? Suggested the official boundary on the Amur River might pass
 along the main shipping channel instead of the Chinese bank.
 (Although this is the first time Moscow has publicly proposed
 this boundary formula, the Soviets did so privately as early
 as 1964.)
 ? Resurrected his call last year for a Helsinki-style Asian
 security conference.
 ? Reiterated Soviet willingness to establish a rail link between
 Soviet Kazakhstan and Chinese Xinjiang.
 ? Endorsed already-begun bilateral negotiations to jointly develop
 the Amur River Basin.

 Factors Governing China's Response
 statements by senior Chinese officials indicate that Beijing
 sees   Gorbachev's   proposals     as   failing   to   address   China's   top   security
 concerns--Vietnam's efforts to expand its influence at China's expense and Soviet
 efforts to encircle China militarily.3 Chinese strategic thinkers have also stressed E
 not changed.
 that China's assessment of the Soviet threat has
 Nonetheless, we believe China has compelling reasons to begin a dialogue with
 Moscow on Gorbachev's proposal.  In our judgment, Beijing believes further marginal
 improvements in Sino-Soviet relations would:
 ? Buy time for China to modernize its forces along the border.  Beijing is in the
 process of implementing a new defense strategy that it believes requires at least
 a decade of reduced tensions to become completely credible."
 ? Stimulate competition between Moscow and Washington to woo Beijing.
 ? Increase tension in Soviet-Vietnamese relations, a major Chinese goal, by playing
 on Hanoi's fear of being sold out by Moscow.  Vietnam periodically dispatches
 delegations to Moscow to seek reassurances of Soviet support.
 ? Assist domestic political goals.
 At the same time,  Beijing  is well aware that too positive a response to
 Gorbachev's  proposals could jeopardize its access to US, Japanese, and Western
 European advanced technology, investment, trade, and defense cooperation--major
 Chinese political goals.  Nor does Beijing want to signal its friends and enemies in
 Southeast  and   South  Asia  that it might reconsider its  stand on Cambodia and
 Afghanistan. Therefore, we believe China will attempt to:

 ? Encourage Soviet -flexibility while continuing to criticize on the three obstacles
 and other security issues.
 ? Probe for major Soviet concessions on the three obstacles and China's northern
 boundary.
 ? Reassure Washington of China's pro-Western tilt without forgoing the option of
 being able to play the "Soviet card."
 ? Reduce Moscow's ability to play the "China card" against Washington.
 ? Keep Thailand and Pakistan from wavering on Cambodia and Afghanistan.
 Domestic Fallout from the Gorbachev Speech
 Deng and his reform allies can gain in two areas from some further
 relaxation in Sino-Soviet relations, in our view.  First, any reduction in tensions
 tends to benefit China's economic modernization program.  Second, progress on
 the issue should smooth the transition to power for Deng's successors.
 We believe Deng has designed many of China's foreign policy initiatives,
 most notably closer relations with the West, to support his economic reforms.
 Consequently, although he distrusts the Soviets, Deng would probably be willing
 to be more flexible if he believes he can win real Soviet concessions that can
 help his modernization goals.  Avoidance of border tensions allows a more
 measured pace of military modernization and frees transport, manpower, and
 other resources.  Deng may also hope to expand exports of goods China cannot
 trade elsew          gain further Soviet assistance in modernizing Soviet-built
 On the political front, Deng may see an opportunity to set China's Soviet
 policy before he hands power over to his successors. We believe that Deng has
 kept foreign policy issues closely under his own control, relying on his personal
 prestige and influence to manage this sensitive area.  Deng's successors will
 not have his personal clout and therefore might be more vulnerable to groups
 that either have a different foreign policy orientation or seek to exploit foreign
 affairs for domestic political ends.  The more Deng can stabilize relations with
 Moscow and win agreement on how to proceed, the more likely we believe his
 successors will          to carry on the reform program with a minimum of
 distraction.
 In our estimation, Deng's conservative opponents, who argued last year
 for a more flexible approach to the Soviets, cannot capitalize politically on
 Gorbachev's initiatives. We believe that recent political developments have
 greatly weakened the conservatives--especially those at the top--and have

 made it increasingly unlikely that the conservatives will be able to challenge
 Deng.  In any case, it is our judgment that the conservatives are suspicious of
 both the United States and the Soviet Union. Thus, while there is some support
 among the conservatives for more distant relations with Washington, we also
 see very little active pressure for closer political relations with Moscow.
 Possible Chinese Responses
 We believe the Chinese will use scheduled contacts over the next several weeks
 to seek further indications of Soviet intentions, but the ninth round of vice foreign
 ministerial consultations in Beijing in October provides the best venue to engage the
 Soviets in a meaningful dialogue on Gorbachev's proposals.   Outlined below is our
 speculation about what the Chinese may say in October and why.
 Security issues.  Remarks by Chinese strategic thinkers support our judgment
 that China will not be satisfied with Gorbachev's implicit pledge to freeze the number of
 SS-20s in the Far East or his explicit promise not to relocate in the region any SS-20s
 that might be removed from Europe.  We believe the Chinese will continue to press for
 their total withdrawal.    We also expect China to protest overflights of North Korea by
 Soviet reconnaissance planes targeting the Chinese coast, Moscow's expansion of its
 Pacific fleet, and the upgrading of Soviet airpower in the Far East.
 We nevertheless believe that the Chinese view Gorbachev's offer to withdraw
 troops from Mongolia and the Sino-Soviet border as an important unilateral gesture.  If
 the Soviets commit themselves to withdraw one or more of their five divisions in
 Mongolia--a move that would not jeopardize Soviet or Mongolian security--Beijing
 could reciprocate in a number of ways without compromising its own security. Chinese
 options include:
 ? Announcing the "deactivation" of the 69th Field Arm  o  osite Mongolia
 F___
 ? Agreeing to warn each other of military exercises or major troop movements
 near the Sino-Mongolian border.
 ? Pulling back tank regiments from selected border defense divisions along the
 Mongolian frontier.
 If the Soviets go beyond a token withdrawal and pull back most if not all of their forces
 from Mongolia, we believe the Chinese would be willing to go further, perhaps signing a
 friendship treaty with Mongolia that would renounce any claim to Mongolian territory
 and serve as a de facto mutual nonaggression pact--something the Soviets have been
 seeking

 We believe a Soviet proposal to negotiate some sort of demilitarized zone along
 the Sino-Soviet border would be far less attractive to China than deactivation of Soviet
 divisions.  Beijing has always expressed greater concern about the number of Soviet
 divisions in the Far East than about their proximity to the Chinese border.  Nonetheless,
 if the Soviets offered to pull back all regular ground units 30 kilometers from the border,
 China, in our judgment, could respond by transfering northern border security duties
 from the PLA to the People's Armed Police.

 Expanded Political Contacts
 China's cautious response to Gorbachev's initiative comes amidst a flurry
 of high-level exchanges with the Soviet Union and Mongolia that we believe is
 a combination of earlier scheduling, Chinese interest in Gorbachev's proposals,
 and Moscow's desire to portray Sino-Soviet relations as improving:
 ? Soviet First Deputy Premier Arkhipov arrived in China for
 "acupuncture treatment" on the eve of Gorbachev's speech
 and met with Vice Premiers Li Peng, Wan Li, and Yao Yilin
 before returning to Moscow on 26 August. According to a
 Western press account, Arkhipov presented the Chinese
 with an advance copy of the speech.
 ? Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing proceeded with
 a long-scheduled trip to Mongolia--the highest-level
 Chinese visit to that country in over 20 years--which
 culminated in the signing of a consular treaty on
 9 August. This treaty is consistent with similar
 agreements Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian signed in Berlin
 and Budapest in late spring, but takes on added signifi-
 cance because it follows on the heels of Gorbachev's
 Mongolian overture, which the two sides also discussed.
 ? Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong began a two-week visit to
 Moscow 17 August, the first such mayoral visit since
 the 1950s.
 ? Soviet Deputy Premier and Alternate Politburo member
 Talyzin, possibly accompanied by Deputy Foreign Minister
 Rogachev, is scheduled to visit China in early September
 as the guest of Vice Premier Li Peng.
 the Chinese in early May
 pushed for the visit of a deputy premier to reciprocate
 for Vice Premier Yao Yilin's visit in July 1985. Talyzin's
 visit is in response to this, but its timing nevertheless
 fortuitously strengthens the impression of improved ties

 following Gorbachev's speech.
 ? We expect Wu and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze to
 discuss Gorbachev's proposals in the third annual Sino-Soviet
 foreign ministerial meeting at the opening of the UNGA in
 September in New York.
 ? Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang and President Li
 Xiannian will host a visit to China by East German
 General Secretary and President Honecker in October.
 Honecker's visit to China--the first such trip in many
 years by a Soviet bloc party leader other than Romania's
 Ceaucescu--and the expected reestablishment of party ties
 most likely signal similar developments with other East
 European Communist parties. Although intended by Beijing
 to increase Chinese influence in East Europe, Honecker's
 party position and the certainty that Moscow has
 approved his trip nonetheless will give the visit a
 Sino-Soviet focus as well.
 ? Rogachev in October will lead the Soviet delegation
 to Beijing for the ninth round of Sino-Soviet vice
 ministerial consultations.
 Boundary Talks.  We think it likely that China could decide to reopen formal
 border negotiations, which broke down in 1978 after Beijing publicly insisted on Soviet
 withdrawal from disputed areas and added a new demand that Moscow reduce its forces
 along  the Sino-Soviet  border  to  the  level  of  Khrushchev's  time.5  Gorbachev's
 acceptance of the deepest channel  (thalweg) of the Amur River as the line of
 demarcation gives China most of the disputed islands in the river.   Ownership of
 Chimnaya (Heixiazi) Island opposite Khabarovsk, however, is likely to be a sticking point,
 and any negotiations on the border are likely to be protracted as both parties weigh the
 impact on disputes with other nations.
 Amur River Basin and Railway Cooperation.  China earlier this year reopened to
 Soviet shipping the port of Tongjiang on the Songhua River near the Amur, and we
 believe the two sides will sign an agreement on use of the basin based on their recent
 expert-level  negotiations.   China  has  announced  that  it  plans  to  extend  the
 Harbin-Longzhen railway 240 kilometers to Aihui on the Amur River and might cooperate
 with the  Soviets  in  building  a  rail  bridge across the Amur between Aihui    and
 Blagoveshchensk to facilitate border trade.   In the west, China plans to add some 400
 kilometers to the single-track Lanzhou-Urumqi    railway, extending  it to within 80
 5 Prior to 1964, the Soviets deployed only 11 active ground-combat divisions with
 fewer than 3,500 tanks and armored vehicles opposite China.

 kilometers of the Soviet railway terminus at Druzhba.  We would not be surprised if
 Beijing accelerated its construction schedule and agreed to connect the two railways as
 a sign of goodwill to. Moscow.
 Areas Where Beijing is Unlikely to Accommodate Moscow
 Beijing has stated it will not compromise with Moscow on Afghanistan and
 Cambodia,  and  we  believe  China  will  hold  significant  improvements  in  political
 relations--such as party ties and a Deng/Hu-Gorbachev summit--hostage to meaningful
 Soviet movement on these "obstacles."  China probably calculates that even the hint of
 China's flexibility on these issues would greatly harm its credibility with the United
 States, and such Asian friends as Pakistan and Thailand.  Moreover, we believe the
 Chinese will attempt to assuage their friends' natural suspicions of any Sino-Soviet
 border agreement, and may couple progress in one area with stepped-up criticism of
 Soviet activity elsewhere, especially Cambodia and Afghanistan.  We expect the Chinese
 to reject Gorbachev's proposed Asian security conference, as they have in the past.
 Beijing also will not, in our view, agree to forswear the option of strategic cooperation
 with Washington against Moscow.
 Finally, Beijing's pride in its own space-launch capabilities most likely will keep
 China from taking Gorbachev up on his offer to join the ranks of Mongolia, Cuba, and
 various East European satellites as a junior partner in the Soviet space program.  The
 Chinese, moreover, have alread  ex ressed interest in a US invitation to participate in a
 future space shuttle mission
 Positive Signals China Can Send in Other Areas
 Even if the Chinese rule out concessions specifically linked to Gorbachev's
 proposals on the grounds that Gorbachev merely responded to earlier Chinese gestures,
 they could nevertheless reward Gorbachev and encourage further Soviet concessions in
 other ways. Possible moves might include:
 ? Expanding Soviet access to senior Chinese leaders.
 ? Increasing consultations between working-level officials on international issues,
 including relations with the United States.
 ? Regularly exchanging views (but not intelligence) between think tank experts on
 economic development and foreign policy issues.
 ? Proceeding with the exchange of foreign ministerial visits.
 ? Exchanging visits by editors of Pravda and People's Daily.

 Without significant progress on Afghanistan or Cambodia, however, we- believe
 the Chinese remain highly unlikely to agree to a summit between Gorbachev and Deng

 We expect the Chinese to try to use Gorbachev's initiative to encourage US
 concessions on Taiwan, trade, and technology transfer, although Chinese officials in
 private probably will take pains to reassure the United States and others of China's
 continued goodwill.  Beijing, in our judgment, will use Defense Secretary Weinberger's
 coming visit and the first port call to China by US Navy warships this fall both to press
 the Soviets in October for concessions on Gorbachev's proposals and other security
 concerns, such as Soviet reconnaissance overflights of North Korea against China, and
 to balance any improvements in ties with Moscow.  China will also closely monitor
 developments  in      US-USSR  relations  as  a  possible  Reagan-Gorbachev  summit
