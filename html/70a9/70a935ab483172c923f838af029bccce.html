 VIETNAM
 The major military activity in South Vietnam continues
 to be US Marine Operation PRAIRIE's efforts to uproot
 elements of the North Vietnamese 324B Division entrenched
 south of the Demilitarized Zone  (DMZ).    A  new surface-
 to-air missile site has been discovered only 55 miles
 north of the zone, possibly intended to counter the
 heavy US tactical air activity of recent weeks.   Also,
 North Vietnamese interceptor aircraft are displaying

 Defense Minister Lin Piao has emerged as Mao Tse-tung's

 conceivable, Lin may already be the paramount ruler.
 Less is known about Lin Piao than any other Chinese leader.
 His background suggests that he is as chauvinistic as other
 leaders, but may take a relatively pragmatic approach to
 policy issues.   (Published separately as Special Report

 Far East
 VIETNAM
 The fighting in northernmost
 Quang Tri Province near the De-
 militarized Zone  (DMZ)  last week
 continued to be the major mili-
 tary activity in South Vietnam.
 US aircraft and artillery have
 provided support to the five bat-
 talions.of US Marines in their
 efforts to uproot elements of the
 North Vietnamese Army's 324B
 Division entrenched just south
 of the DMZ.   Cumulative casualty
 figures for this operation--Op-
 eration PRAIRIE--which began on
 3 August, now show 100 Americans
 killed and 323 wounded.   Enemy
 losses include over 600 killed
 and five captured.
 Viet Cong Activity
 Viet Cong guerrillas
 launched a daring but ineffec-
 tive attack. on the US Marine
 airfield at Chu Lao on 21 Septem-
 ber.                   An estimated 20 rounds of
 82-mm. mortar shells fell on the
 airstrip.   A total of 16 Ameri-
 cans were wounded, one seriously.
 Eight aircraft sustained minor
 damage but remained operational.
 company-size Viet Cong unit
 has been established with the
 primary mission of attacking
 allied shipping between Saigon
 and the sea.   This unit has ap-
 proximately 55 men,  equipped with
 antitank rifles, B-40 rocket
 launchers, and 57-mm. recoilless
 rifles.
 VC Military Conference
 The Communist "Liberation
 Radio" revealed on 16 September
 that the Viet Cong called a high-
 level military conference in early
 August,  the first since October
 1962,   to brief field commanders
 from all over South Vietnam on
 Communist plans and strategy.   The
 conference included an exchange of
 views by military delegates and
 addresses by the deputy VC politi-
 cal commander and a deputy military

 commander, neither of whom
 was identified by name.   The news
 release admitted, however, that
 some delegates demonstrated "con-
 fusion" about directives from
 above and expressed differences
 of opinion about the problems and
 solutions discussed.
 The broadcast implied that
 the conference was necessitated
 by relatively widespread confusion
 about high-level Communist inten-
 tions and a need to bring field
 commanders up to date on US mili-
 tary tactics.   The calling of this
 conference and its forecast of a
 "more difficult and more desperate
 struggle" in the coming year sug-
 gest that the leadership remains
 unshaken in its determination to
 continue the fighting.
 Problems in Newly Elected
 South Vietnam Assembly
 South Vietnam's newly elected
 constituent assembly will face
 several significant political prob-
 lems when it convenes on 27 Septem-
 ber, before it even begins its task
 of drafting a constitution.
 One of the most important
 problems is the need to develop
 some rapport between the assembly
 and the military government.   Fric-
 tion between the two could become
 a major problem in the delicate
 process of balancing civilian and
 military interests in the consti-
 tutional structure.
 The delegates may decide to
 give early consideration to the
 issue of the assembly's authority
 --the question of assuming a legis-
 lative function in addition to
 drafting a constitution and the
 question of ',a government veto on
 the assembly's work in the absence
 of a two-thirds majority in the
 assembly.
 Thus far, the leaders of the
 military government have generally
 been careful not to alienate the
 newly elected, delegates.   In a
 press conference on 17 September,
 Premier Ky declared that the gov-
 ernment was reconsidering the
 question of' the assembly's assuming
 a legislative function, but was
 quite firm on the necessity of
 the government's retaining its
 veto power.   The attitudes of most
 of the delegates toward the mili-
 tary are unknown.

 tion will be the ability of the
 assembly itself to harmonize the
 diverse regional, religious, and

 political interests its delegates
 represent.   Problems of this na-
 ture may be reflected quickly dur-
 ing the election of assembly of-
 ficers.   The political influence
 of southerners, which has in-
 creased noticeably in Premier
 Ky's cabinet this year,  is also
 strong in the assembly,  and one
 of the leading southern politi-
 cians will undoubtedly be nomi-
 nated as assembly president.
 Growing concern about southern
 influence among Vietnamese of
 central and northern origin will
 have to be assuaged--possibly by
 a compromise on the selection of
 other assembly officers--if the
 assembly is to function smoothly.
 Rumors of Government Changes
 There are some indications
 that the dismissal of Deputy Pre-
 mier Co and possibly IV Corps
 commander General Quang is again
 being considered by Premier Ky
 and his supporters.   Speculation
 concerning the dismissal of these
 two officers, basically for wide-
 spread charges of corruption, was
 rife in late July and early Au-
 gust.
 Cambodia - Viet Cong Border Talks
 Negotiations between Cambodia
 and the Viet Cong have been sus-
 specified "complications."~
 Although Sihanouk announced ear-
 lier this month that a border
 agreement with the Vietnamese
 Communists would be signed before
 the end of the year,  the month-
 old talks have been plagued by
 procedural and substantive prob-
 lems.   The fundamental diffi-
 culty has been Sihanouk's fear
 of the possible consequences of
 concluding such an agreement,  and
 his desire to extract as much as
 possible from the Communists to
 make the risk worthwhile.            25X1
 the North Vietnamese
 insisted that the border agree-
 ment include a rider specifying
 that the demarcation of the fron-
 tier would be subject to further
 negotiation--a requirement which
 Sihanouk would almost certainly
 find unpalatable.

 weeks.   If Hanoi should move the
 SAMs even farther south,  they
 could pose a threat to US B-52

 the DMZ.   The effective range
 of the SA-2 missile is about 20
 miles.
 DRV Air Force More Aggressive
 During the past week,  US
 strike aircraft over North Viet-
 nam fought a record number of
 air battles with North Vietnamese
 fighters, most of which involved
 the exchange of missile or can-
 non fire.   Only one US fighter
 was lost while three North Viet-
 namese aircraft were shot down
 and three others damaged.
 Engagements fought on 21 Sep-

 counters on that dale US fliers
 observed red or orange missiles
 --believed to be the Soviet-sup-
 plied version of the US Sidewinder
 --under the wings of the MIG-21s.
 The number of encounters and

 of sustained activity on the part
 of the DRV Air Force  is under
 way.

 CAMBODIAN-THAI RELATIONS IMPROVING
 Prospects are improving for
 an easing of tensions between Bang-
 kok and Phnom Penh, although an
 early resumption of diplomatic rela-
 tions is unlikely.
 Thai leaders have reacted cau-
 tiously but favorably to Sihanouk's
 recent statements that Cambodia will
 not pose any prior conditions to a
 resumption of diplomatic relations.
 Thai Deputy Prime Minister Praphat,
 who had rebuffed a Cambodian over-
 ture in July,  told the press last
 week that Thailand had no objection
 to resuming relations, which were
 terminated by Cambodia in 1961.   He
 said that the cabinet is currently
 exploring the possibilities.
 Praphat is also the key figure
 behind Thai support for the Khmer
 Serei dissidents, whose stepped-up
 activities against Cambodia in the
 past two years have led to a score
 of border incidents and to Cambo-
 dian counterterrorism.   The Thai
 leaders have thus far shown little
 disposition to discontinue joint
 support with South Vietnam for the
 Thai-based dissidents. Although Si-
 hanouk has stated that Bangkok's
 support for the Khmer Serei will not
 stand in the way of a resumption of
 relations, he has also made it clear
 that a continuation of their activ-
 ities will impede a meaningful rec-
 onciliation between the two countries.
 A resumption of diplomatic re-
 lations will also be hindered by the
 penchant of both countries to con-
 duct their diplomacy on the basis of
 often misleading press reports.
 Sihanouk is particularly guilty on
 this score. He has,  for example,
 hastily rejected a reported Thai sug-
 gestion that the Preah Vihear Bud-
 dhist temple be "internationalized."
 Bangkok, however,  fully realizes
 that Phnom Penh will not relinquish
 any measure of Cambodian sovereignty

 in a 1962 decision of the Interna-

 nouk's offer of permission for Thai

 Long-standing personal antago-

 vectives will pose a further barrier
 to improved relations.  However,  there
 are no major substantive issues di-
 viding the two countries and both
 have much to gain by reducing ten-
 sions and fighting along their bor-
 der.

 THE NEW CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY HIERARCHY
 The published lists of lead-
 ers who attended three major Pe-
 king rallies in August and Sep-
 tember, plus piecemeal disclosures
 in recent weeks, help clarify the
 nature of the sweeping changes
 which evidently took place at a
 party plenum held in early August.
 From this evidence it is now pos-
 sible to reconstruct with some
 confidence the current composi-
 tion of the politburo and its
 standing committee--the party's
 top policy-making bodies--and of
 the secretariat, which is the
 executive arm of the party.  (See
 table on opposite page.)
 The most striking change in
 the new leadership lineup is the
 rise of military men close to
 Lin Piao, Mao's new deputy.   The
 principal losers have been party
 organization men like Liu Shao-
 chi.   Three senior military men
 apparently have been added to the
 politburo, doubling the military
 representation on that 21-man
 body. This brings into the po-
 litburo all six senior members
 of Lin Piao's Military Affairs
 Committee, the supreme military
 authority of the party.
 Liu Shao-chi, Mao's party
 deputy since 1945, was publicly
 humiliated at the rallies, where
 he was relegated to eighth place.
 He apparently has dropped out of
 the standing committee.   Party
 general secretary Tenh Hsiao-ping's
 position has also been weakened,
 though not as much.   He presum-
 ably remains on the seven-man
 standing committee.   He dropped
 from third or fourth in the power
 structure to sixth place, however,
 and has made no public appear-
 ances, except at the large Peking
 rallies, in the past month.  Since
 the August plenurp he has appeared
 in his role as general secretary
 only once--on 17 August.
 The new politburo is a mixed
 bag.   New members of the standing
 committee include two radical
 party leaders who had not been
 closely associated with the regu-
 lar party apparatus--regional
 leader Tao Chu and Chen Po-ta,  a
 Marxist theoretician.   The rela-
 tively moderate government lead-
 ers and economic specialists like
 Chou En-lai and Li Fu-shun have
 retained or improved their stand-
 ing.   A place has'even been found
 in the new politburo for Chen
 Yun, a once-prominent economic
 figure who fell into limbo after
 contemptuously criticizing the
 "leap forward" in 1959.
 Peking's failure to make a
 formal announcement. of personnel
 changes decided on at a party
 plenum is unusual, and could be
 a sign they are not considered
 permanent.   Pronouncements ema-
 nating from Peking continue to
 insist that bringing down addi-
 tional powerful figures in the
 party is the main task of the
 regime.   This has been the cen-
 tral theme of each of Lin Piao's
 three speeches since he rose to
 his present position of eminence.
 At the moment, Lin' s immediate
 targets seem to be provincial-
 level figures, but the vague and
 sweeping nature of his charges
 makes it possible for him to re-
 sume pressure on leaders at the
 center at any time.

 WEAKENING TREND I N MALAYSIAN FEDERATION
 The current political
 crisis in the Borneo state of
 Sarawak, highlighted by the
 Malaysia Government's declaration
 of a state of emergency there on
 15 September, underscores the
 tenuous relationship of the
 component parts of the three-
 year-old Malaysian federation.
 Although Kuala Lumpur is ex-
 pected to assert its authority
 over the short term,  the long-
 run prospects are for increased
 instability and unrest.
 The crisis stems from the
 competing claims for the Sarawak
 chief ministership.   The incum-
 bent, Stephen Ningkan,  and his
 faction favor more autonomy for
 Sarawak, while Tawi Sli and his
 followers are willing to accept
 Kuala Lumpur's dominance.   Kuala
 Lumpur engineered Ningkan's re-
 placement by Tawi Sli in June,
 only to have Sarawak's high
 court reinstate Ningkan on 7
 September.   Although lacking
 majority backing in the present
 Sarawak assembly, Ningkan enjoys
 substantial popular and politi-
 cal support,  including,  at least
 in his current struggle with
 Kuala Lumpur, that of the large
 Chinese-dominated and Communist-
 penetrated Sarawak United
 Peoples Party.
 On 19 September the federal
 Parliament amended the Sarawak
 constitution to allow the
 governor to convene the assembly
 for the purpose of removing
 Ningkan as chief minister.   To
 soothe popular sentiment the
 government has promised that
 elections will be held but did
 not set a specific'date.   Pro-
 Ningkan forces have seized on
 this promise to demand general
 elections immediately.
 Kuala Lumpur's arbitrary
 state-of-emergency' declaration
 and its amending of the consti-
 tution have aroused unprecedented
 resentment in Sarawak, have fur-
 ther increased Ningkan's popu-
 larity,  and have strengthened the
 position of those favoring auton-
 omy. Although violent demonstra-
 tions against Kuala Lumpur seem
 unlikely for the immediate future,
 continued failure to meet demands
 in Sarawak for elections and
 greater autonomy would increase
 discontent and the possibility of
 violence.
 In the long run this sit-
 uation could become susceptible
 to exploitation by Indonesia.
 Despite the official ending of
 its confrontation policy against
 Malaysia,  Indonesia appears not
 to have abandoned Its ambition
 to separate the Borneo states
 from the federations.   Another
 factor which may be expected
 to worsen the situation is the
 current replacement of British
 military personnel. in Sarawak
 by unpopular Malay troops from
 mainland Malaysia, at move sched-
 uled to be completed this year.

 Laotian Prime Minister Sou-

 confrontation with the National
 Assembly which was precipitated
 by that body's rejection of the
 proposed budget on 16 September.
 Souvanna,  impatient with the
 legislators'  eagerness for a
 greater political role,  scornful
 of their "ineptness," and pres-
 ently disinclined to compromise,
 wants to dissolve the assembly
 and to call for new elections.
 He was assured on 16 September
 of the army's support in any "po-
 litical showdown" with the depu-
 ties and the next day he got cab-
 inet  approval  for an approach to
 King Savang.   On 20 September the
 premier informed his cabinet that
 the King had agreed to dissolve
 the assembly and retain the pres-
 ent government.
 Page  9
 Souvanna
 has even in-
 dicated he would like some govern-
 mental control over the selection
 of new deputies.   One of his pro-
 posals involves government nomina-
 tions to the assembly which would
 be approved by provincial "consul-
 tative commissions" composed of
 senior military officers and civil
 servants.
 The King,  on the other hand,
 prefers general elections,  and       25X1
 Souvanna is unlikely to press for
 such an arrangement in the face of
 the King's opposition.

 TROUBLES MOUNT FOR WEST GERMANY'S CHANCELLOR
 Ludwig Erhard's political
 position has deteriorated further
 on the eve of his visit to Wash-
 ington.                        The latest blow was the
 sudden resignation of Ludger
 Westrick, his long-time aide and
 confidant.
 Without Westrick's counsel
 and expertise,  the West German
 chancellor will be more exposed
 to the attacks of his foes.
 Westrick will stay on until Er-
 hard returns from the US but his
 resignation has given impetus to
 speculation that a major cabinet
 shake-up will take place before
 the end of the year.   Defense
 Minister von Hassel--still suf-
 fering the aftereffects of his
 recent confrontation with top
 generals--remains a prime pros-
 pect for transfer or removal.
 Erhard still maintains that
 he has no thought at present
 either of quitting or of remak-
 ing his ministerial team./
 The chancellor has staked
 his reputation and probably his
 political future on the passage
 of economic stabilization legis-
 lation,  a serieslof measures de-
 signed to give Bonn a greater
 degree of control over the flag-
 ging economy.
 Erhard hopes to make politi-
 cal capital out of his 26-27 Sep-
 tember talks with US officials.
 At the same time, he is likely to
 avoid exposing himself to charges
 of being too pro-American.
 Erhard has spoken publicly
 of his intention 'to stand firm
 on the main issues--troop offset
 payments and nuclear sharing.
 Press commentators, probably with
 official inspiration, have specu-
 lated that Bonn in the future
 may wish to reduce its payments
 for the support cf US military
 forces in Germany' :b   as much as

 COSMOS 122, SOVIET EXPERIMENTAL METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE
 The Soviets have demonstrated
 a workable meteorological satel-
 lite with Cosmos 122,  launched on
 25 June.   They have transmitted
 to the United States for the first
 time cloud pictures taken by tele-
 vision and infrared cameras and
 cloud analysis charts based on
 the pictures.   This information
 partially fulfills the Soviet
 commitment under the 1962 US-USSR
 agreement to exchange satellite
 weather data.   US weather satel-
 lite data is already available to
 the Soviets.
 The Soviets began to trans-
 mit cloud analysis charts to the
 US on 19 August,  two days after
 they announced that Cosmos 122
 was a meteorological satellite.
 They claimed that transmission
 of the charts fulfilled the terms
 of the 1962 agreement.   The agree-
 ment, however,  states that se-
 lected photographs as well as
 analyses are to be exchanged. On
 11 September the Soviets began
 to transmit actual photographs.
 Neither the charts nor the
 photographs are being transmitted
 to the US within the stipulated
 time of six hours after observa-
 tion.             The delay has varied be-
 tween 12 and 24 hours, thus re-
 ducing their usefulness for short-
 term forecasting.   The material
 is useful, however,  for identify-
 ing newly formed storms in remote
 areas of the world.
 The one-half-mile resolution
 of the Cosmos 122 TV photographs
 is comparable to that of the US
 Nimbus weather satellite and ade-
 quate to meet the terms of the
 1962 agreement.   Cosmos 122,  like
 Nimbus,  is constantly oriented
 toward the earth and is capable
 of taking pictures of about 75
 percent of the earth.
 The chief of the Soviet Hydro-
 meteorological Service, Fedorov,
 wrote in an Izvestia article on
 20 August that Cosmos 122 was an
 experimental meteorological satel-
 lite.                                                                 This is the first satellite
 that has been so identified.   It
 is, however,  the fifth Soviet me-
 teorological satellite in a series
 that began in August 1964.   None
 of the first four was very suc-
 cessful, although Cosmos 118 trans-
 mitted video signals for about
 two weeks.
 The Soviets plan to estab-
 lish an operational system of two
 or three weather satellites.  Such
 a system is not expected to be
 operational for at least a year.

 THE EEC AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM
 In preparation for next
 week's annual meeting of the In-
 ternational Monetary Fund in Wash-
 ington, the EEC finance ministers
 met on 12 September with interna-
 tional monetary reform the princi-
 pal topic on the agenda.   Their
 communique stresses points on
 which they agree,  implying that
 France may have succeeded some-
 what in overcoming its isolation
 from the other EEC countries evi
 dent at the July session of the
 major financial powers known as
 the Group of Ten,* and in the
 Group's August report on possible
 changes in the international mone-
 tary system.
 However, on the essential
 difference between France and
 others of the Ten--whether or
 not work is to go forward on plan-
 ning for the creation of new in-
 ternational monetary reserves--
 the  communique suggests a stand-
 off among the Six.   Although
 stating that the EEC countries
 "are ready to collaborate actively
 in the search for an adoption of
 improvements"  in the interna-
 tional monetary system, the com-
 m.uniquef  notes "differences of
 opinion as to the desirability of
 setting up at once machinery for
 the possible establishment of ad-
 ditional liquidity."   Following
 the finance ministers' meeting,
 Luxembourg's Prime Minister Wer-
 ner, who chaired the session,
 said that France would partici-
 pate in further studies of the
 problem while maintaining its
 reservations regarding the need
 for the whole exercise.
 The next stage of monetary
 discussions will take place among
 an as yet undecided but larger
 grouping than just the Ten.   The
 precise link of ;t.he Ten to the
 other IMF members in the so-
 called "second 4t.age" of contin-
 gency planning, however, will
 likely be the main area of con-
 troversy at next week's meetings.
 Short of reiter6.ting the point
 already made by!the Ten that the
 principal industrialized coun-
 tries have a "particular responsi-
 bility"  in the working out of
 new machinery and in taking de-
 cisions within  .t, the communi-
 que of the Six gives no indica-
 tion of how far', the EEC members
 of the Ten are prepared to go
 in sharing this responsibility
 within the IMF.
 In any casie, Paris has ap-
 parently decided that at this
 stage at least isolation is not
 a paying proposlition, and its
 evident concern about EEC soli-
 darity may also give other Com-
 munity members some bargaining
 power in the future.   Although
 they do not share De Gaulle's
 peculiar ideas on the interna-
 tional monetary system, they
 nonetheless can be expected to
 continue to emphasize caution
 on innovation and haste on
 elimination ofUS and UK pay-
 ments deficits

 SWEDEN'S GOVERNING PARTY SUFFERS SETBACK IN LOCAL ELECTIONS
 The executive and parlia-
 mentary groups of Sweden's Social
 Democratic Party  (SDP)  are to
 meet on 1 October to assess the
 party's position in the wake of
 the sharp setback it suffered in
 local elections on 18 September.
 Prime Minister Erlander,  shaken
 by what he termed the party's
 "smarting defeat," has raised
 the possibility of calling na-
 tional elections before their
 regularly scheduled date in 1968.
 While some younger party members
 advocate this move, majority,
 sentiment appears to favor con-
 tinuation of the Social Demo-
 cratic government for the time
 being despite the rebuff it suf-
 fered at the polls and its minor-
 ity status in the lower chamber
 which forces Erlander to seek
 parliamentary support from both
 left and right.
 In the nationwide polling,
 the Social Democrats'  share of
 the vote declined from the 51
 percent they got in 1962 to 42.8
 percent.   The Swedish Communist
 Party  (SCP), which has been dis-
 playing more independence from
 Moscow, picked up 2.4 percent of
 the vote,  raising its total to
 6.6 percent.   The  SDP also lost
 to the three major non-Socialist
 parties--the Liberals,  Conserva-
 tives,  and the Center--which in-
 creased their percentage by 3.8
 percent to 48.8 percent of the
 total vote.   Both the Communists
 and the opposition "bourgeois"
 parties profited from such is-
 sues as inflation and the housing
 shortage;  foreign policy ques-
 tions played an insignificant
 role.
 The election outcome has
 revived speculation about pros-
 pects for cooperation between
 the SDP and the Communists, who
 have managed to project an image
 of a progressive, national-ori-
 ented party under their new
 leader,  Carl-Henrik Hermansson.
 The generally moderate SDP lead-
 ership has rejected Hermansson's
 proposals for collaboration, but
 Erlander and other party leaders
 are likely to face increasing
 pressure from their left wing
 for such cooperation.
 The Socialists'  setback
 could hasten the retirement of
 the 65-year-old Erlander, who has
 become increasingly discouraged
 in recent months by the disarray
 and growing factionalism within
 his party.

 GOVERNOR OF WEST PAKISTAN RE:S IIGNS
 The resignation on 18 Septem-
 ber of the governor of West Pak-
 istan--the third major Pakistani
 figure to leave office in the past
 three months--has produced a
 further concentration of power in
 the hands of President Ayub.
 Although the tough-minded
 Malik Amir Mohammad Khan of Kala-
 bagh had repeatedly expressed
 personal reasons for desiring to
 retire since he was appointed
 governor six years ago, his de-
 parture probably resulted pri-
 marily from increased strains in
 his relations with Ayub.
 Ayub
 forced the removal of two of Kala-
 bagh's appointees from the West
 Pakistan cabinet.   Shortly there-
 after, Kalabagh suprised politi-
 cal observers in Pakistan by meet-
 ing with his long-time antagonist
 Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who had re-
 cently been removed by Ayub as
 foreign minister and who was
 rapidly becoming a figure around
 whom anti-Ayub sentiment was
 coalescing.                            25X1
 Kalabagh's successor is Gen-
 eral Mohammad Musa, former com-
 mander in chief of the Pakistan
 Army and a devoted follower of
 Ayub.   Selection of a professional
 army officer to become governor
 of West Pakistan, following the
 naming of two technicians to suc-
 ceed the resigned foreign and fi-
 nance ministers, will increase
 Ayub's domination over government
 policies.   It will also make it   25X1
 more difficult for him to trans-
 fer blame tolothers when mistakes
 occur.
 CAIRO IMPOSES NEW CABINET I N YEMEN
 Nasir's frustration in the
 face of escalating anti-Egyptian
 sentiment among Yemeni republican
 forces became evident in the re-
 placement of the Yemeni cabinet
 announced this week.
 As he has done ever since
 the Yemeni revolution broke out
 nearly four years ago, Nasir acted
 through President Sallal, vir-
 tually the on!y major Yemeni
 figure on whom he can count.

 Last month Sallal returned to
 Yemen from nearly a year's so-
 journ in Cairo.   His low standing
 among leaders of the republican
 regime was revealed when Egyptian
 troops had to be used to counter
 the efforts of republican leaders
 to take over the Sana Airfield
 to prevent his plane's landing.
 Sallal's return provoked a
 showdown.  The cabinet headed by
 Premier al-Amri flew to Cairo to
 demand that Nasir drop Sallal,
 whose blatant pro-Egyptian ap-
 proach serves as a red flag to
 those republicans who want to as-
 sert their independence.   Nasir
 could not be budged, however.  In
 quick succession Sallal announced
 the resignation of al-Amri and
 his cabinet and the formation of
 a new strongly pro-Egyptian cabi-
 net headed by himself.
 The position of the republi-
 can tribes--the locus of power
 in Yemeni politics--is unclear.
 Despite the growing disaffection
 of the tribal leaders with the
 Egyptian occupation,  five impor-
 tant ones have accepted appoint-
 ment to ministerial rank as Sal-
 lal's counselors.   Their hostility
 to the Egyptians apparently has
 not blinded them to their ulti-
 mate political goal--to regain
 power they had lost to the re-
 cent Yemeni imams before the rev-
 olution.
 term Egyptian position.
 In any event , Nasir's move
 dispels any illusion that the
 Sallal government rests on a popu-
 lar base.   Nasir evidently hopes
 to keep the lid on until the re-

 be done "democratically."   On 21
 September, Paris announced that
 there would be a referendum on the
 issue of independence "before
 July." In 1958 the territory voted
 to remain with France.
 The prospect of change in the
 status of French Somaliland has
 whetted the appetites of Ethiopia
 and Somalia.   The Djibouti - Addis
 Ababa railroad is vital to Ethiopia,
 and the Afar peoples which comprise
 41 percent of the French terri-
 tory's population are related to
 Ethiopian tribes.   The Somalis
 comprise 45 percent of the
 population, however,  and the
 Mogadiscio government wants
 to unite all ethnic Somalis
 with the republic.
 The day after the Paris
 announcement Emperor Haile
 Selassie announced in fiat
 terms that French Somaliland
 was an integral part of Ethi-
 opia and that,Ethiopia would
 never accept a solution coun-
 ter to its interests.
 Mogadiscio sharply denies
 Ethiopia's claims and has pub-
 licly warned that any Ethiopian
 military venture into the territory
 would lead to war.   The Somali Re-
 public is pressing hard for a de-
 bate on the territory in the UN
 General Assembly and at the Organi--

 scheduled for November.   Mogadis-

 Sud-Katanga's Governor Munongo,

 Munongo as Tshombe's right-hand

 MILITARY COMMANDER INTERVENES IN NIGERIA'S CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS
 Late last week Supreme Com-
 mander Gowon abruptly abandoned
 his neutral role in Nigeria's
 constitutional crisis and moved
 to impose a new structure with a
 strong federal government and ad-
 ditional small states.   He still
 faces a threat of secession by
 the Eastern region.
 On 16 September the regional
 delegations meeting in Lagos ap-
 peared to be nearing agreement on
 a loose union and adjourned their
 discussions.   Next day,  however,
 the army
 had "changed its mind" and would
 not accept such an outcome.    In-
 stead, he presented a plan--vir-
 tually as an ultimatum--calling
 for the division of the North
 into six states and the East into
 three.   The West and Mid-West re-
 gions would remain intact.
 Under Gowon's plan the cen-
 tral government would have strong
 powers, while the states would
 have :Less autonomy than the re-
 gions do under the present fed-
 eral constitution.   This national
 government would be directed by
 a president,  a prime minister,
 and a parliament in which each
 state would have equal representa-
 tion.   An interim army-civilian
 government would be set up until
 constitutional and administrative
 arrangements are completed.
 By intervening' in the work of
 the conference, Gowbn responded
 above all to pressure from mili-
 tant Northern officers opposed to
 the diminution of army influence
 through the formation of four re-
 gional forces.   Gow n was also un-
 der pressure of soy!. iers from the
 southern part of the Northern Re-
 gion who dominate the remaining
 effective units,  anc  who want to
 carve a "Middle Belt" state out
 of the Northern region.   He prob-
 ably was also influenced by ci-
 vilian representatives of Northern
 and Eastern minority groups who
 have been pushing for more autonomy.
 When the constitutional con-
 ference reconvened in Lagos on 20
 September,  the Northern and Western
 delegations reportedly shifted
 their stands to support Gowon's
 point of view.   As the delegates
 from the Mid-West and Lagos had al-
 ready opted for such a plan, the
 leaders of the Eastern Region's
 dominant Ibo tribe have been left
 isolated in their advocacy of weak
 federal power and the preservation
 intact of the existing four regions.
 The Easterners,  apparently caught
 by surprise, are sti.U'_ consider-
 ing their response.  ']f Ibo mili-
 tants prevail, Easte*n military

 Gowon indicated last weekend that
 he was prepared to use force to
 oppose any attempted secession
 or any effort by the Ibos to pre-
 empt the rich oil-producing Niger
 delta areas inhabited by the mi-
 nority tribes.   There is some
 danger that the militant Northern
 officers might themselves make a
 pre-emptive move against Ojukwu.
 Minority elements in the East,
 on the other hand, will be pleased
 by the new power afforded them
 through the creation of new states.
 The plan will also be well received
 by the Yorubas of Western Nigeria,
 whose leader, Chief Awolowq believes
 he might gain top power in a new
 civilian regime under such a struc-
 ture.

 INTER-AMERICAN PEACE FORCE LEAVES DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The last units of the
 Inter-American Peace Force
 (IAPF)  left the Dominican Re-
 public on 20 and 21 September.
 President Balaguer has publicly
 voiced doubt that the events of
 1965 that led to the IAPF pres-
 ence could be repeated but added
 that if they were, the nation
 would request aid from the OAS,
 UN, or another international
 body.
 As the departure date for
 the IAPF approached,  increasing
 apprehension was voiced by some
 Dominicans that a renewed wave
 of: terrorism was at hand.   In
 part, this unease was stimulated
 by the killing of two US service-
 men on 14 September by extreme
 leftists.  Balaguer has publicly
 called for more aggressive ac-
 tion by military and police to
 curb agitation and violence.
 Colonel Alvarez, is impetuous,
 violently art.i-Communist, and has
 shown a marked tendency to take
 extreme actions.   He has, how-
 ever,  declared his fidelity to
 Balaguer.   Ba.laguer made the
 change before the IAPF's de-
 parture so as to forestall re-
 action by right-wing elements.
 Top military leaders have
 indicated agreement "in prin-
 ciple" with''a US-backed program
 endorsed by';Balaguer which is
 designed to ''improve effective-
 ness and reduce costs of the
 military forces.   Balaguer has
 moved ahead with part of his
 reorganization plan aimed at
 reducing the power of potential
 dissidents and apparently has
 shifted the 'armored unit for-
 merly commanded by General
 Wessin into another unit.
 Balaguer has continued
 efforts to consolidate his con-
 trol over the armed forces,
 whose allegiance is critical to
 the stability of his regime.   On
 17 September, he removed a po-
 tential governmental opponent,
 General Folch,  as chief of staff
 of the air force.  Although the
 precise reason for Folch's dis-
 missal is not known, he is sus-
 pected of not giving whole-
 hearted support to the Presi-
 dent.   The new air force chief,
 So far there has been no
 strong military reaction to
 these changes.   The US defense
 attaches consider that their
 over-all effect is to strengthen
 Balaguer's control of the armed
 forces and reduce possible or-
 ganized resistance to his plans
 for restructuring the military.
 The secretary general of Bosch's
 party has voiced admiration        25X1
 for Balaguer''s agility in assert-
 ing civilian control over the
 military.

 STUDENT UNREST GROWS I N BRAZIL
 Growing unrest among Brazil's
 university students is causing
 vague but perceptible uneasiness
 within the Castello Branco admin-
 istration and threatens to become
 a major embarrassment to the
 government.   Small demonstrations
 and strikes involving several
 hundred students began early this
 month over minor issues.   Inept
 handling by university authori-
 ties and the use of police to
 combat the demonstrations have
 angered and drawn in a far greater
 number of students.
 Students have gone on strike
 in Rio de Janeiro,  Sao Paulo,
 Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, Recife,
 Porto Alegre, and Goiania.   Police
 used tear gas to break up a demon-
 stration in Rio on 15 September.
 Students in Belo Horizonte at-
 tempted a solidarity march, then
 took refuge in the law school
 when thwarted.   They repulsed
 attempts to clear the school for
 18 hours by pelting police with
 stones,  chairs,  and books.
 On 20 September students in
 Sao Paulo defied a government ban
 by launching a protest march
 which attracted some popular sup-
 port and took                       olice several hours
 to disperse.
 More
 than 300 students were arrested.
 Police also broke up a demon-
 stration in Goiania on 21 September.
 Although expected major demonstra-
 tions failed to materialize in
 Brasilia on the 21st, the USIS
 information center was damaged by
 students.
 Student dissatisfaction with
 the government has been growing
 since the ousting of leftist Presi-
 dent Goulart in 1964 and subse-
 quent government efforts to elimi-
 nate political activity from the
 student movement.   The government
 has generally turned a deaf ear
 to student problems, and security
 forces have tended to treat stu-
 dent political activity as in-
 surrectionary.
 Leftist forces have regained
 influence in some sectors of the
 student movement and are looking
 for opportunities to foster un-
 rest--particularly at this time
 when national tensions are high
 because of the scheduled 3 October
 presidential election and 15
 November direct congressional
 election.   The extreme left-wing
 student group--Popular Action--

 Party, and leading political
 opponents of the government can

 COMMUNISTS BRING OFF GENERAL STRIKE IN URUGUAY
 The Communist-inspired gen-
 eral strike in Uruguay on 15 Sep-
 tember closed most business and
 government offices for 24 hours.
 It was the first major strike the
 Communists have been able to en-
 gineer on primarily political is-
 sues.
 The Communists will view the
 strike as supporting their belief
 that legitimate economic griev-
 ances          can be channeled into sup-
 port for party political objec-
 tives.   Although the aims of the
 strike included better wages and
 benefits,  its main objective was
 political:   to demonstrate labor's
 repudiation of the constitutional
 reform proposal put forward jointly
 by large factions of the two tra-
 ditional parties.   Adoption of
 this plan would put an end to
 Uruguay's present collegial execu-
 tive whose ineffective government
 has favored Communist advances.
 Page  22
 This joint proposal, which
 would substitute a strong,  single
 executive for the divided nine-man
 National Council of,Government,  is
 the only plan for governmental re-
 form with a chance to win approval
 in the 27 November 9e:neral elec-
 tions.   There will be four pro-
 posals on the ballot, and vote
 splitting may keep any of them
 from being adopted.,  If reform
 fails, chances for  . coup, prob-
 ably by frustrated groups within
 the ruling Blanco Party with some
 military backing,  increase sharply.
 Despite Council President
 Heber's earlier statements that he
 would not tolerate labor unrest,
 the government took no measures to
 prevent the strike.   Communist la-
 bor leaders will almost certainly
 be encouraged by their success and
 by apparent government inertia.
 Increasing labor agitation, perhaps
 including another general strike,
