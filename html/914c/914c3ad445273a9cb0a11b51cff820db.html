 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific.
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN BURMA:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 1.  OBJECTIVES
 The Communists in Burma are at present pursuing a two-pronged,
 \and not completely consistent, policy.  The illegal Communist under-
 ground) is continuing the insurrection which began in 1948, and seems
 at present to be concentrating on maintaining and consolidating its
 control over "base areas,' while training and strengthening guerrilla
 units for future action.  Efforts are also being made to develop
 effective alliances with other insurgent groups such as the White Band
 element of the People's Volunteer Organization and tha Karen National
 Defense Organization.
 At the same time, the above-ground, Communist-dominated Burma
 Workers and Peasants Party (B`JYPP), which is recognized by the govern-
 ment as a legal opposition group, seems most concerned with its own
 internal organization and with programs designed to develop popular
 support for the Party.  The BWPP is agitating for an end to insurgency
 through formation of a coalition government including opposition
 elements.  Communist efforts to recruit support within the Overseas
 Chinese Community are spearheaded by the China Democratic League (CDL).
 Vithin the framework of these general objectives, the Communist
 parties seek a number of immediate goals.  Domestically, current efforts
 are concentrated on:
 1,  combating the growth of anti-Communist sentiment among the over-
 seas Chinese;
 2.  penetrating Buddhist organizations;
 3.  increasing the membership of "mass organizations," which have
 thus far been relatively small in Burma; and
 4.  undermining the political position of the government and the
 Socialist Party which is its dominant element.
 Internationally, the chief immediate goal is to prevent a shift in
 official Burmese foreign policy toward the West and the US in
 particular.
 .  References in this section to insurgent activity refer principally
 to action by the Burma Communist Party (BCP).  Other Communist
 underground groups include:  (1) the Communist Party (Burma) --
 CP(B) -- which is a relatively small splinter group, and (2) a band
 of China-trained guerrillas under leadership of the Kachin renegade
 Naw Seng, which does not appear to be in contact with the BCP.

 There is, to some extent, a conflict between the policy of
 preparation for eventual overthrow'of the government and "legal"
 efforts to establish a broad popular base and to create pressures
 leading to a coalition government.  The GUB is unlikely to be respon-
 sive to demands for a coalition as long as armed insurrection continues
 to threaten the political and economic stability of the nation, despite
 its apparent acquiescence in a rather artificial distinction between
 BCP insurgency and BWPP legal action.  At the present time, overall
 Communist strategy seems to favor the "legal" efforts of the UWPP.
 II.  TACTICS
 Current tactics include attempts to establish collaborative
 arrangements with other political groups and attempts to win direct
 following, for the party or its fronts, from diverse elements within
 the Burman and minority populations.  The strength of the Communist
 appeal rests in the coincidence of certain aspects of current Communist
 policy with general Burmese fears and aspirations -- neutralist, anti-
 colonialist, and "peace" sentiments.                                   The basically Marxist orientation
 of most present-day Burmese leaders, and the lingering sense of attach-
 ment to the homeland among the Chinese community also favor Communist
 efforts.
 Special appeals are.directed to identifiable groups within the
 population -- particularly youth and students and, most recently, the
 Buddhist leaders.  There are some reports that Communist propagandists,
 perhaps aided by Chinese specialists, are attempting to subvert the
 minority peoples along the Sino-Burma border.
 The BWPP's small delegation in the Chamber of Deputies is
 important primarily as a focal point for expression of what are
 basically extra-parliamentary political pressures.  Popular organiza-
 tions controlled by the BVPP or its labor wing, the Burma Trade Union
 Congress, are utilized to create the impression of popular demand for
 policies favored by the Party.  In addition to opposing the specific
 actions or presumed intentions of the Government, political pressures.
 have been used in an attempt to destroy public confidence in the
 competence of the present Government.  In planning its program, the
 E PP seems to be responsive to direction from the Chinese Embassy,
 through which it apparently receives some financial support.
 At the same time, guerrilla activity is continuing among under-
 ground groups.  Although the BCP forces have increasingly been broken
 up into small. groups by Government military pressure, marauding bands
 still render large areas of the country insecure.  Present insurgent
 military operations seem designed primarily to secure supplies and
 manpower, and to keep government forces off balance.

 SECRET .. SECURITY INFORMATION
 The BCP is capable of continuing its present level of guerrilla-
 type insurgency, thereby preventing the consolidation of government
 control over all Burma and retarding economic recovery and development.
 The BiVPP appears to have sufficient leadership, and an adequately dis-
 ciplined organization, to continue its agitational and penetration
 tactics, designed to maintain political pressure on the government and
 retard its slowly emerging trend toward a closer relationship with the
 West.
 The prospects for future Communist action will be determined
 largely by developments outside Burma, particularly decisions concerning
 broader Asian strategy.  In the event of direct invasion or a greatly
 magnified program of direct aid to insurgent groups, the stability of
 the GUB would be seriously threatened.  The Government might, in the
 absence of immediate and effective help from the West, seek accommoda-
 tion with Asian Communism, and it is relatively certain that the
 prestige and power of local Communist elements would be rapidly
 magnified.
 In the absence of external intervention, however, the Government
 will probably continue to make progress in its efforts to suppress the
 insurgents and may, as larger areas of the' country are secured, be
 emboldened to take more restrictive measures against "legal" Communist
 elements.  In that event, the BNPP, which now appears to be the chief
 instrument of international Communist policy in Burma, might find its
 access to propaganda outlets circumscribed and its ability to manipulate
 front groups curtailed before its present organizational efforts have
 born fruit.  In the absence of actual or imminently threatened invasion,
 or of unforeseen internal economic disorders, it seems unlikely that
 the parliamentary position of the BWPP will improve significantly or
 that its mass base will grow materially.
 The capacity of Burmese Communist groups to support Soviet
 policy will, therefore, depend directly on Soviet (or Chinese) action.
 The 1948 insurrection by the BCP has thus far failed in its primary
 aim of overthrowing the government and, balanced against an improving
 government position, its future is even less promising.  Were it not
 for the ever-present threat that the Burmese future will be over-
 whelmed by events beyond its borders, it might be predicted that the
 Communist conspiracy would continue to wither, although at an
 agonizingly slow rate.

 COMMUNISM-IN BURMA:  ASSETS
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 An assessment of Communist strength in Burma must include both
 the illegal insurgent movement and above-ground Communist elements.
 Available data are insufficient to permit a definitive statement of
 total numerical strength.
 The Burma Communist Party (BCP) is the most important element
 of the underground movement.  Its membership is estimated to be
 about 5,000.  A small splinter group, the Communist Party (Burma) --
 CP(B) -- was estimated in 1951 to have about 300 members and candi-
 dates.  The CP(B) split from the BCP in 1946 as a result of personal
 differences within the Communist leadership.  The two groups, however,
 reportedly concluded an agreement for at least limited military
 cooperation in August 1952.
 The principal above-ground group now appears to be the Burma
 Workers and Peasants Party (BVPP), which was formed in December 1950
 by a group of dissident Socialists.. The party membership is unknown,
 but it has become increasingly well disciplined and energetic, taking
 effective leadership of Communist-dominated "front groups."  The most
 significant of the latter are:  (1) the Burma Trade Union Congress
 (BTUC) with a present estimated membership of about 2,000; (2) the All-
 Burma Peasants Organization (ABPO), which claims a membership of
 100,000, probably with considerable exaggeration; (3) the World Peace
 Congress (Burma) with a small but vocal membership; and (4) the People's
 Youth Organization (PYO), which was founded only in December 1952 but
 which has considerable potential importance.  Communist organizations
 within the Overseas Chinese community are dominated by the China
 Democratio League (CDL), the nearest equivalent of a Chinese Communist
 Party.  The League's membership is unknown.
 Although the membership of Communist organizations therefore
 seems relatively small, the number of individuals who are subject to
 Communist influence and pressure is probably significantly higher,
 partly because of widespread receptivity in Burma to a number of aspects
 of current Communist propaganda efforts.  The number who are "strongly
 influenced" by Communist elements should probably include most of the
 membership of the non-Communist Trade Union Congress (Burma), and the
 membership of the People's Peace Front (PPF) and Mahabama parties, which
 collaborate with the BXPP.  The Chinese population as a whole remains
 vulnerable to Communist pressure, but since 1950 vigorous efforts
 by non-Communist Chinese elements have probably reduced the number who
 are strongly influenced.  Rural populations are exposed to Communist
 propaganda and organizational effort for short periods in the course
 of guerrilla operations.  Although no adequate figures are

 available, it seems likely that 5 percent of the total Burmese
 population may be controlled or strongly influenced by Communist
 elements.
 Geographically, Communist strength is heavily concentrated in
 Rangoon and the southern towns of Burma (the BWPP and CDL groups)
 and in insurgent pockets in central and northern Burma (BCP).  The
 main sources of Burmese Communist recruits appear to have been
 students and youth, intellectuals, and peasants; urban labor has thus
 far been less significant.  Among the resident Chinese, the leadership
 is predominantly middle class in origin; laboring classes provide the
 bulk of membership; and a number of businessmen appear to be passive
 sympathizers.
 Comparatively little is known concerning the quality and
 reliability of the Communist membership or of its leaders.  Although
 the guerrilla groups undoubtedly include some elements whose principal
 motivation is organized banditry, the leadership appears to possess
 firm political resolve and to be in effective control of its following.
 The surrender rate among insurgent groups has remained relatively low
 despite mounting government military pressure.  Most of the leadership
 has belonged to Marxist, if not Communist, organizations for a period
 of five to ten years.
 The above-ground BWPP has recently been reorganized and "puri-
 fied" in a move which has apparently strengthened its internal
 homogeneity and removed elements of doubtful reliability.  Although
 it is probable that the total membership has declined somewhat since
 mid-1951, it seems likely that the strength and dependability of the
 party has increased, and that it will continue to exercise effective
 leadership of above-ground pro-Communist groups.
 The leadership of the China Democratic League is relatively
 more experienced and many of its important leaders have been trained
 in China.  The membership of the League inoreased"markedly between
 1946 and 1950; in the last two years, however, its total strength has
 remained relatively stable and may have declined somewhat.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 Since the underground Communist parties are outlawed, Communist
 voting power is reflected only in the votes received by candidates of
 the B41PP and the parties which support it -- chiefly the People's
 Peace Front and the Mahabama.  The parliamentary strength of these
 groups in the Chamber of Deputies elected in 1951, related to the
 representation of other parties, is as follows,

 The moat recent test of Communist electoral strength occurred
 in the Rangoon municipal. elections of February 20, 1952.  The three
 opposition parties listed above ran joint candidates, under the
 banner of the Triple Alliance.  The coalition won only one seat out
 of 35, in contrast with a representation of 15 seats for comparable
 parties in the Council elected in 1949.  However, these figures do
 not reflect BXPP strength adequately, for Triple Alliance candidates
 are reported to have received almost half the total vote given to
 candidates of the governing coalition (the Anti-Fascist People's
 Freedom League).  Nevertheless, the drastic decline in Council seats
 is significant because of the predominant role of Rangoon in national
 life.
 Although the B1RPP and its affiliated groups are currently
 agitating for a coalition government including the Communists, there
 is no evidence of specific planning for future. elections.
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 The Communist insurrection in Burma, coupled with Karen
 insurgency and the depredations of non-political bandit gangs, has
 effectively and seriously retarded Burmese recovery from wartime
 devastation.  It is a continuing, though somewhat diminishing? threat
 to the integrity of the state.  The insurgency is exploited by above-
 ground Communist elements in their attacks on the government.
 Of the various insurgent elements, the Burma Communist Party
 (BCP) has been and remains the most significant.  The party controls
 as many as 8,000 guerrillas, which are now organized in small bands.
 There have been no recent report of concentrations of more than 300
 in a single group.  The BCP is reported to have succeeded recently
 in establishing a coalition with two other underground elements:
 (1) the Communist Party (Burma), with an estimated strength of 1,000;
 and (2) some elements of the White Band People's Volunteer Organization
 -- total PVO strength is estimated at 3,000, but the effective
 strength of collaborating groups is unknown.  A potentially important
 group, which is now apparently independent of the BCP, is a force of
 Kachin-Burman-Chinese guerrillas, estimated at 1,500, under the

 leadership of the renegade Naw geng.  Naw Seng's two battalions have
 been trained in China, and may represent the beat disciplined and most
 thoroughly indoctrinated insurgent group.
 All insurgent groups appear to be currently concentrating on
 strengthening their control of limited, relatively inaccessible "base
 areas."  BCP groups have been pushed back within the past year by
 government military operations; their current strength is located
 chiefly in central Burma south of Mandalay, in northern Burma, and
 in the western region stretching toward the Chin Hills.  CP(B) groups
 are located primarily in the Irrawaddy delta and westward toward the
 Arakan.  Naw Seng's force is reported to be in the Bhamo area in
 northern Burma.
 No significant military operations have been undertaken recently
 by-the insurgent groups except the BCP, and these have been confined to
 hit-and-run raids against government outposts, attacks on trans-
 portation and communications lines, and harassment of villages which
 are inadequately protected.  Troops not so engaged are concerned
 primarily with protecting Communist-held areas from government forces,
 but in case of attack, the Communists prefer to withdraw rather than
 fight as long as it is possible to remove supplies and equipment.
 Little has been learned concerning the administrative apparatus
 established by BCP groups in areas which they control.  Although the
 party claims to govern local areas -- appointing officials, directing
 education, and controlling marketing -- it is doubtful whether any
 permanent administrative apparatus has been established.. Above-
 ground Communist groups are primarily responsible for propaganda
 activity, but the BCP has undoubtedly carried on some propaganda work
 in connection with local recruiting efforts.
 The degree of popular support which Communist guerrillas have
 received seems to be a function of the military force which they can
 apply in any area.  For the most part, the rural population appears
 to be passive, reacting to preponderant military pressure and aiding
 guerrillas only when coercion is present or threatened.  The guerrilla
 groups live off the country, and no central supply organization is
 known to exist.  Even though the several groups are relatively
 independent, there is some intercommunication (including radio), and
 Communist intelligence concerning government operations appears to
 have been generally good.
 The BCP leadership has made persistent efforts to secure
 effective working arrangements with other insurgent groups.  In
 August 1952, an agreement was reportedly reached with representatives

 - s -
 of the Communist Party (Burma) and some White Band elements of the
 People's Volunteer Organization, providing for collaboration and
 demarcation of respective areas of activity.  Because of past personal
 antagonisms among leaders of the various groups, the realization of a
 working arrangement would appear to reflect desperation born of
 declining strength, or perhaps a BCP effort to qualify for more
 extensive Chinese assistance by providing evidence of effective leader-
 ship of all guerrilla elements.
 External assistance (from China) to the Communist guerrillas
 has. thus far been sporadic and at a relatively low level.  Some BCP
 cadres are reported to have received training in Yunnan.  Naw Seng's
 guerrilla units have been trained in China, and may pose a more
 significant long-term threat to the government by establishing a
 protected base area in a remote region of northern Burma.   There are
 no reliable reports of significant amounts of arms being furnished to
 Burmese guerrillas from China.
 In its efforts to suppress the Communist insurgency, the Burma
 Government has been handicapped by the necessity of simultaneously
 containing Chinese Nationalist troops in eastern Burma, attempting to
 subdue Karen rebels, and suppressing'Moslem dissidents in the Arakan.
 Total government strength of about 60,000, including the Union
 Military Police, is heavily taxed by its varied responsibilities,
 and the forces available for anti-Communist efforts fluctuates from
 time to time, in accordance with demands created by the actions of
 other dissident groups.  Key posts are manned; mobile reserves are
 maintained at central locations; and from time to time offensive
 actions are taken against isolated pockets of resistance.
 In the absence of stepped-up external assistance, the future
 capabilities of the Communist insurgents are not likely to improve.
 Although the guerrilla forces have been able to maintain their
 strength for some time, no significant expansion has taken place.  It
 is not clear whether manpower or arms shortages represent the chief
 limitation.  On balance, the government position has improved within
 the past year; perhaps the most significant development has been the
 increasing fragmentation of guerrilla forces and the restoration of
 agricultural production in some areas of the Irrawaddy delta which
 have been cleared on insurgents.  In addition to weakening the
 resource base of the Communists, this development will, in the long
 run, contribute to the strength and stability of the government.
 So far as is known, the above-ground BWPP has organized no
 paramilitary units, and has no plans for participation in violent
 action.  In order to keep its present legal status, the party must at
 least preserve the appearance of being no more than an opposition
 political party.

 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 Present government policy draws a somewhat artificial distinction
 between political pressure and insurgency which, in turn, has led to
 the development of the two arms of the Communist movement in Burma.
 The insurrectionary Communist parties -- BCP and CP(B) -- have been
 outlawed by the Government, and exist only as underground movements.
 The BWPP, however, is a legal, political party, has a small parlia-
 mentary representation (9 seats out of 232) and is relatively unob-
 structed in its manipulation of front groups.  (Exception:  the
 government has occasionally denied passports to proposed delegates to
 international Communist meetings.)
 Because of official reluctance to prevent distribution of
 literature which is not openly seditious, Communist propagandists
 havesecured important outlets for dissemination of printed propa-
 ganda, taking advantage of an existing market for any literature which
 is interpreted as shedding light on "experiments in socialism."
 Recently, however the Home Minister issued a strong warning to
 publicists who spread false information, advocate armed uprising, or
 undermine the security of the state.
 Within the Chinese community, the CDL and other Communist fronts
 have been permitted considerable political freedom of action in Burma,
 owing to the Burma Government's neutralist foreignpolicy, its desire
 not to antagonize Communist China, and to the fact that Peiping has not
 encouraged the Burma Chinese to indulge in overt agitation against
 the Burma Government.  Nevertheless, Chinese Communist political
 activity is limited by the Burmese constitutional provisions that only
 Burmese nationals may vote and by the exclusion of a large proportion
 of the Chinese from Burmese citizenship.
 During 1951-52, the increasingly vitriolic anti-Western tone of
 local Chinese Communist propaganda, which the Burma government deemed
 injurious to Burma's neutral position, and the affiliation of pro-
 Communist Chinese with Burmese extreme leftist opposition elements, led
 to the government's tacit encouragement of anti-Communist elements
 in the Chinese community.  It is expected that the government will
 continue its present policy of sharply scrutinizing, though not
 severely restricting, local Chinese Communist political activities,
 and of tacitly encouraging the anti-Communist Chinese.
 There is. relatively little organized labor in Burma; total
 union membership is probably less than 70,000.  The Socialist-
 controlled Trade Union Congress (Burma) -- TUC(B) -- split in

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 December 1950 when the BWPP,wah organized; the dissident union leaders
 formed the Burma Trade Union Congress (BTUC), which is now Communist-
 controlled.
 The most important affiliates of the BTUC are the All-Burma
 Ministerial Services Union (ABMSU), which is small but vital because
 its members staff government offices, and the Chauk Oilfields Workers
 Front.  Total BTUC membership was estimated in mid-1952 at less than
 2,000.  The percentage of Communists to non-Communists within the
 BTUC unions is unknown; the leadership is Communist, however, and
 .appears to be in effective control.
 In addition to the BTUC, there are at least a dozen Chinese
 labor unions, most of them small and concentrated in Rangoon; all
 except the Carpenters Union are Communist-controlled.  The Most
 important are those which deal with food marketing and handling,. the
 Teachers Union, and the Stevedores Union.
 Apart from Communist-controlled unions, there is probably some
 surviving Communist influence in most of the unions affiliated with
 the Socialist-led TUC(B).  Since the 1950 split, the struggle for
 control between BTUC and TUC(B) leaders has been particularly strong
 in the Inland Water Transport Workers Union and its five subsidiary
 groups.  Although the leadership now supports the'TUC'(B), Communist
 influence may still be prevalent in some locals.
 The Communist-controlled BTUC has been affiliated with the
 World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) since July 1951.  The status
 of the TUC(B) in relation to WFTU is at present unclear.  Prior to the
 1950 split which led to formation of the BTUC, the parent organization
 had been affiliated.:  A 1951 May Day resolution expressed interest in
 continued membership, but TUC(B) leaders have since stated that the
 group is not presently affiliated.  It is certain that the TUC(B) has
 not been active in WFTU affairs.
 VI.  CONQUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL,
 CULTURAL,                       A    T ONS
 The most active Communist front organizations are in the fields
 of youth and student activities, international "friendship" societies
 and the Communist "peace movement," and among the Overseas Chinese.
 The following groups merit special mention:
 1.  Youth:  There are two underground youth organizations, the
 Communist Youth League and the Democratic Peopls's Youth League, which
 are probably small but under effective BCP. control.  The B4i'PP sponsored
 no distinct youth organization until December 1952, when the People's
 SECRET - SECURITY.INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Youth Organization (PYO) was founded.  Although at present, in the
 formative stage, the PYO may become the focal point for Communist
 activity among youth and students.  The only non-Communist youth
 organization, the Burma Youth League, is non-political and relatively
 insignificant.
 2.  Students:  The All-Burma Students Federation (ABSF) and the
 All-Rangoon Students Union are believed to be Communist-controlled.
 The ABSF is probably affiliated with the International Union of
 Students.    The only competing organization is the Rangoon University
 Students Union (RUSU) which has experienced a continual struggle for
 control between Communist and non-Communist elements.  The most recent
 elections for union officers reflect some persisting. Communist
 influence.
 3.  The World Peace Council:  The Burma Branch of the World Peace
 Council -- WFC(B) -- Is probably one of the most significant "front"
 groups although its active membership is believed to be relatively
 small.   Branches of the parent organization have been established in a
 number of towns, and the group may be the most effective instrument
 for dissemination of Communist propaganda outside of Rangoon.  The
 Council is controlled by the BWPP; its Secretary General, Ba Nyein,
 is a member of the BoIPP.Executive Committee and is considered the
 party's "leading thinker."
 4.  Chinese Organizations:  A number of organizations within the
 Overseas Chinese commun    are  ommunist-controlled or at least pro-
 Peiping.  Next to the China Democratic League, the most important
 Chinese group is the Chamber of Commerce.  Its leadership is pre-
 dominantly pro-Peiping, although control is being vigorously contested
 by anti-Communist elements within the Chamber.  The Hui-an Young Men's
 Association, the Chinese Youth Society, and the Chinese Students Union
 attempt to spread Communist influence among youth and students; the
 first two are outstanding among all Chinese youth organizations.  Of
 the several regional Chinese societies, the Fukienese Association is
 the only one which is considered to be Communist-dominated.  Other
 Communist-controlled Chinese organizations include:  the Chinese
 Women's Association, the Women's Welfare Workers Society, the Burma
 Chinese Relief Association, and the Burma Chinese Cultural Union.
 5.  Women:  The All-Burma Women's Freedom League, formed by
 the BWPP in January 1951, is the most active of three legal women's
 organizations in Burma.  A smaller group, the All-Burma Women's Union,
 is controlled by the BCP and has been underground since 1947.
 6.  Friendship Societies:  The Sino-Burmese Friendship Society..
 and the Burma-Soviet Cultural Association are small but significant

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 groups, because membership is drawn largely from educated and therefore
 relatively influential classes.  The former is now composed exclusively
 of Burmese, and is devoted to promoting interest in China and preserving
 "traditional ties of friendship."  The latter was formed with tacit
 approval of the Soviet Embassy in Rangoon, but appears to be operated
 by Burmese, including some non-Communists, who are. interested in
 Soviet culture.
 7.  Minorities=  Apart from the numerous Chinese organizations,
 the principal m nority groups controlled by Communists or Communist-
 sympathizers are the All-Burma Indian Youth League and the All-Burma
 Indian Congress.  Communist penetration of the Indian minority has
 been largely limited to laborers, some of whom are also represented
 in Communist-dominated unions.
 Organizational efforts appear to be directed at present toward
 enlarging Communist-controlled units within important organizations
 and securing mass support for the propaganda appeals of above-ground
 Communist groups.  Most politically conscious Burmese support some
 policies which are currently advocated by local communists:  eg.,
 resolution of the problem posed by the Chinese Nationalist troops in
 Burma, some aspects of the "peace" campaign, and anti-colonialism.
 It has not been possible to determine the extent to which advocacy
 of such programs by non-Communist Burmese represents oonsoious support
 of particular Communist policies.  Quite clearly, however, Communist
 influence extends beyond those organizations which are controlled. or
 strongly influenced by Communists.

 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 Direct Communist infiltration of the Burma Government appears to
 have been slight.     So far as is known, no Communists are represented in
 policy-making bodies or in top levels of the military and police organ-
 izations.                                    Although there are probably some Communists or Communist-
 sympathizers on the staffs of the several government departments, there
 is no evidence that they have had a direct impact on policies and pro-
 grams of the government.
 Nevertheless, it may be well to point out  that, indirectly at
 least, Communist "influence" is present within the government'at almost
 all levels.  The most important Communist asset is the strength of Com-
 munist China; fear of antagonizing the powerful neighbor to the north
 has been directly responsible for the government's rigid verbal adherence
 to a neutral foreign policy.
 Secondly, most government officials subscribe to Marxist views
 in fields such as economic organization, and their background has
 stimulated an interest in "socialist experiments" in other parts of the
 world. Many are known to read Soviet and Chinese. literature.  This
 indirect influence is stronger with some individuals than others.  The
 present Minister of Land Nationalization, Thakin Tin, for example, holds
 extreme leftist views on nationalization and collectivization, although
 he is not known to be a Communist.  In general, there is far more
 interest in the Chinese "experiment" than in the Soviet Union, and it
 is doubtful whether such interest is attributable, at the top levels of
 government, to direct Communist infiltration..
 VIII.  COMMU IST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 Just as there is some indirect Communist influence at official
 levels, so interest in China and to a limited degree a curiosity about
 the USSR have opened the way to. some Communist influence on the public
 opinion-forming process.  This is attributable as such to the predispo-
 sitions-of non-Communist Burmese as to direct  efforts by Communist
 elements.
 There is some Communist influence in educational circles, partic-
 ularlythe Chinese schools and in higher Burmese educational: institutions.
 Of the more than 200 Chinese schools in Burma, a majority appear to be
 using Peiping-approved textbooks, although there has been some recession
 .in Communist penetration since 1950.  There is also continuing Communist
 penetration of student groups at Rangoon University .
 Penetration of Buddhist, circles has thus far been slight, although
 efforts to secure Buddhist support for international Communist "causes"
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 are currently being intensified, apparently with some success.  The
 government has shown genuine concern over these developments, and is
 endeavoring to counteract Communist influence by stimulating Buddhist
 revival programs, denying passports to Buddhist priests recruited for
 international Communist conferences, etc.
 The Communist press is relatively small, but non-Communist
 publications, on their own initiative, support some current Communist
 propaganda themes (most notably, the "menace" of Chinese Nationalist
 troops in eastern Burma, and evidences of "colonialism" in all parts
 of the world.)
 The Soviet Embassy in Rangoon has recently secured an outlet
 for Chinese and Russian films, by renting the King Theater on a monthly
 basis.  During 1951 over 100 Chinese films were exhibited in Rangoon,
 and although the contents are not known, it seems safe to assume that
 many contained Communist propaganda themes.
 No noteworthy infiltration of right-wing political organizations
 and parties has come to light.  Among left-wing, non-Communist politi-
 cal groups, there has been considerable indirect influence; some ele-
 ments of Communist dogma (anti-colonialism, collectivism) have wide
 appeal in most political circles in.Burma, due to historical experience
 and Marxist training of most national leaders.  Direct Communist in-
 fluence, however, appears to be declining.  There is an increasing
 tendency, particularly at the top levels, to distinguish between cur
 rent Soviet behavior and the theoretical Marxist formulations to which
 many Burmese leaders still adhere.
 Collaboration with Communist elements by some Karen leaders and
 Dr. Ba Maw's Mahabama party appears to be based on expediency, rather
 than on ideological-compatibility.

 X.  C0'WIAUNIST PROPAGANDA "AEDIA
 For practical purposes, the Rangoon press is synonymous with
 the Burmese press.  Very little publishing activity is carried on out-
 side the capital city, and for that reason, human-carrier techniques
 are probably more important in the dissemination of Communist propa-
 ganda than formal media of communication.  In addition to the
 periodicals listed below, there is a considerable amount of pamphlet
 literature circulated within Burma, a good deal of it prepared or
 controlled by Communist organizations.

 C.  Printing Establishments
 The following information is incomplete, but probably covers
 the most important local sources of Communist publications, excluding
 newspapers:
 1.  Kyaw Linn Booksellers and Publishers, /180, 51st Street,
 Rangoon -- Kyaw Linn has translated and printed books on China and
 the USSR, in addition to distributing literature reportedly sup-
 plied through Soviet and Chinese Embassy channels in Delhi.  Kyaw
 Linn reportedly has been aided by the Rangoon Chinese Embassy with
 an initial capital investment.  The firm manages at least four
 bookstalls on Bogyoke Street.  The US Embassy has estimated that
 sales at each average more than 1,000 books per week.
 2.  Myint Swe Publishing House, Rangoon -- This firm is
 reported to have translated and published some of the works of
 Mao Tse-tung.  It is not a prosperous concern.
 3.  Central Publishing House, Bogyoke Market, Rangoon --
 This firm publishes and sells Burmese translations of popular
 Communist literature.

 In addition, pamphlet literature seems to be distributed in fairly
 large quantities.
 E.  Publications of Soviet-Satellite Diplomatic Establishments
 Viet Minh representatives in Rangoon publish a weekly bulletin
 entitled "Vietnam Information."  Its total circulation is unknown.
 Distribution to many parts of the world is handled in Rangoon.
 The Chinese Embassy apparently subsidizes one or more papers in
 Rangoon, but is not known to publish any periodicals itself.
 Local radio broadcasting is a government monopoly, and no direct
 Communist influence has been discernible.  There is no known Communist
 broadcasting activity in Burma, except 'possibly for some radio communi-
 cation among guerrilla units.  The military network, if it exists, is
 probably used primarily for operational liaison and not for public
 propaganda activity.
 There is a limited audience for both Soviet and Chinese broad-
 casts.  Soviet broadcasting appears to be confined to daily trans-
 missions in English directed to Southeast Asia, plus the Soviet
 Chinese-language service which can perhaps be heard in Burma.  The
 audience for Chinese Communist broadcasts is probably limited to the
 Chinese community.  Approximately 30 hours per week on international
 beams can be picked up in Burma.  Although no figures are available,
 the number of radio receivers is sufficiently low so that radio is a
 much less significant medium for external propaganda than publications
 and personal contact.

 XI.  FINANCIAL C?NDITION
 No quantitative data on Communist finances are available.  It
 is doubtful whether the dues-paying membership of Communist organiza-
 tions, particularly in the labor unions, is very large, and direct
 receipts of this kind can be only a minor element in total party
 finances.  The underground guerrilla groups appear to be heavily de-
 pendent on local requisitioning and foraging in the areas of current
 military operations.
 Above-ground Communist groups are known to receive contributions
 from businessmen and other groups which are vulnerable to persuasion or
 pressure.  The China Democratic League, in particular, probably derives
 part of its financial support from merchants engaged in trade with
 China.  It is not known, however, whether any of these firms exist
 primarily for purposes of financing Communist activity.
 Leaders of the Burma Workers and Peasants Party apparently re-
 ceive some financial assistance through the Chinese Embassy in Rangoon.
 The money spent on local rallies (where, frequently, no collections
 are taken) suggests outside financial help.  In addition, supplies of
 Chinese Communist publications are a direct contribution to local
 Communist propaganda activity.  It is not known whether the Soviet
 Embassy has contributed directly to local party finances.
 In general, the financial condition of the Burmese Communists
 appears to be poor, with the exception of activities connected with
 the increasingly virulent propaganda campaign.  The guerrilla groups
 have been able to sustain their present level of activity, but do not
 appear to have financial resources adequate to attract wider support
 or to procure additional arms.
 Chinese Communist elements, by virtue of their ability to exact
 donations from local businessmen, are in much better financial condi-
 tion than the Burmese groups.

 XII.  SOVIET SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 A.  Communist China
 The first Chinese Communist Ambassador to Burma presented his
 credentials in September 1950. By August 1952, the Embassy staff was
 reported to. include 15 principal officers and 26 other members.  Many
 of these individuals are described as "active outside," implying that
 considerable efforts are made to keep in contact with local Chinese
 organizations of various types.  Supplies of printed propaganda are
 apparently funneled through the Embassy for distribution throughout
 the Chinese community, utilizing schools, commercial, labor, and cul-
 tural organizations as outlets and as centers for displays.  It is
 probable that propaganda activity, in the broadest sense, is an impor-
 tant responsibility of most members of the Embassy staff.
 The Sino-Burmese Friendship Society also functions with support
 from the Chinese Embassy.  Its membership (total unknown but apparently
 relatively small) includes non-Communists interested in cultural re-
 lations with China as well as pro-Communist elements.
 The Soviet Embassy was established in Rangoon in April 1951, with
 an original staff of eight.  In late 1951, the total staff was reported
 to number 31, including housekeeping and administrative personnel.  The
 Embassy has a Press Attache, and it seems probable that other staff
 members are engaged in essentially propaganda and contact work, since
 the size of the Embassy is greater than regular Embassy activities would
 justify.
 The Burma-Soviet Cultural Association, headed by a respected
 member of the Rangoon University faculty, was founded early in 1952.
 The Soviet Embassy appears to have left the initiative primarily to
 Burmese intellectuals interested in the USSR, with quiet encouragement
 for the society's activities.  The first open meeting was attended by
 about 200 persons, but active membership is not known.
 Co  European Satellites
 A Czechoslovak Consulate General was opened July 10, 1952, but
 no information on its staff is available.  A Hungarian trade delegation
 is reported to be in Rangoon, but its size also is unknown.  The
 activities of both the Czech Consul General and the Hungarian trade
 delegation members, although ostensibly directed toward increasing trade,
 probably include activities which should be labeled as propaganda.

 XI II.   COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 Although no international Communist organizations maintain
 permanent bureaus or offices in Burma, the activities of some of these
 groups have been an important part of the total Communist propaganda
 effort in Burma.  Local propaganda organs play up Burmese participation
 in international conferences both before and after Burmese delegations

 Although the delegations have usually included Communists, they have not
 been composed exclusively of known party members.
 Burmese participation in the work of international "front"
 organizations seems to have been largely limited to-attendance at these
 conferences.  Although no reliable data*are available, it seems un-
 likely that financial contributions have been received from Burmese
 groups. On the contrary, the international organizations appear to.
 subsidize the participation of. Burmese groups, at least to the extent
 of underwriting expenses while travelers are in orbit countries.

 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 A.  International Party Channels
 All Communist elements in Burma emphasize the country's ties to
 China, because of a general Burmese sense of nearness to China and an
 interest in Chinese developments.  Outwardly, therefore, the closest
 international links appear to be with Communist China.  Ties with the
 Indian Communist Party have not been close, although one finds
 occasional references to liaison with representatives of the East
 Bengal Communist Party.
 There is ample, although circumstantial, evidence that above-
 ground Communist elements follow international Communist directives
 concerning propaganda drives, although local implementation of specific
 campaigns is frequently tardy.  Under the'direction of local "front"
 groups, the world-wide "signature campaigns" are carried on in Burma,
 and particular propaganda themes related to Far Eastern affairs are
 generally carried in local organs.  It is not known, however, whether
 the Chinese or the Soviet Embassy is the original source of directives
 to local groups.
 Although there are frequent reports of directives from Chinese
 or Soviet officials concerning party strategy in Burma, it is impossible
 to determine whether specific moves, particularly with reference to
 guerrilla activity, are the direct result of Chinese or Soviet direction.
 Since early in 1952, there seems to have been a shift in emphasis, from
 direct military action to above-ground agitation for a "united front"
 government and an end to insurgency.  It is not clear whether the mili-
 tary weakness of the insurgent groups is responsible for the shift, or
 whether it was made in response to a directive concerning general Asian
 Communist strategy.
 1.  International courier system. The Chinese Embassy in Rangoon is
 known to have a regular courier service, and it is probable that the
 Soviet Embassy provides similar facilities.  In addition, commercial
 channels are readily available within the Chinese community.  There are
 reports that crew members of ships calling at Rangoon serve as contacts
 with both Chinese and-Soviet Embassies, but details are unavailable.
 There is also direct overland communication with China, but it is not
 possible to state whether these routes are more important than sea con-
 tacts.  Available evidence suggests, without definite proof, that the
 above-ground BWPP has direct access to the Chinese Embassy in Rangoon,
 and that the underground BCP maintains overland contact with China.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 It is probable that arrangements for guerrilla training in China are
 made by direct liaison with Chinese officials in Yunnan.
 2.  Domestic communications.  The nature of current Communist
 operations reduces the need for close integration among the several
 elements.  Above-ground activities are concentrated in Rangoon and in
 major towns, and personal travel is limited only by deficiencies in
 local transportation.  Underground activity is apparently linked by
 courier and radio facilities between guerrilla areas, but details are
 unavailable.  Radio equipment is frequently moved to avoid capture,
 and the location of present installations is unknown.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party;.and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 C OMMUN IBM IN IND CCHINA s  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 All of the immediate objectives of the Communists in Indochina are
 related to their effort to win the bitter civil war which they are waging
 against the forces of the French Union.  Within the area which they have
 conquered, the Communist objective is to improve their control over popu-
 lation and resources in order to maximize their total military effort.
 Within the areas controlled by the legitimate Governments of Vietnam, Laos,
 and Cambodia, the Communist objectives area
 1.  To subvert the loyalty of the population.
 2.  To improve the party's covert organization.
 II.  TACTICS
 Communism's objectives in Indochina are furthered by the Soviet and
 satellite-recognized "Democratic Republic of Vietnam," its Chinese-supported
 and equipped army, its administrative and control organizations (police,
 secret  and security services, propaganda organizations, administrative.
 cadres), and by its popular front movement, the "Lien Viet" or "National
 Unity Front."
 The entire insurrectionary structure is held together and controlled
 by the Laodong (Communist) Party.   It is the Laodong.Party which, in the
 final resort, operates the complex mechanism of war, propaganda, and compul-
 sion which appears to the people of Vietnam and to the outside world as the
 "Viet Minh" movement.  And the Laodong Party, in turn, is managed by a
 group of highly trained and thoroughly experienced revolutionary leaders.
 The Communist Party in Indochina uses.both military tactics and
 political warfare tactics to further its over-all objectives.
 Its military tactics are designed: (1) to inflict maximum disrup-
 tion and destruction on enemy forces and enemy war potential in the rear
 zones, with the minimum expenditure of Viet Minh forces; (2) to infiltrate,
 occupy, and consolidate territory with a view to securing a continuing
 reservoir of potential manpower recruitment for the army and to finding
 the necessary economic mans (mainly food) to support intensification of
 the war.  These tactics have been highly successful.  For over six years
 the Viet Minh has inflicted heavy casualties on the Franoo-Vietnamese
 forces, while paralyzing Indochinese. economic life and preventing the
 country's recovery.  The Viet Minh is now strongly established in North and
 Northwest Tonkin, in the lightly industrialized and food-producing regions

 of North Central Vietnam, and in the coastal plains of South Central
 Vietnam. Most of China's long common boundary with Indochina is now
 in Viet Minh hands, permitting continued Chinese Communist assistance
 to the Viet Minh armed forces.
 Communist political warfare tactics are designed: (1) to ex-
 tend Communist influence among all social and economic groups in the
 populations of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos; and (2) to consolidate
 Communist control over conquered areas and populations..
 Communist propaganda attempts to exploit sentiment "for independ-
 ence" and "against French colonialism."  To some extent, but only within
 carefully-drawn limits, the attempt to make the Viet Minh effort appear
 one of genuine national resistance to a foreign colonizing power con-
 tinues to displace certain other considerations in Communist tactics.
 Thus, Catholics in the Viet Minh zones have not.been persecuted,. nor,
 until very recently, attacked ideologically, so that the pretense of
 continued Catholic support for the "war of resistance" could be main-
 tained.  Similarly, although agrarian reform has been strongly stressed,.
 landlords have been dispossessed only where it was essential to secure
 fuller cooperation on the part of the landless peasantry.  Orthodox
 Communist doctrine has generally taken second place to "anti-imperialist"
 themes in Viet Minh propaganda.  However, whenever the priority needs of
 intensifying the armed struggle have demanded that themes of "national
 unity" and nationalistic propaganda be soft-pedalled, this has been done,
 particularly since 1951.
 Efforts to consolidate Communist control over areas and popula-
 tions already under Communist influence center upon the peasantry.
 Basic Viet Minh policies and the major part of its propaganda output
 are calculated to increase the peasantry's contribution to the military
 effort.  Both within and outside the zones under direct Viet Minh control,
 the Communists rely heavily upon conspiratorial methods and upon a large
 and widespread system of terror and compulsion.  Such a system has been
 essential not only in providing the necessary vehicle for Communist control
 of the vast masses of people (some 12 million) and the variegated leader-
 ship which the Viet Minh movement has brought under its banners,. but also
 in order to gather the necessary intelligence for military operations and
 political warfare.

 III.  CAPABILITIES
 If Franco-Vietnamese military strength in Indochina does not
 increase, the Viet Minh may become strong enough within the next few
 years to be able, without identifiable Chinese Communist interven-
 tion, to break the current stalemate.  While the Viet Minh's military
 capabilities are at present limited by its exclusion from the more .
 productive regions of Vietnam, this might be overcome by significantly
 increased Chinese Communist materiel and technical assistance and by
 conquest of further territory.  At the same time, although the regime
 continues to be based largely on compulsion and terror and to depend
 mainly for the achievement of its objectives upon increasingly harsh
 exploitation of a war-weary peasantry, the Viet Minh's administrative
 and control capabilities seem adequate to counteract any growth of
 discontent among the populations and armies under its control.  The
 Viet Minh's popular hold on substantial portions of the populations
 outside its own zones, based partly on military prestige, partly on
 continued nationalist appeal, and partly on a widespread mechanism of
 compulsion and terror, is likely to be increased or decreased in.
 proportion to the military power and ideological dynamism which the
 free world, and above all the free states of Vietnam, Cambodia, and
 Laos may be able to bring to bear against it.

 SECRET - SECURITY I'ORMATION
 Communist Party membership, following and strength are heavily
 concentrated in the areas of Indochina controlled by the "Democratic
 Republic of Vietnam."  In the "DRY", the official Communist party, the
 LAO DONG (Workers) Party,has a membership variously estimated at be-
 een 56,000 and 715,000.  Although reliable data on the number of
 people under Communist Party discipline is lacking, the all-enoompassing
 coverage of the constituent organizations of the Communist-controlled
 National Unity Front (LIEN VIET), suggests that a majority of the 12.7
 million inhabitants of the "DRY" may be oonsidered under effective
 Communist control.
 In the areas under the control of the Associated States govern-
 ments of Vietnam$ Cambodia, and Laos, the Communist party is proscribed.
 However, there are obviously Communists in all of these areas, due to
 the ease With which the non-Communist regions can be infiltrated.  In
 Vietnam particularly, but also in Cambodia and Laos, a number of
 clandestine Viet Minh or Chinese-Communist-controlled organizations are
 believed to be operating.
 How many of the 9.9 million population of free Vietnam are under
 Communist discipline cannot be estimated.  Clandestine Communist opera-
 tions are, however, relatively successful.  In part, this is due to a
 widespread Communist system of compulsion; on the other hand, the Viet
 Minh cause continues to exert considerable national appeal in the free
 zones of Vietnam.  It is possible that a substantial portion of the
 Vietnamese population and of the 800,000 Chinese in Vietnam are
 sympathetic to the objectives of the Viet Minh and therefore susceptible
 to Communist influence.
 In Cambodia, it is unlikely that more than 10 percent of the
 population of 3 million (including the Chinese) are strongly influenced
 by Communism.  However, some 5000-10,000 Viet Minh guerrillas, mainly
 concentrated in the Southern provinces, are reported fighting in units of
 about company size against Franoo-K aer forces.  In early 1952, the
 Chinese Communist regime claimed the loyalty of 60 percent of the 300,000
 Chinese in Cambodia.  While this claim is undoubtedly exaggerated, a sub-
 stantial percentage of the Chinese in Cambodia are believed to be under
 Communist influence.
 In Laos, the number of people under Communist influence is believed
 to be extremely small - perhaps one percent of the one million population.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 The number of Viet Minh guerrillas in Laos is estimated at about 5,000.
 Communist strength is believed heaviest in the DRV-oontrolled
 provinces of North Tonkin and North Central Annam; less numerous in "DRV"
 areas in Central Annam and Cochinohina.  Communist influence in free
 Vietnam is probably strongest in the urban areas of Saigon-Cholon, Hanoi,
 and Haiphong.  In Cambodia, Viet Minh influence is strongest in the
 southern provinces where guerrilla units are concentrated.  Chinese
 Communist influence in Cambodia is strongest in Phnom..Penh where the
 Chinese population is heavily concentrated.  In Laws, Communist influence
 is strongest in the Bolovens Plateau region where the Viet Minh guerrillas
 are mainly based.
 Communist Party membership in Indochina is believed to be composed
 principally of professionals and government employees.  In the "DRV",
 industrial workers probably constitute an additional important membership
 group,
 Communist leadership in Indochina is believed to be well-educated
 (Western Europe, China and the USSR), thoroughly experienced, completely
 dedicated, and competent to fulfill not only its present responsibilities
 but those it would inherit as a consequence of total victory in Indochina.
 The average age of the sixteen current top-level Communist leaders is 47.
 Many top leaders have been active since 1930.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 On January 6, 1946, the Viet Minh Government held elections for a
 "Vietnam National Assembly" in an effort to legitimize its rule.  In
 addition to the polling in-areas of North and Central Vietnam under
 DRV control, clandestine votes were taken in parts of South Vietnam.
 There is considerable doubt as to the extent to which these elections re-
 flected the popular will; an implausibly large vote was claimed for a
 country where the parliamentary system is all but unknown.  Among the
 300-odd members of the "elected Assembly," the Viet Minh (then ostensibly
 a coalition of left-wing and nationalist parties under Communist domina-
 tion) emerged as the largest party with 80 delegates.  The 90 independents
 probably also included a significant number of Communists and another
 group of 15 Communists was elected under the label of the "Marxist Party."
 No further elections have been held in the Communist-held areas of
 Indochina.  Elections have, however, taken place in Laos and Cambodia
 and are now about to take place in free Vietnam, although, of course,
 without Communist participation.

 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 A. Total Strength and Character of Communist Forces
 The Viet Minh disposes of a total armed strength of about 315,000
 men, distributed as follows,
 Regular Army,
 130,000
 Regional Forces,
 15,000
 People's Militia,
 110,0000
 The Regular Army is a well-trained, well-equipped, highly mobile,
 modern fighting force capable of waging effective positional warfare
 against France-Vietnamese forces.  The Regional Forces are less well
 equipped and generally recruited regionally for static support of the
 Regular Army.  The People's Militia is locally recruited for village
 defense and small-scale guerrilla action.
 Be  Security of Controlled Areas
 The Viet Minh armed forces of 315,000 men, which are employed both
 for the defense and security of controlled areas and for offensive opera-
 tions based on these areas, are distributed within the "DRV"-controlled
 areas as follows,  174,000 men in Tonkin; 80,000 men in Central Vietnam;
 46,000 in South Vietnam; 10,000 in Cambodia; and 5,000 in Laos.
 The population in Communist-controlled areas has generally been
 stable and tightly-controlled.  Disturbances and riots have, however,
 occasionally been reported, particularly in the strongly Catholic Vinh
 and Thanh Hoa regions of North Central Vietnam.
 Civil administration in "DRV"-oontrolled zones is in the hands of
 administrative cadres directly responsible to the "DRV" Ministry of
 Interior.  It is logical to suppose, although no information is available
 on the subject, that the Viet Minh armed forces have at least temporary
 control of civil administration in regions only recently conquered.  This
 control is presumably exercised by political and administrative cadres of
 the Army.
 C.  Military Support Organizations
 "DRV" supply, cgmmunioations, and intelligence organizations are
 highly developed units operating at all levels of the military administra-
 tion.                          Their authority is derived from Directorates attached to the
 General Staff of the army.  Information concerning the strength of the
 various support organizations is not available  although these organiza-
 tions may be assumed to be quite large.  Their networks are known to
 embrace all of Vietnam, including Franco-Vietnamese areas.
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 In view of the fact that North Vietnam is not only the theater of
 the most active military operations but also the seat of the "DRV" govern-
 ment, supply, communications, and liaison functions are presumably con-
 oentrated in that area.  Intelligence activities are probably concentrated
 in urban centers (chiefly Hanoi and Saigon) as strongly as in strategic
 military areas.
 Available reports indicate that "DRV" support organizations have
 achieved a high degree of efficiency.
 D.  External Military Support
 Reports from a variety of sources, in most cases neither evaluated
 nor confirmed, suggest  that while certain supplies may originate else-
 where in the Soviet bloc, Communist China is the main source of military
 support to the Viet Minh.  The following types of supplies have been
 reported:l
 1. Arms and ammunitions Mountain guns; anti-aircraft guns; light
 machine guns; heavy mac ine guns; field guns; howitzers; mortars;
 rifles, including Browning automatic rifles; pistols; rocket launchers;
 spare parts; ammunition; TNT and other explosives; fuzes; detonators;
 projectiles; grenades and grenade throwers; and land mines,
 2.  Commissary:
 a.  Food:  Rice; maize; dried sweet potatoes; cereals; and soy
 beans, flour.
 be  Clothin :  Uniforms; cotton material; army blankets; cloth
 shoes; rubber shoes; steel helmets.
 3.  Transportation and communication equipment:  Trucks; tires; spare
 parts; gasoline; oil; kerosene; radio sets and field transmitters,   .
 4.  Others  Medical and clinical supplies; X-ray metal testing equip-
 ment; baTanoes; electric meters; electric drills; files; abrasives; saw
 Reports often include quantity figures, frequently between. 400
 and 800 tons per month.   Overlapping of the time periods covered
 and non-comparable quantity designations (e.g. rounds, cases, or tons
 of. ammunition), however, make it impossible to arrive.at meaningful
 totals. Moreover, in a few oases where cross-checking of reported
 totals has been possible, resultant discrepancies have cast further
 doubt upon the validity of the figures reported.

 blades; iron and steel for making cables; electrical distributing
 machinery; agricultural machinery; oxygen containers; oxygen-generating
 machines; gas masks; binoculars; industrial machinery.
 E.  Military Operations
 Military operations in Indochina since 1946 have been conducted in
 virtually all areas of the peninsula, but have.been principally concentra-
 ted in North Vietnam (Tonkin).  There, Communist forces have been, fighting a
 savage battle for over six years for control of the crucial rice-
 producing Red River Delta (in which the key cities of Hanoi and Haiphong
 are located).  At present about 174,000 Communist troops are pitted
 against an estimated 185,000 Franco-Vietnamese forces in the Tonkin
 region.  The principal tactic of the Communist forces has been to harrass
 the Franco-Vietnamese Army by guerrilla warfare inside the Delta and by
 massive attacks against isolated French posts and cities outside the
 Delta..
 A turning point in the battle for Tonkin was reached in the fall
 of 1950, when Viet Minh forces, in quick succession. seized all French
 posts along-the China border (Langson, Caobang, Laokay), excepting only
 Monoay in the extreme eastern coastal sector.  In the fall of 1952,
 Communist forces expelled the French from all of Northwest Tonkin, ex-
 cept Laiohau and Nasan.  At this moment, therefore, the Communist forces
 hold most of Tonkin outside of the key Delta region.  The latter, how-
 ever, in which the vast bulk of Franco-Vietnamese forces is now concen-
 trated, has been heavily infiltrated by Viet Minh forces and is
 besieged at its periphery by some five Viet Minh divisions.
 In Central Vietnam, an estimated 75,000 Franco-Vietnamese forces
 hold the narrow coastal plain from Faifo to Dong Hoi against some 80,000
 Communists who are in control of the remainder of the area.  In South
 Vietnam, an estimated 162,000 Franco-Vietnamese forces control most of
 the region. but conduct frequent and difficult operations against some
 46,000 Viet Minh guerrillas, concentrated principally in the unhealthy
 and almost impenetrable swamps of the Plaine des Jonas.  In Laos and
 Cambodia, Communist military operations are aprawn  limited to small-
 scale harrassment by guerrilla forces.
 F.  Popular Attitudes. Toward the War
 The peasantry of Indochina has.borne the main brunt of the long war.

 operations at the order of one side or the other, constructs public
 works, and -- over and above all this -- produces the food for its own
 subsistence and that of the non-productive hundreds of thousands in the
 armies.  By this time, the peasantry clearly abhors the war and
 anxiously hopes for its and.
 General passivity toward either side in the conflict may in fact
 be said to characterize the sentiments of the vast majority of Indochina's
 civilian population.  However, passivity is less noticeable, and the
 effects of political warfare and propaganda by either side are more
 marked, among city dwellers.  The nationalist pretentious of the Viet
 Minh, rather than Communism itself, continue to hold much appeal for
 Indochina's urban population, whether inside the Viet Minh zones or in
 areas of Franco-Vietnamese control.
 G.  Current Strategic and Tactical Objectives of the Communist Insurrection
 Current strategic and tactical objectives of the Communist
 insurrection are military and political consolidation over newly-won
 territories in northwest Tonkin, and intensified penetration by Viet
 Minh regular forces into the Franco-Vietnamese-held Tonkin Delta area,
 The "DRV" probably will intensify guerrilla warfare in the plateaux
 region of Central Vietnam as well as in Cambodia and South Vietnam and
 may also attempt a limited military penetration into Laos.  In Central
 Vietnam, the Communist forces will probably continue to maintain strong
 pressure against the Franco-Vietnamese forces along the coast.
 H.  Relations of Communist to Non-Communist Insurrectionary Organizations
 1.  Vietnam.  In June 1952 Colonel Trinh Minh The, former Chief of
 Staff o? _t" e warmed forces of the autonomous politico-religious Caodaist
 movement, took to the bush with 2,500 men in South Vietnam to set up
 "the National Resistance Front," a "third force" opposed to both the
 Viet Minh and the French.  Since the spring of 1952, when the French
 launched military operations against this group, Colonel The has not
 been heard from and his current whereabouts are unknown. There is no
 evidence that Colonel The has collaborated with the Viet Minh.
 2.  Cambodia.  In March 1952, Son Ngoc Thanh, a leading Cambodian
 nationalist, organized a dissident nationalist movement.  At first, the
 activities of this group seen to have been limited to propaganda attacks
 against the French and Cambodian King.  In recent months, broadcasts of
 Son Ngoo Thanh have been increasingly favorable to the Viet Minh, but
 the present relationship between these two movements is not clear.
 3.  Cambodian and Laotian Issaraks.  The Cambodian and Laotian
 Issaraks, under the leadership respectively of Son Ngoo Minh and Prince
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 Souphanouvong, have been formally allied with the Viet Minh movement
 since March 1951 when the "United National Front of Vietnam, Cambodia,
 and Laos" was established.  In the past, military efforts of the
 Issaraks have been for the most part limited to sporadic guerrilla
 warfare, banditry, and arms smuggling across the Thai border.
 A closer degree of cooperation seems to have been achieved during
 the past year between the Viet Minh and the Cambodian and Laotian Issaraks.
 From 5,000 to 10,000 Viet Minh are reportedly with the Cambodian Issaraks
 and 5,000 with the Laotian Issaraks.  In October and November, 1952, a
 Laotian delegate accompanied the Viet Minh delegation to the Asian and
 Pacific Peace Conference in Peiping. In December delegates from both "Free
 Cambodia" and "Free Laos". participated in the World Peace Conference in
 Vienna.
 I.  Capabilities for Expansion and Action in the Near Future
 Despite the relatively low level of military industrial production
 within "DRV" areas and a reportedly increasing food shortage, the "DRV"
 could probably expand the present scope of its military activities to a
 limited extent without significantly increased support from Communist
 China or from other Orbit countries.
 If, as seems likely, the Issaraks receive greater material assistance
 and technical advice from the Viet Minh, they would be able to expand
 their numbers and extend their operations.
 A.  Repressive Capabilities of the Associated States and France
 French and Associated States policy toward Communism in Indochina
 is the military destruction of the Viet Minh armed forces and complete
 eradication of Communist activities and influence throughout the peninsula.
 No Communist parties, groupings, or organizations are allowed to
 exist or operate in the Associated States of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
 The overt circulation of Communist publications in Franco-Vietnamese
 controlled areas is prohibited and the possibility of Communist-oriented
 material appearing in the controlled press is negligible due to tight
 censorship exercised by both the French and the Associated States.  Severe
 repressive measures are taken against any individuals, groups, or organiza-
 tions believed operating under Communist. instructions or for Communist

 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 purposes.  Such repressive measures are expected to continue until
 -hostilities in Indochina have ceased and internal political stability
 is assured.  They are carried out by civilian security services of
 France and the Associated States, and insofar as the security of
 components of the French Union Armed Forces is concerned, by the
 military intelligence and counter-intelligence services of these forces.
 At present, the scope and effectiveness of repressive action of
 which the French and Associated States civilian and military security
 agencies are capable in Indochina cannot be rated better than fair.  By
 contrast, Communist subversive operations are believed to be, on the
 whole, vary effective.  Possibly the greatest asset of Communist under-
 ground and subversive organizations of all types lies in the generally
 apathetic attitude of the Vietnamese population as a whole toward the
 conflict which is raging in its territory.
 B.  Extent and Effectiveness of Communist Subversive Operations
 Communist subversive operations in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos
 fall into two major categories: those carried out by Viet Minh subversive
 teams and underground networks, and those carried out by clandestine
 Chinese Communist organizations..
 Viet Minh organizations operating in the French and Associated
 States-controlled zones of Indochina are for the most part responsible
 directly to the central "DRV" government, or its regional representatives.
 They perform three general types of assigned taskas propaganda;   litical,
 economic, and counter-intelligence;l and 'terrorism and sabotage.#
 The propaganda function is carried out by teams responsible to the
 Information Services of the central "DRV" government.  The total number
 or size of such teams is unknown,S but their effectiveness seems to have
 been considerable.  Espionage activities are carried out by organizations
 and units of unknown size believed to be attached to the regional Cong An
 (Public Security Service) of the Viet Minh, which is the latter's     rnal
 security organization.  Espionage agents reportedly are assigned
 specialized tasks, the most important of which is the infiltration of
 French and Associated States intelligence and security services. Terrorism
 and sabotage within the free zones is performed by the Dich Van which in-
 cludes Death Volunteer Brigades, apparently assigned to opera.e in specific
 regions.  The effectiveness of the,Dich Van is reportedly great; it has
 seriously disrupted. highway and rail~traff o, damaged industrial and
 Military espionage is oarr ell out by intelligence organizations
 responsible to the Directorate for Military Intelligence of the "DRV"
 Armed Forces General Staff.
 2.  Certain types of sabotage activities are carried out by organized
 guerrilla and commando units of the Armed Forces.
 5.  In 1951, ten such Information teams were reported to be operating
 in South Vietnam.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 military installations, and organized numerous terroristic acts in major
 urban centers, the most important of which was the assassination of a
 number of highly prominent French and Vietnamese civil and military
 personalities.  One of the most successful activities of Viet Minh sub-
 versive organizations has been the extortion of money from prominent
 French and Chinese as well as from Vietnamese business firms.  Many of
 these firms regularly pay large sums of "protection money" to Viet Minh
 agents in order to avoid bombing of their premises.
 The "DRV" benefits considerably by the intelligence activities
 carried out by Chinese Communist underground organizations in the non.
 Communist zones.  Since 1949, the Communist-direoted "Association for
 the Liberation of Overseas Chinese in Indochina" has organized various
 clandestine student, wen's and workers' organizations in Saigon-Cholon
 where approximately 80 percent of the total overseas Chinese population
 of some 800,000 is concentrated.  During 1952, the creation of a
 clandestine "United Action Committee of Democratic Sino-Vietnamese" was
 reported, also in Saigon-Cholon.  In North Vietnam, the "Society of New
 Chinese Democrats of Hanoi and Haiphong" reportedly intensified intelligence
 activities during 1952.  The size of these organizations is unknown although
 it is believed they have been fairly successful in gaining the sympathy
 of certain of the Chinese population, particularly among students and
 workers.  Specific underground activities which have been reported include
 extortions of money for the protection of relatives in China, the circula-
 tion of Communist tracts and publications believed to be for the most part
 procured in Hong gong, and the placement or pro-Communist instructors in
 Chinese schools.  In Cambodia, the Chinese Communist Party, whose head-
 quarters reportedly is located in Phnom-Penh, claims the sympathy of 60
 percent of the 300,000 overseas Chinese in that country.  No information
 is available concerning its activities or effectiveness.
 V.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 In "DRV" controlled areas, all workers in key industries are con-
 trolled by Communist elements, although the number of Party members in
 specific enterprises is unknown.  In the Associated States of Vietnam,
 Cambodia and Laos, the number of Communists in key industries, if any,
 is unknown.
 In "DRV" areas of Vietnam, the General Confederation of Labor,
 which is controlled by the communist Party, claimed "300,000 members" in
 1952.  The Confederation is composed of numerous affiliated trade unions
 organized at provincial levels throughout Vietnam.  It has been reported
 that although not all of its directors are Party members, those exercising
 any real authority are.  The Confederation has been affiliated with the
 World Federation of Trade Unions (wFTU) since the former's organization in
 1946'and has been represented at VPFTU Conferences since 1948.  In addition
 to the General Confederation of Labor, the Viet Minh reportedly organized
 a Trade Union Council in 1950 to embrace "intellectuals and civil servants."

 No further information is available concerning this Council.
 In the free areas of Vietnam, labor organizations were prohibited
 until the promulgation of the Labor Code on November 16, 1952.  The
 principal Vietnamese labor union, which until last November operated as
 an association, is the Christian Confederation Vietnamienne du Travail
 Chretien, reported to have 5,000 members.    num er of civil servants
 in both the French and Vietnamese administrations, belong to Force
 Ouvriere which has its headquarters in France.  Although pro  sions of
 Me  ew Labor Code in Vietnam do not extend to the overseas Chinese
 population, Chinese labor groups have for some time been loosely associated
 in a Federation of Chinese Mutual Aid Societies.  The 19 organizations
 comprising this Federation claim an aggregate membership of some 11,000.
 No information is available on Communist infiltration of, or in-
 fluence in, these labor unions in Franco-Vietnamese areas of Vietnam.
 However, the Chinese organizations are the most likely to have been
 infiltrated or influenced by Communists,
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND
 PROFESSIONAL O G  IZ TIONS
 In both the free and the Communist zones, the Lien Viet (National
 Unity) Front has developed an extensive and intricate netwozk of front
 organizations to enlist the support of the peasants and special interest
 groups for the "resistance against French aggression.'  The leaders of the
 front organizations are believed to be mostly well-indoctrinated and
 capable party cadres, many of whom work in more than one organization.
 What appear to be the most important front organizations are listed belows
 1.  The Union of Vietnamese Youth claims a membership of
 2,500,000 and has been affiliated with the World Federation
 of Democratic Youth since 1947.
 2.  The Union of Vietnamese Students and Pupils has been
 affiliated with the International Students Union since 1948.
 3.  The Union of Vietnamese Women claimed 3,000,000 members as
 of 1950.  It has been affiliated with the Woman's Inter-
 national Democratic Federation since 1945.
 4.  The Catholic Association for National Salvation.
 5.  The Association of Vietnamese Journalists has been affiliated
 with the World Federation of Journalists since 1950.
 6.  The Vietnam World Peace Committee is affiliated with the
 World Peace Council.

 7.  The Vietnamese Peasants Association for National Salvation.
 8.  The Sino-Vietnamese friendship Association.
 9.  The Soviet-Vietnamese Friendship Association?
 In addition to Viet Minh front organizations, the Chinese Communist
 Party has organized various youth, workers', women's and cultural under-
 ground front organizations.  These organizations are believed to be
 strongest in the Saigon-Cholon area of South Vietnam and in the Phnom-
 Penh region of Cambodia, where the majority of the overseas Chinese
 residents in Vietnam and Cambodia are located.
 Many, if not all, of the "Lien Viet front groups have effective
 underground organizations within -We areas under Franoo-Vietnamese con-
 trol.
 Little information is available concerning non-Communist social,
 cultural, or professional organizations which may have been infiltrated
 by Communists.
 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 Such infiltration is unquestionably a serious problem for the
 anti-Communist goverimmentsof the Associated States.  Although policy-
 making bodies of these states are believed to be to a large extent free
 from subversive Communist personnel and influences, the same can
 probably not be said with regard to the Armed Services, police and
 security services, and administrative cadres of the States.  Communist
 subversion is believed to have reached particularly serious proportions
 within Vietnam's National Army.  The Army Officer's Training School at
 Dalat has been reported strongly infiltrated by Communist elements, and
 certain Vietnamese troop companies in action in North Vietnam have proved
 of marked unreliability.  The Vietnamese, and even French, security
 services in North Vietnam are also believed penetrated to some extent by
 Communist elements.
 No reports of Communist penetration of government agencies and
 services in Cambodia and Laos have been received, although it is likely
 that a limited degree of infiltration may be considered to have occurred.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 In the "DRV"-controlled zones of Vietnam, leaders of public pro-
 paganda organizations are usually Party cadres.  Communist propaganda has
 undoubtedly reached nearly the entire population in these zones, chiefly
 through the effective organization of mass front organizations and compulsory
 study groups at provincial and village levels.
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 In free Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, no known Communists are in a
 position to influence public opinion.  There are probably a considerable
 number of concealed Viet Minh sympathizers or agents, however, in schools,
 journalistic, and literary groups.  The prohibition of Communist publica-
 tions, tight press censorship,and the extremely limited number of radio
 sets among the population in Franco-Vietnamese controlled areas have
 tended to insulate the population from Communist publications and broad-
 casts.  Nevertheless, it is likely that Communist influence has been
 spread fairly successfully through clandestine operations and through
 direct contact of many individuals with underground Viet Minh agents.
 IX.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST
 POLITICIE       S
 The most important non-Communist nationalist organizations and
 parties in Indochina are the Dai Viet Party, the Cao Dai politico-
 religious group, the Vietnam                                  a  ona iat Party (VN9DD). and the Catholics
 in Vietnam, and the Democratic Party in Cambodia.  Although information
 is generally lacking on their membership, these parties and groups are
 thought to embrace several hundred thousand members.  The extent of
 Communist influence in these organizations is unknown, but is not be-
 lieved to be large due to the strongly anti-Communist, although clearly
 pro-nationalist, sentiments of most of their leadership.
 Branches of the above-mentioned organizations are still in some
 instances allowed to operate in "DRV"-controlled zones, where the Catholics
 and some Caodaiats, for example, maintain social organizations.  However,
 the Communists have undoubtedly strongly infiltrated these branches and
 probably control them completely.  The same would be true for nominally
 non-Communist parties and organizations existing only in the "DRV$G Zones,
 such as the Vietnam Democratic Party and the Socialist Party, which the
 Communists continue to tolerate in order to bolster their nationalist
 pretensions.
 A.  Newspapers and Periodicals
 Listed below are the newspapers and periodicals known to have
 been published by the Viet Minh in 1951 or 1952.  Where known, the
 frequency of publication and the principal area of circulation are in-
 dicated.  These publications are also clandestinely distributed in

 E.  Radio
 The "DRV" controls the following broadcasting stations which have
 regularly scheduled programs beamed to Indochina and to Southeast Asiat
 1.   Voice of Vietnam is regarded as the official government
 station. It is reportedly located in the Vinh area.  News
 is broadcast daily to Indochina and Southeast Asia in French,
 English, Tonkinese, Thai, Mandarin, and Cantonese.
 2.   Voice of South Vietnam has tentatively been located north
 o     gon,      roe caste three programs daily of news and
 commentary in Cochinohinese and one in Mandarin.
 3.   Voice of Nambo is reputedly located in the Mekong Delta area.
 carries four programs of news and commentary daily, one
 each in Cochinchinese, French, Cantonese, and Cambodian.
 In Cambodia, the Voice of Issarak Cambodia is operated by the Issarak
 leader Son Ngoc Minh.  One-half hour of news and comment is broadcast daily
 in Cambodian.
 Radio Moscow broadcasts one hour daily in Tonkinese and occasionally
 in Coo  no  nese.  Radio Peking broadcasts one hour daily in Tonkinese,
 and twice daily for  5 to 35 minutes in Thai.  Reception of the Thai
 language program is reported to be poor.
 Considering the small number of radio receiving sets in the
 Associated States, it is likely that Communist radio broadcasts reach
 only a very limited audience and achieve only limited propaganda effects
 outside the Communist zones.  Within these zones, however, they are used
 as an extremely important,and probably effective, means of disseminating
 propaganda and official orders to the population.
 XI. FINANCIAL CONDITION
 The "DRV" authorities collect both direct and indirect taxes, many
 of them in kind, impose "duties" on goods entering Conmumist zones from
 the Franco-Vietnamese zones, and exact "voluntary"donations through various
 "emulation campaigns."     The amount of revenue thus collected is unknown,
 as is the size of any subsidies from international Communist organizations,
 donations or credits by Soviet or Satellite governments, or dues from
 party-controlled labor unions and fronts.  Nor is any information available
 on the amount of revenue collected through extortion of Vietnamese, French,
 and Chinese business firms in the non-Communist zones.
 XII.  SOVIET SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 There are no Soviet bloc diplomatic establishments, trade, or cultural
 missions in free Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos.

 Although the USSR, Communist China, and other satellite countries
 have recognized the "DRV", they have not established diplomatic missions
 there.  However, Communist China has sent various temporary military and
 economic missions to the Viet Minh.  During 1952 a 50-man Chinese
 cultural mission was reportedly sent to Thai Nguyen in North Vietnam
 for the purpose of establishing political liaison with the "DRV" govern-
 ment, and an economic mission is said to have been-not up also in North
 Vietnam to study economic resources. Current estimates place the number
 of more or less permanent Chinese Communist personnel-- technicians,
 instructors, military and political advisors -- with the Viet Minh at
 approximately 5,000.  All Chinese Communist Missions are surrounded by
 seoreoy.  It is believed that contact between Chinese personnel and
 natives is held to a minimum.
 A Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association and a Soviet-Vietnam
 Friendship Association were organised inside the "DRV" in early 1950.
 Both organizations are associated with the "Lien Viet Front" and have
 established branches throughout "DRV"-oontrolled areas of Vietnam.
 These organizations are reported to have clandestine branches in the
 free areas, particularly in the Saigon-Cholon district.  Propaganda
 committees areireported to have been established at the branch levels of
 both Associations.  In addition to carrying out regular propaganda
 activities, these associations are responsible for sponsoring celebrations
 of major Chinese Communist and Soviet holidays.  The Sino-Vietnamese
 Friendship Association has published a journal, China-Vietnam, since
 May 1950.
 XIII.  COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 While it is not known to what extent, if any, the Viet Minh move-
 ment may have been aided materially by international Communist organiza-
 tions, it has been granted a significant extent of moral support by
 such organizations through invitations to participate, often in a glorified
 role, in Communist international conferences.  In the past two years,
 delegates from the "DRV" and in two instances from "Free Cambodia" and
 "Free Laos" have attended the following international Communist meetingss

 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 The Communists in Indochina maintain closest international ties
 with Communist China, which recognized the "DRV" on January 18, 1950 and
 received the credentials of the first "DRV" Minister in April, 1951 (his
 status has now been raised to that of Ambassador), and with the USSR,
 which recognized the "DRV" on January 30, 1950, and received the
 credentials of a "DRV" ambassador in April 1952.  Close ties are_
 .also maintained, although much less prominently and for the most part
 covertly, with leaders of the French Communist Party.  Relations have
 also developed between the Viet Minh leadership and leaders of the
 Eastern European and Korean Communist regimes.
 The clear harmony between Viet Minh and international Communist
 policies leaves no doubt that close coordination with the international
 Communist movement prevails.  Proof that Communist China supplies high-
 level guidance to the Viet Minh leadership was recently received in the
 form of a Chinese Communist broadcast supplying the "DRV" government
 with the draft of a proposed address by Ho Chi Minh, written in China by
 the "DRV" Ambassador to that country.  It is likely that frequent
 consultations between China and the "DRV" take place, and that a certain
 amount of day-to-day guidance is provided by the temporary technical and
 military missions now present in the "DRV" areas.  It is also probable
 that the Viet Minh representative in Moscow sends home frequent guidances
 and reports.

 Efficiency of "DRV" contacts with the main Communist centers in
 Pei-p'ing and Moscow is presumably very good, since the French now
 control only one of the customary routes across the Chinese-Vietnamese
 border.  Radio contact between Communist China and the "DRV" is main-
 tained through stations BAL 6 and GMH in China, which relay broadcasts
 between the "DRV", China, and other Communist countries.  It is be-
 lieved that contacts maintained by the Indochinese Communists with
 France and with other Southeast Asian or Pacific countries are probably
 less efficient.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN INDONESIA:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 The major current goals of the Communist Party of Indonesia
 (PKI) are to gain general acceptance as a genuine nationalist party
 in Indonesia, to perfect the party organization and to consolidate
 control over a variety of front groups, including the largest of the
 labor federations in Indonesia.  In pursuing these aims the PKI has
 attempted to recoup such prestige as it lost, first, in the course of
 the Madiun uprising in September 1948 and, second, as a result of a
 series of arrests of Communist leaders by the Indonesian government
 in August 1951.
 Secondarily, the PKI attempts, especially through the activities
 of its front organizations, to cause Indonesia's "independent foreign
 policy' to be directed in such a way that ties with the Soviet bloc are
 strengthened at the expense of relations with the West.  Thus, the
 PKI advocates the exchange of diplomatic representatives with the USSR,
 non-cooperation with the UN embargo on shipments of strategic items to
 Communist China, increased trade with the Soviet bloc, and rejection
 of US economic. and military aid.
 The political climate in Indonesia, characterized by a lack of
 cohesive policy on the part of the major political parties and a
 general uncertainty as to the direction Indonesia will take in the
 immediate future both domestically and internationally, enhances the
 PKI's capability to pursue these several objectives concurrently.
 While present emphasis is on furthering the domestic political fortunes
 of the party,'particularly with the prospect of general elections in
 the next year, past experience suggests that should the requirements
 of international Communism demand it, a quick reversal might be
 effected, and international considerations be given precedence.
 At this stage it is not clear whether the PKI hopes to achieve
 its ultimate goal of direction of the Indonesian state through peace-
 ful constitutional means, involving subversion of non-Communist
 groups, or through eventual armed insurrection.  It is likely that
 the party's internal consolidation is pursued with both possibilities
 in view.
 In its attempt to gain popular acceptance, the PKI has been
 able to capitalize on existing anti-colonial sentiment and has taken
 a strong stand on a number of issues which also form a part of the
 programs of other political parties.  Thus, the PKI advocates abroga-
 tion of the Round Table Conference agreements with the Netherlands,
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4

 termination of the activity of the  Netherlands Military Mission,
 "restoration" of Western New Guinea (Irian) to Indonesian control,
 and nationalization of such foreign enterprises as the North Sumatra
 oil fields and the Bangka and Billiton tin mines.  These pronounced
 aims of the PKI,,shared as they are with other political groups,
 appear to be only means to enhance the national standing of the party.
 More general tactics directed toward this same end are the
 publicly announced support of the-present Wilopo government by the
 PKI and efforts apparently undertaken in various localities to form
 a series of "Representative Councils" under PKI leadership.  These
 united front tactics were justified in a party statement issued in
 explanation of the first Communist support rendered an Indonesian
 government since Madiun:
 The formation of.the Wilopo cabinet opened rather extensive
 possibilities to the PKI and the other people's organi-
 zations to work publicly; they need no longer perform under-
 ground activities as they did during the Sukiman...cabinet
 receding government7...This is the conclusion; in the
 present condition, tie PSI and the people have to choose one
 of these two; a democratic bourgeois government or a
 fascist bourgeois one....
 On several occasions since the end of the war, the PKI has
 stressed the desirability of a united front.  The PKI has also
 attempted in'the past year to seize the initiative in organizing
 celebrations of national holidays.
 At the same time that the PKI has endeavored to reestablish a
 patriotic reputation by positive action, it has refrained from
 outspoken opposition to the government's programs, thus trying to
 overcome a reputation for negativism.  In conformance with this policy,
 the PKl.was relatively restrained in recent Parliamentary debates
 critical of the leadership of the armed forces and the Ministry of
 Defense, and took care to deny complicity in the resulting anti-
 Parliament demonstrations.  In paying lip service to respect for
 democratic institutions the PKI has probably also been concerned for
 its political future should anti-Communist military leaders seize
 a larger measure of control.
 The PKI- has attempted to appeal to all social groups, and has
 had its greatest success in the organization of labor.  SOBSI
 (Sentral Organisasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia), the PKI-contfolled
 trade union-n a e~ion, dominates the Indonesian labor movement and
 is an affiliate of WFTU.  SOBSI's potential for disruptive activity
 was demonstrated in 1950 when it spearheaded a campaign of widespread

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 strikes in vital industries throughout Indonesia.  Harbor operations,
 transportation, petroleum and some estate rubber production were
 brought to a virtual standstill.  Since that time, the Indonesian
 government has restricted labor activity through a series of committees
 to which labor disputes are to be referred for compulsory settlement.
 Although SOBSI organizations have refrained from disruptive activity
 in the past several months in conformity to the PKI program of
 cooperation with the government, a potential for renewed agitation
 exists.  Among the more important other PKI front organizations in
 Indonesia are women's, youth, students, and peasants organizations,
 the People's Cultural League and the Indonesian Committee for World
 Peace.
 These groups echo the PKI program and propaganda in parlia-
 ment, communicate Communist propaganda to mass groups, attempt to
 enlist the support of non-Communist groups for Communist causes, and
 participate in national conferences and international meetings of
 Communist front organizations.  SOBSI and two peasant organizations
 are represented in the Indonesian parliament.  Although there is no
 separate Chinese Communist Party organization in Indonesia, many of
 the same purposes are accomplished within the Chinese community by a
 separate series of front organizations.
 In addition to controlling completely the activities of the
 above organizations, clearly recognizable as Communist front groups,
 PKI members attempt to infiltrate other mass organizations.  An
 article published in the official PKI organ in February 1951 on "The
 Role of the PKI and Mass Organizations" statess
 "Communists who are assigned to join organizations, such as
 labor unions which are under the leadership of Trotskyites
 or Social Democrats, are not to leave such organizations,
 for-that would mean that we were allowing these masses to
 continue under the leadership of those who are really
 enemies of the people.... Therefore, we Communists may not
 refuse to work in a mass organization, no matter how
 reactionary it is."
 Communist efforts are also made to infiltrate ministries of
 the government, the police and military forces.  Apart from the
 known presence of Communists in the Ministries of Labor and
 Information, there is little evidence to indicate the degree of
 success enjoyed by the PKI to date in attaining this objective.
 Since the abortive Madiun rebellion in 1948, the PKI has, in
 general, refrained from violent activity.  Nevertheless, the party
 controls several small armed bands and is believed to continue
 attempts to infiltrate other dissident organizations.

 The PKI in the course of its past history was often divided in
 its leadership and evidenced the same lack of cohesion and direction
 that characterized most other Indonesian political groups.  Today, fol-
 lowing the injection of considerable new blood into the party, there is
 every evidence that the PKI adheres closely to policy as transmitted
 through international Communist channels.  Liaison is believed to be
 effected through the Chinese Communist Embassy and at international
 Communist meetings.  Should the dictates of international Comnmmism
 so demand, the PKI today would probably not hesitate to reverse its
 tactics, even at the risk of weakening seriously its domestic position.
 III.  CAPABILITIES
 The PHI today. is better organized and better led than at amy time
 in its past history. The party appears to be enjoying a considerable
 degree of success as a result of its policy of cooperation with the
 Indonesian government and its espousal of generally popular causes.  As
 long as it adheres to this policy of united.front tactics its potential
 for expanding membership and enhancing its following would appear great.
 At the same time, the fact that the other major political parties advocate
 much the same program and are not faced with the PKI's constant problem
 of establishing' its identity as an indigenous party,. militates against
 the party's becoming so strong that it might participate in an Indonesian
 government,
 One major purpose of the party's united front tactics has been to
 assure that it will not lose its present parliamentary representation
 when general elections are held.  It is not possible to forecast election
 results at this time, but judging from the Indian experience in conduct-
 ing elections with a largely illiterate electorate, the organization of
 the PHI, particularly among front organizations, will probably assure it
 representation disproportionate to its real popular support.
 As a vehicle for gaining sympathy for international Commnmist
 causes, the PKI is limited in its success among politically articulate
 Indonesians by a general awareness of the nature of.Cism and the
 role played by front organizations, and by suspicion of the motives of
 advocates of either side in the cold war.  The party's appeal among the
 masses, in turn, suffers from a lack of awareness on.the part of most
 Indonesians of all but immediately pressing local problems.  Nevertheless,
 PKI propaganda as delivered through the several front organizations
 capitalizes on the strongly nationalist sentiment of the people.  Thus
 it is probable that the people as a whole are more susceptible to Communist
 propaganda influence than the more politically sophisticated leadership
 groups.

 It-is unlikely that the PEI-will in the foreseeable future be
 able to wage organized warfare against the Indonesian state, but it
 may be expected that all opportunities will be developed to subvert
 dissident groups with an eye toward future eventualities.  The party
 does continue to possess the capability of disrupting economic life
 through the activities of the labor unions it controls, but such
 activity would run counter to the law and might jeopardize the
 reputation for Cooperation and concern for the natioial iriterOst
 that the party has been nurturing so Carefully.

 CCHMUNISM IN INDONESIA:  ASSETS
 I.  NU)IERICAL STRENGTH
 Estimates of Indonesia Commnmist Party (PKI) strength vary from
 30,000-100,000 but no details are available.  No separate Chinese: Com
 munist Party organization. is known to exist in Indonesia, although the.
 Chinese oomaunity, as noted below, possesses its own mass front organi
 zations.  The PKI is strongest in Java and Sumatra and party activity
 seems best organized in the major cities, but little information is
 available concerning regional organization.
 Much of the leadership and probably a large portion of party
 membership are middle class intellectuals, but the bulk of party sym-
 pathizers are unskilled agricultural and industrial laborers and farmers.
 A majority of the party leaders have been educated or trained abroad, and
 Samaun, one of the PKI'S founders, is in Moscow where he is credited with
 playing a major role in Soviet planning for Indonesia.  Other Indonesian
 Comnnuiists are known to be in Prague, Pei ping and Amsterdam.
 Beset by undistinguished and ineffective leadership throughout
 most of its history of three decades, the PKI in the postwar period has
 experienced a new vigorous direction on the part of both the overt Central
 Committee and its underground directorate.  Party leadership today may be
 divided between a small group of older prewar members and a majority group
 of more recent leaders -- averaging.30-35 years in age -- who have ac-
 knowledged adherence to the party or front organizations only in the post-
 war period.
 While the government's security action of August 1951 against the
 Communists increased pressure on the party and for a time restricted its
 freedom of action, the most prominent and important leaders of the PKI
 escaped capture at the time, and many lesser lights have since been re-
 leased.  There has been no evidence of dissension within party ranks in
 the past two years, and the present leadership appears prepared to under-
 take whatever action party strategy demands.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 No general elections have been held in Indonesia to date.  The PKI
 occupies 15 seats (7 percent) out of 220 in the provisional Parliament.
 If satellite parties and fellow travellers are included, a total of 40
 seats (19 percent) are controlled by the PKI.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 Current PKI policy is to refrain from violent activity and to
 enhance its popular support through ostensible cooperation with the
 government and other political parties.  Past experience in the post-
 war period, however, indicates that the party will not hesitate to en-
 gage in violent action when strategy so demands.
 In September 190 during negotiations between the Republic and
 the Netherlands, the PKI undertook an armed uprising at Madiun in
 Republican held territory.  Party strategy at that time was apparently
 aimed at precipitating a renewal of Dutch military action against the
 Republic in the course of which the PKI hoped to seize leadership of
 the Indonesian resistance.  Premature action on the part of some of the
 rebelling units and prompt counteraction on the part of the Republic
 resulted in the suppression of the Communists after considerable loss
 of life.  In August 1951, the Communists led-a raid on Tandjung.Priok, port
 area of Djakarta, in order to test the party's ability to execute this
 type of maneuver as well as the government's-capability of coping with
 disruptive activity.  It was this action that hastened the Indonesian
 Govermment's decision to effect a series of security sweeps, in the course
 of which many prominent' Communists and fellow-travellers were arrested.
 The Indonesian Communists are believed to have infiltrated dis-
 sident organizations currently engaged in armed insurrection and may
 possess small armed bands of their own, but reliable information on this.
 subject is lacking.  Judging from their conduct of and participation in
 non-violent demonstrations, Party members presumably would be available
 in major cities for conducting violent demonstrations.' Although the PKI
 probably has an organization for violent action and the quality of leader-
 ship is greatly improved over 191+8, the success of any large-scale insur-
 rection would probably depend on complete Conn mist subversion of existing
 dissident groups or units of the armed forces.  PKI control of most or-
 ganized labor, the largest farmers' organizations and important youth groups
 might provide considerable backing for. whatever violent action the Party
 might undertake.                                          -
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COWUNISIK
 The PKI enjoys the same freedom as other Indonesian political
 parties, but the Indonesian Goverment limits the extent to-which the
 PKI and its allied organizations can engage in propaganda attacks on
 friendly states and the degree to which it may express its international
 ties.   Thus, pictures of international Communist leaders are occasionally
 prohibited at Communist rallies, and propaganda films of a flagrant- nature
 are banned.  In August 1951 the Government, fearing another attempted
 coup, arrested mmaerous outstanding Commmists and fellow travellers.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 The Party's past experience with the ability of the Indonesian
 Government to curtail overt activity has presumably led it to form an
 underground organization.  However, no details are known regarding the
 size or efficiency of such an organization.  An elaborate array of front
 organizations and the probable existence of numerous undercover party
 members would seemingly enable the PKI to maintain its structural or-
 ganization and engage in limited activity in the face of Government re-
 pression of the Party proper.
 V.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 The number of Commmnists in key industries is not known but is
 appreciable in view of the strength of PKI dominated unions.
 SOBSI (Sentral Organisasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia), the trade
 union branch of the PKI, dominates the Indonesian labor movement and is
 an affiliate of the WFTU.  It is represented in the Provisional Parlia-
 ment, where it holds four seats.  SOBSI claims three million members,
 although its actual membership is estimated at about 800,000.  Its largest
 affiliate is SARBUPRI, a federation of estate workers unions which cllma
 a membership of one million as against an estimated actual membership of
 350,000.  Other important SOBSI affiliates exist among ship, dock, rail-
 road, transport, sugar, and oil workers.
 SOBSI's potential for disruptive activities was demonstrated in
 1950 when it spearheaded a campaign of widespread strikes in vital in-
 dustries throughout Indonesia.  Harbor operations, transportation, petroleum
 and some estate rubber production were all brought to a virtual standstill.
 Because of the threat to security, strikes were banned by local military
 commanders in several provinces in late 1950, followed by a nationwide ban
 in February 1951.  In October of the same year the ban was replaced by a
 comprehensive decree calling for a three-week cooling-off period and es-
 tablishing committees of government officials for the compulsory settlement
 of disputes where voluntary mediation failed.  A series of disruptive har-
 bor strikes in March and April 1952 were settled by committee action.  A
 strike of sugar estate workers in mid-1952 was called off only after the
 government threatened.to arrest strike leaders.  For the last several months
 there have been no strikes by SOBSI organizations, apparently in response
 to the PKI's avowed policy of cooperation with the government.
 Attempts by leaders of various non-Communist parties, particularly
 the Socialist, Labor and Masiumi parties, to organize non-Communist unions
 capable of challenging SOBSI's domination of labor have been largely unr-
 successful.  The lack of capable union organizers and funds and the desire
 of various party leaders to bolster their own political strength have thus
 far prevented the formation of a lasting united non-Communist federation
 embracing all non-Communist labor groups.

 VI.  CCH4UNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL. AND
 PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 A. Front Organisations
 The most important Communist front organizations are described
 briefly below:
 1.  Ikatan Pemuda Peladiar Indonesia (IPPI), Indonesian Youth and
 Students Union.  This group claims a membership of 50,000 to
 75,000, and is second in its field only to the Moslem youth
 organization.  It is especially influential in the secondary
 schools and is affiliated with the international Students Union.
 2.  Pemuda Rakiat, People's Youth.  With an estimated membership of
 30#000 this is the most active politically of the numerous
 Indonesian youth groups.  Pew.7da Rakjat is affiliated with the
 World Federation of Democratic Youth.
 Gerakan Wanita Indonesia'Sedar (GERWIS), Enlightened Indonesian
 Women's Movement.  CERWIS does not possess nearly as extensive
 an organization as the older. women's organizations, although it
 is the most active politically.  To date it has been unable to
 influence the national Congress of Indonesian Women to affiliate
 with Women's International Democratic Federation, of which GEIMIS
 is a member.
 ~.  Barisan Tani Indonesia (BTI), Indonesian Farmers Corps.  This
 group is strongest in Central Java and is represented in
 Parliament.
 Rukun Tani Indonesia (RTI), Indonesian Farmers Union.  RTI,
 active in West Java and South Sumatra, and BTI are the two
 most powerful Indonesian farmers organizations.  Plans are in
 the offing for merger of the two groups.
 Indonesian Committee for World Peace.  This organization has
 branches in major cities and appeals to many non-Communist in-
 tellectuals.
 7.     Lembaga Kebudaiaan Rakiat (IEKRA), People's Cultural League.
 Apparently the successor to the Chinese-Indonesian Cultural
 league,. this group also has branches in major cities.
 The above groups all serve as instruments for ooammmicating Communist
 propaganda to mass groups, lend their names to the support of Communist
 causes, attempt to enlist the support of non-Communist groups for Communist

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 causes, and participate on behalf of Indonesian women, youth, etc., as
 the case may be, at international 'Communist conferences.
 Within the Chinese community the most important Communist organiza-
 tion appears to be the Min h She (People's Life Society), incorporating
 a great many women's, youth, educational, professional and sports associa-
 tions.                     Little detailed information is available concerning its activities,
 but it appears to be the most active organization today among the overseas
 Chinese community.  When the Chinese Communist Ambassador arrived in Indonesia
 he was greeted by representatives of 180 Chinese associations, which may
 serve as an indication of the complexity of the organization of the Chinese
 community in Indonesia.
 In addition to the above group, perhaps a majority of the Overseas
 Chinese Associations (      Lug       Hui), which have existed since the
 prewar period organized on a regional basis, have declared their support
 for the Communist cause.   Many of these have been brought together in a
 series of Communist-dominated United Overseas Chinese General Associations.
 The Chinese schools are a further vehicle for transmitting Communist
 propaganda,, and a large number of these are known to be Communist-dominated.
 A majority of Chinese labor unions are believed to be affiliated with SOBSI,
 the overall Indonesian Communist labor organization.  In North Sumatra, at
 least, the Chinese Communist Farmers Association is a member of the broad
 farmers front dominated by the Indonesian Communists.
 Few details are available concerning the operations, leadership or
 membership of this array of organizations.  Chinese Communist leadership
 has been active in seizing control of a good many associations whose members
 were apathetic to the political implications of Commmist efforts.  In some
 cases comparable non-Communist organizations exist, generally organized by
 the K[f, but in general, the Comumanist-dominated organizations are predominant
 in the overseas Chinese community.
 B.  Infiltration of Non-Communist Organizations
 The fact.that many of the non-Communist mass organizations in
 Indonesia are inclined to the left and have programs that bear a striking
 similarity to those under Communist discipline makes it difficult to dis-
 tinguish all organizations that might properly be included in this category.
 It seems probable that the PKI attempts to infiltrate all such organizations.
 An article in the official organ of the PKI states, "It is the fundamental
 duty of the Communists to give gradual training to all mass organizations
 and to supply them with progressive leadership."  This publication also
 declares, "Every Communist must work hard to unite all kinds of mass or-
 ganizations into one mass organization."  It appears to be the PKI'ob
 jective gradually to merge infiltrated organizations into larger Communist-
 dominated front groups.
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 It is doubtful whether any of the non-Communist mass organizations
 consciously support Communist programs, but there is often considerable
 agreement between the Communist and non-Communist groups.  The distinction
 between the two groups is often only in the degree of eagerness to take
 sides in international issues and willingness to affiliate with inter-
 national Commiunist front organizations.
 VII.  Ct7WUNIST INFILTRATION INTO COVERNMFNT
 A number of Commmnists are known to hold positions in the Ministry
 of Labor and Information and in their regional offices.  The total number
 of Communists and Communist sympathizers in these offices is not known,
 but the ratio to total personnel is believed to be small.  The arrests of
 August 1951 ferreted out a number of Communists and Communist sympathizers
 in the Ministry of Labor.
 Dialan Baru (The New Road), often cited as a guide for PEI members,
 declares, "The armed forces must receive special attention as the most im-
 portant instrument of national power.  Armed forces cadres and personnel
 must be given special attention in line with their role as the most important
 instrument for the defense of the National Revolution."  Although it.is.as-
 sumed that the PKI has attempted to infiltrate units of the armed forces,
 little evidence exists to indicate success to date.  There are no known
 Communists or Communist sympathizers at the top levels of the armed forces.
 The same publication further states, "The police and associated personnel
 must learn the meaning of the National Revolution....  The police must be
 led by progressive cadres."  Nevertheless, the mobile brigade,-national
 police force, is regarded as the most reliable of the Indonesian government
 security forces and there is no evidence of Communist success at subversion,
 VIII.  COM1J  ST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 ALtar , the national news agency is believed to be influenced by
 either Partai Murba, a so-called "nationalist Communist" party, or by the
 PKI,1 and a number of newspapers, avowedly independent, are believed to be
 operated by PKI members or sympathizers.  Nevertheless, the fact that the
 Communists advocate many of the same issues that form part of the
 programs of major non-Communist parties and Con mmist publications share many opinions
 with the non-Communist majority of the press makes it difficult to assess
 Communist influence on public opinion formation.  It would seem that the
 influence exerted by the Communists on public opinion media is limited and
 of much less importance than the impact on public opinion of the activities
 of Communist-dominated front organizations.
 1.  Adam Malik, head of Antares is thought to be a member of Partai Murba, but
 the possibility exists that Murba itself is today a PKI front.  In any
 case, attitudes of the two parties on most issues are similar,.

 IX.  CC  UNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 Past experience indicates that attempts at infiltrating all political
 parties are probably made by the PKI.  In.1948, several leading members of
 the Socialist and Labor parties joined the PKI in the Madiun rebellion pro-
 claiming themselves to have been Communists for a number of years.  Little
 concrete information is available, however, to support the above assumption.
 Partai Mur_gb , which describes itself as "nationalist-Communist," has
 a program that differs from that of the PKI only in refusing to subscribe
 to a world Communist order.  P~ Murba cannot be described as Titoist or
 Trotskyist, since it acknowledges a position of world leadership for the
 USSR.        has four seats in Parliament, and has its own series of labor
 unions and front organizations.  Failure of the PKI strongly to attack Murrba
 suggests the possibility that since the death of its founder, Tan Ma]aka.,
 who strongly opposed the PKI, the party may have been infiltrated by PKI
 members.
 X.  C 4IUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 Newspapers and Periodicals
 B       Herah (.Red Star) is the official publication of the PKI.
 Formerly restricted to Party members B_t nn Herah is now available to
 the general public, but its circulation is not Down.  The- most important
 of the other Communist newspapers is Sin Po, with a Chinese edition of
 about 20,000 circulation and an Indonesian edition of about 15,000 cir-
 culation.  There are seven other known communist dailies, none of which
 is believed to have a large circulation.  In addition, a large number of
 Communist or pri.st books and pamphlets are sold at virtually all
 bookstores in Indonesia.
 B.  Publishing Houses
 B       Merah and all important PKI propaganda publications, in.-
 cluding translations of foreign Communist writings, now are published by
 the. Jaiasan Pembaruan (Modern Institute) in Djakarta, a corporation in
 which the PKI is reported to have a financial interest.  Jaiasan Pembaruan
 may have replaced the translating committee  Komisi Penterdjemah) formed.
 in March 1951 by members of the Politburo.   This committee was charged
 with translating books and essays on Communist theory such as Lenin's
 State. and Revolution, and Liu Shao-ch'i'c On the Party. Three other
 known Communist publishing houses are the "Widjaja" publishing house
 and the Life Press Publishing Company, both in Djakarta, and the.Hwang...
 Lung (Yellow Dragon) Publishing Company in Makassar.
 C.  Ccumunist Propaganda from Abroad
 The Soviet magazine Nej Times and the Soviet novel Star, both in
 English, have been seen on sale in Medan, Sumatra.  Other specific foreign

 Communist publications available in Indonesia are not known., but trans].a-
 tion of Soviet writings is a constant part of PKI propaganda efforts, and
 a great number of Chinese Communist publications, including textbooks, are
 distributed among both the Chinese and Indonesian comumities.
 The Soviet radio devotes one hour a day and Pei ping radio a half
 hour. daily to broadcasts in Indonesian. The effectiveness of these programs,
 which is difficult to judge, is limited by the fact that only-about 230,000
 radio sets are registered in Indonesia.                                   --
 II.  FINANCIAL CONDITI
 Party dues are collected monthly on a sliding scale in proportion
 to income, but do not exceed 1- percent of gross income.  Details concern-
 ing other sources of Party revenues, including possible subsidies from
 abroad are not known.  The PKI has had some difficulty in the past in
 financing its publications, but organizational capabilities of the party
 do not seem to have been hampered by want of funds.  Demonstrations or-
 ganized by the PSI and its affiliates appear well-supplied with posters,
 etc.  It does not appear that the party will suffer in the foreseeable;
 future from financial difficulties.
 XII.  SOVIET_SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 Neither the USSR nor the East European satellites maintain diplo
 matic missions in Indonesia.  There is a Taos representative and a Czech
 consul-general in Djakarta, however, both of whom are reported to be en-
 gaged in political activity.
 Commmist China has an embassy in Djakarta and consulates at
 Surabaya, Makassar, Medan, Banjermasin, and Djogjakarta.  The.embassy
 staff is reported limited to fifteen persons, and in July 1951 the Indonesian
 government refused the entry of sixteen additional members.  No details are
 available concerning the consulate staffs.
 In 1951 the Chinese Communist representatives were active in or-
 ganizing demonstrations on the part of the Chinese community.  The poor
 reception accorded this activity by many Indonesians has caused greater
 restraint to be exercised so that the band of the Chinese Communist embassy
 in such affairs in the past year has not been obvious.
 There is no Soviet-Indonesian Friendship Association, and the
 Chinese-Indonesian Friendship Association appears to have been superseded
 by the People's Cultural League, the size of which is not known.

 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NE MORK
 Close relations are maintained by the PKI with the Communist
 parties in the USSRR, the Netherlands, and Commnuiiat China.  Leaders of
 the PKI have received training in these three countries, and, as noted
 above, Samaun, one of the founders of the PKI is in Moscow.
 Perhaps the most striking example of compliance with international
 Communist directives took place in 1948.  Indonesian delegates to the
 Congress of the Communist Party of India and the Calcutta Youth Congress
 held early that year reported home the adoption of a policy of armed in-
 surrection.  In September, following also the return of Muso, Samaun'a
 lieutenant, from Moscow, the PKI instigated the Madiun rebellion.
 A more recent example of direction from abroad was the criticism
 of SOBSI by WFTU representatives at the 1952 SOBSI national congress for
 not maintaining proper liaison with WFTU international headquarters and

 place at such meetings, it is believed that the Chinese Communist embassy
 is used as a channel of communication for the PKI.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 CCUMUNISM IN MALAYA:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 Communist guerrillas, 95 percent of whom are Malayan Chinese,
 have been carrying out hit-and-run warfare against the British and
 their supporters in the Federation of Malaya since mid-1948, when
 the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and its fronts and labor organiza-
 tions were banned.  Documents captured near the beginning of the
 guerrilla campaign'indicated that the objective of the MCP was to
 drive the British out of Malaya.  This was to be accomplished in
 three successive phases by:
 1)  disrupting the economy
 2)  setting up governments in "liberated" areas
 3)  joining up liberated areas.
 The inability-of the party to achieve its first goal --
 disruption of the economy -- in the first three years of the campaign
 has according to other, more recent, captured documents, brought
 about a revision of party policy from one of indiscriminate and un-
 bridled terrorist activity to an attempt to guide guerrilla warfare
 away from activities harmful to the interests of workers and peasants
 and toward military targets.  This move, combined with others, is
 calculated to broaden the base of party support.
 MCP recognition of the necessity for this changed course of
 action has aroused some speculation, unsupported by any evidence,
 that the party, in admitting this initial failure, may also have
 reached the conclusion that it is incapable of achieving its ultimate
 objective through its-own efforts, but must preserve itself as a
 guerrilla force until an outside power can undertake the "liberation"
 of Malaya.
 During the past six months it has become increasingly apparent
 from the lessened number and changed character of terrorist incidents
 that the MCP, probably in response to progressively more effective
 pressure by British Security Forces, has put into effect its new
 strategic policies.  The MCP's aim -- to gain the support of laborers
 and peasants -- has required modification, rather than abandonment,
 of guerrilla warfare tactics.  A party directive indicates that
 military and police targets may be attacked, but that the destruction
 of dwellings and public utilities, and the seizure of food without
 compensation is to be discontinued.  The destruction of mine and
 estate property is also prohibited, since it affects the livelihood
 of laborers.  Urban organizations, particularly labor unions, are to
 be infiltrated or, if necessary, secret unions formed.

 The MCP's chief guerrilla organization, the Malayan Races
 Liberation Army (MRLA) is estimated to have from 3,000 to 5,000
 members.  Grouped into twelve regiments, the MRLA.usually utilizes
 the company or the platoon as its operating unit.  The MRLA is
 supported by the MIN YUEN, or Peoples Movement, which is
 responsible for furnishing supplies, intelligence, and recruits to
 the MRLA. Rather than a single organization, the MIN YUEN  is a
 collection of organizations controlled by party executives for work
 among the masses.  Among the MIN YUEN organizations are groups of
 armed men-numbering about 4,000, cooperating closely with the
 MRLA.  It is through MIN YUEN organizations that intelligence is
 secured, men recruited, and funds obtained.  While some financial
 support comes from regular contributions by members'of MIN YUEN
 organizations., the bulk of the funds collected apparently comes
 from the "protection" money paid by Chinese businessmen, estate
 owners, and tin mine operators.  The MIN YUEN probably numbers
 upwards of 10,000 members.
 MCP activity capitalizes on anti-British sentiment and, to
 some extent, the economic rivalry between the Malayan Chinese and
 the paramount British economic group.  Since 1949 the nationalist
 character of the party has been stressed in propaganda., but there
 is little indication that this line has been effective.
 Despite the receipt of one small shipment of arms from
 Thailand, there is no evidence that the MCP regularly receives
 material aid from outside Malaya.  There is reason to believe,
 however, that some trained leaders have been infiltrated from
 China.  Propaganda circulated covertly by the party'follows the
 lead of Peiping and Moscow broadcasts for the most part and it
 is likely that these broadcasts serve as one of the chief means
 of liaison between the MCP and both these Communist centers.
 Malaya is not characterized by the existence of either a
 strong unified nationalist movement or depressed economic condi-
 tions that could be exploited by the Communists.  The guerrillas
 do not have widespread public sympathy, and the movement appears
 to be inspired by a hard core of Communists acting in response to
 the policies of international Communism.  The party has sustained
 itself largely by intimidation of the Malayan Chinese community.
 The recent change in-the MCP's strategic policy away from wide-
 spread terroristic activity and the intimidation of peasants and
 laborers is in part at least an admission of the failure of this
 course of action.  The effectiveness of new emphasis on gaining
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 the support of peasants and. laborers, conducting a more selective
 terrorist campaign, and infiltrating labor unions and other
 organizations, cannot yet be evaluated.
 Over the past four years the British, utilizing military
 political, psychological, and socio-economic measures, have
 'successfully contained but have failed to suppress the Communists.
 In addition-to the difficulties of guerrilla warfare in the jungle,
 the failure of the Malayan Chinese to cooperate in the anti-guerrilla
 campaign, political apathy, and the lack of a Malayan national
 consciousness have contributed to the inability of the British to
 eradicate the guerrillas.
 The diversity of Malaya's population has prevented the
 development of a national consciousness and hampered British attempts
 to arouse an anti-Coimnunist spirit based on nationalism.  The
 largest elements of the population, the Malays (49 percent) and the
 Chinese (38 percent) form separate, mutually antagonistic communi-
 ties.                                Major causes of the friction are the Malay fear of eventual
 domination by the energetic Chinese whom they regard as alien, and
 the Chinese resentment of the favored position traditionally accord-
 ed the Malays by the British.
 In contrast with the non-committal attitude of the Chinese
 toward the present struggle, the Malays support the British,
 forming the bulk of the police and staffing most of the lower
 echelon administrative posts.  Traditionally oriented toward China
 as the Motherland, the Malayan Chinese have sought to preserve
 Chinese culture through their schools and their family life.
 Loyalty to the Motherland is basically cultural rather than political,
 however, and the majority of Malayan Chinese are committed neither
 to the Communist regime in Peiping nor to the Nationalists in
 Taipei.  Apart from a few leaders, political apathy has extended to
 Malayan affairs, the primary Malayan Chinese interest in Malaya being
 .commercial.  The Malayan Chinese attitude is also due to the
 emergence of a strong government in China to which the overseas
 Chinese feel that they may eventually be able to look for protection
 of their interests; to the fact that the majority of the Communist
 guerrillas are Chinese; and to the British failure to demonstrate
 clearly the ability to eradicate the guerrillas.  Moreover, the
 Chinese fear local reprisals should they aid the British, or the
 punishment of their relatives or the confiscation of their property
 in China should they openly support an anti-Communist drive.
 The new Communist course of action is likely to pose new
 problems to the British, particularly since the infiltration of
 labor unions is to be attempted.  Nevertheless, it is likely that
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4

 the British, now organized more effectively and imbued with better
 morale under the leadership of Gen. Sir Gerald Templer, will
 continue as during the past year to make slow progress against the
 guerrillas.  It is unlikely, however, that the British will be
 able to wipe out the guerrillas completely; at the same time it is
 improbable that the guerrillas, without outside aid, can make the
 British position untenable.  The eventual outcome of Malaya's
 Communist problem is probably to a large extent dependent upon
 events outside Malaya.

 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 Although more than l5,000 persons, or about 0.3 percent of
 Malaya's population, are controlled or strongly influenced by Communism,
 the MCP itself is estimated to have only 3,000 to 6,000 members drawn
 almost wholly from the'peasant and laborer class of the Malayan Chinese
 community.  Some 600 to 800 members are estimated to constitute the "hard
 core" of the party and to have been active in the MCP for more than ten
 years.  During World War II, these hard core members took part in the
 British-aided guerrilla organization known as the Malayan People's Anti-
 Japanese Army.  Probably not more than 1,000 members have been associated
 with the party for more than five years.
 The actual leaders of the MCP are virtually unknown, but from the
 fact of continued guerrilla resistance over the past four years and from
 the statements of surrendered guerrillas it would appear that these
 leaders are determined.,-aggressive., well-trained men.  Despite the strong
 leadership of the party, however, some of the rank and file members have
 become discouraged at the continual hardships of life in the jungle and
 have surrendered to British Security Forces.  Nevertheless, few of those
 surrendering have been associated with the movement for a long period,
 and it is probable that the hard core of the party has remained virtually
 intact for the past four years.

 II. ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 No general elections have been held in the Federation of Malaya.
 The MCP, banned in mid-1948, has, of course, entered no candidates in the
 few municipal elections. that have been held.
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 Communist forces are estimated to consist of 3,000 to 5,000
 members of the Malayan Races Liberation Party (MRLA) and approximately
 4,000 armed members of MIN YUEN organizations.  Despite guerrilla
 casualties in surrendered, captured and killed, amounting to half the
 estimated Communist force over the past four years, total guerrilla
 strength continues to be set at a constant level by British sources
 because of steady recruitment by the guerrillas.  Lack of arms apparently
 prevents any expansion of guerrilla forces.
 All Communist support organizations, necessarily covert, are
 blanketed into the MIN YUEN or People's Movement. It is from these
 organizations that the MRLA receives recruits, funds, food, and

 -6-
 information.  The MIN YUEN has a strength estimated at 10,000 or more.
 MIN YUEN organizations and their functions are: .
 1.  Self Protection Units -- to supply food
 2.  Protection Corps -- to sabotage and ambush
 3.  Armed Work Force -- to propagandize and organize
 4.  District Unit -- to propagandize and organize
 5.  Suicide Squad --- to assassinate reactionary leaders
 6.  Labor Protection Corps -- to lead strikes, to sabotage,
 to propagandize
 7.  Reserve Corps -- to train executives
 8.  Executive Committee of the Masses -- to gather information
 and food
 9.  Sympathizers Cells -- to train prospective party members,
 to gather funds and food, and to act as couriers.
 The guerrillas have employed hit-and-run tactics against police
 stations and villages, ambushed patrols, sabotaged transportation and
 public utilities, and attacked rubber estates and mines.  Newly adopted
 tactics will, according to a captured directive, confine such attacks
 to military and police targets, or to the property of "reactionary
 capitalists."  In the past, the guerrillas have received support because
 of their ability to intimidate the rural and to some extent the urban
 populations.  However, the recent resettlement of some 400,000 Chinese
 "squatters," who were living on the fringe of the jungle, into controlled
 and protected "new villages" has removed one major source of guerrilla
 support.  Henceforth, the guerrillas must rely more upon Malay villagers,
 estate labor, and urban dwellers.  Whether the newly adopted policy of
 paying for, rather than simply requisitioning food, and of safeguarding
 the interests of peasants and laborers will prove effective in winning
 voluntary support remains to be seen.
 The guerrillas have been unsuccessful in achieving the economic
 disruption of Malaya, but their tactics have nevertheless affected
 adversely the economies of both Malaya and the United Kingdom. Prospecting,
 on which the future of the tin industry in part depends, has been prevented
 for the past four years.. Rubber trees have been slashed, and a large-
 scale program of replanting made impossible.  Nevertheless, current
 production has not been seriously affected, and it will probably be a
 number of years before Malayan production feels the full affect of the
 present situation.

 The expense of the anti-guerrilla campaign to the Federation
 has prevented the undertaking of needed economic development projects,
 while the expense of maintaining troops in Malaya and of contributing
 to extraordinary expenses of local government has constituted a
 financial drain on the United Kingdom.
 Guerrilla warfare has hampered the rapid achievement of political
 innovations desired by the populace and sponsored by the government as a
 means of encouraging Malayan nationalism as an anti-Communist force.
 Thus, while political progress toward autonomy has been slowed by
 guerrilla warfare, it is the opinion of high-ranking officials that
 political advance is nevertheless imperative if Malaya is to remain
 non-Communist.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 The Government banned the MCP, its fronts,-and its labor organiza-
 tion in mid-1918, when it also adopted Emergency Regulations placing
 extraordinary powers in the hands of the administration.  British Security
 Forces consist of about 10,000 soldiers and 60,000 regular and special
 police.   In addition, a part-time Home Guard of 140,000 has been recruited.
 The Home Guard and most of the special police are employed on static
 guard duty.  In addition to the military campaign, the Government has
 undertaken special measures under the Emergency Regulations, as well as
 broader social, political, and economic steps designed to create a
 climate unfavorable to the growth of. Communism.
 By the end of 1952, more than 100,000 Chinese "squatters" living
 on the edges of the jungle and beyond administrative control had been
 moved to protected "new villages" beyond the easy reach of Communist
 forces that had been intimidating them as a means of getting food,
 funds, and information.  During 1952, as in previous years, several
 thousand Malayan Chinese and a lesser number of Indians were deported
 from Malaya, and additional thousands were detained.  Moreover, in
 several instances entire villages were punished for refusing information
 to Security Forces or ignoring warnings to cease sheltering or feeding
 guerrillas.  Under the Emergency Regulations all inhabitants have been
 required to carry identity cards; carrying arms without a license has
 been made a capital offense; the movement of food has been restricted;
 pro-Communist newspapers have been banned; and the solicitation of
 money or food for the guerrillas has been made a capital offense.  An
 additional important regulation has placed in the hands of a comptroller
 the power to direct any person into the police or military forces or to.
 perform any other duty.
 The announced British aim has been to guide the colonial
 territories to responsible self-government within the Commonwealth
 and, as a means to that end, to do everything possible to establish
 the required economic and social conditions.  The Federation Government's
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 efforts in this direction has been given a sense of urgency by the
 belief of high-ranking Federation officials that such measures will
 provide a long term solution to the problem of Communism.  Inter-
 racial harmony is seen as a prerequisite to the development of Malayan
 nationalism, and organizations, including political parties, embracing
 all communities in Malaya have been encouraged.  Local elections have
 been held in several municipalities, while some public members (as
 opposed to government officials) of the Legislative Council have been
 given respon3ibility for government departments as a first step toward
 cabinet government.  Citizenship provisions have been relaxed to allow
 a much larger number of Malayan Chinese to qualify, and agreement has
 been reached that a certain proportion of Malayan Chinese will be
 allowed in the Malayan Civil Service.  In the field of education,
 regarded as a critical element in "Malayanizing" the Chinese, the
 decision has been taken to establish national schools based on the
 Malay and English languages.
 Economic development, although slowed by the present guerrilla
 prcblem, has aimed at expanding the national income by improving and
 diversifying agricultural production, encouraging light industry, and
 improving power supply and communication.
 Propaganda measures, both with the guerrillas and with the
 civilian population, have been intensified recently.  Leaflets, posters,
 radio, and mobile public address systems are used.  One of the most
 effective measures has been the use of surrendered guerrillas to recite
 their unfortunate experiences with the Communists to a group of villagers.
 The recent change in tactics by the MCP would seen to indicate
 that measures taken by the Government have,.at a minimum, been effective
 in containing the guerrillas.  The party's new tactics, however, will
 force the Government to adopt new methods, particularly since the in-
 filtration of labor unions is to be attempted.  Since police training
 has been directed toward the conduct of operations rather than the
 collection of intelligence it is possible that the new Communist methods
 may achieve some success before being checked by the Security Forces..
 V.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 A policy of encouraging responsible trade unionism was inaugurated
 shortly after World War II in Malaya.  In the early stages, the Malayan
 Communist Party gained control of the labor movement, organized general
 labor unions on a regional basis and finally established a top-level
 executive body known as the Pan Malayan Federation of Trade Unions
 (PMFTU), which claimed affiliation with the World Federation of Trade
 Unions.  The P1FTU was declared illegal in June 1948.  Subsequently,
 many unions rapidly disintegrated. and many labor leaders went underground.
 Despite the fact that organized labor remains a Communist target,
 the Federation Government continues to encourage trade unionism as a

 -9-
 means of developing social responsibility and combatting Communism.
 Under government guidance, trade unions have been rebuilt and a modest
 nucleus of non-Communist unions now exists as a basis for further
 expansion.  A Malayan Trade Union Council, which was formed in March 1950,
 subsequently affiliated with the International Confederation of Trade
 Unions.
 .   No labor unions in Malaya are known to be Communist infiltrated
 at the present time and no Communist influence on the leadership has
 been observed.  While Communists have forced strikes among rubber
 tappers in certain areas of Malaya, Communist pressure was exerted
 from outside the unions rather than from within.
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL. CULTURAL. AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 There have been no indications of Communist influence in social,
 cultural, or professional organizations.  It is highly probable, however,
 that there has been some Communist infiltration of Chinese secret societies.
 .VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 There is no known Communist infiltration into the Government
 of the Federation of Malaya.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 There is some evidence pointing to the infiltration of the
 faculties of Chinese schools by operatives of the Chinese Communist Party.
 The placement of'pro-,Communist teachers in Chinese schools appears to
 have been accomplished at times with the connivance of school trustees.
 Such infiltration appears to be designed not only to spread Communist
 doctrine but to recruit students to go to China for completion of their
 education.
 IX.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 There is no known Communist infiltration of any of the Malayan
 political parties.
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 Publications of the MCP, usually attributed to various of the
 District Committees, are mimeographed news sheets circulated clandestinely
 or covertly posted in a public place.  Publications which have appeared
 with some regularity include Freedom NNeews, Workers'    ress, and Workerst
 and Students' News.      The numbers copies c rrccuu ated i s     own.
 At one time, large numbers of Communist or pro-Communist Chinese
 publications were imported from Hong Kong.  The police, however, have

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 10 -
 now undertaken to prevent such trade, and overt importation has ceased.
 There is presumably some clandestine circulation of such publications.
 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 No information concerning the financial condition of the MCP
 is available.
 XII.    SOVIET-SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 Neither the USSR and its European satellites, nor the Pei-p'ing
 regime, maintain diplcmatic, trade, or cultural missions in the Federation
 of Malaya.
 XIII.  COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 No Communist international organizations maintain installations
 within Malaya, and no conferences of such organizations have been held
 in Malaya.. Communist sources have reported the presence of.Malayan
 representatives at meetings of various Communist international organiza-
 tions.                       Since 19148, however, these representatives have been Chinese
 who at one time lived in Malaya.  No representatives have left Malaya
 specifically to attend a particular meeting, or could be said to represent
 any particular Malayan organization.  Many have been deportees.
 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 The MCP is thought to maintain its closest ties with Communist
 organizations in Thailand, and in Sumatra, Indonesia, and with the
 Chinese Communist Party.  It is assumed that at the present time
 instructions to the MCP are relayed through Pei-p'ing and Moscow radios,
 which have not only given propaganda support to.the MCP but have, prior
 to the adoption of a new propaganda line by the MCP, indicated what
 that line should be.
 The beginning of a campaign of violence in 19148, already favored
 by some MCP leaders, was given impetus by the decisions of the Second
 Congress of the Communist Party of India, held concurrently with the
 Calcutta Youth Festival sponsored by the World Federation of Democratic
 Youth and the International Union of Students in early 19148.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:                                 (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN THE PHILIPPINES:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 The leadership of the Philippine Communist Party apparently does
 not believe that the situation will favor a drive for immediate power for
 some years to come.   They regard the present period as a preparatory one
 and place main emphasis on organizational and propaganda work.  Their
 principal immediate objectives in rough order of priority, appear to be:
 1.  To win over the masses to the Commmmist cause.
 2.  To discredit anti-Communist parties and leaders.
 3.  To weaken the close ties existing between the
 Philippines and the US.
 4.  To prevent further dissipation of the party's
 military arm.
 Although the Philippine Communists consider the workers and the
 landless peasants as the backbone of their movement and plan to concentrate
 their organizational propaganda efforts on them, they are also striving to
 enlist the support of bourgeois groups with a popular front program.  In
 order to facilitate its work of laying a basis for a seizure of power, the
 Philippine Communist Party has outlined a program calling for the intensifica-
 tion of what it calls "legal" and "illegal" activities among the masses.
 (Although all Communist activities are illegal in the Philippines and have
 been driven underground, the Communists consider as illegal only their
 military activities and activities directly relating to the support of
 their military arm.)  Their program consists of (1) revival of popular
 front political parties; (2) infiltration of cadres into Government agencies.,-
 i.e.... schools, military forces, into strategic industries, and into or-
 ganizations and groups, i.e., labor unions, peasant organizations, women's
 and youth organizations, etc.; (3) increased indoctrination of the rank and
 file of the movement; and (4) intensification of propaganda activities.
 Party planning apparently envisages the possible negotiation of an amnesty
 settlement with the Goverment which would enable it to expand its non-
 military activities.  Tactics for the 1953 Presidential and Congressional
 elections seem to call for support to candidates allegedly sympathetic to
 Communism.
 Communist propaganda planning calls for an intensification of the
 "peace" and "national independence" themes.  "Peace" appears designed to
 bring about a weakening of public support for the Government's anti-Communist
 policies in both the domestic and foreign fields.  "National independence"

 will attempt to place blame for all the ills of the Philippines on US
 policies and US influence on its "puppets" -- the major Philippine political
 parties.  The Communists are charging that US military and economic aid
 programs are disadvantageous to the Philippine masses.  Both themes are
 to be infused into all party activities and, with suitable adaptations,
 directed to all classes of the populace.
 Communists are using their military arm, the People's Liberation
 Army (HMB), for disrupting Government operations, e.g. assassinations of
 prominent anti-Communists, sabotaging the economy, procuring supplies, and
 as an agency for recruiting the more violent malcontents among the masses.
 At present, however, a policy of conserving HIS strength and limiting its
 operations appears to be in effect.  It may be that in the face of continued
 Government pressures and in order to gain from the Government freedom of
 operation for their organizational and propaganda programs, Philippine
 Communists might further reduce their military activities.
 III.  CAPABILITIES
 The Philippine Communist Party, which in 1950 was strong enough to
 carry on widespread and well-coordinated armed rebellion, had by 1953 reached
 a low point in revolutionary potential and no longer constituted a serious
 threat to the Philippine Government.  The party's once formidable military
 arm, the 11MB, now has capabilities for only small-scale raids and ambuscades,
 while the party is reduced to attempts to infiltrate and organize front
 groups in the face of very severe government repressive measures.  Moreover,
 the party is suffering from a serious shortage of capable executives and
 theoreticians, its organizational apparatus is scattered and harassed by
 increasingly effective Government intelligence operations, its propaganda
 output is small and distributed with difficulty, and its finances are in a
 precarious state.
 Whether the PKP can again develop sufficient strength to threaten the
 stability of the Philippine Government depends mostly on factors outside the
 control of the PKP.  For the future strength or weakness of the PKP hinges
 on (1) whether or not the Philippine Government continues its strong anti-
 Communist programs; (2) whether or not the US can maintain effective eoo-
 nomic and military aid to the Philippines; and (3) whether or not the
 Philippine Government increases its efforts to alleviate social and economic
 ills.  In the event of fraudulent elections in 1953 with accompanying civil
 disorders and a loss of popular support for the Government, or the accom-
 modation of one or the other major political parties to amnesty negotiations,
 a situation probably would be created in which short term Commumist objec-
 tives and planning could operate with a fair degree of success.  However,
 Communist tactics and planning appear to envisage a lengthy period of
 time as necessary before they will be in a position to effectively challenge
 the Philippine Government with a resurgence of their military arm and

 widespread mass support.  With the uncertainties at present threatening
 the continuance of a strong anti-Communist policy on the part of some
 Government leaders, and in the absence of an effective Government reform
 program, it appears that the defensive strategy of the pKF is well suited
 to Philippine conditions through 1953.
 IV.  SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ON THE CHINESE CCBIIUNISTS IN THE PHILIPPINES
 Because of excellent security practices, very little information re
 available concerning the objectives, tactics, and capabilities of the Chinese
 Communists in the Philippines.  Nevertheless, to judge by their known ac-
 tivities, their objectives include the following:
 1.  To gain the loyalty and financial support of the
 Chinese community -- numbering about 200,000 --
 for the Chinese Communist cause, and, conversely,
 to subvert and discredit Kuomintang forces in the
 Philippines;
 2.  To construct an effective espionage network;
 3.  In general, to establish a firm mass base for more
 violent revolutionary action in the future, and;
 4.  To support the Philippine Communist movement in any
 manner which does not jeopardize fulfillment of the
 first three objectives.  Available evidence indicates
 that the Chinese Coinmmnists in the Philippines place
 highest priority on the objectives involving the
 Chinese community.
 In order to attain these goals, Chinese Communists employ a variety
 of tactics, including infiltration, some terrorism, and propaganda.  Up to
 now, Chinese Communists have concentrated on infiltration of Chinese or-
 ganizations, particularly secret societies, chambers of commerce, and
 schools.  However, some Chinese Communist infiltration of intelligence
 agencies of the Philippine Government has been reported.  Chinese Communists
 extort contributions from rich Chinese merchants by threats of violence to
 them or their relatives in China.  Some propaganda materials, most of which
 apparently are smuggled into the country, are distributed among the Chinese
 oommmity.
 Apparently, the Chinese C,om~munists in the Philippines still have
 fairly considerable capacity for future espionage, infiltration, and
 propaganda activities.  The Philippine Government round-up of Chinese
 Communist suspects in December 1952 evidently did not cause material
 damage to the Chinese Communist apparatus in the Philippines.  Nevertheless,

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 the Philippine Government and the Kuomintang organization in the Philippines
 are united in opposition to Chinese Communist activity there.  The great
 majority of the Chinese in the Philippines apparently are either anti-
 Communist or politically neutral.  The ability of Chinese Communists in
 the Philippines for forming front groups or labor unions is, very limited.

 COMMUNISM IN THE PHILIPPINES:  ASSETS
 1.  NUMERICAL STRFaTGTH
 The membership of the Philippine Communist Party (PKP) probably
 numbers about 3,000 to 5,000.  There are about 8,000 to 10,000 Huks,
 the Peoples' Liberation Army or military arm of the PKP, who are not
 PKP members and an estimated 40,000 members of Communist-dominated
 mass organizations.    The number of people influenced by partial, but
 significant, Communist infiltration of non-Communist organizations is
 unknown.. Altogether, Communists and those strongly influenced by
 Communism are estimated to account for 0.2 percent to one percent of
 the total population.  Chinese Communists are estimated to number
 2,000-3,000 but there are no data on the number of members of
 organizations controlled or influenced by them.  PKP membership
 increased from 1946 to 1950 but declined during 1951 and 1952; there
 has been a great increase in Chinese Communist strength since 1946.
 Approximately 90 percent of PKP members and following are located
 in Central and Southern Luzon with the balance in Northern Luzon and
 scattered localities in the Visayas and Mindanao.  The leadership has
 come primarily from Manila, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, and Bulacan in
 Central Luzon.  Chinese Communists are primarily in Manila and the towns
 and cities of Southern Luzon, Cebu, and Iloilo.  The bulk of the PKP
 membership and sympathizers are peasants while Chinese Communists are
 primarily merchants, school teachers, and administrators.
 Party members are for the most part poorly indoctrinated in
 Communist theory,. have little education, but as a result of continuing
 governmental suppressive action, are probably reduced now to a loyal
 and hard working core.  Morale and discipline among ordinary party
 members is generally good, although some instances of financial dis-
 honesty and sexual profligacy have occurred.  The fanatical well-
 indoctrinated "hard core" probably amounts to 20 percent in the case
 of the PKP and 30 percent for the Chinese Communists.  In the case of
 the PKP, few have been members more than ten years.
 The top leaders of the PKP apparently are not of high caliber
 but the Chinese are of generally good quality.  According to William
 Pomeroy, the.American Communist who served with the Huks for two years,
 the various leaders displayed poor executive ability, poor ideological
 training, or lack of flexibility.  Taken as a group, the PKP leadership
 has suffered from shortages of good executives,and theoreticians since
 at least 1948.  On the other hand, most top PKP leaders are hard
 working, resourceful, and hardened by the conditions of harassment
 under which they live.  They-have close connections with the common
 people and are responsive to their motivations.  For the most part they
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 are fairly young men in their late thirties or forties, and many have
 had only military experience during World War II and afterward as an
 occupational background.
 The Communist Party is not a legal political party in the
 Philippines and cannot run candidates on a ticket of its own.  During
 the last general elections the PKP called for a boycott of the
 elections.  Chinese Communists in the Philippines apparently do not vote
 and do not have an electoral strategy.
 All political parties in the Philippines receiving votes in the,
 last elections are avowedly anti-Communist.
 The military arm of the PKP, the Peoples" Liberation Army (HMB)
 or Huks, numbers between 8,000-10,000.  Not all of these are active at
 any one time.  Approximately half are farmers who only occasionally
 participate in Bilk raids, ambuscades, etc.  BMB units operate as
 guerrillas with the strength of individual bands varying between five
 and 100.  They have no heavy weapons but an ample supply of small arms
 in fair to poor condition.  So far as is known, the HUB receives no
 military support from outside the Philippines but may receive military
 advice from China.  However, there is no definite information on the
 number or duties of Chinese Communists operating with the HUB..
 Opposed by approximately 23,000 government troops, the HMB
 retains capabilities for small scale raids, ambuscades, kidnappings,
 assassinations, and the dissemination of Communist propaganda.  As a
 result of their depredations, nearly one-third of total government
 expenditures goes to the armed services.  While the HMB does not threaten
 the stability of the government, they nevertheless are a drain on its
 financial resources, hinder economic development, and tend to disrupt
 the food supply situation.
 HMB strength and activity is concentrated in Central and Southern
 Luzon; their plans for expanding operations in the central and southern
 islands apparently have been abandoned for the present.  In the face of
 the increased effectiveness of government military action against them,
 it is doubtful whether the HMB can expand its activities in the near
 future unless in the event of a fraudulent national election in 1953.
 HMB operations are hindered also by the improved discipline of the
 Philippine Army which has had the result of gaining the cooperation of
 many townspeople and peasants.  While a sizeable number of local
 residents in Central Luzon remain sympathetic with the HMB or are
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 fearful of HMB reprisals, large numbers are now supporting the Army's
 efforts to eliminate HMB activities.  Still, approximately 40,000
 members of PKP mass organizations and Communist sympathizers aid the
 HMB in the collection of intelligence, procure food and recruits, work
 at HMB "production bases" in the Sierra Madres where root crops are
 grown, or act as couriers.  They enable the HMB to sustain its present
 rather low level of activity.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TGNARD COMMUNISM
 The Philippine Government and both major political parties are
 anti-Communist and no overt Communist activities are permitted.  Although
 the PKP has not been outlawed by Congress, in 1951 a Philippine Court
 ruled that the PKP was a seditious and illegal association.  Although
 this decision has been appealed, the Supreme Court probably will uphold
 the lower court's ruling.  In any event, all PKP members and members of
 auxiliary organizations are subject to arrest.  All front organizations
 are underground and severely hampered by government agencies.  In areas
 of the Philippines where Communists are most active, the privilege of
 the writ of habeas corpus and the right to bail is denied to them.  All
 Chinese Communist activities are also forbidden and individual Chinese
 Communists are subject to deportation to Taiwan on the sole grounds of
 Communist membership.
 Very little is known of the "underground" activities of Filipino
 or Chinese Communists.  PKP organizations apparently are poorly trained
 and organized and with the exceptions of aiding Huks, collecting
 intelligence, and passing on word of mouth propaganda, do not appear
 to be very active.
 V.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 During 1951, Communist influence in the Philippine Labor move-
 ment was reduced drastically, and at present there are no Communist
 unions or known significant infiltration of labor unions or key
 industries:  The possibility of Communist infiltration exists.  Party
 members have been ordered to make lists including all factories, the
 organizational status of laborers and leaders therein, and the problems
 of the laborers.
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL,
 AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 Communist front organizations apparently have been identified
 by the government and driven deeply underground in the Philippines.
 There appears to be no known significant infiltration of non-Communist
 organizations by Philippine Communists.
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 Since the suppression by the government of the large front labor
 organizations in 1951, the largest mass organization probably has been
 the National Peasants Union.  It has an estimated 4,000-10,000 members
 located mostly in Central Luzon and was formerly the largest peasants'
 organization.  For the type of organization it is, it appears to have
 had good leadership, and were the present severe restrictive measures
 of the government to be relaxed, it probably could be considerably
 expanded.
 Two other known Communist mass organizations are the National
 Women's League and the National Youth League.  In 1951, the former
 had a reported membership of 1,500 and the latter 2,200, but again,
 these organizations are underground and very little is known of their
 present activities.
 All known Chinese Communist organizations have gone underground.
 These include the Hwa Chi Comrades Association, the Anti-Japanese and
 Anti-Collaborators League, and the K'ang Fan.  There appears to have been
 a significant infiltration of Chinese Chambers of Commerce in several
 cities and reports indicate a possible infiltration of the leading
 Chinese anti-Communist association -- the Anti-Communist Anti-Soviet
 Salvation Association.
 Present Communist planning calls for the organization and infil-
 tration of various mass organizations -- youth, women, intellectuals,
 etc., but to date there is no indication that they have made significant
 progress with these plans.  From Cavite Province comes a report that a
 '"peace" organization (Katahimikan ng Mahirap - Peace for the Poor) was
 being organized.
 Party theory conceives of two main types of infiltration
 activities:  "legal" and "illegal."  "Legal" infiltration activities
 consist of working toward a policy-making position within an organiza-
 tion, subtly exerting influence on its policies, and standing-by to
 replace an "illegal" cadre if the latter.is arrested.  "Illegal"
 activities include industrial sabotage and recruitment of new members
 for the HUB.  A party member sometimes engages in both types of
 activities simultaneously.
 There is no known significant infiltration of the government by
 Communists.  That some infiltration has occurred was evidenced by the
 court conviction in May 1951 of an official of the Department of Foreign
 Affairs for participation in the Communist rebellion, and in 1952, of a
 Nacionalista Congressman on a similar charge.  There are reports of
 suspected Communist sympathies on the part of fairly prominent
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 Administration officials, but these have not been confirmed.  In the
 past there has also been some Chinese Communist infiltration of the
 Military Intelligence Service.
 There is no known Philippine Communist influence in Philippine
 public-opinion-forming circles, although a few journalists are reported
 to hold views sympathetic to Communism.  There is some Chinese Communist.
 penetration of Chinese schools and possibly one radio station.
 IX.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST
 POLITICAL PARTIES
 There is no known Communist infiltration of the non-Communist
 Philippine political parties.
 Current Communist periodicals are the Mapagpalaya (The Liberator),
 Titis (the Spark), and Freedom.  They appear at uncertain intervals and
 none probably has a circulation exceeding 10,000.  They are clandestinely
 mimeographed in several or perhaps all-Party Regions at HMB camps.
 Information on Chinese Communist publications is not available.
 Two publications, Hungary, and The Working Youth in the Rumanian
 People's Republic, have been received unsolicited by individuals in
 Manila and Dumaguete and by the Philippine Education Company.  There is
 no regular importing of Communist publications from abroad, but
 occasionally US Communist Party publications and Chinese Communist
 newspapers are smuggled in, the latter from Hongkong.
 There are no Communist radio stations in the Philippines, with the
 possible exception of one station in Manila (the Kuo Tai Station) which
 in October 1952 was organized by an alleged Chinese Communist.  Further
 information on this station is unavailable.  There are no foreign
 Communist broadcasts directed specifically at the Philippines.  The
 reception and size of audience of Peiping's daily 30-minute broadcast
 in English to Southeast Asia or its programs in Mandarin, Cantonese,
 and Amoy dialects to overseas Chinese are unknown.
 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 In recent years PKP theoreticians have emphasized the significance
 of finance and supply operations, both of which are called finance in
 PKP terminology.  Data about the actual financial status of the PKP as
 of January 1953 are not available.  Although foreign sources, notably
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 the US Communist Party and Communist-dominated American labor unions,
 furnished fairly considerable financial aid to the PKP in the prewar
 period, the PKP apparently has received very little material assistance
 from abroad since world War II.  In 1951, the party leadership
 promulgated a "one year program" for the PKP during fiscal year 1952, and
 expected party revenues for this period were budgeted at the fantasti-
 cally high figure of US $4,621,000.  The captured American Communist,
 William Pomeroy, testified in mid-1952 that only "a tiny fraction" of
 this sum was collected.  Party finances in 1952 probably were below those
 during 1950, for example.  The PKP "Statement of Income" for the first
 six months of calendar year 1950 lists total party income for that
 period as US $10,750.  Apparently, the greatest source-of income is
 from raids and extortion practices.   (In contrast, according to the
 PKP "Statement of Income," only $28.50 was realized from the sale of
 Titis in the period April-June 1950.)
 Data on the income of the Chinese Communists are unknown.  Several
 business. firms are controlled by the Chinese Communists, but revenue
 figures from these sources are not available.  Probably the over-all
 health of the Chinese Communists is better than that of the PKP, in
 view of the generally good financial standing of the Chinese community.
 XII.  SOVIET SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 There are no Soviet or'satellite establishments diplomatic or
 otherwise in the Philippines.
 XIII.  COMMUWIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 Since the suppression of the various Communist front organiza-
 tions in the Philippines, there has been no evidence of any affiliation
 of Philippine groups with Communist International Organizations.  There
 are no installations or meetings of these latter within the Philippines
 and no known receipt or transmission of funds to or from them.
 Philippine Communists, however, have attended several Congresses or
 Conferences held abroad.  One Filipino reportedly attended the meeting
 of the International Union of Students in Peiping in 1951, and Teodosio
 Lansang (alias Manuel Cruz) attended the Berlin and Vienna Peace Council
 meetings in 1951 and 1952 respectively, and the Asian and Pacific Peace
 Conference in Peiping in 1952.  There was no known attendance at such
 meetings by Chinese Communists in the Philippines.
 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 The internal communication network of the PKP is a primitive one
 consisting primarily of the use of women couriers.  The Philippine Army
 is supposed to have located the main north-south courier route on Luzon
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-R DP86B00269R000800080001=4
 which ran down through the Sierra Madres.  Inter-island communication
 is by boat, and here there are infinite possibilities for'the Communists
 to choose.  There are reports that important leaders have radio  .
 receivers and that the Chinese Communists had established a transmitter
 in the Batanes Islands.  Chinese Communists apparently have excellent
 covert communication and courier systems.
 Contacts with the outside, of which China is most important and
 US next, must be clandestinely arranged.  The many islands and the long
 coastline of the Philippines offer many places for-couriers.to land.
 There are reports of couriers landing in Manila, Albay Province, and
 various places in the Sulu Archipelago.  landings from unidentified
 submarines off the east coast of Luzon are frequently reported but are
 to date unconfirmed.  Most couriers apparently are Chinese who, after
 their arrival in the Philippines, manage to move about from place to
 place with no great trouble.
 The correlation of some PKP activities with general Communist
 strategy in the Far East possibly is effected at international Communist
 conventions and through couriers, but detailed proof of this is lacking.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COWUNISM IN THAILAND:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 The immediate goals of the Communists in Thailand are not easily
 discernible at the present moment, since the current vigorous anti-
 Communist drive of the Thai-authorities has presumably forced Communist
 leaders to reconsider their past strategy.
 Before November 10, 1952, the date when the Thai Government
 began its most recent attempt to suppress Communist activity, the imme-
 diate Communist objectives in Thailand appear to have been:
 1.  To expand and improve their own organizations, in preparation
 for the time when domestic events or external assistance might
 make a direct drive for power possible.
 2.  To mobilize all varieties of domestic sentiment against the
 present ruling group.
 3.  To undermine popular support for US policy in Asia and for
 Thailand's pro-American international orientation.
 4.  To render material and propaganda assistance to Communist-led
 rebels in Indochina and Malaya.
 In the current crisis, these objectives have probably been sub-
 ordinated to the overriding need to ensure the survival of key
 personnel.  If the Thai police persevere in?:their suppression of overt
 Communist activity, Communist strategy will probably be altered to give
 greater attention to underground organizational work and less attention
 to propaganda activity.
 Two distinct Communist organizations have developed in Thailand:
 the Thai Commmnist Party (TCP) and the Chinese Communist Party in
 Thailand (CCP(.T)).  The TCP is small and appears to be dominated by
 the larger and better organized CCP(T).  Two distinct parties are
 maintained, however, because of the long-standing antipathy with which
 many Thai regard the Chinese and the desire to create the appearance
 of an indigenous Communist movement.
 The CCP(T) has attempted to gain strength by recruiting personnel
 for training, both in Thailand and in China- by soliciting funds for
 local expenses and for transmission to the mainland; by penetrating
 Chinese schools, labor unions, business organizations, and regional
 associations; and by utilizing newspapers, some of which are subsidized,
 to carry propaganda.
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 The Thai Communist Party remains small and relatively ineffectual.
 Its efforts have been confined largely to propaganda work.  Because the
 Party, as such, is illegal, its overt activity has been carried on in
 the face of official tolerance or apathy.  Although the TOP has met
 with some success in creating "front" organizations to carry its
 message -- most notably the National Peace Committee of Thailand --
 agitation has had an impact only among certain groups of people.
 Teachers and students, writers and newsmen, some lower grade govern-
 ment officials, political opposition elements; and recently some
 Buddhist groups have been the major targets.
 Both Thai and Chinese elements have used a variety of appeals
 in a "broadside" propaganda barrage designed to contain themes attractive
 to diverse groups.  The principal themes-have been:
 1.' Denunciation of US "imperialism" -- responsible for the
 "sufferings" of the Thai people -- which is leading Thailand
 toward war.
 2.   Denunciation of the Thai Government -- for allowing itself to
 become the "puppet" of the US; for failure to provide for the
 people's welfare while exploiting labor and taxing the popula-
 tion heavily; for suppression of political rights and for
 unequal treatment of minorities; and for its internal corruption.
 3.   Emphasis on the strength of Communist China.
 4.   "Demonstration" of the compatibility of Buddhism and Communism.
 In recent months there seems to have been an intensified effort
 to expand activity into the provinces, both to infiltrate administrative
 services and to build a mass base among the peasantry which has thus
 far been unresponsive to the Communist message.  This change may be partly
 attributable to more effective police control in Bangkok, but it
 indicates the essentially long-range nature of Communist activity.
 Two other Communist groups are concerned chiefly with creating
 conditions in bordering countries which might, eventually, promote
 local Communist objectives.  Vietnamese and Cambodian Communist groups
 in northeast Thailand are supporting the rebellions in their own
 countries, securing money, arms, and supplies.  These elements, however,
 appear to be operationally distinct from both the TOP and the CCP(T).
 Communist groups in the southern provinces, largely an adjunct of the
 COP(T), are aiding Mayalan Communist guerrillas who occasionally enter
 Thailand.for rest and resupply.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Local Communist groups appear to receive guidance, and probably
 some financial support, from Chinese Communist liaison groups and
 through the Soviet Embassy in Bangkok, but the precise pattern of
 external direction is unclear.
 Prior to the initiation of repressive measures by the Thai
 Government in November 1952, the CCP(T) had gained control of most
 Chinese labor unions, but never utilized its capability of instigating
 minor violence through strikes and sabotage.  The TCP had, during the
 preceding year, increased the range, quantity, and quality of its
 propaganda activities.
 The future capabilities and prospects of the Communist movement
 will be directly determined by policies of the Thai Government.  As
 long as the present governing military coup group remains cohesive,
 its control of the country will be firm.  Police and military units
 are believed capable of controlling any overt action initiated by local
 Communists.  Although it will probably not be possible to suppress the
 covert dissemination of Communist ideas or to eliminate underground
 organizations, there is no prospect for a successful overthrow of the
 government as a result of local Communist activity.
 The policies which the Thai Government will pursue will, in
 turn, be heavily conditioned by external developments.  Its performance
 in the past has been somewhat ambivalent.  Official adherence to an anti-
 Communist policy at home and support of the West internationally con-
 trast with apparent toleration of any Communist activity which was not
 judged adirect threat to the present regime.  Disclosures of Communist
 plotting uncovered in the course of recent police actions seem to have
 alarmed some top government leaders, and the present repressive policies
 may be continued.  On the other hand, an extension of Communist control
 in adjacent areas in Indochina, Burma, or Malaya would be apt to produce
 sudden retrenchment.
 The Thai Government has historically sought to ride the balance
 between contending forces in Asia,. accommodating its policies to the
 dominant foreign power.  Its future actions might well be governed by
 similar expediential calculations.  If the Thai Government considered
 Chinese invasion imminent, it is probable that only direct and force-
 ful intervention by the US to protect the integrity of Thailand would
 prevent a swift reorientation.  At such a time, indigenous Communist
 elements. would find renewed opportunity to exploit existing Thai
 discontent with the Government and general Chinese resentment over the
 repressive measures previously imppsed on that large and strategic
 minority.

 CCHMUNISM IN THAILAND:  ASSETS
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 Several Communist parties operate in Thailand and total membership
 figures cannot be determined.. The Thai Communist Party (TCP) is quite
 small, with an estimated 50-100 members; the overwhelms majority of
 Communists in Thailand belong to minority groups.  The Chinese Communist
 Party in Thsilm3    (COP(T)) is the largest organization, with an estimated
 2,000 members.  Viet Minh and Cambodian Communist cadres have been active
 in the northeastern and eastern provinces, but the. number of Party members
 is unknown.
 The Overseas Chinese in Thailand have been subject to strong pressures
 for adherence to Communism and as many as 100,000 may be controlled or
 strongly influenced by Communists.  If 25,000 (one-half the estimated Indo-
 chinese refugees) is added to this total to allow for -the possible incidence
 of Communists or sympathizers among the Indochinese minority, the percentage
 of the total population of Thailand under Communist discipline or strongly
 influenced by Communists would reach a probable maid. mm: of 0.7 percent.
 TCP members have been recruited primarily from professionals, with
 lawyers and writers predominating.  The TCP also exerts some influence among
 a s:oa11 group of students at Bangkok universities.
 The CCP(T) is largely composed of businessmen and merchants; laborers
 comprise the bulk of the Chinese population controlled or influenced by the
 COP(T).
 Most of the Indochinese refugees were originally farmers and laborers
 but most are now merchants and artisans due to the Thai government's
 restrictions on entering some occupations.  Communist agents have been able
 to control and organize many Indochinese by infiltrating and dominating
 village and welfare. organizations.
 The center of known Communist strength is in the Bangkok metropolitan
 area where the TCP and the CCP(T) are believed to have covert headquarters.
 Two other areas of concentrated activity are the southern border region
 and the northeastern section of Thailan : Ban Phai, Hhon Kaen, and Nong
 Nhai are reported to be centers of the Communist apparatus in the northeast;
 Songkhla and Hat Yai are principal centers in the south with much activity
 along the Sadao-Betong frontier region.
 Much of the membership of the TCP appears to be opportunistic.  In
 contrast, probably the entire membership of the CCP(T) is "hard-core."
 The Communnist organizers among the Indochinese minority are presumably
 well-indoctrinated Viet Minh agents of the "hard-core" category.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 The leadership of the CCP(T) is vested in a central executive com-
 mittee of, according to one report, 36 members.  A special characteristic
 of this central group is that many of its members are businessmen of long
 residence in Thailand; very few are believed to be professional revolu-
 tionaries with a long history of Communist activity.  It is believed that
 membership in the CCP(T) increased as a result of the Communist conquest
 of China to the present estimated figure of 2,000.
 Insufficient evidence precludes analysis of the quality of TCP
 leadership or the stability of party membership.  There probably has been
 little change, however, in the total strength of the TCP since 19166.
 The number of Communists in the Indochinese minority grew enormously
 during the 19166-1950 period as a vast number of refugees. entered Thailand.
 Membership figures among this group have probably been fairy stable for
 the past two years (1951-1952).
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 Even though political parties have been prohibited in Thailand, a
 recent Thai law specifically outlaws the Communist Party as well as member-
 ship in any type of Communist organization.  This restriction plus complete
 goverment control over. electoral procedures virtually eliminates Communist
 participation in elections.   As a further handicap, the great majority of
 Communists in Thailand are found in minority groups and are largely without
 voting privileges.
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 The Communists have not adopted violent action as a means of further-
 ing Communist objectives in Thailand.  Violent action, however, has occurred
 in the southern Thai provinces where raids, murders, and kidnappings are- used
 in intimidating the local Chinese populace to supply and finance the Malayan
 guerrilla forces operating' along the Thai-Malay border,
 Cammniaist activities in Thailand have so far been largely limited to
 fields of organization, propaganda, and espionage. There have been no
 strikes or sabotage, and, except in the, southern provinces, no murders or
 violence of any kind that can be definitely attributed to Communist elements.
 Nor do the.Conmunists appear to be in a position to carry on this type of
 \direct action in the near future.
 Although during World War II some Communists were probab   involved
 in' the Free Thai resistance movement, no indigenous Communist military
 resi>l,tanoe organization developed in Thailand, and no Communist insur-
 rectionary attempts have-ever occurred in Thailand.  Rumors of'CommrUnist
 involvement in various cope d!etat have never been confirmed.  If any

 -6-
 Coiivmmi.sts were involved, it was probably on an individual basis and not
 as the result of a concentrated Ccmmmist effort to overthrow the govern,
 Mont,  In fact, it has apparently been Communist policy to avoid involve-
 ment in the periodic political oou  that are attempted in Bangkok.  In
 view of the apparent lack of preparation for military action, no armed
 Communist insurrection seems to be contemplated in the immediate future.
 Various unconfirmed reports, however, describe the organizing of
 a Conamist underground armed force designed to accomplish sabotage or
 guerrilla operations.  Probably some tentative plans have been drawn up
 and perhaps a small number of weapons have been cached, but there. is no
 evidence of the existence of a Communist para-military organization in
 Thailand.  Government restrictions and police surveillance seriously limit
 Communist ability to arm and train a pare-military force in Thailand.
 No reliable information is available regarding Commmnist plans
 for a military resistance organization in case of war.  The estimated
 maximmm number that could be organized for this type of activity is per-
 haps 5,000 to 10,000 Chinese.  Although a few CCP(T) leaders are reported
 to have had guerrilla experience in China, most of the leadership for
 guerrilla operations would have to be imported.  Arms which were acctmYUlated
 immediately after World War II are reported to have been shipped to Indo-
 china to supply the Viet Minh between 1948 and 1950, and perhaps others
 have been sent to Malaya.  Present stores of weapons and equipment for
 guerrilla action are believed to be negligible.
 IV.  GOVERNM T POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 The military group heading the government since 1948 has always
 been avowedly anti-Communist.  Implementation of governmental repressive
 measures, however, has been sporadic and largely ineffectual and Communist
 propaganda efforts (the major activity) multiplied.
 In November 1952, the government's anti-Communist efforts were in-
 tensified, a law was passed outlawing Communism, and the police began a
 series of mass arrests of Communists and fellow-travelers.  Three major
 Communist-sponsored newspapers were closed in December,  In January 1953
 arrests were continuing.  The government has announced intentions to
 round up all Ca uxunists and sympathizers in TE+ai land.
 As of January 1953, no front organization was operating in Thailand
 since many Communist or fellow traveler leaders were in jail or hiding from
 the police.  Communist propaganda output had dwindled to a trickle as police
 censorship over newspapers was strictly enforced, a number of editors were
 arrested, and several leading Communist dailies were suppressed.  Communists
 still dominated the large Central Labor Union, but- government sponsorship-of
 a rival trade union presented a serious challenge to continued Communist
 control of the major portion of organized labor in Thailand.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Strict warnings by security police accompanied by' an increase in
 patrol activity have usually sufficed to prevent the formation of anti-
 government or protest demonstrations by Communists or any other group.
 Only in the southern provinces on the Malayan frontier has Thai authority
 been seriously endangered by extensive Communist activity.  A gradual in-
 crease in police efficiency in this area, however, has been discernible
 recently, and continued cooperation with Malayan authorities could probably
 reduce this threat.
 Although the Thai government did not outlaw membership in Conmmnist
 organizations until November 1952, the Communist organizations in Thailand
 have in effect been "underground" for at least five years.  The Communists
 have been fairly efficient in covert party activities such as arranging
 illegal entries into Thailand, sending students to China for training, and
 smuggling of limited amounts of goods and arms to Indochina and Malaya.
 Espionage is probably well developed.
 V  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 The numerical strength of Communists in various occupations is-not known.  The Conmuunist-controlled Central Labor Union (CLII), however, repre-
 sents a majority of the workers in the important rice milling and rice ex-
 porting industries and the majority of all stevedore workers.  Other oc-
 cupational areas in which the CLU has organized unions include tugboats,
 merchant marine, streetcars, oil companies, saw mills, match factories,
 textiles, the tea trade, the Bangkok vegetable growers,,the Makkasan rail-
 road shopworkers, tobacco factories, ice factories, bakeries, watchmaking
 and goldsmithing, wood and metal processing, various service industries,
 hotels, restaurants, coffee shops, and laundries.
 Only about 2 percent of the labor force     Thailand is organized.
 Of this amount somewhere between 50-75 percent is organized in the CLU
 which had about 50,,000-m    re in 1952.  Approximately three-quarters of
 the strength of the CLU is in the Bangkok-Thou Buri area and 95 percent
 of its members and leaders are believed to be Chinese.  Since February 7,
 1949, the CLU has been a member of the WFTU.  The WFTU does not maintain
 an office  in Thailand and contact between CLU and WFTU is often concealed.
 The Executive Committee of the CLU is believed to control four
 geographic trade union federations with approximately 50 local branches:
 (1) the Bangkok Federation of Trade Unions, (2) the Chachoengsao Federa-
 tion of Trade Unions, (3) the Ubon Federation of Trade Unions, and (4) the
 Songkhla Federation'of Trade Unions.  The Executive Committee of the CUT
 reportedly also has immediate control over some local unions in areas where
 no federation has been established.  In addition, a number of local unions
 are not members but are affiliated with the CLU.
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 The Thai Government's continued antagonism to the CLU, expressed
 through its active sponsorship of the rival Thai National Trade Union
 Congress, is serving to reduce the preponderant position of the CLU.
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL,
 AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 A.  Front Organizations
 Since the end of World War II a number of Communist-front organi-
 zations have been reported in Thailand.  The great majority of these
 failed to develop beyond the initial planning stage, and claims of ex-
 tensive membership have not been substantiated.  No Thai front
 organizations are known to be active at present.  On the other hand,.a
 few Chinese associations of long standing are now Communist-dominated;
 these remain active and are likely to survive the current anti-Communist
 drive of the government.
 1.  Communist-sponsored fronts.  A student organization called the
 Union of Thai Students (UTS) with a claimed membership of 3,000 affiliated
 with the world-front International Union of Students (IUS) in September
 1951. In January l953'the strength of this organization was estimated
 to be a maximum of.80-100.  The Thai government discourages political
 activity among. students and no student movement not sponsored by the
 government is likely to gain much strength or importance.  The UTS has
 been of little consequence; if it still exists it is probably located
 in Bangkok.
 The National Peace Committee of Thailand (NPCT) was organized in
 1951 to support the Communist-sponsored peace petition.  The Communists
 have used the NPCT to organize and foment opposition to the policies
 of the Thai government and as apropaganda outlet.  A number of prominent
 journalists, opposition politicians, students, writers, and other in-
 tellectuals dominate the organization.  It is affiliated with the World
 Peace Council and delegates were sent to the Asian and Pacific Peace
 Conference in Peiping in October-1952. Thai representatives have also
 attended other "peace" meetings.  Until recently, membership was re-
 ported to be from 70-100.  As of January 1953, however, most members
 of the NPCT were in jail awaiting trial.  Police repressive measures
 will probably limit the usefulness of this organization in the future.
 Several women's organizations have been organized in the past
 by both Thai and Chinese Communists; they failed to gain popular sup-
 port, however, and no women's "front" organization is known to exist at
 present.

 2.  Organizations captured by Communists.  The Chao Chou Hui Kuan
 (Swatow Association      with 7,000 members is the largest of seven-Chinese
 regional or dialect associations in Thailand.  The leaders of this
 organization are Communists or sympathizers and the association has
 strong contacts with individuals and groups in China. The majority of
 the members are in the Bangkok metropolitan area and the-leadership
 has considerable influence in the Chinese community.  It publishes a
 monthly magazine, operates several schools, sponsors a small clinic
 which provides cheap medical care for the poor,.sponsors athletic'
 events, and performs countless welfare tasks.
 The Pao Te Shan Ttang (Philanthropio Association) with head-
 quarters in Bangkok is the most important and most influential organi-
 zation of its kind among the Chinese.  Its board of directors contains
 some prominent Communists and sympathizers..  Nearly all of its philan-
 thropic work is carried on in Bangkok but it is nation-wide in so far
 as contributions come from Chinese throughout the country.  More than
 any Chinese association, this welfare association has the means and the
 opportunity to contact most of the Chinese in Thailand.  Its prestige
 and charitable work make it an effective medium for the spread of
 Communist influence.
 Be ':Non-Communist Organizations Infiltrated by Communists
 The only significant non-Communist Thai organization penetrated
 by the Communists and fellow-travelers is the Press Association of
 Thailand (PAT) composed of newspapermen and journalists from non-
 government publications.  Since the PAT strongly opposes the govern-
 ment's press censorship policy (which policy directly affects the
 effeotiveness..of Communist propaganda), this organization has been
 utilized by Communists to denounce the government.
 The Chinese Chamber of Commerce (Bangkok), with a membership
 of 5,000 individuals and firms, includes both pro-Kuomintang and pro-
 Communist cliques.  It. is the most influential Chinese organization in
 Thailand and often assumes the role of spokesman for the Chinese
 community.  Despite strenuous efforts Chinese Communists have been
 unable to dominate this organization, though they still remain a
 significant minority within it. .Penetration and domination of the
 _
 Chinese Chamber of Commerce would enable Communists to exercise a
 strong influence among the Chinese minority in Thailand.

 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 There is no known Communist influence at policy levels of the
 Thai government or any of its agencies.  Frequent rumors of contacts
 between certain government officials and Communist agents are without
 substantiation.
 .VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 Communists have been able to achieve only limited success in
 penetrating or controlling public opinion forming circles in Thailand.
 The only appreciable influence of Communists on. education is through
 the CCP(T) which controls a few Chinese schools.  Apparently efforts
 have been made by Communists to infiltrate Buddhist organizations,.but
 so far these attempts have been unsuccessful.  Soviet bloc films are
 shown occasionally in a limited number of theaters in Bangkok and the.
 provinces.  Careful government control of the local broadcasting system
 has prevented any use of this medium by Communists,  The prevalent
 custom in Thailand of permitting considerable leeway to individual
 newsmen makes it possible for-fellow-traveler writers (often.subsidised
 by the Communists) employed by neutralist and uncommitted newspapers
 to inject Communist propaganda into the non-Communist press.  However.,
 it should be noted that it is often difficult to distinguish between
 non-Communist criticism of the government and Communist propaganda.
 Ix.
 COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON;-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 Political parties as such are prohibited in Thailand and the
 only legal political organization is the pro-government bloc in the
 National Assembly.  Communist influence in that body is either totally
 absent :or negligible.
 The government has alleged that the Free Thai followers of ex-
 premier Pridi Phanazrong are influenced by Communism and that these
 individuals represent.a cohesive political opposition movement:
 Although it is true that several former Pridi-ites are prominent fellow-
 travelers, it is believed that the majority are not pro-Communist.
 Inasmuch as there is no longer a formal Free Thai organization,
 Communist tendencies have become largely a matter of individual
 predilection.
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 Communist propaganda content in-Thailand follows the current
 party line quite closely with special adaptations for the local
 situation.  Daily items for Chinese and Thai publications usually are
 furnished by the New China News Agency (NCNA)'and Radio Peiping.

 Several daily newspapers regarded as party organs are supported by
 the Communists.  In addition, a number of fellow traveler publications
 and newsmen apparently receive subsidies from the CCP(T) or the Soviet
 Legation.  A few Communist films have been imported into Thailand; the
 principal theater exhibiting this type of film is the Sri Ayuthia in
 Bangkok.

 B.   Imported Publications
 Most imported propaganda material is in Chinese, printed in
 Peiping, Shanghai, or Hongkong.  Smaller shipments of Communist
 publications are received in Thai and English, and a relatively
 insignificant proportion of imported propaganda material is in Russian.
 The major Communist publication outlet for Thailand is the "Overseas
 Chinese Book Store" in Bangkok, which carries about 600 assorted titles
 of books, magazines, and other publications.
 At various times the government has banned the importation of
 specific Communist publications but a large variety continued to be
 shipped in without restriction and sold openly by the Communist book-
 store.                             In December 1952, however, the bookstore was raided by the
 police and many items were confiscated.  Government restrictions may
 limit the usefulness of this outlet in''the future.
 The Soviet Legation distributes a semi-weekly Thai-language
 information bulletin which includes articles on Communist ideology,
 life in the Soviet Union, verbatim accounts of speeches by Russian
 delegates in the tflJ, and official propaganda.
 The Viet Minh organization in Bangkok disseminated propaganda
 until suppressed by the Thai government in 1950.  However, a few
 Viet Minh pamphlets published in Rangoon have circulated in Thailand.
 All domestic broadcasting stations are government controlled,
 thus precluding any Communist influence.
 Several programs from Communist stations abroad can be heard.
 in Thailand.  Moscow Radio broadcasts two half-hour programs daily in
 English and Radio Peiping has two daily programs in Thai, each of
 one-fourth to one-half hour duration.  Programs in Chinese and English

 can also be heard on this Chinese station.  The size of the listening
 audience is unknown.
 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 The TCP and the CCP(T) apparently have adequate financial re-
 sources for their present limited programs, although no information is income* available on              Communist elements neThailandaalsonistiunkn~?
 Vietnamese
 Some
 Within Thailand, funds are obtained from numerous sources.
 revenue is undoubtedly derived from membership fees, labor union revenues,
 and private donations.  Also profits presumably accrue from trading
 transactions of party-controlled business firms and from the sale of
 party publications.  Several Chinese business firms have apparently been
 established specifically to.provide financial support.  These include
 the Fah Dan Thai Co., Ltd, and the Andar Company which market Soviet,
 Chinese Communist,.and satellite goods.  The Andar Company's branch in
 Hongkong is reported to have handled gold shipments to Bangkok for use
 in defraying party expenses.  The "Overseas Chinese Book Store" in
 Bangkok was established to sell party publications.  Although informa-
 tion.is lacking on the amount of financial support given by these
 business undertakings, it is known that at least in part they subsi-
 dize Communist information services in Thailand.
 Supplies and funds extorted from Chinese rubber growers, in the
 southern provinces are used locally to support the Communist guerrilla
 bands operating along the Thai-Malay border.  Reports indicate that this
 region probably is being well organized in support of Communist activi-
 ties.
 The parties derive funds from external Communist sources as well
 as from their activities within Thailand.  The Soviet Legation reportedly
 imports currency in the diplomatic pouch for the financial support of
 Communist activities.  Also Chinese Communist officials are believed to
 have brought funds to Bangkok for CCP(T) operations.
 It is not clear, however, whether, on balance, the Communist
 movement in Thailand is the beneficiary of outside financial assistance
 or a source of revenue for other elements in the. world Communist con-
 spiracy.  The funds regularly solicited or extorted from Chinese residents
 in Thailand for transmission to Communist China could conceivably
 much larger than any funds received by the TCP and the CCP(T) from other
 parties.

 XII.  SOVIET SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 No Communist regime maintains a diplomatic establishment in
 Thailand except the Soviet Union.  The USSR is represented in Thailand
 by a Minister and Legation in Bangkok.  The Legation occupies 108
 Sathon Road, Bangkok, which formerly was a hotel building.  In addi-
 tion, 6 Krung Kasem Road houses the Eksporthleb Office and provides
 accommodations for the. business staff of Eksporthleb.  The offices of
 Sovexport Film and TASS are at 21 Tung Mahamek, Bangkok; each has a
 Russian representative in charge.  The ECAFE office in Bangkok usually
 has two Russian employees; in the past they had contacts with the Soviet
 Legation.
 The total number of Russians at the Legation, including families,.
 remains about 30 to 40, only five of whom claim diplomatic rank:  the-
 minister, three secretaries, and a.commercial attache.. The remainder
 of the Soviet Legation personnel are called "officials" on.their appli-
 cations for police identity cards, but it is assumed-that some of then
 have duties at least as important as the diplomats.  The business staff
 of Eksporthleb remains about two although the wives and older children
 of these officials occasionally work in the office.
 Since the Legation's overt activities, with the exception of
 official functions, are confined almost wholly to propaganda, it.is-
 believed most if not all of the personnel are engaged in propaganda
 activities.  The Soviet Legation issues a Thai-language semi-weekly
 bulletin on a rather irregular basis.  It is believed that certain books-
 containing basic Communist doctrine, which have appeared during the past
 several years, were subsidized by the Legation.  In addition, it is be-
 lieved that certain ideological instructions and special feature arti-
 cles are provided Thai fellow-traveler and Communist publications.-
 According to various reports, translations of such works have been done
 on a contract basis by Thai, several of whom are minor government offi
 cials..  It is likely that the Soviet Legation subsidizes certain Thai
 fellow-traveler publications since they obviously could not exist on
 receipts from their limited circulation and advertisement, and the Thai
 Communist Party is not believed to be able financially to support the
 large number of such publications being printed.
 The Eksporthleb office keeps close contact with the Legation and
 it is possible that income from Eksporthleb is utilized for subsidizing
 propaganda activity.  Certainly Eksporthleb's existence could not be
 justified by the extent of its business.

 XIII.  COIAMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 No Communist international organization maintains a branch
 office or other installation in Thailand, and no meetings of these
 organizations have been held within the country.  Local Communists and
 fellow-travelers, however, have attended meetings abroad to an increas-
 ingextent during the past two years.  Few if any of these delegates
 have returned to Thailand.  Recently, when members of the largest and
 the most publicized delegation to an international front meeting evaded
 police restrictions and departed for Peiping, the government announced
 that legal steps would be taken upon their return.  No funds are known
 to have been received by local Communists from international organiza-
 tions, but it seems probable that at least part of the, travel expenses
 of the representatives abroad is paid by international organizations.
 It is not known whether Thai organizations have contributed to the sup-
 port of Communist international organizations.
 Attendance of local Communists at meetings of international
 organizations held abroad is summarized below:

 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATIONS NET-WORK
 Bangkok is probably the center of the Communist communication.
 network in Thailand and may be the center for Southeast Asia.  Because
 use of regular mail is considered unsafe, the Communists rely on courier
 facilities and radio communication.  The Chinese Overseas Bookstore is
 reported to be the center of. communications between Bangkok and "under-
 ground" Communists in the provinces, and a CCP(T) courier system appears
 to be operating efficiently and regularly between Bangkok and Songkhla
 in southern Thailand.
 A clandestine radio network has reportedly been established by
 the Communists in Thailand, for both internal and external communication.
 Although non-government transmitters are illegal, a number are in
 operation, many of them owned and operated by Chinese commercial firms
 to transact' business outside the country.  Some of these Chinese-operated
 transmitters are. probably used by the CCP(T).Communists in Bangkok and
 .Hat Yai are reported to have radio communication with Penang, Kuala
 Lumpur, and Singapore.  Assertions that the Soviet Embassy operates a
 radio transmitter seem plausible but are thus far unconfirmed.
 The Chinese Communist Party in Thailand (CCP(T)), as a branch of
 the CCP in China, maintains close relations with the parent body.
 Without.. exception, the leaders of the CCP(T) have received training in
 China.  High-level Chinese Communist intelligence and propaganda offi-
 cials from a liaison office in China are frequently reported on covert
 visits to the CCP(T) organization in Bangkok and in the southern Thai
 provinces.  Although the precise pattern of external direction cannot
 be determined, rumors of reorganization of' the CCP(T), intensification
 of its propaganda and espionage activities, and fund-raising efforts
 frequently coincide with these reported visits.
 The Thai Communist Party (TCP), on the other hand, apparently has
 the most direct contact with the Soviet Legation in Bangkok of any Commu-
 nist group in-Thailand.

 Vietnamese Communist cells in eastern Thailand have closer ties
 with Viet Minh groups across the border than with China or the TCP.
 In the southern provinces, the Communist organization (predominantly
 Chinese) seems to coordinate its efforts with the guerrilla activities
 of the Malayan Communists, indicating direct cooperation between what
 are, in effect, two branches of the.CCP.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN JAPAN: OBJECTIVES, TACTICS,AND CAPABILITIES
 In compliance with the requirements of Soviet foreign policy,
 the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) currently seeks as its principal
 short-term objective to undermine the alliance between the United States
 and Japan.  In pursuit of this general objective, it seeks in particular
 to discredit the Japanese peace treaty, the agreements under which US
 forces are stationed'in Japan, and all efforts to improve Japan's
 capacity for self-defense.  Simultaneously, the party seeks to develop
 attitudes favorable to an orientation toward the USSR and Communist
 China or at least to promote and strengthen neutralist attitudes.
 The JCP does not ignore domestic objectives; rather it seeks as
 far as possible to link them to the-anti-US campaign.  Where the achieve-
 ment of a domestic goal conflicts with the policy dictated by the inter-
 national interests of the .USSR, it is the domestic goal that is
 sacrificed.  Barring a change in the international policy of the USSR,
 there appears to be no immediate liklihood that the JCP will alter its
 objectives or their relative priority rating.
 Simultaneously with the pursuit of its general objective, the
 party is embarked on the covert preparation of a para-military organiza-
 tion to be employed when and as required in the international interests
 of the USSR.
 The current program of the JCP is a dual operation in which a new
 policy involving extensive underground activity is being pursued side by
 side with an overt popular front policy.  The party is, thus:
 1. Attempting to secure the widest possible popular following, and
 2. Creating an underground apparatus, including a para-military
 organization, in preparation for the ultimate implementation of
 a program of violent action.
 A.  Popular Front Tactics
 The groups to which the Communist Party directs its appeals are
 so numerous as to include almost all Japanese except the large scale
 industrial and financial interests, the national leadership of the
 Liberal Party which controls the government, and to a lesser extent the
 leadership of the conservative-opposition Progressive Party.  The
 Communists have devoted particular attention to workers, farmers, youth,
 and intellectuals.

 Elements in the Japanese situation which the Communists seek to
 exploit in the effort to secure members and sympathizers and to cultivate
 attitudes favorable to the achievement of their objectives include:
 1.  Fear of war and, specifically, fear that Japan may become involved
 in war not in pursuit of its own interests but as an involuntary
 participant in the conflict between the US and the USSR.
 2.  Resentment of the US position in Japan including the presence of
 US troops, military activities involving interference with normal
 activities, and what may be regarded as US control of Japanese
 policy.
 3.  Fear of the economic burden imposed by defense measures and by
 curtailment of trade with Soviet bloc countries especially China.
 4.  Fear of retrogression toward reactionary government policies,
 repression of civil liberties, withdrawal of trade union rights,
 etc.
 5.     Desire to normalize diplomatic relations with countries still
 technically at war with Japan.
 The Japanese Party follows the familiar Communist tactics of:
 establishing front organizations, national and local, to cover the
 interests, aspirations, and activities of most of the major elements of
 society; linking such fronts in federations and congresses of various
 kinds; and utilizing the fronts to support the partyrs position on
 national and international issues.  In the schematic terms of the JCP
 program, the front groups would become components of the "National
 Liberation Democratic United Front" whose envisaged role is that of a
 popular base for the overthrow of the existing government and establish-
 ment of a people's revolutionary government.  At present probably the
 most active and effective front groups are those operating in the
 functional areas of promoting "peace" and relations with Communist
 China, especially those of trade.
 At present, of Japan's total union membership of approximately
 6 million, only 7% are believed to be Communist Party members or
 sympathizers.  The present capacity of the JCP to manipulate or benefit
 from the activities of the trade unions is therefore not a consequence
 of numerical strength or control of positions of leadership.  It arises
 rather from the fact that an important segment of labor's leadership,
 politically aligned with the left Socialist Party, supports policies
 closely parallel to many of the positions assumed by the JCP,
 particularly in the area of foreign policy.  In the face of this
 situation and in view of the JCP*s continuing incapacity to reassert

 SECRET - SECURITY INFOI3 ATION
 itself as an independent force in the Japanese trade union movement,
 the party appears to have dissolved what little remains of its own
 once-powerful trade union federation.  It now appears to be seeking to
 infiltrate Sohyo, the Left Socialist controlled federation which, with
 .a claimed membership of approximately 3 million, is the largest in
 Japan.
 The JCP has been active in national and local elections seeking
 to utilize the campaigns to:  seat Communists and sympathizers; promote
 propaganda objectives; and form alliances with other groups.  In they
 October 1952 election for the lower house, JCP overtures to other left-
 wing groups for a united front campaign were rebuffed; the party polled
 only 2.5% of the total popular vote; and it failed to seat a single
 candidate.
 B.  Underground Tactics
 The JCP program for underground para-military action apparently
 envisages a three-stage development:
 1.   Establishment of an organization to plan and carry out violent
 action, subversion, and sabotage, training of cadres for these
 purposes and their organization into a national network, and
 indoctrination of the masses with the.necessity of armed action;
 2.   Formation of armed "resistance" and "self-defense" organizations
 among workers and farmers and conduct of local partisan
 activities involving initially sabotage and harassment and
 ultimately attacks on military facilities and equipment;
 3.   Conversion of these "resistance" and "self-defense" organizations
 into a revolutionary "people's army" to carry out a general armed
 uprising.
 The party is now engaged in the first of these phases and has
 probably made only limited progress toward its objectives.  Nevertheless
 in the first half of 1952, the party carried on a campaign of violent
 action which demonstrated the existence of well-organized and trained
 action squads.  Since mid-1952 however, in accordance with party directions
 to avoid actions that would alienate the masses, there has been no
 significant mass violence although continued espionage and sabotage
 efforts have been reported.
 So long as the party is able to continue on a legal entity, its
 overt organization, its "front groups," its limited penetration of
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 non-Communist organizations and parties, and its participation in
 orthodox political activities enables the party to continue its efforts
 to encourage popular discontents and divide the Japanese from their govern-
 ment and its policies.   The party's efforts in this regard are facili-
 tated by its ability to exploit the frequent parallels existing between
 its own position and that of groups and organizations, particularly of
 the Socialist left, not subject to direct Communist influence and
 control.  Also, despite the widespread popular support presently accorded
 to Japan's present policy of close alignment with the US, the Party
 is able to exploit dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the peace
 and security treaties and with present restraints on mainland trade.
 Present evidence indicates that the JCP including its under-
 ground organization now has a significant potential for espionage,.
 'sabotage, and propaganda, as well as for promoting at least limited and
 sporadic incidents of mass violence.  The party is not believed capable
 of undertaking armed insurrection without external military assistance. The
 covert Communist para-military organization could, however, provide
 valuable assistance to an external attack upon Japan.
 A number of factors appear to work against any great increase
 in the overt or covert capabilities of the JCP.  Official restraints
 on party activities may be expected to become more effective as
 Japanese police and intelligence services are strengthened and further
 suppressive measures maybe undertaken, particularly if the party again
 resorts to violence or other forceful activities that disturb the public
 peace.  The party's open identification with and virtual subordination
 to the interests and policies of the Soviet Union and its doctrinaire
 insistance upon certain manifestly unpopular policies -- notably the
 demand for overthrow of the Emperor system -- limit the party's
 general popular appeal and make unlikely possibilities of fruitful, if
 transient cooperation, with extreme rightist elements.  Finally, even
 the present limited continuance of illegal and violent activities, in
 the light of popular revulsion against the party's militant program during
 the first half of 1952, serves to undercut its efforts of exploiting
 and developing Japanese discontent under conditions of close alignment
 with and dependence upon the United States.  These limitations upon JCP
 capabilities extend to its efforts to recoup electoral support for the
 party and to infiltrate and gain control over the trade union movement
 and non-Communist left wing organizations and parties.
 In sum the JCP has the capacity to exploit, intensify, or keep
 alive friction between the US and Japan.  It does not, however, have the
 capacity seriously to undermine the US-Japanese alliance.  While the
 creation of an underground structure including a para-military organiza-
 tion has given the JCP a greater capacity to resist suppression and to

 national Communism, the party should not within the foreseeable future
 become capable of sustained armed insurrection without external military
 assistance.

 COMMUNISM IN JAPAN:  ASSETS
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 A.  JCP Membership and Following
 As of July 1952, the officially registered membership of the
 JCP was 48,596.1     This represented-a decline of approximately
 60,000 (or more than 53 percent) since February 1950, when the
 partyts registered membership had reached its postwar peak of
 108,593;  this membership continued to drop through mid-1952,
 although the downward trend appeared to have slowed down during the
 first half of 1952 (the decline during that period was 2,500) as
 compared with that in 1950 (43,500) and 1951 (18,000).2
 In addition to registered members, it is estimated that there
 are 30,000-$5,000 unregistered or secret JCP members.  Most of these
 probably are former registered party members whose resignations or
 explusions were actually faked.  These unregistered members are
 probably equally subject to party direction and discipline.  The total

 of registered and unregistered or secret members thus is probably
 between 80-85,000 persons.
 The JCP is believed to have imposed stricter admission
 qualifications and security precautions on prospective members than
 in the past.  Thus, the apparent decline in the overt membership
 would not, from the party's viewpoint, necessarily indicate a loss
 but, rather, may suggest a strengthening of effective control and
 discipline over its membership.
 The JCP following includes:  1)  An estimated 100,000
 to 250,000 non-member sympathizers who actively participate in
 Communist-sponsored movements.  2)   An estimated 500,000 to
 650,000 "leftists" who may be classed as "passive" sympathizers
 through their occasional participation in pro-Communist movements.
 Altogether, it is estimated that one million persons are
 strongly influenced or under Communist Party control.  This total
 is slightly over two percent of the total adult population and
 corresponds roughly with the number of votes cast for Communist
 and fellow travelers in the recent election.
 B.  Geographic Distribution and Class Composition
 Party membership and sympathizers are concentrated in the
 major metropolitan areas, notably the two-primary industrial centers
 of Tokyo-Yokohama and Osaka-Kobe.  (Tokyo alone has 16,000 known
 party members.)  The northern island of Hokkaido, three prefectures
 in central and northern Japan (Nagano, Gumma; and Niigata, and
 northern Kyushu) are other leading areas of concentration.  In
 general, the party's centers of strength are urban and its areas
 of weakness rural.
 The classes from which the bulk of party membership and
 following is drawn has been estimated recently as follows -- an
 estimate generally in alignment with class breakdowns applicable
 to. party membership as of December 1951:
 1.   These figures apply to Japanese.  In addition there are an
 estimated 80,000 active and 350,000 passive supporters. among
 the Korean minority. (See III C, p. 8.)

 50 percent from Japanese intellectual, professional
 and white collar groups;
 30 percent from industrial workers;
 10 percent from rural workers;
 10 percent others (e.g., national minorities, unemployed,
 eta -- outcaste class --, etc.)
 The age breakdown of party membership has been estimated
 recently as follows:  under 20 years, 18 percent;  20-29 years,
 37 percent;  30-39 years, 24 percent;  40-49 years, 12 percent;
 50-59 years, 6.5 percent;  above 60 years, 2.5 percent.  The
 average length of party membership is estimated to be three to
 four years.
 C.  Quality of Party Membership
 The improvement of the quality of membership is currently one of
 the party's major internal problems.  From 1945 through early
 1950, the party, is keeping with its posture as a bona fide
 political party, operated on a mass membership policy. -Since
 Cominform criticism of its policies in January 1950, and
 especially since the revision of party. rules and regulations in
 early 1951, the party has sought to weed out unreliables, indoctrin-
 ate the remainder more thoroughly, and in general convert itself
 into a hard-core organization.  The extent of this task is suggested
 by the fact that the great bulk of its membership has. joined the
 party since the surrender.  Even allowing for additional secret
 members in the period 1945-1950, it is apparent that the vast
 majority of the membership is comparatively young in age and in
 experience in party organizations and activities.
 The quality of the membership in terms of its capacity for
 following abrupt changes in the party line has not been put to test
 recently.  However, the Cominform criticism resulted in internal
 dissension of such bitterness as to support a supposition that the
 party, despite the overt. reconciliation of differences in the new
 program announced in late 1951, might again show internal fractures
 in the event of a change of line.
 The new program, with its dualism of "legal," overt activity
 and of underground preparation for violence, has provided other
 tests of the quality of.the membership.  That the party has an
 efficient underground apparatus, that it has mounted violent
 demonstrations, that it is organizing pare-military units bespeak
 a significant degree of readiness to risk or incur hardships in the
 course of illegal action.  At the same time, the overt warning
 carried in the Cominform journal in mid-1952 against excessive
 violence of the sort perpetrated that spring, and the circumstances
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 surrounding that warning suggest that significant elements of the
 party, perhaps including its top leadership, lack the sophistication
 and discipline demanded by the program.
 D.  Quality of Party Leadership
 The top leadership of the party, generally confined to prewar
 Communists, is considered to be of fairly high quality.  It includes
 persons trained in Moscow and comprises those hardened through years
 of repression and adversity.  Nearly all of this level of leadership
 is now underground, where, despite deficiencies of the sort previously
 mentioned, the development of an efficient organization gives testi-
 mony to their administrative capability.  Opportunists and dilettantes
 are believed to have been generally weeded out.  However, the leader-
 ship may be evaluated as relatively weak in its capacity to comprehend
 and handle ideological matters.  The leadership failed to adjust its
 policies despite clear tokens of Moscow's displeasure before the
 publication of the Cominform criticism;  it failed to resolve the
 theoretical differences in which the party schism thereafter focussed
 for more than a year; and its level of ideological discussion has
 invariably been low.
 The leadership of the overt organization consists of thIrd-
 rate figureheads.
 The core of the party -_ those party members at all levels
 who carry the principal burden of leadership and crganizational
 activity and who may be expected to continue party activities under
 most adverse conditions and abrupt changes in line -- may be
 estimated at approximately 25,000.

 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 In the October 1952 House of Representatives general election,
 the JCP nominated one candidate each in all but 10 of the 117 election
 districts.  These candidates polled 897,000 votes, or approximately
 2.5 percent of the total valid ballots as compared with 2,985.,000 votes
 (9.7%) for JCP candidates in January 1949.  None of the JCP candidates
 was successful in 1952, while 35 had been returned in 1949.
 The JCP officially recommended 9 non-communist candidates,
 one each in 9 of the 10 districts in which no JCP candidates were
 entered.  These recommended candidates, (four running under their
 party labels; five as independents) received a total of 200,000 votes
 and only one was successful.  The portion of this vote attributable
 to Communist support cannot be isolated.  However, the JCP added this
 total to the 897,000 won by its own candidates to attain its claim of
 1.1 million pro-Communist votes.
 The JCP also identified a list of 12 candidates (four
 Progressive, five Left Socialists, and one Right Socialist, one
 Labor-Farmer, and one independent) as "Patriotic candidates,"
 signifying their general acceptability, although all but one of these
 twelve competed with the Party's own candidates.  These twelve
 received a total of 475,000 votes.  Ten of these twelve were success-
 ful.
 Beyond this it is difficult to identify candidates who may
 be labeled fellow-travelers in some degree.  Only-Labor-Farmer
 candidates who received an aggregate of 261,000 votes may be regarded
 collectively as pro-Communist oriented.  Two Labor-Farmer candidates
 had JCP support or approval.
 The Left Socialist Party whose policy toward relations with
 the U.S. security arrangements, rearmament, etc., is very similar
 to that-of the JCP, officially spurned the JCP' s "united front"
 platform. In any event, close cooperation between the two parties
 would probably have been unlikely in most of the some 80 election
 districts where they both nominated candidates.  Only in four
 districts are Conununits known to have obtained more votes than their
 Left Socialist rivals.  (Six Left Socialist candidates had JCP
 support or approval).  On the other hand, it is conceivable that
 Communist and Left Socialist votes were "pooled" in the 30 districts
 where the Left Socialists had no candidates but the Communists
 did.  In the Third District of Hokkaido, neither the Left Socialists
 nor the Communists nominated a candidate and it is probable that at
 least some of their support went to the Labor-Farmer candidate.

 Alth.ough the JCP has claimed partial credit for the electoral
 advance of the Left Socialist Party as a group (3,494-,000 votes,
 54 seats), the degree to which this claim might be justified cannot
 be judged.  The following table presents a comparison of communist
 electoral strength with the strength of other major parties:

 Slightly less than one-third (31%) of the Communist vote in
 October 1952 came from urban areas (comprising the entire prefectures
 of Tokyo and Osaka plus the districts in which are located the larger
 cities, namely, Nagoya, Yokohama, Kobe, Kyoto, Sendai and Fukuoka),
 and over two-thirds, from the rural districts.    The ratio of urban
 vote was exceeded only by that of the Right Socialists (36%); the
 Liberal Party drew 15% of its vote from the urban districts, the
 Progressives, 14%, and the Left Socialists 21%.
 Numerically, the heaviest Communist vote was found in Tokyo
 Metropolis and Osaka Prefecture.  In Tokyo where the total valid
 ballots numbered 2,480,000, the Communists polled more than 93,000
 (3.7%), as compared with 1,025,000 votes (41.30) for the Liberals,
 562,000 (22.7%) for the Right Socialists, 312,000 (12.60) for the
 Progressives, and 303,000 (12.2%) for the Left Socialists.  In
 Osaka Prefecture, Communist candidates obtained 91,500 votes (6.00)
 out of 1,503,000 valid ballots; in the same prefecture, the Liberals
 again received a plurality of 690,000 votes (45.9%), followed by
 the Right Socialists (288,000 -- 19.1%), the. Progressives (248,000 --
 16.5%), and the Left Socialists (149,000 -- 9.9%).  In the four
 major cities other than Osaka and Tokyo, Communist returns were as
 follows:

 Of the rural prefectures, where conservative parties without
 exception returned large majorities, Nagano had numerically the
 largest Communist vote (46,700 -- 4.97).  In Hokkaido, Communist
 candidates polled 42,500 votes (2.9%), while the Labor-Farmer Party
 obtained nearly 110,000. votes (6.77).  The vote for Communist and
 Labor-Farmer candidates was significant in two other prefectures:
 Okayama (Communist -- 21,000 or 2.8% and Labor Farmer -- 82,500
 or 11.3%) and Ibaraki (Communist -- 20,000, or 2.4% and Labor Farmer --
 54,000 or 6.0).
 The JCP's very poor showing as compared with previous
 performances cannot be attributed to diminution of Communist interest
 in election activities except in the indirect sense that:
 1)              abandonment of the Nozaka line altered the position
 of parliamentary tactics in the hierarchy of Japanese
 Communist values;
 2)              the campaign of violence that for a time appeared to
 be the most conspicious expression of the new line,
 although terminated well before the election,
 alienated a large number of former party supporters.
 In the self-criticism in which it has engaged since the
 election, the JCP has not disavowed its basic campaign strategy --
 the attempt to secure a united front, primarily with the Left
 Socialists but also with other groups, on the basis of neutralism,
 antiAmericanism, and opposition to rearmament.  Self-criticism
 has instead focused on tactics and has indicated that the Communists
 find themselves guilty of:  attempting to impose revolutionary
 activity on the people prematurely;  failing to clarify to the
 people the party's role as the protector of their daily interests;
 and failing to integrate the struggle to achieve current popular
 objectives of various classes and interest groups with the struggle
 for an "anti-imperialist" popular front.  In a recent enunciation
 of the party's campaign policies to be followed in the forthcoming
 election for half the members of the upper house, scheduled for
 May, 1953, it is emphasized that the party "must support, encourage,
 and endeavor to join hands with each and every political force that
 is opposed to the Yoshida Administration."

 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 Violent action has become an important policy and organizational
 question for the JCP only relatively recently.  The Cominform criticism
 in January 1950 of the party's theory of peaceful revolution, and more
 particularly the new party program of late 1951 and accompanying covert
 policy statements, made it clear that underground preparation for vio-
 lent action was to be undertaken concurrently with implementation of the
 above-ground united front program.  The fact that the party is now   .
 partly underground and that its program demands a continuation of legal
 and illegal, overt and covert operations makes it difficult to isolate
 the party's organization for violent action from its total organization,
 although the policy concerning violent action has become relatively
 clear.
 A.  Current Party Policy on Use of Violence
 By contrast with policy on preparation for violence, policy on
 use of violence was not explicitly indicated in Cominform criticism,
 the new party program, or accompanying covert statements.  However,
 organized violence soon became a prominent feature of Communist-led
 demonstrations.  This militancy began with an attack on US military
 personnel during a Communist demonstration in Tokyo on May 30, 1950, and
 reached its peak during the first half of 1952 when a series of armed
 clashes with the Japanese police occurred in many parts of the country.
 Episodes of mass violence on February 21, May 1, and May 30, 1952 gave
 evidence of participation by well-organized and trained Communist action
 squads.  During the same period and previously there were also numerous
 episodes involving organized civil violence on a smaller scale, such as
 police harrassment and demonstrations against tax and grain collection.
 In July, however, an article in the Cominform journal attributed
 to TOKUDA Kyuichi, secretary-general who has been underground since
 mid-1950, in effect criticized resort to violence of a character that
 would alienate the party from the masses.  Since then, there has been
 no significant mass violence, although continued efforts in. the line
 of espionage and sabotage' have been reported.  Labor disputes, even in
 those unions subject to Communist direction or strong influence, have
 not been marked by violence.  Party statements on the matter imply that
 resort to mass violence has not been repudiated in principle, but de-
 clared premature and inexpedient under present circumstances.
 Armed insurrection is the ultimate goal of the JCP's "Military
 Policy," but the achievement of this goal is placed in the distant
 future and is declared attainable only after the populace has been
 thoroughly won over to the popular front and been made ready for a
 general uprising under the leadership of the party.

 B. Party Organization for Planning and Execution of Violent Activities
 1.  Organization.     The party's organization for violent action is a
 part of its underground organization which, since 1950, by all evidence
 has become the central machinery of the party, including its overt
 organization and operations.       The JCP Central Committee, whose members
 were purged in 1950, has never been restaffed in the overt structure
 of the party.  Instead a covert "Political Bureau," staffed by purged
 members of the former Central Committee and other selected leaders, is
 secretly directing the legal Central Guidance Department and coordinating
 the overt and covert activities of the party from the underground.
 Under these covert executive bodies the party has evidently developed
 a nation-wide underground structure parallel to, and closely coordinated
 with, the existing legal organization.  Most recent information on the
 structure of the covert organization reveals that while the regional,
 p efectural, district, and cell chain of command of the overt organiza-
 ti% n is retained, regional boundaries have been revised and six region-
 al subdivisions (as compared to nine in the overt structure) are now
 .controlled by organs designated as "bureaus" to distinguish them from
 the regional committees of the overt structure.  The number of members
 in each of the new regional bureaus is set at five, as compared with
 some twenty members in each of the regional committees.  A similar
 reduction in the number of members in the covert prefectural committees
 has been reported.  In general, the organs of the underground apparatus
 are considerably smaller and more efficiently organized in order to
 insure security.
 In the evolution of a covert structure, the JCP has given
 special emphasis to the development of a para-military organization
 which would be capable of planning and executing a program of violence
 under the over-all direction of the underground "Political Bureau."
 Information. to date indicates that the para-military organization is
 composed of:
 1)   The "Military Affairs Committee" (also called the
 "Y Organization").  This committee, apparently
 established in mid-1951 directly under the covert
 Political Bureau, constitutes a covert central ad-
 ministration to plan and operate a program for
 para-military organization and action, espionage,
 and subversion.  It is believed to include specia-
 lized units designated Yl, Y2, Y3, Y4, and Y5 for
 operations directed, respectively, against Japanese
 security forces, civil police and investigative
 agencies, US forces, industrial targets, and military
 bases.  Y4 is also reportedly charged with direction
 of the nuclear self'-defense corps.

 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 2)  Local counterparts of Military Affairs Committee.
 Agencies planned, though not yet reported as in
 being, to direct and coordinate actual operations
 at local levels, and responsible to the central
 Military Affairs Committee.
 3)  Nuclear Self-Defense Corps (Chukaku jiei tai).
 Action groups composed of up to 10 militant, able-
 bodied, disciplined party members, organized in
 factories, villages, towns, schools, to conduct
 agitation, sabotage, and harrassment; also to
 develop larger bodies of militants from among
 populace.
 Available evidence indicates that the JCP covert organization
 for the execution of its violent action programs is still in the pro-
 cess of establishment, although the party has made significant advances
 in this direction since 1950.  In the case of the nuclear self defense
 corps -- the basic units of the organization for militant action --
 estimates as of May 1952, on the basis of data obtained in a few pre-
 fectures, placed the total membership at between two and three thousand.
 Later estimates range up to 16 thousand for those who have received
 some form of para-military training.  On the whole, it seems probable
 that establishment of the corps and of the lower echelons of the "Y
 organization" has taken place only in limited areas and that a nation-
 wide network of such units does not yet exist.  Similarly, gradual
 progress appears to.have characterized the development of a cadre to
 direct the activities of the various military units.
 On the basis of scattered reports, centers of strength appear
 to be the major industrial areas of Tokyo-Yokohama, Osaka-Kobe, and
 northern Kyushu, and in Hokkaido.
 2.   Quality of leadership, mobility, available arms and equipment.
 High quality leadership is believed to be scarce, and limited for the
 most part to the top echelons of party pars-military structure.  A
 number of factors indicate that leadership on the lower, operating
 levels is at a premium:  the party's military program has been in effect
 for only a little more than a year; it demands a structure of scope and
 character which the party has never had in the past; implementation of
 the program has been accompanied by frequent indications that the devel-
 opment of competent cadre is a prime problem; and present JCP policy,
 which envisages an interweaving of its military-action and political-
 action programs, demands a high level of sophistication and discipline
 of its personnel.
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Mobility is not believed to be a prime objective of present JCP
 military planning, which envisages rather a network of small local
 units mobile only within a limited area.
 Arms and equipment presently available consist of relatively few
 firearms and of crude though effective weapons of harrassment, sabotage,
 and street fighting, such as gasoline-filled bottles, teargas, time-
 bombs, hand grenades, and tire-punching tools.
 3.  Plans and capabilities.  Present indications are that the current
 stage of JCP organization for violent action is such as to restrict its
 use to more limited programs of sabotage and the instigation and leader-
 ship of relatively sporadic incidents of mass violence.  It is believed
 that the principal task of such para-military organizations as are in
 being include training, organization, and self-development, espionage,
 and non-violent agitation.  Undoubtedly, members of the para-military
 organizations also serve as integral parts of the underground security
 system protecting the missing top-level leaders.
 In part, the limited nature of the JCP organization for violent
 action when compared with the eventual-goal of "armed revolution" is
 reflected in the militant action program as envisaged by the party
 itself; without setting any precise time-table for the fulfillment of
 its plans, the party apparently envisages three stages of development:
 1) The establishment of the Military Affairs Committee
 and its local counterparts and creation of the
 nuclear self-defense corps and their organization
 into a national network.  Simultaneously, the
 masses are to be prepared psychologically to accept
 the necessity of armed action.  Only this stage
 appears to be regarded as current.
 2)  Formation of armed "resistance" and "self-defense"
 organizations among the workers and farmers; con-
 duct of partisan activities in localized sectors,
 initially involving sabotage and harrassment and
 ultimately attacks on military facilities and
 equipment.
 3)  Conversion of these "resistance" and "self-defense"
 organizations into a revolutionary "people's army"
 to carry out a general armed uprising.
 Whatever its expectations, the capabilities of the JCP for ex-
 panding the organization for violent action and for advancing the pace
 of its plans in this regard appear relatively limited under conditions
 currently prevailing.

 Apart from the increasing effectiveness of Japanese government
 countermeasures, the present level of economic activity and living
 standards, the prevailing Japanese support for Western alignment and
 suspicion of the Communist bloc, the current disrepute of the JCP, and
 the greater attraction and greater feasibility of alternative methods
 of seeking personal, group, and national objectives all. militate
 against conclusion of the first phase let alone transition to the
 second.  Nevertheless, the JCP undoubtedly has the capability further
 to expand, organize, and consolidate small action units composed of
 present members of the party, and to enhance their capacities for
 terrorism and other more or less limited subversive activities.
 At present, however, Communist policy appears to recognize that
 progress in the pare-military program to embrace significant elements
 of the population not now Communist-inclined necessitates a wider and
 more profound popular disaffection with the Japanese government and
 its policies and, indeed, the structure of Japanese society itself.
 Moreover, such progress neoess_itates avoidance of actions bringing
 severe and widespread popular censure on the party.

 C. JCP Ability to Rally Elements of the Population to Violent Action
 Despite the party's preparation for violent action, its
 capacities for such actions have not been tested since mid-1952.  The
 Communist-led episodes of mass violence in the spring of 1952 demon-
 strated a high quality of leadership insofar as the organizing and
 directing of demonstrations involving the use of force is concerned.
 They also demonstrated that the party apparatus possessed a store of
 crude though effective weapons for street fighting.  Finally,. they
 indicated that the party had a sizeable force available for mass
 violence.
 That the party since mid-1952 has improved its organizational
 and leadership for violent action seems altogether likely in view of
 policy emphasis on such preparation.  It also seems likely that the
 party has made progress in equipping itself for violent action, es-
 pecially in view of repeated reports of secret party pamphlets and
 instructions dealing with the tactics of and the manufacture of wea-
 pons for street fighting.  (There is, however, no reason to believe
 that the party has any significant stock of firearms.)  On the other
 hand, such advances have probably been at least offset, if not out-
 weighed, by advances in the over-all efficiency of the civil police
 and in at least the size and equipment of the National Safety Force,
 a nuclear army trained among other things to cope with civil insur-
 rection.
 Accordingly, the Communist capacity for mass violence would
 seem to rest largely with the quality and numbers of the human
 resources at the party's command and on the character and circumstances
 of the action.
 In general, the Japanese body politic at present includes few
 elements sufficiently disaffected to be led into violence without
 previous training and/or incorporation into.the party's apparatus.
 Thus, the party cannot count on converting mass demonstrations sponsored
 by non-Communist groups into violent demonstrations.  The 7,000 parti-
 cipants in the Tokyo May 1 riot of 1952 represented roughly two percent
 of the estimated three or four hundred thousand persons participating;
 throughout the nation some 35,000 took part in violence out of the
 total of 1,000,000 leftists and labor union members assembled.  The
 most volatile elements are found in the Korean minority, the radical
 wing of the student group, and to some extent the day-labor ("free"
 labor) group.  These elements have been drawn into Communist-inspired
 violence either by prearrangement or because their smaller-scale
 demonstrations have proved susceptible to Communist exploitation.
 Where the party itself has. sought to generate mass demonstra-
 tions including violence, as opposed to exploiting occasions sponsored
 by other groups, the results have been far less impressive.  The

 In these terms, the JCP has the following assets;
 1)   An estimated several thousand, at a minimum,
 organized in nuclear self-defense or similar
 corps.   Estimates of numbers trained in some
 form of para-military exercise range to 16,000.
 2)   An estimated 80-85,000 party members, of whom
 perhaps a half might be considered to be of
 superior quality in terms of loyalty and disoi-
 pline.                                                  (The size of the party's underground is
 estimated at around 30,000.)
 4)   An estimated 500-650,000 passive supporters,
 comprising those who occasionally or in varying
 degrees support the JCP or JCP front activities.
 An estimated 100-250,000 active supporters,
 comprising those who consistently play an active
 role in supporting JCP programs and activities,
 to whom an estimated 80,000 members of the
 Korean minority may be added.
 observance of the "Third Anti-Colonialization Struggle Day" on
 February 21, 1952, brought out a total of some 6,000 leftists in rallies
 and demonstrations in 26 different localities throughout the country.
 Disturbances occurred chiefly in Tokyo, where about 900 out of an esti-
 mated total of 3,000 demonstrators were involved in rioting.  In a pre-
 May Day rally in Tokyo on April 26, 1952 approximately 1,000 laborers,
 students and Korean clashed with the police.  On May 30, 1952, the JCP
 attempted under the guise of an anniversary celebration for Japan's
 "labor martyrs" to stage a repetition of the May 1 display of mass
 violence.  JCP directives reportedly called for a "nation-wide armed
 struggle" and ordered "action corps" to execute raids against police
 stations and tax offices.  Demonstrations took place in various parts
 of the country but large numbers were not mobilized and nothing approach-
 ing the party's professed goal materialized.  Again the most serious in-
 cidents took place in Tokyo where roughly 1,000 demonstrators fought
 with police.
 Assuming continued economic and political stability in Japan,
 the JCP in the foreseeable future is likely to prove no better able
 than in the past to rally significant, non-Communist elements of the
 population to mass violence -- especially as the public and the police
 have now been alerted by the violence of last spring.  Accordingly, its
 future capacities for mass violence will depend largely on the human
 resources it is able to marshall under its own standard.

 To these may be added perhaps 350,000 comprising
 the adult portion of those registered as north
 Koreans (400,000) plus those believed to be north-
 Koreans among the unregistered (estimated 200,000).
 While the foregoing elements to some extent would overlap, they
 provide a rough idea of the pattern of present party support.  This
 pattern has developed under circumstances in which the party has re-
 mained legal, its activities have been preponderantly non-violent, and
 the chief pressures against it have been those of public opprobrium as
 contrasted with the pervasive police repression of the prewar period.
 Thus it is believed that only a minor portion of the million or more
 listed as party supporters or sympathizers constitutes the party's man-
 power for violent action.
 Accordingly it is estimated that. at present, under optimum oondi-
 tions, the party could order out between 20,000 and 50,000 to execute
 acts of violence in connection with mass demonstrations, although con-
 siderably more might be brought out to participate non-violently.
 Where Korean issues are prominent these totals might be augmented by
 elements from among the north Korean active supporters of the JCP.
 This is based in part on the participation in violence on May 1, 1952,
 and in part on the estimates of the party's hard core which is assumed
 to include.its para-military forces.
 It is believed that for violent action of guerrilla or insurrec-
 tionary nature, the party's potential might range initially between
 16,000 and 20,000.  This is based on estimates of para-military forces
 with some allowance for progress and also for party elements not re-
 gularly engaged in para-military training which might readily be
 assimilated into such action.  If this action were called for in con-
 nection with external attack, the figure might multiply in, the event,
 that a Communist takeover seemed assured of success.  The increments
 would be drawn from the membership of the party and its active sup-
 porters who might render effective services in the form of sabotage and
 harrassment.

 The post-treaty Japanese Government has made clear its
 hostility to Communism and its intention at least to maintain the
 restrictive policies it previously had followed under occupation
 direction.  These policies, although neither as comprehensive nor
 as effective as the pre-surrender government's program of repression,
 nevertheless have limited the party's capabilities and have forced
 it to seek greater protection underground and to rely more heavily
 on front organizations.
 The legal basis of such political freedom of action as the
 party and its fronts possess rests on broad constitutional and
 statutory protections introduced during the occupation and designed,
 like similar protections in the US, to foster and safeguard political
 rights.  Particularly during the latter half of the- occupation,
 however, activities of the party and its fronts were severely circum-
 scribed by the operation of supra-constitutional regulations laid
 down by the occupying authorities under powers stemming legally from
 the terms of surrender.  The top leadership of the party was driven
 underground, the publication and distribution of major party organs
 banned, and other disabilities imposed under these regulations.
 Despite such disabilities, the JCP remained a legal political party,
 represented in the Diet, and continued to carry on a variety of both
 legal and illegal political activities.
 Since the end of the occupation on April 28, 1952, the party's
 freedom of action has continued to be limited.  Laws passed during
 the occupation including provisions designed to bar Communit s from
 governmental employment remain in force.  Some-of the occupation
 restrictions have been carried on in newly enacted legislation.
 Almost all local governments have passed laws for the maintenance of
 public peace which have acted to curb Communist demonstrations.
 The question of whether those charged with offenses against occupa-
 tion regulations -- notably including the party's top leadership
 underground for two and a half years -- still remain liable to criminal
 prosecution in post-treaty Japan is now under judicial review.
 The most important new law has been the Anti-Subversive
 Activities Law, Passed in July 1952.  This law, an adjunct to the
 Criminal Code.and designed to suppress organized threats to the
 government,' permits the government to prohibit the publication and
 distribution of subversive literature, to suspend or dissolve
 subversive groups posing a clear threat of violence, and to take
 action against officers and members of .such groups.  The law, however,
 contains provisions which aim to inhibit arbitrary exercise of these
 powers.  Perhaps in part for this reason, the government has moved
 very cautiously in implementing the law;  only two persons have been
 reported indicted under the law, and no convictions have been reported
 to date.

 In more general terms, the Communists have derived some
 advantage from the difficulties besetting law enforcement and judicial
 agencies now operating within a social and political' structure less
 amenable than.in pre-surrender days to tight control.  Comprehensive
 anti-Communist measures have been opposed by a variety of groups, not
 confined to those of leftist persuasion, for such reasons as fear CC
 governmental abuses, reluctance to antagonize the Soviet bloc, and
 belief that the Communists would be less controllable if driven under-
 ground completely.
 On the other hand, new law enforcement and intelligence
 agencies have been added to the existing surveillance and control
 network, and the police organization has been trained specifically to
 meet Communist-inspired disturbances.  The government is also sponsor-
 ing, officially and unofficially, counter-propaganda campaigns.  The
 party's loss of official representation in the Diet's Lower House as
 a result of the October elections deprived it of an advantageous
 national forum.  In addition to this evidence of a dropping-off in
 the party's popular support, opposition to official restrictive
 measures now may be less effective because of popular reaction to
 Communist-inspired violence during the first half of 1952.
 The threat posed by governmental restrictions has caused the
 JCP to concentrate on developing an efficient underground organiza-
 tion and to emphasize front activities.  The capability of the under-
 ground for circumventing governmental control measures is indicated
 by the fact that out of nine well-known, top echelon leaders of the
 JCP wanted by the police, only one has been apprehended after over
 two and a half years of intensive investigation.  Another indication
 is the ability of the underground party press to publish illegal
 newspapers and pamphlets despite repeated efforts of the police to
 suppress its operation.  The party's increased emphasis on fronts has
 also complicated the problems of governmental control agencies.  The
 effectiveness of front activities, however, has been reduced by greater
 public alertness and by counter-propaganda.
 The freedom of action of the party and its fronts seems likely
 to be circumscribed more narrowly in the near future, although the
 party will probably not be outlawed.  It seems probable that the
 government will:  1)  introduce new restrictive legislation, perhaps
 including a bill regulating mass demonstrations that would standard-
 ize local regulations;  2)  apply less cautiously existing legisla-
 tion such as the Anti-Subversive Activities Law;  3)  emphasize
 "preventive" action in the operation of its control network; and 4)
 step up its counter-propaganda activities, possibly by stronger appeals
 to nationalist sentiment.
 The government at present has the power to maintain surveillance
 and control over overt activities.  Its capacities for dealing with
 covert activities are less complete, due in part to inadequacies in
 its intelligence system.  Its police and military forces are capable
 of coping effectively with mass violence and armed insurrection,
 although the party could undoubtedly launch, and for sometime sustain,
 a program of limited and sporadic sabotage and small-scale violence.

 V. COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 No estimates are available for the number of Communists
 or sympathizers employed in specific key industries,  Roughly ten
 percent (153,000) of the workers in heavy industries and in coal
 and metal mining are believed to be Communists.  The major trade
 unions in these industries, however are not Communist controlled.
 Since, apart from heavy industries and coal and metal mining, the
 major focus of Communist influence is among government office
 workers union, the overall proportion of Communists in all key
 industries (mining, chemicals, primary metals, transportation,
 communications, and other public utilities) probably is not
 significantly greater than 7 percent.
 Only three unions in key industries may be considered to be
 nationally controlled by the JCP:  1)  the All Communications
 Workers Union (600); 2) the All Japan Metal Workers Union (27,000);
 and 3) the Council of Greater Chemical Industry Workers Union
 (5,000).      In addition to the three unions above comprising a member-
 ship of 32,600, there are five unions with a total membership of
 115,000 that are not controlled but are strongly influenced by the
 JCP on the national level.  The ratio of C oamunists to non-Communists
 in these unions is unknown.
 There are four major unions in key industries with a total.
 membership of 850,000 whose policies have paralleled those advocated
 by the JCP.  The leadership of these unions is almost exclusively
 in the hands of trade unionists closely supporting Left Socialist
 Party programs.  There is no conclusive evidence as to whether the
 close parallel between the policies and actions of these unions and
 that of the JCP is a consequence of a positive pro-Communist orienta-
 tion on the part of   nominally non-Communist leaders, or of their
 strong Left Socialist bias. The JCP has consistently attempted to
 exploit this parallelism, whatever its origins, and through it to
 advance its tactic of- infiltration into non.. -Communist unions.
 Since the period 1948-50 when overt Communist membership and
 influence was virtually extinguished by the anti-Communist drive in
 Japanese trade unions, the JCP has been unable to regain the degree
 of leadership and control exercised before that date.  Despite
 indications that left-wing trade unions are aware of the threat of
 Communist exploitation and infiltration and despite a resurgent
 anti-Communist movement among Right Socialist trade unionists, the
 parallel between Communist policies and programs and those of non-
 C omnunist, left wing trade unionists does render a major segment of
 organized labor vulnerable to Communist tactics of propagandistic
 exploitation and of infiltration of membership and leadership.

 VI. COIAMSNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND
 PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 The same threat to its legal existence that caused the JCP
 to develop and strengthen its underground organization has led the
 party to emphasize front activities in an attempt to circumvent
 repression.  While front organizations have always played an
 important role in the Communist program of propaganda and agitation
 among the populace, they have recently been given more attention
 by the JCP.  Party directives issued late in 1952 have called upon
 party members to exert tighter control over leading front organiza
 tions at the policy level.  The usefulness of these organizations
 to the Communists, however, has been reduced by the fact that their
 status as fronts in most cases is well known.  Moreover, their
 operations in the future may be further limited by tighter govern-
 mental controls, by official and unofficial counter-propaganda
 efforts, and by the activities of some competitive groups with
 an anti-Communist orientation.  In any case, the significance of
 the role played by front groups remains an open question.  Some
 Japanese, tncluding a large segment of the intelligentsia, have had
 a proclivity for positions similar to those advocated by front
 groups, such as "neutralism," but this proclivity may not have been
 induced by the front groups, and might not be removed even if the
 front groups disappeared entirely.
 National and local front organizations in Japan often center
 their activities around either a general theme (such as "peace"
 ,or promotion of trade relations with Communist China) intended to
 appeal to broad segments of the population or a specific theme
 (such as opposition to increases in university tuition rates)
 intended to appeal to local or special interests.  Cultural and
 professional front groups have tended to concentrate in the Tokyo
 area;  a number of front organizations have their headquarters in
 a single building in Tokyo sometimes referred to as a "Communist
 nest.!"  Increased attention, however, has been paid recently to the
 development of local cultural fronts in non-metropolitan areas.
 One of the principal activities of many front groups is the publica-
 tion of propaganda organs designed to reach persons outside as well
 as within the areas of concentrated population.
 In addition, following familiar practices, the Communists
 have attempted persistently to infiltrate various types of non-
 Communist social, cultural, and professional organizations.  The
 Communists reportedly exert varying degrees of influence, ranging
 from very slight to moderate, within a number of non-Communist
 organizations, such as:  the Japanese Science Council (an organiza-
 tion including some of Japan's top scientists), the Japan Cultural
 Cooperative Union, the Japan Peace Promotion Peoples Congress (which
 was originally Socialist-sponsored), the New Japan Women's League

 (a non-partisan-league of women voters), the Pacific Problems
 Research Society (the Japan branch of the Institute of Pacific
 Relations), the Democratic Nurture League (which provides advice
 to parents on the "democratic" upbringing of children), and the
 Japan Organ Publications Association ?which was designed to
 coordinate and improve leftist publications).
 Among the most active front organizations are the usual
 "peace" and Soviet bloc "friendship" groups.  The two major peace
 fronts are the Japan Peace Protection Committee and the Overall-
 Peace Patriotic Movement Council, which may merge in the near future.
 They are affiliated with the Soviet-dominated World Peace Council.
 Presumably these organizations will continue to be used for general
 propaganda operations, signature campaigns, and the like, and may
 derive some benefit from the current JCP de-emphasis on violent
 activities.  Exact membership figures are not available, but the.
 membership at large is believed to include non-Communists holding
 a variety of political views.  Among the "friendship" groups are
 the Japan-Soviet Friendship Society, with a registered membership
 of 8,000;  the Japan-Korea Friendship Society, whose exact member-
 ship figures are not available; and the Japan China Friendship
 Society, which in December 1951 had a membership of 700.
 Promotion of trade with Communist China is fostered not
 only by the Japan-China Friendship Society, but also by two other
 active groups specifically devoted to this theme.  The Japan-China
 Trade Promotion Council and the Japan-China Trade Promotion Associa-
 tion reportedly receive some support from non-Communist commercial
 firms and individuals interested in trade prospects with the Chinese
 mainland.  Membership data .is unavailable, but the strength of these
 groups apparently is concentrated in.the Tokyo and Kansai regions.
 The largest and most active minority group fronts are among
 Koreans in Japan.  It has been estimated that a substantial majority
 of the approximately 600,000 registered and 200,000 unregistered
 Koreans in Japan are sympathetic to the North Korean regime.  Some
 20 Korean organizations in Japan have been reported either Communist-
 controlled or dominated.  Durrently among the most active groups
 are the Korean Democratic Racial Front, which apparently includes
 a majority of the Communist and pro-Communist Koreans in Japan in
 its membership, and the Fatherland Defense Committee, which reportedly
 includes the more militant and extremist elements among the Korean
 minority.  The former is affiliated with the North Korean Democratic
 Front for Unification of the Fatherland.  There are reports of an.
 effort to revive the Korean League, which under the name of the
 League of Koreans Resident in Japan was once the dominant Korean
 front in Japan.  Before its dissolution by occupation authorities
 in 1949, its membership was reportedly about 400,000.

 The principal student front organization is the National
 Federation of Student Self-Government Associations (Zengakuren),
 which is affiliated with the International Student Congress.  The
 only nationwide university student organization, it reportedly
 has some 200 chapters throughout Japan.  About 20 percent of its
 total membership of approximately 150,000 are estimated to be active
 Communists or sympathizers, who have tended to overshadow and
 dominate non-Communist student participation.  Currently the organiza-
 tion reportedly is attempting to recoup its lose of membership
 during the past two years, as well as. to organize and penetrate the
 few existing high school youth groups.  The two principal fronts,
 among high school and other non-university youth are the Japan
 Democratic Youth Association, with an estimated membership of 20,000,
 and the Japan Youth Fatherland Front, with an estimated membership.
 of 50,000.  Both are reportedly affiliated with the Soviet-inspired
 Federation of Democratic Youth.  There is no evidence indicating
 that these groups will undergo extensive expansion or increase their
 activities significantly in the near future.
 A number of cultural front organizations in the fields of
 music, art, literature, entertainment, and general cultural promotion
 have been identified .  Most are relatively small but active propa-
 ganda organizations, reportedly including in their membership some
 notable names in Japanese cultural circles.  The major general
 cultural promotion group apparently is the Japan Cultural Peoples
 Congress.  In the entertainment field, the People's Theatrical
 Group and the Progressive Troupe are the most publicized and most
 active.  The former includes 363 Communist or pro-.Communist repre-
 sentatives of some 60 theatrical organizations.  The latter, which
 reportedly includes 26 known JCP members, has recently sent out
 small groups on a "road-show" basis in an effort to reach more people.
 Local Communist units are encouraged to exploit for propaganda
 purposes audiences attracted to such performances as these.  Several
 literary groups operate as front organizations, although specific
 data is lacking.  Apparently the most active is the New Japan
 Literary Society, which has 1,700 members and publishes a monthly
 periodical.
 There are a few front organizations for professional groups,
 most of which have a small membership.  Two of the most useful from
 the Communist viewpoint are the Liberal Lawyers Group and the Tokyo
 Joint Law Office, which-supply legal counsel for Communists.  The
 latter includes in its membership the more radical wing of the
 Liberal Lawyers Group, and the most able Communist lawyers in Japan.

 The New Japan Physicians' League, the chief medical front,
 consists of about 50 doctors and several operating clinics concen-
 trated in the Tokyo-Yokohama area.                                       One of the most influential
 academic front groups is the Democratic Scientists' Association.
 In the field of research, there are several small, but
 relatively influential, front groups devoted to disseminating
 propaganda in the form of selected data and "analysis" relating to
 Communist doctrine and conditions in Communist-controlled countries.
 Among these groups, whose name are indicative of their interests,
 are:   the China Research Institute, the Soviet Research Association,
 the Marx-Lenin Research Institute, the World Policy Research
 Institute, and the Soviet Data Correspondence Company.  However,
 several competitive anti-Communist research organizations have been
 established in Japan recently, in addition to the research and
 information activities of several government agencies.

 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 Although there are indications that the JCP has attempted per-
 sistently to infiltrate the government at all levels, and particularly
 such key agencies as the National Safety Force, National Rural Police
 and other security organs; there is no evidence that the party has
 penetrated the top policy echelons.  The Japanese government has been
 fully conscious of the potential threat posed by the JCP in this re-
 spect, and consistent efforts have been made to discover and discharge
 party members and sympathizers from agencies responsible for public
 safety and national security.  JCP efforts in this direction are
 certain to continue, however, and it is possible that party members
 and sympathizers are present in limited numbers at lower echelons of
 the government and security agencies.  Recent police counter-espionage
 has revealed that the JCP has obtained detailed knowledge of police
 plans through "Y-31" operations, otherwise known as the"Anti-Police
 Action Guidance. Department" of the covert organization.  There is no
 indication, however, that such. infiltration ag has occurred is suffi-
 cient to subvert the administration of government or to impede the
 effective use of security agencies in coping with a serious threat to
 public order and safety.

 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 The extent of direct Communist influence upon public-opinion
 leadership groups is believed to be slight.  "Purges" carried out in
 1949 and 1950 further reduced the number of Communists employed in
 educational, press, radio and entertainment enterprises.  The majority
 of public-opinion leaders, whose prestige is usually based on social
 and family background, financial strength, and political connections,
 and whose influence is quietly but persuasively exerted, is politically
 conservative.
 The extent of indirect Communist influence, while no doubt
 larger, is almost impossible to determine with any accuracy.  One of
 the difficulties involved in any assessment is the fact that the out-
 look of some non-Communist groups may in certain particulars coincide
 with that of the Communists.  Such a situation permits the Communists
 to claim or be credited with a greater influence than perhaps is de-
 served.                       A large segment of Japants intelligentsia is inclined to be
 sympathetic politically with the left-wing, and many such Japanese
 have been attracted for some years by Marxist theories and terminology.
 However, the number of actual Communists or fellow-travellers among
 this group is believed to be relatively small compared to those who
 adhere to Socialist principles or programs.
 There are indications of some Communist youth activities in the
 secondary schools and suggestions that individual teachers and admin-
 istrators may be either Communists or pro-Communist, but there is no
 evidence indicating that any significant Communist influence has been
 exerted on youth or the local communities from these sources.  The
 Japan Teachers Union, the most important organized group among Japanese
 school teachers, apparently supports the left-wing Socialists, so that
 on certain specific issues the view of the Teachers Union has paral-
 leled that of the Communists.
 At the University and College level the percentage of active
 Communist or pro-Communist professors or administrators is believed to
 be relatively small.  A few professors were dismissed during 1949 in
 connection with the "purge".  Many professors alleged or known to be
 Communists or sympathizers apparently focus their attention upon the
 theoretical aspects of Communism.  In a few universities, particularly
 Osaka Municipal University, a number of faculty members have been
 identified as party members or fellow travellers.  The extent of direct
 influence exerted by Communist and fellow-travelling faculty members
 cannot be isolated from the totality of Communist influence operating
 on the student body.
 In the entertainment field, individuals, who are either active
 Communists or pro-Communist, are known to be in the employ of
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 -30-
 non-Communist enterprises, but their influence apparently is very
 limited.  Some known Communists or sympathizers were purged from the
 entertainment industries in 1949 and formed active front organiza-
 tions devoted to propagandizing through entertainment media.  These
 small groups are very active and are considered important by the JCP.
 Evidence pertaining to the size of their audiences and their influence
 is otherwise only fragmentary.
 Radio enterprises and the non-Communist press carried out a
 purge of known Communists and sympathizers in 1950.  As a result, more
 than 600 persons were dismissed from various metropolitan and local
 newspapers and from the Broadcasting Corporation of Japan.  Although
 a few individuals may have escaped the purge and others have infil-'
 trated these organizations, there is no evidence that they either hold
 key positions or exert any significant degree of influence.  However,
 a few individual publishing houses which publish and promote the dis-
 tribution of Communist literature, such as the San Ichi Book Company
 of Osaka and Kyoto, may be controlled by either Communist or pro-
 Communist.
 It is highly doubtful that either Communists or sympathizers
 have acquired any positions of influence within Buddhist and Shinto
 institutions in Japan.  There is no evidence suggesting that the few
 Buddhist groups which recently have publicly advocated a program for
 world peace have been under any direct Communist influence.

 The extent of direct influence by Communist party members or
 sympathizers upon the policies and activities of moderate and ultra-
 right wing parties and organizations is negligible.  Neither major con-
 servative party is in any sense responsive to direct Communist influ-
 ence and both have adopted uncompromising anti-Communist positions.
 Scattered and unconfirmed evidence suggests the presence of a
 very limited number of Communist party members or sympathizers in a few
 of the ultra-rightist, nationalistic organizations. Particularly in
 the field of foreign policy, the radically nationalistic cast of the
 policies advanced by many of these organizations is of benefit to Com-
 munist Party propagandistic efforts and conceivably is susceptible to
 limited Communist exploitation.  Despite the similarity of certain of
 their objectives, there is no reliable evidence of even limited co-
 operation between the Communist Party and ultra-rightist organizations.
 Non-Communist, left-wing parties and organizations are more
 vulnerable to Communist exploitation and infiltration.  It is diffi-
 cult, however, to estimate with precision the extent of Communist Party
 influence in Japanese political, economic, and cultural organizations
 that generally exhibit either a radical or moderate socialist orienta-
 tion.                                 For a minor segment of Japan's non-Communist left, the presence
 of Communist party members or sympathizers in positions of leadership
 undoubtedly has enabled the party to exert a positive, although not
 necessarily determining, influence on policy and activities.  Such
 appears to be the case in certain non-Communist trade unions, both at
 the national and local levels, in certain segments of the Japan Farmers,
 Union (Nichino), in the Labor-Farmer Party, and among the extremist
 faction of the Left Socialist Party.
 A major segment of the non-Communist left - including the bulk
 of the Left Socialist Party and those trade unions and farmer organi-
 zations_closely allied with it at the leadership level -- currently
 supports policies and programs frequently paralleling positions assumed
 by the JCP.  Despite the probable presence at the leadership levels of
 these groups of a limited number of Communist sympathizers, if not actual
 party members, this parallelism of policies and even of action programs
 does not appear to be the result of positive Communist influence.  A more
 adequate explanation of the parallelism may be found in a tendency toward
 a doctrinaire, Marxist view of Japan's domestic and foreign problems, a
 radical socialist response to particular domestic political and economic
 circumstances, a political opportunism or, at most, a tolerance toward
 the Communist Party itself.  While such circumstances render this segment
 of the non-Communist left potentially vulnerable to JCP exploitation or
 infiltration, present evidence does not indicate that the Communist Party

 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 - 32
 is able to exercise a positive and continuing influence on the formu-
 lation of policy and action programs.  Moreover, despite the frequently
 close similarity of their policies, these groups consistently, since
 1919, have rejected JCP "United front" overtures.
 Any estimate of the significance either of direct Communist in-
 fluence in non-Communist left-:ring organizations and groups or of their
 potential exploitability by the Communists must be weighted by con-
 sideration of the actively anti-Communist segment of Japan's left-wing.
 Generally affiliated with the Right-Wing Socialist Party, this segment
 includes the so-called "right-wing" trade unions, farmers organizations,
 and quasi-political groups which increasingly have adopted positions of
 categorical, opposition to the JCP and have sought to avoid policies
 closely identified with the Communist Party.  Even within organizations
 whose leadership is closely allied to the Left Socialist Party, opposi-
 tion right-wing socialist factions frequently act to moderate extremist
 leadership and serve as a counter to Communist Party efforts to influ-
 ence significantly policy and action programs.  Finally, it is signi-
 ficant that despite the apparent numerical superiority of the socialist
 left-wing, based principally upon the membership of trade unions whose
 leadership supports the Left Socialist Party, the Right Socialist Party
 polled a greater proportion of the total vote in the recent general
 elections.  Assuming that Communist influence increases significantly
 within the socialist left, there is reason to believe that the moderate,
 socialist right-wing will form the core around which a majority of those
 now supporting more radical leadership will reorganize.
 In sum, it is believed that only in the minority, extremist seg.
 ment of the socialist left is Communist influence sufficient to exert a
 positive influence on action programs and policies, although even here
 such influence is not necessarily constant or determinant.  Nevertheless,
 the parallel between the policies and action programs of the major
 portion of the Socialist left and many of the positions taken by the
 JCP, particularly in the realm of foreign policy, is of considerable
 advantage to the Communists.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORM TTION

 Communist propaganda is disseminated in large quantities through
 a large variety of mass media. Published materials include newspapers,
 periodicals, pamphlets, leaflets, and posters produced and distributed
 both overtly and covertly.  Certain party publications, including
 Akahata (the official JCP newspaper), were forced underground as a re-
 sult of suppressive action initiated in the summer of 1950 under
 authority of an occupation ordinance.  Although this ban is no longer
 in force, the publications affected (some of which have reemerged as
 overt publications) have not been able to recover their former influ-
 ence.
 Most of the available data on Communist publications pertains
 primarily to those official or quasi-official organs controlled directly
 by JCP headquarters.  Overt publications currently are published by the
 JCP Publications Bureau.  The principal overt newspaper, Akahata ("Red
 Flag") is regularly published every third day plus frequen     elemental
 "extras."  Its present circulation is estimated at 85,000.  Zenei
 ("Vanguard") and Atarashii-'3ekai ("New World") are the two lea  ng
 monthly periodica s controlled  y party headquarters, each has a cir..
 culation of approximately 20,000.  The weekly paper To Katsudo Shishin
 ("Party Activity Guide") apparently is an important publication w  h n
 the party, although no circulation statistics are available.
 Several party organs continue to be clandestinely produced and
 distributed.  Heiwa to Dokuritsu ("Peace and Independence"), presently
 the principal clandestine paper, was last reported to be a daily with
 an estimated circulation of 100,000.  Naigai Hyoron ("Foreign and
 Domestic News"), apparently a daily, has actual`appeared irregularly
 under a variety of disguised titles.  It is estimated that the 5,000
 copies printed reach 100,000 persons.  To Kensetsu Sha ("Party Con-
 structor") apparently is an important p- l c3 alion, athough specific
 data on its circulation is not available.  The party presumably sponsors
 the Japanese edition of the Cominform Journal, Kokyo Heiwa no tame ni,
 Jimmin Minshu Shugi no tame ni ("For a Lasting Peace, for a Peo ie's
 emocracy  .  K -weekTy paper; it reportedly is a translation of the
 European version and has appeared under a variety of disguised titles.
 Party propaganda organs are supplemented by the extensive propa-
 ganda activities of the numerous front organizations.  The various
 Soviet bloc "friendship" fronts sponsor several publications dedicated
 to promoting "friendly relations," as well as to encouraging the es-
 tablishment of regular political and economic relations between Japan
 and Communist--controlled countries.  The Japan-Soviet Friendship
 Society sponsors two publications, the monthly periodicals Sovietto
 Nyusu ("Soviet News") and Soviet Shiryo ("Soviet Data").  I  is es i-
 ad that s  0,000 copies of the~ormer are printed, but no specific
 data is available regarding the latter publication.

 The Japan-China Friendship Society sponsors two bi-monthlies,

 At least three publications are devoted to promoting the Soviet-

 The Japan Peoples Relief Society, which is dedicated to the pro-
 tection of civil rights against "'oppressive police action" sponsors
 Jinken Mimpo ("Peoples Human Rights News"').  Some 8,000 copies of this
 paper are published every ten days.  The Japan Repatriates League
 publishes 4,000 copies of the Shinboku Shimbun ("Friendship Newspaper")
 for its members.
 Various publications cater to special population groups.  Fujin
 Sengen ("Women's Manifesto"), sponsored by the Japan Women's Democratic
 oune 1, is published every ten days and has an estimated printing of
 2,000 copies.  The Women's Democratic-Club sponsors the Fujin Minshu

 Party and front organization propaganda organs apparently are
 supplemented to some extent by the importation of publications from
 Commuiist-controlled countries.
 It is impossible to ascertain the impact of such imported publi-
 cations because precise data is not available.  Since April 28, however,

 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 - 35 -
 there has been no prohibition on the import of publications from these
 areas.  Apparently all types of Communist publications are available on
 the open market in Japan, including Isvestia and Pravda from the Soviet
 Union and People's China from Co     s     na.     is presumed from
 newstand 0-bookstore advertising that other major publications from
 these areas are readily available.
 There are no Communist-controlled broadcasting facilities in
 Japan and the extent of Communist or pro-Communist infiltration of
 existing broadcasting firms apparently is negligible.  Propaganda
 broadcasts, however, are beamed to Japan from Moscow, Peiping, and
 Pyongyang as well as from Radio Free Japan, a Communist-controlled
 station located in Peiping.  With the exception of the medium wave
 broadcasts of Radio Free Japan, all the programs apparently are broad-
 cast on shortwave.  Although Japan has approximately 9,000,000 radio
 receiving sets, only about 5 percent are capable of receiving shortwave
 broadcasts.  In an attempt to cope with this problem, the JCP has en-
 couraged the development of "listening clubs," and also has published
 transcripts or selected portions of important broadcasts.  Broadcasting
 schedules and the names of sets capable of receiving various foreign
 programs are also publicized.  In at least one instance, names of firms
 where radios could be converted to shortwave have. been published.
 Radio Free Japan now makes four one-hour broadcasts daily and
 uses two medium and two shortwave frequencies.  Monitor reports indi-
 cate that its shortwave broadcasts are very difficult to tune and fre-
 quently the medium wave broadcasts are very faint.
 There are five broadcasts daily from Moscow in Japanese, two of
 45 minutes each and three of 30 minutes each, while Radio Peiping
 broadcasts two programs daily of approximately a half-hour each.  Ac-
 curate data on Pyongyang broadcasts is unavailable at the present time.
 Reliable data pertaining to the listening audiences of these
 various overseas broadcasts is unavailable.  However, because of the
 poor quality of reception and the limited number of receiving sets
 capable of tuning these broadcasts, it is presumed that the audiences
 are relatively small and generally limited to those Communists or
 sympathizers who would go to considerable effort to listen.
 Although the importation of foreign propaganda films is under
 control, the JCP and front. organizations have either produced movies
 or encouraged the showing of those domestic and imported films which
 they believe have propaganda value because they present the "proletariat"
 viewpoint.  Films of this type produced in Japan include "The Stormy
 History of Hakone" by Zenshir,za in collaboration with the North Star

 Motion Picture Company, "Being a Mother and Woman" by Kinuta Pro-
 ductions, "Mountain Echo School"' sponsored by the Japan Teachers
 Union, "Foghorn" by Toho, and "Oh We're Still Alive" produced by
 Zenshinza.  Attendance at the showings of such foreign films as
 "Bitter Rice," produced in Italy, is also encouraged.
 Special propaganda media include mass demonstrations and rallies,
 sound trucks, and other facilities used in connection with election
 campaigns, special lectures, and study groups.  Local "struggle" cam-
 paigns arising from local grievances are also exploited topromote
 Communist propaganda.  In the past house-to-.house signature drives
 have also provided a highly personal means for spreading the party
 line.

 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 Statistics on the financial status of the JCP are only frag-
 mentary.  Information on the party's financial status not only is a
 closely guarded party secret but, since the development of an under-
 ground structure, party finances apparently are handled separately
 for the covert and overt organizations.
 Available statistical evidence is so inadequate that it permits
 no quantification of the JCP's financial health.  What statistical
 evidence is available, however, together with other evidence drawn
 from party activities seems to indicate that at least since 1951 the
 party has been faced with persistent but not crippling difficulties
 in financing both its overt and covert organizations and operations.
 Regular sources of income, such as party dues and the sale of party
 publications, do not appear to be providing a significant portion of
 total revenues, and the burden now appears to be carried by donations
 from wealthy party supporters, special contributions, front organiza..
 Lions, illegal activities, and Communist sources outside Japan.  Evi-
 dence of continued financial difficulties. is to be found in the fre-
 quent reports of party drives for improved collection of dues and more
 thorough party accounting systems, of the suspension of subsidies to
 certain organizations, and of reductions in the number and salaries of
 paid party workers.
 The impact of straitened financial circumstances appears to have
 fallen principally upon the JCP's overt organization and operations.
 Despite these indications, however, it is believed that the party as a
 whole continues to have access to sufficiently large funds from one
 source or another to continue active operations in all fields of effort
 and there is no indication that it will be forced to suspend any of its
 major operations in the near future.  Indicative of the extent of the
 party's resources is the fact that, despite its slight chances of
 success, the party expended at least 4 11,220,570 in the 1952 election
 campaign.
 Be  Revenues
 The JCP derives its revenue from party dues, sales of party pub-
 lications, illegal covert activities, private donations, contributions
 of business firms interested in trade with the Chinese mainland, Com..
 munist-controlled labor and front organizations, and international Com-
 munist organizations and the Soviet or.Soviet satellite governments.
 Very little detailed information is available on any of these sources.
 A possible indication of declining revenue during the past two
 years has been the increasing reliance on special fund-raising campaigns.
 In the most recent major campaign, during September 1952, a goal of
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 -38-
 4 100 million was set.  Despite several extensions, it is believed that
 the party failed to raise as much as 50 percent of its goal.
 1.  Dues and Party Publications.  No recent figures are available on
 the total revenue collected from party dues.  During 1949, when party
 membership was at its peak (approximately 110,000 registered members),
 income from dues is believed to have been only about two million yen
 monthly.  All recent evidence, however, indicates a decline in revenue
 from this source, and the party frequently has admitted difficulty in the
 collection of party dues.
 A similar decline in revenue appears to have been experienced in
 the sale of party publications, once one of most lucrative sources of
 revenue.  Circulation of these publications appears not to have re-
 covered from the suppressive measures carried out by the government
 from June 1950 to April 1952.
 2.   Donations.  Although the party apparently continues to receive
 substantial donations from wealthy party members and from certain busi-
 ness interests, there is evidence that donations to party election cam-
 paign funds no longer provide an important source of extra income.
 Total contributions, as reported by the party, for the 1947 and 1952
 Lower House general elections were 1- 5,155,543 and * 520,570 respectively.
 No figures are available regarding income from party.,.controlled
 business firms and from commissions in east-west trade.  Such business
 enterprises as have been identified as controlled by party members are
 small (many of them being book stores or small merchandising enterprises)
 and it is not likely that these make a significant contribution to the
 party coffers.  Nor is it likely that the party has received any sub-
 stantial income in the form of commissions from east west trade deals.
 There is evidence, however, that the party has received substantial dona-
 tions from non-Communist firms interested in supporting party efforts to
 promote trade with the Chinese mainland.
 No significant estimate is possible of the amounts received from
 Communist-controlled labor unions and front organizations.  In view of
 the relatively limited membership of Communist-controlled unions, their
 frequently loose organization, and the low state of union finances in
 general, it is unlikely that these unions provide an important source of
 income to the party.  (A possible exception here is the All-.Japan Auto-
 mobile Workers Union which contributed It 25,000 to the party's 1952
 election campaign.)  Incomplete information, however, suggests that front
 organizations provide a major source of party funds, both to the overt
 and covert structures, and are an important means by which funds are
 channeled to the party from sources within and outside Japan.  Thus, the
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 -39-
 party reportedly anticipated that front organizations would provide al-
 most X 2 million to its election campaign fund in September 1952.  In
 addition, these front organizations frequently are the agency through
 which a variety of fund-raising drives -- such as the "peace" fund cam-
 paigns - are undertaken.  A sizeable portion of such contributions
 probably is forwarded to the party.  The fronts often are able to obtain
 funds from sources which would not normally contribute to the party
 directly.
 3.  International Support.  No figures are available on the total of
 funds forwaRed to the from international Communist organizations or.
 from Communist governments, although incomplete reports suggest that
 these sources provide an important supplement to the party's total rev-
 enue.                             On at least two occasions, the transfer of funds to JCP front or-
 ganizations from the Chinese mainland has been confirmed:  1) a donation
 .of $114,000 from the Chinese Communist Peoples Relief Association to the
 Japan Peoples Relief Society, a JCP front; 2) of a total of It 3 million
 remitted during early 1952 by Japanese residents on the mainland to their
 families in Japan, over * 1 million is believed to have gone to the party
 itself or front organizations.  In September 1952, the party reportedly
 expected "Chinese sources" to provide * 1 million toward its election
 campaign fund.  Although there is no confirmation of reports that the
 Soviet mission in Japan has supplied the party with funds, it is possible
 that such contributions have been made.
 lt.  Other Revenue.   In addition to the sources of income noted above,
 unevaluated reports allege that a substantial portion of the party's
 revenue is derived from covert, illegal operation.  Black-marketeering,
 smuggling, trade in narcotics, extortion rackets, and other illegal
 operations frequently have been reported as sources of party funds.
 The JCP has never released publicly any complete and accurate
 statement of its total assets and liabilities.     As of March 1951, how-
 ever, the party's. finance department reportedly-listed the following as
 party assets:
 Land

 bilities reportedly were ; 77,000,000.

 XII.  SOVIET-SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 Among the factors contributing to Communist strength must be in-
 cluded the diplomatic establishment of the Soviet Union in Japan and
 its political activities.
 A Soviet mission -- the remainder of the office of the Soviet
 Delegate to the Allied Council for Japan which constituted the official
 Soviet representation during the occupation -- continues to exist in
 Japan although without official acceptance by the Japanese Government.
 The mission occupies a building in central Tokyo that has been closed
 to the public for over six months and that has been reported kept under
 surveillance by Japanese authorities.  The number of persons attached
 to the mission has steadily dwindled, 24 official members departed in
 September, 7 "unofficial" members left in November.  Available informa-
 tion places the total official personnel still remaining at 39, plus 14
 dependents.
 According to Japanese Government sources, the group of 39 Sovief
 nationals reported still officially attached to the mission can be
 broken down by function as follows:
 Officers
 Others
 Political Section
 5
 3
 Economic Section

 Press Section

 Military

 Administrative Section

 This breakdown should probably be regarded with suspicion, in
 view of the Soviet practice of masking functions and particularly in.
 view of the abnormal position of the mission.  There is no information
 available as to how many of these officials may be engaged in propaganda
 activities.  At present the mission conducts no known propaganda acti-
 vities of an overt, orthodox character.  The only activities along
 these lines reported in recent months have been an occasional newspaper
 story based on a press interview or on a private conversation between a
 Soviet official and Japanese.  Even these activities may be construed
 as propaganda only in the sense that any Soviet moves have propaganda
 significance.  On the other hand, it must be assumed that a major func-
 tion of the mission is the clandestine operation of covert propaganda

 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4

 -  41  -
 activities, in which a large part of the personnel may be engaged.  Pre-
 sumably the Soviet Mission still extends some assistance and guidance to
 the JCP and front groups.  An ng the front groups worthy of mention in
 connection with political activities of the Soviet Mission are=  The
 Japan-Soviet Friendship Association with a registered membership in
 December 1951 of 8,000; the Japan-China Friendship Association reported
 to have a membership of 700; and the Japan.-Korea Friendship Association,
 the membership of which is unknown.
 Although the mission previously had sought informally to include
 Japanese government personnel in its propaganda functions, it was only
 on November 7, 1951, for the first time since the surrender, that high
 Japanese government officials were formally invited to a mission re-
 ception.                              Since April 1952, there have been no official functions; how-
 ever, the mission has evidently maintained informal and personal contact
 with some Japanese businessmen.
 There are no other Soviet or satellite establishments or missions
 in Japan.  No diplomatic or other official relations between Japan and
 the Communist bloc have been established.  None of the Communist bloc
 countries that had declared war on Japan have signed a peace treaty.

 XIII.                                             COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 Although international Communist organizations apparently have
 no official installations in Japan, a number of Communist-controlled
 or dominated front groups are either affiliated with or maintain close
 liaison with various international Communist organizations.  In the
 fall of 1949 pro-Communist labor organizations in Japan sponsored the
 establishment of the World Federations of Trade Unions Japan Liaison
 Office to maintain relations with the Communist-dominated World Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions.  Two Japanese youth organizations, the Japan
 Democratic Youth League and the Japan Youth Fatherland Front are af-
 filiated with the Soviet-inspired World Federation of Democratic
 Youth.  The National Federation of Student Self-Government Associa-
 tion, the only nationwide student organization in Japan, is affiliated
 with the International Students Union.  The small but active Womens
 Democratic Club in Japan is affiliated with the Women's International
 Democratic Federation.
 No meetings of Communist International Organizations are known
 to have been held within Japan. Local Communists, however, have
 attended the following meetings of international Communist organiza-
 tions held abroad:

 It is not improbable that Japanese Communist groups have received
 some funds from international Communist organizations.  It appears less
 likely that funds have been transmitted from Japan to such international
 organizations.  However, no concrete evidence of such transmissions is
 available.

 XIV.. COMMUNIST COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK
 Information regarding the JCP communications network is scattered
 and incomplete.  The party's underground structure reportedly includes a
 specific liaison organization (designated by the code symbol "T")
 directly responsible either to the covert politburo or to one of its two
 immediate subdivisions.  Within the "T" organization, special groups re-
 portedly are responsible for the distribution of covert organ papers,
 the maintenance of liaison with the various specialized covert depart-
 ments, the transmission of directives and notifications to regional units,
 and the maintenance of communications network between the covert central
 organs and lower echelons.  Although no detailed information is available
 on the extent of the communications network at lower echelons, there have
 been indications that the party on several occasions has had to undertake
 a reorganization of its system of internal communications in the interest
 of greater efficiency and security against the danger of compromise.
 Substantial evidence indicates that since 1950 the JCP has de-
 veloped several code and cipher systems for communication between central,
 regional, and prefectural headquarters.  In addition, the party reportedly
 maintains an emergency warning system involving commercial telegraphic
 communications according to prearranged texts.  While comparatively
 simple, this system appears to be a very important part of the JCP com-
 munications net.
 The bulk of the party's foreign liaison apparently is undertaken
 through the commercial mails, with various front organizations serving
 as the principal channels.  There is evidence, however, that a covert
 international courier system is maintained by the party.  Scattered re-
 ports indicated that courier bases are maintained on small islands off
 the west coasts of Hokkaido and Kyushu.  During 1950>51, one such courier
 net for agents commuting between North Korea and Japan was uncovered by
 US intelligence agencies.  The principal covert JCP international courier
 and communications system for which relatively detailed information is
 available is "Maritime Organizations".  Comprised of party members em-
 ployed in shipping, this organization receives directives and ccmmunica.>
 tions from, and transmits communications to, Communist China and the
 Soviet Union and assists members and couriers illegally entering and
 leaving Japan.  It is believed that the 14 Japanese delegates who il-
 legally left Japan to attend the Pei-piing Asian and Pacific Peace Con-
 ference, October 1952, traveled by means of the network.
 There is no indication that the JCP maintains any substantial
 system of radio communication, either for internal or external use.
 Unverified reports indicated only limited use of radio communication.
 One such report which described the transmitter as part of the JCP
 "international communications division" indicated transmission between
 northern Hokkaido and Vladivastok.  During a recent investigation,

 Japanese security agencies arrested a Japanese radio operator who al-
 legedly had transmitted periodic communications from the JCP to the
 Soviet Union.  Radio Free Japan broadcasts, while apparently not used
 to transmit detailed instructions and guidance to the JCP, does serve
 to supplement the distribution of propaganda material within Japan and
 to provide local guidance to party members and units in the more remote
 areas of rural Japan.
 Despite the limitations of this international communications net-
 work, recent reports indicate that the JCP is making increasingly fre-
 quent contact with Communist Parties in other countries.  The bulk of
 the party's foreign liaison appears to be with the Chinese Communist
 Party and is generally carried on by such front organizations as the
 China Research Institute and the Japan.-China Friendship Association.
 Although apparently less extensive, the party's connections with the
 USSR are believed to be at least as important as those with Communist
 China.
 The degree to which the JCP has been the object of specific in-
 structions and criticism from the Soviet Union or Communist China is
 not fully known, although, since 1950, known instances of such in..
 structions and criticism have been of decisive importance for party
 policy.
 The first known instance of Cominform intervention in JCP affairs
 occurred in January 1950.  Taking the form of a bitter criticism of the
 Nozaka theory of peaceful revolution, this attack, published in the
 Cominform Journal, ultimately resulted in the theoretical reorientation
 of the JCP to accommodate the concept of violent revolution and in the
 initiation of efforts to create a covert organization capable of support-
 ing paramilitary action.  This criticism was supported, although in a
 more conciliatory tone, by the Pei ping Jen Min Jih Pao which also called
 on the party to correct its past errors. -Me same organ, on September
 1950, intervened in the internal struggle which accompanied the JCP=s
 response to the original Cominform struggle and although Pei ping
 supported the dominant JCP faction it urged a more conciliatory treat-
 ment of party dissidents.  Such an attitude subsequently was adopted
 by the JCP leaders.  The most recent instance of international. Communist
 intervention occurred in July 1952, this time in a signed article of
 TOKUDA Kyuichi, Secretary General, appearing in the Cominform Journal.
 This criticism of the party for its excessive concentration on strikes
 and demonstrations at the expense of parliamentary activities was
 followed by a marked dimunition of JCR-inspired acts of violence.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN ALGERIA:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 The over-riding immediate goal of the Algerian Communist Party
 since August 1946 has been to persuade the local independence movements
 to join with the Communists in a united national front in preparation
 ultimately for a revolution for "national liberation" and against
 French control and American imperialism.  In the meantime, the Communists
 are seeking through propaganda, to destroy sympathy for the US and the
 UN, to foster suspicion of Western defense plans, and to increase
 local hostility toward the French administration.  The serious economic
 grievances of the population -- both native and French -- receive
 particular attention from the Communists, who have a strong influence
 in the country's largest labor union.  However, the Algerian Communist
 Party, in common with all other Communist groups in North Africa is
 faced above all with the task of recovering its own strength.
 II.  TACTICS
 Having failed thus far to achieve a common front with the
 nationalists, except for the limited and now dormant front established
 in mid-1951, the Communists have attempted instead to participate,
 uninvited, in nationalist demonstrations, encouraging any tendency
 toward violence.  Similarly, Communist propaganda pamphlets and news-
 paper articles have dealt at times entirely with nationalist grievances
 and aspirations without placing them in a Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist
 framework.  Thus, in pretending to make the nationalist cause their
 own, the Communists try to impress upon the popular mind the need
 and desirability of reviving and extending the common front of 1951.
 Occasionally, coincidentally with such tactics, they berate the
 nationalist leadership for their refusal to join them in a new popu-
 lar front, for demonstrating faith in the US or the UN, or for
 cooperating with the French even in a minor way.
 III.  CAPABILITIES
 To date, the small Algerian Communist Party has had only
 limited influence on the Algerian nationalist movements, largely
 because (1) the nationalists realize that such ties would alienate
 many sympathizers in non-Communist areas; (2) the local Communist
 party is largely French in membership, and (3) the present nationalist
 leadership is aware of the opportunistic nature of Communism and
 the devotion of Communism to a foreign power whose domination the
 nationalists would dislike as much as that of the French.
 As an autonomous unit, the Algerian Communist Party is weak.
 While it dominates Algeria's largest labor federation, the Algerian

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 CGT, the latter is no more able to maintain a general strike without
 support from non-Communist labor unions than is its counterpart in
 France.  Moreover, while the Communist-dominated CGT includes possibly
 50 percent of organized labor in Algeria, it is estimated that only
 about one-fifth of the Algerian labor force (estimated at. 400,000) is
 organized at all.  French officials continue to hamper Communist party
 activities of all kinds in Algeria.
 The present capabilities of the Algerian Communist Party re-
 main minimal either for achieving its own current local objectives
 or for furthering Soviet policy.  Its own membership is small and
 believed declining although it has lost only slightly in percentage
 of total votes received in elections during recent years.  The leaders
 of the two nationalist parties seem to be unwilling.to resume the
 former cooperation, even on the limited scale provided by the
 Algerian Front for the Defense and Respect of Liberty -- which was
 organized in mid-1951 primarily in.protest against administrative
 interference in the June 1951 elections.
 This limited victory was achieved when the leading figures
 of the extreme nationalist movement led by Messali Hadj, the moderate
 nationalists led by Ferhat Abbas, and the Association of Ulema which
 comprises the leading teachers and scholars of the Islamic tradition,
 united with the Communists in July 1951 in the Algerian Front.  How-
 ever, each nationalist party to the alliance joined for the furtherance
 of its own ends and not through any basic sympathy with the objectives
 of international Communism.  The Communist victory was based upon
 their initiative in taking advantage of local grievances, and the
 Front's program centered upon the issues of civil liberties and civil
 rights and French administrative control over Moslem religious affairs.
 The Moslem parties remained unwilling to let the Communists jointly
 appeal with them to the Moslem masses on the broader issues of
 nationalism and "neutralism."  All three Moslem groups may also have
 hoped, by their association with the Communists, to frighten the US
 into bringing pressure to bear on France to make more political
 concessions.
 The disparate aims of the four groups prevented the Front from
 achieving either importance or permanence.  Although the Front has
 given Communist speakers the prestige of appearing on the same plat-
 forms as the Moslem parties and enabled them to take such occasions
 to propagate the Communist line in international affairs, it is doubt-
 ful, unless conditions in the Arab world further deteriorate, that the
 Communists will be able to convert the particular "neutralism" of the

 -3-
 Arab nationalist parties in Algeria into a pro-Soviet view of World
 affairs.  Nonetheless, the Communists meanwhile have had an excellent
 opportunity to acquaint most of the educated Moslem leaders of Algeria
 with Communist tactics and perspectives.
 The Communists will doubtless continue their efforts to join
 forces with the nationalists, and there is some danger that should
 the nationalists fail to achieve their objectives,. they would accept
 Communist support rather than look to the West.  While it is doubtful
 that the Communists will capture control of are- Algerian nationalist
 movement, Communist influence might lead to the adoption of more
 anti-Western policies and to increasing resort to direct action on
 the part of the nationalist groups.

 COOUNISM IN ATGEM:  ASSETS
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 No information is available concerning the numerical strength
 of the Algerian Communist Party, the membership of Communist controlled
 organizations, or the number of persons controlled through Communist
 infiltration of non-Caamwnist organizations.  The usual estimate for the
 Algerian Party for several years has been 15,000 persons.  However,
 recent developments point to a decline of membership and hence this
 figure appears too high.  Indications are that the bulk of the members
 are found among Frenchmen especially workers, artisans, and lower
 bracket civil servants.  The number of Moslem members and number of
 general sympathizers apparently varies with economic conditions.  The
 hard core is primarily composed of Europeans.  Strongholds of the move-
 ment are Algiers and Oran, which elected the only two Communist members
 from Algeria to the National Assembly.  There are also regional head-
 quarters at Constantine, Bone, Sidi-Bel-Abbes and Blida.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 Even allowing-for the fact that Algerian elections are not
 entirely free, the Communist Party's electoral strength is small.  In
 the elections to the National Assembly, cantonal and by-elections, the
 Communists have polled an average of 20 percent of the votes.  In the
 Algerian Assembly, they have captured only one seat out of 75.
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 Because of lack of both funds and members, the Communist Party
 is unable to employ violence at present.  It is conceivable, however,
 that Communist agitators will try to use the discontent among the native
 population to stir up riots, or to exacerbate disturbances created by
 others.  The Communist Party has tried to impart a political complexion
 to the strikes and work stoppages which have occurred during the last
 years, although their causes have been economic.  The degree to which
 Communist plans for violent action in Algeria can be made effective
 will depend primarily on the degree of cooperation which can be achieved
 with the nationalist movement, which has most popular support in
 Algeria.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 The Algerian Communist Party is a legally recognized organiza-
 tion which is permitted to operate openly and, on the whole, without
 any disabling restriction in Algeria.  Members of the party are permitted
 to compete with candidates of other indigenous political parties for

 SECRET -. SECURITY INFORMATION
 election to public office, to publish and circulate newspapers, and to
 convene "mess"meetings.  Repression of local Communist groups or the
 Communist press by the French Administration has generally been sporadic.
 To date, repressive measures employed by the French authorities have
 served as irritating and discomforting restrictions on the Algerian
 Communist Party but have not been sufficiently extensive and crippling
 to drive it underground.
 V.  CG?fTNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 No information is currently available concerning the number of
 Communists in Algerian defense plants and other key industries.
 Communist influence in the Algerian labor union movement is
 enhanced by the refusal of the French Administration to allow the native
 population to establish its own labor organizations.  Official recognition
 is restricted to the Communist-dominated CGT (Confederation Generale du
 Travail), the Force Ouvriere, and the CFTC (Christian Trade Confederation).
 It is estimated., for example, that out of a total labor force of approxi-
 mately 400,000 workers (of which some 80,000 are in commerce, industry,
 and government unions), the Communist-controlled CGT has maintained some
 45-50 percent of union membership.  Among some of the more important
 strategic labor organizations with which the CGT has affiliations are
 the General Confederation of Agriculture, the Inter-Union Central
 Committee of Government Employees, the Railroad Workers' Union,
 Electricity Workers Union, and the Union Algerienne des Travailleurs
 des Ports et Docks.  Moreover, the Algerian Communist Party, either
 independently or through the CGT, has been quick to throw its support
 to striking groups throughout Algeria, no matter whether members of the
 CGT or independent elements.  While the Communists do not possess
 numerical superiority in the CGT, their dominant position permits them
 to disrupt the transport, stevedoring, telecommunications, and mining
 activities of Algeria if sufficiently popular causes can be found.
 The Algerian CGT, as an affiliate and subordinate of the French
 CGT, is a member of the Communist-front WFTu.
 VI.  COM4JNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 The Algerian Communist Party has organized and subsidized a number
 of specialized social, cultural, and professional organizations.
 Generally, these groups are established either on a temporary basis to
 acquire French and Algerian support for short-term Communist-inspired
 programs (such as soliciting signatures for the Stockholm Peace Petition),
 or are organized on a long-range basis with yearly allocations of funds.
 Normally, the latter groups formulate programs seeking (1) the re-estab..
 lishment of Algerian independence and sovereignty; (2) the awakening
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 of feminist political and social self-consciousness; and (3) the indoc-
 trination of Algerian youths with Communist ideology.  Among the more
 important of these front organizations are the Communist Youth Federation,
 France-USSR, Les Amis de la Democratie, Secours.Populaire d'Aledrie,
 Uni   Al n   g$ enne d Or       ions  a Je   s e C          , Union des
 Femmes d'Algdrie, As= ration des  tudiants Musulmans and Section
 EtudiantEe du Comite d'Action des Intellectuels Algdriens  pour la naix.
 While no information is available concerning the overall strength of
 these organizations, their number is estimated to be extremely small. In
 the case of the last two groups, for example, it is reliably reported
 that their combined membership does not exceed 300 youths.  Moreover,
 they are generally concentrated in the cities of Algiers, Oran,
 Constantine, and Philippeville.
 No information is available concerning the infiltration of non-
 Communist organizations in Algeria.  Occasionally individual members of
 certain Moslem groups, such as the Association of Ulema, are noted as
 having attended certain People's Peace Congresses. but these individual
 deviations do not mean that these groups as a whole are Communist
 oriented or dominated.
 VII.  COMMJNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 There is little concrete information available concerning the
 infiltration of Communists into the Algerian administration.  Unconfirmed
 reports indicate  that there has been some Communist infiltration in the
 lower governmental echelons.  However, the number, influence, and areas
 of concentration of these elements, though unknown, is small at this time.
 VIII.  COM?4JNIST INFLUENCE ON. PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 Some journalists working for conservative journals and a small
 number of primary and secondary school teachers are thought to be
 Communist.    No reliable information is available.
 IX.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NOK-CONMNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 (For connections with nationalist parties, see Part I under
 Capabilities.)
 X.  COr 1UNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 The Algerian Communist movement publishes and circulates one
 Arabic-language and three French-language newspapers.  These include
 the Alger Republicain and Le Courier Algdrien, which are published daily;
 Libertd, which is a weekly newssheet, and the Arabic-language New
 Algeria, a monthly.       Alger Retiublicain, which is perhaps the most

 -7-
 important Communist newspaper in Algeria, utilizes the presses of the
 Societe Nationale des Edition de Presse, is estimated to have a total
 circulation of approximately 20,000, and is published by Pierre Laffont
 under the directorship of Henri Alleg (member of Central Committee of
 Algerian Communist Party). Libert  is also estimated to have a total
 circulation of 20,000 and is also printed by SNEP.
 Alger Republicak is not a member of the local newspaper syndicate
 because it does not pay its employees the official minimum wage.  The
 paper claims to do so, and has noted that its employees turn back part
 of their wages voluntarily in their desire to keep the paper solvent.
 Alger Republicain is the only newspaper in Algeria to print schedules
 of the broadcasts of the Soviet and satellite radios.  It is assumed
 that all Communist newspapers in Algeria, because they have considerable
 difficulty in making ends meet, are subsidized in part from France.
 The French Communist Party is also active in providing supple-
 mentary reading material for native consumption in Algeria.  Recent
 reports indicate, for example, that The Principles of Leninism by
 Joseph Stalin,has been published in Arabic by the Colonial Section of
 the French Communist Party and is currently being circulated in Algeria.
 The Algerian Communist Party has established a small book store in
 Algiers to further the circulation of each propaganda material.  There
 is a paucity of material coming directly from the Soviet Union and its
 satellites.
 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 Little is known of the financial situation of the Algerian
 Communist Party.       Recent reports indicate that the party finds itself
 in a rather difficult position financially and is being subsidized, at
 least in part, by the French Communist Party.
 In the quarter beginning July 1, 1949, the Algerian Communist
 Party is reported to have distributed party funds as follows:
 (a) 5,400,000 francs (approximately $15,500) for assistance and relief;
 and (b) 3,200,000 francs (approximately $9,000) for, propaganda --
 700,000 francs for the department of Algiers, Oran, and Constantine,
 and 2,500,000 francs for Arab villages and the territories of the south.
 XII. SOVIET SATEILITEOFFICIAL ASSETS
 The Soviet Consulate General at Algiers ceased to function on
 October 15,.1951.  Its affairs were subsequently transferred to the
 consular section of the Soviet Embassy in Paris.  It was reported that
 this action was taken by the USSR on its own initiative and without any
 intervention on the part of the French Government.  The closing of the

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 -8-
 Soviet Consulate General currently leaves the USSR and its satellites
 without any official representatives in Algeria, or in French North Africa.
 XIII.     COMMMIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATI( S
 The Algerian Communist Party has been a continuous supporter of
 international peace conferences.  Most recently, representatives attended
 the Vienna World Congress for Peace.  Members of the Algerian Communist
 Party also attended the Berlin Peace Conference which was held in the
 summer of 1952.       During 1951, the party claimed to have acquired 100,000
 signatures in its campaign to gain Algerian support of a Communist-
 inspired resolution calling for the conclusion of a peace pact among the
 five major world powers.
 XIV.   CG M JNIST COWNICATION NETWORK
 No information is available concerning the channels by which
 confidential information is transmitted among members of the party.
 The Algerian Communist Party maintains its closest ties with the
 French Communist Party, which appears to serve as the parent, or guiding,
 organization.   The French Communist Party's hierarchy has been critical
 of the inability of the Algerian Party to remain. solvent, strengthen
 its current ties with the nationalist parties, formulate a program of
 action capable of attracting a larger number of native Algerians, and
 provide sufficient discipline within the party.

 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,

 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN EGYPT:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 The goals of Communist activity in Egypt cannot be stated in terms
 of the pronouncements and major activities of a specific Communist Party.
 There does not appear to be any single organized Communist Party in Egypt
 nor do any of the groups engaged in Communist propaganda and activities
 appear to be capable of giving central direction to the actions of the
 others.
 The goal of what Communist activity exists in Egypt is to discredit
 the West and weaken Western influence.  In particular, Communists attempt
 to stimulate local efforts to oust the British., to prevent the establish-
 ment of a broad defense scheme which could act as a substitute for the
 present British military establishment, and to agitate against the
 acceptance of Western assistance, such as the Point Four program.  Since
 the intent of these goals is to achieve a political vacuum in the Middle
 East, their success would fulfill the major policy requirements of the
 USSR.  The party is far from possessing power to secure these aims,
 however; thus,. its principal immediate objective is the creation of a
 stronger and more effective party organization.
 II.  TACTICS
 Communist activity in Egypt is small and fractionalized, partly
 because a large part of its work is carried on among certain minority
 elements, such as Copts, Greeks, Jews, Armenians, and Italians, operating
 within the framework of separate minority organizations often connected.
 with similar groups abroad.  In part also, Communist work. is the work of
 separate individuals operating within existing parties or organizations,
 particularly among youth groups.  At present the tactical aim of such
 activity apparently is to form, surreptitiously, a united national front
 of these splinter groups and leftist elements in the Socialist
 and Wafd Parties and in the Moslem Brethren.  An attempt will undoubtedly
 be made; to reach the membership of other parties, such as the New
 Nationalist and new labor and peasants' parties.  Certain women's organi-
 zations such as the Bint al-Nil (the Moslem Ladies' Society) and the
 Feminist Union, have become interested in the possibility of attracting
 local attention and getting some international recognition by cooperating
 with the Communist movement, and have espoused Communist aims and sent
 delegations abroad to Comma~nist-sponsored conferences.
 For example, the Wafdist Vanguard, a leftist group in the Wafdist
 Youth, is now headed by 'Abd al-IAihazin Hamuda, formerly Egyptian press
 attache in Washington, who was deported from the US in April 1952 as a

 Communist.  Ahmad Husayn, president of Egypt's Socialist Party,
 is an opportunist who was pro-Fascist prior to World War_II and since
 1945 has made numerous pro-Communist statements and has reportedly
 received financial subsidies from the Communists.  Ahmad Taha, pro-
 Communist brother of the murdered Lt. 'Abd al-Qadir Taha (who is regarded
 as a martyr to their cause by the Liberal Officers), is prominent in
 Egypt's embryonic labor movement.  He plays upon his fraternal connection
 to enhance his prestige and to ingratiate himself with the Liberal
 Officers, who hesitate to snub him because of his brother's memory.  He
 is seeking to oust the present anti-Communist leader of the Egyptian
 labor federation movement in order to secure that key position for himself.
 Several efforts have been made under the Parties Law of September 8,
 1952 to secure recognition of a number of pro-Communist political parties,
 but all have been turned down by the government.  Until the recent out-
 lawing of all Egyptian political parties, Muhammad al-Bindari, former
 Egyptian Minister to the USSR and leader of the Egyptian Partisans of
 Peace, was bending every effort to secure recognition of a Communist
 front party under the guise of a "national liberation" group, with members
 drawn from among Partisans of Peace and other left-wingers.
 In the days immediately after the military coup of July 23, 1952,
 the Communists, who were apparently. taken by surprise, supported the army
 officers against King Farouk and his entourage and pursued a policy of
 "wait and see," on the domestic reform program of the military group.  By
 September 1952, the Communist movement had decided that the Nagib regime
 was its enemy.  Since that time, the Communists have engaged in a campaign.
 of vilification directed particularly against Nagib and 'Ali Mahir, who
 was Prime Minister during the first month after the coup.  Pamphlets have
 been distributed among army personnel characterizing the coup as an
 "Anglo-American imperialistic plot," and General Nagib as a "stooge of
 the imperialists" and as another tyrant, exactly like Farouk, who must
 therefore be liquidated.  It is said that the Communists inspired the
 violent strike of textile workers at Kafr al Dawwar in August 1952 and
 that they organized an anti_Nagib conspiracy among non-commissioned army
 officers in August or September 1952, which proved abortive.
 The Communists seize every opportunity to sow dissatisfaction in
 Egypt.  When a member of a prominent landowning family who also heads an
 important Bedouin tribe was imprisoned for attacking the police in protest
 against the application of the land reform law to the family landholdings,
 local Communist propaganda took the line that Nagib was persecuting the
 tribesmen.  When it became apparent that the military regime intended to
 purge party leaders, including Mustafa al-Nahas and other prominent
 members of the Wafd Party, the Communists took the line that Nahas was a
 national leader who should be retained as the president of the Wafd.  The
 Communists have taken advantage of anti-British feeling in Egypt to urge
 the use of force in ousting United Kingdom troops.  Since the economic
 and political measures cr the Nagib regime have led to some decline in

 T3T
 business and industrial activity and resulted in rising unemployment,
 Communists are almost certain to exploit the dissatisfaction among urban
 labor which will follow any reduction of the already low standard of
 living.
 Another possible field for the expansion of Cammmniat influence
 in the near future would seem to lie among the fellahin.  The Nagib
 regime has removed the legal prohibition against agricultural labor unions,
 and has established agricultural cooperative societies as part of its
 program. of land reform.  The Communists can be expected to infiltrate and
 attempt to gain control of both.  Still another fertile field for CommdLnist
 activities has been among students, both in universities and secondary
 schools, and particularly in youth movements.  This group is especially
 vulnerable to Cammunist propaganda, since many Egyptian students apparently
 feel that a Communist econcey and form of government could be adopted
 without the abandonment of Islam. )hny student riots, organized to protest
 against the British, against martial law, and against "imperialism"
 generally, have no doubt been sparked or stimulated by Communist agitators,
 working within the youth groups.  Guerrilla warfare against the British
 in the Canal Zone, carried on mainly by youth groups in para-military
 organizations or student groups in late 1951 and early 1952, was partly
 Comiminist-inspired.
 III.  CAPABILITIES
 The ultimate objective of the few disciplined and thoroughly
 Moscow-oriented Communists in Egypt -- the establishment of a Communist
 state subservient in foreign policy to the USSR -- is far beyond the
 capabilities of the present Communist movement.
 As for the more immediate goals outlined above, the Communist
 movement may be able surreptitiously to keep up its propaganda against
 the UK and the West and against Western-sponsored regional defense
 organizations or programs such as Point 4.  Some of the influence and
 capabilities of the Communist movement in Egypt before the July 1952
 military coup have been reduced at least temporarily by (1) the counter:
 attraction of the new regime's direct attack on economic and social
 maladjustments, and (2) the adherence of certain previously left-wing
 and opportunist writers and leaders such as Fhthi Radwan and Rashad
 al-Barawi to the now military regime, in which their basic desire for
 power and their bent toward nationalism find  greater satisfaction than
 in their previous fellow-travelling role.  In mid-January 1953, moreover,
 the new regime also arrested a considerable proportion of the known
 Communists in Egypt, and banned the publication of all newspapers whichL
 have fairly consistently supported the Communist line on international
 and domestic questions.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 There is no Communist Party as such in Egypt.  Communist activity
 in the country is carried on among a number of splinter groups, whose
 total membership is probably not over 4,000.  It was reported in
 September 1952 that an organization called "The Nucleus of the Egyptian
 Communist Party" had recently been founded, with units in both Cairo
 and Alexandria.  Most of its leaders were reported to be drawn from
 among technicians and industrial plant employees; its main source of
 funds reportedly was an Egyptian engineer named Satd Muhammad Hasan.
 Most Communist sympathizers are centered in Cairo and Alexandria,
 and a rather high proportion are members of minority groups -- Copts,
 Armenians, Greeks, and Italians.  Several Egyptian feminist organiza-
 tions appear to be involved in front activity, having sent representa-
 tives to the Vienna Peace Congress of December 12, 1952.  Madame Siza
 Nabarawi, head of both the Egyptian Feminist Union and the Women's
 Movement for the Popular Struggle, Madame Ragiyah Hamzah of the
 Bint-al-Nil (Daughters of the Nile), and Madame Haja Zaynab al-Ghazali,
 president of the Moslem Women's Society, attended the Vienna meeting.
 Students are another segment of the population where Communist
 sympathies appear to exist.  A number of members of the Wafdist Vanguard,
 a part of the Wafdist Youth, are connected with the Communist-front
 Partisans of Peace.  Student demonstrations against the British and
 against martial law have on occasion been exacerbated by Communist
 agitators.
 There is no reliable information available on the quality of the
 party membership in terms of its willingness to incur hardships or cling
 to the party line.  Fourteen "hard-core" Communists were imprisoned after
 the "Black Saturday" rioting (January 26, 1952), and have not been
 released.
 There are no outstandingly effective leaders among the various
 Communist groups.  Kamil al-Bindari (The Red Pasha) has attempted on
 several occasions to form a Communist political party, as has Fathi
 al-Rawli, the editor of al-Mu'arda (The Opposition).  Their attempts
 have been unsuccessful, which may be attributed partly to the firm
 attitude of successive Egyptian Governments towards the Communists as
 well as to the opportunistic and.dilettantist character of the latter's
 activities.  The feminist groups which have taken on a pro-Communist
 coloration have definite dilettantist overtones in this aspect of their

 SECRET.- SECURITY INFORMATION
 activity, and are more likely to be using it as a lever' to secure politi-
 cal recognition of womenta rights than from any sincere conviction re-
 garding Communist tenets.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 The Communists have never appeared on the Egyptian ballot, and no
 clearly identifiable fellow-traveller candidates are known to have
 participated in any election.
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 The Egyptian Communists apparently have no'military organization
 for violent action.  However, some student disorders and nationalist
 demonstrations were undoubtedly supported and exacerbated by Communist
 agitators.  Communists have participated in anti-UK guerrilla activity
 in the Canal Zone.  The number of guerrillas with military equipment
 might.be a few hundred.
 IV.   GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 As a result of an attempted counter coup in mid-January 1953,
 the Nagib government has-banned all political parties.  The coup was
 attributed to army-Wald-Communist collaboration, and as a result all
 existing Communist publications were banned and a number of Communist
 leaders, including Fathi al-Rawli, editor of al-14u'arda, and Yusuf
 Hilmi, Secretary-General of the Partisans of Peace, were jailed.  There
 is no definite information available on.a Communist underground, but it
 may be safely assumed that there is such a movement, although it is
 probably-quite weak at this time.
 V.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 Egypt is not extensively industrialized and imports practically
 all of its armaments.  The pro-Communist elements have had some success
 in infiltrating the labor unions and have been attempting to gain control
 of Egypt's labor federation movement.  Under normal conditions they
 could be expected to try to gain control of agricultural unions and the
 agricultural cooperatives set up under the Land Reform Law.  However,
 since the Nagib government is apparently taking strong measures to
 repress pro-Communist activity, such efforts can be expected to fail.
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL  CULTURAL, AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 The partisans of Peace is the only significant fellow-travelling
 Communist-controlled organization.  It draws support from such groups as
 urban youth, particularly students; women; and cultural and professional
 circles.

 Probably several thousand Egyptians are sufficiently sympathetic
 to Communism to attend occasional mass meetings or read the organiza-
 tion's paper, Al-Katib, when it was published.  Centers of strength are
 Cairo, Alexandria, and in the provinces of Miniah   in Upper Egypt, and

 The leaders, such as Kamil al-Bindari, Yusuf Hilmi, and Said al Din
 Kamil, seem to be mainly professional men and intellectuals; they are
 neither Moscow-trained Communists nor skilled professional revolutionaries.
 However, they have read the Communist classics, are informed about
 affairs, and are capable of carrying on propaganda

 when they parallel the slogans of nationalism and anti-imp
 The Egyptian Partisans of Peace have often sent delegations to
 Communist-inspired"peace" conferences.  The most recent was held in
 December 1952 in Vienna at which        Rashad, pthelpresident of the ilmi,
 the secretary-general, and delegation, represented the Egyptian organization.
 The Partisans of Peace reportedly plan to expand by establishing
 committees in the armed forces, particularly among the NCOts.  Social
 committees are to be formed in towns and villages where they do not
 already exist.  Their objectives are to (1) exploit the popularity in
 Egypt of the idea of neutralism and non-involvement in the East-West
 conflict, and (2) make the Partisans of Peace the leading exponent of
 this idea.
 The Partisans of Peace probably are capable of a considerable
 expansion of their organization and an increase in the range and effective-
 ness of their activities if they are permitted to operate in relative
 freedom.  It seems unlikely, however, that the authorities, a grow to
 specifically the present military regime, will permit
 formidable size.  The Partisans of Peace do not seem capable of seriously
 challenging the policies of the military, but might become much more
 dangerous if (1) there is a breakdown of orderdueerto2factiional disputes t among the members of the present military j,

 services, police, and national industries.  A situation which bears
 watching is the reliance of the military junta on civilian advisers
 who have manifested pro-Communist tendencies in the past, notably Fathi
 Ridwan and Rashad Barawi.  However, as noted above under "Tactics," most
 such men were determined opportunists who joined the Communists under
 the previous regime because they were frustrated in their desire for
 high office.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 As indicated in "Tactics" above, there is considerable attention
 to Communism as a system in public opinion forming circles.  Even in
 the non-Communist press, there are individual reporters who are quite
 sympathetic to certain aspects of Communism.  However, such people -are
 often unclear as to the extent to which they are supporting Communism
 or simply taking up a Communist cudgel against the West.  Those'Egyptian
 newspapers which at least occasionally print a pro-Communist article
 have a combined circulation of over 100,000.
 IX.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 Since political parties were banned in Egypt effective January
 16, 1953 (for a three year period), this question is no longer relevant.
 However, before this action, pro-Communist elements apparently had some
 success in infiltrating the Wafd youth groups, the Ikhwan, and the
 Egyptian Socialist Party (formerly Young Egypt).
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 There are some consistently and by local standards sensationally
 pro-Communist newspapers such as al-Mur'ardah, edited by Fathi al-Ramli;
 al-Katib, edited by Yusuf Hilmi, and'a1- alayin,  but it is not known
 whether they are currently being published since such papers are
 frequently banned or temporarily suspended.  No well-established paper
 is pro-Communist.
 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 The financial position of the Egyptian Communist Party has always
 been precarious.
 XII.       SOVIET SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 Soviet and satellite countries having Legations in Cairo are manned
 by the following staffs:  USSR, 11;Poland,1; Bulgaria, 1; Hungary, 4;

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Rumania, 1; Czechoslovakia, 6.  None of these states have trade or
 cultural missions in Egypt.  USSR and satellite Legations are reported
 to have personnel engaged in propaganda activities.  Probably all
 personnel make some attempt to Osel1M Egyptians whom they meet on the
 advantages of the Commminist system.
 The Soviet Legation and probably some of the satellite Legations
 have receptions on their national holidays.  Egyptian Government officials
 are invited and. many attend.  The effect of these activities appears to
 be insignificant.
 XIII.  CO4MUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 The Egyptian Student Union, which may be a member of the Internation-
 al Student Union, is reportedly organized under Partisan of Peace leader-
 ship.               It urges students in various parties, particularly the Wafd and
 the Socialist, to join its organization.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented. in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN GREECE: OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 The Communist revolt in Greece at the time when the country
 was liberated from Nazi occupation (December 1944), and the guerrilla
 war which the Greek Communist Party (KKE) undertoo1 in the fall of
 1946 demonstrated that the major and ultimate objective of the
 Communists is to bring Greece within the Soviet orbit.  Since the
 defeat of the Communist guerrillas in the summer of 1949, the outlawed
 KKE has confined itself to political action designed to reorganize
 their underground apparatus in Greece and, in addition, to establish
 a front which can operate legally and openly.
 The immediate objective of the KEE seems to be to promote its
 domestic political fortunes by reestablishing prestige among the
 left wing elements. of the population.  Its propaganda hammers away at
 the alleged connection between poverty, "repression," and the increasing
 power of Greek "reactionaries" and Greece's participation in Western
 defense activities.  The burden of the Greek defense budget and
 Greece's need to withdraw from the "war camp" are particularly stressed.
 II.  TACTICS
 The principal taotical objective of the Communist Party appears
 to be to broaden the membership of its front organization, the "United
 Democratic Left" (EDA), which in the 1952 elections gained about
 12 percent of the popular vote, by seeking to win another 20 percent
 of the electorate now constituting the left wing of the Progressive
 Democratic Party (EPEK).  Thus, the Communists hope to make EDA Greece's
 principal opposition party.
 The KKE has on several occasions told voters that they could
 find "reliable" candidates in "all the parties" who could be supported.
 This would suggest that the Communists have infiltrated even into the
 more conservative political circles.  Surer evidence indicates that
 they have recovered much lost ground among labor.  Through the ESKE
 (United Trade Union Movement), which is the labor arm of EDA, the
 Communists have infiltrated labor unions to an extent that may make them
 capable of wielding considerable influence at the next Panhellenic
 Congress of the Greek General Confederation of Labor (GSEE).  This
 situation, however, is causing the present labor executive of the GSEE
 to take steps to block ESKE fron gaining control of locals and attaining
 a position of influence in the Confederation.  The success which the
 Communists have had in recovering their operational position within
 labor is principally due to their ability to establish a united front
 with the union membership itself.  Their attempt, however, to carry out

 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 broad front tactics by formal alliance with the leadership of labor
 unions and political parties has met with little success.  EPEK rebuffed
 the latest such attempt just prior to the elections.
 Although EDA, despite its constitutional conduct, has steadily
 become less a front group and more the KISS itself under a different
 name, the new Greek Government controlled by the Greek Rally has shown
 so far no inclination to take action against it.  It is possible that,
 while EDA hopes to attract additional members under the new right-wing
 regime, the Greek Rally Government may let EDA continue in its present
 legal status in order to splinter its center opposition.
 III.  CAPABILITIES
 The political capabilities of the KKE appear to have been blocked
 for the time being with the rise of a strong ,government.
 As a result of the elections of November 16, 1952, the present Greek
 Government, headed by Marshal Alexander Papagos, gained about 49 percent
 of the popular vote and, under a revised electoral system, about 80
 percent of the seats in Parliament.  This governmental strength, which
 the Communists probably did not expect to develop, could serve as an
 effective deterrent for the next four years against Communist  subversive
 activity and infiltration in the institutional life of the country.
 Nonetheless, the Communists, despite the fact that they failed to elect
 any deputies, enjoy an electoral base for political consolidation and
 maneuver.
 The prospect of the KKEts gaining a position of significant
 influence is contingent on the capability of the Greek Rally to hold,
 or increase its popular support, and to the ability of the center
 coalition, composed of the Liberal Party and EPEK, to cooperate in
 carrying out a constructive opposition policy.  The Communists probably
 anticipate that both pro-Western groups, the Greek Rally as well as
 the Liberal-EPEK coalition, will disintegrate, since both political
 groups are made up of heterogeneous political elements.  Since the
 Greek Rally is held together by the prestige of Marshal Papagos and the
 opposition by the patriotism of General Plastiras, the political life
 of the country thus centers on two personalities who are at their
 career's and.  This fact gives hope to the Communists, who are also
 encouraged by the economic situation, which imposes a low standard
 of living on the  population.
 Unless overall Soviet strategy requires them to sacrifice EDA
 and go completely underground to resume their tactic of terroristic.
 activity, the Greek  Communists  will seek to increase their strength

 with time through a program of relatively moderate political action and
 propaganda.  While the Communists for the time being apparently are not
 planning to resume large-scale sabotage inside Greece, there are about
 20,000 Greek Communists in the satellite countries who are kept in training
 for possible reinfiltration into Greece.  The Greek Government, however,
 is acutely aware of this threat, and continues accordingly to budget for
 strong and vigilant police and gendarme forces.
 The KKE has a reservoir of about 200,000 male voters and as many
 women to servo as an echelon of supply and support for any underground
 organization.  The returns of the last three elections have shown that
 the KKE has a constant popular support of about 10 percent of the voters.
 It is therefore significant that, with this small percentage of popular
 support, the KKE was capable of disrupting the country for almost
 three years (1946-49).  It is also noteworthy that the Communists were
 able to preserve their electoral strength after the liquidation of the
 guerrilla war.  The election returns make two points clear:  (1) the
 absence of defection among the rank and file of the Greek Communists;
 and (2) the capability of the KKE, whose top leaders operate from within
 the Soviet orbit, to exercise remote control over its organization
 in Greece.
 While the Communists are presently aiming at strengthening and
 enlarging the legal status and political base of EDA, they may also
 have made progress in building up their underground by their partially
 successful campaign for the release of the Communist internees in
 concentration camps and prisons.  The ultimate influence of the
 Communists, however, will depend on the degree to which the anti-
 Communist parties can cooperate in solving domestic problems, especially
 improving Greece's economic situation.

 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 No reliable figures are available on the membership of the Greek
 Communist Party (KKE).   In 1949 Soviet sources claimed as many as
 75,000 members.  The Greek elections of 1952 revealed about 180,000
 Communist sympathizers.  Of these, the number of card-carrying members
 is probably not more than 100,000, of which 30,000 might constitute the
 hard-core.
 There are probably 150,000 individuals in organizations controlled
 by the communists, and an additional 300,000 persons are influenced by
 partial, but significant, Communist infiltration of non-Communist organ-
 izations.  In all 12 to 15 percent of the total population is subject to
 direct Communist influence or control, or some 900,000 to 1,000,000.
 These figures are not documentary; they are merely the best estimate that
 can be made.  The regional distribution of KKE strength is indicated in
 the following table, which shows areas in which the Communist-front party
 EDA is strongest as reflected in the November 16, 1952 elections:

 The bulk of party membership and sympathizers are drawn from
 industrial and agricultural workers, and secondarily, and to a,decreasing
 extent, from the intellectual-professional stratum.  Additional pertinent
 data on the KKE membership are reflected in the following statistics of

 vote has not declined since the elections of 1946, but its card-carrying

 more than 20,000 Greek Communists are outside the country.
 The KKE leadership can be characterized as youthful, enthusiastic,
 individualistic, and immature; despite the limitations imposed by these
 qualities, they have developed a high sense of party discipline and a
 tightly-knit organization.

 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 A.  World War II and 1944 Insurrection
 During World War II, the Communists controlled the principal
 resistance movement, the National Liberation Front (EAM).  The principal
 centers of EAM strength were in Attika, Central Greece, Macedonia, Crete,
 and in the major Aegean Islands.  Although no reliable estimate is
 available of the number of people who participated in the resistance,
 there were probably more than 500,000 men and women active in EAM, who
 probably had the sympathy and support of more than 50 percent of the
 Greek population.  Most of those who supported EAM before the December
 1944 uprising were not Communist sympathizers and few were aware of
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 Communist control of EAM or of Communist tactical and political ob-
 jectives.  EAM's military arm, ELAS, could have resisted the Axis more
 effectively if it had not been primarily concerned with achieving
 political domination.  It is doubtful if EAM-ELAS contributed much to the
 liberation of Greece or to the success of the Allied military effort.
 During the war. ELAS claimed as many as 65,000 armed members and
 it is with this force that it launched the December 1944 revolt.  The
 revolt was probably supported by 35 percent of the Greek population and
 was terminated by British intervention.
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORm4kTION
 B.  The Guerrilla War, 1946-49
 In the fall of 1946, the Communists began another armed insurrection,
 using guerrilla tactics.  The principal objective was to bring Greece
 within the Soviet orbit and, secondarily, to prevent the West from:,
 creating a situation of strength in a strategic area.
 The uprising had the support of about 10 percent of the population
 and approximately 40,000 persons participated in guerrilla activity.  Of
 these, a maximum of 25,000 were actively engaged in operations; probably
 another 10,000 were in reserve outside of Greece.  The government forces,
 including the police-gendarmerie and the civil guard, totaled some
 250,000.
 The overwhelming sentiment of the Greek people was anti-guerrilla,
 but morale fluctuated and was affected by international conditions and
 domestic issues.  In areas controlled by the Communists, the guerrillas
 had some local support, but on the whole it was forced rather than
 voluntary.  Since the guerrillas failed to hold populated areas for any
 length of time, their effectiveness in propaganda and espionage was
 spasmodic.  There were no non-Communist insurrectionary groups which the
 KKE could exploit.
 The principal areas controlled by the guerrillas were along the
 frontiers with Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria.  By the middle of 1948,
 guerrillas had appeared throughout the mountainous regions of Greece and
 in the islands of the Aegean, Lesvos (Mitilini),.and Samos.  The main
 operations took place at Grammos Vitsi and at the juncture of the Greek,
 Albanian, and Yugoslav borders; tactical operations were conducted in
 Peloponnessos and Central Greece.
 Beginning with hit-and-run operations by bands of 10 to 50,
 guerrilla tactics had developed by 1948 to attacks on toxin by forces of
 from 100 to 2,000 men.  In 1949, the guerrillas tried to employ orthodcx
 military tactics involving holding operations.
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Logistic support of the guerrillas came primarily from Albania,
 Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria.  The volume of this support has not been
 estimated satisfactorily.
 The guerrilla war seriously affected Greek economic and political
 stability and it was primarily US aid and advice which saved the country
 from a complete collapse.  The insurrection postponed the economic and
 social reconstruction of Greece for three years and divided Greek
 political circles on both domestic and foreign policy.
 C.  The Present Situation
 Current KKE policy is to refrain from any activity which will
 provoke drastic measures against its underground apparatus or against its
 front organization, EDA.  KKE does not now appear to have the strength
 and popular support to resort to violence, and there is no prospect for
 a Communist armed uprising in Greece at present.  Although no violent
 demonstrations have taken place since the defeat of the guerrillas in
 the summer of 1949, the Communists are capable of limited acts of violence
 for diversionary purposes.  The Communists could organize orderly demon-
 strations through EDA but will probably refrain from doing so for the
 time being in order to avoid jeopardizing their front organization.
 No information is available on Communist plans for creating or
 activating military resistance organizations in the event of war.  It
 is reasonable to assume, however, that such plans exist or are being
 formulated by the top KKE leadership.  In an East-Vest war, the Greek
 Communist apparatus would be capable of sabotage.  In a localized war
 between Greece and an orbit country (Albania or Bulgaria), Greek Communists
 would split on the national issue and the KKE would find it difficult to
 carry out sabotage to any appreciable extent.  On the outbreak of conflict,
 the present EDA leadership would either withdraw or be liquidated and KKE
 underground operatives would try to take over, although many Communist
 cells would probably break up in the event of a localized Balkan war.
 Circumstantial evidence indicates that the KKE has stocks of
 hidden weapons and equipment in Greece, and more can be infiltrated from
 Albania and Bulgaria and from across the Aegean and Adriatic Seas.  A
 maximum of some 20,000 to 25,000 combat-trained Greek Communists, both
 men and women, are readily available to the KKE from within the Soviet
 orbit; this figure could be increased to about 30,000 to 40,000 by drawing
 upon other Greeks living in the orbit.  Underground recruiting in Greece
 could yield about 5,000 persons in the initial stages.
 In some respects, the Communist underground apparatus in Greece
 is a paramilitary organization.  Vestiges of the wartime OPLA (Organ-
 ization for the Protection of Popular Security) still exist.  It was re-
 organized in 1947 as CDA (Democratic Security Organization), the
 terroristic and assassination unit of the M.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORWTION
 ODA -- or its current equivalent -- is presently inactive, but
 it is probably kept in a state of readiness.  Its strength is not known
 but. it is reasonable to assume that it is centered in Athens-Piraeus and
 Salonica.  ODA is a mobile organization and its members probably possess
 enough weapons -- pistols for the most part, and hand grenades and sub-
 machine guns in some cases.  The quality of its leadership is difficult to
 determine on the basis of available information, but usually the most
 fanatic and capable KKE members, many of whom have a criminal record, are
 recruited for this branch of Communist activity.
 A variety of interlocking "self-defense" units have been reported,
 but little is-known of their present status.  For example, the OA
 (Self-Defense Organization) was subordinated in January 1951 to KOSSA
 (Communist Organization of the Army and Security Corps).  QA is also
 known as the "People's Avengers" (Laikoi Ekdikitai).  Units of the OA are
 organized in three groups of three men each, under the command of a tenth
 man who is also responsible for the weapons.  These "vigilance" officers
 are kept ready, under pseudonyms, for any assignments calling for
 violence.
 It is not known whether the MIA (Wide Popular Self-Defense),
 created in 1945, is still in existence.  This was the first para-military
 organization formed by the Comtmmnists after the collapse of the December
 1944 revolt.  The Narrow Self-Defense and the Democratic Army (the
 Communist guerrillas) were able to draw upon MIA for well-disciplined re-
 inforcements.
 Sufficient data are not available to evaluate the current status
 of these paramilitary branches of the KKE.  However, their capacity for
 expansion and action is contingent upon the success of the Greek security
 organs in uncovering "vigilance" operators. To date, the record of the
 Greek police in this respect has been good.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 The Greek Communist Party (EKE) and its affiliated organizations
 were outlawed in 1947.  A leftist party appeared in the elections of 1950,
 which developed as the legal front of the NIC; under the name United
 Democratic Left (EDA).  There is enough evidence of its ties with the EKE
 to warrant suppression, but neither the recent government of the center,
 nor the present right-wing government of the Greek Rally have taken action
 against it.  Under the center government, EDA's weekly party organ and
 youth organization were suppressed.  Under the Rally government, however,
 the party enjoys the freedom accorded to the opposition parties and its
 daily newspaper continues to be published.  The. government has the capa-
 bility and popular support to repress any Communist-front group.
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 While the effectiveness of the underground organization of the 8M
 cannot be estimated, some idea as to its efficiency can be gleaned from
 the effective support it gave EDA in the elections of 1952.  The MM was
 able to resolve the divided opinion in EDA on electoral tactics, ordering
 the front group to run its own ticket and preventing cooperation with the
 center parties.
 V.  C04MUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR'
 There are no data available on the number of Commmmists in defense
 plants and other key industries, such as railways, ccmmnunicatione,
 shipping, and chemical industries.  In Athens Piraeus and Salonica,
 probably 30-50 percent of the industrial workers are EDA sympathizers.  The
 percentage of Communist sympathizers in the communications system is
 smeller, since it is mostly under indirect government supervision.
 The General Confederation of Labor (GSEE) has managed to prevent
 Communists from holding crucial posts in its organization, and has been
 countering Communist infiltration. ?EDA su ports the labor organization
 known as ESKE (United Trade Union Movement), which was organized in
 June 1950.  Its membership is not Down.  There are, in addition, several
 unions strongly influenced by ESKE on the national level,.such as the
 Tobacco Workers' Union in Salonica, which has about 5,300 members, . but' the
 total number of-Communist members is difficult to. determine.
 None of the labor organizations operating within Greek law are
 affiliated with international Communist confederations, such as WF"1V.  What"
 the KKE calla the "elected" GSEE (which exists now only in Com unist propew.
 ganda) belongs to the WFTU.  The present GSEE is regarded by the K   as
 "appointed," and is affiliated with the pro-Western ICFTV.
 VI.  C0 E4UNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL. AND PRO FESSIONAL     T
 Organizations which were known to be Communist-controlled are out-
 lawed, but the KKE continues to use their names in its propaganda.                        Some
 of them went underground and many were absorbed by  )A.  Little is knawsa
 of EDA activity in these fields.
 The extent of Communist infiltration into non-Communist organi.
 zations cannot be estimated, either in general or in connection.v th
 particular organizations.  Available reports on Communist infiltration are
 inconclusive.
 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERZ~'.
 A.  National and Mianicipal Legislatures
 There are no known or declared Communists in the national legis-
 lature.                        The Parliament elected in 1951 had 10.  A. deputies, who voiced
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 the Communist line in domestic and international affairs, out of a total
 of 258 members.  The .present Parliament, elected on November 16, 1952, has
 no EDA representation.
 On the local level, the Communists. through the "Democratic Front"
 (now EDA), attained a majority in 13(665%) municipal councils of a total
 of 218 which were elected April 15,.1951.  Of the total municipal council-
 men elected (1,840), about 10 percent (187) belong to the "Democratic
 Front."  Ectreme leftist mayors of the "Democratic Front" were elected in
 11  municipalities:
 Egaleo      in Attika   - A. Stingos
 Vyron       in Attika   - A. Kostantileris
 Elefsis      in Attika   -  Geo. Rigos
 Kaisariani  in Attika   -  D. Manolidis
 Keratsini   in Attika   - A. Patsilinakos

 Patras      in Attika.. - V. Roufos
 Kavalla      in Kavalla: -  Emm. Melissakis
 Larissa      in Larissa  -  D. Karathanos
 a. A resort community for wealthy Athenians.
 B.  Armed Forces
 While the influence of.the Communists and their sympathizers in
 top levels of the armed forces is nil, the lower ranks contain a leftist
 element of about 2-5 percent.  Two percent of the army vote in 1951, was
 for EDA, as compared with its civilian vote of about 10 percent.   (In the
 1952 elections, the army did not take part. as, a separate entity.)
 The underground organization of the KKE for the armed forces,.known
 as KOSSA (Communist Organization of the Army and Security Corps) s pre-
 sumably has agents in military circles.  Little evidence has been reported
 of its effectiveness.
 C.  Police
 No data are available on Communist infiltration in the police and
 security services.

 D.  Administration
 The number of Communists in the national and municipal administration
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 cannot be ascertained.  No estimate exists of the percentage of civil
 servants who voted for EDA.  The total number of civil servants in the
 national government is about 80,000.  It is probable that about 20-30
 percent are EDA sympathizers.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 Data inadequate to draw reliable conclusions.
 IX.  CONW?UNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-CONMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 Communist influence in right wing organizations and parties is
 difficult to ascertain inthe case of Greece.  It is reasonable to assume
 that the Communists have planted their agents in conservative circles,
 whose object is probably to affect the top levels rather than influence
 the rank and file.  It is probable that some of the 31 deputies of the
 left-of-center party EPEK have Communist connections.  There is enough
 evidence for at least one to be suspected as a crypto-Communist,
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 A.  News-papers and Periodicals
 Communist newspapers and periodicals are illegal in Greece.
 Nevertheless, the Communist underground prints and circulates
 clandestinely the principal long-standing organ of the KKE,'Rzosnastis,
 and other old or new titles, which appear at varying intervals and in
 various parts of Greece.  Another publication of the' EKE appearing
 irregularly is Neos Cosmos (New World), which reproduces texts of Central
 Committee pronouncements.  Youth publications are:  Flow. (Flame), organ
 of the Communist underground student organization which shows Athens as
 its place of publication; and Leventia (Youthful Manhood) and Neos
 Agonistis (New Fighter), organs of the KKE youth organization, EPON.
 Publication of the clandestine Communist papers is irregular and the
 number of copies circulated unknown.
 EDA puts out a number of publications, which are not as openly
 Communist as those published clandestinely by the M.  Its first official
 organ, Dimokratiki, which began publication in August 1951, was suppressed
 by the center government on January 19, 1952.  No circulation figures of
 EDAts publications are available.  During the election period (October-
 November 1952), the caretaker government allowed EDA to publish Av i
 (Dawn) as a daily organ, and its publication has continued under the right
 wing Greek Rally government.  It started as a weekly, claiming 50,000
 circulation.  Its circulation figures as a daily are not available.  EDA
 published a weekly called Isonolitia (Civil Rights Equality), but infor-
 mation on its present status is not available.  It also published
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Frouri tis Irinis (Guardians of Peace), which was suppressed, together
 with Dimokratiki, on January 19, 1952.  This was intended to disseminate
 the youth organization EDNE's propaganda on the Communist peace campaign.
 It is not known if another publication took its place.
 1.  Printing Establishments.    Underground Communist printing establish-
 ments exist.  Indicative of how well the underground press operates is the
 fact that Rizospastis has had a continuous (although irregular) publication
 since the M. was outlawed in 1947.
 2.  Import of Publications from Abroad.  Communist publications can
 only be smuggled into Greece, and consequently, few are imported from
 abroad.  No data are available on this traffic in Communist literature.
 There is some ground for suspicion that certain issues of R'z~ ospastis
 are printed abroad.  Soviet-satellite diplomatic establishments in
 Athens issue frequent press releases.  The Soviet Embassy is not known to
 release publications of any significance.
 B.  Radio
 There are no domestic broadcasting stations in Greece controlled
 or influenced by Communists.  Communist broadcasts, however,, are beamed
 to Greece from Moscow and all satellite capitals.  The main station
 broadcasting in Greek is radio "Free Greece," operating probably from
 Rumania as the KKE's principal medium of communication.
 Radio "Free Greece" has proved effective in communicating with
 the KKEts underground organization.  It can be heard in most parts of
 Greece and reaches the Greek communities in the Near East.  No attempt
 has been made so far to estimate its audience.  Greek broadcasts from
 Radio Moscow and satellite countries are secondary to radio "Free Greece.
 They frequently quote KNE broadcasts.  The size of their audience in
 Greece is also unknown, but is certainly less than that of radio "Free
 Greece."
 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 The financial condition of the KKE is unknown.  The underground
 in Greece counts on collections and contributions from party members and
 sympathizers.  It is unable, however, to extract sizable funds by ex-
 tortion as it used to do before it was outlawed, although it still uses
 this method on a very limited scale.  Evidence indicates that for oper-
 ations and specific activities in Greece funds have been imported from
 abroad.  On the basis of available data no estimate can readily be made
 of the total financial assets of the KKE.

 XII.  SOVIET-SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 A.      -M tic Establishments
 The only Soviet bloc countries with which Greece has diplomatic
 relations are the USSR and Czechoslovakia.  The Soviet Embassy in Athens
 .is small, consisting (as of October 1952) of about 5 individuals, headed
 by a charge d'affaires, all of whom are listed as living in the
 chancellery.  The Czechoslovak Legation in Athens is small.
 There is practically no political activity on the part of orbit
 diplomatic. representatives in Greece.  Reports in 1946 and 1947*indicated
 that bloc undercover agents have operated in Greece, but there has been
 no information of their existence since then.  If the bloc diplomats in
 Greece are now engaged in political activity of any significant nature,
 it must be covert.  The only Soviet reception reported was held on
 November 7, 1950.  It was well attended by the foreign diplomatic corps
 in Athens.
 The USSR and Poland had representatives on the UN Balkan
 Commission in 1947, but subsequently withdrew their delegates.  Since
 then, no Soviet bloc representatives have participated in UN observation
 groups in the Balkans.
 XIII.  COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 The KKE participates in Communist international organizations
 and conferences, but since the party is illegal there is no opportunity
 for participation-from within Greece.  EDA conducts no observable relations
 with international Communist bodies.  This is left to the KKE, which
 operates from within the Soviet orbit and through its agents in Western
 capitals.

 Greek police discovered and raided on November 34, 1951, was in operation
 for several years.  This suggests, and there is evidence, that more W/T
 stations are in operation.  About the same time another clandestine W/T
 station at Glyfada (outside Athens) was uncovered.  Bucharest (Rumania)
 was the focal point of traffic from and to these stations.. It was rumored
 in May 1952 that another secret transmitter had been discovered in the
 Kilkis area of Northern Greece.  Nothing farther was reported of this, bat
 indications are that the Communists have enough transmitters in Greece
 to carry on their espionage uninterruptedly.
 It has been established from the messages captured from the W/T
 transmitters in Kallithea and Glyfada that EDA receives instructions from
 KBE leaders in the Soviet orbit. This was also seen clearly from the
 radio "Free Greece" broadcasts in connection with the recent elections in
 Greece.  KKE ordered EDA to run on its own ticket, and this was carried
 out without deviation.  EDA was also in consultation with the KKE on the
 selection of candidates.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN INDIA:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 The objectives of the Indian Communist Party, as set forth in
 an article by its General Secretary, A. K. Ghosh, in the December 1952
 issue of For a Lasting Peace, For a People's Democracy, are defined as
 the "liquidation of all vestiges of British rule,    defense of the
 National independence and sovereignty threatened by the American
 aggressors," the "preservation of Peace," and. the "promotion of a life
 of happiness for the people."  Yrhile current developments do not pro-
 vide many striking opportunities for the party to work towards the
 fulfillment of the first objective set forth above, the party does
 attack India's membership in the Commonwealth and British vested
 interests in India on every.possible occasion.  Frith regard to the
 second objective, the US Technical Assistance program and activities
 provides a major target and it is clear that an immediate objective
 of the CPI is to hinder so far as possible the community development
 projects undertaken with US financial and technical aid, and to dis-
 courage public cooperation with these projects.
 An additional set of objectives in the general field of foreign
 affairs is given in a list of the basic tasks facing the party drawn
 up by the General Secretary in the spring of 1952 following the general
 elections.  These include a five-power peace pact; "solidarity with
 colonial peoples fighting for freedom"; friendship and closer economic
 ties between India and the USSR and China; withdrawal of the Kashmir
 issue from the-UN; and the development of a peace pact between India,
 Pakistan, and Ceylon.   In the main these objectives primarily fulfill
 tho foreign policy requirements of the USSR rather than promote the
 party's domestic political fortunes.
 However, as indicated in many party. documents, Indian Communists
 are most actively concerned with building the party's organizational
 strength, particularly among labor and peasant groups, and some of
 the party's most prominent immediate objectives are designed to further
 this end.  Among the basic tasks facing the party today, as outlined
 in the General Secretary's post-election report, are the follcwing:
 the development of a broad-based mass movement for civil liberties,
 including repeal of the Preventive Detention Act; intensification of
 the movement for linguistic provinces; the building of a, "united move-
 ment for help to the people in the famine-stricken areas" to force
 government to increase relief measures, and "to mobilize people for
 adequate rations and against rise in prices of food-stuffs."
 Barring the dictation of a new line by Moscow, it now appears
 improbable that the party will in  tiic   immediate future revise its
 objectives or shift the relative emphasis among those it now pursues.

 II.  TACTICS
 Present tactics of the CPI are characterized by attempts (1) to
 form, where possible, working alliances with left-wing or other anti-
 Congress political organizations with a view to building a united front;
 (2) to win a direct following and popular support among all social
 segments, particularly peasants, workers, students, and intellectuals;
 (3) to utilize constitutional procedures; and (4) to exploit its mem-
 bership in the central and a number of the state legislative assemblies.
 Insofar as the party abides by constitutional procedures a
 principal method of propaganda consists in its legislative activities
 which enable party leaders in both the central and state legislatures
 to put forward the party line and to express their opposition to the
 Congress government program.  In recent months there have been numerals
 and recurring opportunities for the party legislators to press their
 demands for civil liberties and for the formation of linguistic provinces.
 A principal motif of the party's propaganda appeals outside the legis-
 latures is its use of "peace" movements to win support.  To a certain
 extent the Communists specialize their appeals to various groups, and
 the "peace" propaganda is largely directed towards intellectuals,
 students, and other urban groups, whereas among peasants the emphasis
 is on agrarian problems.
 The Communist Party does not hesitate to form alliances with
 left-wing or even, sub-rosa, with anti-Congress right-wing political
 parties in the legislative assemblies and for election purposes, when
 some advantage is to be gained.  Such inter-party arrangements are not
 always for the purpose of augmenting the party's voting strength, but
 are sometimes designed to reduce the strength of the Congress-dominated
 faction and if possible to keep that party out of office.  On occasion,
 and to a limited extent, sacrifices have been made by the. party to
 preserve such alliances and, where they have broken down, as in Madras,
 it has so far been due to. the action of the allies rather than the
 Communist Party.
 There is little evidence that the Communists at present, in
 spite of their emphasis on the development of a united front, are
 making concessions in their program to win the adherence of groups
 usually considered beyond their reach.  The party's extra-territorial
 loyalties, for example, are a definite liability as far as all non-
 Communist groups are concerned, yet the party does little to play them
 down.  On the other hand, the Communists are able to capitalize on the
 anti-foreignism and anti-imperialism which is universal in India, and
 on the definitely pro-Chinese sentiments of the literate population.
 Dissatisfaction with prevailing domestic policies of the Congress
 government is played upon with considerable success.

 Although the party is now work-''g along constitutional lines,
 the leaders have not hesitated to state from time to time that the
 Communists would resort to violence to attain their ends should this
 become necessary.  In fact, along with legitimate activities the party
 or those directly under its influence has continued to engage in armed
 violence in certain areas, notably South India and PEPSU (Patiala and
 East Punjab States Union).  There are indications that party leaders,
 foreseeing the possibility of a ban on Communist activities in certain
 States, or even in the country as a whole, are preparing for increased
 underground activity.
 At the present time, the party uses trade unions and "pease"
 movements as vehicles of propaganda, and to a lesser extent, as pressure
 groups.   In rural areas where direct action has been resorted to,
 peasant organizations are used to stir up the agrarian population and
 to enlist support for subversive activities.
 The recent general elections revealed a marked weakness in
 Communist influence among the working classes.  Probably partly because
 of this lack of strength and capability, the party in recent months
 has seldom resorted to strike tactics in the trade unions which they
 control.   Communist labor leaders, however, frequently join in or
 support strikes which they have not instigated, and claim credit for
 any concessions secured.
 With regard to the methods used by the Communist Party to recruit
 and retain members, it is believed that active proselytising is carried
 out among student groups and labor organizations, and that a certain
 selection is exercised through a period of indoctrination and probation.
 Discipline appears to be strict, and to work fairly effectively to
 retain members in the party.
 There is growing evidence that the CPI receives both instructions
 and financial help from agencies and organs of the USSR in India.  An
 important source of financial aid is the large number of books and
 printed materials brought into the country as part of the Soviet informa-
 tion program and sold at low cost for the benefit of the Indian Communist
 Party.   It is possible that party leaders are now under the direct
 influence and guidance of the Soviet Embassy officials.
 Insofar as a major current objective of the Indian Communist
 Party is to build up its organizational strength, the party is probably
 in a stronger position than ever before to achieve a degree of success.
 The party's victories in the 1951-52 elections have enhanced its capa-
 bilities for political action in the sense of providing a platform for
 party propaganda and for attacks on the government policy and program.

 Hitherto, the party has suffered from dissension within its
 ranks and has periodically been greatly handicapped by a lack of unity
 among the leaders and a confusion based on conflicting views regarding
 policy and tactics.  The establishment, during the past few years, of
 increasingly direct contacts with Soviet Union officials should go far
 towards reducing this factionalism and confusion, and so increase the
 party's organizational strength.
 How far the party will succeed in its efforts to increase its
 influence and widen its control over the trade unions is doubtful.
 The results of the general elections revealed that the party had
 little strength in this sector, and it may not even with increased
 efforts be able to make such headway against its rivals, the labor
 organizations dominated by the Congress and the Socialists.
 Conditions seem somewhat more favorable for success in enlisting
 peasant support and building up effective peasant organizations.
 Agrarian unrest is widespread, and prospects for substantial improve-
 ment in rural standards of living in the near future are not bright.
 The Communists do not appear to be making much headway with the
 movement for a United Front of leftist parties, and it is probable that
 an alignment of non-Communist leftist groups will have the effect of
 isolating the Communist Party.
 To a considerable extent,party capabilities in respect to
 organization depend upon the attitude of the Indian Government and the
 various state governments towards the party.   Present indications are
 that the governments' attitudes are gradually crystalizing and that the
 dangers inherent in the Indian Communist movement are receiving more
 and more recognition.   It is possible therefore that the Indian
 Communist Party, at least in certain areas, may be driven underground.
 The party's capacities in regard to building. organizational strength,
 and to achieving its other objectives, would be, thereby, greatly
 impaired.

 COMI4JNISM IN INDIA:  ASSETS
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 The Communist Party of India has an estimated membership of about
 50,000.  This figure reflects the probable increase since October 1951
 when the party claimed.30,000 members. The size of the party's following
 is roughly indicated by the more than 4,700,000 votes received by
 Communist Party or front candidates for the national legislature in the
 1951-52 general elections.
 While the geographic distribution and class composition of the
 Communist membership is not definitely known, analysis of recent election
 returns indicates a concentration of Communist strength in south India
 (Travancore-Cochin, Hyderabad, and Madras) and West Bengal, and greater
 Communist support in rural areas than in the major industrial centers
 of the country.  The larger segment of its urban support consists of
 middle-class intellectuals and white collar workers rather than members
 of the industrial working classes.
 The quality of the party membership has seldom been tested, and
 no useful conclusions can yet be drawn.  During the Telengana disturbances
 in 1948-50, numerous small bands of Communist-affected "hostiles" ravaged
 the countryside and eluded several thousand government troops for an
 extended period.  In the general elections of 1951-52, the party line of
 constitutional opposition was generally adhered to, but Communist strength
 grew more from general anti-government sentiment than from the popular
 appeal of Communist 'doctrine.
 Stability in point of total membership is not a characteristic of
 the Indian Communist Party.  In February 1948, the party claimed 100,000
 members; in October 1951, only 30,000.  This decrease was caused by
 internal dissension and a policy of repression on the part of the central
 and state governments.  Since the election campaign of late 1951, member-
 ship has increased to an estimated 50,000.
 In its fluctuations since 1946, Communist Party membership has
 probably never fallen below 20,000.  This would appear to represent the
 "hard core," almost one-half of the present party.  This "hard. core"
 seems to be strongest in those areas of greatest electoral strength and
 is drawn from practically every social classy with probably a majority
 from the urban middle and working classes.  Members of the "hard core"
 as a whole are estimated to average 30 years of age, with 8 years of
 membership in the party; leaders of the "hard core" average 45 years of
 age with 20 years of membership.

 The Communist leadership is in general well-educated and able,
 but the party has lacked leaders with the qualities necessary to attract
 the Indian masses.  The effectiveness of the leadership has also been
 lessened by personal rivalries and disputes over policy and tactics.
 From 1948 until 1951 there was serious dissension within the party with
 several strong local leaders unable to establish clear title to national
 leadership.  The most serious internal differences were, however,
 resolved by mid-1951 and since that time the leadership has functioned.
 more harmoniously.  Since the 1951-52 elections, the several provincial
 segments of the party have found a focus in the national Parliament,
 .where the Communist delegation effectively directs party activity
 throughout the country, ably assisted by Communist representatives in
 provincial legislatures.
 II.  EIECTORAL STRENGTH
 The Communist Party, together with front or fellow-traveller
 affiliates, polled 4,712,009 votes in India's first national elections,.
 held between October 1951 and March 1952.  These votes represent 4.45
 percent of the valid total cast and won the party 23 seats in the House
 of the People, the lower house of Parliament.  Other Marxist, far left
 splinter parties received approximately 1,500,000 votes (about 1.4
 percent of the total) and four seats.  The over-all Communist and near-
 Communist vote, including an, approximation for independents on whom
 specific data are not available, was between six and seven percent of
 the total vote.
 In elections to the state assemblies, the total Communist vote
 was somewhat larger, approximately 6,100,000 or 6 percent of the total.
 Other far left parties gained approximately 1,200,000 votes or one
 percent of the total.  Independent candidates with Communist sympathies
 would probably increase the far left vote by about another one percent.
 By-elections since M rch 1952 do not indicate any trend in
 Communist Party strength.
 A comparison of Communist electoral strength with the strength
 of other major parties in the national Parliament (489 seats) follows:

 III,  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 The present policy of the Indian Communist Party is to refrain from
 violent demonstrations, except perhaps to a limited degree under special
 circumstances, but at the same time to maintain close contact with
 dissident groups and to join demonstrations when they occur.  Most recent
 demonstrations cannot be attributed to the Communists alone, although
 they have contributed significantly to some of those which have occurred.
 In December 1952, a series of demonstrations were staged to protest a
 state sales tax in Saurashtra, and two Communists were on the committee
 of 10 which directed the action.  Communists were conspicuously present
 in the Hyderabad City riots over the employment of non-Hyderabadis and
 in the massed demonstrations demanding the formation of a separate state
 of Andhra.  Over the past year, there has been continuing but sporadic
 violence against landowners in PEPSU (Patiala and East Punjab States
 Union) in which it is thought the Communists have had a leading part.
 It is known that the Communists are attempting to strengthen their
 underground apparatus but details are not available and nothing is known
 concerning any plans that the party may have for engaging in violence in
 the future.  There have been reports of armed Communist groups in Tripura
 and considerable numbers of Communists in Hyderabad are believed to have
 arms.  There may also be small armed groups elsewhere.  Several thousand
 members of the party have had past experience in riots and other violent
 tactics, but any precise estimate of their number is impossible.
 It is impossible to estimate the maximum number that the Communist
 Party could mobilize for violent demonstrations at present, but where an
 issue of importance to a specific group was involved, particularly a
 problem concerning regional susceptibilities, several thousand people
 could certainly be rallied.
 In March 1948 the party inaugurated a policy of violence and terror
 on the assumption that India was ripe for a proletarian revolution.
 Strikes; sabotage of railways, munition plants, and public utilities;
 mutiny in infiltrated armed services; arson; bomb-throwing; and murder
 were the weapons used in this civil warfare, and there was a consequent
 alienation of public sympathy from the Communist cause.  In South India,
 the Andhra branch of the party, although opposed by the Communist high
 command, followed the Chinese path of agrarian revolt and of building
 rural bases of armed strength, and succeeded in bringing a large area
 on both sides of the Madras-Hyderabad border under Communist control.
 There is no reliable estimate of the total number of people involved
 in the 1948-50 period of violence but over 5,000 Communists were jailed.
 There were probably 2,000 to 3,000 involved in the Telengana area of
 Hyderabad and Madras.  Other centers of violence where possibly several

 hundreds were engaged were in the states of Assam, Tripura and Manipur, and
 Calcutta in northeast India, and in the Tanjore and Kerala parts of
 Madras state and in the state of Travancore-Cochin in south India.
 IV. GOVERNMENT POLICY TCWARD CO*dJNISM
 The Communist Party, although outlawed in several states during the
 1948-50 period of violence, is now legal throughout India and with its
 front organizations has full freedom in parliamentary and other legal
 activities.    Under the constitution, the national and state governments
 have the powers of preventive detention in cases involving the security
 of a state, the maintenance of public order, or the maintenance of
 essential supplies or services.  Ordinarily, detention without trial
 beyond three months must be authorized by an Advisory Board composed of
 persons who have the qualifications of High Court Judges but the Preventive
 Detention Act of 1950, renewed and amended by the House of the People,
 permits detention for periods up to a year without reference to an Advisory
 Board in cases involving India's security, defense, or foreign relations;
 the security of a state; or the maintenance of public order.  The Advisory
 Board may authorize a continuance of imprisonment so that in effect the
 government may detain a person indefinitely.  During the period of
 Communist violence in.1948-50, the government made extensive use of the
 power of preventive detention.
 Since independence, the size of the Indian police forces has been
 appreciably increased.  The central Intelligence Bureau and the state
 Criminal Investigation Departments are believed to have an extensive
 network of informers in the Communist Party and its fronts.  The higher
 levels of army and police forces, and most of the lower ranks, are
 loyal to the government and at present the government appears capable
 of repressing the party to a great extent, although undoubtedly some
 Communist leaders would escape detection and some underground activity
 could continue.
 V.  COM41JNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 Most of the 3,000 primary unions in the country belong to one of
 the four major federations of unions.  Since the federations are closely
 identified with political parties, affiliation is largely a matter of
 political rather than economic considerations.  The largest federation
 in the country, the Indian National Trade Union Congress (IITUC) has a
 total membership of 1,435,258, and is affiliated with the Congress Party.
 The All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) was the only central labor
 organization in India prior to World War II and was non-partisan in
 character; it came,under Communist control during the war, and remains
 today an organ of the Indian Communist Party.  It has 606,194 members
 organized in 729 unions.  The Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS) is the labor

 organ of the Socialist Party, representing 464 unions with 704,987
 workers.  The United Trade Union Congress (UTUC), established in 1949
 as a reaction against the policy of violence imposed.by the Commmists
 on member unions of the AITUC, represents about 300,000 workers.
 Indian labor unions do not exert the same control and discipline
 over members that US unions do.  Frequently, the unions are nothing more
 than    very loose associations of workers who have little organization,
 pay no dues, and do not operate as a united force.  Thus, figures as to
 total strength, which all unions greatly exaggerate, may be very
 misleading.
 Information available does not permit a comparative analysis of
 union strengths within industries.  There is no industry which can be
 said to be unionized by any particular federation; all groups have
 influence in various industries.  Geographically, Communist trade union
 strength is greatest in Calcutta, the Andhra area of Madras, and Bombay
 city.  Of the total unionized labor force in India, the Communist unions
 may have very roughly 10-.25 percent.
 Some of the locals in the United Trade Union Congress (UTUC) may
 be influenced by Communists but no specific evidence is available.
 At the end of 1950, AITUC claimed 729 unions but a complete listing
 of them including the plants involved, is not available.  Some specific
 information for Bombay, which is evaluated by the collector as probably
 true, is given in the three tables below:

 VI.  COMMJNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 The All India Youth Federation is a Communist-controlled organiza-
 tion affiliated with the World Federation of Democratic Youth.  Its
 numerical strength and its strength relative to that of other youth
 organizations are unknown, but all youth organizations in India are
 known to be weak.  The Federation's leadership is mediocre.  The organiza-
 tion has as its objective the establishment of a united front with other
 youth groups.  Its capabilities are probably very moderate.
 The All India Students Federation (AISF) is Communist-controlled
 and is affiliated with the International Union of Students and the World
 Federation of Democratic Youth.  Its membership probably does not exceed
 a few hundred and its leadership is ineffective.  The AISF convention in
 June 1951 stated that the organization's first aim was the unity of the
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 student movement, which was to be achieved not by an insistance on the
 acceptance of a particular philosophy or ideology but only by promoting
 the day-to-day interests of the students.
 The Mahila Atma Raksha Samita (MARS) is a Communist-controlled
 women's organization.  Its membership probably does not exceed 200
 and the organization is relatively unimportant as compared with the
 All India Women's Conference, a non-party but predominantly Congress
 organization.  The leadership of MARS is inferior to that of the All
 India Women's Conference.  A member of MARS attended the November 1949
 meeting of the Women's International Democratic Federation, but it is
 not known whether MARS is an affiliate.
 The All India Progressive Writers Association (AIPWA) is a
 Communist-controlled professional organization.  The size of its member-
 ship is unknown, but there are provincial branches in Bengal, Uttar
 Pradesh, and Bombay and local ones in Bhopal, Hyderabad City, Bangalore,
 and Gauhati.  Although weaker than similar non-Communist groups, the
 AIPWA is nonetheless very active and some of its members have substantial
 literary reputations.  Its main objective is to contribute to the over-
 all Communist propaganda effort.
 The membership of the Communist-controlled Indian People's
 Theater Association (IPTA) is unknown but there are branches throughout
 India.  In comparison with other similar groups it ranks fairly high and
 the quality of its leadership is good.  It contributes to the Communist
 propaganda effort through such media as plays and dances.  Its
 capabilities are fairly good..
 The All India Friends of the Soviet Union (AIFSU) has branches
 in Bombay, Calcutta, Lashkai, Jamshedpur, Muzaffarpur, Madanpalle,
 Nellore, Ahmedabad, and Wardha.  Its numerical strength is unknown.
 AIFSU's primary function is to conduct propaganda through cultural
 exchanges.
 The Indo-China Friendship Association has branches in Calcutta,
 Bombay, Patiala, Debra Dun, and probably elsewhere.  No information is
 available on the number of members or the quality of its leadership.
 Like AIFSU, it is primarily concerned with cultural exchange as a
 propaganda weapon.
 The All India Peace Council (AIPC) has over a score of provincial
 and sub-provincial branches.  Its main centers are in Calcutta, Madras,
 and Bombay.  The AIPC is associated with the World Peace Congress and
 sends delegates to major Communist-sponsored international "peace"
 meetings.  Its primary purpose is to serve as a vehicle for Communist
 "peace" propaganda.

 There are no known Communist front organizations based on racial,
 religious, or nationality distinctions, although the Communist Party
 directs special appeals to the minority communities.  The Chinese
 consulate has made strenuous efforts to organize and control the roughly
 10,000 Chinese -- about half of India's Chinese population -- resident
 in Calcutta.  At present the community is split with the Communists
 controlling perhaps 30 percent of it.
 There is also fragmentary information which indicates that efforts
 have been made by agencies of the Czechoslovak Government to win over
 the tiny Czech communities centered in Batanagar in West Bengal.
 In addition to the above organizations, which represent the most
 important groups created or captured by the Communist Party, there are
 a number of others of lesser importance controlled by or infiltrated by
 Communists.  Information concerning these is almost entirely absent.  A
 list of some of these organizations is presented below:
 Playback Singers Association
 India Cultural League
 Kerala Tyojalali Sava Sangh
 Vichar Vikas Mandal
 Tyagaraj Gyan Sabha
 Teachers' Association
 The Progressive Group
 Kerala Kala Mandalam
 City (Bombay) Yuvak Mandal
 C. Ward City (Bombay) Vidyarthi Mandal
 Deddhar School of Music
 People's Academy
 The Madanpura Youth
 Trichi Scheduled Cast Federation
 Trichi Press Worker's Association
 Scientific Workers Association
 Progathisil Yuvak Sangh
 Vile Parle Youth League
 Progathi Mahila Sangh
 Lawyers' Association
 The organizations appearing in the above list are almost all  .
 located in Bombay city.  Comparable Communist-infiltrated or -controlled
 organizations can probably be found in all the major cities and large
 towns in India.  The listed organizations represent fronts in which the
 Communists are active, such as youth, labor, women's, students',
 untouchables', professional, and cultural groups.  The Communists are
 also active in sports associations and in refugee organizations.

 There is evidence of Communist infiltration into the Indian'
 Institute of Science and the Association of Scientific Workers of India.
 It is probable that other non-Communist organizations of this nature
 have also been infiltrated.
 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 As far as is known, there are no Communist Party members in the
 executive policy-making bodies of the central government or, with the
 possible exception of the State of Kashmir, of the states of the Indian
 Union.  The Congress Party controls the national government and all
 state governments except in the state of Patiala and East Punjab States
 Union (PEPSU) where a United Front of right-wing parties controls the
 government.  This United Front has recently made an opportunistic deal
 with the three Communist members of the state's legislative assembly
 but this does not give the Communist Party much influence in the state
 government.
 There have been conflicting reports of Communists or fellow-
 travelers in the Kashmir government but the extent of Communist influence
 is unknown.
 A few high officials of the Indian Government, such as V.K. Krishna
 :Tenon and K.M. Panikkar have approximated certain parts of the Communist
 line in their utterances but the amount of influence they exert within
 the government is uncertain.
 The number of Communists or sympathizers in the armed services
 is unknown but believed to be small, as strenuous efforts have been made
 to uncover and dismiss them.
 Reports indicate that Communists are attempting to infiltrate the
 police forces.  In general, there has been only limited success, although
 in West Bengal, Travancore-Cochin, and Madras infiltration has been more
 extensive than elsewhere.  In early January 1953, there was a fairly
 serious revolt by the civil police in Madras which the military helped
 to  it down.  It was reported. that the Communists controlled the executive
 or negotiating body of the Madras constabulary association.  There is no
 evidence of Communist influence at the top levels of the Indian police.
 India's Atomic Energy program is very small and is limited to
 mineral surveys and research.  It is not known whether
 Communists have any influence within the three man Atomic Energy
 Commission which directs the program.  There may be some Communist
 influence among other research scientists.

 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 It is evident that the extent of Communist influence in public-
 opinion-forming circles is considerable, although an estimate in
 numbers cannot be given.  This is particularly the case in entertainment
 media.   A number of films produced in India in recent years may contain
 Communist propaganda.  Films imported into India from the Soviet Union,
 China, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary represent a very small percentage of
 total film imports, but they add to the Communist propaganda effort;
 non-commercial showings of imported Communist films are said to be
 extensive.  The consensus among the motion picture industry and the
 movie-going public is, however, that Soviet films are boring and
 valueless as entertainment.  The Communists appear to have made a
 considerable study of the forms of communication and entertainment in
 rural India, and some of the more important folk forms have been adapted
 by them for use in dissemination of propaganda.  Dances,, plays, and
 dance-dramas are also used by the Communists for propaganda purposes in
 the urban areas.  The Indian Communists encourage the composition of
 propaganda songs by staging competitions.
 Communist propaganda from time to time finds its way into the
 non-Communist press.  There is some Communist infiltration of the
 reportorial staff of certain papers.  The vernacular langauge press uses
 Soviet news agency handouts rather frequently, largely because limited
 financial resources make them appreciative of any kind of matter which
 is already translated for them and which can be passed on to their
 printers with a minimum of editorial work.  A number of non-Communist
 newspapers which have large circulations relative to other Indian
 newspapers and which use TASS material (including reprints from the
 Soviet press) are listed below:

 No information is readily available on the presence of party
 members or sympathizers in All-India Radio.  Radio Moscow and Radio
 Tashkent make daily transmissions to listeners in Southeast Asia and
 English-language programs emanating from Radio Peiping can be heard in
 India.

 Communist influence in Indian educational institutions is   '
 significant. A considerable number of professors and instructors have
 been and are associated with Communist front organizations and Communists
 have infiltrated both the leadership and general membership of student
 federations.
 The number of people subject to Communist influences through these
 non-Communist channels is unknown.
 IX.   COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 There is some Communist influence, not believed to be extensive as
 yet, in the Akali Dal, a Sikh communal party.  The size of the Dal's
 membership is not known but in the 1951-52 elections it received slightly
 over 1,000,000 votes.
 Several small leftist parties which are fairly strongly influenced
 by the Communist Party are listed below:
 United Socialist Organization
 Socialist Republican Party of India
 All-India Forward Bloc (Marxist)
 Revolutionary Socialist party of India
 Socialist Unity Center
 Revolutionary Communist Party of India (Das Gupta Group)
 Bolshevik party of India
 Indian National Army
 peasants' and Workers' Party
 The Dravidian Federation
 All but the last two of these have their principal strength in
 Bengal.  The peasants' and Workers' party has most of its following in
 Bombay and Hyderabad and the Dravidian Federation is primarily a Madras
 party.

 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 Party membership fees are fixed by the Central Committee and
 are paid monthly, or, in the case of peasants, less frequently; no
 information is available on the size of the fees.   Income from them
 goes to the district committee.  The district, provincial, and central
 committees are also empowered to fix and collect levies on the income
 of party members.   Individuals occasicnally donate sums of money
 to the party.  The publication, distribution, and sale of party
 pamphlets, leaflets, and books, mainly by the Peoples' Publishing
 House, Ltd. of Bombay, is an economic enterprise of the central
 organization of the Communist Party.  The sale of publications from
 abroad is also a source of party income.  The maintenance of a party
 press is believed to be a considerable drain on the party's finances.
 It has been reliably reported that the World Federation of
 Trade Unions sent about $2,800 to the Secretary-General of the
 Communist-front All-India Trade Union Congress in 1951.  It is not un-
 likely that grants from parties in other countries as well as from
 international front organizations augment the Indian party's income.
 There have been occasional reports that Soviet and satellite govern-
 ments are directly subsidizing the Indian Communist movement but there
 is no conclusive evidence to this effect.  There have been reports
 recently that the Chinese Embassy in India has extended financial aid
 to local Indo-China Friendship Associations.
 No information regarding revenue received from party-controlled
 labor unions or front organizations is available, but receipts from
 such sources are probably small if not non-existent.  No estimate of
 the party's total assets is possible.
 It is believed that the disruption of the party organization
 as a result of government repression and the inner-party factionalism
 which arose in early 1948 out the party off from financial resources
 which it had previously commanded.  The central organization was
 apparently having a difficult time meeting expenses during the first
 half of 1951 and by the middle of the year it had hardly a month's
 reserve of funds.  This same situation seems to have obtained in all
 the provincial and district organizations.   In mid-1951 the expenses
 of the central organization amounted to about $1,400 a month; this
 was increased to about $2,000 monthly by the additional work of
 organizing a campaign in connection with the general elections,
 reviving and intensifying the work of all front organizations, and
 preparing for the holding of an All-India Party Congress.  The provincial
 and district committees also participated in this additional work and
 their limited finances also were heavily strained.

 It is believed that a significant percentage of the income
 of the Indian Communist Party goes for the maintenance of party
 organs, very few of which are self-supporting.  For example, one
 Communist periodical which began publication in May 1951 reportedly
 had incurred an indebtedness of approximately $2,400 by October of
 that year.      From time to time Communist publications such as
 Crossroads, Swadhinata, and the Indo-Soviet Journal have had to make
 special appeals to their readers and to the general public for
 contributions to help the publications meet their obligations.

 XIII.  COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 No international Communist organizations maintain offices in
 India.  The only meeting of a Communist international organization held
 in India in recent years was the Southeast Asian Youth Conference, held
 in Calcutta in February 1948; it was sponsored jointly by the World
 Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) and the International Union of
 Students (IUS).  The IUS executive committee is scheduled to meet in
 India in January 1953.

 The Indian Communist Party is believed to have an extensive
 courier system within the country, but little reliable information
 regarding it is available. It has been.reported that the TASS employees
 sometimes serve as couriers, and that motion picture film  shipments are
 used to convey party messages.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFDRMATION
 Charges that the party operates an extensive wireless system
 throughout India were made in June 1952 in the Indian Parliament.
 Confirmatory evidence of the truth of these charges is lacking,
 however.
 The closest foreign tie of the Indian Communist Party is believed
 to be with the Communist Party of Great Britain.  The Indian party for
 many years has maintained correspondence with the British party and in
 particular with R. Palme Butt.  The Communist Party of India follows
 gs best it can the general policy laid down by the Cominform.  It has
 been definitoly established that the Indian Communist Party directs the
 activities of the Communist Party of Pakistan in East Pakistan, and
 there is ample evidence that the Indian party and the Communist Party of
 Nepal maintain close liaison.  In addition, there have been a number
 of reports of contacts between Indian and Chinese Communists.  It has
 also been well established that the Indian Communists are in contact
 with the Communist Party of Burma.
 There is strong evidence that on two occasions criticisms and
 guidance from the Communist Party of Great Britain have exerted a
 dominant influence on the policies of the Indian Communist Party.  In
 1942, the Indian party was tardily brought to adopt the new line
 regarding World War II as the result of strong pressure from the British
 Communist Party.  The Indian Party had continued to condemn the war
 long after world Communism had dubbed it a "people's war."  Intervention
 from the British Communists appears again to have been a decisive factor
 in the Indian Communists' shift to a united front policy in 1951, which
 is probably attributable to a letter received by the Indians from
 R. Palme Dutt in the fall of the preceding year.
 Numerous active Communists from abroad have visited India in
 recent years.  Among these are:  Pablo Neruda, the Chilean poet, in
 October 1950; D.N. Pritt, a British lawyer, in the autumn of 1950;
 Mrs. Jessie Street, in July 1950; Malcolm Nixon, the Secretary of the
 WFDY, in May 1952; and M. Joliot-Curie.

 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries-of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out;.and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN IRAN:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 The major Communist objective in Iran appears to be to get control
 of the Iranian Government by constitutional means.  Communism is repre.
 sented organizationally in Iran by the Tudeh (Masses) Party, which emerged
 into public life in 1943 as a coalition of Iranian Liberals and Communists.
 The Tudeh Party was declared illegal in February 1949 but has been main..
 tained since then clandestinely and has operated overtly through a variety
 of front organizations, of which the "Peace Partisans" and "The Society
 to Combat Imperialism" are the most prominent.
 In moving toward its primary objective of getting control of the
 government through constitutional means, the Tudeh Party appears to have
 the following concurrent high priority intermediate goals:  (1) legaliza-
 tion of the Tudeh Party; (2) replacement of Mosadeq as Prime Minister;
 (3) control of the key Ministries of Defense, Interior, and Justice;
 (4) control of the M%jlis (lower house of Parliament), if necessary by
 a coalition group; (5) neutralization or elimination of the Shah;
 (6) neutralization or elimination of the traditional governing groups;
 (7) transfer of the management of factories and services to union
 organizations; (S) confiscation of large landholdings for distribution
 to peasants, thereby neutralizing or eliminating large landlords;
 (9) neutralization or conversion of intellectuals ; (10) elimination of
 all Western political influence; especially that of the US;
 (11) neutralization of UN influence; and (12) establishment of closer
 cooperation, especially in the economic field, with the Soviet Union.
 These objectives are set primarily to increase the capability of
 the Tudeh Party to exercise political power both through the ballot and
 the mechanisms of mass demonstrations, riots, and intimidation, employed
 to undermine public confidence in the authorities.  Although the elimina-
 tion of all Western, especially US influence, in Iran would fulfill a
 Soviet foreign policy requirement, the alleged threat to Iran arising
 from that source provides the Tudeh Party currently with one of its most
 valuable tools in seeking non-Communist cooperation.
 The current top priority short-term Tudeh goal appears to be to
 utilize its Communist-educated, disciplined, devoted, and effective
 organization to expand its influence in non-Communist circles.  The
 degree of concentration on other objectives is opportunistic.   For
 instance, the government's  decree increasing the peasants' share of
 agricultural production was utilized by the Tudeh Party to arouse support
 for its goal of confiscation of large landholdings; similarly, the
 ineptitude and ineffectiveness of the Ministry of Labor in protecting
 workers has been repeatedly used by the Tudeh Party to destroy non-Tudeh

 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 unions and strengthen its own.  Tudeh leadership has shown great
 flexibility and alertness in exploiting opportunities for advancing
 its objectives as they arise.
 There are no significant incompatabilities among these
 short-term Communist objectives, which are designed to destroy the
 capacity of the present governing groups to prevent ultimate Communist
 control of the entire bureaucracy and the army.  Incompatabilities
 are likely to become apparent only after these short-term objectives
 have been achieved and the ultimate Tudeh objectives are exposeds
 (1) the complete Sovietization of Iran, including (a) neutraliza-
 tion of the middle class, (b) establishment of a single political
 party, (c) imposition of police rule, and (d) replacement of the
 current curriculum in schools, colleges, etc., by the curriculum used
 in the USSR; and (2) transformation of Iran into a Soviet Satellite
 state.
 If the Tudeh believes it can muster an overwhelming prepon-
 derance of force, it might rapidly shift its strategy of achieving
 control through constitutional means to achieving it through a coup
 d'etat.  Failure of such an attempt would result in the destruction
 of the organization and. the indefinite postponement of success by
 legal means.  We have no evidence to indicate that this shift in
 tactics is likely in the immediate future, although serious dis-
 affection in the armed forces or simultaneous tribal and urban dis-
 turbances throughout the country could present an opportunity.  The
 obstacles to movement which winter snows and spring floods present
 in the mountainous tribal areas make disturbances there unlikely in
 any case before May.
 II.  TACT ICS
 The underlying strategic policy of the Tudeh Party is threefold:
 (1) it is designed to build up a direct following among all social
 groups; (2) it attempts to enter working arrangements with or gain
 covert control of non-Communist political groups; and (3) it attempts
 to weaken by subversion and intimidation non-Communist political and
 social groups.  Since the Tudeh Party is illegal, its efforts to
 build up a hard-core following are largely covert, although its
 activities through front organizations and its-newspapers are, in
 effect, overt.  The Tudeh Party carries on its propaganda wherever
 there is an opportunity and in the manner best suited to the recep-
 tive capacity of the target.  Emphasis is placed upon factors and
 grievances which affect the immediate personal lives of the particu-
 lar audience and therefore varies in accordance with their background,
 prejudices, and aspirations.

 -3-
 The bulk of the membership appears to be in urban centers,
 where the industrial and educational life of the country and
 governmental machinery are concentrated and where ease of communi-
 cation and association facilitate organization.  The Tudeh Party
 is apparently also attempting through sports clubs to establish
 a body of young men highly trained in the technique of street fight-
 ing to supplement the unorganized bands of thugs who have partici-
 pated prominently in past Tudeh demonstrations. There is no evidence
 that an effective pare-military organization as yet exists.
 Given the economic and social conditions in Iran'since 1945,
 it is probable that the Tudeh Party would have made more progress
 in the postwar period if non-Communist National Front groups had
 not emerged with objectives which in many respects duplicated those
 of the Tudeh Party.  Tudeh propaganda promises a higher standard of
 living for 90 percent of the Iranian population, "social justice,"
 "national independence," and cultural autonomy.  All of these objec-
 tives have very broad popular appeal in Iran.  Furthermore, the
 experiences of Iranian students abroad, as well as both Western and
 Soviet propaganda during and since World War II, encouraged Iranians,
 especially in urban centers, to expect and demand improvements in
 their economic and social conditions, but did not make clear alter-
 native methods for achieving these.
 Primarily through its newspapers and pamphlets and through
 discussion at cell meetings, the Tudeh Party, aided by radio propa-
 ganda from the USSR, has kept up a continuous barrage of criticism
 designed to destroy public confidence in the ability and good in-
 tentions of the governing groups in Iran.  The members of the party
 are engaged actively in collecting damaging information.' There is
 a sufficient basis of truth in the Tudeh accusations of official
 injustice, disloyalty, and incompetence to provide confidence among
 hearers in the exaggerations and untruths disseminated.  Furthermore,
 by claiming credit for improvements in the working conditions of
 various groups of laborers, and by providing financial aid for Tudeh
 demonstrators injured or under arrest, the party has established
 sufficiently convincing evidence of its claims that it constitutes
 the only effective defense against "exploitation."  In a country
 where official promises have remained traditionally unfulfilled,
 these small positive Tudeh actions have been effective, especially
 in urban areas.
 Tudeh activity in Iran has been greatly aided since.March 1951
 by the controversy over oil nationalization, which led to a concentra-
 tion of resentment against the UK.  Under the guise of patriotic
 support for the national struggle to free Iran from alleged British
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION

 -4-
 control, the Tudeh has been able to gain experience in the use of
 mass demonstration and has provided some of its members with practical
 experience in street fighting and the use of slogans.
 The party has also been aided by the activities of ultra-conser-
 vative Moslem leaders, such as the Majlis President, Mullah Kashani,
 whose agitation for the return to Islamic principles arouses misgiv-
 ings in the Assyrian, Armenian, and Jewish minority groups.  Further-
 more, sections of these minority groups were among the most active
 collaborators with Soviet officials during the Allied occupation of
 Iran.  Their inability to emigrate and their fear of Soviet perse-
 cution in the event of another Soviet invasion of Iran encourage
 especially the younger people among them to join in Tudeh activities
 in the hope of ultimate personal gain or safety.  The Tudeh Party
 has also been aided by the revolutionary policies and propaganda of
 the National Front group which, though less extreme, has seriously
 weakened the power of the traditional governing groups in Iran.
 Conditions governing foreign trade have also aided the Tudeh
 Party.  The limited and.costly transportation system in Iran makes
 exporters in the northern regions particularly vulnerable to attractive
 commercial offers from the Soviet Union.  The proximity of those areas
 to the USSR and the fear of another Soviet invasion also incline
 merchants in the north to cooperate with the Soviet Trade Delegation
 and, indirectly, the Tudeh Party.
 The major propaganda line which the Tudeh Party employs  to
 build up local support is that the present governing groups are.un-
 willing and unable to establish and carry out policies which will
 improve the lot of the Iranian masses.  It therefore argues that
 only through the united action of the people under the guidance of
 the party can a program of reform be executed which will provide the
 people with necessities and assure them social justice, health,
 education, and-opportunity for self-advancement.
 In moving toward its major current objective of replacing the
 government, the party utilizes its front organizations, such as the
 Peace Partisans, to discredit the West, especially the US, in the
 hope of forcing the government to weaken its position by rejecting
 aid from the US.  It uses its trade unions to discredit the Ministry
 of Labor and to frustrate by strikes and repeated complaints official
 attempts to maintain some degree of stability in industrial enterprises.
 In the same way, the great variety of front organizations which
 relate to practically every phase of activity in Iran are used to
 hamper whatever steps the government may take toward orderly reform
 and to spread and increase popular distrust and dissatisfaction with
 officials and government organizations.

 New members of the Tudeh Party are recruited by personal
 solicitation of old members after a thorough period of investigation.
 The new recruit's interest is usually based upon some personal
 grievance which Tudeh promises to remove.  The recruit's active
 interest is maintained by a sense of purpose, of comradeship, of
 membership in a secret, exclusive organization, and of conviction
 that in the end he will be on top and his enemies destroyed. any'

 Before the Tudeh Party was declared illegal, the composition
 of its directing committee was well known.  It was composed of
 Iranians with various degrees of Soviet training.  They are now
 dispersed, some in Europe, some in the USSR, but is. is probable that
 some are in hiding in Iran and that they continue to direct policies
 there.  The extent of direction from Soviet or satellite sources is
 not known, but it is probably significant.  Control or influence in
 non-Communist organizations (excluding fronts) is achieved by infil-
 tration or bribery.
 The characteristic Iranian emphasis on individualism  promotes
 disunity in organizations and so facilitates the acquisition. of key
 posts by any determined minority acting as a unit.  As a matter of
 policy, the Tudeh Party appears to prefer that the most prominent
 posts be filled by non-Communists, so long as the voting power and
 ideological direction remain in Tudeh hands.
 The Tudeh Party has been greatly handicapped in its efforts
 to obtain control by constitutional means by the fact that it is
 illegal and that the elections have never been free.  It therefore
 ,resorted in the 1952 elections to the following devices:  (1) support-
 ing candidates proposed by front organizations; (2) bribing or making
 deals with candidates supported by either Mosadeq or Kashani.  Support
 for front candidates was not only urged by Tudeh newspapers, but
 was promoted by instructions delivered in Tudeh cell meetings.  In
 order to obtain Majlis representation, the Tudeh is now expressing
 its willingness to join with any political group.  So far, however,
 the disadvantages to non-Communists of. such association appear to
 have prevented the success of this tactic.  It is possible, should
 the National Front group leaders come into conflict over, say, the
 succession to Mosadeq, that some leader might accept the collabora-
 tion of the Tudeh Party.  But at the present time the prospects are
 that any resort to such collaboration would unite the remaining non-
 Communist opposition and assure them the victory.

 III.  CAPABILITIES
 In the absence of muoh more serious disaffection in the army,
 simultaneous uprisings by various elements throughout the country, or
 some unexpected Soviet action, it is not believed that the Tudeh
 Party has the ability to get control of the Iranian Government by force.
 The ability of the Tudeh Party to achieve its major current objective
 of gaining control through legal methods will be in inverse pro-
 portion to the effectiveness of the.present government in relieving
 traditional economic and social pressures on the bulk of the popula-
 tion and meeting the aspirations of the younger educated groups who
 provide an important element of National Front 'support.  Tudeh
 leaders at present probably feel that they have no'alternative than
 to bide their time while consolidating their strength, knowing that
 .any non-Communist government will be forced by continued financial
 and political difficulties to adopt strong regulatory measures which
 will increase strife between the "haves" and the  "have nots."  If
 the National Front government is unable to meet the mounting pressures,
 it is probable that Tudeh will receive added strength and, will obtain
 effective representation in the Majiis through elections and pressure
 on deputies.
 The ability of the Tudeh Party to.exploit opportunities favor-
 able to its current goal of gaining control of the Iranian Government
 stems primarily from four factors:  (1) it is the only united and
 disciplined political party; (2) it has developed the techniques of
 the controlled use of mass demonstrations, strikes, riots, and inti-
 midation for political purposes; (3) its policy of opposition to or
 evasion of established authority strikes a sympathetic chord with
 most Iranians who are acquainted from personal experience with social,
 political, and economic injustices; and (4) the centralization in
 Tehran of control over governmental machinery provides Tudeh with a
 compact, crucial target.  Because of these factors the Tudeh Party
 is likely to increase in power, unless it represents a clear political
 threat to a non-Communist government which would then try to destroy
 it.  At the present time, the existence of an active Tudeh Party is
 politically advantageous to Mosadeq in conducting both his internal
 and foreign policies.
 Under those circumstances, it is probable that the Tudeh Party
 will be permitted to continue to operate through -front organizations.
 It will attempt to further Soviet policy by discrediting and, if
 possible, forcing the rejection of US aid to Iran.  The party may be
 expected to pursue its efforts to hamper the government's attempts at
 reform by complaining that actions taken are too slow or too limited
 and by publicizing instances of dishonesty or incompetence.  It will
 also persist in using Tudeh unions to disrupt industrial and trans-
 portation operations.

 The disunity of the non-Communist forces in Iran and their
 internal jealousies and conflicts will facilitate the expansion of
 Tudeh power and influence, despite the relatively small membership
 in the Tudeh Party.  However, with patience and persistence, a non-
 Communist government can, with outside assistance, gradually improve
 the conditions which now provide the Tudeh Party with its major
 sources of support.  Barring some unexpected development such as a
 political disintegration of the National Front, a serious crop failure,
 an unfavorable export market, or an abrupt change in Soviet tactics,
 the probability is that Tudeh strength in Iran will not increase
 proportionately more than non-Communist strength through 1953.

 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 The current estimate of card-carrying members of the Communist
 Tudeh Party in Iran is from 20,000 to 35,000, with an estimated hard-
 core of 1,000.  The membership may be roughly estimated at 8,000 in
 Tehran, 5,000 in the Azerbaijan area, 4,000 in the Caspian region,
 1,000 in Isfahan, and 3,000 in the-Abadan area.  The hard-core member-
 ship derives principally from industrial and transport workers,, students,
 teachers, professional men, and government employees.  Members of
 organizations controlled by the Communists may be estimated at from
 60,000 to 80,000; those in non-Communist organizations which have been
 infiltrated by the Tudeh Party,160,000; and the total controlled or
 strongly influenced by the Tudeh Party at from 170,000 to a maximum
 of 400,000, or from  1  to 2.3 percent of the estimated population.
 The party's members and followers may be estimated in the major cities
 at 30,000 in Tehran, 20,000 in Azerbaijan, 10,000 in the Caspian
 region, 4,000 in Isfahan, and 12,000 in the Abadan area.
 The bulk of the party members and sympathizers come from among
 skilled and unskilled workers, peasants, teachers, students, minor
 government employees, professional men, Kurds and religious minorities
 (Assyrians, Armenians, and Jews)._ The individuals are of all ages,
 with an estimated average membership in the party of three to seven
 years.  Possibly 4,000 members-of the party have been active for
 over five years, with the "hard-core" members, who are in the 25 to
 i5 year age group, active for an estimated period of five to seven
 years.  The quality of the "hard-core" leadership is believed to
 range from average to good.  No information is available regarding
 the annual turnover of membership.
 The number of Tudeh sympathizers is extremely variable, depend-
 ing upon specific issues raised and concurrent circumstances at a
 given time.  This fact, combined with the covert character of most
 Tudeh activities, makes estimates of Tudeh membership and following
 'open to question.  Although the general trend has been toward in-
 creased membership, the party's following appears to have dropped
 sharply following the re-conquest of Azerbaijan in December 1946,
 and the banning of the Tudeh Party in February 1949.  On both of
 these occasions, the party tightened up its membership requirements,
 and the stricter policy also contributed to the drop in adherents.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 Rigged elections, as well as the illegal status of the Tudeh
 Party, make estimates of electoral strength of doubtful reliability.
 C

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 The Tehran elections, alone, provide a reasonable basis for estimates.
 There the Tudeh and supporter vote totalled 28,841, or roughly one-
 quarter of the over-all vote.  All successful candidates supported
 the National Front government. Of the 80 nationally elected repre-
 sentatives, 6 from Azerbaijan (4 from Tabriz) are alleged. to have
 Communist connections.  It is probable that  some urban centers, such
 as Isfahan, the proportion of votes from Tudeh members and sympathizers
 was also roughly one-quarter. Current major Tudeh objectives and
 tactics are (1) to increase the party following to support its own
 candidates if the ban is lifted, otherwise to support "front" candi-
 dates or non-Communists who are amenable to bribery; (2) to plug
 simultaneously for free elections.
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 The current Tudeh policy appears to be to refrain from armed
 insurrection, but to fight back vigorously if attacked by other
 groups or the police.  In recent cases of violent demonstrations, the
 estimated numbers of Tudeh followers involved ranges from 100 to
 5,000.  The number which could be brought out now for violent demon-
 strations under the most favorable conditions is estimated at a
 minimum of 35,000, a maximum of 200,000.  The maximum number of party
 members capable of leading violent demonstrations.in key places
 probably does not exceed 500.  On the basis of speculation, the party
 is probably capable of directing violent demonstrations in Tehran,
 Tabriz, the Caspian area, Isfahan,.and the Abadan area.  Quality of
 leadership is probably average to good, and equipment is believed to
 include small.arms and home-made bombs as well as knives, clubs, etc.
 Tudeh sources claimed that 120,000 participated in the 1945
 attempt to set up separate Kurdish and Azerbaijan governments under
 the protection of the Soviet Army; however, the actual force was
 probably not more than 50,000.  There have been no reports that
 effective Tudeh para-military organizations exist.  The party has
 ?relied upon groups of miscellaneous thugs in violent demonstrations.
 It is believed to be training young men for street. fighting, but no
 organized units are known to exist as yet.  The maximum force avail-
 able throughout Iran now for armed insurrection is estimated at
 200,000, but the number would depend on the issue involved and other
 circumstances.  The quality of leadership would probably be good.
 The supply of available weapons and ammunition is probably inadequate
 now to equip potential manpower.
 No current plans or proposals for creating or activating a
 military resistance organization in case of war are known.  In case
 of an East-West war, it is probable that Iran would lose its indepen-

 dence in a matter of days.  Under Soviet occupation or domination,
 practically all able-bodied men and, to a lesser extent, women, would
 probably ultimately be mobilized to support the USSR in its resistance
 to the West.  This number can be roughly estimated at a maximum of
 1,000,000.  Leadership, arms, and equipment would have to be provided
 by the USSR.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 The Tudeh Party and its labor front, the Central United Council
 of Trade Unions (CUCTU), were declared illegal in February 1919.  Since
 then they have been operating largely clandestinely, but also overtly
 under the cloak of marW front organizations.  Tudeh activities are
 hampered by (1) the governmentia imposition of martial law in the
 Tehran and Abadan areas; (2) a new press law which provides means of
 suppressing Tudeh publications; (3) new decrees forbidding the carrying
 of weapons and the holding of meetings without police permission; and
 (1) failure to weaken significantly the repressive potential of the
 police and-army.  The government has the means to suppress Tudeh and
 its front organizations effectively, but is unlikely to do so as long
 as (1) the existence of the Tudeh threat is politically advantageous
 in carrying out internal and foreign policies and (2) the Tudeh is
 regarded as presenting no clear and crucial threat to the maintenance
 of power by a non-Communist government.
 The Communist Party, however, has exhibited impressive ability
 to circumvent repression in Iran.  This record has been achieved
 largely as the result of (1) a skillful, organizational set-up whereby
 even its own members know only a few within the organization; (2)
 skillful direction of overt activities on the part of Communist groups;
 (3) skillful use of front organizations; (1) the parallel revolutionary
 and anti-Western propaganda and activities of the National Front (now
 in control of the government); (5) the lack of concerted effort by the
 government to repress Communist activities; (6) bribery of government
 officials; and (7) infiltration among officials within the Ministry
 of justice and'prisons.  Although the government has declared martial
 law in Tehran and Abadan-Khorramshar  (oil industry area), Communist
 organizational activity continues uninterrupted.  Repressive action by
 the government, such as imposition of martial law, does have positive
 results, particularly in reducing the occurrence of demonstrations.
 In the field of press publication, however, repressive action does
 not appear to be very effective.  Government efforts to combat
 Communist organization of labor usually takes the ineffective form
 of trying to persuade the workers to join non-Communist organizations
 which are led by known government "stooges" or by men who are not
 trusted by the workers.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 The National Front government is currently encouraging non-
 Communist groups, such as the Pan-Iranists, SOMKA, and the Workers'
 Party, to clash in street fights with Communist-led demonstrators,
 and the police in each clash tend to act as a shield for these non-
 Communist groups.  It should be kept in mind also that the existence
 of a genuine Communist "menace" in Iran is a useful factor in any
 government's efforts to obtain foreign economic aid and therefore it
 is probable that Prime Minister Mosadeq is not sincerely desirous of
 eliminating Communist activity in Iran.  Tudeh front organizations,
 of which the most prominent are the Peace Partisans, the Society to
 Combat Imperialism, the Tudeh Youth Organization, and the Tudeh
 Women's Organization, are unhampered in their organizations.  Their
 activities are controlled by the provisions of martial law and their
 utility to the Tudeh is primarily through the appearance of their
 members at mass demonstrations.  Their propaganda parrots the lines
 set by Moscow.
 The size of the Tudeh "underground" organization in Iran is
 estimated to be at a minimum 20,000, maximum 35,000, with concentra-
 tion in Tehran, Isfahan, Azerbaijan, the Caspian region, and the
 Abadan area.  The efficiency appears to be considerable in view of
 the success with which security is maintained.  Communications appear
 to offer no difficulties.
 V.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 The number of Communists in key industries in Iran is estimated
 to vary from 5 to 25 percent of the total labor force in such industries.
 There are an estimated 6,000 in the following categories; railway
 workers, 1,000 -- many in key operational positions; communications
 unknown, but believed to be significant; arms plants and arsenals, 200
 in the Tehran area; oil workers, 3,000 to 5,000; bus and trick drivers,
 1,000 in a strong Tudeh unit.
 The membership in the Tudeh Central United Council of Trade
 Unions is estimated at 6,000, although the clandestine nature of this
 operation raises some doubt of the estimate.  The number of active,
 dues-paying members of Com anist unions at least equals and probably
 exceeds the total number of workers belonging to non-Communist trade
 unions.  However, only 1/10 of the total industrial workers, and only
 1/30 of the total workers in professional services and distribution
 trades are organized.  Communist influence is exerted through factory
 councils set up under the sponsorship of the Ministry of Labor.  In
 many cases Tudeh members are in control.  The extent of their influence
 is indicated by the fact that the government postponed the 1952 annual
 congress for elections of the workers.' representatives on the High
 Labor Council for fear of possible Tudeh control.  Tudeh unions do
 not have decisive control of the labor force in any key industry.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 The strongest Tudeh unions are among railway workers, especially
 at the hub of traffic, Tehran.  The railway is the principal distri-
 buting agency for imports and exports and for the movement of internal
 fuel supplies to sub-stations.  Another strong union is that of bus
 and truck drivers.    Provincial areas are entirely dependent upon these
 services for merchandise and passenger traffic.  In Tehran, especially,
 Tudeh unions among the workers at the silo where the city's grain
 supply is stored, and among the bakers who prepare the city's daily
 bread supply, present a potential threat.
 The affiliations of these unions are not in all cases confirmed,
 but all are believed to be associated with the Communist-dominated ?RFTU.
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL,  CULTURAL
 AND   0    ION   ORGANIZATIONS
 The principal Tudeh youth organizations are the Tudeh Youth
 Organization and the Iranian Democratic Youth Club, which serves as
 the Youth Organizations front.    The estimated membership is 4,000 to
 6,000, mostly in Tehran.     There are no other youth organizations as
 such in Iran, although youths do have an opportunity to engage in
 organized activities in the schools and colleges and in political
 activity through the following National Front associated organizations:
 (1) the Pan-Iranists, (2) SOMKA (National Socialists), and (3) the
 Workers' Party.  The Tudeh Youth Organization is affiliated with the
 World Federation of Democratic Youth and appears to be well led.  It
 often works through the Democratic Youth Club to avoid arrest and its
 members have, along with the Communist-front Society to Combat Imperial-
 ism, been in the forefront of Tudeh demonstrations.  The Tudeh Youth
 Organization is considered to be a school for training young members
 to become members of the Tudeh Party itself.  The party enjoins TYO
 members to "struggle for peace" and strengthen their contacts with
 the masses.  Membership is open to youths 12-23 years of age.  There-
 fore, the Tudeh Youth Organization could potentially include the bulk
 of students from the fifth grade up to and including college levels.
 Unless the non-Communist government can meet adequately the aspirations
 of young Iranians for employment and opportunities, an increase of
 members in the Tudeh Youth Organization is probable.
 B.  Students
 The principal Tudeh organizations among students are: (1) Iranian
 Students' Organization, (2) Students' Organization of Tehran University,
 (3) Society of tewish Students of Tehran University, (4) Students
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Organization of Tabriz University, (5) Tudeh Association of Higher
 Normal School Graduates, (6) Tudeh Association of Primary Normal School
 Graduates, (7) General Council of the Faculty of Science Students'
 Organization, and (8) Karaj Faculty Tudeh Organization.. The estimated
 strength in various centers is 2,000 in Tehran, 500 in Tabriz, and
 100 in Shiraz.  In demonstrations at Tehran University, Communists
 have been able to get support from as much as 1/3 of the student body.
 In early 1952, it was estimated that 30 percent of the secondary
 school teachers were affiliated with Tudeh.  There are no comparable
 organizations in the universities and these are believed to be affiliated
 with the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International
 Union of Students.  They also have contacts with the Iranian Students
 Organization In Paris.
 The leadership appears to be good.  The major current objectives
 are to (1) lead strikes at the universities; (2) campaign for a reduc-
 tion in tuition fees, entrance requirements, and graduation or passing
 marks; (3) campaign for various popular issues affecting the welfare
 of students; and (4).attempt to organize a conference of students of
 the Near and Middle East.  At Tehran. University, expansion and action
 capabilities appear to be favorable, though probably less so than six
 months ago, since the government is beginning to exhibit more interest
 in controlling demonstrations, weeding out Tudeh students and professors
 and encouraging aggressive non-Communist organizations to counteract
 Tudeh demonstrations.
 Principal Tudeh organizations among women are the Iranian
 Women's Organization and the Society for the Protection of.Children.
 Membership figures are unavailable.  These groups are associated with
 the Women's International Democratic Federation and the International
 Preparatory Commission for the Protection of Children.  These groups
 agitate for women's rights; spread Communist ideology among women,
 girls and children; and exploit the humanitarian appeals inherent in
 any child-welfare program.  The Iranian Women's Organization is unlikely
 to play a large role except under a Communist government, but the Pro-
 tection of Children program appears to have favorable prospects.
 D.  Racial, Religious,. Nationality Minorities
 The organizations which Tudeh has established to work among
 minorities are principally the followings
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATICK
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 (1)  Armenian
 (a) Progressive (youth organization)
 (b) Armenian Cultural Tudeh Organization
 (a) Church Women's Union
 (d) Armenian Communist Party
 (2)  Azerbaijani
 (a) Azerbaijan Democrat Party
 (b) The Azerbaijan Society
 (3)  Kurds
 (a) Kurdish Democrat Party
 (4)  Jews
 (a) Society of Jewish Students of Tehran University.
 Membership in the Armenian groups is estimated at 80 to 200,
 princiaplly in Tehran; in the Azerbaijani groups at 20,000, principally.
 in Azerbaijan; in the Kurdish group at 4,000, principally in Azerbaijan.
 Membership of the Jewish group is unknown, but small.  The Armenian
 group is opposed by the majority of Armenians, but appears to have con-
 siderable potential for terrorist activities.  There is no organized
 opposition to the other groups except from the government.  The leaders
 of these groups are not ]mown, nor their international affiliations,
 if any.
 The objectives of these groups appear to be:
 (1) Armenian:  to organize the entire Armenian Community
 to participate actively in Tudeh plans.
 (2) Azerbaijani:.(a) The Azerbaijan Society to act as a front
 in Tehran for the Democrat Party, (b) the latter to carry
 out subversive activities comparable to those being under-
 taken by Tudeh outside of Azerbaijan.  Principal current
 theme is cultural and political autonomy for Azerbaijan.
 (3) Kurds:  to conduct similar subversive activities
 in north-western Azerbaijan appealing for Kurdish
 cultural and political autonomy.
 (4) Jewish:  Unknown.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 - 15'-
 Capabilities for expansion and action among all of these groups
 appear to be good.  The grievances toward the central government among
 the Azerbaijanis and Kurds are such that the presence in those areas
 of strong military establishments is probably the only deterrent to a
 general uprising today.
 E.  Sports Groups
 The Tudeh sports organizations are the Tudeh Mountaineers League,'
 the Tudeh Wrestlers League, the Tudeh Swimmers League, and the.Tudeh
 Basketball Players Association.  The membership is probably small and
 unimportant from the point of view of sports, but significant in pro-
 viding training for street fighters and expanding contacts.  In view
 of the increasing general interest in sports in Iran, the capabilities
 of these groups for expansion are good.
 F.  Cultural Groups
 The principal Tudeh organizations are the Artists League, the
 Armenian Cultural Tudeh Organization, and the Society for Combatting
 Illiteracy.  There are no competing organizations.  The illiteracy
 program is the most effective since it reaches people. unaffected by
 the regular school system through lack of opportunity or means to
 attend.  The objective in organizing these groups is probably to
 provide additional targets for propaganda, but the illiteracy program
 has, in addition, the purpose of teaching Tudeh members or potential
 recruits to read and write so they can understand written orders and
 submit written reports and begin to read Communist literature.  The
 capabilities of the Artists League appear limited, but those of the
 Armenian group are probably favorable among younger Armenians, and
 those of the Illiteracy Society are likely to be very favorable and
 an increasingly effective Tudeh tactic.
 C.  'Professional Groups
 The principal Tudeh organizations among professionals are
 (1) The Iranian Society of Democratic Lawyers, (2) The Judicial Society
 of Iran, (3) Union of Teacher Training College Graduates (4) Tudeh
 Medical Assistants Union, (5) Tudeh Union of Government Employees,
 and (6) National Association of Democratic Journalists.  The member-
 ship is unknown but probably small.  There are no effective non-Communist
 organizations in these fields, although the Communist membership is
 probably numerically a small proportion of the total employment.  The
 jurists group is probably well-led and is affiliated with the Inter-
 national Association of Democratic Jurists (IADJ).
 Tudeh objectives  through the legal groups appear to be to
 assure support for the Communist line regarding (1) international law,
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4

 -16-
 (2) the role of the UN in establishing peace, and (3) the "correct"
 interpretation of Iranian laws and the constitution.  The teachers,
 organization is designed to spread the party line and add to the
 embarrassments of the government; that of the government employees,
 to facilitate Tudeh infiltration and eventual take-over; and that
 in the press, to enlist sympathetic Tudeh treatment in the press
 and support Tudeh's opposition to any restrictive official actions
 or legislation.  The capabilities for expansion and action in all
 of these fields appear to be good.
 H.  "Peace" and Other Organizations Supporting Pro-Soviet, Pro-Satellite
 and Anti-Western Programs
 The principal "peace" and anti-Western Tudeh front organizations
 are-(1) The Iranian Association for Peace, which has 10,000 to 15,000
 dues-paying members concentrated in Tehran and Tabriz, although 900,000
 signatures have been claimed by the organization;  (2) The Free Iran
 Society, membership unknown, but concentrated in Tehran;  (3) The
 Iran--Soviet Cultural Relations Society, with an estimated membership
 of 500, also concentrated in Tehran; and (4) The National Society for
 Combatting Imperialism in Iran with an estimated membership of 15,000,
 concentrated in Tehran, Abadan, Khorramshar,  Isfahan, and Resht.
 The "Peace" group has no effective opposition and has been
 very successful in attracting support from all classes.  It is believed
 to provide the headquarters for overt Tudeh activities.  The Free Iran
 Society is actively opposed by the Tehran Chamber of Commerce and the
 Cultural Society by the Iran-America Relations Society, although there
 is some overlapping of membership.  The anti-imperialist group is
 effectively opposed only by National Front groups.  The direction of
 the associations appears to be generally very good and the Peace
 Partisans and cultural groups are affiliated with the international
 Communist fronts, the former with the International Partisans of Peace
 Movement, and the latter with the Soviet VOKS organization.
 The current objectives of these Communist organizations appear
 to be as follows:  for the Peace Partisans, to urge all Tudeh members
 to join the front and to recruit membership from all classes, especially
 from those who would not join Tudeh or other more obviously Communist-
 controlled groups; for the Free Iran Society, to band together
 businessmen and small industrialists and to obtain an embargo against
 foreign, especially US, imports; for the Cultural Society, to serve
 as a propaganda tool for VOKS, directed primarily toward younger
 Iranian intellectuals; for the anti-Imperialist group, to capitalize
 on the oil dispute between the UK and Iran and on the xenophobic
 atmosphere prevailing in the country to destroy Western influence.
 This organization has been used as the principal agency for conducting
 mass demonstrations,
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 The capabilities for expansion and action of these organizations
 appear to be as follows:  the Peace Partisans apparently have reached
 the peak of their ability to expand rapidly.  However, a war scare
 would enhance the capability greatly.  Aggressive action against its
 headquarters and demonstrations by groups adhering to the National
 Front, such as Pan-Iranists and SOMKA, aided by the police, has tended
 to reduce the field of activity.  For the Free Iran Society, pros-
 pects appear to be limited because imports are being reduced by
 exchange shortages.  For the Cultural Society, prospects are faitly
 good since the fact that it is ostensibly an Iranian Society permits
 the USSR to circumvent the Iranian Government's decree forbidding
 activity by foreign information centers outside Tehran.  For the anti
 Imperialists, the prospects will vary with the intensity of the
 UK-Iran oil controversy.  The government has recently severely limited
 the freedom of this group to hold demonstrations.
 No adequate information is available to provide the basis for
 a reliable estimate of the degree of Tudeh infiltration of non-Communist
 organizations.
 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 Less than 200 individuals participate in top policy-making
 bodies in Iran.  None is known to be Communist and perhaps not more
 than six to ten can be regarded as potentially sympathetic to Communism.
 However, any estimates must be treated with reserve as the willingness
 of non-Communists to cooperate with Communists would depend upon the
 specific issue and concurrent circumstances.  Furthermore, bribery
 and pressure may lead to cooperation on either side.  The highest
 estimates of Tudeh infiltration in the armed services are 1500 in the
 army, 600 air force, 110 gendarmerie, and none navy.  Sympathizers'
 may number 5,000 or more, depending upon the specific issue involved
 and circumstances.  The potentialities of infiltration do not differ
 greatly from those among Iranians outside the armed forces.  The
 extent of Tudeh influence in top levels is believed to be negligible.
 at the present time.
 The National Police Force consists of approximately 20,000 men.
 The force is undoubtedly penetrated by Communists but the percentage
 is probably not very high as the police are notoriously susceptible,
 in any event, to bribery.  The little information available concerning
 influence at the top indicates that penetration has not been accomplished.
 There is no reliable information on Tudeh penetration in the
 administrations  of nationalized industries, but there may be 60.to

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 100 Communists among them, with sympathizers numbering perhaps 300,
 depending upon the specific issue.  Their influence is of varying
 significance, but not yet controlling in. any instance.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 It is estimated that the number of Communists and sympathizers
 actively engaged in trying to mold public opinion numbers from 20,000
 to 35,000, with a potential audience of 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 depend-
 ing upon the issue raised.  The number of persons strongly influenced
 by the Communists regardless of the issue is estimated at a minimum
 of 170,000 and a maximum of 400,000.  The influence on ostensibly
 non-Communist efforts to mold public opinion cannot be estimated with
 any precision as most newspapers and publications at times espouse
 causes encouraged by the Communists and accept material for publication
 from all sources.
 IX.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 Although there is undoubtedly some Communist infiltration of
 these groups, adequate information is not available to make an estimate.
 Furthermore, the effectiveness of Tudeh influence would depend upon
 the specific issue involved and concurrent circumstances.  Almost
 identical Tudeh and National Front attitudes on some issues make it
 virtually impossible to determine what influence is Tudeh and what is
 non-Tudeh.  Under such circumstances, Tudeh potential is high but its
 influence appears at the present time to be slight.
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 The principal current propaganda media in Iran are newspapers
 and publications and instruction in Tudeh cells, effectively supple-
 mented by numerous broadcasts from Soviet radio stations in Persian,
 Turki (Azerbaijani), and Kurdish.  Of the 27 Tudeh publications now
 appearing, the principal ones are Besuye   andeh, a Tehran daily
 morning paper with an estimated circulation of 6,000 to 8,000; Shahbaz,
 a daily evening Tehran paper with an estimated circulation of 3,;
 Farhan ian, a weekly publication with an estimated circulation of
 7,; and Dehqanan Iran, a weekly publication with an estimated
 circulation of 2,000.  These are.all published in Tehran by the Haghsh
 Jehan press, which is supplied by TASS via the Soviet Embassy with
 world-wide news coverage, and probably also with newsprint.  The
 quality of the press appears to be adequate despite mobster raids by
 partisans of the National Front.  It is probable that the presses
 which print the clandestine Tudeh papers and publications are located
 in the provincial centers and in Tehran, perhaps in some satellite
 Legation.
 SECRET - SECURITY-INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 So far as is known neither the Soviet nor satellite missions
 publish overt propaganda, although they all assist in the importation
 of publications from abroad in Russian, Persian, and Turki.  Further-
 more, Soviet newspapers such as Pravda, and a great variety of cheap
 Soviet books are available in quantity in the bookshops and newsstands
 of Tehran and provincial cities.  No information is available on the
 financial assets of importers.
 Internal broadcasting facilities in Iran are controlled by.the
 government and do not appear to be either controlled or influenced at
 the present time by Communists.  It was reported In 1952 that there
 was a clandestine station in Tehran making infrequent broadcasts.  The
 Communist radio programs, which are believed to have a significant
 listening public, come from the USSR.  Radio Moscow broadcasts half-
 hour programs in Persian four times daily; Radio Baku gives programs
 in Persian three times daily; Radio Tashkent beams half-hour programs
 in Persian twice daily; and Radio Democrat (Azerbaijan) has programs
 seven hours a week in each language -- Persian, Turki, and Kurdish.
 It is the last station which is most vicious in its propaganda and
 which has probably the most effective impact on Iranians.
 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 The major source of Tudeh revenue appears to be from membership
 dues and sales of publications, although no precise information is
 available.  Considerable aid comes from Soviet-Iranian trade through
 private deals. and some from Communist organizations abroad, but no
 figures are available.  Most commercial deals with orbit countries
 are carried on by official government agencies, but detailed inform-
 ation is.lacking.  The Tudeh Party appears to have adequate funds,
 although reports indicate the necessity for continuous pressure on
 members to pay their dues and increase sales.

 XII.  SOVIET-SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 The following diplomatic personnel including and above the rank
 of attache are officially listed in Iran:  USSR - 25; Czech - 3;
 Rummanian - 11; Polish - 1; and Hungarian - b.  The total for all
 five countries is officially set at 37, but the actual staffs includ-
 ing service workers is probably nearer 150.                           All are currently
 located in Tehran, except for the temporary movements ofmembers of
 the Soviet Trade Delegation and the trips of various officers to
 and from the Soviet Union, usually via Pahlavi or Tabriz.  The
 principal sections of the Soviet Embassy are (1) diplomatic, (2)
 consulate-general, (3) trade delagation, (4) VOKS, (5) Soviet hospital,
 (6) TASS, and (7) information and cultural services.  It is estimated
 that the number of persons engaged in propaganda activities is between
 50 and 100.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 The Soviet Hospital in Tehran has a staff of about 20 Soviet
 doctors and nurses.       It is well-run, but fees are high and there
 is no free clinic.  Exhibits of Soviet films, paintings, etc. are
 periodic and shown either by invitation at the Soviet Embassy or
 at the Irano-Soviet Cultural Society.  The Soviet Embassy has.
 claimed that 100,000 people in Tehran read Russian, although the
 actual number is probably nearer 50,000.  The Iran-Soviet Cultural
 Society has an estimated membership of 500, mostly in Tehran,,and
 provides the principal machinery for the dissemination of overt
 propaganda among the upper classes of Iran.
 Soviet domination and active operation of the Caspian Sea
 Fisheries under a concession due to expire January 31, 1953 provides
 the USSR with an invaluable means of unrestricted communication
 between Iran and the USSR, as well as the opportunity of supporting
 Soviet personnel and conducting activities in the Caspian area.
 XIII.  COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 None of the Communist international organizations have instal-
 lations in Iran at the present time; nor have ary of them held
 congresses or conferences there.  Fifteen Iranians attended the
 Moscow Economic Conference in 1952 and five Iranian Communists
 attended the 19th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party the same
 year.     There is some evidence that the Tudeh Party has received
 funds from Communist organizations abroad although information re-
 garding the amounts is unavailable.  There is also some evidence
 that Iranian Communists sent some funds to aid Egyptian Communists
 and North Korean war casualties, although, again, the amounts are
 unknown.
 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 Tehran is the center for all Tudeh communications activity in
 Iran.  Sub-centers appear to exist in Isfahan, Abadan or Ahwaz, Tabriz,
 Resht, and Meshed.     The courier system, probably operating through
 the Tudeh truckers union, appears to be very effective.  International
 terminals appear to be Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Warsaw, Geneva, Zurich,
 and Prague, and communications seem to be effective.  It is assumed
 that the Soviet and, satellite missions in Tehran provide pouch
 service as well as radio communications through their own services.
 The closest contacts are believed to be with the USSR, which
 serves as the principal source of instructions, literature, and news-
 print.  France is the principal headquarters for overseas activity
 among Iranian students, and Egypt is the main recipient of Iranian
 Communist donations and propaganda support.

 The principal recent non-Soviet or satellite foreign emissaries
 have come from Italy, Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon.  In 1952, Pietro
 Nenni, leader of the Italian Socialist Party and vice-President of
 the World Council of Peace Partisans visited Tehran; in 1951, Yusuf
 Hilmi, Secretary-General of the Egyptian Peace Partisans came from
 Cairo with the declared objective of organizing a "conference of peace
 supporters to be attended by Middle, Near Eastern, and North African
 delegates.?  And Munim Ghazali, Secretary of the General Students,
 Organization of Egypt arrived, probably for the same purpose.  Also
 in 1951, Arif al Din, Secretary of the Syrian Communist Party, visited
 Tehran; and in the same year ,Abd-al-Riaz.Hashimi and Mustafa al-Aria,
 well known members of the Lebanese Communist Party, came to Iran.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN IRAQ:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 The Communist Party of Iraq, outlawed since its inception in
 1927, had by 1951 been reduced to near impotence by a series of govern-
 ment roundups and trials.  In that year, the party set out to rebuild
 its strength:  it redefined its aims, called for the expulsion of
 all undesirable. elements, and decreed that party cadres were hence-
 forth to operate as a disciplined core under the cover of other broader
 groups.  The party's program, issued in October 1951, aimed principally
 at (1) propagandizing the World Peace Appeal; (2) infiltrating and
 encouraging the trade union movement and organizing the workers of the
 State Railways; (3) organizing a campaign for the interests of slum
 dwellers; and (4) encouraging the formation of legal political parties
 representing labor groups.  The party paid particular attention to
 the trade unions, but an attempt to organize a central Trades Union
 Congress was blocked by the Iraqi Government.
 The failure of a general strike called in connection with a
 nationalist memorial celebration on Portsmouth Treaty Day in January
 1952 served to demonstrate the weakness of their October program.
 The party then began a new and somewhat more successful push to
 bring students and young intellectuals into the Communist fold by
 emphasizing nationalist themes and most recently concentrated upon
 the formation of a broad popular front in opposition to the present
 government and Western influence.
 II.  TACTICS
 Changing Soviet policies, frequent government repression, and
 factionalism stemming from its own organizational weakness, have led
 the Iraqi Communist Party to engage in frequent shifts in tactics and
 immediate objectives.  At present, the party champions, directly or
 through front organizations, the most popular issues of the day --
 anti-imperialism and anti-Zionism.  It has likewise attacked govern-
 ment corruption and economic injustice, tying these themes to its
 anti-Western campaign by accusing the present ruling elements of
 being subservient to the British.  Civil disorders have been fomented
 or prolonged and the party has not infrequently joined with other
 groups, including some of the extreme right in such endeavors.  As
 in other Near Eastern countries the party has also made use of the
 national aspirations of various minority groups, especially the Kurds,
 whenever it appeared expedient to do so.
 In the latter half of 1952 the party profited from a favorable
 combination of factors.  The establishment of the weak government of
 Prime Minister 'Umari in July 1952 resulted in four months of relative

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 freedom from government suppression.  The government, uneasy at the
 prospect of trouble in the period of transition toward the elections
 of January 17, 1953, made little attempt to restrain the opposition
 parties, including Communists.
 At the same time the party began to develop more vigorous
 leadership, received increased support from the Soviet Legation and
 possibly from the Syrian Communist Party, and developed a more popu-
 lar propaganda line.  In April 1952, Sharif al-Shaykh became Secretary
 General of the Iraqi Communist Party after his attendance at the
 Berlin Peace Conference and a visit to Moscow.  His task has been to
 reorganize the party.  Soviet support to the party apparently consists
 largely of Soviet propaganda carried out covertly. by Soviet Legation
 officials in Baghdad, who established contact with the Iraqi Lawyers'
 Association, provided it with newsprint, and utilized it as a dis-
 tribution point for Arabic language propaganda printed locally or
 in the USSR and Prague.
 Of particular significance in enhancing party strength and
 unity was the recent emphasis on promoting a nationalist united
 front.  This tactic was apparently being carried out in response to
 a policy directive by Khalid Bakdash, leader of the Syrian Communist
 Party, delivered in August 1952.  Bakdash called for cooperation
 with all democratic groups for the purpose of forming a national bloc
 in which Communists would play an important role.  Communist influence
 soon increased in the leftist National Democratic Party (NDP) and
 the neutralist United Popular Front (UPF), both extremist nationalist
 groups with little representation in Parliament.
 The riots of November 22-25, 1952, and the abolition of all
 political parties and arrest of opposition leaders which followed,
 also frustrated Communist attempts to work through the Iraqi opposi-
 tion parties.  The imposition of martial law in Baghdad province
 has likewise contributed to keeping the party more or less dormant,
 and may compel it to search for yet another method of operation,
 III.  CAPABILITIES
 The greatest. handicap to the formation of a united front
 movement in Iraq is the need of the Iraqi Communist Party to utilize
 local party organizations, none of which has as yet great organiza-
 tional strength and forcefulness.  As in its unsuccessful attempt to
 organize trade unions late in 1951 in order to achieve greater in-
 fluence in Iraqi national life, the party has once again found that
 the government can exercise sufficient pressure to collapse the
 broader organizational base of its movement.  The Iraqi Communist
 Party organization remains largely intact.  However, the important
 party functionaries are known to the government and could presumably
 be arrested comparatively easily.

 The open manipulation of the January 1953 elections has assured
 the government, still dominated by the traditional elements grouped
 around former Premier Nuri a-Sa'id and the Palace, of an overwhelm-
 ing victory.  Whether the opposition groups will decide or will have
 the chance to carry on activities outside Parliament, since they
 cannot function within it, remains to be seen.  Unless the serious
 and fundamental organizational weaknesses of the opposition movement,
 especially those of the Communists, can be overcome, a Communist-
 dominated popular movement is unlikely to emerge in the near future.

 COMMUNIST( IN IRAQ: ASSETS
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 . Now estimated at 10,000 members, the Communist Party of Iraq
 contained only half that number a year ago.  Its membership lacks
 internal organizational strength and resources.
 Though capable of attracting new followers rather rapidly under
 weak, yet reactionary governments, the Iraqi Communist Party will,
 at present, fade rapidly if subjected to determined suppression.
 The degree of Communist Party control over other organizations
 is hard to determine in an area where the party is still seeking to
 gain support primarily by championing issues already popular locally.
 The party appears to have achieved some penetration of the National
 Democrats and the United Popular Front, and several labor unions.
 The unions are small, poorly organized, and of no political importance.
 The two parties, officially disbanded after the riots of November 22-
 23, 1952, but still operating informally  have, on the contrary, an
 influence out of proportion to their numerical strength because they
 are vehicles for the extreme nationalists, the discontented young
 intellectuals of Baghdad, and the emerging, dissatisfied middle
 class.  Altogether, a maximum of 12-15,000, or 0.3 percent of the
 total population of about 5,000,000, may be under Communist influence.
 Most of these are to be found not among the poor, most of whom are
 still bound to traditional ways, but among educated, urban, and
 Westernized groups -- young intellectuals, minor civil servants,
 teachers in secondary schools, and members of religious and ethnic
 minorities.  Communists and Communist sympathizers are strongest
 in Baghdad, where all political life centers, less so in Basra, the
 Kurdish provinces of Sulaimaniya and Erbil, and in Najaf and
 Kerbela.
 While the bulk of the membership is illiterate, poorly
 disciplined, and inexperienced organizationally, the leadership
 core, derived primarily from the effendi and college group, tends to
 be contentious and jealous for prestige and power, and given to
 forming splinter movements.  Under pressure, they have easily given
 up and turned state's evidence.  Wholesale hangings during 1948
 and 1949, and frequent arrests since, have sharply reduced the
 number of Communists whose membership dates back to an earlier
 period.  The average age of the leadership is 19-30 years.

 II. ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 Iraqi elections are closely manipulated by the government and, since
 the Communist Party is illegal,  no Communist candidates are allowed.
 Fellow-travellers, broadly defined by the government to include almost
 any opposition, are discouraged and hampered in every way possible.
 The present party chief, Sharif al-Shaykh, was temporarily arrested
 in 1911.8 when he attempted to stand for election from Sulaimaniya.
 Communists last ran for Parliament in 1937, when 11 were elected as
 independents or through legal parties.  Parties as such are of no
 significance.  The January 17, 1953 elections took place under martial
 law, and parties, which are in most cases merely convenient labels for
 the followers of individual politicians, have been banned.  Comparison
 of party electoral strength is therefore neither meaningful nor possible.
 III. MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 There have been no Communist attempts at insurrection in the
 past.  The maximum opportunity for armed uprising in the near future
 would be through inciting tribal insurrection either.in Iraqi
 Kurdistan, which has an irredentist nationalist movement, or among
 the Shia tribes of the south Euphrates.  The Kurds might raise a
 force of 150,000 to-200,000 men, well-led, and redoubtable fighters.
 But they possess only rifles and limited ammunition, and while
 capable of giving the Iraqi army a sharp encounter, could be contained
 without too much trouble unless promptly reinforced from outside.  At
 present, however,. the party has not the organization, strength,
 impetus, freedom, nor weapons to attempt to promote any such excitement.
 Since demonstrations are an acknowledged and time-honored
 form of political activity-in Iraq, the Communist Party.is prepared,
 as in the November 1952 riots in Baghdad, to cooperate, invited or
 uninvited, with any political group in fomenting or aggravating a
 riot.   No recent riot, however, is known to have been initiated and
 carried on exclusively by Communist followers.  The recent claim
 made by the local Communist Committees of Basra, Najaf, and
 Sulaimaniya in reporting to the Central Committee in December 1952
 that they were capable of taking over and holding for a short time
 previously chosen key locations, typifies above all the romantic
 immaturity of many minor Communist functionaries in Iraq.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 Membership in the Communist Party, taking part in any of its
 activities, or publishing any matter expressing approval of its
 doctrines carry penalties ranging from seven years imprisonment to

 outlaw certain unions, notably the railway and Basra port workers'
 unions.  About 14 unions are still recognized by the government,
 but none is of national scope.  The two now reported to be Communist-
 controlled (January 1953) are not of strategic importance -- the
 cigarette workers and auto drivers, both in Baghdad.  The dearth of
 capable labor leadership has permitted the Communists to gain influence
 on the directing level.in most unions at some time.  The recent
 strike patterns indicate,  however, that such influence is not decisive.
 No clearly political strikes have taken place in the past two years.
 Communists. may have aggravated disorder in strikes stimulated by
 economic grievances in Basra, Habbaniya (British military airport),
 and also in two oil-fields.  Iraqi unions are not affiliated to WFTU.
 The ICFTU recently sent a delegation on a regional tour which included
 Iraq, and plans are being laid for a regional office to assist non-
 Communist unions in the area.  This should go far toward minimizing
 causes of labor discontent and providing a more effective non-
 Communist channel for their expression.
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND PROFESSIONAL
 ORGANIZATIONS
 A.  Front Organizations
 1.  Students' Union.     Also called the Council of Iraqi Students
 Union an  the U  ono  Youth,l this organization maintains groups of
 probably not more than 20 to 30 students each in several colleges,
 Particularly the Law, Medical, and Higher Teachers' Colleges.  It
 is reported that several of the leaders are maintained and financed
 in college by the Iraqi Communist Party in order to foster political
 activity among students.  Their leadership talent is not conspicuous
 but Iraqi students have a tradition of political activity and are easily
 responsive to political agitation.  It was this Students Union which
 was particularly active during the November 1952 riots in Baghdad.
 3o far as is known, there are no non-Communist student organizations.
 The Union has sent, or attempted to send, a representative to World
 Youth meetings since 1949; for the last two years, the government
 has denied passports for this purpose.
 2.  Committee for Aiding Justice.  A front group within the Iraq
 Lawyers' Association, the Committee for Aiding Justice is now
 .l. This organization may be iTe"ntioal with the Young Men's
 Democratic Association, said to have 500 members.

 the most active and effective center of Communist activity in Iraq.
 (See B-1 for a discussion of the degree of infiltration of the
 Lawyers' association.)
 3. Partisans of Peace (Ansar al-Salam).  Principally confined to
 Baghdad, this organization seems to be a secondary activity for most
 of the Communist and left-wing adherents of other organizations.
 Its actual membership is unknown.  It was launched in 1950.  The
 present chief of the Iraqi Communist Party, Sharif al-Shaykh,
 attended the Berlin Peace Conference in April 1952. The leaders of
 this front are predominantly Shia, including a respected divine and,
 until they were subjected to prosecution, two of Iraq's most noted
 living poets; they may have been mislead by an idealistic appeal to
 religious sentiment.  Membership seems to have fallen off.  Activity
 has been limited to rather mild demonstrations and to collecting.
 signatures for various petitions and protests,  which have had
 incidental propaganda value to the Communist cause.
 4.  Armenian Progressive Society.  The leader of the Iraqi branch
 of this regions  organization  cen ered probably in Jerusalem) is
 Krikor Bedrosian, an influential Communist. courier during and since
 World War II and a member of the Iraqi Central Committee, at present
 serving a five-year prison term.  Its strength is unknown, though
 probably small.
 B.  Infiltrated Organizations
 1. Lawyers' Association.  The Communists have shown considerable
 shrewdness and ability in gaining control of this, the one professional
 organization for lawyers in Iraq.  By rigging elections, they have
 now managed to place Communists in both the presidency and vice-
 presidency, and, more important, Communists and Communist-sympathizers
 now hold all but one post on the powerful &dministrative Committee
 and all but two on the Disciplinary Committee.
 Infiltration of the Lawyers' Association is of considerable
 significance, because (1) all practicing lawyers in Iraq are
 required to belong; (2) the Association has semi-juridical powers,
 i.e., it can disbar lawyers who they believe have violated professional
 ethics; and (3) the social status of lawyers is high, and the legal
 profession plays a dominant role in Iraqi politics.
 .Announced Communist aims vis-'a-vis the Lawyers' Association
 are to use it (1) to spread propaganda; (2) recruit among students
 and intellectuals and other]awyers; (3) give wider currency and

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 greater respectability to Communist aims and propaganda lines; and
 (4) use the courts wherever possible as a platform from which to
 spread Communist attitudes and defend Communist suspects.  This
 activity can be easily expanded because the current Communist line
 is especially appealing to frustrated young graduates of the Law
 College who. greatly exceed the number that can be absorbed into
 government service and the current opportunities for private practice.
 This group has regular contact with the Central Committee of the
 Iraqi Communist Party and also with the Soviet Legation in Baghdad,
 through Boris Hhlysov, an attache,
 2.  Political Parties.  Until officially banned at the end of
 November  V5 Z,, two le  Wing political parties, the United Popular
 Front and the National Democratic Party (both of which were infiltrated
 to some degree) readily collaborated with the Iraqi Communist Party
 and Peace Partisans toward their common aims of (1) abrogation of the
 Iraq-British Treaty and withdrawal of British forces, (2) full
 sovereignty, (3) nationalization of foreign oil concessions, etc.
 These parties had no particular brief for world Communism; collaboration
 was based solely on. what they conceived to be identity of interest on
 local issues.  The IragiCommunist Party on its part was prompted by
 specific directives to use existing parties as a base to form a
 popular front movement.  The parties have recently been banned, but
 the respective groups are meeting informally; it is not yet clear
 what form of organization the political opposition will assume or
 how much Communist influence it will contain.
 3..  New Iraq Stage Group.  Reported in July '52 to have presented
 a play at Fine Arts Institute attacking the government and using a
 Communist line.  Nothing further known of this group.
 VII.  CONUUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 No Communists are believed to be in government at the policy-
 making level.  Small numbers have been discovered from time to time
 in the army, where the main effort has been directed toward the non-
 commissioned grades, especially in the technical services.  The.
 latest such discovery, in September 1952  involved about 30 students
 in the Military Technical School;.16 students were convicted. A few
 police have turned to Communism, including several among the guards
 at the detention camp for political prisoners, where most Communists
 under sentence are held; police are somewhat more vulnerable to
 Communist appeal than the armed services because of lower pay, prestige,
 and morale.

 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 Since the current Communist propaganda line is virtually
 synonymous with that of a large segment of the nationalist press, it
 is easy to place Communist propaganda material and thus emphasise
 party line themes without much prompting.  All radio broadcasting
 originating in Iraq is goverznaent owned and free of Communist
 taint although not less anti-Western in its leading political commentary.
 IX.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COZTUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 Until the dissolution of all political parties in November 1952,
 the Istiglal party, a small group of right-wing extremists, occasionally
 collaborated with the Communists in common tactics and demonstrations.
 One or two members of the central committee of the United Popular
 Front, as well as the secretary of the National Democratic Party
 and a member of its administrative committee are suspected to be
 Communists.  For an account of Communist infiltration into the Lawyers'
 Association, see VI.-B-1 above.
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA. MEDIA
 A1-Qa'idah,lcirculation unknown, is the official organ of the
 Iraqi  ommur_ist Party.  It is produced clandestinely and distributed
 by hand.  In recent weeks it seems to be'printed on a press; formerly
 it was turned out on a Roneo machine.  This small operation does
 not reach the general public, hence has far less impact than
 nationalist papers which, at times, echoed the Communist line.  All
 conspicuously pro-Communist papers have been closed down subsequent
 to the martial law regime late in November 1952.  There are no
 Communist owned or controlled printing establishments in Iraq.

 Friday afternoon, the Moslem sabbath.  Programs are received clearly,
 in good and fluent neo-classical Arabic and (in the case of

 to Moscow broadcasts is forbidden in Iraq, but there are indications that
 a good many do listen.  Soviet broadcasts, however, pay little
 attention to internal Iraqi affairs.  They emphasize any difficulties
 in Iraqi relations with Western powers.  Azerbaijan station is also
 listened to widely in the Kurdish areas, both in Iraq and Syria, where
 it is about the only clearly-heard Kurdish-language broadcasting
 except for the very limited programs in Kurdish of Radio Baghdad.

 Very little is known regarding party finances.  The party is
 said to be so-poor as to be able only to pay small living allowances
 to its central cadre, its funds derived chiefly from sale of its
 publications, which in turn may be subsidized by the Soviet Legation.
 Subscriptions are solicited from members for special activities, such
 as sending of delegates to international front meetings.  Occasional
 assistance may come from the party in Beirut or Damascus, and the
 Iranian Tudeh Party reportedly furnished a printing press.  Until the
 large-scale Jewish exodus in 1950-51, the Iraqi Communist Party
 obtained large contributions by threatening wealthy Jews with future.
 difficulties if they did not contribute to the now defunct Communist
 front organization, the Anti-Zionist League.
 The Soviet Legation at Baghdad, the only official Soviet or
 satellite agency in Iraq, has an        . attache, Boris Khlysov, who
 is the contact man with the Iraqi Communist Party's propaganda group
 and the lawyers' Association Dell.  Overt propaganda activities of
 the Legation are not extensive] they appear to be limited to occasional
 invitational film showings at the Legation.  No Iraqi-Soviet "friendship"
 societies are known to exist.

 At some of the international front meetings Iraq has been "represented"
 by Arab students residing in Europe and probably deputed to go by
 Yusuf Ismail (alias Mustan), head of an Arab Communist group in Paris.
 This device served to overcome the denial ofpassports to personnel to
 attend such meetings.

 General supervision of the party in Iraq is thought to be
 exercised by the Syrian Communist Party.  Instructions originating
 with Khalid Bakdash of Syria were last intercepted in the fall of
 1951.  An irregular system links the internal branches of the party,
 including members serving jail sentences. Contact with the Tudeh
 of Iran is maintained both through the Basra branch, which keeps in
 touch with Khorramshar, and via the northern border villages of
 Zaynawi and Khanaqin.  The border is easily crossed at many points.
 Also, the considerable pilgrim traffic to and.from Iran to the
 Shia holy cities in Iraq offers excellent cover for passage of
 messages or personnel, and one very difficult to screen.  Four Tudeh
 agents were reported to have come into Iraq in this way in 1952.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM. IN ISRAEL: OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 As expressed in the June 12, 1952 resolutions of the Israel
 Communist Party Central Committee, the major objectives of Israeli
 Communists are to (1) increase their influence among the working
 class and the new immigrants; (2) capitalize on economic conditions
 resulting from the government's austerity policy; and.(3) establish
 a Communist-controlled united front by creating peace committees
 wherever possible, expanding the activities of its front organizations.
 and seeking to organize common action with the extreme leftists of Mapam.
 Internationally, the party attacks Israel's resumption of relations with
 West Germany, opposes Israeli cooperation with the Weston military
 defense, and instead makes propaganda for the Soviet-sponsored 5 power
 peace pact, and increased commercial relations with the Soviet bloc.
 In June 1952, the party's leader Samuel Mikunis said that, once
 in power, the Communists would (1) void all treaties.with."warmongers";
 (2) nationalize all foreign concessions; (3) dismiss all US experts
 and US army officers present in Israel as advisors: (4) call for the
 formation of a popular militia; and (5) adhere to the UN 1947
 resolution on Palestine calling for the formation of a."democratic"
 Arab state in Palestine, and call for the return of Arab refugees and
 the restoration of their property.
 The Communists no doubt. find it difficult to gain the adherence
 of the working manses while at the same time attacking Mapai's economic
 policies.  Labor has been the chief beneficiary of the socialist
 program of Mapai and there are far more dissatisfied elements among the
 middle class than among labor.  Moreover, by paying increased attention
 to the Arab minority in.Israel, which like the Communists is anti-
 Zionist and has many grievances against the existing Israeli regime,
 the party, which can now marshal only five percent of the electorate,
 is also creating greater difficulties for itself in gaining recruits
 among Israeli Jews.
 The underlying strategic policy of the Israeli Communist Party
 has a double aim.  Among the Arab minority, the aim is to attract
 Arabs to the party and the USSR so that when and if a separate Arab
 state is set up in former Palestine, in conformity with the 1947 UN
 resolution, this state will be Communist-controlled.  As a parallel
 activity,  Soviet diplomatic and religious personnel are
 attempting to  entice the Greek Orthodox Arabs, who form a large
 proportion of the Arabs in Israel, away from Greek leadership

 and orient them towards the Moscow Patriarchate. -Among the Jewish    ?
 majority, the aim is to get control of all leftist and trade union
 organizations and create new ones with a view to isolating Israel
 from the West and orienting it toward the USSR.  The Israeli Communist
 Party also directs Communist activity in Jordan, the. main object of
 which is to oust the British.
 The Israeli Communist Party at present is committed to
 constitutional procedures but may soon find it difficult to operate
 because of government repression and popular indignation caused by the
 current Soviet anti-Zionist campaign.  There is no information on any
 preparations for underground activity.
 The party's principal motifs in propaganda appeals are: (1) the
 Mapai government is permitting the US to prepare Israel as a spring-
 board for an attack on the USSR and the precipitation of World War
 III; (2) bad economic conditions are due to excessive Mapai arms
 expenditures to support US aggressive aims; (3) justice must be
 given to the Arab minority and discrimination against them must cease.
 These themes in turn are carried through specialized media or
 organizations to the Arab minority, to intellectuals (for example,
 through the Academic Committee for Peace), immigrants from satellite
 countries (for example, through propaganda issued in.Hungarian,
 Rumanian, and Bulgarian in addition to Hebrew and Arabic), and, in
 still other ways, to students, and women.
 Among Arabs, the party has been able to capitalize chiefly
 on its attitude toward minorities, championing equal treatment for
 them.   Among Jews, the party has benefited  from sympathy among some
 for the official ideology of the Soviet state and the assistance
 which the Soviet bloc gave Israel at the beginning?of the state's
 existence.  Among the latter, it has 'also found support because the
 Soviet regime put an end to Czarist pogroms and was-thought to have
 outlawed anti-Jewish discrimination.  The USSR has also had some
 success in portraying itself as the principal force which destroyed
 Hitler and as the main enemy of fascism.  The fact that there are
 still some 3,000,000 Jews in the USSR and satellite countries whose
 future might be jeopardized if Israel were to adopt a position of
 open antagonism to the USSR has until recently kept the Israeli
 Government from repressing Communist activities.
 The party's voting power in the Kneset (Parliament) and in
 municipal councils is augmented by tactical alliances-.with the left -
 wing of the Mapam Party and by supporting motions of other parties
 (even right wing) which attack the government.  As a labor party,.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 the Communist Party is a, member of Histadrut (general federation of
 labor unions and parties) and its key members participate in high
 Histadrut councils.  Communists have occasionally also gained' -
 control or influence in non-Communist organizationsby cultivating
 the left-wing elements (especially Mapam) within such groups while-
 simultaneously attacking their right-wing opponents.  This is
 facilitated by the pronounced doctrinaire factionalism which is
 characteristic of Israeli organizational life.  The same tactics and
 conditions also work against the Communists.  On occasion non-Communists
 have expelled Communists from collective settlemxents. The only trade
 union which the Israeli Communist Party is known to control is the
 Congress of Arab Workers.  Its appeal here is based. on the party's
 opposition to Zionism and the Mapai government, and upon its championship
 of minority rights against discrimination by the majority.
 The principal source of new Jewish members seems to be from
 Communists or sympathizers arriving among new immigrants, especially
 from the satellite countries, Iraq, and North Africa.  New Arab
 members seem to be recruited mainly from the Nazareth and Haifa
 (including Acre) areas, where Arab demands for equal pay and treatment
 with Jews and cessation of harsh treatment by the Israeli security
 forces have been championed by the Israeli Communist Party.  The party
 also attempts to exploit traditional Greek Orthodox friendship for
 Russia.
 III.  CAPABILITIES
 The outlook for the Israeli Communist Party to carry out its
 current objectives and further  Soviet policy is diminishing daily.
 The disappearance of Mapam leader Mordecai Oren in Czechoslovakia,
 followed by the Prague trials and the case of the Jewish Soviet
 doctors have resulted in an increasing number of phyaical attacks
 against local Communist institutions, including Soviet Embassy
 property; a Russian bookstore, and Israeli Communist Party head-
 quarters in Jerusalem.  On January 15, 1953, the Israeli Government
 forbade the circulation of the Israeli Communist Party newspaper,
 Qol ha'Am ("Voice of the People") among members of the armed forces and
 the party- may find its operations increasingly hampered.  Histadrut
 is reported considering the expulsion of the Israeli Communist Party
 from its ranks.
 The developing situation will probably lead to a rapid decline
 in the party's influence among the Jewish majority at large and also
 among members of  Mapam, where the extreme left elements can be
 expected to come under increasingly heavy fire.  It is likely,
 therefore, that any increase in the relative and absolute strength
 of the Israeli Communist Party will be confined to the Arab community,
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 which can be expected by approve rather than resent the anti-Zionist
 moves of the Soviet bloc.
 The conflict between Arab and Jewish nationalism, together with
 the anti-Zionist orientation of the USSR and Communism, have historically
 been the greatest disadvantages under which the Communist movement
 has had to labor,  As the Arab-Jewish antagonism has increased, it has
 become increasingly difficult for the Communist movement to weld both
 Arab and Jewish elements together into a single effort of cooperation.
 In the past, Soviet anti-Israeli moves, such*as Soviet support in the
 UN for the internationalization of Jerusalem have always caused
 considerable defection from the party and reduced its influence.

 COMMUNISM IN ISRAEL: ASSETS
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 In the absence of concrete information, Communist Party strengtl
 in. Israel may be roughly estimated at about 5,000.  The membership is
 drawn largely from unskilled labor and white collar workers, particular
 among Jewish immigrants from the Balkans and the Arab countries.  Party
 membership is concentrated largely in the cities of Tel Aviv, Haifa,
 Nazareth, Jerusalem, and Rehovot, Arab membership especially in Nazaret
 and Haifa.
 The number of "hard-Dore" Communists is unknown, but their
 quality does not seem'to be high.  Nothing is known regarding the
 quality of the party membership in terms of its readiness to incur
 hardships or cling to the party line.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 The Communist Party vote in the 1951 election was 27,234 or
 about 3 percent of the total vote. In addition, the extreme left
 Mapam Party polled-86,,095 votes.    In the same election, the other
 major parties received the following number of votes
 Mapai (government party)
 256,456
 General Zionists (opposition)
 111,394.
 Ha Po'el ha-Mizrahi (government)
 46,347
 Herut (opposition)

 1,400
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 There have been no recent cases of violent demonstrations, and
 it is estimated that not more than 300 persons could be recruited for
 any such demonstration.  Although the policy does not seem to be to
 create violent demonstrations, probably because of efficient suppressive

 methods of the Israeli police, orderly demonstrations of citizens
 carrying banners protesting against government policies have been
 organized by the Communist Party.  Probably less than 500 weapons
 could be gathered by the Communists in case of a Soviet-Western war.
 There are no reports that the Communist Party in Israel sponsors azy
 paramilitary organizations.
 IV.  GOVERN9dENT POLICY. TOWARD COMMUNISM
 The Israeli Communist Party and its front-organizations.have
 full freedom to operate openly lfut are watched by Israeli security
 services.  Communists have been quietly ousted from'the army.
 Communists have freedom to travel abroad to Communist and front
 conferences.   The policy of the government toward the party will
 probably become unofficially more repressive in the future, and the
 state is capable of controlling the party by force.
 V.  CCMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 Since Histadrut, the General Federation of Labor,"is controlled
 by the government Mapai Party, it is unlikely that the Communist Party
 has been-able to gain much of a foothold there.  No data are available
 regarding the number of Communists in key industries, but it may be
 assumed that the proportion would be roughly the same as that shown
 for voting strength in the principal cities of concentration.
 Histadrut has no affiliations with international Communist
 confederations, having left the WFTU in 1950.
 VI.  C OAMUNIS T INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL
 The following organizations are known to be Communist-front:
 Israel-USSR Friendship League, Organization of.Democratic Women
 (affiliated with the Women's International Democratic Federation),
 Tarbut La'am, Israel Peace.Comnittee (affiliated with the World Peace
 Council), Democratic Youth Federation (affiliated with World
 Federation of Democratic Youth), and the Academic Committee for Peace.
 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 Of the 120 members of the Israeli Hnesset (Parliament), 5 are
 Communist and 4   are extreme left Mapam members who have been closely
 identified with the Communists.  The number of Communists on the

 The number of Communists and O=nunist-sympathisers in the armed forces
 is unknown.  It is believed that the extent of their influence in top
 lovel positions is nil. The number of, Communists and Communist_
 sympathizers in the police and security services is probably small.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 The number of people influenced by Communist propaganda in non-
 Communist-controlled educational, religious, or entertainment groups, or
 in. the non-Communist-controlled radio and press is believed to be not
 over several thousand.

 ideologically close to the Communists and cooperated with them.  This
 influence and recent Soviet anti-Zionist moves has caused Mapam to split,-
 with only a minority joining the pro-Communist faction,
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 There are five known Communist publications in Israel.
 Qol    is a Hebrew daily, which also publishes weeklies in Bulgarian,.

 Hungarian, and Rumanian.  Circulation of the daily Qol h&'Am is about
 2,000. The circulation of the weeklies is unknown.  Pr-el  srael, a
 Yiddish weekly, has a circulation of 300 to 400.  Circulation figures
 for the Arabic-language monthly al-Ittihad and the Hebrew monthly Ha-
 Derekh are unknown.  No information is a ailable regarding the Ara !o-
 anguage al-Darb.  Qol ha'Am is believed to have its own printing
 press, but no   ng Mfger is known regarding Communist printing
 facilities.
 Over 50,000 books per year, including technical and non-technical
 publications, are imported from the USSR.  They are dumped on the market
 regardless of import quotas and at only nominal prices.  It is presumed
 that they have a wide circulation,  Lepac, Ltd., a Tel Aviv bookshop,
 is controlled by the Communist Party.  It imports only Soviet books and
 is currently under investigation by the-Israeli Government for using..
 surreptitious means to surpass its import quotas.
 The Israeli Communists do not control any radio facilities but
 have been allowed to speak occasionally over the government-controlled
 Israeli Radio.
 A 1951 survey of 1,737 Israelis showed that 28 percent regularly
 listened to Soviet bloo broadcasts.  Those listening to USSR stations.
 were mostly of Polish (39 percent), Russian (24 percent), and
 Rumanian (10 percent) origin.  Russian was the most popular language
 with 12 percent of those interviewed.
 .XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 In March 1950, the Israeli Communist Party collected over
 M,000 in a fund drive.        In 1952, the party announced a fund-raising
 campaign with the ambitious goal of IL15,000.  It is not known whether
 the local party receives help from Soviet or satellite legations or
 consulates.  In 1950 Jewish Communists and fellow-travelers were said
 to be preparing a world-wide fund-raising campaign under the slogan
 of aid to Israel. -Tarbut la'Am ("Popular Culture") clubs were used as
 a front for this purpose in North and South America.   Amounts
 collected are unknown, but one organization is said to have remitted
 $6,000 in goods and cash from the United States.
 XII.  SOVIET SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 The USSR, Czechoslovakia, and Rumania have both Legations and
 consulates in Tel Aviv.  Hungary and Bulgaria have Legations in Tel Aviv.
 Poland has consulates in both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.

 in Moscow in October 1952, one went to the  World Peace Council meeting
 in Berlin in July of that year, and one left for Prague in January
 1953 to attend the World Federation of.Democratic Youth Conference.

 Soviet Embassy personnel appear to be cultivating Greek
 Orthodox Arabs in order to exploit the old antipathy between Arab and
 Greek Orthodox Church members and their Greek clergy.  It is not

 or whether there would be argt prospect of military assistance in case
 of an East-West conflict.

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 CO14MUNISM IN MOROCC01:  OBJECTIVES. TACTICS. AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 The over-riding immediate goal of the Moroccan Communist Party
 since August 1946 has been to persuade the local independence movements
 to join with the Communists in a united national front in preparation
 for a revolution for "national liberation" and against French control
 and American imperialism.        In the meantime, the Communists are seeking,
 through propaganda, to destroy sympathy among Moroccans for the US and
 the UN, to foster suspicion of Western defense plans and to increase
 local hostility toward the French administration.  The serious economic
 grievances of the population -- both native and French -- receive
 particular. attention from the Communists who have a strong influence in
 the cauntry's largest labor union.  To achieve its immediate goals,
 however, the Moroccan Communist Party is faced above all with the task
 of recovering its own strength.
 II. TACTICS
 Having failed thus far in achieving a common front with the
 nationalists, the Communists have attempted instead to participate,
 uninvited, in strikes, demonstrations, and riots initiated by the
 nationalists, encouraging any tendency toward violence.  Similarly,
 Communist propaganda pamphlets have dealt at times entirely with
 nationalist grievances and aspirations without placing them in a
 Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist framework.  Thus, in pretending to make the
 nationalist cause their own, the Communists try to impress upon the
 popular mind the need and desirability of a common front.  Occasionally,
 such tactics are accompanied by attacks on the nationalist leadership
 for their refusal to join them in a popular front, for demonstrating
 faith in the US or the UN, or for cooperating or conducting negotiations
 with the French.  Moreover, Communists have been known to facilitate
 the arrest of nationalists and to claim credit for successful nationalist
 demonstrations.
 1.    Since the Communists have no party in Spanish Morocco and, in fact,
 are unable to operate in that zone to any appreciable degree, this
 discussion is confined to the French Zone and Tangier.

 III.  CAPABILITIES
 To date, the small Moroccan Communist Party has had practically
 no influence on the nationalist movement, largely because (1) the
 nationalists realize that such ties would alienate many sympathizers in
 non-Communist areas; (2) the nationalists are concerned with maintaining
 close ties with the Sultan; (3) financial support for the nationalist
 movement' is derived primarily from Morocco's upper middle class; (/+) the
 local Communist Party is largely French in membership, and (5) the present
 nationalist leadership is aware of the opportunistic nature of Communism
 and the devotion of Communism to a foreign power whose domination the
 nationalists would dislike as much as that of the French.  Moreover, the
 Moroccan Communist Party, never large, has declined to its lowest postwar
 strength.
 The capabilities of the Moroccan Communist Party at this time
 remain minimal either for achieving its own current local objectives or
 for furthering Soviet policy.  It has always been hampered by the poor
 quality of its leadership.  This is evidenced by the success of the
 Istiglal, Morocco's largest nationalist party, in infiltrating the
 Communist-dominated labor federation, UGSCM (Union G4'nirale des Syndicats
 Confea1r4 du Maroc, Moroccan affiliate of France's Communist-controlled
 CGT).  Although Moroccans are legally forbidden to belong to unions and
 carry on union activities only by official toleration, Istigial has been
 able to gain control of the organization.  Three factors have been largely
 responsible for the decline of Communist influence among labor:  (1) the
 ability of certain nationalist leaders, (2) the ineffectiveness of Communist
 leadership, and (3) deportation by the French of the ablest and most in-
 fluential Communists in the party and the Union.  There is little likelihood
 of early improvement in the Communist leadership potentials either in the
 party or its labor federation.
 In his statement to the Central Committee of the Moroccan Communist
 Party in late 1951, Ali Yata (Moroccan Communist Party leader, now deported
 and imprisoned) perceived certain additional and fundamental reasons for
 the party's failures.  He noted that the party had become so panicky that
 excessive secrecy prevented the organization from getting anything done.
 From November 1950 to the end of 1951, the Central Committee had held only
 one meeting and that lasted only one day.  For two years, no sectional or
 regional meetings had been held except in Rabat.  Not a petition for the
 Stockholm Peace Appeal or a Five Power Conference had been circulated
 up to that time.
 A more fundamental problem remained unsolved, Ali Yata said,  Those
 sections having primarily Arab membership neglect Morocco's European

 minority, believe it dishonorable to use the French language, and have
 even rid themselves in an "arbitrary and authoritarian" manner of comrades
 who had retained some colonial prejudices instead of helping such men
 change their minds.  In sections in which French membership predominates,
 All Yata often found a "paternalistic, colonist" attitude shown toward
 Moslem members.
 The Moroccan Communist leaders also find themselves in a dilemma
 because of conflicts in nationality among its membership.  In pretending
 to be part of the Moroccan nationalist movement, the Communist Party
 alienates local French residents of the middle class who fear for their
 safety in an independent, nationalist Morocco, and loses many local
 skilled French workers who fear the competition of native labor without,
 however, gaining the support of nationalist Moroccans.  This last group
 will continue to join instead the core of the nationalist movement - the
 Istiglal Party.  Membership in Istiglal, though not without its dangers,
 at least does not put any Moroccan under the double jeopardy of being
 suspect as both a Communist and a nationalist as well as defenseless against
 present police controls and the future uncertainties of Communist intentions,
 All Yata, in his 1951 diagnosis, considered the weakness of the party
 to stem above all from the fact that it presented itself merely as a part
 of the nationalist movement.  Although All Yata stated that it was correct
 for the Moroccan Communist Party in August 1946 to place "national liber-
 ation" at the center of its program, he criticized it for subsequently
 using the traditional bourgeois nationalist concept of "independence" to
 mean formal independence without any social content, thus sacrificing the
 distinctive content of the Communist Party's program.  The party, he charged,
 dealt with all major nationalist problems, but failed to relate them to
 the daily needs of the laboring man.  Thus it neglected the "vanguard" and
 the "fundamental armies" of national liberation until even the labor union
 movement "ceased to be oriented by us," while the nationalist movement
 itself was left to seek independence both through the UN, an instrument
 of "imperialists," and through the United States which now "occupies"
 Morocco.
 The French Government throughout 1952 has been increasingly firm
 in its repression of the Moroccan Communist Party.  Some of the non-
 Moroccan leaders have been deported, and virtually all others not pre-
 viously arrested for some infraction, have been held under arrest since
 the December 1952 riots which followed the death of the Tunisian labor
 leader, Ferhat Hached.  The Moroccan Communist newspaper L'Espoir,.long
 suspended from publication because of financial difficulties, had re-
 appeared during 1952 but both the Communist Party and its press have
 been legally proscribed since the December 1952 riots.

 -4-
 The Communist labor federation maintains considerable strength in
 railway, highway transport, power, and electrical communications unions.,
 and some strength in port unions, but it lacks capabilities for pro-
 ducing a complete tie-up by strikes in even a single industry without
 the assistance of one or both of the two anti-Communist European labor
 federations.
 The effective leadership of the Moroccan Communist Party and
 almost all of the hard-core has always been European.  With the member-
 ship estimated now at not more than 4,000 or 5,000, this probably still
 remains true.  The Moroccan Communists who have thus far found the
 majority of their recruits among French residents have more recently had
 some limited success among young French-educated Moslem intellectuals.
 If the effectiveness of its leadership were not at such low ebb,
 the Communist potentials in Morocco, even given the present membership,
 might present a totally different picture.  During the past year, an
 unhealthy political atmosphere has developed in which an astute
 Communist leadership might find more fertile ground than at any time
 since the end of World War II.  This situation is the outgrowth of a.
 combination of factors, including (1) severe French repressive actions
 against the nationalists, (2) the exile or arrest of all the principal
 nationalist leaders, and (3) the total failure of the nationalists to
 achieve any of their aims during the past two years.  Because of the
 small number of Istiqlal members of leadership calibre and the
 impatience of younger, more radical, yet inexperienced members, the
 absence of such essentially moderate Istiglal leaders as Balafrej,
 leadership of an effective nationalist "underground" might become the
 prize of outsiders.  However, the Communist Party appears at this time
 to be too impoverished financially and too feeble in membership,
 organization, leadership, and influence to capitalize on the opportunity
 presented to them by nationalist frustrations and the absence of the
 relatively moderate, anti-Communist and experienced top nationalist
 leadership.
 The Communists will probably continue their efforts to join
 forces with the nationalists; and, in the long run, there is some danger
 that should the nationalists fail to achieve their objectives they would
 accept Communist support rather than look to the West.  While it
 presently remains doubtful that the Communists will capture control of
 the nationalist movement in Morocco, Communist influence might ultimately
 induce the nationalist groups to adopt more anti-Western policies and
 increasingly to resort to direct action.

 I.  NUMERCAL STRENGTH
 The Communist Party of Morocco is known to be quite small;
 however, the exact size of the present membership is not known.  A
 total strength of about 3,000 members would seem to be a reasonable
 estimate in terms of the known activities of the party.  While the
 Moroccan Communist Party has recently-been most active in urban areas
 of the French Zone, particularly in Casablanca,' the geographical dis-
 tribution of party members is not known.  The effectiveness of the party's
 leadership has diminished greatly as the result of the recent arrest of
 many of the principal leaders by the French Protectorate authorities.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 Since no general election has ever been held in any of the three
 zones of Morocco, and since, in local elections, the native electorate
 by law and by choice is always very restricted, the electoral strength
 of the Communist Party of Morocco cannot be estimated.
 III.. MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 The origin of the December 1952 riots in Casablanca and elsewhere
 in the French Zone in Morocco is not definitely known.  Probably it was
 essentially nationalist, although Communist agitators may have worked
 individually to provoke increased violence.  Because of the relative
 weakness of the Communist Party, it has apparently hesitated to instigate
 violent demonstrations on'its own initiative during recent months.  But
 party members may well have capitalized upon situations stemming from
 grievances voiced by nationalists and others.  At present, the party has
 no ability to rally sizable elements of the population to violent action.
 It can only capitalize upon the discontent aroused by other, more popular
 groups.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 In the Spanish Zone, the local authorities have, of course, been
 relentless in their suppression of Communism ever since the advent of the
 Franco regime.  In the French Zone, the Communists were tolerated, though
 hampered by the Protectorate authorities, until Eecember 1952.  Since
 then, the party has been officially outlawed, its newspapers suppressed,
 and its leaders either arrested or deported fron the country.  In
 addition, a number of less-important Communists have been taken into
 custody.  In the international zone of Tangier, where Communist groups
 are still permitted, the local police restrain Communist agitation whenever
 such agitation can be construed as a possible threat to public order.

 V.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON LABOR
 Because of the numerical weakness of the Moroccan Cosa^'unists,
 no reliable estimate can be formed of their strength in key industries.
 Despite their modest numbers, the Communists, because of their discipline
 and energy, were for some time able to wield control over the largest
 labor federation in the French Zone, the General Union of Confederated
 Syndicates of Morocco (UGSCM), which is affiliated with the Communist-
 dominated General Confederation of Labor (CGT) of France.  But the Communists
 eventually proved unable to withstand'a bid for control by the more
 numerous and better-led nationalists.  Although important posts in the
 UGSCM are undoubtedly still in the hands of Communists, it is generally
 believed that leadership of this organization has, within the past year
 or so, definitely passed into the hands of the nationalists.  The
 remaining two labor federations in the French Zone, the French Confeder-
 ation of Christian Workers (CFTC) and Workers Force (FO) are both anti-
 Communist.
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 Although a considerable number of Communist front organizations
 were established in French Morocco immediately after World War II, few
 if any of these enjoyed any continued success.  Consequently, by December
 1952, when the Protectorate officials outlawed the Communist Party, most,
 if not all, of these front organizations had already ceased to function.
 Although information is not complete on the subject, it seems probable
 that if any such organizations exist at present, they are small and
 relatively inactive.
 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 No information is available regarding the number of Communists and
 Communist sympathizers at the higher levels of the government, including
 the armed forces, either in the Spanish or in the French zones.  The number
 appears, however, to be extremely low.  Insofar as the number of Communists
 and sympathizers in agencies of the government administering nationalized
 industries is concerned, no figures are available; but Communists are known
 to work at the lower levels in railroads, ports, telephone and telegraph
 installations, and in mining operations.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 Except for occasional illegal pamphlets, the Communist press.is now
 non-existent in Morocco.  Since radio broadcasting is a government monopoly,
 no Communist influence has been felt in this field.  There is likewise no
 evidence of Communist infiltration in religious organizations.  Though
 Communists are known to hold?posts in the school system in the French zone,
 it seems probable that the number of such persons is small in terms of the
 total number of teachers.

 IX.        COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 In the Moroccan Socialist Party, there is no evidence of Communist
 influence.  However, in the nationalist Istiglal Party, which follows an
 anti-Communist program, there are certain individuals, some of whom work
 as labor leaders in Istiglal-controlled labor federation (UGSCM), who
 are said to follow the Communist "line."
 Reports of unknown reliability have also circulated that certain
 opportunistic leaders of some of the smaller nationalist splinter groups
 have upon occasion voiced pro-Communist sentiments.
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 Suppression of Communism in the Spanish Zone is so rigorous and
 of such long standing that apparently very little propaganda activity
 takes place in that area.  With'the outlawing of the Communist Party in
 the French zone toward the end of 1952, Communist propaganda in that
 region has been confined to occasional clandestine handbills and pamphlets.
 At least one of the pamphlets is thought to have been printed outside
 Morocco and smuggled in for distribution.  Prior to the suppression of
 the Moroccan Communist Party, two Parisian Communist dailies circulated in
 the French Zone; but their total circulation was only about 225 copies daily,
 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 No specific information is available regarding the financial
 resources of the Moroccan Communist Party. The small scope of the
 party's activities before it was suppressed indicate that they were small.
 The infrequency with which the Communist "weekly" newspaper appeared is
 further evidence of the party's financial weakness.  Urgent appeals to
 the public for donations were very frequent.
 XII.  SOVIET SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 Neither the Soviet Union nor any of its satellites have consular,
 diplomatic, or trade representatives in any part of Morocco.  Though the
 Soviet Union is entitled by treaty to participate in the international
 administration of Tangier, it has never availed itself of this privilege.
 XIII. COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 As a result of the recent outlawing of the Communist Party of
 Morocco,  Communist international organizations can no longer function
 actively in Morocco, except in the international zone of Tangier.  Even
 before the suppression of the Communist Party in the French Zone, Communist
 international organizations had ceased to be active in that area.  Infor-
 mation is not available concerning the existence or operation of such
 organizations in the international zone.

 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 The Connrunist Party of Morocco, like those of Algeria and Tunisia,
 is under the direction of the French Communist Party.  The influence of
 the French Communist Party is known to be exerted, at least in part, by
 bench representatives to Moroccan Party Congresses.  Furthermore,
 Communist couriers are known to pass through North Africa from time to
 time.

 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN PAKISTAN:   OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 The broad aims of the Communist party in Pakistan are to root
 out the vestiges and influence of Anglo-American "imperialism" in
 Pakistan and to.end the present regime in Pakistan and set up a
 "people's democracy."  To achieve these larger goals, specific short-
 term objectives of the Communist party include (1) the withdrawal of
 Pakistan from the Commonwealth and the sterling bloc; (2) the nationali-
 zation of British-owned commercial enterprises in Pakistan; (3) the
 removal of British personnel from all branches of the Pakistan Govern-
 ment and especially from the armed forces; (4) the reorientation of
 Pakistan's import-export policy and the country's trade relations with
 a view to making the economy less intermeshed with that of the Western
 powers; (5) a change in status of Pakistan from a dominion to a
 republic; (6) the removal of the Kashmir issue from.the UN; (7)
 the reduction of Pakistan's defense expenditures; (8) the dissolution
 of the present Constituent Assembly and its reelection on the basis of
 a broadened franchise; (9) the withdrawal of the draft of basic princi-
 ples for the new Constitution recommended to the Constituent Assembly's
 Basic Principles Committee; (10) the repeal of laws granting the
 government the power to arrest persons without trial; (11) the con-
 fiscation of the holdings of large landowners without compensation.
 These objectives have been keyed primarily to the requirements of
 international Communism, with secondary emphasis on promoting the
 domestic political fortunes of the party.  There are no indications
 now that the, objectives, all of which are being pursued simultaneously,
 are likely to be revised in the near future.

 H.  TACTICS
 The party organization in Pakistan is following a united front
 policy.  It appeals for the support not only of the working class but
 also of the peasantry and some bourgeois elements.  Cutting across
 class boundaries, it appeals for the support of "anti-imperialist, anti-
 capitalist, anti-feudal, and democratic elements."                               It does not reject
 support from any quarter, left or right.
 Communist attempts to build this united front appear to follow
 constitutional procedures and avoid or at least deemphasize illegal
 activity and violence.  To employ, or urge the use of, force would tend
 .to alienate the public, thereby isolating the party, and would also in-
 vite vigorous repressive action by the government.  Opportunities do
 exist, however, for open activities and agitation. Past attempts to
 build a united front while employing violence have failed and there is
 no evidence at present of any positive preparations for launching a
 campaign of violence in Pakistan.  While the present policy of the
 party in general envisages, neither the advocacy nor the instigation
 of violence, it does allow participation in outbreaks of violence in-
 stigated by others if fairly broad-based and deemed likely to benefit
 the party; under special circumstances, the party might be prepared to
 instigate violence on a limited scale.  Even with regard to strikes,
 the party has directed its members to avoid fomenting strikes on the
 labor front, but has also advised them to lend full support when spon-
 taneous strikes do break out and then to make every effort to end them
 successfully and quickly.
 The present program of building a united front and observing
 constitutional procedures assigns a prominent place to propaganda and
 agitation.  Among the major propaganda themes employed in Pakistan are
 that (1) Pakistan is independent in name only and that imperialism,
 with which the present government is allied, still dominates the coun-
 try, exploiting, it and retarding its cultural and economic development;
 imperialism, the Communists say, prevents industrialization and impedes
 the liquidation of feudal and semi-feudal systems of agriculture;  (2)
 foreign imperialist domination of Pakistan can be ended, and real pro-
 gress achieved, as in China, only after the local bourgeois and feudal
 elements, and the Moslem League governments representing them, are de-
 feated and power transferred to the people; (3) they can be defeated if
 the people unite; (4) in more and more areas of the world, especially
 in Asia, the democratic forces are already rising up against the crack-
 ing imperialist system and its native servitors; (5) the imperialists
 will not hesitate to involve the world in a global war and in fact have

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 already launched their aggressive war in Korea; and (6) the USSR and
 the People's Democracies strive for peace and support the people of
 Pakistan and the colonial countries in their struggle for true
 independence.
 The party makes a concentrated effort to relate its major propa-
 ganda themes to the interests, problems, and grievances of specific
 sections of the population -- students, workers, women, etc.   In parti-
 cular, the Communists seek to capitalize on nationalist, anti-imperialist
 feelings and economic interests by linking the rise in the cost-of-living
 to "capitalist-imperialist" preparations for war.   In order to identify
 the party with the aspirations of the various sections of the population,
 they also agitate for a minimum wage law, agrarian reform, increased
 educational facilities, lower school tuitions, free medical aid, civil
 liberties, peace, and aid to refugees from India.   In order to guide
 popular feelings on these issues in the direction the party desires,
 much of this propaganda and agitation is carried out through the various
 Communist front organizations tailored to reach and attract such special
 interest groups as peasants, workers, writers, students, women, and
 youth.
 Communication between the party in Pakistan and Communist  forces
 outside the country probably does not represent any great difficulty:
 Communist publications are being imported, individual Communists and
 delegations come to, and go from, Pakistan fairly frequently, and both
 the USSR and Communist China maintain Embassies in the country.  The
 transfer of funds is not so easy.  Various roundabout devices are re-
 sorted to, prominent among them being the retention by the party of
 proceeds from literature shipped in from Communist countries.
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 The ability of the party to attain its objectives is not great
 now and present indications are that it will not increase significantly
 within the next few years.  An important factor severely limiting this
 ability is the condition of the party itself.  It is a small organiza-
 tion and appears to have only a small popular following.  Its representa-
 tion in the central and provincial legislative assemblies of Pakistan
 is negligible.  In the past, the party has been plagued with internal
 dissension and disunity and this may still characterize to some extent
 the organization in Vest Pakistan.  Also, the party appears to be
 financially weak.  The party's own view of its deficiencies in East
 Bengal toward the end of 1951 was that it was disorganized at the sub-
 provincial levels, inefficient, lacking in sufficient mass contact and
 sympathy, inadequate  in assuring publicity, and weak financially.   Its
 financial position was in fact so bad that the party in East Bengal was
 even considering closing down the Provincial Center and some of the
 sub-provincial branches unless funds were forthcoming in the near future.
 Another important factor limiting the capabilities of the party
 is the strong position of the Moslem League and its attitude towards the
 Communist party.  The League is the largest single political party in
 Pakistan and has the largest popular following.  It led the movement
 for the establishment of Pakistan and has been the party in power at
 the national, provincial, and sub-provincial levels since the inaugura-
 tion of the Dominion in August 1947.  Moslem League governments do not
 hesitate to move against the Communist party when action is called for
 and the party has been hit hard on several occasions by the repressive
 measures taken against it by the government.  The association of two
 top Pakistani Communists with the abortive Rawalpindi conspiracy in
 early 1951 exposed the party to such government repression as to practi-
 cally inactivate it and its front organizations for a period of several
 months.   The student demonstrations leading to rioting in Karachi during
 the first half of January 1953 presented the government with another
 opportunity, which it was quick to seize, for moving against the
 Communists.
 Despite the party's lack of ability to achieve its short-term
 objectives through its own unaided efforts, the Communists in Pakistan
 may possibly see some of their short-term objectives fulfilled in the
 next few years.   This is possible largely because some of the short-
 term objectives of the Communists correspond to the goals of other
 diverse groups.   The withdrawal of Pakistan from the Commonwealth, for
 example, is demanded by the Jinnah Awami Moslem League, the largest
 .Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 opposition party in Pakistan, and by a number of other groups, some of
 them fanatical Moslem societies.  There is a significant amount of
 popular sentiment for severance of ties with Britain and it is possible
 that within the next few years this sentiment, based on a .variety of
 motivating factors, may prevail.

 COMNNNISM IN PAKISTAN:  ASSETS
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 No precise figures are available for the membership of the Communist
 Party of Pakistan.      The total almost certainly does not exceed 5,000 and
 may be considerably smaller. However, there may be as many as 50,000
 members of organizations under Communist control.  Even if all of these
 are considered to be strongly influenced by the Communist Party -- an
 assumption probably not justified -- the proportion of Communists and
 devoted followers in a total population of approximately 76,,000,000 is
 well under 1/100 of one per cent.
 Geographically, the Communist membership and following is con-
 centrated most heavily in the provinces of Punjab and East Bengal and in
 the capital city of Karachi.
 Communist Party members and sympathizers in Pakistan are drawn in
 largest part from the educated urban middle class.  This is notably the
 case in West Pakistan; in heavily populated East Pakistan, the party's
 following apparently includes a proportionately larger number of workers
 and peasants.  Very little is known about the tenacity with which members
 cling to the party.  However, the precipitous decline in membership after
 the exposure of the Rawalpindi conspiracy in March, 1951 (See Section III)
 and recurrent reports of frequent internal conflicts in the party indicate
 that at the present time the Communist movement in Pakistan is not
 particularly significant.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 Pakistan has had no general elections since it emerged as a nation
 in 1947.  Partial elections held in Punjab province in 1951 brought a vote
 divided as follows:

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 In the Northwest Frontier Province in 1951 three self-styled
 "Communist sympathizers" ran on the ticket of the Jinnah Awami Moslem
 League, the dominant Moslem League's major opponent.  All were defeated.
 It is probable that Communist vote-getting power would be greater
 in East Bengal (East Pakistan) than in any of the West Pakistan provinces.
 The test of the party's overall electoral potential will not be made until
 the first general elections, which are not expected to be held before late
 1953 and probably considerably later.  The Communist Party proposes to
 participate in these elections.
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 The present policy of the Pakistan Communist Party in respect of
 the use of violence appears to be one of making common cause with other
 groups whenever demonstrations occur.  The party has little or no inde-
 pendent capability for violent action.                                 As was demonstrated in the Dacca
 riots of early 1952 and the Karachi riots in January 1953, however, it is
 ready to seize opportunities to join in demonstrations and to attempt to
 turn them to Communist purposes.
 In March 1951, the Pakistan Government arrested a small number of
 civilians and high ranking army officers on charges of conspiring to
 establish a military dictatorship and eventually a Communist state.
 Fifteen individuals were brought to trial and 14 were convicted.
 Although the Rawalpindi conspiracy case, as it is known, evidently
 did show connections between Communist members and sympathizers and a
 number of ranking army personnel, there is little evidence to suggest that
 Communist influence in the Pakistani armed forces is now other than
 negligible.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 The Communist Party is a legal political organization in Pakistan
 and is free to conduct political activities openly.  Communist leaders,
 however, are kept under close surveillance by Pakistan authorities.  Both
 the provincial and the central governments in Pakistan are vested with
 sweeping powers to deal with threats to public safety.  The central
 government, for instance, is authorized by the Pakistan Security Act to
 detain individuals, disband organizations, and censor or ban publications
 under specified conditions.  Neither provincial nor central authorities
 have hesitated to exercise these powers and have shown themselves able to
 withstand Communist agitation  against the application of public security
 legislation.  There is no evidence that the Pakistan authorities could not
 deal effectively with any likely Communist threat to the security of
 the state.

 V.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 Communist influence among Pakistan workers is believed to be
 reflected mainly in the Pakistan Trade Union Federation (PTUF), a Communist-
 dominated organization affiliated with the Communist international con-
 federation, the World Federation of Trade Unions.  PTUF affiliates are
 estimated to have no more than 25,000 members, or from 5 to 10 per cent of
 the unionized workers in Pakistan.  Factional differences occurred in the
 PTUF in 1951 and were still in evidence at the organization's annual con-
 ference in April, 1952.
 Few other details are available on the PTUF. In particular, data
 on the size and location of its individual affiliated unions are largely
 lacking.
 A small number of labor organizations led by members of the Jinnah
 Awami Moslem League, the Pakistan Socialist Party, or by former members
 of the PTUF may be subject to some measure of Communist influence.  The
 limited information available indicates that these organizations are of
 negligible importance in Pakistan labor.
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 Only sketchy data are available for the Communist front organ-
 izations active in Pakistan.  Summaries of these data follow:
 Appealing to youth and student groups are the East Pakistan Youth
 League, with headquarters in Dacca, East Bengal, the East Pakistan Youth
 Federation, and the Democratic Students' Federation.  The last named
 organization, which is centered in the West Pakistan cities of Lahore and
 Karachi, is reported to have about 200 members and an additional 300
 sympathizers.
 The Purba Pakistan Mahila Samiti is the Communist-dominated women's
 organization in East Pakistan.  It maintains contact with the Women's
 International Democratic Federation.
 Front organizations in "cultural" and professional fields are:
 (1) The Pakistan-Soviet. Cultural Association, with
 branches in Karachi, Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Lyall-
 pur, Okara, Multan, Sukkur, Shikarpur, Hyderabad, and Dacca,
 is engaged in organizing lectures, conferences, and dis-
 cussions on various aspects of life in the USSR.
 (2) The Pakistan-China Friendship Society, with
 branches in Lahore and Kan:chi and perhaps in other cities
 of Pakistan, is devoted to promoting Pakistani good will
 toward Communi t China.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 (3) The Pakistan-Czechoslovak Cultural Society was
 reportedly established in December 1951.  No other in-
 formation about the organization is at hand.
 (4) The All Pakistan Progressive Writers' Asso-
 ciation which has units in Karachi, Lahore, Gujranwala,
 and Lyallpur, includes several writers of the first
 rank and the Association is probably the most important
 Communist propaganda organization in Pakistan.
 (5) The All-Pakistan Theater Association, the
 main body of which is in Karachi, is closely related
 to the Progressive Writers' Association and the member-
 ships of the two organizations overlap.
 (6) The Three Arts Circle, located in Karachi,
 also promotes Communist propaganda.
 (7) The "peace" front in Pakistan is the Pakistan
 Peace Committee, with branches in Lahore, Gujranwala,
 Karachi, Peshawar, and Dacca.  It is a standard Communist
 "peace" organization and presumably works under the
 guidance of the international Communist "peace"
 movement.
 None of these front organizations is presently a major or even
 a significant force in Pakistan.  The membership of the various fronts
 is small. and to a considerable extent duplicating.
 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 The Pakistan Constituent Assembly, which serves both as a central
 legislature and as a constitution-making body, has among its 79 members
 three known Communist sympathizers.  There are no known Communists or
 sympathizers in the executive branch of the central government, and there
 are very few in the provincial governments.  With the exposure of the
 Rawalpindi conspiracy, the Pakistan armed forces are believed now to be
 substantially free of Communist influence at any level.  And there is no
 indication of extensive Communist infiltration into the police and security
 forces of the states and central government.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 The Communist Party itself has virtually no impact on Pakistani
 public opinion, but some Communist influence is nonetheless exercised
 through front organizations and psrty-controlled or influenced publications.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFO     0
 IX. C01240IST INFILTRATICN OF NON-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 The Jama'at-i-Islam, a right-wing religious-political organization
 devoted to furthering the principles of Islam, is known to have limited
 relationships with Communist front organizations, but the degree of
 Communist infiltration is insignificant.
 The small Pakistan Socialist Party has had some association with
 Pakistan Communists since its break with India's Socialist Party in 1947.
 A more important organization, the Azad Pakistan Party, which was
 founded in Lahore in 1950, is reported to have a Communist cell within
 its ranks.  The leading figures in the Azad Pakistan Party are the wealthy
 Punjabi fellow travellers, Mian Iftikharuddin and Shaukat Hayat Khan.
 Communist influence in this leftist party is therefore believed to be
 substantial.
 The Jinnah Awami Moslem. League, which has thus far constituted the
 principal opposition to the dominant Moslem League, includes among its
 members a few known Communists and sympathizers.  Their influence is
 presumably of some consequence although the party cannot be classified
 as Communist-controlled.
 The Civil Liberties Union of West Pakistan, an organization whose
 chief aim is to promote agitation against the provincial and central
 governments on the issue of civil liberties, is considered a united front
 of several opposition parties rather than a Communist-controlled organ-
 ization.  Its leaders have, however, included prominent Communists and
 sympathizers.
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 Two students' papers, the Students' Voice and the Students' Herald,
 about which few details are available, are believed to be the only outright
 Communist periodicals in Pakistan.
 Pro-Communist domestic publications are the Pakistan Times of Lahore,
 published by Mian Iftikharuddin, with a circulation of 18,000-?_0,000; the
 Socialist, with a circulation of 1,000; and Imroze2 also published by
 Iftikharuddin, with a circulation of 3,000.
 Printing establishments available to Communists, if not under
 Communist control, are the People's Publishing House in Lahore,, the
 Pakistan Times Press in Lahore, and the Imroze Press in Karachi and Lahore.
 The quality of the work done by these publishing houses is good.

 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 There is a substantial flow of Communist propaganda material into
 Pakistan from India, the United Kingdom, and from Soviet/satellite countries.
 Imports of periodicals from the USSR were halted by the Pakistan author-
 ities after the disclosure of the Rawalpindi conspiracy in March 1951.
 However, the Soviet Embassy, the Czechoslovak Legation, and the Chinese
 Communist Embassy provide channels for the inflow of Communist books,
 pamphlets, and periodicals.  Communist books and pamphlets are sold widely
 and cheaply in Pakistan cities.
 The Soviet Embassy in Karachi issues occasional press releases in
 the Bengali and Sindhi languages and a regular weekly bulletin in Urdu.
 The Communist Party of Pakistan has no domestic radio facilities and
 no apparent influence over radio programs.  Moscow programs beamed to India
 and Pakistan are broadcast daily in English, Hindustani, and Bengali.  A
 program from Tashkent, in English and perhaps Bengali, is also beamed to
 India and Pakistan daily.
 XI.  FINANCIAL C0NDITION
 The Communist Party of Pakistan apparently has limited funds.  For
 a period of more than a year, from March 1950 to May 1951, the party in
 West Pakistan is reported to have spent only the equivalent of US $8000
 to ?$10,000.  Available information is that the East Pakistan party is
 chronically in financial difficulties and presumably financially weaker
 than the West Pakistan organization.
 Sources of Communist Party income, in addition to or apart from
 subsidies from abroad, are membership dues, donations, levies on the
 incomes of party members, sales of propaganda material (supplied in largest
 part from abroad by the Communist movement), and, it is reported, profits
 from trade with the Coimnznist bloc.
 No data are available as to the absolute or relative importance of
 these various sources of income.  A Karachi firm entitled Traders is reported
 to have been set up under Commmznist Party auspices to conduct trade with
 the USSR, with the profits to be divided on a 30-70 basis between the firm
 and the party; no information has been received as to success or failure
 of this enterprise.
 XII. SOVIET-SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 Official missions from the Communist bloc countries to Pakistan.
 are the Soviet Embassy, with a staff of 14 officials; the Chinese Communist
 Embassy, with eight official personnel; the Czechoslovak Legation, the
 Polish Trade Mission, and the Hungarian Trade Mission.  These three
 European satellite missions have a total of seven officials and an unknown

 XIV.  COI1MTJNIST COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK
 No detailed information is available on Communist communications
 systems and techniques in Pakistan.  The geographic separation of East and
 West Pakistan poses a difficult communications problem for the Communist
 party in Pakistan; in practice, at least, party units in East Pakistan
 appear to be under the direction of the Indian Communist Party rather than
 under the authority of the Pakistan Party.
 South Asian Stalinist parties have traditionally looked to the
 British Communist Party for guidance, and Communist emissaries to the

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN SYRIA AND LEBANON:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 The Communist Party of Syria and Lebanon, the oldest, largest,
 and best-organized Communist movement in the Arab world, was outlawed
 in Syria in December 19+7 and in Lebanon in January 1948.  Always
 closely linked since their inception in 1924, the Syrian and Lebanese
 Communist Parties became separate entities at the end of 1943, following
 the dissolution of the Comintern, but by January 1951 had merged again
 into a single organization.
 Khalid Bakdash, a Moscow-trained Communist of Kurdish descent,
 has been the leader and theoretician of the Communist movement in
 Syria. and Lebanon since 1935.  Bakdash, head of the joint Central
 Committee of the Syro-Lebanese Communist Party as now constituted,
 and other highly-placed members of the Communist Party hierarchy and
 the principal Partisans of Peace organizers in Syria and Lebanon are
 in close contact with the Soviet Legations in Beirut, Lebanon, and
 Damascus, Syria.  Bakdash is believed also to coordinate Communist
 activities in Iraq and to exercise a certain amount of influence over
 the Jordanian Communist Party, which, however, is controlled by the
 Arab Section of the Israeli Communist Party.
 Syria and Lebanon are declared, from the Communist viewpoint,
 to be in the phase of "democratic national liberation."  The objectivckk.
 are:   (1) to put an end to "imperialist political and economic
 domination" and eliminate the agents of the "imperialist powers"; (2) to
 liquidate the remnants of feudalism in Syria and Lebanon; and (3) to
 establish a popular democratic regime.  In September 1952, Bakdash
 described the specific duties of the party as follows:  (1) extension
 of the campaign.for peace and national independence through mass
 movements against the military projects of the Western powers and
 against the "treacheries" of  the rulers in Syria and Lebanon; (2) the
 establishment of democratic freedom for the masses; (3) dissemination
 of propaganda concerning the peaceful policy of the Soviet Union;
 (4) attraction to the Partisans of Peace of the masses and notables,
 irrespective of social position, even regardless of their opinions of
 the internal situation.
 II.  TACTICS
 The  Communist Party in Syria has been forced to slacken both
 overt and covert activities since the establishment of the Silu-Shishakli
 military regime, though some front organization activity persists.  The
 Partisans of Peace operates legally in Lebanon, where most party energy
 is channeled into "peace" activities.  Communist strategy in both

 countries continues to be concerned primarily with:  (1) strengthening
 the labor unions and extending the labor movement among the unorganized
 masses; (2) encouraging political activity among the workers, particularly
 in support of "peace" and in opposition to the military projects of the
 "imperialist" powers; (3) organizing activities among the peasants in
 support of their demands for land and water.  The holding of peasant
 conferences and the formation of committees to defend and direct these
 demands is an immediate goal.
 Propaganda targets for the creation of a people's-national front
 movement have been members of government, the.press, minorities
 (particularly the Armenians, the.Greek Orthodox, and the Kurds), teachers,
 student groups, intellectual and professional elements, women's
 organizations, and villagers.  Up to the present, Soviet and Communist
 propaganda has made progress primarily by capitalizing on the parallels
 between (1) its alleged goals and those of local nationalism, and (2)
 the rising discontent of the urban bourgeoisie with the corruption,
 self-interest, and monopoly of power of the governing groups.
 Communist agitation among industrial workers in Syria has never
 reached serious proportions.  Only two unions are considered to be under
 threat of Communist control, the Mechanical Loom Operators (Aleppo, no
 estimate of membership) and the Mechanics (Damascus, 187 members).
 Communist membership in these two unions is probably small.  In Lebanon,
 Mustafa al-'Aria, the leading Communist, is president of both the
 Printers' and Typesetters' Union and of the Federation of Labor Unions,
 an unincorporated body of some 19 unions.  Of an estimated total
 Federation membership of 10,000, only a small portion (300) can be
 considered Communist.  The majority of the members are leftist or
 neutral and willing to benefit from 'Aris'e enegetic leadership.  The
 Hotel, Cafe, and Restaurant Union (800 members) is powerful and
 Communist-controlled.  'Aris is also a member of the Executive Committee
 of the World Federation of Trade Unions and has been a delegate to
 many Communist World Congresses.
 Few Communists in Syria and Lebanon pay regular dues, and the
 party depends largely upon contributions from wealthier members and
 sympathizers.  Some of the contributions go toward party operations,
 most of the money being used for Partisan of Peace campaigns and special
 causes for which appeal is made locally.  It is assumed that funds are
 also received from various outside sources, through the Soviet Legations
 or in the form of "presents" from front groups abroad.
 The Communists have never succeeded in electing their candidates
 to either the Syrian or Lebanese Parliaments.  In the 1951 Lebanese
 general elections, however, it is believed that only direct interference
 by the government prevented the elections of at least one pro-Communist
 deputy.

 _3 -
 III.  CAPABILITIES
 Communist capabilities for recruitment appear greatest among
 the students and professional men, especially those in the legal
 profession.  Strongly nationalist reactions among politically sensitive
 elements in Syria and Lebanon against the Western "imperialist" and the
 US and UK role in the establishment of Israel have tended to make even
 wealthier men sympathetic toward the USSR as the enemy of the US and the
 UK.  Some of these have become interested in Communism, or at least in
 participating in various front activities.  This same intense nationalism,
 however, is also a danger to the Communist movement and has caused
 considerable deviationism within party ranks.
 The general trend in the area toward some form of socialism is
 a factor which the Syro-Lebanese Communist Party has been able to exploit.
 Lack of ideological sophistication among the various socialist parties
 of Syria and Lebanon has also made it relatively easy for the Communists
 to penetrate into some of them.
 The strongest factor limiting  Syro-Lebanese Communist Party
 effectiveness is that the party promotes the interests of a foreign
 country -- the Soviet Union.  Communism is also still widely held to
 be anti-religious and to be destructive off.mily life.  Religion and
 family life are the two poles around which the life of the average
 Syrian and Lebanese revolves. Communism has had the strongest appeal
 for groups looking for outside support for nationalist or separatist
 demands, but the enthusiasm of some of these groups for the USSR has
 been noticeabZr tempered by a dislike of Communism as a political and
 economic system and by an antipathy toward all foreign,_including
 Soviet, control.  The working class in Syria and Lebanon contains large.
 numbers  of religious and ethnic minorities -- especially Armenians --
 whose leadership cannot easily be imposed on Arabs and Moslems.  The
 Kurds have shown a reluctance to join a Soviet-led Kurdish independence
 movement in the absence of large-scale Soviet support.  Among the
 villages, in the autonomy-minded Druze and Alawite areas and among the
 tribesmen in the Jazirah, the predominant concern with regional and
 clan loyalties, rather than a political or class-conscious awareness
 of economic, social, and ideological problems is the principal barrier
 to Communist effectiveness among the masses.  Widespread illiteracy
 among the workers and peasants of Syria has hampered the spread of
 written propaganda.
 Before the advent of reform-minded governments in Syria and
 Lebanon during 1952, nationalist organizations, both of the left and
 the right, accomplished much of the disruptive work the Communists

 -4+ -
 would normally have expected to do themselves.  Major Communist
 opportunity in Syria and Lebanon appears to lie not in the present
 strength of the movement itself, but in the weaknesses of the regimes
 in power.
 The Syro-Lebanese Communist Party remains incapable of developing
 effective cadres in rural and urban areas and has not yet overcome the
 cultural and political estrangement of intellectuals from workers, city
 from countryside.  Communism, theoretically appreciated according to
 Stalinist classics, and energetically pursued, appears to be embodied
 in Syria and Lebanon in only a handful of over-worked leaders.  Should
 the present ruling groups fail to remedy the outstanding social and
 economic inequities in Syria and Lebanon, however, the traditional
 bulwarks against Communism will be seriously weakened.

 C0141UNISM IN SYRIA AND LEBANON:  ASSETS
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 Always closely linked since their inception in 1923, the
 Lebanon and Syrian Communist Parties split along geographical lines
 after the dissolution of the Comintern in 1944, but merged again into
 a single organization in January 1951.  The Syrian section, which is
 closely supervised by the party's founder and prime mover, a Kurdish
 Moslem named Khalid Bakdash, has traditionally been stronger than the
 Lebanese.  However, under the increasingly authoritarian Silu-Shishakli
 regime, Syrian Communists have been severely hampered in their activities
 in the past year, and the party is now virtually inactive in Damascus.
 The most recent estimates place the total Syrian membership in
 the neighborhood of 10,000 and the Lebanese at around 15,000; if sympa-
 thizers are included, these figures might be increased to 12,000 in the
 case of Syria, and 20,000 in Lebanon.  There are approximately 30 front
 organizations in Lebanon, and some 25 such groups in Syria.
 From its beginning, the Syrian Communist Party made particular
 efforts to recruit among minorities with nationalist or separatist
 aspirations, or among those with a keen sense of their unequal position
 in the Syrian state -- Kurds, Alawites, Druzes, and Armenians.  An
 estimated 45 percent of the total party membership in Syria are
 Armenians.  Among the Moslems, the party has attracted professional men,
 writers, lawyers, students, and white collar workers.  Except for
 Palestine Arab refugees, few workers and peasants have thus far joined,
 and Communist influence is not significant among the labor unions.
 There are perhaps 2,500 hard-core Communists in Syria; and around
 4,500 in Lebanon, coming mainly from trade unions and minority groups.
 The leaders of the Syrian and Lebanese Communist Party have demonstrated
 little discipline, initiative, or administrative ability, leaving the
 accomplishment of their party's tasks to particular individuals, rather
 than to effective cadres.  Moreover,'as Bakdash has asserted, they
 "usually think only within the framework of the situation and activities
 of existing branch committees and cells 5nd often within 7 narrow
 provincialism which does not look beyond its quarter or city....They
 do not think of anything new."  There is also a high turnover in
 personnel in both the Syrian and Lebanese sections.
 Communist Party membership in both Syria and Lebanon is con-
 centrated principally in the cities and larger towns.  The following is
 a rough estimate of the distribution of party strength by towns:

 Horns ......1,000                    Mount Lebanon..3,000
 Latakia ...l,000
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 Although Communism was legally outlawed in December 1947 in Syria
 and in January 1948 in Lebanon, the party has continued to present
 candidates in local and national elections in both countries.  In April
 1951, for example, a known Communist candidate was permitted to ran
 openly for public office in the Lebanese general elections.  In Syria,
 the Democratic National Front, a Communist political front organization,
 presented a list of its candidates for the Syrian national elections held
 in 1949.  In both contests, however, the Communists were defeated, regis-
 tering some strength only in Beirut, Aleppo, and Damascus.
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 The Lebanese Communist Party habitually attempts to exploit local
 dissidence and unrest by organizing mass demonstrations and riots -- or
 more commonly projecting themselves into those already taking place.
 Although Communists in Damascus are disinclined to risk a serious clash
 with the armed forces, particularly the security police, they are known
 to have participated in demonstrations by both leftist and rightist
 groups.  On October 12, 1951, aPartisans of Peace meeting in Horns clashed
 with police and was broken up with the temporary arrest of more than 100
 of the estimated 800 participants; seven Communists were arrested.  Before
 Colonel Shishakli's coup in November 1951 there were reports of clashes
 between small groups of Communists and members of the anti-Communist
 Syrian Social National Party, nearly all of which occurred in the Latakia
 area.  Since the coup, Communist demonstrations and open clashes with
 opponents have virtually. ceased.
 The party is said to have terrorist and goon squads in the Aleppo
 area; but their numbers are probably small and their equipment scanty.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD C04MUNISM
 Although both the Syrian and Lebanese parties have been legally
 proscribed, successive Syrian and Lebanese administrations, with the
 exception of the short-lived, firmly anti-Communist Za'im regime in Syria
 in 1949, have not been consistent in their efforts to curtail Communist
 activities. It has been only recently that the Silu-Shishakli government

 SECRET - SECURITY INFOBN TICN
 in Syria has clamped down on Communist -- including front organization -
 activities.  It refused exit visas to delegates to the Berlin Youth
 Festival.  Partisans of Peace pamphlets have been seized and distributors
 of tracts sent to prison.  Demonstrations have been frustrated in
 Damascus, but the police found it more difficult to cope with Communist
 and front organization activities in Aleppo and Homs, which are located
 in expanding industrial and agricultural areas.  The illegal Syrian
 Communist Party confined its overt activities to issuing pamphlets and
 staging demonstrations, but was aided also by several Syrian newspapers
 which have often echoed the Communist line.
 The party has more freedom in Lebanon, where Communist printing
 facilities operate with only occasional obstruction from the Lebanese
 security forces.  Beirut is the regional headquarters for Communist
 propaganda, and Communist literature printed locally and abroad is
 disseminated to other countries uncensored by the Lebanese authorities.
 V.  C04MUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 The manipulative labor strength of the Lebanese Communist Party
 is exceedingly small and is concentrated in essentially non-strategic
 labor organizations. In the Lebanese "Federation of Labor Unions", an
 unincorporated body of some 19 unions headed by the prominent Communist
 Mustapha 'Aris, only about 300 workers of the total 10,000 membership are
 estimated to be Communist Party members.  Only the independent Lebanese Hotel
 Cafes, and Restaurant Workers Union (approximately 800 members) is
 Communist-dominated.
 The Conzress  of Syrian Workers is the oldest and the major
 Communist front organization among Syrian labor, having been formed under
 Communist auspices in 1945.  This clandestine organization, which'claimed
 a membership of 17,250 (probably greatly exaggerated) in 1950, is
 affiliated with the WFTU.
 The Congress has not been successful owing to poor discipline and
 to opposition from both labor and government.  On the propaganda front,
 it has not been nearly as active or as effective as the "peace" groups.
 In December 1951, in conjunction with the Republican Student's Party,
 it unsuccessfully attempted to stir up a public protest against the
 repression of student groups in Barcelona and.the jailing of pro-
 Communist individuals in Greece.
 Key Communist labor organizers from Lebanon (Sa'd ad-Din Mu'minah,
 liaison man between the Syrian and Lebanese Communist labor movements),
 Jordan (Muhammad Qasim) and Syria (Ibrahim Bakri) and Iraq (Muhammad
 Fallah) were reported to have attended a congress in Damascus in

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 January 1952 over which Bakri presided.  The following items were said
 to have been on the agenda:  (1) the formation of a regional union of
 Near Eastern workers; (2) propaganda work within the unions; (3) bettering
 the economic condition of the workers; and (4) propaganda against  the
 Western powers.
 The Society for the Salvation of the Worker.  This Syrian group,
 with a current total membership of about 150, established itself in the
 fall of 1950 in the town of Masyaf, in the Alawite area.  Generally it
 has been ineffectual in organizing labor groups in this region.  Communist
 labor agitation occurs from time to time in Aleppo and Latakia but as yet
 has not reached serious proportions.
 According to available data, only two independent Syrian unions
 are under Communist control:  the Mechanical Loom Operators' Union of
 Aleppo (membership unknown) and the Mechanics' Union of Damascus (187
 members). There are no unions or guilds in Syria which can be classified
 as strategic.
 VI.  CON1UEIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL. CULTURAL AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 There are six main categories of front organizations in both Syria
 and Lebanon:  women's organizations, intellectuals' organizations, youth
 groups, student groups, labor groups, and religious groups.  In all of
 these, the main propaganda theme is "peace".
 A.  Syria
 1.      The Partisans of Peace movement was built up around an inner core
 of Communists and dependable fellow-travelers who planned recruitment of
 members and formulated operations and propaganda programs.  All of the
 members of the original Syrian National Committee of the Partisans of
 Peace were prominent members of the Communist Party in Syria.  They formed
 the core of the expanded National Committee of 12 as it existed in 1951.
 By December 1951, branches had been established in all parts of Syria
 except Jebel Druze, and the National Committee had managed to penetrate
 the Surety Generale, the Deuxi6me Bureau, most of the government ministries,
 and a number of the political parties in Syria.  No figures are available
 on the total membership.  Financing appears to have been handled locally.
 2.  Women's Organizations have been established mainly by Communist
 member Miss Falak Tarazi, a lawyer by education.  The daughter of the
 late Nuhanmad 'Ali al-'Abid, one-time President of Syria from June 1932
 to December 1936, she is a protege of Mrs. Zahra' al-'Abid, president of
 the non-Communist Syrian League of Women's Clubs. Most of the members
 of the women's groups  listed below are from the minority communities .
 None of these organizations is large or influential and membership on
 these groups probably overlaps to a considerable degree.

 a.  The League of Syrian Nationalist Women for the Defense of
 Peace is believed to have been organized by Miss Tarazi and Wisal Farhat
 Mrs. Khalid Bakdash) in September 1949.  Little has been heard of its
 activities.
 b.  The-League of Syrian Women for the Protection of Motherhood
 and Childhood has been the most active of all women's front organizations.
 Membership is drawn primarily from Kurdish, Greek Orthodox, and other
 minority elements.  They have on a number of occasions called at the US
 and other Legations in Damascus to deliver their messages,
 c.  The-Women's Section of the Democratic Youth Organization.
 The women's section had about 100 members in December 1950.  Activities
 of this group centered at Qamishliyah in the Jazirah (the Kurdish-
 Assyrian center).
 d.  The League of Democratic Women as of May 1951 had a membership
 of about 150 in Syria?  Headquarters were in Damascus at the home of
 Aminah 'Aril, wife of Najah Qassab Hasan of the Communist Party's
 Damascus Regional Committee.  Most of the members appear to be from
 Christian and Kurdish minority elements.  Activities centered on organ-
 izing-female students in support of peace and on spreading pro-Soviet
 propaganda in general.
 e.  The League for Women's Rights.        Little is known about its
 membership.
 3.  Student Organizations are believed to be confined to male students,
 in conformity with the general custom of segregation of the sexes followed
 in Near Eastern.countries, notwithstanding the contrary aims of other
 Communist front groups.
 a.  The Student Youth Movement in Syria and Lebanon was headed
 by Wasfi al-Bunni of Homs and Ridwan al-Shahhal of Tripoli, both very
 active Communists.  Bunni has recently been arrested in Syria and if his
 claim of Soviet nationality is upheld he will be deported to the USSR.
 b.  The League of Democratic Students reportedly has a large
 membership.  The leaders were reported to be five Syrian University
 students, one of whom, M,iharmad Amin, is the brother of the leader of the
 Partisans of Peace in Syria.  The activities of this group are centered
 in the Syrian University and in the Third Tajhiz (government secondary
 school) in Damascus.
 c.  Gob Sonen Hawi was founded in 1943 after the Kurdish Congress
 in Erivan as a Kurdish student organization.

 4.   Youth Organizations
 a.  The League of Democratic Youth actively participated in
 intensified front organization "peace" and "neutrality" propaganda
 in Damascus.   Membership is largely from the minority elements.
 b.  Heina, a Kurdish youth organization, was represented at.
 the Berlin Youth Festival.   It is reported to have begun to form
 branches in Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria.
 5.     Organizations of Intellectuals,
 a.  The Lea  a of    ian Writers, a group of Communists and
 fellow-travelers headed    Ilya Dayrani, a member of the Greek Orthodox
 Community in Syria.  He is reported to be a Communist and a teacher
 employed in the primary school section of the Ministry of Public
 Instruction.  In May 1952, membership was composed of about 25 writers.
 Two of these were considered Communists and the rest fellow-travelers.
 The activity of this group consisted mainly. in contributing to the
 press articles of topical interest to the Communist propaganda efforts.
 Translations were made of various Russian authors such as Gorki and
 Tolstoy to which prefaces containing "peace" propaganda were added.
 b.  The League of Democratic Lawyers was reported to consist
 mainly of students at the law school of the Syrian nly                                                  University.  In
 May 1951 it was thought to have 35 adherents.  Nassuh al-Ghaffari, a
 well-known lawyer and Communist Party leader, is probably closely
 connected with this group.  Some adherents are in the Aleppo area*
 c.  The League of Democratic Teachers':membership has been
 estimated a     or 60, consisting mostly of young (male) teachers.
 Kamal 'Ayyad and Jamil Salibah, its leaders, were prominent in Syrian
 educational circles.
 6.  Religious Organizations
 A Moslem branch of the Partisans of Peace movement in Syria
 was reportedly formed in February 1951.
 B.  Lebanon
 Front organizations in Lebanon follow the same general pattern
 as those in Syria.  As in Syria, the Partisans of Peace is an active
 front group.  The League of Democratic Women is in contact with the
 Syrian League for the Protection of Motherhood and Childhood.  The
 League of Democratic Students., and        ague of Democratic Lawyers.

 also have branches in Lebanon.  The Congress of Homeless Palestinians,
 organized in 1949, is directed by Communist sympathizers in contact
 with the Beirut Regional Committee of the Syro-Lebanese Communist
 Party.  It has branches at six refugee camps and at the American
 University of Beirut.  Firm action by University officials is be-
 lieved to have greatly diminished Communist activity among the students.
 The ruling that demonstrations cannot be held on University grounds
 has proved a deterrent to Communist activity among American University
 students.
 "Zareh Nubar," a pro-Communist Armenian literary club was
 recently formed in Beirut for the propagation of literature on Soviet
 Armenia.  Affiliated clubs are to be opened in Damascus and Aleppo,
 Syria.
 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 Recent reports indicate that both the Syrian and Lebanese
 Communist Parties have managed to place a number of their members
 and sympathizers in the more sensitive agencies of the Syrian and
 Lebanese Governments.  Thus, for example, the Syrian Army's Deuxijae
 Bureau and Police Security department are known to have been penetrated
 by-several Communists who are currently supplying information to
 local Communist regional committees concerning anticipated repressive
 measures to be undertaken by the military and security forces against
 the Syrian Communist Party.

 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 Communist penetration of the Syrian and Lebanese school system
 is reported to have reached significant proportions.  Communist activity
 at present consists not so much of establishing Communist groups 'per se
 among students or penetrating their existing organizations as in organ-
 izing them into front groups.  These groups exist not only in the Syrian
 University in Damascus but also in its engineering school in Aleppo, in
 the government secondary schools (particularly in Aleppo), and in schools
 conducted by the. various religious communities in both countries
 (particularly the Greek Orthodox and Armenian communities).  The teaching
 profession has been penetrated primarily at the university and government
 secondary school level, especially in Syria.  The dean of the Syrian
 University is said to be a Communist and there are several professors
 who may possibly be members.  A number of Palestine Arab refugee teachers,
 employed by the Syrian Ministry of Public Instruction, have been dis-
 missed for "Communist tendencies."  The only front organization aimed
 specifically at the teaching profession appears to be the League of
 Democratic Teachers.
 Moreover, the government's official radio station in Damascus is
 reported to be heavily penetrated by Communist Party members and fellow
 travellers who have managed to secure relatively important administrative
 and operational positions.
 IX. COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 Communist penetration of other Syrian political organizations,
 such as the Arab Socialist and Resurrectionist Parties, was reported
 to be quite extensive prior to the promulgation of a Shishakli-inspired
 decree in April 1952 outlawing all Syrian political associations and
 parties.  The leaders of these parties were subsequently forced to flee
 Syria after an abortive plot against the existing regime was uncovered.
 Cells of a paramilitary character have reportedly been formed by the
 neo-fascist Islamic Socialist Front in Aleppo.  This group, an offspring
 of the Ikhwan (Moslem Brethren) movement probably would not be adverse
 to accepting Communist tactical support in subverting the present regime.
 The Syrian Communist Party has also established some liaison with the
 clergy of the Greek Orthodox Church and the Gregorian Armenian community,
 groups which maintain some influence with their own parochial political
 organizations.
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 Beirut serves as the geographic focal point for the distribution
 of Communist propaganda material in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq.
 From Beirut, the clandestine party organs Nidal ash-Sha'b, As-Salem,

 - 13 -
 and al-Yanbu (Partisans of Peace publications which are currently
 proscribed in Syria), and AlTaria are distributed to many of these
 areas.  Most of these papers suffer froi insolvency and local governmental
 suppression.   Consequently, they appear only sporadically.
 Before its suppression early in 1951, the weekly organ Al-Sa
 was said to have printed 4,000 copies per issue, but the proportion of
 copies sold to those distributed free is not known.  It may be signifi-
 cant that, unlike other Syrian newspapers, most issues of   -SaYam do
 not have the price indicated on it.  The paper was printed.at the Matba 'at
 Dimashq (Damascus Press) in Damascus.
 At-Tana is the monthly magazine published in Beirut by Antun
 Tabit, head of the Partisans of Peace organization in Lebanon and possibly
 also in Syria, where the magazine until,; recently circulated as well.
 Nidal ash-Sha'b is a clandestine Syrian and Lebanese Communist
 Party newspaper, probably printed in Beirut, which began to appear after
 the closing of the party's paper Sawt ash-Aha'b in December 1947.
 Vidal ash-Sha'b is published by a "Joint body.of the Syrian and Lebanese
 Communist Parties," which Bakdash heads.
 Prior to the general-emalgatation'of the press instigated by the
 Shishakli regime in Septenbe, 1952, there were seven Syrian newspapers
 which at times gave evidence :'of Communist influence.  Many of these were
 political party organs which, like other Syrian papers, had a small cir-
 culation (not over 2,000 copies for each issue) and were financially
 insolvent.  These papers were:  n-Nasr, a Damascus daily; Al-Ishtirakiyah,
 a Damascus weekly; Al-Hurrivah, a daily published in Aleppo; Al-Manar,
 of Damascus; A1-Hadarah, a Damascus daily; Al-Hawadith, an Aleppo daily;
 and Sada al-Ittihad, a Latakia daily.
 The Soviet campaign to subvert the Syrian press appears to date
 from the beginning of 1948, following the suppression in December 1947
 of the Beirut-published cwt ash-Sha.'b (Voice of the People), organ of
 the Syrian and Lebanese Communist Parties.  Soon after this event, Soviet
 funds formerly allocated to this paper seem to have been diverted to
 (1) supporting the clandestine Nidal ash-Sha % and pamphlets, and (2)
 subsidizing and bribing of the editors and staff of existing newspapers.
 A number of editors are reported to have been offered newsprint and/or
 cash to adopt the Soviet line.  The seven above-listed newspapers appear
 to have succumbed to Communist blandishments.
 Book publishing and distribution are now carried on from Beirut.
 Some of the Beirut publications have recently turned up in England
 and probably are circulating in Syria too.   One volume which is
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION '
 known to have been issued recently in Beirut is a tome by Vladimir
 Pozner (member of the French Communist Party and ex-Hollywood screen
 writer) called USA - The Land of Fictitious Liberties, translated into
 Arabic by 'Abdallah Sha'ito.
 No Russian-language publications are known to circulate in Syria.
 Apart from the Soviet orbit, Paris is an important source of Communist
 propaganda material.  The Al-Yaqazah publishing house in Damascus prints
 and distributes books translated from Russian into Arabic by the "League
 of Syrian Writers."  Distribution points for Communist literature include
 the Gloria Bookshop in Beirut (owned and operated by Haygazun Najarian).
 On sale at this shop is the official journal of the Cominform, printed
 in Arabic, as well as The USSR in Construction, a propaganda tract from
 Moscow, printed in French and English.  The house of Aram Yeretizian, an
 Armenian Communist who lives in the Noshajian area of the Armenian quarter
 of Beirut, is the main center for all Communist pamphlet distribution among
 the Beirut Armenians.
 The Syrian Broadcasting. Station in Damascus on occasion broadcasts
 materials, particularly in news commentaries, which parallels the Communist
 propaganda line.  The direction of the station has in the past been in-
 filtratecl by leftist, if not actually Communist, personnel at a high level.
 Ahmad ad-'Assih, a left-wing member of the Populist Party was director of
 the station for a time in 1949 and since late 1951 has been Acting Director;
 Kamal 'Ayyad, director in May 1951, was a leader of the front organization
 called the League of Democratic Teachers and was a suspected Communist.
 Najati Kassab Hasan, a Communist leader in Damascus, has assumed a position
 of importance in local newspaper and radio circles.  He is regularly pub-
 lishing articles in the Damascus newspaper al-Nagaad and recently has
 begun broadcasting over the Syrian Broadcasting System.
 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 Few Communists in Syria and Lebanon pay regular dues, and the
 party depends largely upon contributions from wealthier members.  Some
 of the contributions go toward party operations, most of the money being
 used for Partisans of Peace campaigns and special causes for which appeal
 is made locally.  It is thought that funds are also regularly received
 from various outside sources, through the Soviet Legation, or in the form
 of presents from Communist groups abroad.  Thus, for example, while no
 Syrian publications are financed directly by the Soviet Union, cash sub-
 sidies disguised'as payments for advertising space or bulk purchases of
 particular issues are made by the Soviet press attache or by the TASS
 Agency representative to these papers when they publish TASS articles.
 This indirect form of subsidy avoids compromising the newspaper proprietor,
 who frequently has little control over editorial policy, and the trans-
 action is arranged privately between the editor and the Soviet press or
 TASS  representative.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Syrian Communist Party finances do not appear- to be on a budget
 system, but are dispensed according to monthly commitments and resources.
 Party dues and contributions from non-Communist friends seem to be per-
 sonally disbursed by party leader Bakdash.  However, the increased vigi-
 lance of the security forces of the present anti-Communist Syrian Govern-
 ment has severely hampered the fund-raising activities of the Communist
 Party in Syria.
 XII.  SOVIET OFFICIAL ASSETS
 The Soviet Legation in Beirut may be acting in part as the dis-
 tributing center for Cominform material for Syria and Lebanon.- Its
 activities in the propaganda field are both overt and covert; the latter
 seem to be under the direction of Feodor Bespalov, Second Secretary of
 the Soviet Legation.  The Soviet Legation in Damascus appears to occupy a
 secondary position in this respect.
 The only two overt Soviet propaganda agencies in Syria are VOKS
 and TASS.  Although VOKS has an active center in Beirut, in Damascus it
 seems to do very little in the way of overt work and appears to serve
 mainly as a cover for the covert activities of the Second Secretary of
 the Soviet Legation (Feodor.Pisarenko), which consist of (1) guiding the
 propaganda and other activities of the local Communist Party into con-
 formance with the party. line of international Communism, and (2)
 collecting intelligence information.
 TASS activities, until the recent Syrian Government clamp-down on
 the press and on foreign information activities, appear to have had three
 main aspects:  (1) the distribution of TASS news and Soviet.Press Infor-
 mation bulletins issued by the Press Section of the Soviet Legation in
 Beirut; (2) the influencing of Syrian newspapers with cash or newsprint
 to print Soviet-produced or inspired items and otherwise adopt a line.
 favorable to the USSR; and (3) the transmission to.the USSR of local
 press items, frequently planted, for propaganda use by the Soviet and
 satellite press, radio, etc.  In addition to being disseminated to the
 press through regular TASS channels, TABS and Soviet Press Information
 bulletins have been reported as having been distributed clandestinely
 by hand following the ban imposed by the Syrian Government on all foreign
 publications of this nature.  The A1-Yagaza1c book shop iri D7i ascus, the
 largest publishing house in Syria, is subsidized by the Soviet Legation.
 XIII.  COi?'Q4UNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 Nearly all Communist front movements in Syria and Lebanon are
 geared today to the theme of "peace".  Responsibilit  for organizing groups
 in these two countries (and the Near Fast as a whole) was delegated to
 Khalid Bakdash and to a Middle East regional office of the World Peace
 Council, which was established in Beirut about May 1951.  This office
 formed a Lebanese National Committee for a Conference of Peoples of the

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Near and Middle East and North Africa which about December 1951 issued
 a proclamation calling for the convening of such a conference to combat
 Western inspired mutual security moves.  No such meeting, however, ever
 took place.
 Six Lebanese delegates attended the Berlin Youth Festival held in
 July 1951.  They were:  Victor Mughabghad, Kamil Mohammad Tawfiq al-Harb,
 Robert Vahan Garabedian, Khalil 'Ali, Philippe Iskandar al-Rasi, and
 Ilyas Musa Fahad.  All of these returning delegates were subsequently held
 for trial by the Lebanese Surete' Ggn;&rale.
 Despite an official Lebanese security board decision not to approve
 passports of any Lebanese intending to participate in the Moscow Economic
 Conference of April 1952, a hitherto little-known Lebanese, Hussayn
 Sij'han, was able to attend by travelling via Egypt and Czechoslovakia.
 Upon his return to Beirut,Sijthan was eminently successful in acquiring
 audiences among the businessmen of the community to listen to his glowing
 praise of life in the Soviet Union.
 The leader of the Partisans of Peace in Lebanon, Antun Tabit,
 presented a report to a session of the International Peace. Council which
 met in Berlin in July 1952.  It dealt with the "Struggle of the Middle
 Eastern people for peace and against war."
 Khalid Bakdash was accompanied by Mustafa al-tAris, Farajallah
 al-Hilu, Wasfi Bunni, Artin Madoyan, and Ohannes Aghabashian to the 19th
 Communist Party Congress, which convened in Moscow in October 1952.  At
 this meeting Bakdash personally addressed the October 11 session and
 promised that "we, the Communists of Syria and Lebanon will do our best to'
 be worthy of the great honor of being called Stalints disciples."
 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 The Soviet Legation in Beirut is the distributing center for
 Cominform and front organizations material for Syria and Lebanon.  Beirut
 is the nodal point of Communist propaganda in Syria as well as Lebanon,
 Iraq, and Jordan.  Khalid Bakdash and other highly-placed members of the
 Communist Party hierarchy, such as officials of the central command and
 the principal Partisans of Peace organizers, are in close contact with
 the Soviet Legations in Damascus and Beirut.'  From the central command
 of the Syro-Lebanese Communist Party, printed propaganda and directives
 are handed down to the Regional Committees.  Instructions are sometimes
 delivered directly to representatives of district committees by the
 central committee, thus by-passing the regional committees.  It is believed
 that theArmenian section of the party has its own lines for channeling
 directives and propaganda.

 The Aleppo regional cormiittee is-said to have 20 shock groups
 (terrorist squads), having no fixed headquarters, whose personnel is known
 only to the Regional Committee.  The personnel of these groups is also

 are received direct from the Soviet Legation.  Subversive printed matter
 is said to be given out by the Soviet Legation in Beirut for smuggling
 into Turkey via the Kurdish areas of north Syria. .

 FOREWORD
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to. achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN TUNISIA:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I .  OBJECTIVES
 The over-riding immediate goal of the Tunisian Communist Party
 has been to persuade the local independence movements to join with
 the Communists in a united national front in preparation ultimately
 for a revolution for "national liberation" and against French control
 and American imperialism.  In the meantime, as in the rest of French
 North Africa, the Communists are seeking, through propaganda, to destroy
 sympathy for the US and the UN, to foster suspicion of Western defense
 plans and to increase local hostility toward the French administration.
 The serious economic grievances of the population also receive
 attention from the Communists.  To achieve its immediate goals, however,
 the Tunisian Communist Party is faced above all with the task of
 reversing the steady trend toward decline in its membership and
 influence.
 II. TACTICS
 Having 'failed thus far in achieving a common front with the
 nationalists, the Communists have attempted instead to participate,
 uninvited, in strikes, demonstrations and riots initiated by the
 nationalists, encouraging any tendency toward violence.  Similarly,
 Communist propaganda pamphlets have dealt at times entirely with
 nationalist grievances and aspirations without placing them in a
 Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist framework.  Thus, in pretending to make the
 nationalist cause their own, the Communists try to impress upon the
 popular mind the need and desirability of a common front.  Occasionally,
 such tactics are accompanied by attacks on the nationalist leadership
 for their refusal to join them in a united national front, for
 demonstrating faith in the US or the UN, or for cooperating or conducting
 negotiations with the French.  Moreover, Communists have been known to
 facilitate the arrest of nationalists and to have claimed credit for
 successful nationalist demonstrations.
 III. C   BILITIES
 To date, the small Tunisian Communist Party has had practi-
 cally no influence on the nationalist movement, largely because (1) the
 nationalists realize that such ties would alienate many. sympathizers
 in non-Communist areas, (2) the local Communist parties are largely
 French in membership, and (3) the present nationalist leadership is
 aware of the opportunistic nature of Communism and the devotion of
 Communism to a foreign power whose domination the nationalists would
 dislike as much as they do that of the French.
 The capabilities of the Tunisian Communist Party at this time
 remain minimal, either for achieving its own current local objectives

 or for furthering Soviet policy.  It has always been evidenced by the
 notable failure of its efforts to persuade the nationalists ---
 especially the principal nationalist party, the Neo-Destour, and the
 labor federation allied to it - to form a united national front with
 the Communists.    The Communist  labor federation,  USTT (Union    .
 Syndicale des Travailleurs de Tunisie) has been unable to penetrate
 the nationalist UGTT (Union G(ner'ale Tunisienne du Travail) to any
 appreciable degree.  Moreover, the USTT has been completely outmaneuvered
 by the nationalists whose rival union has steadily gained in membership
 and influence at the expense of the Communists.  There is little
 likelihood of an early improvement in the caliber of Communist leadership
 in the party or its labor federation.
 The French Government throughout 1952 has been increasingly firm
 in its repression of the Tunisian Communist Party.  Some of the non-
 Tunisian leaders have been deported, and virtually all of the others
 are being held under arrest.  Both of its newspapers are suspended,
 and a clandestinely printed substitute for its proscribed French-
 language weekly, plus occasional mimeographed pamphlets and leaflets,
 ,represent the maximum of its apparent propaganda capabilities at this
 time.  The Communist labor federation maintains its strongest position
 in port, mining, electrical communications, and railway but it lacks
 the strength to produce a complete tie up by strikes in even a single
 industry without the assistance of at least one or more of. the other
 three Tunisian labor federations.
 The effective leadership of the Tunisian Communist Party and
 almost all of the hard-core has always been European.  With the
 membership estimated now at not more than 4,000, this probably still
 remains true.
 If the effectiveness of its leadership were not at such a low
 point, the Communist potentials in Tunisia, even given the present
 membership, might present a totally different picture. During the
 past year, a political atmosphere has developed in which an astute
 Communist leadership might find more fertile ground than at any time
 since the end of World War II.  This situation is the outgrowth of a
 combination of factors, including (1) severe French repressive actions
 against the nationalists, (2) the exile or arrest of the principal
 Neo-Destour party and union leaders, (3) the death of the able,
 influential labor chief, Ferhat Hached, (4) the total lack of Neo-
 Destour progress in achieving nationalist aims during the past two
 years, and'.(5).the greater inclination of Tunisian nationalists to
 accept aggressive tactics  as evidenced by increasing riots and
 sabotage.  However, the Tunisian Communist Party appears at this time
 to be too impoverished financially and too feeble in membership,

 organization, leadership, and influence to capitalize on the
 opportunity presented by nationalist frustrations and the temporary
 dislocations among the relatively moderate, anti-Communist, and
 experienced top Neo-4)estour leadership.
 The Communists will probably continue their efforts to join forces
 with the nationalists.  In the longer run, there remains some danger
 that should the nationalists fail to achieve their objectives they would
 accept Communist support rather than look to the West. While it
 presently remains doubtful that the Communists will capture control of
 the nationalist movement in Tunisia, Communist influence might ultimately
 induce the nationalist groups to adopt more anti-Western policies and
 more frequently to resort to direct action.

 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 Exact figures on the membership of the Tunisian Communist Party
 are not available.    But from what is known of the party and the scope of
 its activities, a maximum estimate would be 3,000 members.  There are,
 in addition, probably a thousand or so "fellow travelers."  It may,
 therefore, be concluded in the light of these estimates, that the
 Communists control only about one-tenth of one percent of the total
 population of the country.  Because of the relative weakness of the
 Co-!imunists, it is difficult to estimate their geographical distribution.
 It is, however, safe to assume that they possess cells in most, if not
 all, of the principal cities.  Information regarding Communist strength
 in the countryside is not available.  Information is also lacking with
 regard to the proportion of Communist "militants" within the party
 ranks.  The relatively limited scope of Communist agitation would,
 however, indicate that the number of party "militants" is very likely
 less than one thousand.  Leadership of the party, in contrast to that
 of the nationalists, has not been outstanding.
 II. ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 No popular elections have ever been held in Tunisia.  In local
 elections, only a restricted number of natives can vote. Hence it is
 not possible to form any reliable estimate of the proportion of the
 local population which might be induced to vote Communist.
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 Although there have been many violent demonstrations and acts of
 sabotage in Tunisia during the past two years, some may but none are
 known to have been initiated by the Communists.  Political violence of
 this type has usually been traceable directly to the Tunisian nationalists;
 however, the Communists regard an increase in tension between the
 nationalists and the French as favorable to their own interests.  For this
 reason, it is possible that Communist agitators have helped to provoke
 incidents leading to violence.  If this has been the case, however, they
 have been careful to remain in the background.  In the light of present
 information, it appears that the Tunisian Communist Party, because of its
 lack of popular support, is unable to rally sizable elements of the
 population to violent action except insofar as it can capitalize upon
 nationalist sentiment aroused by other groups.

 IV.                                     GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 The Tunisian Communist Party was recognized as a legal political
 party in 1943, and was permitted to operate with relative freedom for
 some years thereafter.  But during the past two or three. years the French
 authorities have steadily restricted its activities.  During the riots
 of early 1952, several Communist leaders were arrested, and some are still
 under detention.  After the murder of the prominent Tunisian labor leader
 Ferhat Hached in December 1952, additional Communist leaders were arrested,
 and Communist publications were suspended.  Today, Communist meetings and
 demonstrations are prohibited, and foreign Communist newspapers are banned.
 No information is available concerning t_he present underground activities
 of the Tunisian Communists.
 V.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR
 The number of Communists in key industries is not known.  For
 several years the Communists have controlled one of four labor federations
 the Union Syndicate des Travailleurs de Tunisia (USTT).  In 1948 the
 strength of this organization was estimated by the French authorities at
 between 25,000 and 26,000 members.  But the USTT is known to have since,
 lost a great many of its members to the. nationalist unions and to other
 labor groups.  The exact extent of its numerical decline, though
 considerable, is not known.
 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 After World War II, the Communists in Tunisia followed their usual
 practice of establishing organizations with seemingly nonpolitical ob-
 jectives.  These groups included -- in addition to labor unions -- youth
 groups, cultural societies, peace groups, women's organizations and social
 service groups.  But these organizations did not flourish, and today the
 few that remain are relatively inactive.  Now that the French authorities
 have undertaken rigorously to curtail Communist activity in Tunisia, the
 membership and activities of such "front" groups may be expected to decline
 still further.
 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 No information is available concerning the number of Communists
 and Communist sympathizers at the higher levels of the government, including
 the armed forces.  Undoubtedly, however, the number is quite small, for
 the French policy is to remove such persons whenever found.  Figures are
 likewise lacking with regard to the number of Communists and sympathizers
 in those agencies of government administering nationalized industries.  It
 appears likely, however, that Communists occupy some low-level jobs in
 ports, railroads, telegraph and telephone installations, and mining
 operations.

 VIII.  COT01UNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 The publication of Communist newspapers has been suspended
 indefinitely by the French authorities in Tunisia.  Inasmuch as radio
 broadcasting is government-controlled, the Communists exert no influence
 through that medium.  There is no indication that Communists have infil-
 trated religious organizations in Tunisia.  Though some Communist school
 teachers have been reported, they are not thought to be numerous.
 IX.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 No information is available concerning Communist penetration of
 non-Communist political parties in Tunisia. Repeated Communist attempts
 to forra a coalition with the Neo-Destour, the principal nationalist party,
 have been rebuffed in terms so strong as to indicate that Communist in-
 fluence in the leading circles of that party is negligible.  Some leaders
 in the Old-Destour Party, one of the smaller nationalist groups, have at
 times collaborated in specific Communist-front activities.
 X.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 Prior to their suspension in March 1952, Tunisia's two Communist
 weeklies had a total circulation of about 6,000 copies, a considerable
 number of which were given away each week.  The indefinite suspension, by
 the French authorities, of all Tunisian Communist publications and the
 ban on foreign Communist literature, have reduced Communist printed
 propaganda to illicit handbills, which appear only occasionally. .
 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 Specific information regarding the financial resources of the
 Tunisian Communist Party is not available.  Evidence exists that the
 Tunisian Communist Party has upon occasion received financial aid from
 the French Communist Party.  Such aid, however, has apparently been
 relatively small, for it has not saved the Tunisian Party from continual
 financial embarrassment.
 XII.  SOVIET SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS
 Neither the Soviet Union nor any of its satellites have diplomatic,
 commercial, or cultural missions in Tunisia.
 XIII.  COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 None of the front groups affiliated with Communist international
 organizations are at this time active in Tunisia.  Nor have any congresses
 of Communist organizations been held in Tunisia in recent years.  Certain

 Tunisian Communist leaders have, however, attended conferences of
 Communist-sponsored organizations in other countries.  Information is
 incomplete, but Tunisian Communists are known to have attended such
 meetings in the Soviet Union, Red China, Poland, and Italy since 1950.
 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATION NETWORK
 It is known that the Tunisian Communist Party, like the Communist
 parties of Algeria and Morocco, is directed by the French Communist Party,
 and that representatives of the French Party attend meetings of the
 Tunisian Party and transmit advice and instructions at that time.  Though
 Communist international couriers are occasionally reported to pass through
 North Africa, detailed information is not available on the subject.

 FOREWORD
 C
 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis. of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information.
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 Ca4MUNISS'i IN FRANCE:  OBJECTIVES, TACTICS, AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 The French Communist Party's immediate objective, and the one
 which promises to remain foremost for the duration of the cold war,
 is the establishment of a government in Paris which would break off
 France's alliance with the West.  Short of this major goal, the
 Communists are chiefly interested in hampering specific pro-Western
 policies of the present anti-Communist French Government.  Among these
 policies, the key ones are those of waging war on the Communists in
 Indochina and of participating in NATO and related plans for rearming
 Western Germany, especially the EDC., Accordingly, the Communists-are
 intent on securing immediate peace in Indochina on Ho Chi Ninh's termsp
 withdrawal of US forces from NATO bases in France, progressive reduc-
 tion in armaments, and rejection of any arrangement for rearming
 Western Germany.  Always accompanying these specific goals  are the
 Communists' various efforts to create a general frame of mind which
 is suspicious. of the US, dubious of self-defense efforts, and scepti-
 cal of the strength and viability of the West as a whole.                                Realizing,
 in brief, the' difficulties involved in making French opinion pro-
 Soviet, the Communists currently set their sights on encouraging
 neutralist and defeatist tendencies.
 There is no doubt that these Communist objectives are geared
 primarily to the furthering of Soviet foreign policy and impair the
 party's ability to promote its own popularity.  The conditions under
 which the French Communists adopted their stand on the Indochina war
 is instructive in this connection.  For some months after hostilities
 broke out in Indochina, in December 1946, between the French troops
 and Ho Chi Minh, the Communists, who were then participating in the
 cabinet, avoided taking an anti-national position on this issue.
 Accordingly, when the government made it clear, in March 1947, that
 it had no intention of opening negotiations with Ho, the Communists
 went along with this policy. It was not until after the Moscow
 Conference had ended the following month, with a break between the
 USSR and the West,; and with  France definitely associating herself
 with the US and Britain, that the Communists parted company with the
 other parties in the government.  In short, the Communists did not
 fashion their stand on Indochina on the basis of local French atti-
 tudes toward the war but, rather, on Soviet foreign policy require-
 ments.
 In the same way, the Communists' handling of the German
 rearmament issue illustrates the fact that their objectives are
 tailored to fit the needs of Soviet foreign policy.. Left to their
 own devices in shaping their policy toward German rearmament, the

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 French Communists would unquestionably oppose all forms of such rearma-
 ment, thus enabling them to take a strong and consistent stand on a
 question which is traditionally of the greatest national concern.
 Instead, however, the party has been obliged, as a result of Soviet
 approval of East German rearmament, to modify its original position of
 thoroughgoing opposition to German rearmament and to distinguish
 between the rearmament of "democratic" East Germany and "imperialist"
 West Germany.
 II.  TACTICS
 In pursuing their major objective, the French Communists' tactics
 are those of the "United National Front."  This means, as the Communists;
 repeatedly point out, that they wish to make common cause with indi-
 viduals from all social groups regardless of their religious or
 political bent, on the basis of a broad program of "peace, national
 independence, and democratic liberties."  In accordance with this policy,
 the Communists have set out to win the support not only of industrial
 workers and peasants, but also of white collar workers, shopkeepers,
 businessmen, and professional people.  In contrast with the French
 Popular Front of the 1930's, the present United National Front is not
 an effort by the Communists to form alliances with entire non-Communist
 political parties and their leaders, but an attempt to attract indi-
 viduals and groups from all political parties and sections of society.
 Moreover, the Communists are not currently seeking, as they did in the
 1930's, to remain in the background but are, instead, clearly announc-
 ing that they intend to remain at the head of the movement they hope to
 develop.
 The Communists' current tactics have been adopted in response to
 the increasingly unfavorable situation in which the French Communist
 Party finds itself.  At present, and for the past five years or so, the
 party, despite its continued hold on about a quarter of the electorate
 and an important part of the trade union movement, has been facing
 increasing difficulties.  This is evident, first of all, in the declining
 numerical strength of the party itself and of its various related organi-
 zatj.ons.  Moreover, the party and its affiliated organizations have
 been increasingly unable to translate the numerical strength they retain
 into political action geared to attainment of their major political ob-
 jectives.  Finally, the non-Communists have become increasingly
 anti-Communist and united in their opposition to the Communists regard-
 less of how much they disagree on other issues.  As a result the
 Communists find themselves so isolated that alliances between themselves
 and non-Communist parties are out of the question.
 In attempting to break out of their isolation, the French
 Communists try to establish a minimum basis of agreement with

 non-Communists by proposing that these latter elements go along with them
 on issues which'involve the practically universal fear of war, the sub-
 sidiary but almost equally important fear of Germany, and the widespread
 dissatisfaction with certain aspects of French society.  Thus the
 Communists' basic appeal is to the sense of international. insecurity, on
 the one hand, and, on the other, to the deep dissatisfaction which has
 long existed -- and. which would exist in the absence. of the Communists --
 with what is widely regarded as the inadequate living standards, the
 inequality, and the generally restrictive nature of present French
 society.  Accordingly, French Communist propaganda within the past year
 has emphasized such motifs as bacteriological warfare, West German
 rearmament, the war in Indochina, the Moscow Economic Conference, and
 various anti-American themes.  At all times the Communists have tried
 to show that-these international causes are inextricably linked with
 pressing domestic problems, such as wages, housing for workers, heavy'
 taxes, and the maintenance of democratic liberties.  These latter
 problems, the Communists assert, can be met only if France unloads
 herself of the burdens placed on her as a result of her membership in
 the Atlantic alliance.
 In making all these appeals, the French Communists have at their
 disposal propaganda mechanisms which still remain large and active,
 despite their decline in size and effectiveness in recent years.  In
 addition, they have an extensive network of front organizations,
 although there is increasing evidence that these organizations are
 steadily growing less important in fact than they may seem on paper.
 They also continue to dominate an important segment of the trade
 union movement, where their current tactic is to make their appeals
 as attractive as possible by couching them in exclusively economic
 terms.  As a logical extension of this tactic the Communists seek to
 encourage unity of action between their own union organization and
 the non-Communist unions.  Finally, as a political party the
 Communists try to play down those domestic issues which divide them
 from non-Communist Frenchmen and to emphasize their alleged champion-
 ship of "peace" and higher living standards for the great majority of
 the country.
 III.  CAPABILITIES
 Broadly speaking, and assuming there is no major change in the
 international situation, the prospect for the next several years is
 that the French Communists will remain incapable of creating a "United
 National Front" so numerically strong and powerful as to force the
 government to take cognizance of it in forming foreign policy.  The
 likelihood is, rather, that the French Communists will remain locked
 up in their present isolation, incapable of affecting government policy
 and continuing gradually to lose their numerical and organizational
 strength and to display an ever increasing lack of dynamism.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 The decline of the French Communist Party in size and influence
 since the end of the war, and particularly since 1947-48, has been very
 considerable.  For these past several years,'moreover, the party has
 displayed an ever increasing lack of dynamism and an inability to
 translate its remaining numerical strength as a political party and
 trade. union movement into political actions.  At no time since the big
 strikes of 1946-48 have the French Communists displayed any capacity
 for rallying considerable non-Communist trade union support.  During
 1952, on the two or three occasions when the Communists made particular
 efforts to give a show of popular strength in the form of mass.demon-
 strations, only the small corps of party militants turned out.
 At the same time, the French Communist Party remains one of the
 world's largest Communist parties outside the Soviet bloc, and it
 promises to do so for some time.  In France itself it is a major politi-
 cal party, an important power in the  French trade union movement, and
 a large and active propaganda machine.  The party derives still further
 significance from the fact that it has had some success, although how
 much it is difficult to estimate, in penetrating the civil service, the
 lower levels of the armed forces, and various sensitive industries and
 communications services.
 The major factor contributing to the Communists' considerable
 staying power as a political party and force in the trade union move-
 ment is the party's ability to express the psychological revolt of
 many Frenchmen against existing social and economic conditions.  The
 great majority of the 5,000,000 Frenchmen who vote Communist unques-
 tionably do so because they regard themselves as underprivileged and
 exploited by other members of society, and because they believe that
 the Communist Party is concerned with ameliorating their lot.  Like-
 wise most of those who belong to the Communist-dominated trade union
 (CGT) do so because they view it as the only trade union organization
 which is strong and effective enough to wrest higher wages from
 employers.  That the Communists, rather than a purely national French
 party, have succeeded in winning a near-monopoly of the strong protest
 sentiment which exists both in French politics and trade unionism is
 due largely to the evolution of the Socialists.  While retaining their
 revolutionary vocabulary and traditions, the Socialists have long
 since become reformist in outlook and receive their chief support from
 government and other white collar workers rather than industrial labor.
 Under these conditions the Communists have become the heirs to the
 tradition of the extreme left, always an important tradition in French
 politics, and over the years they have succeeded in developing the
 conviction on the part of the majority of their supporters that they and they alone -- hold out the promise of "democratic" social and
 economic reforms.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORI':ATION
 In more specific terms the party's outlook, judged both by the
 evidence of its decline and the signs of its staying power, may be
 summarized as follows:
 In terms of party membership some further contraction can
 be-expected.  No drastic reductions are anticipated, however, since the
 more opportunistic members have already been lost by the party and its
 present membership may be assumed to be quite stable.
 Organizationally, it is unlikely that the party will be split
 or seriously hampered by a purge which the Marty-Tiflon affair in the
 second half of 1952 may foreshadow.
 The front organizations may be expected to maintain their paper
 strength, but will be unable to gain non-Communist support for their
 various causes.  The drawing power of the "peace" movement, in particular,
 will remain very limited, primarily because the character of the "peace"
 organization and its propaganda has become increasingly transparent.
 The present volume of Communist propaganda can be expected to
 remain about the same since the party has the financial capacity to
 maintain its propaganda program.  As the public becomes more familiar
 with the Communists' techniques, however, it becomes less receptive
 to their propaganda.  Nevertheless, some of the Communists' slogans
 will unquestionably continue to be picked up by non-Communists and
 used without their Communist labels.
 A continued decline of Communist influence within the Communist-
 led trade union (CGT) can be expected, and the CGT will remain incapable
 of actions threatening the government.  If the CGT were to follow its
 current policy of purely economic emphasis for any length of time its
 outlook might be brighter, but such a development is unlikely.
 The Communist electoral and parliamentary position will remain
 fairly stable.  As already indicated, the Socialists have a limited
 capacity for weaning away Communist voters, and the other non-Communist
 parties have very little such capacity.  moreover, there are as yet no
 indications, despite the decline in the actual number of Communist
 voters, that the percentage of the Communist vote is decreasing.  The
 decrease in the number of Communist voters can be turned into a per-
 centage decline only if the non-Communist parties succeed in maintaining
 their voting strength as the Communists lose theirs, and to date they
 have not done so because of abstentions by their supporters. Nevertheless,
 the non-Communist parties will unquestionably continue to keep the
 Communists in a state of isolation and, in this way, prevent them from
 participating in the formation of national foreign and domestic policies.

 COMMdUNISM IN FRANCE:  ASSETS
 I. NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 Estimated membership of the French Communist Party (FCP), at the
 close of 1952, is about 450,000. It is not known how many persons, out
 of the total population of 40,000,000, are strongly influenced by the
 Communists.  Judging by the votes of that half of the population which
 actually goes to the polls, it would appear that one out of four Frenchmen
 responds to some aspect of Communist activity.
 Geographically, FCP membership is concentrated in half a dozen
 centers:  Paris and its industrial suburbs, the mining area of the north,
 the major port cities (La Pallice, Bordeaux, Marseille, Le Havre, Dunkerque),
 and the manufacturing centers of south-central France (especially Lyons
 and St. Etienne).
 Industrial workers are the preponderant element in FCP membership.
 Shortly after the war the party had a much more diverse class composition,
 but the loss of lower middle class elements since 1947-48 has reestablished
 the heavy predominance of workers in the party.
 Party sympathizers, judging from what groups vote Communist, have
 more varied backgrounds.  According to the poll published last spring by
 Realit6s, a magazine similar to Fortune, the largest groups which vote
 Communist are factory workers (38%) and women who are not employed outside
 the home and who are presumably members of workers' families (22%).  Thus
 40 percent of the Communist voters come from groups other than the industrial
 working class. According to the poll, these groups include agricultural
 workers (8%) and a variety of lower middle class groups -- white collar
 workers, servants, tradesmen, farm operators, civil servants, small bond-
 holders, and retired persons.  Only four percent comes from the liberal
 professions, other intellectual circles, and industrial cadres.  But
 individuals of this type, and particularly the intellectuals are given
 so much publicity by the party that they sometimes seem more numerous
 than they are.
 FCP members are as a whole well disciplined.  Nearly all of the
 party's major leaders are men who accepted the 1939 Nazi-Soviet Pact.
 For a time after the war the party, as a result of its rapid expansion
 during the war and immediately thereafter, included a considerable number
 of members who were imperfectly disciplined.  As this element left the
 party, membership declined from about 850,000 to 450,000 between 1947
 and 1952, with the big drop (from 850,000 to about 600,000) taking place
 between 1947 and 1948.  The present membership appears to represent a
 fairly stable group of convinced Communists who are fully aware of the
 party's anti-national character.  Judging from a Communist Party statement

 SECRET - SECURITY INFOfti6STiOi
 of a year ago, the current annual rate of turnover in FCP membership in
 about 30,000, or approximately seven percent.
 Leadership of the FCP is, generally speaking, competent, with the
 party weeding out less effective leaders from time to time.  The long
 absence of Secretary-General Thorez, who has been under medical treat-
 ment in Moscow since November 1950, however, has left the party without
 strong   d unified leadership at the top.  One result of this situation
 has ap    ntly been that of making personal differences among members of
 inner cir le, such as figured in the Marty-Tillon case, more significant
 than they were formerly.
 While the party's internal differences between the end of the war
 and 195]. ere restricted to its lower echelons and to the fellow-travelling
 fringe, the Marty-Tillon case of 1952 affected the party's high command,
 as Marty was a member of the secretariat and both men belonged to the
 Politburo.  The basic issue in this case appears to have been the extent
 to'which the party should seek the cooperation of non-Communist elements.
 Both Marty and Tillon apparently believed that the French Communists
 should have proceeded on their own to seize power when France was liberated
 in World War II, and since that time they seem to have been strongly out
 of sympathy with the policy of collaborating with "peace partisans" and
 other groups remote from Communist discipline.  At the same time, personal
 rivalries and antipathies undoubtedly played a part in the conflict between
 the two men and other FCP leaders, and it is probable that Thorez'
 absence also helped lay the party open to discord.
 With the party's action against Marty and Tillon still incomplete
 it is not clear whether these two men will be merely the first in a series
 of French Communist leaders who will be disciplined for their impatience
 with current FCP tactics.  It can only be stated that during the past
 year the FCP has shown greater signs of internal dissension than at any
 time since the end of the war and that this dissension seems likely to
 grow as the party gives further evidence of its increasing ineffectiveness.
 There are no current indications, however, of any internal Communist crisis
 capable of disrupting the party or of producing an anti-Stalinist revolt.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 In national elections, the FCP polls about 5,000,000 votes out of
 a total of 19,000,000 votes cast, or slightly more than 25 percent.  This
 vital statistic-on French Communist electoral strength leads to three
 important observations:
 1)  The FPC receives more votes than any other French political
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 party.  It has held this record with remarkable tenacity throughout the
 postwar period, having been edged out of first place in only one (June 1946)
 of the four postwar national elections.  The Communists' position as the
 leading party must be seen, however, in the context of the French multi-
 party system, in which the non-Communist parties are so numerous that it is
 very difficult for any single one of them to become the nation's largest
 party.  Despite the FCP's electoral lead, therefore, it is decidedly in
 the minority as the half dozen parties supporting the present Mayer govern-
 ment represent about 11,000,000 voters, while the Communist voters number
 about 5,000,000.
 2)  Despite its position as the largest party, the FCP has been
 losing votes since the early postwar period, and partial elections held
 since the last national election of June 1951 show that this trend is
 continuing.   That the Communists retain their lead and their percentage
 strength while losing votes is due to the abstention of non-Communist
 voters.   The decline in Communist votes can be turned into a percentage
 decline only if the non-Communist parties succeed, as they have not done
 to-date, in maintaining their voting strength as the Communists lose theirs.
 3)  The FCP has a nationwide following throughout all geographical
 areas of France. Of the 103 electoral districts in the 1951 elections,
 there were only four in which the Communists polled 10 percent of the vote
 or less.  This record for well-distributed support was untouched by any non-
 Communist party.
 At the same time there are certain regions where the Communists
 are particularly strong.  These include Paris and the neighboring regions,
 extending to the industrialized areas on the northern coast; the center
 and southwest; and the Rhone valley and the southeast, including the
 Mediterranean coast.
 The FCP continues to lay heavy emphasis on maintaining and extend-
 ing its-electoral strength, even though the non-Communist parties devise
 various means of preventing the Communists from translating their electoral
 strength into representational strength.  In elections the Communists are
 obliged to run alone since the non-Communist parties are unwilling to form
 electoral alliances with them.
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 Current FCP policy definitely emphasizes non-violent action, but
 this emphasis does not exclude the possibility of demonstrations, riots,
 or strikes should the party believe that such actions might secure popular
 support or be necessary from the point of view of Soviet foreign policy
 requirements.

 -9-
 The last example of a violent demonstration by the FCP was the
 May 28, 1952 series of anti-Ridgway riots in Paris and some other towns,
 and the flurry of strikes which ensued.  This episode was clearly designed
 to support Soviet propaganda to the effect that Ridgway was as unpopular
 in France as he had been in Japan, where the Communists had led a demonstra-
 tion at the time of his departure.  On the occasion of his arrival in Paris
 the Communists staged demonstrations at several points in the city, and
 equipped rioters with clubs and other crude weapons for their fights with
 the police.  The French police,who promptly cracked down on the rioters
 and arrested a large number of their leaders, have recently estimated that
 about 30,000 persons participated in these demonstrations in Paris and a
 number of provincial towns.  The small size of this figure shows the FCP's
 current inability to rally popular support for violent action against the
 government.
 The FCP organization for planning and executing violent activity
 is believed to be the Service d'ordre, under the direction of the  party's
 Central Committee.  This Service, which is supposed to lead and control
 demonstrations called for by the party, is reportedly a small organization,
 depending for its "troops" on the militants of the party's various federa-
 tions.
 Another source of personnel for party demonstrations and the nucleus
 for any para-military action in the future is the Francs-Tireurs et Partisax
 which stems from the wartime resistance period.  The membership of this grot
 is estimated at something under 50,000, and it is apparently a loosely
 organized body.  Some of its members are persons with resistance experience,
 inasmuch as the Communists played a leading role in the military side of
 the anti-Nazi underground movement.  Others, however, may be presumed to be
 new and untested.  In any case, the spirit of the Francs-Tireurs is reported
 to have been adversely affected by the recent Tillon affair as Tillon was
 formerly the head of this organization.
 No large Communist arms caches have been found in France since the
 war, and it is not likely that any useful supplies of this sort exist.
 It would be contrary to the party's interests to maintain supplies of this
 kind, assuming it could do so effectively, because the discovery of them
 would expose the party to severe official reprisal.  In the event of an
 all-out Communist attack on national defense, it is probable that the party
 would rely primarily on sabotage action by technical experts in strategic
 positions and on the presence of party members in various positions in the
 national economy, rather than on para-military action.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM
 The FCP is a legal political party and as such enjoys freedom of

 - 10 -
 action within the limits of the law.  During the past several years, however,
 and particularly since 1948, the government, without directly attacking the
 FCP as such, has considerably restricted Communist activities through a series
 of practices and restrictions. designed to maintain public order and protect
 national interests.
 Thus the government has transferred known Communists or Communist
 sympathizers from sensitive positions in the armed forces, the civil service,
 and the nationalized industries.  It has frequently banned Communist demonstra-
 tions.                     In Parliament, the practice has developed of referring vital business
 to subcommittees inasmuch as the rule providing for proportional representa-
 tion on committees does not apply to subcommittees.  Special press laws have
 also been enacted with a view to preventing deputies, who enjoy parliamentary
 immunity, from directing newspapers.  Several directors of Communist publica-
 tions have used this protective device in the past.   Moreover, foreign
 Communist publications have been prohibited.
 Despite the increasing stringency of the government's measures against
 the Communists, the party has thus far been inconvenienced rather than
 actually curbed.  Its leadership and major front organizations are still
 virtually intact.  Party members are not formally prohibited from holding
 trade union posts and government positions (including teachers' positions
 filled by the state), and the Communist-led trade union is recognized as a
 collective bargaining agent.  Moreover, persons arrested for disturbing the
 peace in Communist demonstrations are usually given short sentences, and FCP
 leaders are still able to travel to the Soviet Union and to various inter-
 national front organization congresses where Soviet leaders are present.
 In 1952, the government began to fill some of the gaps in its anti-
 Communist program by initiating a series of actions aimed directly at a
 number of top Communist leaders.  To this end the government has requested
 the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of six Communist deputies in order
 to prosecute them, as well as several other FCP and front organization leaders,
 on the charge of attacking the external security of the state.  Parliament
 has not yet lifted the Communist deputies' immunity, however.  Parliament
 has also been requested by the government to consider a bill which would
 provide the government with legal means for dismissing Communists from the
 civil service, but no action has been taken on this proposal either.
 Limits on the French Government's anti-Communist action have existed,
 though to an increasingly less important extent, for three main reasons;
 (1) the very size of the Communist problem, which renders it extremely
 difficult for the government to weed out party members from all positions-
 which might be identified as sensitive; (2) the widespread reluctance,
 especially on the part of the non-Communist left and center parties, to

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 - 11 -
 infringe on the principle of civil liberties lest the type of political
 witch hunt that was carried on by Vichy be repeated; (3) French public
 opinion generally does not attach any special stigma to Communists and
 fellow travellers, and it is still widely believed that a person may vote
 Communist or belong to a Communist-controlled trade union-or other organiza-
 tion without being disloyal.
 V.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE-.IN LABOR
 The number of Communists in France's key industries is unknown.
 Since the members of the Communist-controlled trade union federation
 (Confederation Generale du Travail, CGT) are by no means all Communists,
 as repeatedly indicated by the fact that the Communist leaders of the CGT
 cannot rally union rank-and-file.in behalf of Communist political causes,
 the strength of the CGT in a particular industry provides only a very
 rough and uncertain index to Communist strength in that industry.
 With this important reservation in mind about the CGT as an indicator
 of Communist strength, it may be pointed out that the CGT is stronger than
 any other union in nearly every key industry of France.  This strength
 remains, despite the great decline of the CGT during the past five years,
 in the mines, the railroads, communications, docks and shipyards, and the
 metallurgical industry.  In all these cases, however, correct perspective
 is maintained only if it is borne in mind that only from one-fourth to one-
 half of the total working force is unionized.
 In the realm of organized labor as a whole, the CGT is unquestionably
 the strongest single force and, in fact, stronger than the several non-
 Communist unions together.  CGT membership is currently estimated at
 1,500,000, while most of the remaining 1,000,000 organized workers are
 divided between the Catholic CFTC (about 600,000-700,000 members) and the
 Socialist FO (about 300,000-400,000 members).
 The Communists are able to maintain this lead primarily because the
 CGT is still considered by a large number of French workers as the only
 "real" trade union in-France.  It has behind it a long tradition and
 prestige as a Marxist labor organization -- an important factor in a country
 where labor is strongly class-conscious.  Moreover, when it leaves political
 issues alone and concentrates on economic demands, it still tends to
 function as the strongest and most aggressive champion of labor.
 The non-Communist unions, for their part, have remained weak, and
 unquestionably they have suffered from their widespread reputation of being
 connected with the government.  Neither have the free trade unions found it
 possible to move toward close cooperation.  They continue instead to be
 deeply divided by personal rivalries among their leaders and by the anti-
 clerical issue.

 While the Communists control the largest portion of organized
 labor, they have only succeeded in enrolling a fraction of the total
 number of wage-earners, estimated at 11,000,000.  Thus the CGT is strong
 primarily in the sense that the non-Communist unions are weak and that
 the largest group of French workers is unorganized.  Relatively strong
 though the CGT still is, moreover, it is only one-fourth as large as it
 was in 1946-47, prior to the wholesale defections it suffered as a direct
 result of the political strikes it called in the early stages of the cold
 war.

 VI.                                        COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND
 POMIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 Communist front organizations in France, viewed in berms of their
 number, geographical distribution, and occupational or interest coverage,
 are very extensive.   There are still well over 100 such organizations,
 each with a network of local organizations, and they are geared to the
 interests of a wide variety of groups, notably youth, students and
 teachers, women, nationality minorities, sports enthusiasts, veterans,
 and numerous professional groups.  In addition there are, besides the
 CGT, the Peace Movement and a wide variety of cultural organizations.
 .The actual strength of these front organizations is impossible
 to assess, partly because their memberships overlap and are far from
 stable, and partly because some of the organizations, such as the
 Peace Movement particularly, have very loose rules concerning member-
 ship.  In, any case, most of the fronts now appear to be nothing more
 than paper organizations, and in practically all cases they are so
 dependent on their Communist members that they can be said to have
 almost no strength apart from the Communist Party.
 Of the front organizations the one to which the FCP currently
 gives the most attention and care is the Peace 14ovement.  Its active
 supporters are estimated at 50,000, most of whom are Communists,
 and it has an organization, at least on paper, which covers all of
 France.  The basic units in the organization are the Committees of
 Peace, which are set up either at a place of work or in a neighborhood.
 Strong efforts are made to include non-Communists in these committees,
 but except for a few who accept honorary posts or support occasional
 specific "peace" activities, leadership at all levels is Communist.
 An insight into what lies behind the Peace Movement's nation-
 wide facade was offered in the famous Duclos notebook,. which the police
 seized at the time of his arrest in the anti-Ridgway demonstration
 last May.  According to Duclos, the Peace Movement no longer has any
 effective organization below the regional level.  That the movement
 has been losing strength is also indicated by the decline of its press;
 Before its weekly newspaper, Action, folded up in May (for failure to
 follow the new party line in support of East German rearmament, as
 well as for financial reasons), its circulation had fallen from
 75,000 to 30,000.
 Of all the other fronts, the most important are those for
 women, youth, and various veteran and resistance organizations
 stemming out of the two world wars.  The women's organization

 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 _ 14 -
 (1'Union des Femmes Frangaises) still has local and regional units as
 well as a national office, although many of its local branches are
 reported to engage in little activity.  Most of the work of the organiza-
 tion now appears to be done by women members of the FCP rather than by
 non-Communists, although a considerable number of non-Communist women
 are still willing to sign their names in signature campaigns.
 The major front organization for youth (Union de la Jeunesse
 kepublicaine de France) is important to the FCP both as a training
 group for the party and as the means of injecting a mass element into
 various Communist actions which can be represented as being of particular
 interest to youth.  Thus the youth organization, under the close
 supervision of the FCP itself, concerns itself particularly with .such
 issues as'length of military service and the war in Indochina.
 The various veteran and related organizations are primarily
 concerned with the particular grievances and demands of their members,
 and they make a special effort to secure the participation of non-
 Communists.  Nevertheless, their activities, like those of the other
 front groups, are clearly carried on by Communist members, and
 consequently have no genuine popular character.
 VII.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT
 An over-all view of Communist infiltration into the French
 Government may be given by indicating the extent to which Communists
 are known to be present in various governmental bodies:
 A.  National Government
 1.  The Cabinet.  No Communists have been present in the cabinet
 since they were expelled from the government in May 19147.
 2.  Parliament.  In. the lower house of Parliament (the National
 Assembly), the Communists have 100 seats out of a total of 625, while
 they have 15 seats out of a total of 320 in the consultative upper
 house (the Council of the Republic).
 3.  Civil Service and Nationalized Industries.  In the civil
 service and nationalized industries, the num er of Communists in high-
 level positions is now believed to be negligible, but the number in
 minor positions probably remains sizeable.
 14. The Internal Security Forces.  In the internal security forces,
 Communist Influence is t oug t    be slight.  In the civil police,
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4
 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION.
 - 15 -
 however, there is apparently some infiltration.  During the past year,
 20 members of the Paris police force were suspended and 60 were trans-
 ferred to non-sensitive posts because they were suspected of Communist
 membership or leanings.
 5.  The Armed Forces.  The relatively few Communist officers in the
 armed forces are almost all of junior rank.  No Communist senior officer
 holds a post of command.
 6.  The Atomic Energy Commission.  The French atomic energy commission
 was reorganized in 1951 with a view to eliminating Communist influence.
 Fragmentary reporting indicates, however, that some Communists and
 Communist sympathizers continue to be employed at the lower levels of
 the organization.
 B. Local Government
 In the field of municipal government, the Communists claim
 about 2,000 mayors out of a total of 37,930, and they have about
 30,500 seats out of a total of 166,209 on the municipal councils.  In
 the departmental councils, the Communists have 78 seats out of a
 total of 1,500.
 VIII.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION
 In circles and public institutions important in forming public
 opinion, Communists or Communist sympathizers are unquestionably present,
 but always in a decidedly minor way.  Thus it appears that Communists
 have some influence among primary and secondary school teachers.as a
 result of their presence in the autonomous teachers' union.  There are
 no estimates, however, on how many teachers either belong to the FCP
 or go along with some of its major causes.  There are also some
 Communists on the faculties of the universities, but no estimate of
 their number is available.
 In the Catholic Church there are a few individuals, including
 some "worker priests" and the small group of Christian Progressives,
 whose social philosophy has led them to support the Communists,
 usually on such specific issues as peace and improved working-class
 living conditions.  The abbe'Boulier is, as the most prominent of the
 Christian Progressives, frequently pointed to by the Communists as
 alleged proof of Catholic support for the"peace" movement and related
 causes.  As far as is known, however, there is no considerable number
 of Communist sympathizers among either the parish priests or the higher
 clergy.

 In the programs currently produced by the nationally-owned
 French broadcasting system (Radio Diffusion Fran  ise  RDF) there
 appears to be very little Coimmunis  i   uence.   ter the war RDF
 was heavily infiltrated by the Communists, but since then the govern-
 ment has taken all, or nearly all, pro-Communist broadcasters off the
 air.   An estimated two-thirds of RDF's technicians, however, are
 believed to belong to a Communist-controlled trade union.
 IX.  COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST POLITICAL PARTIES
 No non-Communist parties are believed to have been infiltrated by
 Communists.  On the fringe of the FCP, however, there are two small
 parties, the Union of Progressives and the Unity-Socialist Party.  Both
 of these groups are so obviously appendages of the FCP that they cannot
 be regarded as non-Communist parties which have been infiltrated by
 the Communists.
 R.  COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MEDIA
 The chief propaganda medium for the FOP is the local Communist
 press. A mid-1952 review of Communist publications shows that the
 FCP and its related organizations publish three daily newspapers in
 Paris, 14 dailies in the provinces, 61 provincial weeklies, and 83
 journals of greatly varying content and format.  There are comics for
 children,,film and sports reviews, picture magazines, literary journals,
 a law review, international news reports, and professional magazines.
 for teachers, doctors, and specialized workers of various kinds.
 Circulation figures for these publications vary widely,. but it
 appears that at.least a dozen of the publications have circulations
 of over 100,000.  In fact some of them (such as 1'Humanite Dimanche
 with a reported circulation of about 300,000) area a cove this
 figure.  Nevertheless, circulation of the Communist press, including
 that of the official party organ, 1'Humanite  has unquestionably
 been declining.  L'Humanite's circ  ation, as of January 1953, is
 estimated at 174,000  wi   about 145,000 copies being sold and the
 rest given away), as compared with 2211,000 in 1950 and 450,000 in 1947.
 While the circulation of the entire French press is at a postwar low,
 1'Humanite appears to have.suffered particularly heavy losses, and
 the same can apparently be said for a considerable number of other
 Communist publications.  In the provinces, the 14 Communist dailies
 had a total circulation in 1952 of 639,500, compared with 756,600 in
 1951.  Despite its difficulties, 1'Humanite has increased from six to
 eight pages within the past year, indicating that the party is
 continuing to pump money into the paper to keep it alive.

 To facilitate the printing and distribution of their various
 publications the Communists maintain a number of firms of their own,
 usually thinly disguised as commercial enterprises.  These firms include
 a considerable number of publishing houses.,, printing companies, book-
 stores, and other companies whose business it is to see to the circula
 tion and sale of Communist publications.
 Communist radio propaganda in France consists almost entirely of
 broadcasts, in French, from the Soviet Union and the bloc.
 These broadcasts are as follows:
 1) Radio Moscow
 Six broadcasts daily.
 7:00 A.M. on 31, 41, and 49 meters
 8:00 A.M. (on same wavelengths)
 12:30 P.M. on 25 and 31 meters

 2) Radio Budapest
 Two broadcasts daily:
 9:00 P.M. on 30 meters, 50, 40 meters 50, and 252 meters
 Midnight on same wavelenghhs.
 3) Radio Prague
 One broadcast daily:  "Tonight in France."
 This is the most important of the bloc's broadcasts.  It
 seeks to create the impression that it originates from a
 clandestine station in France.  On 233 meters 30.

 The potential French radio audience may be roughly estimated
 at 28,000,000.  (The number of home radio sets is something under
 9,000,000.  In addition there are about 100,000 radios in public places.
 If it is estimated that an average of three persons listen to each set,
 the potential radio audience may be set at between 27,000,000 and 28,000,000.)
 How large a part of this potential audience listens to Soviet and      .
 satellite broadcasts is unknown.  No polls have been conducted, sofar as
 is known, to determine the extent to which Soviet bloc broadcasts are
 heard in France.

 XI.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
 There appears to be very little dependable information available
 on FCP finances.  The only fact which seems clear is that the FCPts
 expenses are considerable and its means of support are not easily
 visible.
 In roughly estimating FCP annual expenses, it may be assumed
 that these expenses are of two main kinds=  salaries for party
 functionaries and 'propaganda expenses.  Salaries, estimated at a
 monthly figure of roughly 30,000 francs, would amount to about
 $5,500,000.  Propaganda expenses, admittedly extremely difficult to
 estimate, may be very roughly estimated at $28,500,000.  Hence the
 party's total expenses, according to this very tentative estimate, are
 in the neighborhood of $35,000,000.
 In estimating FCP income, on the other hand, there are even
 fewer rough indicators at hand.  The party's overt receipts (including
 dues and the standard remittances by Communist deputies and adminis.
 trative officials of part of their salaries) probably do not amount to
 more than about 10 percent of the party's total expenditures.  How much
 income the party receives from its publications, the CGT, and front
 organizations is unknown; nor is it known how much revenue the party
 secures from controlled business firma.  Such sources as these, however,
 probably do produce some income.
 It is also possible that the FOP secures some funds from the
 Soviet Union and the satellites through various channels, including
 especially the Communist-controlled Commercial Bank for Northern Europe.
 This bank, which.handles the accounts of most of the Communist
 organizations, is believed to be the intermediary for the movement of
 funds from the Soviet Union, the bloc countries, and the international
 offices of the major front organizations.  In the winter of 1948-49 the
 National Assembly became disturbed by reports that this bank was allegedly
 giving advances to the FCP, but their concern came to nothing when it
 appeared that there was nothing irregular in the Bank's activities.
 It has also been reported that the WFTU, through its contacts with the
 CGT, has occasionally made arrangements for contributions by unions of
 the satellite states to French strikers.
 The Soviet Union and satellites maintain diplomatic establishments
 in Paris, with their missions being fairly small in size.  According to
 the official French diplomatic list of January 1952, these missions were

 The Bulgarian, Finnish, Hungarian, and Polish missions included persons
 specifically charged with press or cultural affairs, but how many
 individuals are actually engaged in propaganda activities is unknown.
 The Soviet Embassy, for its part, publishes the monthly Etudes Sovietiques.
 The French branch of TOSS is also a Soviet propaganda instrument
 and liaison agent of note. . _T W occupies part of the office of the
 Soviet Information Bureau in Paris, and some of the personnel of TASS
 and the Soviet Information Bureau appears to'be interchangeable.
 Also noteworthy is the considerable number of Soviet or satellite
 "friendship" societies.  By far the most important of these societies
 is France-USSR with an estimated membership of about 60,000 throughout
 the country.  Its local departmental organizations are clearly-directed
 by the Communist Party, and, like the other front organizations, it has
 no independent leadership and existence.  Most of its non-Communist
 members merely attend meetings occasionally.  The pamphlet published by
 the organization, France-USSR, has a circulation of about 117,000, which
 is a fair sized circulation for a periodical of its kind in France.
 Additional activities of France-USSR inolude holding lectures, showing
 films, helping to distribute Soviet books and magazines, and sending
 delegations to the Soviet Union.  It appears that about a half dozen such
 delegations have been sent annually in recent years.

 IIII.  COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
 None of the Communist international front organizations currently
 has its headquarters in Paris.  The French Government expelled the head-
 quarters of the following organizations in 19512  the World Federation
 of Trade Unions, the Peace Movement, the World Federation of Democratic
 Youth, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the Interna-
 tional Association of Democratic Jurists.  The French national organizations
 which are affiliated with these internationals continue, however, to have
 their headquarters in Paris.
 During the past two years (1951-52) only one of these international
 organizations held a meeting in Paris.  The First International Conference
 for a Peaceful Solution of the German Problem, sponsored by the Peace
 Movement, was held in Paris May 12-14, 1951.  This meeting was attended
 by 226 delegates from 13 European countries.  No information is available
 on the number of French participants.
 A check on the participants in attendance at the various interna-
 tional front organizationst meetings, whether of working committees or
 full congresses, shows that French delegates were invariably present.
 Such meetings, moreover, are fairly frequent, and a review of them
 indicates that the international front organizations offer opportunities
 for approximately 50 contacts each year between French Communists or
 pro-Communists and Soviet or satellite representatives.  The WFTU hold
 22 conferences of various kinds from mid-1951 to mid-1952; the
 International Federation of Resistance, 7 meetings during approximately
 the same periods the Peace Movement, 12 sessions from January 1951 to

 November 1952; the woments organization, 5 sessions from early'1951 to
 July 1952; the lawyers, 5 from September 1951 to November 1952; and the
 World Federation of Democratic Youth, 16 meetings from August 1951 to
 the close of 1952.
 XIV.  COMMUNIST COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK
 The FCP has no problem in maintaining connections with the Soviet
 Union and other portions of the international Communist apparatus outside
 France.
 As pointed out in the preceding section, FCP leaders and Communist
 sympathizers have numerous contacts with the Soviet Union and the satel?.
 lites, as well as with Communists outside the Soviet bloc, through the
 meetings of the international front organizations.
 In addition about a dozen FCP leaders travel to Moscow fairly
 frequently.  That they bring back, at least occasionally, fairly specific
 instructions is indicated by the discussion in Duclost notebook of the
 way in which the directive for a change in the FCPts emphasis was
 transmitted from Moscow to the FCP in the spring of 1952.  This directive,
 Duclos indicates, was given to Billoux by Thores, and it may be assumed
 -- although this point is by no means.certain -- that the latter had
 cleared this directive, at least in principle, with Soviet leaders.
 .Various delegations of Communists and pro-Communists who are
 leaders of the major front organizations also go to Moscow on missions.
 France-USSR is particularly active in this connection.
 The Soviet Embassy in Paris has good opportunities for keeping
 in touch with the FCP.  A number of reports on contacts between the
 Soviet Embassy and the party indicate, however, that the Embassy tends
 to deal with the FCP through France-USSR, and specifically through its
 president, Fernand Grenier, rather than directly.

 This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities
 of Communist Parties in the countries of the free world.  It is di-
 vided into two parts:  (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics,
 and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific
 "assets" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check-
 list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current
 major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry
 them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives
 assessed in the light of both past and present performance.
 The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the
 evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational
 potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time,
 providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information
 is inadequate, unreliable, or absent.  The data presented in the sec-
 tion on "Assets" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather
 the best available to the Department at the present time.

 COMMUNISM IN THE NETHERLANDS:  OBJECTIVZS, TACTICS AND CAPABILITIES
 I.  OBJECTIVES
 In the Netherlands, the Communists' (CPN) principal objective is
 to detach the Netherlands from the Western camp and their secondary
 objective is to obstruct as much as possible the progress of Western
 unity under US leadership.      During the June 1952 electoral campaign,
 for instance, the first point in the Communist program was the creation
 of a "peace loving and independent Netherlands."  According to the
 Communists, this goal could best be reached by holding a Big Five
 conference, increasing East-West trade, halting rearmament, withdrawing
 Dutch units from Korea, seceding from NATO, cooperating with a united
 and "peace-loving" Germany, and breaking off all agreements between the
 US and the Netherlands.
 Since the government and all non-Communist political parties and
 labor groups in the Netherlands support moves toward Western unity, a
 closely related objective of the CPN is that of weakening the established
 political and social order by creating divisions and distrust between
 the government and the people and between the leadership and the rank
 and file of the non-Communist parties and labor unions.  Although the
 Dutch Communists are interested in promoting their own growth, this
 objective is generally subordinate to the aim of advancing the strategic
 interests of the USSR.
 II..  TACTICS
 In order to attain its objectives the Dutch Communist Party seeks
 to win a direct following among all social groups.  At their 16th
 Congress in Amsterdam last November, the Communist leaders issued a call
 for a "National United Front with all who are against the Americans
 and their collaborators," even including members of right-wing parties
 and classes.  The Communists argue that once reactionary leadership
 has been repudiated by the rank and file of the various parties, no
 further obstacle will stand in the war of fruitful cooperation between
 the "democratic" and Communist parties.
 In their propaganda, the Communists generally relate political
 issues to economic demands, arguing that the workers' low standard of
 living is caused by the government's "war policy."  Although the Dutch
 Communist Party poses most frequently as the  champion of the underdog,
 advocating government construction of low-cost housing, reduction in the
 cost of living, and greater benefits for pensioners, it makes an attempt
 to be all things to all men.  It appeals to the nationalism and anti-
 A-nericanism of some extreme right wing groups; it appeals to the moral
 scruples of religious groups by attacking "immoral films and reading

 matter, such as American cartoons and newspapers"; it appeals to the
 bitter memories of the Nazi occupation in its protest against clemency
 for German war criminals and the rearmament of Germany; it appeals to
 Dutch business interests by playing up the economic advantages to be
 derived from an increase in East-West trade.  Above all, it seeks to
 exploit the universal desire for peace and the fear of another war.
 The principal instruments in this campaign to gain a direct
 following among a great variety of social groups are the Dutch Peace
 Council and the Netherlands-USSR Association. By holding "peace
 congresses," "peace rallies," and "peace weeks," by agitating against
 the unloading of American arms and by collecting,signatures for the
 Stockholm Peace Appeal and later the appeal for a rive Power Peace
 Pact, the Netherlands Peace Council has sought to obtain mass support
 for Communist objectives.  On the whole, its efforts have had little
 success.  The Netherlands-USSR Association has reportedly been slightly
 more successful in its efforts to advance Soviet prestige through
 cultural media and has also served as a recruiting ground for new
 Communist members.  In the labor field, indications are that the
 Communist leaders have abandoned hopes of building up their own
 Communist-dominated Unity Trade Union Central (Eenheids Vakcentrale,
 EVC) at the expense of the non-Communist unions,  m=are concentrating
 Instead on direct infiltration of these unions, especially the
 Netherlands Federation of Trade Unions, which is most closely allied
 with the Netherlands Labor Party.
 III,  Capabilities
 The constant decline in numerical strength of the party and its
 front organizations (with the possible exception of the Netherlands-
 USSR Asso ciation) during the postwar period is a clear indication of
 the ineffectiveness of Communist propaganda.  From a peak of 53,000
 early in 1947, Communist membership dropped to about 33,000 by the end
 of 1949.  Since then it has apparently remained fairly constant;
 estimates range from 33,000 to 40,000 with the lower figure probably
 being more accurate.  In the Lower House of the Dutch Parliament,
 Communist representation dropped from ten seats in 1946 to six following
 the June 1952 election.  The Communists polled 6.16 percent of the total
 valid vote in this election (328,571), compared with 7.74 percent in
 1948 (381,953).  Membership in the Communist-dominated Unity Trade
 Union Central declined from an estimated 200,000 in 1945 to an estimated
 70,000 in 1952.  Circulation of the official Communist daily De Waarheid
 dwindled from an estimated peak of 400,000 in 1945 to the present
 estimated circulation of 100,000.  The newspaper has been in serious
 financial difficulties at least since 1947.  Periodic drives to increase

 the number of subscriptions have apparently met with little success.
 There is no prospect that the Dutch Communists will succeed in
 gaining sufficient popular support among the democratic parties and
 labor groups for their current anti-American policy to enable them to
 place any serious obstacles in the way of the official Netherlands
 policy of cooperation with the US and other Western nations.  Certain
 supporters of the Labor Party and of the extreme right-wing parties
 are highly critical of American leadership but all these elements
 distrust the Communists far more then they do the US.  Only a sharp
 increase in unemployment and a worsening of the local economic situation
 would be likely to siphon off support from the Labor Party to the
 Netherlands Communists,

 C0112, UNISI-i IN THE NETHERLANDS:  ASSETS
 I.  NUMERICAL STRENGTH
 The estimated membership of the Netherlands Communist Party is
 33,000.  The aggregate membership figure of organizations controlled
 by Communists is about 125,000, but the actual total may be less as
 many individuals belong to more than one front organization and many
 members of such organizations as the Communist-controlled trade unions
 are not Communists.  Slightly more than three percent of the popula-
 tion is influenced strongly enough by the Communists to vote the party
 ticket.  The bulk of the party membership and sympathizers is drawn
 from the industrial working class and from members of the lower middle
 classes living on small pensions, with a few intellectuals, professional
 people, and white collar workers furnishing the rest.  Geographically,
 Communist strength is greatest (1) in the highly urbanized and indus-
 trialized provinces of North and South Holland, including the three
 largest cities of the country, Amsterdam, The Hague, and Rotterdam,
 (2) in the industrial Twente section of the province of Overijssel
 and (3) in certain poorly developed, isolated rural sections, notably
 the eastern corner of the province of Groningen.  In this latter area,
 the town of Finsterwolde (population: 3,240) has a Communist-dominated
 town council.
 The "hard core" of the Communist Party is only about 10 percent
 of the total party strength, or roughly 3,000.  This hard core fur-
 nishes the militant leadership of the party.  The rest of the member-
 ship is, on the whole, apathetic but continues to vote for the party
 in spite of numerous shifts in party line and tactics.  The average age
 of the party leaders is between 45 and 50, and most of them joined the
 organization before the war.  Several of the top leaders have been
 active in key posts in the party for fifteen or twenty years.  Since
 the strength of the party prior to the war was never more than 10,000,
 at least two-thirds of the membership joined within the past five years.
 The "hard core" leadership is drawn almost exclusively from the laboring
 classes and is concentrated in the city of Amsterdam.  A considerable
 number of old-guard Communists are located in some of the villages in
 the northern tip of the province of North Holland and in the small
 towns and villages of the province of Groningen.  The membership of
 the party, which reached a maximum of 53,000 in 1947, dropped to
 33,000 by 1950 and has remained constant at that level.
 II.  ELECTORAL STRENGTH
 The Communist Party obtained 6.16 percent (328,571) of the
 5,335,064 valid votes cast in the parliamentary elections of June 1952,
 compared with 7.74 percent (381,953) of 4,932,959 valid votes in the
 1948 parliamentary elections, and 6.8 percent (329,365) of the 4,843,630

 valid votes in the elections for the Provincial States in 1950.  At
 present all non-Communist parties, except the People's Party for
 Freedom and Democracy and the small Political Reformed and Catholic
 National Parties, are represented in the government.  Since these
 three parties are as opposed to Communism as these parties in the
 governing coalition, the Communist Party is isolated in its opposi-
 tion.  Following is the breakdown of votes and seats in the Second
 Chamber of the Dutch States General following the elections of June
 1952.

 The Communists obtain the greatest number of votes in the cities
 of Amsterdam (22.35 percent of the total vote in the June 1952 parlia-
 mentary elections), Rotterdam (9.6 percent), and The Hague (6.6 percent).
 The Communists also are strong in the province of Groningen where they
 received 9.0 percent of the total valid votes in 1952.
 As Communist overtures to several of the democratic parties in
 1952 to form a "National Unity Front" were unsuccessful, the party
 campaigned independently in the June elections that year.  Its faction
 in Parliament is completely independent from the other opposition
 groups.
 III.  MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION
 The current policy of the Communist Party is to pose as a law-
 abiding, peace-loving organization.  Communists have been active in

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORP-ATION
 leading meetings and parades protesting commutation of the sentences
 of war criminals and the rearmament of Germany, however, these demon-
 strations have had no violent aspects.
 During World War II, the Communists participated in the anti-
 German resistance, but, with the exception of some individuals, they
 seem to have played only a subsidiary role.
 The Dutch Communists are believed to have some arms available
 in hidden caches although nothing specific is known, nor is there
 any detailed information on plans for execution of violent action.
 According to current reports the Communists plan to seize control of
 the railway network and to sabotage Dutch transportation in the event
 of war.  The Netherlands Railways authorities are well aware of these
 plans and are closely scrutinizing any employees whose loyalty is
 questioned.  There are also reports of an "agitation center" in
 Amsterdam which trains Communists for various tasks, but it is believed
 that this center concentrates on propaganda  and developing leader-
 ship in the party, rather than on schemes for violent action.
 The Dutch Communists have no known paramilitary organization,
 and could probably rally no more than a 1,000 men for active guerilla
 warfare in the event of an East-West war.  An attempt at armed insur-
 rection in peace-time is most unlikely in the Netherlands, for the
 Communists probably would have available to them for such an attempt
 only the several hundred "hard-core" members in the Amsterdam area.
 IV.  GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISAN
 The Communists are a legally recognized party in the Netherlands
 and relatively few restraints have been imposed on their activities.
 The Dutch Constitution was amended in 1948 to grant the govern-
 ment wide powers in times of national emergency.  This constitutional
 provision was implemented in 1952 by a law enabling the Queen in times
 of emergency, at the suggestion of the ihiinister of the Interior and
 with the approval of the States-General, to suspend normal legislative
 and judicial functions and to grant sweeping powers to the :Minister
 of the Interior, the Queen's Commissioners in the 11 provinces, and
 the Dutch mayors.  Although these powers have never been invoked,
 they act as a restraining force upon the Communists.  At the time of
 the passing of the bill, there was some talk in Communist circles of
 going underground, but such a step will probably not be taken unless
 the government becomes far more restrictive in its policy towards the
 Communists.

 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION
 A further hindrance to the Communists is the practice of keeping
 Communist members of most town councils, provincial states and the
 States General from participating in key administrative and legislative
 committees.
 Since December 1951, civil servants have been prohibited by the
 Dutch government from being members of the Communist Party, its women's,
 youth, and labor organizations.  Many of the municipalities of the
 kingdom have followed the lead of the national government in this
 matter.  Members of the Communist party working for the government of
 the city of Amsterdam have been seriously inconvenienced by this action
 and some of them have resigned their membership in the party as a re-
 sult.
 The Communist trade union federation is not recognized as a
 bona fide bargaining agent by the government.
 Most of the trade unions in the Netherlands are combined into
 four major federations.  In the Catholic and Protestant federations,
 the Communists are barred from membership.  Of the 400,000 members in
 the Socialist federation (The Netherlands Federation of Trade Unions),
 less than one percent is Communist.
 The Communist Unity Trade Union Central (Eenheidsvakcentrale
 EVC) claimed 164,000 members in 1951, although its actual strength is
 probably no more than 70,000.  Its four most important components are
 the General Union of Transport Workers (Algemene Bedrijfsbond Transport),
 which includes the dockworkers and claimed 13,000 members in 1951;
 the General Union of Workers in the Building Trades (Algemene Bond van
 Werkers in de Bouwnijverheid) with 33,600 claimed members in 1951; the*
 Union of Dutch Government Personnel (Bond van Nederlands  Overheidspersoneel),
 which controls many of the manual laborers in the employ of the city
 of Amsterdam and claimed 18,900 members in 1951; and the I-?etal Workers'.
 Trade Union (Bond van Werknemers in de I?~etaalnijverheid en Aanverwante
 Bedrijfstakken) with 27,110 claimed members scattered through the
 aircraft, shipbuilding and other defense industries.  The actual mem-
 bership of these unions is probably one-half the claimed membership.
 The Communists are not in control of any key industries, but-
 could probably considerably damage the economic life of the port of
 Amsterdam where the Communist transport workers' union controls a
 large number of longshoremen.  Communist workers are too few in such
 vital industries as aviation and electronics to be a grave security threat.
 The Unity Trade'Union Central is affiliated with and active in
 the work of the WFTU.

 VI.  COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL,
 AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION
 The most important Communist front organizations in the Netherlands
 1)  The General Netherlands Youth Federation (Algemeen Nederlands
 Jeugdverbond) which has somewhat less than 5,000 members, a ou   a   o
 whom are concentrated in Amsterdam.   It is the youth movement of the
 Communist Party and due to its weakness, offers practically no competi-
 tion to non-Communist organizations in the same field.  Its leadership
 is composed of "hard. core" party members who control the organization,
 but the Federation suffers from a lack of trained youth leaders. The
 organization is an affiliate of the World Federation of Democratic
 Youth.   It is attempting to recruit new members by emphasizing hobbies
 rather than politics, but its capabilities for any expansion of membership
 or activity are limited.
 2)  The organization of Progressive Student Youth (Organisatie
 van Progressieve Studerende Jeugd), an affiliate of the In erne Iona
 U ion of    tudents  IUS , is composed of several hundred secondary school
 students.   It is relatively unimportant in youth and student circles
 and its efforts to influence the texts used in secondary schools have
 been unsuccessful.  The organization is in financial difficulties and
 its membership is quite static.
 3) The Netherlands Women's Movement (Nederlandse Vrouwenbeweging,
 NVB) is the women's auxiliary of the Communist Party.  Founded in
 it has about 5,000 members and is affiliated with-the Communist front ,
 Women's International Democratic Federation.   Its membership is fairly
 constant and the possibilities for growth are negligible.  The
 Netherlands Women's Movement supports the Communist Party in all cam-
 paigns and actions.
 4)  The Netherlands-USSR Association (Vereniging Nederland-USSR)
 was formed in March 1948 through a merger of many  oca  groups  o
 stimulate friendly relations and establish social and cultural ties
 between the two nations.  Originally appealing to non-Communists as well
 as to Communists and their sympathizers, its strict adherence to the
 party line has eliminated most of the non-Cormmunist elements.  The
 Association claimed a membership of 13,000 in 1951, but half that figure
 is probably more accurate.
 5)  The Netherlands Peace Council (Nederlandse Vredesraad) co-
 ordinates the work of various "peace" comma  ees w is    unction on a
 regional, local, and factory level.  The Council claims a circulation of
 20,000 for its organ Vrede (peace).  The Council supports such movements

 as the Stockholm Peace Petition, the Moscow Economic Conference, etc.  Of
 late its rallies and meetings in behalf of world peace and its open con-
 demnation of the US and the West have received only a luke-warm reception.
 6)  The Workers' Cultural Union (Arbeiders Bond voor Cultuur),
 founded in 1948 and claiming 10,000 members  n January 1,-fs in#ended
 to promote the cultural development of the workers along Communist lines.
 Its leadership has been rather inactive, and the Union itself is closely
 allied with the Union of Socialist Choral and Musical Societies in the
 Netherlands (Bond van Socialistische Zang-en Muziokverenigingen in
 Nederland) whose purpo  a  m-em ersiip -? in Novain er 1949 was 1* 600.  The
 Musical  Society's purpose is to enliven the meetings of Communist and
 Communist front organizations.
 7)  The United Resistance, 1940-1945 (Verenigd Verzat, 1940-1945)
 organization claims a membership of 1,000 and is  a   1 37Esd with the
 international Communist front organization, the International Federation
 of Resistance Fighters (FIR).
 8)  The Committee for Help to Indonesia (Comite Hulp aan Indonesia)
 and the Indonesian Association (Perhimpoenan Ind</div></div></div>  </div>
