 Talking Points
 I.    Intelligence Summary
 A.   Chinese and Vietnamese border dispositions
 -- China can strike along a wide front but we believe
 it more likely will concentrate on the northeast because
 of more advantageous terrain.
 B.   Changes on Sino-Soviet border
 C.   Situation in Kampuchea
 -- Vietnamese holding towns but encountering increasing
 Kampuchean resistance in countryside, esp. in NE, S, and
 SW Kampuchea.

 D.   Sino-Vietnamese propaganda and border incidents
 -- Both sides accusing the other of border encroach-
 ments,      -
 -- Chinese privately speaking of need for swift, major
 strike.
 -  Chinese established rationale for border strike at
 time and place of their choice.
 E.     Possible Chinese and Vietnamese options
 -- Chinese can lower tension, continue buildup while
 avoiding action, or undertake punitive action similar
 to 1962 India war.   Only last course would respond to
 Chinese humiliation at hands of Vietnamese.
 (             -- Hanoi keeping head down; may count on limited Chinese
 attack and afterwards launch propaganda campaign against
 Chinese "aggression".
 II. Implications for Deng Visit
 -- A Chinese attack before or during the visit erodes Con-
 gressional support for normalization.
 -- An attack at any time suggests to Moscow Sino-US collusion.
 -- If the attack has not occured Deng will want to gauge US
 reaction to a move at a later date.
 III. Implications for Kriangsak Visit
 -- Kriangsak is going to be nervous about the Vietnamese
 threat and the on-going refugee problem; he is going to want
 U.S. assurances of support.

 CHINESE-VIETNAMESE BORDER DEPLOYMENTS
 I.   The military balance along the Sino-Vietnamese border
 now favors China.  Vietnam has improved its defenses,
 but its forces are no match for the Chinese
 C.   China has the capability to attack Vietnam along a
 wide front, but we believe it will concentrate on
 the northeast where the terrain is more suitable
 for the movement of heavy equipment.

 CURRENT SITUATION IN KAMPUCHEA
 25X1
 1.     The Vietnamese are having difficulty consolidating their
 control over the Kampuchean countryside.  Vietnamese
 columns have moved into virtually every city or town
 but have not yet been able to track down and destroy
 the Kampuchean forces that fled during the initial invasion.

 Sji.no-Vietnamese Propaganda and Border Incidents
 Chinese media continue to pour out anti-Vietnamese
 propaganda.  The key indicators of tension -- protest
 notes and reports of incidents -- are frequent but essen-
 tially unchanged since China issued a stern warning on
 25X1          25 December.
 A. Border incidents continue to occur.   The propa-
 ganda suggests that Chinese are patrolling some-
 what more aggressively, although not yet with
 regular army units.
 25X1
 25X1
 B.   Chinese and Vietnamese protests have focused on
 specific areas along the border, most notably
 a 300 meter stretch of railline south of Pingxiang
 25X1                     (Ping-hsiang).
 25X1
 In private Chinese officials are talking tougher and
 more uniform terms about the prospects for a "swift and
 major" military strike along the Vietnam-China border.
 In comments apparently designed to reach the US
 that appear to reflect recent guidance, one official
 noted that such a strike would assist in deterring
 Vietnam from extending its influence to other neighboring

 countries and might east Vietnamese pressure on Pol Pot's
 forces in Kampuchea.   The same official had previously
 described Chinese military activity along the Vietnamese
 border as purely defensive and had said that China was
 restrained by the possibility of Soviet retaliation.
 Peking, however, continues to link China's actions
 with Vietnam's "encroachments" on Chinese territory.
 Thus, the Chinese are continuing to develop a rationale
 for a border strike while maintaining the option to take
 action at a time and place of their choosing.

 CHINESE AND VIETNAMESE OPTIONS
 China thus far has kept open its options for dealing

 along the border.   This would reduce risks of
 escalation but would not "punish" Vietnam for

 tion of China.
 b. Beijing could also simply sustain current tensions,
 maintain or further develop its buildup, while
 avoiding any cross-border action.   This could
 be rationalized as tieing down Vietnamese forces
 that could be committed to Kampuchea.
 c. We continue, to believe, however, that some
 form of direct action against Vietnam to be
 the most likely Chinese course.  Chinese
 officials are now specifically refferring to
 China's punitives strike into India in 1962
 as the likely manner in which Vietnam will be
 "taught a lesson."
 At this point Hanoi, committed heavily in Kampuchea,
 appears intent on keeping its own head down in order not
 to give China any pretext for military action.   Hanoi may
 be counting on any Chinese attack being limited in scope
 and duration. In that case, the Vietnamese may not offer

 IMPLICATICNS FOR DENG XIAOPING VISIT
 The present Sino-Vietnamese confrontation and the
 chance of direct Chinese military action against Vietnam
 in the immediate period surrounding Vice Premier Deng's
 visit poses some significant political problems for the
 US.  On the: domestic front, aggressive Chinese military
 action could work to undermine support.-in Congress for
 US-PRC normalization arrangements.   A Chinese military
 blow against Vietnam would lead to a rapid escalation
 of Sino-Soviet tensios and conceivably to conflict along
 the Sino-Soviet frontier--developments that would seriously
 complicate our bilateral relationships with both Moscow
 and Peking.   In this regard, Moscow would view Chinese
 action taken during or immediately adjacent to Deng's
 discussions in Washington as evidence of tacikr US
 Beijing is clearly aware of these considerations
 and must carefully weigh the risks of putting such
 strain on their newly-won relationship with Washington.
 Although we are in no position to rule out an earlier
 Chinese move, this suggests that the: Chinese will dealy
 any military action at least until after Deng's visit.

 latest example of the expansion of Soviet power and will
 link a strong Chinese posture against Vietnam with the
 need for a tough US stance against the Soviet Union in
 other regions and forums.  Deng will also be interested in
 gauging, at least indirectly, the firmness of the US
 position regarding a possible demonstration of Chinese
 military power against Vietnam and the possible reaction
 of the US to Soviet moves against China in that event.

 rp responsa3 o t20 e  ietnamese invasiolWof Kampuchea,
 the UN Security Council on 15 January voted 13-2 in favor
 of a ceasefire, the withdrawal of "foreign forces," and
 strict adherence to the principle of non-interference in
 the internal affairs of other states.   The resolution,
 sponsored by six non-aligned states, was milder and less
 polemical than an earlier Chinese proposal.   Prince
 Sihanouk's strong indictment of Hanoi and his personal
 standing in the non-aligned movement sparked broad
 support, and it was opposed by only the Soviet Union
 and Czechoslovakia.   The negative Soviet vote constituted
 a veto, but the resolutions's supporters considered the
 outcome of the vote a clear victory.   Reluctance to
 pursue the issue in the General Assembly stemmed from
 recognition that only a weaker and less decisive reso-
 lution could be passed there.

 1.     Intelligence Summary
 A.   Situation in Kampuchea
 Vietnam has accomplished its basic political and mili-
 tary objectives in Kampuchea:                                                     imposition of a subservient
 Kampuchean regime; military occupation of most of the country.
 Nevertheless, armed forces loyal to former Prime Minister
 Pol Pot, are carrying on guerrilla resistance throughout the
 country with up to 50,000 troops widely dispersed, often
 cut off and difficult to resupply but still capable of con-
 ducting spoiling actions and almost impossible to eradicate
 completely.
 Vietnam, with over 100,000 troops, uncontested control
 of the urban areas, airfields, ports, and roads plus ease of
 resupply has the clear advantage..  Vietnamese forces are
 fanning out into the countryside to search out and destroy
 Kampuchean resistance.   Peking is likely to renew efforts to
 persuade Thailand to permit overland transit of Chinese aid
 to Pol Pot forces.
 Vietnam is moving rapidly to "legitimize" a close
 relationship with the Kampuchean regime it has installed.
 Pham Van Dong is scheduled to visit Phnom Penh soon and will
 probably conclude various economic, political and military
 agreements, analagous to those with Laos, designed in part
 to provide the "legal basis" for a longstanding Vietnamese
 military presence in Kampuchea, possibly at its current level.
 B.   Sino-Vietnamese Propaganda Over Alleged Border
 Incident
 Since the end of December Peking and Hanoi have increased
 propaganda attacks on one another.Each side has demanded "an
 immediate stop" to provocations and encroachments, and said
 that the other "must bear responsibility for all consequences"
 arising from its activities.  Vietnam's diplomatic notes to
 the PRC referred to hopes of friendship with China despite
 Chinese activity, while China has omitted any reference to
 a hope for friendship with Vietnam in its notes to the SRV.
 Peking's propaganda has been harsher than Vietnam's.
 A People's Daily article December 24 said "China will not

 attack unless it is attacked" but there is a limit to the
 Chinese people's forebearance" and Vietnam should not "com-
 plain later that we've not given you a clear warning in
 advance."  And on January 8, the People's Daily said:   "We
 want to warn the Vietnamese authorities:  Gone are the days
 when China could be trampled upon at will.  No matter how
 strong your behind-the-scenes boss is, you will not be able
 to encroach upon China's territory.  Otherwise, you will
 certainly receive your due punishment."
 C.   Chinese Border Dispositions
 A major military buildup has been underway since mid-
 December in the two military regions (MR) Kunming and
 Guangzhou (Canton), north and east of the Vietnam border.
 Both regions are now under the command of senior, combat
 experienced officers.  Combat units of at least four Chinese
 armies in these military regions have been moved toward the
 Vietnamese border.  We do not know what proportion of their
 total personnel complement of between 120,000 and 150,000
 have moved.   Similarly, we do not know the exact disposition of
 Chinese  forces in the Vietnamese border area, but approxi-
 mately 11,000 men are believed to be based in the northwest
 within 50 miles of the border along the rail line leading
 from the Chinese city of Kunming to Hanoi and  another 11,000
 men are believed to be in the east within 100 miles of the
 border along the rail line leading from Guangzhou (Canton)
 to Hanoi.  Possibly several times this number are already
 in the border area.  We know that transportation of military
 material and personnel has disrupted rail traffic throughout
 east China, and may have caused a total ban on non-military
 traffic as of January 20.
 The massive air redeployment observed between January 16-
 19 has slowed down, but additional augmentation of air
 strength appears to be still going on.   In all, a total of
 146 high performance aircraft including at least 37 F-9's,
 China's best ground'support fighter bomber, and 28 MiG 21's,
 China's highest performance fighter, are in the border area.
 This constitutes at least a third, and probably closer to
 one half, of China's entire inventory of MiG 21's.

 China has also markedly increased its early warning
 radars since mid-December.  There are 22 new sites in the
 Grangzhou and Kunming MRs most of them within thirty miles
 of the Vietnam border.
 PRC naval activity in South China remains at near normal
 levels, but there is evidence of an increased state of readi-
 ness and of increased naval air patroling.
 D.  Vietnamese Border Dispositions
 In the provinces adjacent to the border, Vietnam has
 at least two economic construction divisions, one possible
 infantry division, and considerable numbers of border and
 regional forces.   It is almost impossible to estimate Viet-
 namese troop strength in the border area.  But at a minimum
 there should be in excess of 100,000 lightly armed troops
 serving as the front line of defense.  Numerous defense
 works and artillery positions have also been established
 near the border since mid-1978, but overall Vietnam is not
 in a good position to defend its border against a determined
 Chinese attack.
 Protecting the immediate Hanoi-Haiphong area are four
 main force infantry divisions (approximately 30,000-40,000
 troops), several brigades, regional forces, and other eco-
 nomic construction and training divisions.  Five major air
 bases, well-protected by AAA and SAM sites, ring Hanoi.
 There are probably close to 200 Soviet-made fighter aircraft
 positioned at these airfields (compared to nearly 300 fighter
 aircraft and medium size bombers now positioned at Chinese
 airbases near the border).
 Vietnamese ground, air, and air defense forces are on
 full alert and would put up stiff resistance to any Chinese
 attack.   If Chinese ground and air forces which could be
 deployed from southern China struck deep into the Red River
 Delta, Chinese advantages in troop strength and firepower
 could overwhelm the Vietnamese defences and enable the
 Chinese to penetrate perhaps even as far as Hanoi.

 F.  Chinese Options
 In considering its options, China may be motivated by
 a determination to punish Vietnam for'alleged border provo-
 cations and for its aggression against Kampuchea; to force
 a redeployment of Vietnam's forces from Kampuchea; and to
 show the world that China will stand up to Soviet "expan-
 sionism" and "hegemony."  Moreover,evident leadership dif-
 ferences in Peking could result in a harder stance towards
 Vietnam than would appear to be prudent.  Whichever option
 is pursued, China will have to weigh the risk of Soviet
 military reaction.
 --China could continue its air and ground build up
 but stop short of major military activity.
 --Using the pretext of Vietnamese provocation for
 which China has already laid the groundwork,
 Beijing could attack and hold territory in the
 border area, --as it did in India in 1962--with
 the forces already assembled.   China might
 destroy military installations and personnel in
 the vicinity but not advance more than several
 kilometers into Vietnamese territory.
 --China could use its air and ground power assembled
 along the border to mount a deeper punitive attack
 from the northwest and northeast.  The objective
 might be the air fields and associated aircraft in
 the vicinity of Hanoi as well as the main force
 divisions which defend Hanoi.  The drive might be
 followed by a relatively rapid withdrawal.
 --The worst case scenario would be a two pronged attack
 on Hanoi in which the primary objective could be
 the central government itself and the Vietnamese
 military headquarters.  This would severely disrupt
 the command and communications links between the
 High Command in Hanoi and subordinate units through-
 out Vietnam, Kampuchea, and Laos.

 G.  Vietnamese Options
 --Hanoi may calculate that Beijing's build up is
 designed to force some redeployment of main
 force units from Kampuchea to cope with the
 Chinese threat.  For this reason, and because
 Hanoi's forces are heavily committed elsewhere,
 in response to a limited Chinese attack confined
 to the border area Hanoi will likely rely on
 regional forces, and border militia.
 --if the Chinese attack in force and penetrate well
 beyond the border area and threaten Hanoi, Vietnam
 will probably allow the Chinese to advance.   Ground
 and air forces already in the Red River Delta would
 attempt to blunt the Chinese drive.  Only if the
 Chinese military action were protracted would
 Vietnam redeploy military units from further
 south or from Kampuchea.
 --Whatever military action China may take, Hanoi
 will almost certainly invoke Article Six of the
 Soviet-Vietnamese Treaty calling for consultations
 if Vietnam's security is threatened.
 H. Soviet Options
 In the absence of Chinese military action against
 Vietnam, Moscow's interests would seem to be best served by
 doing nothing, i.e., maintaining a non-provocative stance
 on the Sino-Soviet border and exploiting politically and in
 propaganda Peking's setback in Kampuchea.
 Minor Chinese military action against Vietnam that
 did not endanger Hanoi and that was ineffective in helping
 the Pol Pot forces, i.e., would not cause the Vietnamese to
 redeploy troops from Kampuchea, would probably result in
 low-keyed responses.  Moscow would likely confine itself to
 non-hostile military moves--calling for consultations under
 the new treaty--a conspicuous air or sea supply of military
 equipment, maneuvers or alerts on the Sino-Soviet border,
 and a possible naval port call at Cam Ranh Bay, Danang or
 Haiphong.  Moscow would also exploit Chinese "aggression"

 to the maximum diplomatically (e.g. in its warnings against
 Western arms sales to China).              The possibility of trans-
 border operations by small Soviet units cannot be excluded.
 Major Chinese action against Vietnam would require
 a more substantial Soviet counter-move.  This could even
 take the form of "punitive" strikes across the Sino-Soviet
 border or naval bombardment of Chinese-held South China Sea
 islands.    In the former case, Moscow may prefer to strike
 against Xinjiang (Sinkiang) as the Chinese apparently expect.
 This could be done in the guise of supporting local
 minority dissidents and might be preferred to a strike against
 Manchuria, because of the latters proximity to sensitive
 Soviet installations.
 In any event, the Soviets are unlikely to move
 against China unless it first attacks Vietnam and then Soviet
 reaction will be measured.

 2.   Diplomatic Actions Taken to Date
 A.  Original Security Council Action
 The Security Council's 13-2 vote demonstrated inter-
 national solidarity and Soviet isolation on the principle
 of territorial integrity and put the U.S. in support of
 the non-aligned rather than choosing sides in intra-
 communist struggles.
 B.  Follow-up on UN Action and AID
 We have been actively pressing some twenty countries,
 at the UN and in capitals, trying to stimulate Security
 Council or General Assembly action to follow up on the
 Security Council vote.  While there exists some sentiment
 among the ASEANs and other non-aligned states for pursuing
 the issue further, no governments are yet ready actually
 to ask for a meeting.   Our efforts are being intensified .
 On aid, we have approached all major donors of bi-
 lateral aid and leading members of the non-aligned world
 to build support for a possible freeze on future bilateral
 and multilateral development assistance to Vietnam.  A
 number of governments have indicated they will suspend or
 reduce future aid (e.g. , Japan, Denmark, Belgium and
 Britian).   Others, including the EC and Sweden,  are review-
 ing the issue and should make decisions soon.  We have in-
 f ormed the PRC of these results.
 C.   Demarche to USSR, PRC, and SRV
 We have twice urged Chinese restraint in discussions
 here with Ambassador Chai.  In Peking USLO has also raised
 our concern about a widening of the conflict. We have told
 the Chinese that there are alternatives to military action
 (e.g., aid squeeze, UN action) which can be used to keep
 pressure on the Vietnamese and the USSR while maintaining
 broad international support for the PRC.  Under these
 conditions, the U.S. can continue to support and work
 closely with the PRC. . Chinese military action would tend
 to reverse international sentiment, cast doubt upon the
 stabilizing effects of US-PRC normalization and seriously
 undercut the benefits we see from Deng's trip to the U.S.
 Chai told us that the PRC is keeping its options open, and
 that in the event of continued provocations, the SRV would
 have to accept the consequences.

 In Paris, Bangkok, and New York we approached the
 Vietnamese and called for Vietnamese withdrawal.  The
 Vietnamese responded formally, blaming Peking for the
 escalation of tensions.          We have gone back to them
 stating that we consider Vietnam's invasion the direct
 cause of area tensions, again urging their withdrawal,
 and stating our support for a genuinely independent
 Kampuchea.
 We initially asked the Soviets to urge Vietnamese
 restraint.  They offered a formal response that there
 were no Vietnamese troops in Cambodia.  We took Dobrynin
 to task for this evasion and emphasized the concerns
 about spillover incidents in Thailand.  As indications
 of possible Chinese action grew we expressed concern to
 Dobrynin's deputy, and again to Dobrynin himself, about
 the possible widening of the fighting.  The Soviets
 expressed confidence that Thailand has nothing to worry
 about and ventured the opinion that China would not move
 against Vietnam.  They did point out, however, that they
 would anticipate consultations with Hanoi under the
 Soviet-Vietnamese treaty if China should take action
 against the SRV.  (This could lead to direct Soviet
 military support of Vietnam.)
 D.  Consultation with Japan and others on Sino-
 Vietnamese Tensions
 We have informed our major western allies and Tokyo
 of our concern about the PRC military buildup and asked
 them to approach Peking to urge the Chinese to exercise
 restraint on the Sino-Vietnamese border.  We are attempting
 to stimulate ASEAN and other non-aligned leaders (Yugoslavia,
 Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Jamaica) into taking the lead at
 the UN and in non-aligned circles to keep the pressure on
 Vietnam and thus perhaps lessen the possibility of direct
 Chinese military action.

 3.  Congressional Consultation and Reaction
 We have informed kev Congressional leaders of the
 Chinese military buildup and our efforts to forestall
 any action by a combination of demarches to the PRC,
 SRV and USSR plus efforts at the UN and approaches to
 our close allies.  Some Members may also be aware of the
 detailed situation from the press.  To date we have had
 little expression of concern and almost no inquiries
 from the Hill as to the situation on the ground.  How-
 ever, in our conversations with those who know the
 situation (e.g. Senator Nunn's group, Senator Church)
 they anticipate that a major escalation of hostility on
 the Chinese/Vietnamese border, which appears to have
 been provoked at least in part by China, would seriously
 erode receptivity towards normalization and our China
 legislation.   It was generally believed that a major
 Chinese military initiative was likely to increase
 support for maintenance in some form the U.S. ROC mutual
 defense treaty.

 4.  Public Posture
 We have expressed our belief that the Vietnamese
 invasion of Kampuchea violates the principles of
 territorial integrity and of the inviolability of
 frontiers and raises the danger of a wider war.  While
 continuing to condemn the human rights policies of
 the Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea, we have stressed that
 the internal policies of one country do not justify
 the external aggression of another.  We have made
 public our approaches to the USSR, Vietnam and China
 urging restraint, and our support for Thailand.  We
 have indicated publicly that there is a Chinese buildup,
 which causes concern, but avoided specifics and projected
 an image of calm rather than panic.

 5.   POSSIBLE MILITARY DEPLOYMENTS OR CHANGES BY USG
 Our principal objective is to reduce the scope,
 intensity and duration of any Sino-Viet conflict.
 Our military activities must thus be carefully
 coordinated with our diplomatic initiatives, and
 tailored to our estimate of the changing situation.
 For the present we do not wish to take actions
 which would heighten tensions, e.g., increase in
 DEFCON, redeployments, or ad hoc exercises.   However,
 there may be a need for changes in reconnaissance
 activities.
 In the event that the PRC should opt for
 military action against Vietnam, with or without
 an early Soviet response, we will need to consider
 whether or not there are certain military actions
 which we should take as a signal of U.S. concern,
 or to position ourselves should Chinese actions
 result in a much more serious situation.  An inter-
 agency study of possible U.S. options could usefully
 be undertaken on an urgent basis, keyed to Chinese
 and Soviet options.  Of special concern would be the
 deployment of Soviet ships, personnel or aircraft to
 Vietnam, as well as a direct Soviet military con-
 frontation with China.

 6.   Implications for Deng Visit
 Chinese invasion of Vietnam will weaken some argu-
 ments we are using for normalization:   (a) it enhances
 the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific area;  (b)
 Chinese stress on internal modernization programs, etc.,
 makes attack on Taiwan unlikely for the forseeable future
 (i.e. if the Chinese attack Vietnam, why shouldn't
 they be prepared soon to be equally belligerent toward
 Taiwan?)
 Without an invasion we expect Vietnam will be a
 major topic in the President's meeting with Teng.
 Chinese build-up on the border, whether or not the PRC
 acts against Vietnam before or during the visit, will
 make it all the more urgent that the talks focus on this
 issue.  Pre-visit press attention to the border buildup
 also will require Deng, in his appearances on the Hill
 and in other public fora, to explain the PRC's Vietnam
 action.  We hope he will also make a clear distinction
 between Vietnam and Taiwan.  The tense situation may also
 require the President to adjust his public remarks --
 welcome statement, White House dinner, JFK Center -- to
 avoid too close an identification with Chinese action
 against Vietnam.
 If a Chinese invasion takes place before or during
 the visit, we will have to consider adjusting Deng's
 schedule, particularly the more effusive manifestations
 of hospitality, to distance ourselves from the Chinese
 actions.  However, we believe little change in this
 schedule will be practicable or advisable, because:
 (a) the essential purpose of using Deng's trip to gain
 support for and weaken opposition to normalization will
 remain;  (b) the domestic pressures on the Administration
 to permit the trip to proceed as scheduled will remain
 very high.  Furthermore, we will not want to handle the
 Deng's visit, even in such a changed Asian context, in
 any manner to give comfort to the Soviets.

 7.   Implications for the Kriangsak Visit
 Prior the SRV invasion of Kampuchea, the visit of
 Thai PM Kriangsak was already important as a demonstration
 of our new relationship with Southeast Asia and ASEAN.
 Reinforcing that relationship remains important, but we
 must now also devote more effort to a balanced but
 firm security support for our friends in SEAsia.  Our
 credibility is important not only for Thailand and ASEAN,
 but also for a successful process of normalization with
 China and stability in the Korean peninsula.  At the
 same time, we want to avoid any relapse to earlier eras
 when the security focus was excessive and dominated other
 policy interests.  We will have to walk a fine line of
 measured reassurance and response.
 Principal Thai security concerns now are how to
 balance three potential acts of external pressure:
 -- SRV military action along the Thai border would impact
 very negatively on Thai politics even if accidental.
 Deliberate military action could place the U.S*. Manila
 Pact commitment squarely on the line.
 -- The Thai Communist Party based along the Thai-Cambodian
 border is a modes insurgent threat which could, if taken
 over by the SRV, become a more serious long-term threat.
 -- The PRC desire to support Pol Pot's querillas through
 Thailand forces upon Kriangsak an agonizing choice
 between antagonizing the Chinese (whom he views as some-
 what supportive) or provoking the Vietnamese (whom he
 sees as very threatening).
 At present, the Vietnamese are being careful not to
 approach the Thai border and are not yet in a position
 to dominate the Thai Communist Party.  Should Thailand
 become a base for support to Pol Pot's querillas, the
 Vietnamese attitude could change.  This issue may come up
 during both Deng's and Kriangsak's visits.

 8.  U.S. Policy Towards Chinese Military Action
 The policy we have pursued to date has minimized
 the damage by reassuring Thailand and ASEAN, focussing
 as much pressure as we could generate upon Vietnam as
 the cause of new tensions in the area, enabled us to
 avoid being seen as taking Peking's side in a struggle
 with Moscow, and offered the PRC an alternative to
 direct military action.  There has been remarkably
 little Congressional or public concern and criticism.
 Should the PRC decide that its strategic posture vs. the
 USSR requires direct military action against Vietnam,
 this would change radically.
 An immediate problem would arise with Congress and
 the public concerning our normalization policy.  An even
 more serious problem would be posed at home and abroad
 concerning our posture with respect to the PRC, the
 USSR, our friends and allies, and the non-aligned.
 Current uncertainties, tensions and fears would be
 substantially magnified.  And should the USSR respond
 militarily, the world could face another major conflict
 unless we and others were somehow able to contaon the
 threat.
