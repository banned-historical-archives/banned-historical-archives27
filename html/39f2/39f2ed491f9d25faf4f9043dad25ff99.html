 Palestinian comment on the US-Soviet: statement re-
 mains generally favorable. The Palestinian news agency's polit-
 ical editor in Beirut,  in an unusually optimistic commentary
 on Monday,  termed the statement "an advanced positive step to-
 ward realizing a just and permanent solution in the Middle
 East."
 Even a spokesman for the radical Popular Front for
 the Liberation of Palestine reportedly described the statement
 as "interesting." He went on to interpret it, however, as en-
 dorsing the right of the Palestinians to establish a "demo-
 cratic state" with the Jews.
 The Palestine Liberation Organization's unofficial
 oreign minister, Faruq Qaddumi, also praised the communique
 as positive and said it reflected international efforts aimed
 at passage of a new UN Security Council resolution as a basis
 for a Middle East settlement.
 Egypt's suspension of cotton shipments to the USSR
 in ilugust has reportedly Zed to speculation about Soviet retal-
 iation.  Soviet economic leverage on Egypt is minimal and even
 a complete rupture of trade ties with the USSR would be a tem-
 porary inconvenience rather than a serious  hardship for Egypt.
 In 1976, the USSR provided less than 10 percent of
 Egypt's imports. The Soviet exports consisted primarily of in-
 dustrial machinery and raw materials, which have little immedi-
 ate impact on the disgruntled urban population and can be ob-
 tained elsewhere. We estimate that Egyptian exports to the USSR
 could be sold in Western and Arab markets for at least enough
 hard currency to cover purchases of goods now acquired in the
 USSR.
 The Egyptians have improved their chances of sell-
 ing goods in the West since they realigned. the value of their
 currency last year. Even Egyptian private manufacturers, who
 formerly sent up to 90 percent of their otLtput to Communist
 countries, are finding customers in the West.

 The Egyptian commerical attache in Moscow has denied
 that the -USSR has ceased sending coking coal to Egypt as re-
 ported in Cairo media. There is also no evidence that Moscow
 is putting pressure on Poland to cut off its shipments. Coke
 shortages in the USSR and the congestion in the Egyptian port
 of Alexandria make long delays between coke shipments not un-
 common.  In any event,  the Egyptians have already bought extra
 coking coal from Poland and should be able to keep the Helwan
 steel complex operating at current output levels for the next
 six months while they seek other suppliers.
 The Egyptians would not have an immediate problem
 procuring spare parts and other industrial machinery. Most So-
 viet machinery in Egypt is very new,  similar to machinery ob-
 tainable elsewhere, or able to be phased out without major dis-
 ruption to output.

 North Yemeni President Ibrahim aZ-Hamdi and his trou-
 esome rival,  tribal  leader Abdallah al-Ahma:r,  may be about
 to reconcile their differences. A phased reconciliation agree-
 ment, drawn up under the sponsorship of Saudi Arabia, would if
 implemented strengthen the Yemeni Government's control of the
 nothern part of the country and enhance relations between North
 Yemen and Saudi Arabia.
 elements of the agreement,  such as the release of political
 prisoners affiliated with Ahmar,  already have been implemented.
 The Yemeni President also has agreed to make Ahmar his assis-
 tant for tribal and internal affairs--a post without authority
 in. the government--and to reconvene Parliament. The composition
 of Parliament would be changed, however, to reduce its bias in
 favor of tribal interests.
 In return, Ahmar reportedly has lifted restrictions
 on. travei in the northern part of the country, which is largely
 under tribal control,  and has agreed to integrate tribal mili-
 tary units into the regular army.
 The Saudis, who in the past backed Ahmar as a buffer
 between themselves and the Yemeni government they did not com-
 pletely trust, apparently applied considerable pressure on the
 tribal leader to resolve his differences with Hamdi. The Saudi
 move is likely to reduce Hamdi's resentment of past Saudi in-
 terference in Yemen on behalf of tribal leader s.
 In a further effort to assuage the Yemenis, the
 Saudis reportedly may replace their ambassador in Sana. He has
 alienated many Yemeni officials with his cavalier treatment of
 them.
 Soviet officials probably are apprehensive about what
 the reconciliation would mean for their position in Yemen. Al-
 though closer Yemeni ties to Saudi Arabia would work against
 Soviet interests, Hamdi is not likely to dispense completely
 with Soviet aid and advice any time soon.

 Leftist-oriented Yemenis also will see the moves to-
 war   reconciliation as a victory for conservatism, but there
 is little they can effectively do to block the agreement. One
 leftist minister reportedly has resigned in protest.
 Although the rapprochement currently appears to be
 on  :Lrm ground, previous efforts to reconcile Hamdi and Ahmar
 have failed, and the long history of enmity between the two
 will make an agreement difficult to sustain.
 SYRIA: Relations with Iraq
 Syria recently has made several attempts to re-
 pa2r re a tons with Iraq as part of an apparent effort to pre-
 pare the ground for improving relations with "rejectionist"
 Arabs should Middle East peace negotiations falter. President
 Asad is anxious to keep all his options open and probably be-
 lieves that the appearance of improving relations with Iraq
 will also strengthen his bargaining position in peace negotia-
 tions. Iraq has not responded, and the longstanding enmity be-
 tween the two regimes is unlikely to abate so long as Asad re-
 mains willing to negotiate with Israel.
 The Syrian press,  for instance, has not responded to
 Iraqi propaganda attacks in recent weeks and has avoided com-
 ment on the expulsion of a Syrian diplomat from Baghdad. A
 Syrian cabinet official recently told the US Ambassador that
 Syria made an overture to Iraq during the Arab foreign minis-
 ters' meeting in Cairo in early September. Other Syrian offi-
 cials have indicated that Damascus is attempting to accommodate
 Iraqi positions on international questions that are of no di-
 rect interest to Syria.

 Syria's friendly gestures do not mean that Asad is
 moving toward severing ties with his moderate allies in Saudi
 Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt. Asad, however, would like to in-
 crease his leverage with the moderates and may have decided
 that he has nothing to lose at this point by attempting closer
 ties with his more radical neighbor.
 //Much depends at this point on whether Syria
 can tolerate Iraq's continued rebuffs.  Syria is not accustomed
 to the role of suitor, and Iraq is showing little interest in
 a courtship. The Iraqi press continues to flay Syria, and the
 Iraqi regime still supports anti-Asad factions within Syria and
 anti-Syrian groups in Lebanon.//
 USSR: Report to the Supreme Soviet
 Soviet President Brezhnev's report to the Supreme
 5ovzet yesterday was primarily ceremonial and contained little
 substance. During the next three days, more than 1,500 deputies
 will be discussing amendments to the new Soviet constitution.
 Brezhnev reported that the Constitutional Commission
 had recommended amending 110 of the 173 articles in the draft
 constitution and adding one new article.
 the new article would define the duties of
 the president's first deputy--a new position called for in the
 draft constitution first published in June. Under both the old
 and the new constitutions,  there are to be 15 presidential
 deputies, one from each republic.
 As if to demonstrate that the national "debate" had
 itself exemplified the democracy promised in the new constitu-
 tion, Brezhnev discussed at length highlights of suggestions
 adopted or rejected by the commission. Citing numerous letters
 sent by Soviet citizens, he devoted considerable attention to
 certain "incorrect" proposals. The rejected proposals included
 suggestions for the elimination of private plots of land and
 the abolition of the union and autonomous republics, the home-
 lands of the different nationalities of the USSR.
 Brezhnev cited nine Western newspapers by name in
 defending the rights provisions of the constitution against
 alleged Western criticism. He referred sarcastically to the

 "concern" for human rights shown by "prominent leaders of the
 capitalist world." He also spoke of foreign attacks "from the
 left," which he attributed to bourgeois commentators and "some
 comrades in the ranks of the international. working-class move-
 ment along with them," a mild but clear allusion to West Euro-
 pean Communists.
 USSR: Retirement Age Discussion
 The Soviets may be considering raising retirement
 ages to help offset an anticipated labor shortage in the 1980s.
 Recent arguments in the Soviet press for increasing retirement
 ages are being met with counter-arguments that early retirement
 is an advantage of the Soviet system that should be maintained.
 The Soviet labor force grew at an average annual rate
 of 1.7 percent in the 1970s.  It will grow at less than 0.5 per-
 cent annually in the first half of the 1980s because of the de-
 cline in birth rates in the 1960s.
 The USSR can no longer rely entirely on past remedies--
 such as drawing on surplus rural labor to work in urban indus-
 trial areas--to meet its manpower requirements. There are fewer
 redundant workers in the rural areas now, and most of the in-
 crease in the labor force during the next decade will be among
 the Turkic Peoples of Soviet Central Asia, who have consistently
 resisted migrating to labor-short industrial areas in the Euro-
 pean USSR.
 The current press debate marks the first time that
 changing the retirement age has been mentioned since the first
 old-age pensions were authorized in the late 1920s,  allowing
 men to retire at age 60 and women at 55.  In the past, there
 have only been suggestions for raising the participation rates
 of retired workers,  including increasing their part-time em-
 ployment opportunities,  improving their working conditions,
 and increasing financial incentives for retirees.
 One side of the current debate argues that increased
 life expectancy and improved health are grounds for assuming
 that the pension age should be increased in the future. Soviet
 life expectancy at birth has increased from 47 years in 1939
 to about 70 years now. The countering argument states that

 Approved For Release 2008/02/14: CIA-RDP79T00975A030300010094-1
 early retirement is an advantage of the Soviet system that
 should be maintained and even codified in the new constitution
 that is soon to go into effect.
 No action has been taken yet, but this debate, to-
 gether with the recurrent theme of "better health and longer
 life expectancy" running throughout all suggestions for in-
 creased utilization of retirement-age workers, may be indica-
 tive of attempts to prepare the people for a statutory increase
 in the retirement age.
 Notably lacking from this debate: is any consideration
 of the impact of changing the retirement age. Any increase in
 the retirement age would provide only a one-time boost to labor
 force growth, while annual additions to the labor force will
 continue to decline well into the 1990s
 CHINA-CAMBODIA:  Pol Pot's Trip Ends
 Cambodian Prime Minister and Communist Party  leader
 Pol Pot left China for North Korea yesterday, concluding a
 seven-day visit to Peking. The Chinese, who lavished their
 highest level treatment on the visitor, promised to  "spare no
 effort" in developing relations with Cambodia--apparently sig-
 naling promises of continued Chinese assistance.
 The Chinese, already pleased by Pol Pot's distinct
 coolness toward the Soviet Union, were undoubtedly gratified
 to hear him publicly air his adherence to Mao Tse-tung's revo-
 lutionary teachings during his visit. China's ideological pre-
 tensions recently have been under attack by Albania, and the
 Chinese have been seeking support from other Communist parties.
 The Chinese also welcomed the Cambodian move to be
 somewhat less secretive about party-to-party relations. The
 absence of routine public communications had led to speculation
 in the Western press that relations between the two countries
 were cooling.

 VENEZUELA: Counterinsurgency
 The inability of Venezuela's best counterin-
 surgency units to deal with guerrilla activities in the eastern
 part of the country is causing increasing concern in Caracas.
 //President Perez recently met with the heads
 of various military and National Guard units involved in coun-
 tering insurgency and demanded that they stop the guerrilla ac-
 tivities. Perez and his security advisers do not believe that
 the extremists threaten the government, but regard them as a
 continuing political embarrassment that must be eliminated.//
 Military officers are disgruntled :because they be-
 lieve their hands are tied by strict instructions to respect
 the human rights of suspected insurgents.

 Unless the government chooses to launch a major of-
 fensive in eastern Venezuela, it will be difficult to bring the
 guerrilla situation under control. Although there are at most
 only 120 to 150 insurgents,  they operate in mobile, widely
 scattered bands in sparsely populated, hilly terrain where con-
 cealment is easy and where isolated ranches and settlements of-
 fer ready access to food and supplies.
 In dealing with this problem, Perez faces   a dilemma.
 For the past several months, government officials have been de-
 nying that any problem exists. The opposition, calling atten-
 tion to the discrepancy between government. statements and what
 is being widely reported in the press, is demanding that the

 Somalia's official policy that the fighting is being conducted
 //Siad will probably maintain an uncompromising
 position towar     Ethiopia. He may also declare that Somalia does
 not intend to pursue its irredentist claim against Kenya--a
 declaration unlikely to appease the Kenyans, who believe their
 northeastern region will be Siad's next target.
 East Germany
 East Germany is preparing to mark its national holi-
 day on Friday with a larger than normal military parade in
 East Berlin including units of the East German Army. The East
 Germans intend the parade to reinforce their claim of "sover-
 eignty" over East Berlin.

 The presence of regular army units in East Berlin
 wou     e a violation of the four-power agreements on the de-
 militarized status of greater Berlin, but this has occurred
 frequently in the past. As usual,  the East Germans will proba-
 bly ignore Western protests.
 Earlier this year,  the East Germans dispensed with
 military ceremonies on May Day, making their country the last
 in Eastern Europe to do so and planned their military extrava-
 ganza for 7 October.
 Zaire and several large international banks still
 have not reached agreement on the terms of a major new loan.
 A US bank has failed to syndicate a five-year loan, and Zaire
 so far has rejected the bank's alternative offer of a 180-day
 revolving credit.
 The $250-million medium-term loan was first proposed
 a year ago at a meeting held to reschedule Zaire's debts to
 private banks. The loan was to hinge initially on Zaire's
 progress in meeting certain economic conditions laid down by
 the banks.  Zaire has since complied with these conditions. Ear-
 lier this year, however,  the loan syndication was postponed
 pending settlement of the fighting in Shaba Region.
 In rejecting the proposal for a revolving credit,
 Kinshasa has argued in part that this alternative would be con-
 trary to conditions agreed to with Zaire's; Government creditors
 in. debt rescheduling negotiations earlier this year.  If no agree-
 ment on a new loan is reached with the banks, a round of private
 debt rescheduling may result. Many of Zaire's bank creditors
 reportedly are willing to refinance or reschedule a significant
 portion of the country's private debt.
