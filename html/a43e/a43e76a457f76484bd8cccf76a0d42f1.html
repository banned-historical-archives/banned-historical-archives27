 EGYPT-USSR
 Egyptian Foreign Minister Fahmi may
 be planning a trip to Moscow soon,
 possibly as early as next week.
 Although Fahmi's deputy denied to the
 US embassy on October 18 any
 knowledge of a visit, an American jour-
 nalist says he learned from another "high
 official" that the visit is in the offing.
 President Sadat has been under oc-
 casional pressure from Fahmi and other
 advisers to improve ties with the Soviets
 in order both to counter the impression
 that Egypt is wholly dependent on the US
 and to induce Moscow to resume
 deliveries of military equipment. Neither
 the Soviets nor the Egyptians, however,
 have followed through with any moves
 toward a significant easing of tensions.
 Throughout the past summer, Sadat
 repeatedly attacked the Soviets in public
 statements, often linking them to Libya's
 subversive actions in Egypt and elsewhere
 in the Arab world. Cairo may now feel it
 advisable to reopen the channel to
 Moscow in the period before the US
 presidential election.
 The Egyptians are counting on the US
 to resume negotiations with Israel next
 year on a Middle East settlement and to
 consider substantial military aid for
 Egypt. They probably hope to restore a
 degree of amicability in their relations
 with the USSR, however, lest diplomatic
 and military assistance from the US not
 materialize.
 Egypt no doubt expects little from the
 recent Soviet proposal to reconvene the
 Middle East peace conference at Geneva,
 but the Egyptians will want to appear to
 be supporting it in order to maintain
 pressure on the US to recommence peace
 negotiations.
 RHODESIA 5-
 The British have delayed until October
 28 the start of the Geneva conference on
 the formation of an interim government in
 Rhodesia to allow the participants more
 time to prepare.
 The "front-line" African presidents and
 the Rhodesian nationalists are still in-
 sisting publicly that the conference must
 effect an immediate transfer of power to
 the black majority and that Britain must
 play a major role in Rhodesia during the
 transition period.  Rhodesian Prime
 Minister Smith, on the other hand, con-
 tinues to maintain that the settlement
 terms he anpounced last month are non-
 ~, 4      Egypt Seeking Financial Support
 Egypt is trying to muster an additional
 $1 billion in balance-of-payments support
 to prevent a substantial cutback in im-
 ports and consumption in the coming
 months.
 Last year, Arab cash aid covered about
 two thirds of Egypt's $3-billion external
 financial gap. Only about $1 billion in
 Arab aid has been disbursed so far this
 year, and unless more cash aid is received
 over the next two months Egypt may be
 forced to cut back drastically on imports
 of food, consumer durable goods, and in-
 dustrial inputs.
 Egypt has postponed payment on many
 of its foreign debts to free cash for needed
 imports. Last month, debt service arrears
 totaled $700 million-equivalent to 70
 percent of the balance-of-payments finan-
 cing that Cairo is still seeking for 1976.
 During the last several years, Egypt's
 creditors have tolerated periodic delays in
 repayment on the assumption that Arab
 aid would be forthcoming. Now, with
 both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait adver-
 tising their dissatisfaction with Egyptian
 financial practices, creditor patience is
 waning. US banks reportedly are re-
 luctant  to  refinance  even  relatively
 small $1-million to $10-million 180-
 day credits.
 The newly established Gulf Organiza-
 tion for Development in Egypt may
 provide half the sum that is needed this
 year. The organization probably will
 guarantee $250 million in Western bank
 loans and has offered an additional $250
 million in direct balance-of-payments
 support, although negotiations have bog-
 ged down.
 Egypt also hopes Iran will provide $250
 million in loan guarantees. If all these
 funds materialize, the remaining shortfall
 could be financed with a rollover of
 short-term debt or continued deferment of
 repayments.
 Egypt's balance-of-payments problems
 will continue into 1977 even if Cairo ob-
 tains the credits it is seeking. Population
 growth and investment under the five-year
 plan probably will inflate imports, and ex-
 ports will be hampered by capacity con-
 straints and Israeli harassment of offshore
 oil development,

 ZANU President Ndabaningi Sithole (r) at recent meeting in Dar es Salaam
 with President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania
 Earlier this week, the
 British belatedly invited Sithole to par-
 ticipate in the Geneva meetings at the re-
 quest of the "front-line" presidents.
 Sithole, although the founder of
 ZANU, has lost influence within the
 Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti and
 Communist Party chief Enrico Berlinguer
 both sought this week to rally support
 from their respective parties for the
 government's new economic program in
 the face of a further assault on the lira and
 continuing labor unrest over proposed
 new austerity measures.
 Andreotti told a meeting of the Chris-
 tian Democratic directorate on October
 18 that, while he would accept some
 modification of individual measures in
 Parliament, he would resign if the
 stabilization program as a whole were
 seriously challenged. The directorate, like
 the party's national council before it,
 passed  a  resolution unanimously ap-
 proving the government's actions.
 Addressing a meeting of the Com-
 munist Party central committee that was
 marked by dissension over Communist
 cooperation with Andreotti, Berlinguer
 suggested that the Communists have no
 alternative but to abstain on the govern-
 ment program. A vote against the
 program, he implied, would be irresponsi-
 ble and would bring the economy to the
 brink of ruin, with grave consequences for
 Italian workers.
 The Communists, by virtue of their
 parliamentary strength and their impor-
 tant assets in the labor sector, have
 become Andreotti's strongest ally in his
 struggle to gain acceptance for the
 stabilization measures. Last week, Com-
 munist   Party  and  labor  officials
 spearheaded a joint effort with Christian
 Democratic and Republican labor leaders
 to head off a nationwide general strike.
 Although the general strike was averted,
 localized work stoppages are being held
 to dramatize the workers' displeasure.
 Despite an apparent realization among
 major labor leaders that the stabilization
 measures are needed, Andreotti's task
 remains gargantuan. When a two-week
 emergency surcharge on foreign currency
 purchases was lifted on October 18, the
 lira plummeted, prompting strong in-
 tervention by the Bank of Italy. The lira's
 future remains cloudy, and most brokers
 are forecasting further depreciation in
 the coming weeks. At the Italian stock
 exchange, the index hit a 19-year low.
 Despite the new stabilization measures,
 Italy will soon have to seek additional
 credits abroad. An Italian delegation is
 expected at the International Monetary

 POLAND l ~_Z
 Dissident intellectuals are keeping
 pressure on the Gierek regime on behalf
 of workers who have suffered reprisals for
 their part in the demonstrations last June.
 The US embassy in Warsaw believes this
 campaign has been effective.
 Last month, the intellectuals organized
 a "Workers Defense League," which
 issued an "Appeal to the People and
 Authorities in Poland." The document,
 signed by 14 well-known intellectuals,
 declared that the workers have been
 brutally persecuted for making demands
 that, in fact, were backed by almost all
 Poles. The appeal said that the only way
 to defend the workers successfully is to
 publicize government injustices.
 In a subsequent "communique," the
 League alleged that 126 persons had been
 penalized by imprisonment or loss of jobs
 at Ursus and that 25 persons had been
 killed and more than 2,000 jailed in
 Radom. These figures are much higher
 than those reported before.
 The communique presented a financial
 statement for the League listing donations
 received and the amounts needed to sup-
 port jobless families. One dissident told a
 US embassy officer that door-to-door
 solicitations are being made and that
 money is coming in through the mail.
 Some members are reportedly optimistic
 about the chances of civil liberties being
 recognized in Poland. Others, however,
 are warning that it is only the regime's
 weakness in the face of an impatient and
 unpredictable population that forces it to
 tolerate this kind of activity.
 The Polish regime has shown itself sen-
 sitive to the criticism. In September, the
 Supreme Court revoked the sentences of
 seven workers who were given 3- to
 I0-year jail terms for their part in the Ur-
 sus demonstrations, and the regime has
 postponed or canceled further trials.
 Last week, party leader Gierek reacted
 sharply to "opponents" who, he said,
 close their eyes to Polish achievements
 European Currency Float

 protectors of national sovereignty, and
 even of the economic and social rights of
 the  working  people."
 USSR       p J, ~ 1
 The USSR Supreme Soviet is sched-
 uled to convene on October 27. Sessions
 usually last one or two days. The meeting
 is expected to approve the new five-year
 plan, which was presented in skeletal form
 to the party congress last spring. It will
 also approve the annual plan and budget
 for 1977. If protocol is followed, Premier
 Kosygin will address the meeting and pre-
 sent the plan.
 The Supreme Soviet gathering, and the
 more important meeting of the party's
 Central Committee that will precede it,
 will provide opportunities to announce
 changes in the leadership. Reports that
 Kosygin is recuperating from a heart at-
 tack or stroke have intensified speculation
 about possible important shifts at the
 coming meetings, but in the past the
 leadership has repeatedly passed by op-
 portunities to make major changes.
 General Secretary Brezhnev told Am-
 bassador Averell Harriman last month
 that Kosygin would be returning to work
 "in several weeks." Last week, in his first
 public appearance since July 22, Kosygin
 greeted Mongolian party chief Tsedenbal
 at Moscow airport.
 Among the party shifts that may be an-
 nounced at the Central Committee
 plenum is the promotion to the Politburo
 of Nikolay Tikhonov, who was recently
 appointed first deputy premier, possibly
 to lighten Kosygin's workload. Another is
 the formal dropping of Defense Minister
 Ustinov from the party Secretariat, a
 move normally required by a ministerial
 appointment. Ustinov, a membe1_QLtlie
 The readjustment last weekend in the
 parities at which the currencies of the
 members of the European joint float are
 officially maintained against one another
 was probably a compromise solution. The
 West German mark was revalued 2 per-
 cent against the Belgian franc and the
 Dutch guilder, 3 percent against the
 Swedish and the Norwegian crowns, and 6
 percent against the Danish crown.
 By minimizing parity changes within
 the snake, Belgium and the other smaller
 members are trying to avoid some of the
 costs of their more expansionary domestic
 policies. West Germany is in essence
 forced to pick up part of the bill for
 these policies in the form of higher import
 costs and support of the other members'
 currencies in the exchange market. In
 return for agreeing to small rate changes,
 West  Germany  probably exacted
 promises of closer economic policy coor-
 dination from its snake partners.
 Although the mark revaluation may
 have a psychological impact, it may not
 have lasting economic effects. Since the
 last mark revaluation in June 1973, the
 economic performances of the snake
 members have diverged more than the 2
 to 6 percent of the latest realignment.
 The new realignment made up less than
 one third of the difference in price in-
 creases between West Germany and the
 other joint float members since mid-1973.
 Moreover,  inflationary  pressures  still
 diverge widely. For example, wages are
 increasing three times as fast, on an
 average, in the five smaller joint float
 members than in West Germany.
 The exchange markets are pessimistic
 about the realignment. Bankers and
 currency traders seem to think a change
 of two to three times the magnitude of the
 one made would be necessary to reflect
 economic  reality.

 been actively seeking alternative port
 facilities in the Mediterranean. During a
 visit to Yugoslavia in August, Soviet navy
 commander Admiral Gorshkov discussed
 the use of Yugoslav ports for repair of
 Soviet ships.
 Even if the use of Yugoslav facilities for
 Soviet naval repairs is expanded
 somewhat, it cannot adequately compen-
 sate for denial of access to the Alexandria
 facilities. The Egyptians permitted the
 Soviets free access to the large and
 well-equipped shipyard that they used for
 major repairs; it is unlikely the Yugoslavs
 would agree to such an arrangement.
 the number and type
 of Soviet ships under repair in Yugoslav
 shipyards may exceed what is permissible
 under Yugoslav maritime law, which,
 among other things, prohibits the repair
 of naval ships in commercial ports. Three
 Soviet naval auxiliaries-all apparently
 declared as merchant ships-have recent-
 ly been under repair at two commercial
 ports. Two of them are still undergoing
 repairs.
 Two Soviet warships have been un-
 dergoing repairs in Tivat, a designated
 naval shipyard, for several months. A
 third ship spent  18 days there in
 September either under repair or visiting.
 According to the law, not more than two
 naval ships from the same country may be
 repaired at one port simultaneously. The
 same law restricts visits by foreign naval
 ships to the ports of Split, Rijeka, and
 Dubrovnik and sets a time limit of 10
 days.

 USSR-CHINA 2,f -z,7
 Last week, the Soviet "journalist" Vic-
 tor Louis wrote an article for France-Soir
 expressing Moscow's delight over the
 ouster of China's leftists, particularly
 Mao's widow, Chiang Ching. The article
 was almost certainly authorized at a high
 level.
 Louis' main point was that if China's
 moderates are inclined toward less hostile
 relations with the USSR, they should give
 some positive sign to Moscow within the
 next month. He mentioned "new" an-
 ti-Soviet statements by the Chinese
 leadership, implying that a decrease of
 such propaganda would be one ap-
 propriate signal.
 In a disingendous'invitation to China to
 profit from the alleged political alignment
 in the USSR, Louis asserts that older
 Soviet leaders are inclined to give the
 Chinese more time to sort themselves out
 but are under pressure from younger, less
 "sentimental"  officials.  Louis implied
 that this could be China's last chance to
 prevent hard liners in the USSR from get-
 ting  Moscow to  make "irreversible"
 decisions on China.
 Louis also made a blatant appeal to
 China's older military men whom he
 credited with appreciating the Soviet role
 in  China's development and Soviet
 military might.
 By publicly setting a time limit and
 making thinly veiled threats about irrever-
 sible decisions, the Louis article is certain-
 ly not conciliatory.
 The
 Soviets may
 calculate,
 however,
 that
 the Chinese
 25X1
 moderates
 will be
 more
 responsive to
 pressure now that they are unencumbered
 by the ideologues. The Soviets must be
 aware of reports over the years that some
 moderates favor less confrontational tac-
 tics in dealing with the USSR.
 The Soviet tack worked once before. In
 August 1969, an article by Louis about
 the possibility of a pre-emptive Soviet
 strike on China's nascent nuclear force
 was undoubtedly a factor in China's deci-
 sion to agree to the Sino-Soviet summit in
 1969 and to participate in border talks.

 CHINA >b ,2)
 There has still been no official an-
 nouncement of the appointment of Hua
 Kuo-feng to succeed Mao Tse-tung or the
 arrest of the four leading leftists on the
 Politburo. The Chinese people are ob-
 viously aware of both moves, and the
 purge of the leftists has prompted
 responses in several major cities.
 Posters denouncing the leftists have
 appeared in some cities, especially in the
 leftist stronghold of Shanghai, and rallies
 supporting the arrests have been held in
 some areas. The most vicious of the poster
 attacks seem to be reserved for Mao's
 widely hated widow, Chiang Ching.
 Some local officials in Shanghai are un-
 der wall poster attack for their
 relationship with the leading leftists in
 Peking, three of whom come from
 Shanghai. A roundup of other leftists has
 extended to those areas where the left was
 most influential-in the fields of
 propaganda, education, and culture.
 No official charges have been made
 public against the leftists, but a People's
 Daily editorial of October 19 seemed to
 lay the groundwork for a charge-used
 widely in the wall posters-that the left
 was plotting a coup. The editorial at-
 tacked unnamed persons who tried to
 "usurp party leadership." An official
 Chinese news release made a pointed
 reference to Chiang Ching in an attack on
 "snake-like scoundrels"  who disguise
 themselves as beautiful girls.
 The move against the left may already
 be having beneficial effects on those who
 were in political trouble during the an-
 tirightist campaign before Mao's death.
 The minister of railways, who was
 allegedly dismissed during that campaign,
 has reportedly resumed his duties. Other
 Chinese officials are now acting with
 growing confidence.
 The minister of foreign trade apologiz-

 would change for the better and trade
 would progress. The foreign trade policy
 had been under attack during the an-

 THAILAND  ~ 4- 4
 Thailand's ruling National Ad-
 ministrative Reform Council shows in-
 creasing signs of splintering into rival
 cliques. The ambitious General Yot, dep-
 uty army commander and recent comman-
 der of the First Army, is largely respon-
 sible. He has been maneuvering with his
 First Army colleagues for a dominant
 position in the Council. Admiral Sa-
 ngat, chairman of the Council, clearly
 fears he is losing control.
 In his efforts to move the military into
 the background,Sa-ngat has the support
 of army commander General Soem, but
 Soem himself appears to have little in-
 fluence in the First Army. The support of
 this unit, which is located in the Bangkok
 area, is crucial to any future regime. For
 the moment, Yot's attempts to dominate
 the Council are restrained by Soem's rank-
 ing position and by the apparent support
 of the other regional commanders for
 Sa-ngat.
 Sa-ngat hopes to frustrate Yot's per-
 sonal ambitions by putting together a
 civilian administration rapidly. A cabinet
 has been appointed, heavily weighted with
 technocrats, and the new foreign minister,
 Upadit  Pachariyangkun-now  am-
 bassador in Washington-apparently was
 chosen with an eye toward fostering better
 relations with the US.
 New     Prime Minister Thanin
 thoroughly   aired   his   twin
 obsessions-communism and corrup-
 tion-in his initial speeches to the nation,25X1
 and the ruling military council has already
 launched a purge of leftist activists. The
 left's potential for making trouble is fairly
 limited, and although the roundup has
 been more restrained than press coverage
 would suggest, it is a campaign alien to
 Thai tradition. If carried to excess, it
 could swing public opinion against the
 government. Few abuses by security
 forces have come to light, but the oppor-
 tunity for settling private scores as well as
 for graft is obvious.                 25X1

 CANADA  45- 5)
 Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau en-
 countered bad news on every front this
 week. A Gallup poll released last weekend
 showed  that  opposition  Progressive
 Conservative leader Joe Clark was
 favored nationally over Trudeau by 36
 percent to 28 percent. The poll under-
 mined the Liberals' hope that Trudeau
 remained the choice of the people and
 could make up for the party's lack of
 appeal.
 The victories of the Progressive Conser-
 vatives in two federal by-elections on Oc-
 tober 18 underscored the extent of pop-
 cgs
 ular dissatisfaction with both the Liberals
 and Trudeau. The loss of a seat in New-
 foundland was expected, but loss of the
 Ottawa-Carleton seat-which the Tories
 had not won for 94 years-was especially
 damaging.
 Another gesture of nonconfidence in
 Trudeau's policies was Quebec Liberal
 Premier Bourassa's announcement on Oc-
 tober 18 that there will be a provincial
 election next month. Bourassa obviously
 believes he must act now before the
 national Liberal Party's sagging fortunes
 and Quebec's deteriorating economy
 work to undermine seriously his own pop-
 ularity. Bourassa had earlier indicated
 that he would go to the electorate if
 Trudeau did not forcefully advocate
 protection for French language interests.
 Although the election will not be held
 until November 15, both the Liberals and
 the separatist Parti Quebecois have been
 uPs
 on the campaign trail for the past two
 weeks.
 CUBA

 Speaking on October 15 at a mass rally
 in Havana to pay tribute to the victims of
 the bombing of a Cuban airliner, Prime
 Minister Fidel Castro charged that the
 US was directly involved. He offered to
 discuss a solution to the terrorist problem
 with the US, but said that such a discus-
 sion could only take place if there is a
 "definitive end"  to all hostile and
 aggressive acts against Cuba.
 Castro said the US is incapable of
 fulfilling the spirit and letter of the 1973
 bilateral agreement on hijacking, and he
 announced his decision to terminate it as
 of April 15, 1977. He asserted, however,
 that if a US commercial plane is hijacked
 to Cuba after the agreement expires,
 Cuba would return the aircraft, crew, and
 passengers to the US and would not "put
 up with" the hijackers.
 He also said Cuba would continue to
 honor  fully  the similar bilateral
 agreements now in force with Canada,
 Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela.

 Castro's renunciation of the agreement
 with the US appears to be little more than
 a symbolic gesture designed to impress
 the Cuban public and to put pressure on
 the US to take action against Cuban exile
 terrorists. The flimsiness of his charges
 that the CIA was involved in the bombing
 suggests that he finds the accusation
 merely another convenient means of ex-
 erting leverage on the US.
 Castro also made a point of absolving
 the Venezuelan government of any blame
 in the bombing incident. His detailed
 description of the role that Venezuelan
 citizens and Cuban exiles in Venezuela
 played in the bombing, however, and his
 comment on the access some exiles have
 to "certain political circles" in Venezuela
 were probably intended to stress that
 Cuba takes a dim view of the support and
 freedom of action militant exiles have in
 Venezuela.
 The speech leaves the impression that
 Castro, frustrated by a string of terrorist
 incidents that have cost the lives of almost
 80 people since last April, is seeking a
 means of putting a stop to the violence.

 Cuban government along lines set down at

 Party appears in the feature section of this

 Prime Minister/ lr'urnham of Guyana
 sharply criticized the US in a major
 speech honoring the victims of the Cuban
 air crash off Barbados last week.
 Burnham stopped short of accusing the
 US of complicity in the terrorist act that
 claimed the lives of I I Guyanese, but in-
 sinuated that the US government was at
 least morally responsible because of its
 support for Cuban exile organizations.
 The Prime Minister also used the occa-
 sion to repeat allegations that since 1972
 the US has tried to deter Guyana from
 having friendly relations with Cuba and
 embarking on its own "socialist" path. He
 repeated charges that Guyana is threaten-
 ed by a campaign of "destabilization."
 Burnham  seemed  to  invite
 demonstrations against the US embassy
 when he warned that "those who
 perpetrate violence must now expect they
 will have violence visited upon them." We
 have no evidence, however, that the
 government is planning a campaign of
 harassment or violence against the em-
 bassy or its personnel.
 The  Prime  Minister's emotional
 language reflected in part the fact that the
 Guyanese victims were people he had per-
 sonally selected for training in Cuba. He
 was also irritated by what he considered
 an inadequate effort by the US in curbing
 exile activities.
 Burnham's  speech  strongly
 demonstrated the Guyanese leader's in-
 creasing obsession with his personal
 security and fears that he and other
 government officials are targets for

 Despite the Prime Minister's tough
 talk, he probably realizes that in the
 absence of significant economic and
 financial assistance from his socialist

 principally from the US, to finance
 economic development and to secure bad-
 ly needed food crop loans.

 President Qadhaft's effort to make Libya a major military
 power in the Middle East has resulted in a massive accumula-
 tion of weaponry-and little else. The armed forces are so un-
 dermanned and poorly trained that they cannot even maintain
 much of their sophisticated equipment.
 P,S
 Libya: Military Program
 President Qadhafi wants to create a
 modern, powerful military that will
 enable Libya to exercise major influence
 in the Middle East, and he has sufficient
 oil revenues to purchase seemingly endless
 quantities of arms. About half of the six
 to eight billion dollars a year that Libya
 receives for its petroleum is spent on
 economic development projects, leaving
 more than ample funds for making
 whatever military purchases Qadhafi
 wants.
 In recent years, Qadhafi has increasing-
 ly turned to the USSR as his major arms
 supplier. A 1974 arms deal, worth at least
 $730 million, has already provided more
 Soviet arms than the Libyan armed forces
 can use, and substantial amounts remain
 to be delivered. The contract includes
 medium tanks, armored personnel
 carriers,  artillery,  MIG-23 fighters,
 TU-22 medium bombers, naval craft, and
 surface-to-air and Scud missiles.
 East European deliveries since 1974 ac-
 count for an additional $110 million in
 equipment, including well over 400 tanks
 from Czechoslovakia and Poland.
 In addition to Soviet and East Euro-
 pean arms, Libya has purchased some
 $970 million in equipment from Western
 nations in the past two and a half years.
 Italian corvettes, French guided-missile
 patrol boats, Spanish-built submarines,
 and French Mirage F-I fighters make up
 the bulk of the total value. This equip-
 ment should be delivered within the next
 five years.
 In pursuit of his military program,
 Qadhafi has made the Libyan armed
 forces the most heavily equipped in North
 Africa. Libya may eventually match or
 even surpass Egypt in numbers of tanks
 and modern jet fighters.
 The rapid growth in Libya's arms in-
 ventory, however, has not been matched
 by an equivalent advance in the numbers
 or capabilities of its armed forces per-
 sonnel. The undermanned and poorly
 trained Libyan military remains ineffec-
 tive as a combat force. A severe shortage
 of trained, experienced technicians makes

 it virtually impossible for Libya to main-
 tain much of the modern weaponry that it
 purchases.
 As a result, Libya's ability to affect the
 outcome of any future Arab-Israeli war
 by direct use of its military forces will be
 limited, although it could play a role as a
 supplier of military equipment. Of more
 immediate concern to Qadhafi is the fact
 that his weapons acquisitions have done
 little to alter Libya's strategic military in-
 feriority to Egypt, while exacerbating
 Egypt's suspicions about the intentions of
 its volatile neighbor.
 The Army
 The army is the dominant military ser-
 vice and the primary recipient of the arms
 buildup. At the time of King Idris' ouster
 25X1    in 1969, the Libyan army had 6 tanks,
 some 100 armored personnel carriers, and
 about 35 field guns.
 Libya now has over 1,    m  ium
 tanks, nearly 1,100 armored personnel
 carriers, and about 200 artillery pieces.
 The approximately 25,000-man army,
 currently organized into five combat
 brigades, is not large enough to absorb
 this equipment. As a result, most of the
 tanks and over half of the armored per-
 sonnel carriers are in storage.
 Poor training compounds the army's
 lack of personnel to use its modern equip-
 ment and attain a high level of combat
 proficiency. There are indications that the
 army has difficulty finding adequate
 numbers of qualified instructors, a
 problem that will worsen as the army ex-
 pands.
 The Libyan army also suffers from an
 inefficient logistic system. The main
 storage depots in Benghazi and Tripoli
 contain ample reserves of most items of
 equipment and probably sufficient
 supplies of ammunition and spare parts.
 The haphazard distribution system and a
 poor transportation network make it im-
 possible to move large amounts of
 supplies quickly, and the Libyans would
 have problems adequately resupplying un-
 its in the field.
 The Soviets could provide much of the
 assistance the Libyan army needs to solve
 its training and logistic problems, but
 Qadhafi deeply distrusts the Soviets and
 will not allow Soviet military advisers to
 work with the Libyan army.
 The Air Force
 The Libyan air force, which had some
 10 combat planes in 1969, now possesses
 nearly 190 jet fighters, bombers, and
 trainers. Libya has received 57 MIG-23
 fighters, the most modern fighter aircraft
 the USSR now exports. This is more than
 double the number of MIG-23s sold
 Egypt.  Of  Middle  East  countries,
 only Iraq, with 83, has received more
 MIG-23s. We do not know how many
 more MIG-23s Tripoli may have on order.
 The Libyans also have some 95 Mirage
 5 aircraft, ordered from France in the ear-
 ly 1970s,
 Soviet-built TU-22 jet bombers;
 Out of an estimated 4,000 Libyan air
 force personnel, only about 80 to 100
 pilots are jet qualified, and less than a
 quarter of them probably are qualified to
 fly in combat. The air force already has
 more combat aircraft than it can use.
 Monthly flying time is scarcely sufficient
 to meet safety standards and maintain
 basic skills, much less to develop expertise
 in combat maneuvers. Training is almost
 always conducted in daylight during good
 weather and seldom under realistic com-
 bat conditions.
 The air force probably can perform
 some ground-controlled intercepts and air
 combat maneuvers, but it does not have
 an effective overall air defense or ground
 support capability.
 ya must rely heavily on foreign
 technicians-mainly French, Soviet, and
 Pakistani-to maintain its aircraft. The
 proportion of Libyan aircraft in commis-
 sion at a given time is low.
 In addition to an insufficient number of
 foreign technicians,  Libyan aircraft
 maintenance is hampered by limited
 repair facilities and difficulty in procuring
 spare parts for some of the Western air-
 craft. For several months, Libya has been

 navy's combat capabilities substantially in
 the near future. The navy has only 2,700
 men, and some units reportedly are un-
 derstrength. It must compete with the
 other services for the already limited
 supply of manpower; adding new ships
 will only aggravate personnel shortages.
 As with the other services, the navy suf-
 fers from inadequate training. Libya also
 lacks major naval support facilities, and it
 probably will be several years before
 planned expansion and improvements of
 installations can be implemented. For the
 foreseeable future, the navy will have only
 a limited capability to perform even a
 coastal defense mission.
 The Air Defense Forces
 The air defense command was es-
 tablished as a separate branch in the early
 1970s and is still in the process of forma-
 tion. Although equipped with modern
 Soviet- and  French-designed surface-
 to-air missiles and Soviet antiaircraft ar-
 tillery, the command has not attained a
 high degree of combat proficiency. It is
 handicapped by a lack of trained per-
 sonnel, poor coordination with the army
 and air force, and the fact that much of
 the newer equipment is not operational.
 Military Outlook
 It is unlikely that the Libyan armed
 forces will ever become strong enough to
 put Libya on a par with such Middle East
 powers as Egypt and Syria. Continued
 deliveries of sophisticated military
 hardware, while improving Libya's
 SA-3 missiles appear in anniversary parade in Tripoli on Septembe
 holdings, also increase its maintenance
 and training problems and do little to im-
 prove force capabilities.
 Qadhafi has attempted for years to ex-
 pand his armed forces to man the growing
 stocks of Soviet and Western weaponry.
 IQadhafi is un-
 likely to succeed. Libya has a small pop-
 ulation-about 2.5 million-and few
 eligible males not already employed in es-
 sential civilian jobs have the technical
 skills needed for military service.
 Making the Soviets Libya's principal
 arms supplier also poses special problems
 for Qadhafi. Despite his distrust of
 Moscow, he may have to accept more
 Soviet advisers into Libya, or his armed
 forces will not be able to maintain and
 operate their new and expensive Soviet
 hardware adequately.
 Many Arabs, including some Libyans,
 question the wisdom of Qadhafi's large
 military purchases and foreign adven-
 turism. As the Libyan arms inventory
 grows, Qadhafi's potential as a
 dangerously destabilizing element in the
 Arab world also increases. This has tend-
 ed to isolate Libya and encourage those
 who would welcome, and support,
 Qadhafi's ouster.
 Libya stores substantial amounts of its
 unused tanks, armored personnel carriers,
 artillery, and trucks in Benghazi-offer-
 ing an equipment-short Egyptian army a
 very tempting target in the event of
 hostilities between the two quarreling
 neighbors.
 This equipment could easily be
 assimilated into the Egyptian army, and it
 would alleviate some of the problems
 caused by the cessation of Soviet aid to
 standing a determined Egyptian assault
 across northeastern Libya. Cairo would,
 however, have to add substantially to its
 two lightly armed special forces brigades
 currently in western Egypt to ensure the
 success of a major offensive in eastern

 Major changes are being made in the government's struc-
 ture. As far as the average Cuban citizen is concerned, however,
 the changes will mean little.
 Cuba: Institutionalization Progresses
 Cuba is in the final stage of restruc-
 turing its governmental apparatus in line
 with the decisions proclaimed last
 December at the first congress of the
 Cuban Communist Party.
 The changes, some six years in gesta-
 tion, are designed in theory to in-
 stitutionalize Cuba's governmental
 system and permit the Communist Party
 to perpetuate its control whoever happens
 to be Cuba's leader. In fact, however, we
 do not expect any early reduction in
 Prime Minister Fidel Castro's political
 power.
 The changes are designed also to im-
 prove administrative efficiency and to
 give the public a sense of greater control
 in local affairs. Here again, results are not
 likely to come up to expectations.
 The current phase of the process of in-
 stitutionalization began on Sunday, Oc-
 tober 10, with the election of delegates to
 people's assemblies at the municipal, the
 lowest, level. The process will come to a
 close in early December when the first
 National  People's  Assembly-the
 national  legislative authority-will be
 convened in Havana to reorganize the
 governmental leadership,  approve a
 scaled-down version of the five-year
 economic plan for 1976-80, and put a new
 constitution into effect.
 The National People's Assembly will
 appoint a Council of State to function in
 its stead when the assembly-which is
 required to meet twice annually-is not in
 session. The council will have a president
 as chairman, a first vice president, five ad-
 ditional vice presidents, 23 officers, and
 one secretary.
 Under the new constitution, which was
 approved by the party congress in
 December and by a public referendum in
 February, the president of the Council of
 State will not only be head of state and
 head of government, but will also have the
 power to take over the direction of any
 government ministry or central office and
 to assume command of the armed forces.
 Fidel Castro is not likely to entrust such a
 concentration of power to anyone but
 himself. First Deputy Prime Minister
 Raul Castro is likely to move into the new
 post of first vice president.
 Political Bureau
 Present members of the Communist
 Party's Political Bureau will most likely
 be named to the five other vice presiden-
 tial posts, and others among the party
 elite will fill the 23 other positions. The
 post of secretary, not included in the
 original plans for the council, was
 probably created specifically for Celia
 Sanchez Manduley, a confidante of Fidel
 who has served as his personal aide since
 the guerrilla days in the Sierra Maestra.
 Important posts doubtless will be found
 for Osvaldo Dorticos, now the president,
 and for Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, the pre-
 sent vice prime minister for foreign af-
 fairs-a  brilliant  administrator  and
 theoretician whose close ties to Moscow
 date back more than 30 years.
 Elsewhere within the leadership elite,
 responsibilities may change hands, but the
 faces will remain the same. Castro's loyal
 supporters from the early days of his
 political career will continue to rule, rein-
 forced by a strong representation from the
 prerevolutionary communist party.
 Farther down the chain of command
 the story may be different. Ministries and
 government agencies are probably in for
 some streamlining in the interests of
 greater efficiency, and this is likely to
 make some personnel-,officers as well as
 functionaries-surplus. In addition, some
 heads are likely to roll as Castro seeks
 scapegoats for economic problems. In-
 competent bureaucrats may well be
 sacked in favor of rising technocrats who
 have proved their mettle.
 Some government officials at the
 national level have already become
 scapegoats for the recent economic
 decline.  Four senior officials who
 negotiated contracts for Cuban purchases
 abroad were put on trial earlier this year
 for "economic crimes." They appear to
 have erred by approving a contract with a
 price escalation clause that eventually
 cost the government an additional 12 per-
 cent for Austrian irrigation equipment.
 They compounded their sin by accepting
 over the past several years the usual token
 gifts from representatives of Western
 companies at contract-signing time.
 Although the Cuban press made no
 mention of the trial, the proceedings were
 held in a hotel ballroom and recorded on
 film. Officials from other government
 agencies that deal with foreign companies
 were compelled to attend. The unfor-
 tunate  four were given 20-year
 sentences-an object lesson that will not
 be lost on the bureaucracy.
 A New Political Map
 Streamlining of the government will
 also take place below the national level.
 The current 6 provinces, 55 regions, and
 400-plus municipalities will be replaced by

 14 provinces and 169 municipalities,
 eliminating at one stroke almost 300
 governing entities. One objective is more
 efficient utilization of Cuba's scanty sup-
 ply of administrative personnel, and
 another is the creation of more
 manageable political-administrative
 jurisdictions. One unheralded result will
 be the dissolution of Oriente Province,
 known in Cuban history as the birthplace
 of revolutions.
 Because the party and the mass
 organizations are also organized accor-
 ding to the present political-ad-
 ministrative structure of the country, all
 will have to be restructured. The party's
 youth arm has scheduled a congress for
 next April to accomplish this; the
 National  Small-Farm  Owners
 Association-the mass organization for
 peasants and rural communities-will do
 it in January. No date for the party
 reorganization has been made public.
 Some officials will be promoted, but a
 large number will have their areas of
 jurisdiction reduced or eliminated
 altogether.
 The elections on October 10, the 108th
 anniversary of the beginning of Cuba's
 wars for independence, decided the ap-
 pointment of over 7,900 delegates to
 municipal assemblies, but 2,800 others
 had to await run-off elections on October
 17. On October 31, the 10,725 delegates
 will meet in their respective municpal
 people's assemblies to elect delegates to
 the assemblies at the provincial level. In
 early November they will meet a second
 time to elect deputies to the National
 People's Assembly.
 The candidates for the provincial and
 national bodies will be nominated by
 special panels made up of representatives
 of the party, its youth arm, and the mass
 organizations-belying  the  regime's
 assertion that candidates for national of-
 fice are nominated by the public at large.
 The candidates do not have to be
 municipal delegates, which provides a se-
 cond chance for those loyal to Castro who
 do not fare well in popular elections or
 who through some oversight are not
 nominated at the municipal level.
 Of the elected municipal delegates, 69
 percent are members of the party, accor-
 ding to press reports. Despite the strong
 urging of top regime leaders that women
 be well represented, only 8 percent of
 those elected are women. Voting was not
 compulsory, but strong social pressure
 resulted in a turn-out on October 10 of
 95.2 percent of the more than 5.6 million
 registered voters.
 The municipal assemblies will be
 responsible, at least in theory, for the
 operation and performance of virtually all
 government facilities, enterprises, and ser-
 vices at the local level. The provincial
 assemblies will assume pertinent respon-
 sibilities at their level. Castro has already
 warned that no one should expect this ef-
 fort. at decentralization to result in any
 dramatic improvement in government.
 Castro's warning suggests he is fearful
 that all the fanfare associated with the
 changes may have raised expectations at
 the very time the government's ability to
 satisfy them has taken a turn for the
 worse. He is clearly concerned at the
 worsened economic outlook and is
 probably anguished at the cutbacks that
 must be made in the five-year plan. The
 treatment accorded the four officials put
 on trial for economic crimes suggests that
 Castro realizes there is an urgent need to
 revive flagging revolutionary enthusiasm
 and to instill a willingness to sacrifice.
 Although the process of in-
 stitutionalization will theoretically draw
 to a close on December 2 with the conven-
 ing of the National People's Assembly,
 the inauguration of the new constitution,
 and the readjustment of internal boun-
 daries, much will remain to be done
 before this stage of Castro's revolution
 can be concluded.
 Much of what was so carefully planned
 may prove to be confusing or impractical
 upon implementation, and it is likely to be
 some time before the population can
 digest the rapid changes. The
 organizational changes may eventually
 improve efficiency, but the Cuban tenden-
 cy toward burgeoning bureaucracy is like-
 ly to dilute the gains considerably. Fre-
 quent antibureaucracy campaigns in the
 past, although not so sweeping as the pre-

 sent one, have rarely resulted in substan-
 tial long-term savings.
 Austerity, perhaps tinged with repres-
 sion, will probably be the most outstand-
 ing characteristic of the Cuban domestic
 scene for some time to come, and dis-
 gruntlement is likely to come to the sur-
 face despite the facade of democracy that
 is now being erected. The Cuban press has
 increased its crime reporting in recent
 months, suggesting a rise in incidence suf-
 ficient to provoke an official reaction.
 Refugees are again beginning-though in
 very small numbers-to look to small
 boats and the fenceline at the US Naval
 Base at Guantanamo Bay as means of es-
 cape.
 Castro at one time may have hoped that
 giving the people some control over local
 affairs would deflect criticism from the
 administration in Havana. If so, he is like-
 ly to be disappointed. The people have
 become so accustomed to looking to
 Havana and to him personally for
 solutions and leadership that they are not
 likely  to change now.
 Organized labor, long a formidable political power in
 Argentina, is growing restive after six months of restrictive
 military government. Military leaders are divided on whether to
 crack down on or seek an accommodation with labor.
 Argentina: Junta Relations with Labor
 After six months of tight wage limits
 and stringent political controls, Argen-
 tina's heavily politicized labor unions are
 becoming increasingly restive. Light and
 power workers have been striking in the
 nation's capital; earlier, thousands of dis-
 gruntled auto workers laid down their
 tools in a number of major plants. The
 highly organized workers are probably a
 more formidable potential opponent than
 even the leftist terrorists, and the recent
 strikes are the most serious challenge yet
 faced by the junta,
 Worker dissatisfaction poses a vexing
 problem for the generals. The junta,
 which banned all strikes after it seized
 power last March, is loath to alienate
 labor irretrievably by using force against
 the workers. At the same time, it cannot
 afford to allow its decrees to be disobeyed
 with impunity. Thus far, the government
 has limited its response to arresting or
 ordering the dismissals of strike leaders.
 Labor restiveness will complicate and
 add urgency to a divisive debate that has
 been going on for some time within the
 armed forces. The more vindictive officers
 argue for dismantling the labor move-
 ment, the biggest and best organized in
 Latin  America.  The  more con-
 ciliatory-and this group includes Presi-
 dent Videla-advocate some degree of ac-
 commodation relatively soon.
 Policy Drift
 The government has yet to decide what
 course to take. Last March, the junta
 placed federal administrators in key un-
 ions and in the Peronist labor confedera-
 tion, and jailed or exiled the most corrupt
 unionists. At the same time, the junta
 launched a determined effort to reverse
 economic deterioration. The resulting
 austerity measures hit the workers harder
 than any other group.
 The military probably doubted that the
 workers would remain intimidated in-
 definitely. Many officers, in fact,
 probably were surprised that workers
 waited as long as they did before
 protesting.
 The search for a permanent labor
 policy is greatly complicated by the
 emotionalism  that surrounds
 military-labor relations. Juan Peron, the
 man who gave labor its political
 awareness and made it a force to be
 reckoned with, was a military man, but he
 was ultimately deposed by the military.
 Workers to this day retain a strong loyal-
 ty to Peron and see the armed forces as
 unalterably opposed to his populism.
 Many officers, on the other hand, blame
 the Peronists and unionism for virtually
 all the ills Argentina has suffered for more
 than a generation.
 The junta's policies to date have, if
 anything, added to the distrust that
 workers feel toward the military. Workers
 have been unable to keep up with the ris-
 ing cost of living because wages are being
 strictly controlled while prices are not.
 Unemployment increased, although less
 than originally anticipated, in the face of
 declining demand. Incentives for business
 and agriculture have added to worker
 skepticism.
 Efforts by the left to exploit worker
 frustration have been largely unsuccessful
 thus far, but the appeal of the left could be
 enhanced if labor came to view the junta
 as hopelessly antilabor.
 The government's delay in imple-
 menting a definite policy may be con-
 tributing to its image of indecisiveness
 and inviting further challenge. Continued

 delay could embolden the President's con-
 servative military critics who are pushing
 for a harsh line toward labor. At the
 same time, labor itself may take the
 junta's hesitation as an invitation to
 press its demands more strenuously.
 New Labor Leaders
 A new crop of labor leaders has
 supplanted those displaced by the coup.
 The newcomers are busy trying to es-
 tablish themselves in the eyes of both the
 workers and the military. They are fully
 aware that they could play an influential
 role if the junta decides to bring labor
 back into the national decision-making
 process.
 These leaders face a dilemma. They
 must earn the support of the rank and file,
 and perhaps the only way to do this is to
 produce some tangible gains for the un-
 ions. Even this would not assure success,
 however, because workers have become
 highly suspicious of union leaders, often
 regarding them as corrupt and unable or
 unwilling to deliver on their promises.
 On the other hand, labor's current
 leaders cannot afford to become identified
 with too much worker activism lest the
 junta conclude they cannot keep the lid on
 disruptive activity.
 Labor's success or failure in walking
 this fine line could tip the balance of
 military opinion for or against those who
 favor an accommodation with labor.
 Declarations of the government's intent
 to "normalize" relations with labor have
 become more frequent in recent months
 but are couched in vague terms. Thus far,
 the junta has not altered the basic laws
 governing labor; it has merely set them
 aside temporarily. Until it decides either
 to reaffirm these laws or to scrap them for
 new ones, labor will remain in a state of
 political limbo that is frustrating for
 workers  and  therefore  potentially
 dangerous for the junta.
 Some Signs of Optimism
 Top unionists express optimism that
 reform of the basic laws governing labor
 is in progress and that the final product
 will not drastically alter the union struc-
 ture. The union bosses are betting that the
 military, in the final analysis, will con-
 clude that any effort to break up the un-
 ions would irretrievably alienate workers
 and ultimately radicalize them. Labor
 leaders lose no opportunity to impress
 upon the military the belief that the un-
 ions are now relatively conservative and
 stand as a bulwark against communism
 and other leftist influence.
 Opinion within the Labor Ministry
 echoes this optimism. According to the
 US embassy in Buenos Aires, ministry of-
 ficials generally believe the junta will
 eventually decide to retain the basic labor
 principles now in effect:
 ? Maintenance of a single labor
 central, the General Confederation of
 Workers.
 ? Adherence to the practice of hav-
 ing only one union in any industry.
 ? Prohibition of company unions.
 The embassy reports, however, that it is
 widely assumed that there will be
 measures to limit labor's political role.
 The government, for example, may put
 strict controls on union funds, possibly
 assuming some of the social service func-
 tions long performed by the unions.
 Videla knows as well as anyone else
 that organized labor, more than any other
 group, has the potential to undo much of
 what the junta is striving to accomplish.
 By being off the job, workers reduce badly
 needed productivity. Worse than that
 from the government's viewpoint, strikes
 could undermine the junta's authority in a
 way nothing else could. This in turn would
 stiffen the resolve of those officers who
 call for punitive action against unions.
 Videla wants at all costs to keep the na-
 tion from once again entering this vicious
 circle.
 The President will probably opt for
 further token wage hikes, perhaps at
 shortened intervals, and gradual restora-
 tion of normal activity in some carefully
 selected unions. Not even the relatively
 liberal Videla, however, would
 countenance a return to the freewheeling
 ways that characterized labor before the
 coup.
 Videla will probably be strengthened in
 his efforts by the recent creation of the
 Ministry of Planning, which will coor-
 dinate the policies of all the other
 ministries and increase Videla's authority
 over the government as a whole. The
 President will also benefit from naming
 the tough General Diaz Bessone to head
 the new ministry. Military conserva-25X1

 Failure of the UN Conference on the Law of the Sea to
 make significant progress last summer has led the EC to push
 for the declaration of a 200-mile EC fisheries zone in the Atlan-
 tic and North Sea. The EC Nine are seriously divided, however,
 over how to allocate the catches among themselves.
 EC: Divisive Fisheries Issue
 The dispute over fishing rights in
 prospective EC waters threatens to divide
 the Community more deeply than any
 other issue in recent years. It also
 promises to have a significant impact on
 EC relations with most countries that fish
 in the waters to be regulated by the EC.
 EC foreign ministers failed to adopt a
 resolution this week establishing a 200-
 nautical mile (370-kilometer) fisheries
 zone because of Irish insistence that the
 Nine reach agreement simultaneously on
 an internal fisheries policy and on
 guidelines for negotiating fishing
 agreements with third countries.
 Ireland, as well as the UK, opposes
 Commission proposals calling for an ex-
 clusive  12-mile (22-kilometer) coastal
 zone, arguing that a zone of up to 50 miles
 (93 kilometers) is necessary to protect
 their domestic fishing industries. The UK,
 while willing to negotiate this issue
 separately, has considered blocking Com-
 munity farm price increases next spring if
 the EC balks at a 50-mile fishing zone.
 The UK and West Germany are most
 anxious that negotiations with Iceland,
 Norway, the US, and Canada get under
 way as soon as possible. They, and most
 other EC members, will probably press
 the Irish hard when the foreign ministers
 meet in special session later this month to
 break the deadlock.
 The EC Commission wants member
 states to declare a 200-mile exclusive
 fishing zone in the North Atlantic and the
 North Sea beginning January 1. Exten-
 ding the EC zone from 12 miles to 200
 miles would enable the Commission:
 ? To negotiate more effectively to
 ensure access for EC fishermen to
 other countries' 200-mile zones.
 ? To regulate, and in some cases ex-
 clude, third-country fishing in EC
 waters.
 ? To adopt appropriate conserva-
 tion policies.
 The EC Commission proposes to im-
 plement conservation policies by setting
 limits on catches for each state. Under the
 quota system, all EC members would suf-
 fer a major reduction in the size of their
 catches. Restrictions would be even more
 stringent on third countries, and some
 would be excluded totally from EC
 waters.
 Management of the EC's common
 fisheries policy will require a bureaucracy
 comparable to the one that now serves the
 Community's  common  agricultural
 policy. Although the Commission will
 assume responsibility for setting catch
 quotas and negotiating with third coun-
 tries, enforcement will probably be left up
 to individual member states.
 The 200-mile Declaration
 The European Council-the EC heads
 of government-indicated last July that a
 decision to establish a 200-mile zone
 would be taken only in accord with the
 results of the UN Conference on the Law
 of the Sea. The Conference failed to make
 any substantial progress during its most
 recent session, however, and the Dutch
 and the West Germans have agreed to
 support the UK position that action must
 be taken now if the legitimate interests of
 Community fishermen are to be
 protected.
 The UK and Ireland have pushed
 hardest for a 200-mile zone, arguing that
 foreign trawlers will flock to EC waters as
 other countries with rich coastal fishing
 grounds extend their fishing zones un-
 ilaterally in the North Atlantic to 200
 miles. Iceland has already declared a
 200-mile zone; Canada and Norway plan
 to do so on January 1; and the US will
 follow suit on March 1.
 British fishermen say Soviet, Roma-
 nian, Bulgarian, and, possibly, Cuban
 boats are already catching mackerel in
 large quantities off the Cornish coast.
 Soviet and East European trawlers pose
 the greatest threat to EC fish stocks
 because their suction-operated scoops in-
 discriminately harvest all fish in the area.
 Earlier this month, the Irish impounded
 a large Soviet trawler and a Bulgarian
 factory ship for fishing within 12 miles of
 the coast. The Irish navy estimates that
 there are several hundred trawlers now off
 its shore, and Irish Foreign Minister
 FitzGerald has vowed to press his case
 strongly.
 The Commission is proposing the ex-
 tension of a 200-mile zone only in the
 North Atlantic and the North Sea
 because it sees no threat, at this time, of a
 Baltic or Mediterranean state declaring a
 200-mile zone. Swedish fishermen,
 however, are asking their government to

 declare a 200-mile zone in the Baltic, and
 the Danes will probably push the EC for
 similar action in order to protect their
 Bornholm fleet, which regularly fishes the
 Baltic for salmon, cod, and herring.
 The EC declaration would pertain only
 to fishing; it would not establish an ex-
 clusive economic zone extending control
 over the seabed resources. The Nine have
 made considerable progress recently in
 developing common positions on most
 issues relating to the exclusive economic
 zone-pollution,  shipping,  navigation,
 and research rights. Differing claims to oil
 and mineral rights on the shelf, however,
 could still spark heated debate among the
 Nine.
 Establishment of a 200-mile zone will
 depend on the ability of the member states
 to pass necesary implementing legislation
 in time to meet the January 1 deadline.
 France is the only member so far that has
 completed the legal process, although the
 UK and Denmark have begun to prepare
 appropriate legislation.
 Internal Fisheries Policy
 Fish stocks, particularly in the North
 Atlantic and the North Sea, are rapidly
 being depleted. The herring catch, for ex-
 ample, is only 20 percent of what it was 15
 years ago. Arctic herring is virtually ex-
 tinct, and scientists insist that a complete
 ban on fishing North Sea herring will be
 necessary if that species is to survive.
 The Commission is proposing a quota
 system restricting the quantity and species
 of fish that can be caught for a period to
 allow for a recovery of stocks. The Com-
 mission is also proposing complementary
 measures to regulate fleets and ban
 fishing in some areas.
 The catch allocated to each member
 would be based on several criteria, in-
 cluding traditional fishing practices and
 the size of its catch in non-EC waters. The
 Irish, who catch most of their fish within
 50 miles of their coast, view the proposed
 quota system as a serious threat to their
 nascent fishing industry.
 The UK has labeled the quota system
 unworkable and unfair. The UK and Italy
 take almost no fish from the waters of
 other members, and 60 percent of the fish
 the EC proposes to divide up would be
 within Britain's 200-mile zone. A 12-mile
 zone, according to the UK, would encom-
 pass only 25 percent of its resources, a
 25-mile zone some 50 percent, and a 50-
 mile zone over 70 percent. The UK, with
 the support only of the Irish, has launched
 a spirited campaign for a 50-mile ex-
 clusive national zone.
 UK Foreign Secretary Crosland, who
 represents one of his country's foremost
 fishing ports-Grimsby-in Parliament,
 doubts that the dispute over an internal
 fisheries regime can be resolved before the
 end of the year. A delay might favor the
 British, who will be in a somewhat
 stronger position in January when they
 assume the EC presidency for six months.
 The seven other EC members, led by
 France, support the principle of equal

 access for all Community fishermen and
 have opposed even a 12-mile national
 zone, although in the end they would
 probably be willing to accept it. Denmark,
 in particular, is strongly opposed because
 approximately 70 percent of the Danish
 catch is taken within 50 miles of the UK
 coastline.
 The original six EC members contend,
 moreover, that there is no legal basis to
 extend the zone beyond 12 miles and that
 the UK and Ireland passed up their
 chance to negotiate this issue in 1973
 when they signed the Treaty of Accession
 to the EC. The UK, on the other hand,
 argues that this policy was adopted "in in-
 decent haste" just before negotiations on
 the enlargement of the Community began.

 Irish positions believe the supplementary

 quotas and financial aid the Commission
 has proposed as compensation for states
 that would be adversely affected by the
 new regime are more than adequate.
 Higher quotas would be granted on the
 basis of past fishing practices, social and
 economic impact, and losses sustained by
 a state excluded from non-EC
 waters-such as off the coast of Iceland.
 According to the Commission, about
 $480 million would be allocated from the
 agricultural fund over five years for
 restructuring the fishing industry and for
 marine research. The Commission is also
 looking to the EC social and regional
 development funds and the European
 Investment  Bank  to assist those
 fishermen-particularly in northern
 England, Scotland, and Ireland-hit
 hardest by the new policies.
 The Community takes 27 percent of its
 fish from non-EC waters. If the Nine lost
 all fishing rights in waters adjacent to
 other countries and excluded all third
 countries from EC waters, the total catch
 of Community fishermen would be
 roughly unchanged.
 In terms of value, however, the EC
 would be a net loser. Over half the cod the
 EC catches, for example, comes from
 non-EC waters while most of the fish
 caught in EC waters is used for fertilizer
 and livestock feed. Within the EC, the
 UK would suffer most, followed by Den-
 mark and West Germany.
 The West Germans argue that EC
 failure to reach agreement on an internal
 fisheries policy should in no way impede
 negotiations with third countries. The
 Germans fear they will be excluded from
 non-EC waters-where they catch two
 thirds of their fish-and have threatened
 to initiate bilateral talks with the US,
 Canada, and Norway if the Nine fail to
 approve negotiating mandates for the
 Commission by January 1.
 Negotiations with Third Countries
 The Commission proposes to notify all
 third countries that fish in EC waters that
 they may continue to do so only if they
 negotiate a fisheries agreement with the
 Community. The Commission is now
 seeking the foreign ministers' approval of
 guidelines setting out general principles
 for "framework agreements"; specific
 tonnages or quotas would be fixed later
 during annual negotiations.
 The Commission expects few problems
 with the US and Canada, once
 negotiations are initiated, because neither
 is seeking reciprocal fishing rights in EC
 waters. The EC has substantial interests
 off the North American coast; many
 vessels have been expensively equipped for
 fishing these waters.
 The EC recently concluded an
 economic cooperation agreement with
 Canada and Ottawa has already promised
 the Nine that quotas previously
 negotiated with the International Com-
 mission for North Atlantic Fisheries will
 not be significantly changed. French
 claims to exclusive fishing rights in waters
 off the French islands near New-
 foundland, however, could cause some
 problems among the Nine.
 Negotiations with Iceland and Norway
 will be more difficult. Both the Commis-
 sion and the UK are anxious to begin for-
 mal talks with Iceland as soon as possible
 because the bilateral fishing agreement
 between the UK and Iceland, which
 brought a temporary halt to the "cod
 war," expires on November 30. The Com-
 mission has made very little progress in
 exploratory talks on an EC pact that
 would replace the temporary accord and
 is hoping, perhaps too optimistically, that
 Iceland will agree to renew the six-month
 pact.
 The Commission proposes to compen-
 sate Britain for its fishing losses off the
 Icelandic coast by offering additional
 quotas within EC waters-an offer that
 may not sit well with some EC members.
 Iceland is afraid the Nine may threaten to
 drop the tariff concessions it now receives
 in order to encourage a more conciliatory
 stance in the talks. The Icelandic govern-
 ment, however, has already warned that it
 considers the tariff concessions
 irrevocable.
 The EC hopes to conclude a reciprocal
 fishing agreement with Norway-which
 catches 14 percent of its fish in EC
 waters-before it declares a 200-mile
 zone. Norway's desire to protect its

 waters from West European fishermen
 was a major reason for deciding not to
 join the Community in 1973. German and
 French fishing in Norwegian waters has
 recently risen to UK levels, and Oslo will
 be seeking some reduction in the EC's
 total catch.
 Denmark,  responding to mounting
 political  pressure from  the  Faeroe
 Islanders, plans to declare a 200-mile
 zone around the islands on January 1.
 Current fishing agreements with EC
 members, Norway, Poland, Iceland, and
 Canada will be terminated in six months
 and the Faeroese-who are not EC
 members-will have to negotiate new
 agreements separately.
 Greenland, which is bound to the EC
 through Denmark, will probably declare a
 200-mile zone in concert with the Nine,
 although the growing debate over home
 rule could complicate such plans. Once a
 200-mile zone is established, however,
 Greenland will move to exclude most
 third-country  fishermen in order to
 protect its shrimp and codfish stocks,
 which are being rapidly depleted.
 The USSR has become increasingly
 dependent on fish as an alternative source
 of protein; the current five-year plan calls
 for an even higher fish catch. About 19
 percent of the total Soviet catch comes
 from EC waters-more than ten times the
 EC catch in Soviet waters. The Commis-
 sion is willing to discuss a reciprocal deal,
 but the USSR has customarily refused
 formally to recognize the authority of the
 EC to negotiate for the Nine.
 A 15 percent rise in oil prices would hit the major
 developed countries with varying severity, but economic growth
 rates would decline and inflation would rise in all of them.
 Economic recovery would probably not be threatened in Japan
 and West Germany, but France and-especially-Italy would
 face tough sledding.
 The Commission, however, is in the
 position where it can wait for the Soviets
 and the East Europeans to make the first
 approach. The EC may be able to use its
 relatively strong bargaining position on
 this question to secure better terms in
 future negotiations on an EC-CEMA
 agreement.
 The Commission has proposed that
 those states in whose waters EC fishermen
 have  little interest-Spain,  Sweden,
 Finland, and the East European coun-
 tries-should be gradually excluded from
 the EC's 200-mile zone. The Danes are in-
 terested in fishing the Baltic Sea,
 however, and they may argue for granting
 the Swedes, Poles, and East Germans
 some North Sea fishing rights in return.
 ItIIUMMAJII xi 1111MOcc:c vi vii rric& rnibu
 A  15-percent increase in  oil
 prices-likely to be announced at the
 Organization of Petroleum Exporting
 Countries ministerial meeting in
 December-would probably reduce the
 real gross national product in the seven
 major industrialized countries-the US,
 the UK, France, West Germany, Italy,
 Canada, and Japan-approximately $32
 billion below what it would otherwise
 have been in 1977. Oil-related income
 losses would reduce the real GNP growth
 next year to 4.5 percent compared with an
 almost 5.4 percent projected rise without
 higher oil prices.
 This calculation assumes that
 governments take no fiscal policy moves
 reinforcing the contractionary impact on
 demand, as they did following the 1973
 price hikes, and that monetary policies
 are adjusted to take account of the
 oil-related rise in inflation rates and
 reduced rates of real growth.
 The impact could be worse if
 households increase savings in response to
 the higher inflation and any oil-related job
 losses. The 0.8-percent loss in GNP does
 take account of offsetting gains from their
 increased exports to OPEC countries due
 to the additional revenues higher oil prices
 bring the OPEC group.
 Italy would be hardest hit with a GNP
 loss of 1.4 percent followed by Japan (1.2)
 and France (1.0). The seriousness of the
 impact reflects the fact that the rise in oil
 prices since 1973 has roughly tripled the
 importance of oil in each of the major
 economies.
 Although difficult to quantify, these
 GNP losses could add as much as 0.5 per-
 cent to unemployment in Western
 Europe. France, Italy, and the UK are in
 the poorest position to absorb the job im-
 pact; unemployment in 1977 in those

 countries would be at politically sensitive
 levels even without the oil-related losses.
 Inflationary Impact
 Higher oil prices would increase the
 rate of inflation by nearly one sixth in
 major countries, adding about 1 percent
 to consumer prices. The UK and Italy,
 countries where inflation still is stubborn-
 ly high, would experience the largest
 oil-related price rises..
 The US would be more vulnerable to
 the inflationary impact than in the past,
 because imports now account for 40 per-
 cent of US oil supplies. For Japan and
 Western Europe, the inflationary effects
 of a 15-percent oil price increase would be
 comparable to those of a 30-percent hike
 three years ago.
 The oil price hike would cause an $11
 billion deterioration in the current ac-
 count balance of the seven major in-
 dustrial countries. Their net oil import bill
 would increase by roughly $15 billion;
 part of these added costs would be offset
 by increased sales to OPEC.
 OPEC countries probably would in-
 crease their purchases from the seven
 countries by $3 billion because of ad-
 ditional revenues earned from higher oil
 prices. Major countries' trade balances
 with non-OPEC areas would improve by
 at least $500 million because the
 oil-related loss in their import demand
 would exceed the loss in export sales to
 non-OPEC areas. Smaller developed
 countries would experience more than a
 $3 billion deterioration in their oil and
 non-oil trade balance.
 For non-OPEC developing countries
 the chief impact of higher oil prices would
 be on their foreign economic position.
 Raising oil prices by 15 percent would add
 $1.9 billion to the net oil import bill for
 the group as a whole, bringing it to $15
 billion in 1977.
 Oil-induced price increases in
 developed economies would add another
 $1.3 billion to nonfuel import costs; it is
 possible that non-OPEC developing coun-
 try import prices for foodstuffs, in-
 termediate products, and finished goods
 would increase 1.2 percent on the average.
 The non-OPEC group would experience
 an estimated 2 percent deterioration in
 terms of trade.
 The oil-related loss in developed coun-
 try real GNP would almost certainly have
 an adverse impact on non-OPEC develop-
 ing country export volume by reducing de-
 mand for industrial raw materials below
 what it would have been. The volume
 losses associated with a 0.8 percentage
 point reduction in developed countries'
 GNP could cost non-OPEC developing
 countries $500 million.
 Some of these countries would more
 than compensate for volume losses by
 raising export prices. This offset would
 accrue primarily to South Korea, Taiwan,
 Brazil, and Mexico. Raw material ex-
 porters may face softer markets because
 of oil-weakened demand in major coun-
 tries.
 Policy Response
 The policy response of major countries
 will be an important factor determining
 how seriously higher oil prices affect
 growth and trade. If governments try to
 counter the inflationary impact, as they
 did in 1973 to 1974, the real GNP loss
 could be considerably larger than the
 average 0.8 percentage point loss. On the
 other hand,  the stimulative fiscal
 measures needed to offset the contrac-
 tionary impact of oil prices would be
 relatively small.
 The fiscal stimulus needed to recoup
 oil-related income losses would be greater
 if only one or a few countries were to act.
 For example, to regain the oil-related
 reduction in real GNP, Japan would have
 to increase government spending $1.4
 billion if other major countries took
 similar action. If Japan acted alone, it
 would have to increase spending almost
 twice as much.
 In addition to fiscal adjustments,
 monetary policy would have to take ac-
 count of higher inflation rates. Otherwise,
 the slower growth in real money stock
 would tend to raise interest rates and
 depress investment further.
 The larger industrial countries-the
 US, Japan, and West Germany-face
 relatively little risk to their economic
 recoveries  even  without  stimulative
 measures.  West German real growth
 would still average about 4 percent next
 year. Japanese real growth would average
 6 percent or better.
 Japan might prefer to shift a sizable
 portion of its higher oil bill abroad by tak-
 ing no fiscal measures to offset the
 oil-related reduction in domestic demand.
 Given West Germany's concern about in-
 flation, it might also be inclined to avoid
 offsetting fiscal action.
 France and Italy, on the other hand,
 would face tough sledding if the larger
 economies, particularly West Germany,
 stand pat on the fiscal front. With un-
 employment a major political issue,
 France would be in a bad position to ab-
 sorb any oil-related job losses. Acting
 alone to compensate for these losses,
 however, would add some half billion
 dollars to France's already large current
 account deficit.
 Italy would be in an even worse situa-
 tion. If Rome were to offset the 1.4
 percentage point real GNP loss caused by
 the oil price hike while others took no ac-
 tion, its already large current account
 deficit would increase an estimated $500
 million. While letting real growth slip to
 under 2 percent would entail high political
 risks, the real question is whether Italy
 will be able to

 finance the balance-of-
 of avoiding a slip in
 Other Countries
 Non-OPEC developing countries, for
 their part, would need at least $3.5 billion
 in foreign borrowing to maintain imports
 and not suffer further losses in consump-
 tion and growth. We expect ithat, at most,
 OPEC countries would increase their aid
 flows by $1.0 billion.
 Since developing countries would be
 unable to draw down exchange reserves
 much, private financial institutions, in-
 dustrial country aid, and multilateral
 lenders would have to finance the rest.
 Given the large developing countries'
 current account deficit and huge external 25X1
 debt, it remains far from certain that the 25X1
 funds necessary to maintain import
