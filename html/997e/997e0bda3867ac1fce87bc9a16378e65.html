1908 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE February 3, 1966 
In the interests of sound government, 
the proposed constitutional amendment 
for a 4-year term for House Members 
merits our every consideration. 
PORNOGRAPHY?ITS PERIL TO 
YOUTH 
Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, earlier 
this year I placed in the CONGRESS.IONAt 
jilECoRD a highly informative article on 
the subject of pornography, which had 
appeared in Columbia, the official maga-
sine of the Knights of Columbus. I have 
just had a letter from the editor of that 
publication, Mr. Elmer Von Feldt. 
I ask unanimous consent to insert the 
letter in the RECORD at this point. 
There being no objection, the letter 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
KNIGHTS or COLUMBUS SUPREME 
COUNC7L, 
New Haven, Conn., January 31, 1966. 
lion. KARL E. Mower, 
U.S. Senator, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, B.C. 
DEAR SENATOR MUNDT: I wish to express 
my thanks to you for placing the article on 
pornography appearing in the January issue 
of Columbia In the January 17 issue of the 
CONGRESSIONP T. RECORD. 
The copy you sent is going to the author, 
Al Antczak. Mr. Antzcak's was the first of 
three articles in Columbia examining the 
perils of the pornographic trade In the Unit-
ed States. 
Enclosed in the February edition of the 
magazine which carries a second article. I 
shall send you a copy of our third article 
as soon as the March issue comes off the press. 
You will be happy to know that the 
Knights of Columbus, a 1,200,000-member 
Catholic fraternal organization, which pub-
lishes Columbia, has undertaken a nation-
wide program to alert our society to the 
danger to youth from the increasingly brazen 
pornographic productions in this country 
and is trying to organize community sup-
port for legislative, judicial, and executive 
action to halt this pestilential tide. 
Sincerely, 
ELMER VON FELDT, 
Editor. 
Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, the arti-
cle to which Mr. Von Feldt refers, "Por-
nography?Its Peril to Youth," is a 
searching inquiry into many of the prob-
lems surrounding the question of smut, 
and the restrictions which should be 
placed on the sale of obscene materials. 
I ask that this article, written by Mr. 
George Gent, TV editor of the New York 
Times, appear in the RECORD at this point. 
There being no abjection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
PORNOGRAPHY; ITS PERIL TO YOUTH 
i; By George Gent) 
(Norse?Many authorities who have stud-
ied the problem of obscenity feel certain it 
has noxious effects on youth, but they admit 
they have not yet come up with massive 
scientific proof to convince the doubters. 
Their own disturbing findings are detailed in 
this second of three Columbia articles on the 
menace of smut.) 
The overriciding concern of those alarmed 
by the rising tide of pornographic literature 
its effect on youth and the moral fiber of 
our Nation. 
Most of those active in the crusade to halt 
the flood of pornography work on the sup-
position that such literature must necessarily 
be harmful to youth. Yet the majority of 
these will admit that they cannot provide any 
massive statistical proof for their assumption. 
A significant fact in the porngraphic trade 
Is that more than ever before it is directed 
toward the young. It includes magazines 
that provide a step-by-step program for suc-
cessful seduction and fully illustrni.ed books 
of male and female perversion. Tue young 
are not spared even the horrors of illustrated 
bestiality. 
Another category?the fastest grc wing and 
the one most authorities see as the greatest 
threat to psychic health?includes books and 
magazines that combine sexuality with vio-
lence. One of these is a comic book series 
that completely details sadistic methods of 
sexual fuliillm.ent, including torture, whip-
ping, branding, and the exquisite delight of 
amputating a woman's tongue. These are 
not words one puts on paper easily, yet they 
fill the fantasy life of a growing legion of 
American youths. 
A most vivid memory during the prepara-
tion of this article was a visit to he Man-
hattan office of Operation Yorkville. an inter-
faith organization dedicated to eliminating 
the sale of obscene material to young people. 
During my interview with Father Morton 
S.J., the group's executive director, the 
phone rang and, after listening for a few 
minutes, the white-haired Jesuit priest 
blanched and beckoned me to listen on 
another extension. 
On the other end was one of Operation 
Yorkvi.11e's many volunteers, a 55-year-old 
advertising executive who had just returned 
from, a screening with a number of commu-
nity leaders of a pornographic Swedish film 
that had been seized earlier that day by the 
New York City police. After describing the 
film, which dealt with youthful homosexual-
ity, perversion and bestiality, the man, his 
voice quavering, said: 
"I'm a mature man with a grown family 
and I haven't led a sheltered life, but I've 
never felt so unclean as after leaving that 
picture. I wanted to wash my hands and 
walk and walk until I felt fresh again. It 
was unbelievable." 
Father Hill's office is filled with such ma-
terial, much of it designed for young readers. 
He showed me the current copy of a respected 
literary magazine that featured 12 pages in 
color of metal sculptures that could be de-
scribed only as pornographic. The magazine 
was readily available at the public library. 
Americans differ strongly on whether it 
would be constitutional to suppress such 
material. The American Civil Liberties 
Union insists it would not. But another 
question that arises is whether it can be 
proved scientifically that pornography has a 
permanently harmful effect on young people. 
Some psychiatrists?Dr. Frederic Wertham 
Is probably the most prominent?insist that 
it has, but others equally renowned either 
deny such effects or maintain that proof is 
lacking. 
Groups like Operation Yorkville and the 
Citizens for Decent Literature work on the 
assumption that a steady diet of jx)rnog-
raphy must have harmful effects on young 
minds and imaginations, but the scientific 
clincher is missing. 
People on both sides of the issue admit 
that clarity would benefit from a thorough-
going clinical and sociological study of the 
problern. But there are those, not at all 
unsympathetic to the value judgments of 
the antismut forces, who believe that even in 
the presence of overwhelming evidence, the 
issue ultimately will be decided on extra-
scientific grounds. 
Perhaps the most significant scientific en-
dorsement of the antipornography position 
has come from the New York Academy of 
Medicine. In 1963, the academy published 
in its bulletin a statement based on a 
sampling of obscene literature by its Com-
mittee on Public Health.. It said in part: 
"The academy believes that although some 
adolescents may not be affected by the rend-
ing of salacious literature, others may be 
more vulnerable. Such reading encourages a 
morbid preoccupation with sex and inter-
feres with the development of a healthy atti-
tude and respect for the opposite sex. It is 
said to contribute to perversion. In the 
opinion of some psychiatrists, it may have 
an especially detrimental effect on disturbed 
adolescents. Behavior is complex. It is 
difficult, if not impossible, to prove sci-
entifically that a direct causal relation exists 
between libidinous literature and socially 
unacceptable conduct. Yet is is undeniable 
that there has been a resurgence of venereal 
disease, particularly among teen-age youth, 
and that the rate of illegitimacy is climbing. 
It may be postulated that there is a correla-
tion between these phenomena and the ap-
parent rise in salacious literature, and per-
haps it is causal, but the latter cannot be 
definitely demonstrated." 
It should be noted that the academy's 
statement was based on a consensus among 
physicians and psychiatrists consulted by 
the subcommittee after a perusal of selected 
pornographic texts. It was not a controlled 
scientific study of young people addicted to 
such literature. 
Few men have spent as many years in the 
clinical study of sex and violence in the 
mass media as has Dr. Fredric Wertham, the 
noted psychiatrist who has written two 
classic works on the subject, "The Show of 
Violence" and "Seduction of the Innocent." 
While Dr. Wertham's theories have been 
criticized, he has specialized in this area for 
over 35 years and has appeared as an expert 
witness in :medicolegal cases throughout 
the country. His views have been discussed 
before the U.S. Supreme Court, 
Dr. Wertham told Columbia he really feels 
the combination of sex with violence is the 
principal threat to psychic health today. 
Words like pornography and hard-core 
pornography are misleading, he said, be-
cause they lack precision and can be misused. 
"We have to be careful that we don't fall 
into the hands of the bigots whose real aim 
is to suppress sex," he said. The depiction 
of normal sex or even of eroticism within 
normal limits is not unhealthy, Dr. Wertham 
maintains, but when sex and violence are 
mixed, young people can be affected greatly. 
Citing his essay on "Mass Media and Sex 
Deviation," Dr. Wertham said "the satura-
tion of children's minds with brutality, vio-
lence and sadism has done, and is doing, un-
questionable harm, including in the sexual 
sphere. It leads to a demoralization of 
healthy instincts. This influence on the 
psychosexual development of children and 
preadolescents takes place in various ways, 
through different mechanisms and of course 
to varying degrees." 
He stated there is a direct link between 
violence and sex. "Sadism is contagious," 
he said. "It is quite wrong to think of 
sadism as just a form of aggression or hatred. 
Psychodynamically it is a short circuit con-
nection between physical cruelty and sex. 
As well as being potentially socially danger-
ous, this link is always pathological. .Any-
thing that fosters this trend therefore is 
noxious to mental health." 
Dr. Wcrthern cited numerous instances in 
his clinical experience where sadistic acts 
carried out by young people proved upon in-
vestigation to be associated with literature 
dealing with similar experiences. But even 
where no sadistic acts are committed he 
said, sadistic fantasies may become a stum-
bling block in the way of psychosexual de-
velopment and a dependence on these fan-
tasies may eventually wreck harmonious sex-
ual adjustments in marriage. 
Dr. Wertharn rejects the widely held psy-
chological theory that the representation of 
sadistic acts serves as a "safety valve" for

DELEGATION TO UNI LED STATES-

CONFERENCE 
The SPEAKER. The Chair lays be-
fore the House a communication which 
the Clerk will read. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, D.C., February 2, 1966. 
Hon. JOHN W. MCCORMACK, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR MR. SPEAKER: I very much regret it 
will be necessary for me to resign from the 
U.S delegation to the United States-Mexican 
Interparliamentary Conference. 
I have a number of previous commitments 
which are firm for the period of the confer-
ence and am unable to cancel them. I ap-
preciate the privilege of being appointed as 
a representative from the House and hope 
this will not preclude my being considered 
at a future time as I continue to maintain 
a great interest in these meeings. 
Sincerely yours, 
WILL/AM L. SPRINGER. 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the resignation is accepted. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to the pro-
visions of section 1, Public Law 86-420, 
the Chair appoints as a member of the 
U.S. delegation of the Mexico-United 
States inter-parliamentary group, the 
gentleman from Kansas [Mr. MizE], to 
fill the existing vacancy thereon. 
COL. FRANK BORMAN'S ADVICE TO 
GARY, IND., YOUTH 
(Mr. MADDEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute, to revise and extend his remarks, 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. MADDEN. Mr. Speaker, last 
month Gary, Ind., was indeed proud to 
honor a hometown boy, Astronaut Col. 
Frank Borman. The city celebrated his 
historical success in orbiting the globe 
206 times, covering approximately 5.8 
million miles in 14 days. Colonel 
Borman and his fellow astronaut, Capt. 
James A. Lovell, will be recorded in 
history as the pioneers in the first star-
tling breakthrough on the scientific ex-
ploration of space. 
The city of Gary can also be proud of 
the 12-hour program of ceremony, meet-
ings, luncheon, and dinner honoring its 
space hero. Mayor Martin A. Katz, and 
James Rasmussen, the managing editor 
of the Gary Post-Tribune, were cochair-
men of this event. They were assisted 
by a dozen special committees to aid 
them in the great task of extending a 
hero's welcome to a native son. 
I believe the highlight of the day was 
when Colonel Borman spoke to an en-
thusiastic gathering of 6,000 school-
children in the Gary Memorial Audito-
rium. I wish to here submit to the Con-
gress a verbatim message coming from 
the mind and heart of Colonel Borman 
to this great gathering of admiring 
youngsters. I only wish that every 
American schoolchild could have heard 
or someday will read the advice given 
by Astronaut Borman to the youthful 
gathering. 
Colonel Borman's advice and message 
to the Gary schoolchildren was reprinted 
in the Gary Post-Tribune on January 
15, 1966. 
COLONEL BORMAN'S MESSAGE TO GARY'S YOUTH 
Always at school assemblies someone has 
advice for the teenagers and youngsters, so 
I, too, have a little advice for you, based on 
my years of experience. I was for 3 years 
a teacher at the Military Academy?West 
Point?from 1957 to 1960. 
You must get a good, solid, basic education. 
I want you to understand that I am being 
very sincere. I would like to list several 
things I would do if I could relive my youth-
ful days. 
EDUCATION 
(I) I would do everything in my capability 
to continue my education on through high 
school and preferably into college. Those 
doors won't open any more without diplomas 
and you must have a good, basic background. 
eATRIOTISNI 
(2) I would be patriotic. I would have a 
sense of duty to my country, to my school, 
to my city, and to my State. I think it is 
extremely important that we keep. this sense 
of being proud to be an American. I hope 
you all have it, and I hope you never lose it. 
RELIGION 
(3) I would be religious. This sometimes 
seems to be out of date, but I am very proud 
of the fact that I am a lay reader in the 
Episcopal Church, and I hope that all of you 
continue your religion. I hope that none of 
you ever feel ashamed to have and to pro-
fess a basic belief in God. This is important. 
Believe me again as this is coming from an 
oldster now, but if I were starting all over, 
_I would make sure that I had that. 
HONOR 
(4) The next thing I would do is make 
sure I had a sense of honor. I would be 
honest with my fellow Americans, with my 
fellow students, with my teachers, and I 
would be honest with myself. Again, these 
basic old virtues have not grown obsolete. 
PRIDE 
(5) I think the next one is something 
often overlooked, but I would have a sense 
of pride in myself. I would go around with 
my head held high. I would keep myself 
neat. I would be very proud to be an 
American and a citizen of this wonderful 
country. 
These are just a few words of advice for 
you. I hope you take them seriously, and 
I hope you think about them once in a while. 
SUPPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
DECISION 
(Mr. O'HARA of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute, to revise and extend his re-
marks, and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. O'HARA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
all across our country yesterday Ameri-
cans joined in support of the President's 
decision. They recognized with few ex-
ceptions that the President had done all 
in his power to seek peace without re-
sorting to the use of force. 
A newspaper editorial which I feel 
caught the temper of our national senti-
ment with unusual clarity appeared yes-
terday afternoon in the Chicago Daily 
News under the headline "The Bombers 
Fly Again." It was a balanced, and 
thoughtful, expression of support for the 
President that recognized the inevitable 
debate which would be provoked by such 
a far-reaching decision. The editorial 
warned, however, that this debate must 
be "responsible and constructive rather 
than acrimonious and partisan." 
This editorial is a significant example 
of the support the President has in this 
hour of national decision and debate. So 
that it may have the widest possible 
audience, I ask that it be printed in full 
in the record of our proceedings. 
THE BOMBERS FLY AGAIN 
Technically, few could fault the Presi-
dent's case for resuming the bombing of 
North Vietnam. 
During the 37-day pause Mr. Johnson 
waged a worldwide peace offensive, earn-
estly seeking by every means consistent 
with reason and dignity to produce some 
reciprocal gesture by Hanoi. He-might as 
well have been whistling in a tornado; the 
Communists weren't interested. He was 
forced to conclude that the Red leaders 
are satisfied that theirs is the winning posi-
tion, that they feel they have only to hold 
fast and at some point the American peo-
ple will despair of the rising Cost in lives 
and treasure, and quit the field. 
They were encouraged in this viewpoint 
by the thunderous silence that greeted Mr. 
Johnson's worldwide search for under-
standing and support. Except for a hand-
ful of doggedly faithful friends, the world 
advised the President that this was his com-
mitment, his war and, by inference, his 
folly. If his going-in premise is right, that 
communism must be stopped in southeast 
Asia lest it engulf all Asia and tip the world 
power balance against the West, he had to 
bow to military imperatives and resume 
blasting the enemy's arteries of supply. 
But an American public forced to accept 
the tragic prospect of steep escalation of 
draft calls and casualty lists will grasp 
eagerly at the hope, however faint, prompted 
by the President's sympathetic response to 
Pope Paul's proposal for arbitration by 
netural nations under United Nations 
sponsorship. The President directed Am-
bassador Arthur Goldberg to carry the pro-
posal to the Security Council, 
By this and other means, the President 
said he will continue to pursue peace in a 
manner "as determined and unremitting as 
the pressure of our military strength on the 
field of battle." But he gave no sign of

hopefulness that the effort would bear fruit, 
and there appeared no cause for any opti-
mism. 
So the Nation resumes its course along the 
dark tunnel with no daylight visible at the 
end and, indeed, no certainty of what may 
lie ahead. The range of possibilities runs 
from some sudden change of heart by Hanoi 
and Peiping, to an escalation that will one 
day bring Chinese troops pouring into North 
Vietnam and U.S. nuclear bombs raining on 
China's industrial centers. 
In these circumstances, debate within this 
country is bound to increase in volume and 
intensity, for it is possible in this uncharted 
morass for men of equal sincerity to reason 
their way to opposite conclusions. 
Debate, in Congress and out, will be heated 
and vigorous, as it should be. We can hope 
also, particularly as to Congress, that it will 
be responsible and constructive rather than 
acrimonious and partisan. For Congress has 
a job that transcends in importance to the 
Nation this year's congressional elections, im-
portant as they are?the job of helping to 
illuminate and shape national policy through 
these dangerous Months, and to help make 
sure that the American people maintain 
their fundamental solidarity and integrity 
In support of the national effort. This is a 
strange and formless and unprecedented kind 
of war we are in, but it demands the same 
singleness of purpose any war requires when 
the Nation's future rests in the balance. 
THERE IS AN AWFUL LOT OF PROG-
RESS IN BRAZIL 
(Mr. MONAGAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute, to revise and extend his remarks, 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. MONAGAN. Mr. Speaker, since 
the inception of the Castelo Branco gov-
ernirient in Brazil there has been an un-
warranted amount of criticism in our 
country about the policies and actions of 
that government. While its operation 
does not accord with our own procedures 
in all respects, nevertheless in view of 
Brazilian practice its-policies have not 
been extraordinary. 
What really is important, however, is 
the fact that the Castelo Branco recovery 
program is actually working. This can 
be proven by statistics and these figures 
are most impressive. The country will 
be nearly back on its feet in 1966. 
In 1963 the inflation rate was 70.4 per-
cent; in 1965 it was 45.5 percent. The 
trade balance in those years went from 
$112 to $400 million, while exchange re-
serves increased from $168 to $500 mil-
lion. Income tax revenue increased 
from zero to 1.3 trillion cruzeiros. 
When it is realized that Goulart was 
President during the full year of 1963 
and also the first quarter of 1964, and 
the effect of his policies lingered on, this 
achievement is all the more impressive. 
I am sure that all friends of Brazil 
will find this record most rewarding and 
will find in it a good augury for the fu-
ture peace and security of the hemi-
sphere.

A PHYSICIAN'S REPORT FROM 
VIETNAM 
(Mr. HALL asked and was given Per-
mission to address the House for 1 min-
ute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, with con-
sent of the House, I reprint herewith an 
excerpt of a personal letter from one 
of the physicians serving in South Viet-
nam. As background, he is a young man 
with a family, and his unit has ben 
commended for the low percentage of 
loss of life from battle casualties in many 
recent operations?such as Operations 
"Crimp" and "Buckskin," in defense of 
the area immediately north of Saigon on 
the famed rubber plantation in support 
of the 1st Infantry Division?"Big Red." 
I believe the personal letter which can 
be verified at length in my office, in-
No. 17-11 
eluding names and places, will be of par-
ticular interest to our colleagues at this 
time of decision?or lack thereof?con-
cerning the support of our troops who 
have been committed voluntarily or 
otherwise, in southeast Asia. I say 
again, as I did on Thursday last, that we 
must untie the hands of our men of the 
military who are there committed and 
let them win, as win they will if turned 
loose and directed by the proper military 
under policies laid down by Congress 
within the Constitution, and on the spot: 
We had some of the Air Force boys over 
for snacks last night (Saturday, January 22) . 
They're really nice, fine fellows. They have 
been on rest and recuperation to Bangkok. 
Ran into some of our mutual friends from 
Karat (Thailand). They are really gloomy 
about the prospects of resuming North Viet-
nam bombing raids. Say the cease-fire has 
given them a chance to move their missile 
1731 
and antiaircraft locations?plus rebuild those 
that have been destroyed?also say that our 
missions, along with the way to fly them, 
comes from Washington. Tactically, this 
causes much loss of life. Guess L.B.J. is 
an expert in Air Force tactics as well. 
Everyone's attitude is becoming fatalistic?
it's very difficult to convince a man whose life 
is at stake 24 hours a day that the advantages 
of the cease-fire outweigh the tactical dis-
advantages (McNamara's). I hardly think a 
pilot hunting a new SAM site feels that way. 
Am I overlooking the ultimate goals? Ant 
I, too, concerned about individuals rather 
than the whole? But then, that's why 
America is America?concern for individ-
uals?I thought, anyway. Can people con-
tinue to let the Government sell them out? 
If so, the predicted gloom of An;ierica's future 
Is pressing toward us at an alarming rate of 
speed. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe all in this 
Chamber will agree that the writer is a 
thoughtful, perceptive and considerate 
person of prudence. He is in service and 
on station voluntarily, and although con-
cerned, confused, and sometimes dis-
gusted; those he speaks for and repre-
sents are dedicated and unquestionably 
loyal?in fighting for our Nation and 
freedom. It is time we listened, looked, 
and acted. 
CRUELTY TO ANIMALS 
(Mr. RESNICK asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. RESNICK. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to bring to the attention of the Mem-
bers the lead article in the current issue 
of Life magazine, dated February 4, 1966, 
called "Concentration Camps for Dogs." 
This article describes and illustrates a 
raid made by officers of the Humane So-
ciety of the United States upon the prem-
ises of a so-called dealer who makes a 
business of obtaining dogs from ques-
tionable sources, many of them stolen, 
and then sells them, either directly or 
through other dealers to research lab-
oratories. 
The sickening photographs and de-
scriptive text document in black and 
white a practice that is conducted 
throughout the United States, that has 
been condemned many times in this very 
Chamber, and which is the target of a 
number of bills including my pet protec-
tion bill, H.R. 9743. 
However, it is not actually necessary 
for us to wait until one of these bills is. 
enacted before meaningful corrective 
measures can be taken. The largest 
single user of laboratory animals in the 
country is the 'U.S. Government. The 
National Institutes of Health uses 
about 100,000 dogs and cats per 
year. While the National Institutes 
of Health does have inspectors who 
investigate the premises of the deal-
ers it buys from, it is impossible to check 
up on the sources of these animals. 
Consequently, many stolen pets, loved 
members of families like yours and mine, 
wind up dying on the operating tables of 
the National Institutes of Health. As a 
matter of fact, just a few weeks ago the 
National Institutes of Health returned to 
a Virginia farmer a pure-bred English 
setter which had been stolen from him

several months before and found in the 
National Institutes of Health's kennels. 
There is a better way to obtain animals 
for research and, to help make it a real-
ity, I have today written a letter to the 
Director of the National Institutes of 
Health urging the National Institutes of 
Health to stop buying animals from the 
usual dealers and to breed and raise 
their own. This would have a number of 
advantages. First, it would assure the 
Government of a steady supply of strong 
healthy animals, far superior to the 
emaciated, sickly animals dealers now 
provide, many 01 which die before they 
are ever used for the purpose for which 
they were purchased. Second, it would 
eliminate any possibility of stolen pets 
being used for research. Third, it may 
well save the Government substantial 
sums of money and, fourth, it is fitting 
and proper for NIH to set the pace in 
this area for the other laboratories 
throughout the Nation. 
I sincerely hope that this suggestion 
will be seriously considered, and that my 
colleagues will join me in expressing 
their support of this idea to the National 
Institutes of Health. 
LATEST U.S. SUPREME COURT DE-
CISIONS FAVORABLE TO COMMU-
NISTS HAVE HARMED MANAGE-
MENT, LABOR. AND THE AMERI-
CAN PEOPLE 
(Mr. UTT asked and was given Per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
Point in the RECORD and to include a re-
port.) 
Mr.. UTT. Mr. Speaker, under unani-
mous consent to insert my remarks in the 
body of the RECORD, I include a supple-
mental report prepared by Mr. Harold W. 
Kennedy, county counsel of the county 
of Los Angeles, Calif. 
The original report was widely circu-
lated and widely acclaimed by public as 
well as private agencies throughout the 
country and the response to this was ex-
ceptionally fine. 
This report was made at the request of 
the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors and 
is completely objective, pointing out the 
effect of recent Supreme Court decisions 
which have been harmful to manage-
ment, labor, and the American people, 
while at the same time have given a green 
light to the international Communist 
conspiracy. 
Mr. Kennedy has received many na-
tional awards for his outstanding judicial 
publications. 
I have been a close friend of Mr. Ken-
nedy for more than 30 years and can at-
test to his character, ability, and 
integrity. He is one of the most re-
spected men in the State of California. 
LATEST U.S SUPREM E COURT DECISIONS FAVOR - 
AIDE TO COMMUNISTS HAVE HARMED MAN-
AGEMENT, LABOR, AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
(Supplemental report of Harold W. Kennedy, 
county counsel of the county of Los An-
geles, to the special report of August 19, 
1964, filed with the Los Angeles County 
Hoard of Supervisors, August 1965) 
INTRODUCTION TO SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT 
Approximately 1 year ago, on August 19, 
1961, the county counsel of the county of 
1,11MTPIMIWINMAIPIIIIMPWW, 
Los Angeles,1 acting pursuant to a unanimous 
board order, filed with the Board of Super-
visors of the County of Los Angeles, a Special 
Report on Problem Created by Recent Su-
preme Court Cases Affecting the Communist 
Party. 
'That report, drawing on. the unique and 
extensive background of the over 20 years 
experience of the county counsel in fighting 
subversion on the local and State levels, de-
tailed the past antisubversive activity of 
that office and reviewed and commented tupon 
the effects of certain recent decisions of the 
U.S. Supreme Court in this vitally import ant 
area of the law. 
The whole tenor of that report was an 
effort to set out in concise and readable 
form the unfortunate and disturbing trend 
of recent judicial opinions of our highest 
Federal court in the field of stioversive cen-
tred. Its purpose was to marshal and chan-
nel in an effective way the growing ground 
swell of public concern and alarm at the 
pastern of judicial thought which has 
emerged from our courts in recent years and 
which has effectively hampered the legisla-
tive and executive departments of govern-
ment in their efforts to control and curtail 
the very real Communist conspiracy at work 
in our midst. 
It was the hope of the author that the re-
port would serve both as a point of reference 
and as a guide to concerted action; thee by 
strengthening the attitude and opinion, of 
those who have already recognized the 
danger of communism, and by suggesting the 
need for an immediate but orderly change 
in the negative direction that present ju-
dicial thought is taking, patriotic Americans 
everywhere could effectively join with those 
of us in government who have consistently 
voiced concern over recent U.S. Supreme 
Court decisions which are oveebalanced in 
favor of subversive elements in our society. 
"Our judiciary is not insensitive to the 
needs of our time, The marshalled forces of 
American thought can create a social climate 
that will serve not only to reinforce the a',A,1-
tucles of those who have forthrightly recog-
nized the danger of communisin to our so-
ciety, but will also serve to point the was to 
a change in judicial thought and action." 
In the comparatively short period of time 
since its publication, the report has ht d a 
pronounced impact On local, State, and 'Na-
tional levels. The report was the subjec L of 
a speech in the House of RepresentaOves 
and was reprinted in its entirety in the Corr-
enEssIoNaii RECORD of the 'U.S. Congress on 
September 23, 1964 (88th Cong., 2d sess., 
110. No. 183). Many national patriotic orga-
nizations such as the American Legion, the 
Americanism Educational League (Los An-
geles, Calif.), the American Academy of 
Public Affairs, and others, passed resolutions 
commending the publication of the report 
and urging that it be read by their member-
ship. One hundred sixty-five thousand 
copies of the report were made and, to date, 
approximately 140,000 copies have been dis-
tributed throughout the Nation. The greeter 
part of those copies was printed entirely at 
private expense through the efforts of indi-
vidual citizens, newspapers, church and 
patriotic organizations who, aware of the in-
creasing and unceasing danger of the spread 
of the world Communist mov3ment, have 
seen in the report a direct and useful means

of alerting the American people. Since the 
publication of the report, this office has re-
ceived a veritable flood of favorable mail 
from all sections of the country evidencing 
a tremendous grassroots response to the re-
port's "Call to Action," which was directed 
to all public spirited Americans. 
I. A QUERY: HAS OUR "CALL TO ACTION" 55515 
ANSWERED? 
Has our "call to action," to which our citi-
zenry has responded so enthusiastically, 
evoked a corresponding response in the judi-
ciary? Has the report, with its nationwide 
distribution and its overwhelming receptivity 
by Americans everywhere, had a discernible 
impact on judicial thought? Can there be 
seen, as through a glass darkly, a potential 
change of direction in judicial philosophy 
emerging from the latest judicial decisions of 
the U.S. Supreme Court in the field of inter-
nal security? 
This supplemental report, prepared and 
filed pursuant to another unanimous board 
order of June 22, 1965, adopted on motion of 
Supervisor Ernest E. Debs, proposed to re-
view and discuss two recent decisions of the 
U.S. Supreme Court which were decided since 
the release of the county counsel's special 
report, and which acutely affect the country's 
continued and effective response to Commu-
nist subversion. The first case, Lamont v. 
Postmaster General, 14 L. ed. 2d 398, decided 
on May 24, 1965, represents a stinging defeat 
to our Government's efforts to control sub-
versive use of the U.S. mail system. The 
other decision, United States v. Brown, 14 I,. 
ed. 2d 184, decided on June 7, 1965, allowing 
Communists to hold union office, is highly 
disturbing to those engaged in strengthening 
our internal security, to management, and to 
the loyal segments of the American labor 
movement. Despite its immediate adverse 
effect, however, the Brown decision may well 
be considered as portending a change in the 
attitudes of the Supreme Court. In the final 
analysis, this case may signal the beginning 
of a judicial retreat from past inflexible posi-
tions taken by a majority of that Court.

COMMUNIST POLITICAL PROPAGANDA UNRE-
STRICTED ACCESS TO OUR DOMESTIC MAIL 555.-
TEM 
Communists consider their press and their 
publications to be the most important and 
effective tools for agitation, subversion, and 
propaganda purposes. Through the dissem-
ination of newspapers, books, pamphlets, 
leaflets, and other printed material the par-
ty, both here and abroad, indoctrinates its 
members and party-line followers and is able 
to reach and propagandize students, young 
people, and other segments of the non-Com-
munist public. Much of this Communist 
propaganda reaches the United States from 
foreign sources. 
The Congress of the United States in a de-
termined effort to control the large amounts 
of Communist propaganda originating in 
foreign countries from using our domestic 
mail system to reach an American audience, 
enacted section 308(a) of the Postal Service 
and Federal Employees Salary Act of 1962. 
This section provides in part: 
"Mail matter, except sealed letters, which 
originates or which is printed or otherwise 
prepared in a foreign country and which is 
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to rules and regulations to be pro-
:mulgated by him to be 'Communist political 
propaganda,' shall be detained by the Post-
master General upon its arrival for delivery 
in the United States, or upon its subsequent 
deposit in the United States domestic mails. 
and the addressee shall be notified that such 
matter has been received and will be delivered 
only upon the addressee's request, * *

profit from our example. 
One such leader is President Julius 
Nyerere, of Tanzania. In dedicating a 
hospital in Chimala built with a $70,-
000 donation from the members of the 
Church of Christ in Texas, President 
Nyerere told thousands of his fellow 
countrymen that "Americans are hard-
working people and we in Tanzania must 
try to follow their example." 
Religious organizations such as the 
Church of Christ are doing an immense 
amount of good work in hospital build-
ing and medical assistance in develop-
ing countries. The hospital in Chimala 
is the first one in the area. Its modern 
facilities, including a maternity ward 
and X-ray equipment, will serve thou-
sands of people. 
I am pleased that three Texans have 
been instrumental in planning and oper-
ating the hospital. Mr. Andrew M. Con-
nally, of Arlington; Dr. Ron Huddleston, 
of Post; and Mrs. Florine Smalling, of 
Azle; each played important roles 
in bringing about the success of the proj-
ect. 
I wish to thank President Nyerere for 
his generous recognition of and kind 
words about the work done by Ameri-
cans in his land. I hope that this is to 
be just one of many fruitful collabora-
tions between Americans and Tanzan-
ians. 
I ask unanimous consent that an AP 
story from Dar-Es-Salaam and an arti-

There being no objection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

U.S. HOSPITAL IN TANZANIA CITED 
President Julius Nyerere, of Tanzania, 
yesterday praised Americans during the dedi-
cation of a 50-bed hospital at Chimala for 
which funds were provided by 40 Church of 
Christ congregations in this area. 
Andrew M. Connally, a Church of Christ 
missionary who has just returned for a fur-
lough here from the east African country, 
said today the dedication marked the first 
time the President of a nation has opened 
a Church of Christ facility. 
Connally was active in supervision of plan-
ning the hospital?the first in Tanzania. 
Park Row Church of Christ in Arlington 
will supervise the hospital, and funds for its 
operation will be supplied by Churches of 
Christ in this area and individuals. 
THREE YEARS ON DUTY 
Connally spent 3 years in Tanzania. His 
parents are Mr. and Mrs. A. M. Connally, of 
3222 Avenue H. Mrs. Connally's parents are 
retired Fort Worthy- Fire Capt. and Mrs. 
Homer Franklin, of 4010 Avenue H. 
Both the missionary and his wife are grad-
uates of Polytechnic High School. Their 
parents, who are members of Polytechnic 
Church of Christ, were active in the hospital 
building campaign. 
The Church of Christ now has 43 churches 
and about 6,000 members in Tanzania, Con-
nally said. 
Dr. Ron Huddleston, a native of Post, and 
a graduate of Baylor University Medical 
School, is the physician serving the hospital. 
He will be succeeded later by Dr. Raymond 
Wheeler of Wichita, Kans., who is on the 
development committee of Abilene Christian 
College and a trustee of Oklahoma Christian 
College. 
REGISTERED NURSE 
The hospital's registered nurse is Mrs. 
Florin? Smalling. Her husband, Wayne, a 
former engineer at General Dynamics--Fort 
Worth, is an administrator at the hospital. 
The Smallings are from Azle. 
An area with a population of 100,000 is 
being served by the hospital. 
Some of the elders of the Park Row Church, 
accompanied by Connally, plan to visit the 
hospital next year. 
"Americans are hard-working people and 
we in Tanzania must try to follow their 
example," Nyerere said at the opening of the 
$70,000 general hospital. 
Nyerere said that through hard work Amer-
icans have become the richest people in the 
world and told the thousands of Tanzanians 
attending the ceremony that they also must 
work hard to make their country self-
sufficient. 
He expressed his pleasure at his country 
having the first hospital in the area and 
noted it included a maternity ward and 
X-ray equipment. 
A etter From a Serviceman in Vietnam 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOHN P. SAYLOR 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. SAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, some 
weeks ago I received a letter from Sgt. 
David L. Hogan, a resident of Pennsyl-
vania's 22d Congressional District who is 
among the thousands of American serv-
icemen assigned to combat in South Viet-
nam. Because it speaks for the many 
courageous men and boys exposed to the 
gunfire, machinations, and treachery of 
an enemy dedicated to the destruction 
of the United States and of freemen 
everywhere, it is important that every 
Member of Congress read this message 
carefully. Under unanimous consent I 
ask that it be inserted in the RECORD at 
this point: 
OCTOBER 20, 1965. 
Hon. Jonw P. SAYLOR, 
Congress of the United States, House of 
? Representatives, Washington, D.C. 
DEAR M. SAYLOR,: Here is a little letter 
that I'm writing for all of the U.S. service-
men in Vietnam. 
AMERICAN FIGHTING MEN 
I'm writing this letter because I, like so 
many other servicemen, serving in the Re-
public of Vietnam, are getting tired of getting 
A451 
the newspaper and reading about our fellow 
Americans putting on demonstrations back 
home, on the policies toward the Vietnam 
situation. It would be a lot nicer if when 
they got together, that they said a little 
prayer for the men in uniform that lost their 
lives over here fighting for the people back 
there in the United States, so that they can 
enjoy all of the freedoms that they now have. 
I, like so many other American servicemen, 
am glad that I was given the opportunity to 
come over here, knowing that I was gladly 
serving my country and all that we stand 
for. It kind of gets to the man in uniform, 
when he passes by a little boy or girl of about 
three or four years old, and the little boy 
or girl stands back and gives you a salute as 
though you were a four-star general, instead 
of a dirty GI, that has just returned from a 
mission or patrol. It makes you feel wanted 
in this far-off country. 
Mr. SAyLon, I know that you have received 
many letters on this same subject, but I just 
want you to know that us servicemen that 
are from the State of Pennsylvania are al-
ways in there doing what we can and are 
always pulling for you and the President of 
the United States. Give the President my 
regards, and I'm wishing him a speedy 
recovery. This is just a very small portion of 
?the way that the GI's feel over here toward 
the demonstrations. 
Thank you for your time in reading this 
letter and your kind considerations toward 
others. 
Sincerely yours, 
Sgt. DAVID L. HOGAN, RA13539745. 
Mr. Speaker, it would be gratifying if 
it were possible to report to our men in 
Vietnam that the demonstrations of last 
year to which Sergeant Hogan refers 
have by now been dissipated in the new 
surge of patriotic fervor experienced by 
the vast majority of this Nation's citi-
zenry. Unfortunately, such is not the 
case. Isolated bands of misguided dem-
onstrators, prodded by Communist prop-
agandists, persist in attempts to torment 
and to confuse in the hope that the U.S. 
policy will be reversed at the expense of 
the free world. 
Whether the strategy employed by our 
Commander in Chief and his advisers is 
wholly sound may be open to question. 
Many of us in Congress have expressed 
areas of disagreement in the conduct of 
the military mission in Vietnam. Yet we 
stand in solid support of our Govern-
ment's decision to carry out the commit-
ment to protect our allies against the 
perfidious and diabolical designs of the 
Red vultures in Hanoi. 
Though our fighting troops have every 
reason to resent anything less than na-
tional unanimity in appreciation of their 
efforts, Sergeant Hogan's letter is far 
from acrimonious. If it is asking too 
much for the anti-Vietnam demonstra-
tors to pray for the men who have lost 
their lives in the present conflict, per-
haps the very suggestion should stimu-
late increased prayer among the rest of 
the people in this country. 
It may be time for the churches of 
America to begin sounding their bells at 
an appointed time each day as a re-
minder to all men, women, and children 
that our men in uniform are putting their 
lives on the line in the crusade against 
an enemy of God and of freemen. The 
gesture would give further assurance to 
what Sergeant Hogan and his buddies 
have known all along: that most Ameri-
cans are grateful for the contributions 
of their fighting men and are praying

REMARKS ON THE OYEASION US THE COMMEMO-
aATIoN OF THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH-
DAY OE ROBERT E. Lt,E, BY FREDERIC SHRIVER 
PROFESSIR OF HISTORY, FRANKLIN 
& MARSHALL COLLE!.:E, LANCASTER, PA. 
On the 1st of jime 1962, on a battlefield 
only a few miles from Richmond, while the 
bottle of Fair Oaks wss still in progress, Pres-
ident Jefferson Davis turned to his corn-
tLenion and military .edviser, and said, with
warning, "Gefiered Lee, I shall assign you 
In the command of this army." 
Two events that could have been called 
chance or might Rom been destiny, had un-
eicpecteelly brought a new figure to the stage 
of American history. A stray Mullet and a 
piece of shell had wounded Gen. Joseph '1'. 
jolt:Liston, commander of the Confederate 
hirces defending Richmond; and his next in 
command, Gen. G. ?iir. Smith, suffered an 
e thick of what is isny (ridded battle fatigue. 
Davis' statement at that moment meant 
at it man who (al err wise might have played 
saEl y it minor role in OUT Nation's military 
hiratory- was to take a position cel reeponsi-
bility which was to win for him a permanent 
place 01 honor aim, respect in the hearts of 
eil. Americans, ete wed is to make him a 
symbol of a way (El life for all time. Robert

SE the Army of Northern Virginia tested less 
Loan El years, and yet in that brief span of 
tene he become a legend, not only for his 
'toyOr for Virginia or for the South, but 
Er ists Americans for generations so come. 
(tow did this mina capture the imagination 
and win the devotion of soldiers and civilians 
alike, who knew hale about him except that 
EEl ill 01W Ee inspired their faith and confi-
dence in his leadership? When he took corn-
':1 Ed. he was not widely known for his 
military ability, although Gen. Winfield 
nriett, who had seen Lee's action in the 
Mexican War, had stated that Lee was the 
seiry best soldier be had ever seen in the 
neid, and urged that Lee should be his sue-
sor in command o: -the Union Army at the 
iill,break of the wit:. 
But Lee came to his command with some 
Mie criticism for his failure to drive the 
"ederal forces out III western Virginia, and 
had even been referred to as "Old Granny 
Lee," because he had been overcieutions. tie 
Lad been in charge of the seacoast defenses 
i,r South Carolina and Georgia. with. sit 
m Al success, and his routine insistence OIL 
E he digging of defensive earthworks did not 
help his popularity with his troops. There 
were no enthusiastic cheers from the rasks 
-when the news of his commaad was an-
nounced, but Jefferson Davis had the same 
confidence in Lee which had been expreated 
by General Scott. The new commander's 
rtbility ass great military strategist was ye to 
be demonstrated, but it did not take lome 
become apparent. 
The Lee legend did not develop from in-
tdiring statements or immortal phrases by 
Lee Which crystallized the ,pbjeetives of 1115 
southern came into memorable slogans Or 
is anent crusade. He was not in the habi; of 
snaking them. It seems strange that theire 
are few, if any, statements from Lee wlach 
have remained in the memory or Americens 
Ii) typify his character or his ideals. His 
hitters to his family are informnl, warm, and 
wholesome, his military oi:diere are simple 
and direct, and his few fermi" statements 
ere. adequate but, not immortal.. Even she 
impressive General Order No. 9. his faresseell 
address to his troops, was drafted by his r de, 
Charles Marshall as normal stair procedere. 
His deeds were tEl be much mose signifidint 
Olaf i his wOrtiti. 
Nor did the Lee legend develop because of 
any dramatic emotional appeal, for he was 
not an exciting personality W.10 captured 
popular imagination with an image of a .'al-
lot reckless cavalier. There was none of 
the swashbuckling, sword-was' ng comara-
derie so often associated with the popular 
idea of the typical Civil War officer, gallop-
nig along the ranks or stirring his troops 
with fiery words. Lee was quiet, outwardly, 
but those who knew him beigi recognized -die 
constant activity of his alert mind. 
Lee's career in the 50 yesus bc'ore the Civil 
War throws some light on the developneint 
of the qualities which were to earn universal 
eriteem in the war years. Et is not strn age 
tuns he lass been held in somewhat of the 
inn reverence which hie; been given to 
Washington, for there was much of the 
Washington tradition in Lee's life. There 
!sad been an intimate rela tionship between 
his father, Light Horse Harry Lee, and. Cim-
ierat Washington and the legend of Wash 1g 
Ion must have played a promMent part in 
nee'3 boyhood days, even though Rob 'L's 
father left the country as an invalid Wien 
Lee was only 6 years old. But tele shadoy of 
Washington was constantly near 1,e,e, 
through his life in Alexandria and at ;Ar-
iing,ton, where he lived with his wife, Miry 
An:a Gust's, a descendant of 14:irtha Wadi-
ington. It was particularly app:opriate !sat 
the words which his father hae, used in de-
scribing Washington, "First in war, firs; in 
peace, and first in the hearts of his coon ry-
men," would be used with reference to bee 
when he was formally appointed a cesn-
mander of the Virginia military forces. 
Like his father, Robert E. ;Hee was I )1 i-
marily a. soldier, and within Hie relath-ely 
small circle of army personnel, he was reecig-
seized as an excellent officer, lie was second 
in his class at West Point. efficient as an 
englneer, and skillful in military tactics Cur-
ing the Mexican War. His on1;7 position of 
adirdnistratiye importance was his appecnt-
ment as Superintendent of We, Point Mili-
tary Academy, but he had acquired ss ime 
public recognition as the resell of his op-
pression of the John Brown raid at Harpers 
Ferry in 1859, when he was called upot, to 
command the troops sent to tin scene of she 
insurrection. 
So, in the fateful early months of 1M1., 
Robert E. Lee was a colonel of the 1st 
merit of Cavalry, 'U.S. Army, highly regateled 
by his superior officers, but nol; well knew:a 
to the rank and me or to the general public. 
He had not commanded large bodies of 
troops. He had no political experience and 
little political interest. He disapproved of 
slavery and of the idea of secession, but had 
made no impressive public statements, 'He 
loved his family, his Virginia home, and his 
chosen career in the Army. In these respects. 
there were many others like him. The re-
sponsibility of maintaining the Arlington 
estate occupied much of his time, and ini 
seriously considered resigning from the Army 
to devote the rest of his life to the problems 
of managing a Virginia plantation. He could 
not have foreseen that when he left Arling-
ton in April 1861 it would be lost to him 
forever. 
What, then, was there about this man that 
was to mark him for a place in our Nation's 
history among the great Americans of riff 
time? The 3 brief years of his Civil War 
career as an Army commander demonstrated 
almost immediately that he possessed two 
outstanding qualities that impressed friend 
and foe alike. His personal character repre-
sented the very best in the American tradi-
tion, and his military genius surpassed any-
thing in American military history up to that 
time, and for many years to come. 
The significant aspects of his personal 
character began to become apparent as soon 
as destiny selected him to lead the Army of 
Northern Virginia on June 1, 1862. Lee had 
a quality of quiet dignity which was as nat-
ural and normal to him as though he had 
been trained for a position of leadership 
during every previous moment of isis life. 
It was a characteristic which became im-
mediately apparent even to those who might 
have known him for only a short time, end 
which rarely failed to impress his aseociates. 
One of his acquaintances called him "the 
noblest looking man he ever saw," and the 
concept of nobility seemed to be associated 
with him constantly. It was recognized by 
contestants on both sides, and a northern 
newspaper, at the time of his death, only 
5 years after the end of the bitter war, 
called him one of the few men who through-
out the contest most nearly represented the 
idea of the true knightly soldier. Even au 
the height of the conflict, when both sides 
were hurling bitter and often exaggerated 
accounts of barbarities and atrocities, there 
was no chink in Lee's armor which could 
be attacked. "No man has so few enemies." 
wrote a British observer. Almost any officer 
could be, end usually was criticized for 
small personal vices, but Lee abhorred pro-
fanity, abstained from tobacco, and shunraid 
alcohol. He was a large, handsorre 
commanding in appearance, careful about 
personal details, and fond of neatness and 
order. He had a quiet humility which led 
him to take entire personal responsibility 
when failures occurred, and to refrain fro Tri 
criticism of others even when the faults were 
obvious. The New York Times commented, 
at the time of his death, "By his unobtrusive 
modesty and purity of life he has won the re-
spect even of, those who most bitterly deplore 
his course in the rebellion." It is significent 
that his former foes could deplore his steed, 
but they could not be angry or resent' fill 
toward him. 
This knightly quality, so often roman tic;;l1y 
associated with the chivalry of the obi 
World, was a natural characteristic and net 
an assumed pose, as was so often the case 
with some 01 the military. He seemed tc; pin-
sonify the aristocratic tradition?cordident 
and assured on horseback on the battlefield, 
friendly and sympathetic to his trocpFT, 
courteous and polite to his associates, gra-
cious and gallant with the fair sex, Iltld sin-
cerely religious with simple and confident 
faith. 
But it wits; not only the recognized nobility 
of character that raised the name of Robert 
E. Lee to a proud place in our history. 
Knightliness demands not only goodness P.nct 
gallantry, but a knight must be able to tight

that it is not the sole ravager of oysters. 
Rosenfield places a fungus called Dermo-
cystidium on the list of lethal pests, par-
ticularly because it is more active here than 
it used to be. There are also Minchinia 
costal's, only recently identified, and Bucep-
halus cuculus, an organism which, although 
it doesn't kill an oyster, renders it unable to 
reproduce. Ironically, it improves the oyster 
nutritionally. 
Nonetheless, because its invasion has been 
so sudden, dramatic and devastating, MSX 
has gained most attention. As Rosenfield 
says, "People don't care until it affects 
them." And in the past couple of seasons, 
MSX has affected a lot of Marylanders.

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. 
And as a matter of record, World War H 
began in 1939, exactly 25 years after the start 
of World War I in 1914. 
Nineteen hundred and sixty-six, then, may 
well be a year of crisis, for it is just 25 
years removed?one generation?from 1941, 
the year we entered World War II. If his-
tory is to repeat itself, as it has for every 
previous generation of American youth, my 
son David and his generation can expect to 
enter World War IH in about 1966. 
It is a tragic fact that many of his class-
mates have already paid the supreme sacri-
fice, in the present world crisis. 
? What of 1966? 
Will it be the year of great crisis, or is it 
to be the year of great opportunity? Will 
the United Nations, which just last Sunday 
ceased to be a "teenager," became "a man" 
and save the men of its generation from the 
catastrophe of another world conflict?a pos-
sible tragedy too horrible to imagine? 
Or will the United Nations fail to measure 
up to its ideal for all mankind? 
You can answer these questions by what 
you do or don't do in the next 12 months. 
Will you help or will you hinder? 
The U.N. needs and deserves your support. 
Will you help? 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. BYRD of Virginia. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the Appendix of the RECORD an article 
published in the Covington Virginian of 
Covington, Va., on Saturday, October 30, 
1965, and written by the Reverend Rich-
ard W. Buckingham, of the Epworth 
Methodist Church, of that city, entitled 
"Year of Crisis or Year of Opportunity." 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
YEAR OF CRISIS OR YEAR OF OPPORTUNITY 
(By Richard W. Buckingham) 
This is United Nations Week. Twenty 
years ago last Sunday, on October 24, 1915, 
the United Nations became a reality, for on 
that date a majority of the signatories?
including China, France, the U.S.S.R., the 
United Kingdom, and the United States?. 
had filed the necessary instruments of ratifi-
cation. Hence, October 24 became United 
Nations Day. 
We are a United Nations family; our son 
David, who was 20 years old last Sunday, was 
born the same day the United Nation became 
a recognized world force for peace. Not only 
so, the Atlantic Charter was issued "some-
where in the Atlantic" on August 14, 1941, 
and August 14 is my birthday. The Dumbar-
ton Oaks Conference in Washington, DC.?a 
forerunner of the United Nations Confer-
ence?concluded on October 7, 1944, and 
October 7 is my wife's birthday. And, the 
first United Nations Conference, attended by 
delegates from 50 nations, was held in San 
Francisco beginning on April 25, 1945; and 
April 25 is our daughter Mary's birthday. 
So we are truly a United Nations family. 
The United Nations will be a man, of 
age, its 21st birthday in 1966, as will my son 
on United Nations Day, October 24, 1966. 
Now 1966 is a year of possible crisis, for in 
1966 the United States will observe the 26th 
anniversary of its entrance into World War II. 
Ever since this Nation was "conceived in 
liberty" by the War of Independence, each 
generation of American youth has fought in 
a major war. 
To put it another way, in the 170 years 
from 1775 to 1945, when World War H ended, 
our Nation has been engaged in war about 
every 25 years. 
Vietnam: The Perimeter Theory 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. J. ARTHUR YOUNGER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. YOUNGER. Mr. Speaker, much 
has been written and said about the 
United States retreating to the coast and 
then setting up defense in a few enclaves. 
Mr. Max Freedman, a columnist for 
the Washington Post, presents some very 
cogent arguments why this is not proper 
action for the United States to take. 
His column follows: 
VIE'TNAM : THE PERIMETER THEORY 
(By Max Freedman) 
Neither a military nor a political case can 
be made out for fighting the war in Vietnam 
by withdrawing or limiting American power 
to Saigon and a few coastal areas. That is 
true despite the famous names, both in and 
out of Congress, that have spoken up these 
last few days in favor of this proposal. 
In essence this plan is based on the mis-
taken military notion that It is sometimes 
easier to defend a perimeter than a citadel. 
In Vietnam today there are no citadels and 
few perimeters. The United States would be 
doomed under this plan to be an occupying 
power in part of South Vietnam. after it had 
conceded and accepted defeat in the rest of 
the country. 
If this plan were adopted, the United States 
would find its strong points dependent for 
its food supplies on a countryside that was 
either controlled by the Vietcong or by vil-
lages who no longer cared what happened 
to American troops. It is impossible to think 
of a single valid reason why the people in 
the villages should lift a finger to help us 
once we had withdrawn to our own selected 
positions. 
What this plan means, therefore, is that 
we would seek a relatively stronger and safer 
position for ourselves by abandoning the rest 
of South Vietnam to the Communists. What 
assurance is there that we would in fact have 
any security? The Communists, scenting our 
weakness, and aided now by a population suf-
fering from a sense of betrayal, would keep 
up the attack. Cooped up in stationary posi-
tions, caught in a sort of weak Maginot Line, 
unable to use the military asset of surprise 
or to take the offensive, the American forces 
would soon find that their strong positions 
were in fact dangerously weak. 
But suppose this plan, in defiance of all 
military logic and experience, actually works? 
The United States, by its own decision, on its 
own authority, in defiance of its pledges, 
would be responsible for the partition of 
South Vietnam. 
? If there were any political leaders in cooped-
up Saigon willing to work with us, they 
would form the most despicable of puppet 
governments. They would have no author-
ity in the rest of the country with their own 
people. For the United States, in these 
changed circumstances, would have no power 
except the base and fleeting power of a 
military giant occupying part of a distant 
land that does not belong to him. 
It is being said, rather late in the day, 
that the United States has no obligation to 
fight to the bitter end to vindicate the ter-
ritorial integrity of South Vietnam. Putting 
aside that argument for a moment, what 
obligation have we to partition South Viet-
nam to suit our imagined miltiary con-
venience? If another country did this, we 
would denounce it as blundering and brutal 
imperialism, and we would be right. 
We would not, in reality, have even a 
perimeter to defend for very long. The more 
this plan is examined the clearer it becomes 
that it is the prelude to a settlement based 
on retreat, withdrawal, and defeat. 
The last touch of unreality is given to this 
plan when it is remembered that its advo-
cates have used the loudest arguments in 
the past to tell us that no struggle against 
Communist subversion can be won by guns 
and military power alone. The war has to 
rest on foundations of political, economic, 
and social reality. Above all a successful 
war has to enlist the sympathy and support 
of the ordinary people. 
The plan outrages every one of these prin-
ciples. It thinks in military terms alone. 
It cares nothing for the unity of South Viet-
nam or for the welfare of its people. It cares 
only about saving American lives and easing 
American burdens. 
It is not a candid and prudent limitation 
of American aims in a dangerous war whose 
end no one can foresee. It is selfish folly 
dressed up as a deceptive policy, and if it 
were ever tried it would be a shattering fail-
ure. 
The worst thing about war is that it for-
bids easy solutions. It makes no sense to get 
out of Vietnam. it makes even less sense to 
get half out. There will have to be harder 
thoughts and harder battles before the end 
comes into sight.

MSX : Deadly New Enemy of the Oyster 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
ko 
ION. GEORGE H. FALLON 
MAR '7 LAND 
fN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, the 
iffects of the prolonged drought in the 
Northeast are most evident in their 
everyday, dramatic aspects. The hid-
den, side effects of the water famine are 
just beginning to appear. 
Stiil one more effect is revealed in an 
xcelient article by James F. Waesche in 
the Laltimore Sunday Sun. He tells of 
he appearance of a bacteria destroying 
,,,yste.s and possibly, other seafood. The 
bacteria thrives only in salt water, but 
the lowered fresh water levels is allow-
ing the saline-living bacteria further 
progress in Chesapeake Bay. 
The article points uo the urgency and 
lw necessity for the overall survey of the 
Chesapeake Bay area, including Balti-
more Harbor, legislaton introduced by 
me in last year's session and passed by 
the House and Senate. President John-
son allowed funds to begin this study in 
his budget message. We believed that 
the sea nettle was largely responsible for 
the decline in revenues from bay prod-
ucts and recreation, but this article re-
veals the menace of still another enemy. 
The survey of the Chesapeake region evi-
dently should not be delayed. 
In an effort to give wider readership 
.;,) this article, I ask its inclusion in the 
Appendix of the REcoRn: 
msx: DEADLY NEW EN EM Y OF THE OYSTER 
( By James P. War:sr:he) 
A mysterious protozoan parasite, MSX, has 
been drifting, up Chesapeake Bay the way 
an invisible, odorless cloud of lethal gas 
would roll over a city: silently, but with 
disa Aeons effects. Wherever it has appeared 
eysters have perished and the industry de-
em:Mint upon them has collapsed. 
Delsware Bay was hit first. MSX wiped 
mit the oysters there in 1.957. In 1958 it was 
(iiscovcred in the month of the Chesapeake. 
n 2 years it had reacned the Maryland-
Virginia line?after ravaging oyster grounds 
to the south. This year researchers have 
found evidence of it as far north as the 
mouth of the Choptank. 
Already it has taken its toll in Maryland. 
i:riSlield has been particularly hard hit. "The 
oyster business here is dead," lamented a 
Crislielder close to the industry; and, al-
thong a its comments are more cautiously 
phrased, the Department of Chesapeake Bay 
Air:, M. tends to agree. "MSX has certainly 
out the economy of the Crisfield area," an 
official acknowledged. 
(It said, incidentally, that a few Crisfield 
rankers, desperate for oysters, are buying 
them in Baltimore, trucking them to Cris-
held, then repacking them and shipping 
them to out-of-State markets as bonnes 
la:licher; from the Seafood Capital of the 
Appendix 
The problem is not Crisfield's alone. MSX 
investigators are labeling the parasite "a clis-
tinct threat from Virginia north to the 
Hongsf." Also, they note. "more dead oysters 
have been reported this year than 'before." 
What's drawing?or what's propelling?
MSX up the bay? Changing salinities scien-
tists say. The oyster-killing parasite seems 
Lu thrive only in water containing more than 
1.5 parts salt per 1,000 parts fresh water. 
Until recently, Maryland's portion of the bay 
was never that salty. It has become so lately 
though, because of the prolonged drought 
in New York and Pennsylvania. Lack of rain 
there has greatly decreased the volume and 
flow of the Susquehanna River, which under 
normal conditions, supplies the bay with 90 
percent of the fresh water it receive.3 from 
sources north of the Potomac. 
Because less fresh water is flowing into 
the head of the bay, salt water from the ocean 
has been able to push farther end. :farther 
up the mouth, causing the isohaline?the 
imaginary line that divides the relatively 
salty portion of the bay from the lees salty 
portion?to move steadily northward, pro-
viding more and more "living space" for 
MSX. Al present the isohaline stretches 
from the mouth of the Choptank on the 
Eastern Shore to Cove Point on the western. 
It is 40 miles closer to Baltimore than it was 
5 years ago. 
"And it's getting higher," remarks Fred-
erick W. Sidling, chief of CBA's Natural Re-
sources Management Division,. ' Unless 
theres a change in the rainfall pattern, it'll 
get higher still." 
He points out that the is,ohaline, roughly 
25 mites long, crosses the bay as a sharp 
diagonal. It is much higher on the Eastern 
Shore than on the western. Several :factors 
cause this. One of the most surpri.3ing is 
the rotation of the earth, which tends to 
slosh waters from the western side of the hay 
upward and against the Eastern Shore. Then 
too, the deep channel is on the eastern side. 
"Creeping salinity" is, so far, one of the few 
concrete things that, MSX researchers have to 
go on. They know little about the parasite 
itself. The letters MSX, in fact, stand for 
multinucleate sphere unknown. Only one 
of the organism's life stages has been (denti-
fied?the one which lives in and kills the 
oyster. It may spend part of its life its some 
other animal, or in the water, or in both. 
Biologists: don't know. Neither dc they know 
how it is transmitted from one oyster to an-
other. Experiments have shown only that a 
healthy oyster cannot catch MSX from an 
infected one. 
Since its life stages can't be charted, its 
origin remains a mystery. There are, how-
ever, some hazy hypotheses. Sibling sum-
marizes them: 
-there are two possibilities," he says. "One 
is that MSX may be something that hes been 
here all along?something that underwent a 
sudden mutation and became lethal. But 
the chances of such a mutation, I feel, are 
rather remote. It would be like picking one 
star out of the sky.. 
"The other is that MSX may be something 
that has been introduced into these waters 
from another area--something that may have 
been a parasite in another animal, one that 
was resistant to it, that then found a happy 
home in the oyster. There are many chances 
for this to have happened in Delaware Bay, 
where there are so many oceangoing ships 
that may have had mollusks or fouling on 
1:1ileeirryh?ottoms. I personally lean toward this 
10  
The parasite could also have been intro-
duced by humans, he suggests, much in the 
(yay milfoil, an exotic weed that has spread 
nuchecked and clogged many a bay estuary, 
W as dumped into local waters from fish 
(Jowls. 
In an effort to replace the "X" with a good, 
long Latin name, research programs are 
:inderway in laboratories up and down the 
.'oast. Closely following MSX as it sweeps 
;fp the Chesapeake is the U.S. Bureau 
of Commercial Fisheries lab at Ox-
ed. The program there is under the di-
rection of Aaron Rosenfield, Ph. D. 
-One of the first signs of infection is in 
the gills," Rosenfield says, adding that some 
biologists have thus concluded that the pare-
:elm is waterborne. "Oyster blood cells 
:lock to the area of infection. This can be 
picked up on the microscope, so this is how 
we know that it infects the gills first." 
MSX does its damage, however, in the 
oyster's digestive tract. It seems to settle 
!here, multiplying and filling the space where 
: he oyster's food should be. Apparently the 
oyster starves to death. 
MSX is harmless to humans. "We've 
oaten infected oysters here in the lab," says 
f,troosuennlield, "and everybody's still walking 
d"  
Many people have probably eaten in-
fected oysters without knowing it. The 
parasite is tasteless. Its presence can some-
times be detected by a keen eye, however, for 
blanches the digestive tract, normally a 
((ilk brownish-orange. 
With so little known about the parasite 
Uself, biologists are hoping to stem its 
advance and salvage the industry by dis-
eovering in nature (or learning to breed) 
in MSX-resistant oyster. Hopes are based 
in evidence that a resistant strain seems to 
Pe developing naturally in Delaware Bay. 
Some 90 percent of the oysters there fell 
.:ictim to MSX in 1957. Ten percent sur-
en/est?either by resisting the initial on-
tieught of the parasite or, if attacked by it, 
managing somehow to "get well." (Rosen-
held says that in the lab an oyster has been 
-caught in the act of 'spitting out' the 
((rganism.") 
13iologiets call survivors a "relic popula-
tion," and they note that the progeny of 
(mch a population tends to maintain its par-
ents' resistance or immunity. There is now, 
lor instance, only 15 percent mortality among 
the progeny of the Delaware Bay relic 
nopulation, whereas oysters from other 
waters, when put in the still-infested bay, 
(fie en masse. 
What makes a resistant oyster different 
from a susceptible one? Rosenfield and his 
Laff are trying to find out. 
Rosenfield is spending most of his own re-
eearch time making chrernosomal analyses. 
There may be, he says, chromosomal ab-
liermalities in refistant (or even in SUS-
(rptible) oysters, abnormalities similar to 
I he one that produces mongolism in human:3. 
11 one exists, it could be possible to breed a 
new, MSX-resistant strain. 
Chesapeake Bay Affairs and Oxford are 
( ()operating in the anti-MSX campaign. 
Many of the samples with which the lab 
works are obtained by CBA. CBA also con-
ducts continuous sampling programs in the 
hay, checking both salinities and mortalities. 
"We're doing everything we can to keep 
track of it," Sieling says, "and we're tai-

PRESIDENT ACTS FOR AMERICAN 
FORCES 
Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. 
President, I believe President Johnson 
acted courageously and with sincere con-
cern for the protection of American 
forces by renewing the bombing raids on 
the Communist strongholds in North 
Vietnam. 
No reasonable person wishes to create 
a condition which can lead to world war 
III, but neither could the President, as 
Commander in Chief of our military 
forces, ignore the obvious buildup of 
manpower and warmaking materiel 
posed against our forces in South Viet-
nam. 
President Johnson made a noble and 
extensive effort to reach a peaceful so-
lution to the fighting in Vietnam and he 
was rebuffed. I hope he continues these 
efforts to bring an end to the fighting 
but, until that day arrives, the President 
is duty bound to give our young men 
risking their lives in the battlefields 
every assistance. 
No. 17-26 
We in the Senate should join him in 
this endeavor. He has my support. 
THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSED IN-
TERNATIONAL EDUCATION ACT 
Mr. MOSS. Mr. President, the Pres-
ident's International Education Act sets 
before us an agenda of what we can do 
to increase understanding between 
nations. 
We hope to strengthen our education 
here at home through this legislation. 
We hope to build bridges of understand-
ing between nations by offering and in-
creasing our technical assistance pro-
grams abroad. We hope to give children 
in other lands a "head start" and, finally, 
we hope to give to visiting students from 
other countries a chance to develop their 
full potential as future leaders. 
It is clear that a neglected dimension 
of our foreign policy has been cultural 
exchange. It is time now for a review 
and reappraisal of all our efforts in this 
field. 
I support the Exchange Peace Corps, a 
program to allow foreign visitors to come 
to our country, for it is clear that foreign 
students and teachers here can help in 
language instruction and can assist our 
schools in adding an international di-
mension to their courses of study. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS?RULES OF 
THE SENATE

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator from Texas will state it. 
Mr. TOWER. Has morning business 
been concluded? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further morning business? 
Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. President, a 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator will state it. 
Mr. McCARTHY. What is the status 
of the Senate rules under which the 
Senate is operating in this session of 
Congress? When were they last ap-
proved or adopted? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. They 
are the rules set forth in the Manual 
of the 89th Congress. 
Mr. McCARTHY. When did the Sen-
ate itself last give approval to those 
rules? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
last general revision was in 1884. 
Mr. McCARTHY. Periodically we 
pass upon the rules of this body. If the 
question of whether the Senate is a con-
tinuing body?
The PRESIDING CuotoiCER. The 
Senate is not required to pass on them 
periodically. 
Mr. McCARTHY. When did the Sen-
ate last take formal action with respect 
to the rules? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
were some amendments made at the be-
ginning of this Congress. 
Mr. McCARTHY. Some amendments 
were made, but there was no action to 
approve the rules with respect to this 
body. Is that correct? 
The PRESIDING OloriCER. The 
Senate made certain changes in its rules. 
Mr. McCARTHY. Might I therefore be 
in order to raise a question with ref-
erence to all the rules at this particular 
time? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senate can amend its rules. 
Mr. McCARTHY. If the Senate is a 
continuing body, as some Senators in-
sist, would it be in order to interrupt 
at this time to consider the amendment 
of the rules? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senate's attention is referred to rule 
XXXII, paragraph 2 of the rules of the 
Senate, which reads: 
The Rules of the Senate shall continue 
from one Congress to the next Congress 
unless they are changed as provided in these 
Rules. 
Mr. McCARTHY. In further parli-
amentary inquiry, what would be the 
procedure if it were sought to change 
the rules of the Senate in different 
respects? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. A pro-
posal to change the rules requires 1 
day's notification. Then it is decided 
by majority vote. 
Mr. McCARTHY. If the question 
should be raised as to whether or not 
there could be unlimited debate with 
reference to a proposed change in the 
rules of the Senate, who would decide 
that question? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is a 
? debatable question. Cloture could be 
invoked. 
Mr. McCARTHY. Cloture could be in-
voked. How would it be invoked. Would 
it require a two-thirds vote? Or is it an 
open question as to whether it could be 
decided by majority vote? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
question is debatable. It can be voted 
on by majority vote, but cloture requires 
a vote of two-thirds of Senators present 
and voting. 
Mr. McCARTHY. May I ask for prece-
dent on the requirement of a two-thirds 
vote for cloture under the rules of the 
Senate? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Parliamentarian calls the Chair's atten-
tion to rule XX, paragraph 2, in this 
particular: 
And if that question shall be decided in 
the affirmative by two-thirds of the Senators 
present and voting, then said measure, mo-
tion, or other matter pending before the 
Senate, or the unfinished business, shall be 
the unfinished business to the exclusion of 
all other business until disposed of. 
Mr. McCARTHY. What if it were 
proposed to amend that section of 
the rule? We cannot invoke a rule 
on a rule to enforce a change of that 
particular portion of the rule. We 
would have to go outside to look 
for a course of action in that in-
stance. Would not that question have to 
go to the Senate to be decided by a ma-
jority of the Senate, depending on the 
ruling of the Presiding Officer? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. This rule 
Is treated the same as any other rule of

Mr. McCARTHY. Therefore, that rule 
would be subject to the constitutional 
provision which allows the Senate to 
make its own rules. So far as we know, 
the Constitution allows the Senate to 
make its own rules by majority vote on 
any matter which concerns itself. Under 
the Constitution, that question can be 
decided by majority vote. Or is that a 
matter for the Supreme Court? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Rules of the Senate can be amended by 
majority vote once that question is 
reached. 
Mr. McCARTHY. The rules of the 
Senate can be amended by majority vote, 
but the question is whether cloture can 
be voted on a proposal to change the 
rules, or whether it would be subject to 
a determination by the Senate following 
a ruling by the Presiding Officer. Is that 
correct? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The at-
tention of the Senate is referred to that 
part of rule XXXII-
Mr. McCARTHY. But it is proposed 
to amend rule XXXII. Therefore, rule 
XXXII could not apply to amendment of 
rule XXXII, unless we have locked our-
selves into something which we cannot 
break out of. In most cases we go out-
side and rely on the Constitution. 
Let me raise this one point, and then I 
am finished. In order to amend the rules 
of the Senate under the present practice, 
at any time a rule of the Senate is subject 
to amendment by a Member of the Sen-
ate, subject to the action that may be 
taken by that body. Is that correct? 
'Me PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator is correct. 
Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. McCARTHY. I yield to the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CLARK. I suggest to the Senator 
from Minnesota and my other colleagues 
that the way to amend the rules of the 
Senate is very simple. It requires a 
simple procedure. All we have to do is to 
get a majority of the Subcommittee on 
;lutes and Administration to report any 
one of the 75 proposed rule changes which 
I have been submitting for the past 10 
years and bring it to the full Committee 
on Rules and Administration, where, if 
the chairman of the committee, our 
revered and beloved Senator HAYDEN, 
who is also chairman of the Appropri-
ations Committee, which has received 
permission to meet, will permit it to be 
brought before the Senate, I have no 
doubt that a majority would vote to 
change the rules. I am at a loss to know 
why the Senator from Arizona has not 
moved to report the proposed changes. 
Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. CLARK. I yield. 
Mr. PASTORE. On that very point, 
while it is true that a majority vote is 
required to change the rules, it would 
cake a vote of two-thirds of Senators 
present and voting for the privilege of 
considering the matter. That is why we 
are boxed in. 
Mr. CLARK. That is true; but under 
the rulings made by the former Vice 
Vresident, Mr. Nixon, if the effort is made 
at the time the Senate first meets at the 
beginning of a Congress, and if the rights 
under that constitutional privilege are 
reserved, the question is pending, and all 
rights are reserved under the Anderson 
motion to change rule XXII, which 
would bring it up, and even this motion 
would be debatable. 
Mr. PASTORE. That is true, but if an 
appeal is taken from the ruling, it is sub-
ject to debate, and it is subject to a two-
thirds vote to stop the filibuster. 
Mr. CLARK. But the constitutional 
ruling is that it is not subject to debate; 
and the present Vice President, if pressed 
hard enough, would so rule, I am sure. 
Mr. ROBERTSON. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield for a question? 
Mr. McCARTHY. I yield to the Sena-
tor from Virginia. 
Mr. ROBERTSON. I just read that 
the Research Association at Princeton 
reported--
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time 
of the Senator has expired. 
Mr. ROBERTSON. Mr. Presider t, I 
ask unanimous consent for sufficient 
time to propound a question. 
The PRESIDING OFFICE :R. Wit] lout 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. ROBERTSON. The Research As-
sociation at Princeton reported that only 
14 percent of the people in this Nation 
wanted the repeal bill to be passed and 
that the majority of union members did 
not want it passed. 
Why should we change the rules of the 
Senate to do what the Nation does not 
want done? 
Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. ROBERTSON. I do not yield until 
get an answer. I would like to have an 
answer, if one is available. 
Mr. McCARTHY. I believe we should 
not have a change of the rule for this 
measure only but for many other meas-
ures as well. 
Mr. ROBERTSON. Then, why bring 
it up at this time? 
Mr. McCARTHY. Action on anything 
can be prevented by 33 percent. Why 
should we not change the rules so as to 
give to 14 percent the right to pram-
tum that the Senator wishes to give to 
33 percent? 
Mr. ROBERTSON. May I ask the 
Senator another question? 
Mr. McCARTHY. I yield to the Sen-
ator for a question. 
Mr. ROBERTSON. If the Senator has 
any hope of getting enough votes to op-
erate under the present rules, why does 
not some Senator take up the arguments 
made by the Senator from Mississippi 
[Mr. EAST LAND I on the floor of the Senate 
last Saturday? His argument cannot be 
answered. 
Mr. McCARTHY. What argument did 
he make? 
Mr. ROBERTSON. The Senator can-
no :Li answer them. 
Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, are we 
in the morning hour? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senate is transacting morning business. 
Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President. I would 
like to ask a question of the Senator 
from Virginia. If he is so sure that 14 
percent want repeal, why not let the 
question come to a vote? That would 
be the end of the discussion. 
But I am already convinced that the 
only reason why they do not want this 
matter to come to a yea-and-nay vote 
and be subject to the majority vote of 
the Senate is that they do not believe 
what they are reading. 
Mr. ROBERTSON. I shall answer the 
question. The Senator will not find 1 
percent of the people favoring A. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. FULBRIGHT obtained the floor. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, I 
move that the Committee on Foreign Re-
lations be permitted to meet next Friday 
while the Senate is in session. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, it is with great reluctance and full 
sentiment with the request of the Senator 
that I make a motion to table. 
I wish to make it clear that the leader-
ship is eager to cooperate with the Sen-
ator to the end that his committee may 
meet. Any motion that committees may 
meet is subject to debate. 
In my judgment it would be a mistake 
for the leadership to permit the motion to 
proceed to the consideration of the repeal 
of section 14(b) to be displaced by a 
motion that committees meet . 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk called the roll, 
and the following Senators answered to

to request emergency action in the U.N. 
Security Council. Let us hope that here 
is an avenue that may lead Hanoi to a 
serious discussion of peace. 
We must be mindful, however, that 
Hanoi has as yet not disclosed a serious 
interest in peace, and today is indicating 
its indifference to any action which 
might be taken by the United Nations. 
For while we and others have sought 
since last April to bring Hanoi to serious 
discussions, a long record of terrorism 
and violence leveled at the people of 
South Vietnam has been the only 
response. 
It is therefore important that we real-
ize that we must continue to support our 
commitment to the South Vietnamese 
people and the U.S. forces there. 
This we will do; and I am sure that, as 
Secretary Rusk has stated, the United 
States will continue to explore the proc-
esses of diplomacy, both public and 
private, in order that any possibility of 
peace can be explored and tested. 
Turning to another, but related, mat-
ter, yesterday we received a message 
from the President, submitting his for-
eign aid program. This program is less 
than three-quarters of 1 percent of the 
national defense budget, and for that 
reason its extension can, in my opinion, 
be largely justified. 
I am delighted that the President says 
that from now on he wants to help na-
tions which help themselves. This is 
progress, because in years gone by we 
were willing to help nations under any 
circumstances, without any regard to 
whether they helped themselves or any-
body else. That was a rather immature 
approach in my judgment. For this rea-
son I welcome the President's intention 
to limit economic assistance to those na-
tions which help themselves. 
I suggest to the distinguished Senator 
from Arkansas [Mr. McCLELLAN] that we 
might even take a further step. We 
might even be so bold as to propose that 
some day we will help only those who 
help us. But I suppose that is too revolu-
tionary a proposal to bring up at a time 
like this, especially when so many people 
in this country do not even want to help 
the President. 
In his foreign aid message the Presi-
dent said that nine-tenths of the $665 
million earmarked for development loans 
is for five countries. 
One of these countries is Nigeria. On 
the same day, and almost at the same 
hour that the President was transmitting 
his foreign aid message to Congress, the 
Nigerian representative on the United 
Nations Security Council was refusing to 
support the American request that the 
Council take up the question of whether 
the United Nations should discuss the 
Vietnamese problem. In fact, all three 
African members of the Security Council 
opposed our simple and reasonable re-
quest which needs nine affirmative votes 
for adoption. I recall, parenthetically, 
that only last fall at the International 
Telecommunications Union Conference 
at Montreux, Switzerland, where I was a 
U.S. delegate, all 32 of the African dele-
gates refused to support the position of 
the United States in a matter of im-
portance. 
I have supported foreign aid to a num-
ber of countries, including a number of 
African countries. I expect to continue 
to do so. But I shall not be bulldozed 
or blackmailed or threatened by a state-
ment that any part of the world is im-
mune, or that any nation in the world is 
immune, from criticism because of con-
siderations other than their govern-
mental actions. When they do not help 
us, as Nigeria refused to help us yester-
day, we ought to bear in mind the limited 
resources available for development loans 
and take a good hard look to see whether 
or not we ought to spend them on a 
country that only yesterday, while we 
werd offering development loans to it, 
was saying to us, "We do not believe 
enough in free speech to permit the 
United States to take its cause to the 
United Nations." 
Fifteen Senators have submitted to the 
President their dissent from and con-
cern over his Vietnam policy. They have 
urged him to reconsider the course of 
action on which he has embarked. Some 
of them have been heard to say, "Let 
us take the problem to the United Na-
tions." So we try, and the next thing 
that happens is that we cannot even get 
enough members of the Security Council 
to agree merely to take it up. 
Most people, like myself, I suppose, 
thought that the only member of the 
Security Council which would not want 
to take it up would be the Soviet Union. 
But lo and behold, our longtime, great 
ally, France, joined Russia. What pur-
pose other than petty mischief France 
had in taking such action, I cannot 
understand. Whereupon the whole kit 
and kaboodle of the nations which have 
enjoyed our assistance sought to em-
barrass this Government, saying, "We 
will not even let you talk about it." 
If that is all that the United Nations 
is willing to do, we may have to say that 
we have run our string out there. If 
that is the case, we must stand alone 
with out valiant Vietnamese ally and 
with the assistance of a few friendly 
allies, such as South Korea, the United 
Kingdom, and Australia. For we must 
do whatever is necessary to bring the 
Vietnam war to an honorable conclusion. 
I think every one of us strongly sup-
ported every step of the President's peace 
offensive. Now, most of us are ready to 
go ahead to seek an honorable settle-
ment by using such force as may be 
necessary to bring about the negotiations 
leading to that settlement. 
I thank the distinguished Senator from 
Arkansas for his kindness in yielding to 
me. 
ReCOMMONSENSE FROM 
SENATOR FULBRIGHT 
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, will 
the Senator from Arkansas yield to me? 
Mr. McCLELLAN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the remarks 
of all the Senators who have preceded 
me, and to whom I have yielded, precede 
in the RECORD the remarks I shall make. 
I should like to preserve the continuity 
of my remarks. I feel certain that no 
Senator will object. - 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
1857 
objection? The Chair hears none, and 
It is so ordered. 
Mr. McCLELLAN, Mr. President, un-
der the same conditions on which I have 
yielded to other Senators, I now yield 
to the distinguished Senator from South 
Dakota. 
Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the Sena-
tor from Arkansas for yielding to me. I 
asked him to yield for the purpose of 
obtaining unanimous consent to place 
in the RECORD a transcript of the dis-
cussion between the distinguished chair-
man of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee [Mr. PULBRIGHT] and two 
noted Columbia Broadcasting System 
news correspondents, Mr. Eric Sevareid 
and Mr. Martin Agronsky. The discus-
sion took place on the CBS Network be-
tween 10:30 and 11 o'clock last night, 
Eastern Standard Time. It was another 
impressive demonstration of Senator 
FULBRIGHT'S uncommon commonsense. 
Much of the discussion centered around 
the issue of Vietnam, and our policy not 
only in that country, but in other parts 
of Asia as well. The discussion was a 
most thoughtful, interesting, and forth-
right statement of the issues. 
Near the end of the broadcast, Mr. 
Sevareid asked Senator FULBRIGHT if he 
thought that high ranking public officials 
could afford the luxury of public pessi-
mism. Senator FULBRIGHT offered what 
I believe to be a perfect answer. 
He said: 
It seems to me that we all get along 
better if we say what we think, whether it 
Is pessimistic or optimistic. 
That is a good admonition to all of us. 
It is sometimes difficult to speak out on 
controversial questions, particularly at a 
time when our country is committed to 
battle. No one enjoys the prospect of 
having his words twisted in such a way 
as to imply that he has somehow under-
cut what our troops are trying to accom-
plish or has undercut the national in-
terest in any way. But there has never 
been a time in our history when plain, 
honest talk was so desperately needed. 
And every Senator speaks for war or 
peace by his silence as well as by his 
words. 
We are involved in what I believe is 
the most dangerous venture in which this 
country has ever been engaged. We must 
turn every possible stone in an effort to 
end this war and to bring it to a con-
clusion before we are pulled into what 
would be the most disastrous develop-
ment that anyone could imagine, and 
that is a major all-out war on the Asian 
mainland. 
In my judgment the great generals 
who have warned us against that in the 
past have been absolutely right. I be-
lieve that it would be calamitous for this 
country to take steps which would bring 
on such a war. 
I hope that we will do everything we 
can to prevent that. I believe that the 
President wants to avoid that kind of a 
conflict but he needs to hear our honest 
convictions about this ill-advised venture 
in Vietnam. 
One way to avoid an even larger con-
flict is by honest talk. If Senators will 
only speak out and say what they really

Mr. AcreorisKY. Senator, do you feel the

Senator FULBRIGHT. Well, with respect to 
file referral to the United Nations, I cer-
tainly do, under the circumstances. I think 
this is the best thing he could do. 
have already expressed my reservations 
about resuming bombing. I think this is too 
wish he had been more patient about 
resuming bombing, I don't think that helps 
Bet, any case, he has done that and I 
don't wish to quarrel about it. I think we 
have to accept it. But I do approve of going 
I,] the United Nations. I know there is much 
skepticism about it operating, but circum-
stances have changed since that was last 
discussed. And I am hopeful, surely, that 
they will do something in the United 
sedions. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Senator FULDRIGHT, you spent 
a great part of your life studying American 
rereign policy and the history thereof. We 
are now suggesting arbitration of this war. 
Bas this country ever agreed before in a war 
stibmit to arbitration by others? 
Senator FTELBRU:IIT. I don't recall it. I 
toust say wouldn't want to pose as the kind 
ot expert your first statement would pose. I 
have spent most of my time in public life 
studying the problems of Arkansas and for-
eign relations are simply one of my duties. 
sot nevertheless I know of no precedent for 
ibat. But I think it is a good one under 
I ese circumstances. 
H. has progressed to the point where we 
have created the South Vietnamese Govern-
ment and we are committed to it by reiter-
ation of the word "commitment." I find it 
very difficult to find any what I call legal 
commitment through a treaty basis, the 
usual kind of commitment, thas we haw in 
NATO, for example. I find it very difficult. 
The explanation that SEATO is the origin of 
his leaves me very cold. I am 'tory dubious 
about the validity of these arguments about 
our commitment. It is a commitmeid, 
largely by reiteration of the word that we 
are committed. It is a kind of a self. 
generating commitment. 
But there we are. And., therefore, I h 1.ve 
i,o modify my feeling to the eatent thot 
would like to cooperate in getting out of 
this. It does me no good, really, to just say 
We shouldn't have been there. I am trying 
to explain Why there is so much feeling about 
this that is very unusual under these oir-
CUM s Lances. 
Mr. SEVAREID, Senator, Oa you feel that 
whit President Johnson his lac on doing in 
11-le last year in Vietnam IR inconsistent in 
line with the so-cylled commitments of P1" 'St-
dents Eisenhower and Kennedy? 
Senator FULDRIGHT. Well, President John-
son, in all honesty, inherited Ills situaton. 
It bad become quite substantial when he 
came onto the scene and he was presented 
with a very difficult situation. There was as 
many, as I recall it about 20,000 people of 
Our people there at the time of the Tonkin 
incident. That is substamdal but nothing 
like, now. 
I regret that the President ever started the 
bombing and that much greater effort, his 
offensive for petce which- ha; just been 
held?I regret that it wasn't eiriAged in be-
fore we ever became involved.. But thin. is 
hindsight. I don't wish to be too critical. 
Goodness knows, that is a difficult job and he 
did inherit a very difficult situation. And 
I don't think it is profitable or helpful to 
be too critical of that period :110W. Anil I 
have to say myself that I have played a part 
in that that I am not at all proud of, that 
at the time of the Bay of Tonkin I should 
lave had greater foresight in the considera-
tion of that resolution. That would have 
been a good time to have precipitated a de-
bate and a reexamination, reevaulation of 
our involvement. And under the influences 
I hat existed then, it was during just the 
beginning of the presidential campaign. 
I was very much a partisan in that Cu un-
paign for ,Johnson, for the administration. I 
disapproved of the statements of Mr. 0..1d-
water and I went along with the urging. I 
may say, of the administration. I think it is 
a terrible situation we are in. I am hoping 
we can find an honorable way out of it. I 
do not wish to see it escalated into a war. 
T do not believe in the Secretary's theory 
that this should be the proper place for a 
confrontation to destroy forever ,he idea tnat 
the wars of national liberation can succeed. 
Thia seems to me not an appropriate place 
for that. I think that if you in e ever going 
to have it?I hope we don's ever have it. I 
am not for any confrontation of that sort by 
violence. But even if you should have it, 
this is a very bad place and very had circum-
stances. That is why I think this history is 
significant. We should never have a con-
frontation where there is any doubt about 
the justification for our ir Artie alar part at 
that time in that particular incident. 
Mr. SEVAREID. The Secretary cri State, Sea-
l) for, seems to equate Communis; China w lIlt 
ifitler's Ger:many of the thrties, that is, he 
feels that this is basically an aggressive force 
that unless one stops them in the early stage, 
as ice Vietnam now, thinking again of Hitler's 
course of action, you will end up with a great 
big war. It will all get out of hand, Do you 
subscribe to that analogy? 
Senator PULBRIGHT. I am afraid I do imt. 
T do not. This is a very complicated .at-
uation. In the :first place, I think we have 
come to grossly exaggerate. at least the pres-
ent power, of China to carry a war beyond 
her borders. I mean, from the logistical 
point of view, naval, modern weapons and 
so on. She has great vast armies arid it 
would be a terrible mistake to invade her, as 
the Japanese proved and nearly everyone else 
has proved, I think, and agrees with that. 
I do not equate her with Hitler. China 
has a history that is quite different. Acta L-
ly, if you want to go into this, I think the 
Chinese have every reason to hate the West. 
I mean the history of Western treatment of 
China beginning, certainly, with the opium 
war is the most disgraceful period maybe 
that I can think of in our history. They 
have all of these furious feelings, hatred or 
the West. 
What we should be doing is to try to illid 
ways to rectify the terrible wrongs that we 
and nearly all the other Western countries 
inflicted on China. This is inbred in them 
It reminds rne a little bit of the feeling of 
the South after reconstruction, if I may mai 
an illustration. These things get in people's 
blood. It taices time to get over it. And tile 
Chinese talk very mad. They are very of-
fensive. 
But, coming back to Vietnam, I don't want 
to be too critical of it. As I say, I have ad-
mitted I made the mistake. I wasn't con-
scious of this. I am no expert on this area 
and perhaps I have no business talking about 
it. But you have asked me to come here and 
talk about it and in my position as chairmen, 
I feel I can't refuse. I don't profess to be 
any great expert on it. When I am asked 
to say something I feel I ought to. This is 
inure a feeling than, it is an intellectual anal-
ysis of all these elements. There is much 
about this I don't know. 
When they say only the President has the 
information to make a decision, in many re-
spects that is right. But we have to give 
advice. I think the advice that the Consti-
tution contemplated from us is to reflect the 
common man's feeling about what he does 
know about these things. My instinct is that 
the great United States, this enormous 
powerful country, becoming involved on the 
basis we did here, and taking it out on a 
little country of?whatever it is, 14 million 
people?to prove some vast point of the suc-
cess of the Communist plot, as they call it, 
is not very becoming to us. If we want to 
confront, if we really are confronting China, 
if this is really a threat, why don't we attack 
China or Russia and have it out with some-
one our own size? 
Mr. AGRONSKY. You certainly don't advo-
cate that. 
Senator FULBRIGHT. I do not, of course 
don't. I don't even advocate attacking North 
Vietnam. I don't at all. I think the whole 
purport of our policy should be the other 
way. I think we should try to find?because 
we can afford this. This business of our 
prestige to me doesn't appeal at all. If any 
country could ever afford to withdraw, we 
will say, or to mediate or conciliate--recon-
ciliating in this ease, we can. Nobody is 
going to think we are a paper tiger because 
we make a settlement here. After all, Rus-
sians have withdrawn in several instances, 
and nobody thought they were no longer oh 
any account in the war, that they are paper 
tigers, as they say. 
I don't know all the circumstances. They 
withdrew. They got out of Austria after it 
long travail. Then they got out of Azer-
baijan. They got out of Cuba. Why 
didn't they stand up and say our prestige Is 
involved. These Americans can't push in 
around and, by gad, we will have it out. 
am glad they did. I think they were wrong 
in going there. But this has some bearing 
on it. The United States isn't going to lose - 
on the contrary, I think we would gain a lot 
of stature if we were wise and magnanimous 
in seeking a settlement of this and I hope it 
will come out of the United Nations, 
Mr. AGRONSKY. Senator, the whole thritet 
of your observation seems to be that we 
haven't been sincerely seeking a settlement. 
Do you feel that we have been hypocritical 
about that?

Senator FULBRIGIIT: Well, you don't want 
me to make personal comments about our 
officials?I don't think that is a proper ques-
tion for me to say?hypocritical, I question 
the wisdom and I think this is legitimate 
always. I mean as a representative of the 
people of Arkansas, it is my duty, with what 
little information and judgment I have, to 
try to use it. And I do question the judg-
ment in this instance. And I think we were 
misled by this preoccupation with what has 
been called so often the international con-
spiracy of communism. And many people 
still use this, completely ignoring the split 
between the various countries. They say 
that is not true. It is just a trick, to trick 
us and to mislead us. And we have much of 
that left. And I don't minimize the danger 
of a country like Russia. The eventual 
danger?China. And now is the time to try 
to get this back on the tracks so that when 
China does become a very powerful country 
with capacity for aggression beyond her 
borders, she won't still be of the disposition 
to do so. That ought to be our objective. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Senator, you say you are 
questioning only the wisdom of these policies, 
but you have questioned more than that in 
the past. You have said in connection with 
the Dominican intervention that the Govern-
ment has not been candid with the American 
people, they haven't come clean with us. 
Senator Moms said the other day that if 
the files of your Foreign Relations Commit-
tee were opened, people would be surprised 
at what they had, I assume, not been told. 
How do you feel about this? 
Senator FULBRIGHT. Well, first these are 
two different ones. I don't want to get gen-
eralizing too much. In the case of the Do-
minican Republic, I think it is very clear 
that there was a difference in the announced 
objective of the intervention and the real 
objective of the intervention. That is the 
closest that I can think of, being of a di-
version between the fact and the stated 
fact. 
In the case of the briefings that have 
taken place over the years with regard to 
Vietnam, my best guess is that those who 
briefed us erroneously were themselves mis-
led and didn't understand the situation. 
I mean I cannot believe that people like 
McNamara, who is one of the principal brief-
ers, and Taylor?he is a man I think of the 
highest integrity. I wouldn't for a moment 
insinuate that they would try to mislead us. 
I don't think so. I think they are very fine 
men. I mean, and I have the greatest re-
spect for them. And I think that for rea-
sons I don't quite understand, what they 
told us about the situation, the progress of 
the war did not turn out to be accurate. 
Mr. SEVAREID. But, Senator, this raises a 
very serious kind of permanent question of 
how our administration actions and con-
clusions on the facts of any moment to be 
doublechecked. Maybe the press has failed. 
You have come in well after the fact on the 
Dominican Republic and said it was wrong. 
You have come along now, 18 months after 
the resolution--of the Tonkin Gulf and said 
that shouldn't have been done that way. 
Is there a way that the Senate, for ex-
ample, can be in at the takeoff?. 
Senator FULBRIGHT. There is no possible 
way for the Senate?we can't have a depart-
ment of our own, a CIA of our own, and all 
of them. We have six overworked profes-
sional staff members on my committee and 
we have always traditionally relied upon the 
administration and I think we always will. 
I don't think it is feasible to do this. And 
our function isn't to duplicate the State 
Department and the CIA. 
You will recall that there was a great out-
cry by the administration against certain 
journalists in Vietnam, saying they were 
misleading the public. 
No. 17-27 
Well, the journalists proved to be right, I 
think, by the course of events. The same 
way in Vietnam?in the Dominican Repub-
lic. In my view many of the reports that 
took place by journalists proved to be more 
accurate than some of the official reports. I 
don't know how this happens. Or why. 
Mr. SEVABEID. Well, what is the advice of 
the Senate if it is always well after the fact 
then too late. Then what is wrong with the 
mechanism. 
Senator FULBRIGHT. It isn't much good, I 
don't think. In many cases we usually go 
along with the administration, as a say, as a 
kind of general conscious of the people, I 
suppose. I can't recall many great contribu-
tions made to the foreign policy of this coun-
try. I can recall the Senate's action on the 
League of Nations, which I think was a dis-
aster. And they don't always do right and I 
may not be correct in my judgment, either. 
I try to be restrained about it. 
Mr. AGRONSKY. Let's pause for a moment 
and resume the questioning after this mes-
sage. 
* * 
Mr. AGRONSKY. Senator FULBRIGHT, North 
Vietnam has declared today that it will con-
sider any resolutions of the U.N. Security 
Council and Vietnam is invalid and it insists 
that we must go back to the 1954 Geneva 
Conventions. 
Senator FULBILIGHT. Well, as a matter of 
fact I have suggested, as others, that the re-
convening of the Geneva Conference under 
the chairmanship of Great Britain and Rus-
sia would be an appropriate way to approach 
this matter. President Johnson has from 
time to time stated the Geneva Accords was 
the basis for negotiation, the starting place, 
at least, to see if we could reach a settlement. 
So that if that is the way they wish it and 
they are willing to participate and the co-
chairmen are willing to call it, this would 
seem to me to be a very good recommenda-
tion of the Security Council. 
The Security Council, as I understand it, 
has sort of a free rein to recommend what-
ever they think might bring these parties to-
gether and have a negotiation. So I would 
see nothing wrong with that. I regret that 
they refused to come to the U.N. I would 
prefer now that it has been started that they 
come to the U.N. and znake -their own case 
even if that is the result. But I think it is 
terrible that they are so contemptuous of 
the U.N. 
I don't approve of that at all. But we are 
dealing with a fact and if this is the only 
way to get it, I see nothing particularly wrong 
'because this has been advocated?in fact, we 
urged the calling, the reconvening of it. 
And the British, I think, proposed it and I 
think the Russians refused. This was a year 
or two ago, if my memory serves me right. 
Mr. AGRONSKY. You have repeatedly called 
for the involvement of the Vieteong. Do you 
think they should be involved in this in-
stance again? 
Senator FULBRIGHT. It would seem to me 
that this is a purely practical matter, not a 
theoretical one. They are the army in being. 
We are told they have somewhere in the 
neighborhood of 236,000 to 250,000 men which 
Is the corps of the fighting in South Viet-
nam?so to speak, against the regime which 
we support, the Ky regime. I would think 
that they are a proper party to a negotiation 
because you negotiate over their heads and 
you arrive at agreements, if they are not 
involved why they can keep on fighting. 
And this could be a futile thing. 
Mr. AGRONSKY. And you feel that we must 
accept the Vietcong participation in this 
thing? 
Senator FULBRIGHT. It strikes me that it is 
necessary because they are the boys doing 
the fighting. They have the guns, they are 
1859 
killing our people and that is what you want 
to stop. If you have a ceasefire, who do you 
have the ceasefire with? You have it with 
Hanoi or do you have it with the Vie tcong. 
Who is directly?the theory of the adminis-
tration seems to be that Hanoi absolutely 
controls it all. I am not sure that this is 
clear, that these people that are doing the 
fighting in the field, I am sure they are allied 
with them, they are taking advice and orders 
from General Diep because he is the su-
perior kind of director. But they also have 
a being of their own. They have repre-
sentatives abroad. It could well be these 
people, having tasted some degree of con-
trol of their own affairs might like it and 
they might like to?in fact it might be wise 
to try to develop a little more division be-
tween the Vietcong and Hanoi. I think it 
might serve our purposes. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Senator, the Russians ap-
parently are moving into North Vietnam a 
little more all the time. Much talk of their 
putting in sophisticated weapons. They 
seem to want to get in a position politically 
between the Chinese and Ho Chi Minh's 
regime, to become the dominant foreign in-
fluence with Hanoi. Isn't it possible that as 
enough time goes by this war is still in, 
that settlement really is going to be made 
between us and the Soviet Union? 
Senator FULBRIGHT. They ought to be in-
volved. They are a great power in that area, 
not only that area but the world, and I think 
they ought to be involved. And, therefore, 
I am very much in favor of that. I think 
it would be a good thing. My guess is?and 
it is purely a guess, of course?on balance 
they would rather like to see this settled 
before it gets out of hand. Why else did 
they become?inject themselves apparently 
successfully in the controversy between Pak-
istan and India. This was, some of our best 
advisers in professional standards, said that 
was utterly impossible that the Russians 
could do anything. It was just a propa-
ganda gesture. But it worked. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Senator FULBRIGHT, the Sec-
retary of State has said recently that he 
thinks the world on the whole is further 
away from the danger of nuclear war than 
it has been in the past. I take it you don't 
agree with, that. 
Senator FULBRIGHT. I don't think human 
nature has gone through any great change 
in recent years. I think we are subject to 
many of the same ills that has afflicted us 
from the beginning. It is going to take a 
very major and persistent effort on the part 
of wise leaders to make a change in these?
in the kind of instinct feelings, emotions and 
so on that have resulted in war before. This 
is why I have had such great hopes that our 
country, with this unprecedented economic 
power, physical power, invulnerable in the 
sense insofar as you can, except now the nu-
clear weapons, to so many things that afflict-
ed other countries. 
There are no real ambitions for imperial-
ism, although we are accused of it. we 
might play a real leading role in changing 
the course of events that lead periodically to 
these wars. But I don't see any ground Or 
the optimism that you indicate. I didn't 
know the Secretary thought that. He didn't 
evidence great optimism before my commit-
tee the other day and I didn't realize he felt 
we were in a much better state than before. 
Mr. AGRONSKY. Might the optimism not de-
rive from the Secretary from his feeling that 
the Russians also want peace? 
Senator FITLBRIGHT. Well, I don't know. I 
don't recall his having stated that. I really 
can't read the mind of the Secretary of State. 
I think I am not a very good authority there. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Isn't it generally true, Sen-
ator, that people responsible for the conduct 
of policy, like the President or the Secretary

of State, just cannot afford the luxury of 
pliblic pessimism? 
Senator FULBRIGHT. Well, I don't know 
about that. You see it seems to me that 
we would all get along better if we say what 
we think, whether it is pessimistic or opti-
mistic. And I mentioned a moment ago 
Lula this thing troubles me about prestige 
and the nations have always been afflicted 
with saving face. I can see how a little 
eountry which is on the make and hasn't 
much to support it must be very conscious 
of its dignity and so on and so on. But our 
country, it seems to me, can afford to be 
magnanimous, for a small country cannot 
afford to, maybe in the eyes of the world. 
And it is-----because we could do things that 
no other country could do without people 
Winking we were degenerate or soft or weak 
or all that sort of thing. 
We wouldn't lose faith, in my opinion. We 
would gain face, in my opinion, if we would 
act wisely and magnanimously and gener-
ously in these situations because we can af-
ford it. 
Mr. SEVAREID. Sena tor FULERIGHT, I think 
we have come to the end of our allotted time 
here. You have been very patient, very re-
sponsive. We would both like to thank you 
very much.

PROPOSED REPEAL OF SECTION 
14(b) OF THE NATIONAL LABOR 
RELATIONS ACT, AS AMENDED 
The Senate resumed the consideration 
of the motion of the Senator from Mon-
tana I Mr. MANSFIELD 1 that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of the bill 
a.R. 17), to repeal section 14(b) of 
the National Labor Relations Act, as 
amended, and section '703 ( b) of the 
Labor-Management Reporting Act of 
1959 and to amend the first proviso of 
section 8(a) (3) of the National Labor 
Relations Act, as amended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator from Arkansas is recognized. 
Mr.. MeCLELLAN. Mr. President, 
earlier today, immediately following the 
morning hour, a motion was made by 
my colleague, the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, to permit 
Chat committee to meet next Friday 
while the Senate is in session. 
I do not believe that it would be a vio-
lation of the rule of germaneness for me 
to make brief comment upon why I voted 
on that issue as I did. 
The issue before the Senate at this 
hour is a motion to take up a particular 
measure for consideration. That mo-
tion is opposed. I am one of those who 
oppose the motion. I oppose the motion 
for many reasons. One of those rea-
sons--and it is sufficient within itself?is 
that there is vastly more important leg-
islation that the Senate should be con-
sidering at this time. 
I submit that anything whether ap-
propriations, authorization legislation, 
or simply information afforded to Con-
gress and to the public as to the true 
conditions and the problems that we face 
in Vietnam is far more important than 
the bill that is now sought to be taken 
up for consideration by the Senate. The 
Vietnam situation is far more important 
and certainly should be given prece-
dence over the pending matter. 
I felt that the Committee on Foreign 
Relations should be given the opportun-
ity to meet while the Senate was in sess-
ion. I would not make that concession 
to all committees. I believe that many 
things can well be deferred un til this issue 
is settled. However, the Committee on 
Appropriations is meeting te consider a 
request by the President for an appro-
priation with which to finance the war. 
The Committee on Armed Services is 
meeting, by consent of the Senate. to 
consider authorization legislation that 
may be necessary upon which to premise 
the requested appropriatons. 
I believe that the Committee on For-
eign Relations should be permitted to 
meet. I am not offended because the 
motion was rejected. I merely want to 
clarify my position. While I oppose tak-
ing up the proposed measure, I would not 
knowingly oppose, either on the floor or 
anywhere else, any functioning of the 
Senate with relation to the war effort 
which could contribute either to a vic-
tory in that war or which ceuld make a 
contribution to the bringing of the issue 
to a conference table so that negotiations 
could be pursued and an honorable 
settlement and peace cculd possibly be 
obtained. 
The issue before the Senate has no 
relation on earth to the war effort, none 
whatsoever. It is completely foreign to 
it. 
The general impression is, and I have 
not heard anybody deny it, taat this bill 
is here merely to keep faith with a politi-
cal promise made during the last elec-
tion. 
It has been claimed that we are at-
tempting to enact the legislation in or-
der to pay a political debt. I do not know 
anything about that. If such an obliga-
tion was incurred by anyone during the 
last campaign, or before or since, I am 
not a party to the agreement. I am not 
bound by it, and I am under no obliga-
tion whatsoever to anyone to perform 
any duty in keeping with any such com-
mitment that might have been made. 
I am here today free from any such 
obligation, free as I want tae laboring 
people of this country to be?and partic-
ularly those laboring people in my 
State?free to Join, a union ii they chose 
to do so_ or to decline to join if they 
do not want to belong to a union. 
I stated in my previous remarks that 
believe in the position I am taking end 
that; I am representing a great majority 
of the citizens of Arkansas whom I have 
the honor to represent. 
am confident that I represent a great 
majority of the laboring people of my 
State, the workers in industry, and the 
nonagricultural laborers in my State. 
Ever since the enactment of the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act in 1935--
which I supported while a Representa-
tive?workers in industry a:ad workers 
for wages and salaries throughout the 
land have had an opportunity to join a 
union if they wished to do so. 
Not only have they the opportunity, 
Mr. President, but hundreds of millions 
of dollars have been expended by labor 
organizations trying to persuade and 
induce them to join the unions. Not-
withstanding such efforts, a great ma-
jority of the workers in my State have 
declined to do so. So I think I am repre-
senting their viewpoint. I do not believe 
anyone who has declined to join a union 
would want me to vote for a law to make 
him join a union, and therefore I shall 
not do so. 
A while ago I heard the minority leader 
quote some poll statistics. I do not 
remember the exact figures. I am not 
familiar with those polls, and would not 
undertake to say how reliable they are. 
But if I remember correctly, he said that 
some poll showed that 65 percent. of the 
American people oppose this compulsory 
unionism measure. I believe he said 
another poll showed that some 44 per-
cent of union members throughout the 
country opposed it, and an even lamer 
percentage of the wives of union mem-
bers opposed it. 
Mr. President, I do not know whether 
such polls are accurate. If they are, we 
are undertaking to do something here 
that a majority of the American people 
do not wish us to do. I shall not under-
take to speak for a majority of the Amer-
iean people, but I do say that I speak for 
a majority of the citizens of my State. 
I say that again, Mr. President, because 
my State, by popular ballot, adopted. a 
constitutional amendment embracing 
the right to work?the right to work 
without joining a union?and prohibit-
ing an employer from discharging some-
one or refusing him employment merely 
because he belonged to a union. In other 
words, we in Arkansas have taken the 
middle course. We are fair to both sides. 
We have left the decision to the man who 
works. 
That constitutional amendment was 
adopted since I came to the Senate. I 
believe it was adopted in 1944. A few 
years later, as I recall, an effort was made 
to repeal it by referendum. That ref-
erendum, by vote of the people, was re-
jected. They declined to repeal that 
provision. 
Last year, while the Arkansas Legisla-
ture was in session, it passed resolutions 
entreating the Members of this Congress 
from Arkansas to vote against the pend-
ing measure. 
Mr. President, so far as I know, every 
sign, every test, in Arkansas, indicates 
that the people do not want their con-
stitution changed. It indicates that they 
are unwilling to change it; and as I said 
in previous remarks, I shall not do here 
to them, at the behest of the labor lead-
ers of my State, what they are unwilling-
to do, nor shall I do here that which is 
contrary to what they have done. I re-
peat that it is unfair for the labor leaders 
of my State to ask me, or any other 
member of the Arkansas delegation, to 
vote to repeal this provision of the Taft-
Hartley Act. 
It is unfair because they have a rem-
edy. The u_nions can, in the next elec-
tion?this year, :in November?by peti-
tion?and they have enough members 
in Arkansas to sign such a petition if 
their members want it?again have this 
constitutional amendment referred to a 
vote of the people. They elected not to

The LEGISLATIVE CLERK. The motion of

consideration of H.R. 77, to repeal section

The Senate resumed the consideration 
of the motion of the Senator from Mon-
tana [Mr. MANSFIELD] that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 77) to repeal section 14(b) of the 
National Labor Relations Act, as amend-
ed, and section 703(b) of the Labor-
Management Reporting Act of 1959 and 
to amend the first proviso of section 8(a) 
(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 
as amended. 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield to me briefly? 
Mr. McCLELLAN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that I may yield 
to the distinguished senior Senator from 
New York on the same terms to those I 
previously yielded to other Senators. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, the Senator from New York is 
recognized. 
l-YVENT'S NEW FOREIGN AID 
PROGRAM INADEQUATE 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I wish to 
make a few comments on the President's 
message to the Congress on foreign aid 
and his message today on international 
health and education. 
The foreign aid message reveals a deep 
cleavage and ambivalence between the 
President's deep concern with the many 
problems of developing nations and the 
programs he asked Congress to approve. 
If the President expects adequately to 
cope with these problems he has the re-
sponsibility to present to Congress and 
the American people a program that will 
meet these needs?even if it involves 
great new burdens. His foreign aid 
message fails completely in that respect. 
The principal failure of the U.S. 
economic aid program is that the 
total impact terms of public and private 
capital is vastly below the requirements 
of developing nations for development 
capital. This is a failure in terms of in-
adequate government assistance, inad-
equate incentives to encourage the flow 
of private capital to developing coun-
tries, and inadequate economic aid con-
tributions obtained from other indus-
trialized countries through the Develop-
ment Assistance Committee of the 
OECD. 
The gap between nations in the devel-
oping status and nations in the devel-
oped status is not narrowing but widen-
ing. We are not being told how it is to 
be closed. This is the greatest barrier 
to world peace and security that we 
face. 
The Advisory Committee on Private 
Enterprise in Foreign Aid in its report of 
August 25, 1965, estimated the "gap" be-
tween developing countries' needs for 
capital and what they are likely to get 
from all sources at between $5 billion and

'rqe PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senate will be in order. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
den a the Senator from Arkansas has 
moved that the Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations be permitted to meet 
while the Senate is ill session on Friday. 
A u oanimous-consent request was made 
to that effect during the morning hour, 
and it was objected to. 
So far as I am concerned, I should be 
balmy to have the committee meet, and 
pleased to have the unanimous-consent 
request granted. But, Mr. President, I 
know a dilatory motion when I hear one. 
We are now attempting to get H.R. 77 
before the Senate upon a motion to pro-
ceed. Senators who wish to oppose that 
motion are entitled to two speeches dur-
ing any one legislative day. A number 
of such speeches have now been made. 
If this motion for the Foreign Relations 
Committee to be permitted to meet is 
permitted to come before the Senate, it is 
a debatable motion, and every Senator 
can make two speeches on it. Further-
more, such a motion is subject to amend-
ment, which is not exactly the case with 
a motion to proceed. Therefore, every 
Senator would be entitled to offer 
sanendments. There is no assurance 
whatever, if this motion that the For-
eign Relations Committee be permitted 
to meet on Friday is permitted to dis-
place the pending business, that the Sen-
,011.11 
ate will agree to the motion before Fri-
day, because the motion is debatable as 
well as subject to amendment; arid such 
procedures could consume the time of 
the Senate until next Monday or the end 
of next week--merely debating whether 
a committee is to be permitted to meet. 
Mr. President, the leadership will coop-
erate with the Senator from Arkansas. 
If it must be done, the Senate will recess 
so that his committee can be called 
together. 
But, Mr. President, if this debatable 
motion is permitted to displace the mo-
tion to proceed. to consider H.R. 77, we 
might as well forget about the whole 
thing, and lay 14(b) aside; because other 
mations of similar merit can be made, 
and the end result will be that we shall 
spend all our time debating whether 
committees should meet, rathea than 
hearing the speeches which must be 
heard before we finally come to a vote 
on the motion to make the consideration 
of H.R. 77 the pending business of the 
nenate. 
(The VICE PRESIDENT assumed the 
chair at this point.) 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that I 
may yield to the Senator from Arkansas 
for 3 minutes, without losing my right 
to the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there ob-
jection to the request of the Senator 
from Louisiana? The Chair hears none. 
The Senator from Arkansas is recog-
nized. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, I 
did not make this as a dilatory motion. 
All I want is permission for my commit-
tee to meet. 
There have been suggestions that we 
could arrange to have meetings after 
hours; but I would like to have one meet-
ing of the committee at least to consider 
the procedure, and to make a.:;range-
ments for meetings after hours, it we are 
not to be permitted to meet while the 
Senate is in session. 
If the Senator from. Louisiana thinks 
this motion is dilatory in nature, would 
he entertain a unanimous-consent re-
quest that the Senate vote within 10 
minutes after the motion is stated, or 
that we have at least 10 minutes to dis-
cuss the reason for it? 
There is confusion about this daestion. 
If Senators vote to permit the committee 
to meet on Friday, there is nothing dila-
tory about that, if we can get it RH a vote. 
All the Senator from Arkansas is worried. 
about is getting it to a vote within a rea-
sonable time. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Let us find 
out. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimoos con-
sent that debate on the motion of the 
Senator from Arkansas be limited to 5 
minutes, with the time to be equally 
divided between the majority and minor-
ity leaders. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. .Is there ob-
jection to the request of th.e ,3enator 
from Louisiana? 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I object. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Objection is 
heard. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, the 
only simple question upon which I seek 
a vote is, May my Committee on Foreign 
Relations meet 1 day, on Friday? 
The Appropriations Committee is 
meeting today and every day, as is the 
Armed Services Committee. I am ask-
ing for nothing but a 1-day meeting, and 
that is all. 
I do not wish to delay the considera-
tion of HR. 77 on this ground; I wish to 
delay it upon its own merits, and I pro-
pose to do so. I do not need to delay it 
by means of this motion. That was not 
my motive in making it. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, I have discussed this matter with 
the majority leader, and we agree that 
we will find a way for the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee to meet, notwithstand-
ing the objections which have been made, 
to consider the vital matters pending 
before it, and we will cooperate and work 
with the Senator from Arkansas to that 
affect. 
We will cooperate with the Senator, of 
course, to that effect. How we will do it. 
I do not know. I hope that the Senator 
will withdraw his motion. If he does 
not, I am compelled to insist on moving 
to lay it on the table. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. If the Senator will 
yield, I wish to announce now, whether 
this question is voted on or not, that I in-
tend to call a committee meeting at 9:30 
in the morning, to consider certain pro-
cedural matters ; but I should like to have 
a meeting next Friday to hear David Bell 
and get the matter of the supplemental 
appropriation underway. I am sitting 
here and everyone is blaming me for 
do:ing it, but they do not understand that 
my committee cannot meet because of the 
rules of the Senate. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, if 
the Senator will yield, the only sugges-
tion I could make would be that the 
Committee on Foreign Relations meet at 
8 o'clock in the morning. It appears to 
me that that would give them time to get 
started. If the members are given suf-
ficient notice, they w:ill be present. But, 
certainly, we cannot set aside section 14 
(b) . There ha:; been too much going on 
in the way of dilatory tactics in laying 
this measure before the Senate. I do not, 
of course, attribute any dilatory tactics 
to the Senator from Arkansas. He is 
really desirous of trying to conform to 
the wishes of the administration. I 
would assume that those who are opposed 
to committee meetings know that a mat-
ter such as Vietnam should be considered, 
and that is what the chairman of the 
committee is trying to do. But, so far as 
section 14(b) is concerned, it will not be 
set aside until it is disposed of one way 
or the other. The only suggestion I can 
make would be for the committee to meet 
earlier, before the Senate meets, or to 
meet late in the evening after the Senate 
has recessed. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, I move to table the motion 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, will 
the Senator from Louisiana yield? 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Will the 
Senator from Louisiana withhold his 
motion?

$20 billion annually. The United State 
is on record in full support of the Unite 
Nations goal of having each industrial 
ized country make available for develop 
ment assistance the equivalent of 
percent of its gross national product. I 
1964, this would have amounted to tota 
U.S. economic assistance to developin 
nations of $5.8 billion, or 25 percen 
above the actual level; and in 1966 ove 
$7 billion or about twice what the Presi 
dent is asking for. In contrast, the net 
flow of public long-term U.S. capital to 
developing nations in 1964 totaled $3.3 
billion. Net long-term private U.S 
capital to developing countries that yew 
totaled $1.3 billion. 
The remedy is twofold: a drastic shift 
toward private sector participation in 
foreign aid and a major increase in U.S 
governmental aid. We are failing to 
meet our obligations on both counts. 
This is clear whether we use the Watson 
committee's estimate of the "gap" or our 
pledge under the 1960 U.N. "decade of 
development" resolution. 
I particularly regret the lack of em-
phasis on private enterprise coopera-
tion in the foreign aid message. The 
report of the Advisory Committee on 
Private Enterprise in Foreign Aid, which 
resulted from my amendment to the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1963, has been 
filed 5 months ago, yet I see little evi-
dence in the message that the recom-
mendations of that distinguished com-
mittee have yet been implemented. The 
President states that many of the com-
mittee's recommendations are now being 
put into effect. On January 17 I re-
quested David Bell, Administrator of 
AID, to advise me the extent to which 
the Watson Committee's recommenda-
tions have been implemented. Congress 
has every right to get a full accounting 
on that score before it approves any 
aspect of the administration's foreign 
aid program. A shift towards the maxi-
mum involvement of private enterprise is, 
in my opinion, as vital as the 5-year 
authorization for economic and military 
aid requested by the President or the sep-
aration of requests for economic aid from 
military assistance. 
Funds provided for economic and 
social development in Vietnam reflect 
the continued failure of the administra-
tion to accord as high a priority to the 
social, political, and economic aspect of 
the Vietnam struggle as to the military 
aspects. The resolution of social and 
economic questions will, in the long run, 
determine whether or not freedom really 
wins out in Vietnam. For fiscal year 
1967 the -President is requesting $648 
million in economic aid including $98 
million for Public Law 480 assistance. 
In addition, substantial portion of $100 
million requested on January 19 for the 
contingency fund in the fiscal year 1966 
supplemental, may be available for un-
foreseen requirements in Vietnam, in-
cluding economic. While this represents 
a substantial increase over his original 
request for fiscal year 1966?$330 mil-
lion, including $64 million for Public 
Law 480?it is dwarfed by his request for 
$10 billion to wage the military struggle 
in Vietnam. 
There are many features in the Presi-
d dent's message, however, which deserve 
- support: 
I favor the President's determination

FOREIGN' AID 
The somber backdrop against which our 
foreign aid program must be measured has 
been drawn for us by World aink President 
George D. 'Woods. Per capita income in the 
United States, writes Woods in the current 
Foreign Affairs, will spiral from its present 
level of $3,000 per year to $4,500 by the end 
of the century if it continues to grow at 
current rates; in the 40 poorest developing 
countries, by contrast, the figure will go at 
best from $120 to $170 per year.

President would eventually throw up Ids 
hands in impatience and exasperation after 
so many years of aid and so little evidence 
that the intractable problems of food deficits 
and runaway population growth are near a 
solution. Year after year, aid budgets have 
been oversold with glittering promises of an 
early "takeoff" which have had little rela-
tion to the enormity of the development 
challenge. Yet viewed in perspective, as 
Woods makes clear, the aid programs of the 
United States and the international agencies 
have failed to achieve a breakthrough in part, 
at least, because they have been far too small 
in the light of the size of the problem. In 
striking out on new paths, therefore, the 
President should make unmistakably clear 
that he is not simply turning away from the 
costly road of increased development lending. 
The President is clearly giving important 
new world leadership in focusing attention 
on the population problem and on the need 
for more urgent action to bring population 
and food resources into balance. His sep-
arate message on food aid policy will be 
awaited with keen interest. In themselves. 
the President's modest increases in the aid 
budget of $125 million for agricultural de-
velopment, $67 million for education abroad 
and $60 million in the health field are all wel-
come improvements in the aid field. 'Re-
grettably, however, these promising new de-
partures have been achieved not as part of 
an overall budgetary increase but rather at 
the expense of development lending.

Mr. SCOTT. I thank the distin-

courtesy. 
As regards the senior Senator from 
New York, I have been immensely grati-

ing his support of the course taken by

I know that he has done this notwith-

dissent in his constituency, as there is in 
mine on this matter. 
I wish to congratulate him for the 
courage he has shown in taking the posi-

Mr. JA'VITS. I thank the Senator very 
much. I think very highly of the Senator

general search for peace, such as the United 
States has already, informally, asked the 
U.N. to undertake. This would include a 
conference, with the objective of applying the 
Geneva accords of 1954 and 1962 (the latter 
concerned Laos) and of setting up and su-
pervising a cease-fire. Composition of the 
conference is not spelled out; the door re-
mains open for mediation or arbitration, as 
suggested by Pope Paul. 
The effect of such a resolution would bring 
pressure upon the Soviet Union to do what it 
has thus far refused to do?sponsor another 
session of the Geneva conference. It would 
also, if adopted (or even if accepted by a 
majority and lost through a Soviet veto) 
furnish Security Council support for Amer-
ican peace efforts. And in any case, by ac-
companying the bombs with a resolution, 
President Johnson dramatizes anew the 
American position: to fight if necessary; to 
negotiate if possible.

other side would join us in such a de 
facto deescalation of the fighting, which 
in turn could lead to some kind of cease-
fire with unconditional discussions of the 
overall problems of peace in that entire 
area. 
Certainly, the President is to be con-
gratulated on his decision to bring the 
situation in Vietnam before the United 
Nations as an additional step in his effort 
to explore every possibility of promoting 
the cause of peace in that war-torn part 
of the world. 
But it seems to me that it was most un-
fortunate that the resumption of the 
bombing of North Vietnam was not de-
ferred at least until there was some evi-
dence of the success or failure of the 
President's outstanding effort to enlist 
the help of the U.N. in finding a peaceful 
and honorable settlement of the conflict 
in Vietnam. 
A Vanishing Breed: The Good Policeman 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 19, 1966 
Mr. ROYBAL. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to express my deep disappointment 
and regret that President Johnson felt 
it necessary this week to resume the 
bombings in North Vietnam. 
Some time ago I joined with several 
of my colleagues in the House of Repre-
sentatives in voicing to the President our 
considered thought on this vitally impor-
tant subject. In our letter, we enthu-
siastically endorsed the month-long 
bombing pause over North Vietnam as an 
imaginative and integral part in the 
President's worldwide diplomatic peace 
offensive. 
Specifically, we declared: 
While the response from the other side has 
not been encouraging, we do not believe we 
should yet assume that the door has been 
firmly closed. We cannot expect that a con-
flict which has raged so bitterly for so long 
will be quickly or easily resolved. Neither 
can we ignore the alternative , to negotia-
tions, a prolonged and probably expanded 
war with attendant costs in human suffering 
and material resources. * * * We recognize 
that there are those who urge a resumption 
of bombings of North Vietnam and a pre-
mature abandonment of our peace efforts. 
We are, however, concerned that unless we 
can halt or reverse the escalation of the last 
months it will become increasingly difficult 
to achieve a further pause, a cease-fire, and 
meanginful negotiations. We urge you, 
therefore, to continue your present deter-
mined search for peace until such time as it 
becomes clear that no reasonable hope re-
mains for a just settlement by peaceful 
means. 
Because of the great danger of con-
tinued escalation of the conflict in south-
east Asia, I had joined in the hopes and 
prayers of millions of Americans that it 
would not be necessary to resume the 
aerial bombings in the North. 
It was our fervent desire that the ini-
tial pause could be followed by a more 
general reduction in hostilities both on 
the ground and in the air?in the south 
as well as in the north?and that the 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, there 
are sinister forces at work throughout 
the country attempting to undermine 
basic respect for law and order, which 
has been one of our fundamental na-
tional virtues. 
Columnist John Vrtis, writing in the 
Suburban Life, devotes attention to the 
very crucial question, that of the main-
tenance of an effective police force by our 
local communities. His direct comments 
apply to communities in suburban Cook 
County, Ill., but the overall question 
under discussion is pertinent to all areas 
of the country.

The principal causes, however, extend far 
beyond shortsighted officials and touch each 
of us. Even in today's courts, few of us 
could escape indictment on at least one of 
the following six charges. 
(1) Respect for law and order is out of 
fashion. , Ask any cop and he will tell you 
that today's youngsters and many adults 
think more of Darwin's law of the survival 
of the fittest than of the Ten Command-
ments. Where once the officer on the corner 
was like a John Wayne with the kiddies, to-
day he is on a par with Mickey Mouse in 
meaning, if not in amusement, among mem-
bers of the "beat" generation. 
(2) Court and legislative support for po-
licemen is virtually nonexistent. Volumes 
could be printed on this, but any conscien-
tious officer has got to be demoralized when 
many of his best crime-fighting techniques 
are inadmissible in court; when a single 
technicality will overturn an "airtight" case; 
and, where convictions are obtained, see light 
sentences imposed that can only serve to en-
courage present and would-be criminals. 
It appears that the present stream of legal 
and legislative decisions protecting rights of 
individuals is pushing the right of a com-
munity to law and order into the gutter as 
just so much "rubbish." Police state meas-
ures can never be permitted under our form 
of government, but neither can unbridled 
individual freedom. Some balance between 
extremes must be sought * * * and found. 
(3) Policemen are often more on the de-
fensive than the offensive. Recall last year's 
unfortunate incident in Chicago where a 
much decorated officer was put "on the car-
pet" for defending himself against assault 
by a prisoner. 
Front-page publicity did manage to con-
jure a stream of protest, but the incident only 
brought more clearly into focus the erosion 
of self-respect and authority that once was 
the hallmark of a police officer. 
(4) Policemen are not paid enough. Al-
most any union man makes more than he 
does, yet a police officer is called upon to have 
the wisdom of Solomon, the mercy of Christ, 
and the courage of a frontline marine. 
If the cop ever does anything wrong, he 
is held up for public ridicule like a Judas, 
and when he does something right, it usually 
goes unrecognized until he fails to do it in 
the future. 
Yet all of this time the same cop is packing 
a gun to protect us and the quality of his 
performance will surely reflect itself in the 
community. His low pay does nat make 
sense. 
(5) Youngsters are "smart" enough to look

EXTPNeION OF REMARKS 
CIF 
PON. BOB CASEY 
OF TEXA. 
IN THI HOUSE OF REPaESENTATIll 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. CASEY, Mr. Spelker, during he 
recent adjournment of illoneTe::ei, it :ens 
my great privileee to viret with memhers 
of our Armed Forces on the battleline in 
Vietnam, 
The most common eoestion. asken cf 
me by these valiant younl. men was 
whether, ill I if Opinion, ti is Cone sess 
would enact a Veteran's boaeat bill to t 
enable them .to pursue their educatinai, t 
and ease the h. mden of readiustment 1;0 a 
civilian life. I assured them that from 
my personal conversations with many of 
my colleagues, in my judgment this 
Congress would not ignore the great 
need to help the veterans who have sac-
rifled no much in the cause of freedom. 
And I gave them my promise .that I 
certainly would do all I could to help in 
getting such legislation passed. 
Today, I keep my promise to these val-
iant men who serve our Nation in our 
Armed Forces, 
Today, I have introduced a bill to pro-
vide edneational assistance for ad vet-
erans who served after January 31, 1955, 
and to provide for loan guarantee Kovi-
sions for housing. This bill also makes 
a number of miscellaneous provisions, in. 
my judernent, long needed to assist the 
veterans regardless of whether. their 
service was classed as peacetime m war-
time. My bill is identical to that intro-
duced by my friend and colleague, the 
gentleman from Texas, Representative 
OLIN TEAGUE, the distinguished chairman 
of the House Veterans' Affairs Commit-
tee. 
This bill provides a permanent oro-
gram of education assistance for indi-
viduals serving after January 31, 1955, on 
the basis of a month of training for each 
month, or fraction thereof, of service, not 
to exceed 36 calendar months. The 
rates for full-time training set at $100 
per month for a single veteran, $125 for 
a veteran with one dependent, and $150 
for a veteran with more than one de-
pendent, and proportionate rates for less 
than full time. 
The education provisions are effective 
June 1, 1966, and education must be com-
pleted within 8 years of the date of dis-
charge. 
This bill provides for guaranteed and 
direct loans, with the VA guaranteeing as 
much as a maximum of $7,500 of any 
loan by private, lenders, and authorizes 
direct loans where private financing is 
not available to a maximum of $17,500. 
Among the miscellaneous provisions of 
the bill: 
Extends presumptions on chronic and 
tropical diseases. 
Grants medical care for non-service-
connected veterans. 
Provides job counseling and job 1)7s:ce-
ment assietance. 
Authorizes a flag to drape the casket of 
veterans of this service. 
Grants preference in Federal employ-
ment. 
Amends the Soldiers and Sailors Civil 
Relief Act to increase the protection of 
individual:3 who are renting homes when 
they are called into service from the $80 
monthly rental to $150. 
Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues know, I 
do not serve on the House Veterans' Af-
fairs Committee, and I certainly do 1-1:7:t 
class myself as an export on vetereas 
legislation. I introduce this bill teclay 
because I have a deep concern for tli 
sacrifice we are asking of our young neer 
at a most critical time in their lives. 
We have, as my colleagnes well kn. , 
enacted broad programs for those vet-
erans who served in wartime. But I say 
o you that the wounds are just as de sp. 
he blood just as red, and the grave just

Republic, or in Vietnam, as it was on the 
battlefields of a formally declared World 
War II. 
All of us here know there will be some 
opposition to enactment of this program. 
There are those, both in and out of the 
administration, who will oppose it pri-
marily because of the cost. 
But I say to you?if this Congress and 
the American taxpayers can be asked to 
underwrite the massive cost of educating 
the ignorant of the world?then we have 
the duty to see to it first that those vet-
erans who gave so much to protect the 
world receive first consideration. 
Mr. Speaker, no man in Congress is 
more aware of the needs of our veterans 
than our distinguished friend, "TIGER" 
TEAGUE. He has earned the respect and 
admiration of. all Americans for his able 
and dedicated leadership, and under his 
guidance, our program of veterans' bene-
fits has become a model for the civilized 
world to follow. I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support the bill he has intro-
duced, and which I am proud to co-
author. It is my earnest hope that 
Chairman TEAGUE'S committee and this 
House will take swift action in passing 
this legislation. 
Wealth Can't Replace Freedom 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, the 
Palos Regional, an independent publica-
tion serving southwest suburban Cook 
County, Ill., has become known through-
out the Chicago area for its pertinent, 
thoughtful, and progressive editorial 
commentary. In the issue of January 27, 
it carried a most timely, philosophical 
commentary on the proper evaluation-of 
freedom. It properly places freedom as 
the most valuable heritage of our land: 
WEALTH CAN'T REPLACE FREEDOM 
We live, as every follower of the news media 
has been told on innumerable occasions, in 
an affluent society?perhaps the most ma-
terially affluent in history. Just about every-
thing has been going up and up, seemingly 
without pause or end?family income, in-
vestment and savings, the gross national 
product, the enormous sums devoted to in-
dustry expansion and betterment of facili-
ties, consumer spending and so on. This, 
the economists in form us, has been a pros-
perity unparalleled both in its extent and 
in the length of time it has continued with-
out a recession. 
The Nation has cause to take pride in all 
this. But it would be morally and practically 
wrong to look only at the myriad dollar signs 
and thoughtessly conclude that all is right, 
and there is little for the majority of Amer-
icans to worry about. 
In a far away nation that comparatively 
few of us could spot accurately on map, we 
are engaged in one of the cruelest wars in 
our experience. It is a war which has grown 
beyond all expectations and, unless every sign 
is wrong, is destined to grow to a much 
greater extent still. Soldiers of the United 
States are dying in tragically increasing 
numbers in that war. It is making heavy de-
mands on our wealth and our materials, and 
far larger demands are yet to come. How 
many of us here at home, during the past 
holiday season in which every sales record 
apparently was broken, gave more than pass-
ing thought to that war and the vast sacri-
fices it is demanding of the few? How many 
of us feel, and share as best we can, the re-
sponsibilities that those few are discharging 
for us all? How many of us realize that there 
is small affluence?save an affluence of weap-
ons?in Vietnam? 
And how many of us realize that, here at 
home, the odds are heavy that we shall have 
to abandon many an ambitious government 
program if we are to maintain this Nation as 
a bastion and arsenal of freedom in a world 
where tyrannies are on the march. 
The warning signs are up. The prospect of 
more tax reduction, held out a short time 
ago, has all but vanished. Informed talk 
now is of possible tax increases. The wel-
fare state plans, whatever one may think of 
their desirability, will, it seems certain, be 
cut back. At the highest levels of govern-
ment, new and urgent fears of more inflation 
have recently found a place--and there is 
more and more realization of the fact that 
protection of the dollar is absolutely essential 
to this Nation's strength and even survival. 
It is easy, in a time of general prosperity, 
for a people to avoid problems?to look away 
from clouds on the horizon. It is also fatal, 
as history has proven over and over again. 
The strength of the United States cannot be 
measured merely in material gains. These, 
in the long run, are the least of the story. 
That strength must be measured in moral 
and spiritual values that place freedom above 
all things, and a determination to protect 
our freedom whatever the costs. The mass 
man is destined for a well-deserved ob-
scurity. Respect for the individual, a knowl-
edge that no two of us are precisely alike, a 
profound belief in the worth and dignity of 
each of us?these were the principles on 
which this Nation was built. They must be 
sustained if this Nation is to endure. 
Let us enjoy our material advantages. But, 
above all, let us put them in. perspective?
and never forget that a life of freedom means 
infinitely more. 
Howard Davis (Jack) Todd: Distingushed 
Merchant, Civic Leader Retires 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. L. MENDEL RIVERS 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, an extremely capable and dis-
tinguished business executive turned the 
tables on his employees when he retired 
recently at Charleston, S.C. 
Instead of permitting his devoted em-
ployees to give him the traditional "sur-
prise party," Howard Davis (Jack) Todd, 
manager of Sears, Roebuck, honored a 
number of his longtime workers at a 
dinner. Perhaps this is an unusual twist 
in retirement ceremonies, but certainly 
it is typical of the devotion this esteemed 
merchant holds for his fellow man. Well 
known for his tireless efforts in behalf 
of his firm and community, Mr. Todd is 
an outstanding example of the kind of 
man our free enterprise system breeds. 
His interests and activities are exten-
sive?ranging from commercial to chari-
table and cultural projects. His career_ 
A477 
is an example after which our American 
youth could well pattern their lives. 
Under leave to extend my remarks in the 
Appendix of the RECORD, I hereby insert 
an editorial and news story from the 
News and Courier in tribute to a great 
American: 
From the Charleston (S.C.) News and 
Courier] 
FRIEND TO CHARLESTON 
An able and tireless merchant, Howard 
Davis Todd, during more than three decades 
of residence in Charleston, has found time 
and energy also for countless civic duties. 
He has shown interest in zoning, commercial, 
cultural, and charitable enterprises. His 
good humor has made him a popular as well 
as a respected citizen. In retiring Janu-
ary 31 after 32 years as manager of the Sears, 
Roebuck store here, Mr. Todd intends to 
keep his Charleston residence, though he 
will spend much of his time traveling, or en-
joying outdoor life at his country place on 
Edisto Island. 
The Sears business has grown tremen-
dously at Charleston under Mr. Todd's man-
agement. When the company decided to 
build a large new store, Mr. Todd insisted on 
locating it in the heart of town rather than 
moving, as the company frequently has done 
elsewhere, to the outskirts. Thus he indi-
vidually has been a notable contributor to 
the preservation of the business vitality of 
downtown Charleston. 
We have many reasons to like and admire 
Jack Todd, but this alone is a monument 
worthy of memory. The best part of it is

HON. EDWARD R. ROYBAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 19, 1966 
Mr. ROYBAL. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to take this opportunity to express my 
congratulations to President Johnson on 
his decision to refer the problem of Viet-
nam to the United Nations as a further

step in his effort to explore and exhaust 
every possibility of bringing peace to that 
war-torn area of the world. 
We Californians, in particular, sup-
port the President in this new peace in-
itiative, because for both historic and 
acne:rapine reasons we fully appreciate 
the President's desire that America play 
an important leadership role in pro/not-
-nig the cause of freedom and in building 
the foundations for peace among the na,-
Lions of the world. 
Located as we are on the eastern shore 
of the Pacific Ocean, arid with many of 
our citizens having close family, ethnic, 
language and cultural ties with the peo-
ple of other Pacific nations, we have al-
ways been an outward-looking society?
a true melting pot of the strength and 
diversity of backgrounds that have made 
Simerica great?with an immediate and 
personal interest in establishing good 
constructive relations with our neighbors 
in the Pacific community. 
For these reasons, we can only ap-
plaud the President's action in seeking 
the assistance of the world organization 
in attempting to find the way to a peace-
ful and honorable settlement of the con-
flict in Vietnam. 
Certainly every American endorses our 
Government's proposed resolution sub-
mitted to the United Nations Security 
Council calling for "immediate discus-
sions without preconditions * * * to 
arrange a conference looking toward the 
application of the Geneva Accords of 
1951 and 1962 and the establishment of 
a durable peace in southeast Asia." 
In addition, we can all support the U.S. 
resolution's recommendation that "the 
first order of business of such a confer-
ence be arraneements for a cessation of 
hostilities under effective supervision." 
Finally, we welcome the broad lan-
guage included in our resolution sug-
gesting that the U.N. offer "to assist in 
achieving the purpose of this resolution 
by all appropriate means, including the 
provision of aroitrators or mediators." 
Mr. Speaker. I am personally very 
proud and happy that President Johnson 
has taken these affirmative steps to en-
gage the best efforts of the international 
community of nations in our continued 
search for meaningful negotiations and a 
just settlement of the war in Vietnam. 
I have this deep personal interest and 
pride because 1 was one of several Mem-
bers of Congress who made similar sug-
gestions to the President some One ago?
and if ray en ?Its in this matter have 
had even a small part in influencing or 
reinforcing the President's determina-
tion to enlist the help of the United Na-
tions in calling a peace conference, in 
proposing unconditional discussions, in 
advocating an effective cease-fire, or in 
iiiiggesting, use of the techniques of arbi-
bre lion and mediation?then, Mr. Speak-
er, my elf arts have been amply rewarded 
elat I am extremely happy to have played. 
it eanstimetive role in trying to move the 
na,inelit; tititir in southeast Asia from

am confident that I share the hope 
Si We overwhelming majority of Ameri-
c:ilis that the 'United Nations act 
promptly to Lake advantage of this op-
portunity to advance the cause of world 
peace arid put an end to the war in 
Vietnam. 
If the U.N. should fail to assume its

UkrEinian Independence 
---
SPEECH 
OF 
HON. JAMES G. O'HARA 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HO'iTSE OF REPREENTATI 
Tuesday, January 25, 1966 
Mr. O'HABA of Michigan. Mr. Siealt-
er, for those of us who live secure in a 
Nation where the Government is of our 
own creation, governed by institutions 
which are bound by the motto: "Of the 
people, by the people and fcr the people," 
it is difficult to understand the national 
frustration of peoples obliged to live 
under the rule of a foreign power. 
Since the eule of Catherine the second 
la the 18th eentury, the Ukrainian peo-
ple have lived under foreign rule. Occa-
sionally their hopes have been rekiiidled 
by a relaxation of the grip or a military 
defeat suffered by their rulers, but in 
every instanee, the Ukrainians have been 
cast back under foreign control. 
The great hope of the Ukrainians came 
in 1917, when after two sudden n,volu-
tions, a new Russian Governmen t. as-
sumed the reins of power and proclaimed 
the rights of all the nationalities of 
Russia to self-determination. The 
Ukrainians ',sere one of the first to take 
advantage of the new policy and joy-
only proclaimed their independence. 
They were able to enjoy it just long 
enough to saijin a separate peace treaty 
with Germ:cay as Russia left World 
War I. 
Unfortunately, the Bolsheviks he d not 
been serious about the amonomy ef the 
nationalities. They saw it as a means of 
weakening toe unity of the imperial re-
gime. Once safely in control, the Com-
nranist. government of Russia de tamed 
down on the nationalities, includia.g the 
Ukraine.. 
To this day the Communist cantrol 
over the Uaraine continues. The: rule 
is imposed by the same aroup of men 
who claim themselves the champions 
ef national :iaciependence movemeits. It 
is a tragic irony indeed. Yet, in all of 
this, one light of hope continues to glow; 
it is the uhswerving national identity 
and dignity of the Ukrainian i:cople. 
Despite the harsh attempts at Commu-
nist assimilation, the national cha racter 
of the Ukrainian people stands 
triumphant.. 
Let us pause, Mr. Speaker, to tafie this 
moment to salute the proud people of 
the Ukraine. 
Washington Airport No Place for Jets 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. SAMUEL N. FRIEDEL 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. FRIEDEL. Mr. Speaker, I am 
very much concerned about the recent 
decision of the Federal Aviation Agency 
to permit jets to operate from Washing-
ton National Airport, particularly in 
view of the proposal to spend $150 million 
of the taxpayers' money to enable that 
airport to handle such planes. 
Many years ago when we were con-
sidering legislation to authorize the con-
struction of Dulles International Air-
port, I took the floor to warn my col-
leagues that the proposed airport could 
not be built for the $34 million the ad-
ministration was requesting. History 
proved that I was right because we have 
already spent more than $110 million 
on Dulles. But we were told then that 
this new airport was to handle jet traf-
fic and that Washington National Airport 
could never handle jets because it is 
already overcrowded and because of the 
noise factor. Now, the FAA has re-
versed its previous decision and has stated 
that with $150 million Washington Na-
tional can be made to handle jets. 
I am opposed to the use of Washing-
ton National by jets because I think it 
is unsafe and because of the noise and 
because I think it is a complete waste 
of the taxpayers' money to spend an-
other $150 million on airport facilities 
when we already have Dulles and 
Friendship International Airports to 
handle jet traffic. Neither of these fa-
cilities is operating at anything near 
capacity and these two airports can 
handle all the jet traffic for the Wash-
ington area for many, many years to 
come because they both have plenty of 
room for expansion. 
One of our great Baltimore news-
papers, the News American, recently ran 
a series of articles by Mr. Ray Abrams, 
Jr., calling attention to the recent growth 
of airports in the Washington area and 
recommend that all of my colleaeues 
give serious consideration to the prob-
lems outlined therein. The articles are 
as follows:

Today Laney and other Quincy Shipyard 
officials point with pride to the negotiated 
contract that followed the work slowdown. 
The Nation's first 4-year labor contract in 
the shipbuilding industry, it gave a 32-cent-
an-hour pay raise over that period, nine an-
nual paid holidays, 2-week vacation after 1 
year, and other benefits. 
"We probably did do some injustice to 
workers in the beginning, without a con-
tract," admits one General Dynamics official 
(not Laney) today. "But based on our own 
evaluation, it appeared a lot of the workers 
were overrated. If wage rates were too high 
at the start, we wouldn't have had a chance 
of being competitive or making the thing 
go." 
Quincy had hired many men back in lower 
classes and refused to take over all retirement 
programs for long-term Bethlehem em-
ployees. But under the new contract, the 
yard agreed to give seniority after 4 years 
shipbuilding experience and also agreed to 
review ratings on men with much more ex-
perience. 
Generally labor is pleased with the 9-
month-old contract. 
"We're satisfied with the outlook for the 
future, though we're not satisfied with every-
thing," says George McPherson, executive 
secretary of Local 5, Shipbuilders Union, 
which represents most of the workers in the 
yard. "Any grievances we have, we think can 
be bargained out." He explains labor is bar-
gaining with management on about 300 
grievances. 
"We think this will turn out to be a top 
yard. Things looked pretty grim after Beth-
lehem closed," he muses. 
The yard is busy, the company is still hir-
ing, and work has not yet begun on $141 
million worth of contracts the shipyard won 
in 1965. 
The contracts are for two ammunition 
ships, one submarine tender, and two fleet 
replenishment oilers. Ironically the ammu-
nitions ships' contract was won over Bethle-
hem Steel's Sparrows Point, Md., yard, al-
though a couple of weeks ago Quincy lost out 
to the same yard for two more of the ships. 
Last year Quincy workers also produced a 
harbor hurricane gate for Stamford, Conn., 
a missile launching trainer for the Navy's 
Polaris submarine crewmen, two new floating 
heavyweight shock platforms and also trans-
ferred midbodies from the T-2 tankers under 
conversion to two commercial tankers. 
With 1966 just a few weeks old, Quincy 
plans five key layings, two launchings and 
possibly two deliveries In the next 12 months. 
The plant also is going shopping for a share 
of the Navy's $1.9 billion shipbuilding pro-
gram for the remainder of the current fis-
cal year and will keep its eyes open for the 
fiscal 1967 list due to be announced at the 
end of this month. 
"We'll go after the big ones," says Laney. 
The Quincy yard also is setting its sights 
on an estimated $1.5 billion "total package" 
contract for a fleet of new, fast Navy cargo 
ships and already is developing proposals 
for the job. 
Whoever wins the contract likely could 
hold the reins on future building of sur-
face ships. The new concept gives one ship-
builder a single contract to design, construct 
and develop the new ships. 
"We're determined to get the contract, de-
spite keen competition," emphasizes the tall, 
slim yard manager. "It would make a big 
difference in the yard, give us a chance to 
plan ahead for several years. It would sta-
bilize the workload." 
Laney, a man accustomed to measuring 
success on a day-by-day basis, by no means 
thinks the Quincy yard has turned the corner 
toward success. 
General Dynamics has put $1 million into 
the operation; not a substantial sum in terms 
of multimillion-dollar industrial invest-
ments, but substantial enough to show the 
parent company's interest in its young 
branch. 
The single most important factor in 
Quincy's upward swing thus far, believes 
Laney, is the transfer from Groton of a 
bright, young, aggressive and fresh approach. 
"There is a belief in the future of the 
yard. Many employees are working in the 
same spot they were 2 years ago, but they 
are producing more." 
Yet, he cautions: "Our 6,700 employees is 
better than 2 years ago when there weren't 
any, but that doesn't spell success. Re-
member, we haven't completed our first ship 
yet." 
Quincy, however, has quite a few good 
things going for it. 
One of these, in Laney's view, is the 4-year 
labor contract which gives the company a 
firm springboard in seeking major contracts. 
Serious labor problems and large labor de-
mands were reasons, and maybe the primary 
ones, for the downfall of the Bethlehem 
yard. 
Another reason for the upswing might be 
found in the two words "Cost Reduction." 
Continually General Dynamics surveys the 
yard, checking out and eliminating waste in 
electricity, telephones, steam heat, and other 
areas. Last year 116 million gallons of water 
(enough for 900 families) was conserved as 
a result of such a survey. 
Laney himself daily walks through a por-
tion of the yard to see the operation first-
hand. Another top executive inspects the 
entire yard from 5 to 7 a.m, each day. 
"If we're going to be successful in com-
petitive bidding, we've got to cut all the fat 
out of the operation," says Laney, a former 
Navy captain, who has spent most of his life 
in shipbuilding. 
Still another reason for the positive out-
look at Quincy is its interdependent relation-
ship with its sister shipyard in Groton. 
Quincy got its first boost in talent and 
equipment from that yard and may draw on 
that yard whenever needed. "Each yard has 
a dominant interest, but each is capable of 
working in the other field," says Laney. 
"One of the most interesting things in the 
development of the Quincy operation has 
been the mixture of the shipbuilding and 
submarinebuilding people. The difference in 
building each is like the difference between 
building an airplane and a submarine." 
Half of the current workload at Quincy is 
in submarine construction. The Whale and 
the Sunfish are expected to be launched this 
year, and the Greenling and the Gato are 
being outfitted with equipment. 
Little if any additional submarine con-
struction is planned at Quincy, though there 
may be additional submarine repair work. 
Quincy will concentrate as originally in-
tended, on surface ships. 
Already the Vanguard, the first of the three 
Apollo instrumentation ships, is scheduled 
for sea trials later this month. The Red-
stone is being outfitted with electronic and 
marine equipment and preliminary hull work 
is underway on the Mercury. 
And there are the contracts for those five 
other surface ships. 
Yet the Quincy shipyard is operating at 
only one-third capacity, and that's the way 
the company wants it. 
Laney expects the current work force of 
6,700 to remain steady for the next year at 
least. He conservatively predicts a high of 
8,000 employees for the yard. But, he hastily 
adds, "It all depends on contracts. 
"We won't be able to tell which way the 
yard is going for at least another 2 or 3 years. 
While contract price remains frozen and 
fixed, other things can change during the 
contract life. Dangers are escalation of 
costs, bad weather and loss of employees." 
The manpower situation, in fact, con-
stantly plagues the yard, It faces a critical 
shortage of experienced shipfltters, electri-
cians and outside machinists and is con-
stantly advertising these positions. To curb 
the crisis somewhat, it is training 105 young 
men in 10 different trades in its own appren-
tice program and retraining another 50 un-
der the U.S. Manpower Development and 
Training Act. 
"Only the best shipbuilders can be suc-
cessful," say Laney. "Profits are sparse. 
We're caught in an economic squeeze. Since 
World War II, 20 private shipyards have 
folded and most today are operating at half 
capacity. 
"Quincy will have to get a number of 
major new contracts if it's going to turn 
that corner toward success. But we're deter-
mined to get those contracts." 
Management, labor and certainly the 
South Shore and even Greater Boston com-
munities are in agreement on that philos-
ophy. 
The rebirth of the shipyard has shown up 
dramatically on the South Shore area where 
75 percent of its $40 million payroll is dis-
tributed. 
The Quincy Chamber of Commerce re-
ports an increase in apartment house con-
struction, hotel and motel business and re-
tail business. The Quincy Shipyard shares 
in that impact with other growing industries 
in the area. 
Not bad for a 2-year-old toddler. 
LI\N-1 A Marine's Views 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOHN V. TUNNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. TUNNEY. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to place in the RECORD a letter from 
Cpl. Lawrence Torrez, of California, 
now stationed in Vietnam. 
Corporal Torrez is the brother of Mrs. 
Ray Inda. Mr. Ray Inda is the presi-
dent of the 0.1. Forum, which is a great 
public service organization. 
Two months ago, I traveled to Vietnam 
and met with over 400 U.S. servicemen 
there. The morale of our troops in Viet-
nam was excellent. I was never prouder 
to be an American than to hear the 
troops with whom I spoke declare to a 
man that we must not leave the people of 
South Vietnam to Communist domina-
tion. 
I believe that the letter from Corporal 
Torrez sums up very well the feelings ex-
pressed to me by most of the soldiers 
I spoke with. They were all very con-
cerned about demonstrations here in the 
United States and many asked if there 
was not something which could be done 
about them. I believe Corporal Torrez 
expresses in his letter that a majority 
of the people of the United States sup-
port our efforts to allow the people of 
South Vietnam to determine their own 
destiny. 
Corporal Torrez is obviously a young 
man of intelligence and dedication who 
represents the best in the idealism of 
American youth.

iVIr. 1.1URIC..E. Mr. Flir-tIti-ey, thy United 
states presently stands in 12th place 
111 
among the shipbuilding nations of the 
world. The Soviet Union is building new 
merchant ships at a rate 14 times greater 
than ours and both Japan and Germany 
are far ahead of the United States in 
ship construction and registry. 
As a result of long years of neglect, 
our merchant mar no carries only 9 per-
cent of our foreign trade. We do have 
a mothball fleet, and in the past 5 
years have had to refit, at heavy cost, 
more than 50 ships. These refitted yes-
are not the modern ships that we 
should have. MOrP ships from. this 
mothball fleet are being refitted, and 
still there has been no positive decision 
on a well-planned illipbuilding program 
in American shipyards. In lieu of this, 
our Departments cf Defense and Inte-
rior have sounded out the possibEities of 
building ships in Britain and even. in 
Poland. A decisior of this nature could 
ruin an industry vital to national de-
fense and economic prosperity. 
In my 11th Congressional District in 
Massachusetts, there is the Quincy Ship-
yard, 83 years in existence and bought 
by the General Dynamics Corp. from the 
Bethlehem Steel Co. in 1963. Here is 
one company in .the United States that 
had foresight in the needs of American 
shipbuilding and wos willing to gamble 
in this purchase, that the United States 
would see fit to expand the American 
merchant marine in all categories and 
in 2 years has put itself in a post ion to 
assist in this neederi expansion. I take 
this opportunity to include an article on 
the rebirth of the Quincy Shipyard from 
the January 14, 1966, edition of the Bos-
ton Sunday Herald:

How could General Dynamics expect to 
establish a new operation at the same old 
stand and make it work? 
With a will to win, answered Quincy Ship-
yard Manager Robert V. Laney, the other 
day. "It was the beginning of a new yard 
with different purposes and motives and a 
different spirit." 
Laney managed the Bethlehem yard in its 
final years, heading projects which produced 
the Bainbridge and the Long Beach. He well 
remembers the despair and discouragement 
which settled on the men as production 
petcred out. 
General Dynamics already was successfully 
building, the bulk of the Nation's Polaris 
eubmarine fleet in its Electric Boat Division 
in Groton, Conn. It foresaw a promising and 
profitable future in the surface ship field, 
and decided to distribute its eggs into two 
baskets in a dual operation. 
/t act out immediately on its new task, 
alerting from scratch. It had bought only 
the physical plant: 175 acres and 89 build-
ings, 4 outfitting piers, a 10,000-ton float-
ing drydock and 3 building basins. 
First, General Dynamics closed the ship-
yard, severing all ties with the former parent. 
Then it gave it a new name?the Quir.dY 
Shipyard. 
Forty keymen were brought up from Gro-
ton to assess the yard and start it moving 
Laney still vividly recalls the hollow beat 
of the footsteps of these men and some 50 
maintenance and security men on macadam 
and concrete as they walked through the 
deserted yard during its 6-week shutdown 
and reorganizational period. 
Hiring for the new shipyard began in late 
January 1964. Some 4,000 persons showed 
up at the State employment office in Quincy 
that first day, the long line stretching down 
Parkway. 
By mid-February, the first 200 new eel-
ployees walked through the gate on East 
:toward Street and the yard began to conic 
;dive again. 
First order of business was cleaning and 
'i- habilitating machinery and tools which. 
had been idle for weeks and even years, and 
redecorating the premises. 
Some small production work was done on 
rsid jobs around the yard, but it wasn't Un-
'it April when some 500 employees were on 
,.h.e payroll that production really got un-
derway. 
Quincy Shipyard had inherited from Beth.-
'ehem a $61.9 million contract to build two 
Litelear attack submarines, the Whale and 
Lhe Sunfish. The keel for the Whale was 
id May 27, 1964. In addition, two nuclear 
ettack subs, the Greenling and the Gate, 
were towed up from the Groton facility into 
I he Quincy building basins for lengthening. 
The men in the yard began to feel the 
i?hipyard stir. 
Pour months later, in September. General 
liynamics won a $65 million NASA contract 
convert three world War II Navy re; 
!I lleers into floating electronic islands for 
; racking the Nation's astronauts on their 
:ek to the moon. The bulk of the award 
tr the Vanguard, the Redstone, and the Mer-
any went to the Quincy yard for hull struc-
eal work. Electronics and instrumentation 
;f 
being handled by two other G.D. 
lIM  
The future began to look brighter for 
Guincy, but there were problems, too. 
At is first birthday, in January 1965, 
0.200 persons were on the yard's payroll. Hall' 
the men in the yard were former Bethle-
I ran employees. 
Since General Dynamics bought only the 
peysical plant, the men began work without; 
leelefit of a labor contract. From the start 
they were disgruntled over pay and senior-
i ay. 
The discontent erupted during contract, 
negotiations and 3,000 production and cleri-
c:a workers walked off their jobs one day to 
:etest lack of progress in negotiations.

about the war in Vietnam. I would like to 
let you know our personal opinions and what 
we think of it. 
It seems that our real enemies are back 
home?not here in Vietnam. I have read 
about communism and have seen what it does 
just by looking at these people here in Viet-
nam, plus the fact there are people trying 
desperately to leave Communist worlds like 
East Germany, Cuba, Red China, and so many 
more. 
Do these college students feel they know 
more than these people who have actually 
experienced the ways of communism? 
We heard of the welcoming our marines 
have been receiving as they arrive in the 
United States from Vietnam. They (welcom-
ing group) called our marines murderers and 
a lot of other dirty names, not getting any 
gratitude for what they had been through. 
I'd like to see every one of those punks 
drafted, but I'd hate to see them be in the 
U.S. Marine Corps. But if they ever did come 
into this outfit, I guarantee you this, the 
Marine Corps would square them away?and 
mighty fast. 
I'm glad the real "citizens" of the United 
States are on our side, and are giving us 
their support in stopping communism from 
spreading. 
This letter is not intended to criticize all 
the people of the United States?not by a 
long shot. Only those few who have the 
shoes that fit. 
Mr. Truman's Gloom 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
or 
HON. THADDEUS J. DULSKI 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. DULSKI. Mr. Speaker, the recent 
comments made by our former President 
on the state of the world are sad but true. 
Under leave to extend my remarks, I 
wish to include a fine editorial which ap-
peared in the Evening Star, Washington, 
D.C., on January 27: 
M. TRUMAN'S GLOOM 
Out in his hometown of Independence, 
Harry Truman the other day made some very 
poignant remarks about the state of the 
world as it has become since his own active 
efforts ceased. 
Surveying things as they are and compar-
ing them with things as they were in his ad-
ministration, the former President said sadly, 
"It all seems to have been in vain. Memories 
are short and appetites for power and glory 
are insatiable. Old tyrants depart. New ones 
take their places. Old differences are com-
posed. New differences arise. Old allies be-
come the foe. The recent enemy becomes the 
friend. It's all very baffling and trying." 
It is very baffling and trying. Almost every 
sentence in Mr. Truman's elegy is an accurate 
statement of events In the world during and 
since his administration. Except one: the 
first. It has not been in vain. 
Americans generally fought through World 
War II with an expectation of permanent 
peace to follow victory. It was a great 
wrench to see Soviet Russia, our ally, arise as 
a new threat to peace. Mr. Truman boldly 
and decisively met that threat in Greece, in 
Persia, and elsewhere. He met it, too, by 
the economic aid which restored Europe to 
health and made communism an ideological 
curiosity in the West rather than a possible 
alternative. 
And then, yet another tyrant and new 
difference arose in the East. Again, in Korea, 
Mr. Truman met this new threat with deter-
mined resistance. He established a line and 
the line has held. 
The international relations of the United 
States in the years since World War II have 
been infinitely complicated and give promise 
only of further complexity. But peace of 
a sort has been preserved. The line has been 
held. 
The nature of life itself is to have one new 
peril swifty replace an old one contained. 
Mr. Truman did what had to be done, and 
deserves freedom from sad second thoughts 
in his twlight years. 
Dr. William B. Edwards 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. WILLIAM E. MINSHALL 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. MINSHALL. Mr. Speaker, Lake-
wood, Ohio, which I represent, was 
shocked and saddened Monday by the 
unexpected, untimely death of Dr. Wil-
liam B. Edwards, nationally known edu-
cator and the superintendent of our 
Lakewood school system since 1955. 
Lakewood's young people are the finest 
memorial Dr. Edwards could have to his 
Intense concern for quality education. 
His standards were the highest and the 
city's schools reflect those standards in 
outstanding curriculum and student 
scholarship. In all his striving for aca-
demic excellence, he never lost the hu-
man touch which endeared him to those 
who knew him. 
Dr. Edwards was unsparing of himself 
in his community interests. He was a 
member of the Lakewood Chamber of 
Commerce and Rotary Club, past presi-
dent of the South Euclid Kiwanis Club, 
president of the executive council of the 
Greater Cleveland Chapter of the Boy 
Scouts and a member of the American 
Association of School Administrators, 
National Education Association, and the 
Horace Mann League. 
The Cleveland Press and Plain Dealer 
have paid high editorial tribute to Dr.. 
Edwards' achievements in the decade he 
served the Greater Cleveland area. 
The editorials follow: 
[From the Cleveland (Ohio) Press, 
Jan. 31, 1966] 
WILLIAM B. EDWARDS 
The death this morning of William B. 
Edwards, Lakewood's superintendent of 
schools, removes from the scene one of this 
area's ablest, hardest working, and most dis-
tinguished educators. 
Edwards, 56, took over the Lakewood job 
in 1955. At that time Omar Ranney, late 
press staffer who was on the Lakewood School 
A461 
Board, said: "We feel we have obtained one 
of the Nation's top school administrators." 
Today Ranney's son Phil, who is himself 
on the school board, said of Edwards: "What 
made him such an excellent superintendent 
was the fact that he didn't get bogged down 
in details to the extent that he forgot that 
the main thing he was dealing in was boys 
and girls." 
Edwards came to Lakewood after heading 
the school systems in South Euclid-Lynd-
hurst and later in Peoria, Ill. He was known 
for his leadership In civic affairs on a county-
wide basis and vigorously fought for school 
levies against often-determined opposition. 
Edwards was gregarious, articulate, and 
likeable. His enthusiasm for his work and 
his keen concern that boys and girls get the 
best education possible made him a truly 
outstanding educator. 
His concern for education took many forms. 
He was quick to offer Lakewood's facilities for 
Ohio branch colleges in 1951. And just re-
cently he instituted a course of Afro-Asian 
studies in the suburb's schools because he 
thought youngsters need to know about cul-
tures other than those of the Western World. 
There are not many William B. Edwardses. 
He will be sorely missed. 
[From the Cleveland (Ohio) Plain Dealer, 
Feb. 1, 19661 
D. WILLIAM B. EDWARDS 
Dr. William B. Edwards was a creative and 
deeply devoted superintendent of Lakewood 
schools for more than 10 years. His sudden 
death at 56 is a severe blow to Lakewood 
and to the entire metropolitan community. 
All Greater Cleveland is indebted to Dr. 
Edwards for the enthusiasm and diligence he 
brought to his work with the Boy Scouts, the 
Young Men's Christian Association, the Com-
munity Chest and such important cultural 
activities as the Great Lakes Shakespeare 
Festival, which he served for a time as presi-
dent. 
The Lakewood school system will miss him 
not only for his fine qualities as a man but 
for the spirit of useful innovation and the 
emphasis on excellence that marked his 
decade in the superintendent's chair. 
Dr. Edwards knew that no school system 
could be better than its teachers. He there-
fore gave great attention to in-service train-
ing. And he devised and won school board 
approval for a plan that gave Career teachers 
summer pay every fifth year for university 
study. 
Lakewood schools were among the first in 
the area to offer foreign languages in the fifth 
grade of elementary school. They were 
among the first to pursue "modern math." 
Lakewood High School was the first in the 
State to require driver training of all its 
students and this too was a step inspired by 
Dr. Edwards. 
Dr. Edwards' life was one of immense use-
fulness in a field he loved. The community 
will miss him.

Pure and Simple Juggling in Budget 
Preparation 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. RALPH HARVEY 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. HARVEY of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, under unanimous consent, I wish to 
insert the following article from the Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., News of January 25, 
1966: 
PURE AND SIMPLE JUGGLING IS THE PRIMARY 
TALENT IN BUDGET PREPARATION 
(By Jack W. Gore) 
In attempting to analyze President John-
son's new budget, there are several points 
which must be kept well in mind before any 
firm conclusions can be drawn. 
To begin with, it must be recognized that 
Federal budgetmaking can hardly be termed 
an exact science. At best, even the most 
conscientious budgetmakers can only come 
up with educated guesses in regard to Gov-
ernment income and expenditures, as they 
can no more foretell the course of future 
events than anybody else. 
It should also be remembered that the 
budget presented to Congress by the Presi-
dent yesterday covers a fiscal year that 
doesn't start until next July 1 and doesn't 
end until June 30 of 1967. Thus, any num-
ber of things can happen over the next 18 
months to alter just about everything in 
this massive estimate of Government revenue 
and Government spending. 
Another point to remember is that figures 
can be juggled around to prove most any-
thing any President or his advisers want to 
prove. Revenues can be overestimated and 
expenses underestimated in such a fashion 
as to make it appear the Government is only 
going to operate on a minor deficit level 
when just the opposite situation is almost 
certain to prove true. 
To emphasize this fact it is only necessary 
to note that President Johnson asked the 
Congress just a few days ago for some $12 
billion more than had originally been re-
quested in his current budget to meet the 
soaring costs of the war in Vietnam. Much 
of this extra money will not be used during 
the current budget year, but by requesting 
the funds now Mr. Johnson has been able to 
reduce next year's military budget suffi-
ciently to brag about the small deficit his 
new budget predicts. 
This is bookkeeping juggling pure and 
simple, yet by resorting to this sort of thing 
Mr. Johnson hopes to persuade the Congress 
that this Nation can well afford not only to 
fight a very costly war but also to greatly in-
crease the amount of money he wishes to 
pour into the expansion of his Great Society 
program. 
The President is also hoping to achieve an-
other objective through his figure juggling 
techniques. The prospect of just a small 
budget deficit in the upcoming fiscal year is 
nowhere near as frightening from an infla-
tionary standpoint as a great big deficit 
would be. 
And since the President has declared war 
on inflation, he hardly wants to put himself 
in a position of advocating such a tremen-
dous budget deficit next year as to give pow-
erful impetus to the inflationary cycle that 
has already started. 
In this respect it must be noted that Mr. 
Johnson has carefully prepared an escape 
hatch for himself should his present esti-
mates of spending an revenue prove to be 
highly unrealistic. He has stated that 
should higher expenditures become neces-
sary to carry on the war in Vietnam, or should 
a strong inflationary trend develop, he will 
not hesitate to ask Congress for additional 
money or to seek higher taxes. 
Thus, the President hasn't put himself so 
far out on a limb with his new budget he 
can't crawl back to safety should it start to 
snap. If the figure juggling he has done 
backfires on him later in the year, he can 
then ask for more money and higher taxes 
and still say it is in line with what he said 
he would do when he presented the budget 
to Congress. 
In the meantime he can claim credit for 
coming up with an almost balanced budget 
without sacrificing either guns or butter. The 
fact that this accomplishment was made pos-
sible through such sleight-of-hand practices 
as speeding up tax payments to provide the 
Government with an additional $4.5 billion 
in revenue without actually raising taxes will 
largely be overlooked for the present as most 
people tend to look at results instead of how 
such results are to be accomplished. 
President Johnson has never been one to 
give the American people bad news in one big 
jolt. He likes to parcel it out a little at a 
time in the manner he has done in regard 
to the Vietnam conflict. Last summer, it will 
be recalled, he permitted all kinds of stories 
to circulate about how he was preparing to 
declare a national emergency, call up the re-
serves, and greatly increase the draft call in 
order to meet our added commitments to 
Vietnam. Thus, when he took to the air-
waves to announce that a troop buildup had 
become necessary but that it wouldn't yet 
require the declaration of a national emer-
gency, calling up the reserves, or greatly in-
creasing the draft call, the collective sighs of 
relief from our people just about obliterated 
the full significance of what the announced 
troop buildup would eventually demand in 
the way of extra money, extra manpower, and 
added risk. 
Now the President is using the same soft-
sell techniques with his new budget. By 
juggling figures, postponing tax cuts and 
creating the impression we can fight a war 
and still pour more money into the Great 
Society, he glosses over the bad news in his 
budget which is reflected in the fact that 
even the President cannot say he won't have 
to come back later and ask for new taxes to 
cover the profligate spending he has asked 
the Congress to approve. 
South ietnam and Social Reform 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JACOB H. GILBERT 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. GILBERT. Mr. Speaker, I fear 
that in our preoccupation with the mili-
' A473 
tary aspects of the war in Vietnam, we 
have forgotten that we are dealing with 
what is essentially a revolutionary situ-
ation. The New York Post, in a percep-
tive editorial based on the experiences 
of one of its writers in the field, reminds 
us of the deep discontent that has made 
the Vietnamese people vulnerable to the 
penetration of the Vietcong. I commend 
this editorial to my colleagues and ask 
unanimous consent for permission to in-
sert it into the RECORD. 
[From the New York Post, Jan. 28, 1966] 
FROM OTJR MAN IN SAIGON 
Post Columnist Pete Hamill's dispatches 
from Vietnam have given us all a more con-
crete and human understanding of somber 
Vietnamese realities. 
His report yesterday brought into sharp 
focus the underlying frustration of the U.S. 
effort in Vietnam. Hamill's account of the 
Vietcong doctor who defected to the south 
only to discover that General Ky's officialdom 
will not permit him to practice medicine in 
an area starved for medical services led 
Hamill to a grim conclusion about South 
Vietnam's bureaucracy. It is a dreary lot 
and "we find ourselves as a nation defending 
the status quo in a situation that begs for 
revolution." 
Hamill added: "In a country that is 90 
percent agricultural, where 45 percent of the 
land is owned by 2 percent of the people, 
neither we nor our allies will ever whisper 
the words 'agrarian reform.'" Why? 
U.S. spokesmen speak of "aggression from 
the north." Certainly Hanoi has fueled and 
fanned the flames of discontent in the south. 
But they may become a raging bonfire be-
cause of the inability or unwillingness of 
the privileged thin crust ruling Saigon to 
accept the view that governments exist for 
the benefit of their people. And this may 
be the heart of the problem we confront?
larger than any debate over strategic military 
moves. 
Federal Tax Plan Would Erode State 
Powers 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ROBERT L. F. SIKES 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 19, 1966 
Mr. SIXES. Mr. Speaker, I submit 
for reprinting in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD, an editorial from the Florida 
Times-Union, on the subject of proposed 
uniform tax systems set forth in H.R. 
11798, entitled "Federal Tax Plans Will 
'Erode State Powers." The editorial 
gives a clear, but disturbing picture of 
the effect of the proposed legislation in 
Florida and elsewhere. In this connec-
tion, attention is called to the fact that 
Florida State Comptroller Fred 0. Dick-
inson, Jr., appeared Wednesday, Febru-
ary 2, before a House Judiciary Subcom-
mittee in opposition to the measure. 
The editorial follows: 
FEDERAL TAX PLAN WOULD ERODE STATE 
POWERS 
The appearance of Florida's two top offi-
cials in the field of finance and taxation 
as protesting witnesses as congressional 
hearings tomorrow on a proposed uniform 
taxation system bears testimony to the justi-
fiable concern with which Florida authori-
ties view the scheme.

State Comptroller Fred 0. Dickinson, Jr., 
will appear as spokesman for the State gov-
ernment, and will be accompanied in his 
presentation by State Revenue Commission 
Director J. Ed Straughn. 
the bill purports to eliminate multiple 
taxation on businesses operating in several 
States by setting up a system requiring such 
farms to tile a single report with the Federal 
Government, an the basis of which States 
concerned would collect taxes due. 
In attempting to relieve a relatively small 
problem, however, the proposal would im-
pose new and far more restrictive limitations 
on The taxing pover of the States beyond 
those now accepted by the courts. It would 
make mandatory sweeping changes in State 
tax policies and practices, which officials esti-
mate would cost Florida taxpayers about $72 
million a year. Finally, the bill is viewed 
with alexin by btate officials as a further in-
trusion of Federal power into State affairs 
winch would lead to the ultimate destruc-
tion of State fineal sovereignty through urn-
position of Federal controls. 
Wider the bbl, for example, States would 
he prohibited from imposing income taxes, 
capital stock taxes, and gross receipt taxes 
on out-of-State businesses operating within 
their borders unless their legislatures 
adopted the uniform tax system set up under 
it. 
kovernor Burns and the full cabinet have 
formally gone on record in opposition to 
the proposal, as has the interim State tax 
study commission headed by Senator B. C. 
Pearce, of Palatka. 
The proposal is another notable example, 
of using some ostensibly desirable reform. 
as an appealing front to accomplish a pur-
pose winch the public would never willingly 
accept if advanced forthrightly. 
If the present system for collecting State 
raises on out-of-State businesses imposes un-
due hardships on such businesses, it should. 
be relatively simple to provide relief without; 
wrecking the system and imposing shackles 
on the States in the process. The provisions 
oli the bill which extend beyond that stated 
purpose, however, support the strong suspi-
cion that its real purpose is not to eliminate 
inconvenience so a limited number of busi-
nOSSeS, but to drive another deep wedge to 
separate the States from the administration. 
of their own affairs. 
Message of Confidence 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
1, 
HON. BOB CASEY 
I' '11.550 
JN TIDE HOt thE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday. February 2. 1966 
Mr, CASEY. Mr. Speaker, the entire 
country was reassured when its President 
expressed his view that this Nation and 
its people are st,iing enough to meet our 
commitments abroad and face up to our 
obligations at home at the same time. 
To his state of the Union speech, Presi-
dent Johnson made an expression of con-
fidence of the ability of this Nation. 
The President said, quite simply: 
believe we can continue the Great So-
ciety while we tight in Vietnam. 
:The SAW() 01 his domestic proposals 
was startling-, the Houston Chronicle 
stated editorially. 
The cditorial, one of many in praise of 
the state of the Union message, will be of 
interest to my colleagues, and I offer it 
for the RECORD. 
THE STATE OF THE UNION 
President Johnson was eloquent :M. his 
state of the Union address last night although 
he offered the Nation no surprises in IT; as-
sessment of the war in Vietnam. OA the 
domestic front, however, the sweep of his 
proposals was startling. He tias askee Con-
gress for enough new legislal ion to keep its 
second session almost as busy as wes the 
frantic first session. Those 'who exp.:steel a 
letup in the Great Society were put St aught 
ibmost from the moment the .President aegan 
to speak. 
This -was Mr johrson's first full-sc. l ; tele-
vision address since early Oetober. he ap-
peared healthy and physically up ea the 
I)3casion. His face seems d. meire deep]: lined 
than usual perhaps. His demeanor yea; en-
thusiastic when he spoke of his chonestic 
program; seiber end measured when he spoke 
of Vietnam. 
The Nation, perhaps, had hoped Mr .tohn-
son could reveal some dramatic new de velop-
ment in the Vietnam conflict. In that sense, 
his words were disappointing, for ....Marty 
nothing new has occurred since the Origin-
ning of his peace offensive to slustife high 
hopes for a negotiated settlement. 1,1stead, 
tem President reiterated the now femiliar 
'C'S. at as soon as possiblii, but 
peace only after aggression is halted. 
"Let me be :absolutely clear," he add in 
one of his most dramatic passages. "The 
days may become months, and the months 
may become years, but we will stay as long as 
aggression commands us to battle." 
Mr. Johnson clearly has rejected the guns-
or-butter choice which many have said has 
been forced on the country. 
"We will not permit those who fire on us 
in Vietnam to win a victory over the desires 
and intentions; of the American people. This 
Nation is mighty enough?its society bealthy 
enough?its people strong enough?to pursue 
cur goals in the rest of the world while build-
ing a Great Society at home." 
Few had expected the President U.; be so 
ambitious in his request of Congress. In the 
hold ol: civil rights, he was especially bold. 
fie asked legislation to end discrimination 
in jury selection?a highly controversial 
issue; new laws to punish in Federal courts 
those who murder, attack,, or intirnida: civil 
rights workers; new legislati:;in to bar racial 
eliscrimination in the sale or rental oi hous-
ing. There will be a battle, Curdle, over 
hese measures. 
He asked, also, for a new Cabinet-le eel De-
pertinent of Transportation; for 4-yea s terms 
or Members of the House of itepreseni "'Lives; 
for development of a supersonic to 
airplan.e to ily three times the speed of 
sound; for new measures to tteal with iitrikes 
winch threaten the national interesieethis, 
incidentally, to considerable applaure from 
Congress; for a new attack on river and 
it pollution; for Federal highwai, safety 
legislation; and on and on. 
Jul the foreign field, the President eitiks a 
much needed "new and daring direct au" to 
the foreign aid program and also an :ixpan-
elan ol trade between this 'Nation ane East-
ern E?tirope slid the Soviet Unio,;. The 
former will he welcomed, no doubt, Mit the 
latter will make the sparks lily. 
And so will Mr. Joh:neon:it proposal to in-
erease taxes on telephone service tied new

would help finance the risine cost of tie: war,

DIAL he intends to hold the deficit Di a slim

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ABRAHAM J. MULTER 
or NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, Presi-
dent Johnson has made the only possible 
choice in resuming the bombing of North 
Vietnam. The United States pursued 
every honorable means during the bomb-
ing lull in an effort to secure a cease-tire 
and the negotiation of a peaceful settle-
ment. 
We were answered with denunciations 
instead of negotiations. 
As pointed out in the following edi-
torial from the New York Herald Tribune 
of February 1? 1966, President Johnson 
has coupled the resumption of bombing 
raids with a further effort toward peace. 
I know his efforts will continue. 
I commend the Tribune editorial to the 
attention of our colleagues: 
BOMBS AND RESOLUTIONS 
In announcing the resumption of bomb-
ing attacks on North Vietnam, President 
Johnson made it plain that this was the re-
sult of the considered judgment of the re-
sponsible military and political agencies oh 
the American government. And that Judg-
ment can only be seriously contested on. 
the assumption that the United Stales has 
no business in Vietnam at all. 
For the bombing pause failed to produce 
any hint from Hanoi that it was willing -to 
sit down :it the conference table. It not only 
continued to insist on acceptance of its; orig-
inal four points (which would mean total. 
victory for the Vietcong) but has added, as 
the British Foreign Office terms it, "a new 
and even more unacceptable prior condi-
tion"?recognition of the Vietcong as. "the 
sole genuine representative of the people of 
South Vietnam." 
Since Ho Chi Minh insists on war or stir-
render, he must have war. No American can 
feel happy at being presented with this 
choice. But since it has been made so 
abundantly clear by the rejection of Presi-
dent Johnson's peace overtures, few Ameri-
cans would want to endanger the lives of 
their men in Vietnam by a continued with-
holding of the means to strike at North 
Vietnamese supply routes, or allow lio to 
work his wicked will from sanctuary. 
At the same time, the United States is 
fighting this war to end it, and the Presicienv 
has given renewed evidence of American de-
termination in this respect by taking the 
case formally to the United Nations. 
'This has not been done before for several 
reasons. In the first place, the only inter-
national body which had been seized oi 
Vietnamese dispute was the Geneva cooler - 
emcee of 1954. That body could be etealled 
to discuss the problem; the British Govern - 
ment, as one co-chairman, has been teeing 
to do so. The Soviet 'Union, the oilier - 
chairman. has refused. 
There ik also the fact kil:a neither North 
Vietnam nor Red China, the power priatIliog 
Ho Chi Minh toward continued war, is a 
member of the U.N., and both have repelitecliv 
and explicitly denied that the U.N. has tin', 
role to play in their atfaire. 
The American resolution, howeveis does 
not set forth specific terms for a settlemeo 
or even outline, fixed steps toward a :iiettle-
ment which would almost certainly have 
brought immediate rejection by :Hanoi. 
Rather, the American proposal would place 
the Security Council officially in hack of .1

According to an editorial which ap-
peared in yesterday's Wall Street Jour-
nal, Secretary Freeman is wrestling with 
the problem of a huge surplus of bu-
reaucratic paper created by his own De-
partment. It consists of 155,000 filing 
cabinets, valued at more than $7 million 
and occupying about 18 acres of floor 
space. They contain "almost a million 
cubic feet of paper records" and, to say 
the least, "that is a lot of paper." 
We do not know just how Secretary 
Freeman proposes to reduce this paper 
surplus. We are constrained to express 
the hope that it will not be done in some 
highly involved bureaucratic manner, 
that so typifies the Agriculture Depart-
ment's operations, necessitating an in-
crease in the number of employees. 
There is already a surplus of em-
ployees with the Agriculture Depart-
ment. They presently have 1 employee 
for every 32 farmers, whereas in 1933 
there was 1 for every 203 farmers. I 
suppose we will now have a new division 
created in the Agriculture Department 
to dispose of the surplus paper records 
created by a surplus of employees. 
Under leave to extend my remarks I 
am inserting the Wall Street Journal 
editorial: 
EIGHTEEN ACRES OF PAPER 
Announcing plans for what he calls a 
"cleansweep" campaign, Agriculture Secre-
? tary Freeman has disclosed that the farmers 
are not the only people who can produce 
surpluses. It seems the Agriculture Depart-
ment has been creating a rather remarkable 
surplus of its own. 
The targets of "cleansweep," says Mr. Free-
man, are 155,000 Agriculture Department fil-
ing cabinets. The cabinets themselves are 
valued at more than $7 million. They occupy 
'778,000 square feet of floor space, which is 
equal to about 18 acres. And they contain 
almost a million cubic feet of paper records. 
That is a lot of paper, and evidently a good 
bit of it is excess, for the object of the cam-
paign is to eliminate 20 percent of the total. 
We don't know exactly how the Depart-
ment proposes to go about getting rid of its 
glut, but it's interesting to speculate that the 
agency might apply procedures it uses else-
where. It might, for example, assign each 
of its many divisions a paper-acreage allot-
ment and penalize those that exceed it. Or 
the Department might try direct payments to 
division chiefs who hold down their paper 
generation. 
Perhaps such schemes might succeed. But 
given the usual bureaucratic ingenuity in 
paper production, they might not work any 
better in the files than they have on the 
farm. 
Why the Reserves? 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. J. ARTHUR YOUNGER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 1966 
Mr. YOUNGER. Mr. Speaker, it is 
certainly difficult to get all the facts con-
cerning our situation in South Vietnam, 
but one fact is more than evident and 
that is that the enemy has greatly 
strengthened its position during the ces-
sation of bombing by resupplying, re-
grouping, and bringing in additional 
materiel which they could do without 
molestation. 
This view is set forth in Joseph Alsop's 
column published in the Washington 
Post on February 2. Since he is on the 
ground in Saigon, his advice and report 
on the situation are all the more im-
portant. 
His column follows: 
WHY THE RESERVES? 
(By Joseph Alsop) 
Ssmon.?The reasons the President ought 
to be getting ready to call up the Reserves 
for the Vietnamese war are grimly simple. 
There are between 12 and 20 reasons already, 
and some more are probably on the way. 
In brief, this country has now been in-
vaded by a rock-bottom minimum of 12 
North Vietnamese regular regiments, or the 
equivalent of 4 divisions of the North Viet-
namese Army. This is not the official order 
of battle figure, to be sure, for that figure, 
so comforting to people in Washington, is 
generally about 14 months behind the harsh 
truth. 
An invasion on a minimum scale of four 
division equivalents is the reading of much 
hard evidence by the Americans here who 
have been most nearly right in the past. 
There is a great deal of evidence, further-
more, not absolutely decisive but alarmingly 
persuasive, that the real total of invading 
North Vietnamese has now reached 15 regi-
ments or 5 division' equivalents. 
Nor is that all. There is some evidence 
for the even higher total of 20 invading regi-
ments, or close to 7 division equivalents 
of North Vietnamese. These last indications 
are pretty shadowy, as yet, but they deserve 
to be noted and weighed all the same. 
In comparable situations in the past, un-
fortunately, the absolute maximum guess of 
the dimensions of the enemy buildup has 
usually, in the end, proved to be the correct 
guess. Furthermore, these acutely disturb-
ing estimates of enemy strength "in coun-
try," as they say out here, are not the whole 
story, either. 
Just north of the 17th parallel, on the very 
edge of the demilitarized zone, at least one 
additional North Vietnamese division is now 
in position. And if a second division has 
not moved up already, as seems most likely, 
It is quite certainly on the way and nearly 
in position. It may be added that the North 
Vietnamese have regularly been sending 
troops and cadres across the western end of 
the allegedly demilitarized zone for some 
time past. 
Finally, the North Vietnamese have taken 
frenzied advantage of the bombing pause to 
accumulate very large forward stocks of mili-
tary supplies on the border of the demili-
tarized zone. In this respect, the pause has 
een a golden boon to the enemy. Previ-
ously, there was no transport for such a 
buildup, since the most southerly provinces 
of North Vietnam had been under contin-
uous attack for 8 full months. 
When and if these consequences of the 
long pause hit the Marines at Phu Bat with 
painful force, as seems all too possible, it 
will be interesting to hear their reactions. 
Perhaps they will send a little round robin, 
beginning: "Thank you, Mr. President; thank 
you, Senator MANSFIELD and Senator Fun-
BRIGHT; thank you, dear editors and analysts 
who have never set foot in Asia." 
Such are the facts. They may be denied 
in Washington or even, on instruction, in 
Saigon, as such unpleasant facts have been 
denied in the past. But denials will not 
make them unfacts. 
These are the facts, it should first be 
noted, primarily because the North Viet-
namese Communist Government not merely 
called the reserves to the colors but also 
ordered general mobilization some time ago. 
Premobilization, the entire North Vietnam-
ese Army consisted of only five divisions, 
plus enough independent brigades and regi-
ments to equal a bit more than five addi-
tional divisions. 
Two of the original divisions, the 325th 
and the 308th, were sent South in tact when 
the decision was taken to invade South 
Vietnam with regular units. Since then, 
the units remaining in North Vietnam have 
been rather rapidly giving off additional 
regiments to join the southern invasion. 
Thus the army in the North approximately 
retains its original strength, less two divi-
sions. 
The meaning of these facts is also all too 
plain. The people who think the President 
has an option to keep this war cozily un-
combative are talking through their hats. 
The enemy has been rapidly escalating, 
to use these peoples' favorite word. Since 
there is .no evidence that the North Viet-
namese leaders are insane, it has to be as-
sumed that the aim of this heavy and in-
creasing invasion of South Vietnam by 
Communist regular units is, quite simply, to 
win control of South Vietnam by naked 
force of arms. 
Thus far, the invasion has had no openly 
dramatic consequences, mainly because of a 
brilliant series of spoiling attacks mounted 
by General Westmoreland. But since the 
enemy's purpose is so abundantly plain, and 
since his buildup is so ominously heavy, 
President Johnson has only two options. 
He can get ready to retreat and to surrender. 
Or he can get ready to fight in earnest, in 
which case he has a clear duty to call up 
the Reserves. 
Men Against the Wall 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ANDREW JACOBS, JR. 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2,1966 
Mr. JACOBS. Mr. Speaker, this edi-
torial from the Indianapolis Star of Jan-
uary 30, 1966, speaks well for itself. 
I intend to introduce legislation re-
quiring the Internal Revenue Service to 
grant to a delinquent taxpayer, against 
whose income levy is being made, an ex-
emption to meet the indispensable needs 
to maintain life. 
I do not believe any tax delinquent 
should, at the sufferance of the Govern-
ment, drink champagne and play the 
ponies. 
But, neither should he be denied daily 
bread. Those serving life prison terms 
are treated better than that. 
MEN AGAINST THE WALL 
Both the Federal and State laws making it 
possible to confiscate entire paychecks or 
seize all of a person's assets to collect over-
due taxes are harsh and unreasonable. They 
are due for drastic revision. 
The suicide of a 24-year-old auto plant 
worker with a wife and child, whose pay was 
confiscated by State authorities to satisfy 
tax bills, brings an evil situation into sharp 
focus. 
It cannot be shrugged off justifiably with a 
cavalier excuse that taxpayers who go deeply 
into debt and are unable to meet their obli-
gations on time simply got themselves into 
the fix and so deserved to be punished. 
This is not to say that taxes should not be 
collected or that anyone obligated to pay 
them should not be forced by law to do so. 
Nor is it to say that solvency and fiscal re-

firsthand of the accomplishments and 
needs of resource development through-
out the area. 
I wish to salute those farmers arid 
ranchers in Kansas who make many 
sacrifices to serve as soil conservation 
district directors and to express the 
thanks of generations yet unborn to 
those who cooperate with the district in 
tacking the proper use and development 
of our rich resources of soil and water. 
What these farmers and ranchers do 
in establishing conservation measures on 
their land beneflts all landowners and 
operators. 
The 15 counties in the Second District 
of Kansas are completely covered by soil 
conservation districts. District coopera-
tors number 15,021 and own and operate 
more than 3.6 million acres of land. 
They have installed about 34,000 miles 
of terracing, 10,000 farm ponds, 80,090 
acres of grassed waterways. They have 
put 855,000 acres of range to proper use 
and converted 44,000 acres of cropland 
to grassland. 
In addition, the local districts are ex-
tremely active in small watershed work 
under Public Law 566. Construction has 
been completed on two of the four proj-
ects approved for operations. These 
projects not only halt destructive floods 
but can also be developed for municipal 
water supplies, recreation, and agricul-
tural water management. 
Everyone within the water shed bene-
fits?rural and urban interests alike. 
For example, in the recently completed 
White Clay, Brewery, Whiskey Creeks 
project, both rural and urban land is pro-
tected. Before the project was installed, 
the city of Atchison stood in the shadow 
of damaging floods. Yearly flood dam-
ages in the watershed averaged $260,000. 
One disastrous flood in 1958 took three 
Eves and caused damages in excess of $4 
million. 
Thanks to the new watershed project, 
this should never happen again. Last 
June, the project's effectiveness was 
tested during a 3.6-inch downpour and 
no damage occurred. 
In addition to the four projects com-
pleted or under construction on 158,000 
acres of land, six projects have been ap-
proved for planning assistance on 710,-
000 acres of land. There are an addi-
tional six applications on 378,000 acres 
awaiting action. 
These projects are local undertakings. 
They are initiated and sponsored by local 
people through their soil conservation 
districts. I salute them for the work 
they are doing in conserving and devel-
oping our land and water resources. 
poverty and its effects can be marked 
only loy area accomplizlunents. 
Th e, Economic Opportunity Act is 
founded on several significant purposes, 
one of which is to provide programs 
which will prepare our young people for 
the responsibilities of citizenship. One 
of the necessities of this preparation is 
the evolvement of effective educational 
backgrounds for our citizens. With this 
neceEsity as its goal, the lighted school-
house project was undertaken in my 
kome community of Rochester, N.Y. 
I am pleased today to share a progress 
report on this project with my collea-
Rues in Congress. The following article 
iwaa published durine: adjournment in 
the November 1965, issue of Greater

by Action for a Better community, Inc., the 
antipoverty agency of tile city of Rochester 
aIld Monroe County, held what amounted to 
a "crash program" in J. and August. 
Nicholas R. Miiella, on loan from the city 
school district, and Sister Jameretta, simi-
larly on loan from the Catholic diocesan 
Nei Loci's, are codirectors of site lighted school-
lions, project. The Reverend William M.

Catholic diocese, and flar Herman R. Gold-
berg, superintendent of -the Rochester public 
schools, have given carte blanche invitations 
to use the resources of their stairs and facili-

The directors think that the teachers who 
received the nearly 1,000 boys and girls into 
pit Mee and parochial schools this September 
are li:nding the lighted schoolhouse students 
"atti-indinally better" in these speciac ways.

Involvement in school life, especially high 
school students---as so many rind themselves 
worked out to the periphery of all the school's 
central activity. Once on the edge, these 
eludents have pretty much reached the point 
of U) return and the next step is to fade

Mach center was stalled with a director, a 
guidance counselor, a speech therapist, a 
remedial reading teacher, a psychologist on 
(alai, music and art teachers, and the teaching 
sisal. to handle the basic instructional pro-
gram. 
"r 'm 300 applicants for teaching routines, 
70 well-qualified persons were selected. To 
these about 25 volunteers, both professional 
and. aonprofessional, were added. College and 
high school students who were free to serve 
in the summer program performed ably. 
aegregate daily attemlance for the summer 
totaled 23,591. The total cost of staffing all 
centers this summer amountd to $39,609?
the oo8t per pupil for instructional staff for 
weeks amounted to about $1.69 per day. 
This low cost could not have been main-
tained if it had not been that nearly 5,000 
1,11,111,0% 
hours of contributed services were rendered 
by volunteers. Cost for supplies aleeraged 
about $2 per pupil for the entire sessicin. 
Sister Jamesetta, SiS.J., codirector of the 
lighted schoolhouse project, holds a Ph. D. 
degree in educational psychology. She came 
to the project from Nazareth Academy where 
she was principal of this all-girl high school 
of 1,500 studente. 
Mr. Milella, Ii rifler principal of the Horace 
Mann School, No. 13, emphasized the whole-
hearted nonsectarian cooperation in the 
lighted schoolhouse project: 
"The live major centers found at 21come 
housing in the educational buildings of three 
Protestant churches, the top floor of one 
parochial school which was not being used, 
and in the area of three storefronts and the 
rooms te be found immediately aboiiie. All 
the centers are situated in the deprived 
neighborhoods as centrally as possibil e. 
"The sidellite centers, which were usually 
one- or two-room affairs, were used by pri-
mary children as the distance to a mAjor 
center might prove too great for these 
children to attend safely. An abandoned 
concrete 'block building once 'need as :a small 
printing establishment, a small house owned 
by St. Lucy's Catholic Church, the Sunday 
school rooms of the Atlantic Avenue Baptist 
Church, and the library room of the Gen-
esee Settlement House were securiid. In 
so selecting, centers within the neighbor-
hoods where the bulk of the target popula-
tion was to be served, we adhered. as closely 
as possible to the philosophy that the mes-
sage mut be taken to Garcia in as ureperten-
Lions manner as feasible. 
"It must be said that in talking to the 
church ruling bodies or to the heads of 
social institutions for space to operate the 
lighted schoolhouse project, that Sister 
J.imcstti and myself were most warmly wel-
comed and shown every courte;iy. It is most 
enlightening and heartwarming to nate that 
people M. all faiths joined in the effort to 
help the less fortunate. Each group we 
approached for help said in essence, 'Come 
and use us and what we have in we vs that 
you see fit.' The giant force for good to be 
found represented in our great religious 
faiths, are facing up to facts and are lending 
a most helpful hand in ways of contribut-
ing talent and material resources so as to 
aid in the fight to right the moral wrongs 
which have perpetrated upon such a large 
segment of our society." 
Group guidance sessions helped the lighted 
sehoolhouse students to sustain the idea 
that they could learn, to be loved, and have 
hope for a promising future; that learning 
did not take place because of fear of failure, 
but because of individualized instruction in 
which :not knowing was not anything of 
which to be ashamed, and small successes 
received recognition. 
Our Rochester community has benefitted 
by this well-executed summer program and 
is most grateful to the administrators, teach-
ers, and all who were responsible for iM help-
fulness and obvious success.

RESOLUTION 236 
Whereas the Florida Police Chiefs Asso-

place the children of this Nation play in the 
everyday function of our lives; and 
Whereas the police departments through-
out this great country are ever on the alert 
to warn parents and children alike on that 
great menace, the child molester; and 
Whereas the St. Petersburg Police Depart-
ment, with the great help of _Mrs. A. C. 
"Pat" Hutchison and her charming child 
dummy "Yabby," who both joined the St. 
Petersburg police force, have been a great 
help in deterring this great menace to soci-
ety; and 
Whereas the above mentioned, with the 
help of the Florida Federation of Women's 
Clubs and many civic-minded people in the 
city of St. Petersburg, have been responsible 
in the production of the sound color film 
"The Riddle of the Friendly Stranger," which

Fla., on October 3, 1964, unanimously com-
mend the above-mentioned organizations 
with a particular commendation to "Gabby"

PUNXSUTAWNEY GROUNDHOG 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Pennsylvania (at 
the request of Mr. HALL) was granted 
permission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, each year on February 2, at 
sunrise, the immortal Punxsutawney 
groundhog emerges from his lair on 
Gobbler's Knob. It is an important day, 
not only for Punxsutawney but for the 
entire Nation because what Mr. Ground-
hog encounters will determine the des-
tiny of the Nation for the next 6 weeks. 
If he sees his shadow, he will rapidly 
disappear into his burrow and we can 
then expect 6 more weeks of winter. 
But, if the groundhog fails to see his 
shadow he will frolic and enjoy his new 
emergence into the out-of-doors and 
winter will gradually disappear and 
warm and balmy spring weather will 
prevail. 
This year after some effort, as is his 
custom, Mr. Groundhog appeared at sun-
rise and unfortunately his shadow was 
plainly visible and he did not remain 
very long in the outside world. 
The people of Punxsutawney and 
vicinity rely heavily on the groundhog 
for this accurate weather forecast and 
natives say that it is an infallible 
weather vane. Business programs and 
many projects and activities are held off 
pending the arrival of Groundhog Day 
and the decision of the weather prophet. 
Punxsutawney observes Groundhog 
Day fittingly and with great pride. A 
celebration is held, a civic banquet is 
staged, and all communications media in 
the Nation give this remarkable occur-
ence tremendous publicity and recogni-
tion. But Mr. Groundhog takes it all in 
stride and calmly goes on about his busi-
ness of the day. You see he is a very 
aristocratic animal, ever conscious of his 
lineage and shows that he is the only 
real true groundhog and that other im-
posters and fakers trying to assume his 
title are of inferior rank and should be 
ignored. 
I am sure that all Members of the 
Congress join with me in extending best 
wishes and warm felicitations to that 
great city of Punxsutawney as they mark 
the passing of another year and the 
emergence from his den of their best 
friend?the Punxsutawney groundhog. 
(Mr. MOORE (at the request of Mr. 
HALL) was granted permission to extend 
his remarks at this point in the RECORD 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
[Mr. MOORE'S remarks will appear 
hereafter in the Appendix.] 
POSTAL INSPECTORS LOOK AT MAIL 
SERVICE 
(Mr. LANGEN (at the request of Mr. 
HALL) was granted permission to extend 
his remarks at this point in the RECORD 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. LANGEN. Mr. Speaker, I was 
glad to note that the Post Office Depart-
ment has responded to my request for a 
probe of mail service throughout the 
Nation. I refer specifically to the news 
that more than 200 postal inspectors 
descended on the Nation's 72 largest post 
offices a week ago in an effort to deter-
mine the cause of delayed and mis-
directed mail. 
While this is an excellent beginning, I 
only hope that these inspectors extend 
their activities into the rural areas of 
the Nation and take the time to hear 
the complaints of the people at large 
as well as the local postal officials who 
must labor under a system that was not 
of their own design. 
I was particularly interested to note 
that the teams of postal inspectors, part 
of a 6-month task force study, are headed 
by A. C. Hahn, Deputy Assistant Post-
master General for Operations. That 
gentleman was in my office less than 2 
weeks ago and assured me at that time 
that the Post Office Department intends 
to improve mail service across the entire 
Natioh, including rural areas, following 
the current study. It is hoped that this 
probe of deteriorated mail service will 
result in positive proposals for restoring 
the postal service to at least the level of 
performance formerly enjoyed. 
I would also hope that the people of 
the Nation will openly convey their prob-
lems and experiences to the postal in-
spectors when they visit. The views of 
the patron public are every bit as im-
portant as the views of the postal per-
sonnel and I hope the public view will 
be solicited by the inspection teams. 
And if given the chance, I certainly urge 
every person with a postal problem to 
speak up and be heard.

GUADALUPE MOUNTAIN?POTEN-
TIAL NATIONAL PARK SITE 
(Mr. REINECKE (at the request of 
Mr. HALL) was granted permission to 
extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. REINECKE. Mr. Speaker, last 
week I was tending to business in my 
district and official committee business 
of inspecting the Guadalupe Mountain, 
potential national park site, near El Paso. 
As such I was unable to be present for 
rollcall No. 3 regarding House Commit-
tee on Un-American Activities. Had I 
been here, Mr. Speaker, I would have 
voted "yea." 
VIETNAM 
(Mr. DICKINSON (at the request of 
Mr. HALL) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. DICKINSON. Mr. Speaker, on 
the floor of the House Monday, my dis-
tinguished colleague from Wisconsin, the 
Honorable MELVIN R. LAIRD, called for a 
quarantine of North Vietnam. Cer-
tainly an embargo on all free world and 
other shipping to North Vietnam is im-
perative. American fathers, sons, hus-
bands, and brothers are fighting and 
being killed in Vietnam. This was not 
the case when the late President Ken-
nedy ordered the American Navy and Air 
Force to quarantine Communist Cuba. 
Republicans support Mr. LAnues stand 
In favor of a quarantine of North Viet-
nam. I feel most strongly, however, that 
this should not be a partisan matter. It 
obviously damages our prestige in Asia if 
our Allies continue to ship vital materials 
to our Communist enemies in Vietnam. 
It is amazing that British flag vessels 
are leading this parade of free world 
shipping since Australian Common-
wealth troops are battling there along 
with our Americans. Moreover, as I have 
pointed out, we have cooperated fully in 
the embargo on Rhodesia in Africa and 
the least the British can do is reciprocate. 
No public call for such reciprocation has 
been made'. 
Now, according to the Washington 
Post, the latest Soviet MIG fighters, the 
MIG 21's, are turning up in Vietnam to 
oppose our bombings there. The Post 
asserts these shipments may have come 
by sea on Soviet ships arriving at North 
Vietnam ports. 
May I also state that the failure to 
establish an embargo on even free world 
shipments to North Vietnam must raise 
a serious question as to the administra-
tion's wholeheartedness in conducting 
the Vietnam war. Are our beloved ones 
to risk their lives, and even die, in Viet-
nam because our friends trade with our 
enemies?and theirs? 
In this connection, with unanimous 
consent, I introduce excerpts from an 
article in the Chicago Tribune by Walter 
Trohan, its distinguished chief Washing-
ton correspondent: 
RUSK PERSISTS IN H/S VIEW OF ASIAN REDS 
AS AGRARIANS 
WASHINGTON, January 30.?Once a Com-
munist Is identified as an agrarian reformer,

1744 1966 
he remains an agrarian to Secretary of State 
Dean Rusk. 
Twenty years ago, when he was Assistant 
Chief of Security Affairs for the State De-
partment, Rusk was one of the dedicated 
clique of appeasers in the State Department 
who believed that Mao Tse-tung and his fol-
lowers were "agrarian reformers." 
On January 21 this year an Australian re-
porter asked Rusk at his press conference 
whether he didn't think there is something 
incongruous in the fact that the British are 
shipping munitions and other materials to 
the Vietcong while Australians, who are part 
of the British Commonwealth, are fighting 
the Vietcong. 
Rusk replied that he was not aware that 
any munitions were being supplied by ship 
to the Vietcong. Then he added that "free 
world shipping to North Vietnam has been 
very drastically reduced in the past several 
months." 
NORTH VIETS PICTURED AS TRUCK GARDENERS 
"We know that strategic materials are 
not moving into North Vietnam by ship," 
he continued. "Indeed, many of those free 
world ships go in empty In order to bring 
out fresh fruits and fresh vegetables and 
other products for other countries." 
This would seem to make it clear that it 
is his idea that the Communist North Viet-
namese, and very likely the Vietcong, are 
truck farmers and market gardeners. 
At the Library of Congress it was reported 
that the principal vegetables grown in 
Vietnam are rice and sweet potatoes, for 
home consumption. Fruits are not listed as 
as major crop. 
However, Mr. Rusk knows--as does every 
American?that the Communist North Viet-
namese are sending bombs to the Vietcong 
which are being employed by them to kill 
Americans at the front in South Vietnam. 
Lt could be that he confused these "pine-
apples" with fruit. 
It would seem that Rusk doesn't know 
his fruit or Communist political applesauce. 
The Defense Department has reported that 
free world ships entered North Vietnamese 
ports in 1965. Rusk professes to believe all 
of these were under charter to Communist 
nations, but there is no law requiring free 
world nations to charter their ships for 
delivery of materials to kill Americans. 
PHOSPHATE EX:PORTS VALUED IN MILLIONS 
Husk said free world shipping to North 
Vietnam has been "cut very drastically." Yet 
his own information division reported on 
January 11 that total imports by North Viet-
nam were $12,221,000 in 1964 and total ex-
ports, largely phosphates, were $23,400,000. 
Beth could go into the making of a lot of 
"pineapples." 
Press Officer Robert J. McCloskey said on 
.January 11: "Now a few of the countries 
involved are recipients of United States aid, 
and we are discussing this matter with them 
through diplomatic channels, which I have 
noted in the past: especially calling_ their 
attention to recently enacted amendments 
of the Foreign Assistance Act, which, in gen-
eral and under certain conditions, provide 
Cur the termination of United States aid." 
McCloskey estimated that there was a 
reduction of 60 percent in free world trade 
to North Vietnam in 1965. 
One cent of trade from a recipient of for-
eign aid is too much, just as one drop of 
Communist applesauce in a Rusk press con-
ference is too much. 
CONTEMPT' RESOLUTION 
(Mr. WALKER of Mississippi (at the 
request of Mr. HALL) was granted per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
neMt in the REcorui and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
ffill11.41S1 
Mr, WALKER of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker,. today we are being called on 
to vote for a resolution citing for con-
tempt several witnesses who failed to 
produce documents before the House 
Un-American Activities Committee rele-
vant to the Ku Klux Klan investiga-
tion. 
Certainly, those who fail to produce 
information demanded by a House in-
vestigating committee under a legal man-
date, should receive proper punishment. 
To speak out against such a procedure 
would be as unwise as to speak out 
against our Nation itself. Such is not 
my purpose here today. 
My objection to the resolution before 
this assembly does not question the right 
and perhaps the duty of Congress to 
recommend contempt proceedings for 
those who fail to produce relevant infor-
mation before an investigating commit-
tee. Instead, the objection I raise goes 
to a broader issue?]1 question the value 
of citing these 7 men for contempt while 
our Government is at this very same in-
stant allowing other persons, such as 
Prof. Stoughton Lynd, of Yale, and his 
cohorts, to blatantly boast of their trip 
to Hanoi as self-styled peace negotia-
tors for the United States. In direct 
defiance of the statutes promulgated by 
this body. 
When I am convinced that the present 
investigation before the Un-American 
Activities Committee will be broadened 
to include investigations of such left-
wing enemies of our Government as Pro-
fessor Lynd and his crowd. I can whole-
heartedly support appropriate legislation 
to punish those who fail to obey the legal 
mandates of this body's investigating 
committees. 
On April 14, 1965, introduced a reso-
lution (H. Res. 336) which would au-
thorize the necessary appropriation for 
an investigation of such radical un-
American groups as the Student Non-
Violent Coordinating Committee?SNCC, 
and Council of Federated Organiza-
tions?00F0, which are constantly 
demonstrating against our military ef-
fort in Vietnam as well as encouraging 
young men to avoid the draft. My reso-
lution also included an investigation of 
the Southern Christian Leadership Con-
ferenge?SCLC, headed by the notorious 
Martin Luther King who recently stated 
on a nationwide television program that 
he should be able to choose which laws 
to obey and which laws not to obey. 
Such an investigation could be expanded 
to include Professor Lynd's group as 
well. 
A number of my colleagues have seen 
t: l; to offer a motion to recommit the 
contempt resolution to a select commit-
tee to be named by the Speaker. 
I do not believe this to be the proper 
course of action since, in my opinion, it 
would materially weaken the House Un-
American Activities Committee. 
Even though the alternative course 
iii to support the contempt citation 
against the seven witnesses whom we 
were furnished no information whatso-
ever until we enter the House Chamber, 
it is our obligation to back the House 
Un-American Activities Committee in its 
recommendations. To do otherwise 
would weaken its position when investi-
gating our real enemies, the Communists 
and Communist-front organizations 
which are so detrimental to our way of 
life. 
CAUSE FOR CONCERN 
(Mr. ASHBROOK (at the request of 
Mr. HALL) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, indi-
cative of the pride which most American 
citizens have in our servicemen fighting 
in Vietnam is the following resolution 
passed by the Council of the City of 
Newark in the 17th Congressional Dis-
trict of Ohio. The members of the city 
council are certainly to be commended 
for their action in reassuring our troops 
that their sacrifices have not been for-
gotten. I include Resolution 65-88 of 
the City Council of Newark, Ohio, at this 
point: 
RESOLUTION 65-88 
Resolution commending the armed services 
of the United States for their participation 
In the defense of our country in Vietnam 
Resolved by the Council of the City of 
Newark, State of Ohio (all members elected 
thereto concurring): 
SECTIOlg 1. That the armed services of the 
United States be, and they hereby are, com-
mended for their defense of our country in 
Vietnam. 
SEC. 2. That certified copies of this reso-
lution expressing the appreciation of this 
council speaking for and on behalf of the 
citizens of the city of Newark, Ohio, shall 
be forthwith mailed by the clerk to the 
President of the United States, to the Con-
gressmen serving this city and to all area 
servicemen in Vietnam and surrounding 
areas. 
SEC. 3. That this resolution shall take ef-
fect and be in force from and after the 
earliest period allowed by law. 
Adopted the 20th day of December 1965. 
ROBERT W. WORTMAN, 
President of Council. 
Attest: 
DOROTHY A. HOUDESHELL, 
Clerk of Council. 
Date approved by the mayor. December 
21, 1965. 
DAVID R. EVANS, 
Mayor. 
Approved as to form: 
A. DAVID LIST, 
City Solicitor. 
Most American citizens will also agree, 
I am sure, that every effort humanly pos-
sible must be made to guarantee our men 
the supply of equipment, weapons, and 
food necessary to carry out their vital 
mission. Consequently, recent published 
information that the unloading of sup-
plies in Vietnamese ports has been inade-
quate and long delayed and that respon-
sible recommendations for expediting un-
loading operations have not been imple-
mented give true cause for concern. 
A news item from the New York Times 
of January 22, 1966, illustrates the seri-
ousness of prevailing conditions. Presi-
dent Thomas Gleason, of the Interna-
tional Longshoremen's Association, after 
two trips to Saigon, is reported as being 
"truly disappointed" with the lack of 
progress made in correcting the situation

which he surveyed back in October of 
last year. 
The columnist Victor Riesel, in a re-
cent column, repeats the same theme; 
namely, that efforts by knowledgeable 
labor leaders to help correct present port 
conditions in Vietnam have been ignored. 
In the hope that any necessary correc-
tive measures are undertaken at once, I 
wish to call to the attention of my fel-
low Members the two above-mentioned 
items at this point in the RECORD. 
[From the New York Times, Jan. 22, 1966] 
ILA CHIEF UPSET OVER SAIGON JAM?SAYS 
PROPOSALS To CLEAR PORT HAVE BEEN PUT 
OFF 
(By John P. Callahan) 
Thomas W. Gleason, who has been to Sai-
gon twice to break the bottleneck of mount-
ing cargo and clear the congestion of in-
bound supply ships, said yesterday that he 
was disappointed over the delay in imple-
menting suggestions for clearing the port. 
"I guess it is the traditional impatience 
of Americans," Mr. Gleason, the president of 
the International Longshoremen's Associa-
tion, remarked in a news conference in the 
union's headquarters, 17 Battery Place. 
Mr. Gleason and four other senior long-
shoremen were in South Vietnam in Septem-
ber and again in December at the request 
of harried officials of the State Department 
and the Agency for International Devel-
opment. 
INFLUX OF SHIPS 
Food and other civilian supplies are pour-
ing in for a population, in Saigon alone, that 
rose from 1 to 3 million in the last few years 
Mr. Gleason said, and port facilities are in-
adequate. As a result of the influx of Ameri-
can merchant ships and the shortage of 
equipment and trained waterfront man-
power, ships have been idle in the harbor of 
Saigon for as long as 3 weeks, before being 
unloaded. 
Last October, after completing his first 
visit of 15 days, Mr. Gleason made several 
recommendations to the State Department. 
These included the opening of hiring halls 
(or employment centers) where dockworkers 
could be assigned efficiently to certain work 
areas. "This alone would have increased 
productivity by at least 25 percent," he said. 
He also urged registering the 5,000 long-
shoremen in Saigon with a waterfront com-
mission type of organization and assigning 
the men to definite shifts, both day and 
night. He said there was an extreme short-
age of pier equipment such as hi-lo vehicles 
and other mechanized cargo-handling gear. 
TRULY DISAPPOINTED 
He also said that when he arrived in Sai-
gon on his second visit last month, he was 
"truly disappointed that the report" sub-
mitted in October to the State Department 
after his first visit, "including recommenda-
tions, had not been carried out." 
With Mr. Gleason during the news con-
ference was George P. Delaney, State Depart-
ment Coordinator of International Labor 
Affairs, who said that the Agency for Inter-
national Development was "in agreement" 
with the recommendations made by Mr. 
Gleason. 
Mr. Delaney also said that the equipment 
needed for efficient port operation in Saigon 
was on its way from various Asian ports, in-
cluding Manila, Yokohama and Honolulu. 
Mr. Gleason said that about 220,000 tons 
of cargo were handled each month in Saigon 
and that with an increase in efficiency, this 
figure could be increased to more than 
600,000 tons. 
"Unless conditions are improved in a 
hurry," Mr. Gleason declared, "the area faces 
the risk of inflation and food panic. We 
have every reason to assume that the corn-
bined effort to the State Department and 
the Vietnam Government will avert such a 
situation." 
U.S. OFFICIALS ARE ATTEMPTING To CONCEAL 
VIET SUPPLY TIEUP 
(By Victor Riesel) 
A brass curtain has been lowered by Penta-
gon and State Department officials around 
the slow-motion Vietnam supply system. 
The folds of that curtain are being used to 
gag union officials, who have learned of 
lethargy, lack of planning, corruption, and 
rule-book inefficiency now slowing the flow 
of equipment, weapons and food to our troops 
and allies. 
Because of ancient Army regulations, mil-
lions of dollars are being wasted weekly. 
Cargo ships which should be speeding the 
oceans are idling at anchor. Seamen who 
could be working, and have volunteered and 
have been rejected, are stewing on hot decks 
in a steaming sun for 50 and 60 empty days 
at a stretch. And troops go without ammu-
nition, food, and tools. 
All this?and far more?has been learned 
by waterfront union leaders. But the Navy 
and the State Department this past week 
forbade them to report their findings to the 
public. 
Since the Vietcong gets word of all this to 
Hanoi long before U.S. intelligence gets its 
reports to Washington, State Department 
and Pentagon brass obviously are seeking to 
withhold the story from the American public 
and from President Johnson himself. 
Unloading of vital cargo in South Viet-
namese ports is notoriously leisurely. 
Though several years ago it became obvious 
that huge supplies would have to pour into 
the mudbank bays and ports, the military did 
little planning. Even now slender women, 
weighing less than 100 pounds, carry 200 
pound bags of cargo. Corruption is more 
rampant than malaria. But everybody says 
little can be done. 
Result is that the Army uses its own long-
shoremen gangs to unload supplies. They 
are short handed. So they work one hatch 
at a time. But they can get help?and not 
from the South Vietnamese flesh peddlers, 
either. 
Crews, belonging to the National Maritime 
Union (NMU), headed by Big Joe Curran, 
have offered to help empty the holds of ships 
they manned across the oceans. 
Their assistance would be of gigantic help 
in solving problems on which the Interna-
tional Longshoremen's Association (ILA) 
president, Ted Gleason, and four of his 
veteran ILA colleagues have been working in 
Saigon for over a month. 
But the Army says no. 
The military turns down the American sea-
men because the regulations say that no 
civilian shall unload the supplies. 
Yet the American merchant sailors are 
doing nothing on deck. Their ships are held 
out in the harbor, or in Cam Ranh Bay or 
Qui Nhon Bay or as far as Manila. The 
vessels sometimes hang over, idle and fully 
loaded, for 50 or 60 days. 
The longer it takes to unload these ves-
sels, the longer the ever-arriving freighters 
must stay on the hook. This is costing the 
United States many millions of dollars. The 
Government must pay an average of $5,000 
a day for each ship while at sea. This is 
a charge under the charter arrangement. So 
if there are 50 or more ships idling in the 
harbor or bay for 50 or more days at some 
$5,000 daily, it comes to sorriewhat more 
than the take on a charity bingo game night. 
To take a first-hand look at the maze and 
mess, Joe Curran has dispatched two NIVIU 
officials to Saigon. With their experience 
they may yet show the military how to tow 
in World War II liberty ships, anchor them 
and turn them into waterborne tool ships and 
"reefer" vessels (refrigerator ships). 
1745 
Thus as in the last big conflict, there could 
be fully equipped floating repair and as-
sembly shops, mammoth floating ice boxes 
for perishable foods, floating warehouses into 
which the other freighters could empty their 
holds. 
Then the ships need not idle for as long 
as a month. They could return for new, 
desperately needed cargo. And crews could 
be consolidated on those craft which must 
stay in the bays while skeleton crews take 
some freighters home. Some could be flown 
back to crew undermanned ships at this end. 
It takes planning. There has been mighty 
little. 
Small wonder the brass' curtain has been 
rung down on that corner of the China Sea. 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA FEDERATION OF 
CIVIC ASSOCIATIONS SAYS THE 
DISTRICT'S POOR AREAS SUFFER 
IN MATTERS OF SNOW REMOVAL 
AND CLEANING AND BEAUTIFI-
CATION 
(Mr. WIDNALL (at the request of Mr. 
HALL) was granted permission to extend 
his remarks at this point in the RECORD 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. WIDNALL. Mr. Speaker, the poor 
areas in the District of Columbia suffer 
In the matter of snow removal, cleaning, 
and beautification, as a result of the Dis-
trict's concentration on its more affluent 
areas, according to Nelson C. Roots, the 
new president of the District of Columbia 
Federation of Civic Associations. Mr. 
Roots told me today, and gave me per-
mission to release this statement, that: 
It appears that where most of the money 
is, most of the service and attention is given, 
and this applies across the board not only 
to snow but to services in general. Re-
cently, an organization I headed had a meet-
ing about this situation with an official of 
the Division of Sanitation and cited the real 
facts to him. 
The District gives its best services to the 
areas where the economic potential is high, 
such as Georgetown, Cleveland Park, Spring 
Valley, Foxhall Road, and the Chevy Chase 
areas, especially west of Rock Creek Park. 
This can be substantiated, I believe. 
The federation is trying to change this 
situation, but we are not having much suc-
cess. It seems like it i going to be a slow 
process, one of education. It is the fed-
eration's position that if snow has to be 
removed it ought to be removed all over, 
and the District's low-income areas should 
be kept just as clean of snow and debris, and 
need just as much beautification, as any 
other area. It takes more cleaning in a 
poor area than in the affluent areas. 
Mr. Speaker, the Evening Star today, 
In its society section, carries an article 
by Miss Betty Beale, its able and alert so-
ciety writer, which substantiates the 
views of Mr. Roots. According to this 
Star article, a well-to-do citizen in the 
Cleveland Park area was able to have 
the snow removed from in front of his 
home in time for a party. This article 
was called to my attention by citizens 
who are of the opinion that the streets 
In front of the city's police and fire sta-
tions and public gathering places should 
be cleared before side streets are cleared 
of snow to enable a party to get 
underway. 
A member of my staff reports that 
there were an overabundance of snow-

?Lary I, 1966 
plows and attention on Foxhall Road on 
Monday and Tuesday, going over the 
same area again and again even though 
it had been cleared. Another member 
of my staff reported seeing at least 30 
workmen in half a block on F Street on 
the same sidewalk, and getting into each 
other's way. 
Thomas F. Airis, Director of the Dis-
trict's Department of Highways and 
Traffic, gave this excellent snow order 
the afternoon of February 1: 
:Bona fide emergency situations in addition 
to the approved programs will be specifically 
handled as emergency situations, but an at-
tempt should be made to ascertain whether 
a bona fide emergency situation exists, other-
wise it will be much better for the Highway 
Department to proceed on an areawide plow-
ing basis without interference. 
It may well be doubted that the situa-
tion described by Betty Beale in her col-
umn in the Evening Star of February 2 
merited the special priority attention 
given it by Thomas F. Airis of the Dis-
trict's Department of Highways and 
Traffic. In fact, it seems to be complete-
ly out of step with the sensible policy 
laid down by Thomas F. Airis which I 
have quoted. 
Officials of the Division of Sanitation 
have advised my office that they invari-
ably give priority to bona fide cases in-
volving safety of life and limb, and that 
a party such as that described by Miss 
Betty Beale would not qualify. 
Included is the Evening Star article 
.referred to above: 
IRAN'S :Ec. IIOSROVANIS FETED 
(By Betty Beale) 
"Charles de Gaulle never dined this well" 
'said a guest at the Ralph Beckers' party last 
evening in honor of the Iranian Ambassador 
arid Mrs. K hosrovani. 
Close to 40 peraons mushed their way 
through the snow to attend a black-tie din-
ner prepared by the gourmet host, himself. 
And after they had tasted the lobster vol-au-
vent, they knew the precarious trip to the 
Becker house had been worth it. That was 
before they had even sampled the fricandeau 
de vau that was covered with a superb sauce 
made with pate de foie gras and truffles. 
The dinner also marked the unveiling of a 
collection of Persian artifacts which Becker 
acquired 3 months ago. With the help of 
the head of Near Eastern Art at the Freer 
Gallery, Dr. Richard Ettinghausen, Ralph 
bought the entire beautiful collection, that 
Included pieces slating back 5,000 years, in a 
mere 30 minutes at the Hecht Co. 
With the aid of Smithsonian experts, they've 
been beautifully mounted on lighted glass 
shelves in the library. 
Setting on the shelves below the artifacts 
was a small, beautiful blue and gold china 
teapot which the patrician Mrs. Khosrovani 
took one look at and exclaimed: 
"That's mine. That belongs to my family." 
The two miniature portraits on the little 
pitcher were of members of the Qajar (Kajar) 
dynasty, which ruled Iran in the 19th cen-
tury up until the beginning of the 20th cen-
tury. The lovely looking Farah Khosrovani 
is a member of the Qajar family. 
In his toast to the honor guests, Becker 
mentioned her discovery of the teapot and 
her connection with it, and he also revealed 
that the Ambassador is distantly related to 
the Aga Khan. 
The dinner drew Kuwait Ambassador and 
Mrs. Al-Ghoussein, Moroccan Ambassador 
and Mrs. Laraki. the former ambassador to 
Iran, Raymond Hare (who is now assistant 
secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs) 
and Mrs. Hare; the two brothers-in-law who 
have served as ambassadors abroad and are 
now assigned to the State Department?
Lewis Jones and Bob Woodward?and their 
wives; former Assistant Secretary of State 
and Mrs. Andrew Berding, Dr. Ettinghausen 
and his wife, who was wearing a 3,000-Near-
old necklace from ancient Amlash, .tran, 
made of bone and green glass; former Am-
bassador and Mrs. Jefferson Patterson, Mrs. 
John Farr Simmons, Mrs. Jouett Shouse and 
the Hunter Drums. 
T. Graydon Upton, executive vice president 
of the Inter-American Development Bank, 
and his wife also were among the guesss, as 
were Ali Khosropur of the World Bank and 
his good looking brunette wife, who is the 
daughter of one of Iran's greatest pacts, 
Malik Ash-Shuara. 
Dinner conversation revealed that the 
Beakers had left no stone unturned in pre-
paring against every eventuality the weather 
might produce They had arranged to have 
the street path widened in their block which 
took no little doing, since the majority of 
the city's snow-removing equipment was 
being used by private parki:ag lots 
Before they succeeded in 'widening the 
paths, they had arranged for a bus to carry 
their guests from the nearest available park-
ing space down the street to their house. 
And, finally, they had set up cots and sleep-
ing bags to accommodate 22 persons in the 
event the new snow fall should prevent some 
of the guests' getting home. That is what 
YOU might call the black-tie emergency plan 
for the city that is annually never prepared 
for snow. 
? S ? 
-Washington beauties abounded at the din-
ner-dance given in honor of Chief of Proto-
col Lloyd Hand Monday night. Not the least 
of them was his own wife, but the dinner was 
not in her honor, because it was a bin t hday 
party for Lloyd. He reached the ripe age of 
37 on Monday. 
The party was given by Kuwait Ambassa-
dor and Mrs. Al-Ghoussein, and, despite the 
deep blanket of snow that everybody started 
out under, 29 of the 40 guests managsd to 
get there. 
The Hands, themselves, had to walk a mile 
from their McLean (Va.) home in boots and 
slacks, carrying their party clothes in suit-
cases, to change in town. They were 
astounded that so many guests showeat up. 
"I appreciated the fact:that anyone would 
get out in that weather." he said. 
Lloyd's sister, Bethlyn Hand, came ad the 
-way from California for the party and for 
the weekend to celebrate his birthday and 
her own. It seems their parents managad to 
have her born on January 30 and Lloyd on 
January 31. 
The good-looking young women who ....at at 
the four tables for eight in the decorative 
loggia of the new embassy on Tilden Street 
were the wives of presidential assistants, 
Congressmen and other men who figure on 
the Washington scene. 
There was Moroccan Ambassador and Mrs. 
Laraki?she in a pink Parisian evening ,;own 
instead of her usual native Moroccan cress; 
Senator and Mrs. Frank Church; attractive 
Representative Scam ToNNEy, of Calif, mnia, 
and the lovely looking, Dutch-born, blond 
Mrs. Tunney in a beautiful gold brocade 
evening dress; Texas Representative JACK 
BROOKS and his beauteous brunette, Char-
lotte; Florida Representative PAUL Rooms 
arid the lovely, fragile-faced Becky; Presi-
dential Assistants Jack Valenti and Joe 
Callfano and their good-looking resp(ctive 
spouses-.-.Mary Margaret and Trudy; SCC 
Chairman Bill Henry and his chic Sherrye; 
Woody and Mary Mien Woodward and World 
Bank Representative Omar .Dajany and. his 
pretty blond Betty. 
Rita Tazy, the Moroccan beauty whose 
husband is with the World Bank, came with-
out him as he was unable to get into Wash-
ington from the s.kiing resort where he spent 
the weekend. And Venezuelan Ambassador 
Enrique Tejera-Paris came without Pepita, 
who is expecting and was overtired after 
their weekend in Palm Beach as house guests 
of Marjorie Post. 
Talaat Al-Ghoussein, the host, also was on 
that weekend in Palm Beach, but his very 
beautiful wife Bassima could not go because 
she was recuperating from her recent appen-
dectomy. 
No matter how great their effort to get 
there, looking at the pulchritude around the 
room, the men must have felt it definitely 
worthwhile. 
FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY 
(Mr. ELLSW()RTH (at the request of 
Mr. HALL) was granted permission to 
extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. ELLSWORTH. Mr. Speaker, last 
Thursday I introduced a concurrent res-
olution (H. Con. Res. 567) expressing 
the sense of the Congress with respect to 
the full and free interchange of views 
and information by agencies of the CrOV-
ernment shaping fiscal and monetary 
policy. A companion measure (S. Con. 
Res. 73) has been introduced in the other 
body by the ranking Republican Mem-
ber on the Joint Economic Committee, 
Senator JACOB K. JAVITS, of New York. 
Senator JAVITS has presented a thor-
ough and succinct analysis of the reasons 
for strengthening the coordination be-
tween the administration and the Fed-
eral Reserve Board. I agree with the 
views expressed by Senator JAVITS, and I 
would like to take this opportunity to re-
emphasize and reiterate some of these 
points. 
In our complex and dynamic economy 
It is mandatory that our fiscal and mone-
tary policies be closely correlated. For 
this to occur, the Federal Reserve Board, 
which is our chief monetary authority, 
and the three agencies of the administra-
tion?the Treasury Department, the 
Bureau of the Budget, and the Council 
of Economic Advisers?which, along with 
the President, largely determine fiscal 
policy, must work hand-in-hand. I am 
In complete agreement with Senator 
JAV/TS and several of my other colleagues 
on the Joint Economic Committee, in-
cluding the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. 
PROXMIRE, who has introduced a similar 
resolution, that the present state of co-
ordination and cooperation between 
these agencies is unsatisfactory. 
This fact was brought to the forefront 
last December during the hearings the 
Joint Economic Committee held on the 
Federal Reserve Board's decision to in-
crease the discount rate. One of the big 
questions was whether the Board had 
discussed its decision with the adminis-
tration and whether as a general rule the 
Federal Reserve is in close contact with 
the administration. 
The hearings showed that while the 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board 
meets fairly regularly with the President 
and his economic advisers, there is 
little, if any, coordination between the 
other Federal Reserve Governors and 
the administration. This in itself in-
dicates an immediate need for action to

February 2 At(Wdved For RechoisTGACIMMATA16-69W 
BOMM00400020010-5 
Improve the coordination procedure. 
With only one of the seven Board mem-
bers on so-called speaking terms with 
the administration, it is hard to believe 
that the Fed's ultimate decisions can be 
fully coordinated with the Government's 
fiscal authorities. Beside this, any con-
tact which the Fed Chairman does 
have with the President and the other 
members of the Quadriad, that is, the 
Secretary of the Treasury, the Director 
of the Bureau of the Budget, and the 
Chairman of the Council of Economic 
Advisers, Is on a strictly informal basis, 
or, as Senator JAVITS put it, on an "I 
will take you out to lunch" basis?quote 
from CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, January 28, 
1966, page 1333. In fact, just this Mon-
day, while testifying before the Joint 
Economic Committee on the Economic 
Report of the President, Gardner Ackley, 
Chairman of the Council of Economic 
Advisers, stated, in response to a ques-
tion from the ranking House Republican, 
my distinguished colleague from Mis-
souri [Mr. Cuaris], that the Quadriad 
had not met since December 6, even 
though the informal rules of the group 
call for a meeting every month. 
The resolution which I introduced last 
week would set the record straight. It 
would present a clear formula for reg-
ular meetings and orderly procedures. 
Again, in the words of Senator JAInTs, 
it would put Congress on record as 
favoring: 
First. Regular meetings?at least six times 
a year?of the Chairman of the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman 
of the Council of Economic Advisers, and 
the Director of the Bureau of the Budget. 
Second. Procedures which would require 
key administration economic advisers to 
keep the Federal Reserve Chairman fully 
apprised of any development or informa-
tion of which they are respectfully aware 
and which should be brought to the atten-
tion of the Board for the effective discharge 
of its responsibilities. 
Third. Procedures requiring the Federal 
Reserve Chairman to keep all members of 
the Federal Reserve Board fully apprised 
of any information he receives from the 
executive branch which has relevance to 
the effective and informed exercise b 
y the 
Board of its responsibilities. 
Mr. Speaker, I respectfully request 
that my resolution be given every con-
sideration and that this body take speedy 
action in correcting an imperfection 
which 'has too long gone unnoticed 
? 
WHO TOOK THE SILVER FROM THE 
SILVER LINING? 
(Mr. GURNEY (at the request of Mr. 
HALL) was granted permission to extend 
his remarks at this point in the RECORD 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. GURNEY'. Mr. Speaker, through 
the cloud of mystery that surrounds the 
administration's fancy footwork in jug-
gling budget figures, there are at least 
two facts that shine through bright and 
clear: that Government spending and 
the national debt are increasing stead-
ily and that we are not being told the 
whole story. I am introducing legisla-
tion today to assure the American peo-
No. 1.7-13 
pie that some of the money they are n 
hearing about?the profit from minti 
the new silverles,s coins?will be used 
pay off the national debt. 
The Treasury Department is manufac 
turing from one-fifth of 1 cent wort 
of metal, a coin which they sell for 
cents. Even including the manuficu 
lag expenses, the new dime costs le 
than a penny to produce. The new red 
edged quarter costs a fraction over 
cents and the new half dollar, which ha 
some silver in it, costs just under 2 
cents. That is a profit of 100 percen 
on half dollars and over 900 percent o 
quarters and dimes. I think we had a 
like to be able to turn that kind of 
profit on a business. 
The east of the silver coins used to b 
about 95 percent of their face value, s 
the Treasury came out about even. Bu 
now, with costs a fraction of the sellin 
price the Treasury will be turning ove 
a tidy profit to the administration. 
There are already 670 million of th 
new quarters in circulation, with a fac 
value of $167.5 million. The cost to th 
Treasury was only about $13 million?
a profit of just under $154 million. An 
they have just begun. 
The Treasury Department estimate 
that the net profit, or "seigniorage" on 
the new coins will be anywhere from $1.5 
billion to $2.5 billion during 1966 and 
1967. 
Where in the budget did we see this 
new windfall for the administration? It 
was not emphasized. The President did 
not bother to mention that along with 
the money from reinstated excise taxes 
and faster tax collecting methods he 
plans to make a tidy billion or two by 
giving us coins that do not jingle. 
He did not point out that these Great 
Society programs were costing more than 
the deficit showed and that he was mak-
ing up the difference with profits from 
this new money, which many people are 
now calling funny money. 
Although the main profit is a one-shot 
revenue, it will be followed by an esti-
mated $200 to $300 million a year. In 
addition, as the Treasury gets back worn-
out
si ver coins, it can melt them down 
or about $3.6 billion. 
This tremendous one-shot profit, and 
he continued annual income of about a 
uarter-billion a year is not a windfall 
money to be used for the President's 
Great Society experiments. It is money 
hat the American people deserve to hear 
bout and get an accounting for. 
Under the legislation I propose today, 
his Money would be used to pay off the 
ational debt, rather than be put in the 
ands of the Johnson administration's 
ig spenders. It would require that all 
e "seigniorage"?profit from the new 
oins be applied to the retirement of 
he national debt. 
This debt has climbed steadily under 
the heavy spending of the Kennedy-
Johnson administration?Congress has 
raised the ceiling 10 times in those 6 
years, from $293 billion in 1960 to $328 
billion just last year. The cost in inter-
est on this giant debt is now $11.6 billion 
a year?over 111/2 percent of the national 
budget.

It is time for the American taxpayer to 
demand a halt to this fiscal irresponsi-
bility that is costing them so much. To 
the taxpayer, the Great Society's prom-

POVERTY AND SECRECY 
(Mr. RUMSFELD (at the request of 
Mr. HALL) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. RUMSFELD. Mr. Speaker, an 
editorial in the January 24, 1966, edition 
of the Washington Post points up very 
well the danger to the American people 
when Government "throws the cloak of 
secrecy over the expenditure of public 
funds and the distribution of public of-
fices." The editorial refers to the Post 
Office Department's concealing the 
names of youths who worked in the De-
partment during the summer of 1965 
under a program described by the Post 
as "two-bit patronage peddling." 
The Post editorial appropriately 
praises Congressman ALBERT H. QUIE, 
of Minnesota, for his efforts in obtaining 
public release of the names of these post 
office employees. I want to add my sin-
cere thanks to my able colleague for his 
diligence in behalf of the public's right 
to know what its Government is doing. 
The Post editorial follows: 
POVERTY AND SECRECY 
Representative ALBERT H. QIIIE, of Min-
nesota, has performed a public service by 
obtaining the names of the youths who 
worked in the Post Office Department sum-
mer program. It discloses what everyone 
knew?that many of the jobs did not go to 
youths in need, as President Johnson had in-
tended. 
The impropriety of using these funds to 
pay off the friends and relatives of Congress-
men and Senators is exceeded only by the 
cowardice responsible for the decision to 
conceal the names. This decision, moreover, 
has made suspect the allocation of jobs even 
when justifiable under the terms of the 
proposal. 
The country ought to be alarmed by the 
power and the willingness of the Government 
to throw the cloak of secrecy over the ex-
penditure of public funds and the distribu-
tion of public offices. If the citizens of a 
free country have any right at all to know 
about the operations of their own Govern-
ment they have the right to know the names 
of those who occupy public offices paid for 
by their taxes. The funds here involved 
were not great but the incident gives thereby 
even more occasion for alarm because it 
suggests that a Department willing to em-
ploy secrecy to conceal such two-bit patron-
age peddling would exert even more effort 
to conceal larger finagling.

In conventional mortgages, the interest 
rate fluctuates with money markets. There-
fore, conventional mortgages are usually at 
par (lenders pay 100 or give the full face 
amount of the mortgage). 
By regulation of the Federal Housing Ad-
ministration and Veterans' Administration 
the buyer cannot pay the points or discount. 
Therefore it must be paid by the seller or 
owner. A property owner can avoid the prob-

basis if at all possible.

[Mr. PATMAN'S remarks will appear 
hereafter in the Appendix.] 
A VERY LAUDABLE "FIRST" 
(Mr. BURTON of California (at the re-
quest of Mr. EDWARDS of Louisiana) was 
granted permission to extend his remarks 
at this point in the RECORD and to in-
clude extraneous matter.) 
Mr. BURTON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, the San Francisco Sun Reporter 
in its January 22, 1966, issue ran an 
editorial entitled, "A Very Laudable 
'First.'" The editorial commends the 
President's appointment of Dr. Robert 
C. Weaver as Secretary of the newly 
created Department of Housing and 
Urban Affairs. 
I have early expressed my pleasure 
over the appointment of this outstand-
ing man and at this time place the full 
text of the editorial in the RECORD: 
A VERY LAUDABLE "Frasr" 
The pledge, given by President John F. 
Kennedy, that a Negro would be named to 
the President's Cabinet, was fulfilled this 
week in the appointment of Dr. Robert C. 
Weaver. The appointment is historic and 
cogent, carrying with it the greatest signif-
icance for our domestic economy and the 
broadest ramifications toward the solution 
of the Nation's frustrating housing problems. 
Dr. Weaver, the first Negro Cabinet member 
and first Secretary of the newly created Hous-
ing and Urban Development organization, 
has before him a monumental task. Presi-
dent Johnson, himself noted for taking 
monumental tasks in stride, grinning at 
Weaver during his press conference, said, 
"May the good Lord have mercy on you." 
Weaver returned the grin, an expression of 
solid satisfaction in having attained this 
high point of his ambitions in Government 
and politics. 
Dr. Weaver's qualifications overshadowed 
those of 300 names submitted to President 
Johnson as candidates. Following Weaver's 
nomination the Senate speedily confirmed 
his appointment by unanimous voice vote. 
Fresh out of Harvard with two degrees 
in 1933, Weaver went to work under Harold 
L. Ickes in the Department of the Interior. 
He earned his doctor's degree in economics 
from Harvard in 1934, then worked as a spe-
cial assistant in the Federal Housing Author-
ity from 1934-37, 1937-40 and with the War 
Production Board and the War Manpower 
Commission during World War II. After the 
war he taught at Columbia and New York 
Universities. Dr. Weaver established another 
"first" when New York Gov, Averell Harri-
man selected him as the first Negro to sit in 
a New York Governor's cabinet. His position 
was that of State rent administrator. 
Dr. Weaver's trek to Cabinet rank began 
5 years ago when President Kennedy ap-
pointed him Administrator of the Housing 
and Home Finance Agency. Twice during 
that period Weaver was denied the Cabinet 
position because Congress, strengthened by 
opposition from southern Congressmen, re-
fused Kennedy's request for establishment 
of a Department of Urban Affairs, to be 
headed by Weaver. Last year Congress finally 
authorized the plan. 
Meanwhile, Weaver had given further and 
impressive evidence of his qualifications. 
Senator A. WILLIS ROBERTSON, chairman of 
the Senate Banking Committee, who voted 
against Weaver when he was named Federal 
Housing Administrator, said the other day, 
"Although I thought he was going to be 
prejudiced, I have seen no evidence of preju-
dice." Democratic and Republican Members 
of Congress vied in praise of Weaver and his 
record. 
As head of the new Department, Dr. 
Weaver would receive $35,000 annually, an 
Increase of $5,000 over his HHFA salary. He 
will be in charge of overseeing multibillion-
dollar operations in low-rent public housing, 
community facilities, mass transportation, 
slum clearance, and a staggering variety of 
other Federal programs, many of them new. 
His job will continue to be one of the most 
difficult and frustrating in the Federal bu-
reaucracy. This includes establishing some 
authority over a vast assemblage of special 
Interest groups, all of them competing for 
special attention or funds. These include 
the mayors of our cities, the hornebuilders, 
the real estate agents, and the bankers who 
lend money, the planners, and various minor-
ity groups. 
Negroes are proud of Dr. Weaver's appoint-
ment, and equally proud that he so adroitly 
fought for this position. He most earnestly 
desired it and reportedly turned down two 
very attractive academic job offers while im-
patiently awaiting action on his appointment 
by the White House. 
One of the most hoped for changes in the 
housing picture is a new approach to slum 
clearance, which will give responsible con-
sideration to reasonable compensation and 
humane resettlement of those dispossessed 
by the clearance program. 
The President, Members of Congress, and 
the vast and complicated agencies and de-
partments, all deeply concerned with hous-
ing, are now convinced that Dr. Weaver can 
do the job. America is indeed fortunate in 
having a completely dedicated official at the 
head of the agency which concerns the very 
heart of our Nation?the homes of America. 
Negroes have a new confidence and a new 
pride in this new member of the President's 
official faiyiily. 
THE PRESIDENT'S CLEAR DUTY 
(Mr. CALLAN (at the request of Mr. 
EDWARDS of Louisiana) was granted per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. CALLAN. Mr. Speaker, on Mon-
day the President announced that he 
was forced to resume the bombing at-
tacks on North Vietnam. This was an 
agonizing decision, as is well known. 
That it was a decision he fervently sought 
to avoid has been well demonstrated by 
the withholding of these attacks while 
he sought an alternative way to peace. 
It has now been well documented 
throughout the world that the President 
has sought every opportunity to persuade 
the enemy to meet with us and discuss 
the issues in Vietnam. It has been 
equally well documented that these ef-
forts have met with naught but hostile 
rejection. 
There appears in yesterday's Wash-
ington Evening Star an editorial which 
sums up the background of the Presi-
dent's decision and touches upon the 
doubtful contribution of those who have 
criticized it. The editorial declares that 
there "should be an end to aimless 
speeches and protests which serve no 
better purpose than to undermine the 
President and to encourage the eneniy." 
, This is a sentiment in which many of 
us in this House concur. I have asked 
consent, therefore, to have the entire 
text of this editorial printed in the REC-
ORD where all may read it; and it follows 
herewith: 
1-13S CLEAR DUTY 
In deciding to order a resumption of bomb-
ing of military targets in North Vietnam, 
Mr. Johnson did what had to be done. As 
President and as Commander in Chief, con-
scious- of his responsibility to some 200,000 
American troops as well as the soldiers of our 
allies, who are under attack by a relentless 
foe, he could not have done otherwise. 
Obviously, it was not an easy decision to 
make. And the President, even while giving 
the order for the bombers to take off, renewed 
his pledge that the search for a just settle-
ment will go on. One aspect of the quest 
Is the arbitration proposal which Ambassa-
dor Goldberg has put before the U.N. Se-
curity Council. There is no occasion, how-
ever, for soaring hopes on this score. .Dur-
ing the bombing pause, which lasted for 37 
days, the Communists not only pressed 
ahead with the fighting; they also used the 
opportunity to redeploy their soldiers, bring 
up supplies, and repair the damage done to 
their transportation system. To have per-
mitted this to go on indefinitely, as some 
urged, could only have resulted in heavier 
American and allied casualties. To his cred-
it, his critics notwithstanding, the Presi-
dent was unwilling to pay this price. As 
he put it, it is our clear duty to do what we 
can to limit the casualty rolls which, in any 
event, will be long. 
What is to be said of the critics, especially 
those in the Senate? 
In 1776 Thomas Paine wrote that "these 
are the times that try men's souls." He 
also paid his respects to "the summer soldier 
and the sunshine patriot" who, in the crisis 
of that day, shrank from the demands of the 
war for freedom. If Paine were living now 
he might have something to say about sun-
shine Senators. 
It is not our purpose to be invidious in 
suggesting this. But last week's spectacle 
in the Senate was nothing less than aston-
ishlin thng. 
e course of a 4-hour grilling of Secre-
tary of State Rusk, one Senator after an-
other came forward to wring his hands. 
Senator FuLaraairr couldn't recall any issue 
about which there is so much apprehension. 
Pennsylvania's Senator CLAIM was scared to 
death that we are on the way to world war 
III. Senator Mumn offered the profound ob-
servation that there is a developing uncer-
tainty among the American people "about 
what thLs is all about." (Little wonder, if 
the people have been listening to the sena-
torial critics.) 
One theme which runs through the criti-
cism is that Congress, when it approved in 
1964 a joint resolution supporting the Presi-
dent's policies, did net quite realize what 
it was all about, didn't quite intend to au-
thorize the President to do precisely what 
he now is doing. Yet the language of the 
resolution is unambiguous. It puts Con-
gress squarely on record as authorizing the 
President, as he may determine, "to take 
all necessary steps, including the use of 
armed force," to assist South Vietnam in 
defense of its freedom. Pretty hard to 
wriggle out of an endorsement like that, 
Senator MORSE was one of two Members of 
Congress who voted against the resolution.

ether facilities. They also assisted local 
interests by furniehing men, material, and 
equipment as necessary to make emergency 
repairs to damaged lucid levees in the vicinity 
4.1 New Orleans and areas to the south. 
cerps at Engineer crews also reinforced local 
ni,terest levees elsewhere with sandbags so 
a to provide immediate interim protection 
lend in one area coostructed a 420-foot 
emergency levee sei hack opposite a damaged 
ftWal levee. 
'The same hurricane-induced tidal surges 
tat wreaked havoc on the land mass of 
eeatheast Louisiana also exacted a heavy 
irom the marine industry. Many ves-
sels, ranging from email lishing boats and 
pleasure craft to oceangoing vessels, were 
tern from tneir moorings and sunk. Some 
176 others were grounded on the banks and 
levees of the Mississippi River by the rise 
end fall of the Meal surges. Following the 
passage of Hurricane Betsy, the Corps of 
Engineers began it detailed survey of 
channels iii lie interest of determin-
ate obstructions to navigation and delineat-
ing clear channels. This work was rapidly 
end effectively accomplished and marine 
traffic quickly began moving safely out of 
-Lnd into the ports of New Orleans and Baton 
isouge. Investigations into the ownership 
ei grounded vessels were conducted and 142 
of these vessels have been removed by their 
owners under the direction of the Corps of 
Engineers. 
The marine lose of barge MTC-602 in the 
Mississippi River at Baton Rouge, Lan pre-
:tented the most serious potential of any 
No. 17---15 
ri-,1,411rNI, 
marine loss resulting from Betsy. This 
barge, loaded with 600 tons of fiqudel chlo-
rine, had been moored in Baton Rouge prior 
to the hurricane. On September 11 this 
barge was reported loot and presumably 
sunk. The Corps of Engineers immediately 
established an emergency operations center 
in the area to begin a search for the barge. 
The 4th Army, Navy, and Coast Guard were 
also engaged in the operation. The Office of 
Emergency Planning subsequently directed 
the Corps of Engineers to coordinate search 
efforts for the barge and remove it when 
located as a hazard to public safety. Some 
16 submerged objects were located and 
buoyed during the search. On September 
16 a Corps of Engineers survey boat, on 
which was mounted a Honeywell precision 
profiling sonar system, loaned to the United 
States by the Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., of 
Houston, located MTC-502 lying sunk in 60 
feet of water. 
The corps immediately undertedk a de-
tailed survey of the barge, utilizieg divers 
and underwater survey equipment. Its ex-
act positioning and condition were deter-
mined. Simultaneously, a study was made 
into the construction features, strength, and 
condition of the barge. Utilizing the in-
formation gained from the surveys and 
study, the corps negotiated a contract for 
removal of the barge. Plans of the, contrac-
tor were reviewed in detail. Following ap-
proval by the corps, work preliminary ei 
actual lifting operations was begun under 
corps supervision. This necessarily slow and 
detailed. work was completed on November 
11. AL 8 am? on November 12 lifting 
operations were started. Within 2 hours the 
barge broke the surface of the water. The 
mission had been carried out by the Corp; 
of Engineers without flaw. The fear and 
anxiety which had gripped the populace of 
Baton Rouge, La., and much of the Nation 
disappeared with this accomplishment. 
Over the years the Corps of Engineers has 
constructed levees and flood control atm 
tures in the lower Mississippi Valley to pre-
tect the area from devastating floods. That 
these flood control structures were well and 
properly constructed is now well established. 
Despite being overtopped by Betsy's tidal 
surges and having vessels, houses and other 
debris cast upon them, the levees held. 
Many of them, however, were seriously dam-
aged. Along with other emergency work, the 
corps has undertaken rapid restoration of !.11 
Federal levees so as to provide fule protectien 
in the event of a coming high water. Addi-
tionally, the Corps of Engineers has and is 
busily engaged in restoring locally con-
structed levees to their prehurricane coali-
tion so as to protect from flooding from I tie 
rear. 
Throughout hurricane Betsy operatinos 
the Corps of Engineers has devoted Maxi-
mum effort toward assisting, roordinatieg 
and cooperating with local, parish, State and 
Federal agencies and the public at large. At 
the same time every effort has been toward 
protecting the best interests of the United 
States. 
POINTERS ON MORTGAGE POINTS--
BANKS PROFIT FROM FED'S 
TIGHT MORTGAGE MONEY MAR-
KET 
(Mr. PATMAN (at the request of 1),Tr. 
EDWARDS of Louisiana) was granted 
permission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the Reie011111 and to .include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Speaker, the Fed-
eral Reserve action last December, rais-
ing the discount rate and mgulation Q, 
has been defended as a tool for restrain-
ing inflation. As the months go by, this 
uncalled for action is proving to be a 
heavy burden for the individual taxpayer 
and citizen. 
Last December, Mr. Speaker, I warned 
of the dire effects that would result from 
the Fed's action in forcing a rise in in-
terest rates. Saturday's Washington 
Post has an interesting article pointing 
out the ensuing hardships that higher 
interest rates have forced upon the new 
homeowner. 
Since the money market is SO very 
tight, due to the Federal Reserve actions, 
mortgage loans are more costly. As we 
can see from this article, even the fixed 
FHA and VA mortgages do not remain 
'fixed, but are subject to "points" or dis-
counts. Lenders, banks, savings institu-
tions, and insurance companies, offer less 
than the 100 percent for these FHA and 
VA mortgages meaning that the home-
owner must pay more for his mortgage, 
even if the rates are guaranteed stable 
by the FHA and VA. 
Legally, these two agencies cannot pay 
these points or discounts on mortgages. 
so that it must be passed on to the home-
owner or seller. The penalty has been 
passed to those who can least afford to 
pay. 
Instead of halting inflation, the Fed 
has hit the small homeowner with a 
stinging penalty and offered the banks 
an opportunity to get richer. Again we 
see the Fed's efforts are directed more 
to help the moneylending banks than. 
to help the homeowning public. 
The article follows: 
[From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Jan. 29, 
19661 
POINTERS ON MORTGAGED "POINTS'. 
(By Bernard C. Meltzer) 
Recently, the Federal Reserve Bank :raised 
the bank discount rate by one-half of 1 per-
cent. Overnight, property owners then found 
themselves required to pay extra sums iii 
points or discounts when they sold. Many 
have written asking for an explanation of 
this development in real estate. 
"Dear Mr, Meltzer: The constant topic 
in the monthly meetings of our civic group 
used to be taxes and schools. Now it's pole is 
and discounts on mortgages. One property 
owner told. of being charged 5 percent or 
$1,000 on a $20,000 mortgage obtained by the 
buyer. 
"This is something new. We would like 
to know what suddenly has brought about 
this situation. Second, would you please es-
plain why banks and real estate brokers all 
of a sudden have decided to get rich at tee 
expense of property owners? 
"AsKugc." 
Answer. A property owner will not sell Ms 
house for $15,000 if similar houses in the 
area are bringing $20,000. A bank, likewise, 
will not sell its money (mortgages) at 5,", 
percent when the market rate is 53,,e percent. 
The recent action of the Federal Reserve 
bank raising discount rates by one-half per-
cent has suddenly caused a change in mort-
gage interest rates and emphasized the phe-
nomena of points and discounts. 
FHA and VA mortgages have fixed interest 
rates (now 51/4 percent). If the money mar-
ket rate is higher than the F1-1A, or VA 
fixed rate, lenders offer less than 100 for 
these mortgages or buy at a discount. A 5 
percent discount (or 5 points) means lhat 
mortgage lenders pay $9,500 for a $10,000 
mortgage. In this way the market rate ad-
justs to the fixed rate of the FHA or VA, 
mortgage.

So he at least is entitled to be heard as he 
protests now. The Oregon Senator has been 
intemperate, even savage, in his criticism of 
the President. But he is also the only one 
to come forward with a proposal which goes 
beyond mere handwringing. The 1964 res-
olution provides that Congress may termi-
nate it by another joint resolution, and Sen-
ator MORSE urges that this be done. 
Perhaps this should be brought to a test. 
Let us find out how many Members of Con-
gress, in the face of Ho Chi Minh's adamant 
refusal to discuss peace except on his own 
terms, would vote to rescind the authority 
previously given the President. Let us find 
out what those who might vote for revoca-
tion propose to do about the war, about the 
200,000 American troops who are fighting the 
battle, and whether they intend to welsh on 
our Nation's commitment to a free choice 
for South Vietnam. 
Our guess is that such a resolution could 
not muster a corporal's guard in Congress. 
If this is so, there should be an end to aim-
less speeches and protests which serve no 
better purpose than to undermine the Presi-
dent and to encourage the enemy. 
THE ALLIANCE FOR PROGRESS 
(Mr. BRADEMAS (at the request of 
Mr. EDWARDS of Louisiana) was granted 
Permission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. BRADEMAS. Mr. Speaker, Presi-
dent Johnson's foreign aid message this 
week emphasizes the obvious need for an 
increased foreign aid program in Viet-
nam. But the President also points out 
that we cannot let Vietnam obscure from 
our vision other programs of equal im-
portance elsewhere in the world. 
Among those other programs is the 
Alliance for Progress with our friends 
in Latin America. 
The President's request for funds for 
the Alliance in fiscal year 1967 is $543 
million. This is some $13 million more 
than was appropriated for fiscal 1966. It 
represents one of the best investments 
the United States can make today. 
For through the Alliance for Progress 
we have given notice that we will fight 
the hunger and illiteracy, the disease and 
deprivation, which are the conditions of 
life for so many in this half of the world. 
We have linked our own energies and 
resources to the aspirations and determi-
nation of the men and women in Latin 
America who are striving to bring better 
lives to their people and to maintain 
peace in this hemisphere. By lending a 
further hand to peaceful development, 
we weaken those who, like Castro in 
Cuba, would turn legitimate demand for 
change into violent upheaval. 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS 
The Alliance stands for economic and 
social progress?for the dignity of man. 
This Alliance is little more than 4 years 
old. In that time: 300,000 new houses 
have been built or are under construc-
tion; 9,000 miles of road have been built, 
expanded or improved; 10 million new 
school books have been provided; 13 mil-
lion schoolchildren now participate in 
school lunch programs, with 12 million 
adults benefiting from regular food 
shipments; hundreds of thousands of 
Latin Americans can now find relief from 
suffering in 850 hospitals, health centers 
and mobile medical units added under 
the Alliance; more than 100 million peo-
ple are now protected against malaria. 
SCHOOL AND HOUSES 
In some nations, more schools or houses 
have been built since the Alliance began, 
just over 4 years ago, than were built in 
the past 200 or 300 years. Cooperatives 
and loan associations are enabling bor-
rowers, for the first time, to obtain credit 
or capital at reasonable rates. In many 
areas, children are not receiving better 
textbooks: they are receiving their first 
books of any kind. 
LATIN AMERICANS HELP THEMSELVES 
What have the Latin Americans, in 
those 4 years, done to help themselves? 
All of the 19 Latin American nations 
have improved their administration of 
taxes, and 14 of them have produced 
major tax reforms. 
Fourteen countries have instituted 
or speeded up land reforms. 
Fifteen countries have established self-
help housing programs. 
Nine countries have enacted laws fa-
voring growth of savings and loan asso-
ciations. 
Eight countries have new private and 
public development banks. 
In the past 3 years, the Latin Amer-
ican nations have allocated about $8 bil-
lion of their own resources each year to 
development programs, and this amount 
is expected to reach $12 billion shortly. 
They have increased education bud-
gets by 13 percent. 
A 5-nation bloc in Central America has 
established a common market which has 
made dramatic economic progress, ex-
periencing economic growth at the high 
rate of 7 percent per year. 
These changes did not just happen. 
They came about because men of vision 
and practicality instituted them, both 
here and in our neighboring nations to 
the south. 
Bbt, Mr. Speaker, I do not want to 
paint an easy or rosy picture, for there 
is still an immense amount to be done if 
the peoples of Latin America are to con-
tine to make progress. The way ahead 
will not be easy and it will not be without 
difficulties and failures. 
Yet it is clear this joint effort must go 
on. And to continue this effort toward 
the development of a strong, peaceful, 
free, and democratic hemisphere, I be-
lieve that we in Congress must lend our 
support to the request which the Presi-
dent has made for adequate funds for the 
Alliance for Progress. 
We are no longer faced with the ques-
tion of whether the Alliance will work or 
not. It is working. Our task now is to 
continue it, to strengthen it, and to move 
with its gathering momentum. 
THE INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
ACT OF 1966 
(Mr. BRADEMAS (at the request of 
Mr. EDWARDS of Louisiana) was granted 
permission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. BRADEMAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce the International 
Education Act of lass. 
11 
0400020010-5 1765 
During the 88th and 89th Congresses, 
we have immensely strengthened this 
country's commitment to the enterprise 
of education. 
Yet as President Johnson said in his 
message to Congress today in connection 
with the International Education and 
Health Acts of 1966: 
We would be shortsighted to confine our 
vision to this Nation's shorelines. The same 
rewards we count at home will flow from 
sharing in a worldwide effort to rid man-
kind of the slavery of ignorance and scourge 
of disease. 
In his message, President Johnson 
indicated his strong support of four ma-
jor purposes in international education: 
1. To strengthen our capacity for inter-
national cooperation in the field of educa-
tion. 
2. To encourage exchanges with students 
and teachers of other countries. 
3. To lend support to education in the 
developing lands. 
4. To construct new bridges of interna-
tional understanding. 
Mr. Speaker, the President is propos-
ing a series of measures to achieve these 
several purposes. The legislation I am 
today introducing is aimed at only two 
specific objectives: First, supporting pro-
grams of international scope in smaller 
and developing countries; and second. 
strengthening centers of special compe-
tence in international research and 
training. 
Mr. Speaker, like a number of my col-
leagues, I have had the good fortune to 
visit many schools, colleges, and univer-
sities here in our own country as well as 
abroad?in Buenoi Aires and Berlin, 
Moscow and Djakarta, Oxford and 
Warsaw. 
In 1961 as a member of the House 
Committee on Education and Labor, I 
went with my distinguished colleague, 
the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. 
Gimmo], to Argentina for the purpose of 
studying the contributions which Latin 
American universities could make to the 
Alliance for Progress, and on our return 
we published a report with a number of 
recommendations for U.S. aid policy to 
higher education in Latin America. 
During the same year, along with sev-
eral other colleagues, led by the distin-
guished gentlewoman from Oregon [Mrs. 
GREEN], I had the valuable experience of 
visiting schools, colleges, and technical 
institutes in the Soviet Union. 
In 1963, together with my distin-
guished colleague from Connecticut [Mr. 
DADDARIO], I was a delegate to the Asian-
American Assembly on Cultural Affairs 
and International Understanding at 
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
These and similar experiences which 
I know other Members of this House have 
had cannot fail to impress all of us with 
the increasing significance of education 
in international affairs. 
Section 3 of the International Educa-
tion Act of 1966 authorizes grants to col-
leges and universities for the establish-
ment, strengthening, and operation by 
them of graduate centers which will be 
national and international resources for 
research and training in international 
studies.

Approved F7Alatsfsff8r1L2WiEMD_P6TIBM1t6R000400020010-5 
1766 February 2, 1966 
In addition to the centers for advanced 
international studies authorized by sec-
tion 3, this legislation, in section 4, pro-
vides for grants to strengthen under-
graduate programs in international 
studies. For example, such grants could 
be used to support faculty planning in 
undergraduate international studies, 
training faculty members in foreign 
countries, student work-study-travel 
programs, and programs of visiting for-
eign scholars. 
Mr. Speaker, in May 1961, before 
assuming his present position, President 
Johnson succinctly expressed the cause 
he is urging that we serve in the Inter-
national Education Act. He said: "Arms 
can never make us invulnerable nor our 
armies invincible, but the support we 
give to education can make freedom 
irresistible." 
Mr. Speaker, I hope this measure will 
receive the full and careful consideration 
of this House and of the Senate and that 
it will be enacted into law. 
Mr. Speaker, I include at this point in 
the RECORD the text of the International 
Education Act of 1966: 
R. 12452 
A bill to provide for the strengthening of 
American educational resources for inter-
national studies and research 
Be it enacted by the Senate and the House 
of Representatives of the United States of 
America in Congress assembled, That this 
Act may be cited as the "International Edu-
cation Act of 1966". 
FINDINGS AND DECLARATION 
Sec. 2. The Congress hereby finds and de-
elares that a knowledge of other countries is 
of the utmost importance in promoting mu-
tual understanding and cooperation between 
dations; that strong American educational 
resources are a necessary base for strengthen-
mg our relations with other countries; that 
this and future generations of Americans 
should be assured ample opportunity to de-
velop to the fullest extent possible their 
intellectual capacities in all areas of knowl-
edge pertaining to other countries, peoples, 
and cultures; and that it is therefore both 
necessary and appropriate for the Federal 
Government to assist in the development of 
resources for international study and re-
search and to assist the progress of education 
m developing nations, in order to meet the 
eequirements of world leadership. 
,-!ENTERS FOR ADVANCED INTERNATIONAL STUDIES

THE PRESIDENT'S INTERNATIONAL 
EDUCATION PROPOSALS PRAISED 
BY CHAIRMAN POWELL 
(Mr. POWELL (at the request of Mr. 
EDWARDS of Louisiana) was granted per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. POWELL. Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
warmly commend President Johnson for 
offering today one of the greatest con-
tributions to international understand-
ing in the history of this country. 
The President's legislative proposals 
are a Magna Carta of international edu-
cation which reaffirm man's right to 
knowledge and the free use thereof. 
Not only do these recommendations 
significantly widen America's responsi-
bilities and commitments to the free 
world, but they help to harness the intel-
lectual resources of all nations in the 
global fight against ignorance and 
illiteracy. 
That our country will join in this his-
toric international educational partner-
ship to exchange ideas, techniques, and 
materials is a happy reminder that 
knowledge knows no national boundaries. 
The exciting diversity of the Presi-
dent's proposals all merit serious consid-
eration. Together, all of these proposals 
will provide the needed stimulus to im-

February 2f?ripolyed For RelcmdffifggfityNAcIfiffe#1310_4#513440400020010-5 
A further thrust of the legislation in 
this area has been the recognition of the 
need for grant assistance for the smaller 
communities of the country?those hav-
ing a population of less than 125,000. To 
meet this need, dollar limitations were 
imposed on the Federal grants and a por-
tion of the appropriated funds was set 
aside for the smaller communities, where 
smaller project costs are involved. In 
these ways, the relatively limited annual 
appropriation is assured of being more 
equally distributed between large and 
small communities and projects. 
The amendments I am proposing in 
legislation today are consistent with the 
spirit and intent of the prior legislation, 
while, I believe, offering the much-
needed incentive formula for the States 
to meet their responsibilities. 
The Water Quality Act of 1965, Public 
Law 89-234, amended the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act and provides the 
following program of grant assistance for 
the construction of treatment works: 
First, a grant is limited to 3 per-
cent of the estimated reasonable cost 
of the project with a dollar limitation on 
the grant of $1,200,000, for an individual 
project, and $4,800,000, for a joint proj-
ect in which two or more municipalities 
join. 
Second, the dollar limitations imposed 
shall not apply in the case of grants 
made from appropriated funds in excess 
of $100 million?the current authoriza-
tion is $150 million?if the State agrees 
to match equally all grants made from 
this allocation for projects in the State. 
Third, in addition, the Secretary of 
Health, Education, and Welfare may in-
crease the amount of a grant project cer-
tified by designated bodies as being in 
conformity with a comprehensive plan 
for the municipality. 
My amendment would make the fol-' 
lowing changes: 
First, if a community is eligible for a 
full 30 percent Federal grant with-
out any State machinery, the Secretary 
may increase the amount of the Federal 
grant by up to an additional 30 percent, 
provided that the State match any addi-
tional amount, dollar for dollar. 
Second, if there has been State match-
ing of the initial 30 percent Federal 
grant, the Secretary may increase the 
amount of the Federal grant by up to an 
additional 15 percent, provided that the 
State also match the additional amount, 
dollar for dollar. 
My amendment would increase the 
Federal share in the cost of construction 
of local community pollution control fa-
cilities, but only to the extent that the 
States themselves are willing to par-
ticipate. 
Under present-law, a community must 
shoulder between 37 and 67 percent of the 
total cost of such projects, depending on 
which section of the act applies. My 
amendment would reduce these amounts 
to 4 and 5.5 percent, respectively, pro-
vided the States went along to the extent 
provided in the amendment. 
Maximum Federal share under each 
phase would be increased from the pres-
ent limits of 33 percent under both phases 
to 66 and 49.5 percent, respectively. 
State participation would be required for 
an increased Federal share, of course. 
Under the present law, no requirement 
exists for State participation under the 
provision covering small community 
projects, and only 30 percent for projects 
over the dollar limitation. My amend-
ment would encourage a State share of 
up to 30 percent under the former pro-
vision and up to 45 percent under the 
latter. 
I invite all of my colleagues to read and 
analyze the bills I introduce today. I feel 
they offer the most responsive and mean-
ingful proposal so far for the kind of 
assistance and stimulation which will 
bring results where they are most needed, 
at the local community level. 
I might point out in conclusion, that 
these bills are the result of a long and 
exhaustive study of the problem and of 
the solutions put forth to date. I wel-
come the opportunity to discuss them in 
more detail with the distinguished Mem-
bers of this body. 
It is my hope that they will be acted on 
as swiftly as possible in order to generate 
the necessary action in our States and 
communities. 
PARTIAL PAYMENT OF "PRINCIPLE" 
TO THOSE WHO RISK THEIR 
LIVES IN OUR INTEREST 
(Mr. WOLFF (at the request of Mr. ED-
WARDS of Louisiana) was granted per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and to include ex-
. traneous matter.) 
Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Speaker, this body 
has seen numerous bills over the years 
to partially repay, through educational 
benefits, our fighting men for the time 
lost to their careers by military service. 
Today I am intro"ducing a bill in sup-
port of that placed before this distin-
guished body on January 31 by my 
friend, the gentleman from Texas, [Mr. 
TEAGUE]. 
The Congress has seen numerous bills 
over the years to partially repay, through 
educational benefits, our fighting men 
for the time lost to their careers by mili-
tary service. 
Some legislation has proposed that 
such benefits be limited to those who 
actually served in areas of special haz-
ard. Others prescribed specific time 
periods for eligibility. There has been 
opposition to every proposal. 
Now Congressman TEAGUE has intro-
duced legislation that would go all the 
way back to where the Korean GI bill 
was arbitrarily cut off on January 31, 
1955. This bill provides benefits that are 
surely not incommensurate with what 
our servicemen have done for us. This 
bill is the product of much thought and 
accommodation of divergent views. I 
believe it is a good bill, and I believe it 
is high time our Nation began meeting 
its responsibilities to those we ask to give 
up to and including their lives for our 
national purposes. 
Mr. Speaker, as I have noted before in 
this House, we in Congress must meet our 
responsibilities to our returning veterans 
as earlier Congresses have done. The 
Veterans' Readjustment Benefits Act is a 
1761 
partial payment at principle to those 
who risk t ' s in our interest. 
THE PRESIDENT'S FATEFUL 
DECISION 
(Mr. BOGGS (at the request of Mr. 
EDwAttris of Louisiana) was granted per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. BOGGS. Mr. Speaker, one man 
alone, the President of the United 
States, knows the deep agony and an-
guish that lay behind the fateful deci-
sion on Monday last to resume the bomb-
ing of Communist military targets in 
North Vietnam. 
Yet all of us here, and I believe all 
Americans, know the significance of this 
decision for the future course of our 
Nation. The President has done what 
had to be done. He has done what had 
to be done because of the intransigence 
of the enemy we face. He has done what 
had to be done if we were to learn from 
the lessons of history. 
Yesterday there appeared in New 
York's Journal American, and in all the 
Hearst newspapers across the country, 
an outstanding editorial which pointed 
out that we could not permit the enemy 
the privilege of a sanctuary from which 
to attack the defenders of freedom. 
In pointed eloquence this editorial de-
clared: 
The wagers of aggressive war in North Viet-
nam must know that the wellsprings of their 
policies are as much a target as the streams 
they produce. 
This is an editorial which expresses 
the sentiments I hold, and sentiments I 
feel are shared by many Members of 
this House. I ask permission for it to be 
inserted in the RECORD where all may 
read it: 
[From the New York (N.Y.) Journal-Amer-
can, Feb. 1, 1968] 
The decision to resume the bombing of 
North Vietnam was made to a very high 
degree in Hanoi and Peiping as in Washing-
ton. The leaders in both Communist capitals 
are aware that even the slightest response 
on their part to President Johnson's pro-
digious peace efforts since Christmas could 
have stayed the onslaught that now ranges 
the skies of North Vietnam. 
But no such response was forthcoming, and 
indeed no sign was given that the premedi-
tated aggression in South Vietnam had abated 
or would abate. The aggressors in short, 
threw down the challenging gauntlet to the 
United States sworn to defend South Viet-
nam's freedom, and this Nation had no 
option but to pick it up. 
The acceptance of this challenge moreover 
is motivated by the intransigence of Ho Chi 
Minh and Mao Tse-tung. It is motivated by 
history?when a similar decision was faced 
by the United States in the bitter and costlier 
Korean war. During that conflict there came 
a time when our enemies took full advantage 
of a sanctuary?north of the Yalu River?
which we ourselves had proclaimed, to pursue 
their aggresion and to peril great numbers of 
American troops. 
Indeed it is now a fact of history that the 
Red Chinese Army Command of that day ad-
mitted that it never would have advanced 
south into Korea had it not been certain that 
its bases in the north would remain immune 
from American attack. These bases did re-
main immune and the result is known to

history. The lesson is clear. There can be no 
sanctuary for aggressors. No one must be 
permitted to conduct such operations with 
impunity again. Thus the wagers of aggres-
aive wax in North Vietnam must know that 
the wellsprings of their policies are as much 
a target as the streams; they produce. 
But the way out is still open for those who 
have brought down such punishment on their 
heads. The Johnson administration, has for 
example, endorsed the proposal by Pope 
;Saul VI for arbitration of the Vietnam prob-
tem by neutral nations. In addition, the 
United States has called for a full-scale 
United Nations Security Council debate on 
the matter. We seek, in short, to talk and 
parlay even as the bombers fly. 
But it takes two to talk. 
ItEPORT OF EXTENSIVE ACTIVITIES 
FOLLOWING THE DEVASTATION 
WROUGHT BY HURRICANE BETSY 
(Mr. BOGGS (at the request of Mr. 
ED WARDS of Louisiana) was granted per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. BOGGS. Mr. Speaker, the deva-
station wrought by Hurricane Betsy to 
south Louisiana last September was 
tremendous, as every Member of this 
douse knows. Death and destruction 
were left in its wake, but not for long. 
The various agencies of the National 
Oovernment, working with the State and 
parish governments, and coupled with 
the herculean determination and efforts 
of the people of Louisiana, restored the 
communities of south Louisiana more 
rapidly than anyone thought possible. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 
directed by Col, Thomas J. Bowen, the 
corps' district engineer stationed in 
New Orleans, did a magnificent job 
above and beyond the call of duty to as-
sist the people of New Orleans and the 
ilurrounciing parishes in returning their 
communities to normal operations. The 
army Engineers worked around the clock 
l'or days and days following the hurri-
cane, which swept through southeast 
Louisiana on the night of September 9-
10. 
The Engineers surveyed damages; they 
evacuated hundreds of stranded, and 
temporarily homeless citizens; they pro-
vided emergency power in stricken areas; 
ihey pumped out the high waters in 
many areas; they contracted for the 
clearance of debris, and more than 
223,800 truckloads of debris were cleared 
away under the direction of the corps; 
they surveyed all waterway channels to 
determine whether there were obstruc-
tions to passage; they - restored those 
Federal levees under their purview, and 
lelped to restore and strengthen those 
levees built by other governing bodies. 
All in all, the Army Corps of Engineers 
performed many difficult tasks in an ex-
emplary manner, and I am happy and 
proud to salute all the engineers and 
Colonel Bowen for their service to the 
people of New Orleans and the State of 
Under the Federal Disaster Act. as 
mended, the Corps of Engineers are di-
"noted to survey damages; perform debris 
clearance; provide protective measures 
or other emergency assignments, and in-
spect completed disaster projects. 
,,.q.,,,q,""vrqsvmirrsralmava,a ? -a. 
Following Hurricane Betsy, Mr. 
Speaker, the Army Engineers did all 
arid much more, and I am pleased to 
commend them for a job well done. The 
Carps of Engineers has long, served the 
people of the United States faithfully 
arid well in peace and in war; and their 
employees, both military and civilian, are 
deserving of the highest tributes from 
their fellow citizens. 
The New Orleans District of the Army 
Engineers has provided me with a full 
report of their extensive activities, be-
fore, during, and after Hurricane Betsy 
and I would like to commend this report 
to my fellow colleagues in the House and 
the Senate. The detailed report follows: 
ilURRICANE BETSY ACTIVITIES, NEW ORLEANS 
DISTRICT, CORPS OF ENGINEERS 
in the early evening of August 26, 1905, a 
tropical depression was located in the South 
Atlantic Ocean 675 miles east northeast of 
Trinidad. By the following evening this de-
pression had spawned a full blown hurriaane 
destined to be remembered as "Betsy"? -one 
of the most destructive storms of record. 
With the inception of the hurricane the 
New Orleans District, with other gulf and 
Atlantic coast Districts of the Army's Corps 
of Engineers, began plotting the path of the 
storm from weather bureau advisories. Long 
established emergency operations plans and 
the availability of assigned corps personnel 
were verified. The period of watching and 
waiting for where and when had begun. 
Members of the corps plotted Betsy's,nth 
as she moved westward, then northwestward, 
over the Windward and Leeward Islands, 
then north to the east of Puerto Rico, Shen 
again northwestward, aimed ;it the Virginia 
coastline and the city of Washington, D.C. 
Suddenly, during the night of August 30, 
while some 350 miles north of Puerto Moo, 
Betsy buttonhooked and headed south, then. 
west, then northwest in the direction of the 
Carolinas. The populace of the gulf coast 
heaved a sight of relief. The sigh was pre-
mature for, during the night of September 4 
while some 325 miles east of Daytona Beach, 
Fla., Betsy again button.hooked, headed 
south, then southwest, then west toward the 
southern tip of Florida. On September 7 
Corps of Engineer personnel in the New Or-
leans District were alerted for possible ener-
gency action. During the morning of Sep-
tember 8 the hurricane roared across the 
Florida Keys and into the Gulf of Medco. 
Here she continued a generally westward 
course for approximately 24 hours and then 
on September 9 veered to the northwest and 
toward the Louisiana coastline. 
On the morning of September 9, Col. 
Thomas J. Bowen, the corps district engi-
neer in New Orleans, directed precautionary 
action throughout the threatened portions 
of his 47?000-scmare-mile district so as to 
protect Government installations, property 
and personnel A preplanned emergency op-
erations center was activated on a 24-hour 
basis in the New Orleans office. The un-
usually high forward speed of the hurri sane 
and its erratic course limited the time a sail-
able for prestorrn activities to hours rather 
than days. Regardless, by Thursday sight. 
September 9, all possible precautionary and 
protective measures had been taken and a 
continuous radio liaison with district in-
stallations established. The Corps of Engi-
neers was ready. 
In the early evening of September 9. the 
eye of Hurricane Betsy moved across the 
Louisiana coast just west of Grand Isle. 
Winds in excess of 160 m.p.h. were :recorded. 
These winds, damaging enough by them-
selves, induced tidal surges up to 16 feet 
above mean sea level. These surges moved. 
across the low-lying marshes to the east and 
north of the Mississippi River below New 
Orleans and overtopped main line levees on 
both sides of the river in the lower parts of 
St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes. Back 
levees built by local agencies for reclamation 
and protection against tidal flooding were 
overtopped and breached in numerous places. 
Severe flooding occurred in portions of 
Orleans, St. Bernard, and Plaquemine& Par-
ishes. All In all, some 4,800 square miles 
were inundated. Transportation, communi-
cation, and utilities services were severely 
disrupted. The known dead count even-
tually reached 81 in number. 
Fortunately, advance warning by the 
Weather Bureau had enabled thousands of 
people to flee their homes before the hurri-
cane winds and waters struck. Many others 
were not so fortunate. Rapidly rising water 
trapped them in their homes, on roofs, on 
tops of cars, and anything else above the flood 
level. Evacuation by boat was their only 
salvation. Early on Friday, September 10, 
Corps of Engineer personnel and boats were 
ordered into the stricken area to join others 
in rescue operations. These were the first 
personnel from any Government agency to 
participate in this operation. By nightfall, 
over 1,200 persons had been rescued by the 
corps. 
Also, early on the morning of September 
10, Corps of Engineer employees of the 
New Orleans District, despite the fact that 
many of them had suffered severe damage 
themselves, came through water, wind, rain, 
fallen power lines and debris to report for 
work and emergency assignments. A pre-
planned disaster recovery center was acti-
vated and a well trained, highly capable, ef-
ficient organization of dedicated people 
swung into action. In anticipation of things 
to come, plans were initiated to send dam-
age reconnaissance teams into the 35 
Louisiana parishes laid waste by Betsy. Ap-
proximately 500 New Orleans District per-
sonnel were assigned to disaster work. Due 
to the extensiveness of the damaged area 
and the multiplicity of tasks that would 
have to be performed, this was not enough. 
A call for assista,nse from other corps in-
stallations throughout the country went out 
through corps channels. In a comparatively 
short period some 240 employees came pour-
ing in--ready, willing and able to work. 
They came from Seattle and Baltimore, 
Vicksburg, Memphis and St. Louis, San 
Francisco and Jacksonville, Huntington and 
Los Angeles, Galveston and Kansas City and 
points in between. Every corps division in 
the continental United States responded 
well and rapidly. 
In the cloning of September 10, the Presi-
dent of the United States, with members of 
the Louisiana congressional delegation and 
officials of pertinent Federal agencies, flew 
into New Orleans to survey hurricane dam-
ages. The President promptly declared 
Louisiana a major natural disaster area and 
pledged all possible Federal assistance. The 
Office of Emergency Planning was directed 
to coordinate the relief and rehabilitation 
activites of all Federal agencies. As had 
been done on previous occasions, the Office 
of Emergency Planning assigned the major 
part of the rehabilitation work to the Corps 
of Engineers. 
Already 35 Corps of Engineers assista nee 
teams, each headed by a fully qualified engi-
neer, had fanned out into Louisana's dam-
aged parishes. 'Their job was to survey 
damages and to determine the extent anol 
type of rehabilitation work necessary, to ad-
vise local officials of Office of Emergency Plan-
ning's authority and procedures under Public 
Law 875, to supervise Corps of Engineers' 
emergency work in their respective areas, to 
give technical advice to local interests and 
to do all else necessary to render assistance 
and hasten a return to normalcy. 
In the hours following the hurricane, the 
Corps of Engineers alerted the construsnion 
industry for mobilization of all possible

and technology and the information ex-
plosion?is one in which specialized 
knowledge is crucial to decisiorunaking. 
Legislators responsible to the people must 
have that knowledge and be able to apply 
that knowledge for the benefit of the 
people. 
The requirements for our profession 
have been upgraded through the years?
in response to the new problems and 
new opportunities rising from those 
years. The arguments earlier advanced 
in favor of a 2- or 3-year term for Mem-
bers of the House of Representatives have 
been strengthened with the passing of 
each and every year. The arguments 
have never been stronger than they are 
for a 4-year term today. 
The lessons of our constitutional be-
ginnings are relevant in a second respect. 
At the Constitutional Convention, 
Hamilton shrewdly observed that "Fre-
quency of elections tended to make the 
people listless to them." But today there 
are probably more elections occurring at 
more frequent intervals in the United 
States than in any nation on earth. The 
people do not insist on this great flood?
many in fact find it wasteful, confusing, 
or irritating. A recent Gallup poll con-
firms that a substantial majority of 
Americans, regardless of political affil-
iation, favor changing the terms of 
Members of the House of Representatives 
from 2 to 4 years. The people are al-
ready what we must become?sensible 
people. They want Members to spend 
less time campaigning for reelection, and 
more time concentrating upon the peo-
ple's problems and meeting the people's 
needs. 
We can start now. The time is now. 
The 2-year term for Members of the 
House is, in my opinion, an anachronism. 
It should be abolished for reasons the 
President and the people have given us?
good, strong, sensible reasons that are 
even more compelling today than they 
were 175 years ago. 
RESUMPTION OF BOMBING 
NORTH VIETNAM 
Mr. McINTYRE. Mr. President, in all 
that has been written and said since the 
resumption of air strikes in North Viet-
nam, no explanation has been more logi-
cal or more compelling than the one ad-
vanced by the New York Journal 
American of February 1. 
In a strong editorial, that paper put 
into words what we all know: "The de-
cision to resume the bombing of North 
Vietnam was made, to a very high de-
gree, as much in Hanoi and Peiping as it 
was in Washington." 
I submit that in the light of a complete 
lack of cooperative response from the 
other side, President Johnson could have 
made no other decision. 
I also submit that the record is open 
for all to see, and I think the Journal 
American summed it up very well when 
it said: 
The leaders in both Conununist capitals 
are aware that even the slightest response 
on their part to President Johnson's prodi-
gious peace efforts since Christmas could 
have stayed the mighty onslaught of power 
that now ranges the skies of North Vietnam. 
The President made his difficult de-
cision, as the editorial declared, because 
"no such response was forthcoming, and 
indeed no sign was given that the pre-
meditated aggression in South Vietnam 
had abated or would abate. The aggres-
sors, in short, threw down the challeng-
ing gauntlet to the United States, sworn 
to defend South Vietnam's freedom, and 
this Nation had no option but to pick 
it up." 
This editorial adds substantially to 
what the world knows. I believe that my 
colleagues will want to study its logic 
and I therefore offer it for inclusion in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE BOMBERS TALK 
The decision to resume the bombing of 
North Vietnam was made, to a very high 
degree, as much in Hanoi and Peiping as it 
was in Washington. The leaders in both 
Communist capitals are aware that even the 
slightest response on their part to President 
Johnson's prodigious peace efforts since 
Christmas could have stayed the mighty on-
slaught of power that now ranges the skies 
of North Vietnam. 
But no such response was forthcoming, 
and indeed no sign was given that the pre-
meditated aggression in South Vietnam had 
abated or would abate. The aggressors, in 
short, threw down the challenging gauntlet 
to the United States, sworn to defend South 
Vietnam's freedom and this Nation had no 
option but to pick it up. 
The acceptance of this challenge, more-
over, is motivated by more than the intransi-
gence of Ho Chi Minh and Mao Tse-tung. 
It is motivated by history, when a similar 
decision was faced by the United States in 
the bitter and much more costly Korean 
war. During that conflict there came a 
time when our enemies took full advantage 
of a sanctuary?north of the Yalu River?
which we ourselves had proclaimed, to pur-
sue their aggressions and to peril great num-
bers of American troops.. 
Indeed it is now a fact of history that 
the Chinese Red Army command of that 
day later admitted that it would never have 
dvanced south into Korea if it had not 
been certain that its bases in the north 
would remain immune from American attack. 
These bases did remain immune, and the 
result is known to history. 
NO SANCTUARY FOR AGGRESSORS 
The lesson is clear. There can be no sanc-
tuary for aggressors. No one must be per-
mitted to conduct such operations with 
such impunity again. Thus the wagers of 
aggressive war in North Vietnam must know 
that the well-springs of their policies are 
as much a target as the streams they produce. 
But the way out is still open for those 
who have brought down such punishment on 
their heads. The Johnson administration 
has, for example, endorsed the proposal by 
Pope Paul VI for arbitration of the Vietnam 
problem by neutral nations. In addition, 
the United States has called for a full-scale 
United Nations Security Council debate on 
the matter. We seek, in short, to talk and 
parlay even as the bombers fly. 
But it takes two to talk. 
SENATOR RIBICOFF ADDRESSES 
UNITED JEWISH APPEAL IN DAL-
LAS 
Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, 
the people of Dallas were pleased and 
privileged to play host recently to the 
1839 
distinguished junior Senator from Con-
necticut. The able Senator RIBICOFF, 
former Secretary of Health, Education, 
and Welfare, addressed the opening ses-
sion of the United Jewish Appeal South-
Southwestern regional conference at Dal-
las on January 22, 1966, and gave an 
informed and inspiring talk on the out-
standing efforts of the U.S. Jewish com-
munity in supporting philanthropic ac-
tivities. I am pleased that our distin-
guished colleague visited and spoke in 
my home State. 
I ask unanimous consent that an ac-
count of Senator RIBICOFF'S talk appear-
ing in the January 23, 1963, Dallas Morn-
ing News, be printed at this point in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
RIBICOFF PRAISES EFFORTS OF JEWS 
U.S. Senator ABRAHAM A. RIBICOFF praised 
supporters of the United Jewish Appeal here 
Saturday night for keeping faith with two 
great traditions?"the age-old Jewish tradi-
tion of caring for the needy and the Ameri-
can tradition of voluntary philanthropy." 
The Connecticut Democrat, addressing the 
opening session of the United Jewish Appeal 
(UJA) South-Southwest regional conference 
in the Stotler Hilton Hotel, lauded local UJA 
organization workers for recognizing "the 
duty to allocate funds to support Jewish cul-
tural and welfare needs on a national and 
international level 
"They accept the voluntary duty of shar-
ing the fruits of well-being and freedom they 
have found in this blessed land with their 
uprooted and destitute brethren in all parts 
of the world. 
"And I am proud to say that the same peo-
ple who participate with time, effort, and 
money in aiding Jewish philanthropies, give 
in equal measure to the philanthropies of the 
community at large." 
In this vein, he cited Max Fisher, UJA gen-
eral chairman and president of the Detroit, 
Mich., United Fund. 
Ribicoff also applauded the sense of re-
sponsibility taken on by UJA supporters. 
"They do not shrug their shoulders at the 
plight of the less fortunate and say, 'Let the 
government take care of the situation.' 
They accept a personal responsibility to help 
care for those who need assistance. 
"And in every town and city throughout 
our country, the local Jewish community 
doesn't wait for some governmental bureau to 
take care of the sick, the aged, the orphaned, 
or the distressed people among them. It or-
ganizes its own systems of aid to meet these 
problems. 
"And it is supported by most of the mem-
bers of the community on a voluntary 
basis?the basis of individual conscience and 
individual acceptance of that sacred duty to 
be his brother's keeper which is embodied in 
Judaism." 
More than 500 community leaders from 10 
States are attending the Dallas conference 
which will make plans for mobilizing support 
in the South and Southwest for the UJA's 
1966 nationwide drive to raise $73,420,000. 
The funds will go to Jewish immigrants in 
Israel and 30 other countries. 
Speaking with RIBICOFF at the first session 
Saturday night was T.IJA General Chairman 
Fisher who cited the group's major tasks in 
1966 as: 
Moving 55,000 Jewish immigrants and refu-
gees from distressed areas of Europe, North 
Africa, and Asia to Israel "and other lands of 
freedom."

STOP MURDER BY MOTOR 
Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, today 
in New York City the American Trial 
Lawyers Association, of which I am 
proud to be a longstanding member, is 
launching a broad-scale national attack 
on what it has truthfully named, in the 
title of a brochure already widely dis-
tributed throughout the Nation, "Mur-
der by ailotor." 
Members of the American Trial Law-
yers Association, as its president, Joseph 
Keiner, says in his introduction to the 
white paper or monograph, have "a vast 
storehouse of knowledge and experience 
acquired in investigation, preparation 
and trial of injury and death cases in 
the courts of our land." In issue after 
Issue of the bimonthly publication, Trial, 
the association has expressed concern 
for the problems of traffic safety. Re-
cent issues have followed the hearings 
which I chaired in the Commerce Com-
mittee on the tire safety bill by Senator 
NELSON, of which I was a cosponsor. 
They have reported on the hearings by 
Senator RIBicoEE, which were resumed 
this week, in the Government Opera-
tions Subcommittee. The organization, 
and its 20,000 members, has a long-
standing interest in auto safety. 
The 16 pages of "Murder by Motor" 
discusses, among other things, what it 
terms "the inadequate Government 
role." 
It is an undeniable fact that the Fed-
eral Government has no comprehensive 
plan in existence or in contemplation 
to cope with this frightful problem, 
which constitutes a major economic 
threat to our national economy and an 
ever-present hazard to the life and limb 
of our people. 
am most hopeful that we shall 
shortly be able to remedy that de-
plorable situation. I hope we may do 
It through the bill which I intend to 
introduce in the Senate tomorrow, and 
which Congressman JAMES A. MACKAY 
intends to introduce in the House on the 
same day. It is not my intention to dis-
cuss this bill in detail today, but it will 
be titled the National Traffic Safety Act, 
and it will provide a National Traffic 
Safety Agency with a center to include 
accident, engineering, and traffic studies 
of various kinds as a new national re-
source for an operating center to spear-
head the attack on murder by motor. 
It will aim at the promotion of uni-
formity among the various States in a 
variety of traffic matters among which 
there is a sad lack of uniformity today, 
and one which contributes to our prob-
lems. It will empower the specification 
of safety standards and certification of 
vehicles for roadworthiness, in a manner 
Thu 
similar to that by which the Federal 
Aviation Agency certifies the airworthi-
ness of planes before they become a 
regular part of our air traffic. In short, 
it will be a new and important center for 
study, for coordination, for Federal focus 
in the fight which we all must join, the 
crusade against public aoathy toward 
traffic fatalities. 
Throughout the Trial Lawyers bro-
chure there is discussion of the four main 
elements which contribute to highway 
accidents. These four are first, the 
driver: second, the automobile; third, 
the highway; and fourth the pedestrian. 
A panel of 2,000 lawyers from all 50 
States has been set up to broadcast and 
lecture on these questions, which the as-
sociation believes will be "one of the most 
ambitious and, hopefully, effective pro-
grams designed to focus public attention 
upon this monstrous problem." 
But the "Stop Murder by Motor" cam-
paign being launched today has more 
than an incidental tie to the Ma ckay-
Ilartke bill. The white paper not, only 
presents the alarming and challenging 
facts of our highway carnage. Some of 
them are most striking? such as that 
while our military battle deaths from 
1775 through 1964 totaled 605,000, our 
motor vehicle deaths from 1900 through 
1964 came to 1,510,000. But it also pre-
sents a number of specific recommenda-
tions. 
Among these are recommendations for 
Federal and State laws to require tire 
safety standards and. uniform labeling to 
dispel the confusion we have seen in the 
testimony on the Nelson bill. There is 
also this specific recommendation on 
page 15: 
Congress should enact a National Highway 
Safety Act providing for a National Director 
of Highway Safety with authority, personnel, 
and funds to act effectively. 
As one who has long had a deep inter-
est in auto safety and as the sponsor both 
of several bills now pending and of the 
Mackay-Hartke bill to be introduced to-
morrow, it is a double pleasure to note 
the efforts of the American Trial Lawyers 
Association, which are being launched 
today in its national campaign. It is a 
double pleasure because I am myself a 
member of the organization, the only 
raember of the Senate who is on the rolls 
of the Washington chapter. I hope its 
campaign will awaken the public con-
science and jolt the public lethargy 
which has so much handicapped our ef-
forts. I hope it will help to pave the way 
for not only acceptance of but demand 
for a national attack on the problem 
such as the Mackay-Hartke bill will pro-
vide. 
Mr. President, the Washington Post of 
yesterday took editorial note of the trial 
lawyers' efforts, at the same time noting 
Congressman MACKAY'S announced in-
tention. I might add that although the 
Congressman's careful and prolonged 
work had already resulted in a prelimi-
nary draft before our collaboration, the 
bill which we shall introduce is the re-
sult of active cooperation between Mr. 
MACKAY and myself and between our 
staffs. I hope that when it is introduced 
there will be not only cosponsors in the 
House who are already prepared to join 
Mr. MACKAY, but others who will wish to 
join me in the Senate. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that at this point the editorial of 
the Washingto:n Post "Question of Sur-
vival," may appear in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. I also ask that an editorial en-
titled "Highway Death Probe Needed," 
which appeared in the Franklin, Ind., 
Evening Star recently, may also appear. 
Finally, as a further contribution of sig-
nificance to discussion of the traffic 
safety problem in general and to the 
background for the Hartke-Mackay bill, 
I ask unanimous consent that the text 
of "Stop Murder by Motor," single copies 
of which may be secured in its original 
format from the American Trial Lawyers 
Association, 6 Beacon Street, Boston, may 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the Washington Post Feb, 1, 10661 
QUESTION OF SURVIVAL 
President Johnson's call for national high-
way safety legislation in the present session 
of Congress is being widely echoed. Con-
gressman JAMES A. MACKAY is about to intro-
duce a bill that would set up a National 
Traffic Safety Agency with broad powers of 
research and testing and a mandate to seek 
"a more uniform traffic environment." The 
American Trial Lawyers' Association is spon-
soring a snore sweeping Federal effort in the 
safety field. It would have Congress pro-
vide minimum standards for automotive de-
sign and seek uniformity in the licensing of 
drivers. 
The magnitude of the problem is illus-
trated by the trial lawyers' estimate that 
the human slaughter resulting from motor 
accidents will reach a total of 100,000 a year 
by 1975 if nothing is done to arrest the pres-
ent trends. It was nearly half that :figure 
last year. In addition, some 3 million per-
sons were injured and $8 billion worth of 
property was destroyed. It is truly a shock-
ing price to pay for our mobility?a price 
that could at least be greatly reduced by 
safety devices, rational driving habits and a 
banishment of alcohol from the highways. 
A report issued by the trial lawyers" esti-
mates that shoulder harnesses, automobile 
doors that will not open in a crash and col-
lapsible steering posts can virtually elim-
inate fatalities in accidents occurring at less 
than 35 miles an hour. And this, the report, 
asserts, would include 87 percent of all motor 
accidents. We surmise that this optimism is 
overdrawn, but it is clear that much can be 
done by making cars safer, by requiring pen-
odic examinations of both cars and drivers, 
by greater use of driver schools and the con-
struction of better highways. 
We think the time has come for Congress 
to take a hand in this campaign against 
slaughter on the highways. If construction 
standards are to be prescribed, they must 
necessarily be nationwide. Much could 
also be done to make driver requirements 
and rules of the road uniform. The close 
relationship of these remedial measures to 
human survival should give the proposed 
legislation a high priority. 
[From the Franklin (Ind.) Evening Star I 
HIGHWAY DEATH PROBE NEEDED 
By any test of sanity, the top priority items 
on the agenda of the reconvening Congress, 
after national defense, should be an investi-
gation into the carnage on our highways. 
This is, in fact, a matter of national de-
fense against an internal enemy which?

BATTLES RANGE WIDELY 
Most important public issues are fought 
not only at the polls, but in parliamentary 
chambers, in cloak rooms, lobbies, executive 
offices, forums, newspapers, radio and TV, 
your mailbox and your living room. 
Still in what other field of endeavor can 
one human being accomplish more for his 
generation and generations unborn? 
What higher privilege can an individual 
receive than to be entrusted by thousands, 
millions, tens of millions of voters?with the 
future of this Republic, indeed, of this 
planet? 
This generation, Arnold Toynbee has said, 
will be remembered as the first to dare to 
make the benefits of civilization available 
to the whole human race. 
In administrative posts, too?in local, 
State, and National Government?you can 
help carry out an immense range of policies 
and programs. Whether it is implementing 
atoms for peace or the ZIP code for post 
office efficiency, you can help meet the needs 
of 195 million. Americans and still greater 
numbers in the America of tomorrow. 
A lifetime career in civil service has the 
full benefits of the merit system of recruit-
ment, advancement, and protection. 
Youth?and youthful idealism?are play-
ing a more important role in these times than 
ever before. In the Peace Corps, in VISTA

unteer generation is making its mark for 
mankind. 
Interested in public service? Great. Give 
it a real try. 
THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL FOR 
A WORLDWIDE PROGRAM OF 
MALARIA ERADICATION 
Mr. MOSS. Mr. President, I welcome 
the President's proposal for a worldwide 
program of malaria eradication. Today 
we know what needs to be done to wipe 
out every vestige of this disease. We 
can wipe out the hiding places of the 
carrier mosquito; we can destroy the po-
tential of its growth; and we can prevent 
the parasite from ever being transmitted 
again. We have the tools and the chem-
icals and the knowledge. 
Malaria is the cause of great suffering 
In a large part of the world. It poisons 
the body, bringing sickness and death, 
and it saps initiative and energy. 
I urge passage of the International 
Health Act. More can be accomplished 
by the eradication of malaria than by 
the building of great hospitals. More 
lives can be saved, more progress can be 
made, and more friends can be made for 
this Nation. 
Having the power to control this 
dread disease, we sjkuld delay no longer 
In using it u the globe. 
RESUMPTION OF BOMBING OF 
NORTH VIETNAM 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in the 
aftermath of the President's decision to 
send our bombers back over North Viet-
nam, the Washington Evening Star 
doubtlessly summed up the conclusions 
of literally millions of Americans when 
it said: 
As President and as Commander in Chief, 
conscious of his responsibility to some 200,-
000 American troops as well as the soldiers 
of our allies, who are under attack by a re-
lentless foe, he could not have done other-
wise. 
No. 17 24 
Studied from any angle and from an 
quarter, the Star's editorial makes soun 
sense. 
The American- people should not b 
sold short if and when attempts ar 
made to assess their "reaction." Th 
people of this country have the facts 
They know what has been done by thi 
administration to seek any signs tha 
would lead to the conference table 
They also know the outcome of tha 
search, for the outcome has been mad 
crystal clear. 
The people across the length and 
breadth of this land know the whys and 
wherefores of the President's decision, 
and the Star's editorial, to which I re-
fered earlier, makes their case when it 
said, and I quote: 
During the bombing pause, which lasted 
for 37 days, the Communists not only pressed 
ahead with the fighting; they also used the 
Opportunity to redeploy their soldiers, bring 
up supplies, and repair the damage done to 
their transportaiton system. To have per-
mitted this to go on indefinitely, as some 
urged, could only have resulted in heavier 
American and allied casualties. To his 
credit, his critics notwithstanding, the Pres-
ident was unwilling to pay this price. As 
he put it, it is our clear duty to do what we 
can to limit the casualty rolls which, in any 
event, will be long. 
I suggest that my colleagues will want 
to study and restudy this editorial. It 
brings into proper perspective what 
needs to be said and what is being said 
all around this country. 
To this end, I ask permission for it 
to be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
y It is not our purpose to be invidious in 
d suggesting this. But last week's spectacle 
in the Senate was nothing less than 
astonishing. 
In the course of a 4-hour grilling of 
e Secretary of State Rusk, one Senator after 
e another came forward to wring his hands 
His CLEAR DUTY 
In deciding to order a resumption of bomb-
ing of military targest in North Vietnam, 
Mr. Johnson did what had to be clone. As 
President and as Commander in Chief, con-
scious of his responsibility to some 200,000 
American troops as well as the soldiers of 
our allies, who are under attack by a relent-
less foe, he could not have done otherwise. 
Obviously, it was not an easy decision to 
make. And the President, even while giving 
the order for the bombers to take off, re-
newed his pledge that the search for a Just 
settlement will go on. One aspect of the 
quest is the arbitration proposal which 
Ambassador Goldberg has put before the 
U.N. Security Council. There is no occasion, 
however, for soaring hopes on this score. 
During the bombing pause, which lasted for 
37 days, the Communists not only pressed 
ahead with the fighting; they also used the 
Opportunity to redeploy their soldiers, bring 
up supplies, and repair the damage done to 
their transportation system. To have per-
mitted this to go on indefinitely, as some 
urged, could only have resulted in heavier 
American and allied casualties. To his 
credit, his critics notwithstanding, the Presi-
dent was unwilling to pay this price. As he 
put it, it is our "clear duty" to do what we 
can to limit the casualty rolls which, in any 
event, will belong. 
What is to be said of the critics, especially 
those in the Senate? 
In 1776 Thomas Paine wrote that "these 
are the times that try men's souls." He 
also paid his respects to "the summer soldier 
and the sunshine patriot" who, in the crisis 
of that day, shrank from the demands of 
the war for freedom. If Paine were living 
now he might have something to say about 
sunshine Senators. 
Senator FULBRIGHT couldn't recall any issue 
about which there is so much "apprehen-
sion." Pennsylvania's Senator CLARK was 
"scared to death" that we are on the way to 
world war III. Senator MUNDT offered the 
profound observation that there is a "de-
veloping uncertainty" among the American 
people "about what this is all about." 
(Little wonder, if the people have been 
listening to the senatorial critics.) 
One theme which runs through the 
criticism is that Congress, when it approved 
in 1964 a joint resolution supporting the 
President's policies, did not quite realize 
what it was all about, didn't quite intend to 
authorize the President to do precisely what 
he now is doing. Yet the language of the 
resolution is unambiguous. It puts Con-
gress squarely on record as authorizing the 
President, as he may determine, "to take 
all necessary steps, including the use of 
armed force," to assist South Vietnam in 
defense of its freedom. Pretty hard to 
wriggle out of an endorsement like that. 
Senator MORSE was one of two Members of 
Congress who voted against the resolution. 
So he at least is entitled to be heard as he 
protests now. The Oregon Senator has been 
intemperate, even savage, in his criticism 
of the President. But he is also the only one 
to come forward with a proposal which goes 
beyond mere handwringing. The 1964 reso-
lution provides that Congress may terminate 
it by another joint resolution, and Senator 
MORSE urges that this be done. 
Perhaps this should be brought to a test. 
Let us find out how many Members of Con-
gress, in the face of Ho Chi Minh's adamant 
refusal to discuss peace except on his own 
terms, would vote to rescind the authority 
previously given the President. Let us find 
out what those who might vote for revoca-
tion propose to do about the war, about the 
200,000 American troops who are fighting the 
battle, and whether they intend to welsh on 
our Nation's commitment to a free choice 
for South Vietnam. 
Our guess is that such a resolution could 
not muster a corporal's guard in Congress. 
If this is so, there shOuld be an end to aim-
less speeches and protests which serve no 
better purpose than to undermine the Presi-
dent and to encourage the enemy. 
EDUCATION POLICY FOR A 
NONCONFORMIST AGE 
Mr. PEARSON. Mr. President, we 
must be ever vigilant to new concepts of 
education which compliment our surging 
economy and our swift moving techno-
logical progress. 
Such a new concept I would call the 
Senate's attention today which is being 
proposed by a Kansas education ad-
visory committee. 
Mr. John H. Colburn, editor and pub-
lisher of the Wichita, Kans., Eagle and 
Beacon, recently addressed himself to the 
needed changes in education in a speech 
he presented to the Kansas State School 
Board's Association at Topeka, Kans., on 
January 18, 1966. Mr. Colburn's state-
ments, I believe, are prophetic and I 
would urge all interested in orderly prog-
ress of education to read this speech by 
Mr. Colburn. 
I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Col-
burn's address be printed in the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD at this point.

EDUCATION POLICY FDIC A NON CONFOILMIST AGE 
(By John H. Colburn) 
Nonconformism has many facets. In dis-
cussing "Education Policy in a Nonconform-
ist Age," I view nonconformism in the frame-
work of new ideas, of new concepts, of inno-
vation, creativity You see many examples 
iii our space program, our scientific and med-
ical progress, the automation that started on 
the farm and has spread to business and 
industry. 
You hear more about a different type of 
beatnik nonconformism. Young men wear-
ing bobbed hair to their shoulders, jean-clad 
young women marching with bearded ones 
who burn their draft cards, girls in wading 
boots, their hair allotted in rope, who dance 
as if possessed of a terrible itch?cubes Sc, 
Far out as to be positively lunar, as the cool 
teens would describe it. 
Nonconformity Can be dangerous, it can be 
silly, and it can ee challenging and exciting. 
Dangerous because new ideas imperil the sta-
tus quo and always appear frightening to 
some people, silly because of what people 
will do to attract attention and seek status, 
challenging because of the tremendous stim-
ulus new ideas can provide those exploring 
the frontiers of change. 
Today the twin revolutions of technology 
and communications have swept away all 
certainty about the landscape of 'tomorrow. 
We cannot educate for the unpredictable to-
morrows. But education can?and must--
train pupils to be creative, imaginative in 
their thinking, ono to encourage them to be 
constructive, thought-provoking non-con-
formists embracing 'levy modes of thought 
and action. Uniformity of thought and com-
placent performance are trademarks of a so-
ciety that fears the unknowns, one that has 
always resisted new ideas. These are the 
types of groups who regarded the greatest 
teacher of them all?Jesus Christ -as a radi-
cal and subversive because his ideas were 
new?nonconformist and consequently dan-
gerous. 
Now is the time to implement, radical, new 
approaches to education. And the impetus 
for change must come from far-sighted lead-
ers in education, in business, in the profes-
sions and from politicians dedicated to better 
serving the public welfare. The impetus is 
not likely to be forced on the schools from 
man-controlled satellites transmitting im-
ages through computer signals picturing a 
barren lunar surface man may be exploring 
within 5 years. 
These are harbingers of dramatic new 
methods of transportation. By the early 
eighties commercial travelers may be zooming 
from the United States to any point in the 
world by rocket ship in 45 minutes. The 
rocket ship will be 7 times faster than 
the supersonic transport, with takeoffs and 
descents at 3 times the pull of gravity 
providing the thrill of riding a gigantic :roller 
coaster. 
From pony express to rocket trave.--all

segment of society, the liberation or the 
common man, the search for the uncoil mon

gotten man, the victim of change. 
There is nothing new about change As 
long ago as 513 B.C., the Greek Philosopher 
Heraclitus voiced the eternal truth, there 
is nothing permanent except change.- Our 
problem is that knowledge has been gen-
erated at such a rate that change is 'being 
produced faster than people and communi-
ties can absorb it. 
And within the next 10 to 20 years we will 
witness change of a magnitude never known 
or dreamed of before. It will be a world so

Hardly. That is why, in our educational 
outlook, we must penetrate the minds of 
future ages. If our goal is to enable man 
to realize his maximum potential, obsolete, 
inefficient educational procedures must be 
scrapped and a new program and philosophy 
implemented.

was the domain of the fierce Mescalero 
Apaches and was crossed also by the great 
war trail of the Comanches. 
In the autumn of 1854 the Army estab-
lished a stronghold in the heart of Apache 
country, a short distance west of the 
Comanche war trail. The site was 475 miles 
northwest of San Antonio, 220 miles south-
east of El Paso by wagon road. They manned 
the outpost with six companies of infantry-
men and named it Fort Davis, in honor of 
Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, who had 
authorized its establishment. In a box 
canyon, near Limpia Creek, the soldiers built 
60 crude structures of log and lumber, cut-
ting pine from the surrounding Davis Moun-
tains and sawing it at their own mill. 
From this isolated post they supplied es-
corts for mail and passenger coaches, res-
cued wagon trains attacked by the Indians 
and on occasion mounted mules to follow 
raiding Apaches through the mountains on 
punitive expeditions. From time to time 
cavalry troops sent out from the lower coun-
try used Fort Davis as headquarters for war 
against the tribes. Slowly the Army drove 
the Mescaleros into Mexico and forced the 
Comanches to use other routes. 
From 1857 to 1860 Fort Davis was one of 
the centers for testing War Secretary Davis' 
idea of using camels for military purposes 
In the desert regions of the West. Late in 
June of 1859 two dozen camels, under the 
personal supervision of a picturesque char-
acter named Radii Ali, were at the fort for 
several days. They were on a "test run" 
from San Antonio into the Big Bend. Sol-
diers and settlers gathered around to view 
the strange awkward animals and their 
stranger guardian, whom they promply 
dubbed "Hi-Jolly." The swarthy little fel-
low, with his red fez and rainbow-hued 
pantaloons, seemed as out of place in far 
west Texas as his charges. 
The camels performed well, traveling in 
apparent comfort up to 4 days without drink-
ing and proving immune to the bite of the 
deadly rattlesnake. They ran into trouble 
in the Big Bend, however, where the thorny 
ground cover and sharp rocks damaged their 
tender feet. An answer to this problem 
might have been found if the approach of 
the Civil War had not removed Jeff Davis and 
his projects from Federal favor. 
During the war the fort was briefly occu-
pied by Confederates, then abandoned to the 
tender mercies of the Indians and elements. 
Between them, these destructive forces wiped 
out the place. In 1867, when Federal troops 
returned, they built a new fort, of rock and 
adobe, in the present location. 
Fort Davis became a major installation, 
with quarters for 10 troops of cavalry and 2 
companies of infantry. Many of the enlisted 
men were Negro, or "buffalo soldiers," as the 
Indians called them. They waged a persis-
tent bitter war against the Indians through-
out the Davis Mountains and the rugged 
Chisos of the Big Bend. When the Coman-
ches were beaten by other troops under 
Ranald McKenzie, at the Palo Duro, in 1875, 
one of the threats to the travelers was re-
moved. 
The Mescalero Apaches fought on for an-
other 5 years, retreating into the mountain 
vastness of Mexico when hard pressed, but 
returning from time to time on desperate 
bloody raids. Finally, in 1880, the tribes 
under daring Chief Vic torio were soundly 
defeated and driven across the Rio Grande 
for the last time. In the next 10 years Fort 
Davis duty was easier. There were occa-
sional Indian raids from across the river and 
more frequent forays by Mexican bandits, 
but nothing to test the mettle of field-hard-
ened fighters. In June of 1881 the country 
was declared safe and the fort was aban-
doned. 
This large military installation stood 
empty and desolate for years, slowly disinte-
grating. The land on which the fort stood 
had always been private property, only leased 
by the Government. For years the better of 
the officers' quarters were rented by landown-
ers to citizens of the town which had grown 
up beside the fort and taken its name. Later 
the houses were regularly rented to summer 
visitors from Houston, Galveston, and Aus-
tin, who came to enjoy the comfort of the 
"air-conditioned" summers. In the late 
1920's an Oklahoma oilman leased the fort 
and restored a few buildings, using it as the 
setting for a series of "horse operas" featur-
ing the movie star, Jack Hoxie. The depres-
sion put an end to that. 
Fort Davis citizens made a valiant effort to 
raise money to buy the site and save the old 
fort in the early 1940's, but World War n 
intervened. The great genuine relic of our 
frontier Indian wars and migrations west-
ward seemed doomed to oblivion until 1963, 
when it was named a national historic site 
and put under the care of the National Park 
Service. 
Today many of the original buildings have 
been restored, the site has been cleaned up 
and plans have been made for further res-
toration. The rocky wagon trails of the past 
have been replaced by hard-surfaced high-
ways and tourists from all over the country 
come to enjoy a peep into the past. 
IS THERE ANYTHING 
NEGOTIATE? 
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the peace 
offensive which we have been conduct-
ing raises the question in everyone's mind 
about what we hope to accomplish 
through negotiations and what kind of 
settlement could possibly emerge. These 
are difficult questions, and we must 
ponder them carefully. 
In this connection, I wish to commend 
to my colleagues a recent essay in Time 
magazine entitled "Is There Anything 
To Negotiate?" 
This essay begins by quoting a state-
ment Jonathan Swift wrote in a different 
time and place, but which is relevant 
to our situation today. He wrote this 
of negotiations: 
Supposing the war to have commenced 
upon a just motive; the next thing to be 
considered is when a prince ought in pru-
dence to receive the overtures of a peace: 
which I take to be, either when the enemy 
Is ready to yield the point originally con-
tended for, or when that point is found 
impossible to be ever obtained. 
Time points ou.t that the United States 
is not yielding the point for which it is 
contending; namely the independence, 
freedom, and self-determination of the 
people of Vietnam, and has certainly 
not concluded that this goal is im-
possible to attain. Likewise, the enemy 
does not appear ready to yield his point, 
that the United States must be driven 
out of Vietnam, and thus far does not 
seem persuaded that this goal is unat-
tainable. 
Under such circumstances?
The essay states?
it is highly questionable just what negotia-
tions could accomplish. * * * In fact, it is 
hard to see what the United States and the 
Communists could find to negotiate about 
at the present time with any expectation of 
results. 
These troubled times must be consid-
ered in the light of our history and the 
principles for which we stand. Compro-
mise with aggression has never brought 
forth an end to aggression before, and 
there is no reason to suspect that it 
would do so today. 
I request unanimous consent to insert 
this thoughful and most timely essay in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the essay 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
IS THERE REALLY ANYTHING To NEGOTIATE? 
"Supposing the war to have commenced 
upon a just motive; the next thing to be 
considered is when a prince ought in prud-
ence to receive the overtures of a peace: 
Which I take to be, either when the enemy 
is ready to yield the point originally con-
tended for, or when that point is found im-
possible to be ever obtained." 
That is how Jonathan Swift defined the 
necessary conditions for ending a war. There 
is no sign that these conditions have been 
reached in Vietnam. The United States is 
certainly not yielding the point it is con-
tending for?the independence of South 
Vietnam?and has certainly not concluded 
that this goal is impossible to attain. Con-
versely, the enemy does not appear ready to 
yield his point either?that the United 
States must be driven out of Vietnam?and, 
as far as anyone can tell so far, has not been 
ersuaded that this goal is unattainable. 
Under the circumstances, it is highly ques-
tionable just what negotiations could accom-
plish. Amid the current U.S. peace over-
tures, there is a widespread, hopeful feel-
ing that if only both sides start talking, 
peace will follow. In fact, it is hard to see 
what, if anything, the United States and 
the Communists could find to negotiate about 
at the present time with any expectation 
of results. 
Hanoi has spelled out its aims in four 
points, and they add up to outright with-
drawal of U.S. troops and the seizure of 
South Vietnam by the Vietcong. Washing-
ton counters with its own 14 points, which 
actually go a considerable way toward cre-
ating areas for negotiation?but which are 
easily misunderstood, 'unless the fine print 
and the implicit qualifications are kept in 
mind. The rockbottom, irreducible U.S. aim 
is that South Vietnam must be independent. 
Under every conceivable point of negotia-
tion?provided both sides mean what they 
say?this U.S. minimum goal conflicts head-
on with the Communist demand. Neverthe-
less, there is considerable interest in the 
principal topics that could come up at a 
bargaining table. They add up to six: 
(1) When to stop fighting. Despite the U.S. 
proposal that "a cessation of hostilities could 
be the first order of business at a conference," 
high American officials in Saigon and Wash-
ington warn that the United States should do 
just the opposite, maintaining and perhaps 
increasing military pressure until discussions 
are successfully concluded. In his book, 
"How Communists Negotiate," Adm. C. 
Turner Joy (retired) the U.N.'s chief negoti-
ator in Korea, charges that Washington's 
early agreement to a truce line at the Pan-
munjom peace talks in 1951, "was the turning 
point of the armistice conference. There-
after, we lacked the essential military pres-
sure to enforce a reasonable attitude"?and 
70,000 American casualties were sustained 
under Communist attacks while the talks 
dragged on for 2 years. In Vietnam, warns a 
top U.S. diplomat in the Far East, to ease up 
on the battlefiled would be "to insure a loss 
at the bargaining table." Furthermore, if 
talks broke down after a cease-fire, it would 
be difficult to regain the momentum to start 
the war up again. Some U.S. diplomats also 
insist that any talks should have a time 
limit and not be allowed to go on indefinite-
ly, and that a system for supervision and in-
spection of whatever measures may even-
tually be agreed on should be nailed down 
first.

Question. Doesn't the Supreme Court de-
talon deal only with reapportionment of 
State legislatures, not with the Federal Gov-
ernment? 
Answer. But the Court has upset a balance 
between the Central Government and the 
States by intruding to tell a State what it 
must do with its legislature. In doing so, 
they have violated the whole principle of fair, 
balanced representation, which it has taken 
centuries to achieve, and that makes the 
situation a crisis in our governmental scheme. 
Het's spell it out a little to see how these 
things grow: Almost immediately atter the 
iaourt's decision in June 1964, a suit was filed 
Kent County, Mich., to reapportion the 
-:a-tard of supervisors on the basis of one man, 
, me vote. 
A suit has even been filed by the dean of 
'De 'Paul University in Chicago to force reap-
aortionment of the Supreme Court of the 
atilt? of Illinois to carry out the edict of the 
US. Supreme Court,. 
Now, how far do you go? There's no end 
to what that rolling decision can finally do. 
They talk about "rotten boroughs" and 
shout a State senator who may represent 20 
times as many constituents as another State 
senator. Look at the Senate of the United 
States. There are 2 Senators from New York 
state with a population of 17 million, and '2 
Senators from Nevada with a population of 
265,000. Just figure out the discrepancy in 
representation there. 
PROTECT] NG STATES ROLE 
Question. Those who favor the reappor-
tionment decision say that you are opposing 
e, shift that will bring government closer to 
a pure democracy--
Answer. Ours is a representative republic. 
1 believe it is within the domain of a State 
hr give representation and balance to the 
interests in that State. 
Look at how control in many States will 
shift completely to urban areas. In Illinois, 
;ook County?which includes Chicago?has 
more than half the population of our State. 
That means that, ii they so desire, reprc-
tientatives of one county can do pretty much 
or they please with respect to the other 101 
enmities. 
What's involved in the other 101 counties? 
These are the areas where you have rural 
schools. You don't have rural schools in 
(thicago. What about farmland? Not much 
of that in Chicago. This one county con-
trolling the situation may decide to put a 
,atate tax on farmland.

iteny the minority its rights? 
Answer. Yes. But there's another aspect 
Ii all this that is overlooked: 
Those who are organized to resist my 
atnendment anti who want to perpetuate 
tIris one-man, one-vote ruling are smart. 
Mr. Meany (George Meany, president of the 
AFL-CIO) said he would rather give up 
ou repeal of 14th) forever than surrender 
on reapportionment. Why? Because labor 
traders know that they can control both 
branches of many State legislatures under 
this Supreme Court decision. Lack of that 
con trol has been their problem. 
1:11 Illinois, for example, labor could get 
things through our general assembly, but 
when it came to the State senate there was 
a chance to take a look and cool things off. 
Question. What does your amendment on 
reapportionment provide? 
Answer. It would require one branch of a 
Stale legislature to be apportioned strictly on 
the basis of population. The other branch 
eoind be based on factors other than popu-
No. 17 - 23 
latioh. The apportionment plan developed 
by the State legislature would be submitted 
to the voters in a referendum. On that 
referendum ballot, you would have to put 
on the one-man, one-vote plan,. also. Now 
they say: "Well, it's too late. The boat has 
left the pier." 
Question. Too late-to reverse the Supreme 
Court action? 
Answer. Not to reverse it, hut to meet it. 
They say too many States have already re-
apportioned on the basis of one man, the 
vote. 
They miss the point. Let us assume that 
we get this amendment passed and the 
States ratify it so that it becomes part of he 
Constitution. My State might not want to 
do anything about it. Tennessee might not 
? 
want to do anything. The point is that I 
want to have available to the people of 
States a weapon that they can use if they 
warn to. Today, there is no weapon. 
We want to go back to the people. They 
are the sovereign in our form of govern-
ment. In my amendment, we have said that 
after every decennial census the State legis-
lature must again submit an apportionment 
plan to the people. So once every 10 years, 
the people have a chance to vote on the 
matter. 
Question. Do you look for the Democrats 
to push for an increase of the minim um 
wage in this new session? 
Answer. Yes. They have tat Iced about as 
much as $2 an hour, and extended cm er-
age. And, from my earlier excursion into 
that field, when I was on the Senate Labor 
Committee. I know that this would have 
great impact. It would involve a lot of small 
establishments?restaurants, laundries, gro-
ceries, notions stores, etc. Such an :increase 
in the minimum wage, coupled with ext en-
dive new coverage, would be quite a burtten. 
It would, as I see it, liquidate a great many 
little businesses that simply can't take it. 
Question. Looking forward to the Novem-
ber elections: Would you be willing to esti-
mate the extent of the Republican gains you 
expect? 
Answer. No, because you still have 10 
months to go. In 10 months, all sorts of 
things can happen. Who shall say, beta een 
now and November, what will take place with 
all the uncertainties in the world? All 01 a 
sudden, for example, we find ourselves wi -11 a 
finger in lthe pie over in Rhodesia. 
Question. Should we have a finger in ,?hat 
pie? 
Answer Frankly, that's a long way from 
home, and, after all, what we're trying to do 
is to give some aid to Wilson (Harold Wilson, 
British Prime Minister). But, now, here are 
the-se African countries running out on Wil-
,son. So what's going to be the upshot of this 
master? 
:13:ere we have the Dominican Republic. 
That's as far from being peaceful as it was 
the day we sent the boys down there. 
And who knows what the Cubans are go-
ing -to do? Chile wants to put up the price 
of copper. Brazil has been converted into a 
virtual dictatorship. Who knows in what di-
rection President de Gaulle is going to go? 
Or whether Chancellor Erhard was sati :died 
with his conversations here? 
On top of everything there's the population 
increase-65 million more people in the world 
every year, with 15 million more in Red China 
alone. How will Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-
lai feel when they get a, billion people in 
1980? 
DECISIONS UNITED STATES MUST MAKE 
Question. What moral do you draw from 
all this, Senator? 
Answer. The moral is that we will be 
plagued with headaches, and at long last we 
are going to have to answer for ourselves. 
Exactly what is our capacity to redretEs all 
the ills, problems, and grievances of the 
world? At what point must we draw the line 
in our own interest and for the sake of our 
own security and our own solvency? To me, 
that line has to be drawn sometime in the 
not too distant future. 
THE GHOSTS OF FALLEN APACHES 
AND TROOPERS HAUNT OLD FORT 
DAVIS, TEX. 
Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, 
Fort Davis, in the trans-Pecos section 
of west Texas, has been the scene of 
many memorable and colorful moments 
in the history of the Old West. Built 
in 1854 and named after Secretary of 
War Jefferson Davis, the fort was origi-
nally an important outpost for protection 
from the Mescalero Apaches and the 
Comanches. It later became the test 
site for Secretary Davis' proposal to use 
camels for military purposes in the des-
ert. After having been abandoned dur-
ing the Civil War, it was a major instal-
lation from 1867 until it was abandoned 
when the surrounding country finally 
became safe from Indian attack. 
The fort stood empty and slowly dis-
integrated during the years that fol-
lowed, until it was declared a national 
historic site in 1963. I was honored 
to be the Senate sponsor of the legisla-
tion that resulted in the preservation 
for the people of this remarkable part of 
our western heritage. 
Last year scores of thousands of vis-
itors came to Fort Davis to see for them-
selves this last outpost of the frontier. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that an article written by R. Hen-
derson Shuffler, director of the Texana, 
program of the University of Texas, and 
appearing in the Texas magazine of the 
January 23 Houston Chronicle, be print-
ed at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
CAMELS ONCE TREKKED HERE, Too 
From 1821 to 1846 Texas was the end of 
the rainbow for land-hungry frontiersmen. 
Then came the war with Mexico, ending with 
the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. 
Suddenly the rainbow's end jumped half a 
continent west anti old man Sutter found the 
pot of gold at its California tip. 
In the mad scramble to the gold fields, the 
most obvious shortcut from the south lay 
through Texas. This route also avoided the 
bitter winters and raging rivers of the north-
ern Rockies, in which many earlier travelers 
had died. But the southern route had its 
problems, too: a scarcity of water and a sur-
plus of Indians. 
The slow-moving wagons covered only 12 
to 15 miles a day. If waterholes were more 
than 1 day's drive apart, men and stock were 
inconvenienced; when they were forced to 
dry-camp more than 2 nights in a row, they 
suffered. The Army surveyed a route from 
San Antonio to El Paso which promised sur-
vival for both man and beast. There were 
42 waterholes on the trail, and only three 
of them were more than a 2-day drive apart. 
Immigrant and freight wagon trains 
pushed over this trail, followed soon by 
stagecoaches carrying passengers a:nd mail. 
Stage stands were established along the 
route, to supply fresh mules, food and some 
semblance of safety. But in the vast reaches 
of the trans-Pecos there was no safety. This

(2) Who participates? In suggesting ne 
gotiations a year and a half ago, Charle 
de Gaulle proposed that talks be Carrie 
on by the reconvened 1954 Geneva Confer 
ence, which was attended by France, th 
United States, Great Britain, Communist 
China, Russia, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. 
Washington would go along with this, but 
there has been little indication that such a 
disparate group would even sit down to-
gether today. Moreover, the United States is 
concerned that a large conference might 
degenerate into a Communist-dominated 
mob scene that would attempt to stampede 
Washington into undue concessions. A more 
important issue is Hanoi's insistence that 
the National Liberation Front, the political 
arm of the Vietcong, be seated as an equal 
participant. This the United States has re-
jected because it considers the front the 
pawn of North Vietnam, and feels that seat-
ing it would confer on the subversive orga-
nization that the United States has been 
fighting the status of a legitimate political 
power. However, Washington suggests that 
the Vietcong "would not have difficulty hav-
ing their views represented" if the front at-
tended as part of the North Vietnamese del-
egation. Says Secretary of State Rusk: "We 
don't care a bit who sits behind Hanoi's 
back at a conference table." 
(3) The Vietcong's future. The question 
of the Vietcong's status at the conference 
table leads directly to the far larger question 
of the Vietcong's future status in the country. 
Hanoi flatly demands that "the internal af-
fairs of South Vietnam be settled by the 
South Vietnamese people themselves, in ac-
cordance with the program of the National 
Liberation Front." The United States rejects 
this, arguing that it would in effect mean 
handing over South Vietnam to the Vietcong 
and hence to Hanoi. Some critics of U.S. 
policy disagree, asserting that the Liberation 
Front is, in large measure, a genuine nation-
alist movement and would sooner or later 
be independent of Hanoi. While the front 
certainly includes many non-Communists 
and nationalists, every reasonably well-in-
formed source agrees that it is an integral 
part of Hanoi's Communist apparatus. Com-
munists themselves like to compare the front 
to the Asian crane?"a big bird with a large 
white and a small? red head." Since the 
Vietcong now hold at least two-thirds of 
South Vietnam's territory (though mostly 
the least populated areas) , it is difficult to 
see how or why they should allow themselves 
to be excluded from any future political role. 
On the other hand, the United States minimal 
demand for an independent South Vietnam 
would be reduced to sham if the Vietcong 
were to have a leading role in a future 
coalition government, which they obviously 
would seek to subvert and dominate. 
(4) Elections. The country's political fu-
ture, says the United States, should be deter-
mined by free elections in South Vietnam. 
In genuinely free elections, Washington feels 
that the Vietcong would not do nearly so well 
as thought by some observers who underes-
timate the genuine anti-Communist senti-
ment in South Vietnam. However, free elec-
tions are obviously impossible while the 
Vietcong retain their arms and their whole 
apparatus of terror, and before a measure of 
security, stability, and free political life has 
been restored to the war-torn country. Much 
the same applies to Hanoi's demand for "the 
peaceful reunification" of North and South 
Vietnam. The United States concedes that 
this should be determined through free deci-
sion of both people, the key phrase being 
"free decision." The United States would 
want a genuine vote both in the South and 
in the North (which, of course, has never had 
a free vote under Communist rule). Hanoi 
would want a plebiscite engineered and dom-
inated by the Communists. 
(5) The presence of U.S. troops. Hanoi de-
mands the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the 
- dismantling of U.S. Military bases. Wash-
s ington replies that "we want no U.S. bases in 
d southeast Asia" and "do not desire to retain 
- U.S. troops in South Vietnam," but adds the 
essential qualification "after peace is as-
sured." In other words, the United States is 
perfectly willing to get out of South Vietnam, 
but only when and if the country is made 
really secure, which would obviously take a 
long time. As a Washington observer ex-
plains: "It is not U.S. policy to seek or main-
tain bases in southeast Asia merely for the 
purpose of having such bases. The bases will 
remain in the area only so long as they are 
essential for the protection of countries." 
Hanoi, of course, does not concede that Viet-
cong infiltration or subversion is a form of 
aggression from which South Vietnam re-
quires protection. An international control 
commission or peace force to supervise and 
police a possible settlement has been sug-
gested as a way out, but hardly any serious 
observers believe that this would work in the 
long run. The possibility is also being ad-
vanced that the United States for the time 
being hold on to the one-third or so of South 
Vietnam's territory that the Americans and 
the Saigon government currently control?
the cities and coastal enclaves?and abandon 
the rest to the Vietcong until it could be lib-
erated by a United States backed hidden 
war, in which United States and South Viet-
namese troops would wage a quiet guerrilla 
campaign in reverse against the Communists. 
But this, too, would in effect temporarily 
hand the Vietcong control of most of the 
country. 
(6) Neutralization. There have been vari-
ous suggestions for a neutralized setup, not 
in Vietnam alone but in the whole area?a 
series of buffer states between Red China and 
the West. Laos, Of course, is formally neu-
tral already, and highly unstable, but cur-
rently leaning toward the West. Cambodia 
Is also technically neutral, but leaning 
heavily toward China. For these countries, 
and perhaps Burma, a regional neutrality 
system might make sense from the Western 
point of view. Thailand, on the other hand, 
is the most stable country in the area, 
stanchly anti-Communist and pro-West, and 
its neutralization might well be unac-
ceptable to its own people. On this, the 
U.S. position is that "the countries of south-
east Asia can be nonalined or neutral; the 
United States wants no new allies." But it 
would have to be true neutrality, meaning 
genuine independence?and it is virtually 
impossible to see what military or political 
force could insure this. 
Washington is not trying to push Ho Chi 
Minh into an agreement formally admitting 
defeat. After all, he has not yet been de-
feated. But for negotiations to yield an 
real results, the Communists would have to 
admit tacitly that they cannot force the 
United States out, and thus conclude that 
they might as well cut their losses under some 
face-saving formula. Should the Commu-
nists ever reach that point, it is entirely 
possible that it would not lead them to the 
conference table at all, but that the war 
would end in a military stalemate and the 
gradual petering out -of guerrilla attacks?
as they petered out without ceremony in 
Greece, the Philippines, Malaya, and the 
Congo. 
THE FUTURE OF FRIENDSHIP 
AIRPORT 
Mr. BREWSTER, Mr. President, the 
recent announcement by the Federal 
Aviation Agency that they would begin 
permitting jet flights to utilize Washing-
ton National Airport has prompted a 
storm of protests from those who are con-
cerned with the safety of the public in 
the air and on the ground; those con-
cerned with the impact of jet landings 
and takeoffs on. Washington residents 
and visitors; and those concerned with 
the wasteful duplication of expenditure 
in the construction of Dulles Interns, 
tional Airport and the subsequent open-
ing of Washington National for jets. 
Recent editorials from the News 
American and the Maryland Gazette 
point up the inconsistencies and blunder-
ings which have characterized public 
policy with respect to the operation of 
Washington National and Dulles Airports 
by the Federal Aviation Agency. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the editorials be printed at this 
point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorials 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the Baltimore (Md.) News American, 
Jan. 26, 1966] 
THE FUTURE OF FRIENDSHIP 
The most recent threat to the future 
prosperity of Friendship Airport has been 
chronicled in a series of articles, "The Airport 
Nightmare," by News American staffer Ray 
Abram, Jr. 
Charles Crane, chairman of the Friendship 
Airport Board, calls the decision of the 
Federal Aviation Agency to allow small jets 
to use Washington's National Airport start-
ing April 24 "another declaration of war." 
Mr. Crane has made it clear that he intends 
to respond to this new challenge with 
the same vigor with which he met, and over-
came, the threat to Friendship posed by that 
$120 million Federal "white elephant," Dulles 
Airport at Chantilly, Va. 
Friendship has a number of things going 
for it. It is a young airport, with plenty of 
room to expand. Its long runways are already 
capable of handling any known or conceiv-
able jets. Its facilities are up to date, and, 
as the Abrams series points out, it is able 
to offer "creature comforts" undreamed of 
at the crowded Washington National Airport. 
We have no doubt that Friendship, under 
Mr. Crane's capable guidance, will meet the 
challenge. 
But the fact that it has been posed should 
instill new vigor into a legislative drive to 
divorce the regulatory functions of the 
Federal Aviation Agency from its role as an 
airport manager. A Federal agency has no 
business wearing both hats. The sooner this 
unfortunate state of affairs is ended, the 
better. 
From the Maryland Gazette, Jan. 20, 1066] 
AIRPORT FACES NEW FIGHT 
Friendship International Airport, which 
won the battle for jet flights after Dulles 
International Airport opened in 1962, has 
another fight on its hands. 
The stakes are the same?jet flights. The 
enemy is the same?the Federal Aviation 
Agency. But this time, the going probably 
will be rougher. 
A massive public relations and advertising 
campaign by Friendship enabled it to counter 
the novelty of the white elephant Dulles Air-
port and get back many of the flights airlines 
had been pressured into transferring to the 
Virginia facility by the brazen FAA. 
But Friendship's campaign was aided by 
Dulles' location-37 miles from Washington 
as compared with the less than 30 miles to 
Friendship. Government officials wanting 
jet flights preferred Friendship because it 
was closer. 
The new threat to Friendship, situated in 
Anne Arundel County but owned and oper-
ated by Baltimore City, came in an 
announcement last week by the FAA that 
National Airport was being authorized to 
handle certain types of jet aircraft. 
Where these aircraft are involved, National 
will have the advantage of convenience over

Friendship, at least for jet passengers 
traveling to and from Washington. With its 
advantage of convenience undermined, 
'Friendship?it is safe to assume?will find it 
virtually impossible to regain any flights it 
loses to the facility at Alexandria. 
Maryland Members of Congress reacted 
angrily to the announcement of the highly 
suspicious decision, sizing it up as another 
low blow to Friendship. They also cited the 
greater danger of airplane accidents in the 
Washington area. 
For many years. National's runways-6,870, 
5,212, and 4,724 ileet long?were considered 
to be dangerously short to accommodate jet 
aircraft. Coupled with the air traffic con-
gestion at National, one of the Nation's 
busiest airports, the short runways?it was 
[un--would pose a serious danger to densely 
copulated adjacent areas and Government 
buildings across the Potomac River in Wash-
ington. 
Now, years later, the FAA has decided that 
National's facilities are adequate. 
This would justify a charge of bureau-
cratic stupidity if it were not -tor certain 
other facts: 
The FAA owns and operates both National 
and Dulles International Airports. Dulles, 
which cost American taxpayers $110 million, 
has been a big best, losing $6 million a year. 
The FAA decided it could recover some of 
this loss by opening National to jet traffic. 
'rhe FAA could not have studied the matter 
without realizing that some of National's 
gain would have to be Friendship's loss. It 
shapes up, therefore, as a deliberate attempt 
Ltil entice jet airlines away from Friendship 
to National Airport. 
We are waiting now for Friendship Inter-
national Airport officials to announce, as they 
did when Dulles opened, that airlines are 
being pressured oy the FAA into moving their 
operations to National. 
if FAA bullishness manifests itself again, 
we hope Maryland Members of Congress will 
see to it that a tull-scale investigation is 
made of that Agency's operations.

Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I

GUNS FOR Mrut 
(By Steve Esrati) 
The Federal Government has been reim-
bursing schools for milk the schools dis-
tribute under a special program. The result 
had been that children got milk at much 
lower prices in school than the price charged 
in stores. 
'I'he obvious advantage of such a program 
is that the children of the Nation's poor were 
able to get milk. In some school districts, 
the schools picked up the tab for the pcswest 
of the poor. 
Well, it all over. The Bureau 01 the 
Budget, without authorization from Con- 
gress, has withheld $3 million which (.on-
gress had allocated to the school milk 
program.. 
The effects of this unwarranted Budget 
Bureau action are manifold: 
Less milk will be consumed under the pro-
gram because local school districts will have 
to pay more of the costs of the progra m or 
pass the added costs to the children. 
More milk will have to be bought bs the 
Federal Government under the price support 
program because less milk will be used in 
the school program. "This means," said 
Senator Wiraiam PROXMIRE? Dethoera 7, of 
Wisconsin, "that the $3 million saved by 
depriving the schoolchildren of nature'. per-
fect food will be paid out by the Federal 
Government for purchasing and storing milk 
under the price support program * '. In 
other words, instead of going into chit lien's 
stomachs the millk will be powdered and 
stored in warehouses at Government, ex-
pense." 
The poor children who benefit most :from 
the special milk program will be the Inst to 
drop out of the program if the increased cost 
created by the reduction in Federal ptrtici-
pation is passed on to the children. 
It is not -known who ordered the iaireau 
of the Budget to cut back the milk money.

EDWIN C. SCAHILL'S BELLAMY 
AWARD ADDRESS 
Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, most of us 
are very familiar with the National 
Bellamy Flag Award program which was 
established in 1942 to honor Francis 
Bellamy, author of the Pledge of Alleg-
iance to the flag of the United States 
of America. On October 15, 1965, the 
24th National Bellamy Flag Award was 
presented to Pierre S. DuPont High 
School of Wilmington, Del. Sharing in 
the award presentation were student 
ambassadors from the 23 schools which 
previously won the award. 
This year, for the first time in the his-
tory of the program, the student am-
bassadors were judged on the excellence 
of their participation, and Honor Medals 
for Americanism were awarded to the 
three outstanding students. I am very 
proud that the 1965 Gold Medal winner. 
Edwin Carl Scahill, was from my State 
of Indiana. 
Edwin is a student at the Arsenal 
Technical High School in Indianapolis, 
which won the Bellamy Award in 1948. 
Edwin, who is president of the student 
affairs organization, won his medal on 
the basis of attitude, cooperation, cour-
tesy, interest in the program, associated 
activities, merit, personality, promptness. 
the fulfillment of all outlined obligations. 
and the initiative which he showed as 
an ambassador of his school, his com-
munity, and his State. 
I ask unanimous consent that Edwin's 
excellent address, which was made on the 
occasion of the presentation of his wx.-ard. 
be printed at the conclusion of my re-
marks. 
There being no objection, the address 
was ordered to be printed in the R,Ecosa, 
as follows: 
Arsenal Technical High School, establisheo 
in 1912 to relieve congestion at tvv e other 
city high schools, is actually a tribune to 
peace. Utilizing an active arsenal of 
Civil and Spanish American Wars, the 76. 
acre campus, boasting 60 species of treers. 
is one of nature's beauty spots in the t"art 
of the city. 
The actual Arsenal building, one el in 
original structures and celebrating its 100th 
anniversary this year, now houses the ad-
ministrative offices of our school: 19ESS also 
marks the 50th anniversary of Tech 's first 
graduating class. Nine of the sixteen dpionia 
recipients were honored guests at the al ume 
celebration held in May. 
The collegelike campus satisfies the edu-
cational needs of nearly 5,000 day 81 laients

industries. This educational opportunity, 
designed for those employees who were un-
able to complete their high school education, 
permits them to attend courses in classrooms 
within the plant, yet under the supervision 
and with teachers provided by Tech. 
The second addition is the offspring of 
current transformation to pushbuttons in 
the business world. The data processing 
instructional program of the Indianapolis 
public schools is located at Tech High School. 
Key punches, collators, interpreters, and 
verifiers are included in the initial equip-
ment, with future plans to offer computer 
programming and machine operation. 
Our school has received 27 Freedom Foun-
dation awards, more than any other school 
in the Nation. Our ROTC unit has received 
44 consecutive honor rating awards in an-
nual Federal inspections. 
It is indeed a privilege and honor to rep-
resent Arsenal Technical High School at this 
annual Bellamy Award presentation. I come 
from the crossroads of America to the chemi-
cal capital of the world to welcome the Pierre 
S. DuPont High School to our distinguished 
family. 
AN Llb-rtairANIZATION ENTITLED 
"AMERICANS FOR REAPPRAISAL 
ON FAR EASTERN POLICY" 
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, recently a 
group of concerned Americans, largely 
academicians and students, launched an 
organization called "Americans For Re-
appraisal of Far Eastern Policy." 
This group urged that an immediate 
cease fire be established in Vietnam. It 
called for American readiness "to nego-
tiate toward the recognition of the Peo-
ple's Republic of China," and toward the 
admission of Communist China to the 
United Nations. 
An excellent letter was sent to this 
group by an American who also ex-
pressed his desire for a reappraisal of 
American Far Eastern policy. 
Michael Lindsay asked the group 
whether it would "propose to formalize 
the present situation in large areas 
where the Saigon administration con-
trols by day, and the Vietcong by night?" 
While stating that current American 
policy could indeed undergo some 
changes with regard to China, Mr. 
Lindsay criticizes this group for simply 
accepting an approach with the same 
implicit restrictions of current policies. 
Mr. Lindsay sums up his criticism this 
way: 
? My main criticism of your proposals is that 
they are likely both to encourage the more 
doctrinaire elements in the Chinese Com-
munist leadership in their delusion that, if 
they persist long enough in an intransigent 
policy, the American people will eventually 
force the U.S. Government to a settlement 
on their terms, and also to encourage 
a delusion among the most conventional 
and unimaginative elements in the U.S. ad-
ministration that no changes in present pol-
icy need to be considered because its critics 
are too confused and irresponsible to take 
seriously. 
Mr. Lindsay makes a number of in-
teresting points which I would like to 
share with my colleagues, not as either 
my conclusions or those of Mr. Lindsay, 
but simply as subjects for careful 
thought and consideration. 
I request unanimous consent that this 
statement be included in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the state-
ment was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
To: Americans for Reappraisal of Far Eastern 
Policy 
From; Michael Lindsay 
I have read the material which you sent 
me and I feel considerable sympathy for more 
discussion of Far Eastern policy and con-
sideration of possible alternatives. I also 
agree that discussions and exchange of in-
formation between people in the United 
States and people in the Chinese People's 
Republic would be highly desirable. How-
ever, when someone asked me how your or-
ganization proposed to change present U.S. 
policy, I replied, "Apparently by assuming 
away all the serious problems." And I think 
that this was a fair eight-word summary of 
the material in your brochure and your 
"Statement of Purpose." 
Your first proposal, on Vietnam, is a good 
illuatration of unwillingness to think about 
the difficulties of giving an operational mean-
ing to nice sounding generalities. "* * * 
an immediate ceased-fire by both sides." 
sounds very nice, but who would be left in 
control? Would you propose to formalize 
the present situation in large areas where the 
Saigon administration controls by day and 
the Vietcong by night? "* * * administered 
through the United Nations * * *." also 
sounds very nice, but the U.N. finds it hard 
enough to administer cease-fire agreements 
even where there is a definite front. The 
people of South Vietnam might benefit from 
a U.N. administration replacing both Saigon 
and the Vietcong, but it is most unlikely that 
either side would accept a U.N. trusteeship. 
When you propose that, "The United States 
should announce its readiness to negotiate 
toward the recognition of the People's Re-
public of China", you offer no suggestion 
at all to deal with the difficulties caused by 
the present attitude of tbe Peiping authori-
ties. The Chinese Communist leaders have 
repeatedly, explicitly and vehemently an-
nounced their refusal to accept diplomatic 
relations except on terms which recognize 
their claim to sovereignty over Taiwan. 
Given the U.S. treaty commitment to Tai-
wan, and given the strong evidence that even 
those inhabitants of Taiwan who dislike their 
present regime do not wish to exchange it 
for Communist rule, this present position of 
the Peiping authorities seems to rule out 
U.S. recognition of,the Chinese People's Re-
public as a practical policy alternative. Your 
proposal seems disingenious when it pre-
sents an announcement of U.S. readiness to 
negotiate towards recognition as something 
more than a meaningless propaganda ges-
ture unless you have some suggestions to 
resolve this problem. And there is nothing 
in your material to show that you have even 
thought about it. 
Again, your proposals are very misleading 
in their implicit assumption that diplo-
matic recognition, and U.N. membership for 
the Chinese People's Republic are necessarily 
related to increase contacts. If you had 
taken any trouble to examine the evidence 
you would have realized that this assumption 
was false Effective contacts between main-
land China and Canada, which has no diplo-
matic relations, seem to be rather greater 
than those with the United Kingdom, which 
recognizes Peiping. And the United King-
dom does not seem to have any advantage 
in contacts over Australia, which has diplo-
matic relations with Taipei. Japan, which 
has diplomatic relations with Taipei, has 
probably had more contacts with mainland 
China than any non-Communist country 
which has diplomatic relations with Peiping, 
The statements in your brochure by John 
Bennett, David Reisman, John K. Fairbank, 
and John Hersey in favor of more con-
tacts and discussions completely ignore i 
the restrictions imposed by the Chinese 
Communists on the type of contacts likely 
to promote the mutual knowledge and 
understanding which you profess to de-
sire. These Chinese restrictions have 
varied and were at a minimum during the 
period of maximum internal liberalization in 
1966-57. Since 1957, however, the ex-
perience of countries which do not restrict 
contacts with mainland China shows a fairly 
consistent pattern: The Peiping authorities 
have been willing to admit foreign Commu-
nists and people who can be relied on to pro-
duce favorable reports and to avoid any 
awkward questions in discussions or inter-
views. They have also been willing to allow 
conducted tours with official interpreters and 
visits by people whose primary interest is 
in trade or noncontroversial technical sub-
jects. (People who do not know Chinese and 
have no background knowledge of China 
seem to have better chances of getting a visa 
and even visitors who are fully competent in 
spoken and written Chinese have to employ 
an officially appointed interpreter.) They 
have very seldom been willing to allow the 
type of visit by the type of visitor which 
could yield reliable independent information 
about the situation in China, or to give in-
terviews and engage in discussion with people 
likely to ask searching questions and to 
challenge demonstrably false answers. For-
eign visitors of high enough status to rate 
a meeting with members of the top Chinese 
leadership can obtain some private discus-
sion; but the ordinary visitor finds that his 
Chinece contacts are very reluctant to go 
beyond polite small talk or repetitions of the 
official propaganda line. 
This unwillingness of the Peiping author-
ities to allow the type of contacts which 
could promote mutual knowledge and under-
standing is not a random caprice. Such 
dislike of meaningful outside contacts is 
characteristic of Stalinist regimes which are 
quite logical in believing them to be sub-
versive. The view of the world presented by 
Chinese Communist statements is highly dis-
torted and could not be defended in reasoned 
argument with an informed non-Communist. 
On the few occasions when the Chinese Com-
munist leaders have engaged in such dis-
cussions they have only been able to escape 
from embarrassing positions by pointedly 
changing the subject. To allow discussion 
with people likely to press serious questions 
would, therefore, weaken the prestige of the 
present leadership. (I am not claiming that 
the present U.S. position is entirely defensi-
ble, but the situation is not symmetrical. 
The United States does not make the same 
claims of infallibility for the thought of 
President Johnson as the Chinese People's 
Republic makes for the though of Chairman 
Mao.) Similarly, it is very likely that mu-
tual knowledge would be very damaging to 
the present Chinese Communist leaders by 
showing that the system for which they have 
demanded immense efforts and sacraflces 
from the Chinese people does not really have 
the advantages which they claim for it. 
(E.g., the available evidence indicates that 
the agrarian collectives and communes of 
the Chinese Communist programs have been 
much less successful in raising food produc-
tion than the reformist land policies of Tai-
wan and Japan.) Thus, any practical pro-
posals for promoting contacts and discussion 
of a kind likely to produce mutual under-
standing and knowledge should reckon with 
the opposition of those who now dominate 
the Chinese Communist leadership. There 
is nothing in your material to suggest that 
you have thought about this problem. 
All this does not mean that nothing can 
e done to improve present U.S. Far Eastern 
policy, but any useful suggestion of alter-
natives must be based on much more serious 
hinking than you have apparently been wili-
ng to give to the subject. A curious feature

without question the same implicit limita-

sot is defense. it is quite likely that the 
United States may need to respond to sud-
den changes in the Chinese situation within 
the next few years. The death of Mao Tse-
Lung (born 1593) might well produce changes 
as great anu as unforeseen as the death of 
Stalin did in Russia. I would suggest that

Bastern policy should give a very high prior-

will have to be met by the private sector. 
Both public and private sources are go-
ing to be hard pressed to meet the out-
door recreation activity which is expected 
to triple by the year 2,000, but public 
expenditures can be reduced by encour-
aging private investment. The most ef-
fective way to accomplish this is by a 
technical service extension as envisioned 
by this legislation. 
The proposed program would authorize 
the Secretary of the Interior to enter 
into cooperative agreements with appro-
priate officials of the 50 States, and the 
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 
the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American 
Samoa to provide technical assistance in 
outdoor recreation to private enterprise 
and to local governments. The States 
would hire the technicians to carry out 
the work. The Federal Government 
would share up to 50 percent of the cost 
of such services. Thus, the pivotal role 
of the States in the outdoor recreation 
field would be maintained. 
In certain cases where local govern-
ments have the capabilities, the States 
would be authorized to transfer Federal 
funds to local governmental units to 
enable such local bodies to provide the 
technical service to the private sector. 
This may be desirable for highly urban-
ized areas. 
The cooperative agreement with each 
State would spell out in advance the pro-
cedures and criteria for carrying out the 
work in that State. It would include 
such things as the extent of Federal 
financial participation up to 50 percent 
of the total cost, how the work is to be 
done, agreement that competent tech-
nicians would be assigned to the work, 
character of the services to be provided, 
extent of services to any one recipient, 
what precautions are to be taken to 
avoid competition with private consult-
ants in outdoor recreation where such 
services are available and similar points. 
Within the framework on the legislation, 
the cooperative agreements may be var-
ied to fit particular State needs or con-
ditions. 
Apportionment of Federal funds among 
the participating States would be deter-
mined only after consultation with a 
committee of not less than five State offi-
cials selected by all the participating 
States. 
In large measure, the prdPosal is pat-
terned after the existing and highly suc-
cessful cooperative forest management 
program. 
It is estimated that an average of 5 
employees would be needed in each State 
at the State level and an average of 15 
employees per State at local governmen-
tal levels, or a total of about 1,100 em-
ployees to carry out the program. Thus, 
the annual cost of the work in the States 
using State and local government em-
ployees would amount to about $15 mil-
lion, at least half of which would be 
borne by the States. In addition, about 
20 employees would be needed for admin-
istrative purposes at the Federal gov-
ernmental level, or about $400,000 an-
nually. 
The proposed legislation carries an 
authorization limitation of $10 million 
for the Federal share of the program.

YN 
ACCELERAiTED ECONOMIC, SOCIAL 
AID FOR VIETNAM 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I send to 
the desk a joint resolution and ask unani-
mous consent that it lie on the desk for 
1 week for additional cosponsors. 
I introduce this joint resolution on 
behalf of myself and the Senator from 
West Virginia [Mr. RANDOLPH]. The 
resolution is intended to trigger a for-
mal, full-scale congressional debate, in-
cluding committee hearings, on what is 
now a new United States-Vietnam pol-
icy. 
It would support current administra-
tion policy, but call for an accelerated 
program for economic and social de-
velopment of South Vietnam. 
I invite the attention of Senators to 
the fact that the Senato: from West Vir-
ginia [Mr. RANDOLPH] and I first intro-
duced a joint resolution seeking to bring 
this about in June 1965. Since that 
time, in and out of session, I have done 
my utmost to bring about Senate discus-
sion on it. I believe this is long over-
due, and that the Committee on Foreign 
Relations, which has been reluctant to 
give hearings on it, ought to hold hear-
ings as soon as current developments with 
respect to the Security Council at the 
United Nations is over, which will be 
within the next few years. 
For more than a year, the administra-
tion has not come to Congress for a sup-
port resolution on our Vietnam policy, 
and as a result this struggle in Asia 
seems to many people to be without nec-
essary congressional sanction. It is the 
duty of the President and the Congress 
to face in public debate the consequences 
of the vast changes that have occurred 
since the Bay of Tonkin resolution of 
August 1964. The old resolution is now 
outdated by events. The sense of Con-
gress on Vietnam should be established 
as clearly before the Nation and the 
world as is the position of the President. 
I have no doubt that such a resolution 
would result in unification of our policy 
with the overwhelming support of the 
American people. 
More than a year and a half 
has passed since the congressional reso-
lution of August 10, 1964; since our ships 
were attacked in the Bay of Tonkin. We 
can hardly recognize the Vietnam of 
today from the picture then. 
Then, it seemed the Saigon govern-
ment, wracked with internal dissention 
and lacking in popular support, would 
not outlast the monsoons. Today, there 
is, at least, a measure of stability in the 
Saigon government. 
Then, the Vietcong seemed able to de-
feat South Vietnamese units, take their 
arms, and live off the land. Now, they 
have been joined in large numbers by 
North Vietnamese regulars and both are 
dependent on Hanoi for supplies; and 
the South Vietnamese forces have shown 
great ability to fight. 
Then, the United States was unclear 
in its objectives and uncertain as to how 
to achieve them. More soldiers and 
more speeches, however, did not provide 
an answer. Today, our goals?freedom 
of choice for the South Vietnamese, eco-
nomic advancement and social reform, a 
stable peace, freedom from fear, return 
to the Geneva accords, and preventing 
the overthrow of governments by terror 
and force?are clear; our means, uncon-
ditional discussions and honorable ne-
gotiations?are unmistakably sincere 
and serious to all who will listen. 
Then, the United States only had 
21.000 advisers in South Vietnam. Right 
now, there are approximately 200,000 
American soldiers fighting in that coun-
try and this number, it is predicted, will 
almost double in a few months. 
It is the duty of the President and the 
Congress to face in public debate the 
consequences of the vast changes that 
have occurred since the Gulf of Tonkin 
resolution. The President should know 
the sense of Congress on Vietnam. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
time of the Senator has expired. 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, may I 
proceed for 2 additional minutes? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, the Senator may proceed for 
2 additional minutes. 
Mr. JAVITS. The country and the 
morale of our troops in Vietnam would 
benefit from a unified policy of the Presi-
dent and the Congress on Vietnam. 
Committee hearings and debate should 
be employed to bring this about. 
The argument is made that a substan-
tive debate may give false indications of 
irresolution on the American position on 
the Vietnamese struggle. In this respect, 
I believe far more serious results could 
follow from isolated statements which 
even distort the meaning and intent of 
those who make them. A considered de-
bate, especially if it is designed to result 
in a deliberate question?duly voted on?
is much the preferred way to proceed. 
Any question about military security 
In the course of the debate should cer-
tainly be fully answered by the outstand-
ing record of the Congress in the past 
and by the record of joint committees 
and committees of both Houses, handling 
on a daily basis information of the high-
est security classification. 
The President has no reason to fear 
such a debate; indeed, I have every con-
fidence that consideration of the resolu-
tion we propose today would greatly 
strengthen his position. It would, I be-
lieve, also put the Congress on record as 
favoring the large-scale, coordinated 
programs of economic and social con-
struction that are so vital if the Vietna-
mese people are to be able to establish 
a viable and stable government of their 
own choosing. 
The Congress has been discussing U.S. 
policy in Vietnam only in a sporadic way, 
and I believe, focusing on transitory

canr.ery. 
The people of Angoon have other very 
heavy indebtedness for individual loans 
to the fishermen of the community for 
purchase of the fishing boats which are 
their only means of making a living. A 
fishing boat is a necessity for the men of 
Angoon and in order to acquire their 
boats the Angoon Community Associa-
tion has become indebted in an amount 
of $539,252.09 to the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, in addition to the debt owed on 
the disastrous cannery project. 
The people of Angoon cannot, in the 
foreseeable future, be expected to pay 
the federal Government the total indebt-
edness estimated at nearly $1 million. I 
suggest this fact of life might as well be 
recognized by the Department of Inte-
rior :and by Congress and that the neces-
sary authority be conferred upon the 
Seer etary of Interior to release the part 
of Angoon's debt attributable to the cost 
of the unfortunate cannery. 
ask unanimous consent that a reso-
lution of the Angoon Community Asso-
ciation dealing with this matter be in-
serted in the RECORD at the close of these 
remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
will be received and appropriately re-
ferred; and, without objection, the reso-
lution will be printed in the RECORD. 
The bill (S. 2862) to release the com-
munity of Angoon, Alaska, from certain 
indebtedness, introduced by Mr. GREEN-
ING, was received, read twice by its title, 
and referred to the Committee on the

to relieve the Angoon Community Association

cannpry which was destroyed by fire and for 
the purchase of fishing boats. 
Sc of the last fiscal year, on March 31, 
1965, the Angoon Community Association 
owed the Federal Government $467,543.28 for 
the Hood Bay Salmon Cannery. This can-
nery was destroyed by tire on February 16, 
1961. It is now of no value to the people of 
in addition, the Angoon Community As-
sociathin, as of March 31, 1965, owed the 
Federal Government $539,252.09, which was 
used for the purchase of boats. Most of the 
boats are now old and in need of repair. 
due the Federal Government is 
$1.006.795.37. 
lbs requirement of iepaying these loans 
wilts interest places a heavy burden on the 
iIngoDn community and its people. Work is 
seasonal in the community, since most of 
the men are fishermen and earn their liveli-
hood from fishing in the summer for salmon. 
The men and women must make enough in 
the iiummer to carry them through the 
winter. 
'So illustrate how onerous this burden can 
become, last summer the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs required the Hawk Inlet cannery to 
whom all Angoon fishermen took their 
catches to deduct from the payment for 
fish a total of VA shares. Payment for fish-
ing is based on a share system. The captain 
receives 11/2 shares, and each member of the 
crew, usually five to seven men, receives one 
Aram. In a six-man beat this would total 
shares for captain and crew, as against 
the 71/2 shares retained by the BIA. 
The people of Angoon earnestly appeal to 
their Representatives in Congress to help 
them; and to pass legislation to relieve them 
of this obligation to the Federal Government, 
to allow them to make enough to repair 
their boats and equipment and to have a 
better chance to make an adequate living for 
themselves and their children.

JANUARY 24, 1066. 
OUTDOOR RECREATION BILL 
Mr. MOSS. Mr. President, I am today 
introducing a bill to authorize a joint 
Federal-State program?financed on a 
50-50 basis?to provide technical serv-
ices and advice to private landowners, 
enterpreneurs, agencies, organizations 
and local governments in developing and 
managing outdoor recreation areas. 
State and local employees would provide 
the services with the Federal Govern-
ment sharing the cost. 
This bill has been recommended by 
the National Association of State Park 
Directors as a supplement to the Land 
and Water Conservation Act of 1965. 
This act, as you all know, assists States 
and Federal agencies to develop pro-
grams which will meet the need of the 
American people for more present and 
future outdoor recreation facilities. 
In preparing proposals to take- ad-
vantage of the grants offered in the Land 
and Water Conservation Act; ma:ny 
States have found that there is a gap 
in the technical assistance available to 
local governments. This has been true 
in my State of Utah. Mr. F. C. Koziol, 
director of the Utah State Park and 
Recreation Commission, has advised me: 
Our experience in developing a State mas-
ter plan for Utah has convinced me that ad-
ditional support at the Federal level for 
technical assistance is necessary. Outside of 
the larger and more populated counties in 
our State, technical assistance for counties 
for planning their outdoor recreation oppor-
tunities is woefully lacking. At present, ex-
cept through the limited facilities of our 
commission and the Agriculture Extension 
Service, counties and municipalities have no 
opportunity to get the benefit of professional 
planners in the development of their recrea-
tional services and programs. . 
The "technical assistance gap" as it 
has been called, needs to be closed since 
implementation of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund Act is necessarily 
somewhat slow. It is dependent upon 
funds available from recreation receipts, 
and how quickly and comprehensively 
States can make their recreation plans. 
As of January 18, 44 of the 55 States 
and territories eligible had submitted 
proposals for planning, acquisition or 
development of outdoor recreation fa-
cilities. The majority of the proposals 
were for planning grants. About $3 mil-
lion had been allocated. Some few 
States had progressed into the acquisi-
tion or development stages, but some had 
not even completed their statewide plan. 
My State of Utah was one of these. This 
all mea:n.s, of course, that it will be co:n-
siderable time before any substantial 
number of outdoor recreational fa4-nlities 
will actually become available to the 
American people under the program es-
1807 
tablished by the Land and Water Con-
servation Act. The bill I am introducing 
today would give counties and munici-
palities the benefit of professional plan-
ning and help them to coordinate their 
planning with that of the State agency. 
It also has the broader purpose of en-
couraging local governments and the 
private sector to provide additional rec-
reational opportunities, particularly in 
the parts of the country where popula-
tion density is high and public resources 
are limited. This was intended by the 
Outdoor Recreation Resources Review 
Commission, which pointed out: 
Individual initiative and private enterprise 
should continue to be the most important 
force in outdoor recreation, providing many 
and varied opportunities for a vast number 
of people, as well as the goods and services 
used by people in their recreation activities. 
The National Association of State 
Park Directors believes that many pri-
vate landowners and investors would be 
interested in helping to meet the grow-
ing outdoor recreatio:n demands if they 
felt they had a reliable source of tech-
nical assistance and information to 
guide them in the establishment of a 
commercial outdoor recreation enter-
prise where demand is sufficient to re-
turn a profit. Present technical assist-
ance programs to the private sector are 
inadequate because they are limited in 
scope and to a large degree are oriented 
toward helping only the farmer, the 
rural associations and rural landowners. 
The association analyzes the problem 
this way: 
A program of technical assistance is needed 
that will make available to the investor es-
sential information on the potential market 
for the type of enterprise he expects to de-
velop. Only by a sound analysis of existing 
and potential factors such as the size of the 
market; competition from existing suppliers; 
possible complementary or competitive pub-
lic areas or facilities; quality and suitability 
the site under consideration; capacity and 
type of structures and facilities desirable; 
most of construction, maintenance, and op-
eration of the enterprise; and expected re-
turn on the capital investment can the en-
trepreneur attract risk capital. This kind of 
technical assistance is not now available. 
Much of the needed information is specific 
in nature and peculiar to the needs of areas 
or localities within each State. For exam-
ple, it would be impractical, if not impos-
sible, to provide the specific, detailed assist-
ance required on zoning ordinances, sanitary 
codes, facility design, liability laws, insur-
ance requirements and the like, at the 
Federal level. However, Federal support is 
needed to assist States in providing technical 
recreation services and advice to private 
landowners, entrepreneurs, agencies, organi-
zations, and local governments with respect 
to the management and development of 
areas for public outdoor recreation. 
You will remember that this need was 
recognized by the Senate Interior and 
Insular Affairs Committee and mentioned 
in the Senate report on the Bureau of 
Outdoor Recreation Act?Public Law 88: 
29. 
Exclusive of Alaska, approximately 
three-fourths of the Nation's land is in 
private ownership. Near population 
centers, less than 5 percent of the land 
is privately owned. If the Nation's out-
door recreation needs are to be met, 
therefore, a large proportion of them

stable, responsive, and just government; 
and, second, the size and character of 
the total military effort in Vietnam and 
where it is taking us. 
We urge our colleagues to join us in 
making such a debate possible through 
consideration of the resolution we intro-
duce today. 
We believe the more support the joint 
resolution has in the way of cosponsors, 
the more likely it will have the attention 
of the committee and assure debate on 
the floor of the Senate. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the joint resolution be printed 
in the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
joint resolution will be received and ap-
propriately referred; and, without objec-
tion, the joint resolution will be printed 
in the RECORD and will lie on the desk, as 
requested by the Senator from New York. 
The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 134) to 
promote the maintenance of interna-
tional peace and security in southeast 
Asia and to supplement Public Law 88-
408, introduced by Mr. JAVITS (for him-
self and Mr. RANDOLPH) , was received, 
read twice by its title, referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations, and 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 
S.J. RES. 134 
Whereas the Congress by joint resolution 
approved August 10, 1964, declared that it 
"approves and supports the determination of 
the President, as Commander in Chief, to 
take all necessary measures to repel any 
armed attack against the forces of the United 
States and to prevent further aggression" 
and further declare that "The United States 
regards as vital to its national interest and 
to world peace the maintenance of interna-
tional peace and security in southeast Asia" 
and "is, therefore, prepared, as the President 
determines, to take all necessary steps, in-
cluding the use of armed force, to assist any 
member of protocol state of, the Southeast 
Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting 
assistance in defense of its freedom:" and 
Whereas the deliberate and systematic 
campaign of aggression that the Communist 
regime in North Vietnam is waging against 
its neighbors and the nations joined with 
them in the collective defense of their free-
dom has risen in intensity and constitutes 
a threat to international peace and security; 
and 
Whereas the people of South Vietnam con-
tinue to desire the assistance of the United 
States in protecting their freedom and their 
right to be left in peace to work out their 
own destiny in their own way; and 
Whereas the United States, without ter-
ritorial, military, or political ambitions of 
its own, has labored continuously and dili-
gently for unconditional discussions and ne-
gotiations, but has received no positive re-
sponse for these efforts from North Vietnam 
or its allies; and 
Whereas North Vietnam has used the ces-
sation of bombing in the North to intensify 
aggression against South Vietnam, requiring 
the United States so materially to increase 
the means for defense against such aggres-
sion, including the use of the Armed Forces, 
as to make advisable a further joint resolu-
BiostwpR400020010-5 
tion of approval and support by the Con-
gress: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America 
in Congress assembled, That the Congress ap-
proves and supports the determination of the 
President as Commander in Chief, in con-
tinuing the role of the United States in pro-
moting and maintaining international peace 
and security in southeast Asia. 
Sac. 2. The United States declares its de-
termination, consonant with the Constitu-
tion of the United States and the Charter 
of the United Nations and in accordance with 
its obligations under the Southeast Asia Col-
lective Defense Treaty, to take all necessary 
steps, including the use of armed force, as 
the President determines for the purposes 
set forth in section 3 to assist any member 
or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Col-
lective Defense Treaty requesting assistance 
in defense of its freedom. 
SEC. 3. The United States affirms that the 
objectives of the 'United States are to bring 
about the cessation of hostilities by cease-fire 
or other appropriate means and the restora-
tion of peace, tranquillity, and security, and 
the observance of international treaties and 
agreements in South Vietnam, and to assist 
South Vietnam in obtaining a full oppor-
tunity for self-determination, religious free-
dom, economic and social progress, the es-
tablishment and strengthening of free 
institutions, and the enjoyment of friendly 
relations with its neighbors. 
SEC. 4, The United States declares that it 
is prepared to engage in unconditional dis-
cussions and honorable negotiations, when-
ever and wherever there is any willingness 
by the other appropriate parties to do so. 
SEC. 5. The United States recognizes the 
real struggle in Vietnam must center around 
the needs and desires of the Vietnamese 
people for economic advancement and social 
change, and that to these ends, the Congress 
declares that it will support accelerated, en-
larged, and coordinated efforts by the people 
of South Vietnam with the aid of the United 
States to care for the refugees, and to attain 
the benefits of land tenure reform and uti-
lization, education, health, housing, roads, 
markets, and the administration of justice. 
SEC. 6. The United States regards inter-
national action to assure conditions of peace, 
security, freedom, and self-determination in 
South Vietnam to be most desirable and is 
ready to join with other appropriate parties 
in assuring the maintenance of international 
peace and applying within that area the 
principles and provisions of the United Na-
tions Charter, through the utilization of the 
United Nations, of other international orga-
nizations, or otherwise. 
SEC. 7. This resolution shall expire when 
the President shall determine that the peace 
and security of the area is reasonably as-
sured by international conditions created by 
action of the United Nations or otherwise, 
except that it may be terminated earlier by 
concurrent resolution of the Congress. 
Mr. JAVITS subsequently said: Mr. 
President, this morning, on behalf of 
myself and the Senator from West Vir-
ginia [Mr. RANDOLPH] , and at the very 
close of the morning hour, I introduced 
a joint resolution on Vietnam which I 
hoped would result in the President's re-
questing authority which I felt he should 
request from Congress. 
I ask unanimous consent that the joint 
resolution may lie at the desk for 1 week 
to permit other Senators who may wish 
to do so to become cosponsors. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. JAVITS. Because the President 
has not sought such authority, the Sen-
ator from West Virginia and I have in-
troduced the joint 
form as we believe 
sented. 
Unavoidably the 
Virginia was not in 
1809 
resolution in such 
it ought to be pre-
Senator from West 
the Chamber at the 
moment the resolution was submitted. 
I now yield to the Senator from West 
Virginia. 
Mr. RANDOLPH. Mr. President, I am 
deeply appreciative of the comments just 
made by the distinguished Senator from 
New York. 
The senior Senator from New York 
has noted from time to time in the 
Chamber?and recalled again last Fri-
day in a thought-provoking and infor-
mative report on Vietnam?that he is 
an "ardent advocate of a full-scale con-
gressional debate on Vietnam." 
The Senator from New York stated 
that he and the Senator from West Vir-
ginia now speaking introduced in June 
of 1965 Senate Joint Resolution 93. We 
offered it with the suggestion that it be 
a focal point for reasoned debate of which 
I, too, am an advocate. 
We jointly requested the Foreign Re-
lations Committee to hold hearings an 
the resolution we offered, but without 
success. I share the view of the senior 
Senator from New York that it is un-
derstandable if the chairman and mem-
bers of the Foreign Relations Committee 
feel that they should not engender hear-
ing and debate on such a sensitive issue 
unless the President wishes such debate 
to take place. Our currently proposed 
resolution is a newly suggested focal 
point. 
But, because I am as convinced as is 
our colleague from New York that the 
country supports the President, I feel no 
hesitancy in cosponsoring the new Sen-
ate Joint Resolution 134 "to promote the 
maintenance of international peace and 
security in southeast Asia and to supple-
ment Public Law 88-408." 
Even among citizens supporting the 
President on the Vietnam issue there are 
questions and misgivings susceptible of 
being mitigated or overcome. Hence, I 
believe, as Senator JAVITS has declared, 
that "if Congress is brought into closer 
partnership with the President on this 
issue, it is likely that the country will be 
very much more in favor of our policy." 
Congress joined the President in pass-
ing the resolution he requested in Au-
gust 1964. In the light of the many sig-
nificant subsequent developments, we feel 
the provisions of that resolution?Pub-
lic Law 88-408?need supplementation. 
Certainly there should not be repeal of 
the August 10, 1964, resolution, as has 
been proposed in one measure introduced 
In this body last week. 
The late U.S. Ambassador to the United 
Nations, Adlai Stevenson, said: 
Let's talk sense to the American people. 
Let's tell them the truth, that there are no 
gains without pains. 
The President certainly has made this 
clear. I believe debate of the issue in 
Congress through consideration of such 
a resolution as we offer?although not 
developing unanimous agreement?would 
reflect a more overwhelming congres-
sional and public consensus for U.S. 
policy than now seems on the surface to 
prevail. The differences over tactics and

strategy and in degree of support too 
often discolor the picture and in some 
instances indicate more splinters than 
consensus. What is needed is a rallying 
point?a real focal point for a meaning-
ful debate. I do not believe this would 
weaken the position of the Commander 
in Chief, nor do I believe it would result 
in any substantial deviation from the 
policies he has ordered and proclaimed. 
If I did not believe hearings and de-
bate on the issues inherent in the pro-
posed joint resolution would strengthen 
support for our President and for U.S. 
policy in Vietnam and southeast Asia, 
and if I did not have faith that the un-
derstanding and resolve of our citizens 
would be improved by debate in the best 
traditions of our democratic way of life, 
1 would not be a cosponsor. But I do 
not shun this joint resolution through 
negativism; I embrace it with an affirma-
tive attitude. 
Lt is my judgment that the time has 
come for the Senate to enter into rea-
soned debate because there have been so 
many diverse opinions expressed by so 
many individual Senators that the Sen-
ate as a body is somewhat in a posture of 
disarray and presents a blurred image of 
itself as a deliberative body and of the 
Government's Vietnam policy. There is 
a need for both clarification and a greater 
degree of unification of the people's 
Government. We are sorely in need of 
unity of purpose. If there ever was a 
Lime when the executive and the legis-
lative branches needed to be in harmony, 
it is now. 
Mr. President, I am very happy to join 
the diligent and knowledgeable senior 
Senator from New York [Mr. SJAVITS I in 
introdueing Senate Joint Resolution 193. 
As I conclude, I invite attention to an 
editorial and a column written by Rich-
ard Fryklund, both published in the 
Washington Evening Star of yesterday, 
February 1, .H66. They are pertinent 
Lu our discussion and reflect a degree of 
optimism that is worthy of attention and 
consideration. I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed at this point in the 
RECORD excerpts from the editorial, en-
titled "His 'Clear Duty,'" and Mr. Fryk-
lund's column entitled "Viet Buildup 
May Be Nearing End." 
There being no objection, the editorial 
and article were ordered to be printed 
in the RECORD, as follows: 
From the levelling Star, Feb. I, 19661 
lir; ilniaR DUTY 
:fa deciding to order a resumption of bomb-
ing of military targets in North Vietnam, Mr. 
Johnson did what had to be done. As Presi-
dent and as Commander in Chief, conscious 
of his responsibility to some 200,000 American 
troops as well as the soldiers of our allies, 
who are under attack by a relentless foe, he 
could not have done otherwise. 
Obviously, it was not an easy decision to 
make. And the President, even while giv-
ing the order for the bombers to take off, re-
newed his pledge that tne search for a just 
aettlement will go on. One aspect of the 
quest is the arbitration proposal which 
Ambassador Goldberg has put before the U.N. 
Security Council. There is no occasion, how-
ever, for soaring hopes on this score. Dur-
ing the bomting pause, which lasted for 37 
days, the Communists not only pressed ahead 
with the fighting; they also used the oppor-
tunity to redeploy their soldiers, bring up 
supplies, and repair the damage done to behind the present buildup and its projected 
their transportation system. To have per-
mitted this to go on indefinitely as some 
urged, could only have resulted in heavier 
American and allied casualties. To his 
credit, his critics notwithstanding, the Presi-
dent was unwilling to pay this price. As 
he put it, it is our "clear duty" to do what 
we can to limit the casualty rolls which, in 
any event, will be long. 
What is to be said of the critics, especially 
those in the Senate? 
In 1776 Thomas Paine wrote that 'these 
are the times that try men's :souls." He also 
paid his respects to "the summer soldier and 
the sunshine patriot" who, in the crisis of 
that day, shrank from the demands et the 
war for freedom. If Paine were living now 
he might have something to say about sun-
shine Senators. 
It is not our purpose to be invidious in 
suggesting this. But last week's spectacle in 
the Senate was nothing less than astonishing. 
One theme which runs through the criti-
cism is that Congress, when it approved in 
1964 a joint resolution supporting the Pres-
ident's policies, did not quite realize what it 
was all about, didn't quite intend ot author-
ize the President to do precisely what he 
now is doing. Yet the language of the reso-
lution is unambiguous. It puts Congress 
squarely on record as authorizing the Presi-
dent, as he may determine, "to take all neces-
sary steps, including the use of armed I ores," 
to assist South Vietnam in defense of its 
freedom. Pretty hard to wriggle out of an 
endorsement like that. 
The 1964 resolution provides that Congress 
may terminate it by another joint resolution. 
Perhaps this should be brought to a test. 
Let us find out how many Members of Con-
gress, in the face of Ho Chi Minh's adamant 
refusal to discuss peace except o,n his own 
terms, would vote to rescind, the authority 
previously given the President. Let us find 
out what those who might vote for revoca-
tion propose to do about the war, about the 
200,000 American troops who are fighting the 
battle, and whether they intend to weesh on 
our Nation's commitment to a free choice for 
South Vietnam. 
Our guess is that such a resolution could 
not muster a corporal's guard in Congress. 
If this is so, there should be an end to aimless 
speeches and protests which serve no better 
purpose than to undermine the President 
and to encourage the enemy. 
[From the Evening Star, Feb. 1, 19661 
WASHINGTON CLOSE-UP?VIET BUILDS r' MAY 
BE NEARING END 
(By Richard Fryklund) 
conclusions a few months from now: 
The plans grew out of the dashed hopes 
of last summer. The Pentagon thought 
there was a chance then that a demonstra-
tion of allied ability to win battles would be 
enough to induce the Communist side to 
fade away. 
The battles were won as the American 
Forces grew to 100,000, then 125,000, but the 
Vietcong just fought harder, and North Viet-
nam increased its infiltration of regular army 
troops. 
By fall it was clear that our side had to 
base its plans on the enemy's maximum 
capability and not assume that lie would 
have the good sense to give in before he was 
defeated. 
Calculations of an enemy's potential are 
difficult, but the logisticians on our side be-
lieve now that North Vietnam and the Viet-
cong cannot man, equip, and continue to 
supply a fighting force that numbers more 
than about 300,000 men. 
The plan here is to organize an allied force 
that can handle that kind of enemy. 
"Handle" does not mean a quick victory. 
It means rather that our side would be 
strong enough to carry on large-scale offen-
sive operations without a letup. 
Right now our side can only guard its own 
bases and throw hit-and-run raids at the 
enemy. 
Only one-half of the American servicemen 
in South Vietnam have combat as their pri-
mary job?although almost all of them have 
to fight at least part of the time in order 
to hold on to their enclaves. 
More than half of the combat specialists 
are needed to protect the bases. Only a 
quarter of the American force, then, can go 
out on "search and destroy" operatiolis in 
areas thought to hold enemy bases. 
Search and destroy is a vital part of the 
military operation. It makes the Vietcong 
run and it destroys. a lot of Vietcong equip-
ment. But it does not seize and hold any 
new territory. 
What is needed is an occupation of Viet-
cong areas. To achieve this, our side must 
have enough troops and supplies to main-
tain a steady flow of equipment and rotat-
ing soldiers in endless offensive operations. 
As the Vietcong are pushed and harassed 
and shooed, they will have to leave parts of 
the roughly one-half of South Vietnam 
which they now control. As they move out, 
local government units would be created be-
hind the military shield. 
This has been their preferred grand strat-
egy since it was discovered last fall that 
mere demonstrations of proficiency would 
not be enough. 
But before it could be implemented, a vast 
logistics base had to be created. American. 
construction crews, military and civilian, 
have been building and expanding ports, 
supply depots, airfields, barracks, rOads, and 
air-transport networks. 
When the construction is largely finished 
this spring it will support a force big enough 
to carry out the sustained offensive opera-
tion. 
As the logistics base is completed, some of 
the construction soldiers can go home and 
more fighting men can come in. 
Exactly where the buildup will level of 
cannot, of course, be predicted accurately. 
The final orders to move have not been given 
to many units at home already alerted for 
duty in Vietnam. But 300,000 is now con-
sidered to be a guess on the high side. 
If the enemy surprises us with a substan-
tially larger effort than is now thought pos-
sible, our base will be able to deliver quickly 
and support indefinitely several more Amer-
ican combat divisions (the equivalent of 
about five are there now). 
But if present estimates work out. the war 
could start showing progress this summer. 
Victory, though, would be a long grind away. 
The end of the American buildup in South 
Vietnam could be a lot closer than most :peo-
ple think, both in time and in numbers. 
If Communist China does not enter the 
war, and. if Pentagon calculations of poten-
tial enemy strength are right, it could level 
out this spring or early summer consider-
ably below the 300,000 mark. 
There are now about 200,000 American 
military men in South Vietnam. Sonic; Con-
gressmen have predicted a buildup to more 
than 400,000. 
But the Pentagon believes that fewer than 
300,000 will be enough?along with the 7th 
Fleet at sea, the South Vietnamese forces 
and South Korean, Australian, and New Zea-
land units?to push back the biggest armies 
the Vietcong and North Vietnamese can field 
m the south. 
If that calculation proves wrong, however, 
the planned 'force will have provided a base 
able to support a quick, massive buildup. 
Plans do change in Washington, and calcu-
lations go wrong. But here is the reasoning

RESIDUAL FUEL OIL CONTROLS 
SHOULD BE ABOLISHED 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, for many 
years I have been deeply concerned with 
the residual fuel oil import quota pro-
gram and have, on repeated occasions, 
fought hard for the complete elimination 
of these controls. These controls cause 
great hardship to millions of New York-
ers and others living on the east coast 
of the United States. The Director of the 
Office of Emergency Planning, first in 
1963, and then on December 18, 1965,,ad-
vised that control of these imports could 
be relaxed without impairment to the 
national security. Yet the administra-
tion refuses to lift its controls, even 
though the level of imports have been 
raised modestly for the current fuel oil 
year. In addition to the anticompetitive 
situation caused by these controls, they 
have also resulted in increasing the fuel 
oil costs of millions of city dwellers, 
schools, hospitals and many Federal and 
State installations, who have no alter-
nate choice of fuel. These consumers, 
who have been bearing the brunt of U.S. 
Government sponsored price premiums, 
now find themselves faced, by even 
higher prices, caused by the setting up of 
price controls in Venezuela, with the re-
sult that for New York State alone, the 
additional cost may be as high as $25 mil-
lion per year. 
In my view, and in the view of my col-
leagues from east coast States, the best 
solution to the whole residual fuel oil im-
port problem would be the removal of 
controls. 
I am pleased to note that several Con-
gressmen and Senators from various east 
coast States have arranged to met today 
with the heads of interested departments 
to urge removal of these controls. I fully 
support their action. I also understand 
that a committee composed of Senators 
and Representatives from New England 
and other east coast States is being 
formed to deal with this problem on 
the broadest possible basis. I fully 
support this move as I believe that only 
through a concerted effort can we make 
our concern felt. 
We are about to start a new fuel oil 
year. I strongly urge the President, the 
Attorney General, the Secretary of In-
terior, the Director of the Office of Emer-
gency Planning to review once more the 
overwhelming evidence developed over 
the years against residual fuel oil import 
controls and to abolish" these controls 
prior to the start of the new fuel oil 
year?April 1.

SUPPORT FOR LAW AND ORDER?
RESOLUTION OF SAN JACINTO 
DISTRICT BOARD OF THE TEXAS 
FEDERATION OF WOMEN'S CLUBS 
Mr. TOWER. Mr. President, the San 
Jacinto District Board of the Texas Fed-
eration of Women's Clubs recently 
adopted a resolution of support for law 
and order in this Nation. Since this 
group is so representative of our women's 
clubs in Texas, I ask unanimous consent 
that a copy of the resolution be inserted 
at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the resolu-
tion was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
"The members of the San Jacinto District, 
Texas Federation of Women's Clubs in ses-
sion October 21, 1965, deplore the ugly image 
that is being presented to the world by law-
less demonstrations, marches, and riots. 
This is indicative of the lack of patriotism 
and devotion to our country. As loyal Amer-
icans we wish to impress upon our Repre-
sentatives in Washington our desire to firmly 
stand behind them in their enforcement of 
law and order. We cannot stress too strongly 
the need for stamping out this seditious 
ugliness that is growing in the United States 
of America. We strongly urge investigation 
of this communistically inspired attack that 
is growing more vicious each day. We ask 
that the Texas Federation Of Women's Clubs 
and the General Federation of Women's Clubs 
take similar action in demanding enforce-
ment of law and order as presented by this

EDITORIAL IN DEFENSE OF PRES-
ENT 2-YEAR TERM FOR MEMBERS 
OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. TOWER. Mr. President, the Fort 
Worth Star Telegram of January 23, 
1966, carried an excellent editorial in 
defense of the present 2-year term for 
Congressmen. 
I ask unanimous consent that the text 
of the editorial be printed at this point 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editor-
ial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
FOUR-YF.AR TERM NEEDS LONG STUDY 
President Johnson's proposal for an 
amendment to the Constitution giving 
Members of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives 4-year terms, instead of 2, should be 
considered long and cautiously. 
What is at issue here is a part of the basic 
structure of American government?a part 
included in that structure by the Founding 
Fathers purposely and with good reason. 
President Johnson has offered reasons for 
changing it as he proposes. But there are 
arguments for not doing so, and there are 
many unanswered questions as to how the 
altered system would function and whether 
It would better serve the interests of the 
Nation and the people. 
Since all Members of the House, under the 
administration proposal, would be elected at 
the same time as the President, one fault 
in the proposed new system is immediately 
apparent. The winning presidential candi-
date would tend to sweep his party's House 
candidates into office with him. Almost 
Invariably, the result would be control of 
the House and the executive branch by the 
same political party. This could serve to 
stifle the voice of the opposition and under-
mine the two-party system.

The 4-year House terms would mean that 
the favorable House that came in with the 
President would be at his disposal through-
out his term. The so-called midterm elec-
tion would automatically be canceled. 
In planning the structure as it now exists, 
the framers of the Constitution incorpo-
rated an ingenious system of checks and 
balances. The '2-year House term gives the 
President the probable benefit of a coopers-
Sive House during the first half of his term. 
hit it also compels him, in effect, to return 
to the people at the halfway mark for ap-
proval?or disapproval---Of his conduct of 
he executive branch. 
Accountability of public officials to the 
people is a fundamental principle of repre-
sentative government. Mr. Johnson pointe 
out that communications are better now than 
when the Constitution was drafted and says 
She midterm election is. not needed for con-
veying the will of the people to Congress. 
lint communication and accountability are 
quite different things, and it is the latter 
that would suffer most under the proposed 
change, though truthfully nothing commu-
nicates more effectively to a politician than 
a constituent's vote for the opposition. 
Mr. Johnson's four basic reasons for pro-
posing the 4-year change are: (1) to provide 
;louse Members a sufficient period to work 
ott the great questions before Congress; (2) 
to free Members from the pressures of cam-
paigning, thus allowing them more time 
for their work; (1) to reduce the cost of elec-
tion to congressional office; (4) to attract the 
hest men into competition for House 
membership. 
It has been proved that Members who do 
heir work in a manner pleasing to their 
constituents can be returned for Many terms. 
in fact, several present House Members have 
:airved longer than any Member of the Senate, 
where the term is 6 years. 
the President's other three reasons have 
merit. But in the case of each, there are 
ninny alternatives for accomplishing the 
: i:L111.11 objective. These alternatives, and 
ninny other questions raised by the proposal, 
should be meticulously explored before there 
is any decision to alter the basic structure of 
our Government in a way that could weaken 
U.ie system of checks and balances and, con-
ceivably, result in one-party rule. Such 
thoroughgoing study scarcely would leave 
time for action on the subject at this con-
gressional session. 
PROPOSED 4-YEAR TERM FOR MEM-
BERS OF THE: HOUSE OF REPRE-
SENTATIVES 
Mr. '1 OWE R. Mr. President, the 
Wichita Falls Times of January 21, 1966, 
carried a very excellent editorial on the 
subject of the 4-year term. I ask con-
sent that this editorial be printed at this 
point in the RECORD. 
"Mere being- no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
Wow?... YEAR TERms 
loam-year terms for Members of tile House 
of Representatives of Congress will provide 
one of the livelier topics for discussion this 
year. 
'those who bMieye that the Constitution 
provided the perfect framework of govern-
ment will oppose any tampering with the 
historical 2-year term which emerged from 
the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and 
hasn't been changed. 
'those who also take the Constitution lit-
erally, and particularly its preamble, which 
begins, "We, the people of the United States, 
in order to form a more perfect Union" will 
carefully consider the proposal in the light 
of present-day conditions and the foresee-
able future, and make up our minds record-
There are good arguments on both sides of 
the issue which the suggested constitutional 
amendment provokes. 
President Johnson, calling for adoption of 
the amendment, has recited familiar argu-
ments in favor of the longer term: need of 
Congressmen to devote more time to Con-
gress and less to campaigning, the growing 
complexities of legislative work, the induce-
ment to political careers of persons ol the 
highest quality. 
The opposition also is well armed. It was 
the theory of the Constitutional Fathers, in 
compromising on the 2-year term, that Mem-
bers of the House should closely reflect pre-
vailing public opinion and trends. The 
short term also acts as a curb upon both the 
legislative and executive branches of the 
Government by affording the people the op-
portunity to repudiate at midterm unpopu-
lar administrative and congressional actions. 
Actually partisanship has been carefully 
sidestepped in the proposal that Johnson has 
made. President Eisenhower favored 4-year 
terms for Members of the :Rottee, and in 1954 
during his administration such a plan was 
approved by the Senate Judiciary Subcom-
mittee. There are proponents on both sides 
of the aisle, 
ft should be noted that President Johnson 
removed himself and his administration from 
any conflict with the plain by mentioning 
19'72 as the suggested effective date of the 
proposed amendment. That is sufficiently 
distant to be disconnected with the present 
administration and the present Congress. 
In partisan politics, 6 years is a long time 
luso the future. 
One crucial decision, it seems to the 
Times, can provide a 'compromise that will 
go a long way toward preserving the advan-
tages of the 2-year term arid still satisfy the 
arguments for the reform.. That would be 
to provide the 4-year terms for half of the 
43.5-Member House in 1972 and the other 
half in 1974. 
The plan of having only half of the House 
subject to election every 4 years was not 
suggested by President Johnson; neither was 
is rejected. 
Throughout the Nation, longer terms for 
public office at the local, county, district, 
and State level are becoming snore popular. 
Staggered 4-year terms for Members of the 
House of Representatives of Congress might 
be the logical extension cf this trend into 
_Federal offices. 
THE BUDGET FOR THE DISTRICT OF 
COLUMBIA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Mr, MORSE. Mr. President, the budget 
for the District of Columbia public 
schools sent to Congress lby President 
Johnson last week must be viewed with 
mixed emotions. In my judgment, while 
this budget is an improvement over pre-
ceding ones, it still does not properly face 
up to the most important need confront-
ing our Nation?in particular our Na-
tion's Capital?the securing of our fu-
ture through an adequate investment is 
the education of our young people. The 
proposed District school budget is a step 
toward better schools and should in my 
judgment be approved, but it should not 
be considered a prototype for future 
budgets. 
T ask unanimous consent to have 
printed at this point in my remarks the 
proposed model school budget for the 
District of Columbia, which was pre-
sented by Dr. Carl F. Hansen, Superin-
tendent of District of Columbia Public 
Schools to the House Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor in response to a request 
by Representative ROMA.N C. PIWINSKI. 
There being no objection, the proposed 
budget was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JANUARY 10, 1966. 
Hon. ROMAN C. PlICINSKI, 
Longworth Office Building, 
U.S. House of Representatives, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN PUCINSKI: I appreciate 
your invitation to submit a model budget. 
Your requests indicate that the purpose of 
inquiry into the District of Columbia public 
schools is to be constructive. 
My report is analyzed under the following 
main headings: (1) administration; (2) 
school services; (3) improvement of instruc-
tion; (4) special programs; (5) food serv-
ices; (6) operation and maintenance; (7) 
higher education; (8) capital outlay; and 
(9) application of plans. 
The estimates for each element must be 
understood to be tentative and subject to 
considerable change as programs are phased 
in and special facilities are identified. 
1. ADMINISTRATION 
The proposed increases in funding for ad-
ministration are based on today's organiza-
tion. 
The School Board plans a study of admin-
istrative organization to determine what 
changes should be made In alinement of staff 
persons and assignment of duties. 
It is proposed to use a part of title V 
money from the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act to conduct a study of the 
design for administrative reorganization. 
When this is accomplished, it is inevitable 
that the costs of administration will differ 
from the current estimates. 
2. SCHOOL SERVICES 
The Superintendent's staff has premised 
staffing schedules for model school units at 
the elementary, junior high, and senior high 
school levels. The model unit for the ele-
mentary school and the junior high school is 
a school of 1,000, and for the senior high 
school a school of 1,500. The description bf 
staff services, and supplies has been developed 
for each unit for each level. 
The salient features of the model elemen-
tary unit are as follows: 
An increase for staffing in counseling, social 
work, subject fields, shop and home eco-
nomics, and speech and reading. 
Supplying supportive services to teachers 
as clerks, assistants, and aids. 
Staffing for community services to enable 
each school to serve as a community center 
with a director Of community services to co-
ordinate and initiate neighborhood activi-
Ries with lull use of school buildings. 
Reduction in class size in grades 1 to 6 from 
a current ratio of 30 to 1 to a maximum of 
25; in the special academic curriculum to 
a maximum of 15; and in the social adjust-
ment classes to a maximum of 8. 
Establishment of a preschool program with 
is special staff. 
Funds for equipment not now usually sup-
plied, such as typewriters, or fully supplied 
such as record players, television sets, film 
projectors. 
Increases in funds for textbooks, supplies, 
and library books, and allocations of f unds 
for cultural experiences, out-of-school learn-
ing activities for pupils, and field trips for 
members of the staff. 
The chief improvements for the secondary 
schools are as follows: 
Pupil-Leacher ratios reduced from 25 to 1 
to a maximum of 25 in the academic classes, 
with a special provision that in English the 
number shall be no more than 20 per class. 
Ratios in other services will be set at 200 
pupils to 1 counselor; 500 pupils to 1 librar-
ian; a full-time speech correctionist for 
junior and senior high schools, and 1 full-
time social worker for senior high schools. 
In addition teacher aids and other para-
professional will be set up at the rate of 1 
such employee for each 50 pupils.

We can resolve the whole question very 
quickly. It can be done by withdrawing 
the motion to take up. It is that simple. 
There is this question to consider: Is 
compulsory unionism more important 
than the young men who are slogging 
among the insects and the slime and the 
mud of Vietnam? If Vietnam is impor-
tant, good; then let the President come 
down to us and ask us to withdraw it. 
It is that simple. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. DIRKSEN. I yield. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I am looking at the 
calendar. I see nothing on it relating to 
Vietnam. I see on it a joint resolution 
authorizing the President to invite the 
States of the Union and foreign nations 
to participate in the International Petro-
leum Exposition to be held at Tulsa, 
Okla. I see on the calendar a concur-
rent resolution recognizing the 50th 
anniversary of the chartering of the Boy 
Scouts of America. 
I believe the minority leader has the 
emblem on his lapel. 
I see on the calendar a joint resolution 
authorizing an appropriation to enable 
the United States to extend an invita-
tion to the World Health Organization 
to hold the 22d World Health Assembly 
In Boston, Mass. in 1969. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. One reason there 
Is nothing on the calendar is that the 
committees cannot meet. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I would like to see 
the committees meet?all of them. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I beg Senators to 
let the Foreign Relations Committee 
meet. I have not mentioned other ur-
gent matters that need to be considered. 
For example, the Panamanian Treaty, 
which has been a source of much contro-
versy and conflict, ought to be consid-
ered. There are a dozen matters to con-
sider if the Senate is to act on them. We 
ought to let the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee meet. 
It would be easy to have it done and 
have it done under the rules. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. I have no control 
over that. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. There are two 
ways to bring this to a conclusion. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. In response to the 
majority leader, it was the Senator from 
Arkansas who in the course of mention-
ing bills before his committee said that 
there was a request with respect to Viet-
nam. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. They did that, too. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. I did not say there 
were bills. The Senator made that state-
ment and I made my response. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator is 
correct. 
Mr. President, is there objection? 
Mr. DIRKSEN. I shall object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 
objection. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, I 
should like to make a parliamentary in-
quiry. Is it in order for me to object to 
the meeting of the Armed Services Com-
mittee this morning even though it is 
under the guise of the Appropriations 
Committee? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. There is no such 
request before the Senate. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I would like to ob-
ject and to express my objection. I do 
not think it is appropriate that the For-
eign Relations Committee be prohibited 
from meeting while other committees are 
allowed to meet. 
I do not believe that the military ac-
tivities there are a bit more important 
than the military or civilian activities 
designed, we hope, to prevent the esca-
lation of war. 
The Senate is reaching the point where 
the only thing that is important is the 
production of a bigger and better war. 
I do not understand the procedure 
whereby they are allowed to continue 
regardless of the business of anybody 
else. My committee is criticized in the 
press as being ineffectively operated, and 
yet the committee is not permitted to 
meet. This is an intolerable situation. 
Mr. President, is there any way that I 
can bring before the Senate the question 
of the continuation of committee meet-
ings when my committee cannot meet? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. When 
the 3-minute limitation is over the Sen-
ator may make a motion that is debat-
able. - 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. The motion that 
they not meet. Therefore, I object to 
the committees' meeting. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the request? 
Mr. MANSFIELD, Mr. President, I 
object. 
May I say before I start on the re-
marks I would like to make that I would 
object to a request made by any Senator 
to prevent the Armed Services Commit-
tee from meeting or any other commit-
ted from meeting. But as I understand 
the motion, the Armed Services Com-
mittee, even though it is meeting in con-
junction with the Committee on Appro-
priations for Armed Services, is within 
Its rights, due to the fact that the trans-
action of morning business has been 
agreed to, and will be within its rights 
until the morning business is concluded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator is correct. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, may 
I violate the first rule of the morning 
hour and ask to proceed for 3 additional 
minutes? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? The Chair hears no objec-
tion. 
THE AM CONF ICT 
Mr. MA SFIELD. resident, on 
yesterday it s reported in the press 
that the North Vietnamese Foreign Min-
tstry made the following statement: 
The Government of the Democratic Re-
public of Vietnam reaffirms that, on the in-
ternational plane, consideration of Vietnam 
falls within the competence of the 1954 Gen-
eva Conference on Indochina, and not of the 
United Nations Security Council. 
On yesterday, also, the distinguished 
chairman of the Foreign Relations Corn-
1781 
mittee, Mr. FULBRIGHT, stated that we 
call the suggestion of North Vietnam for 
the reconvening of the Geneva Confer-
ence, and today I should like to join him 
in that request. I do so because it rep-
resents my own view and because I know 
this is also the viewpoint of the adminis-
tration. Both the President and the 
Secretary of State have repeatedly said 
that they would agree to discussions on 
the basis of the Geneva Accords of 1954 
and 1962 and further they are prepared 
for a reconvening of the Geneva Confer-
ences. The latest statement to this ef-
fect was made by the President in his 
state of the Union address of January 12, 
which I will refer to later. 
As I stated on Monday, the President 
is to be commended for referring the 
question of a possible settlement of the 
Vietnamese conflict to the United Na-
tions. He is also to be commended for 
the considerate and sympathetic atti-
tude with which he welcomed Pope Paul's 
proposal to seek an end to the Vietnam-
ese difficulty through the arbitration of 
neutral nations. 
It gives me much reassurance and en-
couragement that a man of the caliber 
of Ambassador Arthur Goldberg repre-
sents us at the United Nations at this 
critical time and that he is making, on 
the behalf of the President, the principal 
presentations of our policy on the Viet-
namese situation before the U.N. Secu-
rity Council. I do not know of anyone 
who is better qualified to speak for the 
Nation on the matter than this outstand-
ing and judicious American. 
I am further heartened and encour-
aged by the fact that the United States 
has proposed, through Ambassador 
Goldberg, that both North Vietnam and 
South Vietnam be invited to take part in 
any discussions of a conference to seek 
peace in Vietnam. Obviously, there is 
a need for the participation of all those 
who, in the last analysis, must be parties 
to understanding if the peace is to be re-
stored and maintained. 
Mr. President, I regret to note that, 
according to the press, North Vietnam 
has already declared that it will consider 
as invalid any resolutions of the U.N. 
Security Council on Vietnam. This re-
port is attributed to Tass, the Soviet news 
agency. Tass states further in its dis-
patch from Hanoi that the North Viet-
namese Foreign Ministry has declared 
that "only the 1954 Geneva Conference 
on Indochina is competent" to deal with 
the Vietnamese situation. 
One would hope, Mr. President, that 
no possible contribution to peace, from 
the United Nations, the Vatican, or what-
ever would be rejected out of hand by 
Hanoi or any other nation. Neverthe-
less, it is true that the 1954 Geneva Con-
ference was very specifically convened to 
deal with the situation in Indochina. 
That conference rather than the United 
Nations did set the line of demarcation 
between South Vietnam and North Viet-
nam as well as, of course, establishing 
the national freedom of the kingdoms of 
Cambodia and Laos, all four areas having 
been an integral part of what was pre-
viously French Indochina.

Hanoi is technically more accurate, 
therefore, in proposing that questions on 
Vietnam come before the Geneva con-
ferees of 1954. I would suggest, Mr. 
President, that no time be lost in giving 
consideration to this proposal from 
North Vietnam, as announced in the So-
viet news agency, Tass. Indeed, I recall, 
'resident Johnson not on one occasion 
but on many occasions, has stated that 
the United States would be willing to 
agree to a conference based on the 1954 
Geneva accords and Secretary of State 
I kali. Rusk has reiterated that state-
ment many times. Most significantly, in 
the state of the Union message to Con-
gress on january 12, the President again 
elated the position with great emphasis: 
'there arc no arbitrary limits to our search 
or peace. We stand by the Geneva agree-
ments of 1951 and 1962. We will meet at any 
,onference table, dIscuss any proposals-4 
points or 14 or 40?and consider the views 
of any group 4' * 
underscore the term "the Geneva 
Agreements of 1954 and 1962," the phrase 
"any conference table," and the refer-
ence to "any group." If the Toss state-
ments, to the effect that Hanoi wishes 
the Vietnamese conflict discussed by the 
Geneva Conferees, is accurate and I see 
no reason to doubt it, since both radio 
Hanoi and Paiping'S New China news 
agency have carried similar reports, I 
trust that it means that while North 
Vietnam is unwilling to have the U.N. 
brought into the matter, Hanoi is pre-
pared for a reconvening of the 1954 
Geneva Conference and is willing to sit 
down at the conference table with the 
United States and with the Geneva Con-
ferees of 1954 to consider negotiations 
based on the Geneva accords. I would 
hope that these press statements form 
the nucleus for a negotiating conference 
and I would suggest the cochairmen of 
the Geneva Conference of 1954; namely, 
the Soviet Union and the United King-
dom, to act immediately on this state-
ment by the North Vietnamese Foreign 
Ministry. I would urge them to convene 
all relevant participants for the purpose 
of getting to work on ways and means 
of settling this question which confronts 
not only southeast Asia but the rest of 
the world directly or indirectly. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time 
of the Senator has expired. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to proceed for 1 
additional minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. If North Vietnam 
means what it says, then I think the 
time is right for the Geneva Conference 
to be reconvened and would recommend 
that the effort be made to reconvene it. 
Mr. PULBRIGHT. Mr. President, will 
the Senator from Montana yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD I yield to the Sen-
ator from Arkansas. I 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President,  
wish to associate myself with the state-
ment of the Senator. 
It seems to me, in view of the develop-
ments, that this is the proper way to 
proceed. I hope that they mean what 
they say when they say the 1954 Geneva 
Conference has jurisdiction and tha 
1111111kM

commend the Senator for his state-
ment. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. At least the initia-
tive comes from North Vietnam. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time 
of the Senator has expired. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President:, I 
ask unanimous consent to proceed for 
1 minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. In this respect I 
think we should take up their suggestion 
and if it is a challenge, accept it. 
Mr. GORE. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield if I have 
time. 
Mr. GORE. I suggest to the majority 
leader, with whose suggestions I wieh to 
associate myself, that this announce-
ment on the part of the Government of 
Hanoi, attributed to Tass and other 
agencies, may very well be the fruit of 
the reference of this issue to the United 
Nations. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I should say that 
there is much merit in that suggestion, 
because it required a Presidential call, 
through Ambassador Goldberg, to the 
United Nations Security Council to elicit 
this comment or reply from Hanoi, which 
may well work toward a possible recon-
vening of the Geneva Conference. 
Mr. GORE. So even though the pros-
pects in the United Nations are not so 
happy as we would prefer, it may have 
already been a very fruitful move. 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, will the 
Senator from Montana yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I will yield if I 
have time. 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I may proceed 
for 3 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? The Chair hears none, and 
the Senator from Pennsylvania is recog-
nized for 3 minutes. 
Mr. CLARK. I wish to associate my-
self with the views of the majority leader 
and to ask him this question: As he 
knows, the cochairmen of the Geneva 
Conference were Great Britain and the 
Soviet Union. Great Britain has, on 
many occasions, attempted to persuade 
the Soviet Union to issue a joint call for 
the reconvening of that Conference. 
What is the thought of the majority 
leader as to what could be done to per-
suade the Soviet Union to join Great 
Britain in calling the Geneva Conference 
back into session? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. There have been 
occasions when the United Kingdom has 
suggested the reconvening of the Geneva 
Conference, but the Soviet Union has 
declined to join its cochairman. There 
also have been cases in which the Soviet 
Union has indicated that it would like to 
reconvene the Geneva Conference, spe-
cifically, in one instance, on the basis of a 
question raised by Prince Sihanouk, of 
Cambodia, with respect to the independ-
ence and integrity of that country,. But 
on the other side, it took too long to bring 
t about assent, and when finally a grudg-
ing assent was made to the request it was 
too late. 
I would hope that some of the great 
powers, which seem to act like small 
boys more often than not, would consider 
the difficulties which confront, not this 
country especially, but the world as a 
whole, would meet and put their heads 
together, and issue a call for the recon-
vening of this Conference. Then all that 
the United Kingdom or the Soviet Union 
would have to do would be to issue a 
declaration. 
Furthermore, if those two countries do 
not wish to take that action, any member 
nation of the 1954 Geneva accords can, 
on its own initiative act to reconvene the 
Conference. I hope that in some way 
that will be done, and that this sug-
gestion, request, or challenge by North 
Vietnam, issued through its foreign 
ministry, may be accepted. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, since 
we are discussing Vietnam, it is worth 
noting that on Monday of this week, 
President Eisenhower, in a telephone in-
terview, said that the President "unques-
tionably made the right decision in or-
dering a resumption of bombing in North 
Vietnam." 
Further, he said that any other course 
would have given "sanctuary to those 
responsible for sending guerrilla forces 
and supplies into South Vietnam." 
President Eisenhower went on to re-
mark: 
Indefinite suspension of bombing would 
only make certain that we would have to 
face the Communist aggression on other bat-
tlefields elsewhere in southeast Asia. 
Then he called attention to the fact 
that we were in South Vietnam by the 
invitation of the Government of that 
country. He placed particular emphasis 
on this subject when he said: 
I am for winning the battle here and not 
in some more remote place not of our own 
choosing. 
He rather scoffed at the contention 
that we were playing brinkmanship all 
over again. He said that the enemy had 
used the pause to strengthen its forces in 
South Vietnam and to send in more 
equipment, and also had continued to 
bomb nonmilitary targets. 
He said that there was nothing else 
the President could do in the circum-
stances "but o:rder a resumption of the 
bombing." He rejected the suggestion of 
General Gavin that U.S. forces with-
draw to coastal enclaves along the South 
China Sea or the Gulf of Tonkin, so as 
to limit the war while pursuing peace. 
I believe that as a former President of 
the United States, as a former Com-
mander in Chief of the Army, Navy, and 
Air Force, as a General of the Army, and 
as the grand captain of our forces in 
World War II, his views certainly merit 
real consideration. 
I am confident that the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, the Security Council, and every 
other responsible person will attach great 
weight to what the former General of 
the Army has had to say with respect to 
the resumption of the bombings. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, it was my hope, when the President 
decided to call upon the Security Coun-

cil, that some useful contribution might 
be made by the Security Council. 
I predicted that it would be a rather 
frustrating experience. So far, I have 
seen nothing to alter the prediction I 
made along this line. 
I hope that the suggestions of the ma-
jority leader will lead to an honorable 
peace. My impression is that this Na-
tion has been ready at all times to urge 
the reconvening of the Geneva Confer-
ence, in the event that there were some 
disposition on the side of the Communist 
bloc to try to find an honorable solution 
to the difference between this Nation 
and the Communist aggressors. 
I suspect, Mr. President, that we shall 
find our problem to be that the Commu-
nists think they can take over a country 
that does not wish to become a Com-
munist country, and that a great many 
people who do not want to be subjected 
to Communist rule can be put under such 
a rule. That probably will be the dif-
ficulty that will have to be resolved. 
When there are large numbers of free-
dom-loving people who do not desire to 
be taken over by the Communist con-
spiracy, either by Hanoi, Peiping, or 
Moscow, it seems to me that this Nation, 
once having sent its troops there, has a 
duty not to surrender those people to 
communism, and, having undertaken to 
encourage those people to fight in their 
own defense, we have a duty to stay by 
their side and see them through. 
If a Geneva Convention were con-
vened and this Nation were to send its 
representatives there for a face-saving 
surrender, millions of people would be 
left to the will of the Communists. It 
seems to me that we should not have been 
involved in the first place if that were 
our purpose. 
If an honorable peace could be arrived 
at, I should like to see it arranged. I 
should like to see our Nation negotiate 
on any basis whatsoever that might lead 
to an honorable peace. I should dislike 
to see our Nation surrender, if it is our 
intention to go to the conference table 
for the purpose of surrender. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator will state it. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, is 
a motion in order that the Committee 
on Foreign Relations be authorized to 
meet all day on Friday? 
Mr. LAUSCHE. I reserve the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER, The 
Senator's request would not be in order 
until the conclusion of the morning busi-
ness. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I understood a 
moment ago that the Senate was in 
the morning hour. 
Mr. HRUSKA. Mr. President, is the 
Senate in the morning hour of a period 
of time assigned for the transaction of 
routine morning business? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 
technically morning business. 
Mr. HRUSKA. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, does 
the Senator from Arkansas contemplate 
that if permission is granted for the 
Committee on Foreign Relations to 
meet, only those measures which he 
identified earlier this morning will be 
considered by the committee? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Under the rules, 
the committee can meet only 1 day. I 
assure the Senator that we shall have to 
spend far more than 1 day on the sup-
plemental bill that is before the Senate. 
I propose to move, after the morning 
business is over, that the Committee on 
Foreign Relations be authorized to meet 
all day on Friday next. 
Mr. LAUSCHE. The Senator has not 
answered my question. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. The only business 
that will be taken up is the pending 
business, the supplemental appropria-
tion authorization and two nominations 
which the Senator knows about. 
Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, I 
have no objection. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I am not asking 
for unanimous consent. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I yield. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, I call 
the attention of the distinguished Sen-
ator to the fact that the Senate presently 
has 107 standing, select, joint, and 
subcommittees. 
If we make a dispensation by motion 
for one committee, whether a standing 
or select committee, why should not 
every committee and subcommittee 
which may have witnesses from out of 
the city move that it be authorized to 
do likewise because the Committee on 
Foreign Relations had been authorized 
to meet? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. As the Senator 
has already pointed out, we have done 
it for the Committee on Appropriations 
and the Committee on Armed Services. 
Why should it not be done for the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations? 
Mr. DIRKSEN. The Senator from 
Arkansas is the one who objected to the 
unanimous consent request. I pointed 
' out that, for some 10 or 11 years, I 
served on the House Committee on Ap-
propriations. That committee had such 
dispensation. I served for a good many 
years on the Senate Committee on Ap-
propriations. It had such dispensation. 
It has been a custom of long standing. 
And there was a very good reason for it. 
There are normally about 13 regular 
supply bills, aside from deficiencies and 
supplementals. There is a parade of 
Government witnesses before the sub-
committees. The committees could not 
get their work done. 
June 30 is the end of the fiscal year, 
and, as a matter of course, we have 
always expected that all appropriations 
would be completed by the end of the 
fiscal year. I cannot remember when 
we have not done that. We have had 
interim resolutions to carry over the ap-
propriations so that salaries and wages 
could be paid. There is a very good 
argument for this being done for the 
Committee on Appropriations because of 
the work volume that it undertakes. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Am I to under-
stand that the Senator means that this 
matter is much more important than is 
the war in Vietnam and the world nu-
clear war with which we are faced? Is 
that a very incidental matter, that the 
Senate should not be concerned about? 
Mr. DIRKSEN. I ask the Senator 
from Arkansas whether compulsory 
unionism or freedom of choice or com-
pulsory membership in a union is more 
important than the youngsters over 
there. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator knows 
what I think about that. I believe this 
bill ought to be taken down. I agree 
with what the Senator said. Either that 
should be done or cloture should be in-
voked. 
I am perfectly willing to vote to take 
it down. However, I cannot control that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
time of the Senator has expired. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, a parliamentary inquiry. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator will state it. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. It is my un-
derstanding that a motion that a com-
mittee meet during the session of the 
Senate is not in order under the unani-
mous-consent request under which the 
Senate is operating. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator is correct. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. When the 
morning business is over, the pending 
business will be laid before the Senate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator is correct. 
Is there further morning business? 
The Senator from Oregon is recog-
nized. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, a parlia-
mentary inquiry. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator will state it. 
Mr. MORSE. Would it be in order for 
me to make a statement on the procedure 
of the Senate during the morning hour? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator has 3 minutes. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, I desire 
to make a statement while my good 
friend the Senator from Arkansas is on ? 
the floor. 
As one member of the Committee on 
Foreign Relations, I want the Senator 
from Arkansas to know that it is the view 
of the senior Senator from Oregon that, 
although we cannot meet while the Sen-
ate is in session, we can meet at 8 o'clock 
in the morning and have breakfast. I 
suggest that we start having meetings of 
the Committee on Foreign Relations at 
8 o'clock in the morning. If we are to 
keep banker's hours and not make an ef-
fort to break this filibuster, and if we 
continue to go home at 4:30, 5, 5:30, or 
6 at night, even before the Riggs National 
Bank president leaves his office, we shall 
never be done. I suggest that we sched-
ule public meetings at 6, 7, and 8 o'clock 
at night. 
The people are entitled, may I say 
most respectfully, to have the Committee 
on Foreign Relations meet whenever it 
can meet under the rules of the Senate. 
The rules do not apply after adjourn-
ment or recess.

I believe that we ought to start hav-
ing evening meetings and public meet-
ings. The American people are entitled 
to know where the Committee on For-
eign Relations stands. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Can the Senator 
aiye me any indication of his belief that 
we could get the Members there? Speak-
ing for myself. I am perfectly willing to 
do that if I think I can get a quorum 
present to hear the witnesses. 
Mr. MORSE. I believe that people are 
i..mtitled to know who the members of 
the Committee on Foreign Relations are 
in this hour of crisis who find it incon-
venient to attend a meeting, no matter 
what hour of the day or night the Sen-
',tor calls the meeting. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, I believe I am correct that, if Sen-
ators care to do so. they may call a group 
of Senators together. There is no rule 
that states that a group of Senators can-
iot meet to talk about a matter. 
A s the Senator from Illinois has point-
od out, if the committee meets and seeks 
to keep a transcript or record of such 
meeting, the committee chairman can 
be made to pay the cost of the record. 
fowever, if a record is not kept and 
:Senators merely meet and discuss mat-
ters, they can later make their action of-
Ucial They meet at a time when 
the Senate is not in session. 
As a member of the Committee on 
Voreign Relations, if the Senator from 
.arkansas cares to call a committee meet-
Mg after the Senate completes its busi-
ness or before it meets tomorrow morn-
ing, I shall endeavor to be present. I 
aannot promise to deliver the other 
nodies, but I can promise to give to the 
Senator whatever cooperation I am able 
to make available to him. 
Mr. TOWER. Mr. President, a par-
ia,mentary inquiry. 
PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
13enator will state it. 
Mr. TOWER If the distinguished 
Senator from Arkansas [Mr. FULBRIGHT 1 , 
at the conclusion of the morning busi-
ness, were to request that the Foreign 
Relations Committee be permitted to 
meet, would he not, in effect, be attempt-
ing to suspend the rules; and would such 
a request be in order? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
rules of the Senate provide that the 
oommittee may not meet during sessions 
without leave of the Senate, except 
under certain conditions and it it has 
held that an attempt for a leave can be 
out in the form of a motion under the 
rules. It has been ruled by the Chair 
that it is debatable and privileged. 
Mr. TOWER. It would be a privi-
leged motion, then, and would need to 
aarry only by a simple majority to ac-
oomplish the end desired by the Senator 
trorn Arkansas? 
retie PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator is correct. 
Mr. TOWER. That motion would be 
debatable, and the rule of germaneness 
would apply? 
The :PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator is correct.. 
Mr. TOWER. And any speeches made 
un that motion would not be charged 
as debate on H.R. 77? 
mqn 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator is correct. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, for the information of the Senate, 
I believe the leadership would feel 
obligated to move to table such a motion. 
We have before us a motion which in-
volves a very important matter, which 
the leadership feels should come to a 
vote. The leadership recognizes and well 
knows that a motion for committees to 
meet could indeterminably extend the 
debate in which we are presently 
engaged. 
Speaking as one Senator and as the 
chairman of a committee with similar 
problems, I should very much hope that 
the chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee would not insist upon making 
such a motion to meet while the Senate 
is in session. As a member of his com-
mittee. I would do what I could to help 
provide for the presence of Senators and 
assure him of my own presence at the 
meeting, if he sees fit to call a meeting 
of his committee after the Senate has 
concluded its session today or before 
the Senate meets on tomorrow. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. In response to the 
statement of the Senator from Louisiana, 
in the first place, I have riot enough time, 
now, to arrange it today. I would like 
permission for the committee to meet 
during the session of the Senate on Fri-
day. I see no reason why such permis-
sion should not be granted, because I 
submit that under the present conditions, 
with the administration urging us to give 
them a supplemental authorization of 
$415 million?and I can assure the Sena-
tor that they have urged Me; I assume 
that they need it, that they have run out 
of money?this is not a mere routine 
matter upon which I am asking permis-
sinn for the committee to meet . 
Such permission has already been 
granted to the Armed Services Committee 
and the Appropriations Committee. I do 
not believe this is a normal, ordinary 
matter. I think it is of sufficient im-
Portance to justify allowing the commit-
tee to have one meeting during the Sen-
ate session. One reason why I should 
particularly like to have one meeting?
for which I think I can get the members 
of the committee together?is even to 
discuss the matter raised by the Senator 
from Oregon, as to whether we can rea-
sonably hold meetings in the evening, 
To my knowledge, it has never been done. 
If the members would agree to come in 
and we can obtain the witnesses and told 
meetings, that would suit me; but I 
should like to have a meeting in which 
we can determine whether or not it is a 
feasible way to proceed. If so, I shah try 
to accommodate to it. 
I ask permission for only 1 day; I am 
not asking permission for the entire year, 
which was given to the Committee on 
Appropriations. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana, Mr. Presi-
dent, if need be. if it cannot be done any 
other way, the Senator from Louisiana 
would urge the majority leader to con-
sider recessing the Senate while the 
Senator from Arkansas calls his com-
mittee together. 
But I have known occasions, when a 
committee was pressed to get work done, 
when evening sessions were held. When 
the Committee on Labor and Public Wel-
fare was rushing to report an amendment 
to the Taft-Hartley bill in 1949, that the 
committee met following Senate sessions 
until late every night. I recall an occa-
sion, when one member of the Finance 
Committee was strenuously opposed to 
the reciprocal trade bill, and that com-
mittee sat until after midnight every 
night for a week in order to conclude its 
hearings and hear all the witnesses who 
had been scheduled. 
I urge that the Senator from Arkansas 
discuss the matter with the majority 
leader on a personal basis, and that we 
try to find a way to accommodate the 
Senator, because I realize his problem. I 
assure him that I personally will coop-
erate in any way I can. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Of course, any 
Senator would definitely be within his 
rights to move to table such a motion. 
I wish to make it clear to my critics, on 
behalf of the committee and for myself 
personally, that we are not being dila-
tory on the matter; we would like to 
move on. 
Mention has been made of the im-
portance of the Appropriations Commit-
tee. For the past 2 or 3 years, our com-
mittee has been blamed for difficulty in 
connection with foreign aid. It is true 
that the foreign aid bill, and that bill 
alone, delayed the adjournment of the 
last session of the Senate; and that is 
another reason why I think the Foreign 
Relations Com:mittee should not be 
thwarted in its efforts to dispose of this 
business, which is extremely important 
at the moment; it is not routine business. 
Our being allowed 1 day would be fully 
justified, so that I can get the members 
together and we can make plans, and 
determine whether it is at all possible to 
meet during the evenings. We are not 
trying to dispose of routine executive 
business; we are talking about witnesses. 
As the Senators knows, we cannot always 
get a witness to come in at 8 o'clock in the 
morning or at night, but perhaps such 
arrangements could be made. 
Mr. DIRKSEIsT. Mr. President, a par-
liamentary inquiry. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator will state it. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Is there a motion 
presently before the Senate? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. No 
question is pending. 
Is there further morning business? 
Mr. GORE. Mr. President, since a 
motion to table is not available. I wish 
to use the 3 minutes permitted under the 
present parliamentary procedure to com-
mend the chairman of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee [Mr. FULBRIGHT1. As 
he has stated, the administration has 
urged our committee to expedite consid-
eration of the resolution pending before 
it for additional funds for aid to South 
Vietnam. I am not advised as to the 
degree of urgency, but the administra-
tion seems to think it is very urgent. 
We are caught in a filibuster; let us 
acknowledge that fact?a filibuster not 
on repeal of 14(b) but upon a motion to 
take it up for consideration. 
I suppose that the senior Senator from 
Tennessee is about the most reluctant

available. Let it be invoked. Let us 
determine the issue. 
Mr. LONG of I,ouisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent  
Mr. HRUSKA. Mr. President, I yield 
the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, all the arguments made today have 
a familiar ring -to me. I have heard 
them all before. During the 17 years I 
have served in the Senate, I have been 
both with the filibusterers and against 
the filibusterers. I understand the argu-
ments on both sides. I have used them 
at much greater length myself. I have 
made the same argument that my friend 
the Senator from Nebraska has just 
made. Therefore, I understand the ar-
guments on both sides of this issue. 
The Senators who are trying to move 
for repeal of section 14(b) are not going 
to set this matter aside. We are going 
to pursue it. We are not going to bring 
up debatable motions. We will find some 
way to deal with the problem stated by 
the Senator from Arkansas. We will find 
some way to work it out; either to urge 
him to get his committee together when 
the Senate is not in session, before or 
after; or if need be, we can recess the 
Senate so that he can call his committee 
together. Therefore, we will find some 
way to work out the problem. There is 
nothing new about this situation, because 
Senatars who are engaged in extended 
debate to prevent the matter from com-
ing to a vote have every right to object 
to any committee meeting. We respect 
that right. That is a right under the 
rules. We have to accord them that. 
Mr. BASS. Last year, as I remember, 
the Senate was considering a baseball 
resolution. Was there not some ex-
tended debate about Baseball Week? I 
believe that committees met during all 
that time. I do not know whether that 
issue prevented committees from meeting 
when extended debate was indulged in 
on such an important issue as the ques-
tion of Baseball Week. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senate gave 
us permission to meet. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, I have the floor, but let me say 
that Senators who are engaged in ex-
tended debate have every right to object 
to any committee meeting while the 
Senate is in session. It is entirely with-
in our right. Inasmuch as the rules make 
it presently debatable, we do not wish to 
bring in another debatable motion while 
a motion to take up section 14(b) is being 
debated. 
Mr. BASS. I wish it understood that 
I do not question our rights under the 
rules. All I am saying is that the RECORD 
should show who is holding up progress. 
It is not those who wish repeal of sec-
tion 14(b) at all. All that has to be said 
is this: An important measure which has 
passed the other body, and which has 
been reported by the committee in this 
body, could now become the business of 
the Senate. But our opponents are even 
preventing the Senate from deliberating. 
All they have to do is say: "We will vote 
on the isstte." It would then all be over. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. It seems to 
me that the arguments on both sides have 
been clearly stated, and I therefore hope 
that the Senate will now get on with its 
business. 
Mr. HART. Mr. President?
Mr. BASS. Mr. President?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Chair recognizes the Senator from Mich-
igan. 
Mr. HART. Mr. President, would I 
be out of order to transact routine busi-
ness? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator would be in order to do So. 
Mr. HART. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, I object, if that goes beyond the 
unanimous-consent request, 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Chair has allotted 3 minutes to the Sena-
tor from Michigan. 
Mr. HART. Mr. President, am I in 
order to proceed? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator is in order to proceed. 
VIETNAM 
Mr. HART. Mr. President, Mr. 
Erwin D. Canham has written an article 
in the Christian Science Monitor of yes-
terday entitled "World Larger Than 
Vietnam," and I believe that he has made 
his point very clear. It would be pru-
dent for all Senators to read the article 
and I therefore ask unanimous consent 
to have it printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
WORLD LARGER THAN VIETNAM 
(By Erwin D. Canham) 
Vietnam is important. But it really should 
not overshadow the world. There are other 
problems, other challenges, other successes. 
The nations have other work to do. 
The United States has plunged into a di-
vision over its policies in Vietnam which is 
deeper and more troublesome than in any 
similar crisis for many years. The division 
is deeper than it ought to be, and probably 
appears deeper than it is in fact. 
To hold the Vietnam issue in something 
like its true proportions, a number of affirma-
tions can be made: 
The United States has no intention of 
permitting itself to drift into a war with 
Communist China. It would only engage in 
such a war if grossly provoked. 
Probably, it is equally true that Commu-
nists China has no intention of permitting it-
self to drift into a war with the United 
States. It evidently seeks to harass the 
United States to to its fullest ability, draw-
ing American forces into deeper and deeper 
involvement in Asia, but always short of di-
rect United States-Chinese war. Peiping's 
policies have at all times been cautious. It 
is interested in inexpensive victories, not 
costly ones. 
NO SURRENDER 
The United States has no intention of sur-
rendering in Vietnam. It is eager to with-
draw under tolerable terms, including terms 
which might lead to Communist rule if it 
turns out to be the wish of the Vietnamese 
people. But it does not intend to be driven 
out. It is in Asia for the sake of the free-
dom of Asians. 
It is also probable that the United States 
has no intention of escalating the Viet-
namese war beyond the bare minimum 
needed to maintain a reasonable position 
leading to negotiation. It is likely, too, that 
with the resumption of bombing it will be 
in ways directly supporting U.S. forces and 
Inhibiting direct North Vietnamese penetra-
tions into South Vietnam. It is most un-
likely to include attacks on Hanoi or Hai-
phong. 
Beyond these affirmations, some other basic 
situations should be noted: 
American-Soviet relations are in no crisis. 
The world's two greatest powers have come 
to understand each other fairly well, with 
certain policies more or less in parallel. 
There is no crisis over Berlin or Germany. 
Such a crisis could be infinitely more dan-
gerous than a crisis in southeast Asia. 
EEC RESCUED 
The European Common Market has again 
been rescued from collapse. The British 
Government has won an unexpectedly 
successful by-election, promising greater 
strength and stability for the period ahead. 
India's Government has passed into prom-
isingly capable hands, although it is too 
soon to draw many conclusions. The Tash-
kent agreement is still intact. There are no 
immediate threats of great Communist pene-
tration in the various southeast Asian states, 
each of them vulnerable to pressure, but still 
holding on. Communism has suffered a mas-
sive setback in Indonesia. 
In Africa, though military takeovers are 
disappointing and assassinations dismaying, 
the alternative of extreme leftwing or Com-
munist revolutions would be even more 
threatening. 
FOOD NEEDED 
Beyond doubt, the greatest problem in the 
world is not the pesky guerrilla war in Viet-
nam, but the famine or threat of famine in 
many lesser developed parts of the world. 
Hunger is great in India, is growing apace 
In Latin America and Africa. All the more 
developed nations, not just the United States, 
will soon have to take more seriously than 
ever before the need to support the expan-
sion of food production, and other necessities 
of life, both in their own nations and in the 
raw materials countries. 
It is tragic that so much of the world's 
atmosphere has been poisoned by the Viet-
nam riddle. It Is distracting. Commu-
nism's penetrations in Africa, Latin America, 
and some other parts of Asia are frequently 
being set back. But in Vietnam a combina-
tion of circumstances gives communism its 
greatest advantages and the United States 
its greatest handicaps. 
Such things happen sometimes in the af-
fairs of individuals and families, as of na-
tions. The United States and its thoughtful 
friends, should not lose their balance and 
commonsense. The issue can be resolved. 
TRUTH IN PACKAGING 
Mr. HART. Mr. President, since the 
truth packaging bill was first introduced 
3 years ago, the number of words it has 
generated?in favor and in opposition?
could doubtlessly provide a ladder to the 
moon, if propertly joined and fitted. 
It can be safely stated, I believe, that 
the words from both sides have not di-
minished?either in number or inten-
sity. As I see it, this debate has helped 
the consumer in two ways?it has made 
him increasingly wary in the supermar-
ket and it has reassured perceptive shop-
pers that they are not alone in their 
desire for a clear presentation of rele-
vant information. 
In total number, the consumer move-
ment is an impressive one?some 60 mil-
lion family shoppers wind their way up
