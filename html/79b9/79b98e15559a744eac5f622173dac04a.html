 DEATH OF STALIN
 LAST DAYS OF STALIN
 This then was the situation in the Soviet Union on 4 March, when
 Radio Moscow announced that Stalin was in critical condition as a re-
 sult of a stroke on the night of 1-2 March.  The continuing medical
 bulletins were couched in pessimistic terms. They carefully outlined
 tie nature of Stalin's illness and meticulously described the measures
 being taken by the doctors who were treating him.  These play-by-play
 accounts revealed concern lest listeners'interpret this news; as mean-
 ing that either the old "doctor wreckers," or a group of new ones,
 had succeeded in shortening Stalin's life. The eight doctors in at-
 tendance'were under the supervision of a new Minister of Health,
 Tretyakov.
 Stalin had been last seen by a non-Communist on 17 February when
 he had given an audience to the Indian Ambassador (who had, however,
 never met him previously).  While it is possible that Stalin's illness
 had been carefully concealed, and that a double was used for this in-
 tervi?w, this is unlikely;                               it is considered highly doubtful that a
 double would have been used for Stalin's last interview.  Stalin's
 collapse actually followed several months of what for him was unusual
 activity.  Work on the Party Congress had evidently kept him in Moscow
 throughout the fall; in addition to this, he had granted at least four
 interviews to foreigners, had.attended the anniversary ceremonies on
 7 November and had appeared in the Bolshoi theatre on 12 January.  (It
 is true, however, that Stalin's movements had been somewhat restricted.
 He delivered only a short speech at the Party Congress, yielding the
 main address to Malenkov.  The 7 November ceremonies had been much
 shorter than usual, probably out of deference to him.)
 The nature of the reporting on Stalin's illness suggested that
 his final stroke caught the Politburo off guard.  There had been no
 advance warning.  An examination of all Soviet radio propaganda from
 1 to 4 March yielded no indication prior to the public announcement
 of Stalin's actual condition.  There were'no significant differences
 either in the nature pr in the number of references to Stalin, who
 continued to be presented during this period as the focus of power
 in the Soviet Union.  Similarly, an examination,of all the Satellite
 radio propaganda material from the time of the October Party Congress
 to Stalin's death revealed no attempt to build up any of his lieuten-
 ants in possible anticipation of his voluntary or involuntary relin-
 quishment of power.

 This information is of course far from'conclusive.  Many hypoth-
 eses concerning the circumstances of Stalin's death Could be advanced
 to explain this lack of preparation.  Furthermore, the West was com-
 pletely dependent on the Soviet radio and press'for all'news on this
 development.  It is impossible therefore to determine whether Stalin
 .had been dead for some time, whether he was murdered, or whether he
 died in the way the medical bulletins said he did.
 THE QUESTION OF STALIN'S SUCCESSOR
 The announcements regarding Stalin's condition, indicating as
 they did that the Soviet Union would soon be without its leader and
 revealing that Stalin's. disciples had waited four days before inform-
 ing the people of their impending loss, immediately focused attention
 on Malenkov as the most likely successor.  His career had moved 'steadily
 forward since Zhdanov's death in August 1948.  He was the senior member
 of the Party Secretariat, the position from which Stalin originally
 consolidated his power.  He was the only man other than Stalin who was
 a member of all three of the highest bodies of the Party and Government--
 the Politburo, the Secretaria~, and the                            lle ium of the Council of
 Ministers (Deputy Chairmen). 1                                           -1
 Ignatiev's appointment in 1951 as MGB Minister was also thought
 to have had the blessing and approval of Malenkov.  The nature of
 Ignatiev's Party career indicated that he had prospered under, and
 had possibly been brought along by, Malenkov.

 Malenkov had delivered the key address at the Party Congress, and
 subsequently, as might have been expected, it had been accorded much
 publicity throughout the Communist world.  The replacement of the Polit-
 buro by a Presidium, the composition of which apparently favored Malen-
 kov if it favored any of the old Politburo men-oers, also seemed to con-
 tribute to his leading position.  This was even more true of the enlarged
 Secretariat.
 Thus it was commonly expected that Malenkov would attempt to fill
 the void left by Stalin.  The official announcement regarding Stalin's
 illness, however, threw no light on the subject of his successor.  It
 merely placed responsibility in the Central Committee of the Party and
 in the Council of Ministers, claiming that these two bodies would "take
 into account all circumstances connected with the temporary withdrawal
 of Stalin from leading the State's and Party's activity."
 The announcement of Stalin's death came on 5 March.  It linked
 his name with that of Lenin in an eulogy of the Party as leader of the
 people.  It underscored the "steel-like, monolithic unity" of Party
 ranks and defined its task as the "guarding of unity, as the "apple
 of our eye."  Reuters at the time recalled that Malenkov used this
 phrase in his October Party Congress speech and suggested that he was
 the author of the document.  The same phrase, however, had appeared
 in connection with Lenin's death.  Neither Malenkov nor any other as-
 sociate of Stalin was mentioned in the announcement.  Malenkov had
 come before the public eye, however, in a 4 March Pravda editorial
 which quotes from the section of his Congress speech dealing with
 Party unity.
 The announcement affirmed the Soviet Union's peaceful intentions
 and desire for "business-like" relations.  It named the "great Chinese
 people" first on the list of those people with whom the Soviet Union
 intended to develop friendship.
 Khrushchev was listed as chairman of the Committee for organizing
 Stalin's funeral.  On it were Kaganovich, Shvernik, Vasilevsky, Pegov,
 Artemev, the Commandant of the Moscow Military District, and Yasnov,
 Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Moscow Soviet.  The funeral
 rites were set for 9 March.

 THE FIRST GOVERNMENTAL REORGANIZATION
 On 7 March, Moscow radio announced that in order to prevent
 "panic and disarray," a major reorganization of the Party and Govern-
 ment had been made at a joint meeting of the Central Committee, the
 Council of Ministers and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.  This
 almost unprecedented method of handling business was in keeping with
 the gravity of the situation and reminiscent of the days of the German
 attack, when the Soviet leaders had met in a similar joint session
 and formed the State Defense Council.  It strongly suggested that the
 leaders in this moment of crisis had moved swiftly to show their unity
 and to gird themselves for any battle that might be coming from either
 inside or out.
 In a complete reversal of the organizational decisions taken by
 the October Congress, this new decree clearly outlined the spheres of
 interest and power of Stalin's closest collaborators -- the, members of
 the old Politburo.  Malenkov became Premier (Chairman of the Council
 of Ministers); Beria, Molotov, Bulganin, and Kaganovich became first
 Deputy Premiers.  In addition, Beria returned to direct control of
 the security' forces by becoming Minister of Internal Affairs (MVD),
 with which was combined the Ainistry of State Security (MB); Molotov
 returned to direct leadership in Foreign Affairs; Bulganin took over
 as Minister+of War; Kaganovich received no ministerial assignment, but
 presumably, was to be the economic czar.  The Party's Presidium was
 reduced to ten men, eight of whom had been members of Stalin's Polit-
 buro.  Here, too, Malenkov's name came first, indicating his ascendancy..
 He was followed by Beria, Molotov, Voroshilov, Khruschev, Bulganin,
 Kaganovieh, Mikoyan, Saburov and Pervukhin, in that order.  Saburov
 and Pervukhin were the only newcomers to the group as it had existed
 before October.
 Voroshilov was given the honor of titular head of state.  He
 was "recommended" to become Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme
 Soviet.  Khrushchev was "to concentrate on his work in the Central
 Committee."  Mikoyan took over as head of the new Ministry of Internal
 and External Trade.  Saburov was relieved of his job as head of Gos-
 plan and became the new Minister of Machine Building.                             Pervukhin be-
 came the chief of the new Ministry of Electric Power Stations and the
 Electrical Equipment Industry.
 Thus Party and Government continued to be welded together at the
 top.  Even at this early date, however, there was at least one visible
 flaw in this attempt at "monolithic unity":  the peculiar shuffling of
 the Secretariat on 7 March suggested that the transition was experiencing
 difficulty.

 In the 20's, Stalin had been accorded the title of General Secre-
 tary of the Party, and from this position he had manipulated its ap-
 paratus to the point where it was completely under his control.  He
 had then proceeded to eliminate his enemies, step by step, culminating
 in the'dread purges of the 30's.  It is perhaps small wonder that the
 Soviet leaders were sensitive over the Secretariat and who should lead
 and control it.  The Orgburo had been dissolved and the day-to-day
 control of Party affairs, as well as the control of Party (and Govern-
 ment) personnel appointments, were recognized as the function of the
 Secretariat.  Most observers had expected that Malenkov would be ac-
 corded Stalin's title as "General Secretary" but this was not the case.
 The new decree did not even mention Malenkov's name in connection with
 the Secretariat,. nor did it mention the names of two other members --
 Suslov and Aristov.  The Secretariat was reshuffled as follows-
 1.                                   Pegov was removed from the Secretariat and appointed
 Secretary of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet, where he
 replaced Gorkin, who became Deputy Secretary.  This appeared to
 be a demotion for Pegov, an old apparatus functionary who had
 25X1
 25X1
 been chief of the Central Committee's light industry section.
 Pegov's career had been climaxed
 by his appointment to the Secretariat at the 19th Party Congress.

 Corkin, whom Pegov replaced, was noted on the downgrade
 in October when he lost his membership on the Central Committee;
 he was, however, appointed a member of the Party's Auditing Com-
 mission.)
 2.  Ignatiev, Pospelov and Shatalin were elected Secretaries.
 This was very unusual-  (a)  Shatalin was not made a full member
 of the Central Committee in October, but was listed as an alternate.
 He had been elected to the Orgburo in March 1946, and had presumably    25X1
 been elevated, at that time, from alternate to full membership on
 the Central Committee.: At any rate he was named only an alternate
 in October 1952.

 Malenkov's deputy in the Cadres Department.  Yet the record of
 the October Congress indicates that he was not regarded as too
 important at that time.  (b)  Pospelov, as mentioned previously,
 .had been overlooked in the selection for the Party's Presidium
 in October, despite his seniority, ability and Party record.
 He suffered another setback in January when he was replaced as
 head of the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute.
 ospe ov
 was closely linked with Molotov.  There Is c rcums an  al evi-
 dence to support this.  Pospelov and Molotov were the only two
 to survive on the editorial staff of Bolshevik in 193+ when it
 was purged of Bukharin and all his supporters.  (c)  Ignatiev,
 as mentioned previously, had been MGB Minister prior to October.
 The new decree did not spell out Beria's deputy ministers, as it
 did in the case of most of the other ministers.  It nevertheless
 appeared most probable that Ignatiev bad left the MGB..
 3.   Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as First Secre-
 tary of the Moscow Committee of the Party, in order to "con-
 centrate on his work in the Central Committee."
 4.   Ponomarenko and Ignatov were relieved of their duties
 as Secretaries and transferred "to leading work in the Council
 of Ministers."
 5.   Party "Secretary" Mikhailov was confirmed as First
 Secretary of the Moscow Committee, replacing Khrushchev in this
 post.
 6.   Brezhnev was relieved as Secretary and transferred to
 the post of head of the Political Department of the Navy.
 Thus, of the nine Party Secretaries incumbent when Stalin died,
 the status of, three -- Malenkov ?/, Suslov and. Aristov -- was unde-
 termined; Khrushchev had apparently been upgraded, judging from the
 phraseology of the decree (quoted above); Pegov, Ponomarenko, Ignatov
 and Brezhnev were transferred to other duties; Mikhailov was still
 listed as a Secretary.  In addition, three newcomers -- Ignatiev,
 Pospelov, and Shatalin    had been added.  Clearly the joint meeting
 which drew up the reorganization decree of 6 March had run into trou-
 ble when it came to the Secretariat and had been unable to make up its
 mind.
 Malenkov, however, was listed by Pravda as a secretary on 11 March.

 The Central Committee meeting on 14 March was to reduce the Sec-
 retariat still further, and eventually it was to become a four-man
 group. For the moment, however, there was uncertainty.  The only
 things clear were that four of the Secretariat members had been trans-
 ferred, three had been added and no successor for Stalin's position
 as First Secretary had been selected.
 Returning to the decree itself, there were several other points
 worthy of note :
 1.  Top control of the Government was centered, at least
 formally, in Malenkov, as Chairman of the Council of Ministers,
 and his four deputies.  No other deputy chairmen were listed.
 The decree, however, indicated that two organs had existed in
 the former Council of Ministers -- a "Burg" and a "Presidium".
 Presumably the new Presidium was composed of most of the members
 of the old "Buro", while the old Presidium probably numbered
 among its ranks the remaining former deputy chairmen who were
 not in the old "Buro".  How long these groups had existed is un-
 known.  It was also revealed that an identical setup had existed
 in the Party's Presidium, i.e., that it had been composed of a
 "Burn", presumably including most of the members of the old Pol-
 itburo, and a Presidium, probably composed of the new blood taken
 on in October.  In effect, therefore, a previous centralization
 was publicly displayed for the first time.
 2.       Shvernik, whose replacement by Voroshilov as Chairman
 of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was "recommended", was in
 turn "recommended" as chairman of  he Council of Trade Unions, a
 position he had held in the past.l V. V. Kuznetsov, the incum-
 bent chief of the Trade Unions, was relieved and made a Deputy
 Foreign Minister, while Vyshinsky and Malik were named First Dep-
 uty Foreign Ministers under Molotov.  Vyshinsky, in addition,
 was appointed permanent USSR delegate to the E?N.
 3.  Marshals Vasilevsky and Zhukov were named as Bulganin's
 deputies in the War Ministry.  Vasilevsky had been War Minister
 prior to Bulganin, while Zhukov had been in semi-obscurity since
 1946, serving as a military district commandant.  His return to
 this position had been ascribed to (a) a desire to restore this
 key general to an authoritative position in time of stress, (b)
 a plan on Malenkov's part to secure the support or at least the
 l~ This play on words was necessary on legalistic grounds; the Supreme
 Soviet is supposed to choose the chairman of its own Presidium

 neutrality of the pro essional military, (c) the need.for a
 counter to Bulganin,l and (d) a desire to reduce the panic of
 the people.
 4.  I. G. Kabanov was appointed Mikoyan's First Deputy Min-
 ister in the Ministry of Domestic and Foreign Trade, and Kumykin
 and Zhavoronkov, Deputies.  The latter two had been the ministe-
 rial incumbents of the merged trade ministries.  Kabanov had
 been identified as Chairman of Gossnab in January.  His .new job
 suggested that Mikoyan's ministry would take over some of Goss-
 nab's functions.
 5.  No deputies were listed for Beria's Ministry of Inte-
 rior, Saburov's Ministry of Machine Building, Malyshev's Minis-

 7.  With regard to Party affairs, the decree also .named
 four alternates to the Party Presidium -- Shvernik, Ponomarenko,
 Melnikov and Bagirov.
 (a)  Shvernik had been a perennial alternate before
 his elevation to the enlarged Presidium in October.
 Zhukov's relations with Bulganin are a matter of some interest but
 there is no firm evidence on this point.  At one stage during World
 War II, Bulganin served as political commissar to Zhukov.  This
 may have engendered some friction and, there are several reports
 indicating that this was the case.  Bulgani.n, of course, is strictly
 a political administrator.

 (b)  Ponomarenko was at the same time relieved of
 his position on the Secretariat.  Along with his running
 mate, Suslov, he had long been thought to rank just below        2 5X1
 the Politburo level.  (Most observers associate Ponomarenko
 with Malenkov because of the fact that he became Minister
 of Procurement in 1950.
 (c)  Melnikov, First Party Secretary in the Ukraine,
 had also been elevated to the Presidium in October.  His
 retention as an alternate was viewed as a move to keep
 some regional Party representation on this body.  He had
 served as Second Secretary to Khrushchev in the Ukraine
 from 1947 to 19+9 and succeeded Khrushchev when the latter
 moved to his Secretariat assignment in Moscow in December
 1949.
 (d)  Bagirov's appointment was unusual.  A senior
 Party regional leader, he had been overlooked in the Octo-
 ber promotions for some unknown reason.  He now superseded
 twenty-two members of the October Presidium.   He had worked
 with Beria in Transcaucasus security affairs and at one
 point had been Beria's superior.  Yet his writings on Party
 affairs in the Transcaucasus had paid little lip service
 to Beria.  While both Melnikov's and Bagirov's appoint-
 ments were interpreted as a maneuver to retain some re-
 gional figures on the top Party organs, it soon became
 evident that both these men were to continue in their
 regional jobs and hence would not be physically present
 in Moscow most of the time.
 STALIN'S FUNERAL - REACTION TO DEATH
 Following publication of the 6 March decree, attention was once
 more centered on Stalin's funeral, whichh was scheduled for the 9th of
 March.   Presumably fear of disorder had been reflected in the swift
 moves of the Soviet leaders to set their house in order.  Some part
 of this atmosphere had crept into the lnguage of the decree itself
 which talked of "panic and disarray." 17                                   2 5X1

 Western press reporting from the Soviet capital drew attention
 to the vast wave of mourners who came to view Stalin.  In contrast to
 this, the US Embassy in Moscow found little evidence of extreme grief
 in the capital over the death of Stalin.  On 8 March it noted that
 the atmosphere in Moscow was calm, that markets were open and busi-
 ness was conducted as usual.  The Embassy in fact reported that an
 American who had been in Moscow in 19+5 recalled more evidence of
 grief over Roosevelt's death than there was over Stalin's.

 The official reaction of the European Satellites to Stalin?s
 death was expressed in propaganda reaffirming unity and gratitude
 toward the USSR, and in increased internal security precautions.
 Reports of unusual security measures came from various sources -- in
 Czechoslovakia and Rumania from US officials;              25X1

 dio broadcasts concerning them.  Such a tightening of security is
 fairly standard practice on occasions which might elicit unexpected
 reactions from the public.     In this case, non-Communist response
 to the news was generally a mixture of hope and despair    25X1
 It seems to be the consensus of most Western students of Soviet
 affairs and propaganda that the deification of Stalin was so all-
 pervasive in scope, so penetrating, as to have had a profound effect
 on the Russian people, particularly on the uneducated.  Stalin was
 portrayed as a god, who of course could do no wrong.  His goodness
 was unbounded.  The bureaucratic level between Stalin and the peo-
 ple was blamed for anything reflecting negatively on Stalin?s di -
 vinity. Between the lowly peasant and the great god Stalin, there
 was a vast middle ground wherein lay responsibility for all ills
 affecting the Soviet Union.  Stalin prevented those ills from be-
 coming worse and was responsible for all good in the USSR.  No
 other Soviet leader had ever been allowed to achieve independent
 stature .l
 When Stalin died, therefore, it was necessary to fill the tre-
 mendous void with secondary figures.  All of the important ones were
 apparently employed to fill the breach, at least as a holding opera-
 tion, to calm the people and keep them under control until a more
 permanent setup could be worked out.
 The Soviet leaders also began what in retrospect appears to have
 been a very clever and intelligently-conceived de-emphasis of Stalin,
 imperceptible at first but one which was eventually to make itself
 apparent to the entire world.  A Western survey of Soviet propaganda
 J In World War II, the pattern had been interrupted, but only
 briefly, by the attention given such men as Zhukov and Zhdanov.

 in the period following Stalin's death revealed that a two-week
 period of idolizing Stalin had been followed by an apparently
 deliberate de-emphasis, and concluded that the "progressively but
 still only partially eclipsed god-head is being replaced only by
 the impersonal concept of government and Party."
 This change took the following forms:  (a) avoiding or mini-
 mizing the use of Stalin's name in connection with his hitherto
 heavily publicized contributions to communism, such as the Soviet
 nationalities policy and the 1936 constitution; (b) utilizing quo-
 tations from Stalin without attributing them to him; (c) avoid-
 ing or minimizing the use of his name in connection with several
 measures apparently intended to woo Soviet public opinion -- the
 price reduction, the amnesty, the release of the accused doctor
 plotters, the Pravda answer to Eisenhower; (d) paying tribute to
 the Communist Party leadership rather than to Stalin as being
 responsible for victory in World War II (Bulganin's speech of 1 May);
 and (e) failing to award the annual Stalin prizes for literature and
 science.
 The de-emphasis apparently moved from the Moscow center out to
 the provinces gradually.  A Department of State survey was to con-
 clude in May that Soviet propaganda media had achieved a basic uni-
 formity in the treatment of Stalin.  Both the central and provin-
 cial press continued to refer to him regularly, but not nearly as
 frequently as during his lifetime. References were always made
 with respect and admiration, however, and nothing suggestive of
 criticism of Stalin appeared.  In many cases, Stalin was referred
 to jointly with Lenin.
 Stalin lay in state for four days, the key Soviet leaders serv-
 ing as honor guards.  On the day of Stalin's funeral, the US Embassy
 commented that, considering the facilities available, the rites for
 25X1
 Stalin were'unspectacular.  The embassy found particularly incon-
 gruous the fact that Stalin's body was placed in a narrow aisle on
 coumtented that the decision to hold the
 burial only four   y -after Stalin's death, "contrary to conjecture
 and without allowing the public sufficient time to view the bier, is
 interpreted as meaning that the present high ranking officials do
 not eye favorably the continual demonstrations of affection accorded
 the former dictator by the people."
 Of the three funeral speeches delivered by Malenkov, Beria and
 Molotov, only Molotov's was regarded as a real funeral oration by
 the American Embassy.  The embassy noted that while Molotov's voice
 was shaken in delivery, Malenkov and Beria remained in complete con-

 trol of themselves.  Malenkov and Beria devoted most of their atten-
 tion to the future.                            Malenkov's speech was non-belligerent in tone,
 and in general indicated that the same policies would be carried on.
 Beria's speech was in a similar vein, with the curious exception
 that it did not refer once to Stalin as Comrade Stalin, and that it
 rarely mentioned Stalin except in conjunction with Lenin's name.  In
 addition Beria emphasized that the Party's policy would brook no in-
 terference, that the Party's organs had decided to continue national
 policy without interruption, and that one of the decisions taken in
 this connection was the appointment of Stalin's comrade in-arms,
 Malenkov, as the Chairman of the Council of Ministers
 All three speeches paid special deference to the Chinese ,2/ and
 in every reference to the Satellites, China came first.  None of the
 speakers specifically mentioned the US, UK or the Western nations.
 A close re-reading of all three speeches was to provide Western
 observers with much food for speculation, perhaps more valid than
 usual, since the speeches were delivered in a rather unique situation.
 For example, Malenkov, who had been placed at the top of the list of
 the new Party Presidium, did not once refer to the Central Committee;
 Berta, on the other hand, referred to it five times, suggesting that
 -perhaps, in contrast to Malenkov, he was making a bid for its support.
 THE ABORTIVE MALENKOV BUILD-UP
 The funeral ceremony presented the Soviet leadership to the
 world as a triumvirate:  Malenkov, evidently the  sp imus inter pares;
 Beria, close behind and giving Malenkov a sort of half-hearted
 blessing; and Molotov, running a relatively poor third.  A survey of

 speech.  Some thought it to be laudatory of Malenkov; others thought
 the praise extremely reserved, since Beria had said Malenkov's ap-
 pointment was one of the most important decisions and that respon-
 sibility had now fallen on "leaders" trained by Stalin.

 official comment in the Western world on the personal power rela-

 general agreement that no single leader of sufficient stature was
 available to assume the position and role of Stalin.  Most of the
 individual estimates concluded that political power would be distrib-.
 ute d among several of the top Soviet leaders.  There was some dif-
 ference of opinion as to whether a harmonious relationship would
 prevail, and predictions varied as to the strength of the individual
 power positions.
 Many Communist and non-Communist observers had predicted that

 Malenkov had already begun to capitalize on his position as ap-
 parent head of the triumvirate.  On 5 March, the day after Stalin's
 death, Pravda singled out Malenkov for special attention by quoting
 from his speech to the Party Congress.  This was the first reference
 to any individual leader, except to Stalin, since the Soviet Premier's
 illness had been announced.  On 7, 8 and 9 March, Pravda again fea-
 tured quotations from Malenkov's report to the Congress, beginning at
 this time to use the heavy black type previously reserved for quota-
 tions from Stalin.  The 8 March issue also contained a picture of
 Malenkov delivering the Party Congress report in which Stalin was the
 only other person visible.   On 9 March Pravda again gave Malenkov a
 heavy play and Izvestia printed a picture of Malenkov and Stalin taken
 on May Day 1952.  On 10 March, Pravda and Izvestia both reported that
 Khrushchev had called on "Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the
 USSR and Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, G. M. Malenkov",
 to speak, the first indication that he had remained on the Secretariat
 following the 6 March reorganization.
 On 10 March Pravda printed the much-publicized picture of Stalin,
 Mao and Malenkov at the 1950 signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty.  The
 picture had been retouched to place Malenkov next to Mao by eliminat-
 ing three persons who had been standing between them.  The picture also
 eliminated Molotov, who had been at Stalin's right hand, and Vyshinsky,
 who had been seated in front of Mao.  The newspaper also published an
 article by Mao Tse-tung referring to the Central Committee and the
 Soviet Government headed by Comrade Malenkov.
 Stalin had waited five years after the death of Lenin to usher
 in his own deification campaign in 1929; Malenkov made his bid even

 before Stalin's funeral.  In the days immediately after the funeral,
 Malenkov's funeral speech was rebroadcast almost more times than
 Beria's and Molotov's together, and began to be referred to in edi-
 torials in the provincial press.  This effort to build up Malenkov
 was also evident in Radio Kiev broadcasts on 11 and 12 March stating
 that the local city and ablest Soviets had enthusiastically dispatched
 letters of greeting to the Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers
 and the Secretary of the Party's Central Committee, Comrade Malenkov.
 An effort to model Malenkov after Stalin was also apparent in another
 Radio Kiev broadcast, which quoted the chief Ukrainian-language news-
 paper to the effect that "Comrade Malenkov made an oath on behalf of
 the Party over the coffin of Comrade Stalin to serve the people faith-
 fully."  Stalin had made a similar oath at Lenin's funeral.
 The Malenkov buildup was short-lived, and in the ensuing days of
 March his prominence was sharply cut back.  An outside observer,
 Solomon Schwartz, was to note that the buildup had cost Malenkov a
 great deal.  Upon checking the Soviet press, he found that from the
 llth of March to the end of the month, Pravda did not once quote
 Malenkov in its editorial articles and only infrequently (on the 11th,
 12th, 18th, and 24th) made any reference to the funeral speeches of
 Malenkov, Beria and Molotov.  He noted that "only in its editorial of
 17 March, devoted to the Supreme Soviet session did Pravda refer to
 the speech of the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers, but in this
 case the editor hastened to underscore the confidence of the Soviet
 peoples in the 'Government headed by the faithful pupils and comrades-
 in-arms of great Stalin,' not by a pupil and a comrade-in-arms but by
 'pupils and comrades'."
 A Bulgarian Communist travelling in the West is alleged to have
 stated that following Stalin's death, the Bulgarian Government ordered
 substitution of Malenkov's portraits for Stalin's.  Later the Soviet
 Embassy in Sofia ordered Malenkov's picture removed and replaced by
 Stalin's.
 This initial buildup of Malenkov threw some Satellite and Commu-
 nist publications off the track.  Bertram Wolfe has pointed out that
 the April issue of the American Communist journal Political Affairs,
 which was prepared in early March, published Malenkov's funeral speech
 and not those of Beria and Molotov, and a lead article by William Z.
 Foster entitled "Malenkov at the Helm."  However, in the May issue
 which was prepared in early April, Foster dealt  with Stalin and co-
 existence, not even referring to Malenkov's remarks on this subject
 in his funeral oration.
 On 12 March an article by Alexeyev in Izvestia, entitled "The
 Great Stalin is the Creator of our Five Year P ans," contained a

 substantial quotation from Beria and ended on the note that Party
 and State leadership was in the reliable hands of the Great Stalin's
 faithful "companions-in-arms."
 25X1
 25X1
 During the period from 1  to 1  March, articles
 by regions  Party leaders Patolichev (Byelorussia) and Kalnberzin
 (Latvia), as well as by Party theoretician Chesnokov, made no mention
 of Malenkov, but stressed the leading role of the Central Committee.
 On 16 March Pravda referred to the leading role of the Central
 Committee.  The same issue described the Big-Three -- Malenkov, Beria
 and Molotov -- as "faithful comrades-in-arms of Stalin."
 There were some indications in the immediate period following
 Stalin's death that the Satellites were not clear on the leadership
 in the USSR, but leaned a little toward Malenkov.  A survey of Sat-
 ellite propaganda up to 15 May found that Malenkov, as well as other
 Soviet leaders, was mentioned only sparingly after Stalin's death.
 On the few occasions that Malenkov was mentioned, it was in connec-
 tion either with his speech at Stalin's funeral or with his speech at
 the 19th Party Congress.  Malenkov, however, was mentioned more than
 Beria and/or Molotov, and these latter two were not mentioned inde-
 pendently of Malenkov.
 This braking of the Malenkov buildup was to be paralleled in
 the action taken by the Central Committee meeting of 14 March, an
 action that was not publicly revealed until six days later.
 THE SECOND GOVERNMENTAL REORGANIZATION
 Meanwhile the Supreme Soviet meeting scheduled for the loth was
 postponed one day, obviously to allow the Central Committee meeting
 to take place.  When it met, the Supreme Soviet approved with its
 customary unanimity the appointments of Malenkov as Chairman of the
 Council of Ministers and Voroshilov as Chairman of its own Presidium.
 In addition, it ratified a sweeping reorganization of the Government
 which went far beyond the changes proposed at the joint session on
 6 March.  By 15 March, it looked as though the earlier changes had
 lacked unity and had been hastily put together in a disorderly compro-
 mise arrived at under considerable pressure and tension during the days
 of Stalin's illness.
 At the 15 March meeting, Khrushchev gave the nominating speech for
 Voroshilov as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.  Beria
 gave the nominating speech for Malenkov as Chairman of the Council of

 Mr. Beam, the Counsellor of the  meri-
 Malenkov'presented the composition of the new Government, stat-
 ing that the measures for amalgamating the ministries were worked
 out over a long time during Stalin's lifetime and that their adop-
 tion had been "merely hastened."  Some of the highlights of the
 additional reorganization measures follow:
 1.   The decree represented a sweeping reversal of the
 administrative policies followed since 1948.  It reduced the
 number of Soviet ministries or organs of ministerial level from
 57 to 27, placing control of this simplified structure in the
 hands of men who were for the most part experienced.
 2.   The Ministry of the Navy was merged with the War Minis-
 try and became the Ministry of Defense, under Bulganin.  (On
 6 March Bulganin had received control of the Ministry of War
 only).

 4.   P. K. Ponomarenko received control of the new Ministry

 Secretariat, had been Minister of Procurement since 1950.  The

 Council of Ministers," and Western observers thought that he might

 become a Deputy Chairman of that body or receive control of
 agriculture.  His new Ministry of Culture was formed out of the
 Ministries of Higher Education, Cinematography and Labor Re-
 serves, the Committee on Affairs of the Arts, the Radio Broad-
 casting Committee, and the Chief Administration of Printing,
 Publishing and Bookselling.
 5.   The State Committee of Material and Technical Supply
 of the National Economy (Gossnab) and the State Committee on
 Supply of Food and Industrial Goods (Gosprodsnab) were merged
 with the State Planning Committee (Gosplan).  This gave Gosplan
 the supervision over allocations of materials, food and indus-
 trial products, thereby greatly increasing its importance.
 Kosyachenko, the new Gosplan chief appointed on 6 March, was not
 even a member of the Central Committee.  At that time it was
 thought that Mikoyan's Ministry of Domestic and Foreign Trade
 would receive at least some of Gossnab's functions since its Chief,
 Kabanov, had become First Deputy Minister under Mikoyan.
 6.   Mikoyan, who on 6 March had been named Minister of
 Internal and External Trade, was appointed on 15 March a Deputy
 Chairman of the Council of Ministers.  His stature was thus in-
 creased in a curious way.  Since Mikoyan was now the only Deputy
 Chairman, he occupied a niche by himself, presumably below the
 Presidium of the Council of Ministers composed of the five First
 Deputy Chairmen yet above the ordinary ministers comprising the
 full Council of Ministers.
 7.   N. G. Ignatov who, like Ponomarenko, had been marked
 for "leading work" in the Council of Ministers on 6 March, did
 not receivA a ministerial assignment.  His status was not de-
 termined until 2 April when Leningrad Pravda announced his selec-
 tion as a Party Secretary in Leningrad.
 8.   The Supreme Soviet failed to ratify either the Fifth
 Five-Year Plan or the 1953 State Budget, both of which were al-
 ready in effect, suggesting that a review of existing plans by
 the reorganized  overnnment was underway.
 9.      Malenkov, in submitting the nominations of the
 government appointments, referred to the principle of collective
 leadership. He stated that "the strength of our leadership rests
 in its collective, cohesive and moral-ethical nature.  We regard
 strictist observance of this supreme principle as a guarantee of
 correct leadership of the country and a most important condition
 of our further successful progress along the path of building
 communism in our country."  He said that the USSR would follow

 the policy elaborated by the Party, and that this policy had been
 stated by himself, Beria and. Molotov at Stalin's funeral on 9 March.
 He elaborated further to say that there was no question that could
 not be "settled peacefully by mutual agreement of the interested
 countries.  This applies to our relations with all states, includ-
 ing the United States of America."

 10.   V. V. Kuznetsov was released from his duties as a
 member of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet in connection
 with his appointment as USSR Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.
 On 10 March Kuznetsov had been assigned as Ambassador to Peiping.
 In contrast to previous Soviet practice, he evidently did not
 relinquish his title as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs upon
 receiving a diplomatic post in a foreign country.  Malik, for ex-
 ample, who replaced Gromyko in London, was relieved of his title
 of First Deputy Foreign Minister upon receiving this assignment.
 (An exception to this is the USSR permanent ambassadorial post at
 the UN, which in recent years has been held by men of Deputy

 Thus a five-man Secretariat was named with Khrushchev listed
 first.   Among other things, Suslov, who was not mentioned in the 6
 March decree, was retained; Aristov, also unmentioned on 6 March, was
 dropped; Mikhailov, identified as being in the Secretariat on 6 March,
 was also dropped.  The ranking of the three newcomers was reversed:
 on 6 March Ignatiev was listed first, then Pospelov, and Shatalin; on
 the 20th, Shatalin was listed first among the newcomers, followed by
 Pospelov and Ignnatiev.
 SIGNIFICANCE OF REORGANIZATION OF PARTY SECRETARIAT
 Malenkov thus abandoned direct control of the Party Secretariat --
 something which Stalin in his lifetime had never done.  Stalin had used
 the office of General Secretary to achieve absolute dictatorship.  In
 later years he had delegated considerable authority to the ranking se-
 cretary, a position held by Malenkov at the time of Stalin's death.
 The presumption of the authors of this paper has been that Stalin
 had allowed Malenkov's influence to grow, that Malenkov had achieved
 predominance by capably handling the intricate affairs of the appara-
 tus in the name of Stalin, and that Malenkov's influence bad become
 quite strong in the last two years of Stalin's life.  Stalin, despite
 whatever infirmity may have gripped him, must have been aware of and
 allowed this personal rise to take place, a rise which culminated in
 Malenkov's leading role at the Party Congress.  Stalin therefore ap-
 peared to approve of this Malenkov preeminence and had done nothing to
 stop it.
 It is the author's contention that Stalin was unable to contem-
 plate anyone succeeding him.  Perhaps in the doctors' plot the evil
 genius of Stalin, as has been speculated earlier, was moving against

 all his enemies, and perhaps he had planned to use Malenkov for
 this purpose and then discard him.  If this supposition is valid.
 it would appear to have been only a question of time before Stalin,
 realizing Malenkov's independent power position would have set about
 to destroy him.
 25X1
 At any rate Stalin's death prevented this, and left Malenkov
 with his power intact.  This power evidently was not great enough,
 however, to withstand the pressure of the other Soviet leaders, who
 apparently moved at an early.moment to restrict it.  It appears rea-
 sonable to assume that Malenkov gave in to their pressure -- whether
 direct or indirect, spoken or unspoken -- and withdrew from the
 Secretariat.  It is probably true that in so doing he immediately
 began to take steps to minimize the role of the Secretariat.  There
 is some evidence that this has been the case.  It is also probably
 true that the other Soviet leaders wholeheartedly approved of these
 attempts.
 Malenkov's withdrawal, thus does appear to stand as a sign of
 weakness, a sign that he was not able at the outset to inherit all
 the trappings of Stalin's power.  He appeared to have some supporters
 left in the Secretariat, and his influence and power would undoubt-
 edly continue to be felt there.                            But this was not the same as being
 in it himself.  Malenkov, the first ranking member of the Party
 Presidium, but not officially its Chairman, would still have to ac-
 cede to the desires of others.  Stalin also was never formally a
 "Chairman" of the Politburo, but he had certainly acted in this ca-
 pacity and had done more than break tie votes.  In Stalin's absence
 from the Politburo sessions before the war, reliable Soviet defectors
 have reported, Molotov chaired the meetings.
 Krushchev's rise in the Secretariat, first indicated in the
 6 March decree, was confirmed by this announcement.  He was listed
 first in the rankings of the Secretariat, and hence took over the
 day-to-day control of party affairs previously performed by Malenkov.
 Much speculation immediately centered on the political orienta-
 tion of Khrushchev and the other members of the Secretariat, espe-
 cially their relations with Malenkov.  As has been previously noted,
 Khrushchev and Suslov figure prominently in the vigilance cam-
 paign.  While this was not unusual in light of their positions and
 the Party's role in the campaign, it did seem to align them in this
 instance with Malenkov.  In addition their careers were not such as

 25X1
 Approved F r Release 2004/03/22 : CIA-RDP91 T01172RO
 to indicate that they were anti-Male.nkov.I
 appraisals of Khrushchev lay stress on his
 ability to hew a center line, his opportunism and his blind obedience
 to Stalin; yet such appraisals are common to most Soviet leaders.
 Suslov's orientation had come in for a good deal of attention at the
 time he entered the Secretariat in 1947 when Zhdanov was in ascen-
 dancy.  He remained prominent, however, after Zhdanov's death, sug-
 gesting that he had been able to overcome any stigma that may have
 been attached to him in this regard.  His attack on Fedoseyev had
 also served to array him against Voznesensky, a Zhdanov adherent.
 25X1
 With regard to Ignatiev, the authors had previously assumed him
 to be a Malenkov man.  The fact that he was listed after Shatalin and
 Pospelov, rather than before them as had been the case on 6 March,
 was perhaps an omen of his later downfall.  Shatalin was only an alter-
 nate Central Committee member in October, possibly indicating a fall-
 ing out with Malenkov.                         Pospelov, although an old time Bolshevik and
 Party theoretician, had declined in stature prior to Stalin's death.
 There is some indication that he is on close terms with Molotov.
 The braking of the Malenkov propaganda buildup, and the with-
 drawal of Malenkov from the Secretariat, was to be followed in the
 ensuing months by stress on the collegial nature of the leadership;
 it is perhaps reasonable to assert that this concept received the
 Central Committee's formal support in its 14 March meeting.  This
 stress on collegial leadership is best?documented in Soviet and Sat
 ellite propaganda media of the period.
