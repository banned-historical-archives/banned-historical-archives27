 The government added ten civilians to the ruling

 VI ETNAN1
 The addition of ten civil-
 ians to the government's ruling
 Directorate failed to prevent
 moderate Buddhist leaders from
 joining the militants this week
 in opposing the government.
 This closing of ranks prob-
 ably resulted from an agreement
 to utilize nonviolent protests,
 with more emphasis on religious
 themes.   The Buddhists have prob-
 ably concluded that their more
 violent actions had failed either
 to generate sympathy among an
 apathetic public in Saigon or to
 deter firm action by the govern-
 ment.
 Saigon troops have moved
 from Da Nang to within a few miles
 of Hue in preparation for an op-
 eration against the Viet Cong.
 Their proximity to Hue,-however,
 may be intended to back up the
 efforts of wavering local military
 commanders to restore order in
 the city,  and it is possible that,
 the troops may eventually be used
 to put down the "struggle" move-
 ment.
 In response to their approach,
 militant Tri Quang's new clan-
 destine radio urged the Buddhist
 faithful to place their family
 altars in the streets in protest.
 By mid-week,  this tactic had
 clogged main thoroughfares in
 Hue and Quang Tri city;  it was
 being used to a lesser extent in
 Da Nang, Qui Nhon, and Pleiku.
 Tri Quang began a personal hunger
 strike protesting US support of
 the Ky government,  and other Bud-
 dhists hinted at future boycotts
 and other "broader" forms of pas-
 sive resistance.
 In Saigon,  as expected,  the
 Armed Forces Congress--a body of
 senior officers who occupy the
 theoretical seat of government
 power--ratified the slate of new
 civilian nominees to the Direc-
 torate and then overwhelmingly
 endorsed Ky and Thieu as premier
 and chief of state, respectively.
 Military Developments
 Allied and Vietnamese forces
 continued several major offensives
 against Communist troop concentra-
 tions and base areas during the
 past week.
 In the highlands,  in Kontum
 Province,  Operation HAWTHORNE has
 thus far-resulted in enemy losses
 of 187 killed,  as against allied
 casualties of 22 killed and 72
 wounded.   In adjacent Pleiku Prov-
 ince,  the surveillance operation
 on the Cambodian border--codenamed
 PAUL REVERE--had taken more than
 400 enemy lives, in contrast to
 friendly casualties of 36 killed
 (16 US) and 195 wounded (154 US).
 In.c.oastal Binh Dinh Prov-
 ince,  US 1st Air Cavalry Divi-
 si,_on task force elements north-
 east of An Khe terminated the
 highly successful search-and-de-
 stroy Operation CRAZY HORSE.   The
 21-day operation killed 516 Viet
 Cong/North Vietnamese troops com-
 pared with allied losses of 78
 killed (64 US) and 233 wounded
 (198 US).

 Communist military activity
 during the week was highlighted
 by a battalion-sized assault in
 Long Khanh Province,  and by heavy
 mortar attacks in Binh Long and
 Dinh Tuong provinces.
 Although the Vietnamese Com-
 munists are still cautiously non-
 committal in their propaganda
 treatment of the current Buddhist
 protest movements and extremist
 leader Tri Quang,  Communist offi-
 cials of both the Front and
 Hanoi have recently made clear
 in private that they hold out
 little hope for Viet Cong - Bud-
 dhist cooperation in the over-
 throw of the Ky government.
 Communist spokesmen were ex-
 tremely negative about any Front
 gains to be made from the cur-
 rent unrest,  and they were unani-
 mously unenthusiastic about the
 leadership of the-present "strug-
 gle" movement.   Comments on Tri
 Quang ranged from a "wait and
 see attitude" to one of com lete
 dirt
 eral were frequently overesti-
 mated as a political force in
 Mouth Vietnam.
 Evidence continues to mount
 that North Vietnamese President
 Ho Chi Minh has recently been
 or still is in China.   He may have
 taken some of his lieutenants with
 him.   Both Le Duan and Vo Nguyen
 Giap were also out of sight in
 late May.
 Ho is not known to have
 traveled out of the country
 since 1961.   A trip now would
 suggest some serious and as yet
 undefined problem in Sino-DRV re-
 lations--perhaps connected with
 the apparent power struggle in
 Peking--which Hanoi fears might
 adversely affect North Vietnam's
 war effort.   Past problems,  such
 as the Sino-Soviet squabbling
 over the nature and delivery of
 military assistance,  have all
 been worked out by Ho's lieuten-
 ants.

 25X1         Peking propaganda on Vietnam
 has fallen off noticeably in the
 past week,  but this appears to be
 largely a reflection of the exten-
 sive coverage being given to the
 domestic political upheaval.  The
 People's Daily on 8 June,  however,
 strongly supported Hanoi's objec-
 tion to UN involvement in the
 elections scheduled for South
 Vietnam.
 Figures on the infiltra-
 tion of men to South Vietnam dur-
 ing  the first five months of
 1966 now total over 21,000 in
 confirmed,  probable,  and possi-
 ble categories.   This total  is
 more than the entire number ac-
 cepted for 1965.                                                                     An additional
 16,000 infiltrators have been
 reported by captives but not yet
 accepted in any MACV category.
 Many of these men have un-
 doubtedly been used as replace-
 ments for the substantial number
 of casualties.   Nevertheless,
 North Vietnamese strength in South
 Vietnam continues to grow steadily.
 Slightly more than a third of
 the total North Vietnamese/Viet
 Cong Main Force strength  (35,010
 out of a total estimated strength
 of 97,455 men)  is now acce ted
 as North Vietnamese.

 FURTHER DELAY IN I NDONES IAN-MALAYS IAN SETTLEMENT
 Indonesian domestic problems
 appear likely to delay a settle-
 ment with Malaysia for at least a
 month.
 President Sukarno has refused
 to sign the agreement reached on
 1 June by Indonesian Foreign Min-
 ister Malik and Malaysian  Deputy
 Prime Minister Razak at Bangkok.
 Sukarno has continued to insist
 that a plebiscite be held in Ma-
 laysian Borneo before Indonesia
 recognizes Malaysia and other pro-
 visions of the Bangkok agreement
 are implemented.
 In view of Sukarno's intran-
 sigence,  it appears that con-
 frontation cannot be formally
 ended until Indonesian Govern-
 ment leaders further reduce his
 role and strengthen their own po-
 sition through action by the Indo-
 nesian congress  (MPRS),  now tenta-
 tively scheduled to convene in
 mid-June.   Decreasing civilian
 support for the army and developing
 fragmentation among civilian po-
 litical groups, however, could
 cause a postponement or an abrupt
 adjournment of the MPRS session.
 Sukarno is not the only ob-
 struction to speedy settlement
 with Malaysia.   Conservative ele-
 ments in the army have yet to be
 persuaded to the government's
 point of view.   The large and op-
 portunistic Moslem party,  Nahdatu-l
 Ulama,  has openly criticized For-
 eign Minister Malik for his efforts
 to end confrontation.
 Malaysian officials appear
 to understand the domestic complex-
 ities facing Indonesian leaders.
 Plans are going forward for an
 exchange of military missions
 which will maintain close contact
 between the two governments and,
 presumably,  discuss details of
 the eventual implementation of the
 Bangkok agreement.
 On 2 June Djakarta,  following
 up the intention it announced in
 April,  formally extended recogni-
 tion to Singapore.   On 8 June, Ma-
 laysian Prime Minister Rahman, who
 strongly opposed a unilateral move
 by Singapore to normalize relations
 with Djakarta, met with Singapore
 Prime Minister Lee to discuss Dja-
 karta's move.   Following the meet-
 ing it was announced that Singa-
 pore and Malaysia would establish
 relations with Indonesia simulta-
 neously once Djakarta had ratified
 the Bangkok agreements.

 LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE IN PEKING
 Developments in Peking's
 current power struggle strongly
 suggest that the general secre-
 tary of the Chinese Communist
 Party, Teng Hsiao-ping,  is
 edging closer to the top of the
 party-structure.   He is the man
 who has most to gain by the
 ouster of Peng Chen, his poten-
 tial rival for leadership of the
 dominant radical wing of the
 party.   He appears to have been
 behind the reorganization last
 week of the Peking city party
 committee.
 Peng's successor as first
 secretary of the Peking commit-
 tee is Li Hsueh-feng, who served
 as Teng's deputy during the
 1940s  and doubtless owes his
 substantial rise since 1954 to
 Teng's steadily growing influ-
 ence in the highest party coun-
 cils.                            The new second secretary
 of the committee also has past
 connections with Teng.
 It now appears probable
 that Peng, previously ranked
 fifth or sixth in the Chinese
 power structure,  fell into dis-
 favor shortly after his last
 public appearance on 29 March
 and had been formally stripped
 of his power by about mid-May.
 The first phase of the struggle
 seems to have ended, but the
 party press clearly indicates
 that more heads will roll.   New
 attacks have been directed upon
 second-echelon officials in
 several provinces as well as in
 Peking.   The technique is similar
 to that used to build the case
 against Peng,  and the approach
 is equally cautious and delib-
 erate.
 The targets for the new
 phase have not yet been brought
 into focus.   People's Daily
 warned on 4 June,  however,  that
 anyone trying to make China the
 stage for a repetition of "the
 ugly drama of Khrushchev's
 usurpation of party,  army, and
 state power" will be knocking
 his head against a brick wall.
 This suggests that Teng Hsiao-
 ping now will attempt an exten-
 sive housecleaning of potential
 enemies, high or low, replacing
 them with his own men.   The
 reference in the editorial to
 "army" opponents is the first
 sign that military figures may
 soon be implicated.
 While this struggle has
 been going on,  attention to
 developments in the outside
 world has dropped off,  indicat-
 ing top-level concern with the
 more immediate developments at
 home.   The Chinese say that the
 regime's most dangerous enemies
 now are domestic ones.   The
 Liberation Army Journal, which
 has    even n the fore ront of the
 struggle, asserted on 7 June,     25X1
 "Tigers with a smiling face are
 ten times more ferocious than
 tigers with their fangs bared
 and their claws unsheathed."
 ]posters,
 s, an     ocal news-
 papers dealt with domestic
 issues, with "almost nothing" on
 Vietnam or other problems abroad.
 While this is likely to be a
 passing phenomenon,  it looks as
 if foreign affairs are for the
 :moment being managed by secon-
 dary officials following well-

 EAST ASIAN REPRESENTATIVES TO GATHER I N SEOUL
 The Ministerial Meeting for
 Asian and Pacific Cooperation,
 which was originally engineered
 by South Korea as a mechanism
 for enhancing its prestige and
 given little chance of playing
 any significant role, now has
 some prospect of  initiating use-
 ful regional consultations. The
 improved outlook for the confer-
 ence,  scheduled to open in Seoul
 on 14 June, owes much to Thai
 initiatives and a more forward-
 looking Japanese attitude. The
 Thais hosted a preparatory meet-
 ing in Bangkok in April which
 dispelled the fears of some
 would-be participants that the
 meeting would deal primarily with
 controversial military and po-
 litical issues and that it would
 be too obviously pro-Western.
 This was accomplished by formu-
 lating an agenda emphasizing
 cultural and technical coopera-
 tion.   The Thais also have taken
 the lead in persuading the nine
 participating countries to send
 their foreign ministers to en-
 hance the significance of the
 conference.
 The Thais, Filipinos,  and
 Koreans also are eager to ex-
 plore the prospects for a re-
 gional organization.   Others,
 notably the New Zealanders and
 Australians,  regard such discus-
 sion as premature.   They would
 probably be willing, however,
 to consider establishing a perma-
 nent secretariat to facilitate
 regional consultation, provided
 the conferees in Seoul show that
 such a body can and will steer
 clear of controversial issues
 that affect the national inter-
 ests of the participating states.
