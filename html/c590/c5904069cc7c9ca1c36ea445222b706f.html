 VIETNAM:   The Viet Cong's new seven-point pro-
 posal softens the Communists'  position on POW re-
 lease but retains and amplifies a very tough line
 on US disengagement from the war.   In addition, it
 repackages Hanoi's demands for a political settle-
 ment in South Vietnam in a superficially more at-
 tractive forma
 Madame Binh stated. that if the US sets "a ter-
 minal date for the withdrawal from South Vietnam in
 1971 of the totality of US forces" and those of its
 allies,   the Communists and the allies will immedi-
 ately work out arrangements to ensure the safety of
 the withdrawing troops and to release the soldiers
 and civilians "of all parties" who are held as pris-
 oners.   Prisoner release, the statement appeared to
 promise, will be timed to end when withdrawals are
 completed.
 The formulation on the prisoner-release ques-
 tion is new;  up to now the Communists have said only
 that the POW issue would be "discussed" when the US
 set a withdrawal date.   The demand that US military
 disengagement be total--including noncombatants,
 equipment, and bases, as well as combat troops--is
 as firm as ever.   Moreover, by including for the
 first time civilian as well as military prisoners,
 the Communists are opening the whole thorny problem
 of the Communist civilian cadre who are now held by
 Saigon.   The statement carefully obscures the fact
 that there could be a considerable lag between the
 time Washington sets its deadline and the time the
 modalities for withdrawal and prisoner release are
 worked out.
 There are two new nuances in the Communist po-
 sition on a political settlement in South Vietnam.
 Last September's proposal contained an elaborate
 scenario involving the formation of a new non-Commu-
 nist "administration" in'Saigon excluding President
 Thieu, Vice-President Ky,  and Prime Minister Khiem,
 and the establishment of a temporary coalition gov-
 ernment on the basis of negotiations between this

 "administration" and the Communists.   The new state-
 ment retains the same scenario, but Ky and Khiem are
 not mentioned,  and Hanoi simply demands that the US
 "cease backing the bellicose group" headed by Thieu.
 Among other things the Communists seem intent on
 creating the impression that the election of Big
 Minh could prove an initial step toward peace.
 Second, the Communists have replaced their de-
 mand for a coalition government with something less
 precise.   They now say only that a broad "government
 of national concord" will be the outcome of talks
 between a post-Thieu "administration" and the Com-
 munists.                                     They do refer to earlier demands that this
 government have "three segments," including individ-
 uals from the Communists' provisional government and
 from the present Saigon regime as well as "peace-
 loving" people who presently belong to neither.
 Even this demand is less specific than before, how-
 ever,  and the Communists seem to be trying to leave
 the impression that the form of government is open
 to negotiation.   Moreover,  the language of this
 section--and indeed much of the statement--is cast
 to convey an image of conciliation and reasonable-
 ness without committing Hanoi to anything specific.
 The Communists doubtless hope that their ini-
 tiative on the prisoners--coupled as it is with a
 restatement of their basic position on US withdraw-
 als--will make things awkward for the US Government
 both at home and overseas.   They may also believe
 that their political proposals will appeal to many
 in the US who are looking for a face-saving way out
 of the war.   They probably are also hoping that the
 new proposals will fuel worries in Saigon about
 Washington's longer-term support.   The new formula
 for a political settlement in South Vietnam, by its
 fuzziness and air of reasonableness,  is designed
 both to encourage individuals in South Vietnam whose
 support of the war is wavering and to give some am-
 munition to those who are already working to build
 an anti-Thieu,  anti-war constituency.

 CAMBODIA:   Inflation has greatly accelerated
 during the past week and confidence in the currency
 continues to plummet.
 Prices have skyrocketed in Phnom Penh as a
 result of increased military spending, depleted
 stocks of imported items, reduced shipments of
 food into the capital, and early indications of
 a poor rice crop next season.   Beef and pork are
 selling at more than double the normal prices.
 The open market price of rice, which had held
 steady for more than a year, also doubled in a
 matter of days and, despite government rationing
 at official prices, has not fallen appreciably.
 The black market value of the riel has also
 depreciated drastically.   The price of a US dollar
 in Phnom Penh, 250 riels on 21 June, has risen to
 350 riels, reflecting in part further flight of
 Chinese capital.   Chinese merchants, who are hoard-
 ing large quantities of foodstuffs, are undoubtedly
 very apprehensive at the present time and probably
 fear a recurrence of demonstrations against them.
 Some recent developments may eventually help
 restore public confidence.   Cambodia's leadership
 only last week accepted in principle all of the
 fairly sweeping fiscal and monetary reforms recom-
 mended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
 March.   The first shipment of PL-480 agricultural
 commodities arrived in Phnom Penh last week, and
 the US aid program after extended delays now appears
 to be gathering momentum.   Moreover, a multilateral
 exchange support fund recommended by the IMF, if
 established, would help stabilize the exchange
 market and give Ca
 against inflation.

 COMMUNIST CHINA:   Peking's failure to elaborate
 on the achievements of the Cultural Revolution in its
 pronouncement yesterday on the 50th anniversary of
 the Chinese Communist Party dramatically attests to
 the intensity of factional and personal conflicts
 within the ruling politburo.
 The authoritative editorial commemorating the
 occasion--largely a panegyric to the rectitude of
 Mao Tse-tung's "line" and a recounting of the polit-
 ical sins committed by many of his earlier party.
 opponents--was remarkable for the cursory treatment
 it accorded the most momentous purge in the history
 of the Chinese party.   As to be expected, the edi-
 torial severely castigated deposed state chairman
 Liu Shao-chi, but it pointedly omitted censure of
 numerous other opponents uncovered by Mao and his
 radical lieutenants in the cultural Revolution
 Group  (CRG)  in the tumultuous 1966-1968 period; in-
 stead, the editorial flatly stated that "we will
 not go into detail about this revolution."
 The mounting political pressure over the past
 year on the radical ideologues on the politburo has
 cast considerable doubt on the ultimate outcome of
 the Cultural Revolution, and it now appears likely
 that much of its history may be in the process of
 being rewritten.   In particular, the apparent purge
 of Chen Po-ta, Mao's personal secretary and former
 head of the CRG, amid reports that the activities
 of "extremists" are being intensively investigated,
 suggests that Chen, and perhaps other leaders as-
 sociated with him, may be eventually pilloried for
 their "errors" in the Cultural Revolution.   The
 editorial's condemnation of counterrevolutionaries
 who created chaos and sought personal power in the
 "revolution," its call for exposing conspirators
 and renegades still left in the party, its praise
 for the army's role in restoring order, and its em-
 phasis on inner ;party struggle all appear to allude
 to the sharpening in recent months of the battle

 lines between the militants who were in Mao's inner
 circle and a looser grouping of proponents of rela-
 tive moderation on the politburo.
 Continuing tensions throughout the nation's
 leadership hierarchy probably also contributed to
 Peking's failure to indulge in self-congratulation
 over the progress achieved since last year's anni-
 versary in rebuilding the post - Cultural Revolution
 party apparatus.   In any case, the reticence of the
 editorial on the regime's first order of domestic
 business is almost certainly because some key cen-
 tral departments, including the party secretariat,
 have yet to be formally reconstituted, because four
 provinces still lack party committees, and because
 the mere establishment of leading party organs in
 most of China's 29 provinces and special municipali-
 ties has proved no panacea for overcoming the poli-
 tical divisions, passions, and local leadership
 dislocations engendered by the Cultural Revolution.

 INDONESIA:   The army-dominated government
 party seems reasonably assured of winning a plu-
 rality in the parliamentary elections tomorrow.
 The election essentially is a contest between
 Sekber Golkar--an army-affiliated coalition of
 occupational and social groups--on the one hand and
 the nine political parties on the other.  Only two
 of these--the traditionalist Moslem Nahdatul Ulama
 and the secular Nationalist Party, both of them
 strong in densely populated Java--have waged really
 active campaigns.   Their effort has been chiefly
 one of defending themselves against Golkar and
 appealing to the loyalty of their traditional fol-
 lowers.
 The major question now is Golkar's margin of
 victory.   It has coerced and cajoled its way through
 the country, proselyting among groups attached to
 the regular parties and demanding the allegiance of
 national and provincial government employees.   Dja-
 karta's civilian intelligentsia, which generally
 supports the government party, is puzzled as to
 why Golkar and the military have engaged in such
 overkill.   These tactics would seem to have been
 unnecessary and are reported to have inspired a
 negative reaction in some areas.   In any event, it
 seems likely that by one means or another, Sekber
 Golkar will win at least 131 of the 360 elected
 seats which, with the 100 appointed members, would
 give the government a majority in the 460-seat
 parliament.                                                        25X1

 JAPAN:   Tokyo continues to clarify the steps
 under its eight-point trade and capital liberaliza-
 tion program announced last month.
 Tokyo hopes to initiate the program before
 September to counter expected heavy pressure at the
 upcoming meetings of the International Monetary
 Fund and the Japan-US Trade and Economic Joint
 Committee for a reduction of Japan's import barriers
 and large balance-of-payments surplus.   It also
 hopes that these steps will relieve pressures to
 revalue the yen.
 Tokyo this week removed quantitative restric-
 tions on some 20 import items, mainly agricultural
 products and raw materials, that had been slated
 for liberalization in April.  Moreover, at a recent
 meeting of key economic ministers, Finance Minister
 Fukuda made the pitch that the time is overdue for
 action rather than words and pressed for liberaliza-
 tion of additional products, including beef, inte-
 grated circuits,, and computers.
 There also was some indication that additions
 to the eight-point program might be forthcoming
 such as the elimination of the Automatic Import
 Quota System, which, in fact, has not been auto-
 matic but subject to government approval.  More-
 over, Tokyo might further dramatize its liberaliza-
 tion moves by announcing them in packages rather
 than piecemeal, primarily to improve Japan's flag-
 ging business image in the US.  Although top govern-
 ment leaders favor speedy implementation of the
 programs, they are likely to encounter resistance
 from vested Japanese business interests.   Some busi-
 nessmen already have expressed disapproval of lib-
 eralizing computers either as  imports or in capital

 BRAZIL:   Terrorists are planning a kidnaping,
 possibly nvolving a US diplomat.
 Carlos Lamarca, a capable and dedicated revo-
 lutionary who is probably the principal Brazilian
 guerrilla leader, is preparing the kidnap attempt,
 Al-
 t oug  the guerrilla movement has been weakened
 considerably over the last several months by the
 government's aggressive counterterrorist activities
 and a tougher line toward ransom demands, such an
 effort remains a distinct possibility.  The various
 terrorist groups seem to have been driven toward
 unification by recent government successes, and
 they would demonstrate a new vitality with a kid-
 naping.   One report suggests the US ambassador
 will be the target in order to take advantage of
 current difficulties between Brazil and the US
 concerning Brazil's enforcement of its 200-mile
 territorial sea claim.
 During the terrorists' last kidnap operation
 in December, the government forced the guerrillas
 to back off from most of their original demands
 for the exchange of the Swiss ambassador.

 SOUTH AFRICA - FRANCE:   The recently announced
 agreement for the 1~  i ense~c production of French
 Mirage aircraft in South Africa is a significant
 advance in Pretoria's efforts towards a self-suffi-
 cient arms capability.
 Under the agreement signed by the South African
 defense minister during his recent visit to the
 Paris air show, South Africa will produce basic
 elements of Mirage III fighters and Mirage F-1 in-
 terceptors.  Aircraft engines and various sophis-
 ticated components, however, will have to be imported
 from France for several years.   The French reportedly
 also will send technical advisers to South Africa
 and provide training in France for a "large number"
 of South African technicians.   In addition, a French
 Defense Ministry official recently stated that France
 will sell a "complement" of Mirages to South Africa.
 Initial South African production of the Mirage
 IIIs is not expected until 1973 and F-1 production
 presumably will not take place until the mid-70s.
 The F-1 is scheduled to enter production for the
 French Air Force later this year.
 South Africa. has long striven for self-suffi-
 ciency in arms production, particularly since the
 United Nations ordered an arms embargo of South
 Africa in 1963.   The country has since produced
 small arms, light. infantry weapons, French-designed
 armored cars, and Italian-designed jet trainers.
 South Africa also will participate in the production
 of a surface-to-air missile system developed by
 France.   The facilities and experience involved in
 the jet trainer program will provide the South
 Africans with the technical foundation for Mirace
 production.

 NIGERIA:   The military government is adopting
 a more militantly nationalist stance in pursuit of
 its post - civil war aspirations to a leading role
 in Africa.
 The latest reflection of this tendency was Head
 of State Gowon's call at the recent OAU summit in
 Addis Ababa for the liberation of "at least one
 colonial territory within the next three years."
 To accomplish this goal, he urged the early adoption
 of pending recommendations for improving the organ-
 ization's liberation committee.   Gowon reiterated
 his call on his return to Lagos, but declined to
 provide further details for reasons of secrecy.
 Prior to the summit, Nigeria had already taken a
 strong public stand against Ivory Coast's proposal
 for a black African dialogue with South Africa.
 Gowon's rhetoric may lead Nigeria to become
 more heavily involved with the various African
 liberation groups, whether or not this is his real
 intention.   Up to now, Lagos has given little sup-
 port to these organizations.  As of last spring,
 moreover, Lagos was heavily in arrears in its finan-
 cial contribution to the OAU's liberation committee.
 This was largely because of alleged Tanzanian diver-
 sion of arms for liberation movements to secessionist
 Biafra during the Nigerian civil war.   In recent
 months, there have been indications that Nigeria
 was preparing to resume its payments or possibly
 even give some form of direct support to the lib-
 eration movements.   Nigeria's logistical capability
 to provide military support will remain limited for
 some time to come, however, a situation recognized
 by the country's leaders last year when they sent
 a token shipment of arms to Guinea following the
 Portuguese-supported raid on Conakry.

 NOTES
 NATO-SALT:   A few European allies will meet to
 discuss        effect of the Strategic Arms Limitations
 Talks on their interests following the regular US
 briefing to NATO on SALT next Tuesday.
 The European allies have
 been concerned over past Soviet demands for inclu-
 sion of Forward Based Nuclear Systems  (FBS)  in SALT
 and more recently over speculation that FBS might
 be included in talks on Mutual and Balanced Force
 Reductions.(MBFR).   Enhanced prospects for MBFR ne-
 gotiations have probably increased European interest
 in consulting among themselves on the relationship
 among FBS, SALT, and MBFR.
 JAPAN-SWEDEN: A Japanese firm has agreed to
 sell the SweaisTi Navy                 KV-107 helicop-
 In   apan   er a licensing
 ters that are produceJ
 agreement with the US.   The helicopters, which can
 be used for transport, minesweeping, or search and
 rescue missions,, reportedly will be delivered in
 1973-1974 as replacements for obsolete US helicop-
 ters.   Because Japanese policy prohibits the sale
 of arms and equipment to foreign countries for mili-
 tary purposes, Tokyo probably will maintain publicly
 that Sweden wants the helicopters for search and
 rescue missions,.

 TRUCIAL STATES:        The ruler of Abu Dhabi intends
 to re ormisgovernment to include 12 ministries,
 a consultative assembly of tribal leaders, a court
 system,  and a civil service.         At present, Abu Dhabi,
 like the other Trucial States,  is an absolute autoc-
 racy in domestic affairs.   Foreign affairs and de-
 fense are handled by the British Government.   The
 Persian Gulf amirates are scheduled to form a fed-
 eration in late 1971,. but Bahrain and Qatar now ap-
 pear intent on following an independent course.   Be-
 cause Abu Dhabi. would be left as the most important
 entity in a smaller seven-state grouping, the ruler
 is apparently grooming his government to function
 more effectively in its leading role.
