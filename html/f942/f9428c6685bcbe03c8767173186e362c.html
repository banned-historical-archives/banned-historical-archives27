 INDOCHINA
 In the first Vietnamese communist comment on the Paris talks since
 the end of July, a NHAN DAN Commentator article on 21 September
 says that neither the replacement of Bruce by Ambassador Porter nor
 "recent statements" by the President have indicated any change in
 the U.S. attitude.  Commentator spells out points one and two of
 the PRG's 1 July seven-point proposal and complains that the Nixon
 Administration "has always said no to this correct and well-meaning
 stand."  Vietnamese communist media carried the standard, cursory
 account of the 16 September session of the Paris talks.  And there
 is no acknowledgment of Ambassador Porter's attempts to get the
 communist delegates to confirm or deny reports--by Americans who have
 interviewed them--that the matter of U.S. troop withdrawal and the
 release of prisoners can be dealt with separately from the question
 of a political settlement in South Vietnam.
 Moscow continues routinely to accuse the United States of
 procrastinating at, the Paris talks and of refusing to answer the
 PRG peace proposal.  At the same time Moscow, continues to publicize
 its aid to Vietnam, reviewing economic and military aid provided
 over the years and calling attention to current relief aid being
 sent in connection with the floods in the DRV.
 The heavy U.S. air strikes against North Vietnam on 21 September
 are condemned in a DRV Foreign Ministry statement on the 22d--the
 first protest at that level since March of this year.  The statement
 appeals to the socialist countries as well as U.S. and world public
 opi.nion "to resolutely struggle to check the Americans' criminal
 hands."
 Hanoi propaganda on the 10-18 September visit of a high-level
 Japanese Communist Party delegation to the DRV avoided the anti-
 Chinese polemical themes that had marked North Vietnamese propaganda
 in July and August following the announcement of President Nixon's
 planned visit to Peking.  Polemical remarks by the delegation head,
 party Chairman Kenji Miyamoto, were omitted in Hanoi's reports, and
 the joint communique released at tile close of the visit does not
 even bring up the issue of world communist unity or the principle
 of the independence of individual parties.

 when he first participated, a NHAN DAN Commentator article on
 the 21st says that the conference has not been moved. forward
 either by his taking over from Ambassador Bruce or by the
 President's "recent statements."  As broadcast in Hanoi radio's
 domestic service, the article says that no change in the U.S.
 attitude or policy has been api,arent since the net, chief
 negotiator took over, and it adds cryptically that at the
 9 September session Porter proposed holding restricted meetings
 while at the session on the 16th he asked for further
 clarification of the PRG's seven-point initiative.  Commentator
 dismisses this as "more of the tortuous maneuvers" to which
 the Nixon Administration has resorted in attempting to cope
 with public opinion.
 The unchanged U.S. policy, Commentator says, was made clear
 when "Nixon himself said on 17 September" that "the United
 States would continue to keep its eye on the main objective,
 which is 'a South Vietnam able to defend itself against a
 communist takeover' and the 'release of our POW's."  The
 article adds that what the President implied is that he is
 bent on pursuing his Vietnamization policy, which precludes any
 real effort to negotiate a Vietnam settlement.  (The allusion
 is clearly to the President's statement in his press conference
 on the 16th, not the 17th, when he in fact said "the main
 objective is to end the American involvement just as soon as
 that is consistent with our over-all goal, which is a South
 Vietnam able to defend itself against a communist takeover and
 which includes, from our standpoint, our primary interest in
 obtaining the relea6e of our POW's.")
 While Commentator does not explicitly refer to the President's
 press conference,* it was mentioned on the 18th--in a
 Liberation Radio broadcast and a Hanoi radio item in
 Mandarin--and in a 19 September NHAN DAN commentary pegged. to the
 "struggle" 7.n South Vietnam.  Only the latter mentioned the
 President's remarks on prisoners, stating that the President
 "revealed his intention" to continue the war while carrying on
 *  Hanoi and PRG media, atypically, completely ignored the
 President's 4 August press conference in which he spoke about
 his planned trip to China as well as about Vietnam.  The last
 Presidential interview which prompted a NHAN DAN Commentator
 article was that on 16 April 1971 before the American Society of
 Newspaper Editors.  Hanoi commented on a lower level on his
 press conferences of 29 April, 1 May, and 1 June.

 the pretense about his "primary interest in obtaining the release
 of our POW's."  All three items, however, said that the President
 defended the 3 October presidential election in South Vietnam
 even though Thieu is the only candidate.
 The NHAN DAN Commentator article--which spells out the provisions
 of points one and two--is the first Vietnamese communist comment
 on the Paris talks or negotiations since July when the PRG's
 seven-point proposal was being pressed.   (There was, most recently,
 a NHAN DAN Commentator article on 25 July and a Liberation Radio
 commentary on the 31st,)  It is unclear what prompted the comment
 at this level at this time, but it seems most likely that it was a
 combination of circumstances--Ambassador Porter's assumption of
 his post, the President's press conference, and perhaps the recent
 flurry of speculation in the U.S. press, particularly pegged to
 Senator McGovern's remarks on his talks in Paris, that the communists
 are flexible about their proposals and willing to separate points one
 and two.  The VITA account of the Paris session on the 16th,
 predictably, gave no hint of Ambassador Porter's attempts to get the
 communist delegates to confirm or deny reports that there had been
 changes or clarifications of their negotiating position.  In its
 standard, cryptic fashion, VNA dealt with the U.S. representative by
 saying that he "again resorted to the old trick of asking questions
 so as to avoid answering" the PRG proposal.
 VNA mentioned the give-and-take following the presentation of the
 formal statements only when it reported that Thuy in "additional
 remarks" said the U.S. representative's "allegations" at the
 session prove that the Nixon Administration refuses to withdraw
 U.S. troops in 1971 and "to get rid of the bellicose Nguyen Van
 Thieu clique, thus impeding the progress" of the Paris talks.
 Thus, there is no acknowledgment of his question whether the United
 States is willing to announce a troop withdrawal and an end to the
 "maintenance" of the Thieu regime "at the same time."  In line
 with standard practice, Hanoi media did not report the post-session
 briefings*; hence there i s no acknowledgment that reporters
 pressed the communist spokesmen on the issue of whether troop
 withdrawal and the release of prisoners can be settled
 separately or whether they are interdependent.
 *  The DRV's long-standing practice has been to transmit its
 "memoranda" on the communist press briefings back to Hanoi on
 VNA's information and service channel, but not to report the
 briefings in any of its propaganda media.

 DRV FOREIGN MINISTRY PROTESTS HEAVY U.S. AIR STRIKES AT NORTH
 The heavy, sustained U.S. air strikes against the DRV on 21 September
 prompted a DRV Foreign Ministry statement rather than another of
 the usual, continuing protests against air strikes by the
 spokesman for the foreign ministry.  The most recent previous
 protest at the more authoritative foreign ministry level was
 issued on 22 March 1971 in connection with the concentrated
 strikes of 21-22 March.  Before that there were DRV Foreign
 Ministry protests over heavy air strikes on 21 November and
 1-2 May in 1970.* The current statement, like the three previous
 ones, says that the air strikes violate the U.S. bombing halt
 and threaten the work of the Paris conference.  But at this
 writing Vietnamese communist media have not carried the
 announcement--reported by Western news agencies--that the DRV
 and PRG delegates will not attend the 23 September session
 of the Paris talks and asked for a resumption of the talks on
 the 30th.**
 The current statement charges that the United States "mobilized
 more than 200 aircraft" to conduct "repeated strikes against
 many populated areas in Quang Ninh and Le Thuy districts,
 Qiiang Binh Province."  It also charges that the strikes
 "killed or injured a number of civilians, including many old
 people, women, and children and destroyed many homes."  The
 statement claims that the U.S. acts were "appropriately
 punished" and that the Quang Binh armed forces and people
 downed two planes "and damaged many others."  A Hanoi radio
 broadcast early on the 22d had reported the downings, saying
 they brought the total of downed U.S. planes to 3,999.  (The
 U.S. Command, in reporting the sustained strikes, said that
 no U.S. planes were hit and that all returned safely to their
 bases in South Vietnam and Thailand.)
 *   While a 3 March 1971 foreign ministry statement came on the
 heels of U.S. announcements of concentrated strikes against the
 North, it did not acknowledge them but focused instead on alleged
 U.S. plans for "new military adventures" against the DRV.
 **  The communist delegates asked for a postponement of the weekly
 Paris session in each of the three previous instances.  After the
 postponement of the 25 March session at the communists' request,
 the allied delegates asked for a postponement of the 1 April
 session.  Although in March the Foreign Ministry statement was
 issued three days before the next scheduled Paris session, VNA
 did not report the delegations' statements that they would not
 attend the session until 0519 GMT on the 25th.

 Unlike the previous three foreign ministry statements, the
 current one appeals to the socialist countries, peace- and
 justice-loving countries, and U.S. public opinion "to
 resolutely struggle to check the Americans' criminal hands
 and to intensify their support of the Vietnamese people's
 just cause until total victory."  But it echoes the
 21 November 1970 statement when it says the strikes
 "constitute an insolent challenge to peace- and justice-
 loving public opinion in the world and the United States."
 (The 3 March 1971 statement--at a time when Hanoi seemed to
 be displaying particular concern--claimed in addition that
 U.S. acts against the DRV constituted "an impudent challenge
 to the socialist countries" and others.)
 In more severe language than that of the three previous state-
 ments, the current one says the DRV Government sternly condemns
 "these extremely grave and criminal acts of war" and places
 full responsibility on the United States.  The 22 March and
 21 November statements on air strikes merely condemned the
 "acts of war," while the 1 May statement called them "criminal".
 The expression of resolve to persevere in struggle against the
 United States is common, of course, to all the statements.
 RADIO CG+IENT      In the same domestic service program on the
 22d that carried the foreign ministry statement,
 Hanoi radio broadcast a commentary scoring the U.S. strikes and
 hailing the alleged feat of the Qiang Binh "armed forces and
 people" in downing the planes.  Stating that the new "barbarous
 war acts" have further exposed the Nixon Administration's
 "stubborn and bellicose nature," the commentary adds:
 "Ballyhooing about its so-called good will for peace and about
 ite will to negotiate, Nixon's bellicose hands" have continued
 to press the war and Vietnamization.  It asserts that the
 President's "pledge of support" has enabled Thieu to carry out
 its bloody campaign of terror" in South Vietnam and that it was
 on President Nixon's orders that the planes carried out their

 NTME. BINH STOPS IN MOSCOW, PEKING ON WAY HOME FROM PAR I S
 MOSCOW     PRG Foreign Minister Nguyen Thi Binh's 11-14 September
 stopover in Moscow on her way home to Hanoi from tha
 Paris talks received minimal publicity.  Her arrival in Moscow,
 after a 6-11 September visit- to Poland, was briefly reported by
 TASS that day, and PRAVDA on the 12th noted that she was met at
 the airport by Deputy Foreign Minister Firyubin.  A short
 PRAVDA report on the 14th noted that Gromyko hosted her at a
 luncheon the day before.  According to PRAVDA on the 16th,
 Firyubin saw her off on the 14th.
 During her last stop in Moscow en route home from Paris, from
 11 to 13 June 1970, brief PRAVDA and TASS reports indicated
 that she was again met at the airport by Firyubin, but there
 were no reports that she had talks with any Soviet officials.*
 PEKING     NCNA on 16 September reported at some length on the
 warm welcome accorded Mme. Binh on her arrival at
 Peking's airport that day "on her way home from Paris."  It
 said she deplaned "amid cheers and the beating of drums and
 gongs" to be greeted by a flag- and banner-waving crowd and
 the dancing of "merry children" at the airport "permeated
 with a very warm atmosphere of the great friendship and
 militant unity of the people of China and Vietnam."  She was
 accompanied by PRG Ambassador to Poland Tran Van Tu and was
 met, according to NCNA, by leading government and party
 officials--led by Acting Foreign Minister Chi Peng-fei--
 and by leading members of various organizations.  The report
 did not mention the Paris talks.
 Mme. Binh was feted at a welcoming banquet hosted by Chi
 Peng-fei on the evening of the 16th.  On the 17th she was
 "called on" by Chou En-lai in the afternoon and had "a very
 cordial and friendly conversation" with Chou, Chiang Ching,
 and Chi Peng-fei that evening, according to an NCNA report
 of the 17th.  On the 18th NCNA said that Mme. Binh met with
 Her return to Paris in August 1970 followed visits to
 India, Ceylon, Tanzania, and Zambia, and there were thus no
 stops in Peking and Moscow.

 Sihanouk that day.  Chou and Chi Peng-fei gave a banquet on the
 19th in her honor, NCNA said.  No speeches or toasts were reported
 for either the banquet on the 16th or that on the 19th.  NCNA
 announced her departure "for Vietnam" on the 22d; she was seen
 'J1:' by the same group which had met her on arrival with the
 exceptioi. of Fang I, who was not present for her departure.
 In contrast, time. Binh's 13 June 1970 arrival in Peking "on her
 way home from Paris" was not reported until the 17th, when a
 single brief Peking domestic service item noted that Chou
 En-lai had had a "warm and friendly talk" with her that day
 and had given an "informal banquet" in her honor.  As this
 time, no speeches or toasts were reported.  Peking media
 gave no other publicity to that visit.
 MOSCOW STREFSES AID TO DRV. ASSAILS SINO-i.S. "MANEUVERS"
 Moscow continues to publicize its aid to Vietnam in routine-level
 comment.  A 17 September IZVESTIYA article by Ilinskiy, for
 example, echoed some recent comment in reviewing Soviet economic
 and military aid given over the years in crap detail as regards
 type and volume.*  An article  -i Soviet aid transported, by sea,
 in the Kiev PRAVDA UKRAINY on the 15th, said among other things
 that in the first half of 1971 "enough cargo to fill 380 trains
 was brought to the DRV by sea."  On the 17th the Moscow domestic
 service reported that Soviet ships were unloading cargoes in
 Haiphong "for the DRV national economy" that are "particularly
 necessary" at present when the-Vietnamese are overcoming the
 effects of the floods.
 Moscow currently plays up Vietnamese gratitude for Soviet relief
 aid sent in connection with the floods.  On 13 September TASS
 reported the arrival in Hanoi that day of three Soviet cargo
 planes with medicines, food, and clothing sent by the Soviet
 *  A 2 September PRAVDA article and Vice Premier Novikov's
 speech at a 31 August Moscow meeting on DRV National Day, for
 instance, referred to industrial projects the USSR built in
 the DRV, the training of specialists, and military aid
 such as planes and rockets.

 Red Cross Society.  TASS on the 17th and PRAVDA the next day
 reported a message from Le Duan to Brezhnev thanking him for
 a sympathy message of 2 September and for the relief aid
 sent by the USSR.  The only known official Soviet message
 on the floods to have previously been reported by Moscow was
 dated 30 August and belatedly reported briefly by TASS on
 2 September and in full by PRAVDA on the 3d.  The message
 was sent by "the CPSU Central Committee, the USSR Supreme
 Soviet Presidium, and the USSR Council of Ministers" and did
 not mention Brezhnev by name.  To date, Hanoi media are not
 known to have publicized the Le Duan message.*
 In its continuing campaign to discredit Chinese motives in
 inviting President Nixon to visit Peking, routine-level Moscow
 comment repeats the charge that Peking hopes to reach an
 agreement on the Indochina question "behind the backs" of
 the people of the region.  The 4 September PRAVDA article by
 I. Aleksandrov broadly attacking Peking's divisive policies,
 which includes the charge that a "deal" at the expense of
 the Indochinese people is being planned, has continued to
 be rebroadcast by Moscow radio in installments as recently
 as 20 September.**  Much of Moscow's current comment consists
 of replays of articles in the organs of foreign communist
 parties which charge that the United States also hopes to
 make a deal and claim that the invitation has enabled the
 President to avoid responding to the PRG's peace initiative.
 Moscow's minimal attention to President Nixon's 16 September
 press conference includes a domestic service commentary which
 focuses on his remarks on the Thieu government.  It says that
 the President defended the regime's conduct of the election
 "farce" and stated that the United States will continue
 supporting that regime so that it can "withstand the communist
 threat"; it does not mention the President's comment on the
 release of U.S. prisoners.  The commentary contrasts President
 Nixon's remarks with those made in Saigon by Senator McGovern,
 who spoke of the failure of Vietnamization and of the corruption
 in Saigon and called for a U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam.
 *   Peking has not mentioned relief aid to the DRV since the PRC
 leaders' sympathy messages on 25 and 29 August and 2 September
 promised "relief" measures and "all-out support and assistance"
 to the Vietnamese people in overcoming the floods.  However, VNA
 on 19 September announced the arrival of both Chinese and Soviet
 relief shipments.

 DRV PROPAGANDA ON JAPANESE CP VISIT AVOIDS POLEMICAL ISSUES
 Hanoi propaganda on the 10-18 September visit to the DRV of the
 Japanese Communist Party (JCP) delegation led by Chairman Kenji
 Miyamoto* points up the sharp curtailment of the anti-Chinese
 polemics which marked North Vietnamese propaganda for six
 weeks following the 15 July announcement of President Nixon's
 planned visit to Peking.  Not only have Hanoi statements
 during the visit failed to raise the questions of socialist
 unity or the independence of individual parties, but Hanoi
 media have ignored even mildly polemical statements by Miyamoto
 on these and other issues.
 On 14 September Hanoi carried brief accounts of an 11 September
 reception for the JCP delegation at which Vietnamese party (VWP)
 First Secretary Le Duan and Chairman Miyamoto spoke.  Hanoi's
 cursory reports ignored remarks by Miyamoto--published in full
 in the JCP organ AKAHATA on the 15th--which were in line with
 Hanoi's previous public polemic following the announcement of
 President Nixon's plans to visit Peking.
 Among other things, Miyamoto warned that the United States
 "has pursued a policy of 'divide and strike' against the
 socialist camp and national liberation forces" and underlined
 the importance of "the international solidarity of the broad
 anti-imperialist forces in their struggle to support the
 Indochinese people."  In addition, he urged unity among
 communist and anti-imperialist forces in the face of "insidious
 tricks" by the United States on the Indochina question,
 asserted that the JCP never had "any illusions about the aggressive
 nature of U.S. imperialism," and denounced the views of "certain
 people in Japan who have suddenly begun to idealize Nixon as an
 'apostle of peace' in commenting on the way he has been handling
 matters recently."  (This transparent reference to President
 Nixon's projected China visit echoes earlier JCP comment--for
 example, in an article in the 21 August AKAHATA--which scored
 opposition parties in Japan for claiming that the decision to
 make the trip represents a favorable change in U.S. policy and
 charged that, on the contrary, the visit was aimed at diverting
 public attention from U.S. "aggression" in Indochina.)
 *  When the Miyamoto delegation left Japan on 19 August, AKAHATA
 announced that it would visit Romania, Italy, North Vietnam, and
 the Soviet Union.  The delegation is now on the last leg of its
 tour, paying an official visit in Mosccw.

 Monitored' Hanoi media have not even mentioned a 17 September
 Pham Van Dong meeting with the JCP delegation which AKAHATA
 reported on the 19th.  Miyamoto remarked on this occasion,
 according to the JCP paper, that the North Vietnamese party
 and government, "in a complex situation," are "pushing
 their independent activities while strengthening unity with
 the anti-imperialist forces in the world."  Hanoi radio did
 broadcast the text of a nonpolemical speech delivered by
 Miyamoto at a 16 September Hanoi meeting, in which the, JCP
 leader made no reference to the socialist camp but did state
 that the Vietnamese "struggle is a positive contribution to
 the unification of all anti-imperialist forces."
 The communique issued at the close of the JCP visit refers
 to the solidarity of the two parties but mentions neither
 the importance of communist unity nor alleged U.S. efforts
 to split the socialist countries.  The communique does label
 the United States the "arch enemy" of the world and holds
 that the Indochinese problem "has always remained the focal
 point of the duel on a world scale between imperialism and
 anti-imperialist forces."
 In contrast to the JCP-VWP document, earlier joint communiques
 issued by the Miyamoto delegation with the Romanian, Italian,
 and Spanish communist parties uniformly called for efforts
 to unify communist and anti-imperialist forces and for respect
 for each party's autonomy and independence.*  The communique
 with the Romanians particularly emphasized the issue of
 communist unity; it declared that the two parties "consider
 that one of the present tasks of greatest importance is to
 firmly campaign for the unity of all the democratic, progressive,
 and anti-imperialist forces, with the participation of the
 Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian peoples."
 *  The JCP communique with the Romanian party was released on
 3 September at the close of the Miyamoto delegation's visit to
 Romania, which began on 20 August.  AKAHATA on 6 September
 published a communique signed jointly with a delegation of the
 Spanish CP following talks between those two parties in late
 August; the Spanish CP delegation with' which the Japanese
 conferred was in Romania from 6 August to 1 September.  The
 JCP communique with the Italian party was released following
 Miyamoto's 3-8 September visit to Italy.

 DRV CAUTION        Hanoi's failure even to join with the JCP
 TOWARD PEKING      in an appeal for communist unity may reflect
 the delicate position of the DRV in playing
 host to representatives of a party openly hostile to the
 Chinese leaders. But Hanoi's new caution with respect to
 Peking was already apparent in its propaganda prior to the JCP
 delegation's visit and seems to reflect a decision by the DRV
 leaders to call a halt to public censure of Peking's moves
 vis-a-vis the United States.
 Hanoi media have not pressed warnings about U.S. maneuvers to
 split the socialist camp or assertions of DRV independence
 since the end of August.  The last major polemical attack was
 the 22 August NHAN DAN Commentator article blasted the
 Chinese as "opportunist." An editorial on the 19 August
 anniversary of the August Revolution, published in the QUAN
 DOI NHAN DAN mor:thly magazine and broadcast by Hanoi on
 29 August, did reiterate Hanoi's argument that the Vietnamese
 must decide their own fate.  But Pham Van Dong's 31 August
 national day address did not raise the issue of DRV
 independence or include the standard reference to the need
 to consolidate the socialist camp.*  Similarly, Hanoi
 propaganda marking the 3 September second anniversary of Ho
 Chi Minh's death did not recall the appeal in Ho's testament
 for the restoration of unity among communist parties.
 Hanoi media's treatment of the 22 August Commentator article
 and of an earlier QUART DOI NHAN DAN article on 3 August by
 "Chien Thang" (The Victor)* attacking the Chinese had
 suggested that there might have been some disagreement in
 August over publicity for ;urther criticism of Peking.
 While Hanoi's first attacks in July  on Peking's invitation
 to the President were promptly publicized in Hanoi's domestic
 radio service, the Chien Thang article was not broadcast and
 was only belatedly summarized by VNA eight days after its
 *   Pham Van Dong's 1970 national day speech noted that the
 DRV had endeavored to restore the solidarity of the socialist
 camp and thus was consistent with other DRV statements in
 the wake of the testament, released after Ho's death in
 September 1969, which appealed for the party to attempt to
 unify the socialist camp.

 publication.  The 22 August Commentator article, the most bitter
 of the attacks on Peking, was similarly not broadcast in the
 domestic service, although excerpts were carried by VNA and in
 Hanoi radio's Mandarin-language service.  (A translation of the
 text of the Commentator article as published in NHAN DAN is
 still not available.)
 MIYAMOTO'S     Miyamoto last headed a JCP delegation to the DRV
 1966 TOUR      in February 1966, in the course of a tour that
 included official visits to China and North Korea.
 Undertaken just prior to the 23d CPSU Congress, the tour appeared
 to be aimed at seeking some basis for unifying the world communist
 movement in support of Vietnam.*  The joint JCP,VWP communique in
 1966 said both sides held that "at present the formation and
 expansion of a united front of the world's people against U.S.
 imperialism, for peace and national independence is an extremely
 important and urgent task."  No joint communique was released at
 the close of Miyamoto's visit to China, but in January 1967--
 following the deterioration of relations between Peking and to
 Japanese party- AKAHATA revealed that a communique had been
 drafted and approved by a CCP delegation headed by Chou En-lai
 but that Mao would not consent to its publication because the
 JCP refused to include a call for a united front against both
 the United States and the Soviet Union.
 An article published in the 9 September 1971 issue of AKAHATA,
 .just prior to the arrival of the current Miyamoto mission in
 Hanoi, referred to the 1966 dispute with Peking and claimed
 that the CCP's theory of an "anti-U.S. and anti-Soviet united
 front" had met with "complete failure."  The article--full
 text of which is not yet available--noted that joint
 communiques signed by the CCP with other parties since last
 year had not criticized the Soviet Union.  The article goes on,
 however, to charge that "the great-power chauvinists of the
 CCP have.not abandoned, once and for all, the 'anti-U.S. and.
 anti-Soviet' policy."  It explains that Peking has refrained
 from directly pressing this policy to avoid being "isolated:'in
 the international arena," but that the Chinese continue to
 indicate their position by the use of "sub3titute terms" such
 as references to opposing "superpowers."

 HANOI REPORTS FIGHTING IN U MINH JUNGLE, NOTES LAM SON 810
 Vietnamese communist media reflect the stepped-up fighting in the
 U Minh jungle of South Vietnam, with reports that the PLAF on
 14-16 September launched heavy attacks on allied positions
 there.  An article in the 19 September QUAN DOl NHAN DAN claims
 that the PLAF'has foiled the allied pacification operation in
 the U Minh area; it recalls that a large-scale allied operation
 was begun in the area last December and that new forces were
 sent there in May.  From December through August, according to
 the paper, "liberation forces" in the area have put out of
 action more than 11,000 allied troops.  The article comments
 that the allies "could not drive out the liberation forces"
 but that, "on the contrary, the U Minh resistance base has
 become stronger and the people's war has further developed."
 The recently concluded ARVN operation in northern Quang Tri--
 Lam Son 810--has been mentioned in passing in Hanoi comment
 praising PLAF action in the area in past weeks.*  An article
 in the 16 September QUAN DOl NHAN DAN, for example, recalled
 communist attacks on ARVN positions last August and said
 that "to save the puppet troops from danger, the U.S. command
 ordered massive fire-support and sent many American battalions
 back to Highway 9 to support the puppets in their highly
 touted 'Operation Lam Son 810.1"  The article claimed that
 recent battles demonstrated that the defense line along
 Highway 9 has been "attacked and broken through."

 the alleged downing of a U.S. plane over the DRV on 7 September.

 EAST GERMANY-USSR-PRC
 GDR PARTY WARNS AGAINST CHINESE ANTI-SOVIET DIVISIVE TACTICS
 Soviet bloc concern over Peking's contacts with the United
 States and efforts to penetrate the Balkans is registered for
 the first time at the party leadership level in a Politburo
 report delivered by Hermann Axen to the SED Central Committee
 on 16 September.  As summarized by the East German news agency,
 the report indicates that China's new flexible tactics were a
 focal point of discussion at the 2 August Crimea meeting of
 Soviet bloc leaders and that the upshot was a plan for
 coordinated efforts to "first and foremost strengthen the alliance
 of the socialist community" (counter Chinese diplomatic activity
 and try to bring the Romanians into line) and to press Moscow's
 diplomatic offensive ,,ith both "the socialist countries" (Hanoi
 and Belgrade) and the capitalist states.
 In line with earlier Soviet bloc press comment on the PRC's
 invitation to President Nixon, the SED report pays lip service
 to the desirability of improved Chinese-American relations in
 accordance with international norms, then drives home the point
 that "at the same time, it cannot be overlooked that Peking's
 'flirtation' with Washington is undoubtedly inspired by anti-
 Sovietism and antisocialist aims and is therefore directed
 against the anti-imperialist liberation movement and peoples."
 In passages clearly addressed chiefly to the Romanians and in
 a lesser degree to the Albanians and Yugoslavs, the report
 says that "efforts of the Mao group to come to terms with the
 imperialists are accompanied by a striking intensification of
 the Chinese leadership's activities in the Balkans."  It adds
 that the Chinese leaders are exploiting "certain nationalist
 tendencies deviating from proletarian class positions"--trends
 "which manifest themselves, for example, in the approval ex-
 pressed by Maoist slogans for the so-called cultural revolution
 and the 'struggle against the superpowers.'"  Further, it says,
 they "seek to undermine the unity of the community of socialist
 states."
 Maintaining that this Chinese "venture has no realistic pro-
 spect" of success, Axen's report states that these developments
 in the Balkans "must be watched for the present."  In this
 context, as if to underscore the right of the Soviet bloc to
 monitor "socialism" in the area and take action if necessary

 to defend it, the report adds that "the course of historical
 development is determined neither by Mao Tse-tung nor by
 Richard Nixon, but first and foremost by the growing might
 and unity and community of socialist states, with the USSR
 as its principal force."
 TASS TREATMENT     TASS picked up the ADN account of the SED
 OF ADN REPORT      report on the 17th, including the comments
 on U.S.-Chinese relations but deleting the
 warning on the Balkans.  This followed the pattern of Moscow's
 treatment of earlier veiled threats to the Romanians emanating
 from the East European press organs in the wake of the Crimea
 summit.  Moscow did not publicize the 13 August Budapest MAGYAR
 HIRLAP article raising the spectre of an anti-Soviet, pro-Peking
 Tirana-Belgrade-Bucharest axis in t!ie Balkans.  And a PRAVDA
 account of a 14 August NEUES DEUTSCHLAND article deleted the
 East German paper's warning--clearly directed at the Romanians--
 that "anyone who pursues a policy of tolerance and concession
 toward the Mao group's great power chauvinism... violates the
 fundamental principles of proletarian internationalism."  But
 the PRAVDA summary of the article included NEtTES DEUTSCHLAND's
 demand that communists"decisively repudiate the unprincipled
 divisive policy of the Chinese leaders" and its call for "a
 struggle against all aspects of opportunism, against anti-
 Sovidtisnand nationalism"--the latter a codeword for the
 Romanian deviation.
 Thus Moscow's propaganda tactics at this juncture appear to
 emphasize continued use of the proxy of its East European
 allies to apply periodic pressure on the Romanians, while
 concentrating in its own media on discrediting the Chinese
 as warmongers and projecting a positive image of the USSR
 as a champion of peace and detente as a backdrop to the
 Soviet leadership's wooing of Tito and its other fall diplo-
 matic activities.
 CEAUSESCU DENIES ROMANIA HAS SINNED AGAINST INTERNATIONALISM
 In apparent response 'to the-East German party's-charges
 that some Balkan countries have violated the principles
 proletarian internationalism, Romanian party chief Ceausescu
 used the occasion of a party aktiv meeting on the evening-of
 the 16th,. several hours after ADN.carried the SED report, to
 make an unusually detailed and assertive defense of Romania's
 loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism--as

 interpreted in Bucharest.  Forcefully rejecting the idea that
 his country has placed its national interests above its inter-
 nationalist obligations, Ceausescu stated that "Just as we have
 never neglected our national duties, neither have we neglected
 our international duties." Declaring that when one speaks of
 internationalism one must "refer not to slogans but to deeds,"
 he went on to list Romania's contributions to the communist
 movement from the days of the Paris commune to its solidarity
 today with the North Vietnamese.
 Ceausescu defined Romania's view of proletarian internationalism
 in stating:  "Our party's internationalism is reflected in the
 continuous development of relations with all the communist and
 workers' parties . . ., in the fight for strengthening communist
 unity and cooperation on the basis of respect for the right of
 each party to self-dependently work out its own political line."
 And he argued by implication against the Soviet bloc view of
 Balkan security under Moscow's hegemony in adding pointedly that
 the Romanian definition of proletarian internationalism includes
 struggling for the establishment of "a climate of trust and close
 cooperation among the Balkan countries that should make of this
 zone a region of peace in Europe and permit each Balkan country
 to devote its energies to the respective people's progress and
 welfare."  He emphasized again that the Romanian concepts of both
 internationalism and European security are based on respect "for
 sovereignty and independence, mutual advantage, and refraining
 in interstate relations from the threat or use of force."
 In effect summarizing the message for his communist neighbors
 that Romania will not be intimidated by propaganda pressures,
 Ceausescu concluded that it is in the spirit of these princi-
 ples that Romania has acted in the past and "will continue to
 act in the future, too, as we consider that in this way we are
 implementing our duty both toward our people and to the cause
 of socialism and peace."
 Further testimony to Bucharest's intention to pursue contacts
 with the Chinese was provided by an 18 September NCNA report
 on the arrival in Peking of a group of "vacationing" Romanian
 army officers led by General Ion Tutoveanu, Director of the
 Military Academy of the Romanian Armed Forces.  NCNA said the
 group was met by Peng Shao-hui, deputy chief of the PLA General
 Staff.

 ZAGREB PRESS, RADIO ASSAIL GDR MEDDLING IN BALKAN AFFAIRS
 Against the background of efforts by Belgrade's semiofficial
 BORBA and POLITIKA to prepare propaganda, groundwork for
 Brezhnev's arrival by dwelling on the "traditional friend-
 ship" of the Soviet and Yugoslav peoples, the more free-
 wheeling Zagreb press and radio have responded critically
 to the SED's expression of concern over the situation in the
 Balkans.  Zagreb's VJESNIK, which recently published a lengthy
 interview with Chou En-lai, commented in an article on the
 18th that the SED report is "impermissible interference in
 the affairs of others."  It added that "the pharisee-like
 East German concern over an imagine^i Chinese penetration into
 the Balkans is in fact unworthy of polemics."  The article
 nevertheless went on to wonder why "it has been precisely the
 SED which has taken over the relay race baton from the Hungarian
 newspaper [MAGYAR HIRLAP].,.whieh started as a warning and now
 already is turning into a campaign."  Noting the timing of the
 release of the SED report, the Zagreb paper asked further whether
 it might be "a possible accompanying tune or even possible advice,
 or even pressure, on the eve of Brezhnev's visit to Yugoslavia."
 Also on the 18th, Radio Zagreb commentator Milika Sundic assailed
 the SED report as "gratuitous and lacking in good intentions,"
 He added that the Soviet camp does not like to see Chinese rela-
 tions with the Balkan countries normalized because "it wants to
 proclaim the Balkan area its own sphere of interest in its
 unspoken desire to meddle in the internal affairs of the
 countries in this area as it sees fit."  Declaring that "no one
 can have special privileges and rights in this area," Sundic
 concluded that "as far as Yugoslavia is concerned, it will
 resist any attempt at direct or indirect interference in its
 internal affairs, no matter where the interference comes from."
 SOVIET MEDIA CONTINUE PROPAGANDA EFFORTS TO DISCREDIT PEKING
 Almost three weeks after the appearnace on it September of the
 latest article under the authoritative signature of I. Aleksandrov
 in PRAVDA, which portrayed the Chinese as outlaws in the interna-
 tional movement and called for intensified eff'.)rts to "expose"
 the Maoists, Radio Moscow is still broadcasting Installments
 of the article to audiences worldwide while developing its basic
 themes in routine-level radio and press comment.  Texts or
 lengthy summaries of the Aleksandrov article appeared promptly

 in the leading party dailies of most of Moscow's orthodox East
 European allies.*  Pro-Soviet communist parties, taking their
 cue from PRAVDA, have published a spate of articles elaborating
 on Aleksandrov's catalogue of charges against the Chinese, and
 Soviet media in turn have reproduced or summarized these
 articles to picture a groundswell of anti-Chinese sentiment
 among communists throughout the world.
 On 18 September, for example, PRA.VDA reprinted an article from
 EL POPULAR, the organ of the Uruguyan Communist Party, playing
 the themes that Peking's invitation to President Nixon is
 basically anti-Soviet in its motivation, is against the best
 interests of the world communist movement, and is particularly
 adverse to the interests of North Vietnam.  PRAVDA used the
 proxy of the Uruguayan party to impugn President Nixon's
 motives for the trip, which Moscow has stopped short of doing
 in its own name.  Thus the EL POPULAR article, as reprinted
 in PRAVDA, commented that although the President is trying to
 make some reople believe U.S. foreign policy has changed; "even
 the most reactionary U.S. press regards Nixon's upcoming trip
 to Peking as a foreign policy act dictated by mercenary motives
 and by anticommunist interests..., and reactionary circles
 throughout the world link these contacts with plans to undermine
 the unity of the anti-imperialist forces."
 Similarly, the 10-16 September issue of ZA RUBEZHOM published
 a four-page roundup of foreign press articles on the PRC's
 uplittist policies.  The largest amount of space was devoted
 to a NEUES DEUTSCHLAND article, "From Leftwing Adventures to
 Complicity with the Imperialists," which developed the theme
 that Peking's "hegemonistic aspirations are causing serious
 harm to the national liberation movement."  ZA RUBEZHOM's
 roundup also included an.article from the Bulgarian army
 organ NARODNA ARMIYA attacking Peking's diplomatic activity
 in Asia and Africa, which the paper maintained is in reality
 aiding the imperialists and "preventing the developing
 states from acquiring true political and economic independence."
 And an article taken from the Colombian Communist Party organ
 VOZ PROLETARIA suggested that the Chinese would be willing to
 sell out the North Vietnamese to achieve "an alliance" with
 the United States.

 PEKING  ON JAPAN
 "MANCHURIAN INCIDENT" RECALLED IN ATTACK ON JAPAN MILITARISM
 Chinese propagandists have seized on the 140th anniversary of the__,
 18 September "Manchurian Incident" as an occasion to inveigh
 against the alleged revival of militarism in Japan.  Highlighting
 Chinese attention to the anniversary is a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial,
 released by NCNA on 18 September, which picks up the theme--common
 in comment on Japan since the Nixon-Sato talks in 1969--that
 Japanese reactionaries are successfully turning Japan into a
 powerful military force commensurate with its economic influence
 in Asia.  NCNA has given wide domestic and international
 dissemination to the editorial as well as other commentaries on
 the anniversary.
 Peking's attention to this anniversary has been slight in
 recent years.  On the last decennial anniversary in 1961,
 however, there was also a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial and related
 propaganda.
 While the editorial fully exploits the theme of a revival of
 militarism in Japan, some soft-pedaling of the terms for
 improving China-Japan relations could be read into the
 editorial's omission of any specific demand that the Japanese
 abrogate the 1952 Japan-Nationalist China treaty.  That
 requirement was spelled out in last July's joint communique
 between the China-Japan Friendship Association and a delegation
 of the Komeito Party, Japan's second largest opposition party.
 In Peking's last authoritative editorial on Japan--a joint
 PEOPLE'S DAILY-LIBERATION ARMY DAILY editorial released on
 3 September 1970 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Japan's
 wartime defeat in China? "military collusion between Japan
 and Chiang Kai-shek" was firmly denounced; no such reference
 appears in the editorial just released.  However, Japan's
 "attempt to lay hands on China's sacred territory Taiwan
 province" by arguing that the "status of Taiwan remains to be
 determined" is firmly condemned.  The "mass movement for
 Japan-China friendship" is portrayed as a "mighty current"
 which "Eisaku Sato and his ilk" will not be able to hold back.
 Seeking to sharpen the desired image of Japan's growing military
 threat to peace in Asia, the editorial focuses on a detailed
 account of the "18 September incident"--the beginning of Japan's

 22 SEPTIIBER .1971
 "blood-smeared history of aggression and war" in China.
 Portraying Japan today as an economic power whose "economic
 strength is seven or eight times that of prewar days," the
 editorial argued that "economic expansion definitely leads
 to military expansion."
 Peking's fear that the Nixon Doctrine will ultimately place
 Japan in the role of protecting U.S. interests in Asia was
 reflected in the editorial's assertion that "U.S. imperialism
 is eager to use Japanese militarism as its stormtrooper in
 launchiiie aggression in Asia."  The editorial also sniped
 at "social-imperialism" for seeking to "enlist Japanese
 militarism in opposing China and undermining the revolutionary
 movement in Asia."  Turning its attention to pro-Peking
 forces within Japan, the editorial drew a distinction between
 the Japanese people and "Japanese militarism" and called upon
 "farsighted people in Japanese economic and political circles"
 to counter the influence of a "handful of pro-U.S. monopoly
 capitalists" and work  for dismantling U.S. military bases
 within Japan as well as abrogation of the U.S.-Japan military
 alliance.
 In an apparent effort to add historical depth to local
 discussions on "Japanese militarism," MCNA on 17 September
 publicized reference material for use in studying the 1931
 incident.  The material includes information on the rarely
 mentioned "Tanaka memorial" of 1927--which revealed Japanese
 plans to use Manchuria as a foothold for expansion in China--
 and details the historic events leading to the Marco Polo
 Bridge incident of 1937 when Japan launched an all-out war
 against China and "barbarously pursued a policy to kill all,
 burn all, and plunder all."

 GERMANY AND BERLIN
 MOSCOW HAILS BRANDT VISIT. PLAYS DOWN INTER-GERMAN DIFFERENCES
 Voluminous Soviet propaganda, replete with praise for West German
 Chancellor Brandt personally, characterizes Brandt's 16-18
 September talks with Brezhnev in the Crimean resort or Oreanda
 as a "substantial" contribution to the strengthening of European
 peace and security.  Underscoring the point that the meetings
 are in keeping with the "peace program" outlined at the 24th
 CPSU Congress, Moscow says the reoults are evoking feelings
 of "deep satisfaction" among all who cherish peace and detente.
 Reflecting the main points of the joint communique issued on
 the 18th, followup Soviet comment, keynoted by a PRAVDA editorial
 or, the 20th, stresses that the two sides noted the importance of
 FRG ratification of the Moscow and Warsaw treaties for the
 development of West German-Soviet relations; that they would
 consult with each other and with their respective allies to
 accelerate the convening of a European security conference;
 that they found "common" positions on the question of reducing
 armed forces and armaments in Europe "without detriment to the
 participating states," and that they would promote the
 normalization of relations between the GDR and the FRG,
 including both states' participation in the United Nations.
 While giving prominent and generally thorough coverage to all
 aspects of the Brandt visit, including the Chancellor's
 comments before his departure from Bonn and his post-visit.
 remarks on his talks with Brezhnev,* the Moscow central
 press has watered down the strong protestations issuing from
 East German leaders at the 16-17 September SED Central
 Committee plenary session, which coincided with the Brandt
 visit, over the difficulties being encountered in the current
 GDR-FRG and GDR-West Berlin Senat talks.
 *  Moscow media have yet to acknowledge that Brezhnev has
 accepted an invitation from Brandt to visit the Federal Republic
 at a date "convenient" to the Soviet leader.

 GDR positions on the Berlin agreement and the inter-German
 talks were underscored in speeches by BED leader Honecker,
 Politburo member Axen--who gave the Politburo report on BED
 activities since the eighth BED congress in June--and Politburo
 member Sindermann, as well as in a Central Committee resolution
 formally stating BED endorsement of the quadripartite agreement
 "on West Berlin."  The Central Committee resolution declares
 that the GDR wants "rapidly to reach positive results in the
 negotiations with the FRG Government and the West Berlin Senat,"
 adding the GDR's "expectation" that Bonn and the Senat "will
 also display the required realism and good will so that the
 corresponding agreements can be concluded in the interests of
 all parties concerned and European detente."  Axen said in his
 report that the Politburo had given "the appropriate directives
 to make possible the conclusion, in negotiations with the FRG
 Government, of a general traffic treaty [vertrag] and an
 agreement [abkommen) on civilian transit traffic of persons
 from the FRG and goods from the FRG to and from West Berlin.
 The negotiations with the West Berlin Senat are aimed at
 obtaining an agreement on questions of normalizing the
 relations as well as alleviating and improving traffic from
 and to West Berlin."  Axen went on to assert that it is the
 GDR's aim to reach "positive results" in the two series of
 negotiations.  The TASS summary of Axen's report omitted
 the details of the East German proposrils to Bonn and the
 Senat, noting only the call for "positive results."
 In contrast to Axen, both Honecker and Sindermann charged the
 West Germans with hindering the progress of the negotiations.
 In a long discr.ssion of GDR-FRG relations and the importance
 of the quadripartite agreement for GDR sovereignty, Honecker
 sought to place the blame for lack of progress in the inter-
 German talks on the Federal Government, alluding to the
 difficulties over an agreed German translation of the Berlin
 accord:  "Anyone seeking to impedes  -h a development [based
 on contractual agreements between the GDR and FRG and the GDR
 and West Berlin Senat] by threat cf blackmail against the
 GDR will have to bear the responsibility for the ensuing
 consequences."  He added that the proposed GDR treaties and
 agreements are based on "realism" and are "on the table and
 could be signed tomorrow."  However, in a more conciliatory
 manner, Honecker said that "despite the difficulties which
 have arisen in the negotiations" the GDR ,iaintains that
 "today, as before, it is still possible to bring the
 negotiations to a rapid successful conclusion, given good
 will on all sides."

 Soviet reports on Honecker's speech included his comments on
 "difficulties"--the first acknowledgment of difficulties in
 the current German phase of the Berlin negotiations to appear
 in the Soviet central press, although direct and indirect
 references to differences between Bonn and East Berlin over
 the "inter-German" talks have appeared in routine Moscow
 radio propaganda.  An initial TASS report citing ADN, and
 following ADN's account very closely, noted both Honecker's
 remarks on the "difficulties" and his "blackmail" charge.
 But dispatches in PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA on the 19th, without
 attribution to ADN, referred only to the difficulties and
 left out the charge against the West Germans.
 COMMENT, REPORTAGE       East Berlin media carried a spate of
 IN EAST BERLIN MEDIA     comment on the eve of the Brandt
 visit to the Crimea denouncing Bonn
 for attempting to conduct "inter-German negotiations" under
 the umbrella of the four-power agreement.  These commentaries
 followed by a day the third sessions of the talks in the
 German phase between the GDR and the FRG and the GDR and the
 West Berlin Senat, which were abruptly broken off after brief
 meetings on the lhth over the German translation problem.
 Seeking to evince support for the GDR stand on the translation,
 ADN and NEUES DEUTSCHLAND have carried reports citing "Western
 diplomats" as saying there is no "official" German translation
 of the agreement and quoting Abrasimov's statement to GDR
 newsmen after the 3 September signing to the effect that only
 the three official languages are "authentic" and that the
 Big Four had "n-thing to do with the German translation of
 the agreement."
 Noting the cancellation by Senat representative Mueller of his
 fourth post-signing meeting with GDR State Secretary Kohrt,
 which was to be held on the 22d, ADN i3aid on the 20th that
 "evidently" the Senat is "not interested in a rapid and
 constructive consideration of the GDB proposals."  Similarly,
 ADN said that GDR State Secretary Kohl "regretted" the
 attitude of FRG State Secretary Bahr expressed at their
 fourth meeting on the 22d--which lasted only 30 minutes;
 ADN noted that Bahr "was still not authorized to enter into
 substantive negotiations on the GDR drafts" presented on
 6 September.

 MIDDLE EAST
 MOSCOW ANTICIPATES UNGA MIDEAST DEBATE, NOTES COUNCIL SESSION
 While TASS on the 20th says it is believed in UN circles that a
 debate on the Middle East is one of the basic tasks o?^ the
 session, Moscow touches on the issue only in general discussions
 of matters before the Assembly, with no suggestion that the
 Soviet Union is contemplating any initiative.  One such broad
 report, by PRAVDA correspondents on the 21st, does take the
 occasion to reiterate Soviet support for a political settlement
 based on the 22 November 1967 Security Council resolution, and
 again reaffirms Moscow's readiness to participate, along with
 other permanent members of the Security Council, in,inter-
 nationa.l guarantees for such a solution.  (This Soviet position
 on guarantees was first stated at the elite level by Brezhnev
 in his 30 March CPSU Congress report.)  Podgornyy, in a
 14 September speech at a dinner honoring the visiting Afghan
 king, restated.the standard Soviet call for Israeli implementa-
 tion of Resolution 242, whose "main demand" is Israeli with-
 drawal from "all" occupied Arab lands.                                   He added that the Arab
 Republic of Egypt (ARE), with the support of the other Arab
 states, had made constructive proposals to this end.
 TASS reports without comment Egyptian President as-Sadat's
 16 September proposal for a Security Council meeting at the
 foreign minister level to provide clarification of attitudes
 on the Middle East problem.  An account of the speech broadcast
 in Arabic noted that as-Sadat said Egypt would try at the UNGA
 session to obtain "decisive measures" for implementation of UN
 resolutions and Israeli withdrawal from the occupied areas.
 TASS on the 20th, noting that U Thant had stressed in his
 annual report that resumption of the Jarring mission was
 hardly advisable before Israel changed its stand on the troop
 withdrawal issue, observed that the General Assembly must
 therefore consider "effective measures to curb the aggressor."
 COUNCIL DEBATE     TASS routinely reports the current Security
 ON JERUSALEM       Council debate on Jordan's complaint against
 Israel's "unlawful actions" in Jerusalem,
 accompanying the accounts with continuing attacks on Israeli
 occupation policies in the administered Arab territories, along
 with occasional comment pointing up economic and social
 problems in Israel itself.  A Koryavin article in IZVESTIYA

 on the 19th points out that in the debate the Jordanian repre-
 sentative asked the Security Council to employ sanctions
 envisaged in the UN Charter to get Israel to respect UN
 decisions, and that the Egyptian representative proposed
 that the Council pass a recommendation on the expulsion of
 Israel from the United Nations.  While Soviet propaganda from
 time to time has referred to the possibility of political and
 economic sanctions, mention of expulsion is rare:  In a single
 known instance, an article in INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS this June,
 by Dmitriyev and Ladeikin, cited Article 6 of the UN Charter
 as stating that a UN member which persistently violates
 Charter principles may be expelled from the organization.
 Moscow has generally avoided addressing itself to the question
 of the ultimate status of Jerusalem, but the Koryavin IZVESTIYA
 article doee: recall UN decisions "establishing the status of
 Jerusalem as a separate entity enjoying a special international
 status."  And a foreign-language commentary by Viktor Kudryavtsev
 on the 21st cites the 29 November 1947 UNGA resolution declaring
 Jerusalem, "which lies in Jordanian territory," a demilitarized,
 neutral city with a "special regime."
 SUEZ CANAL INCIDENTS DRAW BRIEF MENTION, NO SOVIET CONWIENT
 Moscow gives only the barest acknowledgment of the 17-18 September
 incidents along the Suez Canal in terse reports citing an
 Egyptian military spokesman's statements.  On the 17th, TASS
 promptly reported the downing of an Israeli Phantom, apparently
 failing to pick up Cairo's subsequent acknowledgment that the
 downed. aircraft was an army transport plane.  On the 18th, TASS
 again cited an Egyptian military spokesman for the report that
 Israeli planes had fired at Egyptian positions on the canal, and
 quoted APP to the effect that an Israeli army spokesman had
 reported Israeli artillery fire on Egyptian antiaircraft missile
 positions.  There was no mention of the Israeli charge that
 Egyptian missiles were fired at Israeli planes that day.  And
 in a two-sentence report on the 21st, TASS said that according
 to AL-AHRAM, the Israeli military in the last few days had
 stepped up their military preparations on the east bank of the
 canal, and that movements of artillery units as well as activi-
 ties of land and air forces had been observed.

 reported, an Egyptian military spokesman's statement that Israeli
 forces "fired on" an Egyptian military aircraft on the 11th;
 Israel claimed that an Egyptian Sukhoi-7 overflying Israeli-
 held a                      ,ritory on the west side of the canal had been shot down.
 USSR SELECTIVELY REPORTS CAIRO DEVELOPMENTS1 NOT JOINT TALKS
 In keeping with its generally low level of comment on the Middle
 East question, Moscow is silent with respect to Cairo reports of
 Soviet-Egyptian consultations on the problem in the context of a
 "Joint working paper."  With regard to internal developments in
 the Arab Republic of Egypt (ARE), TABS on the 9th noted publica-
 tion of the ARE permanent constitution, adopted by referendum on
 the 11th, and reported formation of the new cabinet on the 19th,
 witho,it mentioning that one of the new ministerial posts--that of
 minister of state for foreign affairs--would have "special
 responsibility" for Arab-Soviet relations.  (Noting-.that Murad
 Ghalib, Cairo's ambassador to Moscow since 1961, was appointed
 to this new post, AL-AHRAM on the 19th pointed to his experience
 in the "intricacies" of Soviet-Egyptian relations, which it
 called a matter of "first priority.")  Nor has Moscow as yet
 made mention of the planned observances in Cairo commemorating
 the first anniversary of Nasir's death, on 28 September.*
 Perhaps suggestive of continued Soviet affront at Arab treatment
 of local "progressives," Podgornyy in his 14 September Kremlin
 dinner speech decried attempts by "reaction and imperialism" to
 disunite the Arab countries, undermine them from within, and
 "strike a blow against the patriotic forces," and declared that
 the Soviet Union "will not be indifferent" with respect to these
 intrigues.  In the sume vein, Mayevskiy in the 19 September
 PRAVDA deplored attempts by imperialism and "internal reaction"
 to split the Arabs' front, attack the patriotic forces, and
 undermine friendly Arab relations with the Soviet Union.  Moscow
 presumably has in mind the continuing Sudanese denunciations of
 communism, but may well also be thinking of the Egyptian trials
 of 'Ali Sabri and other former Nasir associates.
 *  Moscow could scarcely have been pleased by as-Sadat's condolence
 cable, publicized by the MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY on 12 September,
 on the death of Khru3hchev, one of the "greatest leaders" of the
 Soviet Union who would be remembered in Egypt with "pride and
 appreciation."

 AS-SADAT     Reporting as-Sadat's 16 September radio and tele-
 SPEECH                                vision statement to the nation, TABS noted his
 criticism of the United States for insisting that
 U.S.-Egyptian consultations were continuing and that there was
 hope of an early settlement despite the fact that there had
 been no contacts for over two months.  An Arabic-language report
 of the speech additionally mentioned that as-Sadat denied U.S.
 "pr:paganda fabrications" concerning points of agreement between
 Cairo and Washington on a settlement and on Egypt's acceptance
 of a partial solution.  The broadcast did not mention as-Sadat's
 statement that the United States "even said to the Soviet Union"
 that Egypt accepted a partial solution.
 USSR-ARE TALKS,     Cairo radio reported that after making his
 "JOINT PAPER"       statement on the 16th, as-Sadat summoned
 Soviet Ambassador Vinogradov to study the
 situation in light of the "Joint Soviet-Egyptian working paper
 which has been discussed in the past months," and in light of
 the Soviet-Egyptian treaty.*  Cairo has shed no further light
 on the "working paper," and Moscow has made no reference to
 such a document.  The communique on Egyptian Foreign Minister
 Riyad's 15-20 April talks in Moscow did say the sides had agreed
 on unspecified "further joint steps" to normalize the Middle
 East situation.  Such language was not unique to this communique,
 however; similar references to future joint steps had appeared in

 UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
 MOSCOW REVIEWS KEY AGENDA ITEMS. BACKS PRC'S SEATING
 A moderate volume of Moscow comment and reportage on the 21 September
 opening of the 26th session of the United Nations General Assembly
 (UNGA) focuses predictably on the USSR-sponsored agenda items calling
 for debate on implementation of the declaration on strengthening
 international security and for discussion of the question of a world
 disarmament conference.  In its rundown of agenda items, available
 Soviet propaganda has assigned "top priority" to the debates on these
 two initiatives.  A third agenda item suggested by the USSR--
 consideration of the Soviet draft treaty governing man's activities
 on the moon--is mentioned in current propaganda, but has not
 received the attention accorded the other proposals.
 The propaganda has pointed to the importance of other disarmament
 issues on the agenda, including the questions of banning chemical
 and bacteriological weapons and the suspension of all nuclear
 tests.  It notes that a "broad debate" on the Middle East will be
 held.  And as in past years, it underscores the importance of
 fully implementing the declaration on granting independence to
 countries and peoples under colonial rule.
 Soviet propaganda has touched only briefly on the question of
 U Thant's pending resignation from the post of secretary general.
 TASS noted on the 14th that in a press conference that day he
 said his decision was final; and a participant in the 19 September
 commentators' roundtable show in the domestic service, referring
 to the same press conference, said U Thant indicated that he
 would not remain in office "even for a limited period" after the
 end of his current term, which expires on 31 December.  Moscow
 has not speculated on a possible successor to U Thant beyond
 noting the Secretary General's own views on the necessary
 qualifications:  Reporting U Thant's remarks at a luncheon on the
 17th, TASS said he indicated that a secretary general must have
 "an independent opinion and never become an agent of some one
 country or group of countries" and that he must display
 impartiality regardless of his nationality.
 CHINESE     Moscow continues to voice pro forma support for the
 SEATING     restoration to the PRC of its "legitimate rights" in
 the United Nations and to call for the expulsion of
 the Chiang Kai-shek delegation, stressing the consistency of the

 USSR's position on these questions over the years. A commentary
 in Mandarin beamed to Southeast Asian listeners on the 21st, for
 example, asserted that the USSR's policy "has never wavered . . .
 despite the anti-Soviet and othe  antisocialist splittist
 activities conducted by the current Peking leaders."  Like other
 Soviet comment, the broadcast went on to criticize "Washington's
 maneuverings" aimed at a "two-Chinas" solution.  In the words
 of a participant in the 19 September commentators' roundtable,
 Washington is pushing for the passage of resolutions whose main
 aims are to keep "the Chiang Kai-shek mission in the United
 Nations while simultaneously making definite curtseys in the
 direction of Peking."
 An international review article by PRAVDA's authoritative
 commentator Mayevskiy on the 19th is atypical in suggesting that
 the Chinese representation issue is less than crucial.  After
 noting that the American press has vigorously played up U.S.
 efforts to keep Chiang in the United Nations while at the same
 time making goodwill gestures toward Peking, Mayevskiy says
 "some observers" have assumed that "the fuss surrounding the
 'problem of Taiwan's representation' is an attempt to distract
 the Assembly's attention from truly important problems, and
 above all from the problem of disarmament."
 Peking has remained adamant in its opposition to the concept
 of dual representation in the United Nations.  In the month
 since the release of the 20 August PRC Foreign Ministry statement,
 which declared categorically that Peking "will absolutely have
 nothing to do with the United Nations" unless the Taiwan
 delegation is expelled, Chinese propaganda has publicized
 foreign support for the restoration of the PRC's "lawful rights"
 in the world body and for expulsion of the ROC delegates.

 USSR -  AFGHANISTAN
 COMMUNIQUE ON KINGS VISIT ktFLECTS CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
 The joint communique issued at the end of the 14-19 September
 visit to the Soviet Union of Afghanistan's King Mohammed Zahir
 Shah reflected the highly satisfactory state of Afghan-Soviet
 relations, proclaimed Soviet intent to assist Afghanistan in
 its fourth five-year development plan, and registered "a
 coincidence or closeness of positions" between the two countries
 "on the major problems of the present-day international
 situation."  On East Pakistan, the two sides "exchanged views,"
 and their jointly expressed "hope" in regard to conditions for
 the refugees' return was stated in terms considerably milder
 than the previously outlined Soviet position.  During his stay
 in Moscow the king and his entourage engaged in a series of
 talks with several top Soviet political and economic leaders,
 including Podgornyy, Mazurov, Gromyko, Skachkov, and Kuzmin,
 and met with Brezhnev on the 15th.  The king's invitations to
 Brezhnev, Podgornyy, and Kosygin to pay return visits to
 Afghanistan "at a time convenient for them" were "accepted
 with gratitude."  Following a two-day visit to Irkutsk, the
 king continued on to Ulan Bator on the 20th for an official
 visit to Mongolia.
 BILATERAL     Soviet publicity for the visit, speeches by
 RELATIONS     Podgornyy and the Afghan king, and the joint
 communique portrayed Soviet-Afghan relations
 as a model of long-standing friendship, good-neighborly
 cooperation, and peaceful coexistence.  On the day of the
 king's arrival PRAVDA described him as an "outstanding
 statesman" who was making a "great contribution to
 strengthening the relations of friendship and good-neighbor-
 liness between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union."  Speaking
 as the host at a dinner on the 14th, Podgornyy said that
 Afghanistan and the Soviet Union were linked by "bonds of
 friendship, good-neighborliness, and multifaceted mutually
 advantageous cooperation," and he observed that meetings
 and exchange of opinions between leaders of the two countries
 had become "traditional"--a "testimony" to the "high level of
 development" of bilateral relations.  Citing the bilateral
 treaties of 1921 and 1931, the king in his speech declared
 that Afghan-Soviet relations were a striking example of fruit-
 ful peaceful coexistence in the field of international ties,
 especially between countries which have different political
 and social systems."

 In a similar vein, the communique expressed "deep satisfaction"
 with the state of bilateral relations and "great satisfaction"
 at the marking earlier this year of the 50th anniversary of
 the 1921 treaty of friendship and of the 140th anniversary of
 the 1931 treaty of neutrality and nonaggression.  Noting both
 sides' desire to strengthen further Soviet-Afghan  friendship
 and "reciprocally advantageous cooperation," the communique
 recorded that discussions had taken place on further expanding
 trade relations and economic and technical cooperation, that
 subsequent talks in Kabul would focus on means of Soviet
 assistance to the 1972-1977 fourth five-year development plan
 of Afghanistan, and that negotiations later this year would be
 aimed at concluding a new long-term trade agreement.
 INTERNATIONAL    Afghanistan's foreign policy received similar
 AFFAIRS          accolades.  Noting that the "mutual under-
 standing and trust which have so characterized
 Soviet-Afghan relations for decades past" are spreading to
 cooperation in the international sphere, Podgornyy said the
 Soviet people "regard with approval" Afghanistan's policy of
 "positive and active neutrality" and its support of peoples'
 struggles against colonialism.  Claiming a "coincidence or
 proximity of positions" between the Soviet Union and
 Afghanistan on major international problems, Podgornyy
 expounded in routine terms on Indochina, the East Pakistan
 situation, the Middle East, European security, and problems
 of disarmament and arms control.  In-his return-.speech the
 Afghan king touched on all these issues with the exception
 of the East Pakistan situation.
 The communique treated in similar terms a number of inter-
 national issues on which it was claimed that there was a
 "coincidence or closeness" of positions.  The Soviet side
 "highly assessed" Afghanistan's policy of nonalignment; both
 sides declared their "full support" for the declaration on
 strengthening international security adopted by the UNGA on
 16 December 1970; arms control and disarmament measures were
 supported, as was the convocation "in the nearest future"
 of an all-European security conference.  Calling for the
 withdrawal of all foreign troops from Indochina and a
 political settlement on the basis of the Geneva accords,
 the communique registered the contention that "there exist at
 present real prerequisites" for an Indochina settlement.
 Podgornyy on the 14th had asserted that the PRG's seven-point
 proposal and the proposals of "the patriotic forces" of Laos
 and Cambodia had created "real preconditions" for a "Just

 settlement in Southeast Asia."  The "continuing dangerous
 situation in the Middle East," said the communique, "results
 from Israel's aggressive policy"; a "Just and lasting peace"
 there can be established on the basis of the withdrawal of
 Israeli troops from all the Arab territories occupied in
 1967 and the full implementation of the 22 November 1967
 Security Council resolution.  Racism, colonialism, and
 neo-colonialism were also condemned by the communique.
 CRISIS IN          On the subject of the East Pakistan crisis,
 EAST PAKISTAN      the communique revealed a degree of
 disagreement and its wording reflected a
 compromise.  Using carefully selected straightforward terms,
 the communique noted that the sides "exchanged views" on the
 "serious situation in the Asian subcontinent" resulting from
 "the events in East Pakistan" and which has led to the flow
 of millions of refugees from Pakistan to India.  The communique
 registered the hope that "conditions will soon be created in
 East Pakistan to enable the Pakistani refugees to return to
 their country in full confidence of their safety."
 Such phraseology is significantly milder than the Soviet
 position, which Podgornyy in essence reiterated in his speech
 on the 14th.  Referring to the "well-known events" in East
 Pakistan and the resulting increase in Indian-Pakistani
 tensions, Podgornyy contended that "there are forces"--
 unnamed--"which are not above utilizing the tense situation
 that has been created to implement their own unseemly aims
 and to kindle armed clashes in the region."  He went on to
 reiterate the Soviet line calling for "the speediest possible
 achievement of a political settlement" in East Pakistan "taking
 account of the legitimate interests of its population," for
 "the creation of secure conditions there for the return of
 the refugees," and for Indian and Pakistani leaders "to
 prevent the occurrence of a slide toward military conflict."
 In this context Podgornyy recalled the recently concluded
 Soviet-Indian treaty on peace, friendship, and cooperation--
 "which is not aimed against any state."
 The Soviet position favoring a "political solution" involving
 "the legitimate interests of the population"--a clear allusion
 to the overwhelming electoral victory in East Pakistan of Sheik
 Mujibur Rahman's now illegal Awami League--is not reflected in
 the communique; and the "creation of secure conditions" for the
 return of the refugees is watered down to the creation of
 conditions enabling the refugees to return "in full confidence
 of their safety."  In his return speech the Afghan king did not
 mention the East Pakistan situation.

 PRC  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 PEKING SILENT ON REPORT THAT NATIONAL DAY PARADE CANCELED
 There has been no reflection in PRC media of Western news reports
 that the traditional National Day parade in Peking will not take
 place this year and that airplane flights in China were halted for
 several days last week.  PRC broadcast patterns reflect no anomalies,
 either on the part of Peking or provincial radios.  All provincial
 radios except Inner Mongolia, which ceased broadcasting local
 political materials in January 1970, continue to carry their usual
 local programs.  The media reflected relatively few public
 appearances by top PRC leaders between 12 and 17 September,
 indicating the possibility of a leadership conference; it has
 been a year since the last party plenum, and plenums are
 traditionally held before NPC meetings.
 The content of Peking broadcasts has been fairly standard for
 this time of year.  There have been numerous economic claims in
 anticipation of National Day, and the anniversary of Mao's
 15 September 1965 instruction on broadcasting has received the
 usual voluminous coverage, perhaps even a little more than
 usual.  Several articles on economics, continuing to criticize
 ultraleft notions, do not indicate any change in the relatively
 moderate policies of recent years.
 Peking's buildup for National Day festivities has varied from
 year to year, although a parade has always been held.  In 1970
 the media did not announce beforehand that any provincial
 leaders had journeyed to Peking for the celebration, and did
 not note specifically that foreign groups in Peking were to
 attend National Day functions until a report on 28 September
 Stated that an Overseas Chinese group was an route to attend.
 WIRED BROADCASTING NET REPORTEDLY FAR ADVANCED IN CHINA
 On 15 September, the sixth anniversary of Mao's inscription on
 radio broadcasting, NCNA reported that the wired broadcasting
 network is "vigorously developing" in China's countryside.
 "Almost all" counties and municipalities in China now have
 their own radio stations, and wired broadcasting has been
 installed "in more than 96 percent of the nation's production
 brigades and more than 87 percent of the production teams."

 Comparable figures on a national scale for recent years are
 not available.  NCNA did report in August 1963 that 80 percent
 of China's counties had at that time set up their own radio
 stations.  Previous figures available for selected provinces
 indicate that more populous provinces in the east had already
 achieved the 90 percent level at this time last year.  Shantung
 reported wired broadcasting facilities for 97 percent of its
 production teams at the end of last year; in April 1969 on1.y
 60 percent of its teams had possessed such facilities.  Kiangai
 reported wired broadcasting for 98 percent of its production
 brigades and 90 percent of its production teams in September
 1970; in September 1969 the comparable figures were 90 percent
 and 60 percent.  By September 1970 Liaoning had installed wired
 broadcasting for 90 percent of its production teams.  On the
 other hand, Kansu had installed such facilities for only 53
 percent of its teams by September 1970.

 SUPPLEMENTARY ARTICLE
 PRC SUSTAINS DIFFERENTIATED LINE ON SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES
 Moves in August portending improved Chinese relations with Burma
 and Malaysia at the state level have produced no essential
 changes in Peking's dual-level propaganda tactics toward these
 countries, marked by restraint in PRC official media while the
 national administrations are subjected to continuing abuse in
 broadcasts of the Chinese-sponsored clandestine radios.
 While on one level Peking received Burmese Prime Minister Ne Win
 on a well-publicized visit from 6 to 12 August and sent a
 Chinese trade delegation to Malaysia from 22 to 28 August,'
 the Chinese-sponsored clandestine radios backing the insurgent
 movements in those countric3--the Voice of the People of Burma
 (VPB) and Voice of the Malayan Revolution (VOMR)--were pulling
 in an opposite direction by impugning the motives of the two
 Southeast Asian regimes in their dealings with the Chinese.
 VPB broadcasts on 5 and 8 August, just before and during Ne
 Win's sojourn in Peking, suggested that the "Ne Win military
 clique" was seeking improved relations with the PRC in order to
 shore up its tenuous position at home and that the visit did
 not signify any ideological metamorphosis on Ne Win's part.
 The VOMR suggested that "Razak and his ilk" were acting out of
 similar motives of expediency in receiving the Chinese trade
 delegation.
 Peking media have carried no followup propaganda on Ne Win's
 visit or, for that matter, on any aspect of Burmese affairs
 since the visit.  PRC official media do not carry VPB material..
 Peking does air material originating with the Voice of the
 Malayan Revolution, but almost invariably over the past year
 has sanitized it to exclude direct attacks on the Malaysian
 Government.  T%us in the period since the PRC trade delegation
 returned home, NCNA on 4 and 5 September carried excerpts of

 VOMR comment describing the "Malayan people's revolutionary
 struggle," with derogatory references to the Malaysian leader-
 ship edited out.
 The most recent of Peking's periodic roundups of revolutionary
 armed struggles in Southeast Asia--a 19 May NCNA correspondent's
 report issued in connection with the first anniversary of Mao's
 20 May 1970 statement on the inevitability of world revolution--
 provided a standard list of countries in the area where armed
 struggles endorsed by Peking are taking place:  Burma, Thailand,
 "Malaya," the Philippines, Indonesia, and "North Kalimantan"
 (East Malaysia).  Peking has since sustained a differentiated
 approach to these noncommunist Southeast Asian countries, ranging
 from hardline propaganda on Thailand through gradations of
 moderation on Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines to the
 most restrained line on Burma.  Peking also follows a two-pronged
 approach toward the individual countries, making use of three
 clandestine radios--the Voice of the People of Thailand, the
 Voice of the. Mr.layan Revolution, and the Voice of the People of
 Burma--to support the insurgent movements while observing diplo-
 matic constraints in its own official media.
 The official PRC media provide a channel for both original
 comment on the Southeast Asian countries and further dissemination
 of material taken from the clandestine stations, the media of
 other communist countries, and some noncommunist sources.  Publi-
 city for resident leaders of the Burmese Communist Party (BCP)
 and the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) oc''.ers another means for
 Peking to show support for communist insr,.gencies.
 THAILAND     As a U.S. ally repeatedly censured for its role in
 the Indochina conflict, Thailand is the target of
 Peking's most abusive and extensive propaganda attacks.  The
 communist-led Thai insurgents get propaganda support from both
 the official PRC media and the clandestine Voice of the People
 of Thailand.  The communist insurgency received considerable
 attention in early August in comment marking the sixth anniver-
 sary of the launching of armed struggle against the "Thanom
 clique" and the United States.  A connection between the insur-
 gent movement and the Indochina conflict is frequently pointed
 up in references to support provided the communist cause in
 Indochina by the armed actions of the insurgents in Thailand.

 22 SEPTEMBER 1971
 Peking media have not acknowledged recent calls by Thal govern-
 ment and business spo'.cesmen for cautious steps toward normali-
 zation of relations with the PRC.  However, a 13 September NCNA
 summary of a commentary by the clandestine radio denouncing
 Thai support for a "two-Chinas" position in the United Nations
 was notable for a call for normalizing Sino-Thai relations.
 The commentary demanded that "the Thanom-Praphat clique" cease
 its "hostile" policy toward the PRC, "abolish the fasclnt law
 that bans trade with China," and "restore normal relat  ,ns"
 with the PRC.  'These themes were developed at length in a
 7 September broadcast by the clandestine radio claiming that
 there is strong popular sentiment for friendly relations
 with the PRC.  The broadcast said that even some parliamen-
 tarians have called for repeal of the law prohibiting trade
 with the PRC and that the chairman of the Thai Chamber of
 Commerce spoke of the benefits from such trade.  NCNA did
 not mention this broadcast.
 PHILIPPINES    In the absence of a clandestine radio, Peking's
 infrequent reports on the Philippine insurgency
 provide little propaganda support for the communist-led Philippine
 New People's Army.  NCNA reports on 28 August and 4 September--
 attributed to Philippine communist and other sources--telling of
 a successful action by the New People's Army against "the
 reactionary troops" was the first monitored Peking coverage of
 the Philippine insurgents since 28 June.  Peking has abstained
 from commenting on the insurgency in its own name and has care-
 fully avoided direct attacks on the Marcos government in carrying
 material attributed to other sources.
 Extending recognition to the Peking-oriented wing of the
 Philippine communists, NCNA on 10 July carried a message on
 the CCP's 50th anniversary from "Comrade Amado Guerro, chairman
 of the Communist Party of the Philippines."  Replete with
 accolades to "Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought" and condemna-
 tions of deviationist lines, the message referred briefly to the
 Philippine communist struggle but refrained from attacking the
 Marcos government by name.
 Publicity for the Philippine communists was provided by the
 Voice of the Malayan Revolution on 15 September when it belatedly
 carried a 23 June statement by the Philippine CP Central Committee
 alleging a massacre of Moslems.  The statement denounced "the
 Marcos fascist clique" and called for the minorities to join
 with the New People's Army in applying Mao's people's war precepts
 and to practice guerrilla warfare.

 INDONESIA     Peking has offered little propaganda support for
 the PKI in recent months.  Infrequent PRC comment
 on Indonesian Xfaira in general has censured the government
 for its relations with the United States and Japan.  One such
 commentary on 27 April denounced the "Suharto fascist military
 clique," but the last monitored commentary on this subject--on
 9 May--softened the characterization to "the Indonesian Suharto
 military regime,"
 Peking's only propaganda support for the Indonesian coiimunists
 has consisted of publicity for two PKI documents signed by
 Jusuf Adjitorop, head of the PKI's resident delegation in
 Peking.  A 2 July message to the CCP on its 50th anniversary
 and a 4 July statement on the previous day's elections in
 Indonesia, both carried by NCNA, proclaimed the importance
 of communist-led armed insurgency in Indonesia and attacked
 the "Suharto fascist military regime."  NCNA did not mention
 Adjitorop's presence at the 31 July PLA anniversary reception,
 an event at which he was reported to be a guest of honor the
 previous year.
 MALAYSIA      The two levels of Peking's propaganda approach
 are most sharply defined in its treatment of
 Malaysia.  On the one hand, it has publicized the exchange
 of trade delegations, in the process acknowledging the legiti-
 macy of the federation by using its official name of Malaysia.
 On the other hand, PRC media continue to disseminate material
 from the Voice of the Malayan Revolution detailing the activities
 of the armed insurgents in both East and West Malaysia, while
 carefully excluding the clandestine radio's direct attacks on
 the Malaysian leaders.
 The Voice of the Malayan Revolution has served as a forum for
 pro-Peking communist parties throughout Southeast Asia, including
 both those without their own clandestine radios--as illustrated
 by the VOMR's broadcast of the 23 June statement by the Philippine
 CP--and those having clandestine stations of their own.  This
 clearinghouse role was acknowledged by the Voice of the People
 of Burma on 16 September in noting that both the VOMR and the
 Voice of the People of Thailand broadcast material originating
 with the Burmese clandestine radio.
 BURMA          Peking has never acknowledged the existence of
 the Voice of the People of Burma, which continues
 to air regular attacks on the Ne Win regime.  The most recent
 reference to the Burmese insurgent movement in PRC media was
 contained in the BCP's message on the CCP's 50th anniversary,

 carried by NCNA on 3 July.  The message called for victory
 over "the Ne Win regime."  There has been no comment in
 Peking's own name on the armed insurgency in Burma since
 September 1970.
 The last Chinese reference to the BCP's resident delegation
 in Peking was contained in NCNA's report on the PLA anniver-
 sary reception on 31 July.                           NCNA reported on 31 July--the
 same day it carried the announcement of Ne Win's impending
 visit--that Ba Thein Tin, vice chairman of the BCP Central
 Committee, had been among the "distinguished guests on the
 seats of honor" at the reception.  Pe Tint, another member
 of the BCP delegation, was also reported present.
