 I.  THREATENING STATEMENTS
 A.  ON RETALIATION
 Khrushchev has invariably accompanied his charges of
 Western "agZressave plans" with warnings of Soviet or
 bloc retaliation.  In many cases he has warned simply
 that the USSR would give "due rebuff" to any Western
 aggression..  But on some occasions he has specified that
 the USSR would destroy the bases from which aggression was
 launched or that the USSR "can hit any point on the
 globe."
 Soviet capability to deal retaliatory blows directly
 against the United States was emphasized by Khrushchev
 particularly in the period following the USSR's August
 1957 ICBM test and the subsequent sputnik launchings.
 Some of Khrushchev's explicit saber-rattling statements
 are reproducett in this section, followed by a selection
 of his moreene:al zed threats.

 1. Atypically Harsh Statements
 At present only wild people can dream about revenge.    at would
 happen, for instance, if West Germany with the support of its allies
 would start war against us?  It would surely be defeated in a brief
 time in the same manner the whole grouping of enemy forces would be
 defeated.  On what are such suppositions. based?  You probably have
 an idea how many nuclear bombs with a capacity of 3 to 5 million
 tons would have to be exploded over the territory of West Germany
 in order to put it out of action.
 (Editor G. Braune:   Eight Hydrogen Bombs.)
 Obviously not more,  And what do you think, do we have eight
 hydrogen bombs?
 (G. Braune:  Surely, even more.)
 And how many are needed for putting out of action other West
 European countries?  Obviously not more.
 You may say: But, would the Soviet Union suffer no losses in the
 event of war?  Yes, it would have losses, and great ones.  But,
 while we would suffer losses, the Western powers would be literally
 wiped off the face of the earth.  And the first to suffer in this
 connection would be the countries in which the Americans are locat-
 ing their rocket bases. (interview with SPD editors, 5 May 1959)
 Some exceedingly boastful American generals and admirals say that
 the United States, if it started a war now, would destroy the USSR
 in several days.  Obviously they are weak in mathematics.  Otherwise
 they might ask themselves the question:  and how long would it take
 to destroy the United States if it unleashed a war?  For war is not
 a one-sided operat.o ; it can turn badly against the side which
 begins it.  It is common knowledge that the other side has no fewer
 forces and possibilivies than those represented by Taylor and
 Burke.  (in Moscow, 19 March 1959)
 If a war is unleashed now by the aggressive circles of the United
 States, it will be waged not only in Europe, in Asia, or Africa.
 This war will immediately be carried on to the territory of the
 United States because intercontinental ballistic missiles now

 make it possible to hit a target in any area of the globe.
 this case, the American people will suffer enormous losses.
 A3
 All means-intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine missiles,
 and other means which now exist--will be used in case of an
 armed conflict.  You yourself understand that is the logic of
 war, the logic of struggle. (in an interview with Hearst,
 22 November 1957)
 If war is not averted, the Americans will experience the most
 devastating war ever known by mankind.  It will rage not only in
 Europe and Asia but, with no lesser fury in the United States.
 ... it should be borne in mind that modern military techniques
 make it possible to keep all of America's vital centers under
 fire from submarines and with the help of ballistic missiles,
 and to blockade the U.S. coast.  This means that the United
 States is now just as vulnerable as any other country. (in an
 interview with Shapiro, 14 November 1957)
 You insist on this flying business and looking at our factories.
 You know those rockets made the situation more frightful.  Now
 we can destroy countries in a few minutes.  How many bombs does
 it take to destroy V'est Germany?  How many for France?  How
 many for England?  Just a few.  We have now H-bombs and rockets.
 We do not even have to send any bombers.   (in an interview with
 Mrs. Roosevelt, 29 September 1957, not released by Moscow)
 2.  Examples of Routine Statements
 I also told CM-r. Nixo7 that if the West German militarists start
 a war, we could with our retaliatory actions in several hours
 wipe from the face of the'earth West Germany and other countries
 with military bases directed against the Soviet Union and Warsaw
 Treaty countries.  (in Dnepropetrovsk, 28 July 1959)
 When the imperialists dare attack you or us or any other country
 of the socialist camp, we will be able to deal them a smashing,
 annihilating repulse.  (in "Tirana, 30 Way 1959)
 Everyone   knows that the Soviet Union threatens nobody, and no
 one with common sense ai1i start war against our country, for
 this threatens them witn a crushing defeat.  (in Kishinev, 14 May
 1959)
 We are not among the fainthearted, and we are ready togive the due
 rebuff to any attempt to use force against us or our friends. (in
 Berliaa, 9 March 1959)

 We do not want war and we will do everything to prevent it. But
 if the Western powers were to start war, its outcome, g l,'en the
 modern military techniques, would be fatal to them.  Ater all,
 when they say that they have military bases close to our frontiers,
 it is to be understood that these bases are not located on the
 moon, but in densely populated areas.  And if these bases are
 close to us, this means that we are close to them.   (in Leipzig,
 4 March 1959)
 We do not want to go to war, and we have no intention of crossing
 the frontiers of other states.  We do not need anyone else's land
 or wealth.  Vie have vast lands and inexhaustible riches of our
 own.  Yet should our frontiers or those of our allies be violated,
 we cannot remain inactive.  'Mtoever tries to violate these frontiers
 and to implement his predatory aims by the force of arms will be
 given a crushing rebuff.  (in Tula, 17 February 1959)
 In point of fact, the Soy let Union today has the means to deliver
 a crushing blow to the aggressor at any point on the globe.  (in
 Moscow, 5 February 1959)

 ON SOVIET
 AND BLOC X1'1;EN~TH
 IU3rushohev compares Soviet or bloc strength with that of the West in
 the following selection of public statements made during the past two
 years.
 Although most of the statements cited deal with military power, it should
 be noted that explicit characterizations of over-all Soviet strength in
 terms of military might are the exception rather than the rule, both
 for Rhrushchev and for Soviet propaganda as a whole.  Soviet propa-
 ganda, unlike that of Communist China, never portrays the United States
 as militarily weak.  The vast majority of Soviet statements about the
 USSR's or the bloc's prowess are couched in general terms--references
 to the bloc as "strong" or "mighty" or to the socialist system as superior.
 The atypically explicit statements quoted here include Xhruahchev's
 unprecedented claim--in his 20 July 1959 speech in Rzeszow, Poland--that
 Soviet bombers are superior to those of the United States.  This claim
 was reported by the Polish Press Agency but was not mentioned in PRAVDA's
 account of the speech.  In prior speeches IQurushchev had denigrated the
 role of bomber aircraft in a war but had not explicitly disparaged U.S.
 as compared with Soviet bombers.
 Also reproduced here are a few of the statements in which IO rushchev
 discussed all-around bloc strength and the "balance of forces."  The
 term "balance of forces," as used in Soviet propaganda, has only once
 been clearly defined:  In his interview with a Danish paper (page D3 of
 this compilation), Khrushchev explained that political, economic, and
 military factors were all involved.

 ON SOVIT AND BLOC STRENGTH
 It should be borne in mind that if the West Germans use all the
 economic potential and manpower resources of their country for
 creating the most powerful army in West Europe, even the strength
 of that army would not be equal to the power of our army and those
 of our allies.  Even with its allies  the Federal R,-Public would
 not be able to equal our strength and power.  (in a letter to
 Adenauer, 19 August 1959)
 The Americans boast that they have long-range heavy bombers.  The
 role of bombers is no longer so great as formerly. We build
 bombers just to keep in practice.  Americans boast about the record
 range and ceiling of their bombers, but these records belong to
 the Soviet Air Force--a fact recently reported in the press.  The
 capitalist world maintains that it will catch up with us in the
 field of technology, but it seems that nobody doubts that we will
 not stand still and passively watch their endeavors.  (in Rzeszow,
 Poland, 20 July 1959, as reported by the Polish News Agency)
 If the imperiali-ts attempt to attack us, we are capable of
 inflicting such a blow on them that they will be unable to recover.
 ...The imperialists know our might.  To attack us is tantamount to
 suicide; one would be insane to do so.  I do not believe they are
 as stupid as all that; I believe they are aware of the consequences
 which the unleashing of a war against the socialist countries may
 have for them.  (in Vlore, 31 May 1959)
 We, too, can do some scaring--the more so since we have what is
 needed to scare them with.  Indeed, they are threatening us because
 they are afraid of our successes.  The Soviet Union's successes
 in peaceful development, the impetuous growth of our peaceful
 economy--that is what the smiler al sts now fear in particular.  They
 are in no position to stop our forward movement.  They understand
 that it is not wise to go to war with us.  Vichy?  It is because war
 promises them nothing good.  The imperialists can, of course, inflict
 no little destruction on our country.  But our country is big; it
 is difficult to defeat it in war.  If the i  erialists unleash war
 they will be threatened with inevitable catastrophe.  (in Kiev,
 11 May 1959)
 It is time to understand twat the days when the imperialists could
 act with impunity from the -position of strength are gone beyond recall.
 Whatever the military may trry, they are unable to change the cor-
 relation of forces to their advantage   They cannot forget the
 geographical situation of hest Germany which, with the present military
 techniques, would not last a day in a modern war.   (in Moscow,
 10 November 1958)

 Those who now want to come out again under the shabby flag of the
 fight against communism should not forget the` fiasco experienced
 by all kinds of anticommunist "axes" and "triangles" in the recent
 past.  It would also be profitable for them to keep it in mind that
 the balance of2ower in the international arena has radically changed
 compared with the years before the Second lorld War, in favor of the
 forces of peace and progress.  It is understandable that in these
 conditions any government which allows itself to be carried away
 with hatred for the peoples which are building a new society would
 embark on an extremely dangerous road at the and of which it
 would be awaited by an inevitable catastrophe and no axes or blocs
 could be of any help..  (in an interview with DIE ZEIT) 23 September
 1958)
 The launching of the Soviet sputniks first of all shows the out-
 standing successes scored by the Soviet Union in the development
 of science and technology ar?d also that the USSR has outstripped the
 leading capitalist country, the United States, in the field of
 scientific and technical progress.  The launching of the sputniks
 also shows without doubt that a serious chime has occurred in the
 balance of forces between the countries of socialism and capitalism
 in favor of the socialist nations.  Balance of forces is a broad
 conception which includes political, economic, and military factors.

 2.  ONT E 3TRUCTION OF CAPITALISM
 This section reproduces a selection of statements since the
 20th CPSU Congress (February 1956) in which lirushchev has forecast
 the "destruction of capitalism" in the event of global war.
 Vhile Khrushchev continues to reiterate this orthodox communist
 thesis on the ultimate consequences of world war, he has at the
 same time become increasingly frank about the mutual destruction
 that would result from a thermonuclear war.  In UDscow on 14 November
 1958 he declared t:~st with the push of one button "whole cities
 will be blown sky-high, whole cities can be destroyed."  In a
 letter to a Japanese anti-nuclear-weapons group on 14 April 1958 he
 spoke of the importance of preventing "a rocket and nuclear war which
 would spell ruin for all mankind."  And in Moscow on 14 March 1958
 he declared that use of nuclear weapons would "poison the atmosphere
 with radioactive fallout, and this may lead to the destruction of
 nearly all living organisms."

 ON THE DESTRUCTION OF CAPITALISM
 As a result of a third world war, should one ever be launched by
 the imperialists, capitalism will be eliminated.  We are con-
 vinced of this.                         We hope that the imperialists also understand
 this and will not play with fire.  (in Dnepropetrovsk, 28 July 1959)
 The imperialists would like to make short shrift of the socialist
 camp, to wipe the socialist countries off the face of the earth,
 but they are powerless to do so.  They realize that a war can be
 started--one need not be too clever for that--but how will it end?
 We are convinced that should the imperialists touch off such a war
 it will end in the destruction of capitalism.  (in Leipzig,
 7 March 1959)
 The situation is now such that the imperialists will hardly dare
 to unleash a war against the countries of the socialist camp.
 Everyone who is capable of thinking and considering soundly, cannot
 fail to see that she USSR and countries of the socialist camp are
 now at such a high level of development that an attempt to unleash
 a new war against these countries will end in the collapse of the
 capitalist systei.   (in Krasnodar, 16 October 1958
 The aggressive blo3 of the Western powers has up to now refused to
 take any earnest steps to save peace, but on the contrary is ag-
 gravating international tension unscrupulously, thus bringing man-
 kind to the brink of a war catastrophe.  They should know, however,
 that if the imperialist war maniacs should dare to impose war on
 the people of the world, all. the countries and people who love peace
 and freedom will unite closely to wipe out clean the i  erialist a -
 ressors and so establish everlasting world peace.  (in the com-
 munique signed with Mao Tse-tung, 3 August 1958)
 We need not be scientists or military experts to understand that a
 future war, if it were unleashed by criminal forces, would cause
 immeasurable harm to all mankind....  It is our firm conviction
 that in the event of an armed conflict, the socialist system would
 be victorious and the capitalist s stem would be unable to weather
 the-grave--ordeals.   in Budapest, 3 April 195
 The process of historic development is inexorable.  It cannot be
 stopped by any reactionary forces.  Should they trX - to .do s__ o by
 force of arms and unleash ua:r. they will dig their graves with
 their own hands.  The peoples will no longer tolerate a system
 which gives birth to wars and brings to mankind torment and
 suffering.   (in Moscow, 21 December 1957)

 This does not mean that war cannot flare up.  As I have said, one
 cannot vouch for a madman.  But the actual correlation of forces
 is such that the militarists and monopolists would do well to
 pause and think--and think hard--before starting a war.  It is our
 conviction that if a war is started--and only i_tperialist countries
 can do it because no socialist state is interested in war--capitalism
 will be routed.  And it will be the last suffering that the capitalist
 world will have inflicted on mankind, for capitalism will be done
 with once and for all. (in 11ioscow, 14 November 1957)
 With the contemporary development of military technique, an attempt
 of the imperialists to unleash a world war would lead to incon-
 ceivably great destruction and losses.  The use of atomic and
 hydrogen weapons, of ballistic rockets,would result in enormous
 calamity for all mankind.  In provoki this calamity the capitalist
 regime will doom itself to an inevitable end.  The peoples will no
 longer countenance a system which brings torment and suffering to
 mankind and unleashes bloody aggressive wars.
 Although we are convinced that as a result of a new war, should it
 be unleashed by capitalist circles, the system which creates wars
 the capitalist system, would perish and the socialist system would
 win, we Communists do not aspire for victory in this way; we Com-
 munists have never striven and will never strive to achieve our
 aims by such terrible means.  (in Moscow, 6 November 1957)
 Some reproach me for allegedly changing my point of view, since
 I once said that if an atomic war came about it would be capitalism
 that would perish in that war.  This I repeat today,  But we think
 that capitalism should be destroyed not by means of war and military
 conflicts but through an ideological and economic struggle....
 5Cutl.er, referring to Khrushchev's remark that a future war would
 destroy capitalism, asked him whether he thought a future war would
 destroy Communism as Yvelij No it would not.  It would bring man-
 kind great calamities, great; losses in men, destruction of wealth,
 but mankind would not perish after all.  And since mankind would
 continue to exist, the Ideas of Marxism-Leninism are immortal.  That
 is why mankind would be rid of capitalism,  But war is such a price
 that we should not resort to it.  It would be harmful to the socialist
 countries as well as to the capitalist countries.  (in Moscow,
 28 May 1957)

 II.  COLORFUL S"TATFaVIWS
 ON THE BLOC_ VERSUS THE WEST
 Now the United States and several other Western countries refuse
 to recognize the CPR, a great country with a population of over
 650 million.  But this does not alter the fact that the CPR exists
 and is gathering great strength.  Speaking figuratively, if all
 the people of People's China wereo sneeze there would be a
 storm in some countries not recognizing the CPR at present.
 Speech to the Moldavian Supreme Soviet, 14 May 1959)
 They say that they have more bombers, and the Soviet Union has
 fewer bombers.  They allege that the Soviet Union has but few
 intercontinental rockets.  ...It should be pointed out that it
 is always better to count in one's own Docket than in someone else's.
 Interview with SPA editors,   May 1959)
 Eminent Social Democratic leaders, who called themselves Marxists,
 asserted that the birth of the Soviet state was unlawful, that
 the socialist revolution in. Russia was an illegitimate revolu-
 tion.  ...You know how they illegitimate children  are regarded
 in the capitalist society.  And yet, illegitimate children are
 frequently far stronger and more flitted than legitimate children.
 (Speech in Leipzig, 7 March 1959)
 The imperialists would like to destroy the socialist countries as
 a hungry wolf would like to kill a lion  but here is the rub: stomach is too small and the teeth, too, are not what they were--
 worn down, you know.  (Spee(3h in Leipaig,,7 March 1959)
 Regarding intervention in Lebanon and Jordan  ...it is high time
 to understand that lions can no longer frighten people by their
 row that it is a thing of the past when countries could be
 seized with impunity and peoples plundered.   (at a Moscow reception
 for UAR Defense Minister Am:ir, 21 October 1958)
 W. do not want to be like the lamb who is defenseless againgt the
 wolf.  Both the lamb and the wolf live on the same earth.  But
 the wolf devours the lamb by the right of strength.  We do not
 want to be in the position of the lamb.  We must have teeth so that
 the wolves know they cannot attack peace-loving countries with
 impunity.  The wolves may lose their skins and maybe even more--
 their heads.  (Interview with the Tokyo ABAHI SHTh UN, 18 June 195'7)

 ...are we supposed to compel the workers of the ODR to go back to
 the capitalist slavery of West Germany?  No:  The capitalist
 gentlemen will have to wait for this till the shrimp whistles, as
 the saying goes.  Anyway, who knows if a shrimp whistles at all?
 (Moldavian Supreme Soviet, 14 May 1959)
 What can I say about Chancellor Adenauer?  He is quarrelsome like
 a young fighting cook.  (Kremlin press conference, 19 March 1959)
 To do so  reunify Germany at the expense of the GDR and the socialist
 from would be to imitate the proverbial crucian carp which
 wanted to jump into the pike's mouth, and in such a way as not to
 scratch its throat.  (Speech in Leipzig, 7 March 1959)
 In Germany, there always were so many trends and hues in the labor
 movement that--as the Russian saying goes--the devil himself would
 break a leg before he makes head or tail of it.  (Speech in Leipzig)
 7 March 1959)
 ...Herr Adenauer, the Chancellor of West Germany... banks on a
 continuation of the cold war and the pursuance of the positions-
 of-strength policy.  You, Herr Kanzler, are sitting on the river
 bank with a fishing rod and waiting for a fish to bite.  But the
 fish-you-want does not live in that river.  Is it not time you
 gave up-dreams that cannot come true?  (At the 21st CPSU Congress,
 5 February 1959)
 ODN FRIENDSHIP
 We want to be friends with the bited States and all other countries.
 So let us stop talking about diktat and ultimatums.  Let us stop
 dragging a dead cat about by its tail.  ...I pulled a dead cat by
 the tail to liven up our conversation.  (During exchange with
 Nixon at U. S. exhibition; M)scow, 29 July 1959)
 Our country is larger Shan IraaJ; our territory is boundless. So
 we thought:  Well, why should we act like hairsplitters and split
 hairs?  ...we would rather not bargain about an extra penny; it is
 worth more to gain friends than to have an extra penny in our pocket.

 ON SECRETS AND CONFIDENCES
 LT-he Shah of Ira/ had developed behind-the-scenes activity.   You
 know how secrets are kept.  I think that the Shah of Iran knows
 himself.  And if he does not..., may I tell him that many secrets
 are not kept for more than a week or two before everybody finds
 them out.  Anyone who has a secret has most intimate friends to
 whom he confides one's most cherished secret.  But anyone who is
 told such a secret has his own friends of this kind.  And he
 will also want to tell his friends "most confidentially," "just
 between himself, his friend, and the lamppost."  The latter will
 then tell this to his oun friend, and so the whole world learns
 these secrets.  (Preelection speech in Moscow, 24 February 1959)
 You will remember that this Senator [Hu rphrey7 recently visited
 the Soviet Union and I had a talk with him.  In the expectation
 of a noisy sensation, Humphrey, in his speeches and articles, told
 fairy tales three bags full, such as the story that he brought a
 special message from the Soviet Government to President Eisenhower--
 of course no su^'i message existed at all--and that I had confided
 two important secrets to him..  Indeed, I could not find a better
 partner to share secrets with than W. Humphrey:  Senator Humphrey's
 wild imagination ran riot when he began to make up his inventions
 about the relations between the Soviet Union and the Cqj,.nese
 People's Republic.  In this he even exceeded the well --.'~:ncmm
 compiler of fabrications, Baron M enehausen.   (at the 21st CPSU
 Congress, 5 February 1959)
 ON THE PRESS AND PROPAGANDA
 . t, I would like to tell you a funny stern anecdc to, W. Nixon.
 A mullah once walked along the road.  When he was asked where he
 was going he said:  Up there, that mountain; they say you can get
 food free there.  People went in crowds to the place pointed out by
 the mullah.  When the mullah save this he himself believed in his
 lie:  Is it possible that they are really giving out food for noth-
 ing up there?  And he joii.ed the crowds.  This is just like your
 propaganda.  (during exchange with Vice President Nixon at U.S.
 exhibition, 24 July 19 9)
 Among the hundreds of thousands of kind and joyful faces of the
 people who welcomed us here, I have also seen people at some
 meetings whose faces were rather sad.  And when I nad a good
 look at them I was convinced that I had seen many of them before.

 the journalists of the bourgeois newspapers of Western countries.
 (speech in V1arsaw, 21 July 1959)
 I like very much the words of August Bebel:  If the energy praises
 you, think what folly you have committed, think what is he praising
 you for.  I am happy that we communists need not trouble ourselves
 about this because we have never heard any praise from the capitalist
 world.  I sincerely wish you the same.  (speech in Leipzig, 7 March
 1959)
 This /Yugoslav revisionist) reminds me of the way perky newsvenders
 sold their gutter papers in tsarist Russia.  The newsvendors would
 come running along shouting "Extraordinary occurence!  Woman gives
 birth to a girl with whiskers:"  And the inexperienced reader, of
 course, would grab the newspaper and look for the report of that
 event and would find nothing of the sort.  But the newevendor had
 sold his paper;  he had done his job.  It seems to me that Senator
 Humphrey and the Yugoslavs who broadcast his inventions have some-
 thing in common with salesmen of the yellow press.  (at the 21st
 CPSU Congress, 5 February 1959)

 story about corn seedlings grown in a hothouse and transplanted
 versus corn planted in the fiel7 Look at the transplanted corn.
 It is sickly and yellow.   There is no green.  It look like the
 suntan of a man who has been under an umbrella.  ...To a certain
 extent, certain of our budding writers remind me of corn which,
 before being planted out, has been raised in a hothouse.
 When you read books, some will move you and give you pleasure;
 others will anger you and make you indignant at this or that
 phenomenon reflected in the work.  Others will cause your eyelids
 to droop.  You want to read it because your comrades, who read it,
 talked about it, you want to form your own opinion of it--but it is
 difficult to read, your eyelids droop once again and you rub them
 and when you resume your reading they droop once more.  To read
 the book despite everything, you might take a pin and prick your-
 self to keep yourself awake to finish the book.
 jegarding DudintsevIs "Not by Bread Alone"   ...it was there that
 such a sweet-smelling bouquet was gathered:  Of course, everything
 that was said there was not badly said.  I read this book and must
 say that I read it without needing a pin.  There are some pages
 in the book which deserve attention.  Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan,
 who read this work before I did, said to me: "Read it:  He has got
 arguments which sound as if he heard them from you."
 You are well aware that in analyzing literary works one must praise
 one, criticize another, and place the third in the middle.  You
 cannot present the matter as if a man had come along with two bags,
 one containing sweets, the other bitter pills, and started distribut-
 ing them:  one sweet for one, two sweets for another and a bitter
 pill for the third.  It would be much more proper for you to share
 the sweets and swallow pills among yourselves, deciding when this
 is necessary and who is in need of what.
 A good literary critic can do very much even for the veiny best
 writer.  A clever critical article is a kind of birch switch for
 a man who likes to steam himself in the Banya.  He steams himself
 and flicts himself with the switch, and if he does not want to do
 this for himself, then someone else will do it for him; it is not
 a bad thing to steam oneself with a switch, because one's pores
 open up and begin to breathe better; it becomes easier to live.

 ON RELIGION

 Although I am an atheist, I do not want to give offense to religious
 people.  I think they will take no offense if I say:  destroy the
 myth about the devil and the priest will be out of a job.  Whom
 will he save the peoples from if they would not believe in the
 devil?  (speech in Leipzig, 7 March 1959)
 ABOUT HIMSELF
 You obviously know that I am not placid by temperment   anddo not
 like chewing the cud.  Everyone at his post must be active.
 ...thanks to you for your attention, for having listened to me.  If
 I said anything inopportune I think you will forgive me.  I admit
 I got very agitated and worked up.  I thought first of speaking
 with a prepared text, but you know my character:  I do not like
 to read, I liketG talk.  You, comrades, know how difficult it
 can be to make a speech. When the speech is written and prepared
 you can sleep sour d_y, but when it is necessary to speak without
 a text, then you can't sleep well.  You wake up and begin to think
 how best to formulate this or that question.  You begin to argue
 with yourself.  A speech without a text is a very heavy cross for
 a speaker to bear.  Iof course, am not insured against slips of
 the tongue.  Therefore, I beg you not to be severe judges. If you
 noticed any slips, do not judge too harshly.
 I read what the President of the United States of America said that
 the Prime Minister of this or that country said.  I read much more
 of such literature than of your works.  Not, of course, because I
 like this literature better than your books, but because, in my
 position, it is impossible not to read it.  (to the Soviet Writers
 Congress, 23 May 1959)
