 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 18 December 1958
 PART I
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 There are increasing indi-
 cations that the Soviet leaders
 envisage their move to precipi-
 tate a crisis over Berlin as
 the opening phase of a major
 political offensive in Europe.
 The ultimate objectives of this
 offensive probably are to de-
 tach West Germany from the West-
 ern alliance, to gain Western
 recognition of the status quo
 in Eastern Europe, including at
 least de facto recognition of
 East German sovereignty, and to
 remove the threat West Berlin
 represents to the internal se-
 curity of East Germany.
 By creating a crisis at-
 mosphere over Berlin, the USSR
 is seeking to generate pressure
 on the Western governments, par-
 ticularly from opposition par-
 ties in West Germany and Brit
 ain, for renewed negotiations
 with Moscow and major revisions
 in Western policy on the German
 question and European security.
 Recent Soviet public pronounce-
 ments and private remarks by
 Khrushchev reflect the Kremlin's
 desire to exploit the Berlin
 issue to attract greater in-
 terest in various disengagement
 schemes which would lead to the
 demilitarization and neutrali-
 zation of Germany.
 Soviet Statements
 rus c ev indicated his
 s e for a top-level meeting
 to discuss not only Berlin but
 also a German peace treaty, a
 nonaggression pact, European
 security, reduction of forces
 in Germany, and withdrawal of
 foreign troops from Europe.  He
 said that of all these measures,
 the Berlin problem was probably
 the least important.
 In another move at least
 partly aimed at demonstrating
 the Soviet leaders' desire for
 renewed high-level talks with
 the West, First Deputy Premier
 Mikoyan has approached the Amer-
 ican Embassy in Moscow about
 arranging a visit to the United
 States early next year as a
 "guest" of Soviet Ambassador
 Menshikov.  Mikoyan probably
 will seek to explore at first
 hand US views on Berlin and
 broader German and European
 problems which Khrushchev has
 linked to a Berlin settlement.
 Moscow may also believe
 this visit would lend greater
 credibility to rumors recently
 circulated by Soviet officials
 in Europe about secret US-So-
 viet negotiations for arranging
 another summit meeting.  These
 rumors, which allege that the
 United States had agreed to a
 Soviet suggestion that neither
 side should inform its German
 partners, probably are designed
 to undermine the confidence of
 the West Germans and other al-
 lies in US intentions and en-
 courage those elements in West-
 ern Europe which favor inde-
 pendent approaches to Moscow
 on such questions as German
 unity and European security.
 In an interview, broadcast
 on 12 December, with the cor-
 respondent of a Munich newspaper,
 Khrushchev contended that ac-
 ceptance of his Berlin proposal
 .would be a "point of departure"

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 18 December 1958
 for improving the general Euro-
 pean situation and would create
 "favorable preconditions" for
 dealing with such problems as
 the creation of a demilitarized
 zone in Central Europe by with-
 drawing the forces of the "two
 opposing military groups."  He
 proposed a mutual reduction and
 eventual withdrawal of foreign
 forces in Germany, and even
 from Europe.
 The 11 December TASS state-
 ment on Berlin held out the sug-
 gestion that the Soviet Union
 would be interested in a summit
 conference, but not to discuss
 German reunification.
 The Soviet note of 13 De-
 cember on the NATO ministerial
 meeting called for the adoption
 of three "practical steps," all
 directed toward disengagement
 in Europe:    the Rapacki plan,
 reduction of foreign forces in
 Europe, and a nonaggression
 pact.
 The East Germans and the
 Poles on 14 December concluded
 their meetings in Warsaw by is-
 suing a communiqud which urged
 that full support be given to
 what was described as the Krem-
 lin's initiative to convene a
 summit conference.  The commu-
 niqud went on to suggest that
 the Berlin free-city solution
 would help to settle other prob-
 lems, such as a peace treaty
 with Germany and German reuni-
 fication.
 In reopening the Berlin
 issue at this time, Khrushchev
 may believe that the West is
 less disposed to run substan-
 tial risks of war and therefore
 is more likely to give in to
 Soviet pressure.
 The suggestions that broader
 discussions be held were ac-
 companied by threats from the
 East.  The 13 December Soviet
 note warned that aggression
 against the USSR would be an-
 swered by retaliatory blows
 against NATO's "rocket-atomic
 bases."  East German party boss
 Walter Ulbricht on 15 December
 declared that there was "full
 agreement" that any attack by
 the "West German revanchists"
 against East Germany would be
 dealt a "devastating defeat
 west of the Elbe and Werra"--
 rivers on the border.
 This was the first inti-
 mation of a bloc attack on West
 Germany to counter Western ef-
 forts to maintain access to
 Berlin through force, though
 the threat appears to restrict
 such retaliation to actions
 taken by the Bonn republic.
 This remark was probably intend-
 ed to remind the West German
 people that the Warsaw Pact
 forces, represented by the So-
 viet armies in East Germany
 and East Germany's own mili-
 tary establishment, are only a
 few miles away.
 Polish Fears
 The Warsaw meeting was prob-
 ably intended mainly to present
 to the Polish people a declara-
 tion by the two powers that the
 Oder-Neisse boundary between
 East Germany and Poland is
 permanent and inviolable.
 The Poles had been some-
 what disturbed by Khrushchev's
 original declarations in November

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 that  the  Potsdam Agreement
 could be considered null and
 void since the Western powers
 have violated it.   The Poles
 feared that if this agreement
 became legally ineffective their
 right to occupy the Oder-Neisse
 territories, which were origi-
 nally assigned at Potsdam to
 Poland for provisional adminis-
 tration,  would be undermined.
 Actually,  the boundary was
 finalized in an agreement be-
 tween Poland and East Germany
 in July 1950, but this accord
 is not recognized by the-West-
 ern powers.
 The Poles undoubtedly sup-
 ported German reunification with
 tongue in cheek   since   it is
 generally agreed in Poland that
 a divided Germany is preferable
 to a reunified one.
 Western Positions
 Meanwhile  the  American,
 British,   French, and West Ger-
 man foreign ministers, meeting
 on 14 December   prior to the
 formal discussions of  Berlin
 in the NATO Council on 16 De-
 cember,                      stressed the West's de-
 termination to                         maintain its
 rights and position in the di-
 vided city, including free ac-
 cess.           A unilateral repudiation
 of Moscow's obligations in Ber-
 lin and the substitution of East
 German authorities for Soviet
 officials were termed "unaccept-
 able."
 Reported differences over
 whether  to  link  the  Berlin
 question with a call for high-
 level negotiations on  German
 and European security failed to
 develop.   Adenauer made a stren-
 uous effort prior to the meeting
 to obtain support for his view
 that the Soviet ultimatum should
 be disposed of before consider-
 ing other negotiations.
 On  12  December  Adenauer
 reached agreement with West Ber-
 lin-Mayor Brandt, prior to his
 appearance at the NATO meetings,
 that negotiations under pressure
 were unacceptable.
 Brandt, however, has again
 raised in press interviews the
 possibility of including  all
 of Berlin in a free city. While
 now opposing this plan as eco-
 nomically "not viable,"  he
 said that he would view it in
 "a different light" if Moscow
 agreed to the creation of an
 extraterritorial corridor be-
 tween Berlin and West Germany.
 He also-would accept a UN-super-
 vised plebiscite in all of Ber-
 lin to  determine  the city's
 status.   Brandt  explained to
 American officials  that he is
 attempting to take a "dynamic"
 approach in order to place Mos-
 cow on the defensive.
 In its meeting on 16 Decem-
 ber,                                                      the NATO Council supported
 the three Western powers' posi-
 tion on Berlin.   The NATO com-
 muniqud, however, pointed out

 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS
 Iraq
 Iraqi Communists appear to
 be making a determined effort
 to maintain political tension
 and thereby neutralize both op-
 position groups and potential
 non-Communist sources of sup-
 port for Qasim.   The demonstra-
 tions which they led on the oc-
 casion of Assistant Secretary
 Rountree's visit to Baghdad were
 a continuation of the rioting
 which they probably inspired in
 Basra on 8 December, when the
 army garrison there was besieged
 and the authorities lost control
 of the town for several hours.
 Prime Minister Qasim indi-
 cated this week he still   de-
 sires friendly relations with
 the United States, as with "all
 other countries," but  he has
 not given any sign of moving to
 improve these  relations with
 the West.   Qasim appears to re-
 main suspicious that the West,
 and particularly the United
 States is plotting  against
 his regime, and he says that
 "many Iraqis" believe the Amer-
 icans inspired the plot which
 he unveiled last-week.    F
 pope ar rumor   in Baghdad has
 pinned the blame on the UAR.
 The exposure of the plot
 in Iraq and the arrest of many
 pro-UAR personalities is said
 to have "dismayed" Nasir, who
 has become even more concerned
 than previously over Communist
 gains in the area.   This week
 the UAR began what may develop
 into a full-scale propaganda
 campaign against Communist ac-
 tivity in the Arab states.   UAR-
 subsidized newspapers in Beirut
 started attacking the Iraqi Com-
 munists early last week, and on
 13 December the Cairo press re-
 ferred for the first time to
 the subject.   On 17 December
 the Damascus press and radio be-
 gan to give unprecedented cover-
 age to the danger of "leftist"
 trends in the Arab nationalist
 movement and to warn that there
 were other dangers besides those
 emanating from the Western "im-
 perialists."
 While Nasir's attention ap-
 pears to be focused on develop-
 ments in Iraq, the UAR military
 authorities have remained alert
 to possible developments on the
 Arab-Israeli borders.   Two gen-
 eral staff meetings have now
 been held in Cairo to discuss
 the Israeli border situation,
 although there is no sign of
 mobilization or of  excessive

 concern over the situation. UAR
 aircraft were reported by the
 Israelis last week end to have
 conducted night reconnaissance
 operations over Israeli targets,
 using flash-bombs.
 Israel
 Tel Aviv mounted a vehement
 diplomatic campaign prior to
 the UN Security Council meeting
 on 15 December, arguing that if
 the council failed to condemn
 Syria in clear fashion for the
 3 December border incident,Is-
 real would be forced in the fu-
 ture  to   rely   on  its  own
 resources. The Israelis sought
 a postponement of the meeting
 when they found that the UN
 truce authorities' report covered
 a wider range of border inci-
 dents, including Israeli as well
 as UAR violations.  The council
 met as scheduled, however, and
 deferred further action pending
 UN Secretary General Hammar-
 sk,j old's visit to the .Near East.
 In Israel, government of-
 ficials have asserted that they
 again have been under pressure
 from parliament and public opin-
 ion to obtain some satisfaction
 for the 3 December incident, in
 which Israeli forces actually
 fired the first artillery shell,
 although the Syrians apparently
 initiated the small-arms fire.
 There is still no observable
 sign of any unusual troop call-
 ups, however, although the of-
 fice concerned with mobiliza-
 tion plans is said to be work-
 ing 24 hours a day.
 THE SITUATION IN CUBA
 Despite indications that
 the Cuban armed forces are pre-
 paring a concerted drive against
 the rebels in Oriente Province,
 army morale continues to dete-
 riorate, and even high officers
 close to the chief of staff are
 now reported to believe there .'
 is little hope of defeating the
 rebels.
 The build-up of troops and
 military equipment in Santiago.
 indicates that the Batista re-
 gime  is  preparing  a  major
 countermove in Oriente Prov-
 ince.  Troops, tanks, armored
 cars, and other supplies have
 been concentrating since about
 11  December  in  Santiago,
 and the army has dropped leaf-
 lets urging the civilian popu-
 lace  to  evacuate  areas
 where land and air attacks are
 to be directed against the reb-
 els.

 A new government offensive,
 however, is unlikely to suc-

 hindered by a shortage of sup-
 plies and a lack of effective
 leadership.  Many of the troops
 are young, inadequately trained

 all spurred interest in finding

 for outside mediation by the
 Organization of American States

 flatly rejected such a move.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 SOVIET MOVES AT GENEVA
 Nuclear-Test-Cessation Talks
 While attempting to create
 an appearance of some flexibil-
 ity this week, the Soviet dele-
 gation to the nuclear-test-ces-
 sation talks in Geneva remained
 adamantly opposed to basic Wes-
 tern viewpoints on how to devel-
 op a reliable inspection system.
 Moscow continues to insist on
 retaining the power to frustrate
 any act of a control organiza-
 tion which might reduce Soviet
 freedom of action.   The Soviet
 delegation has balked at any
 Anglo-American proposals which
 would have the effect of mini-
 mizing the need for further
 three-power political decisions
 after initial agreement.
 Moscow is particularly op-
 posed to activating an inspection
 team in the event of a suspect-
 ed nuclear explosion without the
 unanimous agreement of the three
 "founding" powers.  The Soviet
 delegation insists on veto pow-
 ers for the three nuclear states
 in the central control organ, on
 primarily indigenous staffing of
 control posts in each country,
 on inspection by ad hoc teams
 created after suspected viola-
 tions with concurrence by the
 government concerned, and on
 curtailing the duties of the
 "chief executive officer" or
 "administrator" of the control
 organ.
 Prior to 15 December, Mos-
 cow may have believed it could
 split the Western delegations
 on the issue of majority con-
 trol.   London had advised its
 delegation that pressure in the
 House of Commons made it desir-
 able that a White Paper on the
 conference be issued for use in
 parliamentary debate.   The US
 delegation reported on 7 Decem-
 ber that its British counter-
 part, in its desire to create
 the impression of substantial
 progress  before the Christmas
 recess, had blurred the issue
 of majority control to some ex-
 tent by talking of the possi-
 bility of unanimity on some is-
 sues.
 However, the introduction
 on 15 December of additional US
 draft articles which provide for a
 comparatively automatic control
 mechanism that could not be ham-
 strung by a suspected violator
 and which were obviously approved
 by  the   British. delegation be-
 fore introduction,   has probably
 dispelled any Soviet hopes of a
 Western split.
 The Soviet delegation
 promptly rejected the American
 proposal which would authorize
 the administrator to proceed
 with inspection of a suspected
 violation 24 hours after having
 notified the commission unless
 the latter, by a two-thirds vote,
 were to decide against the in-
 vestigation.   Soviet delegate
 Tsarapkin alleged that too many
 of the powers and functions
 which should belong to the com-
 mission were given to the "all-
 powerful" administrator in the
 Western draft.   He also stated
 that the commission should de-
 cide upon on-the-site inspec-
 tions in every case on the basis
 of concrete circumstances.   He
 warned against attempts to es-
 tablish a control system which
 would encroach  on   state secur-
 ity.
 The Soviet delegation on
 12 December approved article
 three of the draft treaty.  This
 article identifies principal
 components of the international
 control organ, including a chief
 executive officer to be mown
 as "the administrator." wever
 agreement was reached only after
 the Western delegates assured
 Tsarapkin that the administra-
 tor would be responsible to the

 sue of voting procedures open.
 On 17 December the Soviet
 delegation approved a British
 draft proposal calling for a
 seven-member control commission
 on which the three nuclear pow-
 ers would have permanent seats.
 Tsarapkin suggested pri-
 vately that the commission be
 composed of three from each
 "side"and one neutral.   Ambas-
 sador Wadsworth suggests that
 Soviet interest in composition
 of the commission may indicate
 that Moscow is considering a
 move away from its insistence
 on a veto.
 On 16 December, the Soviet
 delegate proposed that control
 provisions of the draft treaty
 be turned over to a working
 group while the conference con-
 tinued discussion of the "po-
 litical" draft articles.   Mos-
 cow probably intends to point
 to Western rejection of the So-
 viet proposal as further evi-
 dence of Western "stalling" to
 avoid agreement.
 has also taken a more critical
 attitude toward the Wester
 n po-
 sition at the talks, although
 it has not suggested the possi-
 bility of break-off.
 Surprise-Attack Talks
 On 12 December V. V. Kuznet-
 sov, chief Communist delegate to
 the talks, submitted a lengthy
 proposal intended to appear to
 be addressed to the technical'
 aspects of the surprise-attack
 problem but which is in fact an elab-
 oration  of the omnibus plan
 previously rejected by the West
 linking surprise-attack measures
 to specific disarmament steps.
 Withholding.' the move until after
 the date--18 December--for sus-
 pending the talks was agreed up-
 on was probably calculated to
 enable the bloc to avoid serious
 discussion of the proposal.
 Moscow probably hopes this docu-
 ment will complete and strength-
 en the record of the Soviet po-
 i sition in the talks and will
 counter Western charges that
 the Communist delegation refused
 to discuss the technical aspects
 of the problem.
 An analysis of Soviet prop-
 aganda underlines the fact that
 Moscow will be unwilling to com-
 promise on the majority control
 issue.   After having switched
 on 8 December to a more opti-
 mistic line in view of agree-
 ment on the first two draft ar_
 ticles,Soviet propaganda became
 more pessimistic again on 13
 December, attacking Western
 "evasions" at the talks.
 A Pravda  editorial on that
 day criticizes the Western posi-
 tion on a one-year ban, voting
 in the control organ, and the
 mobile inspection concept.   Pray-
 da alleged that "to insist on
 ese conditions means to bring
 the matter to the collapse of
 negotiations."  Moscow radio
 On 15 December Kuznetsov in-
 formed US delegate Foster that
 Moscow now insists on including
 in a ,final communique  a
 specific date for reconvening,
 reversing earlier informal agree-
 ment  to omit such a date.   Mos-
 cow probably calculated that
 Western rejection of this re-
 quest would strengthen its prop-
 aganda position for placing the
 onus for breakdown on the West.
 Soviet propaganda media are al-
 ready alleging that Western in-
 sistence on breaking off the
 talks without provision for re-
 convening on a particular date      25X1
 may be an attempt "to bring
 about total collapse of "egoti-
 ations."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 MAO TSE-TUNG TO RELINQUISH GOVERNMENT POST
 In giving up his ceremo-    i mid-1957 to work as bard as he
 nial post as chairman of the
 Chinese Communist Government,
 Mao Tse-tung,who will be 65 next
 week, apparently wishes to deT
 vote his time to his much more
 significant role as party leader.
 The recent party central com-
 mittee plenum underlined Mao's
 continuing leadership and en-
 dorsed his policies.  Mao's
 "communes" campaign was given
 a "very high evaluation," al-
 though the plenum advised cau-
 tion in establishing the com-
 munes in major cities.
 Peiping's com-
 muniqud on the plenum
 confirms earlier re-
 ports that Mao Tse-
 tung had requested
 that he not be nomi-
 nated next month by
 the National People's
 Congress for another
 four-year term as
 chairman of the Chi-
 nese People's Repub-
 lic.  He is said to
 have told the plenum
 that he wanted to
 concentrate on na-
 tional policy and to
 have more time to
 write on theory.
 There is much evidence
 that Mao has been unable since
 once did and has been forced
 increasingly to delegate re-
 sponsibility.  He was ill in
 the latter half of 1957 and
 was reported at that time to
 have said that he would like
 to reduce his burden.  As late
 as May 1958, the Chinese press
 confirmed that he had trouble
 walking and was easily fatigued.
 The post of government chair-
 man carries little constitution-
 al authority and entails tiring
 ceremonial duties.  The right
 man: " f or it would
 probably be a compar-
 atively unimportant
 but esteemed party
 senior, such as Chu
 Te, the current vice
 chairman.  There ap-
 pears only an out-
 side chance that the
 post will go to a
 person who is Mao's
 choice to succeed him
 as party head.
 There is much
 speculation that Mao's
 decision was impelled
 by party and popular
 opposition to his
 policies.  Mao's pres-
 tige did indeed seem
 to decline during 1957, when
 some of his policies clearly
 went wrong.  These included his
 intervention in economic plan-
 ning, the "liberal" features of
 his line on intrabloc relations,
 and his experiment with "liberal-
 ization" at home.  Beginning in
 mid-1957, however, Mao took the
 lead in correcting his earlier
 mistakes, and his principal
 lieutenants helped him do so.
 Mao's most important effort to
 restore his prestige was the

 campaign in late 1957 for a
 "giant leap forward" in econom-
 ic development.  This summer,
 apparently confident that the
 "leap" would be accomplished,
 Mao took the biggest gamble of
 his career by deciding to herd
 the Chinese people into "com-
 munes,"  The central committee
 plenum just concluded expressed
 great satisfaction with the
 "leap," and promised that it
 would continue in 1959.   It also
 placed a "very high evaluation"
 on the commune movement in rural
 areas, while repeating earlier
 advice to proceed cautiously in
 establishing the communes in
 major cities--where the program
 has caused some confusion and
 concern.
 Mao apparently intends to
 retain all his party posts--
 chairman of the central commit-
 tee, chairman of the politburo,
 and senior member of the polit-
 buro standing committee.  The
 latter body, a small superpo-
 litburo, probably originates
 most of the regime's major
 policies and supervises both
 the party and the government
 machinery.  The recent plenum
 emphasized Mao's leading role
 at the meetings and the party's
 expectation of his continuing
 leadership.
 Two years ago Mao prepared
 for his eventual retirement
 from active leadership of the
 party by authorizing the cen-
 tral committee to establish a
 post of "honorary chairman."
 Mao may intend to take that
 title in 1961, the end of his
 current term and the 40th anni-
 versary of the founding of the

 PEIPING REINSTATES PUPPET PARTY LEADERS
 Five of Peiping's eight
 puppet parties have reinstated
 more than 20 former officials
 who were attacked as "rightists"
 last spring and dismissed from
 their party posts.   In reversing
 its treatment of these "demo-
 cratic" leaders--many of whom
 are former Kuomintang officials
 --Peiping is broadening its ef-
 fort to break down Chinese Na-
 tionalist resistance to nego-
 tiations.
 Among the rehabilitated
 puppet party officials are Lung
 Yun, a former vice chairman of
 the Chinese Communist National
 Defense Council and long-time
 governor of Yunnan Province
 under the Nationalists; Chang
 Po-chun, former minister of
 communications in the Peiping
 regime; and Lo Lung-chi, former
 minister of timber industry.
 Peiping claims that the rein-
 stated "rightists" have made
 "strides in turning to the left."
 In re-electing Lung Yun
 and three other "rightists" to
 its central committee, the
 puppet Kuomintang Revolutionary
 Committee made a direct appeal
 to Nationalists on Taiwan to
 fight against the "common enemy
 --the United States."  Peiping's
 effort is intended to convince
 Nationalist officials that their
 best hope for the future is co-
 operation with the mainland,
 which could be rewarded by a
 job in the Communist regime.
 So far the rehabilitation
 of these officials has been
 limited to puppet party activi-
 ty only, but there seems to be
 some chance that one or two of
 them will get elected to minor
 government jobs at the forthcom-
 ing National People's Congress.,
 in order to underscore Peiping's
 appeal to Chinese Nationalist
 officials on Taiwan.

 leaders during Peiping's viru-
 lent "antirightist" campaign
 in 1957-58, they have not fared
 badly.   In general, Peiping
 permitted accused "rightists"
 to live at home and to continue
 to work while undergoing  re-
 form.   Chang Po-chun, for in-
 stance, reportedly had his sal-
 ary reduced but was still of
 sufficient grade to receive a
 private automobile and govern-
 ment quarters.   Lo Lung-chi is
 said to be living comfortably
 in Peiping while studying at the
 Institute of Socialism along
 with other "rightists."  Another
 former minister, Chang Nai-chi,
 is said to be still less sub-
 missive than other accused
 "rightists" and has not been
 reinstated.
 Peiping's treatment of
 these officials is consistent
 with Mao Tse-tung's practice
 within the party of "treating
 the sickness and curing the
 patient."  Only one serious
 purge--in 1954--has occurred in
 the party in the last 20 years;
 numerous comrades who have op-
 posed Mao at various times
 continue  to  be  members  of
 the central committee and to
 perform useful, if powerless,
 functions for the regime.
 NORTH KOREA PROCLAIMS MAJOR ECONOMIC AND IDEOLOGICAL GOALS
 Two major economic and so-
 cial goals have just been placed
 before the North Korean people:
 to complete the "building of
 socialism" and begin the "trans-
 ition                   to Communism" within
 five years, and to surpass Japan
 in per capita industrial produc-
 tion within a short but unspeci-
 fied period.   These goals were
 first announced in a speech
 Premier Kim Il-sung made before
 a national conference of party
 propaganda cadres last November
 but were not made public until
 after Kim returned from his
 trip to Communist China and
 North Vietnam.
 In view of evident uncer-
 tainty among bloc countries
 over the ideological question
 brought up by their various pro-
 grams for accelerating socialist
 development, it is almost cer-
 tain that Kim discussed his pro-
 gram with the Chinese before
 making it public.
 If Pyongyang declares in
 1963 that it has achieved so-
 cialism--which the Soviet Union
 claimed to have basically com-
 pleted only after 18 years--
 this would constitute the
 fastest progress, at least on
 paper, made by any satellite
 country, as Pyongyang counts its
 progress since the end of the
 Korean war.   In Eastern Europe,
 Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia
 consider  themselves the farthest
 ahead in the race toward social-
 ism and the transition to Com-
 munism.
 In entering the race, Kim
 Il-sung acknowledged North
 Korea's initial backwardness,
 stating that "our ancestors
 left us nothing but poverty."
 He emphasized, however, that
 his country is moving ahead at
 an extremely rapid pace, and
 will be able, within the space
 of Korea's present first five-
 year-plan, to achieve a level
 of socialist development com-
 parable to that achieved by
 other "fraternal countries" in
 two or three plan periods.
 According to Communist
 theory,a state must meet cer-
 tain prerequisites before it
 can claim to have achieved so-
 cialism, and North Korea has
 fulfilled three of these.   Agri-
 culture is socialized, private
 ownership of production forces
 is liquidated, and artisans
 are regrouped into cooperatives.

 On the other hand, North Korea
 does not possess a really strong
 proletariat and it hardly can
 boast of a socialist intelli-
 gentsia, although Kim has ad-
 monished all Koreans to bring
 their educational level up by
 self-study to that of a middle-
 school graduate within the next
 five years.
 Kim has asserted that Com-
 munism is not a utopia to be
 reached in the far-distant
 future, but that it may be
 achieved soon.   In this he dif-
 fers somewhat from the majority
 of Soviet theoreticians and seems
 to have taken up a now-abandoned
 Chinese Communist position.   In
 promising the North Koreans
 abundance in food, clothing, and
 other consumer goods within the
 foreseeable future, he runs a
 risk of generating reaction and
 resentment if these benefits
 do not materialize.
 A speed-up in Pyongyang's
 economic program first became
 evident in September when the
 party central committee announced
 that the first Five-Year Plan
 (1957-62) would be completed
 one and one half or even two
 years ahead of schedule.   It
 appears that Kim has'again
 raised North Korea's economic
 sights in this last speech, but
 even if Pyongyang should meet
 all of the proposed targets,
 its economy would still fall
 far short of providing the
 abundance implied by Kim.  Only
 by carefully choosing his in-
 dustrial products could Kim
 concoct a case for the propa-
 ganda claim that North Korea's
 per capita production had sur-
 passed Japan's.
 KISHI FACING OUTBREAK OF CONSERVATIVE FACTIONALISM
 Renewed factionalism in
 Japan's governing Liberal-Demo-
 cratic party is likely to force
 Prime Minister Kishi to give
 the "antimainstream" intra-
 party opposition groups a great-
 er voice in party and govern-
 mental affairs in order to head
 off a major conflict.   In so
 doing, however, Kishi may fur-
 ther dilute his power and lead-
 ership, already damaged by his
 mishandling of the police powers
 bill and his subsequent acqui-
 escence in Socialist terms for
 ending the recent parliamentary
 crisis.   This could hasten his
 downfall.
 Responsible -ant imainstream,,
 leaders such as Hayato Ikeda and
 Takeo Miki believe the time is
 not yet ripe to challenge Kishi's
 re-election as party president
 early in 1959, but do see an op-
 portunity to force the ouster of
 his top party lieutenants, espe-
 cially policy board chairman
 Ichiro Kono.   Some opposition
 elements, however, are demanding
 Kishi's resignation as party pres-
 ident and prime minister.  One of
 Japan's three major newspapers,
 the Yomiuri Shimbun, also has
 called  or the Kisshii government's
 resignation.   Party unity is fur-
 ther threatened by the recommendation

 18 December 1958
 of the party's disciplinary com-
 mittee that two members be ex-
 pelled because of their partic-
 ularly violent attacks on the
 prime minister.
 Evidence of Kishi's weak-
 ened leadership is found in his
 acceptance of a Socialist candi-
 date for vice speaker of the
 Diet,  in his assertion to "anti-
 mainstream" leaders on 14 Decem-
 ber that he shortly would carry
 out a reshuffle of party execu-
 tives,and in the continued par-
 ty dispute over whether to in-
 clude the Ryukyu and Bonin Is-
 lands in the defense area of
 the revised security treaty with
 the United'States. Absence of
 conservative unity also promises
 to lead to difficulties for the
 government's legislative program
 in the present Diet session.
 Kishi's re-election as par-
 ty president--whether in January
 as sought by his supporters or
 in March as described by the
 "antimainstream" group--seems
 probable, but challenges to his
 position on specific policy mat-
 ters,  such as close cooperation
 with the United States and a
 "firm" policy against Peiping,
 appear likely to increase. The
 task of placating the opposing
 party groups, and heading off a
 possible split in the Party, will
 be a difficult one.
 CEYLON'S DETERIORATING POLITICAL SITUATION
 The political situation in
 Ceylon continues to deteriorate
 despite the fact that the ex-
 plosive Tamil minority problem
 and touchy labor situation re-
 main under control for the pres-
 ent.   The disclosure in Parlia-
 ment on 20 November of a plot
 by conservative elements to
 assassinate virtually all top
 Ceylonese political leaders ex-
 cept Prime Minister Bandara-
 naike and establish a dicta-
 torial regime has indirectly
 implicated the prime minister
 himself and provoked new attacks
 on his government from both the
 right and the left.   Press pub-
 licity already given the coup
 plan seems certain to intensify
 popular discontent and may re-
 sult in further plotting against
 the government by rival politi-
 cal elements.
 Bandaranaike's coalition
 government, although seriously
 weakened during the past year
 by continuing crises, survived
 a no-confidence motion on 21
 November by 52 votes to 20.
 Any prestige the government
 might have gained as a result
 of this easy victory,. however,
 presumably has been counter-
 acted by the subsequent pub-
 licity and heated discussions
 regarding the planned assas-
 sinations.  The prime minister's
 personal position will become
 even more vulnerable if wider
 publicity is given to rumors
 implicating him in the   coup.
 Bandaranaike's procrastination
 in appointing a commission to
 investigate the coup charges
 also has caused suspicion; if
 charges against him are doc-
 umented during an inquiry,  he
 is likely to be under strong
 pressure to resign.
 The issue has further
 weakened Bandaranaike's govern-
 ment by renewing open conflict
 within the cabinet between the
 moderate elements--two of whom
 allegedly supported the recent
 plot--and far-leftist Minister
 of Agriculture Philip  Gunawar-
 dena,  who reportedly was to be
 assassinated.   More  open
 charges and countercharges by
 the two  groups  could  deep-

 The present tension is
 symptomatic of Ceylon's chroni-

 leftist endeavors to prepare
 urban labor for a general strike,
 illustrates a growing preoccupa-

 action as a means of stabilizing
 the situation.  Attempts by
 either leftist or rightist ele-

 concern over American bilateral
 pact negotiations with Pakistan
 and Iran and over internal
 developments in Pakistan indicate
 that Kabul feels increasingly
 isolated and may be reassess-
 ing its foreign policy.
 Since the Iraqi coup of
 14 July, the Afghan royal
 family has been nervous about
 its ability to remain in power.
 This anxiety has been heightened
 by the advent of the new mili-
 tary regime in Pakistan, which
 the Afghans apparently regard
 as tougher to deal with than
 its predecessors and inflexibly
 opposed to local autonomy for
 the "Pushtoons" in Pakistan's
 Northwest Frontier region.  The
 Afghan Government is discouraged
 over prospects of progress in
 the "Pushtoonistan" dispute,
 which it feels vitally affects
 its internal prestige and power.
 Foreign Minister Naim has
 also alleged that Kabul has
 evidence that certain groups,
 presumably Pakistanis, are plot-
 ting to overthrow the Afghan
 Government in order to settle
 the Pushtoonistan issue.  Kabul
 may suspect, therefore, that
 Pakistan is behind both the
 recent murder of an Afghan dis-
 trict official near the Khyber
 Pass and the Afghan tribal dis-
 turbances near the Pakistani
 border reported in mid-December.
 At the same time, Daud
 appears concerned that American
 bilateral agreements under nego-
 tiation with Pakistan and Iran
 will lead to further strengthen-
 ing of these two countries mili-
 tarily--at the expense of Afghan
 security.
 He may interpret recent de-
 lays in several economic projects

 AFRO-ASIAN ECONOMIC CONFERENCE
 The Soviet Union failed in
 its efforts to turn the Afro-
 Asian Economic Conference in
 Cairo, *hich ended on 11 Decem-
 ber, into a UAR-Soviet "anti-
 imperialist" forum.  Delegations
 from most countries were com
 posed largely of representatives
 of business interests who ob-
 jected strongly to Communists
 efforts to introduce political
 issues.
 Generally, the conference
 accomplished little other than
 the adoption of resolutions de-
 fining area economic problems.
 M. V. Nesterov, head of the So-
 viet delegation, aroused the
 opposition of delegates from
 neutralist countries when he
 attempted to make a speech em-
 bodying the "united imperialist
 conspiracy" line.  When cut off
 in the middle of a sentence by
 the Indonesian committee chair-
 man Soviet delegate Nesterov
 demanded that the chair's ruling
 be put to a vote.  He was si-
 lenced by a 12 to 4 vote.
 The hostility of some neu-
 tralist.delegations toward the
 Communists apparently embarrass
 sed Cairo,  The UAR minister of
 economy failed in an attempt to
 quiet the Indonesian delegation
 by appealing to Indonesian Gov-
 ernment officials.  A number of
 representatives, including those
 from India, Pakistan, Indonesia,
 Ceylon,and Malaya, strongly .> . --
 objected to the presence of the
 Russians and Chinese Communists.
 UAR arguments that invitations
 were sent out on a geographical
 basis failed to still objections
 of delegates who argued that on
 this basis Israel, Taiwan, South
 Korea, and others should have
 been invited.
 The conference agreed to
 set up study groups and to es-
 tablish a permanent Afro-Asian
 organization to facilitate co-
 operation between federations
 of chambers of commerce.  This
 organization will initially have
 its headquarters in Cairo and
 consist of a council which will
 meet every two or three years.
 Although the European
 Common Market was recognized as
 a real challenge for the econ-
 omies of Asian-African countries,
 the conference failed to make
 the Common Market scheme out
 to be "evil," as Cairo has been
 insisting.  Delegates, however,
 called for a study of the
 Common Market's implications
 for Afro-Asian states.  Aside
 from Chinese,Communist member-
 ship on the committee which will
 draft a charter for the perman-
 ent organization, the Soviet
 bloc failed to capture any
 important committee positions.
 The Indonesians said that
 if the USSR became a member
 of the permanent organization,
 they would not.
 The nongovernmental All-
 African Peoples? Conference
 held in Accra between 8 and 13
 December seems certain to be
 regarded by Africans as a major
 milestone in their independence
 movement.   Some 300 official
 delegates represented about 60
 nationalist groups in most inde-
 pendent nations and dependent
 territories of the continent.
 The conference produced
 the anticipated diatribes
 against the colonial powers,
 white settlers, and "tribalism,"

 as well as demands for the im-
 mediate independence of all de-
 pendent areas.                      However, the
 vigorous efforts of UAR-led na-
 tionalist and pro-Communist ex-
 tremists to control the meeting.
 appear to have failed.  Further-
 more, their overzealous lobbying
 for highly inflammatory reso-
 lutions apparently alienated
 Ghana's Prime Minister Nkrumah
 and other responsible leaders.
 These extremists, supported
 by Sino-Soviet bloc representa-
 tives, did succeed in obtaining
 an oblique endorsement of the
 use of violence in "subjected
 and exploited" territories where
 "democratic means" are not avail-
 able.   However, at the insistence
 of Nkrumah and other moderates
 who generally prevailed, the
 principal emphasis throughout
 the conference was on fostering
 a "nonviolent revolution" by
 means of such essentially peace-
 ful tactics as civil disobedi-
 ence and economic boycotts.
 These may soon be put to the
 test in Britain's Kenya colony,
 where African nationalists are
 led by the conference's able
 and dynamic young chairman,
 Tom Mboya.
 Despite the undoubted hos-
 tility of the UAR to the cre-
 ation of any rival to its Cairo-
 based Afro-Asian Solidarity
 Secretariat, the delegates pro-
 vided for the establishment in
 Accra of their own permanent
 organization.   Thus they pro-
 vided a center of gravity for
 the African movement separate
 from, though still tactically
 allied with, its Asian counter-
 part.
 However, while providing
 new impetus to the pan-African
 ideal of a United States of
 Africa, the meeting also pointed
 up many underlying differences
 certain to impede the attainment
 of even limited regional feder-
 ation.   In this connection,
 cleavage between representatives
 from French and those from Brit-
 ish territories was particular-
 ly marked.
 BELGIUM SEEKING NEW POLICY FOR THE CONGO
 Belgian Prime Minister
 Eyskens' new Social Christian -
 Liberal coalition is evidently
 making some progress toward
 developing a policy for the
 Belgian Congo that will increase
 the territory's autonomy and
 leave it less subject to govern-
 ment changes in Brussels.
 The Belgians have become
 increasingly concerned over the
 rapidly developing political
 consciousness of the Congolese
 and the influence on them of
 independence movements through-
 out Africa.  When Eyskens took
 office as head of a minority
 Social Christian government last
 June, he set as one of his goals
 the development of a "national"
 policy for Belgium's African
 colony of half a century that
 would in some degree satisfy Con-
 golese aspirations and at the
 same time take the territory out
 of the area of Belgian domestic
 politics.   Belgium's hopes to
 proceed rapidly with the $3
 billion Inga hydroelectric proj-
 ect have lent a special urgency
 to these objectives.
 Eyskens first appointed the
 nonpartisan Leon Petillon, former

 ister of colonies, and then sent
 to the Congo an able and author-
 itative study group, including
 colonial experts from the three
 major parties and senior members,
 of the colonial service.  This
 working group has concluded that
 the Congo's internal political
 development should aim toward
 complete autonomy within the
 framework of a new association
 with Belgium.   In the meantime,
 it is recommended that major
 emphasis be placed on rural eco-
 nomic development, decentral-
 ization of control from Brussels
 to the Congo and from Leopold-
 ville to the provinces, and on
 judicial reform to bring about
 the total elimination of racial
 and social discrimination.  An
 extensive education and medical
 program to be subsidized by
 Brussels was also recommended.
 Tension is mounting in
 Honduras in the wake of the
 armed forces' ultimatum of 8
 December to President Ramon
 Villeda Morales demanding that
 he immediately reconstitute
 his government to include rep-
 resentatives  of the opposition
 parties.   Members of the Presi-
 dent's Liberal party are angry
 over the intervention by the
 military in civil government
 and some are probably disposed
 to resist it by force.   Even a
 relatively minor incident could
 touch off serious violence be-
 tween armed Liberal partisans
 and the military elements, who
 expect clashes at any time.
 The military ultimatum was
 dictated chiefly by attempts
 during the past year by certain
 Liberals in the government to
 undermine the autonomous status
 of the armed forces.   The mili-
 Translation of these recom-
 mendations into an agreed govern-
 ment program--scheduled to be
 presented to parliament on 19
 January--may prove difficult.
 There will be pressure to "go
 slow" from the Liberals, who are
 close to the large financial
 interests that favor the status
 quo in the Congo.  The Social-
 ists, though normally inclined to
 favor such a reform program, are
 now firmly in the parliamentary
 opposition.   In any event the
 maximum which Brussels will be
 able to offer will probably
 defer Belgium's colonial problem
 for only a limited time, and
 may, in fact, spur nationalism
 since the Africans have made it
 clear that they will ultimately
 be satisfied with nothing short
 of complete independence.
 tary had relinquished direct
 control of the government a
 year ago, only after securing
 this autonomous status by the
 enactment of special constitu-
 tional provisions.   President
 Villeda and his Liberal govern-
 ment inaugurated at that time
 have thus had virtually no con-
 trol over the military. Frictions
 steadily mounted between mili-
 tary leaders, acting as the
 "watchdogs" of constitutional
 government, and officials of
 the civil government.   Many
 Liberals have come to regard
 as a necessity the subjection
 of the military to civil rule.
 By mid-November, minor
 clashes between civilian and
 military elements were reported
 in several parts of the country.
 Army officers claim they have
 lost 17 men in these encounters.

 FRENCH ECONOMIC POLICY CONFLICTS
 The clashing views on eco-
 nomic questions held by various
 De Gaulle supporters may result
 in open conflict when the gov-
 ernment's economic program is
 presented to the special meet-
 ing of Parliament in January.
 The 1959 budget probably will
 reflect the anti-inflationary
 views of Finance Minister Pinay,
 while leaders of the New Repub-
 lic Union (UNR), which is by
 far the largest group in the
 new assembly, have seized on
 an aggressive, expansionist eco-
 nomic policy as the keystone
 of their party's program.
 Since De Gaulle took of-
 fice on 1 June, he has given
 priority to noneconomic prob-
 lems,  permitting Pinay to fol-
 low a cautious stabilization
 program of his own.   Pinay's
 recommendations for the new
 budget call for holding the
 deficit to the 1958 level of
 approximately $1.5 billion.
 To accomplish this while pro-
 viding for increased military
 and civilian expenditures, he
 proposes to reduce subsidies
 and permit the prices of food,
 transportation, and fuels to
 rise, to make the social se-
 curity system self-sufficient,
 to increase business taxes, and
 to remove some categories of in-
 vestment from the public budget.
 Such proposals, even if
 backed by De Gaulle, face al-
 most certain parliamentary op-
 position.   Some labor and busi-
 ness  leaders already fear that
 Pinay's conservative policy may
 be pushing the reduced level
 of activity in some sectors of
 the economy--such as textiles--
 into a full-scale recession.
 Moreover, Pinay's own Indepen-
 dent party, the second largest
 group to emerge from the Novem-
 ber elections, is supported
 primarily by business interests
 adamantly opposed to new taxa-
 tion.   The UNR's program stresses
 greatly increased government
 investments of a pump-priming
 nature, while the Socialists
 and other left-of-center depu-
 ties automatically oppose ef-
 forts to reduce social security
 benefits or subsidies.
 With regard to labor prob-
 lems, which are again becoming
 serious, De Gaulle is reported
 determined to put into effect
 the "association of labor and
 capital" program in which he
 has long been interested.   A

 SOVIET POLICY TOWARD THE NEW IRAQI REGIME
 Since the Iraqi coup in
 July, the USSR has worked inten-
 sively to encourage the emer-
 gence in Iraq of a pro-Soviet
 "client" regime.  This would
 permit the USSR to, attack the
 remaining Western interests
 and possessions in the Middle
 East, particularly oil in Ku-
 wait, the Persian Gulf, and
 Iraq.   Immediately hailing the
 overthrow of the Nuri Said re-
 gime as "knocking the
 'keystone' out of the
 Baghdad Pact," Soviet
 leaders have indicat-
 ed they value the fur-
 ther "encircling" of
 Turkey and the expo-
 sure of Iran to a
 new source of anti-
 Western pressure.
 Moscow probably ex-
 pects that the rev-
 olutionary regime
 in Iraq will also
 increase pressure
 on neighboring Jor-
 dan, Saudi Arabia,
 and Kuwait to mod-
 erate their pro-
 Western policies.
 Post-Coup Support
 Following its speedy re-
 cognition of the revolutionary
 government on 16 July, Moscow
 undertook a series of diploma-
 tic and propaganda initiatives
 designed to ingratiate itself
 with the new regime and to fore-
 stall possible military counter-
 action by Iraq's pro-Western
 neighbors or by Western forces.
 Starting with Nasir's hasty vis-
 it to the Soviet capital, Moscow
 cooperated closely with Cairo
 in efforts to contain the Anglo-
 American military intervention
 to Lebanon, and Jordan.
 TASS announced on 17 July
 that Soviet air and ground forces
 in the southern USSR would hold
 maneuvers--subsequently condtcted
 in the border areas adjacent to'
 Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan.
 Soviet officials in a number of
 countries claimed that although
 Moscow had not reacted with mil-
 itary force in Lebanon and Jor-
 dan, any armed attack against
 the new Iraqi Government would
 lead to direct Soviet military
 counteraction--most likely through
 Iran.   Khrushchev made a series
 of proposals starting on 19 July
 for a heads-of-government meet-
 ing to end the "military con-
 flict" in the Middle East.
 Moscow followed up its
 early recognition by assign-

 1948 and, more recently, headed
 the Near East Department of the
 Soviet Foreign Ministry.   Zayt-
 sev arrived in Baghdad on  4
 August with an eight-man dip-
 lomatic staff, including sev-
 eral Middle East specialists,,
 and immediately launched a cam-
 paign to establish close So-'
 viet-Iraqi political, economic,
 and cultural ties.
 Views on UAR-Iragi "Unity"
 To the surprise of many
 of Nasir's  supporters, the
 Soviet-controlled Iraqi Commu-
 nist party, instead of backing
 Cairo's efforts to stampede
 Iraq into a merger with the
 UAR, led the Iraqi public in
 opposition  by  urging  "fed-
 eration"   instead of Nasir's
 immediate  "unity."   Moscow,
 dissatisfied  with  Nasir's
 frustration of its Syrian "ex-
 periment" and the suppression
 of Syrian Communist party ac-
 tivities following formation
 of the UAR in February 1958,
 wished to avoid a repetition
 of this development in Iraq.
 In September Khalid Bakdash,
 the top Middle Eastern Commu-
 nist leader,;made the..COmmunist
 position d1ear. with a :Moscow* -
 approved,.attack on. Communists
 who are: willing:. to. compromise
 party aims, for the sake-'of Arab
 unity, stating:  "We are parti-
 sans of Arab unity, but we-.,,
 will never dissolve our party."
 Soviet leaders apparently
 saw in Qasim's tolerance of Com-
 munist party activities an op-
 portunity not only to develop
 real influence in the Iraqi
 Government, but through Bagh-
 dad to pave the way for the
 spread of Soviet and Communist
 influence throughout the Arab
 world, and to develop a rival
 center of radical Arab nation-
 alism which could be used to
 force Nasir into closer collab-
 oration.  Moscow may consider
 that Cairo will now have to
 compete with Baghdad for Arab
 loyalties on issues of para-
 mount Arab interest--including
 "anti-imperialism,"  economic
 development, and the fate of
 Israel--thus  posing the threat
 to Nasir of Communist-inspired
 attacks on these issues and
 restricting his freedom to com-
 promise with the West.
 Moscow probably believes
 that Cairo's long-standing anti-
 Western campaign and growing
 dependence on the bloc for eco-
 nomic and military support se-
 verely limit Nasir's ability
 to take an open stand against
 the Communists over the set-
 back of his ambition to merge
 Iraq with the UAR, or to seek
 even a temporary detente with
 the West.  Khrushchev's  an-
 nouncement on 23 October of a
 loan of $100,000,000 to the
 UAR to begin construction of
 the Aswan High Dam project may
 have been intended at least in
 part to conciliate Nasir for
 his loss of prestige in Iraq,
 as well as to impede any fur-
 ther UAR economic rapproche-
 ment with the West.
 Arms Aid to Iraq
 Moscow's  quick offer of
 arms, military equipment, and
 training assistance to the new
 Iraqi Government provided a
 major lever to influence Iraqi
 policy.   Discussions over arms
 for Iraq were apparently under
 way as early as late July among
 Soviet, Iraqi, and UAR offi-
 cials.  During August Iraq re-
 ceived  a  steady  flow  of
 military assistance from the
 UAR,   including  bloc arms
 previously   delivered  to  Sy-
 ria                                                       and  moved        overland  to
 Iraq.

 Iraq is to acquire a wide range
 of arms and military equipment,
 including jet aircraft.   Pre-
 cise details of the agreement
 are not known; the total, how-
 ever, is believed to approx-
 imate $170, 000, 000 and to in-
 clude liberal payment terms
 similar to those in bloc agree-
 ments with the UAR.   Baghdad
 reportedly intends to equip
 one armored division and one
 or two infantry divisions with
 bloc materiel, and to expand
 greatly the Iraqi air force.
 Encouraged by statements
 of Iraqi officials that the
 revolutionary government was
 willing to develop economic
 relations will all countries,
 Moscow moved rapidly to re-
 establish commercial ties which
 were interrupted when Iraq broke
 off diplomatic relations in Jan-
 uary 1955, and to reduce Iraq's
 dependence on the West by of-
 fers of specialists and tech-
 nical training assistance.
 The Soviet-Iraqi general
 trade and payments agreement
 signed in Baghdad on 11 Octo-
 ber provides for an increased
 exchange of goods and author-
 izes Moscow to establish trade
 offices in Baghdad and Basra.
 At the signing,  Iraqi Minister
 of Economy Kubba, an extreme
 leftist, hailed the agreement
 as the first stage in the con-
 clusion of others, "more de-
 tailed, wider in scope, and
 more far-reaching."   Despite
 the fanfare, the only specific
 result to date of the Soviet
 agreement has been Moscow's
 purchase of 2,000 tons of
 Iraqi dates--an amount in line
 with pre-1955 purchases.
 Iraq and East Germany
 signed a similar agreement on
 26 October.   Hungarian, Czech,
 and Polish trade missions have
 also visited Baghdad in at-
 tempts to stimulate trade, and
 Communist China's new diplo-
 matic mission has offered to
 exchange manufactured goods for
 Iraqi oil.
 Oil Policy
 Moscow views Western de-
 pendence on and exploitation
 of Middle East oil as extremely
 vulnerable points in the West's
 relations with the Arab world.
 While the revolutionary regime
 so far has taken little action
 against the Western oil inter-
 ests in Iraq and Qasim appar-
 ently realizes that stoppage of
 Iraqi oil supplies might invite
 strong Western counteraction as
 well as cut off a vital source
 of revenue, Soviet leaders prob-
 ably hope to influence Baghdad's
 petroleum policy in order to
 threaten Western European oil
 supplies.
 The USSR is directing a
 multipronged propaganda cam-
 paign to heighten Arab sensi-
 tivity to Western "exploitation,"
 by encouraging Arab encroach-
 ment on Western Middle East oil
 interests.   Bloc propagandists
 are urging the Arab states to
 seek a greater share of oil
 revenues and management at all
 stages from exploration to sale
 to the ultimate consumer, and
 are pointing to oil profits
 and nationalization of foreign
 investments to provide capital
 for Middle Eastern development
 projects.   D. N. Pritt, a Brit-
 ish lawyer active in pro-Commu-
 nist causes, arrived in Baghdad
 in late September as a guest of
 the Iraqi Government, presumably
 to advise on oil policy.

 Moscow may plan to accept

 for arms sold to Iraq.   Ship-

 Railroad from the western USSR.
 At the present time the USSR
 does not have the facilities to

 share of Iraq's oil.
 Communist Influence
 Soviet leaders look on
 Iraqi Communists essentially as
 a means of influencing the rev-
 olutionary regime to align it-
 self with the Soviet goals in
 the area.   The Iraqi Communist
 party, strengthened by the re-
 lease from jail and return from
 exile of many of its most able
 members, has taken advantage of
 the Qasim regime's tolerance to
 wage an open campaign to organ-
 ize the "street" and to stir up
 anti-Western sentiment.   While
 the extent to which Iraqi Com-
 munists influence Qasim per-
 sonally or the government gen-
 erally is not clear, Qasim has
 used or at least permitted
 Communist-led street demonstra-
 tions on his behalf against
 Baathist and other pro-Nasir
 elements.  The Communists ap-
 parently have penetrated the
 government and have been es-
 pecially successful in gaining
 control over Iraqi propaganda

 The new military regime
 in Pakistan inherited an econ-

 The failure of agricultural out-

 increase in industrial produc-

 cotton exports for foreign
 exchange earnings.  This'sit-

 in his government, and Qasim has
 apparently become even more de-
 pendent than before on the sup-
 port of Communist or pro-Soviet
 "independents" not tainted by
 association with the UAR or the
 West.  As an aftermath of the
 plot, some stanch anti-Commu-
 nists in the security forces ap-
 parently have been replaced.
 The fluid domestic scene plus
 Qasim's need for continued bloc
 diplomatic, economic, and arms
 support makes an early crack-
 down on Iraqi Communists un-
 likely.
 Moscow has also renewed
 its overtures to the Kurds, ap-
 parently as a means of pressur-
 ing Qasim. as well as for exert-
 ing pressure on Iran, Turkey,
 and the Syrian region of the
 UAR, which have large Kurdish
 minorities.   Although in the
 immediate postwar period  both
 the USSR and the Iraqi Commu-
 nist party agitated for an in-
 dependent Kurdistan, since the
 July coup they have instead em-
 phasized the themes of Kurdish-
 Arab friendship and Kurdish
 autonomy within the Iraqi state.
 The return to Iraq on 5 October
 of Mulla Mustafa al-Barzani,
 Iraq's leading Kurdish figure,
 from 11 years of exile in the
 bloc has been followed by a
 general upsurge of Kurdish
 political activity and bolder
 demands for autonomy.

 RICE      WHEAT

 In contrast to the poor
 performance in agriculture, in-
 dustrial production in Pakistan
 has increased rapidly,  although
 it still accounts for only about
 10 percent of Pakistan's gross
 national product.   Large foreign-
 exchange earnings from jute and
 cotton sales during the Korean
 war boom enabled the importation
 of considerable amounts of in-
 dustrial equipment,  and protec-
 tive tariffs and import restric-
 tions provided a profitable do-
 mestic market for consumer goods
 and light-industrial items.
 Past governments were not
 selective in approving new in-
 dustrial plants,  however,  and
 permitted the establishment of
 more factories requiring imported
 raw materials than could be ade-
 quately supplied.   Thus industry,
 despite its impressive growth,
 is operating at only about 50
 percent of capacity because of
 raw material shortages.
 foreign trade.   Raw
 jute and cotton exports
 account for over three
 fourths of Pakistan's
 total exports,  and jute
 manufactures and cotton
 textiles account for
 part of the remainder.
 The development of sub-
 stitutes for jute and
 the world oversupply
 of cotton and cotton
 textiles make unlikely
 any significant long-
 term improvement in
 earnings from these
 products,  although cot-
 ton exports should
 rise above the extreme-
 ly low level of 1958.
 The decline in
 exports in the past
 two years has reduced
 Pakistan's gold and
 foreign-exchange re-
 serves from $271,000,-
 000 at the end of 1956 to an all-
 time low of $130,000,000 at the
 end of September 1958. The sharp
 fall in the reserves during 1958
 caused widespread rumors of de-
 valuation, which strong govern-
 ment denials did not completely
 dispel.   The new regime has ob-
 tained a $25,000,000 line of
 credit from the International
 Monetary Fund to bolster confi-
 dence in Pakistan's currency.
 Unless the reserves continue the
 rise which began about the time
 the new regime took over, how-
 ever,  such rumors may revive and
 further domplicate the task of
 the government.
 Since most of Pakistan's
 industry is, and probably will
 remain, a high-cost industry,
 its export potential is limited.
 The earlier hope that it might
 become an oil exporter has been
 diminished,  as the five major
 oil companies drilling in Paki-
 stan have had no success to date
 and are discouraged about future
 prospects.   It is doubtful whether

 by reducing imports.
 A vigorous agricultur-

 holdings of about 12 to 50 acres,
 again depending on the type of
 land.   This program has already
 encountered opposition from the
 landlords and,  if the new land
 law is to be successful,  it must
 eliminate any loopholes through
 which they could avoid the full
 impact of the reform.
 The regime also faces dif-
 ficulty in formulating price
 controls that will prevent goug-
 ing of the public without hamper-
 ing incentives.   Profit margins
 were originally set at low lev-
 els.   The government has recent-
 ly felt it necessary to increase
 such margins,  although such an
 increase probably will cost it
 some support among the urban
 elements who hailed its earlier--
 and stricter--price controls.
 More important than either
 of these individual reforms in
 determining the long-run pros-
 pects of the regime,  however,
 is its ability to formulate and
 execute a broad, well-conceived
 economic development program.
 Such a program would require a
 period of austerity during which
 it would probably lose at least
 some public support from those
 who hoped for immediate improve-
 ments.   This austerity would be
 called for at the same time it
 attempts to increase popular
 participation in economic devel-
 opment activities.
 Nevertheless, a determined
 government should be able to
 bring about increased production
 within a few years,  especially
 since some large projects will
 SECRET
 come into production during
 this period.   The men now being
 chosen for high positions deal-
 ing with economic affairs are
 competent,  although the degree
 to which their advice will be
 followed is not certain.   Army
 leaders, however, have acquired
 a considerable knowledge of agri-
 cultural affairs through the
 operation of farms which supply
 the army's food, and so are gen-
 erally aware of what must be
 done to increase food produc-
 tion.
 Over a longer period,  the
 government may find it necessary
 also to cut military expendi-
 tures to achieve significant
 and sustained economic progress
 without increased foreign aid.
 Expenditures for defense are as
 large as the government's in-
 vestment expenditures. Defense
 costs will increase from $210,-
 000,000 to $260,000,000 within
 a few years,  and the foreign ex-
 change portion of defense ex-
 penditures--apart from American
 aid--will increase from $50,000,-
 000 to nearly $70,000,000 if the
 armed forces are maintained at
 their present size.
 The ultimate success of
 Pakistan's economic development
 program may depend on settlement
 with India of the disputes over
 Kashmir and the waters of the
 Indus River basin.   Without such
 a settlement,  the government
 will find it difficult to con-
 centrate on developmental prob-
 lems and the armed forces cannot
 easily be reduced in   size.
