 FROM: EA - John H.  Holdridge
 SUBJECT: Visit of Chinese Vice Premier/Foreign Minister
 Huang Hua, October 29-30 - Scope Paper.
 SUMMARY
 Huang Hua's visit will be a critical  follow-up to
 discussions with Premier Zhao Ziyanq  in Cancun,  possibly
 affording the last, direct, high-level contact with the
 Chinese  leadership before we make a  final decision on
 replacement aircraft  for Taiwan.  The visit  reciprocates
 your June trip.  It will provide  the first opportunity to
 expose Huang to a range of top USG leaders from this
 administration.  In addition  to meeting with you,  Huang
 will  have  a meeting with  the   President,  lunch  with  the
 Vice President,  and  separate meetings with Secretary
 Weinberger
 Department meetings will permit a  fuller exchange of
 views on bilateral    issues raised at Cancun and a venue
 for policy discussion on a broad  range of  international
 questions:  European and Soviet affairs,  post-Sadat Middle
 East,  Afghanistan,   Southeast Asia,  Korea, and Southern Africa.
 I.   OBJECTIVES
 1.     Follow up on Reagan-Zhao Ziyang meeting  in Cancun.
 2.     Discuss  European  issues: TPJF,  Poland, Arms  Control,
 etc.
 3.     Discuss and,  where  appropriate,  seek to coordinate
 policy on international   issues:  Afghanistan, Namibia,
 Middle East,  Southeast Asia,  and Korea.
 4.     Reaffirm US willingness  to begin an arms transfer
 relationship with China-and  receive LIU Huagina.

 IV.  Discussion of Objectives
 2.   Discuss important European issues, such as
 U.S.-Soviet relations,  Poland,  TNF,  and arms control.
 Expand on the readout provided to Ambassador Chai earlier
 and in your letter to Huang of your meetings with Gromyko.
 It is important for Huang to understand that while our
 Soviet policy has fundamentally and durably changed, we
 feel improved relations are possible if the Soviets will
 restrain their international behavior and accept the
 principle of reciprocity in bilateral relations.   Our
 approach to the Soviets in a variety of fields,  including
 key European questions such as TNF, arms control and
 Poland, will be a tough one.   To be successful, we will
 need the support of ou' friends and allies;  the display
 of continued solidarity within the Atlantic Alliance
 will be particularly important.   FYI.   German Foreign
 Minister Genscher visited China October 5-7 and saw a
 number of China's top leaders,  including Huang Hua.
 --   AS I INDICATED IN MY LETTER TO YOU, THE MAIN
 PURPOSE OF MY MEETINGS WITH SOVIET FOREIGN MINISTER GROMYKO
 AT THE UNGA WAS TO DRIVE HOME TO THE SOVIETS THAT OUR
 EAST-WEST POLICY HAS FUNDAMENTALLY AND DURABLY CHANGED,
 THAT SOVIET MILITARY BUILDUP AND LACK OF INTERNATIONAL
 RESTRAINT WILL HENCEFORTH BE MET WITH DETERMINED AND
 APPROPRIATE U.S.  MILITARY AND POLITICAL RESPONSE.
 --  AT THE SAME TIME,  WE WANT TO CONVINCE THE SOVIETS
 THAT WE ARE SINCERELY INTERESTED IN IMPROVED RELATIONS,
 INCLUDING RENEWED ARMS CONTROL NEGOTIATIONS,  BUT THAT
 PROGRESS HINGES ON GREATER SOVIET RESTRAINT AND RESPECT
 FOR THE SECURITY INTERESTS OF OTHER STATES.

 --   GROMYKO'S REACTION WAS SOBER AND NON-POLEMICAL.
 HE GAVE NO GROUND, AND HE LEFT ME WITH NO ILLUSIONS ON
 PROGRESS IN THE FUTURE.
 --   WE DID REACH AGREEMENT ON OPENING TALKS ON
 THEATER NUCLEAR FORCES  (TNF)  ON NOVEMBER 30, AND WE
 AGREED-TO MEET AGAIN EARLY IN 1982.   WE WILL CONTINUE
 OUR TOUGH APPROACH IN THESE FUTURE CONTACTS.
 --   WE SEEK GLOBAL LIMITS ON TNF,  RECOGNIZING THAT
 THE SOVIETS ENJOY GEOGRAPHICAL ADVANTAGES IN DEPLOYING
 THEIR THEATER FORCES.
 --   WE NEED TO BACK UP OUR APPROACH TO THE SOVIETS
 WITH CONVINCING DISPLAYS OF SOLIDARITY WITHIN THE ATLANTIC
 ALLIANCE.    IN THAT CONNECTION,  WE CONSIDER PARTICULARLY
 IMPORTANT FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE DEPLOYMENT TRACK OF
 NATO'S  1979 LONG-RANGE THEATER NUCLEAR FORCE DECISION.
 --   AS YOU KNOW,  PRESIDENT REAGAN HAS ANNOUNCED A
 COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO IMPROVE OUR STRATEGIC NUCLEAR
 FORCES.    THIS WILL MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVE-
 NESS OF OUR DETERRENT IN THIS DECADE AND THE NEXT.
 -- OUR IMPROVED MILITARY POSTURE WILL ENABLE US TO
 APPROACH STRATEGIC ARMS CONTROL NEGOTIATIONS'FROM A
 POSITION OF STRENGTH.   WE ARE UNDER NO ILLUSIONS THAT

 WE SEEK WILL BE EASILY OBTAINED.   ON THE CONTRARY, WE

 MILITARILY, AND IT COULD STRONGLY AFFECT OTHER STATES IN
 EASTERN EUROPE AND EVEN THE SOVIET UNION ITSELF.

 WOULD REACT NEGATIVELY AGAINST ANY ATTEMPT TO REPRESS THE
 POLISH PEOPLE FORCIBLY.

 IV.   DISCUSSION OF OBJECTIVES:
 3.   Discuss and, where appropriate, seek to coordinate
 policy on international issues:   Afghanistan, Namibia,
 Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Korea.   On issues like
 Namibia, China, with its Third World ties can be a strong
 and helpful voice for moderation.   China remains a staunch
 opponent of Soviet and Soviet-backed aggression in Southwest
 and Southeast Asia.   In the Middle East, China, while dis-
 agreeing over the degree of US support for Israel,  is
 pushing strongly for an overall peaceful settlement.   During
 PLO leader Yasir Arafat's visit to Beijing, China pressed
 for PLO recognition of Israel's right to exist by urging
 acceptance of the Saudi eight points.   During Egyptian
 President Mubarak's recent visit, the Chinese urged Egypt to
 rekindle its ties to Saudi Arabia and assume a more active
 leadership role among the moderate Arab camp.   We,  however,
 oppose China's sale of small arms to Libya.   We want to
 encourage China in efforts of moderation and coordinate
 China's approach with our own policies.
 TALKING POINTS:
 -- I RAISED AFGHANISTAN IN MY MEETINGS WITH GROMYKO.
 DESPITE INDICATIONS OF INCREASING SOVIET FRUSTRATION OVER
 INABILITY TO MAKE MILITARY HEADWAY, THEY SHOW NO SIGN OF
 FLEXIBILITY.
 -- WE INTEND TO KEEP UP PRESSURE INTERNATIONALLY ON THE
 SOVIETS TO WITHDRAW THEIR FORCES FROM AFGHANISTAN.
 -- WE ARE WORKING TOWARD A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN
 NAMIBIA THAT WOULD INVOLVE A CUBAN TROOP WITHDRAWAL FROM
 ANGOLA, SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UN PLAN
 (SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION  435)  FOR NAMIBIA.

 DEPARTMENT OF STATE
 BRIEFING PAPER
 PRC - TAIWAN:   REUNIFICATION ISSUES
 Beginning in 1978 the Chinese position on unification
 with Taiwan moderated substantially,  shifting from a call
 for the  "liberation" of Taiwan to stressing "peaceful reunifi-
 cation." On January 1,  1979, at the time of US-China normali-
 zation, Beijing issued a reunification appeal, coupled with
 a general easing of military tensions.   Beijing developed a
 position seeking Taiwan's acceptance of the PRC flag and
 name,  and  its recognition of Beijing as China's central gov-
 ernment.  Beijing offered to allow continued  Kuomintang(KMT)
 rule over Taiwan,  including preservation of a capitalist
 ecclnomy, undisturbed trade and foreign investment, continued
 unofficial representation abroad,  and maintenance of armed
 forces at current levels.  In the interim,  Beijing offered
 direct tariff-free trade,  travel, family reunification,
 air,  sea and postal/telecommunications links.
 On September 30, 1981 China issued a highly publicized
 "Nine Point Proposal"  for reunification which proposes talks
 on a "reciprocal" basis and offers Taiwan's leadership par-
 ticipation in the national government.  No mention was made of
 the requirement that Taiwan adopt the PRC flag and name.
 Beijing's proposals are aimed at several audiences,
 seeking  to make clear that Beijing  is willing to acquiesce
 in the continued separation of Taiwan in virtually every
 sense  in return for Taipei's agreement to respect the prin-
 ciple of Chinese unity under some limited PRC aegis. Although
 Beijing's offer has put Taipei  in an awkward position with
 respect to foreign opinion,  the KMT leadership has flatly
 rejected it and reiterated its public position that reunifi-
 cation can only take place after the mainland abandons
 communism.
 Taiwan's reasons for avoiding reunification, or even
 negotiations,  are complex.  The leadership fears engaging in
 talks would seriously undercut its legitimacy, and ultimately
 its power,  as well as foreign perceptions of Taiwan's need
 for defensive weapons. Moreover, given Beijing's pattern
 of periodic instability,  and record  in dealing with
 "automonous" areas,  it is difficult for Taiwan to take
 the current Beijing initiative at face value.
 The U.S. position throughout has been that we maintain
 an interest in the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question,
 but that there is no role for us to play.  This is an issue
 for the Chinese people to decide among themselves.

 BRIEFING PAPER
 China and Afghanistan/Pakistan
 China and Pakistan have a close relationship based almost
 entirely on a concern about India and the Soviet Unon.   The
 relationship has deepened since the 1978 Afahan Revolution
 and the Soviet invasion of Af hanistan.   The common threat
 supersedes all differences between the two countries.   Although
 Chinese material aid is limited,  Pakistan considers the PRC to
 be its most reliable ally.   Pakistan contrasts Chinese stead-
 fastness with what it sees. as US                   "unreliability."
 The PRC supplied military equipment, including tanks and
 jet fighters,  to Pakistan without charge until 1979.   At that
 time the Chinese informed Pakistan that because of internal
 constraints they would have to charge for their weapons.   Sales
 are, however, made on a highly concessionary basis.   Pakistan's
 Chinese equipment is now largely outdated and cannot compare
 with the modern Soviet arms acquired by India.   China has
 emphasized to Pakistan the necessity of.building up Pakistan's
 defense industry. - The PRC helped Pakistan to develop several
 heavy manufacturing and maintenance facilities.
 Since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the Chinese have
 increased their military aid.   They will deliver several squadrons
 of Mig-19 fighters this year.   They have also exhorted Western
 countries, particularly the US,  to increase aid to Pakistan.
 They have emphasized that we should not let other factors,  such
 as Pakistan's nuclear program, stand in the way of strong
 resistance to the Soviets.   Premier Zhao Ziyang visited Pakistan
 in June 1981 and reportedly made a commitment to come to
 Pakistan's aid in the event of a major attack on Pakistan.  The
 exact circumstances under which china would do so were,  however,
 probably left undefined.   The Chinese have been encouraging
 Pakistan to mend relations with India,  and Pakistan has supported
 China's own efforts in that direction.
 Chinese opposition to Afghanistan's Karmal regime and its
 Soviet-backed predecessors has been implacable.   The Chinese
 have consistently held that only strong pressure will force the
 Soviets to leave Afghanistan.,  They have stated that they do not
 oppose a "political" solution in principle,  but they have come
 out against both the recent EEC initiative and. the mission of
 the Secretary General's personal representative.   They believe
 t Iat no negotiations of any type s ould   e held before complete
 Soviet withdrawal,  and have emphasized this with both Western
 nations and Pakistan.

 BRIEFING PAPER
 China and Kampuchea/Vietnam
 The.-poor relations' between China and Vietnam are a product of
 'the 'Sino-Soviet conflict,             competition for re Tonal influence, and a
 history -of enmity between the two
 Sion of Kampuchea in December 1978,  theeexisting opoor relations de-
 generated into intense hostility and finally,                   in February 1979,
 China's "first lesson" military incursion into Vietnam.   The first,
 lesson while costly to the Vietnamese,  exposed serious deficiencies
 in China's military structure.
 Although withdrawing one month later, Beijing has maintained
 2.50, 000 troops near the Vietnamese. border, where they keep some
 285,000 of Hanoi's best soldiers tied down.   Accusations traded
 between Beijing and Hanoi describe a series of border clashes in :Tay,
 August and September more serious than any since the  "first lesson."
 However, no evidence from any reliable source s u g g e s t s that a "second
 lesson" is in the offing.   Propaganda from both sides indicates that
 tree clashes were related to diplomatic maneuvering in preparation for
 the international conference on i:amauchea and the UNGA.   Each side is
 using the border conflict to prove that the other is the main danger
 to peace in Southeast r_sia.
 China and Vietnam held two rounds of bilateral ralks in 1979, but
 China has declined Vietnamese invitations to resume the talks.   China's
 replies to Vietnam increasingly explicitly state that talks could be
 resumed and relations normalized if Vietnam withdrew its troops from
 Va:mpuchea-and ended -threats to Thailand and along the Sino-Vietnamese
 border.   Vietnam,  reversing the sequence,  contends that its withdrawal
 rrDm Kampuchea must follow termination of an alleged "China threat,"
 which.Hanoi has said could t-ake the form of a bilateral  "non-aggression
 Pac:t."   Hanoi argues that the "China threat" to Vietnam would not end
 if Vietnam pulled out of Kampuchea without such an agreement.
 China's long term objective is a regime-in Hanoi which is at least
 neutral in the Sino-Soviet conflict.   But a Kampuchea settlement, if
 accompanied by -a reduction 'of 'the' 'Soviet presence, might make possi-
 ble restoration of the pre-1978 modus vivendi,  including a pull-back
 zvrces from the border and a resumption of cross-border trade.
 Canyersely,'China -would most likely follow through on its  "second
 lesson" threat if the Vietnamese launch a    jr maoattack into Thailand.
 Such an attack is not likely.   PRC military countermeasures also could
 be t'i,ggered by a major SRV assault against Khmer resistance forces
 (which the PRC supports) straddling the Thai-Kampuchea border.
 Vietnamese forces along the Chinese border are now well-entrenched and
 well-equipped. - -(by the Soviets), and an effective -second lesson would
 reauire a massive Chinese buildup.   In the-past year, Beijing has
 increased its aid to Vietnamese resistance forces on a cheap alterna-
 t~ye form of pressure against Hanoi.

 CHINA AND THE KOREAS
 As China has expanded trade with the Republic of
 Korea (ROK), it has stepped up its public support of the
 Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).   Beijing may
 hope to assuage Pyongyang's concerns about PRC intentions
 toward the US and Seoul.
 South Korea.   Chinese initiatives toward Seoul have
 been primarily economic.   Trade between the two countries
 has increased dramatically, from $400,000 in 1978 to
 nearly $400 million last year.   Both countries conduct
 this trade unofficially, with Beijing denying reports of
 "official trade" carried in the western media and replayed
 critically by Moscow.   Ten percent of the trade over the
 past year, however, was direct.   The trade balance was
 nearly even in 1980, with the ROK's main exports elec-
 tronics, fertilizer, and textile goods.   Coal was the
 primary PRC export.
 Beijing's economic pragmatism does not appear to pre-
 sage any diplomatic overtures to Seoul in the near term.
 Although the PRC now permits Chinese officials to meet
 with ROK diplomats at official receptions overseas,  it
 continues to prohibit official travel to South Korea.
 Beijing's political initiatives remain hostage to North
 Korea's opposition and to fears that the Soviet Union
 would exploit any strains in PRC/DPRK ties.
 North Korea.   Although China's overriding interest
 remains stability on the Korean peninsula, Beijing has
 historically supported North Korean demands for the
 withdrawal of US forces from Korea and Pyongyang's
 reunification policies.   The PRC has appeared increasingly
 anxious to demonstrate greater support for Pyongyang on
 these issues, with Chinese media criticizing the US for
 impeding the reunification of the two Koreas.  Beijing has
 also urged the US to move toward contact with North Korea
 and promised to reciprocate with a Chinese gesture toward
 South Korea.   The proposal may reflect DPRK pressure on
 the PRC for assistance in arranging talks with the US and
 serve to compensate for Pyongyang's opposition-to the
 ROK/PRC trade.
 Pyongyang remains concerned that China's ties with
 the US and Japan will lead to relations with the ROK,
 regardless of North Korea's objections.   It also fears
 that the reformist direction of China's current leadership
 could undercut the rigid authoritarian system, personality
 cult, and succession plans of Kim Il-song.

 BRIEFING PAPER
 THE SINO-SOVIET RELATIONSHIP
 Sino-Soviet relations have been frozen for almost a
 decade and are likely to remain so.   The USSR fears the
 potential threat China poses to the Soviet Far East while
 China considers itself threatened by Soviet expanionist
 aims in Asia.   Neither wishes to see hostility flare into
 open warfare,  however.   Despite mutual polemics and
 frictions  the two states seem pre ared to accept a rela-
 -----------------
 tionshi  of hostile coexistence for the indefinite future
 The Soviet Union recently invited the Chinese to
 resume border talks.   However, Bei'in   is unlikely to
 respond to Moscow's'proposal in a manner that will lead to
 meaningful negotiation.   Chinese views on possible border
 talks, set forth in a People's Daily article last June,
 were couched in terms that Moscow found unacceptable.
 Since then, mutual antagonism, as reflected in propaganda
 and diplomatic exchange, has intensified.   China also has
 publicly protested the recent treaty between the USSR and
 Afghanistan delineating their boundary in the Pamirs,
 which falls in a disputed area that China claims.
 Moscow is clearly disturbed by the new security com-
 ponent of Sino-US relations.   It fuels the Soviets'  long-
 standing fear that an anti-Soviet alliance, including
 Japan,  is in the making.   The prospect of greater US China
 military cooperation is an important calculation in Soviet
 foreign policy decision-making    On China's part, Soviet
 support of Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea has intensified
 Beijing's fears.
 Meanwhile, China and the USSR retain sizeable mili-
 tary forces on their respective sides of the frontier.
 China has more than 1.5 million men in the regions closest
 to the USSR.   The USSR has a quarter of its arm  arra ed
 against China and enjoys a significant qualitative superi-
 ority.
 As long as the USSR remains a clear military threat
 and pursues expansionist policies which threaten China's
 interests, the leadership will remain anti-Soviet.  Mscow
 maintains it is prepared for better relations with China,
 but has yet to make the changes necessary to encourage
 Beijing to reconsider its course.   The Soviets would
 perceive a worsening of US-China relations as a fortuitous
 opportunity to seek an improvement_in relations with
 China, no matter how superficial.

 BRIEFING PAPER
 CHINA AND THE MIDDLE EAST
 China's goal in the Middle East is to limit Soviet
 involvement.   Beijing believes the Middle East must make
 progress on the Palestinian problem if Soviet influence is
 to be restricted.            The Chinese view Israeli policies as
 the main obstacle to this objective.
 China supports Washington efforts to strengthen US
 ties with Arab states, but feels that US policy is
 bedeviled by the close relationship with Israel.   Chinese
 media commentary has-been moderately optimistic that the
 US is moving closer to direct contacts with the PLO, a
 step the Chinese consider necessary.   China seeks to use
 its influence with the PLO to encourage a negotiated
 settlement.
 To this end, Chinese media hailed the recent Saudi
 peace proposal's stress on safeguarding Palestinian
 interests and its "realistic" recognition of the existence
 of Israel.- During Yasir Arafat's October visit to Beijing
 the Chinese reiterated public support for the Palestinian
 cause.   They encouraged Arafat to follow the Saudi example
 in accepting the fact of Israel's existence.
 The Chinese supported Sadat's strong anti-Soviet
 stance but were anxious about his lack of popularity in
 the Arab world.   They are cautiously hopeful that Mubarak
 will continue Sadat's policies, and perhaps be able to
 bridge the rift between Egypt and the other Arab states.
 The Chinese have urged the Egyptians to cooperate with
 Saudi Arabia to improve the cohesiveness of moderate Arab
 forces.
 Although the PRC supplies arms to the Middle East to
 help counter Soviet activities there, recent Chinese arms
 sales seem almost entirely motivated by a desired to raise
 foreign exchange.   China maintains public neutrality on
 the Iran-Iraq conflict, but it has supplied military
 material to Iraq through third parties.   There is no firm
 evidence that any deals have been completed with Iran.
 The Chinese have provided military assistance to Egypt.
 China also has a limited arms relationship with the PLO.

 DEPARTMENT OF STATE
 CHINA-LATIN AMERICA
 China has diplomatic relations with fourteen Latin
 American nations, including every South American nation
 except Bolivia, Uruguay, and Paraguay.   In Central America,
 however, there is not a single PRC Embassy..  in t He
 Caribbean, the PRC has relations with only Jamaica, Cuba,
 Trinidad and Tobago, and Barbados.
 China's diplomatic relations with Latin American
 nations have in general been good, correct and low-key.
 Beijing has not taken a high profile in  romotin
 anti-Soviet policies in the host countries.  Trade
 relationships have not been significant thus far, and there
 have been few exchange programs.   Perhaps because of the
 reasonably brief period of diplomatic relations in most
 cases, China appears much less comfortable in its rapport
 with Latin America than with Arica as partners in third
 world struggles.   Chinese media give little coverage to
 events in Latin America, in sharp contrast to that accorded
 Africa.   China provides little economic aid and, to the
 best of our knowledge, has no military training, aid, or
 supply relationship with any Latin American nation or
 insurgent group.
 Chinese foreign policy aims in Latin America generally
 parallel their "third world" aims, but also largely accord
 with US interests.   Chinese foreign policy stands buttress
 US interests by encouraging resistance to the Soviets and
 the Cubans.
 Despite some recent high-level exchanges such as the
 visits by the Venezuelan and Colombian Foreign ministers to
 China in early 1981 and the trip of Huang Hua to Colombia
 and Venezuela this August, Chinese Foreign Ministry
 officials readily admit to knowing too little about Latin
 American affairs.   For the forseeable future, Chinese se "trip
 diplomacy" will attempt to find agreement on broad
 principles while gradually expanding trade, and other
 exchange ties.

 PERFORMANCE AND PLANS FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY
 China's declining oil production is creating strains on the
 domestic economy and having a major impact on import plans.
 Crude oil output leveled-off in 1980 at 2.12 million barrels
 per day (b d) and declined 5% to an average 2.02 million b/d in
 the first three months of this year.   This slow down -- because
 of its impact on feedstock capabilities and foreign exchange
 earnings -- was a major factor in Beijing's January 1981
 decision to unilaterally cancel more than $2 billion in
 petrochemical plant and steel mill contracts with Japanese and
 West German firms.   It also played a role in Beijing's decision
 to channel national investment away from heavy industry -- a
 large energy consumer -- toward light industry and agriculture.
 Although the Chinese have relied mainly on their own
 efforts to develop their existing oil capacity, foreign firms
 are now playing an increasing role.   US firms sold China
 offshore drilling rigs and other oil-related equipment in the
 mid and late 1970's.   In 1979, foreign oil companies --
 including seven US consortia -- signed agreements to do seismic
 exploration in the South China Sea and the southern part of the
 Yellow Sea.  With the seismic work now completed, the Chinese
 are expected to begin accepting bids for offshore exploration
 early next year.   In the northern offshore areas, French and
 Japanese firms--with the strong support of their governments--
 have already signed exploration agreements; the French have an
 additional contract to explore near Hainan Island.   .China also
 has producton-sharing arrangements with the US, Japan and
 France to develop onshore fields in the Western provinces.
 In 1979, the United States made its first purchase of
 Chinese crude and petroleum products, $72 million and
 $25 million respectively.   Last year the mix shifted with our
 imports of products reaching $115 million, far outdistancing
 the $19 million in crude imports. Over the next few years,
 China's production problems bode poorly for any pick-up in
 exports to the United States or other countries.

 BRIEFING PAPER
 US-CHINESE COOPERATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
 Science and technology cooperation has played a key
 underlying role in the rapid expansion of Sino-US ties.   S&T
 development is fundamental to China's modernization program and
 the Chinese very much value their burgeoning S&T relationship
 with us.
 The US began discussions with China on cooperation in
 science and technology during the July 1978 visit of the
 President's Science Advisor to Beijing.  An Agreement on
 Cooperation in Science and Technology was signed on
 January 31, 1979 when Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping
 visited the US.   This agreement formalized scientific
 cooperation between the US and China and established a Joint
 Commission on Science and Technology to review and oversee the
 government-to-government programs as they emerged.
 The Joint Commission held its first meeting in Beijing in
 January 1980.  The second meeting was held in Washington
 October 15-17, 1981.  The next meeting is planned for early
 1983 in Beijing.
 Since the inception of our cooperative S&T program with
 China, seventeen implementing protocols have been concluded
 under the umbrella of the S&T Agreement.   These include:
 student and scholar exchanges, agricultural exchanges, space
 technology, high energy physics, management of science and
 technology information, metrology and standards, atmospheric
 science, marine and fishery science, medicine and public
 health, hydroelectric power and related water services,
 earthquake studies, earth sciences, environmental protection,
 basic sciences, surface water hydrology, nuclear safety
 matters, and construction and urban development.
 Under these protocols both countries have engaged in a wide
 variety of scientific and technological exchanges--including
 hundreds of visits by US and Chinese scientists, scholars and
 technicians--which have been of benefit to both countries.
 Despite current budgetary constraints, we expect the
 relationship to continue to flourish and to expand into
 additional areas.
