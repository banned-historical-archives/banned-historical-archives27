FOREWORD 
. The problem undertaken in this report is the assessment of the 
economic development of Communist China through 1957 in the light of 
the internal consumption needs of the population, the human and 
natural resources of the country, the plans of the regime, trends in 
production and investment, domestic and foreign trade, and the po-
sition of the regime with reference to the Korean War. Communist 
China, for the purposes of this report, consists of all territories 
now under the control of the Chinese Communist government -- Man-
churia, China proper, Suiyuan, Sinkiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia. 
It has been assumed for the purposes of this report that in 
general there will be a continuation of the policies toward Communist 
China now followed by the USSR and by the NATO powers and the other 
non-Communist countries. 
In a backward country such as Communist China, part of the back-
wardness is manifested in a lack of reliable statistics for esti-
mating current production of many kinds of goods and services. Even 
reliable population and Tabor force figures are lacking for China. 
The first step the Chinese Communist regime had to take in order to 
prepare a plan of economic development was to start a national 
census and set up a statistical bureau to gather the necessary 
statistics for national planning. 
Although any set of quantitative estimates of economic activity 
in Communist China must suffer from the inherent weakness of the 
statistical base, there must be a starting point from which to 
measure the possible rate of growth of the Chinese Communist economy. 
In lieu of adequate statistical data, many assumptions have been 
made as to the proportions of the labor forCe and as to price re-
lationships within and among sectors of the economy, in order to 
arrive at estimates leading to an estimate of the gross national 
product (GNP) for 1952. The resulting estimate of GNP is probably 
conservative. It must be considered provisional and subject to 
refinement and correction as more complete and reliable data are 
received, and it must be used with reservation in international com-
parisons because of the margin of error which is implicit in some 
of the basic data. The assumptions, data, and methods used in 
arriving at estimates made in this report are treated only briefly  
in the appendixes.

Tilt ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNIST CHINA 
THROUGH 1957* 
Summary and Conclusions  
Communist China has reached a crossroads where it must decide a 
number of crucial policy questions concerning the allocation of its 
resources and the trend of its international economic relations --
questions which have a vital bearing on its planned. economic develop-
ment. All these questions are summed up under the one general heading 
of the capital accumulation and investment policy of the regime. 
Communist China is beginning its industrialization program as an 
old but predominantly agricultural economy, largely dependent on ' 
agricultural income for support and development, with a low level of 
industrial production. On this economy is being imposed a system of 
organization which has been proved by Soviet experience to be highly 
efficient in attaining rapid industrial growth and an increase of 
war-supporting capabilities. Many indigenous factors raise the question 
of whether China is suited for this system of ultra-rapid organizational 
and industrial development. 
One great problem of Communist China is to increase agricultural 
exports to the extent needed to finance imports of capital goods, in 
the face of the consumption needs of'its huge and growing population. 
The population of Communist China in 1950 has been officially esti-
mated at 487 million.** If, in the absence of war, the Chinese Com-
munist regime continues its policies of welfare improvement, epidemic 
prevention, flood control, and food distribution, and if it does not 
drastically limit food consumption, the population might increase from 
1 to 1.5 percent per year. Thus, based on the 1950 population, an 
increase of 33 million to 53 million might be realized by 1957 giving 
a total of about 520 million to 540 million. This increase would

the best judgment of the responsible analyst as of 15 March 1954.

low.

normally necessitate an increase of the food supply of 5 percent to 
8 percent during this period. An increase of about 5 percent prob-
ably can be realized under average conditions, and this, coupled with 
better distribution of available supplies, should make possible an 
increase of population within the range of 1 to 1.5 percent per year 
through 1957. Recent official statements from Peiping suggest that 
the Communist regime may follow the Soviet example of the years 
1929 to 1934 -- to increase exports of agricultural crops even if 
this entails the limiting of food consumption and of population 
growth. Rapid industrialization does not offer significant relief 
to the pressure of Chinese population on the land, for the urban 
population is already large enough to provide sufficient unskilled 
labor -- presently underemployed or engaged in native trade and 
industry -- for the modern industries that may be established by 
1957. 
Another great problem of Communist China is to find skilled 
labor and technicians for its industrialization program. The re-
patfdation of Japanese from Manchuria and the withdrawal of thousands 
of the most competent Chinese Nationalist technical personnel have 
left gaps in responsible positions in manufacturing and mining 
industries which have been only partially filled by Soviet nationals 
and newly trained Chinese. The regime has attempted to reshape its 
educational system to meet its expanding needs, but the educational 
reform undertaken appears to be inadequate to provide the 150,000 to 
200,000 technicians estimated by the Chinese Communists to be re-
quired for their economic development and educational program each 
year for the 5-year period 1953-57. Soviet educators have been 
assigned to assist in technical training, and thousands of Chinese 
students have been sent to the USSR for study, while the recently 
announced Soviet aid program provides for Soviet supervision of 
factory personnel for an initial period of operations after new in-
dustrial installations are completed. Thus the solution of this 
problem depends to a considerable extent upon continued Soviet 
technical aid. 
In the relatively short period they have been in power, the 
Chinese Communists have made considerable progress toward complete 
control of economic activities. Having passed through the stage of 
reconstruction of existing plants and having established the frame-
work for detailed statistical reporting and planning, the Chinese 
Communist economy reached a new stage in August 1953 with the an-
nouncement of a more detailed type of over-all economic development

plan, the Five Year Plan (1953-57). The Plan calls for'the building 
and reconstruction of 91 new enterprises and the installation of 
equipment for 50 enterprises already in existence. The USSR is to 
provide technicians and equipment, project supervision; training for 
Chinese cadres, and management through the stage of initial operation. 
The Plan includes projects in the fields of iron and steel and non-
ferrous metallurgy, coal mining, oil production and refining, hydro-
electric and thermal power, conservancy, machine building (automobiles, 
tractors) antifriction bearings, blast furnaces, rolling mills, tur-
bines, generators, lathes, mining equipment), chemical and synthetic 
rubber factories, and pharmaceutical products. 
In summarizing Chinese Communist progress in economic planning 
and implementation thereof to date, it may be said that the three most 
important over-all objectives are industrialization, particularly the s 
expansion of heavy industry; a higher degree of self-sufficiency; 
and military preparedness. There are-also regional policies stressing 
development of the Northeast (Manchuria) and the Northwest. Plans 
for industrialization give emphasis to technical training in the 
educational system and in industry; increased geological exploration 
to discover additional mineral resources; employment of unskilled 
manpower wherever possible, as in the transportation sector; and 
Soviet technical and material assistance. Resources are to be di-
verted from the agricultural and consumer goods industries to heavy 
industry through, direct allocation of scarce resources and also 
through fiscal and price policies. 
Accumulation of capital is to come primarily from abstention from 
current consumption, this abstention being enforced through profit-
inflated prices on products from the socialized sector, through taxa-
tion of various kinds, through exactions from agriculture, and through 
voluntary saving by the population. Current allocation of investment 
favors the development of heavy industry at the expense of possible 
further expansion of internal trade and light industry. Foreign 
trade is controlled by the government to support the industrialization 
program by giving priority to imports of investment goods. 
Probably the most important export of the USSR to Communist China 
is a system of social organization comprising techniques for political 
and economic regimentation; for the development of the economy under 
centralized planning; and for manipulation of population, labor force, 
and material resources to further the achievement of economic plans. 
The dependence of Communist China on the USSR for guidance in planning 
and for technical aid and equipment is an important factor in Soviet

influence on Communist China. The economic integration of Communist 
China within the Soviet Bloc will undoubtedly increase in proportion 
to the amount of Soviet aid extended. As the Chinese Communist in-
vestment program develops, the need for such aid will continue 
rather than decrease, and integration probably will become closer, 
therefore, during the period of this estimate. 
The budget of Communist China for 1950-52 showed an increase in 
expenditures from approximately US $3.4 billion in 1950 to US $8.1 
billion in 1952, the latter being about one-third of the estimated 
GNP of the same year. The planned budget figure for 1953 represented 
a further increase to US $11.6 billion. Although military expendi-
tures in absolute terms remained at about the same level between 1951 
and 1953, the percentage of total expenditures devoted to the military 
'establishment fell during the 1950-53 period from 40.7 percent of 
actual expenditures in 1950 to 22.4 percent of planned expenditures 
in 1953. The budget figures for-economic development projects showed 
substantial increases over the same period. The 1951 figure was 
99 percent over 1950, and the 1952 figure was double that of 1951. 
A further increase of 40 percent over 1952 wae planned for 1953. 
The sharp rise in expenditures from 1950 to 1953 was underwritten 
In large part through appreciable rises in industrial and commercial 
taxes and in profits from government enterprises. In 1949 the pri-
mary tax basis for Chinese Communist political and military power was 
the grain tax in kind, when about 30 percent of the main crops were 
taken in the agricultural tax. Since then, the proportion of total 
revenue from the socialized establishment has increased, rising from 
12.5 percent in 1950 to 30 percent in 1953, while the percentages of 
revenue from the agricultural tax and the taxes of private industries 
and commercial enterprises have relatively diminished, dropping from 
27.5 percent and 43 percent, respectively, in 1950 to 11 percent and 
37,5 percent in 1953. The increase in revenue from state enterprises 
and cooperatives reflects the rapid seizure of control by the state 
over much of the economic activity in domestic and international 
trade and banking, and the even more rapid expansion of the socialized 
sector of industry. 
The tentatively estimated gross national product (GNP) of 
Communist China in 1952 was 524.5 trillion yuan, equivalent to approx-
imately US $25.5 billion. Of this total, agriculture contributed 
41.7 percent; and trade, food processing, handicraft, and native 
transportation contributed 29 percent. The modern industry sector

contributed only 13.6 percent, and the government sector 10.3 per-
cent, of the total GNP. The primary concern of the Chinese Communist 
regime is to achieve a substantial increase in the production of 
modern industry during the period of its First File Year Plan (1953-
57). A projection of estimates based on Chinese Communist production 
goals for 1953 and a Soviet general description of the Five Year Plan 
indicates that the regime will attempt approximately to double the 
product of the modern industry sector by 1957. This achievement' 
would involve an annual rate of increase of the total industrial pro-
duct of about 15 percent compounded annually for the 5-year period 
1953-57. Considering merely the natural resources, the existing 
capacity, and the growth potential of the modern. industry sector, it 
is estimated that the. Chinese Communist regime, with Soviet technical 
aid, can approximately achieve the goal of industrial,production by 
1957. Considering the food supply and educational difficulties al-
ready mentioned, however, the actual growth may well be somewhat 
less during this period. 
Even granting the possible achievement of this goal, Communist 
China would still have a very small total industrial product as com-
pared with any modern industrial nation. Its 1957 rate of production 
of machine tools is planned to be only 22,750 units; of electric 
power, 15 billion kilowatt-hours; of. crude steel, 5 million metric 
tons*; of rolled steel, 2.2 million metric tons; and of coal, 73 mil-
lion metric tons. Its total GNP would increase only about 26 percent 
through 1957. 
Although these figures and comparisons reveal the inadequacy of 
the Chinese economy to support a modern war, it would be misleading to 
conclude that Communist China does not possess significant capabilities 
for defensive, local, and harassing warfare in the Asian milieu. Com-
munist China stands today as the foremost Asian military power. The 
Korean War has demonstrated not only the immediate dependence of Com-
munist China on the USSR for all types of heavy mechanized military 
equipment but also the assimilation by the Chinese Communists of a 
certain degree of proficiency in the use of Soviet-supplied equipment. 
The Five Year Plan of Communist China is designed to alleviate some-
what its dependence on Soviet military equipment by 1957.

of many key commodities and services nearly to, or in gome cases above,

Nationalist administration brings the Chinese Communists to a point 
Of departure where their own essential competence and Soviet aid 
? must determine further progress in achieving planned increases of 
production. 
Agricultural production lags behind industrial production, having 
reached an over-all level in 1952 of only about 98 percent by value of 
the 1936 peak. Communist China still remains a predominantly agricul-
tural economy, 70 percent of its total labor force being employed in 
agriculture and 70 percent of its total exports for 1952 consisting of 
'agricultural productions. An increase of agricultural production and 
control of harvested output are basic factors in the ability of the re-
gime to accumulate capital for investment in industry. For this purpose, 
the regime may attempt to enforce control of consumption by price-fixing, 
collection of higher taxes in kind, and further forced purchases of food 
products for export. Collectivization of?agriculture is the goal of the 
regime, but enforcement of this policy probably will be tempered during 
the period through 1957 by considerations of reducing resistance on 
the part.of the peasants and of maintaining production at a high level. 
Present agricultural taxes in kind extract for state use as much as 
30 percent of total grain production. This facilitates state control 
over food prices, makes possible large profits for government trading 
corporations, permits state allocation of supplies for export, and 
contributes to the capital accumulation objective. 
It is not anticipated that any major increases in agricultural 
output can be achieved during the period of this estimate as a result 
of the state's irrigation and land reclamation projects of mechaniza-
tion of agriculture. Since the percentage increase of total culti-
vated land resulting from such projects would be very small, a large 
increase in agricultural production could come only from other forms 
of increased capital inputs, especially in the form of fertilizer. 
These measures, if undertaken on a large scale, would conflict with 
the immediate aims of the state in allocating capital resources to 
industry. It is believed, however, that under average crop condi-
tions total agricultural production in Communist China during the 
period of this estimate may be increased by 8 to 10 percent over 
estimated 1952 production. The over-all possible increase of agri-
cultural exports that might be achieved during the period of this 
estimate is believed to be as much as US $200 million over the 1953 
level.

In the modern industry sector the performance of Communist China 
in restoring production to previous peak levels, thanks to Soviet aid, 
has been outstanding, especially in the fields of railroad transpor-
tation services, electric power, and iron and steel production. The 
output of coal in Communist China is adequate for its own needs and 
for some exports. The Five Year Plan calls for a 60-percent increase 
in annual coal output, with use of additional modern mining equipment, 
from 46 million metric tons in 1952 to 73 million metric tons by 
1957. 
Because of the removal of electric power generating equipment by 
the USSR from Manchuria in 1945; power production reached a low of 
3.8 billion kilowatt-hours in 1946. Recovery began after the Com-
munists assumed power. By 1953, Soviet replacement of generating 
equipment and some installations of new capacity had restored total 
Chinese production to 7.6 billion kilowatt-hours, only slightly below 
the previous peak. The Chinese Communists' Five Year Plan, as-de-
scribed by the USSR, calls for doubling power production by 1957. 
Development of the power industry is a primary factor in the whole 
industrial development scheme and probably will be a limiting factor 
in progress in the metallurgical industries during the period of 
this estimate. Only if Soviet aid is forthcoming in the measure 
promised -- which is uncertain -- would it be possible to attain the 
stated goal of doubling 1953 power production by 1957. 
In the ferrous metals industry, Communist China reached its peak 
production of 1,875,000 metric tons of pig iron, 1,222,000 metric tons 
of crude steel, and 850,000 metric tons of refined steel in 1952. This 
accomplishment was possible mainly because of Soviet aid in restoring 
blast and open-hearth furnaces and rolling mill facilities which the 
USSR had removed from Manchuria in 1945, and also because of the fact 
that the Japanese had never used to full capacity the furnaces and 
milling equipment which they had originally installed. The Five Year 
Plan calls for increasing the production of crude dteel by 4 to 4.5 
times and of rolled steel by 2.5 times over 1952. The accomplishment 
of this Plan, which is deemed feasible, will depend largely on 
further Soviet assistance in supplying technical equipment and in in-
creasing furnace and mill capacity. If the Plan is achieved, pro-
duction will reach the rate of 5 million metric tons of crude steel 
per year and 2.2 million metric tons of rolled steel per year by the 
end of 1957.

The current production in Communist China of nonferrous metals, 
with the exception of copper, is sufficient for the needs of the 
country and leaves a surplus for export. Communist China is still, 
the world's major producer of antimony and tungsten. It exports 
most of its production in the form of concentrated ores and must im-
port nonferrous metals in finished form, largely because of its lack 
of smelting and refining facilities. Exports of antimony, tungsten, 
lead, and zinc concentrates and of refined mercury are important 
sources of foreign exchange for the industrial program of Communist 
China. The Five Year Plan calls for installation and improvement of 
Chinese Communist refining facilities for tin and probably for the 
other nonferrous metals. Meanwhile, exports of the concentrated ores 
and of refined mercury probably will increase as means of capital 
accumulation, if foreign markets can be expanded. 
Communist China has increased the production of refined petrol-
eum products from indigenous sources (including oil shale). Produc-
tion in 1953 reached the highest level yet recorded, 555,000 metric 
tons per year. This amount is about equal to civilian requirements 
for refined products, leaving all military requirements, about 1 mil-
lion metric tons in 1952, to be imported from other Soviet Bloc 
countries. 
The industrial chemicals industry in Communist China is in its 
incipient stage. Although restoration to previous peak capacity has 
been fairly complete, production is far short of requirements for 
industrial development purposes and will remain so during the period 
of this estimate. The announced Soviet program of economic aid in-
cludes the construction of new fertilizer plants to help cover 
Chinese requirements for chemical fertilizers, which are in short 
supply in the world market and in the Soviet Bloc. It is estimated 
that, even with its planned increases in chemicals production, 
Communist China will be proportionally almost as dependent on imports 
of chemicals for its industrial and fertilizer requirements in 1957 
as at present. 
The rubber industry in Communist China has been reoriented toward 
producing more of the country's requirements of truck and automobile 
tires, besides continuing to produce rubber footwear and bicycle tires 
for national requirements. From the estimated production of more than 
300,000 sets of motor vehicle tires per year in 1953, it is estimated

that production may increase by 1957 to 700,000 tire sets, which would 
be sufficient to meet national requirements. The industry is depend-
ent on imports of natural rubber from Ceylon. 
The engineering industries of Communist China are heavily depend-
ent on the USSR for capital goods and technical assistance. The Five 
Year Plan is designed to reduce this dependence. The production of 
machine tools in 1952 is estimated at approximately 6,500 units, and 
the production of antifriction bearings at about 430,000 units (the 
latter being about one-fourth of Chinese Communist requirements). 
The USSR has promised to help Communist China increase production of 
machine tools to 22,750 units by 1957, and the required expansion of 
antifriction bearings output is estimated to approximate 1 million 
units by that time. The estimated annual requirements of bearings 
in Communist China then will be about 2 million units. Integrated 
production of heavy industrial equipment probably will be undertaken 
before the end of 1957, including trucks, tractors, locomotives, 
'electronic devices, and marine engines. Communist China probably 
will still be dependent, however, on imports of all these items and 
on Soviet technical assistance to meet its requirements for such 
items in its Five' Year Plan. 
The armaments industry of Communist China in the past has been 
subject to dispersal and regional orientation in accordance with the 
demands Imposed successively by local war lords and by the Chinese 
Nationalist, Japanese, and Chinese Communist regimes. There are no 
recent comparable periods of armaments production for the whole of 
China, because of the different regional jurisdictions under which 
local production was divided. Indigenous munitions production has 
not been adequate for the military needs of any political adminis-
tration in recent decades and is not now adequate for Chinese Com-
munist military needs. The Chinese Communists are shipping a small 
amount -- about 2/000 metric tons monthly -- of their available 
supplies of military equipment to the Viet Minh forces in Indochina. 
It is believed that Chinese Communist munitions production is only 
approaching the point where it can supply the peacetime requirements 
of the regime's military establishment for light arms and ammunition. 
For the period of this estimate, the Chinese Communists probably will 
continue to depend on the USSR for artillery, tanks, motor vehicles, 
and aircraft.

The cotton textile industry of Communist China maintains its 
status as one of the most efficient of Chinese Communist industries. 
Fifty percent of capacity still remains in private hands, the govern-
ment having taken over from the Nationalists the other 50 percent of 
capacity, previously owned by the Japanese. Production is at a 
high level, consistent with the availability of domestically produced 
raw cotton. 
The cement industry in Communist China -- the principal indicator 
of construction activity -- is expected to increase its production 
from 1,750,000 metric tons in 1952 to at least 3 million metric tons 
in 1957. An increase of 20 percent per year in cement production 
would be practical through 1957, according to requirements. 
The railroad transportation system of Communist China is being 
extended to meet the expanding needs of the economy. New lines are 
being built to connect the Ch'eng-tu - Chungking line with the 
Lung-hai Railroad at Tfien-shui, thus providing a.rail link from 
Szechuan Province to the coast. The Lung-hal line also is being ex-
tended westward from Lan-chou toward Sinkiang, and construction is 
under way on another line from Pao-t'ou in Suiyuan Province to 
Ulan-Bator in Inner Mongolia. These ambitious projects probably 
will not be completed by 1957. When finished, they will provide two 
more links connecting Communist China with the USSR. The Chinese Com-
munist park of freight cars was about 52,000 to 59,000 in 1952. Freight 
originated in 1952 amounted to approximately 131 million metric tons, 
and performance was estimated at 59,461 million ton-kilometers. 'The 
planned increase of freight haulage for 1953 is 7.4 percent. Par-
ticular weaknesses of the Chinese Communist railroad system are the 
high rate of utilization of rolling stock; slowness of line replace-
ment; and the existence of a single connecting link between China 
proper and Manchuria, the Chu-chou - Heng-yang single-track bottle-
neck between two lines in Kwangtung, the train ferry crossing at 
Nanking - P'u-ktoul and the transshipment ferry crossing at 
Hankow - Wu-chang. More double tracking is needed on the main lines 
in Manchuria and on the north-south lines. 
Highway construction is being pushed, especially in Sinkiang to 
connect with the USSR and in the 'south to link with Indochina roads. 
Soviet highway engineers are assisting in the extension and recon-
struction of roads, and new bridges are of Soviet design. The 
civilian truck park, mainly government-owned, is only about 52,000 
vehicles, but this is being increased with US, UK, Soviet, Czecho-
slovak, and German models.

The formerly efficient inland water transport system.of the Chinese 
Natibnalists is now underutilized by the Communists because of the re-
orientation of internal trade from east-west to north-south. The 
Yangtze, Sungari, and West rivers; however, are still heavily utilized 
for link traffic between systems, and north-south traffic is important 
between Dairen, Yingkow, Chinwangtao, Ta-ku, and Tsingtao in the north 
and Shanghai and Canton in the south. Coal and grains are the most 
common bulk commodities shipped. The dependence of Communist China on 
Soviet Bloc and chartered Western vessels for ocean shipping repre-
sents a serious weakness of the Chinese water transport system. Coast-
al and river shipping in the various areas is closely.controlled by 
regional navigation administrations. 
The Chinese Communist telecommunications system is seriously under-
developed in relation to the present needs of the government and the 
expanding economy. Services are concentrated mainly in the industrial-
ized and heavily populated areas of the East and North China regions. 
.Types and makes of equipment are many and varied, and lack of standard-
ization handicaps efficiency. The Chinese Communists are now beginning 
to manufacture their own equipment, depending heavily on Soviet Bloc 
exports and technical assistance. Telegraph wire lines increased 24 
percent and telephone lines 15 percent from 1949 to 1952. Radio tele-
graph and broadcasting continued to fill the gaps where wire lines have 
not yet been extended. The government depends heavily on radio broad-
cast and receiver facilities for news services and for maintaining 
order, cohesion, and discipline in the country., Extension of tele-
communications services and equipment manufacture is an important item 
of the Five Year Plan, but Communist China probably cannot even 
approach self-sufficiency in equipment manufacture during this period. 
Domestic trade is one of the Chinese Communist government's prin-
cipal sources of revenue. Control of trade within China has been 
vested in about 30 state trading organizations, and although private 
enterprise still handles the largest share of domestic trade, the 
government exercises strict control through price-fixing and monop-
olies of wholesale, storage, and transport media. Cooperatives 
handled about 60 to 70 percent of all government purchases of 
agricultural products in 1952. Through taxes in kind, commodity 
taxes, purchases at low fixed prices, charges for government services, 
and profits of government trading enterprises -- all connected with 
domestic trading operations -- the government collected about

75 percent of its total revenue in 1952. Domestic trade, associated 
with the tax system, is thus a principal source of capitafaccumulation 
for investment in industry and probably will continue to be so through 
the period of this estimate. 
The pattern of prewar Chinese foreign trade can be summarized in 
two general points: (1) the trade was almost exclusively with the West, 
and (2) it consisted of exchange of primary products for food, industri-
al raw materials, and manufactured goods. Compared to this the 1953 
trade pattern shows two significant changes: (1) the geographical re-
orientation, so that over 70 percent of total Chinese trade is now with 
other Soviet countries, and (2) increasing emphasis on imports of heavy 
industrial and military items -- at the expense of food and consumer 
goods. The 1953 trade turnover increased over the 1952 estimate of US 
$2,000 million and is tentatively estimated at approximately US $2,400 
million. The percentage of trade with the rest of the tloc and with 
the West remained approximately the same as in 1952. The volume of 
the foreign trade of Communist China for the period 1953-57 will depend 
largely on (1) its ability to increa6e its exports of agricultural and 
nonferrous mineral products, (2) a further expansion of markets re-
sulting either from possible relaxation of Western trade controls or 
from further demand from Bloc markets or from both, and (3) the size of 
Soviet credits to Communist China. It is believed that Communist China 
can increase its total exports by at least 25 percent over 1953. 
In weighing, from the point of view of economic policy, the ad-
vantages and disadvantages to the Chinese Communists of cessation or 
intensification of hostilities in Asia, it is necessary to take a 
particular moment in time -- the present -- on which to balance the 
choices of alternative uses of resources and labor and available ma-
terial wealth. The costs of the Korean War up to this point have 
been borne and accounted for; the choice now lies between allocating 
resources in the same way or using them more constructively. The 
possibility that Communist China can carry through the Five Year Plan 
while supporting further military operations of the magnitude of 1952 
in the Korean War or even more intensified hostilities is very doubtful.

I. Human Resources and Technology. 
A. Population and Population Pressures. 
1. Total Population. 
The size of the population of China is unknown. Until 
very recently there had been no census in an official sense, nor had 
any reliable vital statistics register been maintained either by the 
local governments or by the central government within the past 
century. A detailed census by households was begun in preparation 
for the 1953 elections of representativesto the Chinese Communist 
People's Congress, but this has not yet been completed. The range 
of official estimates in recent decades is wide. The Chinese Post 
Office census of 1926 reported a total of over 485 million for China 
proper* and Manchuria. The addition of 11 million for Inner Mon-
golia, Sinkiang, and Tibet gives a round total of 496 million. The 
1910 census of the Chinese Board of the Interior concluded that the 
population for China proper and Manchuria was between 323 million 
and 343 million. 1/** The latest official estimate of Chinese 
population is one of 487 million for 1950, which was promulgated by 
the Chinese Communists for adoption and use throughout China. 2/*** 
Although there may be some controversy over the population estimate, 
it is generally agreed that China now has a population of about 
500 million. The base estimate of Chinese population used in this 
report is the Chinese Communist official figure of 487 million for 
1950.

Mongolia, Suiyuan, Ningsia, Tsinghai, Sinkiang, and Tibet.

registration in areas where land reform was effected, with estimates 
for cities added. A recent claim indicates that the government be-
lieves the current census will show a considerably higher total.

2. Population Densities. 
China is characterized by an extraordinarily uneven 
spatial distribution of population. Demographic studies show that 
in China proper there are 350 million to 1.i00 million persons living 
on only about one-third of the land area. Over the whole of Com-
munist China, densities vary from about 1 person per square mile in 
Tibet to over 1,000 persons per square mile in the valleys and 
deltas of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. 3/ The average density is 
about 250 persons per square Mile in China proper, but the 8 most 
densely settled provinces have over 350 persons per square mile. 
Table 1 gives the population densities in Communist China as of 
1950.

3. Population Growth. 
For the next decade population growth in Communist China 
will be determined by the extent of control achieved over the death 
rate, Since the birth rate probably will remain high and vary within 
rather narrow limits. If, in the absence of war, Communist China 
improves its public health service, completes irrigation and flood 
scontrol projects, extends the tilled area by mechanized farming in 
regions of light rainfall, constructs railroads and roads, and 
industrializes, then the rate of growth for the period of this 
estimate might easily equal that of India between 1931 and 1941, 
about 1.5 percent per year. If it is assumed that the population in 
1950 Was 487 million people, then the population increase through 
the period of this estimate would be about 53 million, to a total of 
about 540 million by 1957. If fewer of the improvements mentioned 
above are accomplished or if food consumption is restricted, or both, 
then the population increase, might not exceed 1 percent per year. 
This might result in a population increase of about 33 million, or a 
total of 520 million by 1957. Thus the total population by 1957 may 
be between 520 million and 540 million.* 
4. Emigration. 
For centuries the Chinese have been a colonizing race. 
Their movement from heavily populated areas to sparsely occupied 
regions has been limited, however, by (a) the reluctance of the 
Chinese to leave their ancestral homes and (b) foreign immigration 
barriers. During the last several centuries, Southeast China has 
witnessed an increasing stream of emigrants from the thickly popu-
lated coasts of Fukien and Kwangtung to the southern tropical 
peninsulas and islands, where they have contributed to the develop-
ment of the wealth of the area. In the crowded areas of Shantung, 
Hopeh, and Henan, the people have been less venturesome until 
recent decades. The development of railways, commerce, and 
industries in Manchuria has attracted millions of settlers and 
migratory laborers from North and East China. Besides this area 
* A Chinese Communist broadcast from .Peiping on 29 March 1954 
indicated that incomplete results of the current census suggest a' 
present total population of about 560 million. This would indicate 
that the 1950 population estimate was too low and that an increase 
of 1 to 1.5 percent would bring the population by 1957 to 
582 million to 594 million. 5/

of colonization, the nearby districts south of the Gobi Desert 
offer good pastoral opportunities, especially since the opening of 
the Peiping - Kalgan - Pao-t'ou railway. The light and unreliable 
rainfall of this region, however, makes settlement and livelihood 
risky until irrigation can improve productivity. Notwithstanding 
climatic conditions, North China has thus had an open area for 
colonization adjacent to its entire northern border, but the move-
ment has nearly reached the practical limit, pending further 
irrigation, 6/ except in parts of Manchuria. It is estimated that 
at present over 1 billion people live in East and South Asia. There 
remain no great open areas to be settled. The unsettled or sparsely 
settled tropical areas of Asia -- Borneo, New Guinea, Sumatra, parts 
of the Philippines, Indochina, and Burma -- are subject to coloni-
zation by their own nationals and are not open to free Settlement 
and exploitation by the Chinese.* 
Emigration as a permanent solution would be quite 
inadequate even if much greater opportunities were available. 
European experience has shown that when populations are large and 
when death and birth rates are high, the loss even of great numbers 
of people by emigration does not do a great deal to relieve popu-
lation pressure, unless industry is developing so fast as to 
absorb the major portion of the natural increase. In the Asian 
countries of low average income, where industry is developing 
slowly and some emigration has been going on for centuries, tem-
porary relief of pressure on subsistence reduces the death rate, 
so that more of the children born survive, and the gaps caused by 
emigrants are quickly filled by those children saved from an early 
death. 7/ 
5. Human Fertility. 
The underlying cause of the mass poverty of many 
districts -- and indeed of many of the economic problems of China --
is the extremely high birth rate, variously estimated at 40 to 45 
live births per 1,000 persons per year. Because of the fundamentally 
social origins of this tendency, a radical modification in the 
inherited social philosophy of the people is required if the birth 
rate is to be reduced significantly. The original economic justi-. 
fication for the propagation of large families was the need for

immigration of Chinese.

maximum cooperative effort in bringing swamps and jungles under 
cultivation in the early, formative periods of Chinese history. 
Ancestor worship and the later Confucian teaching gav to this need . 
the authority and strength of religious practice. The custom, 
Ilaving survived that phase of economic development in which it was 
formed, now contributes to excessive multiplication of the popu-
lation. The continued social value that is placed on male progeny 
to perpetuate the family has caused early marriage, concubinage, 
and a high birth rate. 
In the existing situation, Chinese Communist economic 
policies must inevitably influence both birth and death rates. 
Unless the Chinese Communists are to fail in their attempt to 
build a powerful society, cthey must face the urgent problem of the 
waste of human energy involved in rearing children and in training 
workers who die before their labor and skill can be utilized. That 
the Chinese Communists have recognized this necessity has been 
evidenced by their programs of training midwives, establishing 
health centers, instituting compulsory inoculation, moving food 
supplies to deficit areas, and providing regular food supplies to 
selected groups .of workers. The extension of these programs must 
inevitably lead to a declining mortality rate and an increase of 
population. Sooner or later the Chinese Communists may be forced 
to the conclusion that, in order to realize investment from increases 
in national income, population growth must be held in check. They 
may thus reach the conclusion, as the government of India has done, 
that the most practical method of limiting population growth would 
be to promote the use of mechanidal or chemical methods of con-
trolling human fertility. 
At present, however, the Chinese Communists do not 
acknowledge the logic of this argument. They have said that "the 
employment problem, that is, the feeding problem, in Shanghai and 
other places is entirely the outcome of the brutal and ruthless 
exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and 
the Kuomintang reactionary government. Under the People's Government, 
only a few years are needed to solve entirely the unemployment pro-
blem, or the feeding problem ... in North China, Northeast China, 
and other places." The Chinese Communists go further, indeed) to 
assert: 
"The fact that China has a vast population is an 
excellent thing. Even if her population increases many-
fold, she fully has the means to deal with this -- this

means is production. The absurd theory advanced by Western 
bourgeois economists like Malthus that the increase in 
food cannot keep up with the increase in population has not 
only been utterly refuted theoretically by Marxists, but 
has also been entirely refuted by facts in the post-
revolution Soviet Union and liberated areas in China." 8/ 
Assuming the official Communist population estimate and 
the above-mentioned rates of increase, China will require from 5 to 
8 percent more food in 5 years and from 10 to 16 percent more in 10 
years in order to maintain its present level of subsistence and 
maintain the current percentage of food production allocated to 
exports. The potential increase of agricultural production will be 
required largely to support the growing population, and the allocation 
for export, therefore, of a larger proportion of agricultural pro-
duction, compared with the present, would require further reduction 
of the already,low subsistence level. By corollary, lowering the 
subsistence level to increase exports would tend to raise the mor-
tality rate. 
There exists a considerable degree of inefficiency and 
underemployment in small-scale and service industries in the cities 
of China, so that as modern industries are developed, they will find 
that the available urban labor force is more than adequate in numbers 
.(if not in training and skills) to meet the possible requirements for 
industrial labor for the 5-year-industrial development program. Thus 
industrialization alone, during the first few 5-year plans, cannot 
reduce subsistence pressure on the land resulting from the normal 
increase in agricultural population unless there is a corresponding 
increase of capital investment in agriculture to increase agricul-
tural production. This would conflict with the immediate need for 
capital for industrial investment. Given the base figure of 
487 million population in 1950, and the estimated percentage 
increases in population and in agricultural production, however, 
over-all population pressure probably will not reach explosive pro-
portions by 1957. If, however, the census now under way in Communist 
China 9/ reveals a present population substantially higher than thee 
estimates, a rapid rate of increase in population will compound the 
difficulties that the Communists face in implementing their plans.

.6. Health and Nutritional Requirements. 
In China, where there has been less than 1 modern medical 
doctor per 4o,000 people, the influence of public health and medical 
programs on the population has thus far been more exemplary and 
local than generally effective. Of the estimated mortality of 35 per 
1,000, or 15,750,000 per year, about 6.7 million (that is, three-
fourths of those not dying from old age) die from preventable 
diseases such as gastrointestinal infections, tuberculosis, and the 
infectious diseases of infancy and childhood, especially tetanus, 
smallpox, dysenteries, and diarrheas. Missionary influence, the few 
Western-trained doctors, and US aid probably have produced more 
results than government measures. Scientific health programs have 
hardly touched more than the 'educated elite, while general sani-
tation programs, such as the New Life Movement of the Nationalists 
and the cleanup campaign instituted by the Communists under the 
stimulation of their bacteriological warfare propaganda, have 
apparently had little effect other than a modest improvement of 
cleanliness in public places. Outside the model urban centers, 
medical and health practices are those of a primitive society. 
Maternal and infant mortality and Control of epidemics have been 
the focus of public health measures under both the Nationalists 
and the Communists, but war, famine, and disease have been the 
principal determinants of the rate of growth. .After World War II 
the National Health Administration of the Nationalist Government 
had little opportunity to resume the splendid work which it had 
initiated prior to 1937 and which it has since resumed in Taiwan. 
The Communist regime recently has taken up the work under a small 
allocation of funds from the national budget under the social, 
cultural, and educational category. 
A few nutritional surveys made during the war among 
certain groups, such as school children and their families, suggest 
a fair nutritional status, characterized by the usual Far Eastern 
imbalance. These surveys indicate an average caloric intake 
varying from a low.of.1,960 calories a day in Shantung to a high of 
.3,500 in Kiangsi - Hunan. Despite great famine tolls in the past, 
the average nutritional standard observed in Chinese urban and rural 
areas appears more favorable than in India. The Chinese peasant is 
.not prevented by religious scruples from obtaining as much of a 
balanced diet as he can produce.

Most Chinese live on a diet comprised almost exclusively 
of cereals and vegetables, to which a little vegetable oil may be 
added in the course of preparation. Rural families derive 86 percent 
of their caloric intake from grains and seeds and their byproducts; 
only 6 percent is derived from meat, fats, and fish. Unlike the 
Mongols and Tibetans, the Chinese practically never use milk, cheese, 
and butter. They are fond of eggs, pork, and fowl, and of fish, 
crabs, and other seafoods, but most of these animal proteins are 
beyond the means of the masses of workers. 10/ 
Table 2* shows the estimated supply and utilization of 
food in Communist China for the crop year of 1952-53, with the per 
capita caloric intake equivalent of each kind of food available for 
consumption for an estimated total population of 48o million. 
Table 2 indicates a net average caloric intake of 2,011 calories 
per capita per day. This estimate provides a rough definition of 
the "subsistence level" of the population referred to above. It 
suggests that, unless increasing agricultural production keeps pace 
with the increase in population, an official policy of augmenting 
food exports may have serious consequences in undernourishment 
and debility and possibly social unrest among the affected popu-
lation. 
This brief description of the standards of health and 
nutrition in China indicates that an energetic program of public 
education in the principles of public health, hygiene, sanitation, 
and nutritional diets is required if the mortality rate is to be 
reduced generally, or even particularly among the trained per-
sonnel employed in government administration and industries. Such 
a program would be particularly important among government workers, 
whose resistance to infectious diseases is lowered by overwork and 
long hours. Improvement in this respect was recognized as urgent 
in 1952, when, for example, an examination of employees of the 
People's Bank in Shanghai showed that 60 percent were suffering 
from active tuberculosis. A more vigorous public health program 
has been instituted under the current Five Year Plan, including 
compulsory inoculations where epidemic diseases threaten, training 
of midwives, and establishment of public health centers. The Five 
Year Plan calls for the annual graduation of 40,000 medical and 
nursing personnel. Whether this goal and the improvement of 
general health and nutrition standards among the masses of

population can be accomplished 'within the period of this estimate is 
questionable in View of the magnitudeof the undertaking. Probably 
principal emphasis will be placed on improvement of health standards 
among students, laborers, and government workers and generally in 
urban areas, where better results are -essential to the success of 
the industrialization programs and where health measures can be 
better enforced. 
B. Industrialization, Urbanization, and Availability 
of Industrial Labor. 
Numerous influences in Communist China are.effective toward 
delimiting the importance of the family and breaking down the 
observance of social traditions and customs. Among these is modern 
industry.* The effects of industrialization are mainly felt locally 
in the cities of the Yangtze and Canton deltas, at the seaports, at 
focal points along the railways (north and south, and especially in 
Manchuria), and in the parts of West China in which factories were 
established during the Sino-Japanese War, 1937-45. A considerable 
and expanding mass of industrial workers -- a new type in China -- is 
concentrating in the urban areas and separating from the family-
centered life of the countryside and from the direct influence of 
old traditions and social customs. A great many of these workers 
are women, whose participation in factory industry signifies their 
increasing economic independence and the gradual disintegration of 
the old clan system. 11/ This industrial development is greatly 
needed, both to strengthen all sectors of the economy and to 
initiate social changes which would affect many more people than 
those immediately involved. China's excessive population prevents 
the solution of its growing problems of support through the auto-
matic social processes which were occasioned by industrialization 
in Europe and Japan. Any real solution of these problems must be 
effected through modernization together with educational developments 
to influence the fertility of the Chinese peasant population. 
Of a total labor force of 229 million to 267 million 
workers in 1950-51, about 195 million to 227 million -(85 percent) are 
rural workers, of which number 172 million to 200 million are farm 
workers 12/ -- that is, about 75 percent of the total labor force. 13/ 
The figures for farm labor are of necesdity only approximate, because 
of the wide seasonal fluctuation in the agricultural labor force. 
The percentage of the total labor force which is in agricultural work 
varies according to season from a probable low of 60 percent to a 
* The term modern industry ad used by the Chinese refers to those 
shops using eleatric or steam motive power and employing 30 or more 
workers. - 24 - ?

probable high of 90 percent. Subsidiary employment is important 
for many farmers who perhaps might more properly be classified 
as part-time farmers. The forestry labor force?, numbering about 
200,000, is comprised almost completely of part-time farmers. 
About 18 million fishermen on the inland rivers, lakes, and ponds 
likewise are part-time farmers. 
Only 20 to 25 percent of total employment is in non-
farm work, a small part of which (not over 4 million to 5 million 
workers) is absorbed in modern industry. Table'3 gives an 
estimated division by industrial categories of the numbers of 
laborers in modern industry in 1950-51..

The urban population of China -- besides that part 
dependent on modern industry -- consists of families dependent 
for their livelihood on old-style industry (shops without 
power machinery and employing lees than 30 workers), handicrafts, 
wholesale and retail distribution, construction, native transpor-
tation, trades, commerce, coolie labor, government administra-
tion and services, office work, schools, and the professions. The 
labor force of these groups is estimated at 30 million to 35 
million. 24/ The distribution of urban population in city 
groups is set forth in Table 4.

The figure of 61 million for the total urban population of China 
may be compared with a similar total for the US of 63 million. 
The urban population of China, which is already large in relation 
to industrial employment, indicates a serious condition of un-
employment or underemployment among city dwellers. At least it 
represents a characteristically low productivity per. worker which. 
the industrialization plan would seek to improve by mechanization. 
The Communist policy of eliminating a considerable portion of 
private trade and service employment has probably contributed to 
urban .unemployment to an extent not fully compensated by increased 
employment in government 'service. Industrialization would also ? 
displace many more workers now employed in small-scale and handi-
craft industries.

The modern industry sector of the Chinese economy 
presently includes only from 8 to 10 percent of the total poten-
tial urban labor force. The urban population thus contains a 
potential labor force sufficient -- at least in numbers of workers 
to support an industrial development of considerably greater 
magnitude than the current program. 
Table 5* shows different stages of industrial develop-
ment reflected in the occupational distribution of the population 
in various countries. It will be seen that the process of indus-
trialization does not simply involve the absorption by industry of 
part of the agricultural population. The most important fact to 
be observed is that, as the portion of the population engaged in 
industry increases, so also does the percentage of all the other 
major occupational groups except agriculture. ? In particular, the 
part of the population engaged in commerce and transportation in-
creases along with that in manufacturing. It is probable that at 
the end of the Five Year Plan, in '1957, the distribution of popu-
lation in the labor force in Communist China will not differ 
greatly from the present, because of the limited capacity of the 
nonagricultural sector, to absorb the unemployed-and underemployed 
labor in the cities and to provide, for the growth of population, 
much less to absorb- any considerable part of the surplus agrarian 
labor force. 
Accurate quantitative data on the supply of skilled 
and technical personnel are lacking, but the rough estimates which 
are presented in Table 6** indicate that skilled labor is as 
scarce as common labor is abundant. There is a fair supply of 
foreign-trained Chinese in a few categories of top-level engineers 
and scientists. In fields needed for the development of heavy 
industry, the supply of top-level personnel is short, and in all 
industrial fields the supply of middle-grade technicians and skilled 
supervisory personnel is wholly inadequate for the proposed ex-
pansion of industry outlined in the Five Year Plan. In the most 
industrialized area, Manchuria, skilled and supervisory personnel 
was provided for the most part by the Japanese. Repatriation of 
the Japanese, a great many of whom were in responsible positions 
in manufacturing, mining, or transportation, left a large gap which 
has been only partially filled by Soviet nationals and by migration

from other parts of China. Next to the demographic problem and 
the related capital scarcity, the most serious problem of Communist 
China in. carrying through its first Five Year 'Plan will be to 
provide the necessary numbers of managerial, skilled, and technical 
personnel for its industries and.for government administration. 
C. Status of Education and Technical Training. 
The Chinese. Communists have inherited four basic problems 
in the educational system of China: lack of facilities, high 
degree of illiteracy (80 percent), the traditional preference of 
students in China for cultural education rather than practical 
training, and the complicatea system of writing in ideographic 
symbols. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
in Peiping, facing these problems (among others) in September 
1949, set forth the state policy toward education in the cultural 
ana educational section of the Common Program* adopted at that 
time. The two avticles in the Common Program dealing most specif-
ically with education are as follows:. 29/ 
Article 46: The method of education of the People's 
Republic of China is the unity of theory and practice. 
The People's Government shall reform the old education 
system, subject matter and teaching method systemati-
cally according to plan. 
Article 47: In order to meet the widespread needs of 
revolutionary work and national construction work, 
universal education shall be carried out, middle and 
higher education shall be strengthened, technical 
education shall be stressed, the education of workers 
during their spare time and education of cadres who 
are at their posts shall be strengthened, and revolu-
tionary political education shall be accorded to 
young intellectuals and old style intellectuals in 
a planned and systematic manner. 
* The Common Program expressed the policies and concepts which would
guide the government until the People's Congress, which was to be 
called in 1953, could adopt a constitution.

Under this general directive the Ministry of Education 
opened a drive against illiteracy. A system of adult classes and 
schools for workers was inaugurated in which condensed or accele-
rated courses are taught. Using a simplified method of alphabetic 
script to facilitate learning the Chinese characters, winter 
literacy bchools for adults were opened; courses and teaching 
methods were siMplified; and on-the-job, part-time, and shOrt 
courses of technical training for workers were established. In 
further implementation of the directive the Chinese Educational 
Workers' Handbook divided the formal school curriculum into 6 years 
of primary school, 6 years of middle school (junior and senior 
high school), and 4 years Of higher education. Under the previous 
system in China, the majority of rural sbhools comprised only the 
first four grades. Thus the expected substantial expansion of 
middle school and higher educational enrollment must-await develop-
ment of the upper primary grades. It is believed, therefore, that 
at least 5 years will 1;le required to provide sufficient primary 
and middle school graduates for the projected increase of enroll-
ment in higher educational institutions. Enrollments for 1951-52, 
as announced by the Minister of Education, 30/ were 49 million 
primary school students, '3 million middle school students, and 
219,000 students in higher educational institutions. 
Chinese students have been traditionally unwilling to enter 
training-for vocations as engineering and technical specialists. As 
late as 1937 there were three classical students to each student in 
science. Subsequent strenuous efforts by the Nationalists to re-
dress this balance resulted in practically equalizing the, two groups. 
The Communists have gone much further under the Ministry of Higher 
Education in drastically reorganizing universities and colleges 
along more specialized lines, with particular emphasis on engineering. 
Table 7* shows the distribution of enrollment in 194-6--I-7, by 
specialized curricula, under the Nationalists as compared with that of 
the new registrants in 1952. In order to enforce further specialization 
of students in subjects needed for the reconstruction of the economy, 
the Chinese Communists have completely eliminated private control 
of the educational process and as far as possible have replaced 
professors of Western leanings with trusted Communists. Those' 
removed consisted of a nucleus' of well-trained professors, Western-
trained Chinese for the Most part, and a number of Western nationals.

There were 215 higher institutions in China in 1948 --
55 universities, 79 independent colleges, and 81 technical 
institutes. 32/ The Chinese Communists claim that the total of 
higher institutions in 1951 was 251. Most of the increase probably 
is accounted for by the founding of new technical institutions and 
teacher-training colleges and by the subdivision of previously 
existing higher educational institutions. 33/ The teaching pro-
fession has been assigned top priority (jointly with construction, 
activity) in the job allocations of graduates. The announced 
plan provides for an increase .of the number of teacher-training 
institutions by 2i times in the next few years. In view of the 
removal of the Western-trained professors and the withdrawal 
of the Nationalist teaching staffs, the contemplated expansion 
in science and engineering courses would appear to be too

rapid for the available supply of competent professors if quality 
of instruction is to be maintained. This limitation is especially 
noteworthy in view of the fact that the same skills are sorely 
needed for the expansion of industry. 
The official Chinese Communist forecast of personnel 
requirements for national economic construction during the ensuing 
5 or 6 years was announced in late 1951. The annual requirements 
are approximately 100,000 technicians, 300,000 teachers, 40,000 
medical and nursing personnel, and at least 150,000 workers in 
government and commerce.' If the enrollment claim of 3 million 
middle school students is accepted as accurate, it is evident ,that 
the output of vocational graduates is still considerably below the 
requirements. To these must be added 80,000 to 100,000 middle school 
graduates who are needed to enter higher training, making a total 
required middle school output of nearly 700,000 annually. Since the 
total enrollment is spread over 6 years and since some attrition 
occurs in the progress to higher levels, little more than one-tenth 
of the 3 million middle school students, or 300,000 per year, can 
complete the full middle school Course. Total enrollment in higher 
institutions is now in the neighborhood of 220,000 students,. with 
an annual graduation of 16,000 to 20,000. These rates of graduation 
-axe less than one-half the rates necessary to supply the 150,000 to 
200,000 "high level" technicians, teachers, and medical personnel 
estimated by the Chinese Communists as required for the economic 
development program each year for the next 5 years. The graduation 
rate could be measurably increased only at the sacrifice of quality, 
by advancing graduation and by further relaxing standards to reduce 
the number who drop out before graduation. Deficiencies in general 
technical training and the lowering of academic standards, however, 
will have an adverse effect on efforts to train personnel for higher 
professional and administrative grades. Simultaneously, extreme 
specialization will make for occupational immobility of?labor and 
tend to increase rigidity in the economic structure. 
The shortage of qualified personnel emerges as one of the 
most serious weaknesses of the Chinese Communist program for develop-
ment of heavy industries under the first Five Year Plan. Communist 
authorities, in reviewing the first 6 months' progress of this plan, 
revealed their displeasure with' the bungling of their poorly trained 
technicians and executives. The Peiping People's Daily, while 
stoutly defending the plans and goals set by the government, lashed 
out at administrative and labor organizations for the following

technical and administrative mistakes: "Many factories failed in their 
first half year program because of disorder in enterprise control and 
unstabilized method of promoting production; failure to effect proper 
use of workers' creative ability and working character, causing poor 
discipline among workers and thereby seriously injuring production 
programs; failure in the taslc of reinforcing political consciousness 
in enterprises." Another commentary stated: "Disorder is a direct 
result of the serious phenomenon of absence of responsible men in 
factories." 34/ 
Thus it seems evident that the existing higher educational 
system in Communist China, even with the sending of many Chinese 
students to the USSR for technical studies and with the presence of 
Soviet teachers and educational advisers in China, is inadequate as 
yet to overcome serious shortages of various grades of skilled per-
sonnel. In view of the rapid rate of planned industrial growth 
over the next 4 years, these shortages will probably not be pro-
portionately reduced. 
D. Soviet Technical Aid. 
The systematic elimination of Japanese and Western nationals, 
from the mainland economy has left the Chinese Communists more and 
more dependent on the USSR for technical assistance to compensate 
for their own lack ,of trained personnel. Communist China has 
recently acknowledged substantial present and prospective assistance 
from the USSR in the renovation and construction of 141 "large" 
projects. The announcements from both the Soviet and the Chinese 
sides indicate that in each case where Soviet engineering assistance 
or equipment is used, the aid envisions the assignment of Soviet, 
personnel who are to remain to see the project through to completion 
and into the operating stage of the plant, at which time trained 
Chinese personnel can take over. 
No reliable totals are available on the number of Soviet 
nationals assigned to Communist China. Nor is it possible to 
indicate the extent tb which Soviet technical missions have replaced 
Japanese personnel and former Nationalist technicians. Soviet tech-
nical assistance may have fluctuated considerably, for the Chinese 
press contains expressions of thanks to numbers of teams who have 
returned after completing their missions. 35/ 
an estimated 70,000 Soviet military personnel and 
technicians arrived in China in the spring of 1950.

appears that during 1950 and 1951 advisers and technicians on rail-
way maintenance and operations, military construction, and military 
end items production predominated. During 1952 and 1953, more 
emphasis was placed on economic planning and on other technical 
capacities discUssed below. The general nature of the assignments 
of Soviet personnel in Communist China in 1952 may be inferred from 
a Japanese broadcast based on information from Japanese repatriates, 
whose accuracy as to numbers, however, cannot be verified. 36/ The 
numbers given were as follows: Army, 12,000; Air Force, 4,000; 
Navy, 3,000; "political," 5,000; industry and communications, 10,000; 
educational, 2,000; agricultural, 2,000; and financial and economic, 
2,000. 37/ Table 8 contains a summary of available information   50X1 
concerning the advisory and technical capacities 5UX1 
of some 600 Soviet technical nonmilitary personnel. They are pre-
sumed to Ile a representative sample of an unknown total of such 
personnel assigned to China. This is probably the best available 
indiction of the mutual Sino-Soviet interest in fulfilling the 
relative needs of Communist China in these categories.

It should be noted that the relative percentages of technicians in

influence in the economic planning and development of Communist 
China. Some categories of technicians, such as those in the "Defense, 
Finance, Economics, and Geology Advisers" and the "Architecture" 
categories, for example, may have muctl greater influence in the 
over-all planning and direction of the-5-year development program

advisers in the "Coal," "Chemical," and "Electric Power" industries 
may have much greater influence in increasing production than those

Table 8 gives merely an indication of the relative numbers 
of Soviet personnel in various categories assigned to Communist 
China. In this ranking it is important to note especially the per-
centages of personnel assigned in the first 5 categorieq, which 
include more than 60.percent of the total sample. It is apparent 
from these percentages that the numerical ranking of Soviet tech-
nicians assigned to China emphasizes (in this order) Soviet and 
Chinese Communist interests in the fields of Sino-Soviet trade 
development; development of the Soviet type of education in Com-
munist China; increase of production in the extractive industries 
of Communist China; improvement of the health, welfare, and demo-
graphic control services of Communist China; and the exchange of 
information between Communist China and the USSR. 
Aside from the matter of numbers of technicians, several 
general conclusions can be drawn from available information on 
the course of developments in Communist.China as to the nature and 
importance of Soviet technical aid to Communist China: 
1. A form of the Soviet system of economic planning and 
control is being imported into Communist China and is in process 
of application in the national economy. This form prescribes 
detailed statistical reporting of production facilities and output 
in all fields of economic activity; centralized allocation of 
certain basic raw materials, semimanufactured goods, machine tool 
equipment, electric power, and transportation services; centralized 
planning and control over foreign trade; and over-all economic 
planning which attempts to take into account the scheduled needs 
and requirements of the various sectors and branches of the economy. 
The Chinese Communists themselves admit their dependence upon 
Soviet advisers and experience in the planning and execution of 
their economic development program. 
. 2. Soviet technical aid to Communist China takes many 
forms in actual application: dominating control by the Russians in 
the industries and government of the Dairen-Port Arthur area; joint 
participation of the two parties in joint?stock companies under 
Soviet administrative control in air transport services and in 
mineral and petroleum development companies in Sinkiang; Chinese 
administration with Soviet subordinate directors in the economic 
enterprises of Manchuria; Soviet engineering project supervision 
and initial operational control in construction projects undertaken 
under the Five Year Plan; a teacher-pupil advisory relationship in

over-all economic planning and detailed execution of parts of the 
plan; procurement and sales relationships in international trade; 
and a creditor-debtor relationship between the USSR and Communist 
China in Soviet financing of Chinese Communist economic 'development. 
All of these relationships are mattersof mutual agreement and give-
and-take. 
3. The trend of Soviet technical aid is toward greater 
control over Chinese investment. The Chinese Communist Five Year 
Plan, beginning from a year of "basic construction" in 1953, with 
production goals for each industry and sector, has been integrated 
to a certain degree with the Soviet Five Year Plan, with the USSR 
supplying the technical aid and scheduling the production of equip-
ment for 141 "large" renovation and construction projects, and 
with Soviet training of Chinese personnel to take over operation of 
the enterprises after an initial period of Soviet direction. The 
USSR has taken over for Communist China many procurement and trade 
services and the clearing of some foreign exchange transactions 
with the SovietBloc. 
4. Both ideologically and through the Party 'apparatus, the 
Soviet-Chinese Communist relationship takes the form of a partner-
ship, with the USSR in the senior position. This relationship 
involves Chinese Communist amalgamation, economic and politidal, 
with the Soviet Bloc, both by reason of Chinese Communist desires for 
integration with the international Communist order, with the con-
sequent prestige which is associated with the leading position of Com-
munist China in Asia, and by reason of the economic backwardness of 
Communist China and its desire to obtain more and more Soviet tech-
nical assistance and equipment to support its development, both 
military and industrial. In this sense, Soviet technical personnel 
are officially welcomed in Communist China as members of the 
international Communist fraternity, kindred spirits in the enter-
prise to extend Communist world domination. 
5. Thus Soviet technical aid to Communist China is one of 
the means of implementing the separate aims of the USSR and Com-
munist China, as well as their mutual aim of demonstrating to the 
.rest of Asia the effectiveness of the Soviet system and the advan-
tage of association with the Soviet Bloc.

II. Administration and Planning. 
A. Administrative Framework. 
In the Chinese Communist constitutional structure the highest 
organ of state power is to be an All-China People's Congress, chosen 
by the elective process with universal suffrage -- as the Communists 
understand these terms.. This body was to be called into being in 
1953.* Until itis established, the Chinese People's Political Con-
sultative Conference (CPPCC), which approved the Common Program in 
.September 1949, has the title to supreme authority. The CPPCC meets 
only once in 3 years and will act only in an advisory capacity after 
the establishment of the All-China People's Congress. A National 
Committee which meets semiannually is authorized to act for the CPPCC, 
but the real power lies with the Chinese People's Government Council 
(CPGC), which is scheduled to meet every 2 months and which is anal-
ogous to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in the USSR. This 
council consists of a chairman, 6 vice-chairmen, and 56 members, all 
elected by the CPPCC. It includes most of the ranking members of 
the Chinese Communist Party. Under the CPGC.are four subsidiary 
organs (see Figure 1**): * (1) the Government Administrative Council, 
which has the functions of implementing policy directives, directing 
subordinate cOmmittees and ministries, and supervising regional 
governments; (2) the People's Revolutionary Military Council, which 
directs the armed forces; (3) the Supreme People's Court, which is the 
highest judicial organ; and (4) the People's Procurator-General's 
Office, which is responsible for enforcing government laws and' 
regulations. 
Under the Government Administrative Council; which is com-
parable to the Soviet Council of Ministers, is the Committee of Finance 
and Economics (CFE), which is presently the senior organ for admin-
istering the economy. In late 1952 the Central Planning Bureau was 
replaced by a high-level State Planning Committee, which is composed 
of 5 leading Communists concurrently holding key positions in the 
other administrative agencies. A State Statistical Bureau has also 
been set up as part of a general reorganization for implementation 
of the Five Year Plan. These new organs are apparently centralized 
coordinating agencies for enforcing uniform reporting of production

sible that the CFE may be superseded by these organs.

Under the CFE come- the Economic Ministries listed in Figure 1. 
In late 1952, 2 ministries of Machine Industry were set up;. a Ministry 
of Trade was replaced by a Ministry of Foreign Trade and one of Com-
merce (domestic trade); and a Ministry of Food was established in 
addition to the 3 Ministries of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Con-
servancy. Also, a Ministry of Construction Engineering and a Ministry 
of Geology were set up. 
Six administrative regions were established by the central 
government: the Northeast (Manchuria), North, East, Central-South, 
Southwest, and Northwest. In addition, an Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region and a Tibetan Autonomous Region were established, and a certain 
degree of autonomy within the regions was given to smaller minority 
groups. In each of the administrative regions there are military 
committees and administrative committees. Under the adminietrative 
regions are the provinces and also municipalities which are independ-
ent of the provincial governments. 
In late 1952 a reorganization set out to combine the adminis-
trative and military committees into single regional committees. The 
general result was to strengthen administrative control of the central 
government by minimizing the role of regional governments, increasing 
the direct administrative authority of the central government over 
the provinces and municipalities, and giving the central ministries 
greater local responsibility. The provinces in turn are divided into 
hsien, or counties. 
Parallel with the administrative hierarchy is the administra-
tive structure of the Communist Party itself, organized on the prin-
ciple of "democratic centralism." The role of the party as "the 
leader of the revolution" is reinforced by the dual membership of 
Communists in the Communist Party hierarchy and in the consitutional 
structure. All Politburo members in the top echelons are senior 
Communists with party membership running back 20 to 25 years and, al-
most without exception, predating the "long march" of the mid-1930's. 
With the exception of Po 1-Po, the former Minister of Finance, no 
officials of note have been purged. There is no firm evidence of 
significant factional splits which Mao Tse-tung has been unable to 
control. 38/ The multiparty front and the five-sector class society 
function in a practical way only to provide the focus for issues of 
Communist class warfare through which certain groups are progressively 
expropriated, liquidated, exploited, or impoverished for the benefit 
of the state's capital accumulation program. The secret police 
function for the same purposes as elsewhere in the Soviet Bloc.

During the period from 1949 to 1952 the Communists consoli-
dated their power under a smokescreen of educational and propaganda 
campaigns. The "Agrarian Reform" movement was one of thepe cam-
paigns. The "Resist America and aid Korea" movement and the 
"Counter-revolutionaries Suppression" movement were accompanied by 
more systematic_ police control over all parts of the society and 
the elimination or "re-education" of individuals and groups that had 
had close ties with the West. The "Increase Production, Practice 
Economy" movement and its predecessor, the "Three-Anti's and Five-
Anti's" movement, were part of the process of establishing tighter 
inspection controls over managers and accounting departments of all 
firms and of enforcement of capital levies and heavy tax schedules 
required for military and economic mobilization. A continuing 
Marxist indoctrination campaign and a "culture" campaign at one and 
the same tiwe establish tighter control over warkers, the educational 
system, and the arts and glorify Soviet regimentation over Western 
"imperialism." 
Huge numbers of associations have been set up on every con-
ceivable basis from pseudopolitical parties to international-friend-
ship associations, such as the Sino-Soviet and the Sino-Indian 
Friendship Associations. Semiofficial organizations like the trade 
unions, various professional associations, and the All-China Feder-
ation of Industry and Commerce for local business groups also are 
channels for Communist regimentation of Chinese society. 
B. Economic Planning and Implementation of Plans. 
Once a ComMunist regime has established its political 
security by means of the Party apparatus, the regional military 
commands, the police system, the cadre corps, and the civil admin-
lstrative organization, its first concern is to gain control of all 
economic resources and to organize the manpower to exploit these re-
sources to the end that all. economic activity is directed toward 
ac,..waulation of capital under the control of the state for investment 
in heavy industry, military end items, and (to a lesser extent) con-
sumption goods industries. In the relatively short period they have 
been in power, the Chinese Communists have made considerable progress 
toward complete control of economic activities. 
Under compulsion of their ideology, as well as of their own 
technical inadequacy and inexperience, the Chinese Communists have. 
resorted to the USSR as a model of economic organization in the same

way that they have sought the advice of Soviet technicians in steel 
mill operations and have emulated Soviet organizational techniques in 
the Party and government. Probably the most important export of the 
USSR to Communist China is a complete system of economic organization 
comprising techniques for political and social regimentation, for 
the planned development and allocation of resources, and for control 
over the population and labor force. 
Within the framework of the organization described in the 
preceding section, the State Planning Committee and the State Statis-
tical Bureau function to make precise estimates of direct investment 
requirements and of indirect investment effects. These estimates must 
be internally consistent in maintaining a proper proportion among the 
major components of each: for example, within the industrial sector 
among coal, steel, electric energy, and so on. Estimates of capital 
equipment requirements must be realistic in relation to available 
supplies. The planners must then allocate capital goods to the indi-
vidual producers In accordance with their current and future production 
goals. Material inputs for semifinished goods and end items must be 
estimated by the Committee, and flow schedules of raw materials and 
semifinished goods must be constructed which will insure that each 
producer is allocated, and receives, sufficient inputs to maintain his 
production schedule, but no more. Efficient operation of such an 
economy requires great refinement of technique, balanced judgment, 
knowlege, experience, and centraliied control by the responsible 
planners. With its long experience the Soviet planning apparatus 
still appears to suffer from inherent shortcomings; many of its more 
refined methods are no more than 5 to 7 years old. It is indeed a 
tremendous taskfor the Chinese -- even with Soviet help -- to create 
an apparatus, train cadres, and operate an allocational economy in 
a society that has not realized close political unification for 
decades and is economically fragmented to a degree not experienced in 
most Western countries for two centuries. 
The central planning and administrative organs require a vast 
and continuous flow of statistical information from the field. De-
tailed, timely statistical data fed to the central organs from the 
field provide the raw material from which over-all plans can be con-
structed and allocations of resources for investment and consumption 
can be made. Such detailed reporting of all categories of agricul-
tural and industrial assets and production must be regularly scheduled 
and submitted by due dates so that the central organs can formulate 
general plans and can check and revise sectional plans submitted by 
industries and by provincial and regional administrations.

The Ministries listed in Figure 1* are the channels through 
which reports are submitted to the central statistical and planning 
organs and through which administrative control is exercised. Im-
mediately superior to the ministerial structure is the Committee on 
Finance and Economics (CFE), which is charged with budget adminis-
tration and with supervision and coordination of the economics 
ministries, and which reports directly to the Government. Adminis-
trative Council. In 1952-53, three important changes occurred: 
(1) a central State Statistical Bureau (attached for the time being 
to the CFE), was formed, charged with collecting all statistics for 
the use of central organs and with coordinating and supervising 
statistical work on all levels; (2) the' Government Administrative 
Council incorporated an important new staff in the form of the State 
Planning Committee .(replacing the old Planning Bureau of the Com-
mittee on Finance and Economics); and (3) the regional administra-
tions lost a great deal of their autonomy to the central government 
organs. It was particularly significant that the previously pio-
neering Northeast Administration became the prototype for the over-all 
planning and control administrations. Kao Kang, its former head 
and apparently a rising star in the Communist hierarchy, moved up to 
head the Planning Committee.** 
Revising the previous system of conflicting, too numerous, 
over-complicated, and detailed forms which had previously handicapped 
the planning system under the Committee on Finance and Economics, the 
new State Statistical Bureau on 7 September 1953 promulgated a direc-
tive reforming the reporting system. 4o/ A strictly coordinated and 
centralized statistical system was adopted, as ordered in the direc-
tive establishing the Bureau. 41/ On 2 October 1953 the Statistical 
Bureau released its first communique on economic development, which 
covered the year 1952. This communique illustrates one of the dif-
ficulties faced by the Bureau and the Planning Committee in their 
over-all planning -- namely, that the relative proportions of private 
to state industry are still rather large, 42/ private industry being 
still responsible for about 42 percent of the total value of in-
dustrial output in 1952. 
* Following p. 44, below. 
** In line with Soviet experience, it is possible that in the near 
future the CBE will be abolished and its functions taken over by the 
Administrative Council and its staff, the Planning Committee, to 
which the Statistical Bureau will then be attached or moved up as a 
separate staff to the Council. 39/

The most recent statements on the subject indicate that the 
regime is about to follow in the footsteps of the USSR after it 
abandoned the New Economic Policy in the late 1920's. The general 
policy to be pursued is one of limiting consumption to secure greater 
output of producer goods and to increase exports of agricultural 
products. This policy in turn requires tightened controls over private 
industry and its gradual absorption. Popular resentment against the 
government for the suffering caused by this policy will be minimized 
by placing the blame on private traders and private businessmen. On ' 
27 October 1953, Li Wei-han, Vice Chairman of the-Government Adminis-
tration Council, made what appears to be a major policy statement to 
a plenary session of the All-China Federation of Industrial and Com-
mercial Circles, an organization representing private industrialists 
and traders. The Major points of IAJs speech may be summarized as 
follows /IV: 
That China is in the stage of "gradual transition to Social-
ism"; that the state has adopted a policy of "utilization, re-
striction, and reconstruction toward private industrial and 
commercial enterprises," which still constitute an important 
segment of the economy; 
That, having encouraged and-assisted the private enter-
prises to develop into a system of state capitalism, the 
state will continue and intensify this policy so that the 
state capitalist enterprises will gradually be transferred 
into Socialist enterprises; and 
That the principal oldjedtives are greater production, 
efficiency, and better integration of the private sector 
with state plans. 
It is impossible to eStimate precisely how far the government's policy 
of absorbing private industry will have proceeded by the end of 1957. 
Several other important defects existpd in the economic plan-
ning and allocational system. National economic plans, particularly 
construction plans, were primarily compilations of projects sent up 
from below. These were often overambitious, ill-conceived in design, 
oblivious of the availability of requisite raw materials and capital 
equipment, and so unrealistic and mutually inconsistent that the 
central organs could not readily revamp them in proper proportions 
without having more precise, detailed information at hand. In the 
Spring of 1953 it was found necessary, after checking the individual 
projects sent up from below, to cut b'ack the over-all capital

construction about 30 percent. The 1953 goal for electric power, 
which originally called for an increase of 27 percent over 1952, was 
reduced to approximately 18 percent. 44/ For machine tools the 
original goal of an increase of 34 percent in 1953 over /952 was re-
vised downward to an increase of only 4.6 percent. 45/ The more 
precise and detailed reporting system established under the State 
Planning Committee and State Statistical Bureau is designed to elim-
inate these planning defects. 
Raving passed through the state of reconstruction of exist-
ing plans, and having established the framework for detailed statis-
tical reporting and planning, the allocational economy of the Chinese 
Communists reached a new stage in August 1953 with the announcement of 
a more detailed type of over-all economic development plan. This 
consisted of the building and reconstruction of 91 new entei-prises and 
the installation of equipment for 50 enterprises already in existence, 
for which the USSR was to provide technicians and equipment) project 
supervision, training for Chinese cadres, and management through the 
stage of initial operation. In describing the progress of Chinese 
Communist economic development to date and Soviet assistance in the 
projected Five Year Plan) a Pravda article of 28 September 1953 
stated: 
"The scope of the tasks for the first Five Year Plan 
may be described by the fact that in 1953 alone recon-
struction and building is scheduled for 21 Metallurgical 
and chemical plants, 24 large machine building plants, 
24 thermal and hydroelectric stations and railroad lines 
with an overall distance of more than 600 kilometers. 
"The objective of the recently signed Soviet-Chinese 
Agreement is to render economic and technical assistance 
to China in fulfilling the first Five Year Plan. It ghe 
agreement/ anticipates the fulfillment by the S.U. of pro-
jected plans and the supply of equipment for the building 
and reconstruction of 91 new enterprises, and the equip-
ment for 50 enterprises now in existence, as well as other 
types of technical aid ... . /he Plan includes projects 
in the fields of iron and steel and nonferrous metallurgy, 
coal mining) oil production and refining, hydroelectric

and thermal power, conservancy, machine-building (auto-
mobiles, tractors, ball bearings, blast furnaces, rol-
ling mills, turbines, generators, lathes, mining equip-
ment), chemical and synthetic rubber factories, and 
pharmaceutical production.7 ... Aside from the ful-
fillment of projected work and the supply of machinery 
with Soviet organization, China will be given technical 
aid in construction, the assembly of equipment, and 
expansion in operation. 
"In the process of setting up national cadres for 
the building and operation of new enterprises, by re-
quest of the governments of the People's Republic of 
China and of the Soviet Union, a considerable number 
of Soviet specialists will be dispatched to China. 
Many Chinese workers and technical engineers will study 
the production practices in Soviet enterprises." 
In summarizing the progress to date of the Chinese Communists 
in economic planning and the implementation thereof, it may be said 
that their broad policy aims are the same as Soviet aims. The three 
most important over-all objectives of Communist China are these: 
self-sufficiency, military preparedness, and industrialization. There 
are also regional policies stressing development of the Northeast 
(Manchuria) and the Northwest. 
Plans for heavy industry give emphasis to technical training 
in the educational system and in industry, increased geological ex-
ploration to discover additional natural resources, employment of 
unskilled manpower wherever possible (as in investment in the trans-
portation sector), and Soviet technical and material assistance. 
Resources are to.be diverted from the agricultural and consumer goods 
industries to heavy industry through direct allocation of scarce 
resources and through fiscal and price policies. 
The fiscal measures to be used were described at length by 
Kao Kang in a speech commemorating the third anniversary of the 
founding of the Communist regime. Accumulation of capital is to 
come from three sources: profits and special capital replacement 
funds from the income of industry, taxation, and savings deposits of 
the people. Profits are to be channeled from light industry and 
textiles and from internal trade to heavy industry. International

trade also is controlled to push the exchange of consumer goods for 
those commodities required in the industrializing of the country. In 
addition, savings deposits have been promoted to drain off consumer 
purchasing power into investment expenditures. 
C.. Soviet Influence in Chinese Communist Economic Planning 
and Development. 
The extent of Soviet aid to Communist China is clearly a 
key element of the development program. Aside from their membership 
in the international Communist party, which looks to the Kremlin for 
leadership, the Chinese Communists seem to have taken the Soviet 
system as their working model and their blueprint for the future. 
There is little concrete evidence as to the degree to which Soviet 
influence -- other than ideological.-- is decisive at the policy-
determining level of the Chinese Communist Government Administrative 
Council. The Soviet relationship to the Chinese Communists appears 
to be generally advisory, or teacher-pupil, in nature. Soviet tech-
nicians exercise considerable influence over Chinese Communist 
economic planning at both the national and industry levels. The 
Chinese cadres, managers, and others directing economic activities 
are continually urged to take full advantage of Russian "advanced" 
technology and greater experience. Manchuria and Sinkiang are the 
regions where the USSR exercises the greatest direct control over the 
economy. In general, however, it is. certain that Soviet control 
over the Chinese Communists, is not so direct as Soviet militarycon-
trol of the European Satellites. The extent to which the USSR is 
willing to give the Chinese Communists important assistance in their 
investment program probably depends on Soviet confidence in the loy-
alty of Communist China to the direction of the Kremlin in inter-
national relations.. Soviet influence is probably most effectively 
exerted through the dependence of Communist China on Soviet military 
and technical aid and equipment to implement its rise in political 
power and prestige. This means that the administrative integration 
of oommunist China with the Soviet Bloc will undoubtedly increase 
in proportion to the amount of Soviet aid eXtended, because, as 
the investment program of the Chinese Communists develops, their own 
technical requirements will necessitate their continued dependence 
on Soviet technical aid. Hence, the connection between Communist 
China and the USSR probably will become closer during the period of 
this estimate, in economic planning, in the interchange of Chinese

agricultural and raw materials for Soviet industrial and military 
equipment, in Soviet technical aid and supervisory instruction to 
Chinese industrial and military establishments, and in the exten-
sion of the Soviet system of economic organization within the 
Chinese economy. On the other hand, Chinese Communist economic 
capabilities for independent action will increase in proportion to 
the growth of Chinese heavy industry. The eventual aims of the 
Chinese Communist ruling hierarchy, like those of their Soviet 
prototypes, remain the achievement of industrialization, military 
preparedness, and national self-sufficiency. The inconsistency of 
the Chinese Communists' aim of self-sufficiency with their present 
dependence on Soviet aid constitutes a possible source of resentment 
or friction between the two regimes during the period of this esti-
mate.

III. Functional Aspects of the National Economy. 
A. Financing of Economic Development. 
The process of industrialization in a backward country involves 
a radical shift in the pattern of resource allocation, reducing the pro-
portion allocated to the production of raw materials, food, and other 
consumer goods and increasing the proportion allocated to the produc-
tion of plant and equipment. If expansion can be financed by borrowing 
from abroad, the normal supply of consumer goods will stillibe avail-
able or may even increase significantly. To the extent, however, that 
industrialization cannot be financed by foreign loans, capital forma-
tion must depend on domestic savings or the use of unemployed resources. 
For rapid industrial growth, it is essential that a considerable pro-
portion of any 'increase that occurs in GNP be saved and invested in 
industry and associated services. Both the government budget and the 
banking system are instruments for carrying out this program. 
B. National Budget. 
Total figures on the budget of Communist China, for the years 
from 1950.to 1952 46/ which are given in Table 9* (and graphically 
presented in Figure 2**) show an increase in expenditures from US $3.4 
billion*** in 1950 to US $8.1 billion in 1952, the, latter being about 
one-fifth of the estimated GNP of the same year'. The budget figure 
for 1953 (also in Table 9) showed a further increase to US $11.7 bil-
lion.. Even when this figure is deflated to allow for changes in the ? 
price level, it is evident that a substantial increase has taken place. 
1. Expenditures. 
a. Military Expenditures. 
' Military expenditures in the budget of Communist China 
rose from US $1,4 billion in 1950 to US $2.5 billion in 1951 and are 
said to have dropped to US $2.1 billion in 1952,'excluding funds for 
military construction which probably were included' under investment 
expenditures. As much as One-third of total military expenditures in 
1952 may have gone for military constructions Of current expenditures 
on the armed forces, a relatively small part went for air forces and 
,naval forces (in that order), by far the greater part being allocated 
to the ground forces 47/ Expenditures of US $2-6 billion were planned 
for 1953.

Although military expenditures in absolute terms re-

expenditures devoted to the military establishment fell during the 
1950-53 period. In .1950, military expenditures were 40.7 percent of 
total expenditures; in 1951, 35.6 percent; and in 1952, 22.6 percent. 
They amounted to 22.4,percent of planned expnditures in 1953. A.

The budget figure for what is called "National Eco-
nomic Construction" shows substantial increases, the figure in 1951 
being doUble that of 1950, and that of 1952 being almost double that 
of 1951. From 1950 to 1953 the percentages of total allocations in 
this category increased from 25 percent of the total budget to almost 
45 percent. In 1953 an increase of about 40 percent over 1952 was 
planned, a rough breakdown of which is shown in Table 11.xxx*

Increases in absolute amounts of current yuan expendi-
tures for welfare, education, and propaganda from 1950 to 1953 are sub-
stantial. The percentages of total expenditures on this account also 
increased by about 30 percent from 1950 to 1953, as shown in Table 12. 
The increase represents primarily the expansion of technical training 
for inddstrial development.

d. Administrative and Other Expenditures. 
Administrative and other expenditures have increased 
in absolute amounts but not so much as expenditures for investment or 
for welfare, education, and propaganda. 
2. Revenues. 
The sharp rise in expenditures from 1950 to 1953 has in 
large part been underwritten through appretiable rises in industrial 
and commercial taxes and in profits from the socialized enterprises. 
a. Agricultural Taxes. 
The primary tax basis for Chinese Communist politi-
cal and military power in 1949 was the grain tax in kind. It is 
estimated that at that time 30 percent of the main crops were taken 
in the agricultural tax. The Minister of Finance 48/ stated that 
the 1950 tax burden of the peasants would be more than 21 percent of 
the total agricultural income in the "old liberated areas" and would 
average more than 19 percent of the total for the whole country. It 
is believed that local and provincial surtaxes, which were abOlished 
in 1952-53, were not included in this estimate. In any case, the 
tax burden on the peasants has probably been understated. 
On 16 June 1952 a directive was issued to establish 
a system of progressive rates and to eliminate local surtaxes, Which 
often exceeded the official rate of 15 percent of the regular taxes 
of the central government. The central agricultural tax is levied 
on an estimated normal yield, thus penalizing those farmers who pro-
duce below it and giving an incentive for producing over the norm. ? 
In North China, for example, the central government tax is 22 percent 
of the officially estimated normal yield, with surtaxes bringing the 
total tax up to about 25 percent of the output of taxable acreage --
that is, everything except the output of the first mou of land. The 
revenue appears to have varied in about the same proportion as 
Chinese Communist claims of increases in yields of the main crops. 
As a component of total income, however, the agricultural tax has 
sharply decreased relative to industrial and commercial taxes and 
profits of state-owned enterprises.* 
* See Table 10, p. 51, above, and Figure 3, following p. 56, below.

b. Industrial and Commercial Taxes. 
There are 11 general nonagricultural taxes in Commu-
nist China, the most important of which are the customs and salt lev-
ies, taxes on manufactures and on wholesale sales, the capital tax, 
stamp taxes, and various other excise and license taxes. Some of 
these revenues are collected and retained by the local governments, 
and some are collected by the central government and are shared by 
the two levels of government. 
The business and industrial tax system of Communist 
China is concerned both with fiscal aims and with social and politi-
cal aims, alloWing tax concessions to government enterprises and 
groups which the government wishes to build up, and discriminating 
against private commerce which it wishes to delimit or destroy. Thus 
tax rates on the middleman's profits, generally considered as unearned 
income in Communist countries, are high. On the other hand, heavy 
basic industry and iron and steel receive a tax reduction of 40 per-
cent; chemicals, a tax reduction of 30 percent; and books and station-
ery, a tax reduction of 20 percent. With respect to excise taxes, 
necessities are taxed at a lower rate than luxuries like wines and 
cigarettes, which are taxed at 28.57 percent and 55.54 percent re-
spectively. These two taxes, together with the tax on yarn at 13.04 
percent, represent more than 60 percent of the total commodity tax 
for 1950. 
c. Profits of State-Owned Enterprises. 
Profits of state-owned enterprises have increased sub-
stantially from 1950 to 1952. The increase in 1951 over 1950 was 25 
percent, and in 1952 was 52 percent over 1951. An increase of 50 per-
cent over 1952 was projected for 1953, compared with the 27-percent 
increase budgeted for revenue from industrial and commercial taxes. 
Table 13 shows the annual increase in the share of total revenues 
contributed by profits from state-owned enterprises during 1950-53.

The percentage of total revehue derived from profits 
of state enterprises has increased from 12.5 to 30 percent, whereas 
the percentages of revenue from the agricultural tax and the taxes 
on private industries and commercial enterprises have relatively 
diminished from 27.5 percent and 43 percent, respectively, in 1950 
to 11 percent and 37.5 percent in 1953.* The increase in revenue of 
state enterprises and cooperatives reflects the rapid acquisition by 
the state of, much of the economic activity in domestic and inter-
national trade and banking and a more rapid expansion of the state-
operated industriesowhich are favored by state policies. 
d. Credits, Loans, and Insurance. 
Revenues under the heading of Credits, Loans, and 
Insurance are believed to include the proceeds of bond sales to the 
public, borrowing from the People's Bank (that is, expansion of the 
currency issue), interest on loans of the People's Bank which had 
been made to other banks and government enterprises, premiums on 
government 'insurance, and possibly the credit received from the 
USSR on trade account. 
Two loan drives have been made within Communist 
China; In 1950 a bond issue of 200 million shares Was floated, each 
share to be worth enough yuan to buy a selected list of commodities. 
This drive was planned to bring in between 2.25 trillion and 
4 trillion yuan, depending on the expectations of the budget planners 
as to the average price of a "fen" unit fcir 1950. In 1951 a drive 
for funds for heavy armaments was launched to help finance the 
Korean War. It was claimed that 5,025 billion yuan were raised in 
this drive. The credit from the Soviet loan of 1950 would account 
for an average of at least 1,200 billion yuan each year from 1950 
through 1953.** 
e. Other Revenues and Balance from Prebeding Year. 
The item "Other Revenues and Balance from Pre-
ceding Year" is believed to include, besides the funds carried over 
from the preceding year, the foreign exchange profits on foreign 
trade transactions and inward remittances of overseas Chinese, book 
profits from revaluation of government assets, capital levies 
* See Table 13, p. 55, above, and Figure 3. 
** Proceeds of US $60 million per year computed at the exchange rate 
of 20,040 yuan equal US $1, in effect during 1952. The new official 
exchange rate introduced in December 1952 is 23,430 yuan equal US-$1.

against offenders in the so-called anticorruption drives, seizures 
of gold and silver bullion, and possibly the proceeds of export 
sales of opium. 
These entries probably reflect considerable juggling 
of the accounts from year to year. The campaign against tax evaders 
as part of the so-called anticorruption campaign in the first half 
of 1952 probably contributed a.substantial part of this figure by 
recovery of past taxes and collection of fines. Before this cam-
paign the government was faced with a serious budgetary crisis, which 
was surmounted by the capital levies made in the drive. The vari-
ability of the "other" revenues from year to year indicates their 
unpredictable nature resulting from improvised, extreme measures 
adopted to garner "surpluses" for the state from the victims of its 
policy of eliminating the propertied classes. 
C. Banking System. 
Toward the close of the Kuomintang period there were already 
visible trends toward the development of the four government banks 
and the diminution of the importance of the private banks. After 
the Communist government came into power, the Central Bank of China 
with its sole issuing authority and clearinghouse was renamed the 
People's Bank of China and was designated the central bank of China. 
On 3 March. 1950 the Government Administrative Council pro-
mulgated "Decisions on the Unification of State Financial and 
Economic Work," in which the People's Bank was officially appointed 
as the central organ for the control of the money supply of the 
country, and in which it was indicated that all state bank would 
set up additional branch offices to act on behalf of the national 
treasury. Up to the end of October 1951, more than 5,300 offices 
of the People's Bank were established and nearly every hsien (county) 
had access to facilities of the bank. Branches and agencies of the 
Peuple's Bank have been extended to streets, factories, schools, and 
government organs in the cities and towns and in markets in rural 
areas. 
1. Private Banks. 
Commercial banks are under the close control of the 
-People's Bank but are forced to serve the public in handling about 
40 percent of routine banking transactions on behalf of the People's 
Bank. Private banks cannot accept deposits from any government 
agency and have to submit to the People's Bank various detailed

periodic reports, including a Weekly report on all deposits and 
loans. As the examining agency, the People's Bank can investigate 
any bank at anSr time. Banking reserves, based on average weekly 
deposits; have to be maintained in the People's Bank in the amount 
of 7 percent to 15 percent for demand deposits and 3 percent to 
8 percent for time deposits. The banks also are required to keep 
a cash reserve of 10 percent against demand deposits and 5 percent 
against time deposits. 
Beginning in 1950, the People's Bank sponsored a move-
ment to consolidate individual private banks into syndicates in 
order to permit pooling of their resources, to direct thBir loan 
policies, and to participate with them in the making of industrial 
loans.* This policy resulted in the following developments: the 
establishment of five consortia of private banks; a number of 
mergers of formerly independent banks; the formation of several 
"joint" banks with participation of the People's Bank in stock 
ownership; the participation of all of these and the People's Bank 
in joint enterprises, such.as agricultural loan extension and 
investment in industrial, mining, and cooperative enterprises; the 
general use by all banks of the People's Bank's facilities for bill 
collection and check clearance; and a great reduction in the number 
of banking institutions. On the receiving side of the credit which 
became available as deposits increased were the industries, mining 
enterprises, and agricultural producer cooperatives approved by 
the government as worthy recipients of credit. The producer 
credit cooperatives have increased in number and size in parallel 
development with the centralization of the banking business. 49/ 
2. Functions of the Government Banks. 
The banks of Communist China appear to be restricted to 
the minimum functions of a banking system. There is no investment 
activity of banks in common stocks and bonds or in the sale of 
securities or commodities. The aim is mostly to assist in the 
development of the national economy by channeling capital into 
approved productive enterprises. 
The centralized clearing function is the most power-
ful device for controlling the economy. All national and local 
government organs and enterprises, military units, public schools,

hospitals, cooperatives, and other popular organizations must set 
up accounts with the local People's Bank. All transactions, whether 
local, national, or international, must be cleared through the 
People's Bank, and no direct cash payment is allowed. Duplicate 
copies of the business contracts of all government organs are 
deposited in the Bank, and funds received from and sent to the 
national treasury by all the aforementioned "units" are handled 
through the bank. No commercial credit relations such as loans, 
drafts, and advance payment for goods ordered are allowed among the 
various "units." Loans contracted for a specific purpose cannot 
be used for any other purpose. In this way the government is able 
to maintain surveillance over the activities of its agencies and 
employees, to observe the progress of its plans, and to enforce 
budgetarY allocations. 
Private enterprises are required to deposit their 
currency holdings in banks and to use the checking system more 
extensively 50/ so that the People's Bank will be able to observe 
private transactions also. 
The interest rate, another instrument of control, is 
used to force state enterprises to practice cost accounting --
by making interest an explicit cost -- and to speed the turnover 
rate of capital. It influences private business to engage in 
desired types of development, attracts individual economic 
activity toward cooperative'enterprises,and encourages savings and 
investment. With respect to savings, the interest is highest for 
fixed long-term deposits which can be utilized for industrial 
investment, and it declines as. theperiod of the deposit becomes 
shorter. As for loans, the rate of interest for heavy industry is 
lower than for light industry and lower for industry in general 
than for commerce and trade. 
In order to encourage saving on the part of the public, 
the People's Bank initially tied the value of deposits to a bundle 
of goods in order to preserve the real value in the face of rising 
prices. This measure mitigated the inflationary hoarding of goods, 
and, in June 1952, when prices became stabilized, it was discontinued. 
Another device was the "prize winning" deposit, a lottery system in. 
which depositors participated in the hope of winning one of geveral 
large prizes.

The branches of the People's Bank throughout the country 
serve not only to promote and centralize savings deposits, thus 
facilitating currency control, but also to collect taxes on behalf 
of the government. The vigor and efficiency with which this function 
has been performed apparently have aided the government greatly in 
its fiscal management. 
D. Currency, Prices, and Consumption. 
The Communists came to power in 1949 in a period of hyper-
inflation, and much of their effort has been directed toward . 
stopping inflation. Extreme shortages were lessened by e5cpansion 
of output from 1950 to 1952. Because of .inCreasing control over 
available supplies of consumer goods by state trading and coopera-
tive organizations, the government was in a position to reduce 
inflationary pressures by allocating commodities to those regions 
where there were shortages. In addition, the money supply was 
held in check by unifying the currency in the issue of the People's 
Banks, by enforcing a tight money policy, by capital levies, and by 
vigorous collection ol taxes. At the end of 1950 the average price 
index was about twice as high as that for the end of 1949, an 
appreciable price rise but less rapid than in the days of hyperin-
flation in early 1949. In 1951, prices increased only 13.7 per-
cent over the previous year, and by the end of 1952 it was claimed 
by Po 1-Po in his budget speech that wholesale prices of 52 
principal commodities in 6 important cities had fallen by 6.2 per-
cent. 
What happens to prices over the period 1953-57 will depend 
largely on the methods used to finance the industrialization pro-
gram. If a good part of investment is financed by use of the 
printing press or by bank credit, then there will be an increase 
in aggregate demand for real resources, which will be inflationary 
in effect. Taking money on deposit from individuals is generally 
counterinflationary to the extent that individuals thereby are 
influenced to refrain from bidding for goods. Securing funds by 
taxation also is counterinflationary in that the effective demand 
on the part of the public for goods and services is reduced to 
enable the government to invest more in heavy industry. 
That the Chinese Communists expect to finance their Five 
Year Plan,with its primary aim of developing heavy industry, by 
extracting sacrifices of consumption from the people is revealed

in an editorial of 30 October 1953 in the People's Daily, organ of 
the Central Committeeof the Chinese Communist Party. The editorial 
indicates that the regime is drawing on Soviet experience in the 
early 1930's, when the psm exported food to pay for its imports of 
industrial equipment, and when the industrialization program was 
pressed in spite of a crisis in agricultural production that led to 
millions of deaths from starvation. The editorial stated that the 
Soviet people "did experience shortages of agricultural products and 
consumer goods during the national industrialization period. Also, 
because of the above situation, ? a goods distribution system re-
quiring goods purchasing certificates was enforced." The Chinese 
people were informed that they "must be willing to sacrifice) to prac-
tice rigid economy in all'matters, to be economical of food, education 
expenditure, and yardage goods." .Thus forced saving by means of 
strict control of consumption through rationing, price fixing, forced 
purchases, and taxation is the method of capital accumulation by 
which the Chinese Communist Party will attempt to carry out its 
first Five Year Plan.

IV. Growth of the National Economy. 
The period from 1931 to 1952 in China was complicated by the 
series of political upheavals resulting from the Sino-Japanese war 
and the civil war that followed. Data on the Chinese economy are 
scanty at best, and economic information from 1936 to 1945 is even 
harder to get because the economy of China was under various pOlitical 
jurisdictions. In general, trends are manifested in four time-spans 
from 1931 to 1952. From 1931 to 1936, economic trends were relative-
ly homogeneous for what is now Communist China. From 1937 to 1945, 
Manchurian development proceeded rather rapidly, but the picture was 
spotty for the Japanese-occupied areas of China proper, including the 
important industrial cities, while local developments also occurred in 
the areas under the control of the Chinese Nationalist government. 
The years 1945 and 1946 were low years for economic output for all parts 
of China. From 1945 to 1949, there was a period of increasing produc-
tion in most sectors, ending in a drop resulting from the disruptions 
of civil war. In the period from 1949 to 1952, production again in-
creased, generally reaching in Manchuria the level attained under the 
Japanese from 1941 to 1946 and in China proper the level attained in 
the period from 1935 to 1938. 
Table 14* shows the production trends in principal sectors of the 
economy from 1931 to 1952. 
A. Gross National Product.** 
The over-all index for the gross national product (GNP) of 
China shows an increase of 13.3 percent in 1952 compared with 1936. 
From 1950 to 1952 the yearly increase in GNP reflected mainly restor-
ation to previous levels of production rather than new additions to 
productive capacity. In 1950, GNP was 99.2 percent of 1936. Output 
in 1951 was 6 percerit over 1950, and output in 1952 represented an 
increase of 7.7 percent over 1951. Table 15 shows the sector indexes, 
1931-52.*** These are graphically represented in Figure 4.*xxx 
* Table 14 follows on p. 64.

The growth in the government sector was the most important 
change in the economy from 1936 to 1952. The Chinese GNP in 1952, 
other than the government sector, was 106.6 percent of 1936, but when 
the government sector is included,the index is 113.3 percent. The 
large expansion in the army,'in the administrative bureaucracy, and 
in large-scale construction under the Communists accounts for the 
fact that the 1952 index for the government sector is 247.9 percent 
of 1936. 
1. Gross National Product in 1952. 
The tentatively estimated GNP of Communist China in 1952 
was 524.5 trillion yuan. Of this total, agriculture contributed by 
far the largest portion, 41.7 percent. Trade, food processing, handi-
craft, and native transportation (all being in the nature of agri-
cultural or small-scale handicraft industry) together contributed 
the next largest portion of the total, 29 percent. The modern industry 
sector (including manufacturing, minerals and metallurgy), and modern 
transportation (so classified by its use of modern motive power and 
the larger number of workers per enterprise) contributed the third
largest portion, but this was only 13.6 percent. ' The go'rernment sec-
tor, consisting of services paid for by the government. and including 
not only administrative personnel and the armed forces but also 
workers on various construction projects and teachers and students, 
constituted the only other large portion of the GNP, 10.3 percent. 
The totals for the sectors in yuan and in percentages are summarized 
in Table 16.* Figure 5** shows the contributions ,of the various 
sectors. graphically. It will be noted from these comparisons that 
agriculture is the main support of the Chinese economy and that the 
agricultural, small scale, and handicraft enterprises are still more 
important than modern industry. 
2. Comparison with US Gross National Product. 
The GNP of China and of the US in 1952 have been valued 
in both yuan and dollars to the extent permitted by the available price 
data. The ratios of output in Communist China to output in the US are 
quite different when valued in yuan from what they are when valued in 
dollars. There is a particularly great difference in the industrial 
sector. The industrial sector is of much greater importance .in the

GNP of the US than in that of China, and largely for this reason the 
ratio between the total GNP of China and that of the US in dollars is 
significantly different from the ratio in yuan. When the two GNP's are 
valued in dollars, Chinese output in 1952 is 11.2 percent o' US GNP. 
Valued in yuan, however, Chinese GNP is only 4.8 percent of US GNP. 
The geometric average of these two ratios is 7.4 percent and is con-
sidered to be the bet basie for comparing the over-all output of 
goods and services in the two countries. Using this geometric average, 
the value of the Chinese GNP is $25.5 billion at 1952 prices. 
Table 17 gives the geometric average of the ratios be-
tween Chinese output for major sectors of GNP and US output for these 
sectors. This comparison is also presented graphically in Figure 6.*

This comparison emphasizes the small share of industry and trans-
portation in the Chinese economy. The Chinese GNP is 7.4 percent of 
US GNP, but the output of Chinese industry, even when handicraft out-
put is included, is only 2.7 percent of the output of US industry. 
Transportation is only 2 percent. Agricultural output, on the other 
hand, is very nearly equal.

There is no simple relationship between the sector con-
tributions to GNP in China and in the US and the relative economic 
capabilities of the two countries. Comparative outputs of specific 
commodities of strategic significance are described below in this 
report. The ability of Communist China to support military campaigns 
in Asia is only partly dependent on large-scale industry. Neverthe-
less, this comparison of GNP's does show the relative stage of de-
velopment of Chinese Communist industry in the modern world and the 
distance the Chinese Communists' program of industrialization will - 
have to go before Communist China can be classed as an industrial 
country. 
3. Comparison with Pre-Communist Peak Production. 
The index of estimated pre-Communist composite peak pro-
duction* for the sectors of GNP other than the government sector is 
110.5 percent of 1936; the 106.6 index for 1952 is still short of the 
pre-Communist peak. 
. Table 18** compares output of the various sectors of GNP 
in 1952 with the estimated composite pre-Communist peak. The peak is 
estimated on the basis of the highest output of each of the various 
commodities in the years from 1931 to 1948. Where possible, different 
regional peaks were also taken into account to arrive at a combined 
peak. 
The failure of GNP (except for the government sector) to 
reach its pre-Communist composite peak is more than accounted for by 
the shdrtfall of agriculture and the trade, food processing, and 
handicraft sectors. Thus in the remaining portion of GNP, including 
the modern industrial sectors, the Communists have achieved by 1952 an 
increase in effective capacity over any past period." Specifically, 
modern manufacturing, iron and steel, and military end item production 
are above past peaks. ?

1. Agriculture. 
The importance of the agricultural sector in the Chinese 
Communist economy may be judged from the facts that (a) agricultural 
taxes in kind (grossly undervalued for tax purposes) contributed 
about 13.5 percent of the national budget revenues in 1952; (b) agri-
cultural product amounted to an estimated 41.7 percent of GNP in 
1952, the largest share contributed by any one sector of the economy; 
(c) the agricultural labor force (including underemployed and surplus 
labor living on the land) amounted to about 70 percent of the total 
labor force; and (d) exports of agricultural products amounted to an 
estimated 70 percent by value of total exports in 1952. It is be-
cause of this heavy dependence on agriculture -- for the livelihood 
and support of so large a share of the population, for budget revenues, 
and for exports -- that an increase of agricultural production be-
comes a primary determining factor in the ability of the regime to 
accumulate capital for investment in industry. Control of consumption

may be enforced to some extent by price-fixing, by the collection of 
taxes in kind, and by forced purchases of food products from which the 
allocation of supplies for export provides the means of exchange for 
capital imports. 
a. Production. 
By making strenuous efforts to increase production, 
to push exports, and to control consumption, the Chinese Communists 
achieved an agricultural supply situation in 1952 which permitted 
substantial exports of agricultural products. Production then repre-
sented roughly 98.3 percent of the peak of 1936. The agricultural 
supply situation of 1952, including imports and exports, is set forth 
in Table 19.* 
b. Productivity. 
Approximately. 80 percent of the 500 million popula-
tion of China cultivate 14.4 percent of the total land area of China. 51/ 
This percentage of cultivated land is based on the Communist claim of 
122 million hectares under cultivation. 52/ The area of 122 million 
hectares actually includes multiple crops so that the actual landarea 
under cultivation is less than 122 million hectares. This compares with 
an estimate of 109 million hectares (272 million acres) from independ-
ent sources. The amounts of additional land suitable for exploitation . 
for agricultural purposes is unknown. An additional area of roughly 
85 million acres classed as. "arable" undoubtedly includes grazing land 
and land that could be brought under cultivation by extensive.develop-
ment efforts. 53/ With substantial investment in irrigation facilities 
and machinery and other operating equipment, more land can undoubtedly 
be opened for agricultural purposes. However, this is an expensive as 
well as a relatively slow process. In sum, the Communists are faced

Indeed, much of the terraced land already under cultivation yields very 
low returns per man-year. -With too many people on the cultivable 
land, increased output can more readily be realized from better seeds 
and cultivation practices- and more fertilizer, -- that is, from higher' 
productivity per unit of land -- than from bringing more land into 
cultivation. Overpopulation has the attendant phenomenon of extremely 
small, fragmented farms. Before the Communist land reform program, 
Suiyuan Province in the Northwest had the largest average farm 
(11.26 acres), Kwangtung Province the smallest (only 1.94 acre); the**

mean size in China was 3.67 acres.2)2/ The average amount of cultivated 
or arable land per family of five is very low; at the Communists' popu-
lation figure of 487 million, it is only 2.7 acres.' 
In a predominantly agricultural economy, cereals form 
the bulk of the diet. An estimate of the composition of the supply of 
foodstuffs in 1952 which was recently published by the Chinese Commu-
nists gives the following percentages of gross food output for several 
commodities: rice, 41.6 percent; millet, corn, kaoliang, and potatoes, 
40.0+ percent; and wheat, 10.0+ percent.* 22/ For the major cereala, 
productivity per unit of land approximates that in the US, but the 
output per man is much lower; in China 4 workers out of 5 are required 
to provide subsistence for the population, as compared with 1 out of 
7 in the US, which also has a better balanced diet. .56/ Despite the 
very large labor inputs, productivity per unit of land hardly exceeds 
that of the postwar US. Chinese agricultural productivity reflects 
very low capital inputs, which are primarily restricted to buildings 
and land, a few hand tools, and perhaps a draft animal, all used with 
a primitive technology. Table 20** compares productivity per acre 
for wheat and rice in China with productivity in selected other calm-
tries. 
c. Agricultural Policies. 
Chinese Communist policy on the organization of 
agricultural production may be divided into three distinct stages: land 
reform, the present mixed policy .of encouraging various types'of co-
operative cultivation (but not at the expense of decreasing production), 
and the collectivization scheduled for the future. In carrying out the 
land reform program, the Chinese Communists had two objectives; to 
achieve political power and (within the limits set by that Objective) 
maintain the level of production.*** 2// For this reason the ? 
kulaks**** were not liquidated. Only the landowners were dispossessed, 
although some of the kulaks lost part of their land. The result was a

account for the remainder. In any event, this breakdown approximates 
the. relative order of magnitude. 
** Table 20 follows on ID.. 77. 
*** Land reform was carried out under the provisions of tie "Law" of 
the National Agrarian Conference of September 1947. Owing to certain 
"excesses" which it encouraged, and to confusion of "kulaks" with 
landowners and middle class peasants with kulaks, the law was replaced 
in 1950 with a law more favorable to the kulaks. East and South China 
were reformed under the 1950 law. 
**** The classification system varied from province to province, and 
was related to ownership of draft animals and implements as well as to 
land.

vast leveling process which transformed the majority of the peasants 
into "middle peasants." Reducing the average size of the plot, by 
giving the poorer and landless peasants an average-size plot, tended 
to reduce the margin between production and consumption and thus to 
inhibit capital accumulation. Substitution of more capital for 
labor by any means other than collectivization thus became more 
difficult. 
The Chinese Communists are presently attempting to 
encourage various types of cooperative production units. The first is 
the "mutual aid team," in which draft animals and implements are pooled 
for the most important field tasks. Accounts are settled after the 
harvest on a basis of "work units." Land and equipment remain pri-
vate property, and membership varies from year to year. In the second 
type -- the agricultural producer cooperatives -- land, labor, and 
equipment are pooled, and the land is cultivated jointly. Each house-
hold, however, retains a garden and/or orchard plot. It appears that 
some of the implements and draft animals are joint property and some 
are still formally private property. Division of produce is based 
upon work units, with allowances for privately owned land units and 
for jointly and privately owned tools; thus a part of the produce 
accrues to the cooperative for the purchase of more tools, seeds, and 
fertilizer. In 1952, various types of mutual aid teams reportedly 
numbered more than 8 million, while there were some 3,600 agricultural 
producer cooperatives, mainly concentrated in the northeastern 
provinces. 59/ 
During 1953, emphasis was placed on consolidating and 
strengthening existing mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' 
cooperatives. In North China, for example, some 2,600 producers' co-
operatives were changed into mutual aid teams. 60/ Recently there 
have been signs that the campaign for socialization of agriculture is 
to be stepped up. The Communists, however, assert that peasants 
should organize into groups "spontaneously" as the benefits of the 
alleged higher productivity of socialized agriculture becomes apparent. 
A broadcast from Peiping on 9 November 1953 quoted an 
editorial from the People's Dailv which exhorted the cadres to pub-
licize among the peasants the part they must play in economic construc-
tion during the period of transition to socialism:

"If the peasants do not carry out large-scale 
production; they will be unable to meet the needs of 
the nation and those of the peasants themselves, and 
will also cause difficulties for national industrial 
construction and for a portion of the peasants who are 
desirous of making a living from agricultural pro-
duction. ... If the peasants do not unite to carry out 
large-scale production, not only will it be impossible 
for the rural living standards to keep up with those 
of the cities, but owing to the inherent Weakness of 
the 'small-farmer' economy and expansion of capitalist 
fleecing, there will surely be many poverty-stricken 
peasants. ... The method of consolidation ... is 
entirely on a voluntary basis. First, ... mutual aid 
teams ... next ... agricultural producers' cooperatives 
and supply and marketing cooperatives. In the 
future, ... collective farm and supply and marketing 
cooperatives ... ." 
This report and the introduction of rationing* clearly 
.suggest that Communist China is continuing its version of a Soviet-
type program of state control of agricultural output for capital ac-
cumulation purposes, possibly involving lowering the subsistence level 
and raising the mortality rate. This evidence indicates that the 
regime is preparing to promote higher forms of collectivization and 
to increase the pressure on peasants in carrying out it- crop collec-
tion and allocation program. 
Collectivization remains the eventual goal, but the 
attainment of this goal, the Chinese Communists admit, presupposes a 
more advanced stage of industrialization to make available the neces-
sary capital equipment. It is believed likely that collectivization 
will proceed more rapidly in the Northeast, where cultivation units 
are larger and where mechanized dry land farming can be applied on 
presently uncultivated areas. Planned irrigation projects in the

Northwest and in Suiyuan and Chahar Provinces may also provide the land 
for investment of capital equipment on large-scale state-owned collec-
tive farms. The success of these collective enterprises might then 
stimulate the incentive to extend the socialization of agriculture in 
the present areas of small-unit intensive cultivation. This develop-
ment, however, depends on the completion of the irrigation projects 
and on the availability of capital equipment from imports and from 
the developing industry of Communist China. Limited progress may be 
anticipated in this effort during thes period of this estimate. In 
view of the emphasis on increasing production and the apparent resis-
tance of peasants to further stages of collectivization, however, it 
is believed unlikely that any forced major changes in agricultural 
organization will be attempted through 1957 in areas where the tra-
ditional agrarian institutions are so firmly rooted.* 
The agricultural taxation policies of the Chinese 
Communists have three basic objectives: (1) to eliminate the advantage 
of land ownership, (2) to assure tne state a large and Stable supply 
of grain, and (3) without compromising these two objectives to 
stimulate productive efforts by eliminating the capriciousness of the 
agricultural tax systeM as it existed under previous regimes. 
In 1952 in Communist China there were four basic 
systems of agricultural taxation in force. They were alike in that 
all agricultural taxes were in kind and the peasant was responsible 
for transporting the grain to the collecting point. In Manchuria 
the tax was levied as a proportion of estimated normal yield with no 
exceptions; the rate varied by province from 21 percent to 23 percent 
except in Jehol, where it was only 15 percent. 61/ In North China 
a somewhat similar system obtained: a uniform rate of 24.2 pounds 
of millet per taxable mou with an exemption of one mou per house-
hold.** 62/ Where agrarian reform had recently been carried out --
in the Central-South, East, Northwest, and Southwest areas -- a pro-
gressive system Obtained. Rates varied from 7 percent to 30 percent 
of normal yield, with an exemption of 165 pounds of grain per capita. 
In those areas where agrarian reform had not yet been carried out --
largely restricted to a,few minority areas by 1952 -- progressive 
* The conflict in Chinese Communist motives in respect to collec-
tivization is referred to under I, above. 
** A taxable mou is defined as one producing 1 picul, or 110 pounds, 
of millet. (A mou is approximately one?sixth of an acre.)

rates ranging from 3 percent to 42 percent were levied.* Sur-
taxes levied by local authorities were not to exceed 15 percent of the 
basic tax but often did so. 
In 1953, after the establishment of a tax policy of 
class differentiation in the villages of the so-called "old areas" --
where /and reform was implemented before 1950 -- the Chinese' Communists 
planned to extend the progressive tax rates. L./ All local surtaxes 
were abolished in 1952. Z./ To what degree the new rates have been 
promulgated in the old areas is not clear, but the changes in the 
land tax in 1953 in Kwangtung Province are apparently typical of rates 
which have been and are being introduced elsewhere. All households in 
which the "average annual agricultural income per capita is not over 
150 shih catties L195 pound17" of the staple foodstuff are exempt from 
the tax. Households with larger average incomes are taxed at pro-
gressive rates, ranging from 6 percent for incomes in the range. of 
151 catties to 200 catties to 25 percent for incomes of 1,451 catties  
and above. LT./ Income is calculated on the basis of the "average 
normal yield," and the cadres are strictly admonished to estimate the 
yield fairly and to permit no abuses. If yields exceed the estimate, 
the peasant is permitted to retain the surplus; the tax rates remain 
stable. On the other hand, the peasant must bear the burden of the 
normal tax on a poor harvest when this is not occasioned by a natural 
disaster. Special reductions or exemptions are promised in case of 
severe floods or other natural calamities. Table 21** sets forth 
the agricultural tax rates in Kwangtung. 
It is not clear how much of total agricultural in-
come is paid in taxes, but it was reported as 17 percent of gross 
output in the areas controlled by the Communists in 1949. The Com-
munists claim that the share of the agricultural tax in tOtal state 
income has declined since their accession to power, as shown in 
Table 22.*** By means pf this tax the government procUres an esti-
mated maximum of 30 million tons of grain for its purposes.**** 
* It is not clear whether or not any tax exemption was allowed 
on these areas. 
** Table 21 follows on pa 82. 
*** Table 22 follows on p. 83. See III, above, for relative pro-
portions of agricultural-taxes in state revenues 
xxxx An additional 10 million tons is purchased at low fixed prices 
by the state-controlled cooperatives. Total tax and obligatory sales 
of grain to the state thus constitute as much as 30 percent of total 
grain production. ?.2/

Traditionally, credit has been one of the most serious 
problems of the Chinese peasantry. Although precise figures are lack-
ing, most of the rural credit came from pawn shops and private loans,, 
always at very high interest rates. It is estimated that interest 
charges on most loans averaged 3 percent to 6 percent per month. 71/ 
The Chinese Communists have greatly expanded the role of the state 
banking system in the rural areas, and some rural credit cooperatives 
have been formed, mostly in North China. The press in Communist China 
reports that agricultural credit is more plentiful and much cheaper 
than in the past, but this assertion is doubtful in view of the 
magnitude of the need. 
Total investment in the agricultural sector is diffi-
cult to estimate because (1) a large part of total investment is made 
by the peasantry from resources which do not pass through the market 
and for which there are no statistics, and (2) the state's monetary 
outlays for major conservancy and reclamation projects are probably 
more or less limited to the food consumption of the workers and much 
corvee labor is used. Thus the data for agricultural investment con-
sist only of certain reported outlays by the state, certain known 
minimum peasant purchases, and very rough estimates of investment 
from the peasants' incomes. In any case, major changes in agricul-
tural output in the short run can result only from increased capital 
Inputs in the form of fertilizer and to a lesser extent from con-
servancy projects.

Comparison of the budgetary allocations to agricul-
ture with those to industry, transportation, and other sectors is 
possible only for 1952 and 1953 (see III, above). According to the 
communique issued by the Statistical Bureau, the share of the Min-
istries of Agriculture and Conservancy in total investment in 1952 
was 16 percent, compared to 56 percent for the six industrial minis-
tries and 28 percent for the transportation and communications 
sector.* 72/ 
A very limited amount of data is available concerning 
the introduction of Soviet-type animal-drawn field equipment and other 
types of agricultural machinery into North and Northeast China. The 
Department of Agriculture of the Northeast Administratilie Area plans 
to lend to farmers 170,000 sets of such implements in the period 
1953-57. 73/ Production of Soviet-type Implements and machinery (in-
cluding cotton gins and rice threshers) was reportedly 80,000 units in 
the Northeast in 1951, 20 percent of these being plows. Plans for 
1952 called for production of 340,000 units. 74/ Reports of sales of 
implements in China proper are numerous but usually concern only small 
areas, preventing any precise aggregation. It is believed that Man-
churia and Northwest China are the only areas Where any significant 
numbers of animal-drawn implements will be introduced in the near 
future. In the remainder of China, most of the "implements" being pro-
duced are of the hand type --.factory-made hoes, spades, rakes, and 
the like -- which are a real improvement over handmade wooden 
implements. 
It is estimated that in 1952 some 5,850,000 tons of 
oil cake were available for use as fertilizer. 75/ In addition 
400,000 tons of chemical fertilizers were applied to the land. Of 
these amounts, 2.5 million tons of oil seed and chemical fertilizers 
moved through the Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in 1952, the 
planned allocations of which to the major crops were as follows: 
rice, 32.5 percent; wheat, 17.0 percent; tobacco and industrial 
crops, 12.0 percent; and cotton, 38.5 percent. 76/ 
* It is also estimated that, if the investment made by local author-
ities were included, total investment in the agricultural sector would 
be about double that made by the Central Government. It is not known 
precisely what the Chinese Communists Include in the term which is 
rendered as "investment."

It is apparent from the foregoing that allocations for 
agricultural investment in the national budget are small, both abso-
lutely and in relation to the importance of building up agricultural 
production as a means of capital accumulation. 
d. Range of Possible Increases of Agricultural Production 
and Exports. 
The over-all future goals and policies of the Chinese 
Communists are not ascertainable from their many published discussions 
of economic plans. Only generalized production goals for agriculture 
.have been given, in a speech by Teng Tzu-hui, Diredtor, Rural Work 
Department, Central Committee, Chinese Communist Party. In this speech, 
entitled "Rural Works; Its Basic Mission and Policy," Teng asserts that 
the development of agricultural production especially food production) 
is the first Objective of Chinese Communist agricultural policy. Teng 
gives 160 million metric tons as the food production of 1952. He then 
states the objective for the first Five Year Plan as an increase of 
30 percent over 1952 output. That is to say, the 1957 goal in food 
production is to be 208 million metric tons. Further, he states, '"It 
is hoped that after two Five Year Plans, or a little more time than 
*that, we may attain or approach the goal of the annual production of 
from 275 to 300 million metric tons of food." 
Chinese. Communist agricultural production can be in-
creased in two ways: either by increasing inputs into agriculture or 
by more rational combination of inputs. The major input factors which 
could be beneficially imported fall under two headings -- Capital in-
puts and inputs of technical services. Under the first heading fall 
capital inputs (1) for the extension of cultivation to land not now 
used; (2) for increasing the yield on land presently cultivated, by 
means of additional fertilizer, irrigation, chemicals to control plant 
disease and pests, and draft power and equipment for more timely cul-
tivation; (3) for mechanization where it will result in more intensive 
cultivation. Under the second heading fall inputs of technical 
services (1) in engineering fields dealing with irrigation and water 
conservancy; (2) of genetic specialists for improving plant types and 
animal breeds; (3) of agriculturalists to provide management for the 
more effidient combination of inputs. 
All the above-listed inputs are relatively scarce dn 
Communist China'. Unless imports of the above input factors, especially

fertilizer, are made in large quantities, the stated production goals 
can probably not be achieved. 
Even with unlimited access to sources of supply in both 
the Soviet Bloc and the Western world, it is doubtful that technological 
and management imports could affect production in Communist China within 
the length of time specified. The experimental and testing procedures 
for improved seed and livestock are long-term projects. Even after im-
proved and adapted types are created, they must be widely distributed 
before having an effect on total production. The time lag between the 
creation of a new type and its general use is substantial. 
It is generally accepted that Chinese Communist agri-
culture is on a low technological plane as compared with Western agri-
culture. By and large, its cultivating practices are the same today 
as during the past several centuries. Crops are cultivated with simple 
hand tools and with a limited dependence on animal draft power. Seed 
selection and animal breeding for increased production are not widely 
practiced py the peasant, except for certain rudimentary selective 
practices which are age-old. The weaknesses of Chinese agriculture 
are low output per man and inflexibility in respect to transforming 
land use, cultivating practices, and technology to a higher plane in 
order to achieve greater output per man. That such a system can be 
transformed only at great cost and over a long period of time would 
seem to be the prospect, according to the previous experience of other 
nations. 
As to the possibility of increasing agricultural pro-
duction by the use of additional fertilizer, the experience of Japanese 
agricultural supervisors in Formosa prior to 1945 and of Chinese spe-
cialists working with the US ECA mission to China in 1948-49 indicated 
that, under conditions of proper control and distribution, the rational 
application of chemical fertilizers to the present acreage of rice 
(besides the organic fertilizers presently applied) would yield ap-
proximately double the tonnage of chemical fertilizers in additional 
rice.* Other crops would be similarly benefited by additional chemical 
fertilizers. A large. increase in availability of chemical fertilizers 
commensurate with Communist China's needs could come about only through 
* For example', the properly controlled application of 7.5 million tons 
of chemical fertilizers to present rice acreage in China might increase 
total rice production from the present 47,730,000 tons per year to 62 
million tons per year.

Other manufacturing countries. Only relativelysmall additional 
agricultural Yields by this means may be accomplished by the end of 
1957. Table 23 shows the estimated figures of production and con-
sumption of chemical fertilizers in the Bloc in 1952. Each of the 
producing countries in this group consumes all of its production.

The best prospects for substantially increasing Chinese 
Communist supplies of chemical fertilizers within the period of this 
estimate appear to lie in the possible resumption of trade 'with Japan, 
in the promised rehabilitation by the USSR of the chemical industries 
of North Korea, in the possible expansion of trade with the Western 
world, and in the increase of Chinese Communist production. Japan 
might possibly be able to supply 300,000 to 400,000 metric tons from 
its existing chemical factories. If the rehabilitation of the chemical 
industries of North Korea begins in early 1954, supplies at the rate 
of 200,000 to 300,000 metric tons per year might begin to be available 
to Communist China by mid-1955. An additional 200,000 to 300,000 metric 
tons might possibly be Obtained from the expansion of Chinese Communist

trade with the West. The projected increase of Chinese Communist pro-
duction of chemical fertilizers might begin to yield an additional 
200,000 metric tons per year by mid-1955. Thus, depending upon the 
rate of progress in all these possible developments, Communist China 
? might possibly be able to obtain additional supplies of chemical fer-
? tilizers to a maximum of 1 million metric tons per year by 1955. 
Since an increase of agricultural production remains the principal 
source of investment funds for Chinese Communist industrialization 
goals, it is believed that high priority may be assigned to such a 
program. 
The ability of Communist China to expand its export 
of agricultural products and the ability of the rest of the world to 
import_ them are subject to a number of limiting factors both political 
and economic. Historically, China has been both an importer and an 
exporter of agricultural commodities. Analysis of the agricultural 
trade of China in the pre-Communist period reveals two important 
general points: .(1) Imports of agricultural commodities have been 
mainly for food and clothing, consisting of rice, wheat and flour, 
sugar, and raw cotton; and (2) exports of agricultural commodities 
have consisted mainly of industrial raw materials and some foods --
hog.bristles, silk, tung oil, soybeans, soybean oil, various other 
vegetable oils, eggs, egg products, and tea. 
Of these commodities, the various oils and oilseeds 
are at present the most important potential export group. Rice 
occupies a special position as a possible export commodity. Whereas 
rice, prior to the period of Communist control, was imported, now it 
is being exported to India and to Ceylon in exchange for rubber. In 
view of the Chinese grain position, the rice export program represents 
a serious effort to secure rubber for Communist China and for reexport 
to the other Soviet Bloc countries. With some sacrifice of consump-
tion, Communist China has obtained rice for export by efficient tax 
collection and by the government purchasing program, even though rice 
production has not reached the prewar peak. 
As for vegetable oils, the export aims of the Chinese 
Communists appear to be twofold: (1) To maintain the maximum level 
of exports of vegetable oils and seeds commensurate with the require-
ment of the domestic economy, and (2) to provide a sufficient supply 
of raw materials to keep the oil processing facilities, primarily 
under government control, operating at near capacity. Although pro-
duction is only slightly below the prewar level, existing trade in 
a

S-E-C-R-E-T 
vegetable oils and oilseeds is well below the prewar level. The 
Korean War occasioned the first major exports from China to its 
former markets in Western Europe, where the demand was largely to 
build up stocks; as soon as this was accomplished, non-Spviet Bloc 
European demand fell sharply. In 1952, European imports of vege-
table oils fell to only a fraction of the 1951 level. Prospects 
of re-establishing the prewar trade relationships with Japan are 
indeterminate. Japan could be expected to import about 250,900 to 
500,000 metric tons of oilseeds and an equal amount of oilseed 
cake. With fulfillment of production plans for fats and oils in 
the European Satellites, their imports of vegetable oils and oil 
materials from China should diminish. Exports from China to the 
Bloc countries thus appear dependent upon the success or failure 
of production plans in those countries. The USSR is importing 
finished oils in greater amounts from other sources but apparently 
depends upon imports from China to raise the standard .of consump-
tion under its present policy. 
In respect to cotton textiles, if the Chinese Com-
munists approach their goals of increased cotton production, the 
markets of the Satellites and Asia would provide sizable demand 
for textile exports under conditions of free trade. A 30-percent 
increase in cotton production over the 1952 estimate is considered 
reasonable. The positions of other miscellaneous potential exports 
are varied. The tea produced in China has generally been a low-
quality product in comparison with other Asian tea production. In 
the past, exports have been of the brick type, largely going to the 
USSR. There is no reason to expect much change in this position. 
China has the potential to supply hog bristles near any previous 
? export level, depending on demand) which has been somewhat reduced 
by the development of synthetics as substitutes. Silk is in much 
the same position. Eggs and egg products can probably be exported 
in greater quantities than now, since Western Euroie was previously 
a major market and probably would become so again, political aspects 
as-
In summary, it appears that if the Chinese Communists 
assiduously pursue a program to obtain and apply additional supplies 
of chemical fertilizers, they can increase their export surplus of 
rice, especially to India (without, however, raising the consumption 
levels of their own people), although a partial crop failure in any 
year would wreck the program. In respect to vegetable oils and oil-
seeds, it appears that the present level of production of between

S-E-C-R-E-T 
1.7 million and 1.8 million metric tons of vegetable oils and over 17 
million tons of oil-bearing materials can be substantially increased. 
Thus the Chinese Communists have the ability to meet any reasonable 
export opportunities for vegetable oils and oilseeds; they have cur-
rently lost their Western European markets to the US, but the USSR is 
striving to raise its consumption standards partly by use of Chinese 
agricultural products. Tea and silk exports may be increased slightly, 
and exports. of hog bristles, eggs, and egg products may be increased 
substantially. It is estimated that the maximum possible increase 
over 1953 resulting from all these efforts might be as much as US $200 
million per year in additional capital funds obtained from increased 
exports of agricultural products within the period of this estimate. 
It is not possible to predict whether all the condi-
tions will obtain to enable the Chinese Communists readily to achieve 
the level of agricultural production which their ambitious indus-
trialization and export programs require. Rather, it is possible only 
to project the level of production through 1957 on the basis of past 
performance of the economy: this would give an over-all increase of 
roughly 8 to 10 percent, with increases of some export crops as high 
as 30 percent by 1957. Larger capital inputs and more rapid assimila-
tion of improved techniques, as discussed above, might enable earlier 
realization of these possibilities. The projected estimates of agri-
cultural production are given in Table 24.* 
2. Modern Industrial Sector.** 
a. Coal Industry. 
. Since the rise to power of the Chinese Communists, 
coal production has increased from 22.7 million tons in 1949 to 45.8 
million tons in 1952. Production in 1953 reached an estimated 50.2 
million tons. Thus It would appear that the Chinese. Communists have 
sufficient coal for their own consumption and for export to the USSR, 
Japan, and North Korea. 77/

Investment plans for 1953 envisage concentration on 
sinking and equipping new shafts and improving extraction facilities 
at open pit mines as well as continuing mine rehabilitation projects 
already initiated. Total capital investment for 1953 is planned at 
3 times the total for the preceding 3 years. Investment in construc-
tion constitutes 50 percent of total investment; of this, 69.4 percent 
is to be allocated to "new construction," 25.2 percent to remodeling, 
and 5.4 percent to restoration. These percentages indicate the pri-
ority that is given to expansion of coal production capacity. 80/ 
Chinese coal reserves have been estimated at approxi-
mately 275 billion tons, of which North China contains 135 billion; 
the Northwest, 105 billion; the Northeast, 11 billion; and the South-
west and Central-South, 10 billion each; East China and the Inner 
Mongolian Autonomous Region divide the remainder of approximately 2 
billion tons each. Although the Northeast ranks fourth in total coal 
reserves, it ranks first in coal production because of the heavy con.-
centration of industry in that area. The Northeast produces probably 
as much as one-half the total production.of.Communist China. 81/ ? 
Chinese Communist exports of coal in 1952 amounted to 
an estimated 3.8 million tons, of which the USSR received 3 million 
tons, North Korea, 750,000 tons, Hong Kong, 28,000 tons, and Japan, 
25,000 tons. 82/ Soviet requirements on the Trans-Siberian Railroad 
accounted.for most of the exports to the USSR; other Soviet Bloc 
imports of Chinese coal are not expected to increase during the period 
of this estimate, mainly because of the long haul involved. Among 
the non-Bloc countries, Japan is by far the best potential importer  
of Chinese coal. 
 the maximum of coking coal that 
could be imported per year from China would be 1,750,000 tons. 83/ 
Pakistan is importing 200,000 tons of Chinese coal under a barter 
agreement, and Ceylon is interested in importing Chinese coal. 84/ 
China faces competition from India and Australia in the Asian markets 
but may be relatively better able to supply coking coal. 
The development of new coal mines in Communist China 
is dependent on sizable imports or manufacture of new equipment and 
supplies. Among the items required are steel cable, large pumps, 
compressors, hoists, electric motors, mining combines, cutting machines, 
drills, conveyors, mine cars, and mine locomotives. For technical 
services, China will probably continue to be somewhat dependent on the 
Soviet Bloc, particularly the USSR, until Chinese technicians show

themselves capable of engineering their own coal mines. It is sig-
nificant that the failure to meet planned quotas for the first half 
of 1953 is attributed by the Chinese themselves "to lack of scientific 
planning and management." 85/ 
The chief vulnerability of China in the coal industry 
is the separation of the heavily populated areas from the coal fields. 
Generally, coal is shipped from North.China to Central and South China, 
where local production and shipment via railroad and barge cost more 
than North Chinese production and shipment by sea. Other problems 
include the continued use of old, worn-out equipment; ageing mines; 
present inability to produce new equipment; and a shortage of tech-
nicians and skilled.workers. 86/ ,Soviet technicians are helping to 
supply these deficiencies and are assisting the Chinese Communists 
to build a coal mining machinery plant at Fu-shun. Improved technical 
equipment is said to have enabled the Chinese Communists to increase 
their production of coal from the same mines by 2-1/2 times., while 
the completion of the mining equipment plant will nearly double the 
Chinese Commhnist output of mining machinery. 87/ 
It is estimated that by 1958 the Chinese Communists 
will still be dependent upon outside sources for some of the capital 
goods required for the improvement of production facilities but will 
probably be in a better position in regard to technicians and skilled 
labor. Based on the wartime level of coal production, Communist China 
is capable now of an annual production of about 65 million tons of . 
coal. It is estimated that, with the projected improvements, Communist 
China can expand its coal production from the 1953 estimated produc-
tion of 50 million tons to 72.8 million tons per year. The actual 
level of production will depend on internal requirements and export 
demand. 
b. Electric Power Industry. 
Since 1949 the fundamental tenet of Chinese Communist 
planning has been the development of heavy industry, which is largely 
dependent upon the generation of electric power for expansion of pro-
duction. By the end of 1952, the production of electricity in China 
had increased from 4.8 billion kilowatt-hours in 1949 to approximately 
8 billion kilowatt-hours. Revised plans for 1953 call for an added 
increase of 18.3 percent over the 1952 figure, which would result in 
a production of about 9 billion kilowatt-hours. ?.?../

The present capability of Communist China for manu-
facturing equipment for power plants is extremely limited. Hence, 
almost all heavy generating equipment must come from other Soviet 
Bloc countries, specifically the USSR. In February 1953 a special 
agreement was signed in Moscow which outlined Soviet assistance to 
China for the expansion and construction of new power stations. 90/ 
Restoration of the Suiho hydroelectric power plant was specifically 
mentioned in connection with the Soviet grant of 1 billion rubles 
to North Korea for rehabilitation. This plant formerly supplied 
about 200,000 kilowatts -- about half its capacity -- to Manchuria. 
Its temporary denial to Manchuria decreased the amount of power 
available to the Chinese Communist economy as a whole by an estimated 
10 percent. 
The production of electric power in Manchuria in-
creased from 1.4 billion kilowatt-hours in 1949 to 3.9 billion kilo-
watt-hours in 1952. Announced plans call for an increase in 1953 
of 44 percent over 1952, but if the cutback of the over-all planned 
increase from 27 percent to 18.3 percpnt for all China is applied

proportionately to Manchuria, the increase there will be 29.8 percent 
in 1953. Present production of electric power in Manchuria amounts to 
over 50 percent of the total power production of China. Other impor-
tant power production regions in China are East China, 24.6 percent; 
North China, 13,2 percent; Central-South China, 7.2 percent; and the 
rest of China, less than 5 percent. a/ 
The major input to the electric power industry, other 
than labor, is fuel for the thermal power plant. With the exception 
of a few scattered small hydro, diesel, and gasoline-driven plants in 
China proper and three of the major power plants in Manchuria, all the 
power plants are steam powered. Even the power plants in the coastal 
cities, which formerly at times used fuel oil rather than coal, now 
u6e coal almost exclusively. It is estimated that in 1952 in Manchuria, 
2.4 million tons of coal were consumed in power production, and in 
China proper, 3.7 million tons. In addition to fuel, there is also a 
need for water-treatment chemicals, lubricating oils and greases, and 
repair parts for all equipment. 92/ 
Communist China is heavily dependent upon Soviet tech-
nicians for the improvement of existing facilities and for the con-
struction of additional capacity. The Communists are placing great 
emphasis, however, on the training of Chinese engineers and technicians 
for the power industry. It now appears that the principal deterrents 
to expansion of the Chinese Communist power industry are the lack of 
capacity to produce generating equipment and of technicians to operate 
the required generating equipment. Since this equipment is not plenti-
ful anywhere in the Soviet Bloc, Communist China cannot procure the 
necessary supplies of major power station equipment except under its 
agreement with the USSR. 21/ A recent Soviet announcement indicates 
that, with Soviet technical aid and equipment plus Chinese production 
of small generators, projects already committed will result in an in-
crease of 100 percent over 1952 production. 2Lq Therefore, if the 
present and promised level of Soviet assistance, in the form of tech-
nical aid and generating equipment, is continued throughout the period. 
of this estimate, it is possible that power production in Communist 
China may reach an annual rate of 14 billion to 18 billion kilowatt-
hours by 1957.* Actual performance under this plan may be somewhat 
* Methodology: This estimate was arrived at by estimating a gradual 
increase in the rate of utilization of electric power and applying 
this increasing rate of utilization to the previously estimated avail-
able power production capacities; tat is, applying the rate of increase

less than this figure; earlier statements by the Chinese Communists 
indicated they expected to achieve some of their goals by 1959. 
c. Ferrous Metals Industry. 
The estimated production of iron ore in. Communist China 
in 1952 was 4 million tons; of pig iron, 1,875,000 tons; of crude steel, 
1,222,000 tons; and of refined steel, 850,000 tons. 95/ 
. The iron and steel industry is centered at Anshan in 
Manchuria.. Pig iron is also. produced at Penhsihu in Manchuria and to 
a lesser degree at Shih-ching-shan and Taiyuan in North China. Ingot 
steel is produced at Anshan and Taiyuan and at smaller plants in 
Tangshan, Tientsin, and Shanghai. The chief rolling mill facilities 
are in Anshan, Chungking, Shanghai, Taiyuan, Dairen, and Tientsin. 
Anshan is the only modern integrated steel plant in Communist China, 
however, and has the largest facilities for producing coke.. 96/ 
Announced plans for 1953 call for an increase of 14 
percent in pig iron production over 1952, to reach a total of 2,100,000 
tons, a 23 percent increase in crude steel output to reach a total of 
1,610,000 tons, and a 34 percent increase in refined steel output to 
reach a total of 1,140,000 tons. Iron ore production is considered to 
be adequate, with a possible export surplus of 500,000 tons. Most of 
the export will probably go to the European Satellites. 
Information concerning the volume of investment is 
lacking, but, as the reconstruction phase nears completion, investment 
is presumed to be heavy and increasing. The reconstruction and expan-
sion of the Anshan metallurgical plant alone is one of the major invest-
ment items in industry.' It accounts for a major share of the crude 
and, finished steel output. Although only 4 of this plant's 9 blast 
furnaces are now operating, the USSR has promised to reconstruct one 
of the inoperative furnaces so that it will soon be the largest in 
China, and to convert three preparatory open hearths into open hearth 
furnaces. In addition, a sheet' steel mill and a-seamless tubing mill* 
in power production in proportion to the projected increase in indus-
trial activity. Assuming that China receives adequate supplies of 
generating equipment, the average annual increase in production of elec-
tric power would be about 1.6 billion kilowatt-hours in .1953 through 1957.

are Under construction at Anshan, while the rolling mill facilities of 
the latter are being expanded to achieve a planned annual production 
of enough steel rails to lay 2,200 miles of single-track line. Since 
the Chungking rolling mill No. 101 is estimated to be producing enough 
steel rails to lay 535 miles of single-track line per year, Communist 
China now has two strategically located rail-producing centers -- one 
in the Northeast and one in the Southwest -- to satisfy its current 
rail needs. 97/ 
Considerable dependence is now placed and will continue 
to be placed on Soviet engineers and technicians, who have already 
trained several hundred Chinese workers in the practice of modern metal-
lurgical techniques. The expansion of the iron and steel industry of 
Communist China is directly dependent on the continuance of Soviet Bloc 
exports of heavy production machinery and other assorted fabricated 
steel products. The USSR has promised to assist Communist China during 
the next 4 years in increasing crude steel production by 4 to 4.5 times 
the 1952 production and in increasing by 2.5 times the 1952 production 
of refined steel. Therefore, if the USSR provides sufficient technical 
aid and equipment for the expansion of the Chinese Communist steel 
industry, it is estimated that the production of crude steel in China 
by the end of 1957 will be at ?the rate of approximately 5 million 
metric tons per year, and the production of refined steel about 2.2 
million metric tons per year.* 
a. Nonferrous Metals Industry. 
Current production of nonferrous' minerals in ore or 
concentrate form in Communist China is sufficient for the country's 
needs of such metals, and leaves a surplus for export, with the excep-
tion of copper. However, nonferrous metals in semifinished or 
finished form in some cases are lacking because of the dearth of 
smelting and refining facilities in China. Table 27** presents the 
estimated current nonferrous metals position of Communist China in 
1952. 
Communist China is still one of the world's major pro-
ducers of antimony and tungsten. Except for a few hundred tons consumed 
* This estimate was Obtalned by multiplying the estimated 1952 crude 
steel production figure by 4, and the estimated 1952 refined steel 
production by 2.5. 98/

In tin resources, Communist China is potentially the most important 
tin-producing area in the Bloc (which is not self-sufficient in tin), 
having an estimated reserve of 1.5 million metric tons of contained 
tin. 101/ The entire production of tin concentrates in Communist 
China, amounting to an estimated 12,000 tons of tin content in 1953, 
is exported to other Bloc countries. Development plans call for the 
doubling of refined tin production at Kochiu, Yunnan, which means a 
total refined tin ingot production capacity of 5,000 tons by 1957.

An important export of Communist China to the Soviet 
Bloc is mercury, since the Bloc is believed to be barely self-sufficient. 
It is probable that increasing amounts .of mercury are being consumed in 
the Bloc in the production of fulminate of mercury, which is used as a 
detonator in bombs, grenades, artillery shells, and mines. Soviet tech-
nicians have been engaged in mercury mining activities in Southwest 
China, thus further indicating the emphasis placed on the need of 
the Bloc for mercury. 102/ 
The Chinese Communists have never had more than an 
experimental pilot plant for aluminum production and are, therefore, 
dependent on imports of aluminum metal. China has large reserves of 
commercial-grade aluminum ores, a considerable part of which is ac-
cessible to transportation. The development of an aluminum industry 
in China must necessarily follow or parallel the development of large 
power installations, either thermal or hydroelectric. 103/ Current 
Chinese Communist official planning envisages an increase in the out-
put of aluminum at Fu-shun, Manchuria, with Soviet aid. 104/ 
Copper is in quite short supply in Communist China, 
its domestic requirements possibly being as high as 20,000 tons a year, 
or twice the estimated 1952 production; these requirements will prob-
ably increase rapidly as industrialization progresses. Although China , 
is devoting strenuous efforts to increasing production of copper from 
deposits in Yunnan and Manchuria, it will remain dependent on the rest 
of the Soviet Bloc for imports of its refined copper needs during the 
period of this estimate. The present known copper ore reserved in 
China -- as well as the possibility of increased copper production 
from reserves -- render economically feasible an expansion of produc-
tion of copper to the extent of self-sufficiency. Meanwhile, since 
the Bloc as a whole is a copper deficit area, the Chinese Communist 
deficit in copper metal necessitates Bloc procurement from outside 
sources. 105/ 
In August 1952 a Ministry of Geology was set up for 
the purpose of expanding the planning and creation of geologic sur-
veys and the organization of recruitment and training of geologists. 
The aim is to expand geological work 10 to 25 times in 1953, and 
further measures are planned for 1954 and 1955. According to plan, 
in 1953 over 3,500 geology students were to be trained in the Peiping 
Institute of Geology and by 1956 over 9,000 students will have been 
admitted for training each year. 106/

Some of the factors which must be overcome if China 
expects to increase its mining production are the following: lack 
of modern know-how and equipment for proving of geological ore 
reserves; generally primitive mining and treatment met4ods; lack 
of modern production and local transportation equipment and facili-
ties and improved roads; and lack of skilled labor, engineers, 
geologists, statisticians, and management. Table 28 shows the esti-
mated nonferrous metals production that Communist China can achieve 
by the end of 1957, assuming that the other countries of the ,Soviet 
Bloc continue to furnish increasing quantities of mining, drilling, 
extracting, and refining equipment, plus technical advice.

e. Petroleum Industry. 
The current production of refined petroleum products 
in Communist China, including Fu-shun production from oil shale, is 
about 555,000 metric tons per year (3,885,000 barrels). The main 
oil fields are located at Yumen in Kansu Province and at Wu-su in 
Sinkiang. The important crude oil refineries, with total capacity 
of 555,000 metric tons of refined products per year, are located at 
Yumen, Wu-su, Tihwa (Sinkiang Province), and in Manchuria, and the 
major shale 'oil refinery is located at FIJI-shun. The extension of 
the Lan-chou rail line, which should reach the Kansu fields by the 
end of 1954, should ease the distribution of petroleum and petroleum 
products originating in the Yumen area. It is quite likely that the 
Dairen refinery, the Dairen shale oil plant, and the Chin-hsi petroleum 
refinery, all operating on crude oil received from Sakhalin, may cur-
rently be providing approximately 250,000 tons of refined products per 
year to the Chinese economy. 107/ 
Current requirements of the civilian economy are esti-
mated at 500,000 tons per year, while military consumption under 
conditions of the Korean War is estimated at 750,000 tons per year. 
During 1952, China imported an estimated 1 million tons of petroleum 
products from the Soviet Bloc. It was expected that this figure would 
be exceeded in 1953. Most of these Imported petroleum products are 
transported over the Trans-Siberian Railroad through the border towns 
of Man-chou-li and Sui-fen-ho. Oil also is imported in bulk from the 
USSR via the Amur river and thence via the Sungari. In 1952 a total 
of 60,000 tons of oil was imported over this route. The present bulk 
storage capacity, which is believed to be little greater than the 1949 
capacity of 1.4 million metric tons, is located mainly in port cities, 
Shanghai having the largest oil storage capacity of any city, that is, 
over 430,000 metric tons. There is a growing need, however, for in-
creased bulk storage.facilities at the main inland centers of indus-
trial development. 108/ 
U,-der the current Five Year Plan, much emphasis is 
placed on exploration, exploitation, and refining of oil, particularly 
in Sinkiang Province, whose oil reserves, according to a Peiping 
announcement, are estimated at 160 million metric tonsl-or about 
60 percent of the totd1 petroleum reserves of China. Refinery capacity 
at Yumen, Kansu, is to be "greatly increased." Allocations to geological 
prospecting in the 1953 budget, which increased 600 percent over 1952, 
reflect the effort being devoted to petroleum exploration. Almost

all refining equipment and many of the engineers and technicians as 
well must be imported from the Soviet Bloc. 109/ 
Since it is very probable that the extension of the 
Lan-chou rail line to Yumen,oil fields will be in operation before 
the end of 1957, it is estimated that Chinese production of POL 
products will average about 700,000 metric tons per year through 
the Five Year Plan period.* 
f. Chemical Industries. 
Since the current Five Year Plan 'of Communist China 
stresses the expansion of heavy industry, a high priority is placed 
on increasing the total output of such industrial chemicals as sul-
phuric and nitric acid, caustic soda, soda ash, synthetic ammonia, 
calcium carbide, and coal tar chemicals. Table 29** shows the esti-
mated 1952 supply situation in Communist China as regards these 
chemicals., 
Only fragmentary information is available concerning 
the production of chemical fertilizers for agriculture, although an 
expansion of production capacity is planned. Most of the ammonium 
sulphate now being produced is in the form of fertilizer, of which 
'the production capacity is estimated to be 187,000 metric tons 
(20 percent nitrogen) per year. It is estimated that 290,000 metric 
tons (20 percent nitrogen) of ammonium sulphate comprised at least 
95 percent of total fertilizer imports in 1952. 
In March 1953 the USSR agreed to assist Communist 
China in equipping the chemical industry. Announced goals.do not 
indicate the extent of planned expansion, but it is evident that 
chemical industry planning for increased production is concentrated 
first on restoring or replacing facilities built during the Japanese 
era of industrialization in Manchuria and North China. In May 1953 
it was announced that a new caustic soda plant was being built in 
southern Manchuria and that a fertilizer plant had been built in . 
Szechuan Province in Southwest China. Two sulphuric acid plants are 
* This estimate is based on an analysis of current oil refinery 
operating capacities, allowances for current expansion of old and 
construction of new refining facilities, and an allowance for an 
increase in production of approximately 100,000 metric tons per year.

for the fulfillment of planned production increases. These are produc-

little current information is available concerning the production of

Much emphasis is being placed on the development of 
rubber tree plantations on Hainan Island. It is possible that 
10,000 metric tons of indigenous natural rubber may be produced by 
1960, but a more probable production estimate is that slightly more 
than half, or 5,600 metric tons, will actually be produced. Consump-
tion meanwhile is estimated at 30,000 to 35,000 metric tons per year, 
with the rubber footwear industry consuming the largest proportion. 
Since 1950 the Chinese Communists have been striving 
to expand production of motor vehicle tires, particularly truck tires. 
It is estimated that there are some seven tire plants in operation in 
Shanghai, Tsingtao, Shen-yang (Mukden), Canton, and Tientsin. The 
plants in Tsingtao and Mukden are the largest producers. By the end 
of 1953, motor vehicle tire production in Chinese plants may exceed 
300,000 sets. 
Current planning envisages increased Soviet Bloc ex-
ports of production equipment to provide for the replacement of worn-
out machinery, as well as to provide for the expansion of the Mukden 
and Tsingtao plants, whose capacities are expected to be doubled. 
Recent information reveals that at least one of these plants (probably 
the Tsingtao Plant) has been equipped to produce tires for MIG-15's

have steadily declined in quantity since 1951 and are now believed 
to consist only of special-size tires which either are not produced 
or are in limited supply in China, that is, 10.00 x 20 heavy duty 
truck and bus tires, and tires for farming and roadbuilding equip-
ment. 
In view of present operating plant capacities and 
prospective imports of tire machinery from the Soviet Bloc, it is 
estimated that Communist China by the end of 1957, will have the 
capacity to produce about 700,000 sets of motor tires per year, which 
will completely satisfy its requirements (except for special sizes).* 
* This estimate has been formulated on the basis of annual produc-
tion capacity increases of about 50,000 sets per year.

g. Engineering Industries. 
The Chinese Communists are heavily .dependent upon 
imports for capital goods. Their investment program for the period 
of this estimate has been designed to reduce this dependency, particu-
larly as regards capital inputs in the basic industries -- coal, 
electric power, iron and steel, and machine building. The estimated 
1952 production of metal-cutting machine tools was approximately 
6,500 units, and of antifriction bearings 430,000 units (the latter 
representing about one-fourth of the Chinese Communist current esti-
mated requirements for bearings). 115/ Production of machine tools 
in 1953 was expected to be increased by 4.6 percent, to approximately 
6,800 units. 
Tables 31 and 32* present the major new construction 
and reconstruction projects under way in 1953-54 in the Machine build-
ing industries. 
Fulfillment of the present Chinese program of indus-
trial expansion and development probably will be achieved mainly by 
imports of technical aid and industrial machinery, and of electrical, 
electronic, and transportation equipment from the Soviet Bloc. In 
view of the small number of engineers and skilled workers and their 
generally inadequate technical knowledge, it appears evident that the 
immediate problem is to train enough engineers and skilled workers 
so that a skilled manpower base may be established upon which future 
industrial expansion may develop. At the present time, domestically 
trained technical and administrative personnel continue to be inadequate 
In number and knowledge, so that the deficit developing with industrial 
expansion must be filled with Bloc personnel. 116/ 
By the end of 1957, the Chinese Communists will have 
undertaken integrated production of such items of heavy industrial 
equipment as trucks, tractors, locomotives, electronic equipment, and 
marine engines; but it is estimated that, to obtain supplies of these 
items sufficient for further industrial expansion, Communist China 
will continue to find it necessary to rely on imports of most of these 
Items within the period of this estimate. It is further estimated 
that by the end of 1957, in view of the priority on expansion of pro-
ducer goods production in Communist China, the annual production of

antifriction bearings -- a critical item -- will be about 1 million 
units; this will be considerably less than the Chinese Communist esti-
mated annual requirements of about 2 million units, thus indicating ' 
continued reliance on foreign imports. (As regards machine tools, 
annual production is planned to reach 22,750 units by 1957, depending 
on Soviet aid and the schedule of activating newly constructed plants.) 
h. Armaments Industry. 
The armaments industry of Communist China today is 
in the midst of a modernization program, but is not yet capable of 
meeting all equipment requirements of the Chinese Armed Forces. 
Arsenals have suffered looting by the USSR, by the Chinese Communists 
(when they were afraid of recapture by the Nationalist), and by the 
Chinese Nationalists when they were retreating to Formosa. The build-
ing of a modern armaments industry is stated to be of highest priority 
in current economic plans. The Chinese Communists have acknowledged 
'Soviet assistance in this effort, and it would be logical to assume 
that standardization based on Soviet types of equipment is to be en-
forced as in the European Satellites. As the Chinese Communists pro-
ceed toward that goal, they are concentrating their productive effort 
on infantry regiment equipment -- that, is$ small arms, machine guns, 
mortars, and some light artillery 117/ -- and are still receiving the 
large-caliber artillery, ? tanks, and other heavy equipment from the 
USSR. 
Small arms equipment is the major end item in the 
Chinese Columnist armaments program. At least 200,000 pieces are 
known to have been produced in 1952. 118/ 
Production of light artillery pieces is on the increase. 
Production of recoiless rifles and rocket launchers does exist. 119/ 
It is indicated that the industry has been modernized so that it is 
now on a level of production of about that of World War II. This level 
of production is still inadequate for the needs of Communist China. 
The geographical distribution of the armaments indus-
try differs substantially from that of other engineering industries 
in Communist China, since the location of armaments plants has in 
the past been determined more by considerations of short-range politi-
cal and military strategy than by longer-range, basic economic factors. 
Most of the larger armament plants are located in or near large urban 
areas with ready access to transportation and power facilities. Many

of the small establishments, however, are located in areas remote 
from cross-country transportation routes. Adjacent to past military 
frontiers, they utilize portable generators for power supply and 
pack animals for transport. In all, there are reportedly .about 
160 arsenals in operation, employing about 260,000 workers. During 
1950 and 1951, many small arsenals and repair shops were consolidated 
particularly in the Central-South China area. 120/ 
At the present time the most important center of 
armaments production in China is Mukden. 
the Mukden arsenal and its branches are operating at 100 percent 
capacity, employing about 30,000 workers, and accounting for about 
one-half of the armaments production of Communist China. 121/ Mukden 
arsenals reportedly are producing small arms, machine guns, and 
mortars at a very high rate. 
Reputedly, the second most important arsenal is 
located at Tuai-yuan. This arsenal was re-
constructed along Soviet lines in mid-1950 and is now capable of 
producing light artillery and various kinds of automatic weapons. 
In 1949 it was reported as having a monthly production rate of 
5,000 rifles, 1,300 machine guns, 300 mortars, and 48 mountain guns. 
Other important arsenals are located in Chungking, 
Cantqn, and Nanking. Soviet equipment for weapons manufacture was 
furnished to the 21st, 24th, and 29th Arsenals in Chungking in 1950. 
The 21st Arsenal is considered the fourth largest in China. 
At Canton, the former Stonewell (Shih-ching) Arsenal 
(renamed the South China Arms Factory) was expanded between September 
1950 and June 1951 under plans drawn up by the Soviet Advisory Com-
mission. 123/ This plant is important in supplying the Viet Minh 
forces in Indochina. It was reported In 1951 to be producing weekly 
200 rifles, 100 machine guns, 56 mortars, and 4 antitank guns. 124/ 
Monthly production of ammunition was 3,000 rounds of mortar shells, 
300,000 small arms rounds, and 5,000 land mines. 125/ 
The 60th Arsenal at Nanking was reported modernized 
by early 1950, having been reequipped after the Nationalists had 
moved out with the machinery. 126/ In 1951 it was engaged in produc-
ing submachine guns, small arms ammunition, mortar ammunition, and in 
rebuilding rifles.

Ammunition is being produced both at the arsenals and 
in countless small workshops throughout China. Table 33 presents a 
comparison of ammunition production in Nationalist China in 1948 
with ammunition production in Communist China in 1950 and 1952. 
Ammunition production is a field in which the Chinese have had long 
experience and, are well able to turn out large quantities, particu-
larly in the small arms field. Nevertheless, huge quantities have 
been required from the USSR to meet wartime consumption rates.

After the intervention in Korea, there ensued a phase in which machinery 
was removed from the arsenals in reach of aerial attack to other loca-
tions in China. When the attacks did not materialize, modern Soviet 
equipment was brought in, together with Soviet technicians, and the 
arsenals were modernized along Russian lines. Thus it is logical to 
assume that production in 1952 was substantially higher than in 1951. 
The armaments equipment needs of Communist China are 
tremendous both because of Chinese ambitions in Asia and because of. 
the nature of a Communist state. It must supply its regular field 
forces (of which 878,000 were in Korea as of November 1953), the Public 
Security Troops (a special burden of the Communist state), and in 
addition the Peoples' Militia. These forces are broken down as fol-
lows 127/: field forces, 2,233,000, public security troops, 1,450,000, 
and Peoples' Militia, 6 million -- a total of 9,683,000. 
Communist China is making progress but is not yet 
self-sufficient in the production of small arms, light and heavy 
machine guns, mortars, and certain types of light artillery. The 
same holds true for the production of ammunition for these types of 
weapons. Communist China is now and probably will continue through-
out the period of this estimate to be heavily dependent upon Soviet 
Bloc technical assistance and exports of such armaments as tanks, 
antiaircraft and antitank guns, rocket launchers, and most types of 
heavy field artillery, as well as their ammunition supply. 
Any estimate of future Chinese strength must also con-
sider the extent of this Soviet aid. Supplies of weapons have been 
streaming in at a rate of approximately twice that of Chinese produc-
tion. If, then, Soviet aid continues at the present high level and 
Communist China produces to the utmost of its capacity, the accomplish-
ment of the Five Year Plan begun in January 1953 would result in a 
modern army of over 2 million men in Communist China, which would 
greatly enhance the military power of the Soviet Bloc. 
i. Cotton Textile Industry. 
The cotton textile industry, which is still 50 percent 
in private hands, is among the most modern enterprises operating in 
Communist China. It has made rapid recovery since the advent to power 
of the Communists. At the beginning of 1952, the Chinese Communist 
cotton spinning industry had a total of 5.1 million spindles, of which 
approximately 4.8 million were in operation, thus ranking Communist . 
China third in Asia and seventh in the world in cotton yarn production. 128/

Strict government supervision is exercised through 
the China Cotton, Cloth, and Yarn Corporation, a. government agency 
which allocates raw cotton to mills and controls the disposal and 
price of the finished product. Increasing government control is now 
the most significant aspect of the industry, not only because textile 
manufacture is of major importance to the Chinese economy but also 
because it is the leading industrial producer and employer of labor 
(over 50 percent) and is a major contributor to Chinese domestic and 
international trade. 129/, 
Between 80 and 90 percent of Chinese cotton textile 
producing capacity is concentrated in the Shanghai, Tientsin, and 
Tsingtao areas and in Southern Manchuria. Shanghai alone has. about 
46 percent of Chinese spindlage. In 1952 and 1953 the emphasis was 
on the development and expansion of the textile industry in such 
areas as Wuhan, Canton, Sian, Lan-chou, Tihua, Nanking, and Chungking. 
Table 34 gives cotton yarn and cotton cloth produc-
tion figures for the period 1949-53, based on Communist claims. 
These figures have been projected through 1957 on the basis of an 
expected average annual increase of about 10 percent for cotton cloth 
and one of about 5 to lo percent for cotton yarn.

j. Construction Industry. 
The current Five Year Plan envisages the expansion of 
such Chinese basic heavy industries as the metals, ful, power, heavy 
machinery, and basic chemicals industries. The present trend is to 
build up the existing industrial centers, particularly in Manchuria, 
and simultaneously to develop and build new centers deep in the 
interior so as to provide a relatively invulnerable base in the event 
of attack. The cement industry is centered largely in the Northeast, 
where 14 plants were built by the Japanese. A second but less dense 
concentration is in North China. Other plants are scattered through-
out the country. The cement industry is taken as the key to construc-
tion activity, since it furnishes the principal ingredient of new 
installations. Its development is vital to the growth of the Chinese 
economy. 
The Communist program of industrializing the country 
creates a large demand for industrial buildings to house manufacturing 
plants and offices and to provide roads and airfields to modernize 
the transportation system, all of which require large quantities of 
cement. In addition, military end items such as bunkers, pill boxes, 
coast defenses, and other defensive measures require large quantities 
of cement in their construction. Estimated production of cement for 
1952 was 1,750,000 metric tons. Cement production in 1953 is expected 
to increase by about 30 percent over 1952 to about 2,275,000 metric 
tons. 131/ 
In view of the large quantities of cement that will be 
needed to accomplish the main goals of the current Chinese Communist 
Five Year Plan, it is estimated that by 1957 China will be producing 
cement at the rate of about 3 million metric tons per year.*

recognizes this situation, as evidenced by their 1953 State Budget, 132/ 
in which transport and telecommunications are to receive 6.36 percent 
of the 1953 state expenditures, following "national defense," "industry;" 
and "social, cultural, and educational." 
In capital outlay, the rail system probably receives 
the greatest emphasis. When the Communists ascended to power, they took 
over a rail net located primarily in the Northeast, North, and East 
China regions with a few long extensions to the West, which loosely con-
nected nodes of industrial production and consumption. Since then the 
railroads have been under complete government controls, and the govern-
ment has devoted attention to rehabilitating the existing lines and 
constructing new lines to extend the existing net. At the end of 1952, 
the net totaled 24,232 kilometers. New construction is primarily con-
centrated in the western regions and is undoubtedly based strongly on 
strategic considerations, although economic factors are also important. 
The Ch'eng-tu - Chungking, line was completed in 1952, and work to extend 
this line th4ough to T'ien-shui-is now in progress. When completed, it 
will provide the rich Cheng-tu Basin with a through rail connection to 
the eastern part of the country for the first time. Also completed in 
1952 was the T'ien-shui - Lan-chou line, which is being extended into 
Sinkiang. This railroad serves the dual purposes of connecting the 
Northwest with the rest of China and of stimulating the USSR to connect 
its rail system in Kazakh ASSR with this line via Tihua. Planned for 
future construction is another line from Pao-t'ou in Suiyuan Province 
to Ulan-Bator in Mongolia. These are ambitious projects and will probably 
not be completed by 1957, but it should be noted that with their eventual 
completion Communist China and the USSR will be connected by two more 
lines, which will markedly increase the capabilities of the USSR to move 
material to China. 
At the present time the rail net is capable of satis-
fying the demands of the economy in 1952, it originated approximately 
131 million metric tons of freight, this being an increase from 
110.5 million metric tons originated in 1951, 133/ and 99.2 million 
metric tons originated in 1950. 134/ Total tonnage in 1952 included 
such bulk goods as coal (33 million metric tons), timber (4,350,000 meter 
tons), iron ore (4 million metric tons on short hauls), and grain 
(3,750,000 metric tons). 231/ Since the Communists took over the rail 
system, there has been a trend to utilize rail lines wherever possible 
for movement of manufactured goods which had traditionally been carried 
over water routes. Rail traffic volume is concentrated on North China 
and Manchurian lines.*

The Chinese plan to increase rail transport from 
59,461 million ton-kilometers achieved in 1952 136/ to 63,800 million 
ton-kilometers in 1953, a 7.4 percent increase. 1E/ It is to be 
noted, however, that 4 primary weakness of the Chinese Communist rail 
system is the continual capacity utilization of freight cars under 
present operating methods; little or none of the car park is held in 
reserve. 
The Chinese railroad system is believed to have 
other weaknesses. Although rolling stock is in good repair, 12?/ rail 
replacement may be behind schedule. This weakness may be overcome 
within the next five years by additional production from the new steel-
fabricating plant at Anshan, scheduled to begin operation late in 1958 
with a planned yearly rail production sufficient to lay 2,200 miles of 
single-track lines per Year. 122/ 
The rail net as it is presently constituted has four 
major weaknesses. The first is that the Peiping-Mukden line via 
Tientsin and Lin-yu, and running for a considerable part of its length 
on the coast, is at present the sole link between China proper and 
Manchuria, and by through connections with the.Trans-Siberian Railroad. 
The Peiping-Jehol line is an alternate to the Peiping-Mukden railroad 
and is presently being rehabilitated. With it in operation, the burden 
on th-is route will be lessened; this alternate route, however, will 
probably have a low capacity. With the completion of the rail lines 
through Mongolia and Sinkiang mentioned above, the railroad traffic 
capacity between the USSR and China will be further, enhanced. Second, 
the 75-mile section of track between Chu-chou and Heng-yang is a 
serious bottleneck on the main railroads connecting Canton and Indo-
china with Hankaw and Shanghai, as it forms the center of a large 
carrying the burden of two main lines. This weakness could be overcome 
by double tracking, but as far as is known, this is not planned. The 
third major weakness is the fact that the Chinese rail net is cut in two 
by the Yangtze River. Connections across the river are necessarily by 
ferry at Nanking-Pukow, where the ferries are estimated to be capable of 
handling line capacity, and at Hankay-Wuchang, where facilities are not 
adequate. A railroad bridge across the Yangtze at Hankow is planned, 
but it probably will not be completed within the next five years. 1122/ 
The fourth major weakness of the existing rail net is the lack of 
double track on main trunk lines; the Peiping-Mukden and Harbin-Dairen 
lines are the only double track lines in the entire system. Although 
the present system can adequately handle present tonnage allocations, 
planned industrial expansion during the next 5 years. should tax main

lines in industrial areas. Double tracking on these lines could be the 
answer, although no double tracking plans have been noted. 
An offsetting factor to these weaknesses is the 
centralized control of all lines in the Ministry of Railroads which adds 
an element of flexibility in the use of the transportation equipment and 
should permit a higher rate of utilization than might be possible under 
decentralized management. 
(2) Highways. 
Highway construction is being planned on conjunc-
tion with rail and water routes and with new highways connecting with 
rail lines and/or ports to facilitie a more rapid movement of goods in 
the interior areas. In addition to internal construction, the Commu-
nists are pushing construction on roads to the Northwest in Sinkiang 
Province to link up with the USSR, construction or repair on roads to 
the South to link up with' nets in Indochina, and construction to the 
Southwest on the Tsinghai-Tibet highway designed to strengthen Commu-
nist control over Tibet. 
The Communists have continued the UNRRA highway 
rehabilitation program, restoring or constructing new roads at the rate 
of about 8,000 kilometers per year. Although the Central Ministry of 
Communications is responsible for regulations relative to management 
and engineering standards, individual provinces appear to be responsible 
for construction of all roads, either provincial or national. Labor 
comes primarily from corvees, "anti-Communist corrective labor" groups, 
or the military. About 46 percent of all highway mileage is concentrated 
in the Northwest, with East China, Hunan, and the coastal areas in Hopeh 
receiving a large concentration also. 141/ Generally, the roads are not 
paved, except in urban areas, crushed-rock surfacing predominating. 
Construction efforts of the Chinese Communists are 
being supported by the USSR. New fixed structures, such as bridges, are 
of Soviet design; Soviet technicians are involved in all important pro-
jects; and most of the new roadbuilding equipment is of Soviet make. 
Soviet influence on Chinese highways is significant in that new and 
stronger methods of road construction being introduced are increasing 
the physical capacity of the roads for supporting heavier equipment. 
Road maintenance is well organized but not extensive at present.

The Chinese Communists are primArily dependent upon 
the USSR for their motor-powered rolling equipment. The Chinese Commu-
nist government, however, is presently increasing its civilian truck in-
ventory with US, UK, Czechoslovak, and German models as well as with 
trucks of Soviet make. The estimate of Chinese Communist truck inventory 
for 1952 is 52,350 units. 142/ Military vehicles add considerably to 
trucking potential. Animal-drawn vehicles, pack animals, and porters 
still carry much of the tonnage moving over Chinese highways. 
The importance of the highway system to the economic 
scheme of individual areas varies greatly, from being the main trunk 
transport system in areas such as interior Fukien and numerous areas in 
the Northwest and Tibet, to being feeder routes to the rail and water 
networks over most of the country. Long-distance motor transport is not 
feasible in most areas; fuel is at a premium and under strict government 
control. In 1952 the average length of haul was about 63 kilometers. 143/ 
Consumer goods, mainly foodstuffs, make up the bulk 
of tonnage carried over the highways; building equipment, industrial 
equipment, and petroleum products rise in proportion in and around urban 
areas; the Wu-wei - Lan-chou highway carries heavy truck traffic in POL. 
Total highway tonnage, however, is relatively small compared to railroad 
and water traffic. 
Trucking enterprise is at present primarily carried 
out by government-sanctioned firms or by government-owned and -operated 
joint transportation organizations, which have been set up to consolidate 
supplementary transport, such as trucks and junks, so that produce could 
be moved out of the rural areas more efficiently and the main transport 
lines could be utilized in the most effective manner. These organizations 
have improved rural transport and are at present an integral part of the 
national transport system. This centralized, integrated commodity flow 
is probably one of the more important innovations of the Chinese Com-
munist regime in the improvement of the economy. 
(3) Water Transport. 
Water transport is traditionally one of the most 
important facets of the Chinese economy; on the lower order, small 
sampans operate on creeks and canals with local produce, working up 
through larger streams and canals to the main trunk river routes, the 
Yangtze, the Yellow, the Sungari, and, to a lesser extent, the West and 
North River systems in KNaangtung, and the north and south trunk coastal routes.

Realizing its importance, the Communists have socialized water trans-
port almost completely through ownership, licensing, and commodity 
control. Primary responsibility for shipping lies in the Central. 
Ministry of Communications, and is executed through the Sea Transport 
Main Bureau and the River Transport Main Bureau on the national level, 
and the Provincial Departments of Communication and Joint Transport 
Corporations on the local level. Inland and ocean transport account 
for about 10 percent of all ton-kilometer performance of the Chinese 
Communist transport network. In 1952, it is estimated that inland 
water transport accounted for 5,400 million ton-kilometers and ocean 
transport for 600 million ton-kilometers. This is far below 1936 
levels when inland water transport totaled an estimated 20,300 mil-
lion ton-kilometers and ocean transport 2,200 million ton-kilometers. 
The North China coastal area -- that is, that area 
north of Wen-chou in Chekiang Province -- is under the administration 
of the East China and North Sea District Sea Transport Administration 
Bureau of the Sea Transport Main Bureau. It is estimated that these 
organizations operate about 90 percent of the tonnage in the area, 
and control Virtually all of it. Shanghai is the shipping center of 
this area, with repair and construction facilities for the area, and 
for the Yangtze. Dairen, Tientsin - Ta-ku, Tsingtao, Chinwangtao, 
Chefoo, Ying-k'ou, Hai-chou - Lienyunkang, Wei-hai-wei, Lung-k'ou, 
and Shih-tao .rank in about that relative order of importance within 
the area. The shipbuilding and repair facilities of Dairen are 
Chinese-owned but controlled by the USSR; no Chinese ships are re-
paired at Dairen, except in cases of emergency. Coal from Chinwangtao 
and Dairen and POL from Tsingtao, Dairen, and Ying-Moul moving to 
Shanghai, are the principal oceanborne commodities going south; grains, 
the principal Commodity moving north. Approximately 2.5 million tons 
of cargo were moved by government shipping during 1952 in this area. 
The inland system in South China transports pri-
marily foodstuffs and consumer goods. The South China District Sea 
Transport Administration Bureau administers the South China coastal 
area -- that is, that area south of Swatow. Canton is the shipping 
center, both for the coastal section and for the inland waterways 
system extending up the West and North Rivers. Cargoes along the 
coast are primarily strategic in nature, supporting military estab-
lishments in the delta region and especially on Hainan. Swatow, 
Hoihow, Pakhoi, Tsamkong, and YUlin are the other major ports in this 
area. The Chinese Communists are building up the merchant fleet in 
this area, indicating their possible interest in opening the coastal

route up the east coast between Swatow and Wen-chou, which is at present 
served only by limited junk trade. British, Norwegian, and Danish 
flag shipping sails out of Hong Kong on scheduled runs up the coast. 
Sporadically, armed Communist merchantmen penetrate the area from 
either the north or the south. 
The Yangtze River Navigation Affairs Administra-
tion Bureau at Hankow is the control for shipping on the Yangtze, 
which is the only connection at present between the rich Ch'eng-tu 
Basin and the rest of China, and which is the major east-west trunk 
route of the country. The Yangtze River system carries by far the 
largest amount of commerce of the Chinese waterways. During the 
first half of 1953, over 2.5 million tons of cargo were transport4ed 
over it. 144/ Coal and grain are the primary commodities transported 
on the lower reaches, while the stretch between Hankow and Chungking) 
being the only link between the two areas, carries all classes of 
consumer goods upstream and local produce, ores, and local manufactured 
goods downstream. During 1952, building materials and industrial 
goods replaced grain, cotton, and local agriculture as the principal 
products carried on the system as a whole. Under the Communists, tow-
boats are replacing the traditional junks. Government shipping handles 
over 70 percent' of all transport on the river, most of the remainder 
being controlled by the government through Joint Transport Corpora-
tions. 145/ 
The Sungari River in northern Manchuria is impor-
tant in that it is a convenient transport link between China and the 
USSR. Indications are that operations, centered at Harbin, are still 
in the early stages of development. POL from the USSR, timber, and 
coal are the main commodities moving on the river. Although frozen 
from November .to April and subject to flood conditions in the spring 
and fall, the Sungari probably will remain significant because of its 
link with the Amur River and the USSR. 
Chinese Communist water transport is adequate to 
handle present internal requirements. Because of the reorientation 
of traffic requirements to a north-south direction, the Communists 
have not utilized' fully the existing river transport capacity. A 
major problem facing the Communists has been obtaining cargoes to fill 
the existing bottoms for river shipping. Communist shipbuilding plans 
have been oriented toward replacement of existing barge tonnage and 
repair of powered units, rather than toward expansion of river trans-
port capacity.

The outstanding weakness in the Chinese Communist 
flag ocean transport is its dependence upon other nations to furnish 
vessels to handle large-scale overseas commerce. The largest vessel 
? known to be in the ocean fleet is less than 7,000 gross tons. Trade 
controls brought about by the Korean War and Nationalist harassment 
from Formosa have also been retarding factors in any possible expan-
sion beyond Chinese Communist waters for Chinese Communist flag 
merchantmen. 
Water transport policy in Communist China is along 
the following lines. First, it is aimed at obtaining complete control 
over commodity movements and shipping organization. This phase of 
policy has been implemented generally, and has had the effect of great-
ly improving commodity flow. Second, it attempts to improve operating 
procedures and centralized control. This phase of the policy is now. 
being implemented and will probably govern operations for the next 
5 years. Third, it attempts to lower passenger fares and freight 
rates. 
Water routing will probably be expanded chiefly 
in the area along the east coast, if possible. Improvements on river 
segments in Northwest and West China are planned, but will be important 
primarily only to the local economy. Expansion to overseas flag ser-
vice depends on a peaceful conclusion to the Korean War, no further 
Chinese Communist aggression, and elimination by the Communists of 
Nationalist interference. Until these requisites are met, the Chinese 
Communists will continue to rely upon Soviet Bloc and non-Bloc ship-
ping for foreign commerce, and will utilize their own vessels in over-
seas coMmerce very little. 
In summary, the Chinese Communist communications 
system is now under complete government control. The Korean War has 
had the negative effect on the system as a whole of diverting capital 
investment to support the war effort instead of placing it on domes-
tic economic development. Thus major improvements on the transport 
net to support the war effort were made in Manchuria, where the nets 
were already the best in China. Because of the war, the Chinese Com-
munists have had to depend more upon Soviet transport technology than 
would have been the case possibly if war necessity had not moved the 
West to restrict trade in technical equipment. In the past the USSR 
furnished a negligible part of such requirements.

Since assuming power, the Communists have united 
the transport networks to a degree never before known to the country. 
This unification was a necessary measure for their enforcement of 
economic controls; it will probably continue to be a motivating fac-
tor in their planned industrial expansion during the next 5 years. 
()4) Telecommunications. 146/ 
In Communist China an estimated 80 percent of the 
available telephone and telegraph service is consumed by industry and 
government (civil and military). Telecommunications services are con-
centrated in the more industrialized and more heavily populated eastern 
section of the country: East China is estimated to handle about 45 
percent of all telecommunications services in China; North China,about 
21 percent; Northeast China, 20 percent; and Central-South China, about 
11 percent; thus totaling 97 percent for these 4 regions. The South-
west, Northwest, Tibet, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region then 
account for the remaining 3 percent. 147/ 
The types and makes of equipment are many and 
varied, with little attempt made at standardization, thus influencing 
the quality, continuity, speed, and costs of operation. In the larger 
cities where dial-system telephone equipment and modern telegraph 
equipment exist, the systems are probably fairly efficient. Elsewhere, 
efficiency is undoubtedly law. Efficient operation of the telecom-
munications industry requires skilled manpower, which is scarce. Other 
limitations contributing to this inadequate and inefficient system are: 
a primary lack of production facilities needed to build up and maintain 
the industry, difficulty in importing equipment and apparatus, and lack 
of technological "know how" and technicians. 
The Soviet Bloc is capable of aiding China in 
respect to production of equipment, technical knowledge, and skilled 
personnel. Aid has been rendered, but its extent is not known. 
The 1953 investment plant 1/?13./ indicates that tele-
communications services are recognized as a vital element in the 
buildup of the national economy of Communist China. Telegraph wire-
line has been increased 24 percent since 1949 to 133,000 kilometers 
of line and 212-,800 kilometers of wire in 1952; telephone line has 
been increased 15 percent since 1949 to 435,000 kilometers in 1952. 
This stress will probably continue, and additions to the presently 
inadequate plant are in process. The program for increasing automatic 
dial telephone facilities and plant, as well as for modernization of

telegraph equipment and operation, probably will be continued. Radio 
broadcasting and receiver facilities will probably be increased and 
improved, especially in the sparsely populated sections of the country, 
as this medium can play a vital role in achieving order, cohesion, and 
discipline among the populace. Service generally will probably continue 
to be available primarily to the government. 
C. War-Supporting Capabilities. 
1. Elements of Weakness. 
A good short-run measure of the limitations of Communist 
China in waging a modern mechanized war is the present state of de-
velopment of certain important industries necessary for waging such 
a war. These are the heavy metallurgical, machine tool, aluminum 
and magnesium, chemical, civil aviation, railroad, and electric power 
industries. The reason for selecting civil aviation as one of the 
criteria is that, in, addition to providing an important supply of 
pilots and personnel trained in aircraft. maintenance and operation, 
this industry, can also supply planes., especially of the transport 
type, for military operations. Civil aviation also stimulates the 
construction and maintenance of airfields that can be used for both 
civil and military purposes. 
Table 35* indicates that those industries which are impor-
tant in waging a modern mechanized war are relatively small or unde-
veloped in China. If the status of these eight industries can be con-
sidered as a reasonable criterion for setting limits to the capacity 
of a country to wage a modern war, it must be concluded that China 
alone cannot support a war against a typical industrial country. Of 
all the large countries, India is the only one whose industries are 
about on a par with those of China. 
Japan, a much smaller but more highly industrialized coun-
try, has a higher production in all the commodities listed except 
crude oil. Japan exceeds China in the production of pig iron by 2 
times, crude steel by almost 6 times, machine tools by 1-1/2 times, 
sulfuric acid by 21 times, chlorine by 7 times, calcium carbide by 
60 times, nitrogen and hydrogen in the form of synthetic ammonia by 
20 times, and electric power by almost 6 times. Japan also has about 
8 tines the petroleum refining capacity of China. By 1952, Japan had 
not been allowed by the Allied powers to establish civil aviation lines.

Table 36* compares US production in the same industries 
In 1952 with that of China and the USSR combined. Column 3 shows 
that the US production of the commodities listed surpasses produc-
tion in the two Soviet Bloc countries from 2 to 8-1/2 times. These 
comparisons must be made with caution, however, because the US, to 
achieve minimum goals, must allocate a portion of the output of 
these industries to many uses which the Russians and the Chinese 
Communists regard as of low or negligible priority. 
It appears, in addition, that the contribution of Com-
munist China to the USSR-China combination is' quite small: 7 per-
cent in pig iron; 3.4 percent in crude steel; 7 percent in machine 
tools; no contribution in aluminum and magnesium; 4.2, 2.5, 11.7, 
and 2.6 percent in sulfuric acid, chlorine, soda ash, and calcium 
carbide, respectively; 3.9 percent in synthetic ammonia; 0.7 percent 
in the production of crude oil; and 0.1 percent in refining capacity. 
China also has 7.5 percent of the total USSR-China railroad freight 
net ton kilometers and 6.1 percent of the electric power. These 
percentages would be considerably smaller if the contribution of 
Communist China to the whole Soviet Bloc were calculated. 
2. Elements of Strength. 
Although Communist China does not have the industrial 
capacity to support a modern mechanized war, it does have the capa-
bility to fight a limited war in Indochina, Malaya, Burma, or prac-
tically any other place in South Asia. To engage in warfare with 
an unindustrialized country, Communist China needs only manpower, 
small arms and ammunition, small field Pieces, and the necessary. 
transportation. 
As shown in Table 371** both the total population and 
the number of persons in the 15- to 65-year age group of China are 
considerably greater than those of any other country in South Asia. 
Communist China is also overwhelmingly superior over these coun-
tries in the production of light weapons and ammunition. Assistance 
from the Western countries probably could compensate for the deficiency 
of other South Asian countries in small arms production and am-
munitions but the great superiority of Communist China in manpower can-
not be overcome. The terrain and the type of warfare which the Chinese

probably would utilize would, moreover, preclude the use of large 
amounts of mechanized equipment, in the production of which the West 
is superior. . 
Despite the seeming inadequacy of the Chinese economy, 
in terms of the capacity of basic industry, it would be misleading 
to conclude that Communist China does not possess significant capa-
bilities for engaging in defensive, peripheral, and harassing war-
fare. The economy of Communist China possesses more than adequate 
military manpower to substitute for more complex weapons and fire-
power. The limited industry of Communist China has demonstrated its 
capability of mass production of simple but effective light weapons, 
including small arms and light artillery. Logistical support, from 
the economy to the combat zone, can be maintained with the abundant 
manpower (using such devices as the primitive A-frame and carrying 
sticks) and light transport equipment of the Chinese. The economy 
lying behind the Chinese military machine is fully capacle of engaging 
in large-scale land warfare on the Asiatic mainland, in harassment, 
in peripheral encounters, or in defense of its boundaries. 
The Korean War has demonstrated the dependence of Com-
munist China on the USSR for all types of heavy and mechanized equip-
ment, as well as its limited ability to maintain logistical support 
to the front lines for heavy offensive action.

D. Economic Growth, 1953-57. 
There are two principal factors which prevent a forecast 
of economic growth in Communist China through 1957 being made with 
firmness -- the inapplicability of historical Chinese growth trends 
and the necessity for making a series of assumptions with respect 
to the principal parameters which govern future development. . 
Past economic development, unfortunately, provides no reliable 
index to the future. The period from 1950 to 1952 was a period of 
restoration of industrial production to pre-Communist peaks and there-
fore a period of rapid growth over the low level of 1949. Henceforth 
industrial growth will depend primarily upon new plant construction, . 
which in turn will depend upon the amount of capital accumulation 
achieved. The absolute amounts of production achieved from new capa-
city will depend upon the assimilation of Soviet industrial techniques 
by the present Chinese labor force, which has relatively few higher-
level technicians. Moreover, the application of the Soviet system to 
the Chinese environment, under conditions of national unification 
under a strong police-state regime which is firmly committed to in-
dustrialization, makes the only previous period which shows a-trend --
1931 to 1944 -- an inadequate and unsatisfactory criterion by which 
to judge the untried capabilities of the Chinese Communists. 
The approach to the problem used in thisreport is to estimate 
the future production of each important industry on the basis of 
announced Communist goals and of estimates of potential increase of 
production and then to aggregate the projections and compare the result 
with the estimated possible rate of investment (savings) and prospects 
for importing capital equipment. The performance of the USSR during 
the period from 1928 to 1932 in terms of rate of growth and equipment 
imports is used as an analogy. The preliminary individual industry 
projections are not careful forecasts but merely samples to form the 
basis for sector forecasts. Only for agriculture is the forecast a ' 
careful estimate based on the potentialities within the industry. The 
resulting forecasts, therefore, are theoretical projections of esti-
mates of possible growth for the modern industrial sector as a whole 
and for GNP as a whole, but not for any particular industry except agri-
culture. 
The assumptions which are necessary in order to draw cOnclusions 
from this theoretical discussion relate to certain possible difficulties 
of the economic development program of Communist China. The assumptions 
.are as follows:

1. The next 4 years will be a period of relative peace. 
2. There will be no loss of production due to serious 
social unrest or resistance. 
3. The Soviet Bloc will continue to be willing to sell 
capital equipment and technical aid to Communist China, and Communist 
China will be able to pay for such imports. 
4. The supply of skilled manpower -- managerial and 
administrative as well as technical -- will grow as fast as real 
capital: 
5. Soviet technical aid will be sufficient to assure that 
the organizational efficiency of Communist China will grow concomitantly 
with the rest of the economy. 
6. Savings will increase relative to consumption. The 
Chinese CoMmunIsts will not be forced to allocate a higher proportion 
of resources to consumption than planned, because of 
a. Major crop failures. 
b. Increase in population. 
c. The need to provide incentives to agri-
cultural workers in order to maintain or 
increase production. 
Table 38* shows the rates of increase of industrial produc-
tion in China from 1936 to 1943, in 1953, and projected from 1953 
through 1957. Column (1) of this table shows past trends of production 
of certain selected items, which are taken as representative samples 
of the modern industry sector in China. Column (2) shows the official 
plan for 1953, Column (3) the official plan for 1957, and Column (4) 
the preliminary projections based on the trends and plans. 
The targets of the Chinese Communist government announced in 
Pravda seem to indicate a goal of self-sufficiency. Although the 
planned increase in machine tool output is large -- 28.5 percent per 
year -- this item makes up a relatively small portion of total en-
gineering output. It is supposed that general machine output will 
increase at about the same rate as output of mining equipment, for

which a goal has been announced, and that output of electrical equip-
ment will grow somewhat faster than electric power, which has a planned 
annual increase of 15 percent. The production of transportation equip-
ment, an import item, probably will rise at a more rapid rate than 
planned increases in transportation capacity. 
Wherever announced targets of 1957 production were available, 
average annual compound rates were calculated from them and used in 
the projections shown in Table 38. It is estimated that output of 
the textile industry, which is one of the most efficient industries in 
China, will increase slowly. Since 40 percent of the supply of paper 
is imported, it is believed that efforts will be exerted to eliminate 
the necessity for purchasing so much paper abroad. The yearly rates 
of increase from 1954 to 1957 in building materials, chemicals,* and 
mining and metallurgy (excluding coal) are smaller than the announced 
rates for 1953 because it is believed that the initial rate cannot be 
maintained in the 4 subsequent years. Although the past record of 
production of military end items is unreliable as a basis for pre-
dicting a future trend, it has been projected at the approximate 
average rate of 15 percent a year which prevailed from 1940 to 1952 
because of the emphasis the Chinese Communists have placed on pro-
duction of such equipment. The consumption requirements for small 
arms and ammunition have declined as a result of the termination of 
the Korean War, but considerable attention probably will be given to 
attaining self-sufficiency in heavy artillery and similarly complicated 
weapons. 
On the basis of industry-by-industry projections, the pre-
liminary rate of increase of the modern industry sector is estimated 
to be between 12 percent and 18 percent per year for the period through 
1957. 
Growth of industry is generally associated with an increase 
in the supply of real capital, and the rate of growth of the modern 
industry sector in Communist China will be largely determined by the 
ability of Communist China to obtain machinery and equipment from 
industrial countries and to allocate resources to the building of 
plants, buildings, and public utilities. 
In 1952, gross investment through the budget in Communist 
China was about 14 percent of GNP, investment in industry was about

percent greater than in 1952.

Communist China in 1952. Table 40 also indicates that industrial in-
vestment is larger in relation to industrial output in Communist 
China in 1952 than in the USSR in 1928. 
It is a reasonable hypothesis that, of the total amount of 
approximately 34 trillion yuan allocated to gross industrial invest-
ment in Communist China in 1952, about 50 percent* is used for build-
ing factory buildings and other types of structures. Labor and 
materials for this branch of activity are available in Communist China. 
About 17 trillion yuan would then be left for machinery and equip-
ment. Converted into dollars,.this would be about US $736,956,000.** 
Some simple machines probably can be fabricated domestically, but the 
complex machines -- the types of heavy capital equipment -- which are 
characteristic of an industrial society will have to be imported if 
Communist China is to industrialize rapidly. The supply of and the 
demand for Chinese exports will determine the amount and character of 
these import.s, as illustrated by the following figures for 1952: 
Million US $ 
Value.of,exports of Communist China 
in 1952 1,050 
Deduct roughly estimated imports 
of raw materials and consumer 
goods 350 
Balance available for imports 
of capital equipment, etc., 
in 1952 
700 
Since one of the objectives of Communist China is to enlarge 
and modernize its military establishment and Since it does not have 
the capacity to produce many complicated military end items, part of 
the export surplus probably will be devoted to the purchase of.mili-
tary equipment such as airplanes, heavy artillery, and vehicles. 
Because of the priority which the Chinese Communist regime assigns 
to military development, it is assumed that 25 perdent of future im-
ports, not including raw materials and consumer goods, will be devoted

to this purpose, which would leave about US $525 million for machinery. 
Add to this, say, US $60 million per year in the form of credits from 
the USSR, and it can then be said that Communist China will have in 
the neighborhood of US $600 million to spend for capital equipment, 
which will contribute to the future increase of production. 
Since the value of the output of all kinds of machinery in 
the Soviet Bloc is about US $14 billion,* the Bloc presumably can sup-
ply these commodities without great difficulty, if the Kremlin wishes. 
This amount of machinery would be about 4.3 percent of the value of 
Bloc machinery production. Exports of these items by the other.coun-
tries of the Bloc would probably retard their own development some-
what, but the effect would be small. One of the assumptions underlying 
this discussion is that, during the period of this estimate, the rate 
of population growth will not force a decrease in the proportion of 
agricultural production that is exported over present levels. Depending 
on world markets, over-all exports, including the industrial, agri-
cultural, and nonferrous mineral products, may grow to the extent of 
50 percent by 1957 as compared with 1952. Thus Communist China would 
be able to pay for its imports of machinery, and this requirement 
would not be a bottleneck in the industrialization program. Soviet 
policy toward the industrialization of Communist China is nevertheless 
a critical factor in the forecast of the rate of growth. The USSR 
could retard the rate of development through restrictions on the 
volume of capital goods exports to China and through manipulation of 
the terms of trade to the disadvantage of Communist China. 
Table 41** shows that Communist China in 1952 and the USSR in 
1928 were both dependent on imports of capital equipment in their 
industrialization program. In addition, it can be seen in Table 40 
that industry was relatively more important in the USSR when its first 
Five Year Plan was initiated than it is in Communist China today. 
Table 40 also shows that Communist China in 1952 invested proportionately 
4 times as much of its gross product of industry in capital equipment 
as the USSR did in 1928. These comparisons suggest that, if this rate 
of investment continues, the gross industrial production of Communist 
China during the period from 1953 to 1957 could increase at least as 
rapidly as 15 percent per year, the average rate at which gross indus-
trial production increased in the USSR from 1928 to 1937.

modern industry sector is reasonable for the next 4 years, with 
12 percent to 18 percent as a range. If this rate of growth is 
realized, the real output of the modern industry sector in 1957 
probably will be about double that in 1952. 
On the basis of the foregoing estimate for the modern industry 
sector and Table 41,the best estimate that can be made for the other 
sectors, the GNP of Communist China would increase annually at a rate 
between 4 and 5 percent from 1952 through 1957,. or about 26 percent 
for the 5-year period. The probable range would be from 3 to 6 per-
cent per year. A wider range is given for GNP than for industrial 
production because of uncertainties in agriculture. (The Soviet GNP 
increased about 6.75 162/ percent per year from 1928 to 1937.) 
Table 42* summarizes the estimate of the estimated annual 
rate of increase of the GNP of Communist China from 1953 to 1957. 
* Table 42 follows on p. 142.

a. The 1953 plan calls for a 7.4 percent increase in 
railroad capacity over 1952. It is estimated that 
all modern transportation will increase at about the 
same rate through 1957. 
b. This item includes labor force for construction 
projects. It is estimated that the government sector 
will increase faster than the GNP but not so fast as 
the modern industry sector. 
c. It is estimated that trade will increase at about 
the same rate as industrial and agricultural produc-
tion, that food processing will increase as fast as 
increases in agricultural production, and that handi-

d. This is a weighted index (weighted by estimated

Although it is possible that the modern industry sector will 
increase about 15 percent annually through 1957, the industrial base 
of Communist China is so small that at the end of the 5-year period 
it would still be a relatively undeveloped country according to 
Western standards.

V. Regional Distribution of Economic Activity. 
Compared with other nations in their early historical stage of in-
dustrialization, Communist China has a relatively advantageous spatial 
dispersion of economic activity and resources. The modest degree of 
concentration of industrial activity that is apparent in China today 
is in considerable measure a function of the requirements of economy 
from large-scale operation and a slender investment outlay rather than 
a function of the concentration of the available physical resources. 
China has the population and natural resources for a well-dispersed 
and nationally and regionally self-sufficient industrial society. The 
historical pattern of industrial investment has tended to create an 
uneven distribution of industrial capacity by industrial sector and by 
economic region, and the diverse character of foreign investments in 
various parts of China has led to diverse local and regional produc-
tion complexes. The division of modern China into opposed warring 
camps has led to further regional and local dispersal of economic 
activity. This division has also resulted in a significant degree of 
regional autarky. 
The intranational and intraregional dispersal of economic activity 
which obtains in Communist China today may be expected to continue --
indeed, to increase in intensity -- over the period 1952 through 1957. 
The regional ubiquity of dense settlement patterns, of fuel and power, 
and of ferrous metallurgical resources creates a basic condition for 
further regional and local dispersal of economic activity. 
A. General Description.* 
Northeast China (Region I) continues to dominate the 
modern industrial production of China, although its importance to 
China as a whole in this respect probably has diminished somewhat 
since 1936, and its importance has diminished markedly compared with 
1943. Region I has a strong agricultural base, producing about 10 
peient of the food supply, although the region has less than 9

percent of the population. The region exports to the rest of China 
and to the world coal, heavy manufactures, and vegetable seeds and 
oils and receives industrial raw materials, complex capital goods, 
and some textiles and food. 
The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Region II) remains a 
largely undeveloped agricultural region. The region is an exporter of 
animals, animal products, and vegetable oil seeds and oils and is an 
importer of grain and light manufactures. 
North China (Region III) achieves regional prominence as the 
seat of the government and for its agricultural poverty and mineral 
abundance. The area produces a substantial crop of wheat and coarse 
grains but must import large quantities of grain to support its popula-
tion. The exports of the regiOn (besides political controls and edicts) 
are coal, animal by-products, textiles, groundnuts, heavy industrial 
machinery, and chemicals. As the seat of government and military head-
quarters, the national center of education, and a transit area for 
interregional and international trade and transportation, it maintains 
its regional status probably not seriously below the level of economic 
activity and income of the national economy. 
East China (Region IV) has been the historical site of Chinese 
manufacturing, the center of light industry primarily owned and oper-
ated by foreign capital. Today the region remains the center of light 
industry, although its percentage share of this output has been reduced. 
Inward orientation of the Chinese economy has brought with it an effort 
to increase the heavy industrial base of East China and to diversify 
its industrial structure. Region IV has significantly increased its 
percentage share of iron and steel, appliances, shipbuilding, and ma-
chine production, although its percentage share of the textile industry 
has declined. These gains have been made largely at the expense of a 
decline in the percentage share of industrial production in Central and 
South China (Region V). The large urban population of Region IV makes 
it a food deficit area, although it has a rich agricultural hinterland. 
The principal interregional exports of the area are textiles and light 
engineering products. 
Central and South China (Region V) is the principal agricultur-
al region of China and the major mining center of ferroalloying metals 
and nonferrous minerals. The importance of Region V is emphasized by 
the fact that over 4o percent of the Chinese GNP is produced by the 
agricultural industry. Region V is a large exporter of agricultural

? 
commodities, particularly rice, to East and North China. The area 
also exports a significant value of ferroalloys and nonferrous min-
erals. Central and South China has lost a considerable part of its 
1936 percentage share of income from manufacturing, although it has an 
excellent heavy industrial base and a large rather highly concentrated 
population. The sarea is a' net importer of textiles and light manu-
factures and trade services. 
Southwest China (Region VI) has enjoyed a rather meteoric rise. 
in economic. activity in the past 15 years as a result of its position 
as the bastion of the Chinese Nationalists in the Sino-Japanese War and 
World War II. The region of the upper Yangtze is relatively remote 
from the main channels of communication and trade in China. Yet South-
west China has today about 15 percent of the nation's population, a 
largely self-sufficient (in some cases surplus) agricultural sector, 
and the raw material resources as well as some of the productive capac-
ity fora modern industrial economy. The exigencies of a war situation 
compelled an accelerated exploration and development of the Southwest,' 
the result of which was the most rapid rate of economic growth of the 
major regions of China. Region VI is essentially self-contained. It 
exports some agricultural goods, ferroalloy metal concentrates, and 
nonferrous metals and receives in exchange some light manufactures and 
machinery. 
Northwest China (Region VII), like the Inner Mongolia Autono-
mous Region (Region II), is relatively underdeveloped.. Until recent 
years, during which the tempo of exploration and development ofmin-
eral resources has increased, the region was characterized by subsist-
ence sedentary agriculture in its eastern reaches and a nomadic civi-
lization based upon animal husbandry in the west. Cotton culture has 
been rapidly expanded in recent years and cotton Constitutes the prin-
cipal export of the region.. Region VII contains the only proved com-
mercial production of crude petroleum in Communist China. The region 
has the natural resources for at least a modest industrial base, cer-
tainly for an industrial base many times its current level of achieve-
ment. The region is a net exporter of cotton, wool, rare minerals, and 
crude and refined petroleum and. an importer of light manufactures, en-
gineering equipment, and some grain. 
The Tibetan Autonomous Region (Region VIII) has been loosely 
associated with Communist China largely as a result of the latter's 
intervention in Tibetan internal affairs. Little detailed infor-
mation is available about Tibet, which is a land of vast distances

both horizontal and vertical. Most of its area is uninhabitable. 
Some subsistence agriculture is carried .on in the less inhospitable 
mountain valleys on the periphery of the great central highland. 
There is a small surplus of fur, wool, and hides' moved out by 
caravan and exchanged for textiles and light manufactures. 
B. Regional Distribution of Gross National Product. 
The above general description of the regional distribution of 
production and of the regional flow of commodities in Communist China 
is based on estimates of physical outputs for a sample of the major 
produoing sectors (shown in detail in Appendix A, Tables 52 to 62). 
The estimates include, where possible, figures for the years 1936, 
1943, and 1951. 
The year 1936 was selected because it generally represented the 
peak level of the pre-World War II economy. The year 1943 was selected 
because it generally represented the peak level of wartime activity. 
The year 1951 was chosen because it represented the current regional 
picture of Communist China and was susceptible to comparison with other 
regional production available for the Soviet Bloc. In the absence of 
detailed local price quotations, it is impossible to indicate the pre-
cise magnitude of error in the estimates of the value produced in the 
various regions. The error would be relatively small (plus 5 to 10 
percent) in the populous eastern regions, but it might be as large as 
plus or minus 25 percent in the western regions and Tibet. 
An analysis of regional distribution of productive activity 
based upon physical commodity production necessarily omits a wide range 
of productive services. No regional breakdown of regional contribu-
tions to GNP has been made in the fields of transport and trade serv-
ices, and no estimates have been made of the regional distribution of 
government and professional services. Most of these services are a 
function of population and income, which are, in turn, functionally 
related to the commodities of which the production has been regionally 
distributed below. It is believed at this stage that imputation of a 
distribution, of' trade and service expenditures based on the distribu-
tion of physical production in value terms probably involves a smaller 
margin of error than any attempt to distribute the value of these 
activities independently. 
It is necessary first to expand the sample of gross production 
within each sector to the total gross product for the sector. This

step is achieved by use of the production data by industrial sector. 
It may be noted here that the discrepancy between sample sector total 
and sector total is accounted for by production for which no informa-
tion is available to make a regional distribution. The expanded totals 
are set out in Column 1 of Table 43. It is then necessary to net these 
gross totals to eliminate intersector purchases and sales. Essentially 
this procedure consists of an estimate of the value added to the final 
product by the producing or processing sector. Estimates of value 
added by production for each of the sectors used were Obtained and are 
presented as percentages in Column 2 of Table 43. The last column of 
Table 43 represents the net value added by production for each of the 
eleven sectors for which data were available.

The net products Obtained in Table 43 have been entered as 
totals in the last column of Table 44* opposite the appropriate sec-
tor. The totals have then been distributed regionally in the same 
ratio as the gross product of the sector Sample shown in Tables 52 to 
62 in Appendix A. (Engineering production constitutes an exception 
to this procedure in that regional employment indices were used to dis-
tribute the engineering industry product to the regions.) The sector 
products of each region have then been added and each regional product 
divided by the sum of the regional products. The resulting quotients 
have been employed to represent the respective regional shares of 
gross product. 
C. Regional Variations in Per Capita Production. 
A comparison of the regional distribution of economic activ-
ity in Communist China (as roughly indicated in Table 44) with the 
regional distribution of population (shown above in Table 37) shows 
wide variations in the subsistence level as between regions. The 
results of such a comparison are shown in Table 45** and Figure 11.*** 
Examination of North China (Region III) indicates that this 
region supports about 14 percent of the population with less than 
10 percent of the GNP, as represented by the expanded sector samples 
shown in Table 44. According to this calculation, which does not in-
clude government, trade, and transportation services, North China 
Ms a per capita GNP of $36.48 (us $ 1951) compared to a $53.52. 
average for China as a whole. Inclusion of the omitted services. in . 
the regional gross products would probably compensate for a signif-
icant portion of the discrepancy between the North China and the 
national average per capita product, since North China serves as the 
national center of government services (including military head-
quarters and education). Furthermore, the agricultural sector 
product is probably undervalued for North China. An understatement 
of the share of GNP of North China may have resulted from the employ-
ment of average prices for the coarse grain category. The average , ? 
prices of the coarse grain produced in North China are somewhat 
higher than the average prices employed for China. A detailed 
analysis of these differences indicates that the maximum distortion

which could have occurred from the price differentials would result 
in an increase of about 4 percent in the share of North China. 
The relatively high level of per capita GNP in Northeast 
China (Region I) seems intuitively reasonable, although there may be 
a limited element of overstatement of the region's position because of 
its more complete statistical reporting system.. Region I contains a 
highly productive agriculture together with the major concentration of 
Chinese manufacturing industry. 
The per capita GNP of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 
(Region II) appears to be high relative to Northwest China (Region VII) 
whose economy is similar in most respects. Again, the influence of a 
more comprehensive reporting system, largely developed under Japanese 
control over the productive parts of the area, may account for some 
measure of the apparent discrepancy. The relatively lower population 
density in Region II would tend to indicate a higher per capita prod-
uct than would obtain in Region VII. 
The high level of per capita production in the Tibetan Auton-
omous Region (Region VIII) does not seem consistent with available 
knowledge of the area. The data provide the basis only for an 
intuitive comparison with other areas.

Per capita production estimates of the remaining regions ap-
pear to be almost routine in their consistency if the fundamental ag-
ricultural and processing base of the Chinese economy is kept firmly 
in mind. Central and South China (Region V) is the agricultural core 
of the Chinese economy. This region has less variation from optimum 
crop conditions than any other economic region. The area has a 
trading complex almost as great as that of East China (Region IV). 
East China, with a somewhat weaker agricultural base but a stronger 
manufacturing and trade economy, closely approximates the per capita 
position of Central and South China. Regions VI and VII, Southwest 
and Northwest China, respectively, contain the two modern centers of 
Chinese population and agriculture. Both of these regions have sig-
nificantly expanded their role in the Chinese economy. The modern 
program of development, much of it under the impetus of war, has 
raised the per capita product of these remote regions to a level only 
slightly lower than that of the representative regions of the estab-
lished areas of central and eastern China. 
D. Relative Importance of Major Sectors by Regions. 
The present state of research on the regional distribution of 
economic activity in China (as in most Western nations) is not suf-
ficiently advanced to permit a detailed accounting for the origin or 
distribution of regional production by major sector of the economy. 
Section IV, A, above, indicates the portion of Chinese GNP produced by 
major sector of the entire national economy. It is not possible to 
produce comparable data for economic regions because the data which 
supplement the regional contribution already embrace a certain amount 
of production from the services and trade sectors, data which cannot 
be separated without much more detailed information and analysis than 
can be developed on the subject at the present time. 
A division between agricultural production and local processing 
and manufacturing and mining production has been derived from the mate-
rial presented in Table 44 and is included here as Table 46.* Table 46 
purports only. to indicate the relative significance of these two areas 
in each of the concerned economic regions. The dominant role of agri-
culture in comparison with manufacturing and mining in the Chinese econ-
omy is well demonstrated by the data in Table 46. It is important to

note that only Region I (Northeast China) of those with any significant 
element of manufacturing and mining activity has an average per capita 
product in excess of the all-China average.

The estimates of regional product for each of the economic re-
gions should not be construed as definitive in the sense that they rep-
resent an accurate allocation of Chinese GNP by region of origin. It 
is believed that the above estimates constitute an approximation of the 
relative regional distribution of economic activity in China, suffi-
ciently reliable to aid Substantively a further detailed analysis of 
the Chinese economy. 
E. Degree of Concentraiion of Economic Activity. 
The section of the analysis of regional distribution of eco-
nomic activity will be confined exclusively to the location of manu-
facturing and mining activity. Production of specific agricultural 
commodities in China is localized to some extent by the climate, al-

though China with its wide spread of latitude and elevation, its con-
tinental and coastal exposures, possesses almost every known type of 
crop condition. Because of the range of basic agricultural conditions 
available, there are no significant barriers to the production of a 
wide variety of agricultural commodities in large quantities, except 
for quantity production of tropical rain forest commodities. 
The degree of concentration of mining and manufacturing activ-
ity is basically a function of the definition of the measure of con-
centration. Concentration may be measured by three somewhat different 
criteria: (a) the extent of spatial separation of production and con-
sumption of a commodity or series of commodities; (b) the extent of 
spatial separation of productive capacity for a single commodity; and 
(c) the extent of spatial separation of productive activity as a com-
plex. Each of these criteria describes a relevant index of concentra-
tion from the point of view of the capability and/or vulnerability of 
the national or regional economy. 
The economic activity of Communist China in 1951 presents a 
unique condition of highly dispersed economic activity for a nation in 
the present stage of economic development of China. Although there 
exists a modest concentration of economic activity on counts (b) and 
(c) above, this degree of concentration reaches its highest point in 
the Mukden area, which accounts for less than 5 percent of aggregate 
mining and manufacturing production and at its highest point only about 
10 percent of the production of any major sector shown in Table 46. 
The highest concentration of a single commodity in Mukden is 50 percent 
of the machine tool production of Communist China. Anshan contains 
about 60 percent of the ferrous metallurgical output of China. Produc-
tion of chemicals is highly localized at present, but output is low and 
concentration is required to secure an approach to optimum size of 
plant. Much of the apparent concentration of regional output is a 
result of the establishment of workable?size plants in industries which 
are characterized by economies of scale. 
Northeast China (Region I) presently accounts for about 40 
percent of the modern mining and manufacturing activity of China. The 
percentage share of this output produced in Region I has declined 
sharply since 1943. It is also worthy of note that existing levels 
of production in Region I are distributed over several principal pro-
ducing centers within the region, of which the principal one is Mukden.

No country in industrial history other than China has been 
characterized by such a broad (spatially speaking) industrial base at 
such an early stage in the nation's industrial development. The di-
verse foreign concessions in the early industrial history of China, 
the dense settlement pattern over a vast subcontinent, and the division 
of the nation by modern warfare have .all conspired to create a wide-
spread dispersal of manufacturing and mining activity. 
The intranational and intraregional dispersion of economic 
activity which obtains in China today will certainly continue to 
characterize the economy through 1957. The regional ubiquity of coal 
and ferrous metallurgy resources, together with the high population 
densities which characterize the principal economic regions, create 
a basic condition for the further dispersal of industry. Regional 
cost data on the production of coal, iron, and steel are presently 
unavailable. However, if sufficient capital were available it seems 
likely that the program of additional dispersal of manufacturing 
activity might well lead to a reduction in the total cost of production 
of many of the manufactured commodities considered in this report. 
In summary, it may be indicated that China in its early stage 
of economic development has a unique position in that its manufacturing 
and mining activity is highly dispersed. This dispersal seems likely 
to be continued over the period of the estimate.

China are not available. It is, however, possible to calculate sta-
tistics for certain segments of the economy. The Chinese Communists. 
reported that in 1952 the 50X1' 
railroad system originated approximately 131 million metric tons of 
freight, 164/ this being an increase over the 110.5 million metric 
tons originated in 1951 165/ and 99.2 million metric tons originated 
in 1950.-166/. The bulk commoditieS carried in internal rail transport 
in 1952 are estimated to consist primarily of coal (33 million tons), 
timber (4,350,000 tons), iron ore (I1-.Million tons on short hauls),. 
grain (3,750,000 tons), soybeans (2.7 million tons), and quantities 
of raw materials and manufactured goods. In addition, goods moving 
in international trade and military supplies bulked. large in the total 
freight carried. The rail traffic volume was concentrated on the 
north-south and connecting lines in North China and Manchuria. 
For the waterways system, on the Yangtze River alone in 
the first half of 1953, the Chinese reported 2.5 million tons of freight 
transported (this figure not including wooden craft and motor-sail ves-
sels) 167/ Coastal shipping, limited in volume primarily to the northern 
coastal area, carried approximately 3 million tons in 1952, coal beirig 
the principal commodity carried (primarily to Shanghai). 
The accompanying traffic flow maps (Figures 12,13, and 14*) 
are designed to illustrate producing areas, flow, and consuming areas 
for three selected commodities. Except for Figure 12 (showing the flow 
of wheat), only general magnitudes of flow are shown, since the esti-
mates on which the maps are based may have a wide margin of error. 
Figure 12 is illustrative of the flow of most agricultural produce. 
Although the producing areas differ (notably in the cases of rice in 
the Szechuan Basin and along the middle and lower Yangtze, and corn, 
wheat, and soybeans in Manchuria), the flow patterns are Similar in 
that agricultural produce moves primarily over the water network 
wherever possible. This map, taken from prewar data, does not in-
clude Manchuria in its description. At present, most wheat Moves 
into Manchuria through the port of Dairen, as shown by the non-

volume line extended from Shanghai. 
Figure 14 is illustrative of traffic flow over the Chinese 
rail net generally. It also shows the continuing reliance which the 
Chinese place on water transport for coal. Most coal tonnage moving 
southward by rail and destined for Shanghai is transshipped into 
Shanghai by water. Thus, if the coastal route from Chlin-huang-tao 
to Shanghai were severed, readjustment or restriction of other freight 
movements would be necessary in order to move the same volume of coal 
to Shanghai by rail; in such an event, alternative supplies of coal ? 
depending on river transport would probably be used. 
Figure 13 illustrates an entirely new flow pattern com-
pared with the prewar situation. Whereas before the war all Chinese 
petroleum was imported by ship, now rail transport from the USSR and 
production from the Kansu oil field orient the flow pattern from the 
north and west as well as from the east. Petroleum is imported 
through the ports indicated, but specific distribution systems are 
not known.* 
2. Trading Organizations and Controls. 
The Chinese Communist government has steadily expanded the 
socialized control of both domestic and foreign trade through state 
monopoly trading corporations on the wholesale level and cooperatives 
on the retail level. Private-trade, while ostensibly encouraged by 
the government, is completely controlled by the state direction of all 
commodity allocations and prices. 
Effective trade control was established with the adoption 
of centralized trade laws in March 1950. Under these laws the Central 
Ministry of Trade became the center of all state, cooperative, and pri-
vate trade in China and was responsible for "general planning of all 
State and cooperative trade, confirming the plans of economic and 
financial activity of the main State trading corporations ... dis-
tributing working capital and goods for the state trading network, 
establishing State optimum prices, and carrying out public control 
over private trade." 168/ 
Following the splitting up of the Ministry of Trade in 
August 1952 into the Ministries of Commerce and of Foreign Trade, the 
control of the state trading corporations was also split, with purely

domestic organs coming under the Ministry of Commerce and purely 
foreign organs under the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Organs in-
volving both types of trade were reorganized with units under both 
ministries. At present, control of all trade with China is vested 
in 30 state trading corporations. Control of these corporations is 
centered at Peiping, and generally extends out through regional 
centers to cities and provinces. Although the operating organi-
zation is governed by the type of product handled, the organization 
of the General Merchandise Corporation is typical of the organi-
zation of the other corporations generally.* This corporation, 
under the central Ministry of Commerce, is-organized along two 
operating channels: control, or administrative, apd business, as 
below 169/:

* During the first part of 1953, trading corporations were re-
organized with the purely national, regional, provincial triangular 
organization replaced by an organization such as the General 
Merchandise Corporation given above. Indications are that very 
similar reorganizations have taken place in all state trading 
corporations.

S -E-C -R -E -T 
The Provincial Corporations are the administrative con-
trol channel for the main corporation. The Central Wholesale Depots, 
combining the function of former Regional Depots and National Cor-
poration Procurement and Supply Depots, handle procurement, 
processing, pricing, and packaging of local light industrial goods, 
and shipment to provincial and city wholesale depots. These depots, 
in turn, handle wholesaling for local markets, and supplying goods 
for General Merchandise (Retail) Stores within their respective 
areas. Within the three provinces of Honan, Hupeh, and Hunan, the 
Corporation maintains 48 of these General Merchandise Stores. 
? Private enterprise still handles the largest share of 
Chinese Communist domestic trade, although it is heavily controlled 
by the government's fixing of wholesale and retail prices and its 
monopolies of wholesales, storage, and transport media. Private 
trade in China at present is composed of the following: genuine 
private corporations; so-called "private" corporations wherein the 
government holds the controlling stock and which, for all practical 
purposes, are government enterprises; and the individual entre-
preneur, whether storekeeper, wandering peddler, or handicraftsman. 
In the retail field, cooperatives have received much 
government emphasis. In 1952, cooperatives handled 10 percent of 
the total of all state and private retail trade. On the marketing 
side, they handled 60 to 70 percent of all government purchases of 
agricultural products in 1952. ? Organized under the China National 
Federation of Cooperatives, which is supervised by the Ministry of 
Commerce, the cooperative movement reaches through regional and 
provincial federations to county and municipal organs. Cooperative 
growth has been very rapid under the Communists, with 18 million 
Members at the end of 1949 increasing' to 80 million by the end of 
1951 and to 140 million by the end of 1952. However, membership is 
not evenly distributed throughout China, the Northeast, North, and 
East Regions being the most advanced. Members in the Northeast in 
1951, for example, constituted 42.7 percent of the rural and 24 per-
cent of the urban.population, 170/ whereas as late as early 1952 
they constituted only 3.7 percent of the total population of the 
Southwest. 171/ 
3. Domestic Trade as a Source of Government Income. 
The Chinese Communist government places a major reliance 
upon the trading sector of the economy as a means of mobilizing and 
capturing all types of resoures. Resources are appropriated by 
the state in four ways -- through commodity taxation, through

purchase at fixed prices, through charges for government services, 
? and through accumulation of the profits of state trading companies. 
Other than agricultural taxes in kind, commodity 
(excise) taxes are levied at the wholesale level. The rates are 
designed so as to exempt' producer goods and tax consumer necessities 
at a more or less moderate rate but to apply very high rates to 
luxury commodities. Thus in relation to wholesale prices the 
effective commodity tax rate is about 3 percent on wheat flour, 
13 percent on cotton yarn and matches, 30 to 40 percent on wines 
and alcoholic beverages, about 30 percent on'flue-cured tobacco, 
and 55 percent on cigarettes. It is roughly estimated that in 1952 
the state collected about 20 trillion to 25 trillion yuan, 20 percent 
of total revenues, from commodity taxes. 172/ 
Marketing spreads for the government monopolies are kept 
deliberately large so as to insure a high yield for the state in 
trade to the advantage of the state budget and simultaneously to re-
duce the purchasing power of the' population. For example, in Shanghai 
the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation paid _5,250,000 
yuan in 1952 for a bale of cotton yarn bought from industrial spin-
ners 'and then sold it wholesale at 7,450,000 yuan. Since all 
factory-spun cotton yarn must be sold to this corporation, the latter 
was able to earn more than 40 percent on all sales of yarn. .173/ 
The China National Salt Corporation, exercfsing a complete trade 
monopoly, in 1952 bought salt for 1 million yuan per metric ton and 
then sold it for 2.3 million yuan (based on Hankow wholesale price), 
thus realizing 130 percent on all sales of salt. i71/ 
In the field where most Chinese are affected, the China 
National Cereals (Food) Corporation was able to procure grains for an 
average price of 675,000 yuan per metric ton (this average includes 
grain procured as tax-in-kind, valued at 630,000 yuan per metric ton, 
as well as grain purchased at 1 million yuan per metric ton) 175/ and 
sold them for an average price of 1,264,000 yuan per metric ton, thus 
realizing an average of about 45 percent on sales of all grains. 
It can be roughly estimated that in 1952 about 25 trillion 
yuan, constituting approximately half the total net revenue from government enterprises, were derived from state trading. The total profits 
of government enterprises, both national and local, constituted 
29.97 percent of total budget revenues'. 176/

4. Probable Developments in Domestic Trade by 1957. 
State control of trade has been achieved by the Communists. 
Within the next 5 years this control can be little more intensified 
than it is at present. The state monopoly corporations probably will 
emphasize operational efficiency, and any reorganization of the state 
trading program will be oriented along efficiency lines. The coopera-
tive movement probably will continue to grow, according to past 
trends, with the Northwest and Southwest receiving the greatest 
emphasis. Private traders probably will suffer from persecution as 
scapegoats for the government's policy of restricting consumption of 
consumer goods and maximizing state revenues for the benefit of 
its capital investment program. Private trade probably will continue 
to be tolerated under more severe state control, but its share in 
total retail turnovers will probably diminish. The number of state-
controlled corporations probably will increase more gradually than in 
the past 3 years. The trading sector will continue to be a principal 
source of state revenue, with the spread between cost and retail 
selling price adjusted to the government's need for accumulating 
capital, and regulating marketing. 
B. Foreign Trade. 
The commodity composition and geographical distribution of 
the foreign trade of Communist China have undergone a drastic reori-
entation since 1938. The composition of imports has changed from a 
major emphasis on consumer goods and foodstuffs to a pronounced 
emphasis on capital goods, fabricated intermediate industrial pro-
ducts, and industrial raw materials. Substantial exports of textiles 
and fibers have been replaced in part by exports of foodstuffs. 
Otherwise the commodity composition of exports remains substantially 
unchanged. Geographically, Chinese foreign trade has shifted from 
almost 100-percent participation in Western and Japanese markets to 
less than 30-pereent participation in these markets. 
The planned program for industrial development of Communist 
China will continue to require large-scale imports of capital equip-
ment, fabricated intermediate industrial products, and industrial raw 
materials. 
In order to increase exports substantially; Communist China 
will have to find new markets for its agricultural* and industrial

raw materials -- new markets for commodities which are at present 
depressed on the world markets as a whole. China must exchange these 
depressed raw materials largely for industrial hard goods which are 
in relatively high demand in the Bloc, or which must be purchased in 
hard currency areas. 
A summary analysis of the requirements of Communist China for 
capital equipment imports proportionate to the planned industrial 
growth of the country from 1953 to 1957 has been -outlined in Section 
IV, D, above. 
1. Changes in Commodity Composition of Trade. 
The pattern of prewar Chinese commodity trade is shown 
in Table 47.* In general two points stand out: (1). the trade was 
almost exclusively with the West and (2) it consisted of exchange of 
primary products for food, industrial raw materials, and manufactured 
goods. Compared to this the 1953 trade pattern shows two significant 
changes: (1) a reorientation, so that over 70 percent of total 
Chinese trade is now with the Bloc and (2) increasing emphasis on im-
ports of heavy industrial and military items at the expense of food 
and consumer goods. 
The total 1952 Chinese imports can be broken into three 
major categories: imports from the USSR, about 54 percent of the total; 
from the Satellites, about 18 percent of the total; and from the West, 
about 28 percent of the total. 177/ It is believed that the 1953 
division of Chinese imports between the West and the Bloc was about 
the same as 1952, roughly 30 percent and 70 percent, respectively. 
Of the 70 percent of total Chinese imports accounted for 
by the remainder of the Bloc those from the USSR amounted to between 
1,500,000 and 2,000,000 tons, estimated to have been shipped overland, 
and an additional 120,000 known to have moved by sea. These overland 
shipments included some 800,000 to 1,000,000 tons of petroleum, 
150,000 to 200,000 tons of military equipment, and 500,000 to 800,000 
tons of other materials, chiefly iron and steel-, machinery, and metal 
products. 178/ Chinese Communist imports from the rest of the Bloc --
the European Satellites -- amounted to a total of about 670,000 tons. 
This included 400,000 tons of iron and steel, 100,000 tons of machinery 
and vehicles, 95,000 tons of sugar, ammonium sulphate and paper, 
17,000 tons of petroleum and 58,000 tons of miscellaneous items. 179/

Practically all imports from the Satellites cane by ship 
While almost all imports from the USSR came overland. The estimates 
of shipments by sea were compiled from ships' manifests,and the de-
scription of cargoes therein is not in sufficient detail to provide 
accurate value figures. The tonnage figures, however, are probably 
'reasonably reliable. The figures on overland shipments are generally 
speculative in nature, being primarily dependent on consumption and 
production estimates and refugee and repatriate reports. 
Table 48* gives the commodity composition of Chinese Com-
munist trade with NOn-Bloc countries 1950-52. Commodity composition 
of Chinese imports from the non-Communist countries changed substan-
tially during 1953. Raw cotton imports dropped from 43 percent of 
total imports from the non-Communist countries in 1952 to 5 percent in 
1953. During the -same period rubber imports increased from 9 percent 
of the 1952 total to 20 percent in 1953. Iron and steel and machinery 
and metalwares imports increased from negligible amounts in 1952 to 
110,000 tons and 20,000 tons, respectively. Chemical, drug, and paper 
imports from non-Communist countries also showed advances during the 
same period 181/ 
The goods which China has received from the Soviet Bloc 
fall for the most part into the following categories: (1) machinery, 
including communication and transportation equipment, to enlarge China's 
industrial capacity; (2) raw materials and certain chemicals needed in 
refining and smelting processes; (3) agricultural machinery, ferti-
lizer, and insecticides; (4) fabricated iron and steel; (5) petroleum; 
(6) paper; and (7) war material. According to refugee reports, Soviet 
iron and steel is being used on such projects as the Dairen dockyards, 
construction in Harhin, and construction and repair of mainline rail-
roads. 182/ Despite the increased output of iron and steel in Commu-
nist China, requirements for special shapes and high quality materials 
are believed to have necessitated large imports. 
. In addition to iron and steel, shipments of heavy machinery 
and equipment were made to some 50 plants under construction or re-
habilitation pursuant to the Sino-Soviet economic aid agreements, which 
included two blast furnaces, several steel rolling mills, steam and 
hydro power plants totaling some 300,000 kw capacity, and a number of 
mines and machinery and chemical plants. The 1953 trade agreement pro-
vided for Soviet shipments, in addition to the above items, of supplies 
for industry and transport and agricultural machinery. Industrial

Table 48 
Commodity Composition of the Trade of Communist China 
with Non-Bloc Countries 2/ 183/ 
1950-52 
(Continued) 
a. Trade statistics in this table are based on an analysis of the 
trade returns of non-Communist countries trading with China. This 
method of calculating foreign trade is subject to a number of limita-
tions. The major limitation for purposes of this report is the 
difference in commodity and country classifications employed by the 
various "recording countries," thereby making it impossible to de-
termine accurately total trade or its commodity composition. Two re-
porting factors produce an overstatement of Chinese foreign trade. The 
first is connected directly with the unique position of Hong Kong as an 
entrepot for China. Because of the transit nature of the trade of 
Hong Kong, traders in the recording countries tend to list China as the 
source or aestination on their export and import declarations, although 
Hong Kong receives and also records this traffic. This double-counting 
factor was reduced to some extent, for from 1950 to 1951 particularly, 
many Western traders deliberately indicated Hong Kong as the documentary 
destination of the bill of lading but then re-routed the ships to China 
as soon as they were at sea. The second factor, also a result of the 
recording system, is a variation of the double-counting factor. Since 
in many countries trade with Hong Kong and Taiwan and perhaps Macao and 
Korea is repotted as trade with China, shipments that are destined for 
or originate in countries other than China are reported as trade with - 
China. If Countries report Hong Kong trade separately, another 
difficulty arises. The China trade of these recording countries is 
thus understated to the amount of trade that goes through Hong Kong to 
China. Generally, adjustments for these factors are impossible when 
deriving the commodity pattern of trade, although it is possible to 
make adjustments for a few major commodities. The above values have 
thus been adjusted only for FOB and CIF.

imports are believed to have accounted for the remaining tonnage of 
estimated overland shipments. 
While the known 1953 figures are in all cases tentative 
estimates, it is evident that the pattern of Chinese commodity imports 
is now heavily weighted to those goods needed to build and run a grow-
ing heavy industry. With the exception of rubber and cotton, these 
goods are obtained from the Bloc -- primarily the USSR. 
Reflecting the change in source of imports, the export 
trade of Communist China is now primarily directed toward the Soviet 
Bloc. 1953 exports to the Soviet Union Consisted primarily of agri-
cultural products and industrial raw materials. This is a composition 
similar to that of exports tb the West in prewar years. 
As with Chinese imports, its exports to the Bloc can be 
divided between those going overland to the USSR and those going by 
sea to the East European Satellites. Chinese shipments to the USSR 
in 1953 are estimated to have totaled 2.5 to 3.5 million tons. This 
included 1.5 to 2 million tons of agricultural products, and is re-
ported by defectors and refugees as well as Communist press statements 
to have consisted of pork, tea, peanuts, soybeans, peanut oil, wool, 
and: silk. These products and others including tobacco, fruit, jute, 
and hides are included in the 1953 protocol of the Sino-Soviet trade 
agreement. 184/ 
Coal exports 
are even more tentative. 
the Chinese have a contract to supply 
200,000 tons of coal per year from the Fushun coal mine to the USSR. 
In addition, Japanese repatriates have reported that considerable ship-
ments were made to the USSR from other coal mihes in Manchuria. For 
present purposes coal exports to the USSR via overland routes are 
roughly assessed at 500,000 tons, but it is recognized that the volume 
of such shipments may have been very much higher. Refugee reports also 
indicate that cement is another major export commodity in terms of ton-
nage. It is believed that most of the output (180,000 tons per year) 
of the former Soviet-operated cement plant at Dairen is being shipped 
to the USSR, and it is conceivable that additional shipments are made 
from cement plants in northern Manchuria. 
China is a major world producer of tungsten and antimony 
and an important source of tin and magnesite. Most of the production 
of such ores and concentrates is now exported to the USSR. In ad-
dition, the iron and steel industry in Manchuria probably had an ex-

port surplus of several hundred thousand tons of pig iron. Since 
only small quantities of pig iron have been identified as moving by 
sea to the Eastern European Satellites, it may be presumed that large 
quantities are shipped overland to meet steel mill requirements in the 
Soviet Far East. Finally, part of the output of the former Soviet-
operated chemical plant in Dairen is reported to be exported to the 
USSR, but the specific quantity cannot be determined. 
In addition to the above exports to the USSR, the Chinese 
Communists are believed to have shipped by sea about 100,000 tons of 
cargo of an unknown composition to the Soviet Union. during 1953. 185/ 
Total 1953 Chinese Communist exports by sea to the 
Satellites are believed to have amounted to about 770 thousand tons, 
consisting of 360 thousand tons of iron ore, 170 thousand tons of food 
products and the remainder mainly unidentified cargo. 186/ Exports to 
the West fall into a similar commodity pattern. Total exports to the 
West amounted to about $320 million in 1953, which is about 15 percent 
higher than 1952. 
2. Balance of Payments. 
China's total trade in 1953 is estimated to have increased 
by approximately 15 percent over 1952. This represents an increase . 
over the 1952 estimate of more than $300 million. Although part of this 
increase resulted from trade with non-Communist countries, the bulk of 
it was accounted for by an increase in the level of Sino-Soviet Bloc 
trade. Table 49* indicates the changes since 1938 in the value and 
geographical distribution of China's foreign trade. 
Before World War II, practically all the foreign trade of 
Communist China was with Japan and the West. In the 1936-38 period, 
Japan accounted for 40.2 percent of trade turnover and was the major 
trading partner of China. The US accounted for only 13.7 percent. 
After World War II, the West continued to play a major part 
in China's trade. Even in 1950, after the Communists had seized power, 
China's trade with non-Bloc countries was still 74 percent of its total 
trade. In 1951, however, this percentage dropped sharply to less than 
40 percent and in 1952 dropped to 28 percent. It is estimated that, in 
1953, trade with non-Bloc countries remained at approximately this same 
percentage even though it increased in value. 
* Table 49 follows on p. 169,. An index for the fOreign trade of Com-
munist China for the years 1950-52 (1938 = 100) is graphically presented

a. It is probable that Communist China has included in Soviet Bloc 
accounts Western goods imported from or Chinese goods exported to the 
Bloc or carried on Bloc vessels, regardless of origin or final desti-
nation. 
b. 1938 is taken as a representative prewar year. 
c. A rough adjustment of data for price level changes suggests that 
physical volume of trade in 1948 and 1949 was less than half that of 
1938. By 1951, however, physical volume of trade seems to have re-
gained the 1938 level, as the gain in Bloc trade more than offset the 
decline in East-West trade. 
Table 50* indicates that China achieved an export surplus in 
1950 of approximately $50 million after many years of unfavorable trade 
balances. The favorable balance was obtained as a result of an export 
surplus with the Soviet Bloc offsetting a deficit with the West. But 
in 1951 the growing need for Chinese Communist imports to support a 
substantial war effort wiped out this modest surplus. Total Chinese 
Communist imports in 1951 were about 50 percent higher than the exports,

for an estimated net adverse balance of $415 million. Of this balance 
for 1951, more than half, or $215 million, was on Western account. 
The share of the Soviet Bloc in total Chinese Communist 
trade rose rapidly in 1951 under (a) the impact of Soviet exports of 
military goods to China, (b) Western trade restrictions as a result 
of the Korean war, and (c) increased Chinese demands for capital equip-
ment which then could only be obtained from Soviet Bloc markets. 
A statement by Liu King-i, Chinese Communist Deputy Chair-
man of the All-China Federation of Labor, at the Third World Congress 
of the WFTU in Vienna in mid-October 1953, claimed that -the total im-
ports and exports of Communist China were in balance in 1952. It is 
also tentatively estimated that 1953 trade was virtually in balance. 
Trade with both Bloc and non-Bloc countries increased in 
1953 over 1952 but fell short of the announced Chinese plan. The major

shortfall was in imports from the Bloc where the plan called for a large

Chinese trade over the next few years will depend partly 
on political factors, partly on the internal economic policies of 
Communist China and its ability to increase production of export 
commodities, and partly on the line of credit which may be advanced 
by the USSR. Communist China would probably benefit from suspension

of Western trade controls in that a wider range of investment goods 
would be available in larger quantities while Chinese Communist exports 
would remain much the same -- agricultural products and raw materials. 
The primary effect of lifting Western trade restrictions would be in-
creased Imports from the West of certain essential commodities which are 
in short supply in the Bloc such as machinery, antifriction bearings, 
and chemicals. 
The reasonable increase in volume of Chinese Communist trade 
that might be expected to result over the next few 'years would probably 
not amount to more than 50 percent of the 1952 volume with the resulting 
level of trade being at about the same volume of foreign trade as in 1931, 
in terms of constant prices. 1931 trade marked the highest level in the 
last 30 years. It is estimated that soybean and tung oil production can 
be substantially increased during the period despite increased domestic 
consumption of these commodities. Part of the planned increase in coal 
production could be earmarked for export to the Soviet Far East and to 
Japan. If Japan could pay in hard currencies or in materials which 
Communist China needs, possibilities of increased exports of coal, iron 
ore, salt, and soybeans to Japan would be favorable. If need be, export 
of Hainan iron ore could be maintained at the present rate or even in-
creased, despite the desirability of retaining this high-grade ore for 
expanded domestic steel production. Export of tin, tungsten, antimony, 
and magnesite could probably be increased if production were stepped up 
and foreign markets were available. 
Some imports of cotton from Pakistan and Egypt will 
probably continue although the inCreased production of Communist China 
has reduced this need. In Pravda of 28 September 1953, the USSR 
announced its intention to assist the Chinese from 1953 through 1957 
in constructing and equipping 91 new industrial installations and 50 in-
stallations already being built or reconstructed. Thus Communist China 
will probably Import an increasing volume of capital goods and technical 
services from the USSR. Moreover, it is. probable that the Chinese 
Communists will continue to import a. considerable quantity of war ma-
terial.

VII. Balance Sheet of the Korean War. 
A. Credit Side. 
Throughout the entire period of the Korean War the Chinese --
Communist regime has made notable progress in restoring production, es-
tablishing economic controls, and launching a Five Year Plan of economic 
development. This progress has been described in the preceding sections 
of this report. Some of this achievement is apparently attributable to 
the zeal and ruthless determination with which the regime has undertaken 
its organizational tasks in accordance with the Soviet system of regimen-
tation of the entire economy. To the Communist world and to the other 
countries of Asia the Korean War provided a test of the competence of the 
Chinese Communist regime and of the Soviet system both to support the war 
effort and simultaneously to restore production and lay the foundations 
for further economic development under the Five Year Plan,. War necessity, 
therefore, was a stimulus to organizational efficiency in the urgent res-
toration of production in almost all categories to previous peak levels. 
Because of their involvement in the Korean War, the Chinese Communists 
required more support from the USSR, and internal economic conditions in 
Communist China necessitated more severe and rapid organization of man-
power and REricultural and industrial resources than would, have been 
occasioned by the initial planning phase of the industrialization 
program. Soviet technical and military aid was given in ample measure 
to assure the necessary accomplishments. 
A catalogue of the achievements of the joint Chinese Communist-
Soviet efforts could not distinguish between the gains made as a result 
of the working of the Communist organizational system in laying the ground-
work for the industrialization program and those which were derived from 
the stimulus and necessities of the Korean War. It is possible merely to 
list those progressive steps which have been realized as part of the joint 
organizational effort, as follows: 
1. The Chinese Communist regime, with Soviet aid and advice, 
has established internal economic controls sufficient to maintain its 
stability, to reduce to impotence the previously well-entrenched landlord 
and entrepreneurial groups, and at the sane time to extend its authority 
over all of mainland China, Tibet, and Hainan. 
2. The regime has been able with Soviet technical aid to 
restore agricultural and industrial production approximately to previous 
-173-

S-E-C-R-ET 
peak levels, to inaugurate a Soviet-type economic planning system of in-
dustrial development, and at the same time to provide economic support for 
the war effort. The restoration of agricultural production and its more 
even distribution within the country have been particularly significant 
in eliminating dependence on grain imports and in making the country al-
most self-sufficient in cotton fibers. 
3. By an increase of exports and by Use of Soviet credits, 
the Chinese Communists have been able not only to import capital equip.-
ment for the rehabilitation and improvement of their industries but also 
to pay for at least a part of the Military equipment supplied by the 
Russians. 
4. The Chinese Communist railroad transport system and com-
mUnications networks have been sufficiently rehabilitated and improved 
not only to provide better distribution and to serve the political needs 
of the internal economy at its present increasing level of activity but 
also to provide logistical support for Korean War operations. In addition, 
the Chinese Communists have been able to lend some rolling stock and to 
supply thousands of railroad workers to assist North Korean railroad repair 
and maintenance. 
5. The Chinese Communist regime has been able to establish 
its influence in Asia, obtaining recognition of five of the major coun-
tries of Asia -- India, Pakistan, Burma, Ceylon, and Indonesia -- and to 
carry on trade with them. In doing so it has reversed its previous pat-
tern of trade, actually exporting rice -- always a deficit item in 
China -- in exchange for rubber and cotton. The regime has also been 
able to export military supplies to the Communist rebel forces of Ho Chi 
Minh in Indochina to the extent of 2;000 metric tons per month as of 
early 1954, and it has lent help to subversive forces in India and Burma. 
. 6. Communist China has teceived from the USSR -- probably on 
a reimbursable basis -- equipment for a modern air force and heavy artil-
lery,.antiaircraft guns, ammunition, tanks, and trucks sufficient to 
support a progressively increasing combat consumption of such equipment . 
up to the last days before the truce. 
7. Communist china has received from the USSR -- probably on 
a "lend-lease" basis -- quantities Of light military equipment, in addi-
tion to the light arms and ammunition which it provided from its 
own manufacturing resources. These supplies together were sufficient 
to support 1.5 million to 1.75 million men in active combat in the 
field.

8. The Chinese Communist air force, with aircraft and train-
ing officers from the USSR, has received training and combat experience 
in modern warfare, and possibly half of the Chinese Communist ground forces 
have been rotated in service in the war. The Chinese Communists, by their 
record in the Korean War, have established their prestige and pre-eminence 
as a military power in Asia and as an ally of the leading Communist power 
in eliminating Western influence and "imperialism" in'Asial and at the same 
time they have carried out their internal economic rehabilitation program. 
B. Debit Side. 
In the Communist calculation, labor and material goods are expend-
able as long as they are expended for the good of the state. They are 
replaceable, if necessary, by further expenditures of labor and material 
goods. If, according to the Communist rationale, the Korean War has served 
the purpose of building up the power and prestige of the Chinese. Communist 
regime -- as it would appear to have done up to the point of the truce --
the costs to them would have been well spent. Further continuation of the 
war is another matter. 
The Obvious items of costs of Chinese Communist participation in 
the Korean Wax can be easily catalogued, although the definite amounts 
thereof are not so clear: 
1. As mentioned in Section III, above, the budgeted expenses 
for maintenance of the military establishment have increased from US $1.4 
billion, or 4o percent of the budget, in 1950 to US $2.6 billion, or 22 
percent of the budget, allocated in 1953. The increase in absolute amount 
of military maintenance costs is probably largely attributable to the Korean 
War. 
2. Chinese-manufactured light arms and ammunition consumed by 
the Chinese Communist forces in Korea -- although not sufficient to cover ? 
their war needs -- would probably be about adequate for peacetime require-
The war consumption of such materiel probably represents a consid-
erable part of the military budget. 
3. In addition, some hundreds of millions of dollars probably 
have been spent in 1950-52 for modern military equipment imported from the 
USSR. 
4. In Section VI, B, above, the USSR was shown to have supplied 
the Chinese Communists with some quantities of military equipment on a

nonreimbursable, or "lend-lease," basis. At the same time, as Stalin said 
in his speech of October 1952 before the Congress of the Communist Party, 
goods exchanged in international trade between socialist countries are to 
be paid for at prices negotiated in the market, and, as Vyshinsky said in 
the United Nations in December 1952, the USSR is selling munitions to Com-
munist China. It is, therefore, deduced that the USSR probably supplies 
Communist China on a nonreimbursable basis only apart of the total Soviet 
shipment of military goods -- perhaps only such munitions and military 
equipment as were obsolescent or superfluous for use by the USSR -- and 
that new types of equipment, such as jet aircraft, tanks, trucks, heavy 
artillery, antiaircraft guns, and relevant ammunition, are sold to Communist 
China. If this is the case, the magnitude of the cost to Communist China 
of purchasing modern military equipment from the USSR would be an important 
deterrent to continuing or intensifying the war while simultaneously trying 
to implement its Five Year Plan. 
5. The tanks, aircraft, artillery, and trucks which Communist 
China has already received and paid for are ready assets for training and 
for maintenance of the military power and prestige of Communist China in, 
Asia. 
6. At the same time, the development of its armaments industry, 
which is a considerable item in the industrialization of Communist China, 
can be realized only to the same degree as the development of the electric 
power, ferrous and nonferrous metallurgical, and chemicals industries. 
Therefore, concentration on achieving their industrialization goals would 
enable the Chinese Communists sooner to attain a greater degree of self-
sufficiency in armaments production. 
7. Under war conditions in any country the distribution of 
imports, domestic manufactures, and agricultural products must be subordi-
nated to requirements for military transport over the internal railway 
ystem. Diversion of rolling stock in Communist China to troop transport 
and supply of the troops in Korea resulted in faster attrition of railway 
equipment and greater need for replacements than would have been the case 
if only peacetime requirements had ha rl to be met. The same is true of 
motor transport. In addition, a small number of freight cars and several 
thousand trucks sent to Korea were destroyed. If this diversion of trans-
port services to wartime uses were to continue, it would Obviously-handi-
cap the improvement and extension of the rail and motor transport systems 
for industrial development purposes.

8. As discussed in Section VI, B, above, Western trade con-
trols not only have limited the availability of certain types of industrial 
equipment which are in short supply in the Soviet Bloc but also have re-
stricted Chinese Communist markets for their exports. It was estimated 
that the possible expansion of Chinese Communist exports, as a fesult of 
possible relaxation of Western trade controls, might facilitate an increase 
of exports over 1953 to the extent of at least UB $250 million. Now that 
agricultural and nonferrous minerals production has been restored nearly 
to previous peak levels and now that Communist China needs to increase ex-
ports in order to pay for imports of Soviet industrial equipment, the denial 
of this expanded market is probably more important to the Chinese Communist 
regime than it has been in the past. Continued denial of Western markets 
would represent a cost to the Chinese Communist regime in terms of lost sales 
opportunities and possible serious delay in the realization of its indus-
trialization program. 
9. The cost in Chinee Communist human casualties in the war 
has amounted to an estimated 525,000 killed and 390,000 wounded in action. 
These costs in disciplined and more or less trained manpower are proportion-
ately much greater. for a country in the incipient stage of economic develop-
ment of Communist China than for a more advanced country, even though the 
wealth of untrained manpower of Communist China is capable of extensive 
technical training. As discussed in Section I, above, the Chinese Communist 
shortage of technicians and inadequate technical training program render 
more difficult the implementation of the Five Year Plan. This difficulty 
is enhanced by the diversion of the services of transport, communications, 
industrial and medical workers, and their equipment to war purpotes.* The 
availability of these worker for peacetime technical service and training 
purposes would mitigate the shortages of such technicians for the industrial 
development program. the utilization of 
regular army troops on irrigation, land reclamation, farming, railroad, and 
highway construction projects in various parts of Communist China. Besides 
the war casualties and the enhanced need for technicians, the diversion of 
military forces to North Korea and Easikern Manchuria prevents their part- 50X1 
time employment in economic construction work and necessitates additional 
expenditures for employment of more civilian workers on such projects. 
* For example, it was reported that during 1952 hospitals as far south as 
Hankow and Canton were filled with wounded soldiers transported there from 
North Korea under medical care and that Chinese Communist railroad workers 
had to be sent to Korea to assist in the repair and maintenance of North 
Korean railroads.

In weighing, from the point of view of economic policy, the advantages 
and disadvantages to the Chinese Communists of cessation or intensification 
of hostilities in Asia, it is necessary to take a particular moment in time 
-- the present -- on which to balance the choices of alternative uses of 
resources and labor and available material wealth. The costs of the Korean 
War up to this point have been borne and accounted for; the choice now lies 
between allocating resources in the same way or using them more construct-
ively. The possibility that Communist China can carry through the Five 
Year Plan while supporting further military operations of the magnitude of 
1952 in the Korean War or even more intensified hostilities is very doubtful.

APPENDIX B 
METHODOLOGY 
I. Production. 
The data for the production indexes and the GNP estimate for 1952 
are derived from estimates of annual production for an extensive list. 
of commodities. Production data on the Chinese economy ate difficult 
to spcure, particularly for the years from 1937 to 1945 and after 
1949, when the Communists came to power. The systematic derivat;.on 
of production estimates has been omitted from this report, as too 
extensive and complex for publication in its, present state. 
The production estimates given for agricultural production are in 
general more complete and exhaustive than production estimates for the 
other sectors. Estimates for the years after 1937 are more difficult 
to derive, but agricultural outputs are estimated with a range of 
error of plus or minus 10 percent. 
Estimates of output of minerals and metallurgy rank with agri-
cultural production estimates in their general reliability. Diffi-
culties exist in inferring output for the years from 1949 to 1952, 
since in most cases Communist claims for increases for these years 
over previous years and over past peaks must be matched with other 
Information on production for earlier years. 
CIA estimates of manufacturing output have many gaps both because 
of the lack of information for the years from 1937 to 1949 and the 
incomplete coverage of commodities produced. Added to these problems 
is the difficulty in distinguishing between modern manufacturing and 
handicraft output. The estimated increase for modern manufacturing 
may have been offset by decreases in handicraft production, thus 
affecting the validity of the indexes. 
II. Valuation. 
Chinese prices for 1952 were used to weight the estimates of 
physical output. In general, the use of 1952 prices gives greater 
weight to manufacturing Output relative to agricultural output than 
Chinese prices from 1931 to 1936, and greater weight to industrial

output relative to agriculture than 1952 US prices. The 1952 Chinese 
prices, however, represent the best picture of the present allocation 
of economic resources in China. 
Three general sources were used to secure the 1952 prices. (1) The 
Economic Abstracts, FBIS, 190/ give quotations in the wholesale markets 
of various cities in East China, Hankow in Central-South China, and 
Chungking and other cities in Southwest China. Price quotations' from 
North China and from Northeast China are conspicuous by their absence. 
In addition-, these sources include some wholesale prices for Shanghai 
and for Tientsin for consumer items. (2) FDD summaries of newspaper 
price quotations in. Shanghai and Tientsin were available both for pro-
ducer goods and for consumer goods. 191/ (3) The Standard List of 
Commodities published by the Ministry of Fuel is also a source. 192/ 
Many gaps in prices remain after exploiting these sources, both 
in commodities and in regional coverage. The firm data consist of 
city wholesale prices. Crucial questions remain as to the markup 
from the producer level to the wholesale level and between wholesale 
and retail prices. The extent and impact of the present tax system 
on prices is another important gap in our information. 
III. Value Added for Sectors. 
A. Agriculture. 
The list of agricultural commodities was very extensive and 
was taken to be exhaustive of the output of this important sector. 
From the gross value of the 1952 output, valued at estimated farm 
prices, costs were subtracted, including seed, feed, fertilizer, and 
the like. 
B. Minerals and Metallurgy. 
The gross value of commodities for which production estimates 
were available was very nearly complete. In 1936 in China proper, 
miscellaneous minerals such as pyrites, kaolin, fireclay, gypsum, and 
alum, were 15 percent by weight of salt, limestone, fluorspar, and 
antimony, and so 15 percent of the gross value of these commodities 
was taken as the gross value of miscellaneous minerals. For each com-
modity the percentage of gross value that was value added was taken 
from CIA estimates.

C. Modern Manufacturing. 
The gross value in 1952 of sectors within manufacturing a 
to be secured in terms of the commodities for which production data were 
available. Only in the case of engineering output was there a gross 
value estimate for the whole sector, and even this estimate was in terms 
of 1936 prices. A price index was applied to the grbss value of engi-
neering to convert the estimate to 1952 prices. For other sectors 
assumptions had to be made as to the portion of the total value of the 
sector covered by the commodity list. Two procedures were used for 
this purpose: 
1. Labor Force. 
Out of the various labor force estimates, starting from 
the ranges given in CIA estimates, an estimate was made as to the labor 
force in each sector. An over-all total for the labor force in modern 
manufacturing ,was available independently of subtotals, and percentages 
of total labor engaged in each sector were available for China proper 
in 1936 and for Manchuria in 1941. Wherever labor force estimates were 
used, the assumption made was that gross value of output per worker was 
on the average the same in the rest of the sector as for the cOmmodities 
for which gross value was estimated. 
2. Gross Value of Commodities in Relation to Sectors. 
A census of Manchurian industry in 1941 193/ was avail-
able that showed the relationship of the value of the output of in-
dustries -- such as cement or cotton textiles -- to the total value of 
the sectors that include them. This census is considered to reflect . 
more accurately the 1952 gross value relationship for Manchuria between 
the values represented by the commodity lists and the sectors to which 
they belong than a breakdown of labor force data alone. For China 
proper, in the case of textiles, the gross value of relationship to be 
found in Ou Pao San's national income estimates for China in 1933 was 
used. 
Gross value of output of sectors in China proper was 
derived from the value of representative commodities, using proportions 
of labor force employed in the production of listed commodities to total 
labor force of the sectors. While the results are subject to a large 
margin of error, direct valuation of the commodities listed would have 
been an obvious understatement of the value of output, since the same 
was not sufficiently comprehensive.

In general, the percentage of value added in relation to 
gross value given in the census for Manchuria in 1941 was used for 
'estimating value added for modern industry in 1952. This census is _ 
more complete in its classification of commoaities and in its informa-
tion on value added than any other source after 1933. 
Value added for Manchurian industrial output is considered 
as typical of average production conditions for modern manufacturing in 
China as a whole. The 1941 period is more comparable with 1952 both in 
point of time and in terms of economic circumstances than the period 
prior to 1936. 
IV. Transportation, Trade, Government, and Other. 
The State Department, OIR, estimate of value added for the 
'railroads and for other modern transportation was used in this re-
port. 194/ The estimate for the value added by government was also 
substantially the same as.the OIR estimate. 
The first step in estimating value added by trade, food pro-
cessing, and handicraft was to total estimated final sales in the 
producing sectors. This total did not include handicraft output 
other than processed agricultural products. The total was then 
matched against Communist statements of total trade in 1952, and 
the residual was taken as the estimated handicraft output other 
than processed agricultural products. The value of the total sales' 
minus the receipts realized by the producing sectors yielded the 
value added for trade, food processing, and handicraft together. 
This procedure is subject to a large margin of error, but some of 
the possible errors in estimating markups in the sales of commodities 
would affect the relative share of GNP contributed by the producing 
sectors as against trade, food processing, and handicraft and would 
not affect the total GNP itself. 
Supplementary farm income was estimated as a percentage of farm 
income from crops and livestock. 195/ After a rough check of imputed 
rural rent, the OIR estimate was accepted. 196/ The value of personal 
services including domestic help receiving pay was made on the basis 
of estimated labor force engaged in personal services and an average 
income per worker.

V. Cross-Valuation of the GNP of China and of the US. 
The output of goods and services in China in 1952 was valued at 
US prices, and in a very rough way the output of goods and services 
in the US in 1952 was valued at Chinese prices. These procedures give 
two base.s for comparing the GNP of China and the US -- one using US 
prices and one using Chinese prices. The variation between the two 
comparisons was large. Any comparison between the US economy and an 
underdeveloped economy would be likely to have significant differences, 
but for CoMmunist China the comparison is made extreme by the forced 
industrialization program and accompanying price policies. As the 
Chinese industrialization program continues, however, the high prices 
of producer goods that prevailed in 1952 are likely to drop relative 
to agricultural prices. This would have the effect of lowering the 
Chinese yuan valuation of the US industrial sector and therefore in-
creasing the ratio of Chinese GNP to US GNP.
