 23 April 1959
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 EAST-WEST NEGOTIATIONS .  .. . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page I
 The USSR is stepping up its effort to soften the
 Western position and set the stage for its own proposals
 at the forthcoming East-West negotiations.  Moscow has
 charged in notes to Washington and Bonn that measures to
 equip West German forces with nuclear weapons are de-
 signed to confront the "conferences" with a fait accompli.
 The notes are aimed at placing the USSR in a position to
 blame the West for any failure of the talks and to claim
 that such failure would give Moscow no choice but to pro-
 ceed with unilateral actions regarding Berlin and a sepa-
 rate peace treaty with East Germany.  Moscow will probably
 use the 27 April conference of ministers of the Warsaw
 Pact and Communist China to demonstrate bloc strength and
 solidarity.
 MIDDLE EAST HIGHLIGHTS .  .  ?  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 4
 Additional Communist-sponsored mass demonstrations
 in Iraq are maintaining the momentum of the local Com-
 munist effort toward full control of the country.                                 There
 are persistent reports that avowed Communists will soon
 join the Iraqi cabinet.   Additional anti-Communists have
 gone into exile or have been arrested.  The Imam of Yemen
 is undergoing medical treatment in Italy; Crown Prince
 Badr is taking special security measures to prevent the
 overthrow of his regency.  The persistence of tension and
 disagreement within the top army council which governs
 the Sudan appears to make further government changes al-
 most inevitable.
 TIBET SITUATION   .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 7
 Chou En-lai says that Tibet now is completely under
 Chinese control but that mopping-up operations continue.
 Peiping has abandoned its reticence to attack India di-
 rectly and has accused "Indian officials" of abetting
 "vicious attacks on China."        Nehru has criticized the
 Chinese as "brutal" and believes that Peiping's Tibetan
 policy has failed--with a profound effect on Indian and

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 KHRUSHCHEV REACHES SIXTY-FIVE  .  .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 2
 Praise for Khrushchev in a greeting sent him by the
 party presidium on his 65th birthday is reminiscent of the
 "cult of personality" adulation which surrounded Stalin.
 The Soviet premier apparently was not in good health dur-
 ine his visit to East Germany last month.
 KHRUSHCHEV LIEUTENANT APPARENTLY DEMOTEI)    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page
 Khrushchev appears to be carrying his quiet shake-up
 of Soviet officialdom into the highest :Levels of the party.
 Nikolay Ignatov, who had become a member of both the party
 presidium and secretariat since Khrushchev's rise to power,
 has been given the relatively inconsequential job of titu-
 lar president of the Russian Republic, probably signifying
 a sharp setback in his high party career.  This move fol-
 lows closely the demotion of several high-ranking offi-
 cials, including Soviet planning boss Iosif Kuzmin.

 PART II (continued)
 PEIPING'S NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page
 The Second National People's Congress and Peiping's
 new budget for 1959 have reaffirmed Communist China's
 intentions to continue the "leap forward" in economic
 development and social reorganization.  Chou En-lai's
 foreign policy statements were moderate in tone but showed
 no yielding on substantive issues.  The congress was pre-
 sented with a picture of a booming economy, which had
 scored unprecedented advances last year and was bound to
 make bigger end better gains this year.
 NORTH KOREAN - JAPANESE REPATRIATION TALKS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page
 Representatives of the Japanese and North Korean Red
 Cross societies have been engaged in talks since 13 April
 at Geneva on the Japanese plan to repatriate Koreans in
 Japan to North Korea.  The major problem is to negotiate
 a formula which will overcome North Korean objections to
 screening repatriates to make sure they are returning of
 their own free will.  The Kishi government has asserted
 .'
 at Koreans will not be sent back involuntarily.
 SOVIET TACTICS TOWARD JAPAN  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  7
 The USSR is carrying on a campaign to convince the
 Japanese that a "neutral" policy would bring Tokyo sub-
 stantial trade and fishing benefits and greater security
 against the threat of nuclear war.      In a letter replying
 to questions by a Japanese newsman on 20 April, Khrushchev
 reiterated previous proposals for a denuclearized zone in
 the Far East and offered to "guarantee" Japan's neutrality.
 At the same time Ambassador Fedorenko, with an eye on the
 important elections impending in Japan, has energetically
 propagandized for Japanese neutrality in speeches through-
 t t
 ou
 he country.  The Kishi government does not intend at
 present to answer the Soviet proposals.
 TITO PREPARES FOR LONG SIEGE IN DISPUTE WITH BLOC   .  .  .  .  Page  8
 Yugoslavia is digging in for a long struggle with the
 bloc.   Now that the opposing ideological positions have
 crystallized, Tito sees in the controversy many of the
 same irreconcilable differences and Stalinist methods that
 characterized the 1948 dispute.  Belgrade is taking the
 initiative more frequently, and Tito is attempting to use
 the dispute to restore flagging party unity and enthusiasm.
 Tito has recently laid out the future course of the party,
 confidently assuring its members that their struggle with
 the bloc "will be recorded in history as a shining example

 PART II (continued)
 OPENING OF THE FRENCH PARLIAMENT . .  .  .  .  .    .  .  .       .  Page
 French Premier Debrg's government will face the test
 of parliamentary responsibility for the first time since
 De Gaulle came to power when the spring legislative ses-
 sion convenes on 28 April.  Despite Debre's efforts to
 avert a strong resolution on Algerian integration, depu-
 ties from Algeria may force the issue by arguing that
 the current municipal elections there show the necessity
 for integration.  Parliament is also expected to give
 Debr6 trouble on the economic austerity program.  De Gaulle,
 however, has threatened to dissolve Parliament if it tries
 to reassert its previous dominant role.
 BELGIAN POLITICAL CRISIS . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  Page
 King Baudouin last week took the unusual step of
 vetoing the Belgian cabinet's nominee for new governor
 general of the Congo.  This move has undermined the pres-
 tige of generally progressive Congo Minister Maurice Van
 H emeir.jk;. and increased the problems of the Eyskens gov-
 ernment in carrying out the policy announced last January
 for increasing the territory's autonomy by definite stages.
 The veto may also revive latent hostility toward the mon-
 archy which has been dormant since Kind; Leopold abdicated
 in 1950 because of his World War II record.
 THE EUROPEAN COAL-STEEL COMMUNITY   .  .
 .     .     .     .  .  .  .  Page
 A major test of the supranational powers of the Coal-
 Steel Community (CSC) may occur at the meeting of its
 council of government representatives on 4 May.                                                                                                                      In an
 effort to alleviate the present coal glut, the CSC High
 Authority--the executive body staffed by international
 civil servants--is determined to press for production
 quotas effective throughout the six-nation community, a
 plan which the council may reject.  Defeat of the High
 Authority would be a blow to the prestige of the EURATOM
 and Common Market commissions and would encourage those
 critics who want to revise the CSC treaty.
 RIGHTIST REVOLUTIONARY OUTBREAK IN BOLIVIA    .  .  .    .  .  .  Page
 The revolutionary attempt on 19 April by Bolivia's
 perennially plotting rightists apparently was prompted by
 the division of the governing Nationalist Revolutionary
 Movement over the protracted economic crisis.    The criti-
 cal economic situation is likely to continue generating
 tensions which may be reflected in sudden new outbreaks of
 violence by either rightist or leftist elements.  However,
 the government's swift defeat of the rebels and its decla-
 ration of a state of siege may enhance its prestige and
 improve its control of subversion.

 NEW GOVERNMENT TO BE FORMED SOON IN NEPAL  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  13
 Nepal's first government under the constitution pro-
 claimed in February will be formed by the left-of-center
 Nepali Congress party, which won a two-thirds majority in
 the recently completed parliamentary elections.     The new
 government, maintaining a close relationship with New
 Delhi, is likely to pursue modified socialist policies
 internally and to take a neutralist position in foreign
 affairs.                                                                             25X1
 INDIAN CONGRESS PARTY LOSES POPULAR SUPPORT   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page                14
 Prime Minister Nehru's Congress party apparently is
 losing popular support, despite the major economic advances
 India has achieved since 1951 under Congress leadership of
 its First and Second Five-Year Plans.  Recent municipal
 elections in various parts of the country have shown a
 strong trend away from the party, notably in Madras and
 Punjab states, where the Congress party made a good showing
 in the national elections of 1957.
 INDONESIA   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  16
 President Sukarno's departure on a two-month world
 tour has given rise to new rumors of political changes and
 maneuvers which would take advantage of his absence.
 Should significant opposition develop to Sukarno's call
 for readoption of the 1945 constitution, Sukarno with the
 army's backing may impose the constitution by executive
 decree.  Meanwhile, Indonesian negotiations Torizino-
 Soviet bloc military and economic aid continue.

 Socialism has considerable appeal in Latin America,
 where widely supported national parties have made pro-.
 labor legislation and extensive state participation in
 the economy a major part of their programs.                         In five
 countries, national revolutionary parties have gained
 the allegiance of almost all elements which the Commu-
 nists seek to cultivate, and most of them have acquired
 a decided anti-Communist orientation.
 CHANGES IN THE USSR MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS   .  .  .  .  .  Page 9
 During the past six years the USSR Ministry of For-
 eign Affairs has been refurbished into a more effective
 agency for extending Soviet influence throughout the
 world.  A drastic reshuffling of ministerial personnel
 has been carried out by the regime, and a large number
 of former high-level party and government careerists from
 other departments assigned to leading posts within the
 ministry.  Efforts have also been made to expand diplo-
 matic relations.  Unlike his two predecessors, Foreign
 Minister Andrey Gromyko is a foreign policy technician
 rather than a policy maker.  He is not a member of the
 party presidium and has apparently stayed aloof from
 factional politics.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 April 1959
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 EAST-WEST NEGOTIATIONS
 Moscow is stepping up its
 effort both publicly and pri-
 vately to soften the Western
 position and set the stage for
 its proposals at the forthcoming
 East-West negotiations.   In
 similar notes to Washington and
 Bonn on 21 April, the Kremlin
 charged that measures to equip
 West German forces with nuclear
 weapons are designed to confront
 the "conferences" with a fait
 accompli.   By focusing attention
 on this controversial issue,
 the Soviet   leaders   are seeking
 to sharpen differences among
 the Western Allies on the eve
 of the 11 May foreign ministers'
 conference.
 The warning that negotia-
 tions will be  doomed  to  fail-
 ure if Bonn persists in  its
 rearmament program is another
 step in Moscow's effort to es-
 tablish in advance the rationale
 and justification for unilat-
 eral actions regarding Berlin
 and a separate peace treaty
 with East Germany in the event
 the talks fail.
 Recent private statements
 by Soviet officials reflect the
 Kremlin leaders' continuing de-
 termination to gain Western ac-
 ceptance of a summit conference
 regardless of the outcome of
 the foreign ministers' meeting.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 April 1959
 The Soviet counselor in
 Paris told an American official
 on 20 April that one possible
 solution of the Berlin problem
 would be to reaffirm  the rights
 of the three Western powers to
 remain in West Berlin but   to
 withdraw all foreign  troops
 from the city or reduce them
 .to token forces.   Under this
 formula,       the  East Germans would
 exercise  physical  control  of
 access routes,  in accordance
 with a four-power'guarantee of
 free access.  This same Soviet
 diplomat made similar suggestions
 to French and American officials
 in January and February in which
 he minimized the changes that
 would occur after the USSR with-
 draws from East Berlin and im-
 plied that East German controls
 would not be far-reaching,  He
 told an American official on 27
 January that the Western powers
 could keep their troops in Ber-
 lin under an international con-
 trol commission.
 The first secretary of the
 Soviet Embassy in Bonn attrib-
 uted Adenauer's decision to
 seek the  presidency  to  the
 chancellor's conviction  that
 he could  no  longer impose his
 "inelastic" policy on his West-
 ern allies.   This interpreta-
 tion and the official.;'s allusion
 to a relationship between Ger-
 man Foreign Minister Brentano's
 return from Washington and Ade
 nauer's decision to resign the
 chancellorship., suggest Soviet
 confidence that the Western
 powers, under pressure of pub-
 lic; opinion, will move toward
 an accommodation with  Moscow
 on Berlin and Germany.
 The announcement of Vice
 President Nixon's forthcoming
 trip to the USSR, according to
 the Soviet press, has been fa-
 vorably received in the USSR.
 TASS commented that  leading
 circles  in  the Soviet Union
 expect the visit to serve the
 further development of personal
 contacts between government
 heads and improve US-Soviet
 understanding.
 Moscow has resumed propa-
 ganda attacks on the high-al-
 titude American flights in the
 Berlin air corridor, calling them
 deliberately provocative vio-
 lations of flight regulations
 and "blackmail aimed at aggra-
 vating the international situ-
 ation" on the eve of the foreign
 ministers' conference.   Pravda
 added that such acts will -not
 be permitted to go unpunished.
 In line with the Kremlin's
 professed desire to create a
 favorable atmosphere'for ne-
 gotiations, Soviet propaganda
 had :refrained from exploiting
 the air corridor incidents in
 the 'two-week period following
 the Soviet note of protest of
 4 April.   The resumption  of
 propaganda attacks and Pravda's
 implied warning constitute a
 attempt by Moscow to use this
 issue to exploit differences
 among the Western powers and
 may indicate an intention to
 claim, credit if the flights
 are discontinued.
 The USSR has announced
 that the foreign ministers of

 23 April 1959
 the Warsaw Pact powers and Com-
 munist China will meet in Warsaw
 on 27 April to review questions
 to be discussed at the East-West
 foreign ministers' conference.
 Moscow will probably use the
 conference to demonstrate bloc
 strength and solidarity with
 the aim of bolstering the Soviet
 position at the 11 May Geneva
 conference.
 Nuclear Test-Cessation Talks
 Moscow apparently wishes to
 avoid any developments:'in the nu-
 clear test-cessation talks in
 Geneva which might affect ad-
 versely the Soviet posture of
 seeking to create a favorable
 atmosphere for forthcoming ne-
 gotiations on the Berlin-German
 problem.   The American chief del-
 eghte believes the Soviet dele-
 gation is attempting to create
 the impression of progress in
 the negotiations by gradual ac-
 ceptance of noncontroversial ar-
 ticles introduced by'the_United
 States and Britain, while care-
 fully skirting all the difficult
 issues.   The conference now has
 agreed to  ten. draft articles
 and a draft preamble.
 Moscow probably believes it
 can avoid detailed discussion of
 the American plan for an agree-
 ment limited to atmospheric and
 underwater tests, unequivocal re-
 jection of which would detract
 from the Soviet posture of de-
 siring compromise on East-West
 issues.
 East Germany
 Speaking to the East German
 parliament on 16 April, Premier
 Grotewohl categorically rejected
 any solution-. of the Berlin prob-
 lem which would include East Ber-
 lin in a free city under interna-
 tional control.   In line with
 previous Soviet and East German
 official statements, he said ac-
 ceptance of such proposals would
 violate the "sovereignty" of the
 German Democratic Republic (GDR).
 Grotewohl's announcement
 that the GDR "representatives"
 at the foreign ministers' meet-
 ing in Geneva will include For-
 eign Minister Bolz is clearly
 intended to support'.the East
 German claim to full and equal
 participation in the conference.
 The large size and high level of
 the 50-man delegation which will
 reportedly accompany Bolz--in-
 clueling Deputy Foreign Minister
 Otto Winzer and Peter Florin,
 head of the party central com-
 mittee's foreign policy depart-
 ment;--underline the puppet re-
 gime's attempt to present an
 appearance of "sovereignty" at
 the meeting.
 On 17 April the GDR Minis-
 try of Transport requested its
 West; German counterpart to au-
 thorize the transit of an East
 German train, presumably to carry
 its delegation to Geneva at the
 beginning and end of the confer-
 ence!.                                                       The East Germans also re-
 quested overflight rights for
 one GDR plane to fly daily be-
 tween Geneva and Berlin-Schoene-
 feldi airport during the confer-
 ence.   In conformity with quad-
 ripartite views on the matter,
 the West German Transport Minis-
 try has approved both requests.
 The West Germans also intend to
 inform the East German airline,
 Interf lug,  that the Federal Re-
 public will ask the three Allied
 powers for permission to author-
 ize East German planes to fly
 the Berlin air corridor in view
 of the special circumstances.
 Public criticism of the
 Soviet proposal to finalize the
 Oder-Neisse frontier has persisted
 in East Germany, both by the gen-
 eral public and party members.

 Britain
 In the interest of achiev-
 ing Western harmony, Britain is
 endeavoring to soften the clash
 between its own position and
 those of its allies.   In  the
 working group discussions in
 London, the British have sought
 principally to keep open the
 way for a pilot inspection plan
 in central Europe.   British
 ideas on the controversial spe-
 cial security zone nevertheless
 remain unclear--presumably to
 allow for maximum Western flex-
 ibility in East-West negotia-
 tions.
 West Berlin
 Mayor Willy Brandt has in-
 formed American officials that
 he is satisfied with the general
 situation In West Berlin.  He
 said that unemployment is con-
 siderably lower than last year
 MIDDLE EAST
 Iraq
 Additional Communist-spon-
 sored mass demonstrations are
 maintaining the momentum of the
 Iraqi Communist effort toward
 ,full control of the country.
 ,The end of the Peace Partisans
 meetings in Baghdad last week
 was marked by a well-controlled
 parade of an estimated half-
 million marchers, and another
 series of mass rallies in Bagh-
 dad and other centers has been
 called for 24 April to commemo-
 rate the "struggle against im-

 nificant removal of people,cap-
 ital, or industry from the city.
 He emphasized that morale is
 primarily dependent on belief
 in US firmness in retaining
 garrisons and free access, by
 force if necessary.
 Adenauer's decision to run
 for president has had no visi-
 ble effect on Berlin morale.
 Most Berliners doubt there will
 ,be any changes in Bonn's for-
 eign policy, and some regard an
 anticipated introduction of
 "tactical flexibility" as  a
 "positive" development.   Ber-
 lin's political leaders do not
 expect Adenauer's successors to
 do less for Berlin than the
 chancellor--an attitude which
 reflects their belief that US
 policy is the determini atg fac-

 are being organized in the first

 The demonstrations are phys-
 ically managed by individual or-

 control is being handled largely
 by the Communist-dominated Poplar

 Should  these  demonstra-
 tions  result  in any attacks
 on  Westerners or  their prop-

 most              certainly be deliberate
 on  the part of the demonstra-
 tions'  organizers  rather than
 a by-product of excessive en-
 thusiasm.
 Reports persist that a
 cabinet shake-up is imminent,
 involving both  the replace-

 the appointment of new  ones.
 one o  the prospective casual-

 Another  pro-Communist,
 Health Minister Shawwaf, announced
 last week that the USSR, rather
 than Western Europe, will hence-
 forth be the locale for special
 medical treatment for Iraqis,
 and that private hospitals and
 clinics in Iraq will be nation-
 alized.   An American mission
 hospital was taken over some
 time ago by the government.
 Baghdad has announced that
 Kamil Chadirchi, leader of the
 left-wing National Democratic
 party and until recently Prime
 Minister Qasim's principal civil- 25X1
 ian     political  adviser,   will
 go 1:6  Moscow  for  medical
 treatment.
 Chadirchi's de-
 parture                                                                from Iraq,    for what-

 only non-Communist influence
 ever known to have really had
 Qasimm's ear.
 Nasir's latest propaganda
 attacks  have continued  to
 stress  the  anti-Communist
 theme  rather  than  hit Qasim
 directly, and UAR propaganda

 of the Arab papers presented
 have been versions of earlier
 proposals. Lebanon's EmilBustani,
 for example, again submitted
 his plan for the oil-producing
 Arab countries to set aside 5
 percent of their profits for the
 benefit of the "have-not" states,,
 Besides Lebanon, the "have-nots'
 include the UAR and Jordan. Al-
 though Bustani claimed to have
 the support of Kuwait, the re-
 sponse to his speech was not
 warm.
 A UAR delegate apparently
 made the only "political" speech,
 aimed at the United States and
 charging Washington with trying
 to control the Middle East be-
 cause of American oil companies.
 Other UAR addresses were note-
 worthy for their lack of recrim-
 ination and fairly businesslike
 character.
 A mild stir and some con-
 cern was generated by Frank Hen-
 drix, an American who is Saudi
 Arabia's top legal adviser on
 oil matters.   Hendrix sought to
 lay a legal foundation for uni-
 lateral Arab modification or
 elimination of existing petro-
 leum concession agreements. The
 presentation of his thesis,
 which was quickly challenged by
 both Arab and oil-company of-
 ficials, appeared to be largely
 a Saudi skirmish with the Ara
 bian--American Oil Company and. was
 generally unwelcome to the con-
 gress as a whole.
 Saudi Arabia's energetic
 director of Petroleum affairs,
 Abdulla Tariki, and Venezuela's
 minister of mines and. hydrocar-
 bons, Dr. Juan Pablo Perez Al-
 fonzo, appear to have dominated
 the congress.  Tariki pressed
 hard for a new, Arab-owned
 pipeline which would carry Per-
 sian Gulf oil, probably except-
 ing Iraq and Iraq, to the Med-
 iterranean by a route largely
 paralleling the existing Tapline.
 Tar:iki  publicly  agreed that
 there were "grounds" for an oil
 price and production agreement
 between the Middle East and Ven-
 ezuela but did not think action
 could be taken during the con-
 gress.

 23 April 1959
 Crown Prince Badr, who
 has been left in charge of the
 Yemeni Government as chairman
 of a four- or five-man council,
 has taken a number of unusual
 security precautions.
 Considerable maneuvering
 almost certainly will develop
 in Yemen in the Imam's absence.
 A previous report that tribal
 leaders opposed  to  Badr  had
 pledged -that they would remain
 quiet has been denied, and un-
 less the crown prince moves cau-
 tiously he could be faced with
 a revolt. In what may be an ef-
 fort to reduce foreign influ-
 ences--both Western and Soviet--
 the Yemeni Government reportedly
 intends to close diplomatic and
 consular establishments in Sana
 and Taiz and conduct all rely
 tions in Cairo.   The long-dor-
 mant United Arab State--the
 year-old Union of Yemen and the
 UAR--presumably would be used
 as the technical vehicle to
 justify this move.
 Sudan
 Persistence of tension and
 disagreement within the top army
 council which governs the Sudan
 appear to make further govern-
 ment changes almost inevitable.
 Premier Abboud is again reported
 preparing to retire from the
 scene in the f ace of the rest-
 lessness of junior officers
 whose spokesman is the leader
 of the "semicoup" last March,
 Brigadier Shannan.
 A Soviet economic delega-
 tion left Khartoum on 16 April
 without reaching any major agree-
 ments despite two months of ne-
 gotiations, The Soviet delegation
 refused to deviate from the es-
 tablished pattern of Soviet aid
 programs, which the Sudanese re-
 jected because of concern over
 the presence of bloc personnel
 TIBET SITUATION
 Premier Chou En-lai told
 the National People's Congress
 in Peiping that Tibet  now is
 completely  under .Chinese con-
 trol.  He  admitted, however,
 that mopping-up operations were
 continuing in "remote" areas.
 Peiping  later reported  that
 Chinese  forces  control  the
 whole Tibetan frontier north
 of the Himalayas.
 The  Peiping  press on 23
 April  dropped  its  reticence
 to     attack New Delhi direct-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 April 1959
 Although embarrassed and
 undoubtedly bitter over Nehru's
 sympathy for the Dalai Lama,
 the Chinese have so far avoided
 formal actions or statements
 which would further antagonize
 the Indians and to which Nehru
 would be forced to respond on
 a government-to-government ba-
 sis. Chou En-lai,speaking be-
 fore the congress, had toned
 down earlier charges that Kal-
 impong in India's West Bengal
 State was the Tibetan rebels'
 command center o  He also hailed
 2,000 years of friendship with
 India and said there was no rea-
 son why such friendship should
 be shaken by a "handful" of
 rebels.
 Nehru is convinced Peiping will
 not reverse its policy of total
 repression in Tibet, and he
 believes the eventual return
 of the Dalai Lama is out of the
 question.
 India
 will try to keep the Dalai
 Lama
 relatively quiet.  Nehru
 again
 told Parliament on
 20
 April
 that the Dalai Lama
 Is
 free to conduct religious
 activities, but "Political       25X1
 activities are not carried on
 from one country against another,"
 Nehru probably will put
 considerable pressure on the
 Dalai Lama to prevent him
 from carrying out political ac-
 tivities from within India,
 and is likely to ask him to
 seek asylum elsewhere if he
 persists in his present plans.
 High-level committees are
 being set up in India and else-
 where to handle the expected
 flow of Tibetan refugees.  Al-
 though insignificant thus far,
 the exodus probably will in-
 crease and pose further prob-
 lens
 The Chinese Nationalists
 may become more determined
 than ever to demonstrate their
 ability to play an active role
 in the Tibetan revolt as a re-
 sult of the Dalai Lama's fail-
 ure! to mention Nationalist
 China in his 18 April press
 statement or to respond to
 Chiang Kai--shek's offer of
 future "self-determination,"
 Any increased support for the
 Tibetan revolt, however, would
 probably be limited primarily
 to a step-up in Nationalist
 propaganda efforts against the
 mainland, such as a resumption

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 April 1959
 KHRUSHCHEV REACHES SIXTY-FIVE
 Khrushchev's 65th birthday
 on 17 April coincided with an
 unprecedented volume of reports
 and speculation on the state
 of his health, and with strik-
 ing evidence that adulation of
 Khrushchev is beginning to re-
 semble  closely "the cult of
 personality" which surrounded
 Stalin.
 Khrushchev has been on va-
 cation, first in Sochi and lat-
 er  in Yalta, since about 25
 March.   Late last summer and
 early in the fall he was on va-
 cation for six weeks; he appar-
 ently also took time off for
 about two weeks in January of
 this year.   A pattern seems to
 be developing of longer, more
 frequent and probably quieter,
 more restful vacations.
 Khrushchev  leadership aura
 was advanced markedly on 19
 April when the Soviet press pub-
 lished an unprecedented birthday
 greeting sent to him by the
 party presidium.   Soviet leaders'
 65th birthdays are not
 normally noted with
 party greetings.  Some
 of the words chosen
 for the congratulatory
 message were last used
 to describe Stalin at
 the height of the
 "cult of personality"
 period.   The message
 was signed by all full
 and candidate members
 of the presidium ex-
 cept M. G. Pervukhin,
 ambassador to East
 Germany--probably
 signifying that he is
 no longer a candidate
 member.
 The presidium members called
 Khrushchev "elder comrade and
 friend" who ""dedicates all your
 seething energy, wealth of po-
 litical experience, wisdom, and
 daring initiative to the build-
 ing of Communism and the consol-
 idation of the might of the So-
 viet state.... ""   They credited
 to Khrushchev's initiative and
 direction the major political
 and economic innovations taken
 by the ceftral committee in re-
 cent years and acknowledged

 The "election" on 16 April
 of Nikolay Ignatov, a member of
 both the party presidium and
 secretariat, as chairman of the
 Presidium of the Supreme Soviet
 of the Russian Republic (RSFSR)
 appears to be part of a general
 shake-up of Soviet party and
 government officials which has
 been going on for several months.
 Since last December, a number
 of high-ranking fig-
 ures have lost their
 jobs.   These include
 party and government
 leaders in the Turk-
 men, Uzbek, and Belo-
 russian republics and
 Moscow Oblast, as
 well as Soviet plan-
 ning chief Iosif
 Kuzmin.
 In "proposing"
 Ignatov for a hereto-
 fore largely ceremo.-
 hial and politically
 insignificant post,
 party secretary and
 cadre specialist
 Awerky Aristov stressed
 ports were credited with  "dis-
 playing models of creative en-
 richment of the theory of
 Marxism-Leninism,   especial-
 ly  on  questions                                                              of  build-
 ing  socialism  and  Commu-
 nism. "
 since  his  new post    is  a
 full-time  job.
 Aristov's remarks suggest
 some increase in the responsi-
 bilities of the RSFSR Supreme
 Soviet Presidium.   In addition,
 Igr.Latov will probably be called
 on to represent the Soviet Union
 in place of ailing President
 Voroshilov, and he will be in
 line to succeed Voro-
 shilov when the latter
 dies or has to retire.
 Even so,  Ignatov's new
 responsibilities do
 not appear commensurate
 with those he enjoyed
 as party secretary,
 and he has probably
 suffered a political
 reverse.
 Ignatov, now 58,
 had held high party
 posts for many years.
 He did not enter the
 highest levels of the
 hierarchy until after
 Khrushchev's rise to
 ;power, however,  He
 the "great tasks which the Su-
 preme  Soviet of the RSFSR is
 called on to decide" and stated

 PEIPING'S NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS
 Communist China's Second
 National People's Congress--
 which opened in Peiping on 18
 April and is scheduled to meet
 for ten days--has heard a re-
 statement of current policy in
 the major report by Premier
 Chou En-lai and economic and
 budget plans for 1959.   Chou's
 30,000-word report reaffirms
 Peiping's intentions to continue
 its "leap forward" in economic
 development and social reorgan-
 ization and moderates the tone
 of Peiping's foreign policy
 statements. The "election" of
 the new government--including
 Mao Tse-tung's successor--will
 probably not take place until
 the closing sessions of the con-
 gress. Mao, meanwhile, is receiv
 ing homage as. the guiding spirit
 of the regime's past and present
 programs.
 Foreign Relations
 On the subject of China's
 foreign relations, Chou's grand
 display of forbearance--a sharp
 contrast with statements in 1958
 --was clearly intended to dispel
 the notion in the bloc as well
 as the West that the Chinese
 Communists are Stalinists of the
 East. He hoped the peace area
 "already formed" in Southeast
 Asia would last "forever" and
 noted that despite forays into
 China by Surma-based National-
 ist irregulars, Peiping has done
 no more than guard the frontier
 and "remain patient," waiting
 for "friendly" Burma to handle
 the situation on its own. Chou's
 effort to quiet international
 criticism of restrictions on
 freedom in China included a
 call for "hundred flowers" in
 science and art, but he added
 the significant qualification
 that the policy must "serve
 socialism."
 Chou's moderate tone re-
 flects no yielding on substan-
 tive issues dividing Communist
 China and the West.   He applied
 to all countries a principle
 which recently appeared in
 Peiping's propaganda on Japan--
 that is,  "so-called" diplomatic
 relations with Taipei must be
 severed before formal relations
 with Communist China can be
 established,   He made it clear
 Peiping continues to regard the
 United States as its major
 enemy, citing a belligerent state-
 merit of Mao that "the enemy
 rots with each passing day."
 Turning to Tibet, Chou
 to]:.d the congress that the area
 now is completely under Peiping's
 control but admitted that mopping-
 up operations were continuing in
 "remote"regions.
 The Economy
 The congress was presented
 with a picture of a booming econ-
 omy, which had scored unprece-
 dented advances last year and
 was bound to make bigger and
 better gains this year.   The
 1959  plan  gives  every  in-
 dication  of  having  been
 bared  on Peiping's question-

 increases do not appear to re-

 Li said that most of the 24-per-

 come out of increased profits

 90 percent of revenues this year.
 Budget spending will go up
 27 percent.   Direct allocations
 for defense are to increase by
 only 16 percent but constitute
 11.x; percent of total expendi-
 tures, the smallest percentage
 since the Chinese Communists
 came to power.  Additional
 spending on defense is of course
 hidden in other budget cate-
 gories.   The largest increases
 in spending will be a 26-percent
 rise in construction investment,
 a near doubling of the budget
 outlay for bank credits, and
 an increase of more than 200
 percent in allocations for
 foreign aid.   The budget also

 23 April 1959
 The International Commit-
 tee of the Red Cross (ICRC),
 wary of Japan's initial propos-
 al                 that the ICRC screen the
 Korean residents to confirm
 their wishes, invited repre-
 sentatives of the Japanese
 and North Korean societies to
 confer in Geneva.   North Korea
 accepted, probably seeing in
 the talks an opportunity for
 enhanced international standing
 and a chance to exacerbate
 Sleuth Korean - Japanese relations.
 At the conference table, Pyong-
 yang initially rejected the
 Japanese Red Cross proposal
 for even limited !CRC screening,
 and by 20 April a Japanese
 Foreign Ministry spokesman had
 decided that agreement was
 unlikely.   Since then, however,
 the North Koreans have dem-
 onstrated a greater flexibility
 on the issues to be negotiated.
 While it is probable that
 North Korea will eventually
 modify its position on ICRC
 screening, it may not seek an
 early settlement, since im-
 plementation of any agreement
 would reveal that contrary to
 Pyongyang's claims, only a
 small proportion of the Koreans
 in Japan wish repatriation to
 North Korea.   It would also
 settle a grievance which North
 Korea has long used to berate
 the Kishi government.
 For Toyko, the crux of
 the matter apparently is to
 devise a formula which would
 overcome repeated North Korean
 objections to any screening
 procedure and yet not contra-
 vene the Kishi government's
 assertion that none of the
 Korean residents would be re-
 patriated involuntarily. Kishi
 is anxious to demonstrate to
 the Japanese public prior to
 the upper-house elections in
 June that progress is being
 made toward an agreement.
 The Japanese public has
 long sought the removal of as
 many as possible of the Korean
 residents, who are considered an
 undesirable minority.   Somewhat
 in contrast to the seeming fle1zi-
 bility of the Japanese Red Cross
 negotiators in Geneva,  Japanese
 Vice Foreign Minister Yamada
 has reiterated that ICRC screen-
 ing remains an "absolute condL-
 tion" for a repatriation agref.-
 ment and has indicated that
 Tokyo may break off the Geneva
 talks unless Pyongyang drops
 its opposition on this point..
 South Korea claims that
 the status of Koreans in Japan
 can be resolved only through
 bilateral negotiation for an
 over-all settlement of out-
 standing differences between
 Seoul and Tokyo--negotiations
 which Seoul broke off when
 Tokyo announced it would permit
 the 'voluntary repatriation of
 Koreans in Japan to North Korea.
 Seoul has called for a resump-
 tion of the talks, but it has
 since insisted that Tokyo first
 break off the Geneva talks.
 Should Tokyo permit the re-
 patriation of Koreans to North
 Korea, Seoul might be provoked
 into rash counteraction.
 Prime Minister Kishi has
 indicated that a way could be
 found to shelve the repatria-
 tion plan indefinitely, pro-
 vided South Korea adopts a
 reasonable position on the
 problems of the "Rhee line,,
 and detained Japanese fisher-
 men, but President Rhee has
 given no indication that he
 is prepared to modify his
 conditions for an over-all
 settlement.

 23 April 1959
 The USSR is carrying on
 a campaign to convince  the
 Japanese that a "neutral" pol-
 icy would bring Tokyo substan-
 tial trade and fishing benefits
 and greater security against
 the threat of nuclear war.
 Soviet Premier Khrushchev on
 20 April reiterated earlier
 Soviet proposals for a denu-
 clearized zone in the Far East
 and offered to "guarantee"
 Japan's neutrality.   In a letter
 replying to questions by a
 Japanese newsman, he said an
 agreement to this effect could
 be negotiated by Communist
 China,  Japan,  and the USSR,
 and that the USSR would not op-
 pose the entry of the United
 States into such an arrangement.
 The Soviet premier's pro-
 posals, which support  Soviet
 propaganda efforts to arouse
 concern in Japan over the cur-
 rent US-Japanese security treaty
 negotiations, are in line with
 Moscow's vague proposals over
 the past several years for a
 Far Eastern conference.   Prime
 Minister Kishi commented on 21
 April that he found "nothing
 new" in Khrushchev's statements,
 and Tokyo thus far is ignoring
 the proposals.
 Soviet Ambassador Fedorenko,
 with a view to influencing the
 important elections impending
 in Japan,  is attempting to build
 up Soviet prestige in Japan..
 In an effort to counter the un-
 popular effect new Soviet-im-
 posed curbs on Japanese fishing
 would have, he is attempting to
 divert blame to the Kishi gov-
 ernment.   Fedorenko has sought
 every opportunity to extol the
 benefits of neutrality and
 has breathed new life into the
 Communist-dominated Japan-Soviet
 Society.
 Soviet spokesmen have
 vigorously stressed the oppor-
 tunities for trade expansion
 and have repeatedly held out
 the possibility of Japanese
 participation in the develop-
 ment of Siberia.   Fedorenko
 stated on 27 March that the USSR
 is ready to sign a long-term
 trade agreement with Tokyo in
 order to place their trade re-
 lations on a more solid basis.
 Fedorenko's personal cam-
 paign for "neutralization" was
 launched by a Soviet note of 2
 December which advocated Japa-
 nese neutrality and warned that
 small countries with dense popu-
 lations would be annihilated in
 case of atomic war, a warning
 repeated in Khrushchev's letter
 of 20 April to the Japanese news-
 man.   His renewed references to
 this note are probably designed
 to provoke a reply which could
 be exploited by Communist prop-
 aganda during the current se-
 curity negotiations with the
 United States.   On 21 April,
 Foreign Minister Fujiyama stated
 that for the time being Japan
 does not need to reply to the
 note.
 Fedorenko's emphatic af-
 firmation of the Kremlin's
 firm position on the territorial
 issue and a peace treaty, how-
 ever., as well as his solicitude.
 for the Japanese Socialist party,
 are clearly intended to illus
 trate that Soviet concessions to
 the pro-Western Kishi govern-
 ment will not be forthcoming.
 Moscow can be expected to
 follow Khrushchev's proposals
 with further moves  designed'
 to contrast Kishi's policies
 with the advantages of a neutral-
 ly oriented regime.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 April 1959
 TITO PREPARES FOR LONG SIEGE IN DISPUTE WITH BLOC
 Yugoslavia is digging in
 for a long struggle with the
 bloc.      In a recent speech to his
 central committee and in a press
 interview, both commemorating
 the 40th anniversary of the
 Yugoslav Communist party, Presi-
 dent Tito laid out the future
 course of the party, confidently
 assuring its members that their
 struggle with the bloc "will be
 recorded in history as a shining
 example of the party's obliga-
 tions toward its own people and
 the international labor move-
 ment."
 Tito has claimed that no
 real efforts have been made by
 the bloc to discuss its theoret-
 ical  differences with him.   In
 fact, both sides have further
 justified their positions in
 terms of Marxism-Leninism, which
 has widened the breach even fur-
 ther.  Khrushchev declared at
 the Soviet party's 21st congress
 that "socialism cannot be built"
 in a country outside the Commu
 nis"t bloc and that Yugoslavia's
 separation from the bloc endan-
 gers its socialist achievements.
 The Yugoslavs, who believe that
 all nations are moving toward
 socialism but away from blocs,
 aver that "socialism is nobody's
 monopoly," and that Moscow's
 aliti-Yugoslav campaign damages
 only "the Communist camp."
 The Yugoslavs do not, how-
 ever, take a negative view to-
 ward everything in the bloc.
 They believe that all socialist
 countries are facing common prob-
 lems of breaking away from the
 methods of state bureaucratism--
 Stalin's perversion of Marxism--
 "which have continued ... in
 other ... people's democracies."
 Thus they interpret Khrushchev's
 decentralization program as a
 positive step, but complain that
 the bloc has unjustly labeled
 as "'revisionism" Yugoslavia's
 solution of tiese same problems.
 While Belgrade denies it is
 proselyting, its position implies
 that the bloc countries should
 study Yugoslavia's road for so-
 lutions, to their own difficulties.
 The Yugoslav leaders are
 using the bloc's anti-Yugoslav
 campaign and their own "prin-
 cipled positions" as a rallying
 point to bolster flagging party
 unity and enthusiasm.   This
 tactic has been particularly
 evident in recent weeks at party
 congresses in the various repub-
 lics, where party leaders have
 claimed that Yugoslavia's program
 "has thrown new coals into the
 ideological fire of Marxism which
 has been dying since Lenin's
 death."  This theme probably will
 be emphasized further at the four
 other congresses scheduled be-
 tweeri now and June, as well as
 in the various celebrations of
 the party's 40th anniversary
 which, will take place throughout
 the year.
 Tito pledged in early March
 merely to answer the bloc's at-
 tacks "blow for blow," but in
 recent weeks Belgrade has fre-
 quently been taking the initia-
 tive.   Yugoslavia took Nasir's
 side in his dispute with  the
 Arab Communist parties, and it
 charged Communist China with
 causing the Tibetan revolt and
 thus causing damage to the
 "cause of socialism."  Tito him-
 self reportedly urged Nehru to
 take it strong stand against
 Communist China's suppression
 of the Tibetan revolt.   Belgrade
 also criticized Khrushchev's
 21st congress thesis on eco-
 nonIc competition between the
 two "camps" as a call for con-
 tinuation of the cold war.

 OPENING OF THE FRENCH PARLIAMENT
 The first legislative ses-
 sion of the new French Parlia-
 ment, which convenes on 28
 April, will confront Premier
 Debr6 with several major is-
 sues--particularly Algeria,  eco-
 nomic austerity, and the church-
 school question.  Any of these
 could disrupt several parties
 and imperil the premier's coal-
 ition.   President de Gaulle's
 threat to dissolve the assembly
 if it threatens his program,
 however, will probably discour-
 age any early move by the dep-
 uties to reassert parliament's
 traditionally domi-

 on economic matters is limited

 23 April 1959
 BELGIAN POLITICAL CRISIS
 King Baudouin last week
 took the unusual step of veto-
 ing the Belgian cabinet's nom
 inee for a new governor general
 of the Congo.   This move has
 undermined the prestige of the
 generally progressive Congo min-
 ister, Maurice Van Hemelrijk,
 and increased the problems of
 the Eyskens government in carry-
 ing out the policy announced
 last January for increasing the
 territory's autonomy by definite
 stages.
 Van Hemelrijk, who has had
 the strong personal support of
 the prime minister, has been
 pressing ahead with the new
 Congo policy--at times quite
 independently of the cabinet.
 Liberals within the coalition
 think he is going too far too
 fast, while the opposition So-
 cialists attack the policy for
 not going far enough.   His at-
 tempt to replace the present
 governor general was part of his
 effort to strengthen his own
 control over the Congo adminis-
 tration and expedite implemen-
 tation of his program.
 Van Hemelrijk's reform
 policies have stimulated wide-
 spread political interest in
 the Congo':   the white settler
 minority fears for its future
 position, while the Africans
 expect rapid evolution.  If Brus-
 sels seems to waver in support
 of the new policy or if Hemel-
 rijk is eventually forced to
 retire, it would convince the
 natives that the Belgian Govern-
 ment is incapable of living up
 to its promises and increase the
 danger of African nationalist
 disturbances.  The first "Afri-
 can Political Congress," in
 fact, recently called for a Con-
 golese government by late 1961.
 A government usually re-
 signs after a royal veto, but
 Eyskens did not do so in this
 case, and apparently.'persuaded
 Van   Hemelrij.k  to withdraw his
 resignation.  The antimonarchist
 Liberals and the Socialists,

 political controversy among cab-
 inet members.

 persuaded ex-Sing Leopold to. use
 his considerable influence on
 his son to intervene.   Although
 constitutional, the royal veto
 in this case appears political-
 ly dangerous.   Hostility toward
 the monarchy has been only
 slightly below the surface since
 1950, when the Socialists and
 Liberals  forced  Leopold to
 abdicate  because  of  his
 World War II  record. They
 have  remained  suspicious
 of   his    influence over
 Baudouin.
 THE EUROPEAN COAL-STEEL COMMUNITY
 A major test of the su-
 p?anational powers of the Coal-
 teel Community (CSC) may oc-
 cur at the meeting of its coun-
 cil of government representa-
 tives on 4 May.  The CSC High
 Authority--the executive body
 of international civil servants
 --is determined to press its
 plan for a community-wide solu-
 tion to the present coal glut
 --a plan which requires major-
 ity approval by the council,
 including the vote of either
 France or West Germany.   A de-
 feat for the High Authority
 would encourage those critics
 wishing to revise the CSC
 treaty, and possibly reflect
 adversely on the EURATOM and
 Common Market commissions as
 well.
 The High Authority's four-
 point program would cut commu-
 nity production by 3.5 percent,
 reduce imports by 45 percent,
 freeze stocks of unsold coal at
 existing levels, and support
 miners' wages during the cur-
 rent recession.   The High Au-
 thority claims that otherwise
 member countries will act uni-
 laterally, and that further
 'mport restrictions not linked
 to production quotas would jeop-
 ardize the standing of the CSC
 in international trading circles.
 Critics of the plan contend that
 the problems of the coal in-

 Belgium and West Germany, and
 that less drastic remedies are
 provided for in the treaty.
 In recent weeks, however,
 opposition to the High Author-

 At the 10-16 April session of
 the European Parliamentary As-
 sembly, one faction, spearheaded
 by the French Gaullists, intro-
 duced a resolution which recom-
 mended that the High Authority
 invoke  only those provisions
 of the treaty which require unan-

 Vigorously opposed by President
 Finet, this motion was defeated
 at the last minute by the Chris-

 ists when it became apparent
 to the former that the Gaullists
 were attacking the supranation-
 al. concept as a whole.

 23 April 1959
 RIGHTIST REVOLUTIONARY OUTBREAK IN BOLIVIA
 The revolutionary attempt
 on 19 April by Bolivia's peren-
 nially plotting rightists may
 have been prompted by the deep
 division of the governing Na-
 tionalist Revolutionary Move-
 ment (MNR) over the protracted
 economic crisis.  The rightists
 have tried repeatedly to over-
 throw the MNR government since
 it came to power in 1952.  The
 19 April attempt, which resulted
 in several dozen deaths includ-
 ing that of the rightist leader,
 appears to have been better or-
 ganized than other recent ef-
 forts.
 The group evidently hoped
 to profit from the split with-
 in the MNR caused by President
 Siles' efforts to carry out the
 economic reforms--particularly
 in the tin mines--which have
 been a prerequisite for further
 US aid.  About half the armed
 miners had refused to accept
 the reform decree, and the situ-
 ation became more serious on
 16 April when government oil
 workers--employees of the only
 relatively solvent major eco-
 nomic enterprise in Bolivia--
 also defied the government and
 declared a strike.
 The rightist threat tended
 to reunite the government party.
 Oil workers called off their
 strike.   Militias of factory
 workers, progovernment miners,
 and the La Paz party organiza-
 tion appear to have been the
 primary defenders of the govern-
 ment, but at least some of the
 uniformed forces--whose loyalties
 had been considered doubtful--
 were also used.
 The coup attempt also per-
 mitted the government to declare
 a state of siege which gives it
 powers of summary arrest for a
 period of 90 days.   Rightist
 plotting and leftist defiance
 of government decisions had in-
 creased notably since the expir-
 ation of the last state-of-siege
 decree on 19 January.
 80 percent of their salaries.
 The critical economic sit-
 uation, however, is likely to
 continue generating tensions
 which may be reflected in new
 outbreaks of violence.   The
 Central Bank's foreign-exchange
 position shows a deficit of
 about $2,800,000, while the
 country's export earnings on an
 annual basis are not running
 substantially above last year's
 $65,000,000.  Because of the
 virtual suspension of US aid dur-
 ing the past two months, the
 administration since 1 January
 has paid public employees only
 Nepal's first government
 under the constitution proclaimed
 in February will soon be formed
 by the left-of-center Nepali
 Congress party, now greatly
 strengthened as a result of
 winning a two-thirds majority
 in the recently completed parli-
 amentary elections.  The new
 government, guided by the ex-
 ample of the Indian Congress
 party, is likely to pursue modi-
 fied socialist policies internal-
 ly and to take a neutralist po-
 sition in foreign affairs.
 The Nepali Congress  has
 won 73 out of 108 seats in the
 new parliament, with only one
 seat remaining undecided.  The
 countrywide support received
 by the Congress--Nepal's oldest,
 largest, and best-organized
 party--probably resulted from

 its reputation as leader of the
 1950-51 rebellion which over-
 threw the autocratic Rana re-
 gime.   The party's chief leader,
 B. P. Koirala, will most likely
 be called on by King Mahendra
 to form a government, although
 the King might nominate General
 Subarna Shumshere, Congress
 leader who headed the 1958-59
 interim cabinet.
 The parliamentary opposi-
 tion will be dominated by the
 conservative Gurkha Parishad,
 which holds 19 seats.   The Com-
 munist party was able to secure
 only four seats and may concen-
 trate its future efforts on in-
 filtrating the Nepali Congress
 rather than operating independ-
 ently.
 King Mahendra probably will
 find the Congress government,
 with, an overwhelming mandate
 from the people, more difficult
 to control than previous coali-
 tion cabinets.   Party unity is
 likely to be weakened, however,
 by internal rivalries and policy
 conflicts. Moreover, the King
 retains ultimate authority under
 the new constitution.
 Despite long-standing anti-
 Indian sentiment in Nepal, the
 new government probably will
 maintain a close and cooperative
 relationship with New Delhi.
 The  Indians apparently backed
 the Nepali Congress in the elec-
 tions.   Furthermore, general
 reaction in Katmandu to events
 in Tibet continues to be highly
 critical of Peiping.   Reports
 of border incursions by Chinese
 troops in pursuit of fleeing
 refugees are likely to intensify
 concern in Nepal over Peiping's
 intentions and to increase Kat-
 mandu's reliance on Indian Run-
 port.
 INDIAN CONGRESS PARTY LOSES POPULAR SUPPORT
 Prime Minister Nehru's
 ruling Congress party apparent-
 ly is losing popular support,
 despite the major economic ad-
 vances India has achieved since
 1951 under Congress leadership
 of its First and Second Five-
 Year Plans.   This trend, which
 appears in by-elections to the
 national Parliament and the
 state assemblies, is best illus-
 trated by the results of recent
 municipal elections in various
 parts of the country.
 In March and early April,
 the Congress party lost control
 of Madras city and most large
 towns in Madras State,although

 area is one of the most active
 and imaginative in India. Apathy
 on the part of the middle and
 upper classes apparently was
 the major factor which resulted
 in large gains by the Dravidian
 Progressive Federation, a Hindu
 communal party of the lower
 classes.   This party opposes
 domination of South India by
 the "Aryan" north, attacks rule
 by the Brahmin class, resents
 imposition of Hindi as the na-
 tional language, and reflects
 south-north racial friction.
 In Punjab State,  in north-
 ern India, where the Congress
 party had done well in the na-
 tional elections of 1957,  the
 party recently won less than a
 third of 391 seats at stake in
 municipal elections.   During
 1958 the Congress lost heavily
 to various opposition
 groups in municipal
 elections throughout
 Uttar Pradesh State,
 in Rajasthan State,
 and.  16 of 18 munici-
 palities in the north-
 ern part of Bombay
 State.   The party now
 has lost control of
 three of the four
 largest cities in the
 country--New Delhi,
 Bombay, and Madras--
 and controls  the
 fourth--Calcutta--by
 a bare majority.
 Congress party
 leaders have been
 aware since 1956 of
 the need for rejuve-
 nating the party or-
 ganization and  for
 restoring grass-roots
 contacts.   Continued
 awareness   of  the
 problem is shown by
 the fact that, since
 the most recent elec-
 tions, party president Indira
 Gandhi has postponed a sched-
 uled trip to Mexico and declined
 an invitation to London.   She
 reportedly intends to tour In-
 dia on an urgent basis, presum-
 ably to urge an end to factional-
 ism  and apathy among party
 workers.
 Despite the exhortations
 of the party leadership, how-
 ever,  the Congress rank and
 file is not yet "running scared."
 Neither is it captital.izing po-
 litically on the Nehru govern-
 ment's major achievements in
 economic development.   In Madras
 State, where the trend toward
 the opposition was most recently
 illustrated, the Congress party
 government has the best record
 of any state in the country in
 implementing economic develop-
 ment plans.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 April 1951
 President Sukarno's formal
 request on 22 April for a re-.
 turn to the "1945 constitution,"
 which would increase executive
 powers and reduce those of parlia-
 ment, may meet with obstructive
 tactics in the Constituent
 Assembly.   Sukarno has departed
 on a two-month tour of Europe
 and Latin America,  leaving the
 army to act as his watchdog.
 If significant assembly opposi-
 tion to his plans develops,  Su-
 karno with army backing may im-
 pose the constitution by execu-
 tive decree.
 Sukarno's?departure has
 given rise to new rumors of po-
 litical changes and maneuvers
 which would take advantage of
 his absence.   Army Chief of
 Staff General Nasution has
 stated that although various
 groups may attempt action,  he
 believes the army is sufficient-
 ly alert to prevent any develop-
 ments.   He strongly implied to
 American officials that he is
 still working closely with Su-
 karno and, although continuing
 controls on Communist activi-
 ties, has no immediate plans
 fora decisive move against the
 Communists.
 Indonesian purchases and
 aid programs from the Sino-
 Soviet bloc continue.   An army
 purchasing mission, which has
 been shopping in the West and
 Yugoslavia since early March,
 is believed now in Czecho-
 slovakia.   Since the mission
 probably could not obtain in
 the West either the liberal
 credit terms or the quantities
 of materiel it was instructed to
 request,  the bulk of its pur-      25X1
 chases probably will come from
 Yugosla is  Czechoslovakia, and
 PolaLnd .
 An Indonesian mission to
 Communist China left for Peiping
 on 21 April to discuss utiliza-
 tion of $20,000,000 of a $40,000,-
 000 credit extended by China
 last year.   Approximately $11,-
 500,000 of the loan has been
 spent for textiles, and the
 amount now under negotiation has
 also been earmarked for the
 textile industry.   Prime Minister
 Djuanda plans to visit the Soviet
 Union in late June or early July,
 at the invitation of Moscow.
 Although this appears to be pri-
 marily a courtesy visit, Djuanda
 is reported planning to discuss
 present and future aid programs.
 In Sumatra, the Atjehnese
 rebels--a long-standing Moslem
 guerrilla group--are being wooed
 by both the army and the so-
 called Revolutionary Republic of
 Indonesia (PRRI), with both
 groups claiming to have extracted
 promises of cooperation from the
 Atjehnese.   Complicating the sit-
 uation for both the army and the
 PRfI is the fact that Atjehnese
 leaders are involved in a power  25X1
 struggle among themselves which
 makes an early decision on over-
 all Atjehnese alignment unlikely.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 SOCIALIST AND SOCIALIST-INCLINED PARTIES IN LATIN AMERICA
 Socialism has considerable
 appeal in Latin America, where
 widely supported national par-
 ties have made prolabor legisla-
 tion and extensive state par-
 ticipation in the economy a
 major part of their programs.
 In five countries, national rev-
 olutionary parties have gained
 the allegiance of almost all ele-
 ments which the Communists seek
 to cultivate, and most of them
 have acquired a decided anti-
 Communist orientation.   Only a
 few small parties are formally
 designated Socialist, however,
 and these--unlike their Euro-
 pean counterparts--are fre-
 quently Communist aligned.
 Colorado and Radical Parties
 In Uruguay, Argentina, and
 Chile, there are important so-
 cialist-inclined parties which
 had for many years a generally
 laissez-faire attitude toward
 social and economic questions
 and adopted a socialist orienta-
 tion only in this century.   In
 part because of these parties'
 historic position, they have
 been accepted politically by
 the national armies, which have
 a conservative bias and tend in
 Latin America to be the arbiters
 of.the political process.
 Uruguay's Colorado party,
 which controlled the executive
 power for almost a century, is
 generally pro-West and anti-
 Communist but determinedly "in-
 dependent" within this frame-
 work.  The party advocates
 elaborate labor laws, generous
 pensions, and government owner-
 ship and operation of enter-
 prises serving the public.   Its
 failure to provide for rational
 economic development, however,
 caused a general deterioration
 of the country's finances, and
 the party was recently ousted
 by its conservative opponents.
 The Radical parties in
 Argentina and Chile theoret-
 ically advocate a socialist
 policy but neither on reaching
 power has followed a strongly
 socialist program.  The Chilean
 Radical party, the largest
 single party in Chile and dom-
 inant there from 1938 to 1952,
 has advocated evolutionary state
 socialism since 1931.  These par-
 ties draw considerable support
 from the middle class, and their
 efforts to gain labor strength
 have been largely nullified by
 extremist groups, especially the
 Peronistas in Argentina and the
 Communists, who have effective
 parties in both countries.
 The Radicals--like other
 long-established Latin Amer-
 ican political parties--have
 accepted support from the Com-
 munists to win an election, but
 as victors have broken with
 them and cooperated with the
 United States.   The Argentine
 Radical program, for instance,
 has since 1951 stressed nation-
 alization of the petroleum and
 meat-packing industries and
 public utilities, and President
 Frondizi accepted Communist elec-
 toral support.   Since his inau-
 guration,however, he has turned
 on the Communists and stressed
 the need for private enterprise,
 increased foreign investment,
 and reduced state controls over
 the economy.
 National Revolutionary Parties
 The national revolutionary
 parties draw their support mainly
 from the lower urban and rural
 classes, although most party
 leaders come from the middle or
 upper classes.  They are parties
 based in part on a body of prin-
 ciples and a program rather than
 exclusively on a "cult of lead-
 ership" which is often the case
 with Latin American political
 parties.

 Although they

 They seek to learn
 from each other's ex-
 perience, but each
 is based on a strong
 sense of national
 identity and does
 not necessarily copy

 compelled the army to
 accept civilian au-

 war was almost constant for ten
 years, while in Bolivia the ac-
 tual fighting was over in three
 days.   In both, however, the
 leaders had the same object: to
 integrate the largely Indian
 rural population into the life
 of the nation by giving it land,
 education, and the vote.
 In both countries, the
 single most important economic
 enterprise--tin in Bolivia, oil
 in Mexico--was expropriated as
 politically suspect private
 investment.  Nationalization
 was limited in Bolivia but was
 far more inclusive in Mexico.
 Both foreign and domestic
 private investments have been
 encouraged in Mexico, however,
 since World War II and have
 played a large part in its re-

 Both regimes have empha-
 sized economic development,

 came in Mexico after virtually
 all the fundamental social trans-
 formation had been accomplished,

 whereas in Bolivia economic de-
 velopment activities have been
 carried on concurrently with the
 work of redistributing the land
 and rewriting the country's con-
 stitution.
 Both the Bolivian and the
 Mexican revolutionary parties
 initially emphasized the dangers
 of rightist subversion far more
 than the dangers of Communism.
 The leaders of both parties
 have recently become alarmed,
 however, by the apparent success
 of Communist labor leaders in
 breaking government party dom-
 ination of key labor unions.
 Both Bolivian and Mexican party
 leaders are as opposed to So-
 viet as to any other foreign
 intervention in domestic affairs.
 Costa Rica, Peru, Venezu-
 ela:   Costa Rica, Peru, and
 Venezuela have national revolu-
 tionary parties which play key
 roles in these countries but
 they have no monopoly of polit-
 ical power.  The three parties
 are friendly to the United
 States, although all have crit-
 icized alleged US support for
 Latin American dictators.  The
 Peruvian party in its initial
 program in 1924 was strongly
 opposed to the United States;
 this position was reversed dur-
 ing the 1930s, in part because
 of a common antipathy to the
 rise of Nazism in Germany.
 Each of the three parties
 is hostile to the Communists
 and has defeated them for dom-
 inant control of organized la-
 bor.                   The Costa Rican and
 Peruvian parties have consist-
 ently refused to work with the
 Communists on any level and the
 Costa Rican party fought Commu-
 nist-supported forces in the
 civil war of 1948.   In Venezuela,
 students linked with the party
 cooperate with Communist stu-
 dents, but nevertheless the
 election of the party's chief,
 Romulo Betancourt, to the pres-
 idency last December has pro-
 duced a significant stiffening
 against the Communists.
 The parties believe that
 an underdeveloped country
 requires substantial state guid-
 ance.  Their basic concern for
 economic development shows it-
 self in realistic modifications
 of socialist programs.   In Peru,
 the party has long emphasized
 nationalization, but supported
 the 1952 petroleum law--which
 favors foreign investment--when
 conservative landholders op-
 posed it for fear it would drive
 wages upward.
 In Costa Rica, party prom-
 ises to gain considerable con-
 trol over the United Fruit Com-
 pany were modified--after the
 party came to power--~to.increas-
 ing the government's income
 from the company.   In Venezuela,
 the implementation of the na-
 tional revolutionary party's
 plans to set up a government-
 owned oil company has  been
 postponed until the economic
 drain caused by the government-
 owned enterprises set up by the
 preceding regime can be min-
 imised.
 Attitude Toward Communism
 The national revolutionary
 parties have attracted most of
 those who were strongly dissat-
 isfied with a semifeudal social
 and economic organization in
 their countries and who might
 otherwise have been attracted
 by Communism.  Those parties
 which achieved a near political
 monopoly--as in Bolivia and
 Mex:Lco--were so successful in
 this, at least until recently,
 that Communist parties were very
 small, and specifically anti-
 Communist activity appeared un-
 necessary to the national rev-
 olutionary governments.
 In Costa Rica, Peru, and
 Venezuela, where the parties
 have been somewhat less suc-
 cessful, certain opponents of
 the national revolutionary
 parties look on the Communists
 as allies.  The national revolu-
 tionary parties have, consequent-
 ly, acquired a strong basic anti-
 Comununist orientation through
 bitter infighting in such polit-
 ical groups as labor and student
 organizations.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 April 1959
 The similar orientation of
 the parties in these three coun-
 tries is highlighted by their
 cooperation in the Latin American
 drive against dictators which
 received new impetus with Fidel
 Castro's overthrow of Cuba's
 Batista on 1 January 1959. Their
 anti-Communist slant is indi-
 cated by the known concern of
 Costa Rican and Venezuelan party
 leaders--probably shared by the
 Peruvians--over Castro's dem-
 agoguery  and his support for
 pro-Communist groups of anti-
 dictator revolutionaries.

 countries, there are political
 parties which are formally
 called Socialist and inscribed
 as such on national electoral
 registers.  All are essentially
 European in ideological origin,
 and two of them are affiliated
 with the Socialist Internation-
 al.   Except for the Chilean and
 Ecuadoran parties, they are of
 minor political importance.
 In both Chile and Ecuador
 the Socialist parties, in coali-
 tion with other political par-
 ties including the Communists,
 backed the runner-up in the
 last presidential election and
 have significant congressional
 representation.   In both coun-
 tries Socialists and Communists
 together in recent years have
 dominated the country's only
 important national labor
 SECRET
 orgELnization.  The small inef-
 fective Socialist parties of
 Brazil and Peru also tend to be
 Communist-aligned in labor, stu-
 dent, and political affairs.
 In Argentina, the Socialist
 party is anti-Communist.   It has
 no congressional representation
 because of peculiarities in the
 Argentine electoral system.
 Socialist influence is strong
 among urban skilled workers,
 although the party's former
 dominance was reduced by the
 Peron regime's dictatorial
 labor practices.   The Vene-
 zuelan Socialist party, which
 tends toward anti-Communism,
 polled less than 1 percent of
 the total vote in the December
 195EI elections.
 The Uruguayan Socialist
 party is badly split on the
 issue of cooperation with
 Communists in labor; it agrees
 in international affairs in ad-
 vocaLting a "third-force" posi-
 tiort, showing considerable hos-
 tility to the United States.
 The party tries to attract the
 Montevideo working classes, but
 a practical program to appeal
 to these groups has always been
 a monopoly of Uruguay's long-
 dominant Colorado party. Here
 as in most of the Latin Amer-
 ican countries the political
 parties which owe their exist-
 ence to European political
 trends seem likely to give way
 before parties able to empha-
 size a sense of national iden-
 tity.

 CHANGES IN THE USSR MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
 The USSR Ministry of For-
 eign Affairs during Stalin's
 latter years was keyed to the
 negativism of cold war diplomacy
 and was a poor instrument for
 influencing nations and making
 friends for the Soviet Union.
 The process of refurbishing the
 diplomatic machinery began al-
 most immediately with the dic-
 tator's death.   A drastic re-
 shiiffling of ministerial per-
 sonnel was carried out, and a
 large number of former party

 23 April 1959
 countries was divided;  and there
 is a strong possibility that,
 with the recent establishment
 of diplomatic relations with
 Guinea and Ghana, a new African
 division has been created.
 The Soviet Union now main-
 tains 53 embassies, four lega-
 tions, and  permanent  repre-
 sentation to the United Nations.
 The sharp increase in the num-
 ber of foreign missions was the
 product of a coordinated cam-
 paign,  instituted shortly after
 Stalin's death,  to regularize,
 improve, and expand diplomatic
 relations.   Ambassadors or min-
 isters plenipotentiary were ap-
 pointed to countries where So-
 viet intransigence or strained
 relations had left the top diplo-
 matic post vacant, and existing
 legations were upgraded to em-
 bassies wherever possible,
 At the present time   the
 only vacancies in top Soviet
 diplomatic posts are in New
 Zealand and Australia--a result
 of the defection of Vladimir
 Petrov in 1954.   Relations with
 Australia have been re-estab-
 lished, however, and the appoint-
 ment of an ambassador, probably
 to hold both the Australian and
 New Zealand posts simultaneously,
 may soon be made.
 The Soviet Union has almost
 abandoned the legation form of
 diplomatic representation. Le-
 gations are now maintained only
 in New Zealand, Uruguay, Yemen,
 and Luxemburg, and these would
 probably be upgraded to embas-
 sies if agreement  could  be
 reached with the countries con-
 cerned.
 During the past six years
 the Soviet Union has added 14
 countries   to  those with which
 it exchanges diplomatic repre-
 sentation.   Most of this expan-
 sion has been among the newly
 independent countries of Afri-
 ca--Libya, Sudan, Morocco,
 Guinea, and Ghana--and in South-
 east Asia--Indonesia, North
 Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal,and
 Ceylon.  Very little progress
 has been made in Latin America,
 where relations are maintained
 with only three countries--Ar-
 gentina, Uruguay,  and Mexico.
 Soviet officials reportedly are
 expecting diplomatic recognition
 from Costa Rica and possibly
 several other Central American
 republics.
 The Ministry in Politics
 Basic foreign policy and
 the principal tactical moves in
 implementing that policy are de-
 termined by the party presidium.
 The Foreign Ministry is only the
 executor of the specific policy
 tasks assigned it, although it
 presumably has certain advisory
 functions as well.   The intense
 personal interest of all members
 of the top party leadership in
 foreign relations has served to
 keep the ministry under close
 scrutiny and helped to isolate
 its operating personnel from
 factional pressures.  Apparently
 few, if any, of the ministry's
 personnel became embroiled in
 the political maneuvers of
 either former Foreign Ministers
 Molotov and Shepilov.
 Unlike his two predeces-
 sors, Andrey  Gromyko  is  a
 foreign  policy  technician
 rather than a policy maker. He
 is not a member of the party
 presidium and has apparently
 stayed aloof from factional poli-
 tics.   His role in the formula-
 tion of basic foreign policy is
 probably limited to technical
 advice and information.  In this
 connection, Gromyko is known
 sometimes to attend presidium
 meetings.
 The average Soviet career
 diplomat not only has steered
 clear of top party politics, he
 has also been generally success-
 ful in adapting to the demands
 of the regime.   Most of the im-
 portant career diplomats dis-
 placed in the post-Stalin shake-
 up and subsequent reassignments
 have been appointed to  other
 posts within the ministry without

 apparent loss of status. Career
 developments, routine reassign-
 ment, and the shifting locus of
 problems requiring depth of dip-
 lomatic experience appear to
 be among the most important rea-
 sons for these transfers of ca-
 reer personnel.
 On the other hand, the in-
 flux of outsiders into high-level
 positions in the ministry which
 accompanied, and in some cases
 may have precipitated, the trans-
 fer of career diplomats, appears
 to have involved somewhat dif-
 ferent reasons. During the past
 six years about 40 former high
 party officials and government
 administrators have been assigned
 to top diplomatic posts over the
 heads of career workers in the
 ministry.   Some  of  these sub-
 sequently left the ministry for
 other work, died, or simply
 dropped out of sight. The 27
 who remain, however, constitute
 a sizable bloc of the ministry's
 top personnel.
 No single explanation cov-
 ers all the cases of party or
 government careerist turned dip-
 lomatic.   A few, undoubtedly
 victims of high-level inter-
 nal power  politics or  policy
 differences, were assigned to
 the ministry to get them out of
 the way. On the other hand, re-
 vitalization of the foreign serv-
 ice  probably  demanded  new
 bloods
 The regime also appears to
 have re-evaluated its bloc dip-
 lomatic requirements and to have
 instituted a policy of assigning
 to bloc countries men with party
 or government administrative
 experience rather than men trained
 in  the   diplomatic service. In
 a number of cases the necessity
 to exile some party or govern-
 ment figure from the arena of
 power struggle and policy con-
 troversy coincided with a need
 within the ministry for someone
 with party or government experi-
 ence.
 Most of the "outsiders", were
 assigned to bloc countries or
 the headquarters staff of the
 ministry.  A few, however, have
 been assigned to nonbloc coun-
 tries, notably Menshikov to
 India, to  the  United States;
 Pegov to Iran; and Ryzhov to
 Turkey.
 Revitalization of the min-
 istry has been accompanied by
 an enhancement in the prestige
 of diplomatic service.  To a
 certain extent this was a by-
 product of the assignment of
 high-level party officials to
 the ministry, but it has also
 been fostered as deliberate pol-
 icy by the regime. In Stalin's
 time comparatively few Soviet
 diplomats were members of top
 party bodies.   At the time of
 his death only eight were so
 honored, and of these  only

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 April 1959
 Vyshinsky was a full member of
 the central committee3  At the
 20th party congress in February
 1956,  six full members were named,
 and today 19 enjoy the prestige
 of high party rank, eight of
 them as full members of the cen-
 tral committee,
 Personnel Policy
 Major personnel assignments
 within the ministry are the pre-
 rogative, not of the ministry
 itself, but of the party, exer-
 cised by the foreign departments
 in the apparatus of the central
 committee.   The most important
 assignments undoubtedly receive
 the direct attention of Khru-
 shchev and the party presidium.
 The usual procedure is for the
 minister to propose a candidate
 to the central committee for
 consideration.   If the candidate
 were unacceptable to the party
 department concerned, Gromyko
 could appeal the decision to the
 party presidium. Ambassadors and
 ministers plenipotentiary, since
 they are legal representatives
 of the Soviet state, are formally
 appointed by decree of the Su-
 preme Soviet Presidium. Decrees
 on other top assignments in the
 ministry are issued by the Coun-
 cil of Ministers.
 The Soviet diplomatic serv-
 ice has apparently been divided
 into two parts--bloc and nonbloc.
 Personnel rotate within  each
 service but seldom go from one
 to the other.  All top positions
 in the bloc service are staffed
 by former party and government
 officials, and all but two of
 these--Molotov, ambassador to
 Mongolia, and Yury Prikhodov,
 ambassador to Bulgaria--entered
 the Foreign Ministry after Sta-
 lin's death.
 Desk chiefs and in  some
 cases deputy desk chiefs have
 the same rank as foreign mission
 chiefs, and it appears to be a
 matter of policy to rotate top
 personnel from one position to
 the other.   Soviet career dip-
 lomats are generally trained as
 area specialists, but an effort
 is made to broaden their experi-
 ence.   During the course of their
 careers they may expect assign-
 ments   in  several  different
 parts of the world interspersed
 with varied headquarters respon-
 sibilities.
 There does not seem to be
 any standard length of time for
 a. tour of duty for top diplomats.
 Appointments terminated during
 the past six years ranged from
 a few months to nearly nine years.
 Ambassador Malik, who has been
 in London for six years, is the
 diplomat currently the longest
 in his post, but six others have
 been at their current posts over
 five years.   Present Soviet pol-
 icy,  however,  seems to call for
 somewhat shorter tours than was
 the case under Stalin.
 Soviet diplomats carry their
 ranks with them and collectively
 form a pool of talent available
 for specific assignments as the
 need arises.   Quite often a high-
 ranking diplomat will be reas-
 signed to Moscow and not be inden-
 t if :ied for many months or even
 several years, only to reappear
 subsequently in a new post with
 no apparent diminution in sta-
 tus,   It may be assumed that
 their services have been uti-
 lized on special commissions, ad
 hoc committees, or in other ways
 which do not normally receive
 press attention. Ambassador Push-
 kin,  for example, recalled from
 East Germany in February 1958
 and appointed deputy foreign
 minister in March 1959, in the
 interim quite likely helped chart
 Soviet tactics on Berlin.
