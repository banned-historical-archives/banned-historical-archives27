 EARLY WORLD COMMUNIST MEETING NOW APPEARS UNLIKELY
 Moscow's apparent change of attitude may derive
 from concern on the part of some foreign Communist
 leaders about the disruptive effects--in their own
 parties and in the Communist movement as a whole--
 of a formal conference to condemn the Chinese.
 KHRUSHCHEV AND THE MOON RACE
 US press reports have distorted the Import of
 Khrushchev's remarks at a 25 October press con-
 ference, which differ little from views he has
 expressed over the past two years.
 SOVIET DRIVE FOR CREDITS IN THE WEST
 in negotiating new trade pacts and especially in
 contracting for equipment from Western companies,
 the USSR is indicating that purchases will be gov-
 erned by the availability of credit.

 The Soviet leaders appear
 to have decided against calling
 a new world Communist confer-
 ence in the near future.   They
 may have beeen persuaded by talks
 with foreign Communist leaders
 that the disruptive effects of
 a formal condemnation of the
 Chinese, both in some foreign
 parties and in the movement as
 a whole, would outweigh any ad-
 vantages Moscow could derive
 from such a conference.
 Pravda on 28 October sig-
 naled   i s-apparent change of
 Soviet intentions by reporting
 on an Italian Communist Party
 statement.which contained the
 first explicit admission of ma-
 jor foreign Communist opposi-
 tion to a conference.  Although
 the Italians attacked the Chi-
 nese and acknowledged the value
 of  a conference "under certain
 conditions," their statement ex-
 pressed "reservations" about
 the "appropriateness" of holding
 a meeting "in the near future,"
 and said that such a gathering
 could only further intensify
 differences or adopt an "unsat-
 isfactory compromise."  On 30
 October Moscow radio noted a
 joint statement by the French
 and Dutch parties which also
 denounced Peiping and endorsed
 a conference "at a suitable
 time."
 Khrushchev's press conference
 remarks on 25 October also im-
 plied a decision not to proceed
 with a conference at this time.
 In contrast to Soviet pronounce-
 ments in September and the first
 half of October which appeared
 intended to lay the basis for
 a formal indictment of Peiping,
 Khrushchev confined himself to
 renewing the appeal for a ces-
 sation of polemics.  He said,
 "Let time determine which point
 of view is more correct."I
 Although the Soviet leaders
 have carefully avoided any pub-
 lic commitment to a new con-
 ference, the US Embassy in Mos-
 cow concluded in mid-October
 that they were moving toward
 convening a meeting, but with
 considerable misgivings.   As
 late as 23 October, Moscow
 broadcast a summary of a major
 Kommunist editorial (released to
 the press on 18 October) which
 warned that if steps were not
 taken "in time" to defend the
 "general line" of the world
 Communist movement from the
 "line of Mao Tse-tung," the
 consequences for the entire
 movement "may be very grave."

 The Communist World
 had pledged support to the Soviet
 party and had condemned Peiping.
 In contrast to Peiping's
 lobbying earlier in the year
 for an international meeting
 which it probably believed
 would provide a forum to ex-
 press its views, the Chinese
 apparently now recognize that
 the effective Soviet exploita-
 tion of their rejection of the
 test ban treaty has weakened
 their position.   On 27 October,
 the Chinese press reprinted
 a statement of the New Zealand
 Communist party terming such
 a meeting premature at this
 time.   Several members of this
 solidly pro-Chinese party re-
 cently completed a tour of China,
 and the statement probably was
 worked out with Peiping.
 Recent Chinese pronounce-
 ments, like the Soviet ones,
 are somewhat more ambiguous in
 tone and less aggressive than
 earlier statements.   In an
 interview with the chief of
 Reuters in Peiping on 13 October,
 Chou En-lai struck a moderate
 note concerning the dispute.
 The fourth installment--pub-
 lished on 21 October--of the
 Chinese serial reply to the
 Soviet open letter of 14 July
 is not so abusive an attack
 as the previous three articles,
 although it leaves no doubt
 concerning Chinese views of the
 Soviet position on the "national
 liberation struggle."  Peiping's
 rebroadcast on 30 October of
 a month-old Albanian diatribe
 against Khrushchev, however,
 makes it clear that the Chinese
 have not forsworn abuse.
 If the Soviet leaders have,
 in fact, decided to forego or
 at least postpone a conference,
 this would not preclude some
 demonstration of solidarity
 by pro-Soviet parties during
 the forthcoming Bolshevik Revo-
 lution anniversary.   An Italian
 Communist journalist in Moscow
 has indicated that a meeting
 of pro-Soviet parties from 7 to
 15 November will draw up a draft
 program for submission to the
 Chinese as a precondition for
 a conference and will consider
 rejection of this draft by the
 Chinese as tantamount to self-
 exclusion.from the Communist
 movement.

 It would be very interesting to take a trip to the moon. But I cannot
 at present say when this will be done. We are not at present planning
 flights by cosmonauts to the moon.  Soviet scientists are working on this
 problem.  It is being studied as a scientific problem, and the necessary
 research is being done.
 I have a report to the effect that the Americans want to land a man
 on the moon by 1970.  Well, let's wish them success. We shall see how
 they will fly there, how they will land on the moon, and, more important,
 how they will start off and return home. We shall take their experience
 into account, We do not want to compete with the sending of people to
 the moon without careful preparation.
 It is clear that no benefits would be derived from such a competition.
 On the contrary, it would be harmful as it might result in the destruction
 of people. We have a frequently quoted joke: He who cannot bear the
 earth any longer may fly to the moon.  But we are al I right on earth.  To
 speak seriously, much work will have to be done and good preparations
 made for a successful flight to the moon by man.
 April 1962 - Interview With Publisher Gardner Cowles
 Cowles: Mr. Chairman, what date can you predict- for a Soviet manned
 flight to-the moon and back?
 Khrushchev: I-cannot give any date, as it has not been decided yet.
 Your President, the head of a nation where, as you put it,
 everything is decided by private enterprise, has already
 announced his plan for sending a man to the moon.  But we,
 though we have a planned socialist economy, have not
 decided this yet.
 A manned flight to the moon, you see, raises many
 different problems.  It will cost a lot to fly to the moon and
 back.
 Cowles: Would you like this to be a joint project by the Soviet Union
 and the United States of America?
 Khrushchev: We would welcome this.  The Soviet Union has no aims of
 conquest in general and with regard to the moon in particular.
 In principle, we could pool our efforts--material, technical,
 and scientific--and jointly develop a ship-for a flight to the
 moon.  Our scientists are, of course, working in this field.  I
 have heard them; they have good ideas, calculations.
 In answering a question as to when the USSR would send a man to the
 moon, Khrushchev stated that there was no fixed schedule yet for landing
 a Soviet citizen on the moon and explained:
 It is not a question of getting him on the moon, but of getting
 him off again.  Our national emblem is already on the moon,
 but we don't want to place a coffin beside it. We are now
 studying the possibilities of such a flight, but I can't yet say -
 when it would. be scheduled. We can fly a man to the moon,
 but the difficulty is getting him away from there. We can
 now take off from the earth and land again.  If we compare
 our development to yours, we believe it is a more important
 development. We remember Darwin's theories on the
 evolution of the species--from those which crawled, like
 reptiles, to those which- jumped and those which flew. Well,
 you are still in the jumping stage, while we have already
 learned to fly and land again.  But that is still insufficient.
 We still have to learn how to land on other planets, and then
 to take off from them and return to earth.

 race, which differ little from
 views he has expressed over the
 past two years (see opposite
 page).   Soviet scientific offi-
 cials, moreover, deliberately
 voiced similar views to Western
 scientists earlier this year,
 alleging that Soviet scientists
 regard manned lunar missions as
 unfeasible, at least for the
 time being.
 The questions Khrushchev
 answered were submitted in ad-
 vance, and it must be assumed
 that he had some specific pur-
 pose in mind--perhaps several--
 in commenting on the Soviet lu-
 nar program at this time.  He
 may have felt it necessary to
 reassure Russian consumers that
 the regime is not spending large
 sums on nonproductive projects.
 He may also have intended to
 further his objective of retard-
 ing the pace of the arms and
 technological race in order to
 relieve the pressures on Soviet
 resources.  His downgrading of
 the urgency of a manned lunar
 landing was probably aimed at
 influencing US Congressional
 and public opinion concerning
 the cost and pace of the US
 lunar program.  And, he may
 The USSR has been energeti-
 cally pursuing a space program
 which includes lunar exploration.
 Indications are lacking, however,
 of a high-priority lunar land-
 ing program. Military and space
 expenditures have imposed a
 heavy financial burden and have
 grown at a considerably faster
 pace than the economy as a
 whole.  Pursuit of a high-
 priority manned lunar landing
 program would aggravate and
 prolong the present period
 of serious economic strain.
 If the USSR is not now
 trying to land a man on the moon
 in advance of the US Apollo
 schedule, then Khrushchev is
 trying to discount any American
 achievement in advance, as well
 as to delay it.  Even then, he
 would probably try to sustain
 Soviet prestige with  attempts
 to carry out earlier, less ex-
 nensive, but impressive proj-

 SOVIET DRIVE FOR CREDITS IN THE WEST
 The USSR is pressing its
 Western suppliers of equipment
 for credits, and the European
 satellites are following its
 lead.   In negotiating new trade
 pacts and especially in con-
 tracting for equipment from
 Western companies (which seek
 government guarantees for the
 extension of credit), the USSR
 is indicating that purchases
 will be governed by the avail-
 ability of credit.
 The Soviets are not only
 seeking more credits but are
 also asking for longer terms.
 To finance their large pur-
 chases of technologically ad-
 vanced equipment in 1960-61,
 the Soviets--with only minimal
 debts to the free world at that
 time--were able to make satis-
 factory arrangements.   Since
 then, credits with terms up to
 five years--and in some cases
 slightly longer--have been ex-
 tended for purchases of about
 $1 billion worth of plants and
 machinery.
 The USSR has failed to
 develop adequate exports to
 balance its import requirements,
 however.   In fact, its inability
 to export grain to Western Eu-
 rope next year will cut further
 into its foreign exchange earn-
 ings.   Exports of raw materials
 for fertilizer production may
 also fall off; Denmark already
 has been told potash would not
 be available in 1964.   The ne-
 cessity to repay earlier credits
 is tending to nullify the effect
 of newly acquired medium-term
 credits and requires Moscow to
 seek to defer payments for cur-
 rent purchases for ten or twelve
 years.   This year the Soviets
 have received about $300 mil-
 lion worth of credits; their
 repayment obligations during
 the year total about two  thirds
 of this amount.
 There appears to be no
 slackening in the Soviet de-
 mand for Western industrial
 goods, and thus the require-
 ment for credits is growing.
 Soviet economic negotiations
 abroad and the activities of
 Soviet trade representatives
 in Western Europe suggest that
 the USSR may increase its em-
 phasis on the purchase of chem-
 ical and  petrochemical plants
 and equipment.   The Khrushchev
 program to support agriculture
 by stepped-up imports of equip-
 ment continues to be stressed.
 such purchases may be at the
 expense of other imports.
 NATO countries are dis-
 cussing a new common policy on
 credits to the bloc, covering
 primarily the question of du-
 ration.   The consensus appears
 to be to continue limiting cred-
 its to five-year terms.  How-
 ever, the UK and Canada are
 balking at precisely defined
 curbs.   There is some concern
 about the magnitude of credits
 extended, but limitation has
 not been proposed.   The policy
 under discussion permits ex-
 ceptions to meet competition
 from countries not adhering to
 the agreed policy.   This loop-
 hole could be important to the
 USSR should any of the major
 industrial countries not sub-
 scribe to the agreement.

 Communist China, whose
 assistance in past years has
 been extended primarily in
 Asia, now is offering increased
 economic aid elsewhere.   So
 far this year, all its offers
 of such assistance, totaling
 $90 million, have been extended
 to Middle Eastern and African
 countries--Algeria, Syria, and
 the Somali Republic.
 About two thirds of China's
 estimated $1.75 billion in aid
 offers since 1953 have been
 made to the Far Eastern satel-
 lites--North Vietnam, North
 Korea, and Mongolia.   Offers to
 non-Communist Asian countries
 began in 1956 with cash gifts
 and credits to Nepal, Indone-
 sia, and Cambodia and reached
 a peak in 1961 with an $84-
 million long-term credit to
 Burma for economic development.
 The most recent offers to non-
 Communist Asian countries were
 in 1962--a total of $15 million
 in credits to Ceylon and Laos.
 Peiping's aid to African
 countries--Guinea, Ghana, Mali,
 Somali Republic and Algeria- -
 has totaled about $140 million
 since 1960.   Offers to these
 countries, as well as to Yemen
 and Syria, appear to have been
 motivated by a desire to main-
 tain a Chinese "presence" in
 the face of Soviet aid or to
 exploit what the Chinese be-
 lieved were favorable local
 conditions.
 China's substantial assist-
 ance to Albania in 1961-62 as
 well as the very recent dis-
 aster relief donated to Cuba
 probably stemmed from political
 considerations in Peiping's
 ideological dispute with Mos-
 cow.   The Chinese have extended
 about $325 million in aid to
 these countries, including a
 long-term credit to Cuba in
 1960.
 Although Chinese aid proj-
 ects in Communist countries
 appear generally to have been
 implemented according to sched-
 ule, drawings on Chinese credits
 outside the Communist bloc have
 been spotty.   To date, projects
 under long-term Chinese credit
 arrangements in a large number
 of non-Communist countries have
 progressed slowly, partly be-
 cause of delays in recipient
 countries.   Of a total of $180
 million in long-term credits
 extended in Africa and the
 Middle East, so far only about
 $25 million are known to have
 been drawn, about half accounted
 for by Yemen.   Drawings by
 North Vietnam, North Korea, and
 Mongolia against China's esti-
 mated $1 billion in economic
 aid probably have reached about
 70 percent, but of the $275
 million offered to non-Communist
 Asia, only about 25 percent
 has been drawn.

 INDONESIA VERSUS MALAYSIA
 While Indonesia's covert
 and propaganda operations
 against Malaysia have continued
 unabated, the new nation's
 defenders are rallying politi-
 cal and military support.
 In Sarawak and Sabah mili-
 tary clashes on a larger scale
 than heretofore may soon occur,
 inasmuch as both Indonesian and
 UK-Malaysian forces in the
 border areas are being built
 up.   A platoon of 42 Indonesian
 raiders made contact with Brit-
 ish-led forces on 24 October.
 Indonesian hostility is ap-
 parently having a unifying effect
 within Malaysia.   Daily patriotic
 rallies and effigy-burnings of
 Indonesian President Sukarno and
 Indonesian Communist leader
 Aidit are being held throughout
 the new federation.   On 27 Octo-
 ber, the largest demonstration
 of its kind was held in Kuala
 Lumpur by the Chinese Chambers
 of Commerce backed by 60 Chinese
 organizations.   This was the
 first anti-Indonesian rally
 organized and attended almost
 exclusively by Chinese; pre-
 viousdemonstrations were
 dominated by Malays.
 State Prime Minister Lee

 SOVIET RELATIONS WITH IRAQ AND SYRIA
 The USSR has moved slowly in
 recent weeks to improve its rela-
 tions with Iraq.   In response to
 Iraqi initiatives, Moscow  re-
 sumed military shipments and now
 has had withdrawn from the UN
 agenda Mongolian charges of gen-
 ocide based on Iraq's campaign
 against its rebellious Kurds.
 However, Moscow turned down a
 proposed visit by Iraq's foreign
 minister and has kept up a vigor-
 ous propaganda campaign against
 the "antirational" Baathist regime
 Moscow had continued cautiously
 to maintain good relations with
 Syria's Baathist rulers until
 their military union with Iraq
 was announced early this month.
 At least three Soviet arms
 shipments have been delivered to
 Ira    since August.
 Syria has received several
 shipments of Soviet arms since
 last M
 Moscow has continued to provide
 economic assistance to both Iraq and
 Syria.   In Iraq, work is proceeding
 on a number of Soviet projects which
 at the time of the February coup
 were in an advanced stage of con-
 struction.   Several industrial
 plants originally scheduled to be
 built with Soviet aid have been can-
 celed, however, and the Iraqi Gov-
 ernment apparently is still consid-
 ering other proposed Soviet projects.
 In Syria also, Soviet technicians  25X1
 have continued work on projects
 under way.
 Moscow probably calculates that
 its propaganda campaign and tempo- 225X1
 rary suspension of military aid have
 been at least partially effective
 in preventing Iraq from pursuing a
 strongly anti-Soviet policy, and
 that continuation of a degree of
 pressure will help maintain Baghdad
 in a neutralist position.  At the
 same time, the USSR's concern at
 the prospect of full union of Iraq
 and Syria has been increased by
 their establishment of a military
 unity.  Moscow's heretofore circum-
 spect treatment of Syria, where the
 Baath severely moderated its anti-
 Communism, now has given way to in-
 creasingly open attacks on the Syrian
 Baathists as the "hangmen's accom-
 plices."
 Moscow will probably continue  25X1
 its dual game of maintaining correct 25X1
 relations with Iraq through the pro-
 vision of aid, while at the same time
 augmenting its anti-Baath propaganda
 campaign as Iraqi-Syrian unity comes
 closer to realization.

 The three-member "emergency
 committee" in Leopoldville,
 headed by Defense Minister Anany,
 appears to have brought labor
 agitation in the Congolese cap-
 ital under control, at least
 temporarily.   Although there
 is still some talk of attempting
 a general strike, the arrest of
 top labor leaders appears to
 have intimidated their followers.
 The potentially dangerous strike
 of civil servants never really
 got under way, and the long-
 standing teachers' strike seems
 to have petered out.
 With the government press
 citing events in Dahomey (see
 next :page) as an example of the
 dangers of knuckling to the
 labor leaders, Anany has indi-
 cated he will bring them to
 trial.   At the same time,  how-
 ever, the government has inti-
 mated that it may at long last
 move to meet some of labor's
 grievances.
 The committee's move to
 strike at what is claimed to be
 the real source of leftist agi-
 tation--the Soviet bloc embas-
 sies in the capital--has stalled.
 Even though the government claims
 it has "proof" that an unnamed
 diplomatic mission participated
 in a plot to subvert the army
 and overthrow the government,

 ers reportedly is divided on
 whether to break relations

 DAHOMEY'S GOVERNMENT OVERTHROWN
 After a week marked by
 rioting, demonstrations, and
 a four-day general strike,
 President Maga has resigned and
 a four-man provisional govern-
 ment headed by Army Chief of
 Staff Soglo has taken over in
 Dahomey.  The immediate polit-
 ical crisis has passed, but
 the emergence of both the labor
 unions, which spearheaded the
 demonstrations, and the mili-
 tary as important political
 factors seems to portend fur-
 ther instability.
 Besides Soglo, the new
 government includes a civilian
 triumvirate of Maga, ex.- Vice
 President Apithy, and erstwhile
 Assembly President Ahomadegbe.
 This group is not likely to
 alter Dahomey's strongly pro-
 Western orientation to any
 significant extent.   Soglo has
 announced that the initial task
 of the provisional government
 will be to prepare for early
 elections.   Ahomadegbe, who
 reportedly has influence with
 Dahomey's military leaders,
 may be emerging as the rr,st
 important leader.
 Maga was included as a
 minister after a previous
 provisional government under
 his leadership was rejected
 by unionists who insisted he
 step down as head of state.
 Since he is spokesman for
 Dahomey's northern tribesmen,
 military leaders were reluc-
 tant to oust him altogether
 for fear that this would ag-
 gravate the country's basic
 north-south split.  For the
 same reason Apithy and Ahomak-
 degbe, rival leaders of the two
 southern factions in Dahomey's
 long-standing three-cornered
 political struggle, reportedly
 helped persuade union leaders
 to keep Maga on.
 The US Embassy feels that
 the French probably encouraged
 Malta's resignation from the
 presidency after it became ap-
 parent that the unionists would
 be satisfied with nothing else.
 The French maintain 800 troops
 in Dahomey, but have not used
 them during the crisis.
 Leaders of Dahomey's basi-
 callyweak trade union movement,
 some of whom in the past have
 been associated with Communist
 fronts, capitalized on wide-
 spread discontent over economic
 conditions, especially a wage
 freeze imposed by Maga, and
 emerged from the crisis with
 considerable political power.
 There seems to have been no
 Communist role in the crisis,
 however, and the influence of
 the more radical younger union-
 ists may be counterbalanced by
 moderate unionists and by the
 predominantly conservative mili-
 tary leaders.
 The Dahomey upheaval is
 likely to hasten the demise of
 the 14-nation,Paris-oriented,
 Afro-Malagasy Union (UAM).  The
 UAM states were already having
 difficulty adjusting to the
 revolution in Brazzaville just
 two months ago.  The Dahomey
 incident may stimulate labor and
 military leaders in other UAM
 states to seek a more influential
 political role.

 LABOR DEMANDS THREATEN FRENCH ANTI-INFLATION PROGRAM
 The nationwide 24-hour
 rail strike in France on 23
 October was a major move in
 the trade unions' stepped-up
 campaign to press the govern-
 ment to liberalize its wage
 policy.  The government has
 raised this year's cost-of-
 living increment from three to
 four percent, but labor is res-
 tive and the much-heralded stabi-
 lization plan is in jeopardy.
 The plan, announced in
 September, was designed to
 arrest spiraling living costs
 and wages.   Its major aim was
 to prevent French prices--which
 have already risen an average
 six percent annually since
 1961--from outdistancing those
 of the other EEC members.
 Specific measures include price
 ceilings, tax increases, a credit
 squeeze, and appeals to employers
 not to bow to demands for con-
 stant wage boosts.
 The general public has re-
 acted with a "wait and see"
 attitude, but the plan has come
 under increasingly severe
 attack from farmers, small shop-
 keepers, and big business.  The
 most serious threat to the gov-
 ernment's resolve to bring
 inflation under control, how-
 ever, is posed by labor's re-
 newed wage claims.   Government
 ministers have been meeting
 with trade union leaders in an
 effort to win support for the
 austerity program; so far the
 discussions have served only
 to harden the existing stale-
 mate, with the unions insisting
 they favor stabilization but
 not at labor's expense.
 The unions argue that rising
 prices are not the result of
 pay increases, but rather of
 military expenditures, business
 and land speculation, excess
 profits, and an uneconomic dis-
 tribution system.   Moreover,
 they accuse the government of
 bad faith in its efforts to
 limit wage increases to four
 percent for the coming year
 and to defer until spring a
 conference on the broad prob-
 lem of wage structure promised
 for autumn,
 The current unrest is great-
 est in the nationalized enter-
 prises--i.e., among railway and
 mine workers and civil servants.
 It stems basically from prob-
 lems of internal wage structures,
 disparities between government
 wages and those of private in-
 dustry, and long-range job
 security issues which were not
 definitively dealt with in the
 April 1963 labor-government
 settlements.  The unions claim,
 for instance, that the govern-
 ment.'s present wage offer still
 fails, particularly because of
 the price increases since the
 spring settlement, to over-
 come the lag between real wages
 and the cost of living.
 In the meantime, labor
 unrest in the nationalized
 sector, which has been fester-
 ing since early September, is
 rapidly reaching a more se-
 rious stage.   At present the
 unions are acting cautiously;
 but there is an increased
 likelihood of strikes involving
 mine, gas, and electricity
 workers and civil servants. In
 the private sector, moreover,
 strikes are threatened in metals,
 textiles, clothing, and retail

 Danish Prime Minister
 Krag's  coalition government--
 a generally moderate  political
 grouping of his own Social
 Democratic Party and the Radical
 Liberal Party--may be forced
 to call early elections.   It
 has defeated a series of no-
 confidence motions in    recent
 weeks, but its margin of vic-
 tory declined to one vote in
 the most recent test on 23
 October.  The opposition is
 made up primarily of more con-
 servative parties, but also
 includes the extreme leftist
 Socialist People's Party.
 The conservatives contend
 that -the government cannot
 work out a general program sup-
 portable by a large parliamen-
 tary majority.   It is tradi-
 tional in Denmark to seek
 broadly based compromise solu-
 tions which will to a consider-
 able extent satisfy the opposi-
 tion.                The government worked
 out such a compromise in con-
 nection with an important
 fiscal bill last June, but
 several months previously major
 economic legislation was passed
 only by a bare majority.
 The political maneuvering
 is taking place against a back-
 ground of considerable pros-
 perity.   Although prospects
 for an early resumption of ne-
 gotiations on Danish EEC mem-
 bership are'dim, the Danes are
 hopeful of securing favorable
 treatment for their agricultural
 products through some other
 arrangement with the EEC.   Like
 Norway's, Denmark's membership
 had been conditioned on the
 United Kingdom's admission.
 The Krag government's policy
 over the past year has never-
 theless been successful in re-
 placing inflation and a balance
 of payments deficit with stable
 prices and a foreign exchange
 surplus.
 Several key political
 leaders are assessing prospects
 for a new postelection govern-
 ment coalition.   Aksel Larsen,
 who led the bulk of Danish
 Communists and sympathizers
 away from orthodox Communism
 to his "national communist"
 Socialist People's Party (SFP),
 is working for eventual coopera-
 tion with the Social Democrats.
 Krag, however, has sharply re-
 buffed him and appears to be

 servative parties.
 percent.
 New general elections must
 in any case be held before the
 end of 1964.   A recent Gallup
 poll suggests some movement
 away from the government.  At
 the last election in 1960 the
 two coalition parties had 47.9
 percent of the vote, but, accord-
 ing to the survey, would win
 only 43.7 percent now.  The
 two major conservative parties
 had 39 percent of the 1960
 vote, but drew 41.6 percent in
 the recent survey.   The SFP
 showed an increase from 6 to 8

 The head of state, Colonel Oswaldo

 Lopez told a US embassy of-

 regime, while not anxious to pro-
 long its tenure,, intends never-

 census, call a constituent assem-

 or draft a new one, and then hold
 elections.   He  refused to indi-

 Lopez went on to say that
 the armed forces had definitely
 decided not to install a civilian
 government during the interim
 period, since a provisional presi-
 dent would be just a figurehead
 of the military, and most Latin
 American governments
 would so regard him.
 Moreover, he added, a
 civilian junta would
 only lead to squabbling,
 with the army ultimately
 stepping in as arbiter.

 New labor troubles in
 Brazil have ended the rela-
 tively relaxed period that
 followed President Goulart's
 short-lived drive to establish
 a state of siege in October.
 The potentially critical situa-
 tion in Sao Paulo raises the
 possibility of a showdown be-
 tween the government and anti-
 Goulart forces.
 The newly formed Joint
 Action Pact (PAC), a Communist-
 oriented alliance of some 700,-
 000 workers in Sao Paulo, has
 begun an industrial strike,
 ostensibly for wage increases
 but undoubtedly with overriding
 political motives.  Latest re-
 ports estimated that more than
 30 percent of Sao Paulo's in-
 dustrial workers were on strike
 and indicated that sympathy
 strikes were breaking out else-
 where.   Brazil's largest labor
 confederation, the Communist-
 controlled National Confedera-
 tion of Industrial Workers, has
 threatened a nationwide strike
 if the PAC demands are not met.
 Meanwhile, the taxi drivers!
 strike which, began on 25 October
 continues to tie up most of the
 city's cabs.
 A more serious danger is
 the threat of federal interven-
 tion should the strikes get
 out of hand.  No violence was
 reported in the early stages
 of the strike, and Governor
 Adhemar de Barros with the help
 of the army seemed to be in
 control of the situation.   Gen-
 eral Peri Bevilacqua, Second
 Army commander stationed in Sao
 Paulo, said he would back up De
 Barros with troops and would
 ensure the peace "at any price."
 However, while Bevilacqua
 is considered a staunch anti-Com-
 munist, his maneuverability may
 have been curtailed somewhat by
 recent events.   War Minister Jair
 Ribeiro continues to transfer
 large numbers of officers out of
 the Second Army in an apparent
 attempt to undermine Bevilacqua.
 Moreover, the War Ministry re-
 cently issued regulations cau-
 tioning army commanders against
 complying with requests from any
 state governor for assistance
 without authorization by the
 President--a direct warning to
 Bevilacqua not to collaborate
 with De Barros,aleading opponent
 of Goulart.
 President Goulart will be
 under heavy and conflicting
 pressure to reach a reasonable
 solution in Sao Paulo.   Federal
 intervention against Governor de
 Barros could spark a widespread,
 violent reaction by moderates
 and rightists.  To agree to ex-
 cessive labor demands would ag-
 gravate the already rampant in-
 flation--which has raised living
 costs over 50 percent this year--
 and would add to growing public
 dissatisfaction.   On the other
 hand, any action which hinders
 labor's efforts would tend to
 alienate Goulart's leftist sup-
 porters.

 Venezuela's Romulo Betancourt
 has temporarily thwarted leftist
 terrorist efforts to defeat his
 ambition to be his country's first
 freely elected president to com-
 plete a five-year term and hand
 over the government to a freely
 elected successor.
 By adding military units to
 his beleaguered police force, Betan-
 court has managed to  reduce the
 terrorism which reached a peak dur-
 ing the second week of October.
 His action has also placated most
 of the military leaders who had
 accused him of ineffectual han-
 dling of the terrorist problem.
 However, there probably will be an
 upsurge of both terrorism and mili-
 tary unrest before the 1 December
 elections and another during the
 period between the elections and
 the inauguration next March.
 The political views of all
 seven presidential candidates are
 left of center.   Betancourt's
 Democratic Action (AD) party is
 represented by Raul Leoni, who
 owes his status of "candidate most
 likely to win" almost wholly to
 the fine organization the AD has
 built up during its five-year incum-
 bency.
 AD's coalition partner, the
 Social Christian Party(COPEI), is
 running Rafael Caldera.  Defeated
 by Betancourt in 1958, Caldera's
 chances are considered slim.
 Jovito Villalba is the candi-
 date of the largest opposition
 party, the Republican Democratic
 Union (URD).  He could win only in
 the unlikely event the opposition
 parties united behind him.
 Arturo Uslar Pietri, an in-
 dependent, is making a surprisingly
 good showing with a campaign he
 claims is based on Theodore H.
 White's analysis of the 1960 elec-
 tion in the United States,   The
 Making of a President.
 Wolfgang Larrazabal, who as
 URD candidate was defeated by
 Betancourt in 1958, is also running
 as an independent.  His campaign
 has been far less successful than
 expected, and he has been under
 considerable pressure from URD to
 withdraw in favor of Villalba.
 Two minor candidates--Raul
 Ramos Gimenez, of the "ARS" splin-
 ter of AD  and German Borregales,
 of the National Action Movement--
 have no chance of winning or of
 significantly influencing the out-
 come.
 In any event, whichever party
 wins the presidency will probably
 face a hostile congress with a mi-
 norityof seats, as no single party
 is expected to win a majority in the
 congressional race.
 Voting is compulsory in Vene-
 zuela.  About 25 percent of the
 voters became eligible during the
 past six years and are expected to
 register the usual discontent of
 youth with the established authority.
 They will probably support Villalba.
 There is also  a great number of
 voters who have migrated from rural
 regions to urban slum districts.
 Their discontent with living condi-
 tions represents a disadvantage to
 Betancourt'S party
