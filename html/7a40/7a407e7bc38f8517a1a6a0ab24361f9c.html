 Summary
 China: Grappling With
 the Lure of the West
 For over a hundred years China's leaders have grappled with the problem
 of how to limit the social and political impact of contacts with the West,
 and it is once again an issue in the leadership. This memorandum explores
 some of the problems and concerns raised by this longstanding dilemma,
 including its impact on the political infighting taking place as the Chinese
 Communist Party prepares for its 12th Congress this fall. Beijing, which
 earlier displayed its concern over foreign influences by staging a campaign
 against corruption, is disturbed by what it sees as a growing adoption of
 Western "bourgeois values" by the nation's youth, and a deteriorating faith
 in the party and socialism.
 The fears expressed by some Chinese officials that youthful fascination
 with foreign things will lead to social upheaval seem exaggerated, in our
 view; disagreement among top leaders over how to handle the issue of
 foreign influences has the potential to become more contentious and
 disruptive than the problem itself.
 Conservatives within the leadership are using the issue of youth behavior
 and Western influences to attack Deng Xiaoping and his open-door
 economic policies; Deng is attempting to preempt his critics by instituting
 measures to restrict the spread of foreign ideas and to reinforce socialist
 ideology. In any case, Beijing has made it clear that China's interest in
 nurturing economic and technological links with the West will not change.
 Efforts to combat foreign influences probably will succeed in reducing the
 obvious signs of "bourgeois liberalization," such as Western music and
 hairstyles, but they are unlikely to affect the underlying causes of youth
 dissatisfaction-political alienation and high unemployment.
 Information as of 16 July 1982
 has been used in the preparation of this report.

 China: Grappling With
 the Lure of the West
 Leadership Concern The recent clamor in the Beijing media about the "corrupting influence of
 Western values" reflects a longstanding leadership concern that contacts
 with the West are a potential threat to the socialist nature of Chinese
 society. China's leaders, in addition to historical concern for preserving
 Chinese values, now also worry about restoring the integrity of the Chinese
 Communist Party following the disruptions of the late Mao-early post-
 Mao era, and maintaining social stability in the face of the influence of for-
 eign values. The anticorruption campaign initiated early this year criticized
 bourgeois values as contributing to the widespread corruption that has
 blackened the party's public image, increased public dissatisfaction, and
 hindered economic growth.' Party attacks, reported in the Chinese media,
 similarly link literature critical of government and party to the influence of
 bourgeois values                                          25X1
 Beijing now has turned its attention to the influence of bourgeois values on
 Chinese youth, and in recent weeks the Chinese press has expressed
 heightened concern about exposing young Chinese to Western lifestyles.
 Even Deng Xiabping, who is committed to expanding relations with the
 West and has generally been more relaxed about the social consequences,
 has expressed such concerns, telling US visitors last fall that Chinese youth
 had lost its way and needed to be reeducated. More recently, Vice Foreign
 Minister Zhang Wenjin told a foreign diplomat that not only Chinese
 leaders but the masses are concerned about the corrupting influence of
 bourgeois culture on the conduct and morality of young Chinese.
 In recent years, many Chinese youths in urban centers have adopted  25X1
 lifestyles that offend the puritanical morals of their elders. Party leaders
 have complained about young people wearing Western clothes, dancing to
 Western music, and engaging in sexual relations with foreigners. The
 media have reported an increase in juvenile delinquency and the issue is
 brought home to party leaders by the behavior of their own children, many
 of whom have been involved in criminal activities ranging from an rapes
 and drugs to embezzlement and smuggling.                        25X1
 In Beijing's view, this type of behavior represents an erosion of morals
 which ultimately threatens the future of China's socialist revolution. The
 media dwell on the creeping influence of bourgeois values which corrupt

 ideals and, unless checked, would lead to the "peaceful evolution" from a
 socialist country to a nonsocialist one. In March a People's Daily editorial
 called this "corruption" a disaster for the socialist cause and warned that
 the struggle against this disaster concerns the very rise or fall of the party
 and the country. Beijing, moreover, saw in the events in Poland a lesson for
 socialist societies given to too much liberalization.

 Ideological Corruption                                            while Chinese leaders stand
 and the Open Door      united in their concern about bourgeois influence on youth they differ over
 the causes. Some conservative members of the leadership such as Secretari-
 at member Wang Renzhong, blame the spread of bourgeois values on
 Deng's economic reform policies which open the door to a greater Western
 presence and permit more free market activity. The military, which
 traditionally has been vigilant in matters affecting the social order, has also
 voiced concern publicly and privately about foreign influences on socialist
 values.                                                  25X1
 Deng and his associates refute their critics by making a distinction between
 the open-door policy itself and its implementation, which they admit has
 led to some negative side effects. In their newspaper articles, the reformers
 place the blame on the Gang of Four for creating conditions-for example,
 erosion of respect for the law and for moral standards-that encourage
 bourgeois behavior. Commentaries reflecting this view vigorously assert the
 necessity of the open door for China's modernization, emphasize the need
 to strengthen ideological and political education to prevent errors in
 carrying out the policy, and stress that the primary causes of corruption are
 internal. As one provincial pa er put it, "worms only breed when things al-
 ready have started rotting."                                    25X1
 Youths' Perspective   Media discussion of the problem of youth behavior fails to capture many of
 the issues troubling young Chinese. Attitudes of Chinese youth undeniably
 are affected by greater exposure to the West. The open-door policy has 25X1
 increased the availability of Western goods and contact with foreigners,
 leading to rising expectations. We believe internal factors are at least as
 important, however, in explaining the behavior of young Chinese.
 Chinese youth are increasingly disillusioned with and alienated from the
 party, in large part as a result of the behavior of older cadre.
 -1 the many and extreme shifts in political ideology during the Cultural
 evolution and the Gang-of-Four period have left many young people witl
 little respect for party pronouncements.
 Practical concerns about their futures discourage young people. In conver-
 sations with Embassy officers, young Chinese dwell on the lack of
 educational opportunities, plus poor teachers and equipment. Those edu-
 cated during the Cultural Revolution are bitter about receiving a sub-
 standard education that limits their prospects in life. High youth unem-
 ployment and lack of economic opportunities further contribute to                          25X1

 dissatisfaction. The employment situation will get worse in the future; we
 estimate an annual average of 5 million young workers will enter the urban
 work force during the next 10 years.
 Combating Bourgeois The leadership is taking a threefold approach to combating the growth of
 Liberalism          bourgeois values among youth: limiting contacts with Western goods and
 people; strengthening political education; and improving the party's image.
 Limiting Western Influences
 The Central Committee and the State Council issued instructions strictly
 controlling reactionary or pornographic sound and video products.' The
 provinces have reinforced this ban by issuing implementing regulations.
 The black market in foreign tapes and recorders is being closed down and
 in Guangdong antennas capable of receiving Hong Kong television were
 recently banned. Other directives rule out long hair, blue jeans, and
 similarly unacceptable Western styles. A ban on disco (dancing to any
 Western music) in public places has recently been extended to cover private
 social gatherings.
 Central government and local authorities are stepping up investigations to
 ferret out offenders. The press reported that a recent crackdown in one
 district of Shanghai alone netted over 1,000 pieces of pornography.
 Those found to be involved in
 proscribed activities may be criticized, fined, subjected to administrative
 detention or sent for labor education. Party members face the additional
 threat of expulsion from the party.
 Authorities also have attempted to limit or control contacts between
 Chinese students and foreigners. New regulations for reporting contacts
 discourage them from visiting the homes of foreign residents in China, and
 in April, Shanghai students were prohibited from attending films at the
 American Consulate. Articles in the media remind Chinese of the proper
 conduct to be observed in dealings with foreigners, which includes avoiding
 romantic involvements and being mindful of security concerns. Concrete
 examples, such as the recent arrest and deportation of an American
 researcher in Beijing, serve as additional reminders. The researcher's
 Chinese fiance has been detained, as have the Chinese contacts who gave
 her internal Chinese Government documents. Embassy and Consulate
 officials report surveillance of foreigners in China has increased in recent
 months.

 Other government measures place strict controls on Chinese students going
 abroad to study. Central Directive 20 restricts children of high-level cadre
 from studying overseas in the future, and reduces the number of those who
 may study abroad by eliminating privately funded study. Briefings prior to
 departure warn students heading overseas to maintain national pride and
 not to bring back Western goods or ideas.
 Increased Ideological Education
 Ideological education, a constant theme in remarks by party leaders, is
 being undertaken with renewed vigor at all levels: primary and middle
 schools, universities, work units, and within the Army and provincial
 militia. Official guidance calls for improved indoctrination for youths,
 persons involved in foreign affairs, and children of party cadre, with stress

 Foreign Affairs has issued guidelines on reinforcing the political education
 of children of its personnel and has called on organizations involved with
 foreigners to prevent incidents by launching educational drives on patrio-
 Universities are reemphasizing political education, too, with attendance at
 study sessions mandatory. Beijing also has announced a new goal of
 universal enrollment of its 190 million children aged 7 to 14 in the Young
 Pioneers, dropping for the first time the requirement that children be of
 suitable class background. Numerous provinces have reported in their
 media organizing work teams to conduct education on socialism and
 politics.
 A national conference in June on literature and arts called on the artistic
 community, which suffered a round of criticism late last year, to reflect
 these themes in its works. The Minister of Radio and Television and the
 party Propaganda Director, both newly appointed, have a record of being
 hardliners on cultural issues who can be expected to fight bourgeois
 Improving the Party's Image
 Beijing's desire to inspire young people and improve their attitude toward
 the party is part of the drive behind the campaigns to eliminate economic
 corruption and end abuses of privilege.
 party editorials call the campaign against
 economic corruption a major part of the fight against bourgeois liberalism.
 central authorities have repeatedly urged
 provincial investigators to seek out party members and high-level officials
 guilty of crimes to illustrate to the masses the party's intolerance of
 corruption.
 Special attention has been given to the problem of ranking cadre whose
 children are involved in illegal activities. Cadre have been warned
 not to shield their children from criminal
 prosecution, and cases in which parents have refused to help guilty children
 have been given wide approving publicity. In our view, the restrictions on
 overseas study for children of ranking cadre are aimed partly at preventing
 cadre from using "back door" methods to secure this privilege for their
 offspring.
 Effectiveness of the    Beijing will achieve some success in reducing obvious displays of Western

 Beijing is cracking down
 on dancing to Western
 music.
 Although some provincial governments have been slow to enforce the
 various prohibitions against decadent music and other Western influences,
 the crackdowns and penalties will reduce the number of long-haired, blue-
 jeaned youths on China's streets. The efforts at renewed ideological
 education, however, are not working at many universities. Students report
 that study session leaders are ridiculed by students, and some students
 forced into leadership roles refuse to call meetings or openly tell students
 not to bother to attend. Often student leaders are advocates of party
 reform. The leadership may be more successful initially in impressing the
 virtues of socialism on the fertile minds of the Young Pioneers, although
 the gap between promise and performance will become apparent to them as
 they grow older.                                         25X1
 Beijing's attempts to improve the party's image also are unlikely to 25X1
 succeed, and may even increase popular disdain. The anticorruption
 campaign is meeting resistance throughout the bureaucracy, and
 is seen as generally ineffective. Provincial media assess-
 ments of the campaign hint at disappointing results, while many people,
 see the campaign as having "snared the small rats
 and mice but not captured the tigers." Some even view the emphasis on
 ideological education and the antipornography campaign as attempts to

 divert the masses' attention from cadre involvement in corruption.
 officials regard the restrictions on study abroad as
 hypocritical because they know many top leaders already have children
 studying overseas.
 Despite indications that many ordinary persons share the leadership's
 concern about bourgeois liberalism, the masses are skeptical of this
 campaign and political campaigns in general. Press commentaries indicate
 that people are reluctant to get involved in the bourgeois liberalism issue
 for fear it will be followed by a backlash if the political mood shifts.
 Beijing's measures moreover fail to respond to young people's concern
 about lack of opportunities. Attempts to upgrade education are under
 way-Beijing has reinstated academic standards, increased teacher educa-
 tion, and is attempting to expand facilities for higher education-but we
 expect progress will be very slow.
 The issue of youth unemployment will be even more difficult to resolve
 the government is
 having serious problems finding jobs for this year's secondary school and
 college graduates. The government's bureaucratic streamlining measures
 have reduced the number of office openings for officials, and almost all
 available employment is in the science and engineering fields. Most 1982
 graduates, who would prefer factory employment, will have to settle for
 less attractive jobs. Even then, Chinese officials have told US Embassy
 personnel that urban youths often wait two years or longer between
 graduation and assignment.
 Implications for US     Efforts to combat bourgeois liberalism will, we believe, cause the United
 Interests               States some inconvenience but will not threaten the overall relationship.
 The anticorruption campaign, for instance, may temporarily slow some
 business contacts between Chinese and Western businessmen. Similarly,
 the restrictions on contacts with foreigners will make it more difficult for
 US diplomatic personnel, journalists, and foreigners to meet with Chinese.
 Beijing is committed to the open-door policy, however, despite rumblings
 from conservative members of the hierarchy. Deng, Premier Zhao Ziyang,
 and others have repeatedly affirmed present economic and trade policies,
 and even commentaries critical of the open door have not suggested
 reversing them.
 Persistent Issue        China has been worried about the corrupting influence of foreigners since
 it first opened to outsiders during the 19th century, and while restrictions
 on contacts with foreigners may ease at some point, we believe the issue of

 bourgeois liberalization will remain a sensitive one in the leadership.
 China's need for contacts with the West-and its concern about those
 contacts-will continue, as will discontent among Chinese youth.
 The fears expressed by some Chinese officials that youthful fascination
 with foreign things will lead to social upheaval seem to us to be
 exaggerated. We have seen no evidence indicating that Chinese youth,
 many of whom remain basically apathetic about politics, are interested in
 or capable of translating their essentially self-centered concerns into a
 political movement. Deng Xiaoping also has demonstrated his willingness
 to crack down on any movement which seems to be getting out of hand.F
 The disagreement among top leaders over how to handle the issue of 25X1
 foreign influences is more significant. Conservative members, in our view,
 will continue to focus on youth lifestyle as a means of attacking the entire
 reform program. Deng will seek to reduce his vulnerability on this issue
 and co-opt his critics by supporting measures to limit foreign cultural
 influences while ensuring that the basic economic policy of opening to the
 West remains intact. The reformers also must beware of the latent
 xenophobia running beneath the campaign against bourgeois influences.
 Too strident a tone against Western values threatens to activate antiforeign
 sentiments among the population; Deng and his allies want to avoid
 frightening China's foreign business contacts.                       25X1
 We believe the topic will tend to be more fractious at times of increased po-
 litical sensitivity, such as prior to important political meetings. The 12th
 Party Congress, expected this fall, undoubtedly is one factor in the
 attention currently given to bourgeois influences and will serve to keep the
 issue before the public and the leadership in coming months. Deng will
 have to deflect criticism of his program continually and work to isolate
 further his opponents, who, as the 12th Party Congress approaches, will
 seek to use any political handhold to forestall a sweep for the reformers. F
