 Fanaticism     Nkrumah's Unreal World
 in
 Africa         In a sympathetic but
 revealing portrait of
 Kwame Nkrumah,, aspir-
 ant to the leadership of all Africa,
 J. Kirk Sale (lecturer in history
 at the University of Ghana 1963-
 1964) says that The Redeemer has an
 "obsession with ideology, and conse-
 quent departure from reality."
 This supremely egotistical and
 ambitious man, believing in a so-
 cialism akin to communism, ignoring
 practical needs, and living in a
 world of his own imagination, has
 subjugated his country and led it
 to the verge of bankruptcy.
 His ideology has been set forth
 most recently in a little book called
 Consciencism, "a philosophy and id-
 eology for de-colonization and de-
 velopment, with particular reference
 to the African revolution."  The bur-
 den of Nkrumah's philosophy of life
 is that facts will bend to support
 his ideology.   [See attachment "The
 Loneliness of Kwame Nkrumah" from

 The attached article is a sober
 and believable assessment of the man,
 his illusions and ideology.  It should
 be drawn upon, in sorrow more than
 anger, to alert the small elite
 groups of African leaders to charac-
 ter traits involved in Nkrumah's
 Messianic drive for power.  In the
 unsettled conditions of the emerging
 nations, this willful man still has
 the capacity for serious trouble-
 making in the councils of Africa as
 he seeks to mold this world in his
 own image.
 Sensational   Historians Discuss

 Moscow
 The May 1965 issue (No.
 5/211) of the Polish-
 language journal Kultura, published
 in Paris, contained a report by for-
 eign students who visited Moscow in
 1961; this report describes discus-
 sions by historians (17 and 18 June)
 of the draft of a volume covering
 Soviet history from 1933 to 191+1, the
 period of the worst of Stalin's purges.
 Several historians sharply criticized
 this volume, one of a series covering
 the whole range of Russian history,
 because it did not go far enough in
 revealing the truth about this -,-; nra
 including such crucial facts a50X1-HUM

 the soundest comments--actually
 in an attempt to defend the draft--
 pointed out, that it was wrong to use
 Stalin's methods in dealing with
 Stalin's cult; "we must write in such

 work in ten years," and not describe
 people as either Gods or devils.   A

 COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 4K
 Commentary
 Principal Developments:
 50X1-HUM
 7-20 July 1965
 1.  Chinese and Albanians resume their anti-Soviet propaganda offen-
 sive, with harsh attacks pegged to the Tito visit to the USSR, an interview
 to Japanese reporters by Chairman Liao Cheng-chi of the Chinese A-A Soli-
 darity Committee scornfully disparaging Soviet intent to aid North Vietnam,
 and an Albanian blast tied to'1t.rriman's "mission to Moscow."  The Chinese
 also publicize anti-Soviet materials from the Australian dissident CPA (M-L)
 and the Japanese CP.
 2.  The Helsinki World Peace Congress brings "fierce debates" and
 "sharp struggle' between the Chinese camp, spearheaded by the Albanians,
 and the Soviet-aligned majority before 1500 delegates:   see separate guid-
 ance item for details.
 3.  Soviet spokesmen continue to maintain an "anti-polemics" posture,
 campaigning against the sin of "imperialist aggression   and repeating their
 call for unity in action, while the CPSU holds talks with delegates of the
 Belgian and Chilean CPs, and the Bulgarian with the French, all supporting
 the Soviet line.   In addition to the general endorsements in reports of the
 above meetings, TASS publicizes a statement by the South African CP urging
 a new international meeting "at the earliest possible opportunity" and
 adding that the refusal of some elements to participate should not prevent
 the others from going ahead.
 4.  The International Preparatory Committee decides to postpone the
 Ninth World Youth Festival to an indefinite date and logatipn next year,
 to the accompaniment of detailed Chinese accounts of a stormy battle by
 Chinese-Indonesian-Japanese forces to retain Algiers as the site while the
 Soviet "manipulators" "rammed through" their "scheme to prevent the festi-
 val from being held in Africa."  Soviet youth boss Reshetov charges the
 "splatters" with "concocting a lie."  See separate guidance item for de-
 tails.
 5.  The Chinese-aligned (and supported) weekly organ of the dissi-
 dent "Belgian CP," La Voix du Peuple, publishes a strong down-the-line
 denunciation of Castro's conduct over the past couple of years, pegged to
 his attack on the Algerian coup.  Meanwhile, Guevara is still missing from
 public view (see #57), but the fresh appearance of posters bearing his por-
 trait in Havana is taken to demonstrate that he is not in disfavor.

 SECRET
 6a                 analysts conclude from various events that, "dur-
 ing the last few months, Pyongyang seems to have reverted to a course of
 relative independence in bloc affairs, like that it pursued until late
 1962 when it began to side heavily with Peiping in the Sino-Soviet dis-
 puteo"  The North Korean regime ended its violent attacks abruptly with
 Khrushchev's fall and has since ignored c1.cial issues in the dispute.
 Meanwhile, a North Vietnamese economic delegation in Peking pays effusive
 tribute to Chinese "whole-hearted and all-out support and assistance."
 7.   The pro-Chinese dissident Italian Communists announce that they
 have organized in Milan a "National Committee of the Movement of Italian
 M-Ls   and decided to call a national congress at a place and time to be
 announced later.
 8.   As the period closes, the Rumanian Party Congress has drawn
 delegates of 55-60 parties of all persuasions in the schism -- believed
 to be the broadest representation since the 1960 81-party conference in
 Moscow (including even the Yugoslavs, excluded in 1960) -- but as of our
 deadline it appears that the hosts are successfully preventing any po-
 lemics or political conflicts at least in public.
 Significance:
 As the Chinese aggressively push their anti-Soviet political cam-
 paign at the sessions of the World Peace Congress and the World Youth
 Festival Preparatory Committee, along with public polemics, most Com-
 munists can find satisfaction only in the fact that their losses during
 this period were relatively contained.  Despite the bitter fighting and
 the walk-out of Soviet and Indian delegates from one session, the WPC did
 avert permanent split and managed to compromise on a relatively satisfac-
 tory general statement and resolution on Vietnam.  The WYF/IPC also averted
 a, permanent rupture, although a post-voting Chinese statement warned that
 a break is close.  And the remarkable Rumanians, effectively maintaining
 their neutrality and independence in action as well as in words, have ap-
 parently succeeded in suppressing public polemics and private infighting
 among the representatives of the wide spectrum of warring factions gath-
 ered for their Party Congress, thus averting a battle royal which could
 have amounted to a major step in the crumbling of the movement.
 The crumbling process does continue, however, as witnessed by the
 sharp attack on Castro by the organ of the Chinese-supported dissident
 Jacques Grippa faction of Belgian Communists.
 Meanwhile, the warfare in Vietnam continues as the most important
 focal point and touchstone of policy for all Communist parties, fronts,
 and other groups,

 CHRONOLOGY -- COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS                      50X1-HUM
 7-20 July 1965
 April (delayed):     ""Following a period of forced suspension" -- as the
 Journal itself puts it --- Nuova Unita, Milan-published 'monthly organ;'
 of the pro--Chinese dissident Italian Communists, resumes publication with
 No. 2, April.  It features an appeal  To the Marxist-Leninist comrades in
 Italy":
 ''The National Committee of the Movement of Italian 11-Ls, ,Which
 was organized in Milan on   April 1965 with the participation of re-
 presentatives from existing M-L groups throughout Italy, has decided
 to call a national congress of the movement at a place and at a time
 to be announced later...."
 Another article entitled "Communique," states that:  "... the Italian
 M--Ls, by way of general strategy, agree with the '25 points, of the Chinese
 CP and with the document issued by the Albanian Labor Party against the
 theses of the PCI 10th Congress.`'  It gives the names of 11 members of the
 "Provisional National Committee," five of whom are identified as the "Board
 of Directors'' of the monthly.
 July 2 (delayed):  La Voix du Peale, Brussels weekly organ of the pro.-
 Chinese dissident Belgian CP, carries a vitriolic attack on Cuban dictator
 Castro.   Entitled  vfhere Is Castro Going?' , it details a long list of
 grievances dated back to May 1963, when Castro visited Moscow and, it in-
 sinuates, sold himself to Khrushchev for a sugar contract.  Within the
 past year, it says, Castro displayed his revisionism in supporting the
 Moscow test-ban treaty, offering (in a 6 July 1961+ NYTimes interview) to
 withdraw his material support of revolutionary movements in Latin America
 if the U.S. would cease aiding anti-Cuban rebels -- "a Castroite re-
 edition of the deal proposed by Khrushchevto Kennedy:   'remove your mis-
 siles from Turkey and I shall remove my missiles from Cuba'" -- and send-
 ing a delegation to the "schismatic" March'Muscow meeting of CPs.  But its
 harshest attack is directed at Castro's new attitude toward the coup in
 Algeria:
 "Since 23 June 1965, Castro has launched himself (or else has
 been launched) into the vangurd against the Algerian revolution.
 Whereas Moscow observed a hypocritical silence and Budapest criti-
 cized, Castro attacked.  Does he realize that in this aggressive
 orientation against Algeria, in associating himself with all the
 imperialist forces linked with the counter-revolutionaries, he scut-
 tles the prestige of the man who was the leader of the victorious
 Cuban revolution? ... It is the same role as played by the Asian
 'spokesmen' of the Khrushchevites, the Mongolians, in the joint
 straggle of the imperialists and revisionists against the Second
 Bandung Conference .... A Castro, who ought to think about Escalante,
 distributes good points to Ben Bella, invective to Bouteflika,

 reproaches and threats to the Algerian revolution, going so far as
 to speak about breaking off diplomatic relational  All this inco-
 herent aggressiveness can only bring joy to imperialism and revision-
 ism....
 NCNA Melbourne publicizes a statement by E.F. Hill, Chairman of the
 pro-Chinese dissident CP of Australia (M-L), published in the 1 July issue
 of Vanguard.  Urging struggle against revisionism to the very end, Hill
 says:
 "Reports from the Soviet revisior#ists show that they are in a
 terrible hurry to complete their betrayal of the October Revolution.
 They are restoring the profit motive, private enterprise, abolishing
 state planning, and developing 'theories' that apologize for capital-
 ism.  Internationally, they are scheming with the U.S. imperialists
 and slandering the revolutionary peoples by whispers and intrigues
 ft
 July 4 (delayed):  NCNA distributes a 3,000-word review of Akahata's 22
 June denunciation of the CPSU leadership (Chrono #56).
 July (delayed):   Czech Party daily Rude Pravo carries a remarkably frank
 discussion of current Soviet economic problems pegged to an article by
 "leading expert of the Soviet Gosplan, A. Maltin," in Moscow's
 Ekonomicheska a Gazeta, entitled ''The Great Maneuver."
 t1... There are still glaring social differences among the di-
 verse strata of the population.  According to general data, the
 average worker's monthly wage is about 90 rubles -- 900 korunas --
 and the lowest wages drop to 40 rubles.  Many families still live
 under poor housing conditions, even in one-room apartments....
 The seven-year plan did not bring a decisive change:  many
 tasks for improving living standards have not been implemented.
 The gap between the growth in the means of production and that of
 consumers goods industry continues to be considerable...."
 July 6 (delayed):  Bulgarian Party daily Rabotnichesko Delo carries a
 communique on 22?-28 June talks with a French CP delegation headed by
 Politburo member Leroy:
 "?.. Inspired by the decisions jointly worked out at the 1957 and

 July 9:  TASS reports on talks held by a delegation of the Soviet-aligned
 Belgian CP headed by Chairman Burnelle with CPSU officials including
 Brezhnev, Suslov and Ponomarev, 25 June to 9 July.  They "stressed the
 vital necessity of active struggle for the unity and cohesion of the inter-
 national Communist and workers movement on the basis of the principles of
 M-L."  Radio Moscow in French on same subject mentioned "the line of the
 Communist movement worked out at the conferences of 1957 and 1960 and con-
 firmed by the communique of the consultat    meeting of the representatives
 of 19 fraternal parties in Moscow."
 TASS also reports that talks between a_Chilean CP delegation headed
 by SecyGen Corvalan and CPSU officials Suslov and Ponomarev "revealed
 'complete identity of views of both parties on problems of the IC&WM.'"
 "The urgent necessity of exerting every effort for the consolidation of

 imperialists and K. revisionists is know wn, just as its role as

 -- "One of the essential aims of Tito's trip to the Soviet Union
 was to search for a way to help U.S. imperialism suppress the heroic
 people of South Vietnam....
 -- "Does not the attitude to the evegtp of 19 June in Algiers, and

 The revisionists measure others with their own  ardstick.  It
 is known how K and the present Soviet leaders in 1958, through a
 'putsch,' liquidated the old Bolshevik leaders Molotov, Malenkov,
 Kaganovich, and others.  One also knows that the present Soviet
 leaders similarly liquidated N. K.hrushchev himself.  That is why,
 being themselves 'putschists,' they could only consider the action
 of the revolutionary council in Algiers on 19 June as a putsch.

 the degeneration of socialism and the restoration of capitalism,

 "(Maoism)... naturally satisfies the Chinese nationalist senti-

 of all of the proletariat through the world.  However, saying that
 the Chinese type of revolution is the general type in colonial and
 semicolonial countries, or, generally speaking, in the Asian, African,
 and Latin American countries, the CPI can -- if we are not careful
 enough -- also call itself the mother country of those Asian, African,
 and Latin American countries which f.ght for political and economic
 independence.  It is hoped that the CPR will not take over this former
 Soviet attitude....
 ... Apart from the fact that the differing views of these two
 anti-Nekolim champions have not helped to 'clear the minds of Afro-
 Asian countries,' the divergence of opinion on the problem of Soviet
 participation in the (Afro Asian) conference -- with the CPR voicing
 disapproval of Soviet participation -- has adversely affected the

 WORLD YOUTH FESTIVAL "POSTPONED"
 The International Preparatory Committee (IPC) for the
 World Youth Festival (WYF), meeting in Tampere, Finland on 8-10 July,
 announced that the Festival had been postponed until next year.  A spe-
 cial committee was formed to recommend to the IPC a locale and date.
 Some 15,000 youth and students were reportedly planning to attend the
 meeting which had been scheduled for Algiers, 28 July to 7 August.   This
 would have been the first WYF held outside Europe and only the third to
 take place outside the Soviet bloc.
 The Algerian coup of 19 June had immediately dimmed the prospects
 for the WYF.  Algerian authorities began arresting members of the Algerian
 National Preparatory Committee and within a week the Algerian members of
 the IPC were either in jail or hiding, while other IPC members mostly
 Eastern European, had fled Algeria.  A few communist students demonstrated
 in Algiers against the new regime, with moral support from Communist and
 other Leftist youth and student groups in many areas of the world.  Ac-
 cording to news reports, the USSR had cut its credits for the Festival
 four days after Ben Bella's overthrow, and a number of Festival delega-
 tions (including Cuba) had decided not to go to Algiers.
 At a meeting on 24 June, the IPC, without consulting the ostensible
 festival hosts, i.e., the Jeunesse de Front Liberation Nationale (JFLN),
 or the Algerian government, decided to withdraw the WYF from Algeria.  A
 resolution issued 25 June and published in L'Unita, the Italian Communist
 daily, stated that the Preparatory Committee "cannot remain indifferent
 to developments in Algeria.   Since June 19, members of the Permanent Com-
 mission [of the IPC] have been isolated inside Algeria with no opportunity
 to establish contact with other countries.   In such conditions, the Com-
 mission cannot continue preparations for the 9th Festival."
 The JFLN issued a communique on 3 July denouncing the IPC's "inter-
 ference in Algeria's internal affairs,  While Algerian youth were prepar-
 ing to receive the youth of the whole world, the IPC took the grave uni-
 lateral decision of leaving Algeria on 25 June, thus abandoning work
 entrusted to it by the IPC General Assembly."  If there had been any doubt
 before as to the actual power behind the Festival, the JFLN communique be-
 trayed the emptiness of persistent Algerian claims that it controlled the
 WYF.

 Hardly coming as a surprise, the Sino-Soviet conflict also en-
 tered the decision to postpone the WYF.  In a statement issued 2 July,
 the All-China Youth Federation condemned the IPC's 25 June resolution
 which they claimed was adopted through "Soviet manipulation behind the
 back of Algeria."  The Chinese accused the IPC of attacking Algerian
 authorities and raising unreasonable demands flagrantly interfering in
 Algeria's internal affairs.  They charged that "the Soviets, in trying
 to change the site to Europe, are trying to undermine the friendship
 between African youth and the youth of other countries and to split the
 unity of the movement."   (On 20 July, the All-China Youth Federation
 launched an extraordinarily sharp attack on the decisions reached by the
 IPC and the statement to the press made on 14 July by the Chairman of
 the Committee of Soviet Youth Organizations.  The appropriate NCNA cover-
 age is enclosed as an Unclassified Attachment.  The Chicoms charge the
 Soviet youth organization with undermining the Festival, interference in
 Algeria's internal affairs for reconsidering the venue of the Festival,
 splitting the unity of the international youth and student movement, and
 trying to advance Soviet foreign policy aims.  The account also exposes
 details of Soviet manipulation.)   In support of the Chinese position,
 the Indonesian youth organization issued a demand on 4 July that the
 Festival be held in Algeria.   It declared that any attempt to change the
 site to East Europe would be a provocation and it opposed holding the       50X1-HUM
 Festival anywhere outside Asia or Africa.

 CASTRO AND THE COUP IN ALGIERS
 The missile crisis of October 1962 occurred at a moment
 when Ahmed Ben Bella was on a state visit to Havana.  He had just been
 named premier of Algeria as a result of the September elections and was
 destined to become president for a five year term the following September.
 It was only natural for the highly temperamental rulers of two "revolu-
 tionary" countries -- one caught in flagrante between the two cdlossi --
 to find that they had much in common.  They issued a joint communique as-
 serting, among other things, that Cuba "has the right and duty to defend
 its national independence and sovereignty."
 In time, the rapport between these two "comrades in arms" blossomed
 into a friendship more personal and intimate than that which ordinarily
 exists between heads of state.  During the border war that broke out in
 the fall of 1963 between Algeria and Morocco, Castro came to Ben Bella's
 aid with several hundred technicians and an unknown, but quite consider-
 able, quantity of munitions.   (BPG #129, 18 Nov 1963, Item #712: "Castro's
 Military Aid to Algeria Backfires")  Already deeply involved in fomenting
 revolution in Africa, Castro made his embassy in Algiers the focal point
 for Cuban activities on the Dark Continent, further proof of the close
 collaboration between the two countries.   (BPG #169, 5 Jul 1965, Item
 #920:   "Cuban Subversion in Africa")
 The foregoing serves to explain the shock which Castro apparently
 suffered when he learned, on 19 June 1965, that Ben Bella had been over-
 thrown by his Vice-President and Minister of Defense, Col. Houari
 Boumedienne, and that there was no news of his safety or whereabouts.
 For a few days, Radio Havana treated the incident cautiously.  On 22 June,
 newscasts began carrying reports that reflected unfavorably on the new re-
 gime, featuring pro-Ben Bella demonstrations and arrests of students.  On
 25 June, the Prensa Latina correspondent in Algiers reported that he had
 been denied permission to see Ben Bella.   He was assured, however, that
 Ben Bella had been "ousted, not liquidated."
 In the meantime, two important conferences were about to take place
 in Algiers:   the Afro-Asian "Summit" Conference (Second Bandung) and the
 Ninth World Festival of Youth and Students.  On 26 June, Castro cancelled
 Cuban participation in the Youth Festival and used the occasion of an ad-
 dress to the disappointed Cuban delegates (numbering 800) to make an of-
 ficial statement on Cuba's position, broadcast live by Radio Havana.   In

 SECRET
 a two-hour, rambling harangue, much of which appeared to be ad-libbed,
 Castro declared emphatically his personal loyalty to Ben Bella and ex-
 pressed his grief at the "treacherous" overthrow of "a government which
 was our closest friend."  He reminisced emotionally over the moral sup-
 port he had received from Ben Bella during the missile crisis, repeatedly
 condemned the "treacherous coup," but reserved judgment on Boumedienne.
 One of  Castro's most hurtful remarks was his characterization of the
 overthrow as a military coup and not a revolution:   "... The military
 insurrection that overthrew Ben Bella's government is not, nor can any
 one classify it as, a revolutionary insurrection."
 Not content with airing such judgments via radio, Prensa Latina had
 its office in Algiers include Castro's speech in an information bulletin
 and give it wide distribution among the civilian population.  The new
 Algerian government responded on 30 June by closing the PL offices. Mean-
 while, Havana has withdrawn its ambassador and relations between the once
 friendly countries remain strained though not diplomatically broken.
 Reactions by Moscow and Peking were much more cautious. Moscow re-
 ported the Algerian events without comment, carefully refraining from
 making any value judgments on the overthrow of an official "Hero of the
 Soviet Union."  On 14 July, after four weeks of reticence,  he Soviet
 Government congratulated Boumedienne.  Much less restrained, Peking not
 only gave the initial events much publicity, but also offered Chinese
 government support for the new revolutionary Council.  On 22 June, in a
 speech in Cairo, Chou En-lai dismissed the coup as an "entirely internal
 affair," and the next day, Foreign Minister Chen I, in Algiers for the
 preparatory meeting, reiterated personally to Boumedienne his government's
 support.

 RUMANIA'S NEW CONSTITUTION
 At the end of June, the Rumanian goirernment published
 the text of a new draft constitution, a document registering Rumania's
 change from a "People's Republic" to a "Socialist Republic," one of a
 number of changes accompanying the renaming of the "Rumanian Workers'
 Party" to "Rumanian Communist Party."  The "Ninth Rumanian Communist
 Party Congress" (as the "Fourth Rumanian Workers' Party Congress" was
 rechristened at the last moment, counting pre-World War II RCP Con-
 gresses) has endorsed the current draft, and it will doubtless be ap-
 proved by Rumania's parliament, the Grand National Assembly.  Under
 Communist rule, Rumania has had two other constitutions, those of 1948
 and 1952.  The present document resembles its predecessors in many re-
 spects, but differs in being much more independent (from Moscow) and
 nationalist in tone, and also in expressing more concern for individual
 rights.
 The 1952 constitution was preceded by a lengthy preamble, display-
 ing spaniel-like admiration of the Soviet Union; the new constitution
 makes no mention of that country.   Instead, the new document uses some
 of the language of Rumania's April 1964 "declaration of independence,"
 saying in Article 14:   "The foreign relations of the Socialist Republic
 of Rumania (SRR) are based on principles of respect for sovereignty and
 national independence, equality of rights and mutual advantages, and
 noninterference in internal affairs."  The same article, while commit-
 ting the SRR to "relations of friendship and fraternal collaboration
 with the socialist countries," also asserts that the SRR "fosters rela-
 tions of collaboration with countries having other social-political
 systems."  In general, the new constitution is much less a copy of the
 1936 Soviet constitution than was the case with the Rumanian constitution
 of 1952.
 A new note is struck with the declaration (Article 13) that "the
 purpose of all state activities is the development of the socialist
 system, constant improvement of the people's material and cultural well-
 being, the guarantee of man's freedom and dignity, and comprehensive af-
 firmation of the human personality."  References to human dignity and the
 affirmation of the human personality, while sometimes made by the young
 n r n n r T                                            i _,.,

 Karl Marx, have not hitherto been a feature of Communist constitutions.
 The new document sets a limit of 24 hours on investigative arrest (Arti-
 cle 31); the 1948 constitution had established a limit of 48 hours for
 arrest without warrant, and the 1952 constitution, while calling for a
 warrant, set no time limit whatever.  Article 35 contains an interest-
 ing innovation:  it provides that persons whose rights are violated by
 an illegal action of a state organ "may request the competent organs,
 under conditions stipulated by law, to annul the action and compensate
 for the damage."  This article amounts to an admission of past injustices,
 and seems to be backed up by Article 96, according to which "courts hear
 the pleas of those whose rights have been violated by administrative ac-
 tions, and can also decide on the basis of the law the legality of these
 actions."  Article 104 is also noteworthy; it states that "in trial acti-
 vities, judges and people's assessors are independent and accountable
 only to the law."   (One of the issues in Yugoslavia's Mihajlov case was
 the charge that Tito in effect had directed the courts to find Mihajlov
 guilty.                                                           50X1-HUM
 The affirmations of individual rights in the new constitution lose
 some of their lustier when it is realized that many of these provisions
 already existed in earlier constitutions, where they have often been
 dead letters.  Thus guarantees of freedom of speech, press, and assembly
 (Article 28); of freedom of religion (Article 30); against arrest with-
 out warrant (Article 31); against entry into homes without a warrant
 (Article,32); and of the inviolability of correspondence (Article 33)
 also appeared in Rumania's 1948 and 1952 constitutions, and in the Soviet
 1936 constitution.  All these constitutions have provided for "universal,
 equal, direct, and secret suffrage" -- but there has been no real choice
 of candidates.   Experience shows that it would be a grave mistake to take
 a Communist constitution at face value.
 Even on its face, the new Rumanian constitution forbids any use of
 freedom of speech, press, meetings, and demonstrations for "purposes
 contrary to the socialist system" (Article 29); binds citizens to "con-
 tribute to the strengthening and development of the socialist system"
 (Article 39), and makes "violation of the military oath, betrayal of
 the homeland, desertion to the enemy, and the damaging of the state's
 defensive ability ... punishable with the full severity of the law"
 (Article 41).   In the past, such provisions have been used to ration-
 alize the worst violations of human rights.  The weakness of Communist
 constitutions is that they do not actually represent the supreme law of
 the land; Party rules and practices are decisive, and Party leaders arbi-
 trarily establish the norms.  Addressing the Ninth Congress on 19 July,
 Rumania's new party boss, Nicolae Ceausescu, made it clear that the new
 constitution means no abdication of control, saying that the document
 would ensure the "enhancement of the role of the Socialist state as the
 organizer of the whole activity of building the Socialist system."

 Nevertheless, affirmations of human rights are not without value,
 particularly when they are extended, and when past violations are im-
 plicitly recognized.   If human rights are still sometimes violated,
 the violation is done with a bad conscience.   In most of East Europe,
 respect for the law is on the increase, and officials can no longer be

 SUKARNO AND THE PKI --
 WHO CONTROLS WHOM?
 Each year on .17 August, the anniversary of Indonesian
 independence, President Sukarno delivers a major policy address.  Last
 August his speech was "A Year of Dangerous Living."  This was a particu-
 larly prophetic title because each crucial step Sukarno took throughout
 the year drew him closer into the web of the PK1 and through it to con-
 trol by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).   (See unclassified attachment
 for a detailed chronology of relevant developments -- i.e., increasing
 influence permitted the PKI and growing collaboration with the Chinese
 -- within Indonesia and between Indonesia and the Chinese Peoples Re-
 public).
 This trend was confirmed in the PKI's gigantic celebration of their
 45th anniversary which began on 23 May and carried over into the first
 week of June.  The Indonesian government provided trucks and other vehi-
 cles to transport everyone to and from the Bung Karno Stadium for the
 rally, schoolchildren were dismissed from classes, most shops were closed,
 and the general atmosphere gave the Communist anniversary the appearance
 of an official State occasion.  President Sukarno was the principal speaker
 at the opening celebration.  He praised the PKI and encouraged them to con-
 tinue "their contribution to the Indonesian Revolution."  He also admonished
 "Communist phobes" and warned them against upsetting the "unification of all
 national revolutionary forces within Nasakom."   (Nasakom is Sukarno's name
 for what he sets forth as a new concept for his brand of government, namely
 a coalition Cabinet uniting all nationalist, religious and Communist ele-
 ments).  He closed his address by urging the PKI to "go onward, onward,
 onward, and never retreat!"   (See unclassified attachment for excerpts of
 Sukarno's speech.)
 The PKI, in its anniversary celebration, had set itself the dual
 objective of demonstrating that it is THE national party and that it is
 the exclusive official supporter, protector and interpreter of Sukarnoism.
 In summing up the themes and results of the celebration, PKI Chairman Aidit
 said that it "turned into a truly national celebration" demonstrating the
 "unity between the PKI and President Sukarno and his assistants."

 There was another noteworthy development during the PKI's an-

 credits from the USSR; and in earlier times, Sukarno allowed the Soviets
 to use their Djakarta visits to level insulting charges at the US from
 whom he had "borrowed" about the same amount.
 Communist China demonstrated its approval of the entire PKI an-
 niversary proceedings by carrying extensive laudatory accounts in
 People's Daily and in the newscasts of Radio Peking and the New China
 News Agency.  Mao Tse-tung sent a message praising the PKI's achieve-
 ments as a "glorious page ... in the annals of the Revolution in the
 East."
 Sukarno used the celebration and the carnival atmosphere as an-
 other way of keeping the minds of the Indonesian people off their
 r e a 1   troubles:   the cost of living has risen over 2,000 percent
 in the past six years, and inflation has driven the actual rate of
 foreign exchange to 7,000 rupiahs to the US dollar, compared to the
 official rate of 45 to 1.

 WORLD PEACE COUNCIL BESET BY SINO-SOVIET CONFLICT
 The Seventh World Peace Congress in Helsinki, Finland
 from 10-15 July became one more forum for discord within the Communist
 world and its auxiliary peace movement.  The Soviets, over the objections
 of several groups, retained control of the Congress sponsored by the
 Communist front World Peace Council (WPC).  The Chicom clique took the
 most strenuous exception to Soviet leadership, challenging the Soviets'
 policy of disarmament and peaceful coexistence. The final resolutions
 of the Congress, which were accepted by the Chicoms, suggest that the
 Soviets compromised to a certain extent but did not change the basic
 precepts of their policy.  They decried political intolerance that would
 erect barriers to unified and concrete actions for peace at the Congress
 and in official propaganda.  However, the tone of their reply to the
 Chicoms' challenges was relatively restrained.  Neither Sino-Soviet dif-
 ferences nor the power struggle within the WPC mitigated the combined
 assault on imperialism, specifically U.S. policy in Vietnam.
 The International Preparatory Committee (IPC), gathering directly
 before the Congress, heard a report on the 22-23 May IPC meeting in
 Helsinki which outlined what the Congress would discuss and how it should
 go about doing so.  The report drew rebuttal from the Chicoms who had
 abstained from participation in all preparatory activities.  Debate on
 rules of procedure, reorganization of the WPC and substantive issues
 (e.g. Vietnam, peaceful co-existence) carried over into and throughout
 the Congress proper.  World-wide, both the Communist and non-Communist
 press have focused on the Sino-Soviet exchanges.  Ironically, the non-
 Communist Finnish media generally played down coverage of the Congress,
 suggesting that the Finns have been embarrassed by association with the
 dispute at the Congress or the Congress per se, or both.  Over 15,000
 delegates and observers from 98 countries either witnessed or partici-
 pated in the arguments,  The Africans seem to have been generally dis-
 turbed by the disrupting effects of the dispute, but depending on the
 point under discussion, national groups found themselves either more or
 less aligned with one or the other of the protagonists.   However, the
 Soviets did receive active, across-the-board support particularly from
 the Indians while the Chicoms were able to launch vitriolic broadsides
 via their Albanian, Indonesian and Pakistani associates.

 SECRET
 The WPC secretariat's autocratic control over the procedures of the
 Congress were successfully challenged to the extent that an extraordinary
 plenary session gave 21 additional delegations the right to address the
 Congress for specified periods of time.  While the Chicoms did not re-
 treat from their unsuccessful demand for unlimited debate, the plenary
 session compromise afforded them an additional opportunity to attack the
 Soviets but also for small Afro-Asian nations to be heard.
 WPC President Bernal's memorandum on reorganization, supported by
 the Chicoms principally as a means to attack the Soviets but also by
 others wanting a greater hand in the organization (i.e. Bernal's own
 :British associates, the U.S. group and Afro-Asian organizations), was not
 `brought before the Congress, on the grounds it would first have to go
 before the Council.  Since the Presidential Committee had discussed the
 proposal on 8 July, Soviet ability to block it and also the selection of
 new executive bureau members testify to continued Soviet manipulation of
 the WPC.  The Chicoms also lost another battle in their attempt to re-
 duce the working committees from seven to four which would have allowed
 them to focus the Congress on the topics suiting their position.
 Issues.  On the subject of war vs "peaceful coexistence," the Chi-
 coms insisted the Congress should focus on opposition to war, the liqui-
 dation of imperialism as the only premise for disarmament, and said that
 application of peaceful-coexistence to the U.S. with respect to Vietnam
 was "appeasement."  Further, they said that to firmly oppose the imperi-
 alists in Vietnam does not threaten to escalate the conflict into nuclear
 holocaust -- the central point of contention between the protagonists.
 But the General Statement circumvented this controversial issue by saying
 that imperialist adventures in cases such as Vietnam strike "a grave blow
 at the aspirations of the people to detente and peaceful coexistence,"
 calling for "action to isolate U.S. imperialism...'to support the strug-
 gles of the peoples... against colonialism.... Faced with the people's
 determination and their common front of struggle, the forces of oppres-
 sion and war will not prevail."
 The Congress rejected the U.S. delegation's proposal -- already
 strongly opposed by the Chicoms but applauded by the Soviets in the Com-
 mittee -- to dispatch a peace delegation to Hanoi, the Viet Cong, Peking,
 Moscow, London, Washington and the U.N.
 The primary Soviet objective was unity (i.e. the status quo in the
 World Communist Movement as against Chicom leadership ambitions).  To
 attain unity, the Soviets were willing to make concessions of a sort to
 the Chicoms.  They ignored attacks on their spokesmen and they limited
 themselves to a temporary walkout from the committee on disarmament,
 nuclear free zones and nonaligned countries.  The unanimous endorsement
 of the General Statement does not mean that there was anything approaching
 a genuine meeting of the minds over grave disputes.  The WPC continues
 to be in disarray, as just two exemples will illustrate.  The Soviets

 miles away, the route through the
 capital was lined by guards  sta-

 and police cruisers.

 usually spends less time there. It is

 year, after an assassination attempt
 within  Flagstaff  itself,  Nkrumah
 burrowed himself there and made it
 virtually  unapproachable,  with  a
 dozen policemen guarding the en-
 trance road, two small tanks lined
 up against the wall and a gunboat of
 the Ghana Navy cruising in the
 harbor.
 I once drove up as far as the front
 gate while taking a visiting Ameri-
 can on a sightseeing tour of the city,
 but  at  the  wall  a  rifle-wielding
 soldier roughly turned us back and
 told us sternly that it was forbidden
 even to look at the castle. A group
 of Western newsmen who did man-
 age to fast-talk their way past the
 main gate so upset Nkrumah that he
 had them clapped into fail - from
 which, incidentally, they managed to
 fast-talk their way out the next day.
 ,KRUMAH'S fear has led him
 to some extreme lengths. He dis-
 trusts both those nearest him-he is
 said to have shot a bodyguard with
 his personal revolver one jumpy day
 -last February-and those farthest
 away, who are more suspect because
 less  under watch. Passing around
 copies of Andrew Tally's spies-under-
 the-bed  book,  "C.I.A. - The  Inside
 Story," was harmless enough, but he
 began to see C.I.A. machinations ev-
 erywhere and to suspect all Ameri-
 cans on principle. Once he warned
 civil servants that they should stay
 away from those subversive cocktail
 parties at the American Embassy,
 and his puppet press even attacked
 "those Peace Corps spies, spies and
 saboteurs." He deported three abso-
 lutely innocent Americans from the
 University of Ghana on charges of
 "treasonable  activities"  which  he,
 never oven tried to prove, and re-
 fused to listen to anyone who pointed
 out the absurdity of his accusations..
 Flagstaff House also reflects the
 isolation of a man imprisoned by
 such fear. Its walls have served not
 only to protect him, but, in a deeper
 sense,  to  cut  him  off  from  the
 raucous, rhythmical world that is
 Accra and the common people whose
 life was once his own. Outside, on the
 broad   macadam  of  Independence
 Avenue,  passes    a  panorama of
 Ghana:   "market mammies"    with
 basins of fried fish impossibly bal-
 anced on their heads; members of
 the W.P.A.-style "Workers Brigade"
 clapping hands (the Ghanaian equiv-
 alent of the
 raised thumb) for rides; bikes,
 'buses, Volkswagens and Mer-
 cedes-Benzes - in  ascending
 order, the transportation stat-'
 us sybols for Ghanaian work-
 ers - carelessly  and loudly
 weaving past the white-jack-
 eted traffic cop at the main
 gate; "mammy wagons," un-
 believably ramshackle trucks
 whose wooden sides bulge with
 passengers and produce, clat-
 tering to the market. Inside,
 Nkrumah sits alone at a broad
 desk in a quiet, air-conditioned
 room.
 Nkrumah's public  appear-
 ances are rare and he usually
 chooses to communicate to his
 people through the press and
 radio;  for any  major pro-
 nouncement he uses not the
 public platform but the radio
 station within his walls. Few
 visitors get to see him and
 often  his  own advisers  are
 kept away by his camp of sec-
 retaries; those who are likely
 to   prove bothersome,  like  a
 delegation   of   disgruntled
 chiefs   or   non - Communist
 Western reporters, never get
 beyond the first gate. His per-
 sonal life is kept almost com-
 pletely                                                                                                          shrouded;       when  his.

 Nkrumah has always been
 a lonely man. He was an only
 child, very close to his mother,
 In a society where large fami-
 lies are almost universal; he
 once wrote that "any happiest
 hours were spent alone. I used
 to wander off on my own for
 hours on end." At school he
 hated  the regimentation  of
 military  drill  and shunned
 team sports in favor of soli-
 tary running (and since his
 best efforts were at 220 and
 440 yards, one Accra wag has
 since referred to this as "the
 loneliness  of  the  short-dis-
 tance runner"),  During his
 difficult life in the United
 'States in the thirties, cut off
 from home and family, he
 lived an almost pathetically
 isolated existence which he
 later described as producing
 "a most 'haunting feeling, of
 loneliness."
 Once back in Ghana and
 absorbed in the life of a poli-
 tician, Nkrumah had little op-
 portunity  for  solitude,  but
 found that in many ways his
 10 years of Western training
 separated him from the tradi-
 tional life  around  him. He
 worked long hours and made
 it a point to withdraw for a
 week or two, once "to a quiet
 spot a hundred miles or so
 out of Accra in order to medi-
 tate." After his political posi-
 tion was secure - around 1960,
 when he was elected Presi-
 dent of the new Republic of
 Ghana-he was able to turn
 ,more and more from being an
 active public figure into a
 secluded  administrator.  And
 today, behind his walls, he
 leads an existence very much
 alone.

 few years'has been his lack
 of male companionship, on the
 level of either friend or ad-
 viser.  So  many  one - time
 friends have turned against
 him for one reason or another
 that he now seems reluctant
 to send out the tentacles of
 friendship  to  anyone.  Ako
 Adjei, whom he had known
 and trusted since his days in
 America and who had been
 Foreign Minister in several of
 his Cabinets, was found guilty
 this year of plotting to kill
 Nkrusnalr;  Tawia Adamafio,
 former party leader and once
 the man closest to Nkrumah,
 was sentenced in the same
 plot; Komla Gbedemah, who
 engineered  Nkrumah's  first
 election and was a successful
 Finance Minister for many
 years, was kicked out of the
 Government in 1961 amid later
 accused as the instigator of
 an attempted overthrow; and
 the list could go on.
 All of this has made Nkru-
 mah   naturally   suspicious
 about those he allows close to
 him, and one reason that he
 now works up to 20 hours a
 day may be that he is reluc-
 tant to trust anyone else with
 his burden of work. It is in-
 teresting that of those closest
 to him personally today-the
 three  B's,  Defense  Minister
 Kofi Baako, personal trouble-
 shooter  Geoffrey  Bing                                                                     and
 radical-left columnist II. M.!
 Banner-the first is in poor
 health and the last two are
 whites with no chance to form
 a rival power structure, men
 from  whose  friendship,  in
 short, there is no threat
 For some men, women might
 supply an outlet for loneliness,
 but not for Nkrumah. He has
 always been afraid, he has
 said, "to become too entangled
 with  a  woman,"  and  even
 from his earliest days, he con-
 fesses,  "my fear of women
 was beyond all understand-
 ing," a feeling "I have never
 outgrown." His closest attach-
 ment was to his mother-he
 reports that as a child "I used
 to be angry when my father
 came to sleep in our bed....
 I told him that I was also
 married to her and it was my
 job to protect her"-,and -ap-
 parently no one has been able
 to take her place.
 Today he Is married to an
 Egyptian, Fathia Ritzk, but it
 was  from  the beginning  a
 marriage of convenience rath-
 er than love (he probably had
 not even seen his bride before
 they got married) and it is
 doubtful  that  she  shares
 enough of the Ghanaian ex-
 perienee or the political pas-
 sion to be very close to Nkru-
 r'r
 ONE  substitute  for  the
 lack
 of personal  friendship
 may be the animals in his
 zoo, who can be releases for
 4 a feeling Nkrumah dares not
 share with those around hits
 and cannot share with       the
 public, but of course this is
 not enough, A more effective
 and  pervasive  substitute   is

 that is, public adulation, on
 Which  Nkrumah  seems ? to
 thrive.
 He   has  no    hesitation in
 having the party papers refer
 to  him as  "His  Messianic
 Dedication," "The  Nation's
 Pillar of Fire and Fount of
 Honor" or simply "The Lead-
 er";                                                                                                  his speeches on Radio
 Ghana are preceded with as
 much as 15 minutes of tra-
 ditional  "praise-singing,"  a
 privilege once  reserved for
 chiefs alone. When a slight
 earthquake shook Accra on
 the day Nkrumah announced
 his new Seven-Year Develop-
 ment Plan, The Evening News
 report ran :
 "After  the  Messiah  had
 launched the people's program
 to build a socialist state .
 .THE    EARTH TREMBLED
 .AND THE TREES SHOOK,
 THE     WIND BLEW     AND
 THERE WAS RAIN in Accra
 which had not seen a drop of
 water for a long time. , .. The
 second Messiah has arrived.
 Ye know not when he cometh,
 says the Bible, and we say to
 the world that HE is here."
 And this is not extraordi-
 nary; it is daily fare. Such
 "unsober adulation,"  as one
 Ghanaian  intellectual  wrote
 last year, "may unintentional-
 ly cut off the President from
 the people," thus increasing
 the isolation it is intended to
 overcome. But  in  the  short
 run it seems to provide Nkru-
 mah a very welcome mani-
 festation that the people of
 Ghana are his friends (not to
 mention worshipers) en masse
 even if they so often turn out
 to be his enemies individually.'
 The intermingled fear and
 isolation, the one breeding the
 other, form an essential part
 of Nkrumah's personality. In

 turn, they reflect what is per-
 haps the essential key to un-
 locking this complex man: his
 consistent  self - centeredness,
 self - absorption,  egotism
 what in psychological terms
 might be considered narcis-
 sism.
 The evidence to support a
 diagnosis of Nkrumah as nar-
 cissistic is not, of course, con-
 elusive. but signals such as
 these occur too frequently to
 be overlooked,
 An inordinate affachment to
 his own ideas, Nkrurkah has
 continually. thrust his  own
 ideology on his country and
 the world in five turgid books,
 in  half  a  doter  polemical
 newspapers, on?.his powerful
 broadcasting stamn-and has
 done this even knowing it has
 alienated many  of  his fol- .
 lowers, angered many of his
 fellow leaders and offended
 many of his creditors. `'
 A  supreme  couvietion in
 the rightness of his sections.
 Nkrumah has always believed
 religiously that his way was
 the only way, a feature very
 effective in gaining supporters
 in his fight for independence,
 and neither bombs, betrayals
 nor abuse have shaken him;
 last year, for example, when
 moving to take over the Uni-
 versity of Ghana, he blithely
 ignored even Conor Cruise 0'
 Brien, then Vice Chancellor
 and one of his own appointees,
 who suggested that his action
 was improper.
 An acute sensitivity to any.
 kind of criticism.  Nkrumah
 has found criticism so dis-
 tasteful that he has eliminated
 the political opposition, reor-
 ganized the Legislature so that
 detractors  can't  lift their
 heads and clamped full con-
 trol over all domestic news
 -media and occasionally over
 foreign imports as    well,  he
 led a violent campaign last
 year against "rumor-mongers"
 who were said to  be telling
 tales. about him behind his
 back. In March one poor taxi
 driver  was  jailed for three
 years for passing on a rumor
 to his back-seat passengers,
 who happened     to  be  high-,
 ranking military men.
 An      unrelaxing   desire  to
 mold reality to fit his pre-
 ;ccpts. Nkrumah has sought to
 change what his ideas cannot
 admit of and has refused to
 admit   of  what  his,    power
 cannot change.  He has ac-
 tively supported. left-wingers
 throughout the continent in
 hopes of proving that Africa,
 is really  socialist at heart,
 and  at  home he  allows  his
 papers to make up news and
 montage    photographs   that:
 will match his preconceptions.
 Two years ago he decided that
 all drivers should immediately
 switch to the right-hand side
 of the road as a move of soli-
 darity with the fanner French
 states around him, and only
 a  last-minute  burst  of  ra-
 tionality halted the campaign
 and saved the lives of thou-
 A continual need for public
 reaffirmation  of his  value.
 Nkrumah has encouraged not.
 only adulation from the press
 but  sycophancy  from those
 around him, and has held a
 steady stream of elections and
 referendums as evidence that
 he is really popular, His own
 words betray this need: "It is.
 essential,"  he  announced  in
 1.962, "that once every five
 ,years [the peopled shall have
 the opportunity to renew their
 faith and confidence in the
 party and its leader"      (my
 italics).
 IN view of such recognized
 symptoms as these, then, it
 does not seem too much to see
 Nkrumah as an example of a
 narcissistic  personality,  pro-
 viding that this is understood
 as analysis and not condem-
 nation. And what should we
 expect of such a personality?
 In Erich Fronim's words, a
 narcissist "has to increase his
 power, his ruthlessness and his
 narcissism."   Nkrumah  has
 done exactly that.
 Since 1961 Nkrumah has in-
 creased his power steadily and
 relentlessly. He has taken over
 full executive direction of the
 all-powerful Convention Peo-
 ple's party, of which he is life
 president, assumed full  com-
 mand of the armed forces, re-
 moved all possible political ri-
 vals from his  inner councils,
 councils,
 outlawed the       opposition
 United party and jailed its
 leaders, made the legislature
 into a rubber stamp (in fact,
 he has ordered M.P.s to find
 outside jobs because there is
 not enough to keep them busy
 in  the  legislature),  purged
 police and army ranks of pos-
 sible dissidents, clamped ab-
 solute  authority  over  all
 weapons of propaganda, given
 himself veto power over top-
 level  judicial decisions, and
 taken  control of university
 education. Today Nkrumah
 reigns supreme.
 He has also increased his
 ruthlessness. He has passed a
 steady series of harshly puni-
 'tive laws allowing him to jail
 ,opponents up  to  20  years
 without trial or appeal, used
 them to jail more than 100
 (some even say 1,000)   sus-
 pected                                                                                                      dissidents  including
 professors and students, used
 police interrogation and house
 arrests to cow both friends
 and  foes,  stationed soldiers
 with automatic rifles to guard
 key locations such as banks
 and communications centers,
 openly  threatened  military
 action  against anti-Govern-
 ment                                                                                                       demonstrations, con-
 doned                                                                                                       an  uncontrolled mob
 invasion designed to intimi-
 date university students, al-
 lowed party hacks remarkable
 freedom in bullying recalci-
 trant judges, Middle Eastern
 entrepreneurs  and  hesitant
 schoolmasters, and used courts
 at all levels to enforce execu-
 tive orders.
 In part, of course, Nkrumah
 has been forced to such harsh
 'ness because of the threat of
 subversion, but his ruthless-
 ness grows within a vicious
 circle common to many au-
 thoritarians: fearing those he
 oppresses, he oppresses those
 he fears.
 Finally, there is what can
 only be described as Nkru-
 mah's growing sense of un-
 reality. It explains his inabil-
 ity to have close friends, his
 belief' in his own rightness,
 his  acceptance  of  "unsober
 adulation," his drive to re-
 make  Africa  in                                                                                                        his  own
 image.
 He has always been without
 the day-to-day balances that
 ,provide incursions of reality in -
 other men-he has no hobbies,
 eats very little, drinks and
 smokes not at all. He has al-
 ways plunged headlong into his
 fantasies, first his games, then
 his religion, later his nation-
 alism; Peter Abrahams once
 reported that "he seemed con-
 sumed by a restlessness that
 led him to evolve some of the
 most fantastic schemes." And
 today fear, isolation and a,
 growing authoritarianism have

 worked to place Nkrumah in a
 special world of his own, not
 quite connected with the real
 world outside his private pat-
 There  are  certain  links
 with reality, of couriie, even
 beyond three common to, every
 mortal man: his fear seems
 reasonable since there are In
 fact those who want' to kill
 him; his isolation seems real-
 istic as a way to preserve him-
 .self and his great works; his'
 absorption  of  power  seems
 reasonable, since everyone iii.
 the nation keeps telling him it
 is. Which is to say that there
 is a sufficiently realistic basis
 to   Nkrumah's  unreality to
 keep him on this side of san-
 ity and to make him quite a
 different figure in degree from
 an Egyptian pharoah, say, or
 Hitler.
 But his unreality is unmis-
 takable, and it is clearest of
 all in Nkrumah's excessive at-
 tachment to his own ideology,
 an attachment that leads him
 to some of the most senseless
 moves. He has set up some-
 thing called the Kwame Nkru-
 mah  Institute  of  Ideology,
 formed ideological "study
 groups" and started two propa-
 ganda newspapers, all of which
 concern themselves day in and
 day out with whatever Nkru.
 mah has thought or is thinking.
 He has also recently formed
 a committee to insure "ideo-
 logical purity" in the land by
 purging libraries and book-
 stores of publications which do
 not conform to the "Nkrumah-
 ist" ideology. Now, of course,
 there are not going to be many
 volumes left in the Accra Pub-
 lic Library if this last move is
 seriously pushed-and it seems
 .that it is being-but this only
 points up the depth of Nkru-
 mah's unreality, for when the
 ideological steamroller runs up
 against the realistic mountain,
 it is the mountain that must
 give way or be run over.
 Nkrumah's .decisions today
 are based not so much on prac-
 tical necessities as on ideologi-
 cal commitment; not on what
 actually is but on what ideo-
 logically should be. It is not
 too much to say that if Nkru-
 mah were given the choice be-
 tween ridding Ghana of all its
 ills on practical lines in a dee
 ade or on his own rigid ideo-
 logical lines in three, he would ;
 Unhesitatingly choose the lat-
 ter. Such is the depth of his
 commitment.
 There are three major exam-
 ples of how in recent years
 '.irlenlnl!y  hll"  \VIa1  OVer
 Iit'll 1ity.
 1" ir.st, the ideology not only
 la"oriaimsA  the necessity and
 rightness of Socialism but de-
 mands  a  unity  of  purpose
 among Socialist l i.e., Cummu-
 nist) countries. Hence Ghana
 has     embarked  on  extensive'
 trade     agreements  with the
 Eastern bloc, not because she
 wants Eastern goods (very few
 Ghanaians care for the hot
 Czechoslovak shoes or unpala-
 table Chinese pigs' knuckles
 that now crowd Accra's stores)
 and not because she finds the
 ): mast a profitable trade part-
 ner (the Communists have so
 far failed to make good on $5
 million worth of commitments)
 but primarily to back up her
 ideological identity with the
 East by economic connections.
 The result has been that Gha-
 na's industries and agriculture
 have been withering for lack
 of  supplies,  her  consumers
 have been deprived of many
 common Western imports and
 faced with rationing of still
 others, and her finances have
 plunged to the point that she
 is in debt by perhaps as much
 as $800 million.
 Second, the ideology holds
 that  "capitalism is but the
 gentleman's method of slav-
 ery" which uses "the cajole-
 ment, the wheedlings, the se-
 duction and the Trojan horses
 :of neo-colonialism" in undevel-
 oped countries "to subordinate
 their interests to those of a
 foreign power." Hence Ghana
 has turned away as much as
 possible from the capitalist na-
 tions on which it would logi-
 cally depend for foreign trade
 and economic assistance. The
 United States is continually
 depicted as putting bombs in .
 the hands of Nkrumah's ene-
 mies, Britain is assailed for
 every real and imagined ill af-
 fecting its former colony, West
 Germany is castigated as a,
 "running dog of imperialism." It is little wonder that when
 Ghana went around last month
 secretly soliciting desperately
 needed funds from these coun-
 tries it was given the cold-
 shoulder at every stop.  Yet
 there is no suggestion that
 Ghana has any intention of
 giving up its ideologizirl bar-
 rage in order to get economic
 isustenanee,
 Lastly, the ideology holds
 y tliitt it tight "Union (of African
 'States" under a Socialist ban-
 +ncr is essential ard that "we
 shull never relax our effort" to'
 bring total independence and
 unity to this African conti-
 nent." Yet Nlcrumah's African
 Affairs Bureau has steadily
 alienated most of the conti-
 nent's leaders with its free-
 wheeling  interference  (with
 anything from propaganda to
 guns) on behalf of left-wing
 causes even in sovereign na-
 tions; his "freedom fighters"
 village on the outskirts of Ac-
 era has provided a haven for
 all kinds of leftist dissidents
 .kicked out of other countries;
 his  insistence  that  "Africa
 must unite," pursued with all
 the subtlety of a jackhammer,
 has angered such realistic lead-
 ers as Julius Nyerere, Presi-
 dent of Tanzania, who last year
 told him bluntly to mind his
 own business. But Nkrumatr's
 ideology does not make allow-
 ances for any business in Af-
 rica not being his, nor does his
 mind appreciate the difference
 between persuasion and med-
 dling.
 And so it goes - ideology
 over practicality, illusion over
 reality no matter what  the
 results.
 HE latest demonstration of
 .Nkrumah's obsession with ide-
 ology, and consequent depar-
 ture from reality, has taken
 the form of a little book pub-
 lished last spring (and almost
 totally ignored in this coun-
 try) called "Consciencism," a
 "philosophy and ideology for
 decolonization  and  develop-
 ment, with particular reference
 to the African revolution."
 This book was pushed on
 Ghana with all the propaganda
 weapons available to the state,
 and  they  are  considerable:
 mass meetings, public speeches,
 front-page news reports.
 lengthy  (and   impenetrable)
 commentaries, full-page adver-
 tisements, broadcasts and dis-
 cussion groups---all running on
 for weeks. All of it seemed an
 acute example of loss of bal-
 ance, especially since not more
 than 5 per cent of the country
 was able to read the incredi-
 bly canriliex prose and not
 more than 1 per cent was able

 to make   y sense out of it.
 "Consci ncism" itself is never
 really exphtined-in fact, it Is
 nowhere defined nor is any at-
 tempt made to reveal whose
 conscience  is  being  talked
 about-but it seems to be an
 ideology mixing all those things
 .Nkrumah holds dearest, what-.
 ,ever they may be  It some-
 how combines, without, ever
 explaining just how, whatever
 Nkrumah chooses to mean by
 "Socialism"-materialism, hu-
 manism, egalitarianism, love
 thy-neighborism, "communal-
 ism in modern dress," "tradi-
 tional  African society"  and
 much more-with whatever he
 found valuable in winning in-
 dependence-mass party, elite
 vanguard, mass propaganda-
 cunt - education, "positive ac-
 tion,"  authoritarian  control,
 etc. Throw all these together,.
 stir with long words and philo-
 sophical  gobbledygook,       and
 comes ':Consciencism."
 In a way, the book partakes
 of the very unreality that in-
 spired it. "Consciencism" holds
 that "matter has an original
 power of self-motion,"  "the
 fundamental law of evolution
 is  dialectical,"  that "space
 must, to the extent that it is
 real, derive its properties from
 those of matter" and that with
 its principles "the mind-body
 problem is solved."
 The last chapter is almost
 undecipherable and its unreal-
 ity suggests that whoever con-'
 cocted it might be certifiably
 insane. Here the problems of
 all societies (especially colo-
 nial ones) are solved through
 symbolic logic : "Let Pa repre-
 sent the positive action in an
 individual," "Let cg represent
 philosophical consciencism as
 elaborated by the conditions of
 g and the experience and con-
 sciousness of Its people," and
 so on in bewildering variety.
 Then it is but a simple Ein-
 steinian task to see that "there-
 fore a general formula arises
 thus:
 S -'m-{-C+D+UGi"
 futile to try to foretell what
 the deep and chaotic personal-
 ity of Kwame Nkrumah will
 mean for Ghana in the years
 ahead, for it is in the nature of
 such a soul that It is irrational,
 uncertain, unpredictable.
 Ghana today is, in a very
 real sense, a product of this
 complex personality. The cocoa
 farmer, whose crop forms Gha-
 '
 na
 s only major export, depends
 or ."hence the progressive un-   for his existence on the deci-
 ion of liberated territories, for                                                                 sions Nkrumah makes as to
 example, a union of African      whom to trade with; the see-
 states, might be ... represent-                                                                       ondary-school student in the

 It makes no better sense in
 context than out.
 At this juncture it seems
 k-1
 earnestly solicited to build to-
 morrow's nation, depends for
 his future on the content Nkru-
 mah chooses to give the uni-
 versities and on the opinion of
 the local party officer:  the
 civil servant in the Accra of-
 fice, whose skills are required
 to develop the minerals and
 build the factories, depends for
 his job on the projects that
 occur to Nkrumah's craggy,
 mind and his willingness to
 accept them unquestioningly.
 Over the entire country, from
 the seas to the savannah, on
 its economy, its politics, its so-
 ciety,  the  long  shadow  of
 Nkrumah is cast.
 It may be that his unreality
 will be adjusted, his vision
 cleared-but just now it seems
 likely that the land must en-
 dure more and more of his
 vagaries. And that will spell a
 sorrow for Ghana of which the
 man behind the walls of Flag-
 staff House  may never be
 aware.

 Soviet Historians on Soviet Historiogr22hy
 of the Period 1933 ---1241
 (from the Polish journal Kultura, Paris, No. 5/211) 1965)
 On June 17 and 18, 196+ there was an interesting discussion at the
 USSR Academy of Science's Institute of History on the "draft" of Volume
 IX in the series The History of the USSR from the Most Ancient Timees,
 which covers the period 1933 - 1941*  Some foreign students who were in
 Moscow at the time were present and wrote down, though perhaps not always
 accurately and in detail, the most striking excerpts from the discussion.
 Despite the possible inaccuracies, there can be no doubt that the discus-
 sion was unusually interesting:  it testifies to a fairly broad range of
 "freedom of speech," to the personal bravery of the speakers, and to a
 general hatred of the supposedly revered "great Stalin."
 Alexander Paviovich Korushev began the discussion with a criticism
 of the "draft's" treatment of the period during the second five-year
 Plan* W1nn he said that in 1933, students standing in line to receive
 a bowl of soup fainted from hunger, cries of protest were heard in the
 auditorium.  The speaker answered them by saying that he had seen this
 himself. He added that the "draft" ought to describe the conditions and
 system of food rationing in more detail.  He continued:
 Korushev:  During the second five-year plan, many projects such as
 the White Sea Canal were built by the inhabitants of forced labor
 camps who have never been rehabilitated.  Only the leaders have
 been rehabilitated, not the masses.       The IX Volume should at least
 mention how many forced laborers took part in these projects.  The
 condition of the peasants in the kolkhozes should also be described:
 in 1933 their condition was worse than in 1929, worse even than in
 1913.  ("If that is true, then why was the October Revolution nec-
 essary?" called Professor Genkina from the auditorium.)  The slo-
 gans of collectivization were good only for export; there were no
 material incentives.  The kolkhozniks each received two kilograms
 of grain per labor-day while producing 69 kilograms:  the state
 took over the other 67.  The "draft" should mention the distribu-
 tion of agricultural produce between those who produced it and the
 state.  And what about the Stalin-Hitler Pact in 1939?  Were there
 any secret clauses?  The western press says that there were such
 clauses on Poland and other questions.  If this is true, it should
 be indicated in the "draft"; if it is not true, it should be shown
 that the western press is lying.  And the war with Finland.  What
 lessons did the Soviet army learn from it?  It is stated in the
 draft that the defense industry increased its output by two to two
 and a half times in the years 1938 - 1940, but the production of
 tanks, arms, and airplanes did not increase at all.  What called

 forth the "increase"?  How many officers were liquidated during
 the purges?  Thirty-three thousand or forty thousand?  Our array
 was without commanders on the eve of the war.  Was there any sort
 of plan for conducting the war?  The DC Volume should explain why
 the commanders of the General Staff were changed so often in the
 years 1940-1941, and should tell what the strength of the army was
 in men and arms.
 In the ensuing discussion, the following people made interesting
 comments :
 Yekirim:  Praise of the fanaticism with which Stalin built social-
 ism is out of place in the IX Volume.  There was fanaticism before
 the period of the "cult," but during the period of the "cult"
 Stalin only hindered the construction of socialism.  The repres-
 sions reached their culmination in 1937.  Why doesn't the IX Vol-
 ume elucidate the origin of the repressive measures and why does
 it say nothing of the fact that torture was used to extract con-
 fessions from people?  The names of the people who landed in
 prison during the "cult" should be enumerated.
 Tomunov:  It is not true that Hitler's coming to power brought the
 downfall of democracy in the Soviet Union.  This was Stalin's fault.
 The period of the "cult" was a definite epoch in the history of the
 USSR, and the DC Volume should explain this, as well as why and to
 what extent the people believed in Stalin.
 Nekrasova:  The five-year plans were unrealistic.  This should be
 indicated in the discussion of the third five-year plan.
 Prof. Genkina:  The previous speakers were too critically disposed.
 If the slogans of the collectivization were proclaimed only to de-
 ceive the west, and the structure of our state has remained the
 same as it was in the thirties, then what conclusions are people
 to come to?  Why would the party have tolerated this for thirty
 years?  The IX Volume provokes the reader too much.  In the latest
 historical studies, Stalin is hardly mentioned.  This is incorrect,
 because students will ask, "and where was Stalin?"  In this re-
 spect, the I!C Volume maintains the correct point of view.  But it
 is often repetitive, and there are too many contradictions in it.
 It is also untrue to say that there is now no access to the archives.
 Genkina's last assertion produced an animated argument among those
 present on the extent to which scholars can use the archives for their
 studies.  Roshal stated that in the Museum of the October Revolution,
 the second and seventeenth sections are still closed.  It developed that
 the second section contained documents on Lenin, but it was not explained
 what was In the seventeenth section.

 Kurits:  There are too many contradictions in the IX Volume.
 History should be written simply, just as it happened.  The puni-
 tive agencies of the NKVD should be considered.
 Ulyanovskaya:  The TX Volume should explain our participation in
 the Spanish Civil War and state how many volunteers there were and
 how many tanks were sent.  It is long since time to reveal these
 secrets and many more like them.  Was Nikolayev (the assassin of
 Kirov)  expelled from the party for being a partisan of Zinoviev?
 Were the purge trials secret or open?  (Voice from the audience:
 "If they were open, it was only for agents of the MLVD;")  And what
 about Gamarnik's suicide?  He was buried as an enemy of the people,
 but arrested for being too popular.  The names of the people who
 brought about Pokrovsky's downfall, especially those who are still
 active, should be published.
 Aleksandr Vlamimirovich Snyegov's speech  aroused particular in-
 terest.  He arrived at the meeting late, after Genkina's speech, and
 spoke without notes.  His speech met with the approval of those present
 on the whole, despite occasional protests.
 Snyegov:  We agree that the thirties was a period full of contra-
 dictions during which the Soviet Union both advanced and fell back
 at the same time.  The IX Volume's half-truths in its description
 of that time still represent tremendous progress in comparison with
 the complete lies of previous historical works on the period.  The
 question arises, "for whom is the IX Volume intended?"  To judge
 from its composition, it is intended for those who already know a
 fair amount about the period.  There should consequently be more
 names, not necessarily of all those rehabilitated, but certainly
 the greater part.
 If the Volume does not speak the truth, then it is not history.  In
 many works on the thirties, kow-towing is mixed with lies - and this is
 called history.  The IX Volume should describe the artificial obstacles
 placed in the path of progress; Kaganovich's role should be explained.
 1930 was the most difficult year for agriculture in our history.  The
 IX Volume should indicate the difficulties which Stalin personally
 created during collectivization and explain why, despite these diffi-
 culties, collectivization was nonetheless able to move forward.  On the
 "cult":  was there much genuine opposition to Stalin during this period?
 In all probability, there was none whatsoever.  Was the execution of
 Kamenov and Zinoviev for espionage necessary?  (Voice from the audience:
 "No:")  The IX Volume should also make clear who signed falsified docu-
 ments for the trials.  We all know that there will be other editions of
 this volume.  The chief editor has an important problem, but words to
 express the whole truth ought to be found.  The psychological riddle of
 Stalin should be resolved and an answer given to the question, "what did
 he give the country?" Stalin's provocations of various peoples should
 be explained.  It should be proved that there was no opposition to Stalin
 at this time; the right words must be found to present this.  What was

 the significance of the battle with Trotsky?  Was it senseless?  If
 there were only twelve Trotskyites in the concentration camps, can we
 conclude that the other 80,000 were Leninists?  Soviet historians have
 endlessly repeated Stalin's hackneyed phrases about lefts, rights, and
 Trotskyites; more sensible terms must be found. All this leads only to
 the profanation of our banner in the world; nothing has hurt the cause
 of socialism more than Stalin's actions in the thirties.
 Was it really necessary to liquidate the Polish revolutionaries in
 1938? Wasn't this valuable aid for Hitler?  I hope you understand what
 I'm talking about.  Why is the partition of Poland praised in the IX Vol-
 ume?                          What did it contribute to the defense of the USSR?  The eye-
 witnesses who are still alive should be consulted.  This is a very dif-
 ficult volume, and I'm happy that I'm not responsible for it.
 Snyegov's speech concluded the first day's discussion, but its
 tone dominated the next day's session as well.  The following speakers
 made the most interesting remarks.
 Polikov:  This book has many weak places, especially in its descrip-
 tion of the events from 1938 - 191+1.  It is incorrect to assert
 that the trials of 1934-38 were directed solely against the oppo-
 sition.                                    The military trials were not trials at all and were con-
 ducted in complete secrecy.  This must be explained.  We have
 become accustomed to paint everything in black and white.  We must
 learn to offer more complex evaluations.  Snyegov's position on the
 Treaty of 1939 and the partition of Poland is not entirely correct.
 Stalin had grounds for his action, namely, the elimination of an
 evil perpetrated earlier; the Treaty returned part of Poland and
 Byelorussia to us.
 Gessen:  How are we to explain the rise of the "cult?"  The DC
 Volume speaks only of repressions, but other sources must be exam-
 ined.  Nothing is said of the population's  material condition; the
 volume should have shown what the socialist revolution has given
 the people.  Nothing is said of Soviet armed might; the details of
 the repressions against the military should have been given.  Much
 has already been written on this in military periodicals.  What
 was the influence of the repressions on our military preparedness?
 The consequences were greater than the mere elimination of the
 higher commanders.  Tukhachevsky clearly foresaw the development
 of the second World War, but since he had been condemned as an
 enemy of the people, all his ideas were cast aside.  This should
 have been discussed, but nothing is said of it in the IX Volume.
 Finally, all aspects of the "cult of personality" should be clari-
 fied in detail.  How did Stalin and his cohorts -  Kaganovich,
 Malenkov, Molotov - attain their aims?

 Chaadayeva, an Old Bolshevik, spoke very emotionally:
 How do I personally explain the rise of the "cult?"  Did we believe
 in Stalin?  We did.  We felt that Stalin didn't take into account
 certain aspects of the repressions.  It is now time for us to speak
 out on the subject.  There was a huge difference between Lenin and.
 Stalin.  Lenin was a great humanist, and this is what attracted us
 to him.   Even the Menshevik opposition could not help but like him;
 Vladimir Ilich admitted his errors:  he stated frankly that the
 Bolsheviks were making many stupid mistakes, but he justified them
 on the basis of the fact that this was their first attempt to govern
 a country and conduct a socialist revolution.  People heard him,
 believed him, and followed him.  Lenin listened to the opposition
 and learned from it.  Before his death, Lenin failed to designate
 his successor.  Svedlov, whom Lenin had treated as a son, had died.
 No one remained to him.  He warned the party about Stalin and rec-
 ommended the introduction of a collective government.  (At this
 point, Chaadayeva began a sharp personal attack on Stalin, but
 the chairman requested her to limit her remarks to the book.)  I
 sincerely confess that I don't know how to explain the rise of the
 "cult."  It was as if the Central Committee had ceased to exist;
 Stalin became the only leader.   The tragedy of this development was
 that when the most important decisions were being considered, the
 old tradition of turning to the people and listening to it was
 abandoned.  From the end of 1929 on, the Cheka ruled the party,
 intimidated gatherings, etc.  Stalin surrounded himself with people
 who set him on a throne and blindly surrendered all power into his
 hands.  This was a great error:  the party should always control the
 actions of its leaders.
 Lopatov:  This Volume is much better than other works on the same
 period, and its criticism is much more realistic.  However, criti-
 cism of the "cult" must go deeper and it must be contrasted with
 Leninism. We cannot stop, as has hitherto been done, with super-
 ficial criticism.  The facts must be set forth in greater detail and
 the complex personality of Stalin must be analyzed.  This can be
 done as it has been done with Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great.
 Stalin trampled on all the accepted norms of conduct not only in his
 relations with capitalist countries, but with socialist countries
 as well.  We must speak of his mistakes in this area, as well as the
 problem of collectivization.  We have payed, dearly for his innumer-
 able mistakes.  For example, highly trained and educated people went
 to work in the country, but they couldn't remain there because the
 conditions were too terrible. People arrived and fled.  This should
 be mentioned. There are many distortions in the draft on the IX
 Volume, and they should be eliminated.

 Gusev:  The book's structure is incorrect, and there are many rep-
 etitions as a result.  The contemporary structure of Soviet society
 should have been examined.  Who, essentially was liquidated?  What
 social organizations were destroyed, and what significance did this
 have?   These questions must be answered in order to understand what
 happened in the thirties.   The IX Volume should describe Stalin's
 role in the construction of a personal dictatorship and the trans-
 formation of social organizations and institutions into puppets.
 The IX Volume, however, should not limit itself to the description
 of errors; the Soviet economy developed powerfully, and this should
 be stressed.
 A young aspirant, whose name was not recorded:
 The rise of the "cult" should be described better and more exten-
 sively.  After the XXII Party Congress, it became clear that the
 repressions were not accidents, but Stalin's conscious policy.
 Evidence should be given in exact figures.  Announcements on the
 number of victims have varied from hundreds to millions.  It should
 also be explained why a number of people have not been rehabili-
 tated, despite the fact that evidence on which they were convicted
 has been discredited.  The IX Volume also leaves important ques-
 tions of foreign policy unexplained.  Take the war with Finland.
 Why did the Soviet army suffer defeats at the beginning?  This was,
 after all, the army that defeated Hitler.
 Yukabovskaya, a member of the editorial board for the IX Volume:
 Many specific problems are still insufficiently studied, a fact
 which complicated the preparation of the text.  Only after the con-
 demnation of the "cult of personality" has it become possible to
 begin the study of this period.  During the period of the "cult,"
 we were obliged to write about everything as either exceptionally
 good or exceptionally bad - white or black with nothing in between.
 But this tendency has remained with us to the present.  In this
 respect we are still under Stalin's influence.  Have we really been
 able to give an objective appraisal of any individual, with a delin-
 eation of both his good and bad features?  (The audience agrees,
 "no.")  But no one is either a God or a devil.  Today we can no
 longer write this way; we must write in such a way that we won't be
 ashamed of our work in ten years.  So we can't use Stalin's methods
 in dealing with the "cult."  We must be objective.  The party would
 not have tolerated Stalin if he had been a criminal and a villain.
 We have said everything that we could about the trials; they were
 not secret.  Chervyakov, Ordzhonikdze, and many others committed
 suicide.
 Danilov:  I wish to return to the question about half-truths posed
 by Snyegov.  It is not true that the entire truth was known to the
 authors and that they concealed some of it.  Much of the IX Volume

 is based on research conducted earlier.  Many problems will have
 to be studied more deeply before the rise of the "cult of personal-
 ity" is explained:
 Verkhin:  Before we can answer many of the questions which have
 arisen in the course of this discussion, we ought to consider the
 basic problem of the role of the individual in history.  Similarly,
 we must determine the role of the masses before we can answer other
 questions.  In my opinion, social forces are the most important.
 In the final analysis, the rise of the "cult of personality" did
 not alter the socialist character of Soviet society and has not
 hindered its subsequent development.  Consequently, the victory of
 socialism in the USSR should be stressed rather than the rise of the
 "cult of personality,"
 On this note, the Soviet historians' discussion of the treatment of
 the treatment of the Stalin period in The History of the USSR from the
 Most Ancient Times came to an end.  In closing the session, its chairman,
 Academician Kim, called the discussion fruitful in that it had uncovered
 many shortcomings in the draft of the IX Volume.  Some of the speakers
 had gone too far, he continued, and made impermissable judgements, as,
 for example, Snyegov in his treatment of foreign policy.  The chairman
 could also not agree with Snyegov's assertion that the authors of the
 IX Volume had knowingly written "half-truths":  many questions remain
 unanswered to the present day so that such a reproach is completely
 unfounded.
 "I always insist on the truth," said the chairman, "and the truth
 is that during the rule of Stalin and with Stalin, we built socialism in
 our country." As historians, we should write about what actually happened,
 and not about what might have happened or what should have happened.  The
 question of the "cult of personality" should not cloud our vision of the
 fact that our country achieved outstanding successes.  The IX Volume is
 not a monograph on the "cult of personality" or the repressions which
 occurred as a result of it.
 Although it may be concluded from the chairman's closing words that
 the next (or final) reworking of the draft for the IX Volume will not
 differ greatly from the proposed text, the frankness of the speakers and
 the very fact that a public discussion of this sort took place in Moscow,
 indicates that far reaching changes have occurred in the nature of the
 Soviet intelligentsia.

 COMMUNIST CHINESE DEPLORE SOVIET ACTIONS
 ON YOUTH MEETING
 New China News Agency, English Service,
 20 July 1965
 Peking, 20 July--The spokesman of the All-China Youth Federation in
 a statement today commented on the decision adopted at a recent meeting
 of the international preparatory committee of the ninth World Youth and
 Student Festival in Tampere, Finland, and on the press statement made by
 Petr Reshetov, chairman of the Committee of Soviet Youth Organizations,
 on 14 July.
 He said:  The international preparatory committee of the ninth World
 Youth Festival held a meeting in Tampere, Finland, from 8 to 10 July.
 In spite of the opposition of the Chinese, Indonesian, and Japanese dele-
 gates, the leaders of the Soviet youth organizations manipulated the meet-
 ing to pass a decision which interfered in Algeria's internal affairs and
 called for reconsideration as to the venue of the Festival.  In a press
 statement in Moscow on 14 July, Petr Reshetov, chairman of the Committee
 of Soviet Youth Organizations, expressed full support for the decision
 and scurrilously attacked those youth organizations which differed with
 it.  This is another serious move by the leaders of the Soviet youth or-
 ganizations to undermine the festival, interfere in Algeria's internal
 affairs, and split the unity of the international youth and student move-
 ment.
 It has already been decided that the ninth Festival will be held in
 Algeria.  The Algerian side has repeatedly declared that the ninth fes-
 tival would be held in Algeria as was decided earlier.  Consequently,
 there is no reason whatever to have another discussion.  Despite all
 this, the leaders of the Soviet youth organizations manipulated the
 international preparatory committee of the festival to pass the decision
 for "reconsideration' of the question of the venue of the festival.
 In his statement of 14 July, Reshetov, while acknowledging that the youth
 of Algeria had contributed greatly to the preparatory work of the festival,
 once again declared his full support for the erroneous decision of the
 international preparatory committee.  He, however, made no mention of the
 Algerian stand that there should be no change in the venue?..of the festival.
 This exposes the hypocrisy and double-dealing on the part of the leaders
 of the Soviet youth organizations.
 After the Algerian event on 19 June, leaders of the Committee of Soviet
 Youth Organizations plotted in the international youth and student organ-
 izations under their control to transfer the ninth festival to be held in
 Africa for the first time to a place in Europe.  Their activities are
 known to us and to many other youth organizations.  It is no secret at
 all.  To cover up their sinister activities which cannot bear the light

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040003-3
 of day, Reshetov actually said that what was said about these activities
 was a "lie" fabricated by others.  In so doing, he made what he wanted
 to conceal more conspicuous.  People who have enough common sense would
 ask:  If they have no intention to transfer the festival from Algeria
 in Africa, why should they insist on "reconsideration" of the question
 of the venue of the festival, a question already settled?  To speak the
 truth, they try to change the venue of the festival to suit the foreign
 policy of their own country.
 It is obvious that the decision adopted on 25 June by the permanent com-
 mission for the festival was brazen interference in Algieria's internal
 affairs and was strongly opposed by youth organizations of many countries.
 The Algerian side in its two communiques issued on 3 July definitely
 pointed out this fact.  Reshetov in his statement on 14 July once again
 supported this decision.  Such persistence in crude interference in the
 internal affairs of another country is indeed rarely seen in the inter-
 national youth movement.
 In his statement, Reshetov actually called those who took exception to this
 erroneous practice "enemies" who allegedly wanted to "split the youth
 movement."  The leaders of the Soviet youth organizations took the enemy
 as their friend and friend their enemy.  They invariably took those anti-
 imperialist youth organizations which differed with them as their enemy
 and took U.S. imperialism--the real enemy of the youth of all lands--as
 their friend.  People like them who take the enemy as their friend are
 the worst splitters.
 It is no accident that the leaders of the Soviet youth organizations com-
 mitted these errors.  They have long been accustomed to wield the baton
 in the international youth movement, to manipulate and make the inter-
 national youth and student organizations, including the World Festival
 of Youth and Students, serve their general line of "peaceful coexistence"
 which means Soviet-American cooperation for world domination.
 It may be recalled that it was no other than the leaders of the Soviet
 youth organizations who had coerced the international preparatory com-
 mittee to submit to the unreasonable demand of the imperialists that the
 Algerian delegation must not be allowed to carry the flag of the Algerian
 National Liberation Front at the seventh festival in Vienna in 1959.  It
 was again they who prevented many delegations from carrying anti-
 imperialist and anti-U.S. placards in a demonstration and refused to al-
 low the Palestine delegation to take part in the festival in the name of
 Palestine and under the Palestine flag at the eighth festival in Helsinki
 in 1962.  It was they who stubbornly opposed having anything anti-
 imperialist among the slogans of the ninth festival; they who included
 in its program a series of activities, extremely preposterous in character,
 to extol the United Nations, a tool of U.S. imperialism, for its aggres-
 sion; they who preach "peaceful coexistence" and "general and complete
 2                                (Cont.)

 disarmement," and they who spread the yellow culture and the American
 way of life at the meeting of the ninth festival's international pre-
 paratory committee held at the end of last year.
 Now they have made use of the ninth festival to interfere in Algeria's
 internal affairs.  No fine words can gloss over their features from sham
 unity and a real split, sham anti-imperialism and real capitulation, and
 sham revolution and real sabotage.
 Chinese youth resolutely oppose the foul activities of the leaders of
 the Soviet youth organizations to undermine the unity of the international
 youth movement and the decision adopted at the preparatory committee meet-
 ing held in Tampere under their manipulation, for continued interference
 in Algeria's internal affairs and sabotage against the holding of the
 ninth festival in Algiers.  However, the leaders of the Soviet youth organ-
 izations may prevaricate and slander, they cannot escape the responsibility
 for wrecking the festival, interfering in Algeria's internal affairs, and
 splitting the unity of the international youth and students movement.
 Additional Details
 New China News Agency, English Service, 20 July 1965
 Peking, 20 July--The international preparatory committee for the ninth
 World Youth Festival held a plenary meeting 8-10 July at Tampere, Finland,
 according to a report from Helsinki.  Under the manipulation of the Soviet
 delegate, the committee rammed through the meeting a resolution which is
 a new flagrant act of interference in the internal affairs of Algeria and
 a disruptive move to prevent the festival from being held in that country.
 This threw further light on the ugly features of the Soviet delegate in
 creating a further split in the international youth movement.
 The meeting was hurriedly opened on the afternoon of 8 July in the absence
 of the Algerian delegate, the chairman of the international preparatory
 committee for the festival, and delegates of many other countries.  It
 had neither a democratically elected leading organ, the presidium, nor
 an agenda.
 The delegates of China and Indonesia said that the meeting must not be
 held without the participation of the delegate from Algeria,, the host
 country of the festival.  They demanded that the meeting be postponed
 until the arrival of the Algerian delegate, but the person who presided
 over the meeting, instead of heeding this demand, arbitrarily made the
 meeting vote and adopt an absurd procedural proposal advanced by the
 Yugoslav delegate.  The proposal limited the speech of each of the members
 of the preparatory committee to 10 minutes, and in violation of the prac-
 tice of international conferences, forbade the observers of the Belgian
 Communist Youth Union and other organizations from speaking at the meeting.

 The meeting adjourned after brief morning and afternoon sittings on 9 July.
 During this time the Soviet delegate busied himself with conspiratorial
 moves behind the scenes and spread malicious rumors about the Algerian
 political situation.  The Algerian delegate, who had just arrived, spoke
 at a sitting that lasted from the evening of 9 July to the early morning
 of 10 July.  He renewed the demand that the ninth world festival be held
 in Algiers.  He proposed, however, that its convocation be postponed until
 next year.
 Chien Ta-wei, head of the Chinese delegation, said that the international
 preparatory committee meeting should discuss ways and means of holding
 the festival in Algeria so successfully that it would become a grand re-
 view of the anti-imperialist forces of the youth of all countries.  It
 should not discuss the question of the venue of the festival because
 that had been decided on a year ago.  He expressed firm opposition to
 the scheme to prevent the festival from being held in Africa.  He reaf-
 firmed the demand that the festival be held in Algeria as decided.    He
 also cited facts to show how the permanent commission under the manipu-
 lation of a big power interfered flagrantly in the internal affairs of
 Algeria.  He demanded that the erroneous resolution of 25 June be rescinded.
 When the Chinese delegate spoke a handful of people pounded the tables in
 an attempt to create a disturbance.
 The delegates of Indonesia and Japan appealed to the youth of all coun-
 tries to be vigilant against the scheme of imperialism and its agents to
 split the anti-imperialist front and wreck the festival.  They demanded
 that the festival be held in Algeria as agreed.  They exposed the various
 despicable schemes to interfere in Algeria's internal affairs.  The Ru-
 manian delegate said that only the Algerian people had the right to solve
 their own problems and no intervention in Algeria's internal affairs should
 be allowed.
 Soviet Delegate Petr Reshetov failed to mention a single word about hold-
 ing the youth festival in Algeria.  Instead, he proposed the setting up
 of a subcommittee to reconsider the venue of the festival.  This fully
 exposed the plot of the Soviet delegate to have the festival held outside
 Algeria.  Reshetov also viciously attacked by insinuation the youth organ-
 izations which stood for holding the festival in Algeria.
 Singing the same old theme of the Soviet delegate who manipulated the
 meeting, some delegates proposed a change in the venue of the festival,
 saying that Algeria had no qualifications for the festival.  They sug-
 gested that a small group be formed to study a new venue and demanded
 that the meeting approve the erroneous resolution adopted by the dominant
 commission on 25 June.
 Before the meeting adopted its resolution, the Chinese, Indonesian, and
 Japanese delegates put forth a joint draft resolution reaffirming that
 the youth festival should still be held in Algiers and demanding that the

 meeting rescind the erroneous resolution of the dominant commission
 which interfered in Algeria's internal affairs and sabotaged the hold-
 ing of the youth festival in Algeria.  But the draft resolution was
 rejected by the Soviet and other delegates.  The manipulator of the
 meeting forced through a resolution which approved the 25 June resolu-
 tion of the dominant commission, and proposed the postponement of the
 youth festival and reconsideration of the so-called venue of the festi-
 val.  When the resolution was put to a vote the Chinese, Indonesian, and
 Japanese delegates voted against it and made statements condemning the
 undemocratic proceedings of the meeting, pointing out that the resolution
 was wrong.  The Rumanian delegate abstained from voting.
 After the voting the Chinese delegation issued a statement stressing that
 the meeting was a very unseemly one.  The resolution forced through the
 meeting was a continuation of the dominant commission resolution of 25
 June which grossly interferred in Algeria's internal affairs.  The scheme
 was to undermine the holding of the youth festival in Africa.  The state-
 ment pointed out in conclusion that this nefarious practice by the Soviet
 delegate, manipulator of the meeting, could only further split the inter-
 national youth movement and that he should be held fully responsible for
 the serious consequences arising from his action.

 _Excerpts of Sukarno Speech
 At PKI Anniversary Rally
 What Brother Aidit said just now was true.  He said that in the past
 weeks, there was commotion in the camp of the imperialists, first, because
 the PKI was going to observe its 45th founding anniversary on a large scale,
 and second, because at the PKI founding anniversary rally, the President
 of the Indonesian Republic, Sukarno, would be present and deliver a speech.
 There was a commotion within as well as outside the imperialist group.
 In the framework of the policy we are pursuing, namely the policy
 which I have advocated since long ago, the policy of unifying all pro-
 gressive revolutionary forces, it is no wonder that the Indonesian Repub-
 lican Government embraces the PKI.  That I, as mandatary of the MPRS em-
 brace the PKI, and that I, as great leader of the Indonesian revolution,
 embrace the PKI.  This is because the PKI is unde.iiably a strong element
 in the task of completing the revolution.
 Just now Brother Aidit mentioned why the PKI has become a great
 party and why it has expanded.  The PKI has become strong.  The PKI is
 now a party with a membership of 3 million persons, with 3 million youths,
 and 20 million sympathizers.  Why has the PKI become this kind of a party?
 It is because the PKI consistently has been a progressive revolutionary
 party.  There is no doubt, brothers, that the Indonesian revolution can-
 not be completed if all pregressive revolutionary forces are not unified
 into one force.  I embrace the PKI.
 Speaking of Nasakom, brothers, I once told the Indonesian public
 that all delegations to the recent 10th anniversary celebration of the
 first Afro Asian conference were deeply impressed by Nasakom.  They were
 surprised to see that Indonesia, which, according to what the imperialists
 used to say, was going to collapse in no time, was going to fall in no
 time, was a country whose people would die of hunger, was a country in
 chaos.  On the contrary, is evidently a strong country whose people are
 evidently calm and whose people are evidently well and healthy.  This is
 so, because Indonesia is following a Nasakom policy.
 Nasakom has been admired by all delegations to the 10th anniversary
 celebration of the Afro-Asian conference.  Nasakom has even served as
 an example to Afro-Asian conference.  Nasakom has even served as an ex-
 ample to Afro Asian nations in their struggle against imperialists.  The
 moment the delegations understood this, it became much easier for me to
 explain to them why Indonesia has taken the initiative to hold Conefo,
 the Conference of the New Emerging Forces.  In fact, the delegations
 first of all were impressed by the fact that it was Indonesia which came
 up with the idea of the new emerging forces.  It was no other country but
 Indonesia.  Now I am working hard to realize a union of all emerging forces.
 Now, Indonesia wants to hold Conefo, the Conference of the New Emerging
 Forces.

 Once the delegations to the 10th anniversary celebration of the first
 Afro-Asian conference had been impressed by Nasakom, it became so easy to
 explain to them that Conefo is actually an international Nasakom.  Why
 can it be called an international Nasakom?  Because in the projected
 Conefo we want to unify all anti-imperialist forces, no matter on which
 side they stand, as long as they are anti-imperialist in nature.
 In Indonesia itself, there have been those who asked me:  Bung, why
 do you call your policy of unifying all anti-imperialist and revolutionary
 forces Nasadom?  Why use "kom"?  Why not, as in 1926, when Bung Karno for
 the first time broached the idea of unifying all revolutionary forces--
 nationalist, Islamic, Marxist, or nationalist, religious, Marxist forces
 --use, for instance, Nasamarx.   Why use the expression Nasakom?  Why use
 "kom" and not "Marx?"  Why not use Nasamarx instead of Nasakom?   How is
 it that Bung Karno uses Nasakom? Now listen carefully, brothers.  The
 term which has been most abused b   olitical scoundrels is "Marxist." You
 know that, for instance, the PSI (Indonesian Socialist Party--ed.), which
 I have abolished, used to boast and claim:  We, Marxists; we, Marxists;
 we, Marxists.  But let me say here that they are not Marxists.   They are
 the villains of Marxism.  Therefore, I did not want to use the expression
 Nasamarx.  If I use Nasamarx, I am afraid that former PSI members might
 join the movement, and all along they have been counterrevolutionary.
 They are villains of Marxism.  Besides, I purposely chose the "kom" in
 Nasakom, because here in Indonesia, there are many people with "kom-phobia."
 They fear "kom."  They are afraid of the PKI; they hate the PKI; they want
 to destroy the PKI completely.
 Brothers, with regard to the forthcoming Afro Asian conference in
 Algeria, if possible, we shall unite with Asian African countries at the
 second Afro Asian conference in Algeria.  However, if this is impossible
 --for instance, there are countries which do not want to take part because
 they are pro-Malaysia--then it would be better for them not to take part
 in the conference.  They had better stay outside the Afro Asian conference,
 even if we have to hold the second Afro Asian conference with a smaller
 number of countries which, however, are all anti-imperialist.  This is
 better than holding a conference in which a large number of countries take
 part, but among which there are imperialist tools and lackeys.
 Now, I would like to inform you that the majority of Asian and African
 countries do not want to accept Malaysia at the second Afro Asian conference.
 It is true that there are one or two or three countries which accept
 Malaysia, brothers.  However, as I said just now, thanks to God Almighty,
 the majority of Asian and African countries share Indonesia's stand and
 reject Malaysia's participation at the second Afro Asian conference.  There
 is no doubt, borthers, that Malaysia is an imperialist lackey.
 At an earlier PKI congress I said:  PKI, go onward!  Now I say:  PKI,
 go onward, onward, onward; never retreat!  Brothers, that was my message
 at this 45th anniversary rally of the PKI.  I thank you.

 Seventh World Peace Congress
 Helsinki, Finland
 10-15 July 1965
 General Statement
 The unanimously adopted statement issued at the conclusion of the
 Congress summarized its work:
 "The questions before the congress were discussed concretely
 and in depth in seven commissions:  1) support for the people
 of Vietnam in their just struggle for independence, unity, and
 peace; 2) the liberation of peoples under colonial domination,
 the preservation of national sovereignty, the struggle against
 apartheid and racism, and the violation of human rights; 3) dis-
 armament; 4) elimination of the vestiges of World War II and
 European security; 5) the economic sovereignty of nations; 6)
 the economic and social consequences of the arms race, the re-
 conversion from war production to peace production; 7) the
 creation of an atmosphere favorable to peace, cooperation of
 peace organizations, and problems of the U.N. organization."
 It commented on the general situation of the world
 "The Congress has met at a time when the world situation is
 very grave.  U.S. political and military leaders have entered
 upon a policy of armed aggression and military adventures, as
 the cases of Vietnam, Santo Domingo, and the Congo clearly
 prove.  This armed aggression and military adventures strikes
 a grave blow at the aspirations of the peoples for detente and
 peaceful coexistence.  The spearhead of the imperialist attack
 is in southeast Asia, where American armed forces have un-
 leashed aggression against the people of South Vietnam."
 It cited other areas of conflict and "imperialist aggression" which
 included "Laos and Cambodia using the bases set up in Thailand and Japan";
 Africa where "Portuguese fascist colonialists with the aid of NATO are
 stepping up oppression" and spoke of the "threat to peace and international
 security" caused by efforts "to impose a white minority government on the
 African majority" in Rhodesia.  It cited other African countries where
 ''genuine independence is threatened by neocolonialist practices," and
 "imperialist plots."  It denounced tension in the Middle East resulting
 from "the existence of American and British military bases, the presence
 of an American fleet equipped with nuclear weapons, and the maneuvers of
 the imperialists and their supporters" against Arabs in Palestine, in the
 Arabian peninsula, and in Cyprus.  It spoke of "American imperialists"

 and their efforts "to maintain their domination over the countries of
 Latin America, and resorting to military intervention.'   It cited
 "colonial domination in the Caribbean" and the "military occupation of
 the Canal Zone" in Panama.  It spoke of the tense situation in Europe
 "as a consequence of rearmament instigated by NATO" and called for "the
 creation of a system of collective security in Europe" and the "Creation
 of a nuclear free zone in Central Europe."  It also called for "the es-
 tablishment of normal relations between the two German states at all
 levels, and the peaceful settlement of the German question."  It said,
 "it is more and more necessary and urgent to ban nuclear weapons, to
 destroy them and preclude their use."
 Finally,
 "The Congress calls on all peoples to demand that their govern-
 ments take action to isolate American imperialism and stop its
 aggression, to support the struggle of the peoples on every
 continent against colonialism, for genuine independence, free-
 dom, and economic and social development, and in opposition to
 neocolonialism and exploitation.  The congress calls on all
 people to take action to stop the arms race and obtain con-
 crete disarmament measures, to demand the dismantling of mili-
 tary bases and the withdrawal of troops stationed on foreign
 soil, and concrete measures for world security and the peace-
 ful settlement of issues in dispute."
 [Moscow, TASS, International Service
 in English, 15 July 19651
 Resolution on Vietnam
 At the conclusion of the meeting, a resolution on Vietnam, "the
 central question of the Congress," was adopted:
 "Expressing the feelings shared by billions of people through-
 out the world, the congress is deeply concerned about the war
 provoked by the policy of armed aggression of the U.S. im-
 perialists in contravention of the Geneva agreements of 1954,
 a war which is being intensified from day to day with the di-
 rect and increasing participation of the armed forces and
 even of U.S. strategic aircraft.  The congress expressed deep
 indi=gnation at the U.S. policy of escalation, which is dan-
 gerously extending the war beyond the borders of South Vietnam,
 including attacks and provocations against the Democratic Re-
 public of Vietnam, a sovereign and independent country, thus
 seriously endangering the peace and security of the peoples of
 southeast Asia and of the world."

 The resolution continued by calling for:  (1)"the immediate end of
 U.S. aggression in South Vietnam"; (2) "the immediate withdrawal of U.S.
 troops and their satellites from South Vietnam"; (3) "the removal of U.S.
 military bases from South Vietnam"; (4) "the immediate ending of bombing
 and other aggressive acts against the DRV."  It also said:  "the Na-
 tional Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam is the only true legal
 representative of the South Vietnamese people."  It continued:  the
 people of South Vietnam must be allowed to settle their own affairs with-
 out foreign interference...."
 "The congress makes an urgent appeal to the forces of peace and
 democratic organizations of the whole world to launch a broad,
 powerful, and uninterrupted movement embracing all sections of
 society, to give every possible support to the people of Vietnam
 in their just struggle against the U.S. aggressive war and for
 national independence, unity, and peace."
 [Moscow, TASS, International Service
 in .anglish, 15 July 19651
 Support for Chicom Position
 The Albanian press reported the 10 July dispute over procedural
 matters as
 "a violent struggle between those delegations that want to see
 normal progress in the work of the congress and the Soviet dele-
 gation and some other delegations that follow its example, who
 want to use the congress to popularize and promote the general
 capitulationist line of the Soviet revisionist leaders."
 It continued with a statement from Thanas Nado, head of the Albanian dele-
 gation, who demanded the right to present his delegation's views on the
 agenda and the proposed order of work:
 'The true reason for these proposals, which may be called 'gag-
 ging' proposals, is the fear of the Ichrushchevite revisionists,
 who are about to impose their line on our movement through the
 Soviet. Peace Committee, who are afraid to let those people ex-
 pressing points of view different from their own be heard in
 this hall.  They fear being faced with world public opinion
 and, being pushed by the irresistible desire to impose the
 policy of their government on the peace movement, seek to make
 this movement a prop for a policy of theirs which is in flagrant

 contradiction to the demands of millions of people from all
 continents fighting against the enemies of peace; they more-
 over demand support for these clauses, which are so damaging
 to the dignity of the honorable representatives present in
 this hall."
 [Tirana, ATA, International Service
 in French, 13 July 19651
 The next day, Foto Cami, an Albanian delegation member, charged
 that the Soviets "boast greatly about the aid and support they are giv-
 ing the Vietnamese people" and asked, "what is this aid and what is
 this support?"
 "we cannot remain silent and fail to unmask and condemn here
 the noisy and wholly demagogical declarations by the Soviet
 delegate, who in order to dupe people, has tried to pass off
 the attitude of the Khrushchevite Soviet leadership as a
 "firm anti-imperialist stand" and one "supporting the strug-
 gle of the Vietnamese people."  Undeniable facts testify that
 the worsening and the extension of the struggle in Vietnam is
 not only the result of the policy and the aggression of American
 imperialism, but also the result of the policy of unprincipled
 concessions and capitulation to the imperialist aggressor, of
 the policy of betrayal of the vital interests of the peoples
 pursued by N. Khrushchev's followers, who have made common
 cause with imperialism.  It is now clear that the American
 imperialists would not have acted with so much cruelty and
 arrogance had they not had the support of the Soviet leaders
 and their followers, whose supreme ideal is alleged peaceful
 coexistence and multilateral cooperation with American imperi-
 alism.... what preoccupies and worries the Soviet leaders more
 than any thing is not the fate of the Vietnamese people and
 their patriotic liberation struggle, but the fate of American
 imperialism, of the alliances and cooperation with it, the
 fate of the aggressor, whose defeat in Vietnam must be pre-
 vented, for this defeat would demolish their line of peaceful
 coexistence and the peaceful road, their club of superpowers,
 the all-powerfulness of atomic weapons, and the impossibility
 of victory by the nationl liberation struggles of the peoples
 in our era, and so forth."

 The conflict between the Soviets and the Chinese was spelled out
 by a speech made by Chao I-min, head of the Chinese delegation, who at-
 tacked "certain people [who] are pushing an erroneous line in the world
 peace movement," and said:
 "They do not genuinely oppose U.S. imperialism or support the
 oppressed nations in their struggle for emancipation.  In-
 stead they are actively preaching the settlement of world
 problems through Soviet-U.S. cooperation, general and com-
 plete disarmament, and an unprincipled peaceful coexistence
 in an effort to lead the peace movement astray.  As a con-
 sequence, there have appeared a series of major differences
 of principle in the course of the preparation of this congress
 and in its proceedings, as well as in the world peace movement
 itself.
 "Those who are pursuing this erroneous line in the peace move-
 ment are now raising a hue and cry about unity and concerted
 action, and asserting that we must not concentrate our main
 attention on what disunites us, but on what unites us, but it
 is they themselves who have destroyed the basis of unity and
 who are creating and enlarging the split.
 "The struggle against the policies of aggression and war pur-
 sued by imperialism with the United States at its head, consti-
 tutes the basis of unity for the world peace movement.  Without
 this basis, what can there be which unites us?  We must dis-
 tinguish between enemies and friends, unite real friends to
 oppose real enemies; and in no case should we reverse enemies
 and friends....
 "Those who have their baton to implement their erroneous line
 are not practicing democracy at all.  They do not allow con-
 sultation and discussion on an equal footing, and have con-
 sistently imposed their will on others.  They have carried
 on all kinds of disruptive activities within the World Peace
 Council, such as suppressing democracy, manipulating meetings,
 and splitting organizations.  These people have laid down quite
 a number of restrictive rules and regulations for this congress
 so that they can manipulate it at will and deprive others from
 addressing the plenary sessions.  The Chinese delegation firmly
 opposes these practices, and as it has been proved by what actu-
 ally happened, such undemocratic practices are most unpopular
 and cannot succeed...."

 Support for Soviet Position
 A Soviet spokesman answered the Albanian charge by reminding the
 gathering "that the Vietnamese delegation appreciates the Soviet aid,"
 and then walked out of the meeting.  [Prague, CTK International Service
 in English, 13 July 1965]  In support of the Soviet position,the Polish
 delegate called the Chicom pronouncement "damaging to the peace move-
 ment," and condemned it as an "attempt to split the congress."'  [Moscow,
 TASS, International Service in English, 13 July 1965, Helsinki dispatch]
 He elaborated his position by saying:
 'The socialist countries are supporters of the policy of peace-
 ful coexistence, the only alternative to nuclear war.  For us
 the struggle for peaceful coexistence is tantamount to the
 struggle against U.S. aggression and is in active and full
 solidarity with the national liberation movement.  The policy
 of the Soviet Union and of other socialist states does not
 leave any doubt as to this fact.  Therefore, I do not under-
 stand how is it possible to come forth here with charges about
 yielding to imperialism and attempting to cooperate with it.
 Such charges introduce false lines of division into our move-
 ment and bring harm to its unity and the force of its influence."
 [Warsaw, PAP, International Service
 in English, 13 July 1965]
 Other Communist media denounced the Albanian attack.  A Czech dis-
 patch called it "a slanderous and insulting attack on the Soviet Union
 and the world peace movement [which] did not meet any response from the
 crushing majority of the delegations."  [Prague, CTK, International Ser-
 vice in English, 13 July 1965]  A Rude Pravo correspondent spoke of the
 "constructive" discussions which were taking place at the meeting despite
 ''the gross and impudent conduct of the Albanian delegate who constantly
 strays from the given theme."  [Emil Sip, 13 July 1965 Rude Pravo].
 Another Czech correspondent said that the Albanian delegate "devoted
 his entire speech to insulting the Soviet Union."  The next day, Rude
 Pravo said "... the main thing is the prevalence of the spirit of unity
 and the effort to arrive at something practical and concrete.  For this
 reason, it is regrettable that the Chinese and Albanian delegations do
 not overlook any opportunity to use the forum for attack against the
 Soviet Union...."

 [Following is a translation of an article by Harry Schulze-
 Wilde in the German-language periodical Der Monat (The Month),
 Berlin, Vol XVII, No 201, June 1965, pages 39-61.]
 The date was 24 May 1940.  Three policemen stand chatting in front of
 the house at the corner of Wiener and Morelos Streets in the Coyoacan sec-
 tion of Mexico City.  This house had been the home of the world famous
 Russian revolutionary leader and founder of the Red Army, Leon Trotsky, for
 the past 3 years.   These three policemen were members of the 10-man police
 detail which the Mexican government had assigned the job of guarding the
 mansion which had been improved into a fortress.  The police detail was
 organized in two groups of five men each who pulled an 24-hour tour of duty.
 Shortly after 0300, two men wearing police uniforms and a third man
 wearing the uniform of an army lieutenant approached the group of chatting
 policemen.   "What's cooking, fellows?" they asked, making as if this was
 an inspection.   "Oh, nothing special," replied the policemen who were
 standing in front of the watchtower.  At that very moment, however, the
 three men who had just arrived, pulled out their revolvers and shouted:
 "Hands up, you damned swine!"  At the same time several men burst out of
 the darkness, some of them in civilian clothes and others wearing uniforms.
 They disarmed the five guards and took their weapons and tied them up.
 After having knocked out the outside guards, they knocked on the iron
 gate, although not particularly loudly, in order not to alarm the guards in
 the machine gun-equipped towers along the concrete wall.  The gate was opened
 and about 20 men sneaked inside.  They penetrated into the garden and from
 there fanned out over the entire house.   Immediately afterward, bursts of
 fire from submachineguns tore the stillness of the night.  But before the
 inhabitants of the neighboring mansions can get their bearings, all is quiet
 again.  The intruders disappeared in the dark streets and the last ones of
 them fled, taking the two cars in the garage of the mansion.

 Half an hour later, the police, alerted by the neighbors, arrives
 on the scene.  The policemen immediately begin an-investigation.  According
 to statements made by the guards, who had in the meantime been released,
 about 300 shots were fired but only Trotsky's grandson by the name of
 Esteban, who had arrived a few days ago from France, was hit in the left
 foot by a stray bullet.  Leon Trotsky, who was the target of the attack,
 was merely scared, as was his wife, Nathalia Sedova, the four American
 secretaries, the German national Otto Schuessler, a French couple, and
 three servants, that is, the female cook, the chambermaid, and the houseboys.
 In Trotsky's bedroom, the investigating police officers counted 73
 bullet holes.  The couple escaped this murderous crossfire through the doors
 and windows only because they immediately dove under the bed.  Little Esteban
 had likewise hidden under his bed when he heard the shots.  Although he was
 only 11 years old, he knew that someone was out to kill his grandfather at
 all costs.  About a dozen assassination attempts had failed in the past.
 Trotsky's children, two sons and two daughters, had already been murdered
 or driven to death in the past.  Of the grandchildren, only Esteban is still
 alive.
 But it was not only the closest relatives who died of an unnatural
 death; many of his friends and seven of his secretaries likewise died unnat-
 ural deaths:   in the USSR, in Spain, in Paris, in Switzerland, and in other
 countries.  The murderers, who had been sent out by Joseph Stalin, managed
 to find their victims even in hospitals and in lonely mountain villages.
 This is also the reason why Trotsky had his house in Coyoacan converted
 into a fortress.  All conceivable safety measures were included.  The main
 gate was strengthened with two crossbars; when the main gate is open, a
 bright light goes on above the entrance.  The windows are equipped with
 steel protective shields containing gun ports; a network of electric wires
 makes it impossible to climb over the walls.  The slightest contact with
 these wires triggers alarm bells which make an infernal noise.
 The riddle as to how the attackers were able to get into this heavily
 protected fortress without a fight and without setting off the alarm devices
 was soon solved:   the American Robert Sheldon Harte, who was on night watch
 duty, had disappeared.  It must have been he who opened the gate; according
 to the statements by the police officers, he fled with the attackers in the
 last of the two cars.  But Trotsky considers it impossible that he was in
 cahoots with these assassins; he believed that Sheldon Harte was kidnapped.
 A few days later, the corpse of the secretary was found in an iso-
 lated, uninhabited house.  Investigation revealed quite definitely that
 Sheldon Harte had not been held there as a prisoner and that he was murdered
 while asleep, after some time had passed.  The murderers then quickly hid
 his body under the clay floor of the room.  They probably thought that this
 traitor could also betray them.  Still, Leon Trotsky refused to believe that
 Harte had betrayed him.

 The trial of the attackers -- who were discovered with astonishing
 speed and who were made to talk with rather severe methods -- took place
 early in July.  But it was only the second team that sat on the bench; the
 foreign agents behind them, undoubtedly men working for the Soviet secret
 police, escaped.   The international public reacted to the trial with moder-
 ate interest.                              Even in Mexico the war in Europe absorbs the attention of the
 people more than the dark machinations of Stalin's secret police -- a fact
 which the plotters of this assassination attempt certainly figured on.
 About 2 weeks before the assassination attempt on Trotsky, the German
 army had launched its offensive in France.   The Maginot Line, which was con-
 sidered unbeatable, was broken, Paris was occupied, France was forced to
 ask for an armistice, and the British army was driven off the continent.
 But the Soviet Union had also been active.   After the occupation of Eastern
 Poland in September 1939, the Red Army occupied the hitherto independent
 countries of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in the middle of June.
 Trotsky is in agreement with the way the trial is being conducted
 there.  Unmistakably he declares:   "In no other country of the world, neither
 in France nor in Switzerland nor in Spain, has a crime of the GPU [Soviet
 Secret Police] ever been investigated and prosecuted with such care as this
 particular attempt on my life in Mexico!"  But he also knows that the mur-
 derers will not give up just because they failed this time.  He told a
 higher police officer the following:  "Destiny has given me another exten-
 sion but it won't be long."  As he awakens in the morning he usually tells
 his wife:  "Well, they didn't kill us last night.  We have a little reprieve."
 Who is this man who has so far escaped more than a dozen assassination
 attempts, whose four children have been murdered or were allowed to die because
 medical aid was refused them, whose house has been set on fire several times
 in order to smoke him and his followers out like rats and whom communists
 throughout the world have branded as a "traitor to socialism," as "servant
 of the capitalists," as "agent of fascism," and most recently also as "agent
 of American imperialism?"
 Leon Davidovich Bronstein, called Trotsky, was born in Yanovka,
 Kherson Province      (Ukraine) on 26 October 1879 (7 November according to
 the Gregorian calendar).  He was the fifth of eight children, four of whom
 died young.  His father, David Bronstein, was a prosperous farmer who had
 bought 400 Desyatinas of fertile farmland from a noble estate owner who had
 come upon hard times; through hard work, he succeeded in increasing his
 holdings.  He built new workshops, new stables for the animals, and a big
 mill.  After the revolution, which his son helped win, he lost everything.
 Embittered and at the same time proud of his son, he died in 1922 as manager
 of a government-owned mill.
 When Leon Davidovich was born, Russia was under the rule of Tsar
 Alexander II, who in 1861 had freed the serfs.  The progressive-liberal
 forces therefore had great hopes in him.  But he was murdered on 1 March 1881

 before he was able to crown his reform work through a constitution.   His son,
 Alexander III, was completely under the influence of Pobedonostsev, the
 chief procurator of the Holy Synod, a bigoted reactionary who would have
 loved to reintroduce serfdom.
 The old Bronstein who -- like millions of Russian peasants -- could
 neither read nor write, sent  his son to a Jewish school where he was taught
 in the Yiddish language which he was not familiar with.  The language spoken
 at home was Ukrainian.  Attendence at this Jewish school, however, was very
 important for little Bronstein:   this is the place where he also learned
 Russian.
 Back in Yanovka, he continues his education by himself.  At the age
 of 6, he was able to make out bills for his father and he could even keep
 books.   The parents were tremendously proud of their son.  They were sure
 that this child prodigy had to go to college!   The next place for him to go
 was therefore bound to be Odessa, a big port of the Black Sea, the Russian
 Marseille, and the "most notorious police city of this police state."
 But the 7-year old boy was not admitted to a government school;
 instead he went to the "Saint Paul technical high school," founded by the
 German Lutheran community.   Instruction was given in the Russian language
 and the students and teachers were of German, Swiss, Russian, Polish,
 Rumanian, and Greek origin -- a true cross section of the jumble of nation-
 alities in this part of Russia.  The student body also included a large num-
 ber of religious denominations: in addition to students from Lutheran,
 Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Jewish, and Calvinist families, the school
 was even attended by children from various sects.
 During the very first year, young Bronstein was the first in his class;
 he learned German and French as well as Italian and Greek and Latin.  He did
 not engage in any kind of political activity.  There were no revolutionary
 circles in the liberal "Saint Paul's school"; these revolutionary circles
 sprang un only in the government schools which were run like military barracks.
 At the age of 17 he went to Nikolayev to attend the university there;
 this is where he came into contact with "Marxist" for the first time.  But
 at first he only thought that they were ridiculous.   In a toast at a new
 year's celebration in 1896 he said:   "Curse all Marxists who bring so much
 harshness and desolation into life."  His first political article was likewise
 against Marxism.
 But this did not last long.  When he graduated with the rating of
 "excellent" in 1897, he was already an enthusiastic supporter of the theories
 of Karl Marx which came from London and Germany.  Old Bronstein ranted and
 raved and demanded that his son drop all of these revolutionary theories.
 But Leon Davidovich did not give in.    He instead dropped his father's allow-
 ance and earned his living by private tutoring.

 At the age of 19 he organized a revolutionary group in Nikolayev
 called the "South Russian Workers Federation"; this was almost like a party
 although it did have local limitations.  When the situation got too hot for
 him there; he decided to return to Yanovka in 1898.  On the way there he
 was arrested by the police.  He was under investigative arrest for almost
 2 years; at the end of 1899 he was exiled to Siberia for 4 years without a
 trial.
 While in prison, he married Alexandra Sokolovskaya who had likewise
 been condemned to exile.   In his book My Life, lie devoted no more than 3
 lines to this event:   "Our common work created close bonds between us.   In
 order not to be settled separately, we had ourselves married in the Moscow
 prison, while underway to our exile."  This marriage produce two daughters.
 Before 4 years had passed, Trotsky left his family.
 The fame of the young revolutionary, who had organized his own group
 at the age of 19 and who maintained contact with his likewise exiled comrades
 from the place of his exile in Verkholensk, had spread to Central Russia.
 The articles, which he published under the pseudonym of "Antid Oto" in the
 Eastern Review, published in Irkutsk, likewise attracted attention.  He was
 urged to return.  Equipped with a forged passport, in which he had entered
 the name of one of his prison guards, he reached Irkutsk.  This quite acci-
 dentally selected "passport name" of Trotsky was to make world history.
 In Irkutsk he took the train to Samara, today called Kuibyshev,
 headquarters of the illegally published newspaper Iskra (The Spark) and
 rallying point of the Marxist-oriented revolutionaries who were winning more
 and more supporters, in contrast to the terrorist groups which were so active
 in the past.   From there he was sent to Kharkov, Poltava, and Kiev, in order
 to supervise the local underground groups of the Social Democratic Party.
 Back in Samara, he was invited to come to London which was the Western
 European headquarters of Iskra.  This "invitation" -- which in effect was a
 command -- had been signed by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.
 Wherever Trotsky turned up, he quickly attracted attention; his out-
 standing intellectual capacity quickly earned praise; the analytical keenness
 of his articles and his brilliant talent as a speaker likewise earned him
 fame.   After a few weeks he also played an important role in London.  At
 the 2nd Congress in 1903, which had begun in Brussels and which was then
 moved to London, everyone noted his dash and his passion.  Lenin thought
 that he had "unusual characteristics" and suggested that Trotsky be appointed
 to the editorial staff of the foreign edition of Iskra.  Later on he was
 sent to France, Switzerland, and Belgium.  On his travels he met not only
 the most important European socialists but also Nathalia Sedova, who was
 at the time studying art history in Paris.  Without any formalities at city
 hall, she became his mate and from then on shared all triumphs and all suf-
 fering with him.
 Trotsky and the 10 years older Lenin (who from time to time helped and

 i
 promoted him) had by no means infrequent clashes, mostly because of secondary
 issues; this is a fact which Stalin 20 years later made wide use of in order
 to accuse Trotsky of an "anti-Leninist" -- in other words, "anti-revolution-
 ary" -- attitude.  This of course was intentional slander.   It has turned
 out, by the way, that it was Trotsky who was right in many of these issues,
 and not Lenin.   It is not correct to say that these two men were enemies;
 instead, one might compare them to the two poles of a magnet who together
 produced a field of force.  Today we know that it was not only Trotsky who
 was heavily influenced by Lenin (as a result of which numerous Russians
 living in exile called Lenin's "club"); we also know that Lenin took over
 many things contained in Trotsky's theories, such as for instance, the idea
 of the "permanent revolution."  Of course, the father of this thesis was not
 Trotsky; it has been proved that it was his sometime patron, the Russian
 Emigrant Alexander Helphand who later on became known throughout the world
 under the name of Parvus.  By "permanent revolution" he meant a revolution
 which would not be completed until all countries of the world had become
 communist  -- and Trotsky of course took over this meaning.
 The influence which Helphand exerted on many Russian and Western
 European socialists was to some extent based on the fact that he had pre-
 dicted, as early as 1895, the Russian-Japanese war which did not break out
 until 10 years later and that he also predicted the Russian revolution which
 would come after that war as a "prelude to the world revolution."  This proph-
 ecy is of course the exact opposite of the predictions of Marx; it was a
 rather eerie prophecy and constituted a considerable contribution to the
 consolidation of the reputation of "the dialectical concept of history."
 When trouble broke out in St. Petersburg in January 1905, Trotsky
 left his safe position with the by then very prosperous Parvus-Helphand,
 who had given him an apartment and a job in Munich, and went to Russia --
 a dangerous undertaking because exiles who had escaped were punished with
 extreme severity after they had been arrested again.  Almost all of the
 other leading revolutionaries therefore continued to live abroad and waited
 in order to find out how the situation would develop.
 But Trotsky courageously plunged into the whirlpool of events.  He
 became the recognized leader of the heavily communist-colored revolution
 of 1905 which heavily shook tsarist Russia.   But it was not only the many
 strikes that rattled the political structure of the autocratically governed
 country; a much more serious fact was that the fleet mutinied.   It was
 extremely difficult to restore the old order.
 Early in December 1905 Trotsky was arrested and 23 months later he
 was sentenced to lifelong exile in a Godforsaken village in the Polar region
 at the mouth of the Ob River.  On the way there he managed to escape.  With
 extraordinary energy and astonishing physical toughness, he fought his way
 through the Taiga [tundra] and reached Petersburg from where he returned to
 London after staying a few days in Helsinki.  He arrived in time to partici-
 pate in the 5th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Worker Party.

 For the first time he developed his -- that is to say Parvus's --
 theory of the "permanent revolution" in public.  Lenin and other left-wing
 socialists, including Rosa Luxemburg, supported him and hailed him not only
 as a great revolutionary, whose courageous appearance in St. Petersburg and
 later during the trial had aroused worldwide attention, but also as an impor-
 tant theoretician.  After that he went to Berlin where his mate Nathalia
 Sedova was waiting for him with his son Leon who had been born in 1906.
 Trotsky was a celebrated figure also in Germany.  Parvus introduced
 him to the leaders of German social democracy, such as Karl Kautsky, old
 Bebel, Georg Ledebour, Franz Mehring, and Hugo Hase.  These were interna-
 tionally known names because the German Social Democratic Party was the
 strongest and best organized in the world.  But the years from 1907 until
 191+ basically were only training years for Trotsky.  He was not to find
 his historical mission in life until after the outbreak of World War I --
 without of course having been aware of this at the time.
 Leon Trotsky had never been interested in military matters; he did
 not come into contact with problems of strategy and tactics until he was a
 war correspondent during the two Balkan wars in 1911 and 1912.  In his arti-
 cles, he not only relentlessly exposed the atrocities committed by both
 sides and which reminded him "of the methods of the 30 Years' War"; he also
 became increasingly interested in military tactics and operations.   It was
 not enough for him to describe the effect of certain measures or moves; he
 also wanted to find out what their causes and their interconnections were.
 At the outbreak of World War I he happened to be in Vienna.  After a
 short stopover in Switzerland, he went to Paris.  As during the two Balkan
 wars, he once again worked as correspondent for a number of newspapers,
 changing his cover name from one place to the next.  His 1915 and 1916 arti-
 cles, in which he discussed the development of the war into a position war,
 attracted wide attention.   It is primarily due to the subsequent systematic
 slander of Trotsky by Stalin that these journalistically brilliant and highly
 significant essays are just about unknown today.
 During his stay in Paris, Trotsky was also a frequent visitor to the
 National Library.  There he studied primarily military magazines and textbooks,
 probably without ever guessing how important the knowledge he gained there
 would be to him later:   less than 5 years later, Leon Trotsky commanded a
 victorious army of more than a million men in numerous battles.
 In September 1916, the French government deported this undesirable
 emigre to Spain.  On 20 December, he and Nathalia Sedova and their two sons,
 Leon and Sergey, boarded a Spanish steamer in Barcelona which was to take
 them to New York.  As the ship passed the Straits of Gibraltar, Trotsky
 wrote the following to a friend:   "This is the last time I am looking at
 that old rascal Europe."
 Upon his arrival in New York he was enthusiastically welcomed by

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061AO00300040003-3
 numerous Russian socialists who had found refuge there.  Could they guess
 that they were hailing one of the great leaders of the coming revolution?
 Barely 2 months later there were red flags flying from many palaces of the
 nobility in the Russian capital of Petrograd (St. Petersburg).
 In New York, Trotsky went from meeting to meeting and predicted the
 victory of socialism although during the first weeks it looked as if the
 bourgeoisie would keen control of the situation and the tsar was forced to
 abdicate only in order to step up the war effort.  But Trotsky was sure of
 his cause.  Triumphantly he declared:   "The tremendous avalanche of the
 revolution is in full swing and no'human force can ever stop it!"  Like Lenin,
 he demanded not just the overthrow of the old system but also the termination
 of the war.
 Boarding a Norwegian vessel, he left New York on 27 March 1917.
 During a stopover in Canada, the British picked him up.  Under the pressure
 of numerous protests he was released after 3 weeks and was allowed to con-
 tinue his trin.  On 17 May, one month after Lenin, he reached Petrograd.
 A vast throng welcomed him.  The workers lifted the hero of the revolution
 of 1905 to their shoulders and carried him through the streets in triumph.
 A few hours after his arrival he hurried to the Smolny Institute,
 the headquarters of the Petrograd Soviets.  Although he was admitted only as
 a member with an advisory vote,  Trotsky was satisfied.  No one else was as
 powerful a speaker; it was not his yes or no vote slip that would decide the
 issue; it was his words that would decide the issue.  After a short time,
 he was the spokesman of the revolution.   It was particularly the sailors on
 the warships and at the Kronstadt naval base who stuck with him through thick
 and thin -- a success which was to bring about the decision on 7 November
 1917.
 In July, Lenin and his supporters had failed to seize power; Trotsky
 was arrested at that time with many others but he was soon released.  At
 the end of September the Petrograd Soviet elected Leon Trotsky -- now an
 official member of the Bolsheviks as its chairman.  In the meantime the
 economic crisis had reached unexpected proportions.  The supply of foodstuffs
 to the cities had broken down completely; this was due partly to the disas-
 trous transportation situation and partly to the situation on the farms as
 such.
 The government had not been prepared to launch a farm reform or even
 to promise it; this is why the landless farmers took matters into their
 own hands.  The consequence of this arbitrary action was bound to be a drop
 in the farm output figures.  Of course, the cities suffered the most as a
 result of this.   In addition, there was a manpower shortage.  More than
 5 million farmers were in the army at the front, behind the lines, or in
 prisoner of war camps in Germany and Austria-Hungary.  This was one of the
 reasons why the demand of the Bolsheviks for an immediate peace treaty
 always found tremendous approval in the villages.

 Parallel to this agitation among the workers and farmers, prepara-
 tions were underway for a new Bolshevik uprising.  Trotsky thought that the
 classical forms of revolution in the past were outdated.  Storming such
 places as the Bastille, battles at the barricades, and emotional mass
 uprisings had become senseless.  The modern state had to be captured through
 an organized coup d'etat.   In developing this new revolutionary strategy,
 Trotsky was for the first time able to make practical use of the military
 science studies he has pursued in Paris.
 He made his plans almost like a general staff officer.  By means
 of propaganda, the position was softened up for the assault so that, after
 sufficient preparation, smaller, well-equipped assault squads were able to
 paralyze the nerve centers of the government.   If you first capture the
 ministries, the electric power plants, and the telephone exchanges, the
 opposition is doomed to failure and your own victory is assured.
 When the German army command went on the offensive again, Petrograd
 was threatened for a time.  The government ordered the military units to
 march and prepared to move to Moscow.  Trotsky sounded the alarm in the
 Soviet.  The soldiers, whom he had propagandized in the meantime, refused
 to leave Petrograd.  A military revolutionary committee distributed 5,000
 rifles to the workers, allegedly only for the "defense of the capital."
 But when the German troops discontinued their advance on Petrograd, it
 was said that these weapons were to be used "in the defense of the gains
 of the revolution."  But everyone in Petrograd knew that the Bolsheviks
 were now trying to overthrow the government.
 Democratic Prime Minister Kerensky was determined to make a fight of
 it.  On 6 November he outlawed the Bolshevik newspaper Pravda (Truth) which
 had been published under the name Rabotchiy Put (Worker Road) ever since
 the July coup d'etat.   In response to this, Trotsky had the printing
 plants of the bourgeois newspapers occupied and issued a new edition of
 Pravda whose front page carried the famous Order No 1:
 "The enemies of the people have gone on the offensive during the
 night.  They are planning a treacherous attack against the Petrograd Soviet
 of worker and soldier delegates.
 "All regimental, company, and crew committees, along with the com-
 missars of the Soviets and all of the revolutionary organizations must be
 permanently in session and must concentrate all news about the plans and
 actions of the plotters in their hands.
 "No soldier may leave his unit without approval from the committee.
 "The cause of the people is in firm hands.  The conspirators will be
 wiped out.

 "No hesitations, no doubts!  Steadfastness, constancy, perseverance,
 and determination are needed.  Long live the revolution."
 This was the signal for general action.  During the night of 7 Novem-
 ber (25 October according to the old Russian calendar), the coup d'etat was
 carried out on the basis of plans worked out by Trotsky.  Tough assault
 squads occupied the railroad stations, the electric power plants, the mili-
 tary rations warehouses, the water reservoirs, the bridges leading from the
 suburbs to the downtown section, the telephone exchange, the State Bank,
 and numerous other buildings.  Around 1000 all access streets to the Winter
 Palace were blocked.  The ministers were cut off from the rest of the world
 and this was in fact the victory of the Bolshevik revolution.
 Prime Minister Kerensky had left the capital early on 7 November in
 a car made available to him by the American embassy in order to get help
 from the outside.  His ministers were waiting in the Winter Palace for him
 to return.  Around noon, revolutionary soldiers, with fixed bayonets,
 scattered the deputies of the "Provisional Council of the Russian Republic."
 About an hour and a half later, Trotsky opened a session of the Petrograd
 Soviet and declared in the name of the "military revolutionary committee"
 that the provisional government was no longer in existence.
 Among the deafening cheers of the delegates he added:   "A few minis-
 ters have been arrested.  The others will be arrested in the next few days
 or hours.  The revolutionary garrison, which is at the disposal of the mili-
 tary revolutionary committee, has already dissolved the meeting of the pre-
 liminary parliament.  We were told that the uprising of the garrison would
 be drowned in rivers of blood.  We do not know of a single victim or casualty.
 I know of no other example in history in which a revolution has been accomp-
 lished so completely without bloodshed."
 This was indeed true.  Never before had there been an overthrow of
 this kind which did not claim any victims and the Russian-French newspaperman
 Claude Anet stated with astonishment that the backward, illiterate Russians
 had made a revolution entirely different from any of the others reported
 in the history books.  But there was no denying that the Bolshevik power
 seizure had taken place like an offensive based on plans made by the general
 staff.  No one had heard any shooting anywhere; no where was there any
 insubordination of revolutionary workers and soldiers.  The streets were
 empty and there was not even any looting.
 Lenin -- who on the preceding evening, still in disguise, had come
 out of hiding to go to the headquarters of the revolutionary committee at
 the Smolny -- thought that this silence was rather ghostly.  He, too, was
 still thinking of the classical image of the old revolution.  Not until
 reports kept coming in from the individual assault squads did he realize
 that the revolution had succeeded.  On the evening of this highly eventful
 7 November, the spiritual leader of this revolution and Trotsky, who had
 fainted due to exhaustion, slept on the floor in a room next to the great
 hall of the Smolny.

 The Winter Palace, headquarters of the government, had still not
 been taken.  Now Trotsky's friendship with the sailors paid off .  The
 Cruiser "Aurora" put to sea from Kronstadt and headed for Petrograd where
 it opened fire.   But it only fired blank ammunition.  The Winter Palace
 did not fall as a result of the attack by the sailors; it was stormed and
 carried by assault in the old style.  The metropolis of an empire of 150
 million inhabitants, in which 5 million soldiers and policemen were under
 arms, had capitulated without a fight to 10 thousand and perhaps 15 thousand
 largely illiterate peasants and workers, led by a man who had never before
 had a chance to test his military talents.
 Lenin was the chairman of the new government of people's commissars.
 Trotsky was foreign minister.  But after only 3 days he had to go "to the
 front" -- right at the gates of Petrograd:  ousted Kerensky had succeeded
 in winning over a few regiments of Cossacks to his side.  But before the
 fight could break out, Trotsky had defeated them through the power of his
 speech.    The Cossacks surrendered after a brief skirmish.  Along with this
 victory message the capital received the news that Moscow and other big
 cities had likewise joined the revolution and new governments were also
 established in the rural areas.
 Trotsky himself was in charge of the peace negotiations with Germany
 and its allies, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey, at Brest-Litovsk.
 The imperial German government missed a big chance here.   Instead of con-
 cluding a reasonable peace with the Bolsheviks and thus setting an example,
 it imposed a very severe dictated peace.  The Soviet government in the end
 accepted the very harsh conditions in order to get a breathing spell.   In
 March 1918 Trotsky switched from the foreign ministry to the newly organized
 war commissariat.   It was now his job to set up reliable Red units in order
 to be able to fight the White Guard armies, which were springing up all
 over the country.
 What he had left in the way of military units did not look very
 promising, especially not when it came to winning a victory.  The old anti-
 military propaganda had now turned against the Bolsheviks.   In addition,
 foreign intervention armies penetrated into Russia from all sides.  The
 Japanese had landed at Vladivostok and the Czech prisoners of war had
 organized their own legion in Siberia which now rose against the Soviets.
 On their march to the West they ran into hardly any resistance at all.
 In addition, Petrograd and Moscow increasingly felt the activity of tsarist
 agents who were more and more recovering from the blow they had taken on
 7 November.
 On 22 April 1918, Trotsky submitted a plan to the executive committee
 of the Soviets according to which former tsarist officers were to be accepted
 into the Red Army,  now being founded.                         He prevailed over
 the opposition of extreme left-wing circles, although he was quite aware of
 the danger that many of these officers, who volunteered, did so only with
 the intention of attacking the Bolsheviks from the rear.

 Early in August Moscow heard that the Czechs had taken Kazan; Trotsky
 immediately jumped on his train and went to the front; for 2 and a half years
 he and his closest collaborators lived in this rolling headquarters which
 was his very own invention and which soon became a legend.  This armored
 train was pulled by two locomotives and carried automobiles, guns complete
 with shells, small arms, food and medication, a printing plant, a library,
 and a telegraph and radio station.  Trotsky could always be found wherever
 the danger was greatest.  But the tide turned when he stood in the very
 front line at Kazan.  The revolutionary soldiers were swept along by the
 enthusiasm of their leader and launched a counterattack.  And 6 weeks after
 the Czechs had captured Kazan, the Red Army recaptured this important city
 on the Volga.  Lenin immediately sent a telegram:
 "I enthusiastically hail the brilliant victory of the Red Army.  May
 this be a sign that it will crush all resistance by the exploiters and assure
 the victory of world socialism."
 This unexpected success changed the situation of the Bolsheviks over
 night.  The Czechs and the tsarist units marching with them understood that
 they were no longer dealing with a few bunches of rebels; they realized
 that they were now facing units led by strategic experts.  For the tsarist
 officers this was a tremendous surprise.  Who was this Trotsky who managed
 to take a beaten army which would flee in panic everytime it faced its
 enemies and who could imbue it with a new aggressive spirit and lead it to
 victory?
 After the collapse of the Central Powers in November 1918, new front
 lines developed.  Besides, Trotsky, who was against any kind of intriguing
 and plotting, had made himself an enemy within his own party, an enemy whose
 cunning no one realized in the beginning; that man was Joseph Stalin,
 supreme political commissar of the 10th Army which was at that time under
 the command of ex-Cavalry sergeant Voroshilov.  Upon request from Trotsky,
 Lenin called Stalin back to Moscow -- a humiliation which Stalin never forgot.
 The campaign of slander against the founder and organizer of the Red Army
 began during those days:  Stalin charged the war commissar with being a
 "friend of tsarist generals."
 When some of the old officers, who had been accepted into the new
 army, were exposed as traitors, Stalin struck his first blow.  But Trotsky
 was saved again, thanks to the foolishness of such White Guard generals
 as Kolchak, Denikin, Yudenich, and Krasnov, each of whom, on his own, and
 without coordination, now marched on Moscow.  This required a new campaign
 in the field and the organizer of the Red Army was an indispensable man.
 In his train, he rode from one front to the other, from the Volga where he
 decisively defeated Kolchak, to the Southern front where he directed the
 fighting against Denikin, whom he defeated just as decisively as Yudenich
 who had advanced against Petrograd in the North.  On his 40th birthday, the
 2nd anniversary of the Bolshevik power seizure, Trotsky was able to report
 the victory of the Red Army in Moscow.

 About 5 months ago in March 1920, the Poles and the Ukrainian dicta-
 tor Petlyura, who had been driven out only the year before, penetrated into
 Soviet Russia.  They captured Kiev.  This new war quickly took on the charac-
 ter of a nationalistic and perhaps even religious war.  Poland had been
 Russia's "arch-enemy" for many centuries; in addition, the inhabitants of
 this state, which had been revived in 1918, were Roman Catholic, in contrast
 to the Greek Orthodox Russians.  Many former tsarist officers, who had refused
 to help in the past, now volunteered for the Red Army in order to defend the
 "legitimate church" against the "Roman church."
 Once again Trotsky went to the front.  Wherever possible, he stopped
 any kind of nationalistic or anti-Catholic propaganda in the army.   In one
 of his orders of the day he wrote this:   "Let every Red Army man, who
 raises his knife against a prisoner of war, against unarmed men, sick men,
 or wounded soldiers, have his hand chopped off."  His presence always had
 an electrifying effect.  A counterattack was launched in June and a few weeks
 later the Red Army, now grown to half a million, was at the gates of Warsaw.
 The fall of the Polish capital seemed to be a matter of days.
 But then occurred the much debated "miracle on the Vistula," the
 counterpart to the "miracle on the Marne" in September 1914, when the French
 stopped the Germans.  General Tukhachevskiy, the supreme commander of the
 Red Army appointed by Trotsky, had ordered the Red Army units operating in
 the South under the command of Budenny to screen the left wing of the advance
 on the Polish capital.  But the political commissar of this army group,
 Joseph Stalin, who was jealous of Tukhachevskiy and his rapid climb to the
 rank of general at the age of 26, wanted to gather his own laurels.   Instead
 of linking up with the Red Army units before Warsaw, he caused Budenny to
 move against Lemberg.  His units were to move into that city at the same
 time as Tukhachevskiy moved into the Polish capital.
 Polish Marshal Pilsudski, advised by General Weygand who had hurried
 in from France, pushed into this gap and rolled up the flank of the army
 that was pushing toward Warsaw.  This meant that Poland, as good as defeated
 on one day, emerged victorious from this war.  The Soviet Union was forced
 to conclude a peace treaty whose conditions were dictated by Warsaw.  Trotsky
 and Tukhachevskiy, in verbal and written form, accused the political commis-
 sar of the 10th Army of having caused this disastrous defeat.
 This fiasco explains a whole series of actions taken by Stalin.  He
 not only had Tukhachevskiy and Trotsky and all of their supporters killed
 but he also transformed his hatred to the entire Polish nation.   It was
 most probable that he gave the order to murder the 14,500 Polish officers
 in 1940 who had been captured by the Soviets.  About 4,200 corpses were
 found in the forest of Katyn:   these were the inmates of the camp at
 Kozielsk.  The inmates of the camp at Starobielsk, almost 4,000 men, were
 likewise murdered.  But their graves have not been discovered to this very
 day.  The 6,567 inmates of the Ostashkov camp were loaded on two sailboats
 at Archangel and these boats were sunk in the White Sea -- allegedly during
 artillery firing practice.

 Things calmed down to some extent after the Polish-Russian war.
 But there were still individual uprisings by generals loyal to the tsar;
 still, the Red Army always won.  This result, which made the Bolsheviks
 very happy, of course was offset by the terrible casualties of the 4-year
 civil war.  The Soviets had seized power in November 1917 almost without
 bloodshed; but after that, during the battles of the following years, more
 than 3 million people died.  The Russian famine of 1921-1922 also claimed
 about 5 million victims.   It was a consequence of the economic break up
 caused by war, revolution, and civil war and it was also due to natural
 disasters.
 Trotsky was most bitterly disappointed by the Kronstadt mutiny.
 The sailors at that naval base and fortress revolted and demanded a human-
 ization of conditions.  Their demands included the following:  more personal
 freedom, in other words, a let-up in the dictatorship, and fraternization
 of the people.    Among the rebels were many of the men who had followed
 Trotsky and who in 1917 had made a decisive contribution to the victory of
 the Bolsheviks when their ship shelled the Winter Palace.  But the party
 ordered that ruthless measures be taken against the sailors.  On 3 April
 1921 Trotsky took the victory parade with a heavy heart:  of all of the
 military operations which he had directed since 1917, the one against
 Kronstadt was the bloodiest.
 At the end of 1923 he became seriously ill and had to go on conva-
 lescent leave in the South of the Soviet Union.  Shortly thereafter Lenin
 died on 21 January 1924.   The secretary general of the party, Joseph Stalin,
 knew how to keep the founder of the Red Army from the funeral:  he cabled
 his mortal enemy Trotsky, who was in Tiflis at the time, the wrong date
 for the funeral.  Later on, Trotsky maintained that Stalin was afraid:
 "He (Stalin) was afraid that I would ask the doctors about the possi-
 bility of [Lenin's] poisoning and that I would ask for a special autopsy."
 The spectators did note that Leon Davidovich Trotsky was not among
 the leading comrades who carried Lenin's coffin; but they did not give it
 much thought.  Still, the question as to whether and in what sequence a
 leader was to participate in official celebrations took on profound signifi-
 cance on that day.
 Stalin advanced step by step.  Systematically he manned all positions
 with comrades loyal to him and thus isolated Trotsky in the party and in the
 CC.  Then he was ready to strike.  At the 15th Congress on 2 September 1927
 he proposed a resolution according to which all men who in any way propagated
 opposition views were to be thrown out of the party.  Only a man who pros-
 trated himself and who signs a statement of repentence could in the future
 expect any kind of mercy.
 The resolution was adopted and this sealed the fate  of Trotsky.  He
 had already been forced to move his office out of the Kremlin; now the CC

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040003-3
 threw him out of the party and on 16 January 1928 Stalin ordered the depor-
 tation of his arch enemy, who was intellectually so superior to him, and
 of his supporters to Siberia.  For Trotsky he had selected the city of
 Alma Ata, the Kazakh capital, 4,000 km from Moscow.  When Trotsky refused
 to go there, secret police dragged him and his family by force so that
 they would catch the regular train to Tashkent.  At the terminal, there
 was a bus waiting for the exiles which took them to Alma Ata.
 His supporters, who had been exiled to isolated little villages in
 Siberia, soon established contact with each other.   But Trotsky's hope of
 building up an underground organization did not materialize.  He realized
 that the Soviet GPU was considerably better organized than the old Okhrana,
 the secret police of the tsars.
 With his arrival in Alma Ata, there began a bitter path of suffering
 for Trotsky, his wife, and his oldest son, Leon Sedov, such as there are
 very few in history.  On 9 June 1928 he received a telegram in which a friend
 informed him of the death of his eldest daughter Nina.  She might perhaps
 have been saved if her illness had been properly treated.  But the pharmacy
 in the Kremlin refused to give her the necessary medication.
 At the end of the year Stalin demanded that Trotsky be expelled from
 the territory of the Soviet Union.  The members of the political bureau, who
 had been hand-picked and promoted by Stalin, agreed -- with one exception.
 The foreign commissariat was ordered to find a land that would be ready to
 give an  entry visa to the founder of the Red Army.  About 5 days later
 Trotsky was told that he would be deported to Constantinople.  He refused to
 leave the Soviet Union and demanded to see his son Sergey and the latter's
 wife and children.
 The family was then forcibly transported to Odessa where it was put
 on board a Russian freighter on 10 February.  But Sergey and his wife, who
 had been allowed to go to the big port on the Black Sea, volunteered to
 remain behind in the USSR.  This was the last time they saw each other.
 The ship entered the Bosporus 2 days later.  Trotsky handed a statement to
 the Turkish police officer who came on board the ship.
 "To Kemal Pasha, President of the Turkish Republic.  Dear Sir, at
 the gates of Constantinople I have the honor to inform you that I am crossing
 this border only in obedience to brute force.  I ask you, Mr. President, to
 accept any such sentiments as I might have under these conditions."
 The Russian consul, who likewise had come on board, gave Trotsky
 1,500 dollars, so to say as "initial capital" for the establishment of a
 new life.  Except for his files, this was all he had.  He rented a house on
 the Island of Prinkipo.  He never suffered any financial difficulties.  He
 wrote articles and essays and he worked on a biography as well as on a history
 of the Russian revolution.  All of these works were translated into many lan-
 guages and he earned considerable royalties with which he was able to publish

 his Bulletin of the Opposition which, after some time, became a self-
 supporting operation.
 Very soon, however, he came to feel Stalin's hatred once again.  A
 fire suddenly broke out in his home.  The fire destroyed some of his files
 for whose preservation Trotsky has taken more precautions than for his own.
 He was barely able to save himself and his family and despite the great
 danger kept carrying files and documents out of the burning house.   From
 that moment on he tried to flee to another country in which he might feel
 safer.  But wherever he asked for refuge he was refused.   Finally France
 agreed to accept him.
 Before he left Turkey, he was informed that his second daughter
 Zinaida had died in Berlin on 5 January 1933 and he received a letter from
 the Soviet Union that both of his sons-in-law had been deported.  Both of
 them perished miserably in Siberia.  But their four children disappeared like-
 wise.                             Stalin did not overlook any of the Trotsky clan, provided the particu-
 lar member was in his power.
 Trotsky left Prinkipo in the summer of 1933.  For about 2 years he
 lived under various names in France; then he had to go to Norway whose
 socialist government in the meantime had given him permission to stay there.
 Shortly before his move in 1935 he learned that his youngest son Sergey and
 the latter's wife, who had remained behind in the Soviet Union, had been
 arrested.   He never found out where they and their children died.
 After the assassination of the Petrograd party secretary Kirov on
 1 December 1934, numerous old Bolsheviks were arrested in Moscow because
 Stalin accused them of "complicity."  He said that Trotsky had ordered this
 assassination.   But the fact is that this crime -- as Khrushchev disclosed
 to the 20th Congress -- was carried out upon Stalin's orders or at least
 with his approval.  The rather transparent accusation that Trotsky had
 planned Stalin's assassination likewise was a mere invention intended to
 put pressure on the Norwegian government.  Minister of Justice Trygve Lie,
 later on the first secretary general of the UN, urged Trotsky to refrain
 from any kind of "current political activity."  He said:   "I ask your per-
 mission in restricting your residence permit and I further ask you to under-
 stand that your outgoing and incoming mail can only be handled through offi-
 cial channels."
 "If it is your intention to arrest me," replied Trotsky, "then you
 cannot ask that I authorize you to do this likewise."  Trygve Lie tried for
 a compromise:   "After all, there is a condition between arrest and complete
 freedom."  Trotsky would agree to  nothing:   "In that case I would prefer
 arrest."
 He did not have to wait long.  At the end of September 1936 he was
 interned in a house carefully guarded by 15 policemen.

 This measure aroused great attention throughout the world but none
 of the critics was prepared to go his own government in order to offer Trotsky
 refuge in some other country.  Besides, it is almost certain that internment
 at that time just about saved his life because Stalin's assassins at that
 time were busy killing many friends of Trotsky.   Why would they omit him?
 On the other hand, this isolation had a very profound effect, not
 at  all  apparent  to Trotsky:   it cut him offfrom the rest of the world
 and a politician     not in the midst of things is of necessity turned into
 a sectarian.
 The man who replaced the classical "barricade revolution" with a
 general-staff-style coup d'etat suddenly was inclined to rather astonishingly
 mistaken analyses of the international situation and the situation in the
 Soviet Union.  As we read the magazine Unser Wort -- Halbmonatszeitung der
 Internationalen Kommunisten Deutschlands (Our Word -- Semimonthly of the
 International Communist of Germany) which is published in the German language
 by the Trotskyites in Paris today, a magazine which very often published
 articles by Trotsky, we cannot help but wonder to what great extent he and
 his followers failed to understand what was going on.
 The Trotskyites failed to see that not only the economic and socio-
 logical driving forces, which in the past had led to the unleashing of a
 revolution, had changed fundamentally; they also failed to see that the
 technique of a (successful) revolution had changed -- this partly due to
 Trotsky's work.   But just as the "cabinet wars" of the 18th and 19th centu-
 ries, which were anything but "class struggles" as Marx asserted, had been
 replaced by the total or"popular" war of the 20th century, so did the world
 war of 1914-1918 prove that the workers in almost all countries -- whether
 they were right or wrong is completely unimportant here -- believed that
 they had to defend something:   their homeland.
 We must clearly understand this:   in 1914-1918 the workers defended
 their "capitalist" homeland and not some kind of socialist homeland.   In
 the meantime, the 8-hour day had become reality and the gradual integration
 of the socialist parties into the government after the world war had turned
 the "homeless apprentices" of old, the "proletarians," into citizens.   It
 seems that Trotsky did not realize that this had taken place and that he
 did not understand what it meant; he wrote and thought and analyzed the
 situation as he did before 1914 in his articles in the Russian emigre news-
 papers -- and along with him his followers.
 In the meantime, the first big "show trial" had been held in the
 Moscow House of Labor Unions; this trial was to be followed by another six
 "public trials" (and hundreds of others of which no one ever heard anything).
 All of the charges  which could be investigated abroad  turned out to have
 been false.   For instance, one of the accused maintained that he had met
 Trotsky in a hotel which actually had burned down 20 years before the alleged
 meeting.  Another said that he had been sent to Russia by the Gestapo [Nazi
 secret police] -- of course on orders from Trotsky -- in 1932.  But the
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040003-3
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040003-3
 Gestapo did not come into existence until the summer of 1933.  One accused
 by the name of Lifshits really took the cake during the second trial:  he
 accused himself of having organized no less than 10,380 attacks on railroad
 lines over a period of 5 years -- in other words, five attacks per day.
 Anyone and everyone would have defended himself against the charges
 of being behind these acts of sabotage.  But of Trotsky the government of
 the country that had given him refuge asked that he accept these insane
 statements in silence.  Of course, he was not prepared to do that.  He did
 not refuse, either; in his replies he also sharply attacked the Soviet
 Union and Stalin; these attacks culminated in the following classical
 statements:
 "Of the 12 apostles, only Judas proved to be a traitor.  But if he
 had come to power, he would have pictured the other 11 apostles as traitors
 and, with them, all of the other, lesser disciples, whose number Luke himself
 has given at 70."
 These attacks found more and more attention and the world public
 was soon convinced that not a single word was true in any of the charges
 made at the so-called "trials of the enemies of the people."  For the Nor-
 wegian government, these disclosures were just one more reason to watch
 Trotsky even more closely.  These intolerable conditions ended when the
 President of Mexico, General Lazaro Cardenas, said that he was prepared to
 offer refuge to the founder of the Red Army whom Stalin had stripped of
 Soviet citizenship.  A Norwegian tanker brought Trotsky and his wife to
 Tampico at the turn of the year 1936-1937.   From there he took a special
 train of the Mexican government to Mexico City where he first of all found
 shelter with the painter Diego Rivera.
 About 5 weeks after his arrival, Trotsky was informed that his oldest
 son Leon Sedov, the last of his four children, had suddenly died on 16 Febru-
 ary 1937 in a Paris hospital, under mysterious circumstances following a
 successful removal of his appendix.     For many days he and Nathalia Sedova
 shut themselves off in their room in the house in Coyoacan which they had
 just rented and would not allow anyone to see them.  When Trotsky once
 again showed himself to his collaborators, his eyes were red and his beard
 was dissheveled.  He knew now that he was "living on borrowed time" and that
 Stalin would try harder than ever before to have him assassinated.
 Shortly thereafter his friends told him that.a number of unknown
 persons had been spotted in the vicinity of his house in Coyoacan for several
 days.   But his collaborators and the secretaries were likewise watched, as
 it turned out pretty soon.  Moscow had probably learned that the American
 publishing house of Harper was planning to publish a biography of Stalin,
 written by Trotsky; the publication of this biography was to be prevented at
 all costs.

 kind of fortress.  The iron grills were replaced with a thick concrete wall
 which had only one entrance.   Inside there was a second wall which surrounded
 the garden from which the house itself could be reached.  The first room
 was used as library and office; this was the place where the bodyguards
 stayed and checked every visitor.  The big dining room was then reached
 through a bullet-proof door and only from there could one reach Trotsky's
 personal study which was provided with numerous bookshelves, a big desk,
 and a phone.   In the adjoining rooms, he lived with his wife, while the
 collaborators were billetted in another building which for some incompre-
 hensible reason had only one exit.  Despite these security measures, the
 hired assassins managed to penetrate into this fortress without a fight on
 24 May 1940.   It is just about a miracle that Trotsky, his wife Nathalia
 Sedova and his grandson Esteban Volkov, who had just arrived from Paris,
 survived this attack.  There is no doubt as to who sent these assassins
 and Trotsky was quite outspoken about this.   In a letter to the attorney
 general and to the Mexican foreign minister he makes himself quite clear:
 "Over the past several years, Stalin had hundreds of my real or pre-
 sumed friends executed or shot.  Then he caused the murder of my entire family,
 with the exception of myself, my wife, and my grandson.   In Switzerland he had
 his agents murder a fellow by the name of Ignaz Reiss, one of the GPU chiefs,
 when the latter publicly accepted my ideas.  These facts were established
 without doubt by the French police and by the Swiss courts.  The same agents
 who murdered Ignaz Reiss also pursued my son in Paris.  Furthermore, on the
 evening of 7 November 1936, GPU agents broke into the scientific institute
 in Paris and stole some of my files.  Two of my former secretaries, Erwin
 Wolff and Rudolph Klement, were murdered by GPU agents; the former was killed
 in Spain and the latter in Paris.  The real objective of all of the show
 trials in Moscow in 1936 and 1937 was to get me handed over to the Soviet
 Union and into the hands of the GPU.
 "This list of crimes and similar excesses could be supplemented with
 many other examples.  All of them were aimed at my physical destruction.
 But Stalin is behind all of this.  His weapon is the Soviet secret police
 which has its agents in every country, in other words, the CPU."
 In the rest of this letter, Trotsky also mentions his suspicion that
 the German Gestapo might make common cause with the Soviet secret police
 which in July 1934 was renamed from GPU into NKVD.  This is not as crazy
 as it sounds.   In August 1939 Stalin had signed a pact with Hitler but it
 is quite obvious that there must have been a secret treaty in addition;
 the development of events and the way these two countries work together
 seem to prove this.  After all, did not the publicly announced treaty pro-
 vide for cooperation between the two secret police organizations?  The
 German secret service and the NKVD helped each other already during the
 liquidation of Marshal Tukhachevskiy and about a dozen other high Soviet
 officers.  When soon thereafter the Soviet authorities celebrated the entry
 of the German army into Paris by hanging out flags on public buildings in
 Moscow, Trotsky's suspicions became even more credible.

 Of course, there is one thing that not even the suspicious Trotsky
 was able to guess:  that his murderer was already inside the heavily guarded
 house at the corner of Wiener and Morelos Streets and that he was just
 waiting for the right moment, always urged on by his bosses, to perpetrate
 the deed.
 The chief of the "Trotsky special division" and the man in charge
 of the assassination attempts against the founder of the Red Army was Dr.
 Gregory Rabinovich, a cover name concealing NKVD General Leonid Eitingon.
 In America, Rabinovich-Eitingon turned up as a "representative of the Soviet
 Red Cross" with headquarters in 'New York.   In 1940 he temporarily lived in
 a mansion near Trotsky's house.  But here again he played the role of a
 highly refined diplomat of the Jewish faith who on every occasion emphasizes
 his "purely humanitarian mission."
 The public hears only about two attempts to assassinate Trotsky but
 this does not prove that other  plans were not underway   because Rabinovich-
 Eitingon undoubtedly has many other irons in the fire.  After the successful
 second attack he was able to withdraw the assassination specialists, who were
 certainly still kept in readiness rather quickly or he could switch them to
 other persons who were unpopular, in the Kremlin, such as for instance, General
 Krivitsky who defected in 1939 and who made some very embarrassing disclo-
 sures which the international press published widely.
 Krivitsky moved to New York in 1940 because France at that time was
 a playground for NKVD agents and because he no longer felt safe there.  Soon
 thereafter he was found dead in his hotel room, most probably a victim of
 Eitingon's agents.  But the Soviet police also used the German Gestapo and
 the counterintelligence agencies of other countries.  There are a number of
 cases in which we are sure that communists denounced their own comrades to
 the Gestapo in order that these comrades would be put in concentration camps
 where the dirty job of assassination could be accomplished for the NKVD.
 Or unpopular members found "special materials" of the CP on their persons
 or in their possession, after which the police is notified anonymously and
 then finds these compromising materials during a house search.  This inevi-
 tably leads to sentencing for espionage and the particular victim then dis-
 appears for some time in some prison.
 The number of opposition communists removed in this manner runs into
 the thousands if not tens of thousands.  The Spanish civil war of 1936-1939
 offered a particularly dirty possibility for getting rid of unpopular party
 members and perhaps even using their death as propaganda.  Stalin had many
 critics of his policy enticed to Spain as "volunteers" where they were
 either allowed to die a "hero's death" or where they were shot down in
 rear areas as "agents of Franco."  The henchmen who carried out these dirty
 jobs, however, were not only Soviet NKVD men; French, German, and especially
 Spanish communists also volunteered for these dirty details.  The best of
 these professional murderers were brought back to the Soviet Union partly
 after the collapse of the Republican Army and partly even before; back in

 the Soviet Union they were sent to schools in order to learn the very
 latest fine points of their trade.
 Among these specially selected men there was probably also a Spanish
 citizen by the name of Ramon del Rio Mercader, son of the Spanish female
 NKVD agent Caridad Mercader.  He was born in Barcelona on 7 February 1914.
 When his mother left her husband, del Rio, in 1925, she took along her
 children who, in addition to Ramon, included three sons and one daughter.
 She first went to Toulouse and then to Bordeaux and Paris.  Nobody knows
 how she made a living at that time.  One thing is certain:  she was not yet
 in the service of the NKVD at that time.   It is probable that she joined
 the French CP in France.  It seems that she was recruited for the NKVD by
 a French airforce officer with whom she was intimate.
 After his graduation from school, Ramon del Rio Mercader attended a
 hotel management school in Lyon; but after one year, the 15-year old returned
 to Barcelona.  Although his mother had brought him up as a communist, this
 did not stop him from working in the fancy hotels of the "capitalists" and
 adopting their living habits.  This helped later on when he maintained that
 he was the son of a filthy-rich Belgian.  His perfect behavior and comport-
 ment was considered as proof by everyone.
 He served in the Spanish army from 1932 until 1934 and became an active
 communist during that time.  There is no doubt that his mother contributed
 considerably to this; she had in the meantime returned to Spain, most prob-
 ably on orders from the NKVD.                                But it seems that the decisive factor in
 the hiring of Ramon del Rio Mercader was the political situation.
 After the 1931 elections, which were won by the Left, there were
 uprisings of farm workers who were living in misery on the big estates of
 absentee landowners.  During the next elections in 1933 the right-wing
 parties were victorious under the leadership of Gil Robles, of the Catholic
 "Popular Action."  The reactionary forces once again were victorious.  Any-
 one from the Left who wanted to stay out of jail had to camouflage himself.
 In 1935, young Ramon was ordered to found a club of artists called "Cervantes"
 -- a kind of illegal party and propaganda cell of the communists.  The
 place was quickly discovered and Mercader had to spend a few months in jail.
 What he had so far lacked in the way of experience and toughness in
 the political struggle, he now learned quickly from other political pris-
 oners.  After the 1936 elections, which again brought a swing to the Left,
 he was released ahead of schedule and joined the communist militia, firmly
 determined to "repay" the reactionaries.  When the civil war broke out soon
 thereafter, he was appointed political commissar with the rank of lieutenant
 in the 27th Division on the Aragon Front.  Members of this military unit
 later on talked about his unscrupulous behavior.  He was very much like his
 mother who has been described as a "gun moll" filled with fanatical hatred
 of anyone who was against Stalin.

 No one knows whether she introduced her son Ramon to the highest
 officials of the NKVD in Spain or whether these men noticed him on their
 own.    But it is certain that he was a member of the interstaff of the NKVD
 at the very latest in 1937.  He had thus found his "mission" and lived the
 life of a Comintern agent who had unlimited money available to him.
 Systematically educated by his superiors in this "sweet political
 life," he never managed to break away from it because serving in the NKVD
 meant prosperity and power for him.  As NKVD man he was able to move people
 he did not like out of the way.  All it took was one flick of the wrist,
 one anonymous accusation.
 Soon his superiors thought that he was ready for a big mission --
 the biggest mission which the NKVD could assign anybody to at the end of
 the 30's.  First of all he was sent to Paris in the spring of 1938 with
 orders to pass himself off as the son of a Belgian millionaire diplomat.
 He did not have to be careful with the way he handled his money and in addi-
 tion to the usual informer activity he was only asked to do one thing:  he was
 supposed to establish intimate relations with a certain American woman who
 was not exactly a beauty and who was, on top of all this, several years
 older; he was to play the role of her  enthusiastic lover.
 This American woman by the name of Sylvia Ageloff, a convinced
 Trotskyite, had been working as an applied psychologist for the Board of
 Education of the city of New York.  Her "girlfriend" Ruby Well, secretary
 of Louis Budenz, the then chief editor of the communist central organ in the
 United States, the Daily Worker, had enticed her to Paris.  Budenz, who was
 later on converted to Catholicism, in a book reciting his confessions, made
 certain statements which easily make it possible to reconstruct the diaboli-
 cal game whose initiator undoubtedly was Ravinovitch-Eitingon.
 In June 1938, Ruby Weil, quite by accident, introduced Sylvia to
 Ramon del Rio Mercader in Paris; at that time he called himself Jacques
 Mornard-Vandendreschd and maintained that he was the Teheran-born son of
 a Belgian diplomat.  He said that he was born in 1904 in order to make it
 look as if he was older than Sylvia.  There was indeed a man by the name of
 Jacques Mornard who had been born in Teheran in 1908 and whose mother's
 maiden name was Vandendriessche.  No one ever found out whether the real
 Mornard ever knew about Mercader's double game.
 Sylvia Ageloff fell for her new friend with the good manners who was
 able to say:   "I love you" so convincingly -- just as Rabinovitch-Eitingon
 had figured she would.  The 27-year old American woman, whose love life in
 the past had notbeenexactly satisfactory, at any rate was unable to realize
 whom she was facing, although there were quite a few things at that time
 which might have aroused her suspicion.
 For instance, Mornard disappeared for -a few weeks from Paris in July
 1938.   Writing Sylvia from Brussels, he said that his mother had been seriously

 injured in an auto accident while his father had merely suffered shock.
 When Sylvia went to Brussels, her friend could not be found at the address
 he had given.  After his return to Paris he told her that he suddenly had
 to go to Britain; the truth was that he probably simply wanted to get away
 from her for  awhile or that he had to meet Eitingon.  He also tried to
 corrupt her.  One day he offered to sell a series of articles of hers to
 a so-called "Argus Publishing Company."  Sylvia would write an article
 each week which was allegedly printed but she never was given any copies of
 the magazine.
 But love had completely blinded this convinced female Trotskyite.
 She believed every word she was told by her boyfriend with whom she lived
 in a marriage-like relationship and who was ever so attentive.  Evening
 after evening he picked her up in his impressive car, even when she partici-
 pated in September in the strictly conspiratorial charter meeting of the
 4th International for which Trotsky had issued a call and which he had been
 preparing since 1934.  But even if she herself had been more careful -- the
 NKVD would still have found out what was going on without her.  One of the
 most trusted friends of the murdered Leon Sedov, now a representative of
 Trotsky in Paris, the Soviet emigre of Polish-Ukrainian origin, by the name
 of Mark Szborovski,a student of medicine, was a spy of Moscow.
 This is why Eitingon was able to instruct his agent Mornard to make no
 attempts whatever to attend the conference or to find out anything about it
 through questions.  All he was allowed to do was to pick up Sylvia Ageloff
 who was hopelessly in love with him, partly also because he seemed so dis-
 interested in her political activities.   In the spring of 1939 Eitingon
 went one step further.  Mornard was supposed to tell his fiance that a Bel-
 gian newspaper had offered him a job as a correspondent in the United States.
 He therefore suggested to Sylvia that she return to New York and wait for
 him there because he would follow her soon.  But he did not turn up and drop
 in on her until September, after the outbreak of World War It.
 To her great surprise he now called himself Frank Jacson.  When she
 asked him how he had suddenly managed to obtain a Canadian passport, he said
 that he could not get an entry permit because he was a Belgian citizen and
 he therefore  bought a forged passport for 3,600 dollars in order to be near
 her.   It was found out later on with the help of the serial No 31377 that
 this passport had indeed been issued on 22 March 1937 to a Canadian by the
 name of Tony Babich who had been born in Lovinac in Yugoslavia on 13 June
 1905 and who had been killed in action during the Spanish civil war in the
 summer of 1937.  The NKVD, which handled all of the papers of the"Interna-
 tional Brigade," had this passport forged.   In the process, the forgery
 expert obviously forgot to put the letter "k" in the name Jackson.
 In October 1939 "Jacson" went to Mexico City on his doctored passport.
 From there he wrote Sylvia that he felt lonely and that he missed her.  Right
 away she took 3 months leave of absence and followed her fiance who thus took
 a big step closer to his objective because Sylvia would of course also visit

 her sister who happened to be working as a secretary for Trotsky.   Full of
 pride she introduced her bridegroom who made a tremendous impression on her
 sister because of his perfect manners.  Mornard now had the "in" that would
 take him into the house in Coyoacan; the most important thing for him now
 was to have patience.
 And Jacson did have patience.  He was in no hurry because he had not
 met Trotsky in person as yet.  But it would be wrong to credit him with this
 brilliant tactic of assassination which was worked out psychologically down
 to the last detail.  The plans were-certainly made by Dr. Rabinovich alias
 General Eitingon who was much more experienced in getting such plots hatched.
 It was he who managed to play on the feelings of the unfortunate Sylvia
 Ageloff with such great skill and it was he who guided all of the steps of
 Jacson after the assassination attempt of 24 May 1940.
 On 27 February 1940 Trotsky changed his last will as if he knew that
 his days were numbered.  The passages in which he talks about his wife Nathalia
 Sedova bear  witness to his very tender feelings for her:
 "It was my good fortune to be a fighter for socialism; in addition
 to this, destiny gave me the good fortune of being her husband.  Over the
 almost 40 years of life together she has always been inexhaustible source of
 love, generosity, and tenderness.  She suffered greatly but I am happy when
 I realize that she did have some days of happiness."
 The 24 May 1940 attack on the house at the corner of Wiener and
 Morelos Streets had failed; Eitingon now moved up his second pawn, Frank
 Jacson, who in the meantime had managed to gain admittance to the fortress,
 without having asked for it.  He had promised Sylvia Ageloff, who in the
 meantime had returned to New York in March, that he would never enter this
 house without her and he had given her his word of honor; but since the
 Rosmer couple, who had brought grandson Esteban to Coyoacan, one day asked
 Jacson to run a few errands for them, he automatically had a chance to drop
 in at the house in Coyoacan.
 Later on the Rosmers, with whom the Trotskys had been closely connected
 for many decades, accepted Jacson's offer to drive them in his car to the
 ship which they were taking upon leaving Mexico.  And now, 4 days after the
 first attack on 28 May 1940, he pulled up in front of the house in Coyoacan.
 The couple was still at breakfast and he was asked to join them at the table.
 This was the first time he met Trotsky in person.  In his letter to Sylvia,
 Jacson told his fiance why he had broken his promise.  This correct behavior
 of course had a positive effect in his favor.
 After his return from Veracruz he very wisely did not try to meet the
 "great old man" right away again.  He stayed in the background and did not
 show up, as we can see from the entries in the guard book which the secre-
 taries kept with great accuracy.  He did not turn up again in Coyoacan until
 12 June in order to announce that he was going to New York and that he would

 leave his car to the guards for their personal use.  This again is a point
 in his favor especially since he allows one of the guards to accompany him
 to the plane.
 In New York he received the last instructions -- and, considering
 the systematic operating procedure of Leonid Eitingon, we can certainly
 assume that a number of "dress rehearsals" were made.  Jacson is fully
 aware of the danger of his mission and this is why all possibilities that
 might develop must be discussed in great detail.  After his return he sug-
 gested to Trotsky that he accompany him on a mountain climbing trip.  He
 said that he was a very seasoned mountain climber but when the suggestion
 is not immediately accepted he drops it.  He is by far too cautious to force
 anything.
 The various weapons which were later on found on him also indicated
 that he was thinking of all possible ways of assassination.  In his right
 coat pocket he carried a 35-cm long and 3 cm wide dagger; as a second weapon
 he carried a caliber .45 pistol loaded with eight rounds.  The instrument
 with which he finally perpetrated the deed -- an ice pick -- he bought neither
 in New York nor in France, as he said later; instead he probably stole it in
 April from the owner of a tourist hotel in which he had lived for a while
 before his New York trip.
 The guard book records his longest visit on 29 July 1940:   from 1440
 until 1550.  On that day Trotsky and his wife had invited him and his fiance,
 who was spending her annual vacation in Mexico, for tea.  On 8 August he is
 again in the house and stays for more than an hour.  The "dress rehearsal"
 for the assassination took place on this eleventh visit.  He said that he
 had written an article and that he would like Trotsky to read it over.
 While Trotsky read the article, Jacson sat down on a table behind Trotsky's
 chair, something which the host thinks rather unpleasant.
 After that Trotsky told his wife that he did not want to see this
 strange young man anymore; besides he noticed that Jacson kept his hat on
 all the time and held his overcoat close to himself.  There was a good reason
 for this, as it turned out later:  on that very day he carried the stolen ice
 pick and other weapons with him.  Of course, Trotsky did not have the slightest
 idea about any of this but he had a rather unpleasant feeling, as if he was
 somehow  threatened.
 Perhaps Jacson wanted to carry out the assassination on that Saturday
 and perhaps he simply could not muster enough courage.  But there are certain
 indications which lead to the conclusion that, despite all of his unscrupu-
 ousness, he resisted becoming a murderer -- deep inside himself -- until the
 very last.  During the last days before the assassination, not only Sylvia
 Ageloff noticed that her fiance looked strange; Trotsky and his wife were
 also beginning to wonder about his strange behavior which began to look very
 bad compared to his former poise.

 The 20th of August began very pleasantly for Trotsky.  The weather
 was perfect and he felt better than ever before.  Arising around 0700, he
 greeted his wife with the rather fatal words:  "Well, they didn't kill us
 last night either.  And I have not felt so good in a long time."  The morning
 mail also brings happy news.  Trotsky is informed that his files had arrived
 at Harvard University, without any of the secret services trying to interfere
 with the shipment.  He had expected some sort of trouble because he had left
 his files and other documents to the university only on the condition that
 some of these files be placed under lock and key until 1980.
 In the morning he dictated an article on the dictaphone.  At 1300
 he received his American attorney who advised him to take action against a
 certain slander case.  After a period of rest, Trotsky returned to his desk.
 Shortly after 1700, as every day, he went to the stables in the courtyard
 in order to feed the rabbits and chickens.  Taking care of these animals is
 a welcome alternative for him instead of walks and longer hikes in the vicin-
 ity or in the mountains which he had to give up for security reasons.
 When Nathalia Sedova looked down into the garden, she saw young Jacson
 standing next to her husband.  Once again she notices his nervous behavior.
 He looked as if he were seasick.  Jacson greeted her with pronounced courtesy
 and called after her:  "I am terribly thirsty.  Could I have a glass of
 water?"  She offered him tea but he replied:   "No, thanks; I had a late lunch
 and it seems that some of it is backing up on me.  I feel as if I am choking."
 Later on he makes excuses for his girlfriend Sylvia because she had not
 arrived as yet.  He said that she would come any moment in order to say good-
 bye because both of them would leave for New York tomorrow.
 But in reality he very cleverly kept her away.  She was waiting for
 him in her hotel, as he told her to do, and since he is late, something which
 is quite unusual for him, she became more and more worried by the minute.
 Suddenly she is seized by an inexplicable anxiety.  She calls the hotel in
 which both of them were living but no one knew where he was.  At the very
 moment Jacson was already talking to Trotsky and showed him a few typewritten
 pages; this was the article which he had submitted to him three days ago
 and which he had revised in the meantime.  Searchingly the old man looks at
 the visitor and as he notices that Jacson looks very bad he says full of sym-
 pathy:  "You look sick.  I don't at all like your looks.                              You're to watch
 your health more."
 Slowly taking off the gloves which he usually wore when feeding the
 domestic animals, Trotsky walked around in his study.  Jacson followed him.
 About two or three minutes later, shortly before 1800, Nathalia Sedova
 heard a terrible outcry.  She ran outside -- and saw her husband lying at
 the balcony door in the dining room, covered with blood.  "Jacson," groans
 Trotsky and immediately afterward:   "Natasha, I love you so much."  While
 she tried to take care of her seriously injured husband, there was much
 shouting in the study.  The guards were beating down on the assassin with
 their pistol butts.  He tries to defend himself and whimpers:   "They had
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040003-3
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040003-3
 me in their power; they have arrested my mother.  Sylvia has nothing to
 do with this."
 Despite his deadly head injury, Trotsky understood what Jacson said
 and asked one of his bodyguards:  "No, no; don't kill him -- he must be made
 to talk."   The guards stopped beating the assassin who in the meantime had
 regained control of himself.  When the police arrived a few minutes after
 1800 he gave them a letter; he did not have any other personal identity
 documents or other papers on his person; he maintained that he had destroyed
 them earlier.  The letter, written in the French language, was probably
 written many days before on the typewriter; the date was entered in pencil,
 as was the signature "Jac."
 In this letter Jacson first of all states that he is a member of
 an old Belgian family and that he was recruited for the 4th International
 by a friend who then caused him to go to Mexico.  He continued as follows:
 "After a few talks he (Trotsky) finally told me quite clearly what
 he wanted of me.  At that moment all of the illusions collapsed and I felt
 great distrust toward this man in whom I had believed until then.
 "I was to go to Russia and organize a series of assassinations of
 various personalities, first of all Stalin.  This was against all of the
 basic rules of the struggle which so far had been an open and honest struggle
 and this destroyed my entire belief.  I nevertheless did not agree at that
 time [sic] because I wanted to know how far the low character and hatred of
 this man would go."
 This was the strategy of the NKVD.   It is probable that
 Eitingon
 typed
 this letter himself when Jacson was in New York.  But the
 general
 made
 the mistake of making the persuasion periods somewhat too
 short, per-
 haps
 because he was misinformed and perhaps also because he did
 not know
 that
 every visitor and every visit were carefully recorded.  This means
 that
 Jacson was in Coyoacan for a total of eleven visits, totaling 4 hours
 and 27 minutes.  During this time he had no more than 15 minutes with
 Trotsky, in private.  But this is not long enough to get to trust a man to
 make him an offer such as this.  Besides, all of this fitted only too well
 into the image of the "show trials" in Moscow.
 In addition, Jacson stated that Trotsky was in the service of "Ameri-
 can imperialism," in other words, that he was being paid by the government
 in Washington.  In 1940 the Soviet Union was still maintaining friendly
 relations with Hitler Germany.  In the trial, which only took place 3 years
 later, Trotsky is no longer an "American agent"; instead he is a "fascist
 bloodhound" in the pay of the Gestapo because now Hitler is fighting
 against the Soviet Union and Moscow has allied itself with the once dis-
 tained "American plutocrats."
 Jacson made the following statement about the perpetration of the
 deed as such:
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040003-3
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061AO00300040003-3
 "After my talks with Trotsky I developed an unspeakable hatred of
 him.        I clearly realized that I was one of those whom he had abused for his
 own personal advantage because he forced his supporters to sacrifice them-
 selves for his own interests, without any pangs of conscience.  This is why
 I decided to kill him and then to commit suicide only after I was sure that
 he was dead.
 "On the day of the assassination I entered the house around 1830.
 Harold opened the door.   In the courtyard I met several of Trotsky's secre-
 taries.  They told me something which I did not understand.  I asked Harold
 whether Sylvia was there because she had said that she wanted to visit the
 'old man.'  But he said no.   I said:   'Well, I suppose she will come later.'
 I found Trotsky feeding his rabbits.    Then he asked me to go to his study
 with him.  There he took my papers and sat down in a chair at the desk.   I
 stood to his left and he turned his back to me.  He was certainly not sus-
 picious.
 "I put my coat, into whose right corner [sic] a dagger had been sewed
 and in whose left side I had the ice pick, on some piece of furniture, I
 don't recall which one.  I only know that it was on the East side of the
 room behind Trotsky.  While he read the article I took the ice pick out of
 my raincoat, closed my eyes and hit him on the head.  I struck him only
 once.     He let out a terrible yell, threw himself at me at the same time,
 and bit me in the left hand.  You can still see the impression made.  Then
 he staggered back.  After the first outcry, Harold was the first to appear;
 he went to work on me with his pistol butt and he was then joined by Charles
 and Hansen.   I had been stunned by the deed itself and I made no attempt to
 flee.     I do not know whether anyone else entered the room.  The police came
 later and brought me here."
 The Belgian consul who was brought in to look at him doubted Jacson's
 statement that he was really called Mornard-Vandendreschd.     The Belgian
 consul maintained that there was no diplomat by that name and that there
 was no military academy at Dixmuiden and no Jesuit school in Brussels which
 the assassin maintained he had attended.  But Jacson-Mornard persisted in
 his statement.   It was impossible to check out his statement because in
 German-occupied Belgium there is no opportunity for investigations.  Only
 the diplomatic yearbooks were available.  The investigators did not get on
 the right track until years later when, as a result of certain indications
 and hints, the fingerprints of Ramon del Rio Mercader are found; as we
 remember, he had been sentenced to prison because of communist agitation in
 Barcelona in 1936.  A comparison of the fingerprints definitely proved the
 identity of Jacson-Mornard.
 His statement, which he shouted at a moment when he was afraid for his
 life and in which he maintained that he was being blackmailed because his
 mother was under arrest later on turned out to have been sheer invention
 after many years.  At the time of the assassination she and her friend
 Eitingon were 500 m away from Trotsky's house, waiting for her son, in the

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040003-3
 hope that he would succeed in escaping after the murder.  She was fully
 informed on all of the preparations.  Later on, Caridad Mercader told a
 Spanish party comrade by the name of Jesus Hernandez, who was minister of
 justice during the civil war (and who broke with the communists in 1950)
 that she had discussed the assassination of Trotsky directly with Stalin
 and Beria during her visits to the Soviet Union.
 After the deed was done she and her son were awarded the Order of
 Lenin, one of the highest Soviet  decorations.  Evacuated to Ufa during
 the war and put up in the big-shot hotel "Bashkiriya" there, she lived
 later on in the Moscow "Lux" hotel from 1943 until she left the country in
 1944, along with other Comintern big shots.  Equipped with forged passports,
 she lived in Mexico from October 1944 until November 1945 where the estab-
 lished contact with the female communist Dr. Esther Chapa who until 1947
 was the "head of the prison delegation for the prevention of crimes."  Of
 all people, she picked Trotsky's assassin to be her contact man in the
 prison in which he is serving his sentence.  This meant that Jacson was
 able to move about freely within the prison compound and that he had great
 influence upon the guards and prisoners because of his "job."
 No one knows whether Caridad Mercader during her second stay in Mexico
 hoped to be able to make it possible for her son to escape, just as Eitingon
 was able to escape from New York before the 1943 trial, but there are some
 indications for this.  When steps were taken for the first time to help him
 escape, Jacson-Mornard simply refuses to go along.  And he had good reasons.
 He was scared by the example of what had happened to the other NKVD agents.
 So long as Stalin was alive, he was safer in prison.
 A few minutes after the assassination, hundreds of people had gathered
 in front of Trotsky's house.  Reporters arrived and an ambulance came along
 with the police.  But the secretaries refused to allow their chief to be
 removed so long as police General Jose Manuel Nunuz [sic] was not present.
 They were afraid that other assassins might attack the convoy and kill the
 seriously injured man.  They were still hoping that Trotsky could be saved.
 Only after Trotsky had been moved to the hospital is the assassin, half
 beaten to death by the secretaries, moved out.  Quite by accident, he is
 put in a room right next to the one holding his victim.
 Just 2 hours after the attack, seriously injured Trotsky,
 who
 in
 the meantime had lost consciousness, is on the operating table.
 The
 doctors
 realize that his condition is hopeless.  Still, they try to save
 him
 --
 although in vain.  He died on 21 August 1940, at 1925, 25 hours
 and
 35 min-
 utes after the attack.
 The news of his death pushes the war news off the front pages of the
 newspapers. Hundreds of thousands file past his bier in the Great Hall of
 the Alcazar, in the center of the Mexican capital, in complete silence.  A
 vast throng of people followed the funeral procession and very soon the
 people in the streets sing the "Gran Corrida" about Leon Davidovich Trotsky.

 This sad folk song whose author is unknown is on everyone's lips within
 a few days:
 "Trotsky is dead -- slain between morning and night.  Those who
 have loved him now wail.  He who ordered this deed is laughing.  He came
 to us in Coyoacan in order to find hospitality in peace after many years
 of struggle and suffering and Trotsky found death among us.    The murderer
 posed as a friend who was trusted and sneaked into the house which Trotsky
 had built among us.  And he pulled out his ax.  He slew his host and
 friend who had not done him any wrong.  All of Mexico cries for him now
 and all of Coyoacan is in mourning."
 The murderer, who quickly recovered from his shock and the beating
 he had received, is interrogated constantly.  He has an explanation and an
 answer for everything and whenever he gets caught in his own contradictions
 he suddenly manages to protect himself by maintaining that his memory has
 failed him.  Only once did he lose self-control completely; that happened
 when he was confronted with his girlfriend Sylvia Ageloff, who was likewise
 under arrest.
 On 20 August she had in vain waited for her friend at the Hotel
 Montijo until about 1900; she then phoned Coyoacan and heard what had hap-
 pened.                                 She immediately went to the scene of the crime and surrendered to
 the police.  The authorities did believe her when she said that she had
 nothing to do with the assassination but the investigative agencies thought
 it wiser to take her along for the time being.
 When she was put under arrest, the assassin was no longer there.  As
 she now saw him before her, she shouted:   "Take this murderer away.  Kill
 him.  He has killed Trotsky.  Beat him to death."
 One of the officers turned to Sylvia and said:  "Jacson maintains
 that you are the only reason for his existence and that he killed Trotsky
 because of you because you were supposed to become a victim of his intrigues."
 "Lies.  Nothing but lies" replies Sylvia.  "He is a hypocrite, a
 murderer.  Kill him."
 In her presence Jacson-Mornard does not dare repeat his statements.
 Sylvia Ageloff contradicts him on many points and everyone who witnessed this
 confrontation was convinced that she said the truth when she shouted in
 utmost excitement:   "He is a traitor in love, in friendship, in everything.
 I know now that I have been the tool of this swine."  She spat on him and
 when the police took him away she called after him:  "You bastard.  You
 bastard.  You bastard."
 Despite Sylvia Ageloff's statements there are many points which the
 police and the attorneys do not have answers for because it is difficult to
 check these statements in view of wartime conditions; the murderer and his

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040003-3
 boss, Eitingon, who did such a fine job of preparing the assassination,
 certainly figured on this too.  As a result, the investigation could not be
 as thorough as it should have been.
 The longer the investigation lasts, the easier the murderer has it
 in prison.  He has unlimited funds available; he can afford a phonograph, a
 radio, books, newspapers, wine, and even female companionship.   By the time
 the trial is held in 1943 -- after the victorious battle of Stalingrad --
 the international sympathy for Stalin reached a high point considered impos-
 sible in the past.
 Quite by accident it was announced that the defense attorneys had
 received 20,000 dollars "from an unknown source."  It is easy to guess where
 this money came from.  The verdict is announced on 16 April 1943:  Ramon del
 Rio Mercader alias Jacques Mornard alias Frank Jacson is given the maximum
 sentence allowed for murder under Mexican law:  20 years imprisonment.  The
 verdict among others says this:
 "From the beginning of his trip to Mexico until he established per-
 sonal contact with Trotsky and even afterward, Mornard's behavior is full
 of untruths and trickery.  The court must therefore conclude that Frank
 Jacson or Jacques Mornard undertook his trip to Mexico for the sole purpose
 of murdering Trotsky."
 The American Trotskyites asked the government in Washington to be
 allowed to move the body of Leon Trotsky to the United States but the State
 Department refused to issue a visa to the dead man.  On 27 August 1940 the
 corpse is cremated and the urn containing his ashes is buried in the garden
 of the house in Coyoacan.  The spot is marked by a white rectangular stone
 over which waves a red flag.
 Shortly before that, another grave had been dug right next to it.
 The marble slab reads:   "In Memory of Robert Sheldon Harte, 1915-1940, mur-
 dered by Stalin."  Harte, allegedly kidnapped after the 24 May attack, was
 indeed murdered by Stalin's agents but for an entirely different reason
 than Trotsky assumed: he was a spy who had to be silenced.  But Trotsky
 kept believing in the loyality of his bodyguard and awarded the dead man
 an honor which he had not earned.
 The room in which Trotsky was fatally injured has been left in the
 same condition.  His wife Nathalia Sedova, who was to live in that house for
 another 20 years, wanted to make sure that nothing was changed.  She has
 become a lonely old woman; all she has left is one grandson -- and her
 memories.  These memories are not to be touched.  Every morning she greets
 the tomb of her husband.  And she also looks at the marble slab and she
 likewise believes that Harte was not a spy.  Admitting the theory of the
 police would be like treason to her murdered husband and her murdered sons
 and grandchildren.

 After Khrushchev's disclosures to the 20th Congress, Nathalia Sedova
 petitioned the Soviet government that the victor of the 7 November 1917
 revolution, the subsequent founder of the Red Army, Leon Davidovitch Trotsky,
 be rehabilitated; she received no reply to this petition.  The doors of the
 prison opened for Mercader 10 years after Stalin's death.  Czech communists
 were waiting for the murderer at the gates.  They took him to Cuba by plane.
 We lost track of him in Czechoslovakia but we do have information to the
 effect that he is living in a small village near Prague.  Of course, he
 has been stripped of his Order of Lenin and he is no longer a "hero of the
 Soviet Union."

 HARRY SCHULZE-WILDE
 Trotzki, der besiegte Sieger
 Es ist der 24. Mai 1940. Vor dem Haus Ecke
 Wiener- and MorelosstraBe im  Stadtteil
 Coyoacan von Mexico City, in dem der welt-
 bekannte russische Revolutionsfiihrer and Griin-
 der der Roten Armee, Leo Trotzki, seit drei Jahren
 lebt, stehen plaudernd drei Polizisten. Sie gehoren
 zu jenen zehn Polizeibeamten, die von der mexi-
 kanischen Regierung mit der Bewachung dieser
 zur Festung ausgebauten Villa betraut wurden.
 Jeweils fiinf von ihnen haben 24 Stunden Dienst.
 Kurz nach drei Uhr morgens nahern sich ihnen
 zwei Manner in Polizeiuniform and ein dritter
 in der Uniform eines Armeeleutnants. ,Was gibt's
 Kameraden?" fragen sie, als handle es sick um
 eine Inspektion. ,Nichts besonderes", antworten
 die vor dem Wachtturm stehenden Polizisten.
 Doch in diesem Augenblick ziehen die drei An-
 kommlinge ihre Revolver and rufen:  ,Hande
 hoch, Ihr verdammten Schweinel" Gleichzeitig
 tauchen aus dem Dunkel mehrere Manner auf,
 einige in Zivil, die anderen in Uniformen. Sie
 nehmen den fi of Wachtposten die Waffen ab and
 fesseln sic.
 Nachdem sie  die auBere  Bewachung  aus-
 geschaltet haben, klopfen sie an das eiserne Tor,
 doch nicht gerade sonderlich stark, um die Posten
 in  den  mit Maschinengewehren bestiickten
 Turmen auf der Betonmauer nicht zu alarmiercn.
 Das Tor offnet sick sofort, etwa 20 Mann huschen
 in das Innere. Audi in den Garten dringen sie ein,
 and von dort aus verteilen sie sick fiber das ganze
 Haus. Unmittelbar danach zerreiBen FeuerstoBe
 aus Maschinenpistolen die Stille. Aber bevor die
 Bewohner der benachbarten Villen so reiht zur
 Besinnung kommen, ist alles vorbei. Die Ein-
 dringlinge verschwinden in den dunklen StraBen,
 die letzten fRichten mit den beiden Autos aus
 den Garagen des Hauses.
 Nach einer halben Stunde trifft die von Nach-
 barn alarmierte Polizei ein. Sie beginnt sofort mit
 der Untersuchung. Nach Aussage der von ihren
 Fesseln befreiten Bewacher wurden etwa 300
 Schiisse abgefeuert, aber nur Trotzkis Enkel
 Esteban, der erst vor wenigen Tagen aus Frank-
 reich gekommen ist, wurde durch einen Streif-
 schuB am linken FuB verletzt. Leo Trotzki, dem
 der Oberfall gegolten hat, ist mit dean Schrecken
 davongekommen, ebenso seine Fran Nathalic
 Sedowa, die vier amerikanischen Sekretare, der
 Deutsche Otto SchuBler, ein franzosiches Ehepaar
 and die drei Dienstboten: die Kochin, das Stuben-
 madchen and der Hausbursche.
 In Trotzkis  Schlafzimmer zahlt der unter-
 suchende Polizeibeamte 73 Einschlage. Die Ehe-
 leute sind diesem morderischen Kreuzfeuer durch
 Fenster and Tiiren nur entronnen, weil sie sick
 sofort unter das Bett geworfen hatten. Audi der
 kleine Esteban versteckte silt, als er die Schiisse
 horte, unter seinem Bett. Trotz seiner elf Jahre
 weiB er, daB man semen Grolvater unter allen
 Umstanden toten will. Rund ein Dutzend Atten-
 tate sind bisher fehlgeschlagen. Trotzkis Kinder,
 zwei Sohne and zwei Tochter, wurden bereits
 ermordet oder in den Tod getrieben. Von den
 Enkelkindern lebt nur nosh Esteban.
 Aber nicht nur die nachsten Angehorigen, auch
 zahlreiche seiner Freunde and Sieben Sekretare
 starben eines unnatilrlichen Todes: in der UdSSR,
 in Spanien, in Paris, in der Schweiz and in
 anderen Landern. Die von Josef Stalin aus-
 gesandten Murder wuBten ihre Opfer selbst in
 Krankenhausern and einsamen Gebirgsdorfern
 zu finden. Das ist auch der Grund, weshalb
 Trotzki sein Haus in Coyoacan zur Festung aus-
 bauen lieB. Alle erdenklichen SicherheitsmaB-
 nahmcn wurden getroffen. Das Haupttor ist mit
 zwei Querstangen verstarkt, and wenn es geoffnet
 wird, leuchtet eine helle Lampe fiber dem Eingang
 auf. Die Fenster haben stahlerne Schutzschilde
 mit SchieBscharten, and ein Netz von elektrischen
 Drahfen macht es unrnoglich, die Mauer zu iiber-
 klettern. Bei der geringsten Beruhrung der Drahte
 werden  Alarmglocken  ausgelost,  die  einen
 hollischen Larm machen.

 Das Ratsel, wie die Aftentater in these so
 gesicherte Festung kampflos and ohne die Alarm-
 anlagen in Betrieb zu setzen, eindringen konnten,
 lost sick bald: Der in dieser Nacht mit der Wache
 betraute Amerikaner Robert Sheldon Harte ist
 verschwunden. Er muff das Tor geoffnet haben,
 and nach Aussage der Polizeibeamten ist er mit
 den Attentatern im letzten der beiden Autos
 geflohen. Aber Trotzki halt es fur unmoglich, daB
 er mit den ausgesandten Mordern unter einer
 Decke steckte; er glaubt, Sheldon Harte sei ent-
 fuhrt worden.
 Wenige Tage spater findet man die Leiche des
 Sekretars in einem abgelegenen, unbewohnten
 Haus. Die Untersuchung ergibt einwandfrei, das
 Sheldon Harte dort nicht als Gefangener gehalten
 and erst nach einer gewissen Zeit im Schlaf um-
 gebracht wurde. Die Morder haben ihn dann
 unter der Lehmdecke des Fuf3bodens hastig ver-
 scharrt. Wahrscheinlich glaubten sie, daft der Ver-
 rater audi sie verraten konnte. Dennoch will Leo
 Trotzki nicht an den Treuebruch Hartes glauben.
 Der Prozef3 gegen die Attentater, die erstaun-
 lich schnell entlarvt werden konnten and die man
 mit rauhen Methoden zum Sprechen brachte,
 findet bereits Anfang Juli statt. Doch nur die
 zweite Garnitur sitzt auf der Anklagebank; die
 auslandischen Hintermanner, zweifellos Beauf-
 tragte der sowjetischen Geheimpolizei, sind ent-
 kommen. Die Weltoffentlichkeit reagiert auf den
 Prozef3 nur mit maBigem Interesse. Selbst in
 Mexiko nimmt der Krieg in Europa die Aufmerk-
 samkeit der Menschen mehr in Anspruch als die
 dunklen Machenschaften der Stalinschen Geheim-
 polizei, ein Umstand, den die Initiatoren des
 Attentats mit Sicherheit einkalkuliert haben.
 Zwei Wochen vor dem Anschlag auf Trotzki
 hatte die deutsche Wehrmacht in Frankreich ihre
 Offensive eroffnet. Die fur uneinnehmbar ge-
 haltene Maginot-Linie wurde durchbrochen, Paris
 besetzt, Frankreich zum Waffenstillstand gezwun-
 gen and die englische Armee vom Festland ver-
 trieben. Aber auch die Sowjetunion war aktiv
 gewesen. Nach der Okkupation Ostpolens im
 September 1939 besetzte die Rote Armee Mitte
 Juni die bis dahin selbstandigen Staaten Litauen,
 Lettland and Estland.
 Trotzki ist mit der Prozel3fuhrung einverstan-
 den. Unmit3verstandlich erklart er:  In keinem
 anderen Land der Welt, weder in Frankreich noch
 in der Schweiz, noch in Spanien, ist je eines der
 Verbrechen der GPU mit solcher Sorgfalt unter-
 sucht and verfolgt worden, wie jetzt in Mexiko
 der Anschlag auf mein Lebenl" Aber er weif3
 auch, daB die Morder wegen des miBgluckten
 Anschlags ihre Absicht nicht aufgeben werden.
 Einem hoheren Polizeibeamten gegenuber erklart
 er: ?Das Schicksal hat mir nodi einmal eine Frist
 gegeben, dock sic wird nicht von langer Dauer
 sein." Wenn er morgens aufwacht, pflegt er zu
 seiner Frau zu sagen: "Heute nacht haben sic uns
 nicht umgebracht. Wir haben noch einen kleinen
 Aufschub erhalten."
 Wer ist dieser Mann, der bis jetzt mehr als
 einem Dutzend Anschlagen entging, dessen vier
 Kinder man ermordete oder durch Verweigerung
 arztlicher Hilfeleistung in den Tod trieb, dessen
 Haus man mehrere Male anziindete, um ihn and
 seine Anhanger wie Ratten auszurauchern, and
 den die Kommunisten der ganzen Welt als ,Ver-
 rater am Sozialismus", als ?Kapitahstenknecht",
 als ?Agenten des Faschismus" and neuerdings
 auch als ?Agenten des amerikanischen Imperialis-
 mus" brandmarken?
 Leo Davidowitsch Bronstein, genannt Trotzki,
 wurde am 26. Oktober 1879 (nach dem grego-
 rianischen Kalender am 7. November) in Janowka,
 Gouvernement Cherson (Ukraine), geboren. Er
 war das funfte von acht Kindern, von denen aber
 schon vier fruhzeitig starben. Dem Vater David
 Bronstein, einem wohlhabenden Landwirt, der
 400 Desjatinen fruchtbaren Ackerbodens von
 einem heruntergekommenen adligen Gutsbesitzer
 erworben hatte, gelang es durch harte Arbeit,
 semen Besitz zu vergr0ern. Er baute Werk-
 statten, neue Stalle fur das Vieh and eine groBe
 Muhle. Nach der Revolution, der sein Sohn zum
 Siege verhalf, verlor er alles. Verbittert and
 gleichzeitig stolz auf ihn, starb er 1922 als Leiter
 einer staatlichen Mdhle.
 Als Leo Davidowitsch geboren wurde, regierte
 in RuBland Zar Alexander II. Er hatte 1861 die
 bauerliche Leibeigenschaft aufgehoben. Die fort-
 schrittlich-liberalen Krafte setzten deshalb grofle
 Hoffnungen auf ihn. Aber bevor er sein Reform-
 werk  durch eine  konstitutionelle  Verfassung
 kronen konnte, wurde er (am 1. Marz 1881) er-
 mordet. Sein Sohn, Alexander III., stand ganzlich
 unter dem Einflui3 Pobjedonosszews, des Ober-
 prokurators des Heiligen Synod - eines bigotten
 Reaktionars, der am liebsten die Leibeigenschaft
 wieder eingefuhrt hatte.
 Der alte Bronstein, der - wie Millionen rus-
 sischer Bauern - weder lesen noch schreiben
 konnte, schickte seinen Sohn auf eine jiidische
 Schule, wo er in jiddischer Sprache, die er nicht

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040003-3
 Trotzki, der besiegfe Sieger
 beherrschte, unterrichtet wurde. Zu Hause sprach
 man ukrainisch. Aber der Besuch dieser jidischen
 Schule war fur den kleinen Bronstein trotz allem
 von grof3er Bedeutung: Er lernte dort namlich
 auch russisch.
 Wieder in Janowka, bildete er sich selber
 weiter. Bereits mit sechs Jahren konnte er dem
 Vater die Rechnungen ausschreiben and sogar
 die Bucher fiihren. Die Eltern waren auf ihren
 Sohn unsagbar stolz. Fur sie stand Pest: Dieser
 Wunderknabe  mul3te studierenl  Die nachste
 Station des Bildungsweges konnte deshalb nur
 Odessa  sein, die Hafenstadt am Schwarzen
 Meer, das russische Marseille and die beriich-
 tigste Polizeistadt dieses Polizeistaates".
 Doch nicht in einer staatlichen Schule fand der
 siebenjahrige Knabe Aufnahme, sondern in der
 ,,Realschule des HI. Paulus", ciner Griindung der
 deutsch-lutherischen Kirchengemeinde. Der Un-
 terricht wurde in russischer Sprache erteilt, die
 Schuler and Lehrer waren deutscher, schweize-
 rischer, russischer, polnischer, rumanischer and
 griechischer Herkunft, ein getreues Spiegelbild des
 Volkergemisches in diesem Teil des Zarenreiches.
 Aber auch dem religiosen Bekenntnis nach war
 alles vertreten: neben Schiiiern aus lutherischen,
 romisch-katholischen, griechisch-orthodoxen, jii-
 dischen and calvinistischen Familien besuchten
 sogar Kinder verschiedener Sekten diese Schule.
 Der junge Bronstein, schon im ersten Schuljahr
 Primus seiner Klasse, lernte hier vor allem deutsch
 and franzosisch, ferner auch italienisch and die
 klassischen Sprachen Griechisch and Latein. Po-
 litisch betatigte er sich nicht. In der vom liberalen
 Geist gepragten ,Sdiule des Hl. Paulus" gab es
 keine revolutionaren Zirkel; sie entstanden nur
 in  den  wie  Kasernen  gefiihrten  staatlichen
 Schulen.
 Erst in Nikolajew, wo sich der Siebzehnjahrige
 auf den Besuch einer Universitat vorbercitcn
 sollte, trat er mit ?Marxisten" in Verbindung.
 Doch vorerst forderten sie nur seinen Spott her-
 aus. Bei einer Silvesterfeier 1896 erklarte er in
 einem Trinkspruch: ,Fluch alien Marxisten, die
 soviel Harte and Ode in das Leben bringen." Und
 der erste politische Artikel aus seiner Feder
 richtete sich gegen den Marxismus.
 Diese Episode war jedoch nur kurz. Als er 1897
 sein Abitur mit ,ausgezeichnet" bestand, war er
 bereits cin begeisterter Anhanger der aus London
 and Deutschland kommenden Lehre von Karl
 Marx. Der alte Bronstein tobte and verlangte von
 seinem Sohn, er solle sich mit revolutionaren
 Theorien nicht mehr befassen. Leo Davidowitsch
 gab nicht nach. Er verzichtete auf die materiellen
 Zuwendungen des Vaters and verdiente semen
 Lebensunterhalt mit Privatstunden.
 Noch in Nikolajew organisierte er, 19 Jahre
 alt, eine revolutionare Organisation, den ,Siid-
 russischen Arbeiterbund", beinahe schon so etwas
 wie eine Partei, wenn auch in lokalen Grenzen.
 Als ihm der Boden zu heil3 wurde, wollte er 1898
 nach Janowka zuriickkehren. Unterwegs ver-
 haftete ihn die Polizei. Fast zwei Jahre saB er in
 Untersuchungshaft, Ef de 1899 wurde er ohne Ge-
 richtsurteil fiir vier Jahre nach Sibirien verbannt.
 Im Gefangnis hatte er die ebenfalls zur Ver-
 bannung verurteilte Alexandra Sokolowskaja ge-
 heiratet. In seinem Buch ?Mein Leben" widmete
 er diesem Ereignis nicht einmal drei Zeilen:  Die
 gemeinsame Arbeit hatte uns eng verbunden. Um
 nicht getrennt angesiedelt zu werden, hatten wir
 uns  im  Moskauer  Etappengefangnis        trauen
 lassen." Aus der Ehe gingen zwei Tochter her-
 vor. Aber noch vor Ablauf der vier Jahre verliefi
 Trotzki seine Familie.
 Der Ruhm des jungen Revolutionars, der mit
 19 Jahren eine eigene Gruppe organisiert hatte
 and der von seinem Verbannungsort Wercholensk
 aus Verbindung mit seinen ebenfalls verbannten
 Kameraden hielt, hatte sick bis nach Zentral-
 Rufiland verbreitet. Audi die Artikel, die er unter
 dem Pseudonym ,Antid Oto" in der in Irkutsk
 erscheinenden OstIichen  Rundschau veroffent-
 lichte, fielen auf. Man legte ihm deshalb nahe
 zuriickzukehren. Mit einem falschen PaB aus-
 geristet, in den er den Namen eines Gefangnis-
 warters eingeschrieben hatte, erreichte er Irkutsk.
 Dieser zufallig gewahlte ,Pauname" Trotzki solite
 Weltgeschichte machen.
 In Irkutsk bestieg er den Zug nach Samara, dem
 heutigen Kuibyschew, Hauptquartier der illegal
 erscheinenden Zeitung Iskra and Sammelbeeken
 der marxistisch orientierten Revolutionare, die
 gegeniiber den friiher so aktiven Terroristen-
 gruppen immer mehr Anhanger gewannen. Von
 dort aus schickte man ihn nach Charkow, Poltawa
 and Kiew, die geheim existierenden Ortsgruppen
 der Sozialdemokratischen Partei zu kontrollieren.
 Wieder in Samara, erhielt er die Aufforderung,
 nach London zu kommen, der westeuropaischen
 Zentrale der Iskra. Die einern Befehl gleich-
 kommende ,Einladung" hatte Wladimir Iljitsch
 Lenin unterschrieben.
 Wo immer Trotzki auftauchte, wurde man rasch
 auf ihn aufmerksam, riihmte man seine iiber-
 ragenden geistigen Fahigkeiten, die analytische

 Scharfe seiner Artikel and seine glanzende
 rednerische Begabung. Auch in London spielte
 er schon nach wenigen Wochen eine bedeutende
 Rolle. Auf dem II. Parteitag im Jahre 1903, der
 in Briissel begonnen hatte and dann nach London
 verlegt wurde, registrierte man seinen Elan and
 seine Leidenschaft mit Aufmerksamkeit. Auf
 Lenins Vorschlag hin, der ihm ,seltene Eigen-
 schaften" attestierte, wurde Trotzki in den Redak-
 tionsstab der Auslands-Iskra gewahlt. Spater
 schickte man ihn nach Frankreich, in die Schweiz
 and nach Belgien. Auf semen Reisen lernte er
 nicht nur die bedeutendsten europaischen Sozia-
 listen kennen, sondern audi Nathalie Sedowa, die
 damals in Paris Kunstgeschichte studierte. Sic
 wurde, ohne standesamtliche Formalitaten, seine
 Lebensgefahrtin, die fortan alle Triumphe and
 alles Leid mit ihm teilen sollte.
 DaB Trotzki and der um zehn Jahre altere
 Lenin (der ihn zeitweise furderte) nicht selten
 - meist wegen zweitrangiger Fragen - heftig
 aneinandergerieten, ist cine Tatsache, die Stalin
 20 Jahre spater weidlich ausnutzen sollte, um
 Trotzki einer ?antileninistischen" - and das hieB
 ?antirevolutionaren" - Haltung zu bezichtigen.
 Das war eine bewuBte Verleumdung. Es hat sich
 uberdies erwiesen, daB in vielen dieser Fragen
 nicht Lenin, sondern Trotzki recht hatte. Nahe-
 liegender als von Gegnerschaft zu sprechen, ware
 es, die beiden Manner mit den zwei Polen eines
 Magneten zu vergleichen, die nur zusammen ein
 Kraftfeld erzeugen. Heute wissen wir jedenfalls,
 daB nicht nur Trotzki von Lenin stark beeinfluBt
 wurde (so daB In zahlreiche, im Exil lebende
 Russen als dessen ,Keule" bezeichneten), sondern
 daB auch Lenin vieles von Trotzkis Theorien
 ubernahm: zurn Beispiel die der ?Permanenten
 Revolution". Der Vater dieser These war aller-
 dings nicht Trotzki, sondern nachweislich sein
 zeitweiliger- Gunner,  der  russische  Emigrant
 Alexander Helphand, der spater unter dem
 Namen Parvus weltbekannt wurde. Unter ?Per-
 manenter Revolution" verstand er - and nach
 ihm Trotzki - eine Revolution, die erst dann
 beendet sei, wenn alle Lander der Erde kommu-
 nistisch geworden waren.
 Der EinfluB, den Helphand auf viele russische
 and westeuropaische Sozialisten ausiibte, griindete
 sich nicht zuletzt auf die Tatsache, daB er bereits
 1895 den erst zehn Jahre spater ausbrechenden
 russisch-japanischen Krieg and in dessen Folge
 die russische Revolution als Vorspiel zur Welt-
 revolution" vorausgesagt hatte. Diese den Pro-
 gnosen von Marx entgegengesetzte Prophetic
 schien unheimlich and trug nicht wenig dazu bei,
 den Ruf der ?dialektischen Geschichtsauffassung"
 zu festigen.
 Als es im Januar 1905 in St. Petersburg zu
 Unruhen kam, verlieB Trotzki seine gesicherte
 Position  bei  dem  schon  recht vermogenden
 Parvus-Helphand, der ihm in Munchen Wohnung
 and Arbeitsmoglichkeiten gegeben hatte, and
 reiste nach RuBland - ein gefahrliches Unter-
 nehmcn, denn entflohene Verbannte wurden,
 wenn man sic wieder faBte, auBerordentlich hart
 bestraft. Fast alle anderen fiihrenden Revolutio-
 nare blieben dagegen im Ausland, um erst einmal
 abzuwarten, wie Bich die Verhaltnisse entwickeln
 warden.
 Trotzki stiirzte sich mutig in die Strudel der
 Ereignisse. Er wurde zum anerkannten Fiihrer
 der stark kommunistisch gefarbten Revolution von
 1905, die das zaristische RuBland schwer erschiit-
 terte. Nicht nur die zahlreichen Streiks ri ttelten
 am politischen Gefuge des autokratisch regierten
 Staates, viel schwerer wog, daB auch ein Teil der
 Flotte meuterte. Nur mit Miihe gelang es, die alte
 Ordnung wiederherzustellen.
 Anfang Dezember 1905 wurde Trotzki ver-
 haftet and 23 Monate spater zu lebenslanglicher
 Verbannung in ein gottverlassenes Nest im Polar-
 gebiet an der Mundung des Ob geschickt. Auf
 dem Wege dorthin gelang es ihm, zu entkommen.
 Mit auBergewohnlicher Energie and staunens-
 werter korperlicher Zahigkeit schlug er sich durch
 die Taiga and erreichte Petersburg, von wo er
 nadi einigen Tagen Aufenthalt fiber Helsinki
 nach London zuri ckkehrte. Er traf gerade node
 rechtzeitig cin, um am V. Parteitag der Sozial-
 demokratischen  Arbeiterpartei  RuBlands  teil-
 nehmen zu kennen.
 Zum ersten Male entwickelte er hier in der
 Offentlichkeit seine, das heiBt Parvus' Theorie von
 der ?Permanenten Revolution". Lenin and andere
 Links-Sozialisten, unter ihnen Rosa Luxemburg,
 unterstiltzten ihn and feierten ihn nicht nur
 als groBen Revolutionar, dessen mutiges Auf-
 treten in St. Petersburg and spater im ProzeB
 weltweites Aufsehen erregt hatte, sondern auch
 als bedeutenden Theoretiker. AnschlieBend reiste
 er nach Berlin, wo ihn seine Lebensgefahrtin
 Nathalie Sedowa mit dem 1906 geborenen Sohn
 Leon erwartete.
 Auch in Deutschland wurde Trotzki gefeiert.
 Parvus machte ihn mit den Fi hrern der deutschen
 Sozialdemokratie bekannt: mit Karl Kautsky,
 dem alten Bebel, Georg Ledebour, Franz Mehring
 and Hugo Hase. Ihre Namen hatten internatio-

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040003-3
 nalen Klang, denn die deutsche Sozialdemokra-
 tische Partei war die starkste and bestorganisierte
 der Welt. Aber die Jahre 1907 bis 1914 waren fur
 Trotzki im Grunde genommen nur Lehrjahre.
 Erst nach Ausbruch des ersten Weltkrieges sollte
 er seine historische Aufgabe finden - ohne daft
 ihm das sofort bewuBt geworden ware.
 Mit militarischen Fragen hatte sick Leo Trotzki
 bisher nosh nicht beschaftigt, erst wahrend der
 beiden Balkankriege 1911 and 1912 sah er sich als
 Zeitungskorrespondent mit den Problcmen von
 Strategic and Taktik konfrontiert. In seinen
 Artikeln enthiillte er nicht nur schonungslos die
 Greueltaten, die von beiden Seiten begangen
 wurden and die ihn ,an die Art des DreiBig-
 jahrigen Krieges" erinnerten, er beschaftigte sich
 auch zunehmend mit militarischen Unternehmun-
 gen. Nur die Auswirkungen irgendwelcher MaB-
 nahrnen zu schildern, geniigte ihm nicht; er wollte
 auch die Ursachen and inneren Zusammenhange
 erkennen.
 Der Ausbruch des ersten Weltkrieges iiber-
 raschte ihn in Wien. Nadi kurzem Zwischen-
 aufenthalt in der Schweiz reiste er nach Paris.
 Wie wahrend der beiden Balkankriege betatigte
 er sich auch jetzt - unter wechselnden Pseudo-
 nymen - als Korrespondent verschiedener Zei-
 tungen. Aufsehen erregten vor allem seine 1915
 and 1916 geschriebenen Artikel, in denen er sich
 mit der Entwicklung des Krieges zum Stellungs-
 krieg beschaftigte. Der spateren, systematischen
 Diffamierung Trotzkis durch Stalin ist es zuzu-
 schreiben, daB these journalistisch brillanten and
 hochbedeutenden Aufsatze auch heute noch nahe-
 zu unbekannt rind.
 In den Pariser Jahren war Trotzki zudem ein
 eifriger Besucher der Bibliotheque Nationale. Er
 studierte dort vor allem militarische Zeitschriften
 and Bucher, wohl ohne zu ahnen, welche Be-
 deutung die dabei gesammelten Kenntnisse and
 Erkenntnisse einmal erlangen wurden: Keine fiinf
 Jahre spater befehligte Leo Trotzki eine in zahl-
 reichen Schlachten siegreiche Millionenarmee ...
 Im September 1916 schob die franzosische Regie-
 rung den unliebsamen Emigranten nach Spanien
 ab. Am 20. Dezember ging er mit Nathalie
 Sedowa and den beiden Sohnen Leon and Sergej
 in Barcelona an Bord eines spanischen Dampfers,
 der ihn nach New York bringen sollte. Als das
 Schiff die Strafie von Gibraltar passierte, schrieb
 Trotzki an einen Freund: ?Das ist das letzte Mal,
 daB ich der alien Kanaille Europa einen Blick
 zuwerfe."
 Als er in New York eintraf, wurde er von zahl-
 reichen russischen Sozialisten, die hier Asyl
 gefunden batten, begeistert begriifit. Ahnten sic,
 dali sic einen der grofien Fiihrer der kommenden
 Revolution feierten? Zwei Monate spater wehten
 in der russischen Hauptstadt Petrograd (St. Peters-
 burg) auf vielen Adelspalasten rote Fahnen.
 Trotzki fuhr in New York von Versammlung
 zu Versammlung and prophezeite den Sieg des
 Sozialismus, obwohl es in den ersten Wochen aus-
 sah, als ob das Burgertum die Macht in der Hand
 behalten wUrde and der Zar nur deshalb zur
 Abdankung gezwungen worden war, um die
 Kriegsanstrengungen zu vergroliern. Aber Trotzki
 war sich seiner Sache sicher. Triumphierend
 erklarte er: Die machtige Lawine der Revolution
 ist in vollem Lauf, and keine menschliche Kraft
 wird sick ihr entgegenstemmen konnenl" Wie
 Lenin verlangte auch er nicht in erster Linie den
 Sturz der alten Gesellschaftsordnung, sondern die
 Beendigung des Krieges.
 Mit einem norwegischen Schiff verliefi er am
 27. Marz  1917 New  York.  Doch bei einer
 Zwischenlandung in Kanada holten ihn  die
 Englander von Bord. Unter dem Druck zahl-
 reicher Proteste wurde er nach drei Wochen
 freigelassen and durfte seine Reise fortsetzen. Am
 17. Mai, einen Monat spater als Lenin, erreichte
 er Petrograd. Eine ungeheure Menschenmenge
 begruf3te ihn. Die Arbeiter hoben den Helden der
 Revolution von 1905 auf ihre Schultern and
 trugen ihn im Triumph durch die Strafien.
 Schon wenige Stunden nach seiner Ankunft
 eilte er in das Smolny-Institut, den Sitz des Petro-
 grader Sowjets. Obwohl man ihn nur als Mitglied
 mit beratender Stimme aufnahm, war Trotzki
 zufrieden. Kein anderer hatte eine derartige Rede-
 gewalt wie er, and nicht sein Ja- oder Neinzettel
 wurde entscheidend sein, sondern das, was er zu
 sagen hatte. Die Rechnung ging auf. Schon nach
 kurzer Zeit war er der Wortfiihrer der Revolu-
 tion. Besonders die  Matrosen auf den Kriegs-
 schiffen and im Marinestiitzpunkt  Kronstadt
 hielten fest zu ihm, ein Erfolg, der am 7. Novem-
 ber 1917 die Entscheidung herbeifiihren sollte.
 Nachdem im Juli ein Versuch Lenins and seiner
 Anhanger, die Macht an sich zu reif3en, fehl-
 geschlagen war, wurde auch Trotzki mit zahl-
 reichen anderen verhaftet, aber bald wieder frei-
 gelassen. Ende September wahlte der Petrograder
 Sowjet Leo Trotzki, nunmehr offizielles Mitglied
 der Bolschewiki, zu seinem- Prasidenten. Die
 wirtschaftliche Krise hatte inzwischen ungeahnte
 Ausmalie erreicht. Die Versorgung der Stadte mit

 Lebensmitteln war vollig zusammengebrochen,
 teilweise wegen der katastrophalen Transport-
 verhaltnisse, teilweise wegen der Zustande auf
 dem Lande.
 Da die Regierung nicht bereit gewesen war, eine
 Bodenreform einzuleiten, oder auch nur zu ver-
 sprechen, hatten die landlosen Bauern zur Selbst-
 hilfe gegriffen. Die Folge dieser Eigenmachtig-
 keiten konnte nur ein Absinken der Produktions-
 ziffern sein. Die Stadte litten naturgemaB am
 meisten darunter. AuBerdem mangelte es an
 Arbeitskraften.  Ober fiinf Millionen  Bauern
 standen an den Fronten, dienten in den Kasernen
 oder  vegetierten  in  den   Gefangenenlagern
 Deutschlands and Osterreich-Ungarns. Das war
 einer der Griinde, warum die Forderungen der
 Bolschewiki nach einem sofortigen FriedensschluB
 auch in den Dorfern groBe Zustimmung her-
 vorrief.
 Parallel mit dieser Agitation unter den Arbei-
 tern and Bauern liefen die Vorbereitungen fur
 eine neue Erhebung der Bolschewiki. Trotzki ging
 dabei von der Oberlegung aus, daB die klassi-
 schen Formen bisheriger Revolutionen uberholt
 seien. Bastillensturm, Barrikadenkampfe, emotio-
 nale Massenerhebungen waren sinnlos geworden.
 Der moderne Staat muBte durch einen organisier-
 ten Staatsstreich erobert werden. Bei der Entwick-
 lung dieser neuen Revolutionsstrategie kamen
 Trotzki erstmals jene Erkenntnisse  praktisch
 zunutze, die er bei seinen militarwissenschaft-
 lichen Studien in Paris gewonnen hatte.
 Er traf seine Anordnungen fast generalstabs-
 maBig. Mit propagandistischen Mitteln wurde die
 Stellung sturmreif gemacht, so daB nach geniigen-
 der Vorbereitung kleinere,  gut ausgeriistete
 StoBtrupps die Nervenzentren des Staates lahm-
 legen konnten. Eroberte man zunachst die Mini-
 sterien, Elektrizitatswerke and Telefonamter, so
 war jede Gegenwehr von vornherein zum MiB-
 erfolg verurteilt and der eigene Sieg gesichert.
 Als die deutsche Heeresleitung wieder zur
 Offensive uberging, war eine Zeitlang auch Petro-
 grad bedroht. Die Regierung gab Marschbefehle
 an die Truppen heraus, and schickte sich an, nach
 Moskau iiberzusiedeln. Trotzki schlug im Sowjet
 Alarm. Die von ihm aufgeputschten Soldaten
 weigerten sich, Petrograd zu verlassen. Ein milita-
 risches Revolutionskomitee verteilte 5000 Gewehre
 an die Arbeiter, angeblich nur zur ?Verteidigung
 der Hauptstadt". Als jedoch die deutschen Trup-
 pen ihren Vormarsch gegen Petrograd einstellten,
 hieB es, these Waffen dienten ?zur Verteidigung
 der Errungenschaften der Revolution". Aber
 jedermann in Petrograd wuBte, daft es die
 Bolschewiki nunmehr auf den Sturz der Regierung
 abgesehen hatten.
 Der demokratische Ministerprasident Kerenski
 war zur Abwehr entschlossen. Am 6. November
 verbot er die bolschewistische Prawda, die seit
 dem Juliputsch unter dem Titel Rabotschij Putj
 erschien. Daraufhin lieB Trotzki die Druckerei
 der biirgerlichen Zeitungen besetzen and gab eine
 neue Nummer der Prawda heraus, auf deren
 Vorderseite der beruhmte Befehl Nr. 1 stand:
 ?Soldaten 1 Arbeiter l Burger 1
 Die Volksfeinde sind in der Nacht zum An-
 griff ubergegangen. Man plant einen verrate-
 rischen Anschlag gegen den Petrograder Sowjet
 der Arbeiter- and Soldatendelegierten ...
 Alle Regiments-, Kompanie- and Mannschafts-
 komitees mit den Kommissaren des Sowjets and
 alle revolutionaren Organisationen mussen in
 der Permanenz tagen and alle Nachrichten i ber
 die Plane and Aktionen der Verschworer in
 ihren Handen konzentrieren.
 Kein Soldat darf ohne Genehmigung des
 Komitees seine Einheit verlassen.
 . Die Sache des Volkes ist in festen Han-
 den. Die Verschworer werden vernichtet ...
 Keine Schwankungen, keine Zweifell Festig-
 keit,  Standhaftigkeit, Ausdauer  and  Ent-
 schlossenheit  sind vonnoten.  Es         lebe die
 Revolution."
 Das war das Signal zur allgemeinen Aktion.
 In der Nacht zum 7. November (dem 25. Oktober
 nach dem alten russischen Kalender) wurde der
 Staatsstreich nach den von Trotzki ausgearbeite-
 ten Planen ausgefuhrt. Zu allem entschlossene
 StoBtrupps besetzten die Bahnhofe, die Elektrizi-
 tatswerke, die militarischen Proviantlager, the
 Wasserreservoirs, die Briicken von den Vorstadten
 zum Stadtinnern, die Telefonzentrale, die Staats-
 bank and zahlreiche andere Gebaude. Gegen
 zehn Uhr morgens wurden auch alle Zugange
 zum Winterpalais abgeriegelt. Die Minister waren
 von der Umwelt abgeschnitten, and damit hatte
 die bolschewistische Revolution faktisch gesiegt.
 Ministerprasident Kerenski hatte die Hauptstadt
 am Morgen des 7. Novembers mit einem Auto der
 amerikanischen Botsciaft verlassen, um Hilfe von
 auBen herbeizuholen. Seine Minister warteten im
 Winterpalais auf seine Riickkehr. Am Mittag
 trieben revolutionare Soldaten mit dem blanken
 Bajonett die Abgeordneten des ,Provisorischen
 Rates der Russischen Republik" auseinander.
 Anderthalb Stunden spater eroffnete Trotzki eine
 Sitzung des Petrograder Sowjets and erklarte im
 Namen des ?MilitNrischen Revolutionskomitees",
 die provisorische Regierung bestehe nicht mehr.

 Unter dem brausenden Jubel der Delegierten
 fugte er hinzu: ,Einige Minister befinden sich in
 Haft. Die anderen werden in den nachsten Tagen
 oder Stunden verhaftet werden. Die revolutionare
 Garnison, die zur Verfugung des militarischen
 Revolutionskomitees steht, hat die Versammlung
 des Vorparlaments aufgelost. Man hat uns gesagt,
 daft der Aufstand der Garnison in Stromen von
 Blut ersauft werden wiirde. Uns ist auch nicht ein
 einziges Opfer bckannt. Ich kenne in der Ge-
 schichte kein anderes Beispiel einer Revolution ..
 die so unblutig verlaufen ware."
 Das traf in der Tat zu. Noch nie hatte es einen
 Umsturz gegeben, der kein Opfer gefordert hatte,
 and erstaunt stellte der russisch-franzosische
 Journalist Claude Anet fest, daB die zuri ck-
 gebliebenen analphabetischen Russen eine Revo-
 lution ganz anders machten, als in den Geschichts-
 biichern nachzulesen sei. Aber es lieB sick auch
 nicht bestreiten, daft die bolschewistische Macht-
 ergreifung wie eine nach den Planen eines Gene-
 ralstabes gestartete Offensive abgelaufen war.
 Nirgends hatte man Schi sse gehort, nirgends sah
 man Insubordinationen revolutionarer Arbeiter
 and Soldaten. Die StraBen waren leer, es wurde
 nicht einmal gepliindert.
 Lenin, der am Abend vorher, noch immer ver-
 kleidet, aus seinem Versteck in den Sitz des Revo-
 lutionskomitees, den Smolny, gekommen war, kam
 these Rube unheimlidi vor. Audi er hatte noch
 die klassischen Bilder friiherer Revolutionen vor
 Augen. Erst als er die Berichte horte, die laufend
 von den einzelnen StoBtrupps eingingen, erkannte
 er, daB der Umsturz gegliiclct war. Am Abend
 dieses ereignisreichen 7. November schliefen der
 geistige Fi hrer dieser Revolution and Trotzki,
 der vor Erschopfung olinmachtig geworden war,
 auf dem FuBboden eines Zimmers neben der
 groBen Halle des Smolny.
 Noch war das Winterpalais, Sitz der Regierung,
 nicht genommen. Jetzt bewahrte sich Trotzkis
 Freundschaft mit den Matrosen. Der Kreuzer
 ,,Aurora" dampfte von Kronstadt gegen Petrograd
 and eroffnete das Feuer. Doch es wurde nur mit
 blinder Munition geschossen. Das Winterpalais
 fiel nicht durch die Angriffe der Matrosen, es
 wurde regelrecht erstilrmt. Die Metropole eines
 groBen Reiches mit 150 Millionen Einwohnern, in
 dem fiinf Millionen Soldaten and Polizisten unter
 Waffen standen, hatte vor zehn-, vielleicht auch
 fiinfzehntausend zum groBen Teil analphabeti-
 schen Bauern and Arbeitern, die von einem Mann
 gefuhrt wurden, der noch nie Gelegenheit gehabt
 hatte, seine militarischen Fahigkeiten unter Beweis
 zu stellen, kampflos kapituliert.
 Der neuen Regierung der Volkskommissare
 prasidierte Lenin. Auflenminister war Trotzki.
 Doch schon nach drei Tagen muBte er an die
 Front" vor den Toren Petrograds gehen: Dem ge-
 sturzten Kerenski war es gelungen, einige Ko-
 sakenregimenter fur sick zu gewinnen. Aber
 bevor es zum Kampf kam, hatte Trotzki sie schon
 mit der Macht seiner Rede besiegt. Nach lour: em
 Geplankel ergaben sie sick. Gleichzeitig mit dicser
 Siegesmeldung lief die Nachricht in der Haupt-
 stadt ein, daB sich Moskau and andere groBe
 Stadte der Revolution angeschlossen hatten and
 auch auf dem Lande setzte sich die neue Regie-
 rung durch.
 Die Friedensverhandlungen mit Deutschland
 and semen Verbtindeten Osterreich-Ungarn, Bul-
 garien and der Tiirkei in Brest-Litowsk leitete
 Trotzki selber. Die kaiserlich-deutsche Regierung
 verspielte dabei eine groBe Chance. Statt mit den
 Bolschewiki  einen  Verstandigungsfrieden  zu
 schlieBen and damit ein Beispiel zu geben, setzte
 sie einen Diktatfrieden durch. Die Sowjetregie-
 rung nahm die recht harten Bedingungen schlieB-
 lich an, um eine Atempause zu gewinnen. Trotzki
 wechselte im Marz 1918 vom AuBenministerium
 in das neugebildete Kriegskommissariat hiniiber.
 Er hatte nun die Aufgabe, verlaBliche Rote Ein-
 heiten zu schaffen, um die i1berall im Land ent-
 stehenden weiBgardistischen Armeen besser be-
 kampfen zu konnen.
 Was nosh an Truppen vorhanden war, gab zu
 Siegeshoffnungen keinen AnlaB. Die antimili-
 taristische Propaganda von einst hatte sich ?gegen
 die Bolsdiewiki gekehrt. Dabei drangen von alien
 Seiten Interventionsheere in RuBland ein. Die
 Japaner waren in Wladiwostok gelandet, and die
 tschechischen Kriegsgefangenen hatten in Sibirien
 eine eigene Legion gebildet, die sick jetzt gegen
 die Sowjets erhob. Auf ihrem Marsch gegen
 Westen fand sie kaum Widerstand. Dazu spi rte
 man in Petrograd and INIoskau zunehmend die
 Tatigkeit zaristischer Agenten, die sick von dem
 Schlag, der iimen am 7. November versetzt wor-
 den war, mehr and mehr erholten.
 Am 22. April 1918 legte Trotzki dem zentralen
 Exekutivkomitee der Sowjets cinen Plan vor, nach
 dem auch ehemals zaristische Offiziere in die zu
 griindende Rote Armee eingestellt werden sollten.
 Gegen die Opposition ultralinker Kreise setzte er
 semen Willen durch, obwohl er sich der Gefahr
 bewuBt war, daB viele dieser Offiziere, die sick

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040003-3
 zur Verfugung stellten, nur mit der Absicht
 kamen, den Bolschewiki in den Ri cken zu fallen.
 Als Anfang August in Moskau die Meldung
 einlief, daft die Tschechen Kasan eingenommen
 hatten, fuhr Trotzki mit dem Zug an die Front.
 Zweieinhalb Jahre hausten er and seine engsten
 Mitarbeiter fortan in diesem fahrenden Haupt-
 quartier, das seine ureigenste Erfindung war and
 bald zur Legende wurde. Dieser gepanzerte Zug,
 den zwei Lokomotiven zogen, beforderte Autos,
 Geschiitze  samt  Granaten,  Handfeuerwaffen,
 Lebensmittel and Medikamente, eine Druckerei,
 eine Bibliothek, eine Telegrafen- and eine Radio-
 station. Trotzki war immer dort zu finden, wo es
 gefahrlich war.
 Als er bei Kassan in den vordersten Linien
 erschien, wendete sick das Blatt. Die revolutiona-
 ren Soldaten lieBen sick von ihrem Fiihrer mit-
 reif3en and traten zum Gegenangriff an. Sechs
 Wochen nachdem die Tschechen Kasan ein-
 genommen hatten, eroberte die Rote Armee these
 wichtige Stadt an der Wolga zuruck. Lenin
 schickte ein Telegramm:
 ?Mit Begeisterung begriif3e ich den herrlichen
 Sieg der Roten Armee. Er moge uns ein Wahr-
 zeichen sein, daft sie jeden Widerstand der Aus-
 beuter vernichten and den Sieg des Welt-
 sozialismus sichern wird."
 Dieser  unerwartete  Erfolg veranderte die
 Situation der Bolschewiki schlagartig. Die Tsche-
 chen and die in ihrem Schatten marschierenden
 zaristischen Einheiten begriffen, daft sie es nicht
 mehr mit ein paar rebellierenden Haufen zu tun
 hatten, sondern mit Einheiten, die nach strate-
 gischen Gesichtspunkten gefuhrt wurden. Fur die
 zaristischen Offiziere war das eine ungeheure
 C7berraschung. Wer war dieser Trotzki, der es
 fertig brachte, eine geschlagene Armee, die sich
 panikartig zuriickzog, mit neuem Angriffsgeist zu
 beseelen and zum Siege zu fiihren?
 Nach dem Zusammenbruch der Mittelmachte im
 November 1918 bildeten sick. neue Fronten. Ober-
 dies war dem jeder Intrige abholden Trotzki
 innerhalb der eigenen Partei ein Gegner er-
 wachsen, dessen Verschlagenheit anfangs niemand
 erkannte: Josef Stalin, Oberster politischer Kom-
 missar der 10. Armee unter dem Befehl des ehe-
 maligen Wachtmeisters Woroschilow. Lenin berief
 Stalin auf Wunsch Trotzkis nach Moskau zuruck,
 eine Demutigung, die dieser niemals vergessen
 sollte. Die Verleumdungskampagne gegen den
 Griinder and Organisator der Roten Armee be-
 gann in diesen Tagen: Stalin beschuldigte den
 Kriegskommissar, ein ?Freund zaristischer Gene-
 rale" zu sein.
 Als einige der eingestellten alten Offiziere als
 Verrater entlarvt wurden, holte Stalin zurn ersten
 Male zum Schlage aus. Aber Trotzki wurde nosh
 einmal gerettet, dank der Unvernunft der weiB-
 gardistischen Generale Koltschak, Denikin, Jude-
 nitsch and Krassnow, die jeder fur sich and nicht
 koordiniert gegen Moskau marschierten.  Das
 machte neue Feldzuge notig, fur die der Organi-
 sator der Roten Armee unentbehrlich war. Mit
 seinem Zug fuhr er von einer Front zur anderen,
 von der Wolga, wo Koltschak vernichtend ge-
 schlagen werden konnte, zur Sudfront, um die
 Kampfe gegen Denikin zu leiten, der ebenso be-
 siegt wurde %vie Judenitsch, der im Norden gegen
 Petrograd vorgeruckt war. An seinem 40. Geburts-
 tag, dem zweiten Jahrestag der bolschewistischen
 Machtergreifung, konnte Trotzki in Moskau den
 Sieg der Roten Armee melden.
 Fiinf Monate spater, im Marz 1920, fielen die
 Polen gemeinsam mit dern erst im Vorjahre ver-
 triebenen ukrainischen Diktator Petljura in So-
 wjetruf3land ein. Sie eroberten Kiew. Dieser neue
 Krieg nahm schnell einen nationalistischen, sogar
 religiosen Charakter an. Polen war seit Jahrhun-
 derten Ruf3lands ?Erbfeind", dazu waren die Be-
 wohner dieses 1918 wiedererstandenen Staates
 romisch-katholisch, im Gegensatz zu den grie-
 chisch-orthodoxen Russen. Viele ehemalige za-
 ristische Offiziere, die ihre Hilfe bisher verweigert
 hatten, stellten sich jetzt der Roten Armee zur
 Verfugung, um die  rechtma8ige Kirche" gegen
 die ?R6mischen" zu verteidigen.
 Trotzki eilte wiederum an die Front. Er unter-
 band, soweit es moglich war, die nationalistische
 wie antikatholische Hetze in der Armee. ?Moge
 jedern Rotarmisten die Hand abgehauen werden,
 der sein Messer gegen einen Kriegsgefangenen,
 gegen  Waffenlose,  Kranke and  Verwundete
 ziickt", schrieb er in einem Tagesbefehl. Seine
 Anwesenheit wirkte elektrisierend. Schon im Juni
 kam es zum Gegenangriff, and wenige Wochen
 spater stand die auf eine halbe Million ange-
 wachsene Rote Armee vor Warschau. Der Fall
 der polnischen Hauptstadt schien nur nosh eine
 Frage von Tagen zu sein.
 Aber da ereignete sick das vieldiskutierte
 ?Wunder an der Weichsel", Gegenstuck zu dem
 ?Wunder an der Marne" im September 1914, das
 den deutschen Vormarsch in Frankreich stoppte.
 Der von Trotzki eingesetzte Oberbefehlshaber der
 Roten Armee, General Tuchatschewski, hatte den
 im Siiden unter dem Kommando von Budjonny

 Harry Schulze-Wilde
 operierenden  roten  Einheiten  befohlen,  den
 linken.Flugel des Vorstof3es auf die polnische
 Hauptstadt abzusichern. Doch der politische Kom-
 missar dieser Heeresgruppe, Josef Stalin, der dem
 mit 26 Jahren zum General beforderten Tucha-
 tschewski die steile Karriere neidete, wollte eigene
 Lorbeeren pfli.icken. Statt sich mit den vor War-
 schau stehenden roten Einheiten zu vereinigen,
 veranlaf3te er Budjonny, gegen Lemberg vorzu-
 stoBen. Seine Einheiten sollten dort zur gleichen
 Zeit einziehen wie Tuchatschewski in der pol-
 nischen Hauptstadt.
 Der polnische Marschall Pilsudski, beraten von
 dem  aus  Frankreich  herbeigeeilten  General
 Weygand, stieB in die Lucke and rollte die auf
 Warschau vorstof3ende Armee von der Flanke
 her auf. Damit ging das schon so gut wie be-
 siegte Polen als Sieger aus dem Krieg hervor. Die
 Sowjetunion muf3te einen Frieden schlie3en, des-
 sen Bedingungen Warschau diktierte. Trotzki and
 Tuchatschewski beschuldigten in Wort and Schrift
 den Polit-Kommissar der 10. Armee, these kata-
 strophale Niederlage verursacht zu haben.
 Aus jenem Fiasko erklart sich eine ganze Reihe
 der spateren Handlungen Stalins. Er lieB nicht
 nur Tuchatschewski and Trotzki samt ihren An-
 hangern umbringen, sondern ubertrug seinen HaB
 auch auf die polnische Nation. Mit hochster
 Wahrscheinlichkeit hat er im Jahre 1940 den Be-
 fehl zur Ermordung der 14 500 polnischen Offi-
 ziere gegeben, die in sowjetische Gefangenschaft
 geraten waren. Etwa 4200 Leichen fand man im
 Walde von Katyn: die Insassen des Lagers
 Kozielsk. Die Insassen des Lagers Starobielsk,
 nahezu 4000 Mann, wurden ebenfalls ermordet.
 lhre Graber konnten bis heute noch nicht entdeckt
 werden. Die 6567 Insassen des Lagers Ostaschkow
 wurden in Archangelsk auf zwei Barken verladen,
 die im Weifien Meer versenkt wurden - wie es
 hief3, bei Artillerie-SchieBiibungen.
 Nach dem polnisch-russischen Krieg trat eine
 gewisse Beruhigung ein. Wohl kam es nosh zu
 einzelnen Erhebungen zarentreuer Generale, doch
 die Rote Armee blieb immer siegreich. Dieser fur
 die Bolschewiki erfreulichen Bilanz standen die
 furchtbaren Opfer des fast vierjahrigen Burger-
 krieges gegenuber. Nachdem die Machtergreifung
 der Sowjets im November 1917 nahezu unblutig
 verlaufen war, starben in den Kampfen der fol-
 genden Jahre fiber drei Millionen Mcnschen. Noch
 mehr Opfer, etwa funf Millionen Menschen, for-
 derte die Hungersnot in den Jahren 1921/22. Sic
 war eine Folge der durch Krieg, Revolution and
 Burgerkrieg verursaditen wirtschaftlichen Zer-
 riittung sowie von Naturkatastrophen.
 Am bittersten beriihrte Trotzki der Aufstand
 von Kronstadt. Die Matrosen der Seefestung
 revoltierten and verlangten eine Humanisierung
 der Verhaltnisse. Ihre Forderungen waren: mehr
 personliche  Freiheit,  also  Verminderung  der
 Diktatur, and Verbruderung der Volker. Unter
 den Rebellen befanden sich viele seiner einstigen
 Anhanger, die 1917 mit der BeschieBung des
 Winterpalais entscheidend zum Sieg der Bolsche-
 wiki beigetragen hatten. Aber die Partei befahl,
 ohne Rucksicht ,durchzugreifen". Am 3. April
 1921 nahm Trotzki die Siegesparade ab, unfrohen
 Herzens: Von alien militarischen Unternehmun-
 gen, die er seit 1917 geleitet hatte, war die gegen
 Kronstadt die blutigste gewesen.
 Ende 1923 erkrankte er ernstlich and muBte
 Heilung im Silden der Sowjetunion suchen. Kurz
 darauf, am 21. Januar 1924, starb Lenin. Der
 Generalsekretar der Partei, Josef Stalin, verstand
 es, den Griinder der Roten Armee von den Be-
 grabnisfcierlichkeiten fernzuhalten: Er telegra-
 fierte seinem in Tiflis weilenden Todfeind Trotzki
 einen falschen Termin. Spater behauptete Trotzki,
 Stalin habe Angst gehabt:
 ,,Er [Stalin] hatte befiirchten mussen, daB
 ich ... die Arzte nach der Moglichkeit einer
 Vergiftung befragen and eine besondere Ob-
 duktion verlangen wurde."
 Den Zuschauern fiel zwar auf, daB unter den
 filhrenden Genossen, die den Sarg Lenins trugen,
 Leo Davidowitsch Trotzki fehlte, sie dachten sich
 aber wohl nichts dabei. Doch seit diesem Tag sollte
 der Frage, ob and in welcher Reihenfolge jemand
 an offiziellen Feierlichkciten teilnahm, eine tiefe
 Bedeutung zukommen.
 Stalin ging Schritt fur Schritt vor. Systematisch
 besetzte er alle Amter mit ihm ergebenen Ge-
 nossen and isolierte damit Trotzki in der Partei
 and im Zentralkomitee. Dann wagte er es zuzu-
 schlagen. Auf dem XV. Parteitag am 2. September
 1927 brachte er eine Resolution ein, nach der alle,
 die irgendwelche oppositionellen Ansichten pro-
 pagicrten, aus der Partei ausgeschlossen werden
 sollten. Nur wer sich unterwerfen and Reue-
 erklarungen  unterschreiben wurde,  durfte  in
 Zukunft auf Nachsicht rechnen.
 Die Resolution wurde angenommen and damit
 war Trotzkis Schicksal besiegelt. Bereits aus dem
 Kreml ausquartiert, schloB ihn das Zentralkomitee
 nun auch aus der Partei aus, and am 16. Januar
 1928 ordnete Stalin an, seinen ihm geistig so iiber-

 Trotzki, der besiegte Sieger
 legenen Todfeind and dessen Anhanger getrennt
 nach Sibirien zu deportieren. Fur Trotzki hatte er
 die 4000 Kilometer von Moskau entfernte ka-
 sachische Hauptstadt Alma Ata ausgesucht. Da
 Trotzki sick weigerte, dorthin zu fahren, schlepp-
 ten Geheimpolizisten ihn and seine Familie ge-
 waltsam zum fahrplanmaBigen Zug nach Tasch-
 kent. An der Endstation wartete bereits ein
 Autobus auf die Verbannten, der sic nach Alma
 Ata brachte.
 Seine Anhanger, die in einsame Dorfer Si-
 biriens verbannt worden waren, nahmen bald
 Verbindung untereinander auf. Doch Trotzkis
 Hoffnung, einen illegalen Apparat aufbauen zu
 konnen, erftillte sich nicht. Er erkannte, daB die
 sowjetische GPU erheblich besser organisiert war
 als die alte Ochrana, die Geheimpolizei der Zaren.
 Mit seiner Ankunft in Alma Ata hatte fur
 Trotzki, seine Frau and seinen altesten Sohn
 Leon Sedow ein Leidensweg begonnen, wie die
 Geschichte nur wenige kennt. Am 9. Juni 1928
 erhielt er ein Telegramm, in dem ihm ein Freund
 den Tod seiner altesten Tochter Nina mitteilte.
 Sic hatte vielleicht gerettet werden konnen, wenn
 ihre Krankheit sachgemaf3 behandelt worden
 ware. Sogar Medikamente aus der Kreml-Apo-
 theke hatte man ihr verweigert.
 Ende des Jahres beantragte Stalin die Aus-
 weisung Trotzkis aus dem Territorium der So-
 wjetunion. Die Mitglieder des Politburos, von
 Stalin ausgesucht and gefordert, stimmten dafur
 - mit einer einzigen Ausnahme. Das AuBen-
 kommissariat erhielt den Auftrag, ein Land zu
 finden, das bereit war, dem Griinder der Roten
 Armee ein Einreisevisum zu erteilen. Bereits funf
 Tage spater eroffnete man Trotzki, daB3 er nach
 Konstantinopel ausgewiesen werde. Er weigerte
 sich, die Sowjetunion zu verlassen and verlangte,
 semen Sohn Sergej and dessen Frau and Kinder
 zu sehen.
 Zwangsweise transportierte man die Familie
 mach Odessa, wo sic am 10. Februar ein russisches
 Frachtschiff besteigen muBte. Doch Sergej and
 dessen Frau, die man in die Hafenstadt am
 Schwarzen Meer hatte reisen lassen, blieben frei-
 willig in der UdSSR. Es war ein Abschied furs
 Leben. Zwei Tage spater fuhr das Schiff in den
 Bosporus ein. Dem tiirkischen Polizeioffizier, der
 an Bord kam, uberreichte Trotzki eine Erklarung.
 ?An Kemal Pascha, President der tiirl:ischen
 Republik. Sehr geehrter Herr, am Tor von
 Konstantinopel babe ich die Ehre, Sic davon in
 Kenntnis zu setzen, dab ich these Grenze nur
 der Gewalt gehorchend iiberschreite. Ich bitte
 Sic, Herr President, meine dementsprechenden
 Gefiihle entgegenzunehmen."
 Der russische Konsul, der ebenfalls an Bord ge-
 kommen war, ubergab Trotzki 1500 Dollar, so-
 zusagen als "Anfangskapital" fdr die Grundung
 einer neuen Existenz. Aufler seinem Archiv war
 das alles, was er besal3. Er mietete sich auf der
 Insel Prinkipo ein Haus. Materielle Not litt er
 nicht. Er schrieb Aufsatze and arbeitete an einer
 Biographic sowie an einer Geschichte der russi-
 schen Revolution. Alle these Arbeiten wurden in
 zahlreiche Sprachen iibersetzt and trugen ihm
 recht beachtliche Honorare ein, mit denen er sogar
 ein Bulletin der Opposition herausgeben konnte,
 das sick mit der Zeit selber trug.
 Bald aber bekam er erneut den HaB Stalins zu
 spiiren. Plotzlich brach ein Brand in seinem Haus
 aus. Er vernichtete einen Teil des Archivs, fur
 dessen Erhaltung Trotzki mehr Sorge getragen
 hatte als fur sein eigenes Leben. Nur mit knapper
 Not konnten er and seine Familie sick retten, and
 trotz der Gefahr trug er nod Akten aus dem
 brennenden Haus. Von diesem Augenblick an
 bemuhte er sich, ein anderes Land zu finden, wo
 er sich sicherer fiihlen konnte. Doch wo immer er
 um Asyl bat, wurde er abgewiesen. Schliefilich
 erklarte sich Frankreich bereit, ihn aufzunehmen.
 Vor der Abreise erhielt er die Nachricht, daft
 sich seine zweite Tochter Sinaide am 5. Januar
 1933 in Berlin das Leben genommen hatte, and
 aus der Sowjetunion schrieb man ihm, daB seine
 beiden Schwiegersohne deportiert worden seien.
 Sic gingen in Sibirien elend zugrunde. Audi ihre
 vier Kinder verschwanden. Stalin vergafi keinen
 aus der Sippe Trotzkis, sofern das betreffende Mit-
 glied in seiner Gewalt war.
 Im Sommer 1933 verlief3 Trotzki Prinkipo. Zwei
 Jahre lebte er unter wechselnden Namen in
 Frankreich, dann muf3te er nach Norwegen, dessen
 sozialistische Regierung ihm eine Aufenthalts-
 genehmigung erteilt hatte. Kurz vor der Umsied-
 lung im Jahre 1935 erfuhr er, daB man seinen
 jiingsten Sohn Sergej and dessen Frau, die in der
 Sowjetunion zuriickgeblieben waren, verhaftet
 hatte. Er sollte niemals erfahren, wo sic and ihre
 Kinder den Tod fanden.
 In Moskau waren mach der Ermordung des
 Petrograder Parteisekretars Kirow am 1. Dezem-
 ber 1934 zahlreiche alte Bolschewiki verhaftet
 worden, die Stalin der ,Beihilfe" beschuldigte.
 Als Auftraggeber der Murder bezeichnete er
 Trotzki. In Wahrheit geschah dieses Verbrechen,
 wie Chruschtschow auf dem XX. Parteitag ent-

 hiillte, in Stalins Auftrag oder zumindest mit
 seiner Billigung. Die fadenscheinigc Beschuldi-
 gung, Trotzki habe auch seine Ermordung geplant,
 war eine Erfindung, um die norwegische Regie-
 rung unter Druck setzen zu konnen. Justizminister
 Trygve Lie, spater erster Generalsekretar der Ver-
 einten Nationen, legte Trotzki nahe, jeder ,aktu-
 ellen politischen Tatigkeit" zu entsagen: ,Id, bitte
 um Ihre Billigung, daft wir Ihre Aufenthalts-
 bedingungen einschranken, und ich bitte ferner
 um Ihr Einverstandnis, dal3 Ihre abgehende und
 ankommende Post nur auf dem offiziellen Wege
 crledigt wird."
 "Wenn Sie die Absicht haben, mich zu ver-
 haften", erwiderte Trotzki,  k6nnen Sie nicht
 verlangen, daft ich Sie dazu auch nosh autori-
 siere." Trygve Lie sudite nach cinem Kompromif3:
 ?Es gibt dock einen Zustand zwischen Verhaftung
 und volliger Freiheit." Trotzki lief3 sich auf nichts
 ein: ?Dann ziehe ich die Verhaftung vor." Er
 brauchte nicht lange zu warten. Bereits Ende Sep-
 tember 1936 internierte man ihn in einem von
 15 Polizisten streng bewachten Haus.
 Diese Maf3nahme erregte in der Weltoffentlich-
 keit gro6es Aufsehen, aber keiner der Kritiker
 war bereit, sich bei seiner Regierung dafiir ein-
 zusetzen, Trotzki Asyl zu gewahren. AuBerdem
 darf man als fast richer annehmen, daB ihm diese
 Internierung zu dem damaligen Zeitpunkt das
 Leben rettete, denn gerade in jenen Jahren brach-
 ten Stalins Murder zahlreiche Freunde Trotzkis
 um. Warum hatten sic vor ihm selber Halt machen
 sollen? Andererseits hatte die Isolierung eine tief-
 greifende Auswirkung, die am allerwenigsten
 Trotzki bewult wurde: Sie schnitt ihn von der
 Umwelt ab, und ein Politiker, der nicht mitten
 im Leben steht, wird zwangslaufig zum Sektierer.
 Der Mann, der die klassische "Barrikaden-
 Revolution" durch den generalstabsmaf3ig aus-
 gefiihrten Staatsstreich ersetzte, neigte auf einmal
 zu erstaunlichen Fehlanalysen der internationalen
 Lage, wie auch der Lage in der Sowjetunion. Wer
 heute die von den Trotzkisten in Paris in deutscher
 Sprache herausgegebene Zeitschrift Unser Worf
 -  Halbmonafszeifung   der   Infernationalen
 Kommunisten Deufschlands liest, in der auch sehr
 oft Artikel Trotzkis erschienen, muf3 sick wundern,
 wie sehr er und seine Epigonen die Verhaltnisse
 verkannten.
 Daf3 sick nicht nur die wirtschaftlichen und
 soziologischen Triebkrafte, die bisher zur Aus-
 losung einer Revolution fiihrten, grundlegend
 geandert hatten, sondern auch die Technik einer
 (erfolgreichen) Revolution, und das nicht zum
 wenigsten durch Trotzki, sahen die Trotzkisten
 nicht. Dock wie die ,Kabinettskriege" des 18. und
 19. Jahrhunderts, die durchaus nicht nur ?Klassen-
 kampfe" waren, wie Marx behauptete, durch die
 totalen oder ?Volks"-Kriege des 20. Jahrhunderts
 abgelost worden waren, so hatte der Weltkrieg
 1914/18 bewiesen, daf3 die Arbeiterschaft in fast
 alien Landern - ob zu recht oder zu unrecht,
 ist fur die Beurteilung vollig nebensachlich -
 glaubte, etwas verteidigen zu mussen: das Vater-
 land.
 Wohlgemerkt: Die Arbeiter verteidigten 1914/18
 ihr ,kapitalistisdies" und nicht irgendein soziali-
 stisches Vaterland. Inzwischen war der Acht-
 Stundentag Wirklichkeit geworden, und die all-
 mahliche Integration der sozialistischen Parteien
 in den Staat nach dem Weltkrieg hatte die ,vater-
 landslosen Gesellen" von einst, die ?Proletarier",
 zu Staatsbiirgern gemacht.Von dieserEntwicklung
 und ihrer Auswirkung nahm Trotzki offensichtlich
 keine Kenntnis; er schrieb und dachte und analy-
 sierte die Lage wie vor 1914 in semen Artikeln in
 den russischen Emigrantenzeitungen - und mit
 ihm seine Epigonen.
 Inzwischen hatte im Moskauer Gewerkschafts-
 haus der erste grof3e,,Schauprozef3" stattgefunden,
 dem nosh sechs weitere  ,dffentliche Prozesse"
 folgen sollten (und hunderte, von denen man
 kaum etwas horte). Alle Beschuldigungen, die im
 Ausland nadigepriift werden konnten, erwiesen
 sich als falsch. So wollte zum Beispiel ein Ange-
 klagter Trotzki in einem Hotel getroffen haben,
 das 20 Jahre vorher abgebrannt war. Ein anderer
 behauptete, 1932 von der Gestapo - natiirlich
 im Auftrage Trotzkis - nach RuBland geschickt
 worden zu sein. Aber die Gestapo gab es erst seit
 dem Sommer 1933. Den Vogel schof3 ein Ange-
 klagter namens Lifschutz im zweiten Prozeli ab:
 Er bezichtigte sick, in nur fiinf Jahren nicht
 weniger als 10 380 Eisenbahnanschlage organisiert
 zu haben, also taglich fiinf.
 Gegen  die Beschuldigungen,  hinter  diesen
 Sabotageakten zu stehen, hatte sick jeder vertei-
 digt. Von Trotzki aber verlangte die Regierung
 seines Asyllandes, diese wahnsinnigen Behaup-
 tungen schweigend hinzunehmen. Dazu war er
 natiirlich nicht bereit. Dock er widersprach nicht
 nur, er richtete in seinen Erwiderungen auch
 scharfe Angriffe gegen die Sowjetunion und
 gegen Stalin, die alle in der klassischen Formu-
 lierung gipfelten:
 ,,Von den zw6lf Aposteln erwies sick nur
 Judas als Verrater. Aber wenn dieser die Macht
 erlangt hatte, wurde er die anderen elf Apostel

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/06: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040003-3
 als Verrater hingestellt haben, and auch alle die
 geringeren Jiinger, deren Zahl Lukas mit sieb-
 zig angibt."
 Diese Angriffe fanden zunehmend Gehor, and
 bald war die Weltoffentlichkeit uberzeugt, daB
 von den in den sogenannten ,Schadlingsprozes-
 sen" vorgetragenen Anklagen kein einziges Wort
 stimmte. Fiir die norwegische Regierung waren
 these Enthiillungen ein Grund mehr, Trotzki nosh
 scharfer zu kontrollieren. Die unhaltbaren Zu-
 stande fanden erst ein Ende, als der President von
 Mexiko, General Lazaro Cardenas, sich bereit
 erklarte, deco Grinder der Roten Armee, dem
 Stalin die sowjetische Staatsbiirgerschaft abge-
 sprochen hatte, Asyl zu gewahren. Ein norwegi-
 scher Tanker brachte Trotzki and seine Frau um
 die Jahreswende 1936!37 nach Tampico. Von dort
 fuhr er in einem Sonderzug der mexikanischen
 Regierung nach Mexico City, wo er zunachst bei
 dem Maler Diego Rivera Unterkunft land.
 FUnf Wochen nach seiner Ankunft erhielt
 Trotzki die Nachricht, daB rein altester Sohn
 Leon Sedow, das letzte seiner vier Kinder, am
 16. Februar 1937 in einer Pariser Klinik nach einer
 gut verlaufenen Blinddarmoperation unter ge-
 heimnisvollen Umstanden plotzlich verstorben
 war. Tagelang schlossen er and Nathalie Sedowa
 sick in ihre Zimmer in dem gerade erst gemieteten
 Haus in Coyoacan ein and lief3en niemanden vor.
 Als sichTrotzki seinenMitarbeitern wieder zeigte,
 waren seine Augen gerotet and sein Bart verwil-
 dert. Er wuBte jetzt, daB er nur nosh ?ein Toter
 auf Urlaub" war, Stalin wurde noch mehr als bis-
 her bestrebt sein, ihn ermorden zu lassen.
 Kurz danach meldeten ihm seine Freunde, daB
 sick schon seit Tagen unbekannte Personen in
 der Nahe des Hauses in Coyoacan herumtrieben.
 Aber audi seine Mitarbeiter and die Sekretare
 wurden iiberwacht, wie rich bald herausstellen
 solite. Wahrscheinlich hatte man in Moskau
 erfahren, daB der amerikanische Verlag Harper
 eine Biographie Stalins aus der Feder Trotzkis
 herauszubringen gedachte, and deren Erscheinen
 sollte unter allen Umstanden verhindert werden.
 Auf Anraten der Polizei lieB Trotzki das Haus
 zu einer Art Festung ausbauen. Die Eisengitter
 wurden dutch eine dicke Betonmauer ersetzt, die
 nur einen Eingang hatte. Im Innern gab es noch
 eine zweite Mauer, die den Garten umschloB, von
 dem man in das Haus gelangte. Der erste Raum
 diente als Bibliothek and Sekretariat, hier hielten
 sick aber auch die Leibwachter auf, die jeden
 Besucher Uberprilften. Durch eine kugelsichere
 Tiire erreichte man das groBe EBzimmer, and erst
 von da aus gelangte man in das Arbeitszimmer
 Trotzkis, das mit zahlreichen Biicherregalen,
 einem groBen Arbeitstisch and einem Telefon
 ausgestattet war. In den Raumen nebenan wohnte
 er mit seiner Frau, wahrend die Mitarbeiter in
 einem Nebengebaude untergebracht waren, das
 aber unbegreiflicherweise nur einen Ausgang
 hatte.
 Trotz dieser Sicherheitsmaf3nahmen gelingt es
 den gedungenen Mordern am 24. Mai 1940 kahnpf-
 los in die Festung einzudringen. DaB Trotzki,
 seine Frau Nathalie Sedowa and der gerade aus
 Frankreich angekommene Enkel Esteban Wolkow
 den Uberfall i berleben, kommt einem Wunder
 gleich. Wer die Morder ausgesandt hat, steht
 auBer Zweifel, and Trotzki nimmt auch kein Blatt
 vor den Mund. In gleichlautenden Schreiben an
 den Generalstaatsanwalt and an den mexikani-
 schen AuBenminister stellt er unmiBverstand-
 lich fest:
 . Wahrend der letzten Jahre hat Stalin
 Hunderte meiner wirklichen oder vermeint-
 lichen Freunde erschieBen lassen. Sodann hat
 er meine gesamte Familie, mit Ausnahme von
 mir selbst, meiner Frau and eines Enkelsohnes,
 umbringen lassen. In der Schweiz lieB er Ignaz
 ReiB, einen der Chefs der GPU, durch seine
 Agenten ermorden, als er sich offentlich zu
 meinen Ideen bekannte. Diese Tatsachen wur-
 den einwandfrei durch die franzosische Polizei
 and die Schweizer Gerichtshofe festgestellt.
 Dieselben Agenten, die Ignaz Rei{ ermordeten,
 waren es auch, die meinen Sohn in Paris ver-
 folgten. Ferner erbrachen am Abend des 7. No-
 vember 1936 Agenten der GPU das wissen-
 schaftliche Institut in Paris and raubten einen
 Teil meines Archivs. Audi wurden zwei meiner
 alten Sekretare, Erwin Wolff and Rudolph
 Klement, durch GPU-Agenten ermordet; der
 erste in Spanien and der zweite in Paris. Und
 das eigentliche Ziel der ganzen Schauprozesse
 in Moskau in den Jahren 1936 and 1937 war,
 meine Auslieferung an die Sowjetunion zu
 erreithen and mich der GPU in die Hande zu
 spielen.
 Die Liste dieser and ahnlicher Verbredhen
 konnte beliebig erganzt werden. Alle zielten
 auf meine physische Vernichtung ab. Dahinter
 aber steht Stalin. Seine Waffe ist die sowje-
 tische Geheimpolizei, die in jedem Land ihre
 Agenten unterhalt - die GPU ..."
 Im weiteren Verlauf dieses Schreibens spricht
 Trotzki auch den Verdacht aus, daB die deutsche
 Gestapo mit der sowjetischen Geheimpolizei, seit
 Jul! 1934 nicht mehr GPU, sondern NKWD
 genannt, gemeinsame Sache machen konnte. Das

 ist durchaus nicht so unsinnig, wie es auf den
 ersten Blick erscheint. Im August 1939 hat Stalin
 mit Hitler.einen Pakt geschlossen, aber es liegt auf
 der Hand, daB es darnber hinaus nosh einen
 Gehcimvertrag gegeben haben muB; die Entwick-
 lung der Ereignisse and das Zusammenspiel
 bewiesen es. Sah dieser nicht veroffentlichte Ver-
 trag auch die Zusammenarbeit der beiden Staats-
 polizeien vor? Bereits bei der Liquidierung von
 Marschall  Tuchatschewski  and  rand  einem
 Dutzend weiterer hoher sowjetischer Offiziere
 haben sick der deutsche Sicherheitsdienst and der
 NKWD die Balle zugeworfen.
 Als bald darauf die sowjetischen Behorden den
 Einzug der deutschen Wehrmacht in Paris mit
 dem Beflaggen der offentlichen Gebaude Moskaus
 feiern lassen, werden Trotzkis Vermutungen noch
 glaubhafter.
 Fines allerdings ahnt nicht einmal der miB-
 trauische Trotzki: daB sein Murder bereits in dem
 so streng bewachten Haus an der Ecke Wiener
 and Morelos-StraBe verkehrt and nur noch auf
 eine giinstige Gelegenheit wartet, gedrangt von
 seinen Auftraggebern, die Tat zu vollbringen.
 Oberster Chef der ?Sonderabteilung Trotzki"
 and damit Leiter der Mordversuche gegen den
 Grunder der Roten Armee ist Dr. Gregory
 Rabinowitsch, ein Deckname, hinter dem sick der
 NKWD-General Leonid Eitingon verbirgt. In
 Amerika tritt Rabinowitsch-Eitingon als ?Repra-
 sentant des Sowjetischen Roten Kreuzes" auf, mit
 Sitz in New York. 1940 bewohnt er jedoch zeit-
 weise eine Villa in der Nahe von Trotzkis Haus.
 Aber auch hier spielt er den vornehmen Diplo-
 mates jUdischen Glaubens, der bei jeder Gelegen-
 heit seine rein humanitare Mission" betont.
 In der Offentlichkeit werden nur zwei Versuche
 bekannt, Trotzki zu ermorden, aber das beweist
 nicht, daB nicht noch andere Vorbereitungen
 laufen, denn zweifellos hat Rabinowitsch-Eitingon
 nosh etliche andere Eisen im Feuer. Nach dem
 gegluckten zweiten Anschlag kann er dann die
 noch in Bereitschaft stehenden Mordspezialisten,
 die es mit Sicherheit gibt, sofort zuri.ickziehen,
 beziehungsweise auf andere im Kreml miBliebige
 Personen ansetzen, zum Beispiel gegen General
 Krivitzki, der 1939 absprang and recht peinliche
 Enthullungen machte, die von der Weltpresse
 nachgedruckt wurden.
 Krivitzki siedelte 1940 nach New York uber, da
 er sich in Frankreich, zu dieser Zeit einem Dorado
 far NKWD-Agenten, nicht meter sicker fiihlte.
 Bald darauf findet man ihn tot in seinem Hotel-
 zimmer, hochstwahrscheinlich ein  Opfer der
 Agenten Eitingohs. Aber die sowjetische Polizei
 bedient sich auch der deutschen Gestapo and der
 Spionageabwehrorganisationen anderer Lander.
 Einige Falle sind verburgt, daB Kommunisten ihre
 eigenen Genossen der Gestapo denunzierten, da-
 mit these in ihren Konzentrationslagern fur den
 NKWD das schmutzige Geschaft der Ermordung
 besorgte. Oder man steckt miBliebige Mitglieder
 der KP ?Spezialmaterial" zu, das dann die
 anonym benachrichtigte Polizei des jeweiligen
 Landes bei einer Haussuchung findet. Eine Ver-
 urteilung wegen Spionage ist dann sicker, and das
 betreffende Opfer verschwindet fur einige Zeit in
 einem Zuchthaus.
 Die Zahl der auf dieses Weise beseitigten oppo-
 sitionellen Kommunisten geht in die Tausende,
 wenn nicht Zehntausende. Eine besonders perfide
 Moglichkeit, mil3liebige Parteimitglieder umzu-
 bringen and mit ihrem Tod gegebenenfalls nosh
 Propaganda zu machen, bot der spanisehe BUrger-
 krieg 1936/39. Stalin lieB zahlreiche Kritiker
 seiner Politik als ?Freiwillige" nach Spanien
 locken, wo sie  entweder  den  ?Heldentod"
 sterben durften oder im Hinterland als ?Agenten
 Francos" fiisiliert wurden. Die Handlanger dieser
 schmutzigen Methoden waren jedoch nicht nur
 sowjetische NKWD-Manner; auch franzosische,
 deutsche and vor allem spanische Kommunisten
 stellten sich dafiir bereitwillig zur Verfugung. Die
 bewahrtesten dieser berufsmaBigen Murder wur-
 den nach dem Zusammenbruch der republikani-
 schen Armee, teilweise auch schon friiher, in die
 Sowjetunion geholt, wo sie in besonderen Schulen
 die letzten Feinheiten ihres Gewerbes lernten.
 Wahrscheinlich befand sick unter diesen Aus-
 erwahlten auch ein spanischer  Staatsburger
 namens Ramon del Rio Mercader, der Sohn der
 spanischen NKWD-Agentin Caridad Mercader.
 Er wurde am 7. Februar 1914 in Barcelona ge-
 boren. Als seine Mutter 1925 ihren Mann del Rio
 verlieB, nahm sie ihre Kinder, auiier Ramon noch
 drei Sohne and eine Tochter, mit. Zuerst ging
 sie nach - Toulouse, spi ter nach Bordeaux and
 Paris. Wovon sie damals lebte, konnte nicht
 geklart werden. Sicker ist nur, daB sie zu jener
 Zeit noch nicht im Dienste des NKWD stand.
 Wahrscheinlich trat sie erst in Frankreich der KPF
 bei. Fur den NKWD diirfte sie von einem fran-
 zosischen Fliegeroffizier, mit dem sie intime
 Beziehungen unterhielt, angeworben worden sein.
 Nach seiner Schulentlassung besuchte Ramon
 del Rio Mercader eine Hotelfachschule in Lyon,
 aber schon nach einem Jahr kehrte der Fiinfzehn-

 jahrige nach Barcelona zuriick. Die ihm von der
 Mutter anerzogene kommunistische Gesinnung
 hinderte ihn nicht daran, in vornehmen Hotels
 den ?Kapitalisten" zu dienen and sick deren
 Lebensgewohnheiten anzueignen. Spater kam ihm
 das zugute, als er behauptete, der Sohn eines
 schwerreichen Belgiers zu sein. Sein tadelloses
 Benehmen wurde von alien als Beweis angesehen.
 Von 1932 his 1934 diente er in der spanischen
 Armee, and erst wahrend dieser Jahre wurde er
 ein aktiver Kommunist. Zweifellos trug  die
 Mutter erheblich dazu bei, die inzwischen -
 hochstwahrscheinlich im Auftrage des NKWD -
 nach Spanien zuruckgekehrt war. Doch die poli-
 tischen Verhaltnisse ddrften das entscheidende
 Engagement Ramon del Rio Mercaders bewirkt
 haben.
 Nachdem in den Wahlen des Jahre 193.1 die
 Linken gesiegt hatten, kam es zu Aufstanden der
 durch die Latifundienwirtschaft verelendeten Land-
 arbeiter. Bei den Neuwahlen 1933 siegten die
 Reditsparteien unter Fuhrung von Gil Robles
 von der katholischen ?Action Popular". Die Reak-
 tion feierte noch einmal Triumphe. Wer von der
 Linken nicht mit den Gefangnissen Bekanntschaft
 machen wollte, muBte sick tarnen. Der junge
 Ramon erhielt 1935 den Auftrag, in Barcelona
 einen Kiinstlerklub Cervantes" zu griinden, eine
 illegale Partei- and Propagandazelle der Kommu-
 nisten. Die Sadie flog schnell auf, and Mercader
 muBte fur einige Monate ins Gefangnis.
 Was ihm bisher im politischen Kampf an Erfah-
 rung and Harte gefehlt hatte, wurde ihm jetzt von
 den anderen politischen Gefangenen beigebracht.
 Nach den Wahlen 1936, die wieder einen Links-
 ruck brach.ten, vorzeitig befreit, trat er der
 kommunistischen Miliz bei, felt entschlossen, es
 den Reaktionaren ,heimzuzahlen". Im bald dar-
 auf ausbrechenden Burgerkrieg wurde er zum
 Politischen Kommissar im Range eines Leutnants
 bei der 27. Division an der Aragon-Front ernannt.
 Angehorige dieser militarischen Einheit erinnerten
 sick spater seiner Skrupellosigkeit. Er glich darin
 seiner Mutter, die als ein von fanatischem HaB
 gegeniiber alien Gegnern Stalins erfiilltes ?Flinten-
 weib" geschildert wurde.
 Ob sic ihren Sohn Ramon mit den hochsten
 Funktionaren des NKWD in Spanien in Ver-
 bindung brachte, oder ob these von sich aus auf
 den jungen Mann aufmerksam wurden, ist nicht
 bekannt. Sicher aber ist, daB er spatestens im
 Jahre  1937 zum engsten Mitarbeiterstab des
 NKWD gehorte. Er hatte damit seine ?Aufgabe"
 gefunden and fuhrte das Leben eines Komintern-
 agenten, dem unbeschrankte Geldmittel zur Ver-
 fiigung standen.
 Systematisch von seinen Vorgesetzten zu diesem
 ?siiBen politischen Leben" erzogen, kam er nicht
 mehr davon los, denn dem NKWD zu dienen,
 bedeutete fur ihn Wohlstand and Macht. Als
 NKWD-Mann konnte er ihm unbequeme Men-
 schen  verschwinden  lassen. Ein Wink,  eine
 anonyme Anzeige geniigte.
 Bald hielten ihn seine Befehlshaber fur reif,
 eine groBe Aufgabe zu erfiillen - die groBte,
 die der NKWD gegen Ende der dreiBiger Jahre
 zu vergeben hatte. Zunachst schickte man ihn im
 Frdhjahr 1938 nach Paris, mit dem Befehl, sick
 als Sohn  eines miilionenschweren belgischen
 Diplomaten auszugeben. Mit Geld brauchte er
 nicht zu geizen, and auBer der iiblichen Spitzel-
 tatigkeit verlangte man von ihm nur eines: Er
 sollte mit einer gewissen Amerikanerin, die nicht
 gerade eine Schonheit and noch dazu einige Jahre
 alter war als er, intime Beziehungen aufnehmen
 and den feurigen Liebhaber spielen.
 Diese Amerikanerin namens Sylvia Ageloff,
 eine uberzeugte Trotzkistin, war als praktische
 Psychologin im Amt fur Schule and Erziehung
 der Stadt New York tatig gewesen. Ihre ,Freun-
 din"  Ruby Weil,  die Sekretarin von Louis
 Budenz,  des  damaligen  Chefredakteurs  des
 kommunistischen Zentralorgans der USA Daily
 Worker, hatte sic nach Paris gelockt. Budenz, der
 spater zum Katholizismus iibertrat, hat in einem
 Bekenntnisbuch Mitteilungen gemacht, mit deren
 Hilfe sick das teuflische Spiel, dessen Inspirator
 zweifellos Rabinowitsch-Eitingon war, einwand-
 frei rekonstruieren lieB.
 Ruby Weil vermittelte im Juni 1938 in Paris
 auch die, naturlich rein ,zufallige", Bekanntschaft
 Sylvias mit Ramon del Rio Mercader, der sich jetzt
 Jacques Mornard-Vandendreschd nannte and be-
 hauptete, der in Teheran geborene Sohn eines
 belgischen Diplomaten zu sein. Als Geburtsjahr
 gab er, um alter als Sylvia zu erscheinen, 1904 an.
 Tatsachlich existierte ein Jacques Mornard, der
 aber 1908 in Teheran zur Welt gekommen war
 and dessen Mutter den Maddiennamen Vanden-
 driessche fuhrte. Ob dieser echte Mornard von
 dem Doppelspiel Mercaders wuBte, konnte bisher
 nicht geklart werden.
 Sylvia Ageloff verfiel dem neuen Bekannten
 mit den guten Manieren, der so uberzeugend
 sagen konnte: ?Ich Liebe dick", ganz wie es Rabi-
 nowitsch-Eitingon berechnet hatte. Die 27jahrige
 Amerikanerin, bisher in Liebesdingen nicht gerade
 verwohnt, vermochte jedenfalls nicht zu erkennen,

 Harry Schulze-Wilde
 wen sie vor sick hatte, obwohl ihr mit der Zeit
 manches hatte auffallen, manches sie zur Vorsicht
 hatte mahnen mussen.
 Beispielsweise verschwand Mornard im Juli 1938
 fur einige Wochen aus Paris. In einem Brief aus
 Brussel teilte er Sylvia mit, seine Mutter habe bei
 einem Autounfall schwere Verletzungen erlitten,
 wahrend sein Vater mit dem Schrecken davon-
 gekommen sei. Als Sylvia ebenfalls nach Brussel
 fuhr, war ihr Freund unter der angegebenen
 Adresse nicht aufzufinden. Zuriickgekehrt nach
 Paris, erklart er ihr, er habe plotzlich nach Eng-
 land verreisen mussen, wahrend er wahrscheinlich
 nur Urlaub von ihr nehmen wollte oder sich mit
 Eitingon treffen muf3te. Er versuchte auch, sie zu
 korrumpieren. Eines Tages erbot er sich, laufend
 Artikel von ihr an eine ?Argus-Verlags-Gesell-
 schaft" zu verkaufen. Sylvia schrieb jede Woche
 einen Beitrag, der angeblich gedruckt wurde, aber
 nie erhielt sie Belegexemplare.
 Doch the Liebe machte sogar diese uberzeugte
 Trotzkistin blind. Sie glaubte ihrem Freund, mit
 dem sie in einem eheahnlichen Verhaltnis lebte
 and der so aufinerksam war, jedes Wort. Abend
 fur Abend holte er sie mit seinem pomposen Auto
 ab, selbst als sie im September an der streng
 konspirativen Grundungsversammlung der IV. In-
 ternationale teilnahm, fur die Trotzki den Auf-
 ruf geschrieben and die er seit 1934 vorbereitet
 hatte. Aber selbst wenn sie vorsichtiger gewesen
 ware - der NKWD hatte auch ohne sie genau
 gewuf3t, was vorging. Einer der Vertrautesten des
 ermordeten Leon Sedow, nunmehr der Vertreter
 Trotzkis  in  Paris, der sowjetische Emigrant
 polnisch-ukrainischer Abkunft Mark Sborotvski,
 Student der Medizin, war ein Spitzel Moskaus.
 Deshalb konnte  Eitingon  seinen  Agenten
 Mornard anweisen, keinerlei Versuch zu machen,
 der Konferenz beizuwohnen oder durch Fragen
 etwas dariiber in Erfahrung zu bringen. Nur
 Sylvia Ageloff, die ihm unrettbar verfallen war,
 nicht zum wenigsten gerade wegen des offensicht-
 lichen Desinteressements ihres Freundes, durfte er
 abholen. Im Fruhjahr 1939 ging Eitingon einen
 Schritt weiter. Mornard muBte seiner Verlobten
 eroffnen, daB ihm eine belgische Zeitung den
 Posten cines Korrespondenten in den USA an-
 geboten hatte. Deshalb schlage er Sylvia vor,
 zuruck nach New York zu gehen and dort auf
 ihn zu warten, denn er werde bald nachkommen.
 Doch erst im September, nach Ausbruch des
 Zweiten Weltkrieges, tauchte cr bei ihr auf.
 Zu ihrer Oberraschung nannte er sich jetzt
 Frank Jacson. Auf ihre Frage, wieso er plotzlich
 Besitzer cines kanadischen Passes sei, erklarte er,
 als belgischer Staatsbdrger hatte man ihn nicht
 einreisen  lassen, deshalb  habe  er  sich  fur
 3600 Dollar einen falschen PaB gekauft, um bei
 ihr sein zu konnen. Spater stellte man an Band
 der Nummer 31377 fest, daB dieser Pali am
 22. Marz   1937 dem  Kanadier Tony      Babich,
 geboren am 13. Juni 1905 in Lovinac in Jugo-
 slawien and im Sommer 1937 im spanischen
 Burgerkrieg gefallen, ausgehandigt wordcn war.
 DerNKWD,der alle Papiere der ?Internationalen
 Brigade" verwaltete, lieB diesen PaB falschen.
 Dabei vergaB der zustandige Spezialist offenbar,
 bei dem Namen Jackson das ?k" einzufugen.
 Im Oktober 1939 reiste ?Jacson" mit dem
 frisierten Pall nach Mexico City. Von dort schrieb
 er Sylvia, er fiihle sich einsam and sehne sick nach
 ihrer Gesellschaft. Flugs nahm sie einen drei-
 monatigen Urlaub and folgte ihrem Verlobten,
 der damit seinem Ziel ein groBes Stuck naher
 kam, dean Sylvia besuchte naturlich auch ihre
 Schwester, die bei Trotzki als Sekretarin arbeitete.
 Voller Stolz stellte sie ihren Brautigam vor, der
 auf die  Schwester wegen seines vollendeten
 Benehmens groBen Eindruck machte. Die Briicke
 zu dem Haus in Coyoacan war geschlagen, nun-
 mehr hieB es nur nosh Geduld zu haben.
 Jacson hatte sie. Er iiberstiirzte nichts, denn
 noch hatte er Trotzki selber nicht kennengelernt.
 Aber these hervorragende, psychologisch bis ins
 letzte durchdachte Taktik des Morders seinen
 eigenen Oberlegungen zuzuschreiben ware falsch.
 Die Plane stammten mit Sicherheit von dem im
 Einfadeln solcher Intrigen viel erfahreneren
 Dr. Rabinowitsch alias General Eitingon. Er war
 es, der mit den Gefiihlen der unglucklichen Sylvia
 Ageloff so raffiniert zu spielen verstand and der
 auch nach dem Attentat vom 24. Mai 1940 alle
 Schritte Jacsons lenkte.
 Am 27. Februar 1940 anderte Trotzki sein
 Testament, als ahnte er, daB seine Tage gezahlt
 waren. Die Passagen, die von seiner Frau Nathalie
 Sedowa sprechen, zeugen von groi3er Zartheit
 des Gefiihls:
 ,,Zu dem Gluck, ein Kampfer fur den Sozialis-
 mus zu sein, gab mir das Schicksal das Gluck,
 ihr Mann sein zu diirfen. In den nunmehr fast
 vierzig Jahren unscres gemeinsamen Lebens-
 weges blieb sie eine unerschopfliche Quelle der
 Liebe,  der GroBmut and  Zartlichkeit. Sic
 erduldete grof3e Leiden ... Aber ich empfinde
 doch Erleichterung bei dem Gedanken, daB sie

 Da der Oberfall vom 24. Mai 1940 auf das Haus
 an der Ecke Wiener and Morelos-Stra13e sein Ziel
 verfehlt hat, bringt Eitingon nunmehr semen
 zweiten Bauern, Frank Jacson, ins Spiel, dem es
 inzwischen  gelungen  ist,  ohne  selbst  darum
 ersucht zu haben, in die Festung eingelassen zu
 werden. Zwar hat er Sylvia Ageloff, die im Marz
 nach New York zurUckfuhr, ehrenwortlich ver-
 sprochen, dieses Haus ohne sie nicht zu betreten,
 aber da das Ehepaar Rosmer, das den Enkel
 Esteban nach Coyoacan brachte, Jacson eines
 Tages urn einige Gefalligkeiten bat, ergab sich
 dessen Besuch in Coyoacan von selbst.
 Spater nehmen die Rosmers, mit den Trotzkis
 seit Jahrzehnten eng befreundet, Jacson Ange-
 bot, sie mit seinem Auto zum Schiff zu bringen,
 mit dem sie Mexiko verlassen wollen, erfreut an.
 Vier Tage nach dem ersten Attentat, am 28. Mai
 1940, fahrt er vor dem Haus in Coyoacan vor. Da
 die Eheleute nosh beim Fri hstiick sind, wird er
 aufgefordert, mit am Tisch Platz zu nehmen. Bei
 dieser Gelegenheit begegnet er Trotzki zum ersten
 Male. In einem Brief an Sylvia teilt Jacson seiner
 Verlobten  mit,  warum  er sein Versprechen
 gebrochen habe. Diese Korrektheit wirkt sich
 natiirlich. positiv fur ihn aus.
 Nach seiner Rilckkehr aus Veracruz drangt er
 sich klugerweise nicht danach, dem ?groBen
 Alten" sofort wieder zu begegnen. Er macht sich
 rar, wie die Eintragungen im Wachbuch, das die
 Sekretare mit minutioser Genauigkeit fi hren,
 beweisen. Erst am 12. Juni taucht er wieder in
 Coyoacan auf, um mitzuteilen, daB er nach New
 York fahre and sein Auto inzwischen den Wacht-
 posten zur freien Benutzung iiberlasse. Audi das
 spricht sehr fur ihn, um so mehr als er sick, von
 einem der Wachter zum Flugzeug begleiten lai3t.
 In New York erhalt er die letzten Anweisungen,
 and bei der Systematik, mit der Leonid Eitingon
 vorgeht, dart man als sicker voraussetzen, daB
 auch verschiedene ,Generalproben" gemacht wer-
 den. Jacson ist sick der Gefahrlidikeit des Unter-
 nehmens wohl bewuBt, and schon deswegen
 mussen alle Moglichkeiten, die sick ergeben
 konnen, grundlich erortert werden. Nach seiner
 Ri ckkehr schlagt er Trotzki vor, ihn bei einer
 Bergtour zu begleiten. Er empfiehlt sich als
 gei bter uhd versierter Bergsteiger, dock da man
 nitht sofort darauf eingeht, kommt Jacson nicht
 mehr darauf zuri ck. Er ist zu vorsichtig, um etwas
 zu forcieren.
 Auch die verschiedenen Waffen, die man spater
 bei ihm findet, deuten darauf hin, daB alle mog-
 lichen Totungsarten erwogen wurden. In seiner
 rechten Manteltasche tragt er einen 35 cm langen
 and 3 cm breiten Dolch mit sick, als zweite Waffe
 eine mit acht Patronen geladene Pistole Kali-
 ber 0,45. Das Tatwerkzeug, einen Eispickel, hat er
 aber weder in New York noch in Frankreich
 gekauft, wie er spater behauptet, er entwendete
 ihn wahrscheinlich bereits im April dem Besitzer
 eines Touristenhotels, in dem er vor seiner New
 Yorker Reise einige Zeit wohnte.
 Das Wachbuch notiert seinen langsten Besuch
 am 29. Juli 1940: von 14.40 Uhr bis 15.50 Uhr.
 An diesem Tage haben Trotzki and dessen Frau
 ihn and seine Verlobte, die ihren Jahresurlaub in
 Mexiko verbringt, zum Tee eingeladen. Am
 8. August ist er wieder im Hause and bleibt etwas
 fiber eine Stunde. Die ?Generalprobe" fur den
 Mord findet bei diesem elften Besuch statt. Er
 erklart, einen Artikel geschrieben zu haben, um
 dessen Begutachtung er bitte. Wahrend Trotzki
 liest, setzt sich Jacson auf einen Tisch hinter des-
 sen Stuhl, ein Umstand, den der Gastgeber als
 unangenehm empfindet.
 Hinterher sagt Trotzki seiner Frau, dai3 er
 diesen merkwurdigen jungen Mann nicht mehr
 zu sehen wunsche; auBerdem sei ihm aufgefallen,
 daft Jacson die ganze Zeit fiber den Hut auf
 dem Kopf behielt and seinen Mantel fest an sich
 pref3te. Das hatte, wie sich spater herausstellte,
 seinen guten Gri nde, dean schon an diesem Tage
 trug er den gestohlenen Eispickel and die anderen
 Waffen bei sich. Trotzki ahnte davon natUrlich
 nichts, aber er hatte ein ungutes Gefiihl, wie von
 einer drohenden Gefahr.
 Vielleicht wollte Jacson bereits das Attentat an
 diesem Samstag ausfiihren, and es gebrach ihm
 nur an Mut. Gewisse Anzeichen lassen jedenfalls
 den Schluf3 zu, daB er sich, trotz aller Skrupel-
 losigkeit, innerlich bis zuletzt dagegen wehrte,
 zum Murder zu werden. So fallt in den letzten
 Tagen vor dem Anschlag nicht nur Sylvia Ageloff
 das Aussehen ihres Verlobten auf, auch Trotzki
 and dessen Frau wundern sick fiber sein fahriges
 Wesen, das gegeni ber seiner fri heren souveranen
 Ruhe sehr unvorteilhaft wirkt.
 Der 20. August beginnt fur Trotzki recht ange-
 nehm. Es herrscht strahlendes Wetter, and er
 fuhlt rich wohler als vorher. Als er um sieben
 Uhr aufsteht, begriif3t er seine Frau mit den
 fatalistischen Worten: ,Sic haben uns these Nacht
 wieder nicht umgebracht. Und ich habe mich
 schon lange nicht so wohl gefuhlt wie heute."
 Auch die Morgenpost ist erfreulich. Trotzki erhalt
 die Nachricht, sein Archiv sei in der Harvard-

 Universitat angekommen, ohne da13 irgendwelche
 Gehcimdienste versucht hatten, sich einzuschalten.
 Nachdem er seine Akten and sonstigen Unter-
 lagen der Universitat nur unter der Bedingung
 iiberlassen hatte, daf3 ein Teil des Archivs bis
 zum Jahre 1980 unzuganglich bleiben solle, war
 ein Gewaltakt zu erwarten gewesen.
 Den Vormittag uber spricht er einen Artikel in
 das Diktaphon. Um 13 Uhr empfangt er semen
 amerikanischen Anwalt, der ihm rat, gegen be-
 stimmte Verleumdungen vorzugehen. Nadi einer
 Ruhepause sitztTrotzki wieder an seinemSchreib-
 tisch. Kurz nach 17 Uhr geht er, wie jeden Tag,
 zu den Stallen im Hof, um die Kaninchen and die
 Hiihner zu fiittern. Die Pflege der Tiere ist ihm
 willkommener Ersatz fur die Spaziergange and
 grof3eren Wanderungen in der Umgebung oder
 in die Berge, die er aus Sicherheitsgriinden hat
 aufgeben mussen.
 Als Nathalie Sedowa in den Garten hinunter-
 blickt, sieht sie neben ihrein Mann den jungen
 Jacson stehen. Wiederum fallt ihr sein nervoses
 Benehmen auf. Er hat die Gesichtsfarbe eines See-
 kranken. Jacson griif3t sie betont zuvorkommend
 and ruft ihr zu:  ,Ich bin schrecklich durstig.
 Konnte ich wohi ein Glas Wasser haben?" Sic
 bietet ihm Tee an, aber er antwortet: ?Nein,
 ich habe zu spat gegessen and das Essen will
 nicht recht rutschen. Es wurgt mich im Hals."
 Spater entschuldigt er seine Freundin Sylvia, daf3
 sic noch nicht da sei. Aber sic werde jeden Augen-
 blick kommen, um sick zu verabschieden, fugt er
 hinzu, denn morgen wurden beide nach New
 York abreisen.
 In Wirklichkeit hat er sic listig ferngehalten. Sie
 wartet, wie verabredet, im Hotel auf ihn, and da
 er ganz gegen seine Gewohnheit unpiinktlich ist,
 wird sic von Minute zu Minute unruhiger. Un-
 erklarliche Angst hat sic befallen. Sic telefoniert
 mit dem Hotel, in dem sic beide wohnen, doch
 dort weiB man nichts. Zur selben Zeit spricht
 Jacson bereits mit Trotzki and zeigt ihm einige
 maschinengeschriebene Matter: den schon vor drei
 Tagen vorgelegten, jetzt umgearbeiteten Artikel.
 Forschend betrachtet der alte Mann den Besucher,
 and als er bemerkt, daft Jacson recht schledit
 aussieht, sagt er mitfuhlend: ?Sic scheinen krank
 zu sein. Ihr Aussehen gefallt mir gar nicht. Sic
 mussen mehr auf Ihre Gesundheit achtenl"
 Langsam die Handschuhe abstreifend, die er
 beim Futtern der Haustiere zu tragen pflegt, geht
 Trotzki in sein Arbeitszimmer. Jacson folgt ihm.
 Zwei oder drei Minuten spater, kurz vor 18 Uhr,
 hurt Nathalie Sedowa einen furchtbaren Schrci.
 Sic lauft nach drauien - ihr Mann liegt blut-
 iiberstrimt an der Balkontiir im EBzimmer.
 ?Jacson", stohnt Trotzki, and gleich darauf:
 ,,Natascha, ich habe dick so lieb." WVahrend sic
 sich um ihren schwerverletzten Mann kiimmert,
 dringen aus dem Arbeitszimmer Schreie. Die
 Wachter schlagen mit Pistolengriffen auf den
 Attentater ein. Er versucht sick zu wehren and
 wimmert: ?Sic haben mich in ihren Harden, sic
 haben meine Mutter eingesperrt ... Sylvia hat
 nichts damit zu tun ..."
 Trotzki versteht, trotz der todlichen Kopfwunde,
 was Jacson sagt and bittet einen der Leibwachter:
 ?Nein, nein, man soil ihn nicht toten - er muB
 zum Sprechen gebracht werden!" Die Wachter
 lassen von dem Attentater ab, der sich schon
 wieder in der Gewalt hat. Der Polizel, die wenige
 Minuten nach 18 Uhr eintrifft, i.ibergibt er einen
 Brief; Personalpapiere and sonstige Hinweise auf
 seine Identitat besitzt er nicht, er will sic vorher
 vernichtet haben. Der Brief, in franzosischer
 Sprache abgefaBt, ist wahrscheinlich schon vor
 Tagen mit der Maschine geschrieben worden; das
 Datum wurde mit Bleistift eingetragen, ebenso die
 Unterschrift ?Jac".
 Jacson erklarte darin zunachst, er gehore einer
 alten belgischen Familie an and sei von einem
 Bekannten fur die IV. Internationale angeworben
 and veranlaflt worden, nach Mexiko zu fahren.
 Er fahrt fort:
 Nach einigen Unterhaltungen sagte er
 [Trotzki] mir endlich klipp and klar, was man
 von mir wollte. In diesem Augenblick waren
 meine Illusionen verflogen, and ich fiihlte
 grof3tes Mif3trauen dem Manne gegenuber, an
 den ich bis jetzt geglaubt hatte.
 Ich sollte nach Ruf3land gehen and dort eine
 Reihe von Attentaten gegen verschiedene Per-
 sonen and an erster Stelle gegen Stalin organi-
 sicren. Das widersprach.jeglichen Prinzipien des
 Kampfcs, der bis jetzt offen and ehrlich gewesen
 war, and zerstorte all' meinen Glauben. Trotz-
 dem sagte ich nicht zu, denn ich woilte wissen,
 wieweft die niedrige Gesinnung and der Haf3
 dieses Manner gehen wiirden..."
 Das ist die Strategic des NKWD. Wahrschein-
 lich hat Eitingon diesen Brief geschrieben, als
 Jacson in New York war. Der General beging
 dabei aber den Fehler, die Uberredungszeiten zu
 niedrig anzusetzen, vielleicht wcil er falsch in-
 formiert war, vielleicht auch, Weil er nicht wuf3te,
 daf3 Uber jeden Besucher genau Buch gefuhrt
 wurde. Elfmal war Jacson in Cayoacan, insgesamt
 4 Stunden and 27 Minuten. In dieser Zeit sprach
 er mit Trotzki unter vier Augen hochstens 15 Mi-

 nuten. So schnell wird man aber mit einem Men-
 schen vertraut genug, um ihm derartige Angebote
 zu machen. AuBerdem paBt alles zu gut in das von
 Moskau verbreitete Bild der Schauprozesse".
 Bei der Vernehmung erklart Jacson iiberdies,
 Trotzki habe im Dienste des ,amerikanischen
 Imperialismus" gestanden, sei also von der Regie-
 rung in Washington bezahlt worden. 1940 unter-
 halt die Sowjetunion noch freundschaftliche Be-
 ziehungen zu Hitlerdeutschland. Im ProzeB aber,
 der erst drei Jahre spater stattfindet, ist Trotzki
 kein "amerikanischer Agent" mehr, sondern ?ein
 faschistischer Bluthund" im Solde der Gestapo,
 denn Hitler fuhrt inzwischen gegen die Sowjet-
 union Krieg and Moskau hat rich mit den einst
 geschmahten ?amerikanischen Plutokraten" ver-
 biindet.
 Uber den Hergang der Tat gibt Jacson zu
 Protokoll :
 . Nach meinen Gesprachen mit Trotzki
 hegte ich einen unsagbaren HaB gegen ihn. Es
 wurde mir klar, daft ich einer von denjenigen
 war, die er Fur seine personlichen Vorteile miB-
 braucht hatte, denn ohne jegliche Gewissens-
 bisse zwang er seine Anhanger, sich fur seine
 eigenen Interessen aufzuopfern. Deshalb be-
 schlofi ich, ihn zu toten, and erst Selbstmord zu
 begehen, wenn er nicht mehr weiterlebte.
 Am Tage des Attentats kam ich gegen halb
 sieben in sein Haus. Harold offnete mir die Ti r.
 Im Hof traf ich verschiedene Sekretare von
 Trotzki. Sie sagten etwas zu mir, was ich aber
 nicht verstand. Ich fragte Harold, ob Sylvia dort
 sei, denn sie hatte geauBert, daB sie den Alten
 aufsuchen wollte. Aber er verneinte. Ich sagte:
 ,Dann wird sie wohl spater noch kommen.'
 Ich fand Trotzki bei der Futterung seiner
 Kaninchen ... Dann ... bat er mich in sein
 Arbeitszimmer. Dort nahm er meine Papiere
 and setzte sich in seinen Stuhl vor dem Schreib-
 fisch. Ich stand links von ihm and er kehrte mir
 den Riicken zu. Er war keineswegs miBtrauisch.
 Ids legte meinen Mantel, in dessen rechter
 Ecke der Dolch eingenaht war and in dessen
 linker Seite sich der Eispickel befand, auf
 irgendein Mobelstiick - ich weiB nicht mehr
 worauf. Ich weiB nur, daft es an der Ostseite
 des Raumes hinter Trotzki war. Wahrend er
 den Artikel las, nahm ich den Eispickel aus
 meinem Regenmantel, schloB die Augen and
 schlug ihm auf den Kopf. Ich schlug nur einmal
 zu. Er stieB einen gellenden Schrei aus, warf
 rich gleichzeitig auf mich and biB mich in die
 linke Hand. Sie kornen jetzt noch die Druck-
 stellen sehen. Dann stolperte er zuriick. Nach
 dem Schrei tauchte zuerst Harold auf, der mich
 mit der Pistole bearbeitete, dann Charles and
 Hansen. Ich war schon durch die Tat betaubt
 and machte keinerlei Versuch zu fliehen. Ob
 sonst noch jemand das Zimmer betrat, weiB ich
 nicht mehr. Spater kam die Polizei and brachte
 mich hierher ..."
 Der belgische Konsul, der ihm gegenubergestellt
 wird, bezweifelt die Angaben Jacsons, daft er in
 Wirklichkeit  Mornard-Vandendreschd   heiBe.
 Einen Diplomaten dieses Namens gibt es nicht,
 so wie es in Dixmuiden keine Militarakademie
 and in Briissel kein Jesuitenkolleg gibt, die der
 Morder besucht haben will. Aber Jacson-Mornard
 bleibt bei seiner Behauptung. Oberpruft werden
 kann sie nicht, denn in dem von Deutschland be-
 setzten Belgien sind Nachforschungen nicht mog-
 lich. Nur die diplomatischen Jahrbii.cher liegen
 vor. Erst nach Jahren kommt man auf die richtige
 Spur, als man, dank entsprechender Hinweise, die
 Fingerabdriicke Ramon del Rio Mercaders findet,
 der 1936 in Barcelona wegen kommunistischer
 Agitation zu einer Gefangnisstrafe verurteilt
 worden war. Ein Vergleich mit denen Jacson-
 Mornards beweist einwandfrei die Identitat.
 Audi seine in scheinbarer Todesangst heraus-
 geschriene Behauptung, man habe ihn erpreBt,
 Weil man seine Mutter festgesetzt habe, erweist
 sich Jahre danach als frei erfunden. Zur Stunde
 des Attentats wartete sie, zusammen snit ihrem
 Freund Eitingon, 500 Meter entfernt von Trotzkis
 Haus auf ihren Sohn, in der Hoffnung, daB es
 ihm gelingen werde, nach dem Mord zu entkom-
 men. Audi fiber die Vorbereitungen war sie genau
 informiert. Dem spanischen Parteigenossen Jesus
 Hernandez, wahrend des Burgerkrieges Justiz-
 minister (er sagte sick 1950 von den Kommuuisten,
 los), erzahlte Caridad Mercader spater, daB sie
 wahrend ihrer Besuche in der Sowjetunion direkt
 mit  Stalin and Berija uber die Ermordung
 Trotzkis verhandelt habe.
 Nach der Tat verleiht man ihr and ihrem Sohn
 den Leninorden, eine der hodisten sowjetischen
 Auszeichnungen. Wahrend des Krieges nach Ufa
 evakuiert and dort im Prominentenhotel ?Basch-
 kirija" untergebracht, wohnt sie von 1943 bis
 zu ihrer Ausreise im Jahre 1944 im Moskauer
 ;,Lux", zusammen mit anderen KominterngroBen.
 Mit falschen Passen versehen, lebt sie vom Ok-
 tober 1944 bis November 1945 in Mexiko, wo
 sie Fuhlung mit der Kommunistin Dr. Esther
 Chapa aufnimmt, die bis 1947 ?Chef der Gefang-
 nisdelegation zur Vorbeugung von Verbrechen"
 ist. Ausgerechnet den Morder Trotzkis ernennt
 sie zu ihrem Vertreter im Zuchthaus, in dem er

 Harry Schulze-Wilde
 seine Strafe absitzt, das heif3t, Jacson kann sich
 innerhalb der Gebaude Frei bewegen and hat kraft
 seines ,Amtes" groBen Einflufi auf die Warter
 and Gefangenen.
 Ob Caridad Mercader bei ihrem zweiten Auf-
 enthalt in Mexiko hoffte, noch einmal eine Flucht-
 moglichkeit fur ihren Sohn vorbereiten zu konnen,
 wie Eitingon von New York aus schon vor dem
 Prozef3 im Jahre 1943, ist unbekannt, aber
 manches spricht dafdr. Als man sich das erste Mal
 fur seine Flucht einsetzte, machte Jacson-Mornard
 nicht mit. Er hatte dafi r seine guten Griinde. Das
 Beispiel anderer NKWD-Agenten schreckte. Im
 Gefangnis war er zu Stalins Lebzeiten sicherer.
 Schon wenige Minuten nach dem Attentat
 haben sich vor dem Hause Trotzkis Hunderte von
 Menschen versammelt. Reporter sind gekommen,
 and mit der Polizei ist auch ein Krankenwagen
 eingetroffen. Doch die Sekretare verweigern den
 Abtransport ihres Chefs, solange nicht der Poli-
 zeigeneral Jose Manuel Nuiiuz zugegen ist. Sie
 befiirchten, weitere Mordschergen konnten den
 Transport iiberfallen and den Schwerverletzten
 toten. Noch hoffen sie auf Trotzkis Rettung. Erst
 nachdem Trotzki ins Krankenhaus gefahren wor-
 den ist, wird auch der von Sekretaren halbtot
 geschlagene Attentater abtransportiert. Der Zufall
 will es, daft man ihn in dem Zimmer neben dem
 seines Opfers unterbringt.
 Zwei Stunden nach dem Anschlag liegt der
 schwerverletzte Trotzki, der inzwischen das Be-
 wuf3tsein verloren hat, auf dem Operationstisch.
 Die Arzte erkennen, dali sein Zustand hoffnungs-
 los ist. Dennoch versuchen sie, ihn zu retten, aber
 es ist alles vergebens. Am 21. August 1940 um
 19.25 Uhr, 25 Stunden and 35 Minuten nach dem
 Attentat, stirbt er.
 Die Nachricht von seinem Tod verdrangt die
 Kriegsmeldungen von den ersten Seiten der
 Zeitungen. An seiner Leiche, im Groien Saal des
 Alcazar inmitten der mexikanischen Hauptstadt
 aufgebahrt, defilieren Hunderttausende in stum-
 mer Trauer voruber. Beim Begrabnis folgt eine
 ungeheure Menschenmenge dem Kondukt, and
 bald singt man in den Straflen den ?Grand
 Corrida" fiber Leo Davidowitsch Trotzki. Dieses
 traurige Volkslied, dessen Dichter niemand kennt,
 ist innerhalb weniger Tage in aller Munde:
 ?Trotzki ist tot - erschlagen
 zwischen Morgen and Nacht.
 Die ihn geliebt haben, klagen.
 Der es bef ohlen hat, lacht.
 Gastfreundschaft and Frieden zu suchen
 Nach Jahren volt Kampf en and Not,
 Kam Trotzki zu uns nach Coyoacan
 Und fand bei uns seinen Tod.
 Als Freund, dem man herzlich vertraut hat,
 Schlich sich der Morder ins Haus,
 Das Trotzki bei uns sich gebaut hat,
 Und zog seine Axt heraus.
 Er ersdrlug seinen Wirt and Freund,
 Der ihm nichts Bases getanl
 Ganz Mexiko weint nun um ihn,
 Und es trauert ganz Coyoacan."
 Der Morder, der sich von seinem Schock and
 den Schlagen schnell erholt, wird pausenlos ver-
 hort. Er wei8 fur alles eine Erklarung, and wenn
 er sich in WidersprUche verwickelt, schi tzt er
 Gedachtnisschwund vor. Nur einmal verliert er
 vollig seine Fassung: als man ihn seiner ebenfalls
 verhafteten Freundin Sylvia Ageloff gegeniiber-
 stellt.
 Nachdem sie am 20. August bis gegen 19 Uhr
 in ihrem Hotel Montijo vergeblich auf ihren
 Freund gewartet hatte, rief sie in Coyoacan an
 and horte, was geschehen war. Sie eilte sofort
 zum Tatort and stellte sich der Polizei zur Ver-
 fiigung. Zwar glaubte man ihr, daB sie an dem
 Attentat nicht beteiligt gewesen sei, dock die
 Untersuchungsbehorden hielten es fur richtiger,
 sic vorlaufig festzunehmen.
 Den Attentater hatte man bei ihrer Festnahme
 schon abtransportiert. Als sic ihn jetzt vor sich
 sieht, schreit sic: ,Bringt den Morder weg! Totet
 ihnI Er hat Trotzki ermordetI Schlagt ihn tot!"
 Einer der Beamten wendet sick Sylvia zu and
 sagt: ?Jacson behauptet, daft Sic sein einziger
 Lebenszweck seien and daf3 er Ihretwegen Trotzki
 getotet babe, da Sic das Opfer seiner Intrigen
 werden sollten."
 ?Lauter LiigenI" widerspricht Sylvia. Er ist ein
 Heuchler, er ist ein Morderl Totet ihnl"
 In ihrer Gegenwart wagt Jacson-Mornard nicht,
 seine  Behauptungen zu wiederholen. Sylvia
 Ageloff widerlegt ihm vieles, and jeder, der
 dieser Gegeniiberstellung beiwohnt, ist uberzeugt,
 da13 sic die Wahrheit sagt, wenn sic in hbchster
 Erregung herausschreit: ?Er ist ein Verrater in
 der Liebe, in der Freundschaft, in allem. Ich weif3
 jetzt, daft ich das Werkzeug dieses Schuftes ge-
 wesen bin." Sic spuckt ihn an, and als er hinaus-
 gefuhrt wird, ruft sic hinter ihm her:  Du
 Kanaille 1 Du Kanaillel Du Kanaillel"
 Fur die Kriminalisten and Anwalte bleiben
 trotz der Aussagen von Sylvia Ageloff ungezahlte

 i
 Fragen often, denn wegen der kriegsbedingten
 Verhaltnisse lassen sich zahlreiche Behauptungen
 nicht nachpriifen, ein Umstand, den der Morder
 and sein Inspirator Eitingon, der ihn so hervor-
 ragend praparierte, richer einkalkuliert haben. So
 kann die Untersuchung nicht mit der gebotenen
 Grundlichkeit gefiihrt werden.
 Je langer die Untersuchung dauert, desto mehr
 spielt sich das Leben des Morders im Gefangnis
 ein. Ihm stehen unbeschrankte Geldmittel zur
 Verfugung, er kann sick ein Grammophon, einen
 Radioapparat, Bucher, Zeitungen, Weine and
 sugar Damenbesuch leisten. Als der Prozef3 1943
 stattfindet, hat - nach der siegreichen Schlacht
 von Stalingrad - die internationale Sympathie
 fur Stalin einen nie fur moglich gehaltenen Hohe-
 punkt erreicht.
 Wie durch Zufall bekannt wird, haben die Ver-
 teidiger ?von unbekannter Seite" 20 000 Dollar
 erhalten. Die Herkunft des Geldes laBt sick er-
 raten. Am 16. April 1943 wird das Urteil ver-
 kiindet: Ramon de Rio Mercader alias Jacques
 Mornard alias Frank Jacson wird zur Hochststrafe
 verurteilt, die das mexikanische Strafgesetzbuch
 fur Mord kennt: 20 Jahre Zuchthaus. Im Urteil
 heifit es:
 ,,Vom Beginn seiner Reise nach Mexiko bis
 zur Herstellung personlicher Beziehungen zu
 Trotzki and auch danach ist Mornards Ver-
 halten voller Unwahrhaftigkeit and Tiicke. Das
 Gericht muB daraus schlieBen, dab Frank Jacson
 oder Jacques Mornard seine Reise nach Mexiko
 zu dem ausschlief3lichen Zweck der Ermordung
 Trotzkis unternahm ...
 Die amerikanischen Trotzkisten baten die Re-
 gierung in Washington darum, die Leiche Leo
 Trotzkis in die Vereinigten Staaten i1berfiihren
 zu durfen, aber die State Department verweigerte
 .auch dem Toten ein Visum. Am 27. August 1940
 wind der Leichnam eingeaschert and die Urne mit
 der Asche im Garten des Hauses in Coyoacan bei-
 gesetzt. Ein weiBer rechteckiger Stein, i.iber dem
 eine rote Fahne weht, bezeichnet die Stelle.
 Daneberrist kurze Zeit vorher nosh ein anderes
 Grab ausgehoben worden. Auf der Marmorplatte
 steht:  In Memory of Robert Sheldon Harte,
 1915-1940, murdered by Stalin." Harte, nach
 dem Uberfall am 24. Mai angeblich zwangsweise
 verschleppt, wurde in der Tat von Agenten Stalins
 ermordet, dock aus ganz anderen GrUnden als
 Trotzki: Er war ein Spitzel, der mundtot gemacht
 werden muBte. Aber Trotzki glaubte unersdiiit-
 terlich an die Treue seines Wachters and erwies
 dem Toten unverdiente Ehre.
 Das Zimmer, in dem Trotzki todlich verwundet
 wurde, belaf3t man in dem Zustand. Seine Frau
 Nathalie Sedowa, die noch 20 Jahre in dem Haus
 leben wird, legt Wert darauf, dab man nidits ver-
 andert. Es ist einsam um sie geworden; nur ein
 Enkel blieb ihr - and die Erinnerung. Sic soil
 nicht verwischt werden. Jeden Morgen gruBt sie
 das Totenmal ihres Mannes. Audi die Marmor-
 platte sieht sie, aber sic glaubt ebenfalls, daft
 Harte kein Spitzel war. Die These der Polizei an-
 zuerkennen, kame ihr wie Verrat an ihrem er-
 mordeten Manne and den ermordeten Sohnen
 and Enkelkindern vor.
 Als Nathalie Sedowa nach den Enthullungen
 Chruschtschows auf dem XX. Parteitag die So-
 wjetregierung ersucht, nunmehr auch den Sieger
 der Revolution vom 7. November  1917, den
 spateren Grunder der Roten Armee, Leo Davi-
 dowitsch Trotzki, zu rehabilitieren, erhalt sic
 keine Antwort. Zehn Jahre nach Stalins Tod
 offnen sich fur Mercader die Tore des Zucht-
 hauses. Am Tor erwarten tschechische Kommu-
 nisten den Morder. Sic bringen ihn zum Flugzeug
 nach Kuba. In der Tschechoslowakei verliert sick
 seine Spur, doch liegen Nachrichten vor, daB er in
 einem kleinen Dorf bei Prag lebt. Den Lenin-
 Orden hat man ihm allerdings wieder abgenom-
 men, and er ist auch kein Held der Sowjetunion"
 mehr.

 In defending their position, the Soviet delegate said:
 "The hearts of 225 million Soviet people are beating in unison
 with the hearts of our Vietnamese friends, the speaker de-
 clared.  We are doing everything to provide not merely moral
 and political, but material assistance to the Vietnamese people,
 to strengthen their defense capacity.  No one must remain neutral
 in this just struggle against barefaced aggression.  Our people
 are ready to further extend their assistance to the people of
 Vietnam and provide it on any scale that might be required."
