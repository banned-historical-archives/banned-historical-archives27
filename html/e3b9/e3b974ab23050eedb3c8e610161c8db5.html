 PEKING-TAIPEI CONTACTS :
 THE QUESTION OF A POSSIBLE "CHINESE SOLUTION"
 This study details known contacts over the
 years between Chinese Communist and Chinese Nationalist
 figures,  judges the intentions of Peking and Taipei,
 and advances certain judgments as to whether the
 present trauma of the Chinese Nationalists will cause
 them to become interested in an accommodation of some
 kind with Peking.
 Available evidence is firm in very few instances;
 the study's judgments are accordingly advanced with
 caution.   That Communist and Nationalist  individuals
 have been interested from time to time in at least
 learning the other's views  is clear:   we know definitely
 that there have been a few initiatives by Chinese
 Communist intermediaries,  from time to time,  and
 some contact between Chinese Communist and Nationalist
 figures in third countries.   It seems fairly certain
 that,  until recently at least,  the Taipei  leadership
 has not been interested in sounding out Peking for the
 terms of any kind of deal -- that Nationalist  interest,
 if any,  has been confined to individual figures whose
 motives have been obscure.   Peking's interest has
 apparently been principally that of attempting to
 undermine Nationalist morale and to sow discord between
 Taipei and the US.

 This study concludes that no significant
 Nationalist vulnerabilities to proposed accommodation
 have developed to mid-1971, but that Peking's
 expectations and confidence in this regard are now
 almost certainly on the sharp rise.   Indeed, a clear
 Nationalist interest in possible deals will probably
 soon begin to appear -- but still confined to in-
 dividuals.   Beyond the near future,  and especially
 as accumulated misfortune besets Nationalist leader-
 ship,  such  interest will doubtless grow.   Whether
 it comes to be the policy of the Nationalist lead-
 ership depends on a myriad of forces,                       chief among
 them the Nationalist succession, the effect of
 Taiwanese pressures, and,  most  importantly,  the state
 of Nationalist confidence in outside guarantees of
 Taiwan's defense.   Given a worst-case combination
 of such forces, susceptibilities to Peking will
 mount.   Meanwhile, Peking will  in any event grow
 more apprehensive that  its Taiwan ambitions may
 be impeded by Taiwanese -- and Japanese -- aspirations.
 This study has profited from constructive inputs
 from many offices  in the Central Intelligence Agency.
 There is a sizable area of general agreement concerning
 Nationalist-Communist contacts to date, but because so
 much of the evidence is tenuous,  and the future
 necessarily speculative,  the views expressed in this
 study remain essentially those of its principal
 author,                   who wrote much of this
 study during an early-1971 tour of duty with this Staff.
 This study is based on information available to
 1 July 1971.   Comments on the study and its judgments
 will be welcome.

 PEKING-TAIPEI CONTACTS:
 TIME QUESTION OF A POSSIBLE "CHINESE SOLUTION"
 Summary
 It should be noted at the outset  that this
 study must of necessity be highly speculative.   The
 evidence is firm only on occasion.   At times the
 U.S. Government has been informed by Chiang Ching-kuo
 of approaches to Chinese Nationalist figures by
 Chinese Communists;  at other times we have learned of
 such contacts only through our own clandestine means;
 at still other times some contact must be assumed.
 It seems clear that  in such contacts  to date there
 has been neither much Chinese Communist expectation
 nor significant Chinese Nationalist vulnerability.
 But the accelerating decline of the GFr's fortures
 -- and raison d'etre -- is bringing new forces into play
 which b Tx   this shadowy "Chinese solution" question
 more to center stage.
 The first known Chinese Nationalist-Communist
 contacts,   after theNationalist expulsion from the
 mainland,    took place in 1955-1956.   The apparent
 causes were various checks at that time upon overt
 Chinese Communist advances in the Taiwan Strait:   the
 conclusion of a US-GRC Mutual Defense Treaty
 (December 1.954);  Peking's turn (April 1955)  to a new,
 "peaceful" foreign policy course,  overall;   and the
 initiation  ;August  1955)  of the US-Chinese Communist

 talks  in Warsaw.   It was  in this context of reduced
 military pressures and of Peking's shift to a  professed
 interest  in negotiating a "peaceful" settlement of the
 Taiwan issue with the GRC,  that Peking began to
 supplement its public overtures to Taipei by a series
 of private letters to Nationalist leaders -- over a
 period of seven years.   During the same period Chinese
 Communist agents and officials  instigated false rumors
 of peace talks between the two regimes.   Peking
 also sought  in various ways to entice Nationalist
 and unaligned Chinese leaders abroad to return
 "home."
 These "peaceful liberation"  initiatives of
 1955 apparently had several related objectives:   to
 give Peking an appearance of r,iasonableness    in the
 eyes of the world,  to generate mutual suspicion
 between Washington and Taipei,  to disturb and dis-
 credit GRC leaders,  and to encourage betrayals.                                The
 relative emphasis on these several objectives seemed
 to vary from time to time.   Open psychological
 warfare -- radio broadcasts,  rumors,  and written
 propa an da -- was predominant in early 1957

 In any event,  Ching-kuo reported Tsao's approaches
 to US authorities,  and all of these -- and all other
 knova' overtures for negotiations  in the years i955-
 1962 -- were reportedly ignored or flatly rejected by
 the GRC.   There is no credible evidence to the con-
 trary.   The Nationalists apparently not only rejected
 the idea of peace talks but resented the notion that
 they might consider seriously such a course.   In late
 1958 GRC Vice President Chen Cheng publicly confirmed
 rumors and press reports that GRC leaders had privately
 been receiving proposals for negotiations from the
 Chinese Communists.  The Vice President denounced
 these initiatives and other peaceful "liberation"
 gestures as attempts to divert attention from
 Peking's failure to interdict the offshore islands
 in 1958,  and to create distrust between Taipei
 and its US ally.   The GRC took this step,  three
 years after Peking's effort began,  only after
 deciding that the post-Taiwan Strait crisis rumors
 about peace talks required an official denial.

 S  'RFT
 When in January 1964 France recognized the  Peking
 regime, the Chinese Communists, including some of the
 senior leaders,  sought to create a snowball diplomatic
 effect by hinting at  improved prospects for a
 settlement with the GRC.   In late 1965 Peking received
 an unprecedented degree of support  in the General
 Assembly for admission to the United Nations.   But
 by early 1966 Peking's diplomatic activity was
 interrupted by the Cultural Revolution, and the
 disorder on the mainland during the next few
 years reversed the trend of international. acceptance
 of the Chinese Communist regime.   During those
 years -- 1965 to early 1969 -- no Peking approaches
 to Taipei are known to have been made,  other than
 some tentative, approaches made in Europe through
 various in'(:er::iat;ional organizations.
 As for motives, Peking's 1955-56 "peaceful
 liberation?' talk was moderately effective in gulling
 certain governments,  and probably was viewed by the
 Chinese Communist  leadership as worth the low-priority
 effort expended,   The "reasonable" pooture resulted
 in improved public relations and diplomatic gains.
 Some of the initiatives probably sharpened Nationalist

 was one significant "return" -- in 1965, of the aged
 former GRC Vice President,  Li Tsung-jen --                    ich was
 probably a product of Pekin  's ef.f  ,
 Vice President
 Chen Cheng's death in 1965 removed the only apparent
 threat to Chiang Cliing-kuo's primacy after the  death
 or retirement of his father.   There were, no consequent
 defections by GRC leaders,  in response to the Communist
 enticements,  no apparent major demoralization among
 the Nationalists,  and no app;-eciable disturbance of
 the Taipei-Washington relationship.
 In the spring of 1969 the mainland situation
 began to stabilize -   more or less  - and Peking
 moved to rehabilitate its diplomacy.   Again, the Chinese
 Communists were interested in appearing reasonable and
 in encouraging the belio,f that the "peaceful liberation"
 of Taiwan was not only desirable but probable.
 Diplomatic successes in late 1970 and 1971 have
 facilitated Peking's strategy of affecting patience
 and moderation about Taiwan,  and of trying to generate
 distrust between Taipei and Washington.   Chinese
 Conimunis;, figures have meanwhile been busily spreading
 reports that the GRC is nearing the end of the road
 and that Taiwan will eventually be assimilated back
 into China.
 Indeed,  Peking's expectations have duubtiess
 been raised sharply by events of the past year or
 so.     Communist China is in the process of enjoying the
 breakthrough in international status which it has

 long coveted,  and Mao and (:hou En-lai must judge that
 the dimensions of this breakthrough will markedly
 improve Peking's political and psychological leverage
 against the Nationalists.   Chinese Communist figures
 have made certain statements of late apparently aimed
 at capitalizing on rising vulnerabilities,  and we
 must assume that these statements are being
 paralleled -- or shortly will be -- by attempts to
 make private contact with Nationalist figures or
 intermediaries.   We should fi.rther assume that Peking
 may sweeten its offers somewhat,  in the expectation
 that the GRC will have virtually no place to go,  and
 that time may work  to Peking's advantage.   Even so,
 it would seem unlikely that Mao or his successors will
 offer any deal in which the small print adds up to
 much more than honorific status for ex-Nationalists.
 For its part,  in accelerating diplomatic
 isolation,  and apparently  uncertain of US intentions,
 the GRC is  faced with ueclining morale,  and doubtless
 will experience  increased uneasiness over Taiwanese
 assertiveness,  some greater  internal security problems,
 and heightened individual Nationalist mainlander
 interest in various  "worst case" options.   Although
 disgruntled or despairing Nationalist figures who
 have left Taiwan thus far have for the most part
 settled in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia,  or the USA,
 some may come to choose the China mainland -- or
 defection  in place.    To important measure,  the
 degree of receptiveness which develops among the
 Nationalists to Peking will depend upon  the feasible
 options open to them which circumstance  and numerous
 variables bring.   For the near term -- so long as the
 Chi.angs and their mainlander colleagues  have no

 of the GRC's still-formidable economic, administrative,

 Since the founding of the Chinese People's
 Republic  in 1949,  the Chinese Communists have never
 deviated from the position that Taiwan is an inter-
 nal question to be settled by the Chinese themselves.
 The Communists have been careful to foreclose none
 of  the options about the means to the "liberation"
 of Taiwan.   They have shared consistently with the
 Government of the Republic of China  (GRC)  in Taipei
 the unqualified position that Taiwan is a part of
 China, and from t ii,ie to time they have re-emphasized
 the legal and historical basis of that position.
 Peking views any advocacy o f . Taiwan's autonomy -- e . g . ,
 the Taiwan Independence Movement -- as an "imperialist"
 intrigue,  while Taipei has suppressed Taiwan indepen-
 dence leaders as a threat to Nationalist power on
 Taiwan and subversive of the GRC claim to be the
 government of all China.
 Prior to the defeat of Japan in 1945,  the
 Chinese Communists favored independence for Taiwan,
 but when the GRC accepted Japan's surrender on the
 island and occupied it,  the Communists shifted to
 advocacy of an "autonomous" Taiwan within China.   It
 was not until 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek's exiled
 control of Taiwan posed a continuing challenge to the
 legitimacy and security of the People's Republic of
 China,  that the Chinese Communists adopted the
 uncompromising position they hold now.

 The legal status of Taiwan is arguable.
 Following China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War,
 it was ?_eded to Japan. During World War II the
 Allied Powers unequivocally committed themselves
 in the Cairo Declaration of 1943 to restore Taiwan
 to China.   In the peace treaties Japan signed with
 the Allied Powers  in 1951 and,  separately,  with
 the GRC in 1952,  Japan renounced sovereignty over
 Taiwan but did not hand it specifically to the GRC.
 Thus while Poking and Taipei hold the Cairo
 Declaration to be an unchallengeable basis for
 their claims,  Taiwanese  independence leaders,  citing
 political developments since 1945,  including the
 denial of Taiwanese freedom under the GRC,  argue
 that legal sovereignty is still to be determined
 in the absence of Japanese disposition of the
 territory.   These advocates point out also that
 Article 103 of the United Nations Charter provides
 for self-.determination as a principle  in fixing
 the status of  former colonial territories.   However,
 sirce 1949  the  political and military realities of
 Natior;,!i t control have eclipsed the juridical
 ambiguities about Taiwan's status.
 U?i'A:I  1955 Peking's pronour,ccements about
 try "iibera.tior." of Taiwan were belligerent.   The
 out.l:,rE:ak of' th?: Korean VYar in 1950 and the neutrali-
 zation of. Taiwan had nullified Communist aspirations
 regarding a military takeover of the island,  but
 Peking continued to address the question in threaten-
 ing language.   When in December 1954 the US signed a
 Mutual Defense Treaty with the GRC,  the risk of any
 move against. Taiwan became clearly unacceptable,
 especially since Peking's Soviet ally had in the

 meantime  indicated that support for Peking's claim
 to Taiwan did not extend to military support  for
 'liberation" of it by Peking's resort to force?.
 In light of the military impossibility of
 -seizing Taiwan,  Peking shifted to the political
 tactics of sowing Suspicion between Washington and
 'Taipei and of trying; to defect prominent Nationalists.

 Spring 1955 to Fall 1958
 A.   Public Overtures and Private Approaches
 On several occasions during the spring of 1955
 Chinese Communist Premier Chou En-tai offered publicly
 to negotiate the status of Taiwan with the "Taiwan
 authc 'ities.1' As the first hint of seeming flexibility
 in Peking's position on the issue,  Chou's overture was
 calculated to give Peking an appearance of reasonable-
 ness and to portray the US as the intransigent and
 offending party. The offer was  ignored officially by
 the CRC, but in July 1955 it was rejected by a cabinet-
 rank spokesman in Taipei who requested anonymity in
 conversation ;pith foreign journalists.   Referring
 implic.:}; v to the forthcoming US-Peking talks  in Warsaw,
 the spokasma.n said that Chinese Communist double talk
 might  fool some Americans  but not the Chinese people.*

 have never been absent from comments about dealing
 with Peking which Taipei has  issued publicly, and
 which GRC leaders have made privately to US officials.
 Between August and December 1955 and coinci-
 dent with. Peking's public enticements, a Hong Kong
 Journalist,  Tsao Chu-jen, sent three secret letters
 to Chiang Ching-kuo, President Chiang Kai-shek's son
 and likely successor and then Deputy Secretary General
 of the GRC National Defense Council.   No aspect of
 Peking's peaceful "liberation" campaign from 1955 to
 the early 1960's is more puzzling than the role of
 this Tsao,  whose secret communications  to Chiang
 Ching-kuo in 1955 anticipated Chou En-lai's formal
 declaration in 1956 by almost a year.

 Tsao's three letters  to Chiang Ching-kuo  in
 late 1955 asked Chiang to send a representative      to
 Hong Kong to receive "important  information" about a
 Peking-Taipei reconciliation.   The existence of these
 letters was leaked to the press,  probably by the
 writer hir;-self;  only after the leak did Chiang divulge
 the letters to US representatives in Taipei.   Origina-
 ting with a dubious figure like Tsao,  this  initiative
 was clearly not a serious approach to Taipei.   It may
 have been encouraged by Peking's Hong Kong apparatus
 as a no-cost fishing expedition that might if nothing
 else embarrass Chiang Ching-kuo,  making it appear that

 in Peking's eyes he was susceptible to such a
 suggestion.   By reporting the letters to US officials,
 Chiang,  who had spent 12 years  in the USSR and
 had temporarily joined the Communist Party there,
 showed sensitivity to possible US suspicions and
 called attention to his rejection of the approach.
 It is noteworthy that a US journalist had published
 a report that Chiang had sent an emissary to Hong
 Kong who returned with an offer from Peking of
 "autonomous" status for Taiwan and a high position
 for Chiang Ching-kuo; Chiang now dismissed this as
 a fabrication, which undoubtedly it was.
 In June 1956 Peking formally established i+
 "peaceful liberation" posture.   Chou En-lai,  addrc s-
 ing the National People's Congress  in Peking on
 28 June,  made an authoritative declaration of Peking's
 basic negotiating po, H it ion on Taiwan.   This declara-
 tion was to be cited later by P'eng Te-huai,                               Chinese
 Communist Minister o  National Defense, when he
 announced the suspension of the bombardment of Chin-
 men (Quemoy;  in early October 1958.  Chou En-lai
 said in June 1956:
 "Now on behalf of the Government
 I formally state:   we are willing
 to negotiate with the Taiwan
 authorities on specific steps and
 terms for the peaceful  liberation
 of Taiwan,  and we hope that the

 In order to unite all patriotic
 forces to realize at an early
 date the complete unification
 of our motherland,  I wish here
 to declare once again that all
 patriotic people,  regardless
 of whether they joined the
 patriotic ranks earlier or later,
 and regardless of how great the
 crimes they committed in the
 past may have been, will be
 treated in accordance with the
 principle that patriots belo.ig

 of no punishment for past mis-
 deeds.   They are all welcome to
 perform meritorious services for
 the peaceful liberation of Taiwan,
 and will be duly rewarded accord-
 ing to the degree of their merits
 and provided with appropriate
 jobs."
 This patronizing statement,  committing Peking
 to nothing,      was a strong reaffirmation of Chinese
 Communist "reasonableness" on the question of Taiwan.
 It was consistent with the relatively moderate style
 of policy at the time -- at home and abroad.   It was
 designed to gain a wider and more attentive interna-
 tional audienc(, for Peking's attempt to set the claims
 of the family  if the Chinese people against the alleged
 interference and aggression of outsiders.  Chou

 of specific proposals was to be communicated privately
 to GRC leaders over the next few years.   The tone of
 Chou's declaration and its basic themes -- forgive-
 ness, flexibility,  leniency, patriotism, and partici-

 side from that time on. The declaration set the
 stage for Peking's effort during the following decade
 to appear "reasonable," to promote distrust between
 the GRC and the US,  to weaken Chinese Nationalist
 morale, to sow suspicion within the GRC leadership,
 and to encourage defections and betrayals in Taipei.
 There was nothing  in Chou En-lai's statement to suggest
 the expectation of a positive response,  and there was
 in fact no response at all.

 S FC`.12 F r
 In early 1957, at about the time Tsao Chu-Jen
 was writing to Chiang Ching.-kuo and the others,  Peking
 stepped up its propaganda directed to Taiwan and its
 efforts to defect ex-mainlanders in Hong Kong.    Radio
 broadcasts carried a large number of personal appeals
 by mainland residents to individual Nationalist leaders
 and their families.  These appeals tried to 9xploit
 homesickness and stressed patriotism and reconcilia-
 tion.   Rumors were planted concerning high-level
 discussions between Peking and Taipei, and there was
 an attempt to generate pressure for peace negotiations
 on the GRC among overseas Chinese communities.
 This 1957 campaign began to disturb the GRC
 leadership.  Taipei, dependent upon the US and seeking
 US support for eventual recovery of the mainland,  did
 not want to be taken too much for granted, but neither
 did it want suspicion of GRC intentions to develop
 in Washington.   The rumors of peace talks were starting-
 to find foreign believers, even in embassies and foreign
 offices around the world where the rumors were traded
 and reported on.   A sense of the atmosphere at the time
 is suggested by the fact that US diplomatic and intelli-
 gence officers in Taipei and Hong Kong were urged
 periodically to evaluate the possibility that GRC-
 Peking negotiations were about to occur, or were already
 in progress.  President Chiang Kai-shek was personally
 concerned, and the question of counter-psychological

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/07/29: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010045-7
 warfare was discussed at Kuomintang Central Committee
 meetings.   But no counter-campaign was launched -- not
 then -- probably because of a judgment that any
 formal reaction would give the rumors a measure of
 credibility, of serious Nationalist concern.  GRC
 leaders, when asked about peace talks with Peking,
 simply dismissed the idea as preposterous.  And it
 was preposterous, but GRC sensitivity to the impact
 of the rumors was real, just as Chiang Ching-kuo's
 personal sensitivity to the letters from Tsao Chu-jen
 had induced him to divulge the letters to US officials
 and to affirm his rejection of the suggestion they
 contained.
 B.  Hard-Line Interruption of the Campaign
 By the early summer of 1957 the Chinese Commui.ist
 leadership was shaken and disillusioned by the discon-
 tent that surfaced during the Hundred Flowers Movement.
 In June the "anti-rightist" campaign began, and domestic
 developments eventuated in the assertive hard-line
 measures of a year later, the "people's communes" and
 the Great Leap Forward.  Foreign affairs meanwhile moved
 toward significantly hardening Chinese positions with
 respect to the Soviet ally.
 Meanwhile,  in November 1957, Chou En-lai granted
 an interview in Peking to the editor of Suddeutsche
 Zeitung,  the leading Munich daily.*  Chou reaffirmed
 *Issue of 19 November 1957.

 the Taiwan issue as an internal Chinese question,
 stating that Peking might be willing  to recognize
 Chiang Kai-shek's position as "leader on Taiwan."   Thus
 he compromised the private approaches made during the
 previous year and cast President Chiang  in the role of
 a powerless supplicant..  Chou in this interview accused
 the US of Pursuing a Two-China concept,  which he said
 Peking would never accept., and he asserted that the US
 would never allow a Nationalist attack on the mainland.
 Therefore,  according to Chou,  Chiang Kai-shek would
 have to choose a way out, and nothing but the date (of
 a deal with the Chinese Communists) was  left for him to
 decide.   When asked by the editor whether Peking had
 any confidential connections with Chiang or his inner
 circle, Chou seized the opportunity to feed possible
 US suspicions of GRC intentions:   "If we had any
 official (connections), the US would let Chiang down."
 Peking generally ignored Taiwan during the
 momentous events of 1958,  until 23 August, when main-
 land batteries                              in Fukien Province began the shelling
 of Chinmen Island,   Mao Tse-tung a few -weeks later
 denounced the "US occupation of Taiwan."   By September
 Peking had retreated to a face-saving pretense that the
 "liberation" of  the offshores or of Taiwan by force
 had never been  its  intention -- Peking having been
 compelled to back off by effective,  US-supported GRC
 counteraction,  and by having learned that Moscow was
 not about, to bail Peking out.  in the, event, of a major
 confrontation with   the US,

 II.  PEKING RESUMES A "REASONABLE" POSITION -
 Fall 1958 to 1963
 A.   Peking's Agents Persist
 In September 1958 -- during the offshore island
 crisis but prior to the Chinese Communists' backing-
 off -- Tsao Chu-jen appeared once again,  sending letters
 in that month from Hong Kong
 In any event, Tsao proceeded to leak
 the story about  the conditional bombardment suspension
 to a Singapore newspaper,  possibly a self-serving
 indiscretion but more likely a Peking-inspired effort
 to amplify publicity favorable to the pose of decency
 and conciliation.
 Tsao Chu-jen's September 1958  letters contained
 terms for the "peaceful liberation" of Taiwan,  terms
 which Tsao said had the approval of the Peking author-
 ities.   These  included the retention of Chiang Kai-shek's
 SECRET

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/07/29: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010045-7
 control of civilian and military affairs on Taiwan,
 Chinmen  to become a  trading center after the with-
 drawal of Nationalist  troops,  Taiwan to become an
 autonomous area "like Tibet and Sinkiang"  (:)  on a
 date to be determined, and the Kuomintang to remain an
 independent political party. Tsao described mainland
 progress as "terrific" and urged a GRC delegation to
 visit, Communist China on an inspection trip.   Tsao's
 letter to Chiang Ching-kuo said that Peking viewed
 Chiang as  the logical eventual  leader of post-settle-
 ment Taiwan,  and that Vice-President Chen Cheng was
 also highly regarded by the Chinese Communist leader-
 ship.
 These terms,  like those offered by Tsao more
 than a    year earlier,  may have been formulated by him-
 self.,                    but were almost certainly based on Tsao's dis-
 cussions with persons within,  or close to,  the Chinese
 Communist leadership.   They reflected Peking's  interest
 in re-establishing an ostensibly reasonable stance
 -- in fact a  tough,  though face-saving,  one for the
 GRC - - on a Taiwan solution, and this was paralleled
 at the time by Peking's demonstration of interest in
 renewing  the talks with the US  in Warsaw.   Public
 expression was given to the shift in Taiwan policy by
 Peng Te-,huai when he referred on 6 October 1958 to
 Chou En-lai's earlier (1956) declaration,  and when
 later,  on 25 October,  he said, "Chinese problems must
 be settled by us Chinese alone.   If they are diffi-
 cult  to settle for the  time being,  things can be
 talked over at  length."
 In any event, when Chiang Ching--kuo showed Tsao
 Chu-jen's September 1958 letters to US officials,  he
 said his father would never enter into direct negotia-
 tions with Peking and that the Nationalist leadership

 preferred any status in the free world to selling out
 to the Communists.   Ching-kuo quoted a Chinese proverb,
 "It is better to be a cracked piece of jade than a
 whole piece of common clay."  He also said that the
 letters would be ignored, and that the GRC leadership
 wanted to make certain that the US knew about these
 approaches lest Peking succeed in creating distrust
 between Washington and Taipei.

 B.   Taipei Denounces the Peace Offensive
 By early November 1958, the Chinese Nationalists
 had become convinced of the need to clear the air of a
 new flurry of rumors about possible negotiations with

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/07/29: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010045-7
 Peking.                               the GRC considered
 Tsao Chu-,7 en and Chang Shih-chao as Communist
 psychological warfare agents and their letters only
 one element of an overall program aimed at dividing
 the Chinese Nationalists, eroding Nationalist morale,
 and rupturing the GRC-US relationship.   The GRC
 leaders were relatively unconcerned about Tsao Chu-
 jen,  whom they considered an "opportunist" without
 authentic Peking credentials,  but they believed
 Chang Shih-chao to be a bona fide agent whose reputa-
 tion and influence should be 'dee`stroyed.
 Accordingly,  in mid-November 1958, GRC Vice
 President Chen Cheng,  in an interview with a Central
 News Agency correspondent,  acknowledged that Nation-
 alist officials had been receiving letters from
 Peking representatives urging peace talks.   He referred
 to radio broadcasts to Taiwan and to the spreading
 of rumors  in Hong Kong.   He denounced the Chinese
 Communist campaign as typically treacherous and said
 it was calculated to cover up both the failure of
 Peking's attack on Chinmen and the mainland "internal
 crisis."   Another objective,  Chen said, was to confuse
 the people of the world and drive a wedge between
 China and the US.   He answered a question about US
 Government knowledge of the situation by saying,  "The
 Chinese and US governments have been exchanging  in-
 formation and opinions regularly on the peace rumors
 of  the Communist bandits.   Therefore,  both the Chinese
 and US governments have a clear understanding of such
 peace rumors and have confidence in each other...  "
 This was doubtless  intended not only to reassure Wash-
 ington,  but to give Peking a clear statement that the
 letters from its agents - - in case there was any
 doubt -- were being divulged to the US and that  it
 was no use trying to corrode the Taipei-Washington

 relationship.   The interview was given a moderate
 amount of press coverage on Taiwan during the suc-
 ceeding two days.  All papers unreservedly praised
 the statement,    the independent papr;~rs rather  more
 strongly than the official press.
 We know that in December: 1958 TsaoChu-jen
 said privately that Peking's peace overtures were
 "finished" because of the lack of any response from
 Taipei.   (In fact,  however,  they were resumed in
 1959.)   Tsao described Peking's purpose during the
 three-year campaign of direct approaches as that of
 simply persuading the GRC to communicate, and he
 said that the Chinese Communists would accept "almost
 any terms."   Since it was clear that Peking had been
 driving a hard bargain with Taiwan -- Tibetan status
 being no great new status for Chiang Kai-shek -- and
 knew that the Nationalists were not about to accept,
 Tsao's remark was doubtless another attempt to spread
 the idea of Peking's "reasonableness."
 C.   Peking's Approaches,  Including Some From "High
 Levels",  Continue
 For a brief period in 1959 Peking reduced the
 level of  its public attention to Taiwan.   References
 to the hope for "peaceful liberation" became in-
 frequent,                               and routine propaganda about Taiwan de-
 clined.   There was a corresponding decline in mainland
 appeals for individual defections.   The GRC had ac-
 knowledged publicly the private approaches from Peking
 and had denounced these moves,  and the rumors of peace
 talks,  in a strong statement aimed at deflating the

 effect of additional overtures and rumor campaigns.
 If Peking had hoped. that any of its private initia-
 tives, withheld from the US by the GRC but surfaced
 by Chinese Communist agents, might create suspicions
 in Washington,  'hen Cheng's statements would have
 liquidated such hope.  Moreover, continuing preoccupa-
 tion with Taiwan would have called attention to Peking's
 inability, demonstrated during the Taiwan Strait crisis,
 to do anything but talk about the Taiwan question.
 Finally, economic and political problems on the main-
 land diverted  the leadership's energies to more im-
 mediate concerns.   Nevertheless, Tsao Chu-jen once
 again sent  letters -- urging peace negotiations --
 to Chiang Ching-kuo in early January and in late April
 1959.   In the April letter he proposed that Chiang
 Ching-kuo and Chen Cheng govern Taiwan jointly after
 a settlement with Peking. Again the proposition fell
 on deaf ears.
 In late 1959 Peking seemed ready to re-open
 the "peaceful liberation" campaign on a  large scale.
 The release -- after a decade -- of 30 Kuomintang
 "war criminals" was announced on 4 December, and
 Peking beamed a special broadcast to Taiwan about this
 event.  Chiang Ching-kuo told a US official that he
 regarded the release of prisoners as an extremely
 significant development,  foreshadowing a new peace
 campaign.   He said he had evidence that Peking's
 agents were again in Hong Kong to promote peace talks.

 The only new idea in the purported Chou mes-

 case of "need."  This could have been a hint to Chen
 Cheng of Peking's interest in dealing with him
 directly and privately.

 previous private approaches from lesser Chinese Com-

 fact behind this initiative, the message was appar-

 President and Chiang Ching-kuo and to stimulate
 suspicion of US policy concerning the offshore islands.

 Beginning in mid-1960, Peking was concerned
 or wanted to appear concerned -- about possible
 US support for the Taiwan Independence Movement and
 had hoped that GRC sensitivity on this issue was
 increasing.    Fei I-min in Hong Kong seemed pre-
 occupied with the question in September 1960 when
 he contended, erroneously, that Thomas Liao, the
 leader of the Taiwan Independence Movement in
 Japan, would, soon visit the US.   Expecting his remarks
 to reach the GRC leadership, Fei said there would be
 an "almost unconditional approach" from Peking to
 Taipei and that although the Communist flag would
 have to fly over Taiwan and foreign affairs be handled
 by Peking, the GRC leaders otherwise could  "do as
 they pleased."  This was of course an excessively
 charitable statement of Chinese Communist policy to-
 ward Taiwan once the island had,  like Tibet and
 Sinkiang, become "autonomous."
 In November 1960 Chou En-lai, discussing the
 issue of Taiwan with Edgar Snow said:
 Since it has been possible for China
 and the US to hold ambassadorial talks
 in Geneva and Warsaw, talks can also
 be held at the same time between the

 Central Government of China and the
 Chiang Kai-shek clique.
 This was the public component -- designed to persuade
 international opinion that Peking considered negotia-
 tions with Taipei feasible -- of Chinese Communist
 approaches to the G RC during the previous year.
 There were no additional overtures to Taipei
 until July 1961, when the Kennedy Administration had
 been in office about six months.

 Also in July 1961, Tsao Chu-jen sent another
 letter to Chiang Ching-kuo containing the proposal
 that Chinmen and Amoy be joined as a "buffer zone"
 and a "free port."  Then in November 1961 and again
 in March 1962, Tsao wrote Chiang Ching-kuo urging a
 Nationalist investigation of mainland conditions.
 All of these letters were brought to the attention
 of US officials by Chiang Ching-kuo, who reaffirmed
 his intention to ignore them.*
 D.   Evidence of Peking-Taipei Agent Contacts
 In Au-just 1962 the London Observer published a
 story by Dennis Bloodworth alleging   is  Peking and
 the "family of Chiang Kai-shek" had reached a secret
 agreement on the future of Taiwan.  Bloodworth re-
 ported that during the previous three months Taipei
 representatives had been contacting Hong Kong "peace
 brokers" regularly.  The reported agreement, undoubt-
 edly false and denounced as such by the GRC, could
 have been inspired in part by supporters of GRC Vice
 *Tsao s 1e ters of 1959-62 tended to ramble and
 to elaborate on minor points in a way suggesting pure
 invention on his part.  Peking by early 1959 may have
 given up on Tsao as an effective instrument of psycho-
 logical warfare, and probably was no longer briefing
 him.  Tsao probably wrote most of the letters during
 this period largely on his own, as a means of keeping
 a personal stake in any possible consequences of
 Peking's effort to disturb US-GRC relations.

 President Chen Cheng.  There was evidence at the time
 that Chen was maneuvering to prepare for a power
 struggle with Chiang Ching-kuo following the death
 or retirement of President Chiang.   The reference to
 the "family of Chiang Kai-shek," as Peking's counter-
 part in the alleged agreement, su gested an effort
 to embarrass the younger Chiang.

 in late June 1962 the US assured Peking through
 the ambassadorial talks in Warsaw that Washington
 would not support, and was opposed to, GRC military
 action.  The Chinese Communists, obviously relieved,
 acknowledged publicly their satisfaction with the US
 assurances.
 The GRC leadership had no illusions in 1962
 about the US policy of avoiding a crisis with Com-
 munist China.  But to hear Peking tell the world that
 it had received confirmation privately from the US
 must have infuriated Taipei even though its visible
 reaction was, as always, low-keyed.  President Chiang
 complained to US officials about the effect on Nation-
 alist morale. It may be conjectured that at this
 point the GRC, probably at the personal instigation
 of Chiang Ching-kuo, decided to set up contacts at
 a low level in Hong Kong.  As Chang Shih-chao had
 pointed out several years earlier, the US was talking
 to Peking in Warsaw and allegedly was prepared to
 see Peking have the offshore islands.  Then why, asked
 Chang Shih-chao, should not Peking and Taipei keep
 in touch?  It was a suggestion to which Chiang Ching-
 kuo could have been susceptible in the summer of 1962.

 Although the GRC doubtless had no intention of negotiat-
 ing with Peking, nor even of acknowledging any peace-
 ful settlement approaches from Peking's agents, Nation-
 alist leaders might have seen a low-level channel to
 Peking as a posse  a means of checking on US reports
 to the Nationalists about the ambassadorial talks in
 Warsaw.   In any case, after 1963 no further reporting
 was received on contacts between these two agents in
 Hong Kong.
 E.  Peking's Last Known Private Overture
 In late January 1963 the third purported letter
 from Fu Tso-i,  delivered to Chen Cheng via his sister-
 in-law in Tokyo, pursued the alleged "Two Chinas"
 threat and introduced the question of Sino-Soviet
 relations.   It said:   "at present China's foreign
 debts are just about paid up... In the past some people
 persisted in saying China was a fellow traveler with
 others.   Now no one would believe such remarks."
 There was other evidence at about this time that
 Peking was interested in signalling privately to the
 Nationalists that  it was free of Soviet domination
 and that the GRC ought to break with the US (as
 though the situations were parallel) and negotiate
 the unification of a wholly independent China.   Later
 in 1963 an influential Chinese Communist journalist
 told a Hong Kong resident about to leave for Taiwan
 where he expected to see GRC officials, that Mao
 Tse-tung had never accepted Soviet control,  ?;ind that
 China was being "oppressed" by Khrushchev,    just as
 the GRC was being "oppressed" by the US.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/07/29: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010045-7
 On the margin of this 1963 letter, in what
 Chiang Ching-kuo told US officials was Chen Cheng's
 hand, was written the word "never" beside a passage
 which offered a third period of cooperation between
 the Nationalists and the Communists.  This no doubt
 reflected the true attitude of GRC leaders.
 The purported Fu Tso-i letter of 1963 to Chen
 Cheng ended, as far as is known, the seven-year pro-
 gram of Chinese Communist approaches to the GRC.
 Peking's proposals in these overtures focused on an
 attempt to persuade the Nationalists that union with
 the mainland under Peking's sovereignty would not
 deprive the Taipei power structure of most  (or any)
 of its local privileges.  Peking's control over
 foreign relations was consistently stated as a con-
 dition,  and just as consistent was the offer to ar-
 range for a delegation of Nationalist observers to
 travel the mainland to "see for themselves."  The
 emphasis here was always on the secrecy and security
 of such a delegation, although suggestions were oc-
 casionally offered as to its possible composition.
 The letters projected attitudes of patience, under-
 standing, and sensitivity to the dignity of GRC
 leaders.
 The GRC ignored the letters, and there is no
 evidence that Peking really expected much more than
 probing Nationalist sensitivities and attempting to
 sow suspicions.   The initiatives and the rumors had
 not  split the: leaders in Taipei,  nor subverted the
 Taipei-Washington relationship,  but they had compelled
 the GRC to issue denials from time to time and in
 late 1958 to confirm the Communist campaign, thus
 acknowledgin  its possible impact on public opinion
 on Taiwan.

 The reason why no Chinese Communist letters have
 come to light since January 1963 is not clear.  Others
 could have been sent which Chiang Ching-kuo withheld,
 as some evidence suggests he may have done prior to
 1963.    If Chiang did in fact fail to divulge later
 communications, knowing that the US might learn of
 them in other ways, then his decision to accept this
 risk would have indicated reduced sensitivity to pos-
 sible US suspicions.  Perhaps -- regardless of whether
 additional letters were received -- Chiang wanted
 the US to suspect him of holding out as implicit
 retaliation for his own suspicions, real or pretended,
 about the substance of the ambassadorial talks in
 Warsaw.   But it is equally possible that Peking
 abandoned the private letter device after early 1963
 as no longer worth the effort.

 III.  PEKING EXPLOITS ITS IMPROVED INTERNATIONAL
 PROSPECTS - Early 1964 to Late 1965
 A.  Consequences of French Recognition
 In January 1964 France recognized the PRC -- a
 serious; setback for the GRC, which closed its embassy
 in Paris and severed all contacts with France.   It was
 apparent that Peking viewed French recognition as a
 milestone in its effort to supplant the GRC in the
 world community and as a new weapon in its psychologi-
 cal offensive against Taipei.

 Hong Kong daily Wen Wei Pao,  in February 1964 had

 hinted at a Possible new move in Peking's peaceful
 "liberation" campaign:
 "The Kuomintang on Taiwan does
 not need to be an empty shell.
 If it reforms, casts off us
 control,  becomes independent,
 one would not need to speak of
 its returning to the bosom of
 the motherland to cooperate for
 the third time.  To avoid being
 a completely empty shell it is
 only necessary for the Kuomintang
 to cast off the US Two-Chinas
 plot."
 This was the first time a Chinese Communist organ had
 intimated that Taiwan could have any future other
 than a return to Peking's control.  The statement
 "one would not need to speak of its returning to the
 bosom of the motherland" seemed calculated to provoke
 discussion of a possible revision of Peking's claim
 to Taiwan.  The inspiration for this trial balloon is
 unknown, but it was probably related to the high hopes
 induced by France's major diplomatic decision the
 previous month.  Chairman Mao himself appeared to
 confirm the pose of a generous attitude toward the
 GRC when he talked a few months later to a visiting
 Italian delegation.  On that occasion he spoke bitterly
 of Khrushchev.and, by feigned contrast, mildly of
 Chiang Kai-shek, stating that Chiang could be the
 governor of an "autonomous" Taiwan under Peking's
 sovereignty.

 B.   Return to Peking of Li Tsung-jen
 In July 1965 former KMT leader Li Tsung-jen with
 his wife flew to Paris and then to Peking, where he was
 to remain until his death in 1969.  Li's possible defec-
 tion had been rumored intermittently for years and his
 arrival  in Peking produced a  (Chinese) Roman carnival.
 At a large press conference in Peking in late September,
 Li appeared in a boiler suit and recited the Chinese Com-
 munist line on Soviet revisionism, US "aggression" in Viet-
 nam, and other issues.  His "bombshell" was an incredible
 allegation that a US "Republican bigwig" had approached
 him to arrange an anti-Chiang Kai-shek coup d'etat on

 Taiwan.   In any event, Li Tsung-jen's return, contrary
 to Peking's apparent hopes at the time, did not stimu-
 late others.   We know that Li and his old associates in
 Hong Kong tried to encourage additional returns or
 defections through private approaches,  but no significant
 consequences are known to have resulted.  After the first
 flush of excitement and publicity, Li was reduced to the
 status of a museum piece, without any official position:,
 living quietly and apparently in comfort, talking with
 old friends  in Peking,  and writing letters to other
 Chinese friends abroad, the US included.
 There is  inconclusive evidence that Li Tsung-jen's
 return was motivated by personal rather than political
 considerations.   His wife was terminally ill in Jul
 1965 -- she died in Peking less than a  year later

 IV.  THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION - Late 1965 to Early 1969
 From late 1965 to the spring of 1969, the
 Cultural Revolution on the mainland interrupted Peking's
 psycholo
 gical warfare against the G RC and against
 th
 e
 latter's
 relationship with the US.   Rumors heard

 negotiations.
 No significant new approaches to the GRC are known to
 have been made by Peking during the Cultural Revolution.
 By late 1966 the Chinese Nationalists were
 observing mainland disorder with interest and hope.  The
 spectacle of a strong revolutionary party and bureaucracy
 in the process of self-liquidation obviously lent force
 to the Nationalist argument about Chinese Communist
 impermanence.  Chiang Kai-shek reacted to prospects for
 effective anti-Peking operations,  but he warned his
 supporters that the Chinese Communist possession of nuclear

 weapons required a cautious policy.   Chiang's hope
 was to isolate Mao Tse-tung and encourage factionalism
 and suspicion on the mainland.  GRC propaganda used
 the slogans "those who are not our enemies are our
 friends" and 'only Mao is the enemy."   In March 1967
 President Chiang called for the establishment both on
 Taiwan and the mainland of an "anti-Mao National
 Salvation United Front."  GRC radio broadcasts, letters,
 and air-dropped leaflets invited defections to the
 Nationalists and encouraged guerrilla warfare on the
 mainland.  Echoing a theme from Chou En-lai's 1956
 speech, the GRC told potential mainland defectors  "we
 will not reckon past accounts."
 F Nationalist
 spokesmen, seeking to drive a wedge between Mao and
 his chief lieutenants,  hinted
 willingness to do business with Chou En-lai but never
 with Mao Tse-tung.   There is no evidence that the
 Nationalist attitude toward negotiating with the Chinese
 Communists had changed;  the GRC's objective was simply
 to create trouble for Peking, just as Peking's various
 overtures had tried earlier to discredit GRC leaders  in
 the eyes of the US and provoke suspicion in Taipei of
 US  intentions.
 During 1967 and 1968 GRC hopes for significant
 Communist defections and the political fragmentation
 of the mainland were disappointed.   Disorder continued,
 but Mao and the People's Liberation Army maintained
 control, few significant defections occurred, and the
 GRC's return to the mainland seemed as distant a
 possibility as ever.  However, the bitter Peking-Moscow

 quarrel persisted, and the GRC, again on the defensive,
 ceased its attacks on the USSR and opened discreet
 contacts with Victor Louis, a Soviet overseas agent.
 In March 1969 Chiang Kai-shek appealed for
 Japanese support, and again for mainland defections,  in
 a published interview with a Japanese journalist.   Once
 more Chiang borrowed from Peking's line by promising
 friendly treatment to Chinese Communist cadres who chose
 freedom and came to Taiwan.  He repeated the familiar
 slogan, "only Mao is my enemy," but said that there was
 no possibility of accommodation and cooperation with the
 Chinese Communists.  This last assertion -- denying the
 possibility of an accommodation with Peking -- seems
 to be the basic guideline of Chiang's policy.  There is
 no evidence in recent materials that he has changed this
 thinking in any degree.

 V.   PROSPECTS FOR A "CHINESE SOLUTION"
 The central problem at hand now is of course
 whether the present precipitous decline of the GRC's
 world fortunes will appreciably change Chinese
 Nationalist lack of interest to date in overtures:
 from Peking.
 There is no historical inevitability about the
 unii ication of Taiwan and the mainland.   "Return to
 the Mainland" has long been largely a ritualistic slogan
 resembling "next year in Jerusalem" in its political
 and psychological content.   Peking's slogan, "liberation
 of Taiwan," has little more level of realism, at least
 while the US defense commitment is still intact.  There
 are no grass-root passions on either the Communist or
 GRC sides to outlast successor leaderships and sustain
 the issue of unification-by-force as a political or
 emotional. urge; both in Peking and among mainlander
 Nationalists, the motivation to risk other equities
 over the unification question may well weaken over
 the long term.   Nonetheless,  the salvaging of some
 status and fortune under Peking,  as part of a great
 new China,  would -- in extremis --?almost certainly
 have more appeal to some mainlander Nationalists
 than would a future of taking one's chances with
 aspiring and perhaps vengeful Taiwanese overlords.
 The chief keys to this problem at the moment,
 at least, are probably President Chiang Kai-shek and
 the state of his confidence that the US will protect
 Taiwan.   So long as he has no reason seriously to doubt
 the latter,  the chances of any deal with Peking on
 his part seem remote.   He is a proud man -- in his eyes,
 a great world figure;  the loss of face and the implicit

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/07/29: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010045-7
 admission of past faults that would be involved in
 his accepting some kind of figurehead status with
 Peking are sizable forces among those holding him
 from accommodation.  Further, he still believes in
 the Nationalist profession of a "Return to the
 Mainland."  For President Chiang this watchword has
 taken on the quality of an article of faith, the
 mainland to be redeemed eventually by largely political
 means -- if need be by his GRC successors.  There is
 no way of judging with confidence how that slender
 thread of hope would be affected in the event he should
 come to feel that the US security guarantee of Taiwan
 were no longer a reasonable certainty.
 A more significant actor -- and factor -- for
 the future is the Generalissimo's putative de facto
 successor, Chiang Ching-kuo.   Primarily to create sus-
 picion in Washington of possible Chinese Nationalist
 opportunism, Peking in its efforts over the years has
 sought to promote the expectation that the younger
 Chiang will be "more flexible" after his father dies
 or retires.
 The possibility
 cannot of course be excluded that Chiang Ching-kuo,
 himself a "pragmatist," might feel that he could deal
 with a Chinese Communist leadership whose revolutionary
 impulses had been replaced by bureaucratic stability
 and low-risk policies.  Such a regime, perhaps resembling
 in at least some aspects his own rule on Taiwan, might
 be managed by men whom Ching-kuo could understand

 and -- by calculated risk -- trust.   Peking has for many
 years targeted Ching-kuo in its peace offensives and
 other contacts as the key to the "peaceful liberation
 of Taiwan," and we must assume that the prudent Ching-kuo
 has secretly kept open the option of a deal, however
 far-out or remote this contingency.   To some degree,
 at least, a future mainland China and he would have
 something of value to offer each other, the basis
 for settlement being Peking's sovereignty over
 Taiwan, in return for the guarantee of Nationalist
 proconsular viability on Taiwan -- and over the
 Taiwanese.   Peking otherwise could not gain this
 sovereignty except by force; and, other than by a
 deal with Peking, Chiang Ching-kuo might have to rely
 on a precarious hold,  over growing political pressures
 from the majority Taiwanese, to displace mainlander
 KMT rule on the island.
 Having raised this contingency,  it should be
 emphasized that the chances of any such eventuality
 will doubtless be slight so long as Chiang Ching-kuo
 remains reasonably confident of US defense of Taiwan .
 He has a realistic appreciation of the worth of Peking's
 promises.  The personal and political rewards of
 being the model boss of a model kingdom -- albeit
 one reduced in international status -- would doubtless
 outweigh his expectations from some kind of
 museum-piece status (even as a PRC Vice President)
 under the Chinese Communists.   His carefully-structured
 apparatus on Taiwan will probably remain a fairly
 potent one for some time to come,  until eroded over
 the long term by his death, extreme GRC adversities,
 and/or eventual mainlander decline in the face of
 Taiwanese fecundity.

 Somewhat similar considerations would seem
 likely to obtain in the event that Chiang Ching-kuo
 should predecease his father.  Ching-kuo has developed
 a broad and efficient cadre of lieutenants in the GRC
 administrative, military, and internal security
 establishments; and, given reasonable confidence on
 their part in the continuing US protection of Taiwan,
 they would for the most part doubtless remain
 loyal to President Chiang, and might be able for
 some time to deflect or neutralize Taiwanese pressures.
 A serious situation would arise, nonetheless, with
 the passing as well of Chiang Kai-shek.   In such
 event, political stability might well fragment, and
 receptiveness to Peking mount -- the outlook for US
 protection of Taiwan probably remaining the principal
 operative factor.   Beyond an interim such period,
 much would depend upon the particular GRC successors --
 whether a collegium or not,  the degree to which they
 were able to hang together, and especially the degree
 to which they were to change some fundamental attributes
 of Chinese Nationalist rule and begin sharing significant
 national authority with the Taiwanese.   Upon that
 outcome would heavily rest Taiwan's subsequent stability,
 viability,  and,  not least,  susceptibility to Chinese
 Communist siren songs.
 In the meantime,  and short of such contingency,
 Taiwanese interest  in what Peking has  Lo offer will
 also grow,  in almost any event,  though to lesser
 extent than in the case of individual mainlander
 Nationalists.   We know that the Chinese Communists
 have been successful in recruiting some Taiwanese
 abroad.   Peking's agents also conduct various low-scale
 pamphlet and other psychological warfare efforts on
 Taiwan,  and we must assume that there is a certain

 susceptibility among Taiwanese students,  intellectuals,
 and possibly military personnel to Chinese Communist
 themes.   We know that there is some vicarious pride,
 among such groups,  in certain of Peking's achievements
 of recent years.  Also, Taiwanese independence aspira-
 tions and political organization appear overall to be
 somewhat fuzzy and future-tensed in nature, not items
 creating intense and immediate pressures.   Nonetheless,
 Peking does not have a very fertile field in which to
 sow enticement among the Taiwanese.  That population
 is fairly well aware of the relative conditions
 of life and opportunity in China and Taiwan, and in
 the main seem clearly more interested in some day
 creating a going Taiwanese state than in trading their
 not intolerable present fortunes for something like
 the Peking-proffered Tibetan status.
 Further speculation is  fruitless at this time,
 as the Nationalist-Communist future is so much the
 product of so many significant unknowns.   Suffice it to.
 say, what was the general setting of this game is now
 radically changed.   What was a far-out contingency has
 become a much more relevant question -- and one
 deserving of close US intelligence watch -- to all
 the principal players.   For the Chinese Communists,
 present circumstances doubtless expand and strengthen
 expectation and long-term confidence.   For the
 respective populations on Taiwan,  present circumstances
 now make unavoidable the long-evaded question of
 feasible alternatives,  including even a "worst case"
 future of one with Peking.
 Not least,
 there are new questions of moment for the US.
