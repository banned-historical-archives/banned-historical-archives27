 It now is clear that the North Vietnamese, in pursuit of their long-range
 goal of dominating all of Indochina, have moved rapidly both in reaction to
 allied cross-border operations and to take advantage of a weak regime in
 Phnom Penh. The Communists have established nearly total control over
 northeastern Cambodia, are pressing government forces in adjacent Laos, and
 now are in a position to establish new supply routes to the west of the
 present ones if they so choose. They are also pushing across the northern tier
 of Cambodian provinces, as well as demonstrating their ability to strike close
 to Phnom Penh. Another provincial capital has been invaded, and the
 Communists are actively engaged in building an indigenous insurgent organi-
 zation. The loyalty of many of their Cambodian recruits, however, is
 probably only superficial.
 The Cambodians and South Vietnamese are still having trouble aetti
 The fighting inside South Vietnam remained at an over-all low level this
 week, but the Communists again demonstrated their ability to hit where and
 when they choose. A sizable flurry of activity occurred on the night of 3
 June, perhaps representing a third and final phase of the enemy's "spring"
 campaign. Earlier in the week, the Communists, with a fairly small force, had
 mounted a dramatic thrust into the mountain resort city of Dalat but they
 were easily beaten back. They inflicted heavy casualties in other attacks,
 however, one on a South Vietnamese outpost near the DMZ, and one that
 penetrated a town in the far southwest.
 Action has begun again in northern Laos, as General Vang Pao launched
 a drive to extend h`is holdings southwest of the Plaine des Jarres. The
 Communists, however, appear to be counterattacking in some strength. This
 could indicate an intention to bottle up Vang Pao in the Meo tribal
 stronghold at Long Tieng, thus preventing any repetition of the govern-
 ment's successful rainy-season offensive of last year.
 A series of mammoth rallies throughout China heralded Mao Tse-tung's
 support for ousted Prince Sihanouk. The occasion provided the first com-
 prehensive picture in nearly two years of China's leadership below the
 national level. It now seems apparent that Peking has been able to stabilize
 its provincial leadership in most areas, although serious problems still remain
 in some. A striking aspect of this fresh view of the leadership is the
 continued dominance of local political affairs by China's military.

 Vietnam
 The Enemy Picks the Battle Site
 Communist units carried out their heaviest
 shellings in a month in South Vietnam on 3-4 June,
 but the over-all level of fighting in the country
 remains generally low. The most effective ground
 action occurred in northern I Corps where an
 enemy battalion struck a South Vietnamese posi-
 tion, killing 43 and wounding 88. At the opposite
 end of the country, another Communist battalion
 penetrated a district town near the U Minh Forest
 but pulled out after killing or wounding nearly 50
 South Vietnamese.
 The Communist thrust into the mountain
 resort city of Dalat late last week was beaten back
 with little difficulty, but it did enable the enemy to
 grab a few press headlines. Although the attack
 may have been staged to draw allied forces from
 Cambodian operations, the enemy's commitment
 of local guerrillas against lightly defended and
 militarily unimportant Dalat was inadequate to
 accomplish such a goal.
 The effort against Dalat was essentially a
 ragtag one by 200 troops, some of whom seized a
 number of key buildings while others got lost and
 missed their intended targets. To minimize civilian
 casualties and damage to buildings, government
 forces used tear gas and smoke to rout the attack-
 ers, who lost 47 killed as compared to South
 Vietnamese casualties of 16 killed and25 wounded.
 South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) units pur-
 suing the Communists in cross-border operations in
 Cambodia are developing increased confidence and
 aggressiveness. Several high-level South Vietnamese
 officers '  " ffi&tttly-commented on the improved
 morale and combativeness of the more than 40,000
 troops in the ARVN units involved. General Lan,
 the II Corps Commander, recently declared that
 the Cambodian operations had given the ARVN
 47th Regiment a much-needed "shot in the arm."
 Previously, many of these same units had operated
 in the south largely on the defensive or in reaction
 to enemy initiatives, and some returned to their
 base camps regularly each night. Their new spirit
 may not last after they retjt'in to South Vietnam,
 but the battle experience' they have gained may
 mean a somewhat greatpff effectiveness than before
 in going after the CQihmunists in ground opera-
 tions.
 At the samftime, elements within the mili-
 tary hierarchyn Saigon are not entirely pleased
 with the pro Tess of military operations in Cam-
 bodia.
 Difficult Diplomacy
 South Vietnam and Cambodia are holding
 discussions aimed at resolving remaining differ-
 ences between them following their resumption of
 relations last week. A delegation headed by Vice
 President Ky and Foreign Minister Lam is currently
 in Phnom Penh, and further talks at the "expert"

 level are also to be held. Although agreement on
 future military cooperation is likely, the discus-
 sions may not go too smoothly regarding such
 nettlesome subjects as border delineation, joint
 exploitation of the Mekong River, and economic
 and commercial agreements.
 Antigovernment protest demonstrations in
 Saigon by Buddhist, student, and disabled veteran
 groups continued to simmer this week, but divi-
 sions within the ranks of the protesters, as well as
 the government's carrot-and-stick tactics, pre-
 vented any serious confrontations. A group of
 militant An Quang Buddhist monks held a two-day
 hunger strike; they are threatening to engage in
 further antigovernment activities if their protests
 go unheeded. These monks hope to embarrass the
 regime by playing on warweariness and publicizing
 demands that the government cease supporting the
 rival Quoc Tu Buddhist faction. The An Quang
 leadership is not united, however, and_Tri Quang,
 the faction's most prominent monk, reportedly has
 dissociated himself from theantigovernment activi-
 ties. He opposes any direct provocation of the
 government and fears that the current activities of
 the activist monks will fail to gain any substantial
 support for the Buddhists.
 Police have been able to disperse student
 protesters without violence, and their demonstra-
 tions have, for the most part, been unable to turn
 out large numbers.
 Meanwhile, a small group of disabled veterans
 broke up a ceremony last week in Saigon that was
 to allocate permanent housing for some of them.
 The demonstrators charged that the government
 was unwilling to meet their grievances. The govern-
 ment believes that this demonstration by the veter-
 ans, who had remained quiet for several weeks, was
 politically inspired to create trouble for the regime.
 Police made no arrests, however, because Prime
 Minister Khiem reportedly had ordered that no
 -force-- be used against the demonstrators.

 Cambodia: Communists Expand Deeper into the North
 Increasing numbers of enemy troops have
 infiltrated Preah Vihear and Kompong Thom
 provinces. There are no firm indications of the
 reasons for this westward movement, but one
 intention of the Communists could be to open
 access to the sizable Vietnamese community near
 the Tonle Sap and indigenous insurgents opera-
 ting in the foothills of the Chaine des Carda-
 momes of southwestern Cambodia. Kompong
 Thom city was invested by an estimated 1,000
 Communists on 4 June, and fighting continues
 there as government troops attempt to drive out
 the invading force.
 Also on 4 June, the Communists seized the
 river village and army camp of Setfo Leu, about
 10 miles southeast of Phnom Penh. This is the
 closest that enemy forces have come to Phnom
 Penh and may have been timed to coincide with
 the arrival of Vice President Ky in the capital.
 In the northeastern province of Ratanakiri,
 steady enemy pressure finally forced the govern-
 ment to abandon the town of Lomphat on 31 May
 under cover of allied air support. The two govern-
 ment battalions previously stationed at Lomphat,
 as well as most of the town's civilian population,
 moved north under fire to the besieged town of
 Labansiek, thus far protected from capture by
 regular air strikes. It is probably only a matter of
 time, however, until the government's presence in
 Ratanakiri Province is completely eliminated.
 forces. Farther south, Communist harassing activi-
 ties around Svay Rieng town indicate that enemy
 units still infest the Parrot's Beak area despite
 extensive South Vietnamese operations.
 The presence of South Vietnamese troops in
 Cambodia continues to create political problems
 for the Lon Nol regime. There reportedly is con-
 siderable argument between those junior officers
 in the army and the bureaucracy who strongly
 oppose the use of South Vietnames troops and
 those who regard it as an unfortunate necessity.
 Cambodian nationalists outside= the government
 have also expressed their discontent on this issue
 directly to Lon Nol, and anti-Vietnamese posters
 have appeared in Phnom Penh. The premier has
 not ignored these protests even though military
 expediency has caused him to rely heavily on the
 South Vietnamese. He expressed his concern over
 Saigon's overbearing attitude, and asked President
 Thieu to impress on South Vietnamese officials
 the need to consider Cambodian sensitivities in
 discharging their responsibilities vis-a-vis the war.
 South Vietnamese operations cleared Com-
 munist units out of Prey Veng city on 1 June and
 then swept up the east bank of the Mekong in an
 unsuccessful effort to trap retreating enemy

 Chinese activity to the south of Muong Sai
 since February has been limited to improving and
 surfacing the road to Muong Houn, some 30 miles
 from the Mekong. No construction or survey
 work has been observed south of Muong Houn.
 There has been a steady buildup of construction
 camps, storage sites, and AAA positions in the
 Muong Houn area, but it is unlikely that, in the
 few weeks remaining before the start of the rainy

 Laos: Action in the North
 Government units have improved their tacti-
 cal position in several sectors of northern Laos
 this week. In the Long Tieng area, General Vang
 Pao launched a three-battalion drive to retake Ban
 Na. The Communists are dug in along the rugged
 ridge lines south of Ban Na, and so far they have
 frustrated the Meo effort. Ban Na has been a
 major Communist staging area south of the Plaine
 des Jarres.
 North of the Plaine, government columns
 moved outside the Bouam Long defensive perim-
 eter for the first time in several months. Although
 substantial enemy forces are probably still in the
 Commun st c pr, ned te?I o.Y
 [                     Contested te.rmvy
 area, the clearing operation encountered only
 light resistance. It is too early to predict: that the
 threat to Bouam Long has passed, but a North
 Vietnamese sergeant captured near the base
 claimed that his regiment's orders were to with-
 draw if Bouam Long could not be overrun by the
 end of May.
 In the far northwest, Laotian Army forces
 retook the Mekong River town of Pak Tlia, which
 had fallen to the Communists on 29 April. The
 elaborate air and ground assault, sred-by
 ,   i-ar~#illery from across the border, met little or
 ! no opposition. Pak Tha is on an important Com-
 munist infiltration route into Thailand, however,
 and the Laotian Army anticipates counterattacks
 n the south, enemy troops reacted sharply
 to recent government efforts to establish ambush
 sites and mine fields near the  Se Bang Hiang
 ford on Route 23. An estimated two North Viet-
 namese battalions mounted heavy attacks to drive
 a 500-man irregular force from the area, sug-
 gesting that the Communists attach considerable
 importance to maintaining this logistic route to
 the south.
 Light skirmishing continues on the eastern
 edge of the Bolovens Plateau, where Communist
 troops are laboring to maintain a foothold. No
 new attacks have been reported near the pro-
 vincial capital of Saravane, and so far there is no
 evidence of increased logistic activity on the Se
 Kong River.

 Communist China: The Provincial Elite on Display
 The mammoth, nationwide rallies held last
 week in support of Mao Tse-tung's statement of
 20 May on Cambodia provided the first compre-
 hensive public picture of China's leadership below
 the national level in nearly two years. The hier-
 archy unveiled at the gatherings demonstrated
 that Peking has succeeded in stabilizing the pro-
 vincial leadership in most areas but in others it is
 still attempting to unravel political tangles en-
 gendered by the Cultural Revolution. Last week's
 turnouts also revealed that the provincial ap-
 paratus has filled out considerably since the ninth
 party congress in April 1969 and that local gov-
 ernment organs continue to be expanded to pre-
 Cultural Revolution size despite Peking's avowed
 policy of "streamlining" the bureaucracy.
 The most striking aspect of this latest leader-
 ship picture was its reaffirmation of the con-
 tinued dominance by China's military of local
 political affairs. In particular, the rallies con-
 firmed that major appointments and shifts of
 army officers to high-level governing positions are
 still occurring. Many of the transfers emphasize
 the trend toward greater political control by
 powerful regional military leaders over provinces
 within their sphere of influence. Thus, high-
 powered emissaries from the Canton, Shen-yang,
 and K'un-mingMilitary Regions have recently been
 assigned major civil administrative responsibilities
 in Hunan, Heilungkiang, and Kweichow prov-
 inces. Furthermore, Peking Military Region au-
 thorities were much in evidence at the rally held
 in the capital of Inner Mongolia, adding credi-
 bility to previous indications that this region has
 been politically and militarily resubordinated to
 the Peking Military Region.
 Some of the military and civilian officials
 who appeared last week had been out of public
 view for years and were presumed purged during
 the Cultural Revolution. Their reappearance at-
 tests to the regime's determination to reinstate
 substantial numbers of old-line officials whose
 expertise is sorely needed to counter the current
 weaknesses in China's local-level administration.
 Not only are former bureaucrats returning, but
 also many of the departments associated with the
 pre - Cultural Revolution government structure
 are apparently back in existence. The latest ral-
 lies, for example, indicated that in at least two
 areas the new provincial-level governments al-
 ready have more top-level executives than their
 pre-1966 counterparts.
 The regime's staffing and consolidation proc-
 ess is far from complete, however. Five provincial
 heads failed to appear at the latest turnouts, in-
 cluding three from long-troubled areas who have
 been out of sight for nearly a year. Apparently
 the latter are in dire straits politically and may
 not be returned to their posts.
 In contrast with this clarification of provin-
 cial leadership, similar gatherings in Peking this
 month have served only to cloud the picture at
 the top by providing tenuous signs that some
 political maneuvering may be under way within
 the ruling politburo. Hsieh Fu-chih, the public
 security minister and boss of the Peking munici-
 pal government, failed to attend any of the major
 rallies held in the capital since May Day and has
 now been out of public view since 19 March.
 Although there is no firm evidence that Hsieh has
 suffered a political setback, it is highly unusual
 for such an active politburo member to remain
 out  of sight so long without an explana-
 tion.                                        25X1

 Burma: Insurgent Initiatives
 Communist insurgents, who ''control a nar-
 row strip of land along the, Chinese,border, have
 conducted a number of forays outside their
 normal area of operations. The Communists
 continue to probe government defe ises and
 terrorize the populace, although they brobably
 are not interested in expanding the territory they
 control before the monsoon rains later this month
 curtail activity. The government's inability to
 prevent these attacks despite army reinforcements
 from central Burma emphasizes its tenuous con-
 trol over the northeast.
 April the insurgents raided the gem-mining center
 of Mogok and have been threatening traffic on
 the Mandalay-Maymyo road to such an extent
 that military escorts now accompany official
 travelers. In mid-May some 200 rebels attacked
 the railway station in Lashio, the principal city in
 northern Shan State, and damaged at least two
 locomotives. A group of about 300 Communists
 overran the town of Hsenwi and were dislodged
 only after repeated efforts by the army. Road
 traffic north of Lashio has been brought to a halt
 \by intensified rebel activity, with the result that
 owns are running out of diesel oil needed to
 g berate electricity. The Communists have so far
 bl cked attempts to repair destroyed bridges.
 'SBecause the government was forced to send
 additi~nal troops to the northeast this spring to
 counter.: the Communist dry-season offensive,
 military  ressure on the traditional haunts of the
 Burmese Communists in central Burma and the
 Irrawaddy Delta has been eased somewhat.
 Government operations over the past two years
 had generally, disrupted the Communist strong-
 hold in this area. Now the Communists in the
 delta near Rangoon have begun to increase the
 size of their roving bands. In early May, for
 example, a rebel force numbering some 300
 raided a town in a part of the delta over which
 Rangoon believed it had successfully reasserted its
 authority. The government, however, probably
 remains confident it can handle the very limited
 threat this Communist activity poses./

 The third anniversary of the outbreak of the Middle East war has been
 accompanied by signs of a hardening in Moscow's position on the question
 of a settlement. Soviet propaganda has returned to some of the toughest
 formulations yet on the matter of interpreting the UN Security Council
 resolution of November 1967. Pravda said earlier this week that any settle-
 ment must be achieved "without any concessions to the aggressor" and
 called for the "speediest" Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab lands as
 a first step to "open the way" to that objective.
 Moscow underlined its groyving discomfiture with the new Cambodian
 regime on 30 May by withdrawing its ambassador from Phnom Penh. The
 Soviets clearly intended this move as a rebuke to the Lon Nol government's
 ties with Saigon and Bangkok, but the Kremlin still is evidently reluctant to
 break relations and recognize Sihanouk, whom it views as an unreliable
 captive of Peking.
 The Soviets reacted to last !,week's NATO ministerial meeting in a
 somewhat less negative fashion than might have been expected. Moscow, as
 anticipated, criticized that meeting's declaration on mutual balanced force
 reductions but also said that there 4were some "interesting" and "construc-
 tive" proposals made during the NATO conclave.
 During Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's visit to Paris this week, the
 French apparently resisted pressure to make new moves to stimulate ties
 with Moscow. While Gromyko emphasized Moscow's desire for Franco-
 Soviet relations to move into a "new stage" in which already "good"
 bilateral ties would become "excellent," President Pompidou chose to
 emphosize continuity, rather than change, in French policy toward the
 USSR. The French are more eager to make progress with the Soviets on the
 Middle East and Indochina crises than to initiate or accept new programs of
 bilateral cooperation. They are also interested in impressing the Soviets with
 the enhanced possibility of a Conference on European Security if Moscow
 moves on the German and Berlin problems. Paris, however, thinks the
 Gromyko visit was useful in preparing for Pompidou's visit to Moscow in
 October.
 Soyuz-9, launched on 1 June with two men aboard, continues to orbit
 the earth in an uneventful mission. The spacecraft is expected to fly a lone
 mission of longer duration than past Soviet manned space flights. The
 longest such flight to date was five clays.
 East Germany's acting party chief Honecker (Ulbricht still seems to be
 in the USSR) has publicly rejected Chancellor Brandt's proposal at Kassel for
 the regularization of relations. He characterized Bonn's position as con-
 stituting no change from that of previous governments. Like Premier Stoph,
 however, Honecker left the door open for further contacts at a later
 date.

 Hungarian-Yugoslav Rapprochement
 Hungarian Premier Jeno Fock's visit of 2-6
 June to Yugoslavia caps a gradual rapprochement
 that has been taking place since the Warsaw Pact
 intervention in Czechoslovakia. In the broadest
 sense, this improvement reflects Hungarian pre-
 occupation with maintaining good ties with all of
 its immediate neighbors.
 While Belgrade's relations with the other
 interventionist states have either stagnated or
 deteriorated, the Yugoslavs and Hungarians have
 slowly and steadily created a modus vivendi
 taking into account postinvasion realities. Buda-
 pest's moves to restore relations with Tito prob-
 ably do not sit well with its more conservative
 allies. The East Germans, Bulgarians, and Soviets
 have, for varying reasons, demonstrated thinly
 veiled hostility for the maverick Yugoslavs. Prior
 to the Fock visit, Budapest had been very cau-
 tious of any public displays that might highlight
 its divergent policy.
 The Yugoslavs have welcomed the Hun-
 garians' moves and are now touting the relation-
 ship as a model, albeit an isolated one, of rela-
 tions with Moscow-oriented socialist regimes.
 Increased economic ties, expanded contacts
 between the foreign ministries, cultural groups,
 and front organizations, and the resumption of
 active party contacts seem to forecast even fur-
 ther improvements. As long as Moscow remains
 antipathetic toward Belgrade, however, it is
 unlikely that Kadar will resume the very active
 personal dialogue with Tito that ended in 1967.
 Other important factors drawing the two
 countries together are their mutual preoccupation
 with economic reforms and wariness of the
 "Brezhnev doctrine," which threatens the prin-
 ciple of national sovereignty in the area. Fock's
 talks with Yugoslav Premier Ribicic undoubtedly
 covered these topics.

 Swiss Referendum on Foreign Workers
 The all-male Swiss electorate will go to the
 polls on 7 June in a national referendum on a
 proposal to reduce the number of foreign workers
 in Switzerland by a third-to 600,000-over a
 four-year period. Ptrbfie -discussion ? of this so-
 caliert-'-"Schwarzenbach Initiative" has prodded
 the visually stolid Swiss into a bitter controversy.
 The proposal was initiated early last year by
 Zurich legislator James Schwarzenbach, the lone
 independent in Switzerland's 200-member Parlia-
 ment, because he believes that the government
 has lost control over immigration. To buttress his
 view, he emphasizes that in the past decade the
 percentage of foreigners rose from 9.5 percent to
 over 15 percent of the total population. Schwarz-
 enbach argues that the inflow of foreign laborers
 and their families overtaxes Swiss schooling, hous-
 ing, and transport facilities, and increases the cost
 of social and public services.
 The initiative specifically calls for limiting
 the number of foreign nationals resident in each
 canton to 10 percent of the population, with the
 exception of Geneva, which would be permitted
 25 percent because several international organiza-
 tions are located there. Also, certain types of
 foreigners, such as seasonal workers, would be
 exempted from the legal ceiling.
 The anticipated retrenchment in the foreign
 labor force plus a shortage of specially trained
 Swiss workers are causing concern to a number of
 firms. Expulsion of such a large proportion of
 foreign resident workers would have a serious
 impact on production, particularly in industries
 such as construction and hostelry, which make
 heavy use of foreign labor.
 A number of professional, management, and
 labor organizations, and all political parties and
 churches have taken strong stands urging rejection
 of the initiative, and most public opinion polls
 predict a clear defeat for the "initiative." Never-
 theless, considerable support exists among the
 more conservative elements of the population,
 particularly in the German-speaking cantons and
 among lower income and older age groups.
 In an effort to deflect support from the
 initiative and to pacify resentment against for-
 eigners, the government implemented new foreign
 labor restrictions in March. Through these new
 restrictions the annual entry quotas were reduced
 by approximately half-to 40,000--and were al-
 located by canton, rather than by industries as a
 whole. Thus, even if the Schwarzenbach Initiative
 fails, these new government restrictions will have
 a significant impact on the Swiss economy in the
 next decade.

 Romanian Floods
 Floods have already caused widespread
 damage to the economy, and new flood crests are
 expected as late as mid-June.
 The full extent of the damage cannot yet be
 calculated. Flooding of nearly six percent of the
 cultivated land and the late planting of crops will
 depress agricultural production and hard-currency
 earnings from farm exports this year. Recent esti-
 mates by the Romanian Government forecast a
 ten-percent reduction in crop production as
 compared with 1969 levels, including declines in
 corn and wheat of 12.5 percent and 25 percent,
 respectively. Reduced livestock and vegetable pro-
 duction is anticipated as well. Crop-growing con-
 ditions over the next 90-120 days will determine
 the final outcome.
 A number of smaller industrial plants have
 been damaged by the floods, and the industrial
 cities of Galati and Braila will be threatened when
 the Danube River crests. Flood damage to trans-
 portation, housing, and communications already
 is extensive. Romanian authorities now fear the
 outbreak of epidemics as a result of damage to
 water supplies and sanitary facilities.
 Fulfillment of Romania's economic plan
 for 1970 will be adversely affected. Romanian
 party chief Ceausescu optimistically stated last
 week that planned industrial targets can be met
 and that harvest prospects are "good." The vice
 chairman of the Romanian Planning Commission,
 however, asserts that the over-all industrial plan
 can be met only because increased production in
 some sectors will offset losses in others. He states
 that plan goals "definitely" cannot be reached in
 agriculture. According to the editor of Probleme
 Economice, Romania is considering an emergency
 one-year plan for 1971 rather than starting its
 new five-year plan then.
 Non-Communist countries have promised
 more relief and have provided it faster than Com-
 munist nations have. The United States, the first
 country to aid Romania, to date has sent six
 times as much aid as the USSR, the last Com-
 munist state to offer help.
 The obvious reluctance of the Soviets to
 grant aid reflects the strained relations between
 the two countries. Speculation continues about
 the purpose of the visit on 18-19 May of art
 chief Ceausescu to Moscow.
 Premier Maurer and a high-level Ro-
 manian economic delegation subsequently met
 with Premier Kosygin, but no communique was
 issued and there was no mention of an economic
 agreement. There is speculation that the USSR
 tried to get Romania to alter its independent
 policies as the price for additional Soviet sup-
 port.

 Italian Elections
 On 7 ari
 the country w
 125,000 local an
 15 new regional cd
 go to the polls to fill some
 rovincial posts and to choose
 cils. The elections will also
 ar political attitudes, par-
 serve to measure pop
 ticularly toward the po
 erful Communist party.
 The regional councils willke over a num-
 ber of the central government's  nctions, thus
 having a decentralizing effect. Th   will have
 independent financial resources, and ' 1 assume
 some police, welfare, and regional pub   works
 responsibilities. Although legislation to r elate
 the powers of the regions is not to be workecut
 until after the elections, cutoff provisions ensu
 that delay cannot be prolonged beyond two
 years.
 Extrapolations from previous election result"
 indicate that the governments of three regions .:
 the center of the country-Emilia Roma  a,
 Tuscany, and Umbria-probably will be f on-
 trolled by the Communists and their allies/pos-
 sibly including the Socialists. Communistidomi-
 nated regional governments are also a po ibility
 in Liguria and Marche. Elsewhere, the regions will
 probably be run by coalitions more or le # follow-
 ing the center-left pattern of the national gov-
 ernment.
 On the national level, the elections have par-
 ticular importance as a test of the competitive
 political strength of the center-left coalition par-
 ties and of the Communists. Voting patterns are
 usually stable in Italy, and great weight is given to
 gains or losses of even one or two percent. Con-
 sequently, small chap e . will have national reper-
 cussions, even thou  interpretation will be con-
 troversial because  f inevitable variations in the
 vote on the loca; provincial, and regional levels.
 The performance of the Unitary Socialist
 Party (PSU)b which seceded from the orthodox
 Socialists ii 'July 1969 after almost three years of
 union, is Particularly important. The PSU said it
 seceded Vecause the parent party was too willing
 to worli.'with Communists, a charge the Socialists
 denied: In any case, the PSU is waging an enthusi-
 astic .anti-Communist election campaign, attack-
 ing ;both Socialists and Christian Democrats as
 leiing too far toward the left.
 Should the PSU believe it has improved its
 staling over the six percent it polled as an in-
 depeent party in 1963, it would insist on recog-
 nition * f this enhanced position at the national
 level. I   argument would be backed by an
 implied A (eat that President Saragat, who is
 sympatheti  to the PSU, might use his con-
 stitutional p wer to move up the date for
 national parlia entary elections, which must be
 held no later tha  1973.
 On the other hand, failure of the PSU to
 increase its vote sub?tantially would tend to
 strengthen the hand of Socialists and left-wing
 Christian Democrats who favor some degree of
 acceptance of Communist cooperation in regional
 government and in the national parliament. Thus
 far, as a result of PSU campaigning, the centrist
 Christian Democrats appear to have strengthened
 their anti-Communist political line.

 The 5 June anniversary of the stars: of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war will, at
 the very least, occasion bitter rhetoric and fervent demonstrations through-
 out the Arab world. A good share of this will be directed toward the US and
 its policies in the Middle 6,ast.
 As the anniversary approached, military action was extremely heavy
 along the cease-fire lines, particularly the Suez Canal. Stung by their increas-
 ingly heavy casualties, the Israelis hit back with a series of air strikes against
 Egyptian positions along the waterway; Cairo lost three more MIG-21s in
 mid-week air clashes. Meanwhile, the State Department reports from Cairo
 that Nasir, with a growing Number of urgent issues to discuss, may be
 planning another visit to Mo?cow in the near future. Also in Cairo, the
 various fedayeen organizations'are continuing their efforts-so far without
 much success-to create a viable"coordinating body.
 The Turkish political situation remains murky but somewhat tense
 amid rumors of added pressure  n Prime Minister Demirel to resign, and
 reports of contingency planning b the military in case the government falls
 apart. The likelihood of this ha  been lessened by the passage of the
 long-delayed budget bill, clearing the way. for other "must" legislation.
 Although Demirel's position has ben seriously weakened, if he can hold on
 until parliament adjourns in July, lice will have a four-month breather to
 recoup.
 Nigerian leaders have been considering steps toward an eventual return
 to civilian rule, but the country's mappy remaining political and economic
 problems would seem to make any sur?ender of real power a long way off.
 Although General Gowon recently restiited his desire to return to a purely
 military role, he also added-for the fir"ft time-that he would reluctantly
 accept the role of chief of state if he were persuaded that the people wanted
 him to.
 In Congo (Kinshasa), Lovanium Univ'ersity students are commemorat-
 ing the anniversary of a clash with security forces on 4 June 1969 in which a
 dozen students were killed, The students'\request for an official day of
 mourning was rejected, but they were given permission for a campus proces-
 sion. Although the plans called for an orderl/, one-day ceremony, security
 forces were being held in readiness should disturbances break out.
 The Afghan Government this week had to send security forces into
 provincial centers to cope with protest demonstrations set off by ultra-

 Arab States - Israel
 Fedayeen Still Complicate Israeli-Lebanese Relations
 Tel Aviv Lontinued to send tank patrols into
 southern Lebanon this week while villagers in the
 area reportedly clashed with the fedayeen in an
 attempt to keep them from firing into Israeli
 settlements. Other villagers, said to be mainly
 Christians,. have erected road blocks and threat-
 ened to shoot ?_ommandos trying to enter village
 territory. At the same time, however, Minister of
 Interior Kamal Jumblatt appears to be softening
 the government's ban on the carrying of arms by
 Palestinians. In a press statement last weekend, he
 said the ban applied only to those Palestinians
 unable to prove their membership in a fedayeen
 organization. Privately,Jumblatt has pleaded with
 fedayeen leaders to demand a little more restraint
 from their followers.

 Crackdown on Syrian Dissidents
 Reports from Damascus suggest that there has
 been a government crackdown on Communists and
 suspect Baathists. A number of both elements have
 been arrested.
 The ruling Baath party, the only legal party in
 Syria, has tolerated the activities of the Syrian
 Communist Party (SCP) and has permitted one SCP'?,
 member to hold a cabinet post. The regime now
 may believe that the SCP has overstepped its
 bounds, however.
 Without any popular base of support, the
 government is extremely sensitive to criticism or
 opposition from any quarter. The arrest of the
 Communists may have been sparked by a recent
 press article by the party criticizing the Syrian
 military, whose support the regime must have. The
 article charged that the/1 military bourgeoisie"
 enjoys an even better life than do US military
 officers, but that this status is not deserved because
 of the military's performance during the 1967
 Arab-Israeli war. Some observers in Damascus con-
 sider the article a direct attack on Defense Minister

 Asad, who may have reacted by instigating the
 campaign against the leftists. Asad is a leading-if
 not the principal-force in the government and has

 There is also speculation that the arrests may
 be directed at the Soviet Union for its refusal to
 grant increased aid. It might also be that the Soviets
 .are pressing the Syrians for faster payment for
 previous aid deliveries.
 In addition, a number of Baathists and other
 `progressives"-both military and civilian-were
 arrested for allegedly plotting against the regime.
 Iraqi oppositionists were also said to be involved in
 this conspiracy.
 Whatever the motives behind these actions,
 the problems for the leaders in Damascus get no
 easier. The Israelis constitute the paramount
 problem, but the regime must also deal with a
 restless and repressed population. There is chronic
 coup plotting-even among members of the ruling

 with fellow Baathists in Iraq. The governme
 moreover, realizes that it has become overly de-
 pendent on the Soviet Union. For the near term,
 West African Regionalism
 Regionalism in West Africa has taken a step
 into the past with the resuscitation of a long-
 moribund customs union and its transformation
 into what is the latest of a series of proposed West
 African economic communities.
 The union, now to be known as CEAO, was
 revamped at a summit meeting of seven French-
 speaking chiefs of state in Bamako on 20 May. Its
 charter calls for cooperation in regional transpor-
 tation, trade, and industrial development, and for
 the progressive adoption of a common external
 tariff. The CEAO's predecessor organization had
 called for similar cooperation for more than a
 decade without significant result.
 The revived union is conterminous with the
 old French West Africa federation minus prodigal
 Guinea, which is not likely to join. A possible
 new member is Togo, which has a different colo-
 nial background but now has close ties with its
 French-speaking neighbors and with Paris.
 The creation of CEAO effectively kills the
 projected West African Regional Group, which
 Syria seems destined for continued instability and
 dependence on the East, despite quiet assertions
 in the past that it is eager for a. reopening to the
 West
 included both French- and English-speaking mem-
 bers. This group had been floundering rather aim-
 lessly since its creation two years ago, and several
 of the former French colonies had avoided it at
 the urging of France. Nevertheless, it clearly was a
 serious attempt at regional cooperation rather
 than a vehicle for the preservation and extension
 of special ties among the ex-French states and
 between them and the former metropole.
 Guinean President Toure, French-speaking
 Africa's most outspoken and independent leader,
 has privately taken sharp issue with this apparent
 reversion to exclusiveness. A promoter of the
 West African Regional Group, Toure responded
 to his invitation to attend the CEAO conference
 by asking why English-speaking Nigeria, Ghana,
 Liberia, and Sierra Leone had not been invited.
 Tore clearly suspects a French hand behind the
 Bamako- meeting.
 Some of the impetus for the revitalization of
 the old customs union seems to have come from

 Malawi - South Africa
 The recent visit to Malawi by Prime Minister
 Vorster of South Africa marks a high point for
 President Banda's long-held policy of cooperation
 with white-ruled southern Africa. The Vorster
 visit is a serious setback, however, for Malawi's
 efforts to improve relations with other black Afri-
 can states.
 During Vorster's three-day official visit last
 week, South African aid to Malawi was un-
 doubtedly discussed and new aid agreements may
 have been reached although none has yet been
 announced. Banda expressed his hope that the
 visit would signal the beginning of even closer
 relations between the two countries.
 Banda is opposed to the racial policies of
 white southern Africa, but he considers coopera-
 tion with these governments an economic neces-
 sity. In December 1967, Malawi established diplo-
 matic relations with Pretoria; it is still the only
 black African state that has done so. Although
 the move was anathema to black African national-
 ist sentiment, Banda has since obtained more than
 $20 million in loans from South Africa.
 The visit will largely negate Banda's attempts
 over the past year to improve relations with other
 black African states, particularly with neighboring
 Zambia and Tanzania. The government-owned
 press in Tanzania is once again lambasting Banda
 for betraying the trust his people have placed in
 him. Moreover, some members of the Organiza-
 tion of African Unity have strongly criticized
 Banda, and there are unconfirmed reports that a
 few members may call for Malawi's expulsion
 from the organization because of the Vorster trip.
 The President, however, has apparently decided
 that the advantages of closer relations with South
 Africa outweigh the risk of further isolation from
 black African states.
 Ceylon: Election Surprise
 The overwhelming victory last week of Mrs.
 Bandaranaike's United Front foreshadows at least
 a moderate trend toward the left in Ceylon's
 domestic and foreign policies.
 The 90 seats won by Mrs. Bandaranaike's
 party, which she may increase by adding six
 appointees in the 157-member legislature, repre-
 sent the largest majority any party has had since
 independence. Bolstering her position are the
 seats won by her coalition partners: 19 by the
 Trotskyite party and six by the pro-Moscow Com-
 munists.
 A definitive analysis of the United Front's
 landslide is not yet possible, but a basic cause
 may have been the coalition's ability to project a
 stronger populist appeal than former prime min-
 ister Senanayake's party, which suffers from an
 elitist  image. Mrs. Bandaranaike's campaign

 pledge to increase the rice ration, general frustra-
 tions over rising living costs, and continued high
 unemployment were probably factors contrib-
 uting to the rout. In addition, over 800,000
 newly enfranchised young people apparently
 voted heavily for the United Front.
 Mrs. Bandaranaike and her coalition partners
 campaigned on promises to nationalize banks,
 control the import-export trade, and grant recog-
 nition to East Germany, North Korea, North
 Vietnam, and the Provisional Revolutionary Gov-
 ernment of South Vietnam. The coalition also
 called for suspension of relations with Israel pend-
 ing Tel Aviv's compliance with Security Council
 resolutions.
 Several leftists have been named to impor-
 tant ministries, but the significant bloc of moder-
 ates in the cabinet could exert at least equal
 influence on the prime minister. The Communists
 received only a relatively minor portfolio, but the
 three ministries given to the Trotskyite party in-
 clude Finance and the new one of Plantation
 Industries, which presumably will implement Mrs.
 Bandaranaike's promise to exert greater control
 over foreign-owned tea and rubber plantations.
 Among the more pronounced leftist min-
 isters from Mrs. Bandaranaike's own party is T. B.
 Illangaratne, who will head the Trade Ministry.
 Illangaratne held this post during the previous
 Bandaranaike government, when he expanded
 trade with Communist countries and was the driv-
 ing force behind the nationalization of British and
 US oil distribution facilities. A possible leader of
 the moderates, who are believed to comprise
 about half of the cabinet, is Felix Dias
 Bandaranaike, a relative of the prime minister and
 head of the important Ministry of Home Affairs.
 Mrs. Bandaranaike will retain Defense and Exter-
 nal Affairs under her own guidance.
 Among the factors that could influence Mrs.
 Bandaranaike toward relative moderation is her
 party's strong majority, which makes it unnec-
 essary for her to rely on her Marxist allies for
 crucial votes. Moreover, the continuing need for
 foreign assistance may require her to avoid unnec-
 essarily antagonizing Western aid donors. The
 memory of her government's collapse in 1964 as a
 result of defections caused by her increasingly
 leftist measures might also counsel her on the side
 of caution.                                  25X1

 Uruguayan Urban Terrorism
 Uruguayan military and police forces are
 smarting over a series of successful terrorist acts
 in Montevideo by the pro-Castro Tupamaros.
 Since pulling off the largest bank robbery in
 the country's history on 4 April, this small revolu-
 tionary organization is presumed to have mur-

 subversion, and on 29 May stripped the naval
 security forces of nearly all of their arms and
 equipment without firing a shot.

 forces mounted a large search operation in the

 has been found, several hideouts were uncovered

 defeat in the elections on 1 March, was further
 wrenched by a divisive convention on 31 May. A
 moderate was elected as the new PR secretary
 general, but only after an opposing slate boy-
 cotted the convention. Leaders of the dissident
 element may challenge the legality of the conven-
 tion. The turmoil in the PR will probably encour-
 age the small but growing Christian Democratic
 Party to try to take over the leadership of the
 political opposition.

 police harshness, the Tupamaros have carried out
 three attacks that have wounded three policemen
 and two bystanders.
 The government's prestige may demand a
 shake-up in the military high command. The navy
 chief is the most likely to be replaced, but the
 newly appointed minister of defense may also be
 removed.
 As a result of recent events, public recogni-
 tion of the efficiency and capability of the Tupa-
 maros has increased. They now have a sizable war
 chest and can be expected to carry out additional
 operations.                                25X1

 Dominican Republic - OAS
 In the wake of President Balaguer's impres-
 sive re-election victory last month, his opponents
 have focused on the OAS General Assembly
 scheduled for 22 June in Santo Domingo in an
 effort to embarrass the government.
 Juan Bosch, leader of the leftist Dominican
 Revolutionary Party (PRD) kicked off the eam.-
 paign last month by warning of major protests,
 and his lead has been followed by most political
 organizations.
 Even some of the more moderate leaders
 have added their voices to the growing anti-OAS
 chorus. Rightist Augusto Lora, who finished sec-
 ond to Balaguer in the presidential contest, has
 requested that the meeting be moved elsewhere to
 avoid strife. Spokesmen from the moderate left
 Revolutionary Social Christian Party and the cen-
 trist National Conciliation Movement have voiced
 similar sentiments.
 The opposition campaign coincides with an
 unusually large flow of asylees to foreign em-
 bassies. The opposition parties are probably en-
 couraging their members to seek refuge and to
 charge the government with repression. Bosch and
 others have pointed to the asylees as proof that a
 proper climate for an international meeting does
 not exist. The publicity splash that accompanied
 the first wave of asylees has waned, however, and
 some individuals have left the embassies volun-
 tarily after receiving guarantees of their safety
 from the government. The embassies appear to be
 processing formal requests for asylum slowly, and
 the flow of "political refugees" probably will
 taper off.
 The wide-ranging objections to the meeting
 are in part a reflection of the residual bitterness
 occasioned by the OAS-sanctioned intervention in
 1965. To a great extent, however, the conference
 is simply a handy target for Balaguer's frustrated
 opponents after his easy re-election triumph in
 May. Despite the publicly expressed misgivings
 over the possibility of disorders, protests have
 been far more vocal than violent.
 Bosch's PRD has the potential to cause
 major difficulties, however, and both he and stu-
 dent leaders have warned of massive protests if
 the meeting is held. Even so, it is doubtful that
 leaders will attempt to call out the party faithful.
 Government officials have made it clear that
 troops will be put into the streets during the
 meeting and that large-scale demonstrations will
 not be permitted.
 The government's prestige is involved in its
 offer to host the meeting, and it is unlikely to
 withdraw the invitation as a result of leftist pro-
 tests. Only considerable pressure from other Latin
 governments would prompt it to reconsider its
 offer. Most Latin American governments would
 like to hold the meeting elsewhere because of the
 threat of disruption. None, however, is yet willing
 to initiate action to change the site. An OAS
 "`advance team" is in the Dominican Republic to
 make  arrangements for the  22 June meet-

 Argentine Kidnaping
 Politick stability in Argentina received a
 sharp blow  h -w         of a small extremist
 group kidnaped a   murdered the former presi-
 dent of Argentina,                 tired General Pedro Aram-
 buru. Aramburu was                 ducted on 29 May. The
 kidnapers subsequently   nounced that he had
 been tried and condemne  to death for crimes
 allegedly committed when  e headed a provi-
 sional government from 195  1958, soon after
 the ouster of ex-dictator Juan P on. On 2 June,
 the terrorists announced that Ara   uru had been
 executed. The US Embassy report that their
 military contacts believe that the in  der will
 have a far-reaching impact, wrenching o en old
 wounds between Peronists and the       mi itary.
 Although more than 20,000 military and po 'ce
 personnel searched for Aramburu, no trace of hi
 was found.
 There are many explanations for the action
 against Aramburu, some 15 years after his "al-
 leged crimes," but there is no firm evidence
 support any circulating thus far. The most lik y
 explanation is that the extremists on the Pero ist
 fringe acted to thwart the developing dia gue
 between Peronists and the Ongania gover ment
 that has centered on the reunification of the
 Confederation of Argentine Workers.
 A second explanation is that re nt rumors
 of Peron's failing health may have  recipitated
 the abduction in an effort to keep  ntrol of the
 Peronist faithful if and when Pero  dies. Present
 evidence points to extremist Pero ists, but some
 observers maintain that Trotskyi y or other revo-
 lutionaries may be responsible Their objective
 presumably would have been t undercut govern-
 ment stability by a bold mov coordinated with
 anticipated disorders on 29 May in Cordoba,
 which did not come to pass.
 Some other observers do not rule out the
 possibility that some ri   ist sector of the govern-
 ment or within Aram                                                                    ru's party is responsible,
 again probably wit  the intent to thwart any
 cooperation  be     een the government and
 Peronists.
 Whatever he motive, the murder will result
 in a strong de and from hard-line elements in the
 military fora severe crackdown on all types of
 leftist acti ties. This might even extend so far as
 the killin by vigilantes of one or more extremist
 figures i  retaliation for the execution of General

 to t  e the law into their hands, a situation of
