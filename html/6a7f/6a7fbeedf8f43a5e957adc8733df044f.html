 This report represents the results of a preliminary
 investigation of Communist China's economic organization,
 the effectiveness of this structure as a tool of management,
 and the degree of Soviet control and influence over the
 Chinese Communist government.  The importance of Soviet in-
 fluence as a factor in directing the Chinese economy prompted
 the inclusion of the formal framework of Sino-Soviet joint
 companies as instruments of Soviet coat"rol.

 SECURITY Il~'ORMATION
 ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION OF COMMUNIST CHINA*
 S~rv
 The economic organization of Communist China is one superimposed after
 the ravages of war on a country whose limited industrial and commercial
 development had been largely the work of foreign capital.  The theoretical
 basis for, and the government framework of, the economic organization of
 Communist China were established in September 1949.  Control is maintained
 through the customary Communist adherence to "parallelism" and "democratic
 centralism."
 Basic decisions are made by a small group of leaders in the Communist
 Party's Politburo and the Communist Party~s Central Committee and chan-
 neled down through the Party and state administrative organs for implementa-
 tion.
 While the Organic Law adopted in 1949 establishes the supreme govern-
 mental authority in the All-China People's Congress, no date has yet been
 set for the election of this body.  Original authority was exercised by
 the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at the 1949
 meeting, and subsequent meetings were scheduled for every 3 years.  At
 the original meeting the CPPCC elected the Central People's Government
 Council (CPGC), which is, in fact, the highest executive agency of the
 government when it is in session.  Otherwise, authority is centered in the
 Government Administrative Council (GAC), which resembles the Soviet Council
 of Ministers.  Within the GAC is established the important Coa~ittee of
 Finance and Economics (CFE), which supervises, directs, and controls the
 Chinese ecor~a~y through 13 economic ministries.
 Economic planning in China has been applied unevenly and incompletely,
 largely because of the mixed economy consisting of state and private enter-
 prise and because of administrative incompetence and $nexperience.  No Five
 Year Plan has yet been formulated, although the provision for such s Plan
 exists in the Common Program.
 ~' This report contains inforffiation available to CIA as of 1 July 1952.  It
 does not include certain minor changes in organization reported to have been
 made since that date.

 Soviet influence has penetrated all branches of the Chinese economy
 through the expanding role played by Soviet technicians and advisers.
 In addition, through point Sino~oviet companies, the LTSSR has direct
 control over important segments of the economy, especially i.n P;anchuria
 and in Sinkiang Province.
 The most important element of strength in Communist China's economic
 organization is the increasing concentration of control.  This control
 has permitted the introduction of uniform methods and procedures, facil-
 itated the adoption of Soviet organizational and management techniques,
 and provided increased opportunity to apply experiences gained in
 I~ianchuria to the Less highly developed areas of China.
 Elements of weakness exist in Communist China's economic organization
 which counterbalance the factors of strength to a considerable degree.
 There is evidence of poor planning, administrative conflicts, and duplica-
 tion of effort.  Tendencies toward overstaffing, corrupt ion, and low
 performance standards in the state administration have not been overcome.
 In addition, traditional Chinese dislike of the USSR and all Soviet
 administrators is a potential limitation to an effective liaison between
 Communist China. and the USSR.
 I.  Introduction,
 The economic organization of Communist China is one superimposed by
 the regime in Peking (Peiping)# on a country ravaged by war, whose limited
 industrial and commercial development had been largely the work of foreign
 capital.  The Communist Party of China formulated the theoretical basis
 and established the governmental framework of the economic organization of
 Communist China.  As is customary in Communist-dominated areas, the Party
 usually maintains its controls by adherence to. the principles of "parallelism"
 and "democratic centralism."  "Parallelism" means that the organizational
 structure of the Party "parallels" that of the national Government, with the
 head of a Party agency usually serving as the administrator of a similar
 agency in the governmental structure.  Even at regional and local levels,
 ranking Party 'officers occupy comparable administrative posts.  Tor example,
 #  Communist China has reverted to the ancient spelling, Pei-ching ("Northern
 Capital"), since the Communists have established the seat. of the government
 there.  About 1928 the government of China had .changed the name to
 Pei-ping ("Northern Peace"), as Nanking (Nan-Ching) was the capital city.

 Rao Rang is both chairman of the Manchurian Peoples Government and
 secretary of the Manchurian Party bureau.
 The theoretical basis for, and the governmental framework of, the
 economic organization of Caennuniat China were established at a meeting
 of the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in
 September 1949.  At this meeting, which took place only a few months after
 the decisive capture of Shanghai by Chinese Communist troops (Map 1949),
 the CPPCC adopted its own Organic Law, its Common Program, and the Organic
 Law of the Central Peoplets Goverrmment of the Peoples Republic of China.
 None of the three basic documents represents the equivalent of a
 constitution in the accepted meaning of the term, but taken together they
 constitute a statement of the philosophy of the new rulers, an outline of
 their program, and a basis for the structure of the new governing body.
 These documents do not reflect a permanent set of principles, because the
 Communist point of view is that China is entering a long transitional
 period on the way to Socialism and eventual Communism.
 In its own 0 rganic Law the CPPCC (which has since been named a council
 instead of a conference) authorized itself to exercise the authority de-
 legated to the A 11-China Peoples Congress, the supreme organ of the state,
 until such time as the membership of the Congress can be duly elected and
 convened.  The CPPCC meets evexq ~ years.  When it is not in session, its
 National Committee, which meets semiannually, is authorized to act in its
 stead.  After the convening of the All-Chins Peoples Congress, for :which no
 date has been set, the CPPCC will act only in an advisory capacity.
 The Common Program adopted by the CPPCC consists of a manifesto of 60
 articles taken largely from Mao Tse-tung~s New Democratic Program and sets
 forth the Communist program in the field$ of goverim-ent, economic affairs,
 culture and education, national minorities, and foreign affairs.  (See
 Appendix A.)  The Common Program defines the various sectors of the national
 economy as staterowned, cooperative, and state-capitalist.  The last sector
 represents mergers of private capital with state capital.  All three sectors
 are to be expanded, but the expansion of the staterowned sector is to be
 emphasized.  The sectors comprising the peasantry and the handicraftsmen are
 also encouraged by the land reform program, but coirtrol is exercised through
 mutual aid teams and cooperatives.  The basic objective is to regulate and
 coordinate all sectors of the economy in accordance with state plans.

 Communist Party discipline is maintained through the principle of
 "democratic centralism," which requires that the individual moat obey
 the Party directives, that the minority must obey the majority, that
 the lower echelon must obey the higher echelon, and that the entire
 Party must obey the directives of the Central Committee. 7J#
 Basic decisions originate in?the inner core of the Party leadership.
 These are channeled down through the hierarchy of both Party and govern-
 ment for implementation.  Frequently, directives are issued as the joint
 action of Party and government, especially at the regional and local levels.
 Copies of governmental directives are frequently distributed through-the
 hierarchy of the Party.
 Throughout the economy, in the factories as well as in the villages,
 leadership is supplied by the Communists.  The extent of such leadership
 varies in different areas.  In Manchuria, where Party control over the
 economy is most firmly established, regional conferences? were held in t~iay
 1951 which emphasized the need for Party direction and guidance in the
 interest. of increased production.  The framework and functions of the
 Central Peoples Government of the Peoplets Republic of China are set forth
 in the Organic Law promulgated by the CPII';C in September 19.9.  At the top
 of the government is the Cen+,ral Peoples Government Council (CSC), which
 is elected by the CPFCC.  The CPGC consists of a chairman (Mao Tse-tung)~
 b vice-chairmen, and 5b members.  It has legislative, executive, and
 judicial powers and has the final word on the national budget.  1   Its
 closest counterpart in the USSR is the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of
 the USSR.
 The CPGC in turn organized thh major subordinate agencies prescribed
 by the Organic: Law, which included the Government Administrative Council
 (GAC) as the supreme administrative authority; a Peoples Revolutionary
 Military Council (Ai.P~) as the supreme military command; a Supreme Peoples
 Court (S PC); and a Peoples Procurator General (PPG), who was placed in
 charge of a hierarchy of public prosecutors. ~/  The function of the
 traditional Chinese censorate was given to the Committee of Peoples Super-
 vision set up under the immediate jurisdiction of the GAC.  The Organic Law
 states that the Committee of Peoplets Supervision, which is patterned after
 the Soviet Ministry of State Control, is responsible for supervising the
 execution of duties by government institutions and functionaries.

 The Central People's Government Council (C PGC) is scheduled to meet
 only once every 2 months, and executive control of the government is vested
 in a series of subordinate committees.  The executive control of civil
 administration is in the hands of the GAC, which is the Chinese equivalent
 of the Soviet Council of Ministers.  The GAC is responsible for planning
 and directing practically all economic activity, through the economic
 ministries and other subordinate agencies,  (See Fig. 1.)
 In descending order, the governmental hierarchy which is responsible
 for economic affairs may be summarized as follows: !~,/
 1.  China People's Political Consultative Council (CPC ).
 2.  Central People's (,overnment Council (C PGC) .
 3.  Government Administrative Council (GAC).
 1,..  Committee of Finance and Economics  (CF'E) .
 5.  N:inistries of the Central Feople's Government.
 6.  P-?ilitary and Administrative Committees (Administrative Regions).
 7.  Provincial People's Government.
 8.  Asian People's Government.
 9.  Municipal Peoples Government.
 The actual functioning of this hierarchy is determined by the "parallel"
 activities of the Chinese Communist Party.  Although not a part of the
 government, the Central Committee of the Party and its powerful agency, the
 Central Political Bureau (~blitburo), direct the state's executive organs
 and.are superior to the highest governmental bodies. ~  In consequence of
 the Party's policy~naking and supervisory role, the activities of the
 governmental bodies are largely formal and meetings are held mainly to listen
 to official reports, to sanction decisions already made, and to approve
 appointments already filled.

 II.  Economic Planning in Communist China.
 The Chinese Communist concept of economic planning is expressed in
 the Common Program.  A system of controls over the collection and distribu-
 tion of raw materials and finished products, as called for i.n the Common
 Program, interferes with normal market functions.  This system of controls,
 coupled with the mixture of public and private enterprise, has resulted ixi
 uneven and incomplete application of the principles of planning.
 A.  Development of Planning.
 Plans for control of private enterprise were developed in two stages.
 The first consisted of a complete inventory to be taken of all goods and
 commodities held by state enterprises, and the second was the requirement
 that all transactions with state enterprises be made in accordance with the
 special directives of the Committee of Finance and Economics (CrE).
 Under the provisions of a directive of 10 PSarch 1950, state trading
 companies were authorized to centralize the collection and distribution of
 most important raw materials and finished products.  Domestic state trading
 companies, nation-wide in scope with branches in local areas, were set up
 under the T~linistry of Trade. ~  The original companies were the General
 Grain Trading Company, the General Salt Company, the General Coal Company.
 (including building materials), the General Cotton Cloth Company, the
 General I~ierchandise Company, and the General Domestic Products Company. :Fore
 the purpose of establishing controls over foreign trade, similar companies
 were established, each to handle foreign trade in such fields as hog bristles,
 oils and fats, tea, mineral products, native products, and imported products.
 All transactions of these state trading companies were conducted on
 a contractual basis with specifications, among other things, for quaxitity,
 quality, price, and the means of transportation.  In addition,?these
 contracts were paid, not in currency, but by drafts drawn on the People~s?
 Bank, where all state funds were deposited and where all accounts-could be
 scrutinized.  In this manner the Communists expected to establish controls

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/23: CIA-RDP79R01141A000100150001-2
 gradually 'over the entire economy as the trade of the state trading
 companies increased.  P1o transaction, whether government or non-
 government, was possible without the approval of the Ministry of Trade,
 in whose jurisdiction these trading companies were placed.  Thus the
 Ministry of Trade became one of the key ministries in the development of
 economic planning. ,v
 The influence of the Ministry of Trade was extended by the in-
 clusion of price control in the list of its functions,  This function was
 to be exercised through the state trading companies.  In this manner, price
 leadership was established by the state sectors. of the economy, including
 the cooperatives, and was followed by the private traders.  The acceptance
 of price leadership influenced the pattern of production of private enter-
 prises by discouraging the manufacture of unprofitable items.  Thus items
 on the Communist list of luxury goods were deliberately priced below cost
 in order to stop their production.
 F.  P annin~ Process.
 Plans are prepared in two phases, each on the basis of annual,
 seasonal, and monthly periods.  One phase deals with ;projected expenditures
 of the state trading companies; the other phase determines the allocation
 of materials in quantitative terns.  The planned expenditures are prepared
 and reported by the local subsidiaries of the state trading companies and
 forwarded to the state trading companies for approval and submission to the
 I~~inistry of Trade for final acceptance and implementation.  This financial
 planning includes expenditures for materials, for labor and managerial
 supervision, and for plant expansion.  Limits are set to the funds which
 can be transferred to private business firms.
 Plans for the allocation of materials are drafted by the Ministry
 of Trade after convening all high-level government agencies interested in
 the over-all distribution of resources controlled by the state.  In this
 conference the share of state resources to be turned over to the Ministry
 of Trade for allocation is determined.  The Pinistry then distributes its
 allotment to the state trading companies, which perform the final alloca-
 tions to the local subsidiary companies in accordance with policy pre-
 scribed at the time by the riinistry.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/23: CIA-RDP79R01141A000100150001-2
 Obviously, conflicts arise between the financial plan and the
 allocation of materials plan.  Control over the availability of goods,
 however, sets the limits to the amounts which can be purchased by the
 state trading companies.  Thus the financial plan is subject to adjust-
 ment in order to conform to the materials plan.  The financial plan is
 aimed at the internal policy of the state trading companies, while the
 allocation of materials is aimed at directing the over-all pattern of
 operation of the companies.-
 In addition, there were indications in 1950 that the Central
 Planning Bureau of the CFE was drafting a Five Year Flan as well as an
 annual plan. ~/  Delay in announcing such a long-range plan may reflect
 Chinese Communist administrative difficulties, technical limitations,
 and the impact of the Korean conflict.
 The planning process has been applied to regional plans, the
 most important of which has been developed in Tlanchuria.  There the local
 Cor~unist regime, apparently with Soviet assistance, launched a re-
 construction plan in 1947, 2 years before the establishment of the Central
 Government. 10   :~anchuria's industrial potential, the predominance of
 state enterprises, and other factors have facilitated I~;anchuria's planning.
 There are indications that the pattern of planning in A'anchuria is being
 ;radually extended to all of Communist China.
 In some insta-ices, increased production targets have been adopted
 at top levels in the absence of any specific program for the attainment
 of such goals,  Official and press statements are frequently issued ex-
 tolling the general principles of cost reduction, increased labor pro-
 ductivity, and better techniques for plan fulfillment.  Responsibility
 for increasing production appears to fall in large measure on regional and
 local administrators.  Special campaigns are pro3ected from time to time in
 order to stimulate production and to augment state resources.  although
 these campaigns are not formally identified with planning, their objectives
 are closely associated with plan fulfillment and with the upward revision.
 of production targets.  Examples for such campaigns, are the "increased pro-
 duction and austerity" drive of 1951 and the 1952 movement against waste,
 corruption, and kindred hindrances.

 III,  Kev Economic Ministries of tie Chinese Cozrununist Government.
 The principal economic agencies of the Chinese Communist Government
 are 13 economic ministries, the Peoples s Banl~, and the ~~"aritime Customs
 Administration, under the Committee of Finance and Economics.  The
 industrial ministries include .those for Heavy Industry, Fuel Industry,
 Textile Industry, and Light Industry.  The 2~inistry of Food Industry,
 established after the original 13, was abolished in 1950.
 The chief function of the economic ministries, according to the
 Organic Law, is to "direct their respective departments of state administra-
 tion." 11   They are empowered to announce decisions, issue orders, and.
 supervise implementation of those orders,  Legally and practically, they
 are subject to direction and supervision by higher bodies,  The ministries
 may make suggestions which, if approved, become the basis for action.  Their
 appointive power apparently is limited to the appointing of chiefs and deputy
 chiefs of sections and of other units below the bureau level.  These appoint-
 ments must be reported to the GAC,
 The general internal structure of ministries was established by the
 Government Administrative Council (GAC) in December 1949.  According to these
 regulations, a ministry may establish a general office, ~  In practice,
 this office is usually a staff office or secretariat, occupying a unique
 position directly under the minister and vice ministers,  It is concerned
 largely with assisting the minister in matters of internal administration.
 On the level below the minister are three possible types of units:
 (1) units in charge of specific functions; (2) semi-independent units some-
 times called central bureaus; and (3) special-purpose units such as account-
 ing, legal, and administrative units,  These three types represent the
 equivalent of staff, line, and housekeeping units.  They are usually sub-
 divided into other units, which also may include subordinate units.
 Unfortunately, Chinese terminology authorizes the use of certain of the
 same words to apply to these second- and third-level units,
 There are two types of economic ministries concerned with matters of
 local administration.  Some ministries! such as the Pinistry of Pailways,
 have district bureaus operating directly under the main office in Peking and
 subject to very little guidance from the regional governments.  Most min-
 istries, however, manage their enterprises indirectly through the regional
 governments, which have departments and bureaus patterned after the state and
 municipal government structure. 11   Consequently, there is a considerable

 hierarchy of administrative organs from Central Government levels to the.
 local enterprise.  Whether exercised directly or indirectly, the Central -
 Government~s authority is manifested at all levels, and individual state
 enterprises generally are under. strict centralized control.  Private enter-
 prises necessarily are controlled through other means..
 Commnmists generally head the most important economic ministries.  (See
 Appendix B.)  In same instances non-C-cmrim~nists are in charge, but they ar?
 controlled b9 Ca~anunist vice-ministers. ` In others, non-Co~mauniats. outnum-
 t~er the Caamnunists at top levels, but they are nevertheless under strict
 Communist control.  Although tfie particular Communists in control cannot
 always be identified, such internal control exists, supplemented by further
 controls exercised through higher governmental organs and the Communist Party.
 A.  M  istrv off Railwavs.
 The Ministry of Railways (see Fig. 2) administers the state-owned
 railway system, Communist China's most important transportation network..
 Since its establishment in October 1949 the Ministry has been assigned high
 priority tasks With regard to restoration of the main railways and construe-
 tion of new lines in accordance with a 5-year railway plan. ~/  This plan
 provides, in part, for establishment or completion of railways from Peking
 to points on the Northwest China-JSSR border and from. Northwest China to
 the Indo-China frontier.  Parts of this program have .been incorporated in
 the annual plans and have already been carried out.

 way operatio"ns, rolling stock, and maintenance in 1950. ~  If so, such an
 extensive responsibility may indicate a paucity of capable railway admnis-
 trators, at least during the first year of the existence of the Central
 Government.
 ~  Indications are that the plan was announced in July 1949 prior to
 establishment of the Central Government.

 In addition to the various bureaus concerned with rail~rag ,
 oper?tions arad servicing, there are the usual coordinati~ _ s-taffy
 unite for finance, planning, and personnel.  There are also tc~o ~inits,
 which have police and-political functions.  The Public Security B~zreau`
 supervises the railway guards crarged-with protecting the railway*s.
 The political Department, assuming that it is similar to other such
 units in Chinese Communist administration, is engaged in political, in-
 telligence, and control activities, with~speciel reference to railway
 personnel.                         -
 At local levels the railways generally are ad~i.nis~tered
 directly by the r'tinistry through-Railway Control Eureaus or Railway
 Administrations located in important railway centers.  These bureat~a, in
 turn, have autlprity over sub bureaus or breusch offices located. in .areas
 subject to the bureaus jurisdiction.  In F-pril 1950 the Ministry
 established a Special Commissioner's office in Tlanchuria. ~/  This offide~-
 has jurisdiction over railway control bureaus managing the Chinese$ot~ed
 railways in I-'anchuria.
 Apparently, in connection with efforts at increased centrali-
 zation and more effective control, there have been several consolidations
 and administrative changes in railway control bureaus and branch offices
 since T949.  AIthough the I~ariister of Railways stated in October 1951
 that a unified control system was established when the various railways
 were taken over, recent indications of consolidations and other changes in
 control offices in Plorth China indicate that the local administrative
 structure is still being altered to meet demands for more effective
 management. 18
 Although local railway administration is handled prima~ilj by
 the 2diriistry of Railways own offices, local governments and local
 communications departments are also utilized, especially in connection
 with railway construction and maintenance.  Through these,channels such
 local resources as labor and supplies are made available to the Iinistry.
 Although these processes involve indirect controls and more complex
 administrative relationships, there is evidence that the hierarchy of
 governmental and party organs generally assures adequate local support for
 the Ministry's projects.
 +~  Established about the same time as the joint Sino~Soviet Chinese
 Changchun Railway .off ices, this off ice probably has represented the-Ministry
 in matters relating to that railway.

 2.  administrative Problems.
 In China the Soviet pattern of railway administration was
 first established in rlanchuria.  It is being introduced gradually
 throughout China, and many administrative problems exist.  With regard
 to management techniques, for example, the P?inistry of Railways initiated
 the cost accounting system for its area control bureaus in July 1951 and
 planned to introduce it at lower levels during 1952.  If the result is
 similar to Chinese Communist experience with other Soviet techniques, the
 ~~iinistry will be trying for several years to put this system into effective
 operation throughout Communist China.  Communist realization of this
 possibility is indicated by a high official's statement of October 1951
 stressing the need for the Chinese to exert themselves to learn from Soviet
 technicians, l~
 In October 1951 the Minister of Railways stated that. poor
 planning and faulty construction work had characterized operations.
 Apparently this unsatisfactory record, among others, was responsible for
 the special directive of 10 August 1951 issued by the Committee of Finance
 and Economics (CFE) wherein it was noted that only 60 to 70 percent of the
 funds allotted for construction purposes during 1950 and the first half of
 1951 had been accounted for by the various ministries.  Plans often were
 not made or approved in advance ~f work, planning and work were undertaken
 simultaneously or in inverse order, and planning generally fell short of
 requirements.  I~iuch waste resulted.  The directive required the ministries
 to make reports on their projects, to improve procedures, and to submit to
 increased centralized control. 20
 Further evidence of the shortcomings of the h'inistry of Rail-
 ways is found in the Gctober 1951 statement regarding 1952 plans.  The
 N:inister promised construction planning would get under way with renewed
 efforts to obtain qualified technicians for making the necessary in-
 vestigations and surveys, preparing the designs, and planning the budgets.
 He also promised to eliminate the system of merchant contracting and to
 establish state design and construction enterprises to carry out construc-
 tion projects.  It appears that these efforts will not resolve the problems
 involved.
 A Communist article on the P'orthwest Railway Administration
 Engineering Department's bad planning of early 1951 reported that "an ex-
 tremely chaotic and confusing situation existed.  Funds were available
 but the Department did not know what kind of materials to buy,  taterials
 were available but the Department did not know whether they were the

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/23: CIA-RDP79R01141A000100150001-2
 proper engineering materials.  There was work to be done but the Department
 could not find enough manpower.  There was manpower available but no work
 scheduled.  In such cases as these, the errors had to be corrected;
 Although these administrative weaknesses relate chiefly to
 planning and construction, they probably reflect a general condition in
 the Ministry.  In some degree these difficulties may arise from efforts to
 impose a Soviet administrative pattern on Communist Chinese personnel.
 3.  Personnel.
 The Ministry of Railways is headed by prominent Communists
 who formerly headed the railway department of the Communist Pasty's Revolution-
 ary Military Council.  Tinister T'eng Tai-yvan, a former military commander,
 reportedly studied in the USSR during the 1930'x. .Vice-Minister Lu Cheng-
 ts'ao, also a former commander, served as Director of Communications in the
 regional Manchurian government. 2~  Vice-Minister Wu Ching-t'ien similarly
 headed the North China regional government's Communications Department in
 1948-49.  As previously noted, these Vice-24inisters concurrently direct
 important units in the Ministry.  Their background indicates that these men
 personally, as well as officially, may be strong advocates of Soviet
 administrative patterns.
 However, Vice-Minister Shih Chin-den, a US-educated .engineer,
 is a former Nationalist China railway administrator.
 50X1
 Shin was then free from
 50X1
 interference in his direction of important technical operations. ~  His
 responsibilities may since have been curtailed.  In any case, he evidently
 has little influence in top-level councils..  Moreover, his usefulness will
 probably diminish with the further adoption of Soviet railway techniques.
 W=-
 There is little evidence of important changes in personnel in
 the Ministry's central offices, although a new director of the Pub11c Security
 Bureau was appointed in December.  Many shifts have occurred ~iri the area
 and local offices, reflecting organizational changes.  In view of the
 Ministry's shortcomings and the presence of ex-Nationalist officials, the
 turnover of personnel is likely to be considerably increased during the next
 2 years.                      .

 over ocean and inland navigation, merchant shipping, highways, and civil
 aviation.  Tts area of responsibility includes not only the basic trans-
 port facilities, such as waterways and roads, but also the transport
 enterprises which utilize these facilities,  In addition, the Ministry is
 concerned with manufacturing and servicing activities in certain transport
 fields such as merchant shipping.
 1.  St~eture.              _
 The Minister of Communications is assisted by two vice-ministers.
 In addition to the Planning Office and other staff offices, it has functional
 bureaus of civil aviation, shipping control, navigation, navigation engineer-
 ing, river transportation, public roads, and transportation.  Each of these
 presumably is subdivided into additional units.
 Local administration is carried out in part through the com-
 munications departments and bureaus of the governments of the administrative
 regions, provinces, and municipalities.  Civil aviation, however, is
 administered from Peking through the Ministry's district bureaus.  Likewise
 these are indications that the local bureaus of shipping controls, navigation,
 and inland navigation are administrative units belonging to the Ministry.
 Whether administration is carried out directly by the local units
 of the Ministry of Communications or indirectly through the regional govern-
 ments, there appears to exist. a hierarchy of organs with both authority and
 initiative emanating from top levels of the administration.  Within the
 framework of established programs the Ministry's central bureaus and, to a
 lesser extent, its local branches and the local government units may wo rk out
 details of implementation and. offer specific auggest?ions on either local or
 national matters.  In order to enlist support .for its programs and to offer
 some appearance of consultation with local officials and others concerned,
 the Ministry has convened national conferences such as that of December 1949
 on shipping and highways. ~  The Planning Office may be assumed to be
 responsible for technical preparation of planning programs, although it
 appears likely that the functional bureaus have the main voice in deciding
 planning details within their particular fields of responsibility.

 2.  Admir~,ist~  rgttive Problems,
 Administrative weaknesses and Communist efforts to remedy them
 are reflected in the handling of the Tangku Harbor project, intended to
 provide Tientsin with a deep port capable of accommodating large ships.
 This project has been the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications
 since 1949.  In August 1951 the Government Administrative Council (GAC) took
 action on the matter.  According to the GAC'a resolution, the Tangku Engineer-
 ing Bureau lacked sufficient equipment, ships, cadres, and technical resources
 to carry out the work. ~  In order to mobilize more effectively both central
 and local governmental resources, the GAG then created a Tangku Harbor Commis-
 sion directly under the Ministry of Communications and gave it full respon-
 sibility for supervision of the project.  High officials of the Ministry and
 and Tientsin Municipal Government were included in the Commissions membership.
 Moreover, the Tangku Engineering Bureau, placed directly under the new
 Commission, was given new leadership.  The GAC~s resolution called for com-
 pletion of the work by the winter of 1952 so that ships up to 10,000 gross
 registered tons could utilize the new harbor.  This resolution. indicates be-
 lated high-level recognition of poor management on the parts of the Ministry
 and the local bureau in their efforts to carry out an important undertaking,
 Moreover, responsibility for ineffective planning and administration in this
 instance is not entirely the Miniatry~s failure -- the blame belongs partly to
 the GAC
 3.  PeraSnnel.
 The Ministry of Communications apparently lacks competent direction
 at the ministerial level.  Presumably, this deficiency is counterbalanced by
 reliance on control exercised by Communists occupying nominally secondary
 positions and by dependence on administrators in the various offices and bureaus.
 A further possibility is that top-level direction?is actually accomplished
 through some other ministry, perhaps the Nfinistry of Railways.
 Of the top officials, Minister Chang Po-chun and Vice-Minister
 Chi Fang are minor Party leaders whose influence on policy is necessarily
 slight, ~  Changes lack of prior administrative experience is a further in-
 dication that he is a mere figurehead,  vice-Minister Li Yun-ch'ang,

 a Communist general, lacks party stature as well as nonmilitary
 administrative eocperience.  His presence may indicate a close relation-
 ship between the Ministry of Communications and the offices of the People's
 Revolutionary Military Council (PRMC).  Chang Wen-ang, director of the
 Staff Office, may be a key Comznuniat official, especially since he pre-
 viously served as Deputy Minister of Communications in the. North China
 People's Government.
 It may be assumed that many experienced officials, including
 former executives and managers in transport enterprises, are in the
 functional bureaus, and that a large proportion of the technical staffs
 are former Nationalist China employees.  The considerable number of per-
 sonnel ahi.f"ts announced in October 1951 may indicate Communist efforts to
 eocpand or otherwise strengthen certain bureaus, notably the Bureau of
 Shipping Control, the Bureau of Navigation Engineering, and the Bureau of
 Transportation. 27   Although no dismissals or resignations were then
 publicized, it is likely that a significant turnover in personnel may have
 occurred.  Moreover, such shifts and changes are likely to be accentuated
 during the neact 2 years as the Communists attempt to increase their con-
 trol over transportation, to eliminate political unreliables, and to in-
 stall men indoctrinated and trained~in Coommunist techniques.

 The Ministry of Heavy Industry (see Fig. 4) is the most important
 of the four industrial ministries.  The Ministry has jurisdiction not
 only over heavy industries such as steel and chemicals but also over mining
 enterprises in all fields except coal, petmievm, and allied fuels, which
 are under the Ministry of Fuel Industry. 28   Apparently the Ministry, at
 least until 1951, was also concerned with certain segnents of the ship-
 building industry, .although shipbuilding is also of concern to the Ministry
 of Communications.

 The Ministry's units include the usual Staff Office, as
 well as offices or departments for planning, personnel, accounting, in-
 spection, and management.  There are functional bureaus for the aviation,
 chemical, nonferrous metals, steel, machine, ordnance, and shipbuilding
 industries.  It may be assumed that these bureaus and off ices are divided
 into appropriate functional and staff subunits.  The aviation and ordnance
 units may have been established during 1951.  If so, their functions
 probably were performed previously by less publicized organs, possibly
 under the direction of the Peoples Revolutionary r.ilitary Council (PR.P~ ).
 At local levels the work of the ~;inistry of Heavy Industr-~r is
 accomplished mainly through the regional and local industry departments,
 which also serve the other industrial ministries.  Trese industry depart-
 ments nary from region to region, but generally their administrative
 structure resembles that of the national Ministry.  In r4anc~uria, for
 example, the industry department has 13 functional units, including machine
 manufacturing and chemical industry bureaus and large enterprises such as
 the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. ~  Not all of the 13 are concerned with
 heavy industry.  In North China, a region controlled directly by the Central
 Government, the Ministry apparently exercises closer supervision over heavy
 industry enterprises.
 2,  Administrative Problems.
 Efforts at investigation and control of industrial enterprises
 are .reflected in recent evidence regarding a unit called the Industrial
 Inspection Passion, said to have been organized in late 1951 fox the pur-
 pose of visiting enterprises in the various regions. ~  The Mission had
 broad authority in checking on production capacity and methods, technical
 problems, labor matters, and general conditions.  The group reportedly
 assigned to East China included a deputy minister, the Director of the Plan-
 ing Department, officials from various functional bureaus, and Soviet
 technicians.  In addition there were officials and Soviet technicians from
 the other industrial ministries and representatives of the Committee of
 Finance and Economics (CFE) and the All-China Federation of Labor.  Although
 information is lacking on the Missions activities and findings,-the maneuver
 probably reflects an attempt on the-part of the Chinese Communist Government
 to deal with administrative weaknesses at the local or plant levels.

 The importance and wide scope of these weaknesses are
 indicated by official and press statements.  In December 1951, for ex-
 ample, a leading paper enumerated many defects in heavy industry enter-
 prises administered by the East China Department of Industry.  The
 reported faults included such items as poor organization of production
 facilities, ineffective planning, waste of labor and materials, poor
 organization of functional administrative units, and undue delays in ex-
 ecuting orders for shipment of products. ~  The public admission of such
 basic faults indicates that, with due allowance for Communist self-
 criticism, administration and. management of East China heavy industries
 are at a low level of efficiency and that numerous problems remain to be
 solved.
 In July 1951 the Ministry of Heavy Industry itself, responding to
 a directive from the CFE,investigated the handling of construction projects
 during 1950 and the first half of 1951.  The Ministry reported that in
 building new plants there were, among other difficulties, poor and hasty
 planning, waste because of changes in plans or operations and lack of
 systematic organization and control. ~  More specifically, the planners
 failed to develop in advance a precise plan with proper estimates on finance,
 equipment, labor, techniques, technical assistance, and the types of mate-
 erials to be imported.  Apparently plans were made involving use of WesteY'n
 machinery or, in other cases, Soviet Bloc machinery, with little regard for
 their respective availability.  In regard to restoration and expansion of
 existing plants, similar faults aristed, including persistence in hasty and
 wasteful expansion despite disapproval, in certain cases, by the CFE.  Mush
 of this trouble was attributed to overzealous leaders who tried to build or
 pcpand local enterprises in disregard of general plans and of higher
 authorities.  The Ministry asserted that unless competent plans could be
 worked out by Chinese technicians, complete reliance should be placed on
 foreign (presumably Soviet) experts.
 Still further weaknesses were discovered.  Within the Ministry
 of Heavy Industry the work was not well organized, the division of labor was
 not clearly defined, and efficiency was not high,  At lower levels, many
 projects were below standard in both quality and quantity.  Moreover,
 corruption was reported in regard to purchase and construction contracts.
 Although this official review of problems dealt specifically
 with construction activities, apparently similar weaknesses and faults
 generally beset the Ministry and the local organs through which the heavy

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/23: CIA-RDP79R01141A000100150001-2
 industries are administered.  Shortcomings with regard to planning, control.
 of plans, and general lack of efficient organization and manageffient at
 various levels are particularly significant of weakness,-'as is the Ministry's
 dependence on Soviet advisers and technicians.
 3.  ~grsonnel.
 With one exception, the top officials of the Ministry of Heavy
 Industry are prominent Communists. 3y,/  Ch'en Yun, Minister until April 1958,
 still a Vice-Premier and chairman of the powerful CFE, apparently was the
 only Politburo member to head an economic ministry.  Minister Li Fu-ch'un, his
 successor, is a member of the party's Central Committee and a vice-chairman of
 the CFE.  Previously he was the second ranking man in both Party and govern-,
 ment in Manchuria.  Both Chen and Li spent several years in the USSR and both
 had contact with the IISSR in Manchuria after 1946.  The first Vice Minister,
 Ho Chang-kung, likewise was prominent in Manchurian government as head of the
 Communist Army's War Industries Department there.  Vice Minister Liu Ting, who
 is Soviet-educated, previously served prominently in North China's regional
 government.  Vice-Minister Chung Lin, though not identified as a Communist, is
 a member of the CFE and also director of its Technical Skills Control Bureau.
 Characterized as an economic specialist, he may be useful. chiefly for his
 technical knowledge of heavy industry.
 There is little evidence of key personnel shifts in the Ministry
 of Heavy Industry, although they may be more extensive than is indicated.
 The Director of the Aviation Industry Bureau was demoted, in 1951 and the post
 assigned to the ranking vice-minister. 3~f  Moreover, the Steel Industry
 Bureau underwent a shakeup in late 1951.  In August a new director, formerly
 in Manchuria, was appointed. ~  Later a deputy director of the Steel In-
 dustry Bureau was dismissed for allegedly falsifying the accounts of a large
 steel plant.  At lower .ministerial levels and in regional and local adarinistra-
 tion the turnover probably has been considerable, especially in the last year.
 It probably will be intensified during the next 2 years as the Communists
 attempt to deal further with corruption, inefficiency, and other weaknesses
 in the administration of heavy industry, and an effort will probably be arcade
 to eliminate politically unreliable employees, including those who formerly
 served Nationalist China.

 indirectly about four-fifths of the population.  Because agriculture is"the
 chief foundation of the economy, and because industrialization depends in
 large part on increased agricultural production?in order to provide the
 necessary capital for investments, the Communist regime is greatly concerned
 with agricultural policies.  Agriculture is subject to far less direct con-
 trol than are industry, transportation, or finance.  The establishment of
 individually owned small farms is the first step of the "land reform" movement,
 In N1a.nchuria and North China, attempts -have been made to organize the peasants
 into mutual aid teams, but it appears likely that private farming will remain
 the dominant type of agriculture for several years. ~  Pheanwhile, mutual aid
 teams, cooperatives, and state farms will continue to be emphasized and to
 assume increasing importance,  In October 1951 the Minister of Agriculture
 stated that 60 percent of the peasants in North China. and 70 percent of those
 in Manchuria had joined mutual aid teams.
 The ministry of Agriculture apparently has four vice ministers.  The
 top officials are largely non-Communist figureheads and technicians whose lack
 of prominence gives the appearance of belying the 1~Linistry's actual importance,
 The A;inistry's functions include, in addition to the direct or in-
 direct administration of agricultural production programs, certain manufactur-
 ing enterprises such as agricultural drugs. ~  In December 1950, part of
 the functions of the former ministry of Food Industry, presumably the ministry
 dealing with food production, was assigned to the i~.inistry of Agriculture. 3,S/
 Likewise, in P;ovember 1951, jurisdiction over land reclamation was trans-
 ferred to the 2inistry of Agriculture from the former Zinistry of Forestry
 and Land Reclamation, which became the Pinistry of Forestry. ~  The Ainistry
 of Agriculture is also responsible for the fishing and marine products
 enterprises. L1
 1.  Structure.
 The Ainister of Agriculture is assisted by four vice ministers,
 the fourth having been added in July 1951.  There is no evidence that any of
 the vice-ministers have responsibility for particular bureaus or offices,
 each of which is headed by a director.  The only one of the staff and
 coordinating units which has been identified is the Staff Office, which pre-
 sumably is concerned with internal administration.  Exact information is

 lacking on the planning, personnel, and other staff bureaus usually
 found in Chinese Communist economic ministries.  There are at least
 eight functional bureaus or offices for agricultural administration,
 foodstuffs production, industrial raw materials, veterinary services,
 pestilence prevention, farm equipment, water conservancy, and land re-
 clamation.  Pressably these bureaus have subordinate functional and
 staff units, although these have not been identified.
 Local administration of the I~Sinistry of Agriculture is con-
 ducted by regional and local goverrunents and especially by either the
 agriculture or the agriculture and forestry departments at various levels.
 General plans and programs of prime importance are formally enacted by
 the General Administrative Council (GAC) and directed to the regional
 goverrunents for elaboration and dissemination to lower governmental levels.
 The 2finistry itself issues numerous directives, sometimes jointly with
 other ministries or organs.  These provide instructions and general guid-
 ance to the local agricultural departments.  Although indirect control is
 usually exercised through local administrations, certain enterprises in-
 cluding insect drug factories, apparently are managed directly by the
 N,inistry. 1,~2
 2.  ,~lministrative Problems.
 Various directives issued in early 1952 reflected Communist
 efforts to implement the current year's production plan as adopted by the
 GAC.  General instructions to agricultural offices, cooperatives, farm tool
 stations, and banks regarding increased utilization of farm tools were set
 forth in a directive issued  joi-qtly by the N~inistry and the All-China
 Federation of Cooperatives. L,~  In January 1952 the East China I~lilitary
 and Administrative Committee directed each province to establish promptly
 both a manufacturing plant and an experimental plant for farm equipment and
 instructed smaller administrative districts to set up a repair plant.  It
 became the responsibility of the local goverr~nents to carry out this program, !~
 It seems doubtful that local governments could provide for the stipulated
 manufacture and repair of farm machinery in time for effective use in 1952
 production.  The same may be said of directives on better disease prevention,
 the use of fertilizer, and the propagation of better seed.
 In seeking to reach planned production goals, the regional
 governments rely heavily on local forms of authority, such as the Party,
 cooperatives, and mutual aid teams, to exhort the peasants to increase-their
 efforts.  An East China directive on spring planting, for example, required
 -26-
 Declassified in Part -Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/23 :CIA-RDP79R01141A000100150001-2
 Declassified in Part -Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/23 :CIA-RDP79R01141A000100150001-2
 that all levels of government submit periodic reports on such organiza-
 tional efforts aiming toward increased production. ~/  In Manchuria the
 top regional official gave general instructions regarding mobilization for
 spring production to local government, Party, and mass organizations. ~/
 Provincial governments were to report every 5 days on the development of
 this program.  Inspection teams headed by high-ranking officials of the
 Manchurian regional government were instructed to visit the various pro-
 vinces
 Despite all these efforts to achieve increased production,
 there are indications of serious weaknesses in the administration of the
 Ministry of Agriculture.  Repeated emphasis in directives on particular
 problems of coordination, on the lack of compliance with instructions, on
 the desirability of utilizing cooperatives and other organizations for per-
 f orming assigned tasks, on the existence of inadequate leadership, on un-
 satisfactory performance in providing for loans and tools, and on frequent
 failure to achieve effective mobilization of peasants .for greater production
 are indications of unsatisfactory administration.  In Manchuria, where
 agriculture is under stricter control than in other regions, a recent direc-
 tive set forth a temporizing policy regarding inefficient or corrupt local
 officials. !~/  The directive also reminded overzealous Communists of. the
 present moderate policy in such matters as hired labor, private loans, and
 the formation of cooperatives on a "voluntary" basis.
 Further evidence of weakness of the administration of the
 Ministry of Agriculture is given by an official Northwest China report of
 May 1951.  In claiming certain progress in coordination between agriculture
 agencies and related organs, the report indicated that such coordination
 should be strengthened. ~8/  The report criticized local leaders for their
 ignorance or misunderstanding of the plans, for using wrong methods, for the
 failure to coordinate their varied efforts, for overzealousness, and for in-
 difference.  It noted that certain local positions were left unfilled for
 months.  In various areas, production activities were neglected.  Training of
 staff workers was generally inadequate.  The report also noted inadequate
 organization of facilities for the manufacture and repair of farm tools.
 A further aspect of the administration of agriculture is the
 problem of effective coordination at ministerial levels.  The Tinistry of
 Agriculture is necessarily dependent in important matters on certain itadustrial
 ministries, such as the People's Be-nk, the Ministry of Finance, the Federation
 of Cooperatives, and other national organs.  This problem involves not only
 these agencies but also the CAC as the directing organ of administration.  From
 the evidence available and by inference from indications of poor coordination

 Declassified in Part -Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/23 :CIA-RDP79R01141A000100150001-2
 at regional and local levels, it may be inferred that unsatisfactory co-
 ordination also exist between the ministries.
 - 3.  Pg~.
 The Ministry of Agriculture is headed by a group of undistin-
 guished officials, of whom only the ranking vice-minister is identified as
 a Communist. 1,,,~f  Minister Li Shu-ch'eng is regarded as a figurehead, since
 he is a retired general nearly 80 years old.  He had not held an important
 office since 1936 until appointed Minister in October 19,9.  Vice-?4inister
 I,o Yu-cr.'uan, a Communist, probably controls the Ministry.  He previously
 served in secondary administrative offices of the local Comm~~unist governments
 in North China areas.  The next two vice-ministers are agricultural experts
 who studied in non-Communist countries.  Wu Chueh-Hung, a Shanghai tea ex-
 pert and merchant, once served as technical adviser in Nationalist China.
 Yang Hsien-tong, a IIS-educated expert, previously held both teaching and
 middle-level administrative posts in Nationalist China.  The fourth vice-
 minister, Chang Lin-ch'ih, appointed in July 1951, previously directed the
 Ministry's Staff Office.
 It may be assumed that many former Nationalist officials are in
 the Ministry of Agriculture.  Although there are few indications of change
 in the Ministry's personnel at top and bureau levels, some dismissals have
 occurred, especially during the past year.  Attet~pts to eradicate administra-
 tive weaknesses, to get rid of politically unreliable personnel, and to re-
 ward Communist devotees of the agrarian program probably Neill bring about a
 considerable turnover during the next 2 years..

 Soviet influence in Chinese affairs antedated Mao Tse-Tong's rise to
 leadership within the Chinese Communist movement.  Moscow's formal recogni-
 tion of Mao and a subsequent increase in Soviet influence came after the
 leadership within the Chinese Communist Party had been decided.  This tool
 the form of technical and economic assistance, Sino-Soviet joint companies,
 and Sino~Soviet trade and credit agreements.
 A.  Soviet_Technic 1 and F~,conomic Assistance.
 Since 19l,$ an increasing number of Soviet technical advisers have
 appeared in Communist China, and their services have received frequent
 recognition in official statements in the Chinese press.  The total number

 Declassified in Part -Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/04/23 :CIA-RDP79R01141A000100150001-2
 ~~               f~
 of Soviet advisers cannot be estimated accurately.   They are in virtually
 every braaeh of the econoagy_although they appear to be moat prominent in
 railxay transport, heavy industry, and mining     They xere first recognized
 in Manahuria, the moat important area in which the USSR acquired special
 rights by virtue of the Sino-,Soviet treaty and agreements of 1945.  Soviet
 experts have also been concentrated in North China and Northxest China and
 have been reported to be in other parts of the country.
 The importance of the Soviet technical advisers varies in different
 areas and in different enterprises, but their influence on the Chinese
 economy is probably considerable and in some cases may amount to direct con-
 trol,  The influential role of the Soviet technical advisers is 'indicated by
 frequent Chinese praise of Soviet technicians, dependence on_them bsenuse of
 the increasing use of Soviet machinery and techniques, the establishment by
 the Peking regime of Soviet economic patterns, and the nature of Sino-Soviet
 economic obligations.  These advisers are expected by the USSR to help safe-
 guard Soviet interests regarding the production of materials for export to
 the Soviet Bloc.  Whether they participate directly in the policyynalcing
 processes cannot be established, but their recommendations on important pro-
 jects appear to receive careful consideration and may often be decisive.
 Despite the influx of Soviet technical adv     d their increasing in-
 fluence,                                       they have taken over the       50X1

 ?        complete control may be an early probability.
 B.  3ino-Sovie~tiJoint C~p~ies,
 Sino~oviet joint companies, nominally organized on a parity basis,
 afford the IISSR direct control over important segments of the Chinese
 Communist economy, especially in Manchuria and Sinkiang.  Officially announced
 Sino-Soviet agreements provide the legal basis for the Chinese Changchun Rail-
 way in Manchuria, for a joint civil aviation company operating lines between
 North China and Soviet Asia, and for two companies concerned with  roduction
 of petroleum and nonferrous metals in Sinkiang Province.
 other Sino-Soviet 3oint companies may have  een  o      o un er-
 take specific industrial and coamercial activities.  Soviet control is also
 exercised indirectly through at least one joint oantpany involving an Eastern50X1
 European Satellite.  An officially announced Sino-Polish agreeouent provides
 fora joint shipping company to operate vessels engaged in trade between     50X1
 Poland and Camanunist China.

 1.  Chin se  h  gchun R ilwa~.
 The Chinese Changchun Railway, the most important railway net-
 work in Manchuria, was given legal sanction as a jointly owned and jointly
 managed enterprise by the agreement of 14 August 1945 between the USSR and
 Nationalist China. ~/  According to this agreement, the new railway was to
 be formed by uniting designated trunk lines and certain auxiliary lines of
 the former Chinese Eastern and South Manchurian Railways.  The USSR thus
 regained with respect to Manchurian railways substantially the position held
 by Russia before her defeat by Japan in 1905.
 The subsequent agreement of 14 February 1950 between the USSR
 and Communist China sanctioned this position with minor modifications but
 also stipulated that the USSR should transfer its rights in the Chinese
 Changchun Railway to Communist China by the end of 1952. ~#
 The main lines of the Chinese Changchun Railway extend from
 Manchouli, on the northwest frontier, eastward to the border town of Suifenho,
 and from Harbin, in north Manchuria, to Dairen and Port Arthur.  The railway
 thus affords the USSR a direct route across Manchuria toward Vladivostok and
 also to the Port Arthur naval base and to Dairen, Manchuria's principal port,
 in south Manchuria.  The railway reaches cities from which major lines extend
 to Korea as well as to North China.  Consequently, it is of vital importance
 not only as a network linking Manchuria with the USSR but also in connection
 with shipments to and from North China and North Korea.
 The railway also owns certain nonmilitary properties, although
 they are of slight importance in the Manchurian economy.  Among them are timber
 concessions, electric power plants, and two coal mines.
 2.  Sino-S~g~ ~~ Aviation ~iQ~v.
 The Sinn-Soviet Civil Aviation Company was established in accord-
 ance with a 10-year agreement of 27-March 1950.  This agreement authorized
 creation of a joint company to operate air lines linking Peking with the Soviet
 Asian cities of Chita, Irkutsk, and Alma-Ata, and with intervening points in
 China. ~/  Thereby the USSR obtained legal sanction for greatly extending the
 scope of jointly operated air lines in China.  Previously, under the 10-year
 *  In. September 1952 a Sino-Soviet communiqub  announced that steps had been
 initiated to complete the transfer by 31 December 1952.  The USSR, however, is
 expected to continue to influence the operation of the railway through Soviet
 technicians, continued control of the Port Arthur naval base, and other methods.

 agreement of 1939, extended in 1949 by an unwilling Nationalist China, a
 joint S ino-Soviet company operated air transport facilities only between.
 Qltaa-Ata and Hami, in eastern Sinkiang.  The original agreement was con-
 cluded at a time when Sinkiang Province was under Soviet domination.
 The new civil aviation company's organizational pattern is
 similar to that of the other joint companies with regard to nominal parity,
 equal sharing of expenses and profits by the two parties, and alternating of
 top administrative posts between Soviets and Chinese.  However, key operational
 and management personnel are Russian, and the Soviets apparently have complete
 domination over the company's activities.
 Through this company the USSR has direct control over important
 air transport facilities which not only monopolize air traffic between Peking
 and major points in Soviet Asia but also serve Chinese border provinces from
 Manchuria to Sinkiang, areas in which the USSR has a primary concern.
 Establishment of such afar-flung and vital air transport network indicates
 the USSR's intention to contirnae to control and exploit these facilit ies on a
 long-term basis.  It is unlikely that this control will be weakened or cur-
 tailed during the next several years despite popular Chinese distrust of the
 exercise or such privileges by the Soviets.
 3.  ~i~-Sog,~,gt~,~Qg~oanies in Sinkiang Province.
 Authorized by two agreements of 27 March 1950 valid for 30 years,
 the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company and the Sino-Soviet Nonferrous and Rare
 Metals Company were organized to exploit mineral resources in Sinkiang Pro-
 vince. $~/  According to Communist press statements, the first company is con-
 cerned with discovering, producing, and refining oil and gas in Sisilciang;,while
 the second company, concerned primarily with nonferrous metals, also has both
 exploratory and production responsibilities.
 These companies are organized on a nominal parity basis, both
 parties ostensibly sharing in expenses, profits, production, and personnel.
 Top administrative-posts are to be alternated between Soviet and Chinese
 citizens every 3 years.  During the first 3 years a Soviet manager is to be
 assisted by a Chinese deputy, while the Central Boards are to b e headed by
 Chinese, with Soviets as vice-chairmen.  However, these formal arrangements have
 little effect on the management of the companies, which are under strict Soviet
 control.  It has been reported that they are being utilized exclusively for
 Soviet advantage.
 Establishment of these joint companies indicates the USSR's in-
 tention to develop, exploit, and control on a long-term basis the considerable
 mineral resources of Sinkiang, especially strategic metals.  These resources
 have been little utilized hitherto, although the USSR attempted to develop

 some of them during the decade of Soviet domination of Sinkiang before 19/.x..
 The Chinese Communist potential with regard to supplying equipment, facili-
 ties, technical skills, and top management needed by the joint enterprises
 is very slight.  Moreover, Chinese Communist economic and administrative in-
 fluence in Sinkiang as a whole is weak.  It is likely that Soviet control
 over important parts of the Sinkiang economy will be maintained at least for
 a considerable time, and this control will become more extensive as the joint
 companies increase their scope of operations. .Over the longer term, growing
 resentment of the Chinese and the indigenous population over Soviet exploita-
 tion may become a source of vulnerability in the position of the USSR.
 Q.  S  o-Polish Shipnin~ Company.
 In accordance with the Sino Polish shipping agreement of January
 1951, a joint company has been organized on a parity basis to engage in the
 shipping trade between Poland and Communist China.                             50X1
 each signatory agreed to furnish an equal number of vesse s, var ous y s a
 as from 10 to 16. ~                                    Poland agreed to pro-   50X1
 vide officers and technicians for the Chinese ships and also to train Chinese
 deck officers.  During 1951, various delays and difficulties reportedly were
 experienced in implementing the agreement.  In particular, the~Peking regime
 is said to have failed to provide promptly the stipulated number of ships.
 The company, when fully in operation, may contribute much needed shipping
 facilities for the expanding trade between Communist China and the European        '
 Satellites.
 The weak position of Communist China with regard to shipping re-
 sources and trained crews suggests that the Chinese will have a subordinate
 role in the management and control of the company.  Moreover, ultisu~.te control
 presumably is held by the USSR.
 V.  Strengths and Weaknesses.
 A.  Elements of. Strength,
 Probably the moat important and far-reaching element of stren~*th in
 the economic organization of Communist China is the concentration of control.
 This control is becoming more firmly established and centralized as greater
 administrative skill and experience are attained.  Development of control
 has provided an opportunity to introduce uniformity in methods and procedures,
 both in the operational aspects of economic enterprises, as well as in the
 information-gathering processes so essential for a planned economy.

 The consolidation of control has also facilitated the adoption
 of Soviet organizational methods and management techniques,  This factor
 most probably must be regarded as an element of strength for a predominantly
 agricultural country such as China,  Mao Tae-tong has succeeded in practically
 isolating his new China so that a condition of dependency upon the tTSSR exists,
 and the consolidation of control under these circumstances probably represents
 a gain rather than a loss for China,  In addition, the facility of exercising
 greater control has broadened the opportunities to apply the experience gained
 in the more highly developed 2~lanchurian area to the remaining areas of China,
 B.  Elemen ,as of Weakness,
 Elements of weakness exist in the economic organization of Communist
 China, however, which counterbalance the factors of strength to a consider-
 able degree.  These elements of weakness are associated largely with the
 initial phases of development in aCommunist-controlled state, the customary
 faults of Soviet-controlled organizations, as well as the traditional administra-
 tive habits peculiar to China,
 In the first instance, there is evidence of poor planning, administra-
 tive conflicts, and duplication of effort.  2~:uch of this difficulty stems from
 the failure to follow directives or to understand the purpose and objectives
 of these directives.
 Communist China has possibly attempted too ambitious a program for
 the administrative and management skills available.  As a result, Mao has been
 forced to use former Nationalist administrators in his government at a time
 when political reliability is of paramount importance.
 With reference to purely administrative problems, other elements of
 weakness are the traditional tendencies of overstaffing, nepotism, corruption,
 and low performance standards in the civil service.  Only limited progress
 apparently has been achieved in correcting these wealolesses.  Consequently,
 there exists in Communist China an excessive hierarchy of administrative organs
 which encourages bureaucracy, restricts initiative, and slows up administra-
 tive action.
 Another important weakness, although not directly 'related to
 organizational features of the economy, is the traditional dislike. in China
 of the USSR and all Russian administrators,  This attitude reflects adeep-
 seated Chinese anti-foreign sentiment,.  Although this attitude has not yet re-
 flected itself in the lack of cooperation, nevertheless it is a significant And
 potential limitation on effective liaison between Communist China and the USSR.
