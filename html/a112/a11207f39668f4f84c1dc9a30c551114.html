 Military Imports
 Key Judgments           Beijing has modified its policy of self-reliance in defense production to
 Information available   allow a still-selective, but broader range of military imports. We estimate
 as oft October 1984     that in 1983 and 1984 the Chinese signed nearly $500 million in contracts

 for imports of weapons and weapon technology-including $200 million for
 Israeli Python-III air-to-air missiles and $190 million for US and French
 helicopters. Prospects are good that Beijing will conclude even larger
 purchases over the next five years.
 In our view, Beijing's decision to renew imports of Western military
 products rests on several key factors:
 ? Soviet strength. China's military leaders recognize that the improve-
 ments to Soviet forces in the Far East over the past five years have
 widened the gap in equipment quality, and the backward state of Chinese
 military equipment leaves China vulnerable to a fast-moving Soviet
 invasion. Beijing's senior generals have little faith that China's defense
 industries can develop advanced military hardware to counter the Soviet
 threat and are pressing for some direct foreign purchases to fill major de-
 fense gaps.
 ? Western willingness. China's leaders are capitalizing on the warming
 military relations with the United States to gain access to advanced
 Western military technology. We believe Beijing also considers arms
 sales to be a tangible sign that the United States considers China an im-
 portant partner in East Asia, and, although Beijing opposes full strategic
 cooperation, the existence of some military ties gives China additional
 leverage in dealing with the USSR.
 ? A stronger economy. After four years of economic retrenchment, the
 Chinese are currently able to spend more for military modernization.
 China's foreign exchange reserves have grown to over $16 billion
 excluding gold. The defense sector can claim some credit for the
 improved economic outlook, as the military has dramatically cut back
 procurement of older designed equipment, trimmed the size of the
 standing Army, and provided large profits from foreign arms sales.
 We believe Beijing has identified critical gaps in antiarmor capabilities, air  25X1
 defenses, antisubmarine warfare, surveillance and early warning capabili-
 ties, and electronic countermeasures that it seeks to correct through
 Western assistance. The Chinese are negotiating with many Western
 nations trying to play off suppliers to obtain the best deals. Although

 Beijing claims it will only accept transfer of the most modern weapons and
 technology available, we believe that Beijing will accept less if convinced
 that the equipment is modern enough to counter the Soviet threat.
 China's military establishment appears to be in general agreement on
 priorities, but there are divergent views on the best route to correcting
 deficiencies. China's General Staff is pressing for the immediate acquisi-
 tion of some finished military equipment from abroad, while Defense
 Minister Zhang Aiping and the defense industries are seeking primarily
 the import of production technology. The creation of Baoli Trading
 Company-under the General Staff-and its aggressive pursuit of direct
 buys indicates that the operational arm of the Chinese military has gained
 the senior political leadership's approval to pursue some sizable direct
 acquisitions from abroad. Nonetheless, we expect that differences between
 the armed forces as end users and the defense industries as producers will
 continue to make arms negotiations lengthy affairs
 In our view, the Chinese plan to acquire foreign equipment-mostly
 components to upgrade Chinese weapons-is an interim step until Chinese
 defense industries have been sufficiently modernized to begin building
 their own advanced arms. Beijing is not attempting to "buy" military
 modernization from abroad, but in some areas-where inadequate Chinese
 production capabilities offer no alternatives-we believe they will buy
 significant quantities of Western materiel.
 Improvements in China's antitank capabilities through imports will proba-
 bly be of greatest concern to the Soviets and may lead them to step up their
 ground force modernization in the Far East. Modernization of Chinese
 fighter-interceptors is unlikely to prevent the Soviets from rapidly achiev-
 ing air superiority in any conflict, and we expect the Soviets easily to match
 any Chinese air improvements. Upgraded naval capabilities would improve
 China's coastal defenses against Soviet naval action but would not make
 the Chinese Navy a rival to the Soviet Pacific Fleet in open-ocean
 operations.
 US willingness to transfer advanced military systems to China, particularly
 F-8 fighter upgrades, is creating a constituency within the Chinese military
 establishment that probably will continue to press for further expansion of
 military ties. We believe the Chinese military sees the fighter-improvement
 program as particularly important as a demonstration of US willingness to
 improve even those Chinese military capabilities that might be detrimental

 to Taiwan. Nonetheless, significant opposition within the Chinese Govern-
 ment to closer military relations still exists from those convinced that the
 United States will use military transfers to justify arms sales to Taiwan.
 Indeed, continuing US arms sales to Taiwan remain the issue that has the
 potential to damage emerging US-Chinese military ties.
 The secrecy surrounding US-Chinese military negotiations may endanger
 efforts in COCOM to limit the levels of materiel sold to China. There is a
 growing perception in West European capitals-created in part by Chinese
 misrepresentations-that the United States is attempting to corner the
 China arms market and is using COCOM procedures to restrict European
 sales. We believe that some West European nations, particularly Italy and
 France, are prepared to challenge COCOM limitations and will use the
 liberalized US policy on arms transfers to China as justification.

 China: Opening Doors
 to Western
 Military Imports
 Background
 Under Deng Xiaoping's guiding hand, China has
 made remarkable progress in the past decade in
 restoring professionalism to its armed forces. Greater
 attention to realistic combat training and reduced
 emphasis on political indoctrination have improved
 military readiness. The creation of regional force
 divisions along China's borders with the Soviet Union
 and Vietnam has strengthened China's fighting capa-
 bility. Imposing higher educational criteria for entry
 and reopening military academies closed during the
 Cultural Revolution have improved the quality of
 officers and men. Trimming the size of the armed
 forces has allowed the People's Liberation Army
 (PLA) to purge its ranks of aged officers and unquali-
 fied soldiers.
 the research and development base is too narrow, as
 yet, to design and produce the full range of systems as
 advanced as conventional weapons in Soviet or West-
 ern arsenals:
 ? China's best fighter aircraft, the F-8, has been in
 development since the mid-1960s but is under-
 powered, lacks modern radars, and is equipped with
 dated air-to-air missiles.
 ? China's strategic air defenses continue to rely on
 surface-to-air missiles first fielded in the 1960s and
 an early warning radar network with severe defi-
 ciencies in the detection of low-altitude fighters and
 bombers.
 ? China's ground forces have no munitions, rockets, or
 antitank missiles capable of piercing the frontal
 China's drive to defense modernization, however, has
 not met its toughest challenge, the development and
 deployment of advanced weapons. China's armed
 forces are equipped largely with obsolescent weapons
 of the 1950s' and early 1960s' vintage. Along China's
 northern border are arrayed almost 50 Soviet ground
 combat divisions, some equipped with T-72 main
 battle tanks two generations ahead of China's best.
 Soviet airpower in the Far East includes high-per-
 formance interceptors, fighter-bombers, and bombers
 with capabilities far exceeding those of China's out-
 dated aircraft. And the Soviet Pacific Fleet possesses
 surface ships and submarines equipped with sophisti-
 cated weapons that China's Navy cannot counter.
 A rejuvenated indigenous weapons development pro-
 gram is achieving impressive results, but China's
 defense industries are not sufficiently developed to
 provide quickly all the advanced systems the armed
 forces need.` Beijing's engineers have proved they can,
 with sufficient support, develop ICBMs, nuclear-
 powered submarines, and air-to-surface missiles. But
 armor on Soviet T-64, T-72, and T-80 tanks.
 Between 1975 and 1982, the Chinese leadership de-
 bated the role foreign imports should play in upgrad-
 ing China's defenses, and foreign procurement efforts
 were characterized by indecision and poor coordina-
 tion.2 Defense officials and military industry procure-
 ment teams traveled extensively in the West but
 frustrated governments and industries alike by brows-
 ing for arms yet buying little. At times, just as it
 seemed the Chinese were close to signing major
 contracts-for example, for British Harrier jump jets
 in 1978 and Sea Dart naval air defense missiles for
 destroyers in 1982-internal policy debates erupted
 over the efficacy of the foreign weapons, and contract
 negotiations were abandoned.

 The Chinese committed themselves to purchase some
 finished weapons, but were unable to close the deals.
 In 1978, for example, China was on the verge of
 signing a $700 million contract with France for
 several thousand HOT wire-guided antitank missiles
 and 50 combat helicopters. But Chinese insistence on
 a better price and full production rights for the
 missiles and French reluctance to be the first Western
 government to sell China modern weapons ultimately
 killed the deal. Similar negotiations with the West
 Germans for helicopters equipped with missiles ended
 in failure when Bonn-responding in part to heavy
 Soviet pressure-allowed only four helicopters but no
 antitank missiles to be delivered.
 Chinese arms buyers had greater success importing
 production technology, but most of these ventures also
 failed because of inadequate coordination between
 Chinese manufacturers, design bureaus, and the mili-
 tary users. In addition, Chinese insistence on self-
 sufficiency and cost cutting resulted in contracts that
 provided little followup support from the seller:
 ? In December 1975, Beijing purchased the produc-
 tion rights to the Spey afterburning turbofan engine
 from British Rolls-Royce at a cost of $230 million.
 After a decade, Chinese engineers and designers
 have not mated the engine to any existing fighter or
 designed a suitable airframe for the engines, and
 only five of the 50 original engine kits have been
 assembled.
 ? In July 1979, the Chinese signed an agreement with       25X1
 a Dutch firm for a complete factory to produce
 night-vision devices. Although the plant was com-
 pleted in 1982, the PLA reportedly has been very
 dissatisfied with its products, forcing China to pur-
 chase more reliable systems from the United States.
 labels the program a failure.
 ? In mid-1980, China's aeronautics industry conclud-
 ed a $100 million agreement with France for 50
 Dauphin helicopters with an option for 150 more to
 be manufactured in China. By March 1983, less
 than 10 Dauphins had been assembled and two had
 crashed, killing four Chinese crewmembers. Ac-
 cording to the US defense attache in Beijing, the
 Air Force refuses to evaluate the helicopter and
 the Vietnamese border
 Despite these setbacks, Beijing has had some modest
 successes in military imports that have probably
 whetted the PLA's appetite for buying more from
 abroad. Between 1975 and 1977, Beijing purchased
 12 Super Frelon heavy-lift helicopters from France,
 which the Navy has used aboard support ships
 equipped with landing pads, giving China its first
 shipborne airpower. This new capability was dis-
 played in 1980 when a Super Frelon, based aboard a
 submarine rescue ship, recovered the reentry vehicle
 from an intercontinental ballistic missile test-fired to
 Pacific Ocean waters over 6,000 kilometers from
 China's shores. A more recent success is the procure-
 ment from the United Kingdom of Cymbeline mortar-
 locating radars, used by ground forces to pinpoint
 enemy fire. Purchased in 1982, the radars were used
 this spring and summer during heavy fighting along
 A Changing Climate for Imports
 Since late 1982, marked changes have occurred in
 Beijing's approach to arms imports. Central military
 organizations appear to have gained increased author-
 ity to guide the acquisition of weapons-related tech-
 nology from abroad, and China's senior leadership is
 showing a new readiness to approve funding for
 military technology. We estimate that in 1983 and
 1984 the Chinese signed contracts for nearly $500

 French Helicopter Acquisitions: Mixed Reviews

 The Chinese conducted an unprecedented fly-off com-
 petition among US and French helicopter manufac-
 turers last fall and in July placed a $165 million order
 for 24 Sikorsky S-70C helicopters and a $28 million
 order for six French Super Puma helicopters. In
 addition, the Chinese have formally requested site
 surveys and cost estimates for US Government assist-
 ance in installing modern avionics on F-8 fighter
 aircraft, coproducing the TOW antitank wire-guided
 missile, and upgrading production facilities for large-
 caliber artillery shells.
 We believe these changes reflect a recognition by
 senior leaders that policies of self-reliance in defense
 production must be modified to allow selective, but
 wider military imports. This, in part, results from
 modifications to China's defense doctrine, a stronger
 economic position, and the growing military relation-
 ship with the United States. But it is also the product
 of the PLA's impatience with the pace of domestic
 weapons development by China's defense industries,
 and the military's success in convincing the senior
 political leadership that the threats to China's securi-
 ty from the Soviet Union are sufficient to warrant
 expanded weapons imports. The Chinese military is
 exploiting the current political and economic opportu-
 nities to open doors to a significant rise in military
 imports from the West.
 Improved Relations With Washington. A key factor
 in China's new interest in foreign arms is the warming
 political relationship between China and the United
 States.' In early 1983, Beijing decided not to let
 differences over continued US arms sales to Taiwan, a
 major irritant for many years, stand in the way of a
 more stable and positive relationship with the United
 States. The decision paid off. As relations progressed,
 Beijing realized the United States was willing to relax
 technology transfer restrictions on military exports to
 China. According to Zhang Jingyi, a senior foreign
 policy expert in the Chinese Academy of Social
 Sciences, the decision giving the military approval to
 explore a relationship with the United States came
 from the Politburo. Events of the last year show how
 rapidly the Chinese have capitalized on the new
 opportunity:
 ? In October 1983, a few weeks after Secretary
 Weinberger's announcement in Beijing of US will-
 ingness to sell China antitank and air defense
 weapons, the Chinese defense establishment restat-

 Yang Shangkun,
 Military Commission Secretary General,
 August 1984
 ? In January 1984, US defense officials told Defense
 Minister Zhang Aiping's son, Zhang Pin-a mem-
 ber of Premier Zhao's delegation-that they would
 welcome a visit by a Chinese military delegation to
 discuss a broadened defense relationship. The Chi-
 nese sent Zhang Pin back to Washington in Febru-
 ary with a delegation to discuss a wide range of
 potential areas for US assistance and to invite a
 Pentagon delegation to visit China.
 ? In June 1984, Zhang Aiping made a visit to the
 United States. According to the US defense attache
 in Beijing, Zhang was pleased with the progress
 made on military technology transfer and argued
 successfully for a visit to China by the US Secretary
 of the Navy in August against Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs officials who wanted to delay further mili-
 tary visits until after the US elections.
 tangible sign that the United States sees China as a
 worthy partner in East Asia, and, although Beijing is
 opposed to full strategic cooperation, the existence of
 some military ties gives it additional leverage in
 dealing with Moscow.
 The Chinese believe that US weapons are superior to
 others, but they also calculate that by gaining access
 to US technology they may be able to induce West
 European suppliers to make their best military hard-
 ware available.
 Iowever, although stating
 a preference for US weapons and technology, the
 Chinese are quite willing to see what others may offer.
 According to the US defense attache in Beijing,
 Defense Minister Zhang recently presented the Brit-
 ish Minister of the Armed Forces a shopping list of
 arms strikingly similar to that requested of the United
 States and implied that, if British prices and terms
 were favorable enough, China would choose British
 materiel.
 Modified Defense Doctrine. China's military leader-
 ship looks to the West for assistance, in large measure
 because it recognizes that the backward state of
 Chinese military equipment leaves China vulnerable
 to a Soviet invasion. The leadership points to the
 extraordinary advantages in speed, mobility, and fire-
 power the Soviets have attained on China's northern
 front. To meet this threat, the Chinese are modifying
 their traditional defense doctrine and are permitting
 the PLA to meet an attacker closer to the border,
 rather than rely on Mao's doctrine of "people's war,"
 which calls for retreating into the countryside.
 For the new doctrine to be effective, the PLA must
 have weapons and equipment similar in quality to
 those fielded by the Soviets. The PLA has little faith,
 however, that China's defense industries, on their
 own, can develop military equipment capable of coun-
 tering the Soviet threat. PLA officers often refer
 disparagingly to Chinese defense industry failures,
 and senior Chinese Navy and Air Force visitors to the
 United States have spoken highly of US defense
 industries while severely criticizing their own plants

 Strengthened Economic Position. The new climate
 for arms procurement is also the result of China's
 improving economic situation." In 1979, China en-
 tered a period of economic readjustment. Defense
 spending was especially hard hit, with Chinese open-
 source figures showing a 25-percent decrease from
 1979 to 1981. Chinese Air Force Chief of Staff Ma
 Zhanmin told a US attache that other areas of the
 Chinese economy now are progressing so well that the
 military has been authorized to spend more money.
 Recent expenditures for Israeli air-to-air missiles and
 US Sikorsky helicopters indicate that foreign ex-
 change is available. The Chinese in fact uncharacter-
 istically spent about $50 million more to buy Sikorsky
 helicopters rather than cheaper French Super Pumas.
 Part of the new funding probably comes from China's
 growing foreign exchange reserves that China's de-
 fense sector helped create. China today has over $16.2
 billion in foreign exchange reserves and a healthy
 ' Beijing's renewed interest in Western military materiel is only one
 facet of China's economic emergence from a three-year hiatus in its
 capital import program. For a comprehensive examination of the
 new economic opening to the West, see the forthcoming Intelligence

 arms sales abroad, begun by Beijing in 1979. Over the
 past four years, China has sold $6 billion in arms to
 Third World nations, making China the seventh-
 largest arms exporter in the world
 ment of older weapon systems.
 Frugal spending by the military over the last four
 years has also contributed to a new willingness of the
 national leadership to spend for defense procurements
 from abroad. The Chinese military has trimmed the

 weapons into the force

 The New Players
 From the mid-1970s until late 1982, management of
 foreign military technology acquisitions generally was
 the preserve of trading firms established by China's
 defense industries. Each defense industry has at least
 one trading arm to represent it in the buying and
 selling of military hardware. For example, Norinco is
 the front organization for China's Ministry of Ord-
 nance Industry. After the consolidation of authority
 for the supervision of weapons research, development,
 and production under the National Defense Science,
 Technology, and Industry Commission (NDSTIC) in
 mid-1982, however, the industries have found their
 independent power to negotiate foreign military buys
 seriously eroded.
 Zhang Aiping, appointed Minister of National De-
 fense and deputy secretary general of the Military
 Commission of the Chinese Communist Party in
 November 1982, has moved quickly to place the
 ultimate authority for foreign military technology
 acquisitions under the NDSTIC. Although the post of
 Defense Minister is largely ceremonial, Zhang has
 used his influence as a key member of the Military
 Commission and his two decades of experience as a
 key administrator of China's conventional and nuclear
 research organizations to accomplish this goal. Zhang
 acquisitions of foreign military technology.
 Within the NDSTIC, Vice Chairman Wu Shaozu is
 the senior official in charge of acquiring foreign
 military technology. Wu has probably worked closely
 with Zhang Aiping for many years on military R&D
 and has been referred to as father of China's nuclear
 attack submarine program. Wu is also reportedly a
 close associate of party General Secretary Hu Yao-
 bang, who may be grooming him eventually to replace
 Zhang as defense minister. Wu cochaired working-
 level discussions during Secretary Weinberger's trip
 to China. He also directs two front organizations,
 Yanshan and Xinshidai Corporations, which are the
 key negotiating entities for the NDSTIC in foreign-
 technology acquisitions.
 Yanshan. Yanshan Corporation has emerged in the
 last year as a key organization within the Chinese
 Government for weapons-technology acquisition.
 Yanshan officials negotiated the air-to-air-missile
 contract with the Israelis, the largest Chinese arms
 purchase since 1975, and reportedly monitor the
 foreign trade activities of all defense-affiliated trade
 organizations in China. Yanshan President Xu
 Mingzhen-an active duty Air Force general-met
 with US Embassy officers before TOW negotiations
 last December and asserted that Yanshan could solve
 any potential disputes, as it was empowered to act as
 the final arbiter between PLA end users and the
 Chinese defense manufacturers.
 Although powerful, Yanshan still vies with the indi-   25X1
 vidual defense ministries for control of foreign-tech-
 nology acquisitions.                               I  25X1
 Yanshan's president has tried for the last two years to
 consolidate Yanshan's power over the various minis-
 try-subordinated trading firms by placing them under
 the Yanshan-subordinated-front organization, Xinshi-
 dai Corporation. Although the companies have nomi-
 nally accepted this arrangement, they still maintain
 independent contacts with foreign companies. F
 Baoli. The military services are also becoming in-
 volved in the import of finished military hardware and
 have established their own foreign weapons procure-
 ment arm to bypass the bureaucratic barriers posed
 by the trading arms of the defense industries. Baoli
 Corporation was formed in early 1984 as a front
 company for the PLA General Staff. According to the
 US defense attache in Beijing, the PLA was dissatis-
 fied with allowing ministerial trade offices to carry
 out foreign military negotiations. The PLA claims
 that the trading firms were more interested in work-
 ing out coproduction agreements, which provide long-
 term work for their parent industries, than in quickly

 buying the most advanced weapons available for the 25X1
 armed forces. Moreover, these coproduction negotia-
 tions are usually drawn out and often lead to the
 procurement of less advanced equipment because
 foreign firms are unwilling to transfer the know-how
 for their best products. The PLA points to the ill-fated
 French Dauphin coproduction venture as a prime
 example.

 Secret
 Baoli appears to enjoy an equal status to NDSTIC's
 Yanshan and is extremely well connected to China's
 top policymakers. Baoli's opening was recently cele-
 brated at a reception in the Great Hall of the People,
 and among the guests were Military Commission
 Permanent Vice Chairman Yang Shangkun, the Di-
 rector of the General Political Department Yu Qiuli,
 and Politburo member Wang Zhen. Baoli's President,
 He Ping, is Deng Xiaoping's son-in-law, and Vice
 Chairman He Pengfei is a son of deceased PLA
 Marshal He Long. Wang Jun, Second Vice Chair-
 man, is the son of Wang Zhen, and Baoli's office
 manager apparently is Wang Xiaochao, son-in-law of
 Yang Shangkun. He Ping and He Pengfei participat-
 ed in the working-level discussions at the Pentagon in
 February and negotiated China's purchase of Sikor-
 sky S-70C helicopters. Baoli's executives are members
 of the General Staff equipment bureau and are
 subordinates of its director, Li Guang. According to
 the American Institute in Taipei, Anna Chennault
 recently was introduced to the leaders of Baoli by
 Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang. Chennault said that
 Baoli is known in Beijing as the xiao zhuang pai (the
 strong young men faction) and already has become
 selective in granting appointments to foreign execu-
 tives.
 Baoli is moving quickly to consolidate its position and
 is coming into direct competition with some of the
 ministerial trading firms. Li Guang, when he visited
 the United States with Defense Minister Zhang, told
 US executives that Baoli represented ground, air, and
 naval interests.
 Baoli has replaced China Shipbuilding Trading Cor-
 poration, a trading company for China's shipbuilding
 industry, in negotiations with Italian companies for
 the purchase of torpedoes. Conversely, China Nation-
 al Aero-Technology Import-Export Corporation-a
 trading company for the Ministry of Aviation Indus-
 try-recently was reluctant to arrange direct meet-
 ings between US executives of a jet engine manufac-
 turer and the PLA end users.
 weapon research laboratories, the General Staff De-
 partment favors the rapid introduction of advanced
 weapons. According to the US defense attache in
 Beijing, the General Staff Department is more in-
 clined to buy a foreign weapon, and then if possible
 sign a licensed production agreement, while Zhang
 Aiping wants the technology transfer first. Zhang has
 fought in the last two years with the Air Force and
 Navy over this issue and apparently won some early
 skirmishes. When the Navy signed a tentative con-
 tract in late 1982 to purchase the British Sea Dart
 naval missile for its destroyers, Zhang used the
 NDSTIC to block the purchase. He also quashed Air
 Force interests in French Mirage 2000 fighters.
 With the emergence of Baoli Corporation, however,  25X1
 the General Staff appears to have convinced the
 senior political leadership of the efficacy of some
 finished hardware buys from abroad. The purchase of
 Sikorsky helicopters may prove to be a watershed in
 this regard. Baoli signed a direct-purchase contract
 that only made general references to eventual copro-
 duction of the helicopters and brought Aviation Min-
 istry trade officials into the negotiations at the very
 last minute. In a similar manner, Baoli earlier this
 year purchased $10 million in US electronic monitor-
 ing equipment without even mentioning licensed pro-
 duction.
 China's Priorities
 Underlying Beijing's renewed quest for Western mili-
 tary imports is its concern about the Soviet military
 buildup in the Far East over the past five years.
 Although the Soviets have slowed the pace of creating
 new ground combat divisions in the Far East, they
 have substantially upgraded their strategic and con-
 ventional military power opposite China:
 ? Adding newer tanks, self-propelled artillery, larger
 caliber multiple rocket launchers, and more motor
 transportation assets to ground forces in the Soviet
 Far East.
 ? Introducing the newest tactical aircraft and combat
 assault helicopters in the Soviet inventory.
 ? Expanding the Pacific Fleet, the largest in the
 Soviet Navy, with two Kiev-class aircraft carriers
 and more ballistic missile submarines.
 Infighting. Undercurrents of tension also are appar-
 ent between Defense Minister Zhang and the General
 Staff Department. Although the Defense Minister's
 paramount concern is that China obtain the technol-
 ogy transfer that will benefit China's indigenous

 ? Improving its large nuclear strike force by deploying
 Backfire bombers and mobile SS-20 intermediate-
 range ballistic missiles in the Far East.
 ? Deploying air and naval forces to Cam Ranh Bay in
 Vietnam and expanding patrols in the South China
 Sea.
 Whether through direct arms procurements or the
 transfer of weapons-production technology, we believe
 Beijing's priorities in foreign acquisition are clearly
 aimed at redressing the growing imbalance of forces
 along the Soviet front. Beijing has monitored the
 Soviet buildup in the Far East over the past few years
 but has had little recourse beyond increasing the
 number of combat divisions-equipped with 1950s'
 weapons-stationed opposite the Soviet Union. The
 gap has continued to widen as the modernization of
 Soviet equipment has more than offset Chinese man-
 power increases.
 Although the Chinese see no immediate danger of a
 Soviet attack, they recognize that with the improve-
 ments made to Soviet Far Eastern forces they lack a
 credible defense against a Soviet air, land, and sea
 goal was to survive the first two days following a
 surprise attack, because it is too weak to provide a
 capable initial defense. We believe that Beijing has
 identified critical gaps in antiarmor capabilities, air
 defenses, antisubmarine warfare, surveillance and
 early warning capabilities, and electronic counter-
 measures. In all of these areas, the Chinese are
 looking for Western assistance and are exploring both
 direct purchase and technology transfer.
 Meeting the Soviet Armor Threat. Beijing considers
 the fielding of newer antiarmor weapons an extremely
 high priority because it faces over 29,000 Soviet tanks
 and armored personnel carriers in the Far East.
 Chinese infantry forces rely on short-range antitank
 rockets, rocket-propelled antitank grenades, and Chi-
 nese copies of the Soviet Sagger wire-guided antitank
 missile to provide a three-tiered defense against Soviet
 armor. Although all three can penetrate the armor on
 the T-54/55 and T-62 tanks deployed by the Soviets
 opposite China, none of the weapons is capable of
 penetrating the frontal armor of T-72 tanks, which
 the Soviets began fielding in the Far East in 1982.
 To field antitank systems that will destroy T-72 and
 newer T-80 tanks, the Chinese are interested in
 acquiring an advanced version of the US TOW wire-
 guided antitank missile. The TOW holds several
 attractions for the Chinese:
 ? Chinese designers, using TOW missiles obtained
 from Vietnam, have developed a missile similar to
 the first-generation TOW. The Chinese admit their
 missile cannot penetrate the armor on modern Sovi-
 et tanks and concede they have failed to extend its
 range beyond 3,000 meters or achieve good per-
 formance in cold weather. They believe that with
 limited assistance from US manufacturers they can
 solve these problems and produce a missile system,
 with night-fighting sights, capable of defeating T-72
 and T-80 tanks at ranges over 3,500 meters.
 ? The Chinese also are impressed with the TOW
 mounted on an armored vehicle and believe that
 they can reconfigure a Chinese armored vehicle to
 carry the TOW turret. In this manner, they could
 equip their forces with armor-mounted TOWs with-
 out the high cost of purchasing foreign vehicles and
 hardware.
 ? The Chinese also like the helicopter-mounted TOW
 but recognize that they will have to purchase or
 coproduce a foreign helicopter to gain a heliborne
 antitank capability. A senior Baoli official recently
 told the US defense attache in Beijing that the
 Chinese were looking for an inexpensive helicopter
 for the TOW and would only use their new Sikorsky
 helicopters as a backup because they consider them
 too costly to use for this purpose
 Although negotiating for the TOW, the Chinese have
 not completely closed negotiations with the French for
 the HOT wire-guided antitank missile.
 the HOT had been the first
 choice of t e General Staff Department in the late
 1970s, but it was not approved because of cost-the
 HOT missile price was $35,000 compared with $5,000
 for the I-TOW. More recently, the US defense atta-
 che in Hong Kong reports that the French firm
 Aerospatiale has made a last-ditch attempt to win a

 Chinese contract by offering the Chinese full produc-
 tion facilities for the HOT-II-a newly improved
 missile with performance characteristics beyond the
 I-TOW. The Chinese may use this offer to put
 pressure on the United States to transfer to China the
 more advanced TOW-II technology.
 For shorter range and lighter antitank defense, the
 Chinese are looking at other US and French systems.
 The Chinese have pressed for access to the Viper light
 antitank weapon, which failed acceptance testing by
 the US Army. They believe that since the Viper has
 been rejected the technology must be available at
 reduced prices and they can use it to upgrade their
 own weapons. The Chinese,
 also are interested in French APILAS
 short-range, shoulder-fired antitank weapons. Al-
 though the APILAS only has a 500-meter range, if
 fielded in tandem with a modern wire-guided antitank
 missile like the TOW or HOT, it would provide
 Chinese infantry units with a credible defense against
 T-72 and T-80 tanks
 We believe the Chinese have decided that a modern
 tank able to match the Soviet T-64 or T-72 will be
 beyond their means at least for the next five years.
 Even with a new tank developed by the early 1990s,
 Beijing will rely on the 8,000 deployed Type 59s and
 newer Type 69s for at least another decade. The
 Chinese plan to retrofit these tanks with more power-
 ful main guns, improved engines, better fire-control
 systems, and upgraded night-vision capabilities.
 Some of the Type 59 tanks on show at the I October
 military parade in Beijing carried a British 105-mm
 gun, an upgrade process first used by the Israelis on
 captured Soviet T-54s. In addition, the Chinese are
 close to concluding a deal with a US company to
 coproduce improved armor-piercing ammunition for
 the standard 100-mm tank gun on most Type 59s and
 Type 69s. With this ammunition, China's tanks would
 be more effective against newer Soviet tanks.
 Combating the Soviet Air Threat. Perhaps the great-
 est challenge the Chinese face today is in air defense.
 Across the board, from fighter aircraft to ground-
 based air defenses to shipborne weapons, the Chinese
 capacity to defend effectively against Soviet airpower
 is weak. Consequently, these areas are among some of
 the highest priorities on China's foreign purchase wish
 list.
 The Soviet Air Force would quickly gain air superior-
 ity over the battlefield in any border conflict with
 China. China's fighter aircraft inventory contains
 2,700 F-6s (MIG-19s), 200 F-7s (MIG-21s), and about
 50 F-8 fighters. The Chinese Air Force intends to
 improve the F-7 with a more powerful engine and
 better missiles but is pinning its hopes on the larger,
 faster twin-engine F-8.
 the Chinese have a three-phase program for
 improving the F-8, converting it from a daytime, fair-
 weather high-altitude interceptor to a day and night,
 all-weather fighter:
 ? Radar and Avionics: The Chinese are seeking US
 radars that would improve their ability to find
 enemy aircraft without totally relying on ground
 radar stations. The Chinese recognize that Soviet
 bombers will not be attacking at high altitudes but
 will come in low, where the radars on Chinese
 fighters cannot distinguish them from ground
 clutter:
 The Chinese also seek US assistance in rede-
 signing the cockpit on the F-8, with heads-up
 displays that would improve the pilot's perfor-
 mance in air-to-air combat.

 Some avionics work is being done on the F-7,
 but the Chinese claim to be unhappy with the
 help provided by the British firm, Marconi.
 ? Air-to-Air Missiles: The Chinese signed a contract
 in 1983 with an Israeli firm for $200 million for the
 Python III heat-seeking, air-to-air missile, which is
 comparable to the US AIM-9L (Sidewinder). The
 Python III will give the F-8 an all-aspect-includ-
 ing head-on-capability at longer ranges than the
 Chinese PL-2 heat-seeking missile now in service:
 Beijing has opened negotiations with Italy for
 the Aspide, a semiactive radar-guided air-to-air
 missile. This system is capable of destroying
 aircraft at ranges up to 57 kilometers. This
 missile would strikingly improve Chinese pilots'
 capability to shoot down Soviet aircraft in poor
 weather.
 The Chinese also are exploring purchasing the
 AIM-7 (Sparrow) radar-guided missile from the
 United States.
 ? Engines: The large and heavy F-8 needs a more
 powerful engine to become a capable air-to-air
 fighter. Modern engines from the West would not
 only increase the aircraft's speed, maneuverability,
 and range but also its fuel efficiency and engine life.
 China has expressed a strong interest in two US-
 built engines: the GE 404 engine and the Pratt &
 Whitney 1117/1120.
 firepower. The Chinese know they need tactical air
 defense systems that can counter helicopters and low-
 flying Aircraft. They have shown a strong interest in
 the US Stinger shoulder-fired low-altitude SAM.
 Beijing is dissatis-
 fied with its shoulder-fired short-range SAM, a copy
 of the Soviet SA-7 missile, and is seeking US assist-
 ance to enhance its performance.
 efforts to perfect an
 indigenously designed, vehicle-mounted, medium-to-
 high-altitude SAM are continuing at a test range in
 western China. Beijing has acquired a battery of
 French-made Crotale SAMs, probably from Pakistan,
 and may be using them to correct problems with its
 own SAM. Chinese delegations have shown very little
 interest in buying the US I-HAWK and other foreign
 medium-to-high-altitude SAM systems
 he Chinese have signed a con-
 tract with a US manufacturer for 15 Firebee target
 drones and probably will use them in testing their new
 mobile SAM, suggesting the Chinese believe they can
 solve the problems of their mobile SAM system and
 have it ready for series production soon.
 The Chinese are developing self-propelled antiaircraft
 guns but are looking for foreign assistance in produc-
 ing modern ammunition to improve their firepower.
 the Chinese have mounted
 twin antiaircraft guns on a tank chassis and have
 requested US technology for advanced proximity fuze
 ammunition, which increases the killing radius and
 decreases the need for accuracy of antiaircraft guns.
 Chinese naval combatants are practically defenseless
 against antiship missiles and have only antiaircraft
 guns to protect them against enemy aircraft. The
 Chinese Navy is showing a marked interest in improv-
 ing shipborne air defenses, particularly against sur-
 face-skimming cruise missiles. In mid-1983, China
 purchased two French Compact 100-mm naval guns
 which probably will be placed aboard a frigate for
 testing and evaluation. The French gun can fire up to
 90 rounds a minute-compared with the Chinese
 100-mm, which fires 15 to 18 rounds a minute-and
 The lack of a mobile, tactical SAM has plagued the
 PLA for years. Chinese units currently rely on towed
 antiaircraft guns, which lack mobility, accuracy, and

 antiship missiles or aircraft by coupling an advanced
 radar with a six-barrel 20-mm gatling gun.
 Countering the Soviet Submarine Threat. As the
 Soviet Pacific Fleet has grown dramatically in
 strength, China's attention has turned increasingly to
 defending against submarine attack. Three main ar-
 eas are being explored by Beijing: improved sonar
 capabilities, modern engines to provide quieter run-
 ning ships, and advanced torpedoes for surface ships
 and submarines:
 ? Sonars: The Chinese want modern sonar systems for
 submarines, surface combatants, and antisubma-
 rine-warfare helicopters:
 Last fall, the Chinese signed a $2 million
 contract for the French Fenelon sonar, which
 they reportedly will install on two R-class sub-
 marines. This system is a major advance over
 sonars now on Chinese submarines and they
 may actually be fitted on China's nuclear-
 powered submarines. The Fenelon sonar would
 give Chinese submarines a passive range-find-
 ing capability and the ability to detect and track
 multiple targets at the same time.
 - The Chinese also signed a $4 million deal for
 two sets of the French SS-12 sonar system,
 which is towed from small ships.
 - The Chinese may also sign a deal with France
 this year to refit Chinese Super Frelon helicop-
 ters with the Lamparo sonobuoy sonar system.
 Chinese and US Navy officials have also dis-
 cussed the possibility of cooperation on sonars.
 The Chinese expressed interest in a state-of-the-
 art sonar currently used by the USS Los Ange-
 les-class nuclear attack submarine, but the
 United States has offered only less capable
 systems.

 ? Engines: The Chinese plan to use advanced US
 engines to build a new series of 4,200-ton ASW
 destroyers. According to the US defense attache in
 Beijing, the new destroyers will use US gas turbine
 engines, which are much quieter than standard
 diesel engines:
 China intends to build as many as 10 of these
 ships by the end of the decade. In July, the
 Chinese Navy signed a letter of understanding
 with the General Electric Corporation and
 hopes to complete a contract for up to eight
 LM2500 gas turbine engines by the end of
 1984.
 ? Torpedoes: The Chinese Navy is pressing the Unit-
 ed States and other countries for access to advanced
 submarine- and helicopter-borne torpedoes. China
 currently has no helicopter or ships equipped with
 ASW torpedoes and its submarine torpedoes are
 World War II vintage:
 Through foreign arms merchants, China has
 indicated a willingness to buy 150 to 300 US
 MK-46 deep-diving torpedoes capable of multi-
 ple attacks on a target and MK-48 torpedoes
 carried by all US attack and ballistic missile
 submarines.
 Enhanced Early Warning/Reconnaissance Capabili-
 ties. A key factor in any improvement to China's
 defenses against a surprise Soviet attack is increased
 surveillance capabilities. China's air defense radars
 have a limited range, are easily blinded by electronic
 countermeasures, and are not linked by computers to
 China's air defense commands. Beijing is not seeking
 to replace its radar systems, but to modify and update
 existing equipment. After a long battle with the
 NDSTIC, the General Staff Department has now
 received approval to sign a $40 million agreement
 with a US firm to begin upgrading China's target-
 acquisition radars and, if that program is successful,
 to improve China's early warning radars. China's
 radars provide coverage at low-to-medium altitudes
 and the upgrade is an attempt to build a more viable
 defense against high-performance Soviet fighters and
 bombers penetrating at low altitudes. The Chinese
 also may intend to use upgraded radars with their
 medium-to-high-altitude mobile SAM now under de-
 velopment.
 To increase China's surveillance capabilities, Baoli
 Corporation signed a contract for $9 million with a
 US firm this spring to purchase 625 radio receivers
 that can be used to monitor military communications.
 are looking at a variety of other border-surveillance
 systems ranging from side-looking radars that can be
 mounted on transport aircraft to photoreconnaissance
 cameras that can be mounted on Chinese fighters.
 Baoli recently signed a $20 million contract for two
 low-altitude reconnaissance cameras made in the
 United States that will be installed on F-8 aircraft.

 Secret
 Electronic Countermeasures. Beijing not only seeks to
 upgrade its weapons for defense against enemy air-
 craft and antiship missiles, but also is trying to
 develop a viable electronic countermeasure capability.
 Last December, China signed two contracts worth
 $26 million with Italian firms for two sets of the
 Newton naval electronic warfare system and five sets
 of the Selenia ground-based electronic warfare sys-
 tem. The Newton system, to be installed on Chinese
 frigates, is specifically designed to deceive and defeat
 antiship missiles. The Selenia gear jams enemy air-
 craft radar, complicating their ability to find and
 destroy air and ground targets. Delivery of both naval
 systems is being delayed because of US objections to
 the sale.
 Other negotiations for naval electronic warfare sys-
 tems are continuing.
 the British firm Vospar Thornycroft is developing-
 at China's request-a complete electronic warfare
 package for Luda-class destroyers. This would include
 electronic warning receivers that would identify the
 incoming aircraft or antiship missile and trigger the
 appropriate defensive response. The US defense atta-
 che in Hong Kong reports that another British firm
 recently met with the Chinese Navy and presented a
 similar proposal for a missile radar warning system
 that controls chaff countermeasure dispensers.
 The deployment of upgraded Chinese F-7 and F-8
 fighter-interceptors armed with modern air-to-air
 missiles is unlikely to prevent the Soviets from achiev-
 ing air superiority within a few days following hostil-    25X1
 ities, but it could make a Soviet air attack more
 costly. Soviet airpower in the Far East is already at a
 high level of sophistication, and we expect the Soviets 25X1
 easily to match Chinese improvements. The Soviets
 currently have a high potential for offensive
 airstrikes against China, including Backfire bombers
 and Fencer deep-strike aircraft.
 Upgraded ASW and antiship missile defenses would
 improve China's ability to defend its coastline against
 Soviet naval action but would not make the Chinese
 Navy a rival to the Soviet Pacific Fleet in open-ocean
 operations. The Chinese Navy equipped with better
 ASW sonars and torpedoes could use these systems to
 great advantage in the shallow waters of China's
 Implications
 The Sino-Soviet Balance. Moscow probably will be
 most concerned about the improvements that import-
 ed Western hardware will make in China's antitank
 capabilities and may step up its ground force modern-
 ization in the Far East. By deploying antitank missiles
 like the I-TOW in quantity, China could reduce the
 substantial edge now held by Soviet armored forces
 along the border, and Chinese helicopter-mounted
 antitank missiles would be especially troublesome.
 The Soviets probably will speed up replacement
 schedules for the older T-54/55 and T-62 tanks,
 equipping more units with newer T-72 tanks.

 continental shelf and frustrate the operations of Sovi-
 et submarines. However, improvements in China's
 ability to project naval power probably would be
 limited to the South China Sea, where Chinese land-
 based aircraft could compensate for serious weakness
 that would still exist in shipborne air defenses.
 Taiwan. Although foreign acquisitions are geared
 primarily to the Soviet threat-and the initial fielding
 of improved systems is almost certain to be along the
 northern border-the new weapons will improve some
 dimensions of China's military capabilities against
 Taiwan. We believe that production and deployment
 of modernized F-7s and F-8s will reduce the qualita-
 tive advantage held by Taiwan's current F-5E fight-
 ers. Beijing, however, has for several years had the
 ability to gain command of the air over Taiwan if
 willing to take heavy losses, and improved fighters
 would simply reduce the cost somewhat. Beijing prob-
 ably still would lose too many aircraft to Taiwan's
 ground-based air defenses unless it corrected severe
 deficiencies in ground attack aircraft and air-to-
 ground weapons.
 Naval military acquisitions from abroad probably will
 increase the Chinese Navy's already formidable capa-
 bilities to blockade Taiwan but not its amphibious-
 assault potential. If modern submarine sonars and
 torpedoes are obtained from abroad, China's 100
 R-class submarines would make it difficult for any
 navy to keep Taiwan's ports open. None of China's
 priorities in weapon acquisitions will give the PLA the
 materiel required to pose a real invasion threat to
 Taiwan. We can detect no program to build the large
 numbers of landing ships required, and no evidence
 that Beijing intends to spend its limited resources to
 acquire amphibious-assault ships or their technology
 from abroad
 The United States. US willingness to transfer ad-
 vanced military systems to China, particularly F-8
 fighter upgrades, is creating a constituency in the
 Chinese military establishment that, we believe, will
 push for even wider US-Chinese ties through military
 contacts. According to the US defense attache in
 Beijing, Defense Minister Zhang and NDSTIC Vice
 Chairman Wu Shaozu were convinced by their mid-
 June visit of the long-term value to China of the
 relationship and recently lobbied senior political lead-
 ers for additional official visits to further the relation-
 ship. Wu reportedly has staked his reputation on
 concluding a deal for F-8 avionics. We believe the
 PLA sees US assistance in fighter improvements as a
 positive signal of US sincerity in improving China's
 military capabilities, even those that may have a
 detrimental effect on Taiwan, and may be using this
 program to persuade skeptics.
 Discussions on technology transfer are providing US
 officials new and unprecedented contacts with the
 Chinese military, which traditionally has been ex-
 tremely wary of direct dealings with foreigners. In
 striking contrast to earlier years, the US defense
 attache was sought out for discussions and toasts by
 China's senior generals at the Army Day festivities in
 Beijing this August. Navy Secretary Lehman in Au-
 gust was given the first tour for a foreigner of one of
 China's three nuclear attack submarines. Prospects
 are bright for further military-to-military contacts as,
 for example, senior Chinese Navy officers have in-
 formed the US attache that a Deputy Chief of Staff
 has been assigned to work out plans for a US Navy
 port call at Qingdao.
 The continuation of US arms sales to Taiwan, how-
 ever, has the potential to damage emerging US-
 Chinese military ties. PLA leaders reportedly face
 opposition from elements in the Foreign Ministry and
 elsewhere who argue that the United States will use
 military transfers to China to justify continuing arms
 sales to Taiwan. Army Deputy Chief of Staff, Xu
 Xin, recently told the US defense attache that he
 hopes US-Chinese military ties would develop further
 but warned that the United States "must strictly
 adhere" to the August 1982 communique, emphasiz-
 ing that the Chinese people are "very sensitive to the
 Taiwan problem."
 Perceptions in West European capitals that the Unit-
 ed States is cornering the China arms market may
 endanger efforts in COCOM to limit the types and
 levels of materiel sold to China. The secrecy sur-
 rounding US-Chinese military negotiations and Chi-
 nese misrepresentation of US policy have fueled Euro-
 pean fears.

 Secret
 In June, according to the US
 Embassy in Rome, Italy announced its intention to
 proceed with the sale of ship-mounted electronic
 countermeasures equipment despite US objections in
 COCOM, because the Italian Government had con-
 cluded that the sale was consistent with the US policy
 of liberalized military transfers to the PRC. The
 Italians hinted that US objections were based less on
 national security concerns than on US economic
 interests. France also appears to be testing the
 COCOM limits with cases now under consideration
 for sonar and naval guns.
 Prospects
 We believe Beijing's decision to increase the level of
 arms imports will result in some significant purchases
 of both finished military equipment and production
 know-how over the next five years. In future negotia-
 tions, Beijing will undoubtedly reiterate its primary
 goal of using its limited funds to develop self-reliance
 in the production of modern weapons. We believe,
 however, that Beijing is showing a new willingness to
 purchase selected advanced military hardware that
 will, in its view, fill a major gap and include the
 prospect of eventual coproduction or licensed produc-
 tion in China.
 Beijing's search for advanced military equipment is
 worldwide, and Beijing will continue to play off
 various Western suppliers to obtain the best deals.
 China increasingly will use such ploys as the helicop-
 ter competition in Tibet not only to evaluate Western
 equipment but also to place additional pressure on
 Western suppliers to provide their best at the lowest
 prices. Zhang Aiping's stopover in France on his way
 to Washington probably was designed to remind
 Washington that China has other arms-buying op-
 tions, and it is probably no coincidence that Navy
 Commander Liu Huaqing will visit London in No-
 vember to discuss arms transfers after his August
 talks in Beijing with US Navy Secretary Lehman.
 aiming to acquire a "second line" of Western technol-  25X1
 ogy. A knowledgeable Chinese official asserts that
 Beijing will accept a level of technology similar to that
 which the United States supplies to Pakistan, Egypt,
 and Taiwan
 We expect that differences between the armed forces
 as end users and the defense industries as producers
 will continue to make arms negotiations lengthy af-
 fairs. Although the PLA General Staff Department,
 through Baoli, has gained central leadership support
 for some purchases, opponents have many layers of    25X1
 Chinese bureaucracy in which to block deals not to
 their liking. According to the US defense attache in
 Beijing, He Pengfei estimated in May that 400 to 500
 people were involved in the decision to buy Sikorsky
 helicopters. Moreover, the defense industries have a
 strong ally in the NDSTIC, which opposes most direct
 buys that include no technology transfer.
 Beijing will not, however, attempt to "buy" military
 modernization from abroad. PLA leaders know that
 the PLA is far too large a force for China to bear the
 prohibitive price of buying outright the massive quan-
 tities of weapons needed to modernize the force.
 billion would be needed to "buy" defense moderniza-
 tion from abroad were too low. But Beijing can
 quickly redress some pressing deficiencies-such as
 the shortcomings in its antitank missiles-by judi-
 cious spending. The Chinese will acquire foreign
 equipment-mostly components to upgrade Chinese
 weapons-as an interim step until Chinese defense
 industries have been sufficiently upgraded over the
 next five years so that the Chinese may begin building
 advanced arms. Ultimately, China's vast military-
 industrial base will be the foundation on which
 Beijing builds a program of comprehensive military
 modernization
 Although Beijing openly claims it will only accept
 transfer of the most modern weapons and technology
 available, we believe Beijing is willing to accept less if
 it is convinced the equipment fills a major defense gap
 and is modern enough to counter the Soviet threat.
 The Chinese privately concede they are unlikely to
 receive Western approval to purchase the best and are
