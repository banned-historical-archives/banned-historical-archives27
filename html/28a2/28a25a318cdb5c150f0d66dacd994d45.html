APPENDIX A 
NON-MILITARY FACTORS AFFECTING BLOC CAPABILITIES 
INTERNAL POLITICAL FACTORS 
USSR 
1. It is inherently unlikely that the 25-year 
rule of Stalin could be ended, and his suc-
cessors assume control, without at least tem-
porary uncertainties and confusions within 
the USSR and the Bloc generally. Stalin's 
death removed from the Soviet power struc-
ture its chief arbiter and final authority ? 
the leader who provided a stabilizing influence 
for the regime and a living symbol around 
which to rally the population. Despite the 
extensive bureaucratization of the Soviet 
Party and governmental structures, the co-
hesion of the system depended in part on 
personal relations which have probably been 
upset by shifts of position among the topmost 
leaders and by the uncertainty that accom-
panied these shifts. The turnover among 
Party chieftains, which on the top included 
Presidium members Beria, Melnikov, and 
.Bagirov and Party Secretary Ignatiev, has 
been greater than for any comparable period 
since the purges of the 1930's. Extensive per-
sonnel changes throughout the apparatus of 
power may continue for some time, and it is 
possible that Soviet and Satellite leaders will 
be preoccupied by the prospects and the prob-
able consequences of such changes. There 
may consequently be occasional uncertainties 
in tactics and hesitancies in deciding on 
policy, even though the basic economic and 
military strength of the USSR and of the Bloc 
is virtually unaffected. 
2. The emphasis placed on the principle of 
"collective leadership," the strictures against 
one-man rule, and the condemnation of the 
cult of heroes suggest that no individual is yet 
ready to occupy the place of Stalin. Relation-
ships among present Soviet leaders are not yet 
clear. The reversal of the doctors' plot, the 
removal of several high-ranking persons from 
the Presidium, the many personnel changes in 
the governments of the Soviet Republics, and 
above all the arrest of Beria establish that 
there has been sharp dissension within the 
Soviet hierarchy. It is not yet clear whether 
this dissension arose principally from a strug-
gle for power or from differences over basic 
policy, nor is it clear whether Beria's fall has 
ended the dissension. 
3. The considerations cited above must be 
taken into account in estimating the situa-
tion within the Bloc. On the other hand, 
there is no evidence that the authority of the 
Soviet regime has in any fundamental respect 
been weakened by Stalin's death or by the 
events since that death. There are no indica-
tions that Soviet Bloc military and economic 
capabilities will be reduced, during the period 
of this estimate, by reason of a weakening of 
the Soviet regime. Since March 1953, the 
Party and governmental structure at both 
central and regional levels has been reor-
ganized and consolidated. Power has been 
placed in the hands of a group almost identical 
with the Stalinist Politburo. Malenkov ap-
pears to be increasing the firmness of his hold 
on the leading position of power, even if he 
has not yet assumed the peculiarly elevated 
position of Stalin. There is no evidence of a 
weakening of the Party's control over the 
security and military forces, or of a loosening 
of the regime's hold over the population. 
Furthermore, " the bureaucratization of the 
Soviet system and the interlocking character 
of Soviet controls gives the system a certain 
inertia and stability which will probably pre-
vent open conflicts from breaking out during 
the period of this estimate. 
The Satellites 
4. Soviet control over the European Satellites 
is essentially physical in character; i.e., it is

founded on military domination and is main-
tained by force. The force, however, is for 
the most part not exercised directly by organs 
of the USSR. Rather, it is exercised for the 
Kremlin by Satellite organs ? principally the 
local Satellite Communist leadership ? which 
are firmly under Moscow's control but which 
are made to appear distinct from Moscow and 
autonomous. These are intended to serve as 
a facade of ostensibly independent national 
government in each Satellite state, behind 
which Soviet policy can operate with mini-
mum use of Soviet manpower and with mini-
mum loss of efficiency through conflict with 
local usage and sensibilities. The depth and 
extent of the various Soviet controls vary 
somewhat from Satellite to Satellite. 
5. Recent developments in Eastern Europe 
indicate that the Soviet leadership continues 
to be faced with problems in the Satellites. 
During June and July new programs, both 
political and economic in nature, which called 
for a modification of extreme Sovietization 
policies, were announced in East Germany and 
Hungary. More limited changes in existing 
programs were also announced for the other 
Satellites. In East Germany these changes 
were accompanied by a popular uprising (16-
17 June) which has seriously undermined the 
prestige and authority of the East German 
Government, and compelled the USSR to use 
overt military force to keep the anti-Commu-
nist demonstrations under control. 
6. However, we believe that Soviet ability to 
maintain effective control in the European 
Satellites has not been impaired by anything 
that has happened since the death of Stalin. 
Soviet suppression of the riots in East Ger-
many demonstrated the thoroughness of that 
control, while at the same time indicating that 
the Satellite governments themselves may be 
unable, without Soviet armed force in reserve, 
to maintain their populations in subjection to 
the will of the Kremlin. The possibility that 
the Satellite populations will be encouraged 
to follow the example of popular resistance in 
East Germany may require the Soviet leaders 
to devote more attention and resources to the 
problem of control in the Satellites and thus 
somewhat reduce over-all Bloc capabilities. 
Communist China 
7. The Chinese Communist regime has firm 
control over the territory which it administers, 
and there is little likelihood of this control 
being threatened or shaken by domestie forces 
within the period of this estimate. The rela-
tions of Communist China to the USSR are 
more those of an ally than a Satellite. The 
alliance is based on a common ideology and at 
least a temporary community of interests 
which is not likely to be affected by changes 
in Kremlin leadership. Moscow and Peiping 
are apparently agreed upon the following 
aims: 
a. To eliminate Western power and influ-
ence from Asia. 
b. To increase Communist strength in Asia. 
c. To prevent the resurgence of an armed 
and non-Communist Japan. 
d. To advance the world Communist move-
ment; in particular, to divide the non-Com-
munist countries and to weaken their ability 
and determination to combat Communism. 
8. The military dependence of Communist 
China upon the USSR will almost certainly 
continue. The Chinese Communists have 
launched an industrialization program, which 
will require large-scale imports of capital 
equipment. So long as Western trade con-
trols continue, these requirements can be met 
only by imports from the Bloc. However, 
should there be a reduction of tension in Asia, 
the military and economic dependence of 
Communist China upon the USSR might be 
reduced. 
9. Sino-Soviet relations may be strained by 
problems relating to levels of Soviet economic 
aid, by the extent of Soviet military commit-
ments to Communist China, by disagreement 
over the control of border territories, and by 
the definition of Mao's role in the Asian Com-
munist movement. We believe that the new 
Soviet leadership will deal cautiously with Mao 
and that a split between Peiping and Moscow 
is unlikely during the period of this estimate, 
unless the stability of the Soviet regime should 
be seriously weakened. Mao Tse-tung may 
become disposed to increase the scope of his

independent activity in Asia, especially if any 
uncertainty of leadership within ,the USSR is 
long continued. However, the continuing 
military and economic dependence of Commu-
nist China on the USSR will limit Communist 
China's capacity for independent action. 
ECONOMIC FACTORS 
Introductory Note 
10. Estimates of Bloc economic developments 
must still be based largely upon an analysis 
of published Bloc economic plans and of re-
cent general trends in the USSR, the Satel-
lites, and Communist China. There are vari-
ous indications that the Bloc may in the near 
future devote a somewhat greater proportion 
of resources to the production of consumers' 
goods, and a smaller proportion to the produc-
tion of capital goods, than in the recent past. 
These indications are clearest with respect to 
East Germany and Hungary, but they are not 
lacking for the USSR itself. As yet they are 
insufficient to warrant an estimate that sig-
nificant changes in over-all Bloc economic 
policy have occurred or are likely to occur. 
We believe it unlikely that any changes which 
may be made in Bloc economic policy will 
significantly alter either the basic emphasis 
placed upon development of heavy industry 
and military potential or the general trends of 
Bloc economic development which have been 
observed since 1945, and on which our present 
estimate of probable future Bloc economic 
developments is largely based. However, the 
rate of increase in the production of capital 
goods, and perhaps of military end-items, may 
be smaller than that set forth in the projec-
tions presented in this estimate. 
General Trends 
11. The Soviet Bloc is self-sufficient in food, 
has a strong modern heavy industry, and 
possesses adequate supplies of nearly all the 
natural, resources required further to develop 
its industrial economy. The economies of the 
Satellites are being progressively integrated 
with that of the upsR in the interests of pro-
moting Bloc self-sufficiency and the growth of 
Bloc military production capacity. During 
the period of this estimate, the Soviet Bloc 
3 
economy will be capable of supporting a major 
war effort. 
12. The gross national product (GNP) of the 
Bloc has been increasing rapidly during the 
postwar years. Calculation of its magnitude 
and comparisons with prewar years are neces-
sarily subject to considerable error. We esti-
mate, however, that by 1948 the over-all level 
of production in the Bloc as a whole was ap-
proximately equal to that of the same terri-
tories in 1938. We estimate further that by 
1952, Bloc GNP was about one-third greater 
than in 1948, thus having increased on the 
average about 7-8 percent per annum. 
13. We believe that Bloc GNP will continue to 
increase, although at a somewhat reduced 
rate, during the period of this estimate. Un-
less there is a drastic reorientation of Bloc 
economic programs, the rate of growth of the 
Soviet economy will almost certainly remain 
higher than the rate which the US or any 
major Western state will maintain, and the 
rate of growth of the Bloc GNP will be about 
one and one-half times that of the NATO 
states.

14. Despite Soviet achievements during the 
postwar years, the output of the USSR during 
the period of this estimate will remain much 
lower than that of the US, and the output of 
the entire Bloc will remain much lower than 
that of the NATO states. We estimate that 
Soviet GNP was about one-quarter to one-
third that of the US in 1952, and that the GNP 
of the entire Bloc was about one-third that of 
We believe that for the Satellites the average 
annual rate of growth and the total increase 
in GNP during the period of this estimate will 
tend to fall close to the upper limit of the esti-
mated ranges.

uunrium 
the NATO states. These disparities in ratio 
terms will probably be reduced slightly dur-
ing the period of this estimate, although the 
Western superiority in absolute volume of 
production will be somewhat increased. Bloc 
output in the basic industries ? energy, min-
erals, metals, and chemicals ? will remain 
substantially below that of the NATO states. 
15. However, comparisons of total output of 
all types of goods and services are not neces-
sarily indicative of relative capacity to pro-
duce military equipment in peacetime. Since 
the end of World War II, the USSR has di-
verted a much larger proportion of its GNP 
to military purposes than has any Western 
state. We estimate that about one-sixth of 
the Soviet GNP is now devoted to military 
outlays, and that the proportion will probably 
remain at about this level through the period 
of this estimate. 
Probable Developments in Major Sectors 
of the Bloc Economy 
16. During the period of this estimate, the 
Bloc, and especially the USSR, will probably 
continue to concentrate upon expanding its 
industrial base. The level of Soviet indus-
trial production will probably be about one-
quarter higher in mid-1955 than at the end of 
1952. Output of producer goods and military 
end-items (measured in value terms) will con-
tinue to increase at faster rates than that of 
consumer goods, although, in line with Malen-
kov's recent announcement, output of con-
sumer goods may be increased more rapidly 
than we have estimated.2 Barring a drastic 
revision of economic programs, Satellite in-
dustrial production will probably increase 12 
to 15 percent during this period. Although 
Communist China's industrial output will 
probably rise by 20 to 23 percent during this 
period, it will continue to be a small part ofi 
the Bloc total. 
17. The growth of Bloc agricultural produc-
tion will probably continue to lag behind the 
growth of industrial production. Barring

sectors of the Bloc economy during this period,

heavy drought, Soviet agricultural output dur-
ing the period of this estimate will probably 
increase by 5-8 percent. However, imple-
mentation of the agricultural tax, price, and 
procurement policies announced by Malenkov 
may result in somewhat larger agricultural 
output. Assuming the continuation of grad-
ual collectivization of agriculture in the Satel-
lites, we estimate that Satellite agricultural 
production in mid-1955 will increase by only 
3-5 percent, and will remain below prewar 
levels. As a result of population increases, a 
slight decline in per capita food supply in the 
Satellites can be expected. Agricultural out-
put in Communist China which was unusually 
high in 1952 will probably not increase over 
that level during the period of this estimate, 
although it is probable that the general post-
war recovery trend in Chinese Communist 
agriculture will continue. 
18. Trade between the countries now compris-
ing the Bloc and the West3 has declined mark-
edly in the postwar period owing largely to 
the Bloc policy of economic self-sufficiency 
and to Western trade policy. In 1951, the last 
year for which full-year statistics are avail-
able, this trade amounted to roughly 2 per-
cent of the total trade of the West, compared 
with 6 percent in 1938. Bloc trade with the 
non-Communist world consists primarily of an 
exchange of Western capital goods, textile 
fibers, and industrial raw materials for coal, 
agricultural, and forest products from the 
Bloc. In 1951, textile fibers and manufac-
tures (21.8 percent) , machinery and transport 
equipment (21.1 percent) , crude rubber (12.8 
percent) , metals and manufactures (9.3 per-
cent) , and chemicals (8.6 percent) accounted 
for almost three-quarters of total Bloc im-
ports from the West. Similarly, Bloc exports 
of food products (39.7 percent) , coal (13.0 per-
cent) , forest products and manufactures (6.8 
percent) , and textile fibers and manufactures 
(8.0 percent) accounted for approximately 
two-thirds of total Bloc exports to the West. 
19. The gradual eastward shift in the center 
of gravity of Soviet industry will probably con-
tinue during the period of this estimate. 
a As used here, the "West" includes the whole non-
Communist world as presently constituted.

However, the older industrial regions (includ-
ing the Urals) will still provide the bulk of 
Soviet industrial production. Although pro-
grams to disperse Soviet industry and to 
create self-contained regional complexes will 
continue, the production of many basic mate-
rials and of most equipment will remain geo-
graphically concentrated. 
20. The USSR has a stockpiling program 
which is designed to maintain vital sectors of 
the economy under peacetime and wartime 
conditions and to facilitate the conversion of 
industry to a wartime footing. Stockpiles of 
food, raw materials, and capital equipment 
are maintained in regional base depots and in 
plants and warehouses. In peacetime, these 
stockpiles are used in emergencies, but only 
after normal plant stocks and inventories have 
been depleted. We are unable to estimate 
the magnitude and composition of the Soviet 
stockpiles, but increases in total production 
through mid-1955 will support an enlarged 
program. The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-
1955) called for doubling of Soviet stockpiles. 
Soviet-type stockpiling programs are being 
adopted throughout most of the Bloc. 
21. By mid-1955, the Bloc economy will have 
achieved a higher level of self-sufficiency than 
at present, altho,ugh certain imported items 
will remain of substantial importance to cur-
rent Bloc industrial and military production. 
These items include electronic tube com-
ponents, certain chemicals, certain types of 
machinery and equipment with their spare 
parts, and probably also tin, natural rubber, 
copper, zinc, and cork. If these items of im-
port ceased to be available, bottlenecks would 
appear in the Bloc productive system and dur-
ing a limited period of time adverse repercus-
sions would spread through the economy.4 
22. We estimate that by mid-1955 the Bloc 
economy will be better prepared to support a 
major war than in any previous year. The 
increase in the aggregate mobilization poten-
tial will result primarily from the expansion 
of the Bloc economy, especially the industrial 
base, and the continued growth of stockpiles

INZIE-59, "Probable Economic Effects of a Sev-
erance of East-West Trade" (16 April 1953) .

essential to maintaining production under 
war conditions. For example, in 1955 the 
USSR will probably produce 42 million tons 
of steel, in comparison with annual produc-
tion during World War II of less than 10 
million tons. However, the Bloc output in the 
basic industries (energy, minerals, metals, 
chemicals), and Bloc resources in technical 
manpower, machinery, and facilities will re-
main substantially below those of the NATO 
states during the period of this estimate. 
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL FACTORS 
23. Soviet scientific and technical capabilities 
have increased rapidly since World War II, 
and we believe that they will continue to in-
crease throughout the period of this estimate. 
The USSR has given science and technology 
a high priority and has given great emphasis 
to increasing the contribution of science and 
technology to Bloc military capabilities, with 
results most evident in the development and 
production of nuclear5 weapons, and to a 
lesser extent in air defense equipment. 
24. The scientific assets of the US (the num-
ber and quality of trained personnel, facilities, 
equipment, and financial support) are greater 
than those of the USSR, and the assets of the 
West as a whole are far greater than those of 
the Bloc. However, the USSR is expending 
great effort to reduce this disparity, and in 
some fields the USSR may have equalled or 
excelled the US. 
25. Soviet higher education in most scientific 
and technical fields is roughly comparable to 
that of the West, but a shortage of scientific 
and technical personnel will continue 
throughout the period of this estimate. We 
estimate that there are about 1,440,000 Soviet 
citizens who have received scientific or tech-
nical degrees from colleges and universities 
(about 80 percent the US total) . About 
185,000 people are engaged in scientific re-
search and in teaching science in the USSR, 
compared to about 240,000 similarly engaged 
5 The term nuclear weapons as used in this esti-
mate means all weapons employing the principle 
of nuclear fission or fusion or both in combina-
tion to contribute energy either directly or in-
directly to an explosion.

result of current research efforts.

in the US. We believe that during the period 
of this estimate the USSR will probably grad-
uate about 1.4 times as many people in engi-
neering and the physical sciences as will the 
US. 
26. Soviet science and technology are subject 
to the same type of centralized planning and 
control as all other Soviet activities. Even 
though Soviet scientists are a privileged group, 
their research is subject to many of the usual 
totalitarian restrictions. Such restrictions 
will probably have a more deadening effect 
upon long-range theoretical research than 
upon practical applications within the period 
of this estimate. While numerous theories 
in chemistry, physics, and biology have been 
attacked, there is no evidence that ideological 
restraints hamper developments directly af-
fecting military weapons. 
27. East Germany and Czechoslovakia, and to 
a lesser extent Poland and Hungary, possess 
scientific and technical manpower and facili-
ties which provide a significant increment to 
the total resources at the disposal of the Bloc. 
On the other hand, Communist China, be-
cause of the extreme shortage of scientific and 
technical manpower and facilities, is unlikely 
to contribute to Bloc science. 
Scientific and Technical Capabilities in 
Particular Fields 
28. The quality .of Bloc research in the sig-
nificant scientific fields varies greatly. In 
some fields, notably in mathematics, physics, 
and microbiology, much research is original 
and of high quality. On the other hand, pub-
lished Soviet research in most biological 
sciences and in medicine indicates that capa-
bilities in these fields are generally mediocre. 
29. Since World War II, the USSR has made 
substantial achievements in atomic energy, 
aircraft design and production, and electron-
ics. Soviet science will continue to contribute 
substantially to the increase of Bloc military 
strength and capabilities throughout the 
period of this estimate, particularly in the 
following fields: 
a. Nuclear Weapons. The Soviet atomic 
energy program will continue to have one of 
E4 
7 
the highest priorities in the allocation of Bloc 
resources. Soviet capabilities for atomic re-
search will remain considerably less than 
those of the US in both personnel and equip-
ment. We believe that the Soviet atomic 
energy program will continue to concentrate 
almost entirely upon the development and 
production of weapons.6 
b. Aircraft. The aircraft industry is esti-
mated to be technically capable of completing 
development and placing in production dur-
ing the period of this estimate the following 
types of aircraft: a heavy bomber, a jet 
medium bomber, an improved jet day inter-
ceptor, and a jet all-weather interceptor. In 
addition, several Soviet projects in the turbo-
jet field, including axial flow engines in the 
10,000 pound thrust class and at least one 
turbo-prop engine, are known to be in ad-
vanced stages of development. 
c. Electronics. The USSR has made sub-
stantial progress in expanding its electronics 
industry and in adapting Western equipment. 
The industry is now capable of independent 
research and development, and electronic 
equipment of modern design is being pro-
duced. We believe that during the period of 
this estimate the USSR will have the capa-
bility of developing new or improved versions 
of the following equipment: early warning 
radar, fire control radar, blind bombing/ 
navigational radar, and airborne intercept 
equipment. Some of these improved equip-
ments may be placed in production during the 
period. 
d. Electromagnetic Warfare. The USSR 
now has the capability seriously to disrupt 
Western long-range radio communications 
and certain navigation systems.7 Soviet capa-
bilities in related electronics fields indicate 
that the USSR is now capable of developing 
a See paragraphs 2 and 3 of Appendix B for esti-
mated size of the Soviet nuclear weapons stock-
pile, and for a discussion of Soviet capabilities 
in this field.

capabilities, see SE-38, "Probable Soviet Courses 
of Action in Electromagnetic Warfare" (24 April 
1953), and Appendices to SE-38, "Soviet Bloc 
Capabilities and Probable Courses of Action in 
Electromagnetic Warfare" (12 June 1953).

equipment for jamming frequencies up 
through 30,000 megacycles. On the basis of 
known or reported Soviet capabilities in the 
development of magnetrons, we believe that 
the USSR is now technically capable of pro-
ducing limited quantities of ground based and 
airborne jamming equipment to cover fre-
quencies through 10,000 megacycles. It is 
considered unlikely, however, that the USSR 
will have significant jamming capabilities in 
the frequency ranges above 10,000 megacycles 
during the period of this estimate. 
30. Chemical Warfare. The USSR has the 
capability to produce and disseminate stand-
ard CW agents. It also possesses scientific 
and technical capabilities for the production 
of nerve gases. Although there is much evi-
dence of research closely related to chemical 
warfare, there is no evidence that any bas-
ically new chemical warfare end-item is likely 
to be developed by mid-1955.. 
31. Biological Warfare. Soviet microbiolog-
ical research will probably continue to em-
phasize modification and stabilization of bac-
teria and viruses and, thereby, could lead to 
an increase of BW capabilities. On the basis 
of known and estimated Soviet capabilities, it 
is estimated that the USSR can produce and 
disseminate during the period of this estimate 
several highly virulent BW agents. The effec-
tiveness of these agents against livestock 
would probably be severe, against certain 
crops possibly severe, and against humans 
questionable. 
8 
32. Guided Missiles. While no Soviet mis-
siles are known to be operational now, the 
USSR Icould have several types operational 
within the period of this estimate. This esti-
mate is based principally upon the fact that 
the USSR has exploited the missiles in the 
German World War II program; the nature of 
Soviet work and the rate of progress subse-
quent to full utilization of German knowledge 
is largely unknown. 
a. Surface-to-Air Missiles, based on German 
designs (Wasserfall) with improved guidance, 
control, and homing, could be available now or 
in the immediate future. In addition, a sur-
face-to-air missile of native design could be 
developed by 1955. 
b. Surface-to-Surface-Missiles. It is known 
that the USSR has built at least a limited 
number of German V-1 and V-2 type missiles. 
A single stage ballistic missile, powered by a 
120-metric-ton thrust engine, could be near 
the prototype stage of production by 1955. 
The range of this missile with a one-ton war-
head would be less than 900 nautical miles; 
we believe that an "intercontinental" missile 
will not be available within the period of this 
estimate. 
c. Air-to-Surface Missiles. The USSR is 
capable of producing subsonic types, and some 
of these are probably available now. By 1955, 
a high subsonic speed rocket-powered glide 
bomb could probably become operational. 
d. Air-to-Air Missiles. Although the USSR 
has knowledge of two German subsonic 
winged rockets, there is no information on any 
Soviet interest in air-to-air guided missiles.

(Incl. 149

This estimate is based on a continuation of 
present conditions and is therefore highly 
tenuous. 
The estimate of heavy bombers and jet medium 
bombers is based on assumption of series pro-
duction of these types beginning by mid-1953 
and April 1954, respectively. There is presently 
no intelligence to indicate that either type is 
in series production or in use in operational 
units. If production actually begins before or 
after the dates indicated, the strength estimates 
shown will be affected accordingly. 
Major combatant-type surface vessels include 
battleships, heavy and light cruisers, and fleet 
and coastal destroyers. Some are obsolete or 
obsolescent. See attached Table for details. 
The number of weapons estimated is based on 
the assumption that the entire amount of fis-
sionable material believed available to the 
Soviets is fabricated into fission weapons of 30-
100 KT yield. 
9 
2. We believe that the USSR now has a stock-
pile of about 120 nuclear weapons of from 
30 to 100 kiloton yield. By 1955 the total 
number may be about 300 weapons of the 
same range of energy yield.4 In view of our 
uncertainty concerning the production of 
fissionable materials, particularly uranium-
235, the actual number of nuclear weapons 
may be as low as two-thirds or as high as 
twice this estimate. In the event that the 
USSR should choose to stockpile weapons of 
smaller or larger yield, the estimated number 
of weapons in the stockpile would be altered 
accordingly. 
3. On the basis of information now available 
on the Soviet explosion of 12 August 1953, it 
is concluded that the USSR is capable of pro-
ducing air delivery type nuclear weapons with 
explosive powers in the range of a few thou-
sand tons of TNT to approximately one million 
tons of TNT. Throughout this range ther-
monuclear reactions may be used to increase 
the energy yield from the fissionable mate-
rials present without directly contributing a 
substantial amount to the total energy yield. 
Having demonstrated the capability to utilize 
thermonuclear reactions to increase energy 
yields from fissionable materials, the Soviets 
may direct efforts toward the eventual modi-
fication of the estimated stockpile of 30 to 
100 KT weapons in one or more of the follow-
ing ways: 
a. Increase the number of 30 to 100 KT 
weapons. 
b. Increase the energy yield per weapon in 
the stockpile, the number being approximately 
the same. 
c. Produce very high yield weapons (e.g., 
500-1,000 KT) by accepting corresponding 
reductions in the total number of weapons in 
the stockpile. 
The 12 August test may also indicate an ad-
vanced stage, but not the culmination, of a

thermonuclear program having as an objec-
tive the production of weapons yielding more 
than a million tons of TNT in which thermo-
nuclear reactions directly contribute a sub-
stantial amount to the total energy yield. 
BLOC GROUND STRENGTH 
The Soviet Army 
4. We estimate that the Soviet ground forces 
now total about 2,500,000 men, and that the 
internal security forces constitute an addi-
tional 400,000 troops. The Soviet Army is 
estimated to consist of 175 line divisions (of 
which 105 are rifle divisions, 40 mechanized, 
25 tank, and 5 horse-cavalry) and 45 support-
ing divisions (25 antiaircraft and 20 artillery 
divisions). On the basis of present mobiliza-
tion plans, estimated trained reserves, and 
estimated stocks of military equipment, we 
believe that the Soviet Army and internal 
security forces could expand to a total 
strength of 7,500,000 organized into 300 line 
divisions, by - M+30 days. The estimated 
maximum mobilization potential by M-1-360 is 
12,500,000 men. In the absence of general 
war, however, we believe that the Soviet 
ground forces will remain at approximately 
the present size through mid-1955. The 
armament, the mobility, and capability of 
these forces for sustained combat will con-
tinue to improve, but the various armies, 
corps, and divisions will continue to vary 
greatly in quality. 
5. The Soviet ground forces are estimated to 
include approximately 100,000 trained para-
chutists and another 100,000 men in partially-
trained, air-transportable units. Airlift ca-
pacity is believed sufficient to permit a 
maximum-effort, single lift of about 28,000 
fully-equipped airborne troops, depending 
upon the availability of air facilities. 
6. The Soviet Army is the most powerful land 
force in the world today. Its combat effec-
tiveness is high; the senior command is dy-
namic and experienced; junior officers can be 
expected to execute orders faithfully; and the 
individual soldiers are courageous and have 
good physical stamina. Soviet equipment is 
plentiful and adequate in quality. In gen-
10 
eral, Soviet weapons compare favorably with 
Western types. Mobilization would lower in-
dividual unit efficiency but the rapid increase 
in numbers of units would tend to overcome 
the effects of this drop even in the short 
term. 
7. The Soviet Army has been reorganized and 
modernized since the end of World War IL 
We believe that current Soviet line divisions 
probably possess good equipment, generally of 
World War II design, in adequate quantity. 
The Soviet ground forces in Eastern Europe, 
particularly in Germany, probably constitute 
the best-equipped and best-trained units of 
the Soviet Army. Soviet forces in the Far 
East may also be at a somewhat higher level 
of readiness than other units in the USSR. 
The thorough Soviet training program prob-
ably ensures a high degree of combat skill. 
Discipline is good, and morale is almost cer-
tainly high. The training system provides an 
input to the ground reserve of something 
under 500,000 men each year. 
8. Soviet ground forces are concentrated pri-
marily in East Germany, the Western USSR, 
the Caucasus, and the Far East. This dis-
position facilitates logistical support and also 
provides for the defense and security of the 
most important and vulnerable areas of the 
USSR. 
9. The USSR is now manufacturing substan-
tial quantities of all types of basic ground 
force weapons. The volume of production is 
ample to meet the current requirements of 
the Bloc armed forces. During the period of 
this estimate, production of ground force 
weapons, with the possible exception of 
armored vehicles, is not expected to increase. 
10. Certain weaknesses of the Soviet Army 
will continue to limit its offensive capabilities 
during the period of this estimate. The great 
extent of Soviet territory and the limitations 
of the road and rail networks present difficult 
logistic problems. The Army lacks experi-
ence in large-scale combined amphibious 
operations, and it has never conducted suc-
cessful large-scale airborne operations in 
wartime. The Army suffers from a shortage 
of technicians, a weakness that is being met

by intensive pre-military and military train-
ing and by the recall of some specialists from 
the reserve. 
Soviet Ground Forces in Europe 
11. Soviet ground forces in Eastern Europe 
are organized into 30 line divisions totalling 
535,000 troops, of which 22 divisions com-
prising about 400,000 troops are in East Ger-
many. While not at full war strength, the 
highly mechanized Soviet group of armies in 
East Germany are in a high state of combat 
readiness and represent the core of Bloc mili-
tary power in Europe. 
The Satellite Armies 
12. Satellite ground forces constitute a sub-
stantial addition to Soviet military strength 
in Europe. We estimate that the Satellite 
armies including the East German Garri-
soned Peoples' Police (KVP) now total 1,286,-
000 men organized into 75 line divisions (57 
rifle, 1 cavalry, 11 mechanized, and 6 tank) , 
2 artillery divisions, 6 antiaircraft divisions, 
and various independent brigades and regi-
ments. The Satellite Security Forces consti-
tute an additional force of some 290,000 
troops. We estimate that by mid-1955 Satel-
lite ground forces will be stabilized at a 
strength of about 1,690,000 men, organized 
into about 100 line divisions. All Satellite 
forces will remain dependent upon Soviet 
logistical support. Trained reserves of the 
Satellite ground forces amount to approxi-
mately 5,000,000 men (of which only about 
1,500,000 are considered fully-trained). By 
mid-1955 trained ground reserves will total 
4,850,000 men, of which 2,500,000 will prob-
ably be fully-trained. There is little equip-
ment available for reserves, except in Bul-
garia and except for the equipment and stock-
piles of Soviet forces now stationed in East-
ern Europe. 
13. The Satellite 'armies are equipped largely 
with Soviet World War II equipment of good 
quality. The Satellites are now manufactur-
ing for their own use non-combat vehicles, 
light artillery, small arms, and ammunition. 
They are dependent upon the USSR for most 
of their tanks, self-propelled guns, and heavy 
artillery, and for some of their light artillery. 
11 
The most obvious deficiency is in motor trans-
port; few Satellite divisions are motorized or 
mechanized. However, a concentrated effort 
is being made to overcome this weakness by 
increasing deliveries of motor vehicles from 
the USSR and from Czechoslovakia and by 
some vehicle production in other countries. 
There will be major shortages of heavy armor 
and artillery at least until 1955. The Satel-
lite ground forces are also weak in communi-
cations equipment, and their antiaircraft de-
fenses have few gun-laying radars. 
14. Although the Satellite ground forces are 
being reorganized to conform to the Soviet 
pattern, differences still exist in training, 
equipment, morale, and general capabilities. 
Satellite war readiness should improve, how-
ever, by mid-1955 as the combat units become 
better organized and better equipped. The 
Bulgarian Army is considered the best of the 
Satellite forces. The Hungarian and Polish 
Armies, however, are being pushed toward the 
Bulgarian level of achievement. 
15. However, the relative unreliability of 
Satellite armed forces is a factor detrimental 
to Bloc military capabilities. The Kremlin 
could not now rely Upon the majority of the 
Satellite armies in a general war except for 
employment in secondary roles. If political 
tension and popular resistance in the Satel-
lites increase, the USSR may find the military 
usefulness of Satellite forces and Satellite ter-
ritories greatly reduced. 
Logistical Position 
16. Bloc ground forces in Europe al.e in a 
good logistical position. We estimate that 
the Soviets have a stock of equipment and 
supplies in Germany sufficient for 22 divisions 
for 80-90 days, or 60 divisions for 60 days of 
combat. We believe that. military stockpiles 
within the USSR, except for POL, are prob-
ably sufficient to maintain 175 divisions in 
combat for an extended period (i.e., up to one 
year, depending upon the intensity of com-
bat) The road, rail, and inland waterway 
G We have no estimate of POL stockpiles for 
ground forces alone; for all Soviet armed forces 
POL stockpiles are estimated sufficient for from 
4 to 6 months of combat.

nets in Eastern Europe are adequate to per-
mit full utilization of those Bloc divisions now 
in Eastern Europe and, in addition, to move 
and to support a considerable number of addi-
tional divisions from the USSR. 
Soviet Forces in the Far East 
17. The USSR represents both the founda-
tion and the arsenal of Bloc military power 
in the Far East. Soviet ground forces in the 
territory east of Lake Baikal operate within 
n autonomous command structure. These 
forces total an estimated 415,000 men, organ-
ized into 30 line divisions, of which 5 are 
mechanized and 1 tank. There are also 78,-
000 Soviet security troops in this area. We 
estimate that the USSR could mobilize an 
additional 15 divisions by M+30 days from 
three military districts which constitute the 
Soviet Far East. 
18. Transportation facilities constitute the 
major limitation upon the support of large-
scale military operations in the Far East over 
an extended period. The Trans-Siberian 
Railroad carries at least 90 percent of the 
*military supplies shipped from the western 
USSR to the Far East. The USSR has at-
tempted to reduce the danger deriving from 
this transport limitation by maintaining large 
reserves of military and other supplies in the 
Far East. However, the USSR has equipped 
and provisioned the North Korean Army and 
has furnished large amounts of equipment 
and POL to the Chinese Communists. While 
we do not know what proportion of these 
supplies were drawn from stocks in the Far 
East, we believe that Soviet forces in the Far 
East now have sufficient supplies and equip-
ment (with the exception of POL) to support 
30 divisions in combat from 6 to 8 months. 
Chinese Communist Army. 
19. The over-all strength of the Chinese Com-
munist Field Forces is estimated at 2,380,000 
troops, organized into 65 armies and 221 line 
divisions (194 rifle, 7 cavalry, 5 armored, 12 
artillery, and 3 parachute) and various inde-
pendent units. 
20. The Chinese Communist forces are bas-
ically infantry. Their weapons are a hetero-
geneous assortment of European, American, 
Japanese, and Soviet manufacture. Limited 
amounts of Soviet heavy equipment (tanks, 
artillery pieces, and trucks) have been re-
ported in various parts of China, but the ex-
tent of Soviet equipping of Chinese Commu-
nist units other than those in Korea is not 
known. Most of the armored equipment was 
apparently shipped to the Chinese Commu-
nists during late 1950 and early 1951, but 
ammunition and other types of material for 
the Chinese Communist armies in Korea has 
sinee been furnished on a continuing basis. 
Communist China has become increasingly 
dependent upon the USSR for ammunition, 
spare parts, POL, and replacement equipment, 
although this dependence has become less 
urgent with the termination of hostilities in 
Korea. We estimate that despite the flow of 
Soviet material, the disparity between the 
equipment of the average Chinese Communist 
division and that of the average Soviet divi-
sion will probably not be reduced significantly 
in this period. 
21. The morale and .combat effectiveness of 
the Chinese Communist troops in Korea and 
Manchuria are high. We estimate that the 
combat effectiveness of the Chinese Commu-
nist troops elsewhere will be lower because of 
the heterogeneity of the weapons and equip-
ment, deficiencies in heavy weapons, equip-
ment, training, and the lack of supporting 
services. The combat effectiveness of the 
Chinese Communist Army has also been 
limited by the absence of tactical air support. 
However, if Soviet aid in the form of advice 
and equipment continues, the over-all combat 
effectiveness of Chinese Communist forces will 
almost certainly continue to increase. 
North Korean Army 
22. We estimate that the North Korean Army 
now totals about 280,000 men, organized into 
18 rifle divisions, 7 infantry brigades, 6-10 
armored units up to regimental size, 2 mortar 
regiments, and 2 artillery regiments. 
23. The North Korean soldier in 1950 was well 
trained, but severe casualties forced the in-
duction of large numbers of untrained men 
into combat units. Recent evidence indicates

TOP SECRET 13 
that the past 12 months have been utilized 
to raise the standards of training and equip-
ment. Rigid discipline, experienced leader- . 
ship, and Soviet staff advice will continue to 
give the North Koreans a general over-all 
combat efficiency rating of from fair to good. 
Viet Minh Army 
24. We estimate that the Viet Minh military 
forces consist of a regular army of 123,000 
(organized into 6 infantry divisions, 1 artil-
lery division, and numerous independent for-
mations) , 62,000 regional troops, and 115,000 
poorly armed irregulars. The combat effec-
tiveness of the regular Viet Minh forces is 
considered fair, to good, considering the ter-
rain, climatic conditions, and type of opera-
tions conducted. Three-fifths of the regulars 
are deployed in the strategic Tonkin area. 
BLOC AIR STRENGTH 
Soviet Air Forces6 
25. We estimate that the Soviet Air Forces 
have an organizational strength of about 
20,500 aircraft, including 10,200 fighters, 
(8,700 jets) ; 2,600 attack aircraft; 3,500 light 
bombers (2,250 jets) ; and 1,200 piston medium 
bombers. We also estimate that the Soviet 
stored reserve of military aircraft is approxi-
mately equal in number to the aircraft in 
units. There are insufficient data available to 
permit a sound estimate of the composition of 
the reserve; however, we believe that most re-
serve aircraft are World War II piston types. 
26. Although the size of the total air establish-
ment is not likely to change appreciably 
through mid-1955, we estimate that a signifi-
cant increase in over-all operational effective-
ness will result as conversion to jet fighters 
and bombers progresses. We estimate that 
6 Current estimated over-all actual strength is 
about 85 percent of the estimated organiza-
tional strength. Actual strength of piston 
fighter, attack, and piston light bomber regi-
ments is estimated at 95-100 percent; transport 
and reconnaissance regiments are estimated at 
90-95 percent of organizational strength; jet 
fighter units are estimated to average approxi-
mately 80-85 percent; medium bomber 75-80 
percent; and jet light bomber, and jet recon-
naissance, 60-65 percent of organizational 
strength. 
by mid-1955 the Soviet Air Forces will have an 
organizational strength of about 20,500 in-
cluding 10,000 jet fighters; 2,500 attack air-
craft (1,000 jets) ; 3,700 light bombers (3,500 
jets) ; and 1,050 piston medium bombers, 50 
jet medium bombers, and 200 heavy bombers.7 
27. The Soviet Air Forces have been under-
going steady modernization. We estimate 
that about 50 percent of the aircraft are jets, 
compared with about 33 percent in mid-1952 
and about 40 percent in January 1953. We 
estimate that about 70-80 percent of organiza-
tional aircraft will be jets by mid-1955. 
MIG-15 types will probably be retained as a 
standard fighter aircraft through mid-1955. 
Improved fighter aircraft, probably an out-
growth of the MIG-15 type, are entering 
operational units but their characteristics are 
unknown. An all-weather jet interceptor may 
also have been developed, and may be in op-
erational use by mid-1955. During this 
period, bombers will probably receive consid-
erable emphasis. The 11-28 and Type 35 (jet 
light bombers) will constitute standard Soviet 
equipment during the period of this estimate. 
A new and improved jet light bomber may 
also enter service by mid-1955. Within the 
period of this estimate, the USSR may com-
plete development and begin series produc-
tion of a jet medium bomber. A heavy bomber 
may already be in production and, if it be 
assumed that series production began in mid-
1953, about 200 may be available by mid-1955.8 
28. The combat effectiveness of Soviet military 
aviation is, on the whole, not as good as that 
of the air forces of the US and the UK, and is 
expected to remain below US and UK stand-
ards throughout the period of this estimate. 
By mid-1955, air crew proficiency, quality of 
equipment, and standards' of maintenance and 
7 The estimate of heavy bombers and jet medium 
bombers is based on assumption of series pro-
duction of these types beginning by mid-1953, 
and April 1954, respectively. There is presently 
no intelligence to indicate that either type is in 
series production or in use in operational units. 
If production actually begins before or after the 
dates indicated, the strength estimates shown 
will be affected accordingly.

training will have improved generally. How-
ever, units operating advanced and complex 
equipment (e.g., in all-weather fighters) prob-
ably will not have resolved all of the problems 
which accompany the introduction of such 
equipment. 
29. The aircraft industry has been maintained 
in steady operation throughout the postwar 
period. Soviet aircraft and aero-engine in-
dustries are estimated to be currently operat-
ing at about one-third their maximum peak. 
We believe that two years would be required 
for the industry to reach capacity production. 
We estimate combat aircraft production in 
1952 was:

30. The present logistical position of Soviet 
military aviation is good, and will probably 
improve during the period of this estimate. 
31. We believe that about 60 percent of the 
present total Soviet air strength, including 
nearly 65 percent of the jet fighter force and 
almost 85 percent of the medium bomber 
force, is now concentrated in Eastern Europe 
and the western and southwestern portions of 
the USSR. We believe that these dispositions 
will not change significantly by mid-1955 ex-
cept that a greater proportion of the total 
medium bomber strength will be stationed in 
the Far East. 
32. There are five major combat components 
of Soviet military aviation: The Air Force of 
the Soviet Army, Fighter Aviation of Air De-
fense, Long-Range Aviation, Naval Aviation, 
and Aviation of Airborne Troops.9 
The Civil Air Fleet, while not an operational 
component of Soviet military aviation, is under 
the War Ministry. Together with other civil air 
organizations, it operates about 1,650 transports 
on scheduled and non-scheduled operations. It 
could make an estimated 1,000 of these available 
for military purposes. However, this would pro-
duce a corresponding reduction in Soviet domes-
tic air transport. 
a. The Air Force of the Soviet Army 
(1) The Air Force of the Soviet Army, 
consisting of units assigned to the 14 Tac-
tical Air Armies and to the 4 Military Dis-
trict Air Forces, is the largest component of 
Soviet military aviation. The primary mis-
sions of the Air Force of the Soviet Army are 
to carry out tactical operations in support 
of ground forces and to defend areas against 
penetration by hostile aircraft. In areas 
where other fighter forces are available, the 
interception mission is shared with fighter 
units subordinate to Fighter Aviation of Air 
Defense, or to Naval Aviation. 
(2) We estimate that the Air Force of the 
Soviet Army has an organizational strength 
of 11,100 aircraft including 4,020 jet fight-
ers, 1,750 jet light bombers, and 2,440 at-
tack aircraft. The estimated organiza-
tional strength by mid-1955 will also be 
11,100 aircraft, of which 4,400 will be jet 
fighters, 2,600 jet light bombers, and 900 jet 
attack aircraft. The Soviets are continu-
ing to employ the I1-10 (Stormovik) piston 
attack aircraft for close support operations. 
There are indications, however, that the 
MIG-15 and the 11-28 may assume ground 
support roles on an interim basis, until an 
aircraft specifically designed for this work 
appears in operational units. 
b. Fighter Aviation of Air Defense 
(1) Fighter Aviation of Air Defense has 
the mission of defending important target 
areas in the USSR. In many areas it shares 
this mission with fighter elements of the 
Air Force of the Soviet Army and Naval 
Aviation. The force has an organizational 
strength of 3,500 interceptor aircraft, of 
which 3,100 are jets. By mid-1955, the 
estimated organizational strength will be 
3,500 jet interceptor aircraft. 
c. Long-Range Aviation 
(1) Long-Range Aviation, consisting of 
3 Air Armies, 1 in the Far East and 2 in 
Western USSR, plus units of undetermined 
subordination, constitutes the strategic 
striking force of the Bloc. This force has 
an estimated actual strength of 1,000 piston 
medium bombers (TU-4's) ; and an organi-
zational strength of 1,220 piston medium

TOP SECRET 
bombers. By mid-1955, we estimate that 
the bomber force of Soviet Long-Range 
Aviation will maintain approximately 'its 
present organizational strength, but may 
include up to 50 jet medium bombers and 
200 heavy bombers.n During the period of 
this estimate, the TU-4, the only known 
operational Soviet bomber capable of de-
livering the atomic bomb in the US, will 
remain the principal vehicle for Soviet inter-
continental operations. The TU-4, under 
normal operating conditions, is estimated to 
have a combat radius of 1,700 nautical miles 
and a combat range of 3,100 nautical miles 
with a 10,000 pound bomb load." 
(2) We believe that the over-all combat 
effectiveness of Soviet Long-Range Aviation 
will continue to remain well below that of 
the US strategic air arm. The average 
Soviet medium bomber crew is considered 
less skilled than the average US medium 
'bomber crew of World War II. Moreover, 
Soviet staff planners lack the extensive 
operational experiences obtained by the US. 
However, Soviet Long-Range Aviation is 
known to be undergoing a training pro-
gram for strategic bombing missions, and 
selected crews probably could, within the 
limitations set by equipment, approach 
standards attained by present average US 
crews. Moreover, bombing capabilities are 
enhanced by the abundance of Western 
target and navigational data which is read-
ily available to the Soviets. 
(3) On the whole, the chief limiting fac-
tors in the operational effectiveness of 
Soviet Long-Range Aviation in the conduct 
of long-range strategic air missions are: 
(a) the absence of advanced bases; (b) the 
performance characteristics of the TU-4 
1? The estimate of heavy bombers and jet medium 
bombers is based on assumption of series pro-
duction of these types beginning by mid-1953, 
and April 1954, respectively. There is presently 
no intelligence to indicate that either type is in 
series production or in use in operational units. 
If production actually begins before or after the 
dates indicated, the strength estimates shown 
will be affected accordingly.

Mid-1955" (3 August 1953) . 
15 
aircraft and its associated equipment; (c) 
the current lack of a true intercontinental 
bomber; and (d) the lower proficiency of 
the average Soviet long-range bomber crew, 
compared to its US counterpart. By mid-
1955, it is expected that the USSR will have 
made progress in overcoming some of the 
limitations cited above. 
d. Naval Aviation is responsible for cooper-
ation with naval surface and submarine units, 
furnishing close support for the seaward 
flanks of the Soviet ground forces, and for air 
defense of certain areas, a mission which it 
shares, in most cases, with fighter elements 
of Fighter Aviation of Air Defense and the 
Air Force of the Soviet Army. It is capable 
of providing fighter cover for naval units 
within a combat radius of 360 nautical miles 
from shore bases. Naval Aviation can per-
form antisubmarine patrol, aerial reconnais-
sance, and aerial-mining, and it is equipped 
to deliver torpedo, rocket, and bombing at-
tacks against surface vessels. It is estimated 
that Naval Aviation has an organizational 
strength of 3,600 aircraft, including 1,960 
fighters (1,560 jets) ; 940 light bombers (490 
jets) ; and 390 reconnaissance aircraft (310 
jets). 
e. Aviation of Airborne Troops has the 
mission of conducting airborne training 
and providing airlift and equipment for air-
borne operations. Its organizational aircraft 
strength consists of approximately 550 trans-
port aircraft and 250 gliders. Transport air-
craft from other Soviet aviation components 
and the Civil Air Fleet would have to be uti-
lized to supplement the aircraft of this com-
ponent for large-scale airborne opera-
tions. (See paragraph 5, Appendix B, for 
Airborne troop strengths.) 
Satellite Air Forces 
33. It is estimated that the jet fighter re-
equipment program of the Satellite air forces 
will have been completed by mid-1955. In 
addition, the Soviets have begun to re-equip 
at least one of the Satellites with jet light 
bombers (I1-28's). These developments por-
tend increased operational capabilities. How-
ever, development of these capabilities will be

TOP SECRET 16 
dependent on the Soviet assessment of the 
political reliability of the Satellite air forces. 
We estimate that these air forces have an 
organizational strength of about 3,200 air-
craft, including 1,430 jet fighters, 310 piston 
fighters, 680 ground attack, 470 light bombers 
(80 jets), and 140 transports.12 The organi-
zational strength of the Satellite air forces, 
by mid-1955, will be approximately 3,300 air-
craft, of which 1,500 will probably be jet 
fighters and 120 jet light bombers. The 
Satellite forces will remain almost completely 
dependent upon the USSR for logistic sup-
port, and virtually all aircraft will be Soviet 
types. 
Communist Air Forces in China (CAFIC) 
34. The strength and capabilities of the Com-
munist Air Forces in China have been in-
creasing steadily. The estimated organiza-
tional strength of the CAFIC is 2,400 opera-
tional aircraft, including 1,500 jet fighters, 
200 piston fighters, 160 ground attack, 360 
light bombers (100 jets) , 10 piston medium 
bombers, and 170 transports.13 Assuming 
that Soviet support continues in the future 
on the same scale as in the past, it is esti-
mated that by mid-1955 the organizational 
strength of this force will be about 3,550 air-
craft, including 2,100 jet fighters, 300 piston 
fighters, 300 ground attack, 510 light bombers 
(160 jets), 50 piston medium bombers, 240 
transports, and 50 piston reconnaissance. 
We estimate that the CAFIC will remain de-
pendent upon the USSR for aircraft and 
equipment, spare parts, technical supervision, 
and aviation fuel and lubricants. 
35. CAFIC combat potential has been in-
creased during the past few months by the 
conversion of two light bomber regiments in 
Manchuria to 11-28 light bombers., The 
" It is estimated that the over-all actual strength 
of Satellite air forces is about 65 percent of 
organizational strength. The actual jet fighter 
strength is estimated to be 40 percent of organi-
zational fighter strength. 
" It is estimated that the over-all actual strength 
of Chinese Communist air forces is about 85 
percent of organizational strength. The actual 
jet fighter strength is estimated to be 75 percent 
of organizational fighter strength. 
CAFIC has not demonstrated any capability 
for carrying out either air-ground support 
operations or high-altitude bombing. The 
effectiveness of the CAFIC will probably con-
tinue to improve throughout the period of 
this estimate through increased proficiency of 
flying personnel. However, over-all effective-
ness will be largely determined by Soviet will-
ingness to continue to supply additional air-
craft, especially jet fighters and jet light 
bombers, together with the necessary parts 
and equipment. 
BLOC NAVAL STRENGTH 
Soviet Naval Forces 
36. The tasks assigned the Soviet Navy (in-
cluding Naval Aviation) in the discharge of 
its mission are: 
a. Offshore and inshore defense of the 
maritime frontiers; 
b. Protection of the sea approaches and 
coastal lines of communications; 
c. Conduct and support of amphibious 
operations; 
d. Offensive action against hostile naval 
units and enemy sea lines of communications; 
e. Protection of the seaward flank of a 
ground campaign. 
37. The total surface strength of the Soviet 
Navy is about 184 major combatant-type sur-
face vessels,14 and some 2,000 escort, patrol, 
mine, amphibious, and auxiliary types. Ma-
jor ship strength centers around 6 effective 
heavy cruisers, 15 effective light cruisers, and 
116 effective destroyers. We further esti-
mate that there are 348 submarines,15 of 
which 112 are long-range (combat radius of 
3,500-6,000 nautical miles), 88 medium-range 
(combat radius of 1,000-1,800 nautical miles), 
" Major combatant-type surface vessels include 
battleships, heavy and light cruisers, and fleet 
and coastal destroyers.. Some are obsolete or 
obsolescent. See Table for details. 
Obsolete submarines have been omitted from this 
figure; included are 12 long-range, 32 medium-
range, and 38 coastal submarines which are 
obsolescent (overage) by US standards.

TOP SECRET 
and 148 coastal submarines.16 Naval Avia-
tion has an authorized strength of 3,600 air-
craft of which 1,560 are jet fighters. 
38. The Soviet Navy has an estimated per-
sonnel strength of about 895,000 men, in-
cluding about 95,000 attached to Naval Air. 
This total includes 400,000 General Service, 
of whom 100,000 are in training, 275,000 in 
Coastal Defense and Naval Infantry, and 
125,000 in coastal (border) security opera-
tions, such as beach patrols and lookouts, 
offshore patrol craft and small bases for pa-
trol craft, and communications for coastal 
security. Current reserve strength of the 
Soviet Navy personnel is approximately 
1,000,000. We estimate that reserve strength 
will be maintained at this level through mid-
1955. 
39. There is no force in the Soviet Navy 
comparable to the amphibious forces of the 
US Navy, although the naval infantry com-
ponents have received training in amphibious 
warfare. The Soviet Navy does not possess 
sufficient modern amphibious vessels and 
craft to launch and sustain long-haul am-
phibious operations. It is capable, however, 
of mounting short-range lifts in considerable 
force. 
40. We estimate that by mid-1955 the Soviet 
Navy will have a total of 240 major com-
batant-type surface vessels, centering around 
6 effective heavy cruisers, 21 effective light 
cruisers, and 163 effective fleet destroyers.17 
The total of minor and auxiliary vessels prob-
ably will not increase substantially, but will 
comprise a greater percentage of new and 
modernized units. We also estimate that by 
mid-1955 there will be 377 submarines, of 
which 149 will be long-range, 72 medium-
range, and 156 coastal types.18 Newly con-
" We have no evidence that Soviet submarines are 
fitted with snorkel, other than the 16 acquired 
from the Germans. We estimate that they 
could be so fitted at the rate of about 25 percent 
of the force per year. We believe new Soviet 
submarines are or will be so fitted, but feel it 
unlikely that those approaching the end of their 
fully effective life will be so equipped. 
" See Table for details. 
" Obsolete submarines have been omitted from the 
1955 totals; a number of obsolescent but still 
usable submarines are included. 
17 
structed submarines will probably have in-
creased combat radii. We believe that the 
organizational strength of Naval Aviation 
will be about 3,600 aircraft in 1955. How-
ever, almost all aircraft will be jet types. 
41. The operational efficiency of the Soviet 
Navy is still below that of the navies of the 
major Western Powers. However, it will con-
tinue to improve during this period, and by 
mid-1955 it will probably equal that of West-
ern navies in the employment of small craft. 
It may approach US standards in operations 
involving major combatant-type ships. Rel-
atively little' is known of the operating effi-
ciency of the Soviet submarine force, but it 
must be assumed that it has profited by the 
lessons of World War II, and from German 
experience. Personnel of the submarine force 
are the pick of the Soviet Navy, and their 
morale is high. Like other elements of the 
fleet the submarine force is believed to be in a 
good state of operational readiness. 
42. We estimate that adequate supplies of 
ammunition, stores, and POL are now avail-
able in all areas except the Far East to service 
the Soviet fleet for a period of one year at the 
present scale of operations. In the Far East, 
POL supplies are adequate only for six 
months. 
43. The mine warfare capabilities of the 
Soviet Navy are extensive, and pose a serious 
potential threat to Allied naval operations in 
Europe and the Far East. Nearly all Soviet 
warships, including most of the lesser vessels, 
are equipped to lay mines, and the capabili-
ties of submarines and aircraft in this respect 
extend the range of the threat to the Western 
approaches of the British Isles, the Far East-
ern island chains, and the Mediterranean 
area. Large stocks of German World War II 
mines were captured by the Soviets, and de-
velopmental work has been given a high pri-
ority. The Soviet Navy is known to have 
large stocks of mines, probably including all 
types. 
44. Naval construction in the Soviet Union 
is presently estimated at about 175,000 NSDT

(Naval Standard Displacement Tons) per 
year, broken down as follows: 
Cruisers 3.5 Ocean Patrol 
Destroyers 20 Submarines 20 
Smaller Types 110 Coastal 
Submarines 20 
We believe this tonnage total could be raised 
to 485,000 NSDT per year by utilizing the 
entire Soviet ship-building capacity on a one-
shift basis, and, by using Satellite facilities, to 
773,000 NSDT. Currently 6 large vessels, of 
which 3 are known to be cruisers, are under 
construction. Probably 4 of these have 
reached the fitting-out stage. Construction 
of battleships and carriers is possible in all 
fleet areas except the Far East. There is no 
firm evidence of such construction, and we 
believe it unlikely that any ships of these 
types will become operational during the 
period of this estimate. 
45. The operating forces of the Soviet Navy 
are divided among four major fleet areas, 
Baltic, Northern, Black Sea, and Pacific. The 
Baltic and Pacific Fleets are each sub-divided 
into two components covering the northern 
and southern sectors of their areas of respon-
sibility. Each of the six fleets has a naval air 
component directly under the operational con-
trol of the naval commander. In addition to 
the fleets there are three flotillas which serve 
as local defense forces ,on the Amur and 
Danube Rivers, and the Caspian Sea. (See 
Table for detailed composition of these fleets.) 
a. Baltic: This is the largest Soviet fleet 
concentration; it consists of the 4th and 8th 
Fleets, to which should be added the Polish 
and East German sea forces. Submarine 
forces assigned are estimated at 138, of which 
88 are long and medium-range craft. With 
the use of merchant shipping normally in the 
area (approximately 450,000 GRT) , amphibi-
ous lift and support for a force of 100,000 men 
could be provided, but the port capacity in the 
target area selected would be the controlling 
factor in determining the actual size of the 
force to be lifted. Naval Aviation assigned to 
the Baltic Fleets has an organizational 
strength of 1,020 aircraft including 340 jet 
fighters and 160 jet light bombers. 
b. Northern: The Northern Fleet comprises 
2 cruisers, 31 destroyer types, and approxi-
mately 192 escort, mine, amphibious, and 
auxiliary craft. Submarine strength is esti-
mated at 33, all but 4 of which are long or 
medium-range types. With merchant ship-
ping normally in the area, amphibious lift for 
about one division (14,000 men) is available. 
Naval Aviation assigned has an organizational 
strength of 370 aircraft, of which about 170 
are jet types, largely fighters. 
c. Black Sea: The Black Sea Fleet comprises 
2 battleships, 8 cruisers, 26 destroyer types, 
and approximately 298 escort, mine, am-
phibious, and auxiliary vessels. The Black 
Sea Satellites (Rumania and Bulgaria) add 
5 destroyers and some 90 other craft to this 
total. Naval Air has an organizational 
strength of 600 planes, including 300 jet 
fighters and 90 jet light bombers. About 70 
submarines are assigned to this Fleet, of which 
27 are long and medium-range types. Mer-
chant shipping in the area generally averages 
about 188,000 GRT, and amphibious lift for 
40,000-45,000 troops and their continuing re-
supply is possible. Port facilities in the tar-
get area would determine the actual size of 
the assault. 
d. Far East: The 5th and 7th Fleets in the 
Far East total 2 cruisers, 47 destroyer types, 
and about 340 escort, mine, amphibious, and 
auxiliary vessels. The Chinese Communist 
Navy could provide another 130 minor vessels. 
An estimated 107 submarines are based in the 
area, of which more than half are long and 
medium-range types. Naval Air assigned to 
the Far Eastern Fleets has an organizational 
strength of 1,610 aircraft, of which 800 are jet 
fighters and 200 jet light bombers. With the 
use of merchant vessels, amphibious lift for 
about 120,000 troops against Japan is avail-
able. In addition the Chinese Communists 
have sufficient shipping to lift about 200,000 
troops for a short distance. Early acquisition 
of port facilities and good weather conditions 
would be essential for any assault in force. 
46. The principal weakness of the Soviet Navy 
will continue to derive from the division of its 
major surface forces, which, because of their 
widely separated bases, are not mutually sup-

TOP SECRET 
porting. This seriously complicates admin-
istrative control, logistic support, and strate-
gic mobility, although the development of the 
inland waterway system and the increased 
use of the Northern Sea Route now permit 
some interchange of vessels. A further weak-
ness is the lack of adequate supply lines to 
the Northern and Far Eastern areas. 
47. The tasks assigned Naval Aviation in-
clude: air cover and support for amphibious 
operations, antishipping strikes, aerial mine-
laying, air reconnaissance, and antisubmarine 
operations. It also has the function of pro-
viding air defense within its operating areas. 
In this regard it is closely integrated with the 
over-all air defense system. Each of the 6 
fleet commanders in the 4 major sea areas has 
direct operational control of the naval air 
components assigned. During the postwar 
period training has been stepped-up, with the 
emphasis on night and all-weather flying, for-
mation flying, gunnery, and bombing. Night 
and all-weather capabilities nevertheless re-
main relatively low. Exercises aimed at the 
improvement of coordination between air, sur-
face, and sub-surface elements have been 
noted. 
Satellite and Chinese Communist Navies 
48. The strength of both the Satellite and 
Chinese Communist Navies during the period 
of this estimate will remain negligible. The 
naval forces of the Satellites will probably be 
capable of aiding the Soviet Navy in mine-
sweeping, minelaying, escort, and coastal de-
fense duties. The Chinese Communist Navy, 
although small and ill-equipped, is the largest 
indigenous naval force in the Far East. It is 
capable of short-haul amphibious operations, 
coastal mining, motor torpedo attacks, limited 
escort work, and minor gunfire support. The 
Soviet Far Eastern Naval Forces are providing 
training, advisors, and logistic support to this 
force. 
Bloc Merchant Fleet 
49. We estimate that the Soviet Bloc seagoing 
merchant fleet (including Communist Chinese 
vessels) totals 788 ships (1,000 gross tons up-
ward) of 3,393,025 deadweight tons. More 
19 
than 80 percent of these ships are slow and 
overage. Since the end of World War II the 
Bloc has continually sought to strengthen the 
merchant fleet, and still retains, despite re-
peated requests for their return, some 38 lib-
erty ships from US Lend-Lease. We estimate 
that by mid-1955 the merchant marine of the 
Soviet Bloc will reach a total of 873 vessels of 
3,641,740 deadweight tons. 
BLOC AIR DEFENSES 
Soviet Air Defense System' 
50. The USSR maintains a large air defense 
system which includes the active air defense 
elements of all military services under the 
operational control of a single air defense 
organization (PVO-Strany). A passive de-
fense organization, which includes the re-
sources of the police and other civil organiza-
tions, is also under control of PVO-Strany. 
The European Satellite and Chinese Commu-
nist air defenses are integrated with those of 
the Soviet system. We estimate that the Bloc 
has the capability of providing vigorous op-
position against air attacks on critical targets 
in the interior of the USSR, under conditions 
of good visibility. Under clear moonlit night 
conditions, Bloc defense capabilities are fair 
against piston bombers and negligible against 
jet bombers. Under conditions of poor visi-
bility, day or night, Bloc interception capa-
bilities are negligible. Deficiencies are re-
lated generally to equipment and to associated 
training which is directly conditioned by the 
availability and capabilities of equipment. 
The lack of operational interceptor units 
equipped and trained for all-weather opera-
tions is the most critical deficiency. A limited 
number of all-weather jet interceptors may be 
in operation by mid-1955. We believe that, 
during the period of this estimate, gradual 
improvements will be made in the following 
aspects of the air defense system: 
a. Early Warning 
(1) While areas along the northern and 
southern borders may have some radar gaps, 
it is believed that significant numbers of 
early warning and GCI radars will be found 
" See paragraphs 32-a and 32-h, Appendix B.

TOP SECRET 20 
on approaches to the most important areas 
in the USSR. Radar coverage during the 
period of this estimate is expected to develop 
further along lines indicated during the 
past two years, the most notable feature of 
which will be the introduction of more mod-
ern radars in the early warning system. 
Low altitude coverage will continue to be a 
problem and will be only partially, offset by 
the use of ground observers. 
(2) It is estimated that by the year 1955, 
the Soviets will have several types of early 
warning radars which when suitably em-
ployed together in an early warning system 
should afford reasonable coverage against 
medium bombers flying up to 60,000 feet 
altitude; such a system should provide reli-
able detection range from 120 to 170 nau-
tical miles. Detection ranges against fight-
er aircraft at the same altitude should be no 
more than 75-80 nautical miles. 
b. Ground Control of Interception 
(1) The capacity of the air warning and 
control system will probably show a steady 
increase during the period of this estimate. 
The advancements in the technical equip-
ment field will not be reflected immediately 
in increased system capacity. ? As new and 
improved equipment becomes available and 
training continues, the system capacity will 
improve as a result of increases in the num-
ber of targets one radar can hold under 
surveillance, increases in the over-all target 
reporting capacity before saturation point 
is reached, and an increased fighter aircraft 
control capacity. 
(2) Improvements in radar, communica-
tions (particularly through use of UHF 
radio) , and identification methods should 
result in more effective use of close control 
methods for fighter interceptions. Present 
use of fighter grid and zonal systems em-
ployed in controlling fighters is expected to 
be largely replaced by vectoring for close 
control. 
(3) Within the period of this estimate, 
the USSR is expected to have GCI radar of 
several types, including the V?Beam sets 
presently in use, which should be capable 
of detecting medium bombers at a maxi-
mum range of 120-170 nautical miles. 
They also should provide reliable coverage 
for interceptor control, without the use of 
transponder beacons, to a maximum range 
of 70-85 nautical miles and an altitude cov-
erage up to 40,000-42,000 feet. The use of 
transponder beacons in Soviet interceptor 
aircraft, a development of which the Soviet 
Union is capable, would increase range and 
altitude coverage for controlled intercep-
tion. 
c. Communications 
(1) Control center operating procedures 
are expected to improve. The filtering 
phase of air raid reporting procedures will 
continue to be a major problem during the 
period of this estimate. The increasing 
numbers of V?Beam radars will probably 
reduce the amount of filtering required at 
the collection center level since much of the 
filtering will probably be completed at the 
radar site. However, filtering will still be 
required at the various control centers 
where overlapping coverage will result in a 
duplication of information. 
(2) Wider use of newer radars will tend 
to increase warning time available and will 
tend to improve the handling capacity of 
the raid reporting system by reduction of 
filtering requirements. The increasing use 
of multi-channel microwave radio link sys-
tems will improve air defense capabilities as 
well as greatly increasing security and de-
creasing vulnerability to jamming. None of 
the equipment changes are expected to alter 
reporting procedures mate.rially; however, 
some refinement of present procedures will 
undoubtedly take place in order to improve 
the passing of raid reports for timely ap-
praisal and action. 
d. Fighter Aircraft 
Improved fighter aircraft, probably an out-
growth of the MIG-15 type, are entering 
operational units, but their characteristics 
are virtually unknown. An all-weather jet 
interceptor may also have been developed, 
and may be in operational use by mid-1955. 
e. AI Radar 
We know that the USSR has World War II 
airborne intercept equipment obtained from 
the Germans and through Lend-Lease. We

TOP SECRET 
estimate that the USSR has the technical 
knowledge and production capability to pro-
duce an Al radar superior to World War II 
types as well as passive detection Al equip-
ment of electronic, infrared, and possibly 
sonic types. The USSR almost certainly now 
has experimental quantities of some type of 
Al equipment. It may now have some type 
of Al equipment available for limited opera-
tional use, although the indications are not 
yet conclusive. We estimate that Al equip-
ment will come into operational use within 
the period of this estimate. (See d. above.) 
f. Antiaircraft Weapons 
(1) AAA. It is estimated that during the 
period under consideration the Sbviets will 
employ a family of antiaircraft artillery 
weapons capable of delivering continuously 
pointed fire against subsonic aerial targets 
at all altitudes up to 36,000-38,000 feet with 
barrage types of fire up to about 45,000 
feet. Sufficient numbers of directors and 
gun-laying radar will be available for em-
ployment with the medium and heavy type 
guns. 
(2) Unguided AA Rockets. Supersonic 
unguided AA rockets may be available, but 
it is believed that dispersion problems will 
limit their employment as a predicted fire 
weapon to about 40,000 feet with a barrage 
fire capability up to about 50,000 feet. 
(3) Surface-to-Air Missiles. Surf ace-to-
air missiles based on German designs 
(Wasserf all) with improved guidance, con-
trol, and homing could be available now or 
in the immediate future. In addition, a 
surface-to-air missile of native design could 
be developed by 1955. 
(4) Air-to-Air Missiles. Although the 
USSR has knowledge of two German sub-
sonic winged rockets, there is no informa-
tion on any Soviet interest in air-to-air 
missiles. Air-to-air unguided rockets un-
doubtedly would be used; it is possible that 
air-to-air rockets might incorporate homing 
heads. 
Satellite and Chinese Communist 
Air Defenses s 
51. The European Satellite and Communist 
Chinese air defense systems are integrated 
21 
with the Soviet system. They deepen the 
Bloc early warning coverage net. Despite 
some increase in the air defenses of the Satel-
lites and of Communist China (notably in 
the Korea-Manchuria area), we estimate that 
during the period of this estimate the air de-
fenses of both the Satellites and Communist 
China will remain inferior to those of the 
USSR. 
Soviet Civil Defense 
52. The USSR has a large, complex, and well-
organized civil defense system which is in-
tegrated into the over-all Soviet Air Defense 
Organization (PVO). The civil defense sys-
tem includes a full-time civil defense staff or-
ganization. Comprehensive plans have been 
made for utilizing existing agencies and facili-
ties, and for training large groups by various 
mass organizations, but there is no evidence 
of present mass participation in the civil de-
fense program, or of a program of passive 
defense measures specifically designed for 
defense against atomic attack. In addition, 
civil defense needs are apparently considered 
in urban and regional planning, in stockpil-
ing, and in decentralization programs. 
53. The USSR probably has a greater civil de-
fense capability than any other major coun-
try, except perhaps the UK. Its present civil 
defense system appears well-planned and or-
ganized, although we cannot estimate its ef-
fectiveness in dealing with wartime emer-
gencies', especially atomic attack. The 
elaborate totalitarian control system, the 
highly regimented character of the popula-
tion, and, to some extent, the dispersal of 
population and industry constitute strong 
points in the Soviet civil defense system. 
However, we believe that a serious shortage of 
transport facilities and of materials would 
handicap efforts to meet a wartime civil de-
fense emergency. 
Soviet Coastal Defense System 
54. The Soviet Coastal Defense establishment, 
which includes radar nets, coast watchers, 
coast artillery, antiaircraft, and naval infan-
try, has an estimated strength of 275,000

APPENDIX C 
BLOC POLITICAL WARFARE STRENGTHS 
DEFINITION OF BLOC POLITICAL WARFARE 
1. Political warfare plays an extremely im-
portant role for Communists, who consider 
military warfare only an extension of political 
warfare in their persistent campaign to un-
dermine the strength of the non-Communist 
world. Bloc political warfare techniques in-
clude: diplomatic action, both through nor-
mal intergovernmental channels and in such 
international organizations as the UN; propa-
ganda and front activities; political and eco-
nomic pressures and inducements; the action 
of Communist parties and of Communist-
controlled trade unions outside the Bloc; in-
filtration of Communists or their sympa-
thizers into key governmental posts; espio-
nage and sabotage; the fomenting of civil un-
rest, civil war, and colonial revolt; and the 
exploitation of nationalist and revolutionary 
movements. ? 
FACTORS AFFECTING BLOC POLITICAL 
WARFARE STRENGTH 
2. The principal sources of strength upon 
which Bloc political warfare capabilities are 
based consist of the Bloc's military capabili-
ties; the size, power, and centralized leader-
ship of the Bloc; Communist doctrine; and 
the Communist international movement. 
Size, Power, and Centralized Leadership 
3. The USSR, which is the base of the Com-
munist world revolutionary movement, covers 
8,500,000 square miles and has a population 
of about 200,000,000 people. The Bloc now 
includes 10 states,' which control a territory 
of about 13,320,000 square miles (one-fourth 
1USSR, Communist China, Albania, Bulgaria, 
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland,? 
Rumania, and North Korea. For the purposes 
of this general discussion, Communist China is 
included among the states forming the Bloc. 
However, it should ,be noted, as paragraph 7 in-
dicates, that the Sino-Soviet relationship is sig-
nificantly different from the other Soviet-
Satellite relationships. 
of the world total) and a population of about 
750,000,000 (one-third of the world total). 
The size of the Bloc and the rapidity with 
which the Bloc and the Communist move-
ment have expanded, particularly since World 
War II, constitute important elements of 
Bloc political warfare strength. 
4. In its conduct Of political warfare, the 
Bloc benefits greatly from centralized leader-
ship and from effective discipline and con-
trol, which make possible flexibility in the 
selection and use of particular courses of 
action. The Bloc's unique ability to conceal 
the realities of life within the Bloc from for-
eign observation enables Soviet propaganda 
to ,present a deceptive picture to, the outside 
world. The freedoms and opportunities pro-
vided Bloc agents and supporters in the non-
Communist world also constitute important 
advantages for the Bloc in the conduct of 
political warfare. 
5. Bloc political warfare depends to a large 
degree upon the stability and power of the 
USSR, which is the nucleus of the complex of 
Bloa states, national Communist parties, and 
auxiliary organizations. Bloc political war-
fare strength would be seriously reduced if 
the authority of the Soviet regime were weak-
ened by a prolonged and indecisive struggle 
for power within the USSR. However, we do 
not believe that any power struggle is likely 
to lead to a breakdown of the authority of the 
Soviet regime within the period of this esti-
mate. 
6. The USSR determines the fundamentals of 
Bloc political warfare. The Satellites and the 
national Communist parties outside the Bloc 
are under the control of the USSR. The na-
tional Communist parties outside the Bloc 
accept Soviet authority even at the expense 
of lessening their power and influence in their 
own national affairs, alienating significant 
elements of their membership, and intensify-
ing the repressive measures directed against 
them by national governments.

TOP SECRET 24 
7. Communist China occupies a unique posi-
tion within the Bloc. It remains dependent 
upon the USSR for military and economic 
support. However, it appears to be more an 
ally than a Satellite, and it almost certainly 
participates in the formulation of Commu-
nist policy in Asia. The prestige and mili-
tary power of Communist China help to in-
crease Bloc political warfare strengths in 
Asia, while at the same time they strengthen 
Chinese Communist national power. As a 
consequence, Communist China exercises 
some influence, the exact degree of which we 
are unable to estimate, on the national Com-
munist parties and movements of Asian 
countries. 
Communist Doctrine 
8. Communist doctrine constitutes a power-
ful force for the international Communist 
movement. Much of this force, however, de-
rives from the fact that Communism is the 
official ideology of one of the world's most 
powerful nations, which uses it in the pursuit 
of its foreign political aims. Aside from this 
consideration, the considerable attraction of 
Communism stems from its Utopian message. 
Many are attracted by its promise to end 
social, and particularly economic, injustices, 
and may, in addition, find in it a secular reli-
gion which provides them with a certainty of 
purpose. For the party member Communism 
provides a system of values and a guide to 
action. Furthermore, the doctrinal tenets of 
Communism involve acceptance of a rigid dis-
cipline which provides the leadership with a 
unique measure of control. These tenets are 
an important source of Communist resolution 
and of the Communist will and capability to 
fight. 
9. The ideas and doctrines developed in the 
nineteenth century by Marx and Engels have 
had varying degrees of influence throughout 
most of the world. Marxist doctrine had exer-
cised great influence in the West before the 
Russian Revolution, and Lenin and Stalin 
both profited from the fact that the philoso-
phies of many 'non-Communists and even anti-
Communists had been influenced by the 
philosophy upon which they began the erec-
tion of the Soviet state. Since 1917, Marxist 
doctrine, although not necessarily as inter-
preted by the Kremlin, has spread even fur-
ther; for example, it exercises a strong influ-
ence in Japanese universities today, and it has 
helped to create groups of fellow-travelers in 
most non-Communist countries. 
Communist International Organization 
10. The international Communist movement 
is a vital element of Bloc political warfare 
strength, and its rise to international im-
portance has been one of the major political 
phenomena of the twentieth century. The 
Bloc now has a network of more than sixty 
national Communist parties with an esti-
mated 24 million members, as well as a variety 
of international mass organizations. Most 
party members live within the Bloc, but at 
least 3,250,000 are scattered throughout the 
non-Communist world. These figures do not 
include the membership of the front organiza-
tions, trade unions, etc., which the national 
Communist parties influence or control. 
While the power of the national Communist 
parties to influence national policy is rela-
tively small in the Western Hemisphere and 
in West European countries, except for Italy 
and perhaps France, these parties have dem-
onstrated the power to organize, maintain, 
and control armed rebellion on a significant 
scale in a number of the underdeveloped coun-
tries of the world, to create economic and 
political disruption in a number of other coun-
tries, and to maintain important espionage 
and propaganda efforts in nearly all countries. 
11. The Bloc controls and operates the largest 
and most complex system of mass communi-
cation in the world. For example, the USSR 
leads the world in volume of international 
radio broadcasting, and the combined output 
of the Satellites and Communist China ex-
ceeds that of any other state. The Bloc sys-
tem of mass communication, which includes 
radio, publications, posters, demonstrations, 
agitators, etc., enables the Bloc to disseminate 
a tremendous stream of propaganda and to 
attempt to mobilize public opinion among 
key groups throughout the world in support 
of Bloc policies. The themes which Bloc 
propaganda employs ? "peace," "national in-
dependence," "anti-Americanism," "anti-im-

perialism," etc. are designed to encourage 
neutralism, to exploit national rivalries, to 
bring nationalist movements under Commu-
nist leadership and control, and to cause di-
versions of strength from the centers of West-
ern power. 
12. The Bloc has frequently been able to take 
the initiative in the East-West struggle. This 
has been due in large part to the Bloc's or-
ganizational strength and its great experience 
in the techniques of political warfare, but it 
also derives from the fact that the Bloc has 
succeeded in identifying its revolutionary ap-
peals with the social and national aspirations 
of many dissident forces throughout the 
world. Thus, the Communists have obtained 
control over some of the major labor confed-
erations in France, Italy, Indonesia, Latin 
America, and many individual unions else-
where, and they have gained influence or con-
trol over a number of nationalist movements 
in colonial areas. 
13. There are some factors, however, which 
tend to place limitations of varying degree 
upon Bloc political warfare strength. These 
include the limitations of Communist philoso-
phy and Communist world outlook, especially 
in evaluating political developments in the 
non-Communist world; the Communist in-
sistence upon the maintenance of totalitarian 
controls, which has increased the awareness of 
Communist objectives and techniques in the 
non-Communist world; occasional conflicts 
between the policies of the Kremlin and the 
interests of national Communist parties out-
side the Bloc, which have reduced the strength 
of some of the national Communist parties; 
and increasing awareness in the non-Com-
munist world since 1945, especially in the 
West, of the actual conditions prevailing with-
in the Bloc and of the Kremlin's aggressive 
intentions. 
PROBABLE DEVELOPMENT OF BLOC 
POLITICAL WARFARE STRENGTH 
14. One of the bases of Bloc capabilities for 
political warfare has been a stable, centralized, 
and unified leadership in the Kremlin. It is 
probable that these capabilities were tern-
25 
porarily reduced by the transfer of power to 
new leadership and by the evidences of top-
level dissension, provided especially by the fall 
of Beria, which have accompanied this trans-
fer. We believe, however, that the temporary 
weakness and confusion which marked Bloc 
political warfare in recent months will not be 
serious or prolonged. Only a continuing 
struggle for power within the Soviet hierarchy, 
or a sierious impairment of the authority of the 
Soviet regime, would significantly weaken Bloc 
political warfare capabilities. Such develop-
ments are unlikely. Moreover, the death of 
Stalin has given the Kremlin an opportunity 
to gain credence for its claim that Soviet 
policy is motivated by a sincere desire to lessen 
international tensions and to coexist peace-
fully with the West. In this sense Bloc 
political warfare capabilities may have been 
enhanced by the death of Stalin. 
Western Europe 
15. The strength of Communist parties in 
Western Europe varies from country to coun-
try, from the illegal party of an estimated 150 
members in Ireland to the mass parties of 
France and Italy. Throughout Western Eu-
rope, the Communist parties since 1946 have 
suffered losses both in membership and pres-
tige. However, the hard core of the party has 
been preserved everywhere, and in most coun-
tries the party continues to influence large 
numbers of non-Communists. 
16. The popular strength of the Communists 
remains highest in France and Italy, where 
the Communists are a strong minority in the 
parliaments, control many municipal govern-
ments, and hold the leadership of the most 
important trade unions. We estimate that 
the Communist Party of France now has 450,-
000 members, compared with the peak of 850,-
000 in 1946. However, in each national elec-
tion in France since 1945, the Communist 
Party has obtained more than 5,000,000 votes, 
about one-quarter of the total vote cast. The 
Communist Party of Italy is estimated to have 
1,700,000 members, compared to only 5,000 in 
1943 and to the peak of 2,300,000 in January 
1948. In the 1948 elections in Italy, the Pop-
ular Front coalition, dominated by the Com-
munist Party, polled 8,000,000 votes, about 30

Declassified and Approved For Release -26'13707/1V. 81V-IkIS11)79R01012A002900020001-9 
percent of the total vote cast. In the June 
1953 elections, the Communist Party polled 
6,122,638 votes, about 22.5 percent of the total 
vote cast, and the left-wing Socialists polled 
3,440,222 votes, about 12.2 percent of the total 
vote cast. 
17. As a result of a decline in direct-action 
strength in recent years, marked by the fail-
ure of mass political strikes and demonstra-
tions, the French and Italian Communist 
Parties have concentrated on increasing their 
popular following through the tactics of the 
"United National Front" and on attempting 
to attract individuals and groups from all 
political parties and sections of society to sup-
port the Communist goal of neutralizing Eu-
rope's role in the East-West conflict. The 
Communists have tried to make common 
cause with individuals of all social groups on 
the basis of a broad program of "peace, na-
tional independence, and democratic liber-
ties." In directing their appeals against the 
Western coalition, and against the US in par-
ticular, the Communists have attempted to 
link international issues with pressing domes-
tic problems, such as wages, taxes, and hous-
ing. Thus, the Communists' basic appeal in 
France and Italy is to the sense of interna-
tional insecurity and to the deep dissatisfac-
tion over domestic conditions which have long 
existed, and which would exist in the absence 
of the Communists. 
18. We estimate that the French and Italian 
Communist Parties will retain their electoral 
and parliamentary strength throughout the 
period of this estimate, and that they will 
maintain their influence through numerous 
front organizations, their extensive party 
press, and Communist leadership of the 
largest trade union federations. In both 
France and Italy, the Communists, as the 
heirs of the strong tradition of the extreme 
left, will continue to lead the groups discon-
tented because of social and economic condi-
tions. 
19. In the other countries of Western Europe, 
the Communists have little mass appeal. 
Communists do hold important positions in 
some trade unions and in some strategic in-
dustries in most countries, but they are much 
26 
less numerous and influential than they are 
in France and Italy. 
Middle East and Africa 
20. The forces of nationalism, anti-Western-
ism, and social unrest, instead of the institu-
tional strength of Communist parties, provide 
the main vehicles for Bloc political warfare 
in the Middle East and Africa. The strength 
of the Communist parties in this area will 
probably remain low during the period of this 
estimate. Most Communist parties have been 
forced underground, and only that in Iran 
and those in North Africa linked to the French 
Communist Party have thus far had any 
marked influence. However, despite the 
slight organizational gains of the Commu-
nists, the continued growth of nationalist and 
anti-Western extremism and of social unrest 
will continue to provide the Communists with 
opportunities for increasing their influence 
among students, workers, and peasants. 
21. The Bloc agent in Iran, the Tudeh Party, 
had prior to Mossadeq's downfall an esti-
mated hard-core strength of 1,000, a card-
carrying membership estimated at from 
20,000 to 45,000, and probably an additional 
80,000 fellow-travelers. It has been the only 
sizable united and disciplined political party 
in Iran, demonstrating great cohesion and 
considerable organized strength. It has de-
veloped techniques for the controlled use of 
mass demonstrations, strikes, and riots for 
political purposes. 
South Asia 
22. Communism does not now pose a major 
immediate threat to India or Pakistan, al-
though the Indian Communist Party and al-
lied parties received 6,000,000 votes (of 106,-
000,000) in the 1952 elections. The Indian 
Communist Party still has only about 40;000 
members, but it has small vocal groups in 
several state legislatures and the national 
legislature. The Communist Party members 
in the national legislature will be able to do 
little more than to embarrass the government 
and to use their positions to spread Commu-
nist propaganda. In those states where 
Communist strength is., greatest, the party

CONFIDE.N IAL 
may be able to obtain representation in local 
coalition governments and even seriously to 
disrupt parliamentary processes. 
23. At the present time, the major task of 
the Indian Communist Party is to build up 
its organizational strength. In urban areas, 
the party uses trade unions and "peace" 
movements as vehicles of propaganda, and in 
rural areas, peasant organizations are used 
to stir up the agrarian population and to 
enlist support for subversive activities. To a 
considerable extent, party strength in respect 
to organization will depend on the policies of 
the Indian Government toward the party. 
Far East and Southeast Asia 
24. Although the Japanese Communist Party 
now has less than 100,000 members (about 
half of whom are underground) , it is well 
organized and well disciplined and has a sig-
nificant potential for espionage, sabotage, 
and propaganda, as well as for promoting at 
least limited and sporadic incidents of mass 
violence. However, the strength of the party 
will continue to be limited by the official re-
straints of the Japanese police and intelli-
gence services and by the party's open identi-
fication with and virtual subordination to the 
interests and policies of the USSR. The 
existence of such issues as trade with the 
Bloc, especially China, fear of Japanese in-
volvement in a general war in Asia, the pres-
ence of US forces in Japan, and a peace treaty 
with the USSR, should provide the Bloc with 
considerable opportunities for political pres-
sure on the domestic and international levels. 
25. Bloc political warfare strength varies 
throughout Southeast Asia. It is greatest in 
Indochina where the Viet Minh is a forceful 
instrument of control and terror. The Viet 
Minh retains considerable nationalist appeal 
and maintains heavy military pressure upon 
the French, with Chinese Communist assist-
ance. The Viet Minh has received diplomatic 
recognition by the Bloc states, it has the sup-
port of numerous non-Communists not only 
within the zones of its control, but also in the 
Franco-Vietnamese areas. The continuation 
of the Viet Minh's popular hold on substantial 
proportions of the populations in its own 
27 
zone, based partly on military prestige, partly 
on continued nationalist appeal, and partly 
on the mechanism of compulsion and terror, 
will depend upon the degree of military power 
and ideological appeal which the free world 
may be able to bring to bear against it. 
26. The prospects for Bloc political warfare in 
Burma, Thailand, and Malaya will depend 
largely upon developments in Indochina. In 
Burma and Malaya, the Communists are 
capable of conducting guerrilla operations in 
small scattered areas. In Thailand, the Com-
munist Party is small and relatively ineffec-
tual. However, Communist political war-
fare strengths in Thailand would probably 
grow considerably if the Viet Minh or the ' 
Chinese Communists ' should consolidate a 
position along the Thailand borders. 
27. The Communist movement in Indonesia 
has gained considerable political strength 
since the end of World War II. Communist 
strength derives from representation in par-
liament and support from some non-Com-
munist members of parliament; from Com-
munist control of SOBSI, the dominant In-
donesian labor union; and from successful 
adoption of united front tactics, which have 
frequently resulted in participation by front 
parties in the government.2 
28. In the Philippines, Communist strength 
has declined considerably since 1951, and, 
except for some influence in labor unions, 
tenant farmer groups, and women's and 
youths' leagues, is confined almost exclusively 
to the greatly weakened Huk movement. 
Latin America 
29. The Communist threat in Latin America 
is greater than the present party membership 
of about 200,000 in the area would suggest, 
because of the ease with which a relatively 
few Communists operating behind labor, in-
tellectual, and other fronts can exploit the 
social unrest and Yankeephobia already exist-
ing in the non-Communist population. Guate-
mala is a prime example of how a small Corn-

been examined in SE-51, "The Significance of 
the New Indonesian Government" (18 Septem-
ber 1953) .

munist minority? can, through its militant 
advocacy of social reforms and nationalistic 
policies and through its occupancy of key posi-
tions in labor and governmental agencies, 
convert a government into an effective, 
though indirectly controlled, instrument of 
the Communists. 
30. The organizational strength of Commu-
nist parties in Latin America has declined in 
recent years, and in many countries the 
parties have been officially suppressed. Never-
theless, Communist influence is great in 
Guatemala, considerable in British Guiana 
and the French West Indies, and moderate in 
Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, and Cuba. 
This influence will probably be maintained 
during the period of this estimate and may 
even increase in the event of a decline in eco-
nomic activity. The Communists dominate 
completely one of the three Latin American 
international labor federations, the Confed-
eration of Latin American Workers (CTAL) , 
and, through their influence in labor, they 
have gained a considerable potential for in-
stigating and prolonging strikes in strategic 
industries, such as in the Bolivian tin and 
28 
Chilean copper mines. In Brazil, the Com-
munists have been influential in preventing 
the development of Brazil's petroleum re-
sources by US capital. In most Latin Amer-
ican countries, the Communists have worked 
closely with the ultranationalists, and they 
have attempted to form "national liberation" 
fronts based on labor unity and the exploita-
tion of local nationalist issues, such as the 
bilateral military pacts between the individual 
republics and the US. 
31. The Communists have also been success-
ful in penetrating Latin American educa-
tional systems, intellectual circles, and those 
patriotic organizations formed to give expres-
sion to the spirit of ultranationalism. By 
employing front organizations and sponsoring 
"peace" congresses, the Communists have ex-
ploited the fear of war and have stressed that 
Latin America has nothing to gain and much 
to lose from embroilment in a world conflict. 
These local Communist propaganda activities 
have received support from Soviet radio broad-
casts to Latin America, which have increased 
in volume since the outbreak of the Korean 
war.

On side in 1949 ? Present status unknown. 
2 Based on continued construction at estimated present rate on building facilities presently utilized. 
These figures include some overage types useful primarily as amphibious support ships, i.e., the battleships/monitor, 2 cruisers, 8 destroyers, and 16 coastal de-
stroyers. By mid-1955 the estimated number of overage cruisers will increase to 4. 
These will remain at about present strength. 
5 Based on estimated construction programs. Obsolete boats are deleted from USSR totals. All Satellite submarines are obsolete, and thus effectiveness is nil.

NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE FOR ESTIMATES 
OF BLOC ARMED STRENGTH 
a. G-2 comment of the nature of the evidence available for estimates of Bloc ground force 
strength: 
The reliability of Order of Battle intelligence on Communist countries varies directly 
with distances from friendly areas; accessibility or degree of contact being the major 
factor. For example, for CCF and North Korean units recently in contact, Order of 
Battle information is excellent and considered reliable. To 'a slightly lesser degree, 
Order of Battle information on Soviet units in Eastern Europe can be considered 
"reliable." 
This degree of reliability decreases, however, as distance from contact increases. As a 
result, elements of Order of Battle intelligence in the interior of the Soviet Bloc, such as 
subordination of units, names of unit commanders, or even precise knowledge as to 
exact location of major units are often lacking in reliability. This condition applies 
equally to both the interior of USSR and to Communist China. 
b. AFOIN comment on the nature of the evidence available for estimates of Bloc air force 
strength: 
Estimates of Soviet air strength are derived from intelligence which is considered of 
acceptable reliability, but collection coverage is incomplete. Estimates of over-all size 
and composition of Soviet Air Forces are derived from identification of individual units 
and estimated Table of Organization and Equipment strengths authorized for the various 
types of air regiments. Current estimates of jet fighter and medium bomber strength 
are considered reasonably valid. While aircraft count data are limited, they support 
an estimate that the current average levels of actual strength for the various types of 
aircraft amount to the following percentages of authorized TO and E strength: for jet 
fighters, 80-85 percent; for piston medium bombers, 75-80 percent; for jet light bombers 
and jet reconnaissance, 60-65 percent; and for all other types of aircraft, 90-100 percent. 
c. ONI comment on the nature of the evidence available for estimates of Bloc naval strength: 
Evidence confirming the existence of the major surface combatant vessels is firm and 
accurate. Identification of individual ships as to name and/or pennant numbers has 
been supported by evidence from a number of sources. Reliable evidence confirms the 
existence of 80 percent of the submarines and supports the existence of 15 percent; there 
is doubt about 5 percent. Of the 95 percent (333 submarines) whose existence is con-
firmed or supported, 308 have been identified. Future strength estimates are based on 
current strength, observed building rates, identified new construction activity, and 
obsolescence factors.
