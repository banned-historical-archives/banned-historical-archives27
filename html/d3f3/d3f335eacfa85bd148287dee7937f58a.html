 defeated, 114 to 93.  Thus, unless the Sen-
 ate does a clean-up job, which is unlikely,
 the sugar lobbyists will be swarming around
 the House for at least another 5 years, creat-
 ing the impression that they control V.S.
 policy in this delicate area.
 No one says that all lobbying is bad or
 that all lobbyists should be banned.  Quite
 the "contrary.  Many lobbyists representing
 American interests render services that are
 useful and possibly even necessary to the
 successful functioning of  Congress.   This
 general subject is treated at some length in
 an article by Arthur Edson.
 But what useful service can be credited to
 the ubiquitous sugar lobbyists?    Through-
 out the House debate FINDLEY and his back-
 ers tried in vain to find out.  This is hardly
 surprising.  Most of these lobbyists know lit-
 tle or nothing about the complex business of
 fixing sugar quotas. Furthermore, all the in-
 formation needed by the House was readily
 available from sources within the adminis-
 tration.  The lobbyists were nothing more
 than a collection of handsomely paid, but
 influential, fifth wheels.
 It may seem surprising that most of the
 House Members are so indifferent, so in-
 sensitive, in this matter.  If HALL or PELLY
 or both are right, the House has the mak-
 ings of a potential Bobby Baker case on its
 hands,  But the Members, or a majority of
 .them,  give  every  indication  that  they
 couldn't care less.
 Actually, this is not as surprising as it
 seems,  For the sugar bill over the years has
 been in the private domain of Chairman
 COOLEY of the House Agriculture Commit-
 tee. It is his baby, and the hands-off notice
 is generally respected.  Furthermore, the
 rank-and-file of the House Members are not
 greatly  interested.   No doubt  Chairman
 Coox,EY and a few members of his committee
 are fully conversant with the provisions of
 the measure.     But the Members, by and
 large, are not, and the Senate at this late
 hour In, the session will have little oppor-
 tunity or incliniation for a serious study of
 ,the bill.
 Some of the results. of this' leave-it-to-
 Cooley attitude are remarkable, to say the
 least.
 Let's take the case  of Argentina and
 Venezuela.  Argentina's agricultural coun-
 selor,  Enreque                            Gaston Valente,  said  his
 country "thinks it Is entitled to a quota
 :without the Government having to pay any-
 one."  Venezuela thought otherwise.  It re-
 tained Charles Patrick Clark, attorney and
 one of this town's more successful lobbyists,_
 at $50,00b a year for 21/2 years. The result:
 Venezuela's quota under the Johnson ad-
 ministration bill, 2,676 tons, was raised by
 the Cooley committee to 30,809 tons.  Ar-
 gentina was scheduled for a quota of some
 63,000 tons.  The committee cut it back to
 21,500`tons. No need for the Argentine Gov-
 ernment to pay anyone?
 Some other oddities: Thailand, which had
 never had a sugar quota, was thoughtful
 enough to hire as a lobbyist one of COOLEY'S
 former colleagues on the House committee.
 The Thais were awarded about 20,000 tons.
 Seven other  newcomers to this  country's
 'sugar bowl were granted quotas. And (can
 you believe it?)  each had the foresight to
 hire a lobbyist.
 As already indicated, the useful nature of
 the services rendered by these lobbyists are
 as mysterious as the criteria used by the
 committee to determine which country gets
 how much.  But there is nothing mysterious
 about some of the other activities of the
 lobbyists. Oscar Chapman, former Secre-
 tary of the Interior, was chairman last year
 of a Johnson-for-President fundraising en-
 terprise.  Clark has been a generous con-
 tributor  to                           Democratic  campaign  funds.
 Donald Dawson, a former Truman aid, was
 also active in the Johnson campaign. And
 so on. These men may not know much
 about the sugar business, but they know
 their way around town.
 Chairman Coox,EY is a bit sensitive about
 the activity and the take of the lobbyists.
 At a hearing last August, FINDLEY wanted to
 ask some questions about compensation of
 Lobbyist Ganson Purcell.  FINDLEY was cut
 off by the chairman.  COOLEr said it is
 "none of your business and none of my bus-
 iness what his terms of employment as a
 lawyer are.  He fixes his own fee and his
 own arrangements."
 The chairman,  we  think, is egregiously
 mistaken.  Knowledge  respecting  the  fees
 of lobbyists ought to be the business of
 every Member of Congress.   And, most em-
 phatically, it ought to be the business of
 the American people who, in the long run,
 pick up the tab.
 Tribute to Teens
 HON. JAMES G. O'HARA
 OF MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, October 19, 1965
 Mr.                                        O'HARA  of  Michigan.   Mr.
 Speaker, too often the youth of today
 are characterized as irresponsible, lazy,
 or disdainful of the needs of others.
 Unfortunately, the misdeeds of a few
 sometimes overshadow the activities of
 the majority of our Nation's young
 people.
 An example of the attitude of the ma-
 jority of America's youth occurred re-
 cently in Macomb County, Mich., located
 in the congressional district which I am
 privileged to represent.
 An article, which appeared in the Oc-
 tober 13 edition of the Macomb Daily
 under the headline, "Tribute to Teens,"
 describes the activities of a group of
 during the summer months to work in
 local hospitals and other facilities.
 Mr. Speaker, under unanimous con-
 sent I include the Macomb Daily article,
 which was written by Assistant City Edi-
 tor Bud Sloan, in the Appendix of the
 RECORD.
 The article follows:
 TRIBUTE  TO  TEENS-MACOMB  YOUNGSTERS
 COMFORT THE SICK AND INFIRM
 (By Bud Sloan)
 They seem like average teenagers.
 And they are, except-
 They have an unusual capacity for com-
 passion.
 "They" are the 300 volunteers who work
 under the direction of the Macomb County
 Red Cross High School Council and Tuesday
 night they were publicly honored for their
 humanitarian work.
 For. the joy and pleasure they bring to
 crippled children, retarded children, and
 those whiling away idle hours in hospitals,
 the volunteers were given a plaque in recog-
 nition of the many hours they have spent
 bringing cheer and hope to the unfortunate.
 In presenting the 1964-65 youth group
 achievement award-given annually to an
 outstanding youth organization by Parent's
 magazine-Roseville  Mayor  Arthur .8.  C.
 Waterman offered the gratitude of the sick
 and the infirm.
 "I am heartened to "find so many of our
 young people in the county willing to give
 A5881
 of their time in constructive service to the
 community," Waterman said.
 He recalled the amazing record of the vol-
 unteers in the past year.
 "During the summer months, the volun-
 teers gave over 3,000 hours of service in six
 nursing homes, St. Joseph Hospital in Mount
 Clemens, Mount Clemens General Hospital,
 Macomb County Health Clinic, Red Cross
 Bloodmobiles, and general work at the Red
 Cross chapter headquarters," Waterman said,
 Apart from the hospital work, volunteers
 gave parties for crippled children, blind chil-
 dren, and retarded children.
 Mark Golemboiwski, 15, of 38701 West-
 chester, Sterling township, who was installed
 as president of the council Tuesday night,
 summed it up :
 "Most of the youngsters we try to cheer
 up don't get around very much.
 "Hardly  anyone comes in contact  with
 them except their immediate family.
 "If we can bring a little cheer into their
 lives we feel we are amply rewarded."
 Deborah Niemer, 16, of 29943 Hughes, St.
 Clair Shores, Who took office as correspond-
 ing secretary of the council, spoke of the
 many visits by volunteers to hospitals and
 nursing homes.
 "It is so heartwarming to see the eyes of a
 patient light up when we stop in for a visit,"
 said Miss Niemer.
 "Often they will ask us to read for them
 or write a letter.
 "Many are lonely and the friendship we
 offer seems to be priceless to them.,'
 Taking office with Golemboiwski and Miss
 Niemer at the meeting were: James Scott,
 Mount Clemens High School, vice president;
 Claudia Smith, Lakeview High School, St.
 Clair  Shores,  recording  secretary;  Janet
 Zieminski, Warren Woods High School, his-
 torian, and Gary Glasen, Eppler Junior High
 School, Utica, sergeant at arms.
 And as the excitement of the presentation
 and the installation of officers died away in
 the Red Cross Chapter at 17955 Eleven Mile
 Road, Roseville, Mrs. Cecil Fansler, director
 of Red Cross youth in the county, looked
 ,fondly at the youngsters.
 "Truly," she said, "they are their brother's
 keepersi'

 Tree Capital of the South, Taylor County,
 . Fla.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. DON FUQUA
 OF s9 oanA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, October 14, 1965
 Mr. FUQUA. Mr. Speaker, I take great
 pleasure in announcing to the Congress
 of the United States, a, proclamation by
 the Honorable Haydon Burns, Governor
 of Florida, proclaiming Taylor County,
 Fla., as the "Tree Capital of the South."
 Mr. Speaker, we are all aware of the
 tremendous importance of timber and its
 related industries to the economy of this
 Nation, in fact it is one of the five major
 industries of the United States.
 It is hard to visualize, as we see an in-
 dividual tree, that this one item is a
 basic cornerstone of the economy of this
 Nation.  The landowner is the first in a
 long line of Americans who derive all or
 part of their incomes from timber.
 The multitude of wood products and
 lumber runs into the thousands.
 It is therefore with justifiable pride
 that I join with Governor Burns in as-
 serting our claim that Taylor County,
 an area which I am privileged to repre-
 sent in the Congress, Is the "Tree Capital
 of the South."
 This afternoon on the steps of the capi-
 tol of Florida, Governor Burns took a
 branding iron to affix his signature to
 a proclamation which had been inscribed
 on a, huge cross section of a cypress tree.
 It reads:
 Whereas official forest statistics prove Tay-
 lor County, Fla., throughout history has been
 a world leader in tree production, and now
 leads the South in wood harvested and leads
 the South in reforestation, I hereby proclaim
 Taylor County, Fla., the Tree Capital of the
 South.
 This is no idle boast.
 As far back as. the  1700's, Taylor
 County began harvesting its vast acreages
 of virgin timber. Through the years this
 harvesting accelerated, as Taylor County
 is situated in the heartland of America's
 virgin timber.
 Harvesting hit a peak in the early
 part of this century with the construc-
 tion of the largest cypress sawmill in the
 world, the Burton Swartz Co.,. still in
 operation as the Lee-Tidewater Cypress
 Co., and the huge Brooks-Scanlon saw-
 mill, which was to become the largest
 sawmill ever to,operate east of the Mis-
 sissippi.
 The sawmill town of Carbur sprang
 up, and was the largest sawmill town In
 the world.
 When these early timber companies
 cut out the virgin forests, many believed
 Taylor County would dwindle away, but
 forward thinking men began reforesta-
 tion even as the last vestiges of the vir-
 gin stands were cut away. Their efforts
 have borne fruit.
 Our area is noted for its rapid rate of
 growth of timber and just over a decade
 ago, Buckeye Cellulose Corp. established
 its huge plant near Perry, and today
 after five major expansions, is one of the
 three largest dissolving pulp producers
 in America.
 Lee-Tidewater Cypress Co. is today
 expanding into a completely new plant,
 and employs hundreds of people.
 Cooperation between the pulp and
 timber industry has brought a resur-
 gence of the lumber industry in the coun-
 ty, and today five major mills are operat-
 ing there.
 Taylor County has nearly a billion
 board feet of standing timber and wood
 harvesting in the county last year ex-
 ceeded 340,000 cords of wood.  Looking
 to the future, Taylor County has been
 the leading tree planting county in our
 State, having planted over 87 million
 seedlings since 1928, with thousands of
 acres reforested with direct seeding.
 This past year alone, Taylor County
 planted 61/3 million seedlings.
 Taylor County has more tree farm
 acreage than any other county in the
 State, in fact one of every 12 tree farm
 acres In Florida is located in Taylor
 County.
 This is the basis for our claim.
 Each year, Perry is the site for a great
 pine tree festival which pays tribute to
 the  second largest industry in our
 State-timber-producing a billion dol-
 lars in income annually.
 I take pride in being able to present
 just a portion of the story of Taylor
 County to the Congress.  Men looking
 to the future, where we will need an ever
 increasing amount of wood for a grow-
 ing Nation, are scientifically conserving
 this priceless natural resource in the
 Taylor County area.
 I pay tribute to them and salute the
 people of Perry and Taylor County, and
 join with them in making claim to the
 title that Taylor County is truly the
 "Tree Capital of the South."
 Sharing Federal Taxes
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. F. BRADFORD MORSE
 OF MASSACHUSETTS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, October 14, 1965
 Mr.                 MORSE.   Mr.  Speaker,  last
 Thursday, I Introduced legislation call-
 ing for the distribution of certain Fed-
 eral tax-revenues to tlrye States for dis-
 tribution to communities for health,
 education, and welfare projects.
 It seems to me that this approach is
 crucial if we are to preserve the integrity
 of local government, which is already
 struggling with a narrow tax base and
 increasing needs.  An additional source
 of funds would ease high property taxes
 which in the long run tend to weaken the
 competitive position of States and com-
 munities in the national economy.
 One of the voices raised in support of
 the tax sharing idea has been that of
 the Lowell, Mass., Sun. In an. editorial
 which appeared on Thursday, October
 14, the Sun pointed out its early support
 for such a proposal and its continued
 determination to press for a system that
 would enable our local communities and
 State governments to respond to the de-
 mands of a growing population.
 Under unanimous consent I include
 the editorial in the RECORD:
 SHARING FEDERAL TAXES
 More than a year ago, this newspaper
 was one of the first voices in the country
 to propose the idea of distributing part of
 the Federal Government's income tax rev-
 enues to the States and the cities.
 Our reasoning was simple.  Federal rev-
 enues are rising steadily as the economy
 expands, while State and municipal treasur-
 ies are everywhere approaching bankruptcy.
 Many of the major needs of 20th-century
 America are local: better schools, better po-
 lice protection, better sewerage, welfare pro-
 grams and so on. Although there is a patch-
 work of Federal programs available to help
 State and local communities meet these
 needs, the red tape can get so complex that
 most municipalities are left in the cold.
 Besides, we would rather see local gov-
 ernments handle these problems by them-
 selves than have to be fed and led by Wash-
 ington.  But because real estate taxes and
 sale taxes have reached their saturation point
 almost everywhere in the country, there is
 nowhere the States and cities can go to get
 more money except to the Federal Govern-
 ment.
 Sharing in Federal income tax revenues
 would also give cities a fairer break in rela-
 tion to towns.  Cities such as Lowell have
 high tax rates because there are so many
 urban services to provide. Towns have lower
 tax rates, because there is less need for police
 protection, incinerators, sewage treatment
 plants, and so on,.  The result is that indus-
 try locates in the towns, lowering their tax
 rates even more; while at the same time in.
 dustry leaves the cities, raising the real estate
 levies on the city homeowner.
 The notion of Federal tax distribution was
 officially proposed to President Johnson late
 last year by Dr. Walter Heller, former White
 House economic adviser.  But the plan lan-
 guished because organized labor was opposed
 to it and because President Johnson was
 irked at Heller for leaking the idea to the
 press.
 After many months of hibernation, the
 plan was picked up again not by the Demo-

 Foreign aid
 We urge the Congress to authorize and ap-
 propriate the funds requested by President
 Johnson for foreign aid, with the stipulation
 that the Congress reserves the authority to
 withhold any funds appropriated to a nation
 where there is strong evidence that the al-
 located funds will not be effectively used for
 the social and economic betterment of the
 people by the government of that nation.
 We believe that American programs of eco-
 nomic, technical, and military assistance are
 essential for the growth and development of
 the indigent nations of the world and for
 the securing of these nations against the
 menace of Communist domination.  It is in
 areas where poverty, illiteracy, and famine
 are permitted to fester, that tyrannical gov-
 ernments flourish.
 Since overpopulation is the cause of many
 of the problems of the underdeveloped na-
 tions, we especially urge the United States to
 step up its program of educational and ma-
 terial aid in the field of birth control.
 The United States is confronted with the
 challenge of demonstrating that people all
 over the world can be both free and well fed.
 Ignorance,  destitution,  famine,  and  the
 recalcitrance of the ruling and landed classes
 constitute the threats to the security of free-
 dom and peace around the globe.
 We do not believe that we can evaluate the
 effectiveness of foreign aid in terms of how
 many Communists it helps to kill, nor do we
 bold that those who are recipients of for-
 eign aid must always agree with us.  The
 spirit of individualism which is the hall-
 mark of democracy cries out against our de-
 manding that the rest of the world agree
 with us all the time, and a sense of reality
 makes it clear that to so demand would be
 folly.  We suggest that the judgment of his-
 tory and our own self-interest dictate that
 we measure the efficiency of foreign aid by
 how many men, women, and children are
 helped so they can live decent and useful
 lives.
 We believe that the leaders of nations re-
 ceiving American foreign aid have a moral
 responsibility to help their people; our aid
 must be utilized toward that end, never to-
 ward the accumulation of fortunes in Swiss
 bank accounts.
 Today, the people of Latin America, Asia,
 and Africa are crippled by their agrarian
 traditions and high levels of illiteracy.  We
 must be patient, and we should not expect
 miracles overnight,, but we have to help
 these people educate themselves and adjust
 to our technological age.
 We must remember that the burden which
 our prosperous Nation is asked to bear be-
 cause of foreign aid is minute compared with
 the hardships of illiteracy, poverty, and dis-
 ease which more than one-half of the World's
 people must today sustain.  It is not right
 for the rich to stand idly by when the means
 to help the poor are available.
 Peace Corps
 We believe that the United States should
 keep open all channels of communication
 with the Soviet Union, In the hope that the
 Soviets will recognize  that it is in their
 interest as well as ours to arrive at the
 peaceful resolution of disputes.
 We urge the U.S. Senate to ratify the con-
 sular  treaty recently negotiated between
 Russia and the United States.  The treaty
 is an extension of the expressed hopes of
 the Russian people and the American peo-
 ple to live peacefully with one another.  In
 addition it will afford added protection to
 American citizens  traveling in the Soviet
 Union.
 We urge the U.S. Congress to strongly con-
 demn Russian discrimination against Soviet
 Jews.
 Foreign - trade
 We urge the nations of the world to work
 for the reduction of tariffs.  We believe that
 the only effective trade policy this country
 can have Is one that will be practiced by
 our  allies  as    well. Therefore,  the  Presi-
 dent should do all in his power to bring
 abount a common trade policy toward the
 Communist  block  among  nations  of         the
 Western World.
 We support the sale of wheat and other
 food products to the Soviet Union and the
 Eastern European nations and the extension
 of long-term credit by the Export-Import
 Bank to the Eastern European nations and
 the Soviet Union.
 It is time for ;,ha United States to reexam-
 ine its attitude with regard to trade with
 Russia and her allies.  Increased trade means
 that our economy will improve.   Also, by
 helping the Soviet  citizens to live better
 We believe that the United States should
 do all within its power to arrive at a lasting

 also urge France to allow England to attain
 full partnership in the Common Market. We
 are hopeful that in the future the Common
 Market will be expanded so that all mem-
 bers of the Atlantic community may benefit
 from economic cooperation.
 Eastern Europe
 In recent years it has become clear that
 within the nations of Eastern Europe there
 are stirrings of a desire for freedom and In-
 dependence.                                                                                   We urge the Congress to afford
 the executive branch of the Government full
 latitude in its relations with Eastern Europe
 in order to permit us to stimulate these
 countries to pursue freer foreign policies.
 In particular, we urge the Congress to per-
 mit the U S. Government to have freedom
 in its political and economic relations with
 such  nations  as  Poland,  Yugoslavia,  and
 Rumania.
 Berlin wall
 We hope that the day will soon come when
 the peoples of Berlin will be reunited.  The
 Berlin wall cannot prevent the people of all
 Germany from desiring freedom; it can im-
 prison their bodies but not their minds.
 We recognize that the Berlin wall is a- viola-
 tion of international law and international
 morality. We hope soon to see the day when
 the wall no longer will exist.
 We are encouraged by the East-West agree-
 ments  allowing  the  Berlin  wall  to  open
 during such times as Easter and Christmas,
 but we look forward to the time when the
 wall  will  no longer divide families and
 friends.

 ,JOE CORPS GIVES GIRLS A BREAK FOR THE
 FUTURE
 (By Tom Nolan)
 CLEVELAND -While         its  more  publicized
 counterparts in Los Angeles and St. Peters-
 burg are reeling under charges ranging from
 rowdyism to payroll padding, the Women's
 Job Corp Center in Cleveland is quietly giv-
 ing 325 girls a good chance for a happy life.
 "Of course we've had disciplinary prob-
 lems," says Mrs. Mary Chambers, director of
 the center.  "You're bound to have them any
 place you get 300 teen-aged girls together,
 and these teenagers happen to come from the
 worst possible conditions."
 Although there has been some drinking
 and othermisconduct among the girls, disci-
 pline has not been a big problem.  Four
 girls have been dismissed in the 5 months
 the end of 1 year.
 The early success of the Cleveland center
 can be traced primarily to two assets:  a
 sound professional  organization  and good
 community relations.
 The center is under a $4 million contract
 to Alpha Kappa Alpha, a national sorority
 with 57 years of experience in social serv-
 ice.  Mrs. Chambers, a former biology pro-
 fessor at Alabama A&M, is a member of the
 sorority, as are most of the center's admin-
 istrative staff.
 LOCAL FIRMS
 Cleveland businesses and civic organiza-
 tions have helped out.  Local firms, includ-
 ing a beautician, printer and laundry, have
 offered their establishments for on-the-job
 training.
 Through the Council of Catholic Women,
 some 25 girls attend church each Sunday
 with Cleveland families and are guests for
 dinner afterwards.  Local libraries and mu-
 scums offer special orientation tours.
 But it will take more than cultural en-
 lightenment to train most of the girls and
 the center's 96 staff members have no illu-
 sions that their jobs will be easy or success-
 ful. in the end.
 For nearly every girl has to  develop  a
 cerise of direction.  Counselors and teachers
 have found that they must become the moth-
 er, father, friend and confidante that most
 girls never had.
 "It will take a good bit of daily counseling
 to help them," says Mrs. Chambers.  "Most
 of them tend to downgrade their capabili-
 ties because they think they are stupid.
 We know we can't reach them all.      But
 if we can just reach half of them-or even
 only 25 percent of them--we'll have done
 our job."

 to observe restrictions placed on them after
 unexplained absences.
 MARIHUANA
 The fourth girl was found to be receiving
 marihuana in the mail, was turned over to
 the police and then sent home.  Local papers
 reported the  incident,  but there  was  no
 scandal.
 All the girls are between 16 and 21.   Some
 come from broken homes, some from north-
 ern slums and others from southern. rural
 poverty pockets.   Most of them are high
 school dropouts, although several have no
 more than a sixth-grade education.     None
 has skill enough to hold a steady job.
 To most, growing up means getting mar-
 ried and going on relief, or having a child
 or two and going on relief. "If we didn't get
 them out of where they were, they'd be on
 welfare all their lives," says Mrs. Chambers.
 QUIET DISTRICT
 The center, formerly a Salvation Army
 home for young working women, is located
 in a quiet residential district.  It looks like
 an apartment house and it's run like a col-
 lege dorm.
 `2 was afraid to come," says one recent ar-
 :dvaI.  "I thought it would be more closed
 in-like a jail."  Some of the girls had never
 I ad a bed of their own,  Others had never
 slept on sheets.
 The girls enroll in the center voluntarily
 and can  withdraw  whenever  they  want.
 Many do-from homesickness.   Of the 380
 who have come to the center so far, 53 have
 gone home.
 Job Corps officials insist the girls must
 be sent away from their homes to accomplish
 the desired change in their lives.
 FREEDOM
 Those who remain are given 'considerable
 freedom with their own time.  After classes
 they may go out until dark as long as they
 sign out and give their destination.  On
 weekends they can date and boys may visit
 t' em Wednesday evenings and weekends.
 The girls are trained for secretarial busi-
 ness and clerical work, retail sales, food
 preparation and service, health and'medical
 service, serving and dress designing, graphic
 art skills, cleaning and laundry trades, hair
 dressing, and child care.

 Your committee is advised that no com-

 hasstated with respect to this bill:
 "The instrument purchased by Oklahoma
 State University is a noncommercial device,
 which was designed by Dr. R. Ryhage, of
 Sweden, and is being produced in that coun-
 try according to Dr. Ryhage's specifications.
 This is a highly specialized instrument, de-
 signed for biochemical research, which com-
 bines the function of a _mass spectrometer
 and a gas chromatograph in a single inte-
 grated  apparatus.  No  counterpart  of  the
 Ryhage design is available from domestic
 sources."
 In the circumstances, the Committee on
 Finance, like the Committee on Ways and
 Means of the House, is of the-opinion that
 this legislation is meritorious and consistent
 with prior legislation of this nature and rec-
 ommends its enactment.

 SHADOMASTER MEASURING PRO-
 JECTOR  FOR  UNIVERSITY  OF
 SOUTH DAKOTA
 The bill (H.R. 9351) to provide for the
 free entry of one shadomaster measuring
 projector for the use of the University of
 South Dakota was considered, ordered
 to a third reading, read the third time,
 and passed.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent to have printed
 in the RECORD an excerpt from the report
 (No. 907Y, explaining the purposes of the
 bill.
 There being no objection, the excerpt
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 PURPOSE
 The purpose of H.R. 9351 is to allow the
 University of South Dakota to import freq
 of duty a scientific instrument for its
 use.
 GENERAL  STATEMENT
 H.R. 9351 as reported would direct the Sec-
 retary of the Treasury to admit free of duty
 one Shadomaster measuiing projector (and
 its accompanying parts and equipment) for
 the use of the University of South Dakota,
 and provides for the reliquidation of the
 customs entry and appropriate refund of duty
 in the event that the liquidation of the entry
 has become final and duty paid.
 The machine for which free entry is pro-
 vided for by the bill is to be used by the De-
 partment of Geology of the University of
 South Dakota to project and to measure thin
 sections of rocks and minerals.
 Your committee is advised that no com-
 parable machine made in the United States
 is available.  The Department of Commerce
 has stated with respect to this bill:
 "The term `Shadomaster' is a trademark
 for an optical measuring projector made by
 Watson, Manasty & Co., Ltd., Middlesex,
 England.  This type of projector is used in
 meteorological work where precise, consist-
 ent, and fine measurements are required.  A
 comparison  of  the  specifications  of  the
 Shadomaster with the specifications of sim-

 IETNAM:  LEAKS  FROM  ANONY-
 MOUS OFFICIAL SOURCES
 Mr.   MANSFIELD. Mr.  President,
 stories attributed to unnamed "U.S. offi-
 cials" have been appearing in the press,
 to the effect that the war in Vietnam
 does not necessarily have to end in a
 negotiated. settlement. The unnamed
 officials Rant to be sure, apparently,
 that the public understands that there is
 an alternative to negotiations.  What
 these officials suggest, as the alternative,
 amounts to a total military solution, with
 the Vietcong being driven into a state
 of nonexistence.
 This thesis is valid as a basis for col-
 lege discussion.  It is valid as a subject
 for consideration  in  the  classified
 recesses of the Executive branch of the
 Government.  It is not valid, however,
 as a "leak" from anonymous official
 sources, leaving the strong impression
 that the policy of seeking negotiations is
 all but abandoned and we are about to
 adopt a new one.  Indeed, one newspaper
 carried a banner headline on the basis of
 this leak: "U.S. Now Sees Vietnam Vic-
 tory by Force of Arms." The impression
 left by the story is clear: It is that the
 doctrine of "unconditional negotiations"
 is about to be replaced by the doctrine
 of  unconditional  triumph  as  official
 policy. Whether that is accurate or not,
 is beside the point.   Whether it is a
 practical possibility is beside the point.
 The point is that official United States
 policy on Vietnam, as enunciated time
 and again by the President, is and re-
 mains one of seeking an honorable nego-
 tiated end to the conflict as quickly as
 possible. The President's policy-and it
 is the only official policy of this Govern-
 ment-is not to prove the theoretical
 possibility that a war of attrition without

 Approved ~~  a   g1    (O        F3QI~   ,R46R0003001J9PJW 19, 1965
 .negotiation can end in a triumph in 1,
 5, 10, or 15 years.
 The point is, too, that It is not college
 students or professors without responsi-
 bility for official policy who are advanc-
 ing this concept; it is not the press or po-
 litical leaders out of office and without
 official responsibilities; it Is not the Rep-
 resentatives or Senators, who have inde-
 pendent constitutional responsibilities,
 who are discussing this alternative pol-
 icy.  Rather, it is anonymous "U.S. offi-
 cials" who can have no responsibilities
 except official responsibilities In these
 matters; it is U.S. officials who are not
 privileged to speak on policy outside of
 the walls of the Executive branch except
 as they express the official policy of the
 United States as enunciated by the Presi-
 dent and under his direction, and with
 his approval.  For them to speak other-
 wise, even anonymously, is to Imply
 strongly that the President of the United
 States so thinks.
 Now, it is true that these official
 sources were at pains to make it clear
 that they support the President's policy
 of seeking an end to the Vietnamese con-
 flict by negotiations, even as they ad-
 vance an alternative approach of a solu-
 tion by attrition.  Well, if they are sup-
 porting the President's policy, why do
 they insist upon remaining unnamed?
 Why, then, do they hesitate to attach
 their names to that which they are dis-
 cussing with the press?
 Indeed, who are these official but un-
 narned sources? As one Senator, I would
 like to know in order to estimate the
 significance of the story, in order to know
 what to tell my constituents when they
 inquire as to the Nation's policies re-
 specting Vietnam. Are these officials in
 the White House?  Are they in the De-
 fense Department?             The State Depart-
 ment? The CIA? Or are they scattered
 throughout the executive branch? Is it
 the head of a department who advances
 this new concept of Vietnamese policy?
 Or is it a chairwarmer at a southeast
 Asia desk somewhere or a guard at the
 front door of the Pentagon or the State
 Department?
 Whoever they may be, one thing is cer-
 tain about these unnamed official sources.
 They are most irresponsible sources, In
 a situation in which the utmost of re-
 sponsibility is vital, and I use the word
 vital, rarely and most advisedly.  Here,
 we have almost 150,000 men in Vietnam;
 the number is going up steadily and the
 end is not yet in sight.  The President
 has made it clear, not once but a dozen
 times, that he seeks an end to the Viet-
 namese conflict through negotiations,
 and that negotiations as soon as possible
 are in the interest of this Nation and of
 all concerned.  That is his policy; that
 is U.S. official policy-period.
 In these circumstances, for an un-
 named official source to engage in an
 idle discussion-if that is what it was-
 of an alternative policy of triumph by
 attrition, is, to say the least, a breach of
 trust. With the President in the hospi-
 tal it is, indeed, an inexcusable breach of
 trust.
 So I would say to these anonymous offi-
 cials: You are appointed officials of this
 Government.  Your function is not to
 speculate to the press on the President's
 policy. Much less is it your function to
 advance publicly alternatives to his poli-
 ties, even under the anonymous cloak of
 "official sources."  Your function is to
 advise the President and carry out, in
 good faith, foreign policies which he
 makes in accord with constitutional
 processes.  Any other course, particu-
 larly in the critical Vietnamese situation,
 is an invitation to a lengthening of the
 casualty lists, to the most serious diffi-
 culties and division at home and to dis-
 aster in our relations with the rest of the
 world.
 That ought to be understood without
 the saying by every appointed official of
 the Government.  The recent rash of
 anonymous official speculation on Viet-
 nam, however, makes It clear that it
 needs to be said.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the RECORD, nine
 excerpts from the President's statement
 to the press on July 28, 1965, articles and
 editorials on this subject.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 I
 Second, once the Communists know,..as we
 know, that a violent solution is impossible,
 then a peaceful solution is inevitable.  We
 are ready now, as we have always been, to
 move from the battlefield to the conference
 table.
 I have stated publicly and many times,
 again and again, America's willingness to be-
 gin unconditional discussions with any Gov-
 ernment at any place at any time.
 Fifteen efforts have been made to start
 these discussions, with the help of 40 na-
 tions throughout the world.  But there has
 been no answer.  But we are going to con-
 tinue to persist, if persist we must, until
 death and desolation have led to the same
 conference table where others could now join
 us at a much smaller cost.

 of South Vietnam.                            Hanoi has set forth its
 awn proposals.  We are ready to discuss
 their proposals and our proposals and any
 proposals of any Government whose people
 may be affected, for we fear the meeting
 room no more than we fear the battlefield.
 And In this pursuit we welcome, and- we ask
 for the concern and the assistance of any
 nation and all nations.

 And if the United Nations and its officials
 or any one of its 114 members can by deed
 or word, private initiative or public action,
 bring us nearer an honorable peace, then
 they will have the support and gratitude of
 the United States of America.

 STRATEGY CHANGE IN VIETNAM BELIEF GROW-

 SUCCEED SOON
 (By Richard Dudman)
 WASHINGTON, October 16.-The outlines of
 a new strategy in Vietnam are emerging as
 the  influx  of  massive American  military
 strength begins to take effect.
 In its simplest terms, the new strategy
 calls for the use of large amounts of Ameri-
 can men and guns to win a military victory
 in the south.
 Some spectacular successes have changed
 the official atmosphere from the pessimism
 of 6 months ago, when the American effort
 faced imminent military defeat, to a growing
 conviction that the back of the insurgency
 can be broken in the  foreseeable future,
 possibly within months.
 Even the failures have helped promote the
 emerging strategy.  The lesson many plan-
 ners drew this week, when 2,000 Vietcong
 slipped out of a trap sprung by combined
 American and South Vietnamese forces, was:
 Secrecy is better kept when the Americans go
 it alone.
 The successes have strengthened the posi-
 tion of the so-called war hawks--those who
 never had much use for "special warfare"
 and  counterinsurgency  techniques,  who
 wanted to bomb North Vietnam or even
 China years ago, who have regretted Presi-
 dent Lyndon B. Johnson's offers to negotiate,
 and who believe that peace talks now would
 lead to a neutralist South Vietnam instead
 of the anti-Communist bastion they see as a
 possibility.

 The ".relatively benign policy of counterin-
 surgency" must be put aside for the time
 being, in the words of a policy paper being
 circulated . at high levels in the adminis-
 tration,
 As reliance on armed force increases, less
 is heard about, the winning of the hearts and
 minds of the population.
 Officials no longer are reluctant to talk
 about American use of napalm, tear gas, and
 crop-destroying aerial sprays.   Six months
 ago, if they were discussed at all it was to
 emphasize how little they were being used.
 Despite efforts to avoid injuring civilians
 in the fight against the Vietcong, women
 and children and old men are inevitably
 among the victims of a war fought increas-
 ingly with heavy bombs and artillery.
 A new defense of this strategy is being
 heard in Washington.  Critics are being as-
 sured that surveys of civilian populations
 subjected  to  air  attacks  show that  they
 blame the war in general for their suffering
 rather than the particular nation that Is
 doing the bombing.
 One student of civilian behavior, arguing
 in support of the enlarged war in Vietnam,
 contends that the rape of a single Vietnamese
 woman, by an American soldier causes far
 more resentment against the United States
 than does the destruction of an entire vil-
 lage.
 Less is heard, too, about a negotiated set-
 tlement.  When the outlook was black, the
 administration was nagging potential go-
 betweens in Communist and neutralist coun-
 tries to try to persuade North Vietnam to
 come to the conference table.
 Now that the military situation appears
 brighter, officials are emphasizing that ne-
 gotiation with the Communists is not the
 only likely solution.
 Officials pointed out this week that the
 problem could also be solved by an unan-
 nounced slowing down of North Vietnamese
 assistance and Vietcong activity in the south.
 The outcome thus need not follow the pat-
 tern of the Indochina war or the Algerian
 revolution, with their formal peace talks
 between the insurgents and the French. In-
 stead, it could follow the examples of Greece
 and the Philippines after World War II,
 when both nations successfully resisted Com-
 munist-led insurgencies.
 In Greece, the officials pointed out, the
 Communists simply were worn down and
 eventually retreated into Bulgaria.  The im-
 plication was that the Communist-led forces
 in South Vietnam might be worn down
 eventually and caused to retreat into North
 Vietnam.
 President Johnson has by no means bought
 the entire hard line.  He has not accepted
 the formula attributed to the new Director
 of the Central Intelligence Agency, William
 F. Raborn, -Jr.-"a Rotterdam policy in the
 north and a Dominican policy in the south."
 Reborn is said to have explained that this
 meant saturation bombing of Hanoi and
 sending into South Vietnam five times as
 many troops as seemed necessary.
 Bombers attacking the north have kept
 clear of the Hanoi area, where there would
 be a chance of direct military confrontation
 with the Soviet Union.  Russian-built mis-
 siles, which are concentrated around the
 North Vietnamese capital, have shot down
 five American planes in the last 4 months.
 The American troop buildup has reached
 145,000 and is expected to reach 200,000
 eventually.  Some military leaders speak of
 a million-man American force, but others
 scoff at that figure.  American troops in the
 Korean war numbered about 250,000.
 A measure of the buildup is the weekly
 casualty figure.  Fifty-eight Americans were
 No. 195-2
 killed in, action in Vietnam last week. Total
 American  casualties, rose  to  806  hostile
 deaths, 309 nonhostile deaths, 4,259 wounded
 in action, 76 missing in action, and 21 de-
 tained by the enemy.
 Strategists generally avoid the term "vic-
 tory," although in recent weeks that is clearly
 what some of them have had in mind.
 They base their present optimism on the
 apparent ability of the increased manpower
 and firepower to defeat the Vietcong any
 time the Reds stand still for a fight in regi-
 mental or division strength.  The war had
 been going in the direction of big-unit en-
 gagements, and the South Vietnamese Army
 was in serious, trouble until bolstered by
 American combat troops.
 The immediate task, therefore, is to pound
 and kill and harry the Vietcong's main force
 until it gives up or, more likely, breaks up
 into small guerrilla bands to continue the
 fighting without affording a good target.
 Once the Vietcong have been forced to
 return to guerrilla warfare, it is thought
 here, the insurgency will be close to defeat.
 The shift will mean breaking up elaborate
 supply lines for weapons and supplies, going
 back to using homemade or captured Ameri-
 can arms, and, worst of all, admitting to the
 Vietcong rank-and-file that there will not be
 a quick victory after all.
 The strategy paper mentioned earlier says
 that there are three possible outcomes from
 the American, point of view-defeat, a stale-
 mate, or victory.  It says that a stalemate
 would be the hardest to achieve. The impli-
 cation is that victory should be the goal.
 One policymaker  who  holds  that  view
 makes  the further point that victory is
 possible once the United States has forced
 the Vietcong to return to guerrilla warfare.
 He reasons that guerrilla wars invariably
 are won or lost, that they never end In a
 draw.  A ceasefire would mean that the Viet-
 cong would promptly lose all the gray areas,
 the territory where it can operate but can-
 not make a permanent stand.  The reason,
 he says, is that the Vietnamese Army would
 use a ceasefire to clean out any guerrillas
 remaining in such areas.
 Those who see the new strategy in these
 terms contend that progress cannot be meas-
 ured merely in enemy casualties.  They call
 an operation a success even if it results in
 few Vietcong bodies, because the objective
 is not so much to kill the enemy as to harass
 him and prove to him that his war is un-
 profitable.
 They insist also that the bombing of North
 Vietnam is hurting the Hanoi regime seri-
 ously and must be continued with no letup.
 This analysis rests on some broad assump-
 tions, which may or may not stand up.
 It assumes that the Vietcong lack the re-
 siliency to return to guerrilla warfare and go
 on effectively with the kind of fighting that
 took the British 10 years ,to suppress in
 Malaya.
 It assumes also that American power-
 planes crisscrossing the country and bombs
 pounding guerrilla hiding places-can make
 a country almost as big as Missouri an im-
 possible place to operate.
 On the political side, it assumes that the
 government of Gen. Nguyen Cao Ky, the
 chief of the Vietnamese air force, repre-
 sents a new breed of leaders, able at last to
 inspire the people with a revolutionary spirit
 that will unify them in the fight.
 Finally, this analysis assumes that favor-
 able results will come very soon.  President
 Johnson would find it embarrassing to go to
 the country seeking reelection in 1968 with
 -a stalemated war still on his hands, and the
 ever-larger conflict could well be an issue in
 the congressional elections next year.

 POLICY
 (By Albert Sehistedt, Jr.)
 WASHINGTON,            October  14.-U.S.  officials
 said today that a solution to the Vietnam
 situation could come about not only through
 negotiations but also by a gradual reduc-
 tion of Communist guerrilla aggression.
 This observation suggested that the com-
 bined military strength of the United States,
 South Vietnam, and their allies could reduce
 the power of the Vietcong to a level of Inef-
 fectiveness.
 Officials pointed out that there had been
 some discussion in the press which left an
 impression that negotiation with the Com-
 munists would be the only likely solution
 to the Vietnam problem.
 SIMILAR SITUATIONS RECALLED
 Today, these officials said it was important
 to keep in mind that there was another way
 to solve the problem,  which would come
 about by a reduction in the efforts of the
 Vietcong to subvert South Vietnam.
 Such  was the case in  Greece  and  the
 Philippines after World War II when both
 nations successfully resisted Communist in-
 surgents' efforts to seize control.
 In Greece, for example, the Communists
 were simply worn down and eventually re-
 treated into Bulgaria.
 So, too, It was implied today, the Commu-
 nist guerrillas in South Vietnam might be
 worn down eventually and retreat into North
 Vietnam or other parts of Asia controlled by
 the Reds.
 NEGOTIATIONS STILL SOUGHT
 However, officials here emphasized that the
 United States is still anxious to negotiate
 in Vietnam and is not leaning toward a more
 militant approach to a solution of the south-
 east Asian affair.
 These officials also made it clear that the
 United States is in a much better position
 to negotiate than it had been in the past.
 American strength in South Vietnam has
 reached 145,000, the draft is being greatly
 increased at home  and selected  National
 Guard and Reserve units totaling 150,000
 men are being brought to an increased state
 of readiness.
 Furthermore, the expected monsoon offen-
 sive of the Vietcong has been blunted this
 summer.  It had been feared that the gueril-
 las, taking advantage of bad flying weather
 for American aircraft, would mount large-
 scale attacks against South Vietnamese and
 American defenses.
 While the failure of this expected offensive
 is encouraging, U.S. officials made it clear
 that the defeat of the guerrilla force, num-

 bering perhaps 230,000 men, is far from
 achievement.
 Pacification of the countryside is the ob-
 Jecti.ve, and no extensive area of South Viet-
 nam, under Vietcong control has yet been
 pacified.
 Pacification is defined as putting a power-
 ful allied force in a Vietcong area for that
 length of time that would be required to
 reinstitute the economy of the region, and
 assure the safety of the people to such a
 degree that the military units could then
 move out.
 That kind of operation is not only ambi-
 tious but requires cooperation with other ele-
 ments of the Government to build up the
 faith of the people in the Saigon regime to
 the extent that those people believe the
 Government is capable of protecting them
 against the Vietcong.
 Such a result Is not achieved in a day or
 a week.
 [From the New York Times, Oct. 17, 1965]
 THE WomLD:  VIETNAM  BALANCE  SHEET
 Optimism has always been more preva-
 lent-and far more popular-than pessimism
 among the American community in Viet-
 nam.           Yet there have been many signs that
 the long-range trend of the war against the
 Oonamumsts has been inexorably unfavor-
 able and that short-term, present trends
 should be viewed within that context.
 In 1962, for example, the regular "hard
 core" Vietcong guerrilla force was estimated
 at about 18,000 men.  Today it is estimated
 at about 75,000 men.
 I:a April of 1963 American generals were
 saying that the war would be won within a
 year, and by late summer Defense Secretary
 Robert McNamara said that all American
 troops could be withdrawn by the end of
 1965.
 In early 1964 the Americans chose to make
 populous Longan Province, just south of
 Saigon, amodel or test case of anti-Commu-
 nist pacification methods. The program has
 since been shelved and the Vietcong are still
 strong In Longan.  Pacification is what one
 American calls the "nasty, gutty business"
 of securing a territory from which the Viet-
 cong are dislodged and making sure they
 do not filter back as strong as ever.
 The present military trends, on the other
 hand, are unquestionably favorable.  Be-
 tween December of last year and June of
 this year the Vietcong had staged at least
 a dozen regimental-sized attacks.  But with
 the arrival of more and more American troops,
 and improved morale and performance of
 South Vietnamese forces, the Vietcong have
 become much more cautious and have seldom
 massed in regiments.
 U.S. strength in South Vietnam now is
 nearly 145,000 men (an increase of 115,000
 since President Johnson first made his "un-
 conditional discussions" offer last April) and
 is expected to jump to 200,000 by the end of
 the year.. As part of its general build up of
 the Armed Forces as a consequence of the
 Vietnam commitment, the Defense Depart-
 ment last week ordered a military draft
 call of 45,224 men for December, the biggest
 quota since the Korean war.
 The technology and skill of American air
 power have neutralized most Vietnamese
 Government mistakes and penalized most
 Vietcong attempts at aggressive action.
 However, in recent weeks there have also
 been a few disturbing factors.  In one 4-day
 period the Vietcong staged' three ambushes
 of American units, and while all three were
 small affairs and while the Americans gen-
 erally reacted well, the guerrillas showed that
 this favorite trick against South Vietnamese
 troops could work against Americans, too.
 Three weeks ago the Vietcong did mass in
 regimental size In Binhdinh Province, in
 central South Vietnam, and began a battle
 which has raged off and on ever since.  Per-
 haps as many as five battalions of crack
 troops came out to fight despite the threat
 of air power and huge allied task forces.
 The difficulties of pinning down the Viet-
 cong were evident in the Binhdinh opera-
 tions last week.  For 5 days 8,000 Americans
 and at least 4,000 Government troops--de-
 scribed as the biggest United States-Viet-
 namese ground assault force of the war-
 pursued a large Vietcong unit and a regular
 North Vietnamese Army regiment said to
 be in Suaica Valley.  But by the time the
 allied force swept through the area the North
 Vietnamese were nowhere to be seen and
 most of the Vietcong had slipped into the
 hills.   Only a small number of guerrillas
 were reported killed.
 Assessments of how badly the Vietcong
 have been hurt in recent weeks depend on
 how literally casualty estimates issued by of-
 ficials in Saigon are taken. Though there is
 little doubt that the Vietcong have suffered
 serious losses, a senior and well-informed
 source said, "We think they have been able
 to reconstitute most of those losses within
 South Vietnam"-that is, through new re-
 cruitment and conscription rather than pri-
 marily  through  mass  infiltration  of  new
 units of the North Vietnamese regular army.
 An optimistic appraisal by an expert is that
 it will take at least a year of continued
 American military initiatives before the Viet-
 cong will be hurt enough to allow a "real"
 rural pacification program to begin, and that
 such a program will take at least 2 years
 before its succeeds.
 Accordingly, while recent political trends
 have been favorable, they are so only in a
 relative,   limited   sense.  Prime   Minister
 Nguyen Cao Ky, the 35-year-old commander
 of the air force, has increasingly impressed
 American officials with his ability, candor,
 and intellectual honesty.     There is no sign
 of distintegration in the present military
 government.
 As for prospects for a negotiated settle-
 ment, nothing in the present situation offers
 much realistic hope.  One student of North
 Vietnam commented that the revolutionary
 heroes of the Hanoi regime remain stubbornly
 convinced that the methods and principles
 which defeated the    French in Indochina
 will again prevail.
 This view seemed to be borne out by the
 negative results of Washington's intensive
 10-week diplomatic effort to draw the Com-
 munists to the conference table. Hanoi was
 reported last week to have shown no inter-
 est whatsoever in third-party soundings to
 the effect that the Johnson administration
 was interested in a tacit or explicit agree-
 ment to reduce the fighting.  The adminis-
 tration was said to be virtually resigned to
 failure of the peace offensive, and many of-
 ficials in Washington now believe a long
 and costly military campaign is necessary
 before diplomats can try again.

 Oct. 15, 19651
 THE LONG ROAD
 The only limited success won by the Amer-
 ican-South Vietnamese attempt to trap a
 large body of Communist elite troops con-
 tains a hard but probably needed lesson.
 The fact that most of the North Vietnamese
 force was able to slip away from so formid-
 able and elaborate a trap is a reminder that
 no early and decisive military victory can be
 expected.
 True, the situation in Vietnam is gratify-
 ingly  better  today  than  most  observers
 thought possible 6 months ago. The mon-
 soon season passed without the dreaded Viet-
 cong victory and a South Vietnamese defeat.
 It is apparent, however, that, although im-
 proved, the situation is still far from ideal.
 The jungles, paddies, swamps, and fields of
 South Vietnam swarm with tough, dedicated,
 ably trained guerrillas.  Some of these oper-
 ate in small groups of a half-dozen or so.
 Others exist in battalion and perhaps even
 regimental strength.  They are supported by
 a network of local sympathizers and spies who
 provide them with eyes everywhere.
 Thus, to date, little more has been achieved
 than to blunt the Vietcong-North Viet-
 namese effort to move from guerrilla to open
 warfare.   The Communist guerrilla poten-
 tial  remains  high.   So, to a considerable
 degree, the situation is merely back to where
 it was a few years ago.
 It may not, of course, stay there.  Ameri-
 can military might is so stupendous-even
 when utilized under such difficult conditions
 as jungle warfare-that it is difficult to be-
 lieve that it will not be able to overbear any
 conceivable resistance.
 Yet, even at best, such a military victory
 would be a long and costly task.  And it is
 well for the American people to realize this
 fact.  The United States can take satisfac-
 tion that it has well begun the hard task of
 helping save a small and doughty ally from
 Communist aggression.  But in this sentence
 the operative word is begun.
 Perhaps the greatest hope still resides in
 the possibility that both North Vietnam and
 the  Vietcong  will slowly but  surely be
 brought to see that victory cannot be theirs.
 If the road before Washington and Saigon is
 still long and hard, it is even more so before
 both Hanoi and the Vietcong.  It is because
 of this that Washington should be inde-
 fatigable in offering peace and in encourag-
 ing the United Nations to seek means of
 bringing all concerned to the negotiation
 table.
 Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, I com-
 mend the majority leader for his very
 forceful statement condemning the prac-
 tice of persons making vital statements
 concerning the Nation and asking that
 they be referred to as "unidentified" or
 "unnamed" officials.  There is no more
 sinister method of poisoning the minds of
 citizens than the technique of "it is offi-
 cially reported" but the official involved
 is not willing to be named.
 I commend the Senator for speaking
 out on this subject.  It is idle for me to
 say that the time is at hand when we
 should begin to worry about the security
 of our country, if ever it was necessary,
 and to speak the truth and allow the
 public to know who the persons are mak-
 ing these condemnations so that the peo-
 ple can evaluate the reliability or the
 credibility of the officials to whom the
 statements are attributed.
 I am sure that there is not a single
 Member of the Senate who has not been
 through the ordeal of being referred to
 by unidentified sources.
 What kind of proof is that? Yet, that
 is the kind of material which is being
 fed to the people of the Nation. We must
 not tolerate it any longer.
 Yesterday, I pointed out that there was
 in my office a Lieutenant Kapelka who
 was summoned to go to South Vietnam.
 There he sat, in front of me, approxi-
 mately 28 years old.  He said, "I have
 no hesitation in going to Vietnam.  I am
 prepared to go, but I cannot stand the
 denunciations and the demonstrations
 fussed,  the inflow of American military
 strength helped reverse the trend of war so which are endangering the lives of our

 beatniks and demonstrators, many of
 them innocently led by skillful Commu-
 nists, do not know what they are doing.
 They are probably putting a noose
 around. their own necks. Certainly they
 are endangering the lives of our men in
 southeast Asia who will have to engage in
 protracted fighting because the North
 Vietnamese, the Red Chinese and the
 Russians will feel, "We have them on the
 run.  Demonstrations are occurring in
 Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, and
 Berkeley, which means that they do not
 have the will to defend their Nation."
 Of course, that is exactly what it
 means.
 I again congratulate the Senator from
 Montana on the fine leadership he has
 displayed yesterday and today on this
 subject.

 Washington, D.C., October 18, 1965.

 From:  WRIGHT PATMAN, chairman.

 DEMONSTRATIONS ON WEEKEND
 (Mr. YOUNGER (at the request of Mr.
 HALL) was granted permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. YOUNGER.  Mr. Speaker, apro-
 pos of the demonstrations that were held
 over the past weekend, it seems to me
 that the articles written by Reporter
 Jerry LeBlanc and published in the Eve-
 ning Outlook of Santa Monica, Calif.,
 should be of interest to every thoughtful
 person who desires to understand the
 background for those demonstrations.
 Mr. LeBlanc joined the extreme left
 incognito, met and picketed with them,
 so his articles are from firsthand ob-
 servation.
 The reports were published in a series
 of 12 articles, which follow:
 WRITER INFILTRATES LEFT-"FIRED" REPORTER
 JOINS REVOLUTIONARY RANKS
 (By Jerry LeBlanc)
 Two months ago I stripped off my necktie
 and jacket and stepped into a strange, to-
 tally different world.
 it is a world peopled with bearded radicals
 and      longhaired  social  rebels  marching
 against the society most Americans perhaps
 too blindly take for granted.
 From the Watts uprising to the Vietnam
 protests, wherever the picket signs were pa-
 raded, whenever unrest sparked demonstra-
 tions, I was with them.
 I joined their organizations, their picket-
 lines,  strategy  sessions,  coffee discussions,
 public forums, parties, and endless commit-
 tee meetings, and watched as they pressed
 their cause on every soapbox, and even door
 to door.
 This is the world of the extreme left.  I
 joined these revolutionaries because today
 more than ever they are making news, and
 news is the business of a reporter.  I went
 in blindly, objectively, not knowing who I'd
 meet or what I'd find.
 I BECAME "UNEMPLOYED"
 I didn't reveal that I was a reporter on as-
 signment by the Evening Outlook.                A news-
 man on an investigation knows that if he
 identifies himself as a reporter, or is found
 out to be one, he is told only what is con-
 sidered appropriate, or "safe," for him to
 hear.  Only if he can penetrate inside the
 subject he is investigating, can he learn what
 really makes it tick.
 I had a perfect "cover" to preserve my
 anonymity, too.  The editor "fired" me one
 day, then quietly reemployed me the next
 day.  As far as everyone inside and outside
 the paper was concerned, I was no longer
 on the payroll.
 And it helped to take my wife, Renee,
 along with me at times.
 My cover proved its worth later, when I
 found myself under deep suspicion.
 The members of the extreme left that I be-
 came acquainted with through the weeks I
 was with them are not monsters or raving
 fanatics, and just as surely as every school-
 child believes the Boston Tea Party was a
 righteous assault against an oppressive en-
 emy, they sincerely believe they are working
 for justice.
 For the most part, I found, the object of
 their animosity is the U.S. Government and
 virtually  all  duly  constituted  authorities
 within the country.
 HE'S PROFESSIONAL REVOLUTIONARY
 Earlier, I called these people revolution-
 aries.                                                                                I did so because that is what they call
 themselves.  One day I asked a fellow com-
 mitteeman what he did for a living.
 "I consider myself a professional revolu-
 tionary, actually," he replied, "but for a liv-
 ing I do anything: social work, youth work,
 drive taxi."
 Many of  the people I  encountered  are
 moved by sincere idealism and love for their
 fellow man.
 One night, after I had reached the com-
 mittee level of the extreme left, a sweet-
 voiced teeenager telephoned m.  "I want to
 join your demonstration," she said, "but my
 mother won't let me go if we're going to get
 arrested."
 "Don't  worry,  honey,"  I told  her,  "my
 mother wouldn't let me go either if we were
 going to do anything that would get us ar-
 rested."
 A few nights later I was jolted when a man
 stood up at a meeting and publicly advocated
 what I consider treason.
 HOW I GOT "IN"
 It's easy to enter into this world of revo-
 lutionaries,  but  acceptance  in  their  "in
 group" is another thing.  That investigative
 agencies of law enforcement bodies have pen-
 etrated them is certain, but the revolution-
 aries accept this with a certain wry humor.
 "Our hardest workers are FBI men," one
 comely female leader, Margaret Thorpe, area
 organizer for the Students for a Democratic
 Society, told me with a smile.  "Whenever we
 spot one we load him down with work."
 My tenure with the extreme left began on
 the night of July 9 at 5 Dudley Avenue, Ven-
 ice, headquarters of the W. E. B. DuBois clubs
 in southern California.
 I just walked into a meeting.
 It seemed as good a place as any to start,
 since I was familiar with the area, and since
 FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover has described
 the DuBois clubs as Communist born.
 HAAG  A  GENTLEMAN
 I  had  purposely                     donned  the  shabbiest
 clothes in my limited wardrobe, but by com-
 parison, I was a standout contender for the
 best dressed award of the night, the only
 competition in the neatness department com-
 ing from John Haag, who was conducting
 the meeting.
 Haag, 34, a Harvard graduate and owner of
 a coffee house at 7 Dudley Avenue, next door
 to DuBois headquarters, is chairman of the
 Los Angeles area DuBois organization-and
 is possibly one of the_ most gentlemanly,
 dedicated men I've ever met.
 In addition to his DuBois club activity, I
 was soon to learn that Haag is a leader of
 the committee to end the war in Vietnam
 and an  ad hoc  committee  against police
 brutality.
 And John Haag is a self-declared enemy of
 the state, if one is to believe a lapel button
 he wears from time to time.
 He is also intelligent and soft spoken, has
 a talent for poetry and a boundless sym-
 pathy for victims of society's ills.  And he
 produces a good cup of coffee.
 At that first meeting, I was apparently
 looked on as being just a curious stranger,
 but I soon learned that all groups, in the
 extreme left are wary of possible infiltrators.
 FIRST  WARNING  COMES
 One of the first warnings I received of this
 came conversationally, it seemed, at a meet-
 ing several days later in the middle-class
 home of an attorney in Burbank.
 Myself, Carol Eaton, Morris Moses, Richard
 Hayden,  and  the  host  and  hostess,  were
 present.   "You  know,"  said Carol   Eaton,
 chairman of the Vietnam protest publicity
 committee, "DuBois is awfully worried about
 infiltration. Haag always has to watch out
 for the FBI, because they're poking their
 noses into everything Red, particularly some-
 thing like DuBois, where they're 40 percent
 Communist."
 "Sixty percent," someone corrected.
 When I heard those figures, I wondered
 if they had been tossed out in that casual
 manner to surprise me and perhaps make me
 ask questions that would indicate too much
 curiosity.
 I didn't comment on them, and my guess
 now is that they are far too high.
 But not long after this meeting I was
 confronted directly as a suspected infiltrator.
 It  happened  after  a routine session  at
 Haag's Venice coffee house, where I had be-
 come a regular visitor.  I started to leave
 and Haag called, "Wait a minute, I'll walk
 along a ways."
 AN ANSWER NEEDED
 We passed several groups of tough-looking
 Venice denizens clustered outside the DuBois
 office and on the sidewalk farther down.
 They all recognized Haag and made room
 for us to pass.
 I got the distinct impression he was usher-
 ing me through the groups, and I had heard
 among snatches of conversation the phrase
 "paid informer."
 But Haag and I talked about Vietnam,
 society, poetry and the difficulties of operat-
 ing a beatnik coffee house, until he said
 what the evidently came with me to say:
 "I hear the Evening Outlook is looking for
 someone to infiltrate the club."
 I stopped walking.  I needed a casual reply,
 right away.
 "That sounds like something they'd do,"
 I said.  "I know, because I worked there until
 I was fired about a month ago."
 "Oh?" he questioned, but I was sure he
 knew that much about me.
 "Why would they infiltrate anyway, John?"
 I asked.  "You've got nothing to hide; your
 meetings  are  open  to  the  public,  aren't
 they?"
 CONTINUES ACTIVITIES
 I wasn't sure right way, but I thought
 I was in the clear.    There was a look of
 doubt in his eyes and we gradually shifted
 to another subject.
 I made it a point to continue my activity
 in Venice as though Haag had said nothing
 which applied to me.
 If anyone asked, I told him I was a free
 lance writer for the classical music magazine
 Virtuoso and for Reuters Wire Service, which
 is true.
 After that time, I was able to edge into the
 "in-group," a term the leaders use to differ-
 entiate between themselves and the hangers-
 on.
 On the Vietnam protest, I was named to
 their publicity and literature committees.
 In the Congress of Unrepresented People I
 was appointed to the publicity committee and
 was made a torchlight parade monitor.
 The DuBois Club named me cochairman
 of a special committee to prepare a Watts
 riot brochure for national distribution.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE          October 19, 1965
 26504
 The local scene of mysterious lettered
 organizations opened to me, SNCC, SDS, SP,
 SWP, YSA, YPSL, and others began to un-
 ravel as:
 Student  Nonviolent  Coordinating  Com-
 mittee,Students for a Democratic Society,
 Socialist  Party,  Socialist Workers Party,
 Young Socialists   of America and Young
 People's Socialist League.
 Amid investigation of the Los Angeles ex-
 treme left, I flew to the San Francisco Bay
 area to view first hand the parallels in opera-
 tions there, and then I broadened my field
 into a nationwide probe.
 POTENTIAL IS GREAT
 The most obvious goal of the extreme
 left, I saw, is to form a coalition uniting the
 ultraliberals, the civil rights  fighters, the
 peace movement, the university rebels and
 the Socialist leaders.
 The potential is great :
 From the civil rights workers comes a
 proven willingness to die for a cause, and
 many of them, disillusioned with Dixie efforts
 to correct racial ills, have seized upon the
 greater  idea  of  changing  society  itself.
 University "of California rebels, also versed
 in civil disobedience and teeming with ani-
 mosity for policemen who took them to jail,
 contribute numbers to the cause and the
 challenging spirit of youth.
 The pacifists and the disillusionedfurther
 enlarge the "antiestablishment" organiza-
 tion.
 The ultraliberals and Socialists provide the
 philosophy, organizational talent, and a -long
 trained core of leaders for this new revolu-
 tion.
 COUP EMERGES AS SUPERFRONT FOR PROTESTORS
 (EDITOR'S NoTE.-Jerry LeBlanc, Evening
 Outlook staff writer, spent 2 months under-
 ground as a member of the extreme left in
 Los Angeles. This is the second of a series
 of articles on who the leaders are, what they
 are attempting to do, and how they are
 trying to do it.)
 (By Jerry LeBlanc)
 Early last month, I joined a new leftist
 organization called the Congress of Unrep-
 resented People (COUP), which unfurled its
 banner simultaneously in  Iashington, D.C.,
 and Los Angeles with the battle cry:
 "We intend, to have a government that
 truly represents us even if we have to create
 it for ourselves."
 Out of nowhere the organization suddenly
 appeared in a dozen communities across the
 Nation and, on the weekend of August 7,
 while I marched in' a demonstration here,
 2,000persons massed in Washington and a
 tenth of them landed in jail.
 Simultaneously,  in  Berkeley, attempts
 were made to halt troop trains.  In  San
 Francisco hundreds gathered in opposition
 to their government. At Oakland, San Diego,
 the  United  States-Canadian border  and
 other points, COUP staged rallies.
 I learned this was only a dress rehearsal
 of things to come.
 the framework of the organization at 107
 Rhode Island NW,, have been involved in
 virtually every controversial cause of the
 decade:
 The Free Speech Movement, W. E. B. Du-
 Bois Clubs, Vietnam Committee, Socialist
 Party,  Communist  Party,  Students  for  a
 Democratic Society, the Anti-House Commit-
 tee                                                                                    on Un-American Activities movement,
 pro-Cuba factions, police brutality protests,
 and many others.
 Every cause that tends to undermine exist-
 ing authority comes within the scope of
 COUP.
 COUP ORGANIZATION
 It all started not in Washington, but on
 the Berkeley campus of the University of
 California last May, I learned.
 One night, I sat on the floor at the home
 of Jimmy Garrett, a personable young Negro
 whose courage has been tested in the Dixie
 civil rights frontlines.
 I  asked  him  how  COUP  really  began.
 There were four of us there, awaiting an or-
 ganizing meeting in his apartment at 3825
 Effie Street, Los Angeles.
 "Bob Parris and I and a couple of other
 guys were sitting around like we are, on the
 campus grass at Berkeley, talking about all
 the things wrong with society, and we de-
 cided to do something about it," Garrett
 said.
 "We decided to try to organize all the dis-
 organized opposition to the Government Into
 a solid front."
 Garrett, like Parris, was working for the
 Student Nonviolent Coordinating Commit-
 tee.  Parris, also called "Moses," is another
 battle-scarred  veteran  of  Southern  racial
 clashes.
 CHANGE SOCIETY
 They admit coming away from the civil
 rights front confused as to where the line is
 drawn between violence and convinced that
 society as a whole must be changed, not just
 Dixie.
 Moses went to Washington to  organize
 COUP, while Garrett came here.
 Moses says this about Mississippi: "Most
 liberals think of Mississippi as a cancer * *
 but we think (it) an accurate reflection of
 America's  values  and  morality. Sheriff
 Rainey is not a freak; he represents the
 majority.  And what he did is related to the
 napalm bombings of objects in Vietnam."
 Garrett echoes this belief.     "Not only the
 Negroes in America are victims of this so-
 ciety," he said.  "The whole middle class is
 trapped the same way.   I call it 'slavery
 with a smile."'
 Prof. Staughton Lynd, of Yale, voiced the
 COUP idea before the thousands of students
 assembled  for  the  Berkeley  teach-in  last
 May 21.
 He  congratulated the      W. E.  B.   DuBois
 Clubs for publication of a diatribe called
 "The U.S. War in Vietnam," and the DuBois
 monthly    magazine,  Insurgent,    reprinted
 Lynd's speech.
 YALE  PROFESSOR
 "For the benefit of FBI agents present,"
 the professor said, "let me make it clear that
 Lynd, who has been affiliated with the
 Progressive Labor Party and the Socialist
 Workers Party, cited by the Attorney Gen-
 eral as subversive, voiced the general senti-
 ment of the movement with:
 "I think all of us should search our hearts

 I marched with COUP from South Park
 in the heart of the Los Angeles Negro dis-
 trict to Exposition Park, where headquarters
 were set up for a weekend of public work-
 shops, from which were to emerge the peo-
 ple's resolutions and demands for solving
 their divergent problems.
 WALKED 30 BLOCKS
 Relays of police squad cars ushered 200 of
 us all the way, and I paced off more than
 30 blocks.                                  Having been a committee mem-
 ber from the start, I was made a monitor for
 the march, wearing a blue arm band and
 urging stragglers to keep up the pace.
 'Young  students,  elderly  ladies,  bearded
 radicals, and Negroes joined the parade.  We
 marched along Avalon Boulevard and wher-
 ever Negroes gathered they were handed leaf-
 lets or a verbal explanation of what COUP
 stood for.
 This was Friday, August 6.  Within a week,
 in an unrelated development, the street was
 a burning shambles,  wrecked by mobs of
 Watts Negroes running wild in the worst riot
 in the history of the United States.
 When our marching group arrived at Ex-
 position Park, John Haag                                                                                                                                                     of the DuBois
 Clubs was introduced as chairman for the
 evening.  Carl Bloice of the Communist-line
 People's World newspaper and Jimmy Gar-
 rett were among the first speakers.
 GROUNDLESS YEAR
 At the meeting at which final plans for the
 rally were made, one member had voiced the
 fear, "Suppose the persons attending come
 up with some kind of a resolution that we
 don't want"
 This fear proved groundless.   As people
 turned out for the event, they were guided
 by the hard core revolutionaries and the
 outcome was never in doubt.  The deck was
 stacked by the  in-group-regulars  of  the
 Vietnam Committee, DuBois, Student Non-
 violent  Coordinating                                                                                                                                                   Committee,  Students
 for Democratic Society and Young Socialists
 (virtually the identical membership of the
 Vietnam Committee).
 After the first night, attendance dwindled
 to half on Saturday, a fourth on Sunday.
 But it was not considered a failure.
 NATIONAL SUCCESS
 A few new recruits had been added to the
 mailing lists.  A few more could be counted
 on to show up at meetings and picket lines.
 And a permanent type of COUP organization
 was formed with an agreement to meet again
 and press further for the demands brought

 kindred organizations, overlapping in func-
 tion and all having in common this one
 thing: Creation of a new political force.
 The DuBois Club makes no bones about its
 aims:  "By courageous dedication to, and
 militant action In, the fight to solve the im-
 mediate problems of Americans of all races,
 ages, and nationalities, a socialist movement
 will win the democratic majority which alone
 can make a socialist America."
 The aim of the group is quite clear and
 overtly stated.
 Hoover put it this way: "The (Communist)
 party is making every effort to Increase its
 influence in the racial struggle and continues
 to promote the false impression that it is a
 legitimate political party."
 He added, "It has assigned priority to a
 recruitment campaign aimed at gaining new
 members from the ranks of American youth.
 To implement this program, it initiated a
 new national Marxist youth organization last
 June-the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of Amer-
 ica."
 Former FBI counterspy, Herbert Philbrick
 said in San Francisco that the DuBois Club
 is :Ailing the void that once was the Young
 Communist League.
 Called on for an example, he said.  "One
 basic Communist strategy is to deliberately
 violate the law, provoke the police into
 cracking down and then hurling charges of
 'police brutality.' "
 CALL FOR POLITICAL FORCE
 Speaking for the club itself, the editors of
 Insurgent take a broader view:
 "Until now, the focus for activists was
 the sporadic picket, sit-in, strike, march-
 the movement growing from action to ac-
 tion, slumping, then gaining larger life in
 some new and unexpected spot.
 "But behind these outbursts of ever-grow-
 ing action, something new is coming.
 "The time is ripe for political organization,
 Incorporating all of the experiences of recent
 years, but building on far stronger founda-
 tions; uniting activists, racial minorities and
 great numbers of working people-and those
 who can't find work-into a permanent poli-
 tical force.
 "Such work will spread, and with it the
 possibility for the people to assume the power
 and, transform America into a real demo-
 cracy--a socialist democracy."
 INSIGNIA DESCRIBED
 The Insignia of the DuBois Club is a half-
 white, half-black circle with a white hand
 and a black hand reaching for a dove, sym-
 bolizing brotherhood of man and peace, or
 civil rights and Vietnam, depending on your
 Interpretation.
 The founding convention of the organiza-
 tion was held June 19-21, 1964, in San Fran-
 cisco.
 Among those on hand for the initial meet-
 ing was Terence Hallinan, son of Vincent
 Hallinan,  once Progressive  Party  (a cited
 Communist front) candidate for President
 and an ardent pro-Soviet.
 Another DuBois Club founder was Mike
 Myerson, author of the publication,  "The
 U.S. War in Vietnam."
 Bettina Aptheker, daughter of top-ranked
 Communist theoretician Herbert Aptheker
 and a leader in the Free Speech Movement
 at the University of California, is another
 founder.  She coauthored the DuBois book
 on the FSM crisis.

 October 19, 1965          CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 DuBois is trying to organize Washington
 University students, is working on political
 organization in Negro neighborhoods, and
 on the widespread Vietnam protest.
 COMMUNIST KIN INVOLVED
 In Madison, Wis.,  a 33-member DuBois
 club,  headed by Mrs. Eugene Dennis Jr.,
 daughter-in-law of the ex-chieftain of the
 American Communist Party, meets at her
 home, 202 Marion Streets, and concentrates
 on the University of Wisconsin campus,
 where some 50 midwest DuBois delegates held
 a convention last February to organize Viet-
 nam demonstrations.
 Also on the campus, a Vietnam protest was
 led by DuBois member Daniel Friedman.
 Mrs. Dennis' husband operated a separate,
 noncampus DuBois Club but apparently left
 Madison this summer.  He is regional co-
 ordinator of the DuBois clubs, but a New
 Yorker.
 There is also reliably reported to be a func-
 tioning DuBois group in Newark, N.J., and
 there probably are others.
 Returning to the West Coast again, we find
 a small club with 20 members in Portland,
 Ore., most of them ex-Reed College students.
 Headed by Jeffery Sachar of New York, they
 expect to organize another unit on the
 campus  of  Portland  State  College  this
 semester.
 The DuBois Club survey did not include
 asking for information on organizations with
 similar alms, such as the Vietnam protest
 committees. That there are connections be-
 tween the groups is an inescapable conclu-
 sion, however.
 EXAMPLE GIVEN
 Just as one example, Carl Oglesby, presi-
 dent of the Nationally-organized Students
 For A Democratic Society, stated a few
 months ago that SDS is considering action
 "that may involve deliberate violation of one
 or more of the nation's espionage laws" to
 show opposition to the U.S. policy in Viet-
 nam,
 Oglesby, who lives at Ann Arbor, Mich.,
 where a massive Vietnam "teach-in" protest
 was held last spring, is a signer of the original
 Washington call for the Congress of Unrep-
 resented People (COUP).  As earlier articles
 in the series showed, COUP is an organization
 combining all DuBois club goals under one
 banner.
 I saw no direct evidence that DuBois is in
 charge of operations of other groups, but
 it is certainly true that DuBois leaders are _
 in almost all the major activist organiza-
 tions.
 The common membership of some groups
 is large and. in a situation where each group
 guards its independence, no one seems eager
 to emerge as an over-all commander, so long
 as the groups can be organized together on
 their common projects.
 IT'S SAME THING
 Once John Haag, Los Angeles area Du-
 Bois chairman, said to me, after telling of an
 upcoming DuBois-organized Venice neighbor-
 hood survey on the Vietnam issue:  "We'd
 like to meet somewhere else, so it doesn't
 seem we're behind everything, but I guess
 they know anyway."
 Another time, following a strategy meet-
 ing of the Congress of Unrepresented Peo-
 ple,                    Tom  Garrison,  formerly of ,the  Con-
 gress of Racial Equality and now prominent
 in DuBois activities, invited me to a COUP
 sign-painting party on a Tuesday night.
 "Sorry, I can't make it," I told him. "The
 Vietnam committee meets Tuesday night."
 "Skip it and come to our DuBois steer-
 ing committee meeting Wednesday night-
 it's the same thing."
 I believe him.  In my head I tried to mul-
 tiply the Los Angeles situation by the num-
 ber of other communities where DuBois and
 the peace groups are linked.
 My talent as a computer failed, but the ef-
 fective strength of such an alliance is far
 more powerful than the relatively tiny Du-
 Bois Club Itself.
 PROFILES OF ACTIVE  LEFTISTS-MEET PEOPLE
 OF FAR LEFT
 (EDITOR'S  NOTE.-Jerry LeBlanc, Evening
 Outlook staff writer, spent 2 months under-
 ground as a member of the extreme left in
 Los Angeles. This is the sixth of a series of
 articles on who the leaders are, what they
 are attempting to do, and how they are try-
 ing to do it.)
 (By Jerry LeBlanc)
 An FBI infiltrator in the extreme left has
 to be awfully careful how he goes about try-
 ing to keep tabs on who's who in the move-
 ment.
 One little mistake and he'll expose himself.
 As an  undercover  reporter  probing  the
 ultraleft-its people, aims, and activities-
 I met more than 3 dozen persons I can still
 remember by name, most of them in the
 category of "activists."
 One, I'm positive, was an FBI man who
 had penetrated the "in group" of the ex-
 treme left just as I had.  I had wanted very
 much to meet him because, from what I kept
 hearing, he was a leading figure in the revo-
 lutionary council.
 HE TIPS HIMSELF OFF
 Our  first                     direct  encounter  came  about
 when he telephoned.                     "Jerry," he said, "Bert
 in Berkeley suggested we get together."
 He tipped himself off by telephoning me
 at a number of a next-door neighbor which
 I didn't even know myself, and saying he
 got it from a guy I never met in Berkeley.
 The only way he could have gotten the
 number, I knew, had to be through police
 facilities, but I went along with this line and
 we agreed to contact each other at a meeting.
 From the instant we shook hands, I knew
 he knew I was suspicious of him, and every
 time I tried to corner him for a question,
 he started talking to someone else.
 HE PLAYED ROLE CAREFULLY
 He seemed less worried about my suspi-
 cions than the possibility that I might ex-
 pose him to another fellow whose acquaint-
 ance he was trying to cultivate.
 When the session was over, he seemed so
 relieved to extend a hand in farewell that I
 was tempted to wink at him.
 I never saw him again, and for all I know,
 he's still a trusted member of the leadership
 clique.
 I met a lot of interesting people in the
 ultraleft.  Despite  the  stereotype, bearded
 males and stringy-haired females were the
 exception, not the rule.
 The police of the ultraleft are professors
 and  poets,  professionals  and shirt-sleeve
 workingmen, bums and the opulent, men
 and women, boys and girls, Negroes, whites,
 and Orientals.
 I    met  them  in  colorful  coffeehouses,
 artistic hillside homes, cluttered offices, tract
 houses, sparsely furnished  apartments,  in
 the Negro district and the Hollywood hills,
 and on the campus and street corners.
 It's amazing how much you can find out
 about these people if you try.   Here are
 profiles of three I consider interesting:
 John Haag: Clean shaven, well educated,
 he came to Los Angeles in 1959 with his wife
 and worked at Space Technology until his
 security clearance was revoked.
 POLICE ENCOUNTERS
 He was involved in a couple of minor
 skirmishes with the police and was fined in
 one case, with charges dropped in the other,
 both linked to his beatnik Venice West coffee-
 house at 7 Dudley Avenue.
 He has a small son named Thomas Paine
 Haag.
 Haag, who I found very likeable, is area
 DuBois chairman, Venice chapter president
 of the American Civil Liberties Union, chair-
 man of an ad hoc committee against police
 brutality, and involved in the committee
 to end the war in Vietnam and the con-
 gress of unrepresented people and probably
 a half dozen other causes.
 MONEY DONATED
 Once I asked Haag if the coffeehouse he
 operates  next door  to  the  DuBois  head-
 quarters supports him financially.                                                                                                                                             He re-
 plied with a shrug.                                                                                                                                        "People give me money
 from time to time-people interested in
 what I'm doing."  Haag told me one night
 why he was part of the ultraleft. He sat at
 a crude wood table in his dimlit coffee-
 house.
 Nearby was a bulletin board, a mixed col-
 lection of antipolice and anti-Vietnam war
 literatiire,  leaflets  announcing  upcoming
 meetings  and      demonstrations,  notices  of
 fundraising  parties,  and  personal      notes
 from transient acquaintances and lovers.
 VAGABOND NATURE
 Winos, wandering youths, guitarists and
 poets pursued their interest at the other
 table.  These are people I sympathize with,
 having spent my own youth as a vagabond.
 "They come here looking for something
 that doesn't exist anymore," Haag said of
 his clientele.  "They're looking for a beatnik
 community like Greenwich Village once was.
 "A lot of them end up on wine or dope
 in 3 weeks.  That's what causes most of the
 trouble here: the ones on wine and pills.
 They mix cheap wine and seconal and go out
 of their heads.  There was a bunch I had to
 throw out last night and I think the same
 group stomped a kid sleeping on the beach,
 nearly killed him, for no reason"
 Pondering the senselessness of it, he con-
 tinued, "The beats are hopeless.  They come
 up with plenty of justified criticism of soci-
 ety, but they don't take part in changing
 things, and they never even suggested an
 alternative.  That's  one  of the reasons  I
 turned to politics and social reform for the
 answer."
 POLICE CHECK
 Our conversation was interrupted when a
 police car rolled up to the door, motor run-
 ning, radio blaring.  Haag's attractive wife,
 Anna,  a  fiery  brunette,  limping  on  one
 crutch as the result of an accident, called
 from the door, "John, will you talk to this
 cop?"
 Haag left and the coffeehouse resounded
 to the rafters with a cheer for Anna, who
 loudly slammed the door on the police.
 Police do display a great deal of interest
 in this coffeehouse and its inhabitants, but
 then, it is the unofficial headquarters for
 the rebels, the downtrodden, the idle, the
 winos,  pot  and pill users,  and,  concomi-
 tantly the troublemakers.
 Harassment is the term the coffeehouse
 habitues use to describe the police activities,
 and it is obvious the police bear down on
 the place as though it should not be per-
 mitted to exist.
 POLICE ARE COMFORTING
 I have never been there- when police did
 not make their presence known.  But I felt
 a lot safer that they were around.
 In any event, it became quite clear that
 the police are part of "the enemy" in the
 area and that Haag, who may agree philoso-
 phically with the lawmen that such neigh-
 borhoods should not exist, serves as unofficial
 champion of the "outcasts" of Venice in
 their undeclared battle with the police.
 And now that the coffeehouse and its next
 door political annex have become a center of
 operations for DuBois, the Vietnam protest
 and the new Congress of Unrepresented Peo-

 the police-citizen tension is heightened.
 "Why is it any better to hate cops than
 to hate Negroes?"  I asked once, "most of

 vent unanswered.
 OUTSPOKEN DISLIKE

 the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), he is
 outspoken in his dislike for police, brand-
 ing them as "the enemy."      -
 Myers, from Stockton, is 22, blond, col-
 legiate looking and has a militant speech to
 make at every function, whether it be YSA,
 the Vietnam Committee or COUP.  He is a
 detail man and a stickler for parliamentary
 procedure.
 At 19, he squatted in the door of the
 Atomic  Energy  Commission  in  Berkeley,
 challenging arrest.   He achieved arrest at
 the well-remembered Cadillac and Sheraton-
 Palace Hotel rights demonstration in San
 :Francisco.
 Since   1962  he has been picketing as  a
 pacifist.
 He said he believes the Socialists will one
 day have to take up arms to fight off Govern-
 ment suppression.  I nominate him for the
 most belligerent pacifist of the day award.
 ATTORNEY DESCRIBED
 Hugh Manes: A zealous and tireless attor-
 ney constantly seeking to reform society, he
 is a lawyer with offices in Hollywood and is
 an associate of A. L. Wirin in the American
 Civil Liberties Union.
 Manes, a participant in Socialist Workers
 Party-backed Military Labor Forum events,
 also help defend suspended Los Angeles po-
 Liceman Mike Hannon, whose Congress of
 Racial Equality activities came under fire.
 Manes is a 1964 member of the National
 Lawyers Guild, a cited Communist legal
 front, and helped prepare a thick dossier
 documenting alleged U.S. treaty violations
 in the Vietnam conflict.
 He is a member of the Los Angeles Vietnam
 protest committee.  An enthusiast for the
 cause, he turns red-faced when arguing it
 point.
 One of his best friends is not Los Angeles
 Police Chief William H. Parker.  When my
 committee was starting a DuBois brochure
 on the Watts riots, one member said, "III talk
 to Manes; he's got a file 15 years back on
 Chief Parker."
 The people involved in the ultraleft are
 diverse,  and  as  interesting  as  they  are
 numerous.
 LEFTIST RECRUITS YANKS TO BATTLE VIET GIs
 (EDITOR'S  NoTE.-Jerry LeBlanc, Evening
 Outlook staff writer, spent 2 months under-
 ground as a member of the extreme left In
 Los Angeles.  This is the seventh of a series
 of articles on who the leaders are, what they
 are attempting to do, and how they are at-
 tempting to do it.)
 (By Jerry LeBlanc)
 As a reporter, I don't consider myself easily
 shocked, but I admit being badly shaken
 one night recently when a man stood be-
 fore me and tried to enlist an international
 brigade        pitting  Americans  against Ameri-
 cans in a struggle to the death in Vietnam.
 As an undercover reporter probing the
 extreme left, I went with my wife to the
 Militant Labor Forum oil July 30 at 1702
 East Fourth Street, Los Angeles.
 In an upstairs hall, we passed through a
 propaganda-filled book store and entered a
 crowded back room.
 We paid a dollar each to get in and I'm not
 sure if it's tax deductible because the forum
 is operated by the Socialist Workers Party,
 which is listed by the Attorney General as a
 subversive  organization.  In any  event,  I
 entered the two bucks as one of the items
 on my expense sheet to the Evening Out-
 look.
 Leaflets advertising the forum were handed
 out at Congress of Unrepresented People
 sessions.
 The hall was complete with a bust of Leon
 Trotsky, who was assassinated in 1940 by
 employes of a one-time Communist bigwig
 named Stalin.
 Midway  through the  forum,  a  bearded
 spectator arose and declared that his orga-
 nization,  called the Freedom  Fighters,                                                                             is
 negotiating with North Vietnam envoys in
 Switzerland for permission to send a military
 brigade to fight on the side of the Vietcong.
 He was Ron B. Ramsey of 112 North Cul-
 ver Boulevard; Compton, a man who looked
 like a Cuban guerrilla but says he is a Ph. D.
 and is known to have been on the Berkeley
 campus, although neither as professor, which
 he calls himself, nor student.
 "We'll have our guns in our hands within
 a few weeks," he vowed and he offered to
 enlist volunteers on the spot.
 No one  seemed  particularly  shocked  at
 Ramsey's proposal.  No one but me, maybe.
 The principal activists of the Los Angeles
 area youth movement were all present at the
 speakers' table.
 PRINCIPALS NAMED
 They were Jimmy Garrett of the Student
 Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the
 Congress of  Unrepresented  People;  John
 Haag, area chairman of DuBois Clubs; Mar-
 garet Thorpe of the Students for a Demo-
 cratic Society;  Dorothy Balassa, who with
 Miss Thorpe is cochairman of the Committee
 To End the War in Vietnam; Darrel Myers,
 Los Angeles organizer for the Young Social-
 ist Alliance, and Cathy Gallagher of the
 Young People's Socialist League.
 Moderator for the panel, on the topic new
 youth and the old left, was Hugh Manes, one
 of the American Civil Liberties Union law-
 yers who helped defend Michael Hannon, Los
 Angeles police officer ousted for participating
 in Congress of Racial Equality activities.
 Manes was a 1964 member of the National
 Lawyers Guild, a cited Red front.  He is
 now circulating nationally among other law-
 yers a 35-page legal brief documenting al-
 leged U.S. violations of international law in
 the Vietnam action.
 Ramsey's statement was far more sensa-
 tional than most I heard from the radical
 left, and perhaps he is not representative
 of it.
 However, the next morning I phoned the
 office of the Student Nonviolent Coordinat-
 ing Committee in Hollywood and who an-
 swered?  None other than Ron Ramsey.
 INFORMATION GIVEN
 He gave me the information I wanted about
 a. Federal building rally that day, connected
 with the Vietnam protest, and with sus-
 pended police Officer Michael Hannon as the
 featured speaker.
 To further the connections, Ramsey also
 said he helped send three autos full of Los
 Angeles representatives to the Washington
 Congress of Unrepresented People march Au-
 gust 7-9.
 Mrs. Balassa was among the sponsors of
 the Federal Building rally which was pro-
 moted by the Committee to End the War in
 Vietnam.  Attorney Manes, also a commit-
 tee member, was present, as were the rest of
 the cast from the previous night.
 Ramsey, a Free Speech Movement activist,
 spent the early part of this year in an Al-
 gerian jail.   The Ben Bella aid he went
 to Algeria to work for has since been ousted.
 His travels also include Vietnam, he says,
 and he states that he was educated in Asia.
 He also was in Zanzibar, now Tanzania,
 after the Mohammed Babu coup.
 ACTIVE IN UNITED STATES
 In this country, he has been active in the
 peace and disarmament movements, apart
 from  his                    volunteer  army,  and  sometimes
 simultaneously.
 Another outspoken party to the Militant
 Labor Forum, which, by the way, reprints
 and circulates COUP pamphlets, is Myers, a
 one-time pacifist from San Francisco, active
 in the Vietnam protest at Berkeley and, one
 of those arrested in the Sheraton-Palace Ho-
 tel and Cadillac civil rights demonstrations.
 Myers,  at  the  Militant  Labor    Forum;
 cheered the stoning  of  police by  Harvey
 Aluminum Co. pickets in  July,  declaring,
 "They don't have to wait to be told who the
 enemy is."
 Myers does not believe the ultraleft activ-
 ists should go and fight against Americans
 in Vietnam.  He believes they should fight
 them on the home front.
 "WE MUST BE READY"
 "Sooner or later," Myers said, "the Govern-
 ment will come to regard the movement as
 the same kind of enemy as the forces it
 fights overseas.
 "At that time," he said, "we must be pre-
 pared to take up arms and defend ourselves
 to keep the movement alive.  But let the
 Government decide when the terror starts."
 As I said, Myers calls himself a pacifist, and
 has participated in picketing in numerous
 sit-ins in the cause of peace.
 The  fine  line  between  peace  and  war
 against their own government is one which
 several activist leaders straddle.
 Garrett, for instance said, "I'd like to go
 into the Negro district and set up a school
 for draft dodgers-to teach them how to keep
 out of the Army."
 HE WON'T GO
 "Me, I'm not going, because I don't want
 to be killed and I don't want to kill anybody.
 But some of these draftees don't know how
 to stay out."
 The burning of draft cards is a defiant
 demonstration of protest which has been
 advocated and carried out in many parts of
 the country, prompting new :legislation mak-
 ing such acts a crime.
 Perhaps one day, draft-dodger schools also
 will have to be banned.
 Another tactic in the formative stage with
 the Vietnam committee was described by
 James Gallagher of the Socialist Party.  "The
 leafleting of soldiers and sailors themselves,
 urging them to refuse to participate in the
 war, which means disobeying orders.       The
 committee wants to offer to put them in
 contact with  people who  will help      them
 plead themselves aeonscientious objectors."
 MANES ROLE TOLD
 Manes was to look into the legal rami-
 fications of such advocacy.
 The committee also hopes to enlist union
 aid in boycotting ships and refusing to load
 munitions on ships used in the Vietnam
 supply operation.
 And, in San Francisco, the Vietnam com-
 mittee has started the practice of trying to
 halt troop trains.
 They also suggest, "If for example, in
 Berkeley on October 16, thousands of stu-
 dents and others block the gates of the Oak-
 land Army Terminal where munitions are
 shipped to Vietnam, and are arrested, we
 think that attention will be focused dramati-
 cally on the issues in Vietnam."
 The possibility of sabotage has been openly
 hinted by the national leader of the Students
 for  a  Democratic  Society,  and  men  like
 Staughton Lynd, a leftist Yale professor, be-
 fore an audience of thousands, suggested
 storming Army terminals.
 TARGET  OF  IDEAS
 Once upon a time, people believed some
 wars had to be fought, but now, even those
 en route to die for their country are targets
 in the war of ideas.
 Picture a draftee's reaction, for instance.
 after giving up his schooling or work, being
 separated from his friends and family, leav-
 ing his hometown and training for Army
 service.   Bad enough luck being drafted;

 then he is chosen for the hottest front: Viet-
 nam.  And with all these sacrifices, en route
 to a foreign nation he is confronted by
 pamphlets from the extreme left telling him
 the war is not worth dying for.
 VIETNAM:  KEY  PROTEST  ISSUE-DIRECT  RE-
 PORTS FROM RED BLOC GUIDE ACTIVISTS
 (EDITOR'S  NOTE.-Jerry  LeBlanc,  Evening
 Outlook staff writer, spent 2 months un-
 derground as a member of the Extreme Left
 in Los Angeles.  This is the eighth in a series
 of articles on who the leaders are, what they
 are attempting to do, and how they are trying
 to do it.)
 (By Jerry LeBlanc)
 Reports direct from Moscow and North
 Vietnam are among the benefits received by
 in-group members of the DuBois Clubs and
 other Extreme Left organizations.
 One Saturday night in August, at 5555
 Green Oak Drive in the Hollywood Hills, I
 listened with fascination to such a report.
 Speaking was Carl Bloice, national pub-
 licity director of the DuBois Clubs and a
 staff writer for the Communist-line news-
 paper People's World.
 "North Vietnam has a special North Amer-
 ican affairs representative, and he knows
 more about the peace movement and youth
 movement in the United States than I do,"
 Bloice told the 30 or so persons at the meet-
 ing.
 KNOWS OFFICERS, ACTIVITIES
 "I saw him in Helsinki," Bloice said.  "He
 even knows the officers and when they were
 elected and what every group is doing."
 Bloice said he and Don Smith, chairman
 of the. Los Angeles Congress on Racial Equal-
 ity (CORE) had just returned from the Com-
 munist-dominated "World Peace Congress"
 In the Finnish capital,  They had made side
 trips to Leningrad and Moscow.
 With me on the grassy back yard of the
 fashionable hillside home was my wife, Re-
 nee, who often accompanied me during my
 Investigation of the Extreme Left.  All of us
 were gathered around on benches and patio
 chairs to hear the latest from this top-eche-
 lon figure in the peace movement.
 LEADERS ATTENDED MEETING
 Among the spectators were the leaders of
 every Vietnam picket line and protest in the
 Los Angeles area.
 Before Bloice himself had returned from
 Helsinki, I had picked up a copy of the
 World Peace Congress resolution on Vietnam
 being distributed by the San Francisco Du-
 Bois Club national office.
 Point by point and almost word for word,
 the resolution duplicates the current stand
 of the Vietcong.  It calls for:
 1. An immediate end to U.S. aggression in
 South Vietnam.
 2. Immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops and
 those of their satellites from South Vietnam.
 3. Removal of U.S. military bases from
 South Vietnam.
 4. Immediate ending-of bombing and other
 aggressive acts against the Democratic Re-
 public of Vietnam.
 No mention of negotiations is made, and
 Bloice explained why:
 "If the U.S. imperialists gain anything
 from this intervention, even if they only
 manage to bring about negotiations, that
 will be a gain and and they will have estab-
 lished a pattern for intervention in all fu-
 ture people's revolutions, wherever they hap-
 pen."
 LANGUAGE NOTED
 The Helsinki resolution, which was swift-
 ly circulated to all DuBois Clubs for a rub-
 berstamp approval, is replete with such lan-
 guage as:
 "The    U.S.     Imperialists * * * crimes
 agalrist peace-loving people * * * brilliant
 victories that the Vietnamese people have
 gained over an aggressive enemy * * *. The
 National Liberation Front (Vietcong politi-
 cal arm) is the only true representative of
 the South Vietnamese people."
 The  Helsinki  Congress  also warmly  ac-
 claimed, "The mass movements which are
 continually gaining in broad support and in-
 tensity among the people of many lands, in-
 cluding the United States of America itself,
 who are expressing their solidarity with the
 people of Vietnam against the imperialist
 U.S. aggressors."
 KNEW CF PROTESTS
 Oh, yes, they knew in Helsinki about at-
 tempts to organize a volunteer brigade of
 Americans  to                   join  the  Vietcong  against
 American troops.  This plan, it will be re-
 called, was aired by Ron B. Ramsay of Comp-
 ton at a meeting of the extreme left I at-
 tended.
 And they knew about and saluted efforts
 to halt troop and arms trains, by the Berke-
 ley Vietnam protests committee, I could see
 from a report of the Congress I found in the
 San Francisco DuBois office.
 They knew in Helsinki about these efforts
 3 weeks before they happened.
 The Los Angeles DuBois  officially states
 that "many of the resolutions passed at the
 Helsinki peace congress have particular rele-
 vance to the future of the DuBois clubs."
 The extreme left in the United States is
 preoccupied with the Vietnam issue, obvi-
 ously, and not only through the traditional
 Socilaist-oriented groups, but through the
 civil rights movement and pacifist  groups
 based onmoral and religious sentiment.
 Elsewhere in this series I spell out the links
 between these various peace     movements.
 The links between the anti-Vietnam war ef-
 fort and Moscow are a matter of public
 record.
 However, because the Communist Party
 and its sympathizers are using this cause to
 further their own aims does not necessarily
 mean that all pacifists are pro-Communist-
 as perhaps Robert Welch of the John Birch
 Society would have us believe.
 ,Here Is an official pronouncement on this
 point:
 "There is an unfortunate tendency to pin
 the Communist label on any radical organi-
 zation with which one may disagree.
 "The complete foolishness of this attitude
 is as dangerous and reprehensible as that
 which insists that everyone who joins a Com-
 munist front organization is necessarily sub-
 versive."
 COMMITTEE STATEMENT.
 That statement is from the most recent
 report of the Senate Factflnding Committee
 on Un-American Activities of the California
 Legislature.
 Not all of my investigation of the ultra-
 left was carried on in coffee houses and pri-
 vate homes.  Some of it was hard, dull work
 documenting the movement from a hundred
 different written sources.
 But the task was rewarded with the un-
 covering of gems like this in research from
 the House of Representatives report on Viet-
 nam protests:             k
 "While most individuals who have taken
 part in demonstrations of this type were not
 directly influenced by the Communist Party,
 the 'Communists have endorsed and sup-
 ported any group which organizes such a
 demonstration.
 "This policy was established (at a meeting
 of the top Communist Party leaders in June
 1964,  the month DuBois Club was born)
 when Jack Stachel, member of the party's
 national committee, proposed the formation
 of a united front of Communists, other leftist
 groups, trade  unions, peace organizations,
 Negro organizations, and churches to pro-
 mote a campaign in opposition to U.S. policy
 in southeast Asia."
 The quote is from Representative H. ALLEN
 SMITH  of California before the House last
 May 3.
 26509
 COMMUNIST LINE
 He went on to cite DuBois Club participa-
 tion in the demonstrations "following the
 Communist Party U.S.A. line on Vietnam just
 as it has paralleled Communist policy since
 its founding."
 Dorothy Healey, southern California Dis-
 trict Chairman for the Communist Party,
 and  Gus Hall,  national  spokesman,  also
 pressed for action on the Vietnam protest.
 This article started in Helsinki and now is
 leading back there again.
 The previous peace festival in Helsinki
 was attended by, among others, a core of
 leaders who met to organize the DuBois clubs
 last year.  They were the Hallinan brothers,
 Michael and Terence, sons of Communist-
 linked  attorney  Vincent Hallinan of                                                                                                                                           San
 Francisco;   Mike  Myerson,  DuBois  Club
 leader and Vietnam writer;   and Kenneth
 Cloke, from the Bay Area, also a DuBois pub-
 lication writer. '
 ACTIVISTS  JUMP To  CAPITALIZE  ON  WATTS
 RIOT
 (EDITOR'S        NoTE.-Jerry LeBlanc, Evening
 Outlook staff writer, spent 2 months under-
 ground as a member of the extreme left in
 Los Angeles.  This is the ninth in a series
 of articles on who the leaders are, what they
 are trying to acomplish and how they are
 trying to do it.)
 (By Jerry LeBlanc)
 On Thursday, August 12, I witnessed a
 startling abrupt change in the whole opera-
 tion and direction of the DuBois Clubs, Con-
 gress of Unrepresented People (COUP) and
 Committee to End the War in Vietnam.
 Los Angeles was erupting in its most vio-
 lent rampage in history and, as a parttime
 corerspondent for -a foreign wire service, I
 plunged into coverage of the riot scene at
 Watts.
 I had completely forgotten for a brief few
 hours that my principal reporting job was
 an inside story on the organization of the
 extreme left for the Evening Outlook, a job
 which required joining these organizations.
 But when I returned to my home that
 night, the phone rang and I was immediately
 recalled to my primary job.
 it was Ann Smith of Burbank, a pacifist
 and member of the Committee to End the
 War in Vietnam.  She often did telephone
 contact work.
 CAN YOU PICKET?
 Excitedly she told me, "We've called an
 emergency meeting and we're going to set
 up picket lines right away. Can you make
 it?"
 "Picket lines?" I asked.
 "We're  picketing  Chief  (W. H.)  Parker
 on the police brutality issue in Watts," she
 said.
 I said, "I don't get it.  What's Watts got
 to do with the Vietnam protest commit-
 tee?"
 "You know,". she replied, "it's all the same
 thing."
 NEWSMAN BECOMES ANGRY
 I said I'd try to make it.  She gave me an
 address and I jotted it down.  But I was
 personally angry at the idea of anyone try-
 ing to take political advantage of the Watts
 upheaval I had just witnessed.
 From' that moment on, at DuBois or Viet-
 nam  committee  meetings,  I                                                                                                                                        never   heard
 Vietnam mentioned again.
 With reluctance I joined the picket lines
 at  the  police  station in  downtown  Los
 Angeles.
 "Chief Parker       Must Go," "End  Police
 Brutality," the signs read.  Some of the signs
 had been hastily painted on the back of used
 "Get Out of Vietnam" posters.
 Although I was surprised at the time, I can
 understand the connection between Watts
 and Vietnam.  I recall the dozens of inci-
 dents I saw that show much of the "enemy"

 as are the extreme left's belief that the police
 of America are as those who establish our
 Asian foreign policy.
 THEY  HATE  SYMBOL
 These people are not particularly against
 the men and women who wear the police
 uniforms, but the uniform itself is a symbol
 Of authority in the United States, and they
 hate it.
 From the very  first  contact  with  the
 Du]3ois Club in Venice I recall the police
 brutality  poster prominently  displayed.
 There were identical posters in the office of
 the national DuBois in San Francisco, and
 in the Student Non-Violent Coordinating
 Committee (NVAC) office in Hollywood.
 PAMPHLETS PUBLISHED
 Picketing isn't all we did.
 The scene shifts  to the  Venice DuBois
 headquarters, where their mimeograph ma-
 chine immediately began spouting pamphlets
 making It clear that the extreme left is on
 the side of the Negro.
 The pamphlets were the customary fact-
 starved, slanted appeals aimed more at mak-
 ing friends among the Negroes than at help-
 ing them.
 Before the fires stopped smouldering, the
 extreme left crews were in action in the riot
 area trying to help, to blame and to organize.
 John Haag, area DuBois chairman, directed
 members to channel funds for freeing jailed
 rioting suspects through the swiftly created

 print.
 That kind of action by one police officer
 is seized upon and turned to the advantage
 of the extreme left.
 POLICE  DOWNGRADED
 In their rough work, police everywhere are
 being likened to the "villian-cops" of the
 South, who are cast as "heavies" because they
 enforce unpopular and sometimes, it's been
 proven, unconstitutional laws.
 There was a vague comprehension in the
 extreme left before the Watts riots of some
 kind of potential for agitation against the
 police.
 One night a month before the outbreak-
 on July 15-the subject came up while I
 was at the home of Jimmy Garrett, a Negro
 field man for the Student Nonviolent Co-
 ordinating Committee and an organizer of
 the Congress of Unrepresented People.
 I noted at the time that Garrett had a
 sarcastic "Support Your Local Police" sign
 on his door, the same as in the Venice West
 coffee house operated by Los Angeles area
 DuBois Chairman John Haag.
 CONVERSATION RECALLED
 My notes on my conversation with Gar-
 rett read as follows: "Garrett offered the sug-
 gestion that the hatred of poverty-stricken
 south and east Los Angeles residents for
 police could be the basis for a cause, i.e.,
 'Stop police murder of Negroes.' "
 But the extreme left was depressed about
 the possibilities.  For example, the day be-
 fore the riots started, Robert Hall, a member
 of the Vietnam committee, told his fellow
 members:
 "The idea of politics;.[ organizing in south
 Los Angeles is hopeless.  They'll listen to
 anybody, but then they just walk off and
 forget it."
 Hall, who is also a member of the Non-
 violent Action Committee, which is head-
 quartered in the riot zone, suggested to the
 committee  that  the  organizing  be  done
 through clubs and churches in the area.
 THEY WERE UNAWARE, TOO
 No one I know in the ranks of the extreme
 left knew in advance that that Negro up-
 rising would take place, or if they did, they
 kept it secret.
 But once the uprising was a fact, the pic-
 ture changed immediately.  I know several
 extreme left Negroes who were in the thick
 of the rioting, or said they were, starting
 Thursday.  They said they were there as ob-
 servers only, but they participated in bring-
 ing Negroes in the area to march in the
 picket line I joined in front of Chief Parker's
 headquarters.
 At an emergency meeting of the Vietnam
 Commmittee, a Negro spokesman for the Non-
 violent Action Committee told the Cauca-
 sians present, "If you don't get down there
 (to picket) right away, don't ever show your
 white faces in the Negro district again."
 location of the Committee to Protect the
 Foreign  Born,  a  cited  Communist-front
 organization.
 CRASH PROGRAM
 I was appointed to another committee to
 prepare a comprehensive booklet of some 50
 pages on the causes of the rioting and "po-
 lice abuses" before and during the rioting.
 According to our instructions, it was to be
 a crash production, modeled after the DuBois
 San Francisco booklet, "The War in Viet-
 nam," and would be distributed throughout
 Negro and white areas nationally.
 The same night we drew up and mimeo-
 graphed a questionnaire to be used in inter-
 views with Negro rioters.
 My fellow committee members were Tom
 Garrison, Marvin Treiger, Vic Oliver, Chris
 Davis, Ron Ridenour, and Robert Hall.
 We represented not only DuBois, but NVAC,
 the Vietnam protest, COUP, and I don't know
 how many other causes.
 As we planned the booklet, I winced in
 watching  a format pieced together that
 would only further arouse animosity toward
 the harassed police.
 PROPAGANDA MACHINERY
 (EDITOR's  NOTE:  Jerry LeBlanc,  Evening
 Outlook staff writer, spent 2 months under-
 ground as a member of the extreme left in
 Los Angeles.  This is the 10th article in a
 series on who the leaders are, what they
 are attempting to accomplish and how they
 are trying to do it.)
 (By Jerry LeBlanc)
 Until I talked to the Vietnam Day Com-
 mittee in Berkeley early in August, they
 didn't even know there was a separate Viet-
 nam protest group in Los Angeles.
 They were eager to meet me.  "Let's set up
 a contact right now and keep in touch,"
 one of the Berkeley full-time staffers said.
 "Where do you meet?" he asked me.
 I was taken aback by the apparent lack
 of contact between Los Angeles and  San
 Francisco  Vietnam  protests,  having gone
 there to see if there were parallels, as seemed
 evident.
 "Up to now," said another of the four
 Berkeley full-time staffers, "our only con-
 tacts in Los Angeles have been Darrel Myers
 and Jim Gallagher.  Know them?"
 "Oh," I said.  That explained everything.
 GETS TO RIGHT PLACE
 Myers  is                     the Young  Socialist  Alliance
 chairman and Gallagher the Socialist Party
 board member on. the Los Angeles Commit-
 tee to End the War in Vietnam.
 Berkeley's protesters had been sending all
 their pamphlets and propaganda to them,
 and, of course, it got to the right places.
 This is one of a hundred similar links be-
 tween  extreme  left  organizations,  whose
 mimeograph machines day and night spew
 out each others propaganda and pamphlets.
 COLLABORATORS RECKLESS
 Sometimes the collaboration  in propa-
 ganda borders on the reckless.
 One San Francisco Vietnam protest leader
 complained to me that the Progressive Labor
 Movement had asked for his group's support
 in an upcoming event, and he told them he'd
 think about it.
 "Then, before I made up my mind, they
 went ahead and printed everything with our
 name on it," he said.
 When the Vietnam committee in Los An-
 geles was organizing the local congress of
 unrepresented  people  (COUP)  we  were
 thrashing about for a name.
 I stood and spoke out, "How about 'the
 committee for a new government?'',
 MORE SUBTLE TITLE
 A cheer, approving laughter and applause
 swept the gathering at Mount Hollywood
 Church.
 But something more appropriate finally
 appeared on the handbills: "COUP."
 The initials of my proposed name for the
 conlrnittee would work out as CNG, which is
 meaningless.  The meaning of COUP is about
 as subtle as a hammer.
 COUP literature was printed and circulated
 by the Socialist Labor Party, DuBois, and
 other groups.
 In San Francisco, DuBois mimeographed
 handbills promoting the August 7 rally of
 the congress of unrepresented people in Union
 Square  with the Vietnam Day Committee
 supplying the speakers.
 DuBois' tieup with the Vietnam issue in
 the San Francisco Bay area also is evident in
 the  distribution  of  the  Michael  Myerson
 pamphlet, "The U.S. War in Vietnam."
 VIET ISSUES PRESSED
 In Los Angeles and San Francisco areas
 alike, one-sided questionnaires on the Viet-
 nam issue are being carried around door to
 door, in the former by DuBois Clubs, and in
 the latter by the Vietnam protesters.
 Jimmy Garrett of the Student Nonviolent
 Coordinating Committee, speaking at a rally
 led by the Socialist Workers Party, pointed
 out that the Vietnam questionnaires were
 slanted, calculated to find people who might
 join the cause.  Such people then are asked
 to sponsor neighborhood coffee discussions
 on the ills of the Vietnam situation.
 The questionnaire is an obvious recruiting
 device.  Propaganda is a fertile tool in the
 left's war of ideas.   The principle of free
 speech, however, works both ways.
 Take, for example, a Vietnam protest rally
 I attended the afternoon of July 31 at the
 Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles.
 HANNON SPEAKS
 When I arrived, an antipicket picket line
 of American Nazis was storming back and
 forth, chanting, "Reds must go."
 As soon as the television cameramen lost
 interest in them, the Nazis packed up and
 left.
 All the "in group" extreme left was in at-
 tendance, I noted, and we were using for
 the most part the same picket signs we used
 at the Hollywood Palladium earlier in the
 month,
 When suspended Police Officer Mike Han-
 non stepped to the microphone as the main
 speaker, he won my admiration for sheer
 guts.
 Hannon, suspended for his  Congress  of
 Racial Equality activities, knew he was ad-
 dressing a crowd of militant leftists.
 "I don't think the United States has any
 legitimate business in Vietnam and we are
 supporting a government there that is not
 the government; of the people," he started
 out.
 Then, as an expectant hush fell on the
 audience, he said: "But Ho Chi Minh's gov-
 ernment would be no improvement.   And
 under his type of government, people like
 you and me wouldn't get a chance to speak
 out like this.   Troublemakers like me are
 taken off ,omewhere and shot."

 THREE APPLAUD         "
 A decided coolness settled on the bright
 afternoon crowd at this lack of endorsement
 for a glorious Red leader. In the pause, three
 people applauded briefly: a woman with the
 Strike for Peace, a curious young male passer-
 by who had stopped, and a man I suspected
 as a police. infiltrator.
 Hannon had made a good point.
 The writers of the radical causes, perhaps
 leaning too far to correct what they consider
 to be false pictures painted In the rightist
 press, generally are guilty of one-sidedness
 and omissions in their own reports.
 CLOKE'S VERSION
 Witness this lovely picture of the World
 Youth Festival for Peace and Friendship, as
 told by Kenneth Cloke, of Berkeley, in the
 DuBois magazine, Insurgent:
 "For 10 days Israelis will hug Egyptians,
 South Africans will dance with the Dutch,
 Englishmen will kiss their Irish brothers,"
 The truth is that the Arabs threatened to
 boycott the scene if their Israeli brothers
 poked one Jewish nose into the affair.  The
 whole peace festival was canceled abruptly
 when Ben Bella was overthrown and all the
 Reds went into hiding.
 I personally saw one effect of propaganda
 when interviewing rioters at Lincoln Heights
 Jail for News Limited of Australia.
 Halting a Negro just freed on bail, I in-
 troduced myself and asked for his view of
 the riot story.
 "It was a frame-up man," he told me, and
 went on to described in monosyllabic, clear-
 cut language how the cops got the goods
 on him.
 But in  this genuine  flow of words he
 dropped phrases like "police brutality," "eco-
 nomically                                 deprived,"  and  others,  which
 struck a note of unnatural expression.
 These are the terms harped on in hundreds
 of leftist circulars and by repetition have
 become part of the idiom. It is not a far
 stretch of the imagination to envision "U.S.
 ,imperialists" becoming a  common phrase.
 Skilled propagandists are at work in many
 phases of the extreme left movement.  They
 quote Asian Red newspapers for an inside
 view of what really is happening in Vietnam,
 and seemingly exposing secrets of a hush-
 hush massacre, neglect to point out that an
 American verion of the same atrocities is
 available in American newspapers.
 Which version is true?  I never met an
 American reporter who wouldn't break his
 neck to uncover a scandal such as-a massacre
 of villagers would create In this country's
 government circles.
 I can't say if the official Communist press
 In other countries is a stickler for accuracy.
 But, a British expert in oriental affairs
 reports in Time magazine, July 16, "Hanoi's
 three dailies take up great swatches of space
 reporting U.S. teach-ins and predicting the
 ultimate rejection of the war by the Ameri-
 can people."
 So the Vietnam protest propaganda is hav-
 ing Its effects on both sides of the ocean.
 PEACE  LEADERS  SET  NATIONWIDE  EXPLOSION
 DATE
 (EDITOR'S                       NOTE.-Jerry LeBlanc, Evening
 Outlook staff writer, spent 2 months under-
 ground as a member of the extreme left in
 Los Angeles.                    This is the 11th in a series of
 articles on who the leaders are, what they
 are attempting to accomplish and how they
 are trying to do it.)
 (By Jerry LeBlanc)
 The peace movement has declared war.
 If the extreme left has Its way, the Viet-
 cong will gain a big victory 2 weeks from now
 not in the jungles of South Vietnam, but on
 a "front" here at home.
 During my 2 months as an undercover re-
 porter inside the organizations of the extreme
 left, I learned a lot about what can be ex-
 pected.
 "The next step for us must be massive civil
 disobedience," urges the Berkeley Vietnam
 Day Committee in literature distributed In
 Los Angeles and elsewhere.
 Organizing a nationwide "militant direct
 action"  for  October  15-16,  the  Berkeley
 spokesmen trumpeted that "Our massive
 civil disobedience aimed at blocking the U.S.
 war machine will send shock waves from
 Maine to California, and from the United
 States to all parts of the world."
 PROTEST AGENDA OUTLINED
 "For example," suggests Berkeley's com-
 mittee, "we might consider en masse break-
 ing of the Espionage Act of 1917 and the
 Selective Service Act."
 Also on the agenda for the protest is a
 massive demonstration at the Oakland Army
 Terminal in an effort to tie up shipment of
 equipment to Vietnam.
 I "unjoined" myself from the extreme left
 early in September, but I've heard  since
 through the grapevine that President John-
 son will get the "picket treatment" person-
 ally if he visits the west coast as scheduled
 the same weekend.
 The idea is to carry the Vietnam protest
 to the doorway of the Beverly Hilton Hotel,
 where plans calls for him to speak October
 15, and to his San Francisco hotel the next
 day.
 (Subsequent to the writing of this article,
 President Johnson announced he would be
 operated on to remove his gall bladder, forc-
 ing the cancellation of his plan to came to
 the west coast.)
 These bold proposals are being voiced by
 an organization which 6 months ago existed
 only in the minds of some civil rights and
 Berkeley free speech movement activists.
 I first learned of the October 15-16 plans
 in August from Rick Wolff, of New Haven,
 Conn., then a newly appointed national co-
 ordinator for the protest movement,
 He met me on the roof of Dykstra Hall, a
 UCLA campus dormitory.  He said he was
 from out of town and had picked up my
 name as a contact man for the Congress of
 Unrepresented People (COUP)  in which I
 was active.
 "I can't stress enough the importance of
 the October 15-16 protests," he said.  "This
 can be the turning point In our development
 as a political force."
 "Are you from the  Berkeley unit?" I
 asked.
 REVEALS BACKGROUND
 He said he was a Yale graduate student
 and he and another man had been appointed
 at the COUP rally in Washington to coordi-
 nate the Vietnam protest nationally.
 "We've been going from city to city across
 the country stressing the need for concerted
 action," Wolff told me.
 I remembered that  the Communist-line
 newspaper Peoples World had reported the
 formation of a coordinating unit, upon the
 suggestion of the Berkeley leaders.
 Pledging my full cooperation, I obtained
 from him the necessary facts to set up a con-
 nection with the temporary headquarters in
 Madison, Wis.
 Frank Emspak Is the man to contact there,
 he told me.
 NAMES MENTIONED
 Wolff asked me if I knew about Jim Ber-
 hand, UCLA free speech movement activist
 and West Los Angeles DuBois member.  I
 told him I knew who he was.  Wolff said he
 had Berland's name and that of Lucy Cloyd,
 also of West Los Angeles DuBois, and Bob
 Niemann, of the UCLA Vietnam Committee.
 It would have been difficult to pursue the
 name game with Wolff much longer.
 I didn't want to tell him that I delib-
 erately steered clear of the campus Vietnam
 activists because of my past assignments as
 an Evening Outlook reporter.
 I had covered the free speech movement
 developments there during and after the
 26511
 Berkeley crisis and had interviewed student
 leaders-some of whom, I suspected, I might
 run into as a Vietnam protestor.
 That might have led to recognition and
 embarrassing questions and a lot of explain-
 ing, and I didn't want to have to do that
 if I could avoid it.
 The Vietnam Protest Committee and, allied
 organizations are gathering momentum with
 astounding speed and rapidly expanding their
 physical facilities.
 The Berkeley Vietnam Committee, which
 formally organized last May after a campus
 speak-in, now has a fully staffed office at
 2407 Fulton Street.
 In Los Angeles, the Vietnam Committee
 meets  regularly  at  the  Mount  Hollywood
 Church, 4601 Prospect Avenue.
 DuBois, which opened its  Venice head-
 quarters at 5 Dudley Avenue only last July,
 opened a central Los Angeles office at 1733
 Temple Street, September 14.
 JOINT HEADQUARTERS
 Students for a Democratic Society late in
 July announced plans to open a Los Angeles
 office and offered to join the Congress of
 Unrepresented People in a. general "move-
 ment" headquarters.
 And there's a fully-staffed Marxist school
 now operating in Los Angeles.
 I found out about this development after
 the Federal Building rally in downtown Los
 Angeles July 31.  We proceeded from there
 to 1853 South Arlington Avenue for a "paint-
 ing party."
 COURSES DESCRIBED
 On the second floor, we slapped some dozen
 rooms with a coat of paint in preparation for
 opening of the New Left School.
 It offers to the public courses in Marxism,
 "imperialism" and the strategy for opposing
 it internationally, American Negro history,
 and labor, among other fields.
 Most of the organizers of the New Left
 School already have been mentioned in this
 series:
 Darrell Meyers, of the Young Socialist Alli-
 ance, John Haag of DuBois, Jimmy Garrett
 of the  Student Non-Violent  Coordinating
 Committee, Don Smith of the Congress of
 Racial Equality, Hugh Manes of the Ameri-
 can Civil Liberties Union, Margaret Thorpe
 of the Students for a Democratic Society,
 James Gallagher of the Socialist Party, and
 Dorothy Healey, Southern California Com-
 munist Party chairman.
 Writers John Howard Lawson and Harvard
 Wheeler also are among the 17 listed "asso-
 ciates" of the New Left School, but the only
 other organizations represented are the Cen-
 ter for the Study of Democratic Institutions,
 and Unitarians.
 The instructors will include Marvin Trei-
 ger, who was on the DuBois committee with
 me preparing a slanted antipolice booklet
 on the Watts riots.
 He also was chairman of the Youth for
 Peace and Socialism and has spoken at UCLA
 in that capacity.  A Marvin Trelger was 1
 of 98 arrested in the rights demonstration
 at the Federal Building in Los Angeles last
 March.
 Paul Perlin, another instructor, has been
 active in the Young Communist League and
 Communist-front activities since the 1930's.
 Others Include "Failsafe" author Wheeler,
 Dorothy  Healey,  Socialist  Workers  Party
 Chairman  Theodore  Edwards,     and    Don
 Wheeldin, Pasadena CORE chairman.
 POLITICAL INVASION
 Meanwhile, on the political front, forma-
 tion of a new party, with the respectability
 of the civil rights cause and the fire of the
 peace  movement is  being pressed  in Los
 Angeles.
 Stepped up ultra-left activity on all fronts
 is In the offing, particularly in the police
 brutality issue in the aftermath of the Watts
 violence, and in the Vietnam issue due to the
 escalating pace of the war.

 26512                     CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE          October 19, 1965
 Vietnam Is perhaps the key issue, since the
 war there is considered a test of whether
 U.B.  counterinsurgency  tactics  can  force
 "people's revolutions" to the negotiations
 table.
 PRESSES POINT
 I heard Carl Bloice of the DuBois national
 office press the urgency of the point.
 "There are other people's revolutions in
 the offing," he said  alter returning from
 Helsinki and Moscow this summer.
 Bloice's statement was recalled to my mind
 by this one from the Berkeley plans for
 October 15-16:
 "Vietnam, like Mississippi, is not an aber-
 ration--it is a mirror of America.  Vietnam
 is American foreign policy; it Is only that
 in Peru, Bolivia, and South Africa the rev-
 olutionary movement has not yet progressed
 to the point where napalm and marines are
 necessary."
 Bloice brought the following piece of news
 from the Comunist World to a select DuBois
 gathering, including myself and my wife, one
 night recently:
 "I can promise you this,  There is going
 to be a revolution in South Africa.  I can't
 say exactly when, but it will be before next
 July 4"
 VIETNAM ISSUE IS TEST CASE FOR REVOLUTION
 (Earroa's NoTE.--,Jerry LeBlanc, Evening
 Outlook staff writer, spent 2 months under-
 gound as a member, of the extreme left In
 Los Angeles.  This is the 12th and final arti-
 cle in a series on who the leaders are, what
 they are attempting to accomplish and how
 they are trying to do it.)
 (By Jerry LeBlanc)
 Early In September I withdrew abruptly
 from my activities in the DuBois Club, the
 Committee to End the War in Vietnam, and
 the Congress of Unrepresented People.
 A coworker on my DuBois committee to
 prepare a Watts riot brochure carne to my
 door and I just handed over my files to him.
 I told him I had to drop the project and
 be reacted with surprise, but I explained:
 "I know it's sudden but I've taken on a job
 writing a series of articles, and it's going to
 take all my time for the next few weeks.
 It's an impossible conflict."
 SO Instead Of a Marxist-slanted riot book-
 let, I sat down and wrote this series.
 If any of my revolutionary acquaintances
 would new like to punch me in the nose, I
 urge him to remember the peace movement.
 "I'M NOBODY'S ENEMY"
 I am nobody's enemy, only a reporter.  I
 wrote of what I saw and participated in.
 Those still unable to restrain their aggres-
 sion toward me should make an appointment
 with the switchboard operator.  She can fight
 better than I can.
 Looking back over this series, browsing
 through more than 50 pages of notes, hun-
 dreds of leaflets and brochures that the ex-
 treme left put out, and stacks of other source
 materials, I reflected on my brief 2-month
 stand with the revolutionaries.
 Early in my undercover assignment, an
 attractive brunette said to me, "Isn't it great
 how this peace Issue is bringing every Social-
 ist in town out of the woodwork?"
 ALLIANCE UNDENIABLE
 "'Yeah," I replied, "there seems to be a lot
 of  different  interests all getting out and
 working together on the same thing."
 The fact of an alliance of the pacifists,
 the militant civil rights workers, the campus
 rebels, and the variegated Socialist groupings
 has been amply indicated. in this series.
 An I have stated, I never knowngly met a
 Communist Party card-carrier, but that's old
 hat anyway.  The new left snickers at the
 Idea..
 Steve Roberts, 67, a member of the "old"
 left for years and onetime Socialist Work-
 ere Party candidate for Governor of Cali-
 fornia, still keeps up with the modern-day
 leftists, showing up at all their major func-
 tions.
 "You young people," he told one gather-
 ing, with a paternal smile, "you have really
 got the spirit.  My generation tried its best
 and now we are just sort of sitting back
 and watching, but you youngsters have really
 got something going."
 Roberts also was prominent In the Fair
 Play for Cuba Committee, the biggest leftist
 concentration preceding the Vietnam protest.
 One of that organization's national spon-
 sors, by the way, was the late Dr. W. E. B.
 DuBois, for whom the DuBois clubs were
 named.
 A new  type of revolutionary may be
 emerging In organizations such as the Du-
 Bois and Vietnam committees, my obser-
 vations indicate.
 The new extreme left organizations across
 In the wake of the McCarran-Smith Acts,
 which ban the Communist Party as a sub-
 versive organization dedicated to the violent
 Overthrow of the Government.
 Today's revolutionaries  openly vow  the
 overthrow of the Government, but through
 political action which aims  to  bring the
 Socialist movement into power.
 This tactic would seem to be the only
 practical approach for carrying out such
 an aim In this country.
 In smaller, undeveloped nations,  where
 one major city dominates, a student riot,
 for instance, can lead to the seizure of radio
 stations and swift declaration of a coup.
 In the United States there are just too
 many cities.
 HAAG  VIEW REVEALED
 Talking with John Haag, Los Angeles area
 DuBois chairman at his Venice coffehouse
 one night shortly after the Watts riots, I
 pointed out, "The Negroes literally took over
 a 50-square-mile section of the city before
 the National Guard got here.
 "Suppose," I suggested, "a core of 1,000 or
 1,500 trained guerillas or rebels, or whatever
 you'd call them, moved In and took com-
 mand.  They could have seized the radio
 and television stations, the police would be
 outnumbered, and the rebels would have
 control of the city."
 "Then what would you do?" said Haag.
 "You'd just have Los Angeles-until the Na-
 tional Guard moved in"
 He smiled.  The Possibility of simultane-
 ous revolts in all of the major cities could
 not be taken seriously.
 But then, from what I saw, no one, not
 even the Socialists, expected Watts to revolt
 either.
 I do believe there is abundant evidence
 that the old-school Communists enjoy and
 take advantage of the strife caused by the
 civil. rights youth and peace movements.
 As for Vietnam, and why the extreme left
 is able to build a growing protest around the
 situation, even the Communist party Iilfer
 I have quoted admits this is a new type of
 war, "a test case" for the future of "people's
 revolutions."
 Ignorance of the facts in the war and nat-
 ural sympathy with the underdog may be
 taken advantage of.
 Perhaps the Federal Government is ex-
 periencing a breakdown in communications
 with a segment of the people who do not
 find the current war has been justified to
 them, because the people of the extreme left
 I met generally are sincere in this belief.
 LACK OF COMMUNICATIONS
 Similarly, I heard that lack of commu-
 nication between local law enforcement di-
 rectors and a segment of the people has been
 suggested as P. probable contributing factor
 in the Los Angeles riots, which have been
 described as a protest,
 I can understand that the tactic of using
 political muscle  to upset  the  capitalist
 power structure is perfectly legitimate in
 this democracy. But I have cited the grow-
 ing trend to use civil disobedience as a tool
 to overthrow conditions which are believed to
 be wrong, a move which tends to undermine
 confidence in all authority and particularly
 in the representatives of the law.
 This seems to be the heart of the new
 revolution, when these self appointed minor-
 ities proclaim, as they have, that their cause
 is so right it exceeds the law itself, and tears
 down  the  whole  system  as  the  enemy,
 rather than trying to correct things through
 the legal process provided in a society which
 the majority decree.
 The results always resemble riots, It seems,
 whethAr they occur in Dixie, Berkeley or Los
 Angeles.
 At all the meetings and diverse functions
 I attended, despite all the talk about the
 bleeding Vietnamese people, no one ever took
 up a collection to send material aid to the
 people there.  No one organized a food or
 clothing drive, or suggested an orphanage.
 The 250 people who joined in on one Pal-
 ladium picket line in July for 5 hours put
 in a total of roughly 1,250 hours of hard
 walking.  I remember figuring as I walked
 that  this  represents  156  working  days,
 enough effort to make a major contribution
 to the cause of relieving misery, frustration,
 and Ignorance among humans.
 The picketers couldn't all go to Vietnam
 with the Red Cross, but they could have gone
 to Watts.
 And with that little bit of philosophy, I'll
 sign off.
 AMERICAN ART EXHIBITION TRAV-
 ELS TO JAPAN-A PERSON-TO-
 PERSON CULTURAL EXCHANGE
 (Mr. MAT.LLIARD (at the request of
 Mr. HALL) was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. MAIL.LIARD.  Mr. Speaker, cul-
 tural exchange programs are an impor-
 tant part of America's effort to favorably
 project its image to the peoples of the
 world.  All too often, it is the large, pub-
 Ile-supported program that receives the
 greatest amount of publicity and support.
 Yet the action of a few individuals may
 do as much to foster good will and un-
 derstanding.  I would like my colleagues
 to know of a forthcoming cultural event
 which will be the result of a person-to-
 person cultural exchange program.
 On October 22, an exhibition of Ameri-
 can art sponsored by Dr. Frits A. Win-
 blad, of San Francisco's Winblad Gal-
 leries, will open in Tokyo, Japan, at the
 IchibankanGalleries. This event is most
 significant because it represents the first
 time in art history that a gallery-to-gal-
 lery showing has traveled from this
 country to Japan.  The work of 30 con-
 temporary                                                                                                           American   artists   from
 throughout the United States will be dis-
 played.
 This exhibition will be the culmination
 of several years of effort by the popular
 Japanese artist, Takohito Mikami.   Mr.
 Mikami came to San Francisco in 1957
 under State Department auspices. Since
 that time, he has taught at the Presidio
 at Monterey, Calif., and his art; classes at
 both Stanford and the University of Cali-
 fornia were very well-received.  He has
 taught art nationwide on television under
 the aegis of the National Educational
 Television Network.  And his accom-
 plishments as an artist are well known;

 STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS MUST
 NOT BE MISINTERPRETED
 (Mr. BOGGS asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute, and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. BOGGS.  Mr. Speaker, press re-
 ports today indicate that the radio and
 other forms of propaganda. communica-
 tion in the Communist world have given
 a great deal of publicity to the so-called
 student demonstrations held in this
 country during the past several. days.
 I am cel:tain that I speak for all Amer-
 icans when I say that Moscow, Peiping,
 and Hanoi will have badly misread the
 determination of the American people if
 they give any significance to these so-
 called demonstrations.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE          October 19, 1965
 The Congress of the United States, as
 represented by both political parties, has
 affirmed time and time again the dedi-
 cation of the American people to live up
 to the commitments which we have in
 southeast Asia.  Let there be no doubt
 about that. These demonstrations have
 been infiltrated by the Communists, but
 they will have no success whatsoever.
 They represent a tiny but vocal minority.
 The President of the United States is
 pursuing a policy which has the support
 of the overwhelming majority of the
 American people.  I think it well that
 the Communist world understand that
 we shall not retire from Vietnam or
 anywhere else in the world as long as
 the commitments that they have made
 there as elsewhere are not honored.
 We intend to keep our word-we do not
 intend to bow to Communist pressure or
 Communist propaganda.
 Mr. GERALD R. FORI). Mr. Speaker,
 will the gentleman from Louisiana yield?
 .Mr. BOGGS. I yield to the gentleman
 from Michigan. .
 Mr. GERALD R. FORD. Over the past
 weekend, on several occasions, I, as a
 strations. My reply has been that those
 who acted irresponsibly by the burning of
 draft cards and violent language have
 acted in a shameful and disgusting man-
 ner. They have been doing a great in-
 justice to those who are fighting in Viet-
 nam and those who are trying to be sure
 and certain that Communist aggression
 does not pay off.
 I wish to assure the gentleman from
 Louisiana and the President that as long
 as our policy is one of firmness in South
 Vietnam or elsewhere throughout the
 world, we on this side of the aisle will
 stand forthrightly in opposition to the
 Kremlin and to Peiping.
 Mr. BOGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
 tgentleman for his very fine statement.
 V    STATEMENT OF ONE SERVING IN
 VIETNAM
 (Mr. HOLLAND asked and was given
 permission to address ' the House for 1
 minute.)
 Mr.  HOLLAND.     Mr.  Speaker,  I
 should like to read a letter I received
 from a young man who is serving in
 Vietnam.
 BIEN HOA AIR FORCE BASE,
 September 16; 1965.
 Hon. ELMER S. HOLLAND,
 House of Representatives,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR Sin: My travels upon graduating from
 the Academy last year have carried me from
 Fort Benning to Hawaii to Vietnam.  I'm
 now serving with a helicopter company at
 Bien Hoa.   I have a platoon of volunteer
 "shot gunners" from the 25th Infantry Di-
 vision in Hawaii.  We ride as door gunners
 on the helicopters during assaults.  We are
 all well equipped, well clothed, and well fed
 here.  Our company just received the latest
 UH-1D helicopters made by Bell.    They are
 faster and more powerful than our old ones.
 We work 7 days a. week, with our people
 flying every day.  It's pretty much the same
 all over, but some people don't have the ad-
 vantage of hot meals and a dry place to
 sleep that we enjoy hefe at the air base.  We
 a tough life, but no one complains.    People
 do feel disappointed though when we read
 in the papers about students trying to stop
 troop trains and people rushing to get mar-
 ried to avoid the draft.
 It seems as though our strategy.is work- .
 ing and we've turned the tide, but there is
 still much to be done.  The biggest mistake
 we could make now is to stop bombing North
 Vietnam.    We learned in Korea that ne-
 gotiations' can last for years if you let up
 the pressure when you go to the conference
 table.  The American troops here are doing
 real well.  There is a growing impatience
 with the armed Republic of Vietnam lack of
 competence  and  initiative.   It's  a shame
 Americans have to do all the dirty work, but
 then these people have been fighting for
 many years and probably don't realize the
 gravity of the situation.
 The pay raise was thoroughly appreciated
 by all.  I know it helped me a lot.  I got
 married in August.  My wife's parents are
 stationed at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii.
 I enjoy my work as an officer In the Army
 and wish to thank you-again for providing
 serving here now and I run into them oc-
 casionally at the most -improbable places.
 espectfully yours,
 THOMAS G. FAULDS,
 2d Lieutenant, U.S. Army.
 STUD,NT DEMONSTRATIONS
 (Mr. DENT asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. ALBERT.  Mr. Speaker, the gen-
 tleman yield?
 Mr. DENT.  I yield to the majority
 leader.
 Mr. ALBERT.  I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 Mr. Speaker, I take this time to say
 I am very happy that the distinguished
 Democratic whip and the distinguished
 Republican leader have expressed what
 I believe is not only the sentiment of
 the leadership but, I am sure, the senti-
 ment of this House with respect to the
 military and political situation in Viet-
 nam and also with respect to the mis-
 guided, if not, in the case of some par-
 ticipants in teach-ins and other demon-
 strations, subversive acts which almost
 amount to treason.
 I believe the country and the world
 should know that not only the leader-
 ship but also the Congress is united in
 supporting the President' and the action
 he has taken and in announcing to the
 world that these recent demonstrations
 reflect only a minute sampling of sen-
 timent within the ranks of a very small
 minority of Our people and particularly
 of our young people.  Let friend and
 foe alike know that our people are united
 in their patriotism and in support of the
 strong policies of the President.
 Mr. GERALD R. FORD.  Mr. Speak-
 er, will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. DENT.  I am glad to yield to the
 minority leader.
 Mr. GERALD R. FORD.  I believe it
 is very important to reaffirm what the
 gentleman from Oklahoma has said.
 These demonstrators do represent a very,
 very small percentage of the students
 and the youth of- this country. It would
 be a serious mistake on the part of the
 enemy to believe that these demonstra-
 tors represent a substantial part to any
 degree of the youth of America.
 If the enemy should make a, miscal-
 culation, In the belief . that there was
 a division or a lack of unity in our op-
 position to Communist aggression it
 would be a serious error for them.  We
 should warn the young people of the
 'serious consequences, if their demon-
 strations and their irresponsible actions
 do lead to a miscalculation on the part of
 the Communist, whether in the Kremlin
 or Peiping.
 Mr. ALBERT. I thank the gentleman.
 I certainly agree.
 Mr. DENT.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to
 concur in the remarks made by both
 the minority and majority leaders.

 Mr. DORN.                            Mr. Speaker, I want to
 join my distinguished colleagues, the
 majority leader, Mr. ALBERT, the whip,
 Mr. BOGGS, and Mr. GERALD R. FORD, the
 minority leader, in the statements they
 made to the House with reference to the
 demonstrations, teach-ins,  and draft
 card burnings in the United States.  I
 think there is a very definite connection
 between these demonstrations and the
 worldwide Communist conspiracy.
 HOUSE SHOULD INVESTIGATE "PEACE
 DEMONSTRATIONS"
 Mr. Speaker, the present wave of
 teach-ins,                                                                    draft card burnings,  and
 demonstrations against our policy in
 Vietnam are designed to directly aid the
 military  aggression  of  Peiping                                                                   and
 Hanoi. These demonstrations are care-
 fully timed with the ending of the mon-
 soon season when the Communist ag-
 gressor in South Vietnam will be faced
 with  increasing  American                                                                     military
 pressure.
 . Mr. Speaker, we are winning in South
 Vietnam.  We prevented a Communist
 takeover - in Santo Domingo, we are
 winning the economic war, we are gain-
 ing in space, and the Communists out
 of desperation are instigating worldwide
 demonstrations.  These demonstrations
 are a dangerous and sinister part of the
 Communist war against civilization.
 . Yesterday official newspaper mouth-
 pieces of Moscow and Peiping praised
 the demonstrators in the United States
 and  again  lambasted  our  Vietnam
 policy.  North. Vietnam in its official
 newspaper at Hanoi paid tribute to the
 American demonstrators and referred to
 our policyrnakers here in Washington
 as "bloodthirsty."
 Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about
 it.  These teach-ins, - peace demonstra-
 tions and draft card burnings are sup-
 ported by Kosygin, Mao Tse-tung, and
 Ho Chi Minh. It is a diabolical scheme
 to undermine the morale - of our men
 ,on the fighting front and dupe innocent
 people In. the United States.

 October Y9,Afpb?ved For Re1Ma2    A?%flJ-ffA  00J48RTp300140005-9
 Mr. Speaker, I am today introducing
 a House, resolution which would provide
 for a complete investigation of the con-
 nection between teach-ins, peace dem-
 onstrations, draft card burnings, and the
 Communist world conspiracy. This res-
 olution would create a select committee
 of 13 Members of this House to thor-
 oughly investigate these demonstrations
 and related activities and report to the
 Congress and to the people of this coun-
 try for remedial action.
 Mr. DICKINSON.  Mr. Speaker, there
 has been of late a great deal of concern
 evidenced here about students and other
 demonstrators who in order to protest
 U.S. Involvement in Vietnam lie in front
 of trains, disrupt communications and
 so forth.  Recent newspaper headlines
 proclaimed what apparently was a great
 victory when the FBI arrested one such
 demonstrator for burning his draft card.
 Were it up to me, Mr. Speaker, I would
 instead call to the attention of the Mem-
 bers of the House another article that
 was carried by UPI on October 14 where-
 in it was stated that a soldier in the U.S.
 Army had gone on a hunger strike to
 protest being sent to Vietnam, was sub-
 sequently charged with neglect of duty,
 tried, convicted and sentenced to prison.
 Yet, a U.S. Army commanding general
 went behind the court-martial, did away
 with the convicted accused's punishment
 and an official Army spokesman gave as
 the reason that "the whole idea-was to
 play it as low key as possible and avoid
 publicity." Whac he meant was that the
 Army, too is afraid of the "demonstra-
 tions" which have been influencing our
 national policies for the past few years.
 Mr. Speaker, today, with Communist-
 misled youngsters demonstrating vio-
 lently against our war with the Commu-
 nists in Vietnam, it would seem that our
 Federal authorities would do everything
 possible to maintain the morale of our
 fighting troops.
 I wonder how the men in U.S. uni-
 forms in the ambush-ridden jungles of
 South Vietnam feel about the deal made
 with Pvt. Winstel R. Belton which has
 made it possible for him to escape the
 legally imposed consequences of his de-
 spicable actions.
 Private Belton, described by UPI as
 "a former civil rights worker from Mil=
 waukee," went on a hunger strike August
 13 to 18 to avoid serving his country when
 he learned that his unit, the proud 1st
 Cavalry Division, was being shipped to
 Vietnam.  Private Belton, as I noted,
 was tried by a military court on October
 6 on charges of neglect of duty, was found
 guilty, and sentenced to 5 years' im=prisonment,  a  bad-conduct  discharge,
 and loss of pay.
 As  the inevitable                                         storm of protest
 which seeks to protect such sacrosanct
 demonstrators as Private Belton began to
 burst forth, however, it was learned that
 the Army, unknown to the court-martial,
 had made a deal with Private Belton
 promising him a sentence not to exceed
 1 year in prison, a bad-conduct discharge
 and loss of pay in return for his plea of
 guilty to the lesser charge of malinger-
 ing.
 But even this was apparently not
 enough.  Incredible as it may seem,
 shortly thereafter, 4th Army commander
 Lt. Gen. R. W. Colglazier suspended the
 entire sentence and made it possible for
 Private Belton to receive an honorable
 discharge without a blot on his record if
 only he successfully completes the re-
 maining 8 months of his tour of duty.
 The_ only punishment whatsover is to be
 to private.  How can this possibly b
 justified?
 Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the
 mothers and wives whose sons and hus-
 bands have been killed and wounded in
 Vietnam find very little solace in the fact
 that the Army was able to dispatch the
 matter of Pvt. Winstel R. Belton "in as
 low (a) key as possible and avoid pub-
 licity."  I would suggest that Private
 Belton's fellow soldiers who are serving
 their country with valor and honor in
 Vietnam find very little comfort in the
 fact that one of his lawyers feels Belton
 has taken the "first step toward rehabili-
 tation by pleading guilty."  Who wants
 to fight alongside a man who might
 turn and run?  Why endanger the brave
 Americans in Vietnam with the presence
 of a man who might decide in the face of
 enemy fire that a "surrender-in" demon-
 stration might be in order?
 I suggest, my distinguished colleagues,
 that Lieutenant Ceneral Colglazier has
 now capped his career with his actions
 in these premises.  It should be the sub-
 ject of a congressional investigation.
 As for Private Belton, possibly it would
 be in order to strike a new official award
 from the Government of the United
 States and present it to him.  It could
 be called, Mr. Speaker, the "Benedict
 Arnold Award."
 I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Speaker,
 to introduce in the RECORD the UPI re-
 port on this matter published in the Ala-
 bama Journal in Montgomery, October
 14, 1965.
 HUNGER  STRIKER  FROM  FORT  KENNING  OR-
 DERED To COMBAT DUTY IN VIET,
 SAN ANTONIO, TEx.-Pvt. Winstel it. Belton,
 26, who went on a hunger strike to keep
 from going to Vietnam, today was under
 orders to rejoin his old outfit, the 1st Cavalry
 Division,  now fighting in the Vietnamese
 central highlands.
 Belton, a former football player and civil
 rights worker from Milwaukee, was convicted
 by a court-martial October 6 on a charge of
 neglect of duty and handed a 5-year prison
 term.
 But in the pre-arranged deal, the Army
 suspended the sentence in return for a guilty
 plea by Belton.  The Army said Belton had
 implied a willingness to fulfill his duty by
 serving in Vietnam.
 Belton received no penalty except loss of
 rank from private first class to private.  He
 will be honorably discharged if he success-
 fully completes his remaining 8 months of
 his hitch, the Army said.
 Lt. Gen. R. W. Colglazier, commander of
 the 4th Army, issued the order Wednesday
 after  studying  the  prenegotiated  court
 martial sentence against Belton.
 Belton went on a hunger strike at Fort
 Kenning, Ga., last August 13-18 when the 1st
 Calvary Division shipped out to Vietnam.
 Belton,  a  studious-looking  Negro    who
 holds a bachelors degree in fine arts from
 26483
 Arizona State University, asked to be tried
 in the 4th Army District.
 At the trial, one of Belton's military law-
 yers, Capt. Joseph Caneba, Jr., said Belton
 realized he made a mistake but took "the first
 step  toward  rehabilitation  by  pleading
 guilty."
 "The whole idea of it was to play it as low
 key as possible and avoid publicity," an Army
 prosecutor  aid.  Before the negotiated plea
 was   nno   ced, the defense had questioned

 UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHO SUP-
 PORT OUR COUNTRY'S POLICY IN
 VIETNAM
 (Mr.        CEDERBERG  asked  and  was
 given permission to address the House
 for 1 minute; to revise and extend his
 remarks and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. CEDERBERG.         Mr. Speaker, I
 share the concern of others in this body
 regarding  the  demonstrations  which
 have taken place over last weekend. It
 is tragic to see some of our professors
 and young men and women who fall pray
 to an ideology that is dedicated to the
 destruction of a fundamental right that
 we have in this country, the right of
 freedom of assembly and to demonstrate.
 These misguided citizens are abusing
 this 1'ight.
 However, Mr. Speaker, it is heartening
 to find on the wire services today, on the
 UPI service, a statement to the effect
 that 500 Boston University students have
 signed their names to a resolution sup-
 porting President Johnson's policy in
 Vietnam.
 The wire states as follows:
 A resolution was circulated by leaders of
 the university's Young Democrat and Young
 Republican Clubs to counter weekend dem-
 onstrations by students against U.S. policy
 in Vietnam.
 Officials of the 2, clubs, after 4 hours of
 signature collecting, said they. hope to ob-
 tain 3,000 signatures by the end of the week.
 . Then, Mr. Speaker, there is included in
 that release the following article:
 VILLANOVA, PA.-Villanova University stu-
 dents plan to send 20,000 greeting cards to
 U.S. servicemen in Vietnam for Christmas as
 a  countermeasure  to  the  demonstrations
 against the Vietnam fighting.
 Also contained in the release is a state-
 ment as follows:
 Frank Eck, of Richmond, Va., president of
 the Student Government Association, said
 each of the 4,500 undergraduate students at
 the university will be urged to send  5
 christmas cards to the servicemen.
 The cards will be delivered by "mail call
 Vietnam," at nearby Bryn Mawr, an organi-
 zation formed about 1 week ago to "roe that
 every  serviceman  in  Vietnam  rcooives a
 greeting at Christmas."
 Mr. Speaker, I commend these student a
 who are indicating their support of their
 countries' policy which emphasizes the
 fact that the outstanding and over-
 whelming number of our young people
 support our Government in this action.
 I want to commend both the Boston
 University and the students at Villanova
 University, and other universities, for
 taking this stand.  We know that they
 are in the majority and that the mis-

 guided young people who are using this
 demonstration technique are in the mi-
 nority, but they seem to be getting the
 press.  I hope the press will give more
 attention to our dedicated students who
 are actively supporting their Govern-
 ment and appreciate the precious herit-
 age that is theirs.
 EXTENSION OF FEDERAL MEAT
 INSPECTION
 (Mr. SMITH of Iowa asked and was
 given permission to extend his remarks
 at this point in the RECORD.)
 ANALYSIS OF H.R. 11670, A BILL TO EXTEND FED-
 ERAL MEAT INSPECTION
 Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Mr. Speaker,
 following is an analysis of the adminis-
 tration's proposal to extend Federal meat
 inspection.  The bill I have promoted
 for several years covers slaughter in
 those plants large enough to be covered
 for labor-management  relations  pur-
 poses by the Taft-Hartley law.  The ad-
 ministration's bill covers most other
 establishments also unless they are sub-
 ject to adequate State inspection or the
 Secretary of Agriculture exempts them
 because their volume of operation is too
 small for inspection to be practicable or
 necessary to protect the public.  The de-
 tailed analysis follows:
 ANALYSIS OF BILL AMENDING THE MEAT IN-
 SPECTION ACT
 Section 1. The legislation authorizing Fed-
 eral meat inspection consists of provisions in
 the Department of Agriculture Appropriation
 Act of March 4, 1907, as amended.  The first
 section of the bill would designate such pro-
 visions as the Meat Inspection Act and assign
 section numbers to the presently undesig-
 nated paragraphs.
 Section 2. This section makes statutory
 findings regarding the lntei state nature of
 commerce in meat and meat food products,
 the burdening effect of intrastate commerce
 in unwholesome meat upon interstate com-
 merce in meat and the need to regulate in-
 trastate  commerce  in  order to  effectively
 regulate interstate commerce in furtherance
 of the purpose of the act.
 Section 3. This section we uld extend the
 inspection requirements of the act to the
 slaughtering of cattle, sheep, swine, or goats,
 and the preparation of the carcasses, parts
 thereof, meat or meat food products of such
 animals, for intrastate commerce.  The pres-
 ent act applies to such ope rations for pur-
 poses of interstate or foreign commerce.  The
 section also makes ante mortem inspection
 mandatory whereas it is now discretionary.
 Section 4. This section would delete lim-
 iting language to make it clear that the post
 mortem inspection provisions of the act
 apply to articles "capable of use as human
 food" rather than intended for such use and
 eliminate other restrictive terminology.
 Section 5. This section would clarify au-
 thority of the Secretary of Agriculture to
 restrict  entry  of  carcasses,  parts  thereof,
 meat, and meat food products into federally
 inspected  establishments    to  federally   in-
 spected articles moved directly from other
 federally inspected establishments or from
 other locations under conditions necessary to
 assure that the articles were federally in-
 spected and are not adulterated, and other-
 wise in compliance with the act.  Authority
 to  regulate  the  entry  of  other materials
 would also be clarified.
 Section 6. This section would clarify the
 authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to
 regulate all aspects of the labeling, marking,
 and packaging of articles specified in the bill,
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE          October .19, 1965
 to prevent the use of false or misleading la-
 bels, marks, or containers.   Controls have
 been exercised by the Secretary over such
 matters for many years and these changes
 will not have any impact on the regulated in-
 dustry.  Provision would be made for appeal
 and judicial review of disapproval of marks,
 labels, and containers comparable to that
 contained in the Poultry Products Inspection
 Act (21 U.S.C. 457) which served as a model
 for many of the provisions in this section
 of the bill.  Specific authority is vested in
 the Secretary to establish standards of iden-
 tity and fill of container not inconsistent
 with such standards as may be established
 under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
 Act and the Secretary of Agriculture and Sec-
 retary of Health, Education, and Welfare are
 to consult prior to issuance of standards
 under these acts to avoid inconsistency.
 Section 7. This section would strengthen
 the principal prohibitory section of the act
 by  (a)  including  horses, mules,  or other
 equines  and  specifically  prohibiting  the
 slaughtering of animals or preparation of
 articles, specified in the bill, except in com-
 pliance with the act; (b) prohibiting sale,
 transportation, and other specified trans-
 actions with respect to meat and other speci-
 fied articles capable of use as human food
 if they are adulterated, unfit for human food,
 or misbranded; (c) prohibiting the doing of
 acts which are intended to cause or have
 the effect of causing such specified articles
 to be adulterated, unfit for human food, or
 misbranded.  (The provisions in this section
 of the bill are comparable to provisions in
 section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and
 Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 331) although they
 would apply somewhat more broadly to intra-
 state  as  well  as to  interstate  or foreign
 commerce.)
 Section 8. This section of the bill would
 (a) clarify the application to brand manu-
 facturers and printers, of a prohibition now
 in  the  act  against counterfeiting  official
 marks, etc.; (b) clarify the provisions of the
 act with respect to forgery,      unauthorized
 use or failure to use official marks, etc., and
 similar offenses; (c) add a restriction upon
 possession  of  official  devices,  or  devices,
 labels, meat, meat products, or other arti-
 cles bearing counterfeit official marks, and
 similar items, and add a prohibition against
 knowingly making any false representation
 that any article has been inspected and
 passed under the act.  (These provisions are
 modeled after provisions in section 203(h)
 of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946,
 as amended (7 U.S.C. 1622(h));  and (d)
 clarify prohibitions  with  respect to  false
 statements in official or nonofficial certifi-
 cates.
 Section 9. This section disqualifies for in-
 spection under the act the slaughtering of
 cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or
 other equines, and the preparation of the
 carcasses, or parts or products thereof, not
 intended for human food, and would require
 such articles to be denatured or otherwise
 identified as prescribed by the Secretary to
 deter their use as human food, unless they
 are naturally inedible by humans.
 Section 10. This section would clarify the
 authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to
 dispose of carcasses, parts thereof, meat and
 meat food products which are prepared at a
 federally inspected establishment when not
 under the supervision of an inspector or are
 prepared otherwise in violation of the regu-
 lations.  This could include condemnation
 of the articles if they were so prepared that
 their fitness for human food and freedom
 from adulteration could not be ascertained.
 This section also preserves the general au-
 thority for rules and regulations conferred
 by the act notwithstanding the provisions
 for specific kinds of regulations.
 Section 11. This section and section 14 of
 the bill (which would add section 31 to the
 act)  would make uniform provision in the
 act. for the responsibility of principals for
 acts of their agents.
 Section 12. Paragraph (a), in conjunction
 with the definition of a "farmer" and a "re-
 tail dealer" in section 14 of the bill (which
 would add section 34 to the act) 'would clarify
 and restrict the present authority for exemp-
 tions from inspection for farmers and retail
 dealers.  Exemptions would also be author-
 ized for farmers and retail dealers from other
 specific provisions of the act.  Exemptions
 under this paragraph would apply to opera-
 tions for interstate, foreign or intrastate com-
 merce.                                                                                                                                      Paragraph (b) concerns exemptions
 from inspection or other specific provisions
 of the act with respect to establishments
 slaughtering cattle, sheep, swine, or goats or
 preparing products solely for distribution
 within the State, territory, or District of Co-
 lumbia in which the establishment is located
 and provides for such exemptions in speci-
 fied alternative situations: (1) In case of ade-
 quate regulation by the State or other juris-
 diction concerned; or (2) in case the volume
 of operations is so minor as not to substan-
 tially affect interstate or foreign commerce.
 Paragraph (c) would authorize exemptions
 for operations and transactions at a retail
 store, restaurant, or similar place of business
 if inspection or application of the other spe-
 cific provisions of the act is found to be un-
 necessary for protection of the public or im-
 practicable.  It  is  not  contemplated  that
 continuous Inspection would be maintained
 over the preparation of meat, etc. at retail
 stores.  The authority for inspection of re-
 tail level activities should be available, how-
 ever, for the occasional instances in which it
 is necessary for the protection of consumers.
 Paragraph (d) would authorize the Secre-
 tary to impose conditions and restrictions
 upon any exemptions under this section.
 Paragraph (e) would prohibit distribution of
 exempted articles contrary to any such con-
 dition or restriction upon such exemption.
 Paragraph (f) would exclude from regula-
 tion under the act certain operations by any
 farmer in preparing meat or other specified
 articles for use by his family and certain
 other persons; and also would exclude from
 the act, with certain restrictions, the distri-
 bution of the unused portion of such articles
 prepared incidental to such use,.
 Section 13. This section and the definition
 of "adulterated" in section 14 of the bill
 (which would add new section 34 to the act)
 would clarify the regulatory authority of the
 Department to prevent adulteration of car-
 casses, parts thereof, meat, and meat food
 products and commerce in such articles when
 adulterated.
 Section 14. This section would add 15 new
 sections to the act.
 New section 22 would transfer the import
 meat provisions from section 306(b) of the
 Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1308(b)) to the
 Meat Inspection Act, clarify their application
 to carcasses, parts thereof, and meat food
 products, as well as meat, and clarify the
 authority of this Department to impose label-
 ing (including foreign origin labeling)  re-
 quirements and requirements to bar adulter-
 ated articles.
 New section 23 would prohibit the distri-
 bution in interstate, foreign or intrastate
 commerce of carcasses, parts thereof, meat or
 meat  food  products  of  horses,  or  other
 equinines unless they are identified to show
 the kinds of animals from which they were
 derived and authorize requirement that they
 be handled separately from other animals or
 meats.
 New section 24 would authorize the Secre-
 tary of Agriculture to prescribe conditions
 for storage and other handling of carcasses,
 parts thereof, meat and meat food products
 of the specified animals, which are capable
 of use as human food, by persons engaged in
 the business of buying, selling, freezing, stor-
 ing, transporting or otherwise handling such
 articles.

 premises of, slaughterers and processors of
 carcasses, or parts or products of carcasses of
 the specified animals; inedible products rend-
 erers; meat brokers; importers; transporta-
 tion agencies; and other specified classes of
 operators.  It would also make applicable in
 enforcement of the Meat Inspection Act, pro-
 visions of the Federal Trade Commission Act
 and the Communications Act of 1934,  as
 amended, authorizing requirement of reports
 and administrative subpenas and conferring
 other investigative and hearing powers.
 (b) This paragraph would require registra-
 tion                    of  meat  brokers,  inedible   products
 renderers,   animal   food manufacturers,
 wholesalers, and certain public warehouse-
 men handling carcasses, or parts or products
 of the carcasses of the specified animals, and
 other specified classes of operators.
 New section 26 would permit regulation of
 the distribution of dead, dying, crippled, or
 diseased animals or parts of carcasses of ani-
 mals that died otherwise than by slaughter,
 e.g., of natural causes.
 New section 27 would authorize the refusal
 or withdrawal of inspection services with re-
 spect to any establishment if the applicant
 or recipient is found unfit to engage in any
 business requiring inspection under the act
 because of the commission of certain types
 of crimes or specified degrees of association
 with persons convicted of certain crimes, or
 for other specified causes.  Opportunity for
 hearing would be provided in connection
 with such actions.  Authority to refuse or
 withdraw inspection for other specified rea-
 sons would be preserved and clarified,
 New section 28 would provide authority for
 -the temporary detention of carcasses, parts
 thereof,  meat  or  meat  food  products, or
 articles exempted from the definition of a
 meat food product, when there is reason to

 dealing  with  the  wholesomeness  of  such
 products.
 New section 29 would authorize judicial
 seizure and condemnation proceedings for
 certain carcasses, parts thereof, meat and
 meat food products that are adulterated, un-
 fit for human food, misbranded or otherwise
 in violation of the act, while being trans-
 ported ,(?r held for sale or donation at any
 level of distribution in the United States.
 New section 30 would authorize injunc-
 tions to enforce, or restrain violations of, the

 tion of cases arising under the act other than
 labeling cases within the jurisdiction of the
 U.S. Court of Appeals under section 5(e) of
 the act.
 New section 31 as noted earlier, would pro-
 vide for the responsibility of principals for
 acts or omissions of their -agents.
 New section 32: Paragraph (a) would au-
 thorize cooperation with the States or other
 jurisdictions in initiation or administration
 of adequate State or local meat inspection
 laws with respect to cattle, sheep, swine,
 goats, horses, mules, or other equines and

 New section 34 contains definitions of
 numerous terms used in the act.  The defini-
 tion of meat food product in paragraph (a)
 is in accord with long continued practice in
 administration of the act and clarifies the
 authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to
 except articles from the definition.   Such
 excepted articles are subject to the Federal
 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Secre-
 tary of Health, Education, and Welfare may
 require under section 18 of the bill that meat
 or meat food products used therein must
 have been inspected under this act.  The
 term applied to products of equines has the
 same comparable meaning as to cattle, sheep,
 swine, and goats.                          -

 New section 36 would authorize the ap-
 for supervising the application of official in-
 spection legends to domestic or imported
 inspected articles subdivided, repackaged, or
 relabeled elsewhere than where they were
 originally inspected by inspectors of  this
 Department, and the portion of the costs of

 Meat Inspection Act in order for a State or
 Territory to develop a meat inspection sys-
 tem at least the substantial equivalent of
 the requirements under the Meat Inspection
 Act.
 Subparagraph  (3)  provides  for  90  day
 further extension of time for inspection in

 the weekend were encouraged by the
 fact that Members of Congress them-
 selves' were encouraging this kind of
 thing a few short weeks ago.
 I think it is interesting to note that
 these same. Members of Congress have
 dropped this ill-advised procedure, and
 we have not heard much about so-called
 hearings for people to express their dis-
 pleasure with what is going on in Viet-
 nam.
 I agree with the gentleman from
 South Carolina, we are winning the war
 in Vietnam, and that is why the Com-
 munists are getting excited.  I think it
 is also significant that the Communist
 newspaper in New York took after me
 when I made my statement before.
 I welcome that kind of criticism.
 MEDICAL EDUCATION IN THE
 VETERANS' ADMINISTRATION
 (Mr. KORNEGAY asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute to revise and extend his remarks
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. KORNEGAY.  Mr. Speaker, I wish
 to commend the gentleman from Texas
 [Mr. TEAGUE], my chairman, for his
 leadership and foresight in introducing
 a bill which seeks to provide a new day
 for the medical care available to the vet-
 erans of this country, I wish to associate
 myself completely with him in this effort,
 and consequently I have introduced an
 identical bill.
 :Briefly, Mr. Speaker, the bill seeks to
 provide for closer cooperation between
 the medical schools of this country and
 the Veterans' Administration.  This co-
 operation, which has existed for nearly
 20 years, has been of tremendous value
 and importance in providing for the care
 of the sick and disabled veteran of all
 of our wars.  For many years now, the
 Veterans' Administration has been co-
 operating to the limit of its resources by
 taking money from the only source which
 was  available in  its  appropriation.
 Namely, this has been the medical ad-
 ministration item-to finance the neces-
 sary cooperation between the 78 medical
 schools with which the Veterans' Admin-
 istration is affiliated. Great advances in
 medicine have been made during the past
 20 years, and in order for the Veterans'
 Administration to keep up, there have
 been ever-increasing demands for the ex-
 penditure of larger sums of money for
 medical education. It is not fair or rea-
 sonable that this money should come out
 of funds intended primarily for patient
 care.  I do not offer any criticism but
 rather commendation for the Veterans'
 Administration for its action in the past.
 By spending this money for medical edu-
 cation the Veterans' Administration has
 saved the lives of countless veterans who
 otherwise might have died.
 I would like to read at this point the
 eloquent statement made by Dr. John L.
 Parks, member of the executive counsel
 of the Association of American Medical
 Colleges, and dean of the School of Med-
 icine of George Washington University
 here in Washington, before the Subcom-
 mittee on Hospitals in May of 1964:
 For more than a decade, immediatel-' fol-
 lowing World War II, a highly effective work-
 ing relationship developed between the Na-
 tion's medical schools and the Veterans' Ad-
 ministration hospitals.  Deans' committees
 helped establish, in the medical school af-
 filiated VA hospitals, very capable profes-
 sional staffs.   Academic appointments at-
 tracted highly qualified physicians who were
 interested In the combined Veterans' Ad-
 ministration-medical school services.  With
 the establishment and demonstration of the
 principle that an indlvdual's health needs
 are best served by physcians who have in-
 separable responsibilities for teaching, re-
 search, and patient care, VA hospital be-
 came important educational as well as pa-
 tient care centers.  Over a 10- to 15-year pe-
 riod, academically minded full-time Veter-
 ans' Administration staff physicians, assisted
 by medical-school-appointed attending and
 consultant staffs provided the veteran with
 superb medical care.  Many advances in our
 knowledge of cardiac conditions, infectious
 diseases, hypertension, psychiatric illnesses,
 circumstances of aging and chronic diseases
 such as rheumatoid arthritis and tubercu-
 losis have resulted from research conducted
 in  VA hospitals.   A large number of the
 Nation's  leading   medical  educators  have
 served as Veterans' Administration staff phy-
 sicians.                                                                    A close working relationship has
 been maintained throughout all the 17 years
 of affiliation between the Veterans' Admin-
 istration and the Nation's medical schools.
 The importance of the medical schools to the
 VA organization and in turn the significance
 of utilization of Veterans' Administration
 hosptal facilities for educational purposes is
 attested  to  by the  following  information
 from a 1964 AAMC? survey of the Veterans'
 Administration hospital-medical school rela-
 tions.
 Ninety-six VA hospitals are affiliated with
 78   medical  schools.   More  than   three-
 fourths of the junior medical students in the
 United States receives part of their clinical
 experience in veterans hospitals. A total of
 63,8135 out of 7,321 registered senior medical
 students have a part of their fourth year
 clinical training in VA hospitals.  Approxi-
 mately 10 percent of all residencies are in
 VA hospitals.  Many of America's best spe-
 cialty  training  programs  have                                                                              developed
 through combined university and affiliated
 VA  hospital  programs;  15 percent  of  all
 practicing physicians have received part of
 or all of their specialty training in Veterans'
 Administration hospitals.
 The importance and magnitude of this
 partnership arrangement between the medi-
 cal ;schools and the Veterans' Administra-
 tion have been stressed to demonstrate the
 tremendous  contributions that have been
 made not only to the health of the veterans
 but to the advancement of medical science
 and medical education in the United States
 through these affiliations.
 Over the past few years the deans have
 been concerned by a series of circumstances
 that  have  developed  in  the VA hospitals
 which have decreased the effectiveness and
 the stability of the medical school-VA affilia-
 tion.                                                                          University, and community hospital re-
 sources have rapidly expanded making avail-
 able for the teaching of clinical medicine
 many excellent resources that were not pres-
 ent 10 years ago.  Some of the VA-university
 affiliated hospitals have not kept pace with
 the advances of other medical schools re-
 sources.   Personnel,  equipment, and space
 that formerly provided an excellent care pro-
 gram for veterans are inadequate in some
 respects to meet present-day needs.  For ex-
 ample, it has been very difficult to maintain
 high quality personnel to staff clinical lab-
 oratories, departments of anesthesiology, and
 diagnostic and therapeutic X-ray services.
 VA salary scales have remained too low.  The
 competition for physicians who have aca-
 demic interests and excellent clinical abili-
 ties is increasing.  It is our understanding
 that the pay bill currently before Congress
 would provide appreciable salary increases
 for senior personnel.  The association be-
 lieves that an upward adjustment of the sal-
 ary scale for VA physicians is essential to
 the maintenance and advancement of health
 services for American veterans.
 The advantages of the Veterans' Admin-
 istration-medical school partnership become
 abundantly apparent.   With 169 hospitals
 and 6,500 physicians, the Veterans' Admin-
 istration  maintains  the  largest  hospital
 service under a single organization in the
 world.  Out of this vast VA hospital service
 program, it would seem advantageous for all
 concerned to concentrate on making the 96
 VA hospitals affiliated with medical schools
 special health centers where diagnostic and
 research problems receive the immediate and
 comprehensive attention of highly qualified
 physicians and research scientists working
 with the best equipment.  These hospitals
 form a major training area for manpower
 in the health fields.  At a time when all re-
 sources must be used to the fullest to pro-
 vide America and the world with physicians,
 nurses, dentists, and allied health personnel,
 the veterans facilities must advance at a high
 level of academic effectiveness.  Medical edu-
 cators have enthusiastically volunteered to
 help develop and maintain medical school.,
 affiliated VA hospitals as model medical cen-
 ters serving the health needs of American
 veterans and contributing to the progress of
 medicine through research and education.
 You may count on the medical schools to
 continue this mutually advantageous part-
 nership with the VA hospitals.
 The bill which I have the honor to
 sponsor with the chairman of the Com-
 mittee on Veterans' Affairs seeks to
 make our intent crystal clear to those
 myopic individuals in the Bureau of the
 Budget who insist on doing everything
 in their power to hamper the legislative
 activities of the Department of Medicine
 and Surgery in the Veterans' Adminis-
 tration.
 Mr. Speaker, with all due humility, I
 want to say that I have a deep interest in
 and perhaps a unique insight into this
 problem. It is my good fortune to serve
 on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and,
 also on the Interstate and Foreign Com-
 merce Committee.  This latter commit-
 tee has reported and enacted into law
 numerous pieces of legislation in this
 Congress, which represent a tremendous
 advance in the scientific and medical
 world and which represent billions of
 dollars in expenditures.  All of us, of
 course, are willing to support legislation
 which will extend or better the lives of
 mankind, which will make more likely
 the cure of cancer or stroke or heart di-
 sease or any other of the numerous mala-
 dies which affect the people of this world.
 but largely due to the efforts of the little
 group of "willful men" centered in the
 Bureau of the Budget, the Veterans Ad-
 ministration is being cutoff, hampered
 and harassed at every stage by some
 faceless bureaucrats in the Bureau of
 the Budget who cannot and will not see
 problems-or even the solutions to the
 problems, as proposed.  There primary
 concern, it seems is to stifle congressional
 intent.
 By their own arbitrary actions, these
 Budget Bureaucrats virtually halt the

 made available on an inservice basis to
 educate the regular teachers in the most
 efficacious methods of teaching in Project
 Prevention.  In addition, a complete staff
 of fully trained and experienced reading
 specialists, sociologists, psychologists, and
 other personnel must be part of the project
 to provide the firm and intelligent leader-
 ship so very necessary in enterprises of this
 kind.   Because of the  need for carefully
 trained and, prepared   workers,  volunteers
 would only be used in an auxiliary capacity.
 By no. means would this Project Preven-
 tion be a mere extension of the school year.
 Summer is summer, and relaxation-even
 for 8-year-olds-is necessary.  I believe that
 a well-balanced program of recreation, games,
 and other constructive activity would serve
 to make the remedial instruction more pal-
 atable and therefore more effective.
 Children with disabilities would be  in-
 vited to join the program by school authori-
 ties after consultations among the child's
 teacher, parents, and school authorities. A
 trained staff member would be assigned to
 work with each family during the course of
 their child's participation in the program
 to insure maximum retentive benefits.  It is
 neither our right nor responsibility to barge
 unwanted and uninvited into the lives of
 either a child or his family.  Therefore, this
 whole program would hinge on the coopera-
 tion of the parents. And it has been proven
 that parents, when faced with a crisis in
 their child's life, will become aware of the
 best course to take for the child. Family life
 has much to do with each child's academic
 and behaviorial deportment.  If a problem
 in the home environment can at least be
 identified, the benefits of the project to the
 child will not be negated.
 Physical disabilities are often responsible
 for those in reading and speech.  A com-
 plete and thorough physical examination of
 every child in Project Prevention would be
 required.  The cursory examination usually
 provided by school authorities is insufficient
 to disclose any physical defects which would
 cause ,a reading disability.  An eye ailment,
 even though minor, can retard reading prog-
 ress.         A child who does not see the black-
 board clearly will soon lose interest in learn-
 ing, and then the syndrome start.  Success
 in this area has been evidenced in Project
 Head Start.
 Extensive testing programs, administered
 and formulated by each individual school
 district but conforming to a statewide mini-
 mum standard, should be required on a year-
 round basis of those districts participating in
 Project Prevention so as to facilitate identifi-
 cation of problem readers and the so-called
 underachievers.  No Federal test should be
 required, and the respective State depart-
 ments of education should establish the
 guidelines for the testing programs of the
 individual   districts   participating.  This
 would, of course, be part of the project's ap-
 Such a summer program is not novel.
 Ecclesiastes tells us that there is nothing
 new under the sun, and this is so.  But it is
 novel in this form.  Other similar and re-
 lated efforts have shown that a program like
 Project Prevention is both feasible and nec-
 essary.
 Project Head Start has met with success
 with the children 'involved, although the
 redtape has bogged down the program in
 many areas and has detracted from its value.
 But while Head Start has an economic basis,
 Project Prevention must be founded strictly
 on need-need for correction.  It is, a sound,
 locally controlled educational program.
 Summer programs are currently in use in
 many school districts, but constitute in most
 cases only a kind of free day camp.  Nature
 study, cartoons, and baseball are stressed.
 There is, however, a rather progressive effort
 taking place in Garden City, N.Y., in the
 Fourth Congressional  District, wherein a
 limited number of children are exposed to a
 learning experience similar to that described
 in the foregoing. However, the emphasis in
 this and other programs like it is on the ex-
 ceptionally gifted and intelligent child with
 enrichment and accelerated mental develop-
 ment as the keynote.                                    The average or below
 average child has little or no place in these
 projects.  The Cleveland plan, in operation
 for many years in that Ohio city, has like
 aspects, but does provide a year-round re-
 medial  program.                                           In  North  Carolina,  the
 summer State-sponsored Governor's School
 in Raleigh  is another program for gifted
 young people on the secondary school level.
 Begun some years back by Gov. Terry San-
 ford, it has achieved a great success.
 Project Up-Lift, conducted by the HAR-
 YOU-ACT organization U in New York City's
 Harlem, is more an effort to keep children off
 the streets than to correct reading and other
 deficiencies.  Emphasis and direct action on
 grades 1 through 4 is lacking in this and
 other programs, although there is remedial
 reading as a part of the total project.
 Mr. Chairman, there are many details to be
 worked out.    There is much that I, as a lay-
 man, might have overlooked or not evalu-
 ated.  But we must make a start, and I offer
 Project Prevention  as  a  possible  starting
 point. One-half of our Nation is aged under
 25 years.  We must start now for them and
 for their children.
 I look forward to your comments, and t

 U.S. WORLD FOOD STUDY
 COMMISSION
 (Mr. LANGEN (at the request of Mr.
 HALL) was granted permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr.  LANGEN.   Mr.  Speaker,  last
 Thursday, October 14, the House Repub-
 lican task force on agriculture recom-
 mended the establishment of a bipartisan
 U.S. World Food Study Commission to
 plan the future U.S. role in the ap-
 proaching world food crisis.
 This 18-member Commission would be
 made up of 8 Congressmen and 10 mem-
 bers to be appointed by the President-
 these 10 from the Agriculture and State
 Departments,  universities,  and  other
 agricultural groups.
 The Commission would study world
 food and agricultural needs, coordinate
 present U.S. agricultural and food assist-
 ance programs, and recommend ways in
 which U.S. agriculture could help meet
 both U.S. and world food needs in the
 future.
 I am encouraged and deeply gratified
 with the widespread approval which this
 proposal is receiving both within and
 outside of Congress.  While the meas-
 ure is rapidly gaining support in the
 House, the numerous inquiries and com-
 ments about it which we continue to re-
 ceive daily, indicate a growing public
 recognition of the need for a realistic
 and responsible approach toward meet-
 ing this world challenge.
 Through the U.S. World Food Study
 and Coordinating Commission, one of the
 major problems of our time could be
 dealt with on a sound and rational basis,

 while at the same time, U.S. agriculture
 might be afforded the opportunity of
 enjoying a new economic vitality.
 Mr. Speaker, at this time, legislation to
 create this Commission has been intro-
 duced in the House by more than 60

 QUATE MEDICAL CARE FOR
 VIETNAM
 (Mr. HALL was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, as a "doctor
 in the House" and member of the Armed
 Services Committee, after interviewing
 returnees from southeast Asia, having a
 son-in-law there, and learning during
 my last trip there-late 1962-and from
 individual physicians of the AID and/or
 Department of State USCOM plan for
 bilateral care of our special forces and
 the Vietnamese civilians; I called upon
 the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the
 Department  of  Defense-Health  and
 Medical-and the three. surgeons general
 of the uniformed military forces for an
 analysis of their bilateral effort to supply
 the South Vietnamese civilians and our
 own forces with adequate medical care.
 This has become most intriguing and of
 the greatest interest, in view of our rapid
 buildup "without mobilizing the Re-
 serves, Guard units, or declaring any type
 of an emergency."
 Much of the information is classified,
 but I can assure the Members of the Con-
 gress that adequate and bilateral effort
 is being made in the true tradition of
 keeping the most able-bodied men on the
 front line, and at the same time provid-
 ing the best medical care for our sick and
 wounded, as well as battle casualties, in
 our effort to aid the South Vietnamese
 and their fight for freedom, concomitant
 with our Nation's tradition. My hat is
 off to the surgeons general, to the men
 and women of medicine and its ancillary
 branches, as well as to the Vietnamese
 themselves, who are doing' the best pos-
 sible job, in view of the number of cas-
 ualties, the savagery of the guerrilla-
 type warfare and their diversity of train-
 ing.                                                                                        I predict that soon, facilities, train-
 ing, materiel, and personnel will com-
 plete the ideal job as we would have it at
 home, which is indeed the beacon light
 and acme of worldwide professional ca-
 pability at this time.

 at New Paltz.
 I hope to organize a symposium on this
 program for supplemental education at
 one of our local universities to explore
 ways to make the program most effective
 and to make recommendations for Fed-
 eral legislation.  I will draft Project
 Prevention legislation with tY,e aid of
 Elie, Rouse Education and Labor Com-
 mittee for introduction in the next ses-
 sion of Congress.
 I have fully explained-this proposal in
 a letter to Congressman ALBERT H. QuiE,
 c$;sirmail of the House Republican edu-
 cation task force.
 The text of the letter follows:
 Oc'roaza 1,8, 1965.
 DEAR di-A-AN Qum: The flow pf con-
 structive and sound educational proposals
 Which have emanated from the unit you so
 No. 195-26
 ably chair has been a source of Irumense
 personal gratification to me as a member of
 the Task Force on Education.  The fabulous
 Fourth Congressional District of New York,
 which I have the honor to represent, is an
 area maintaining a deep and well-informed
 interest in all aspects of education. Because
 of this concerned interest, and because of
 my own involvement in the problems of
 modern education as both a parent and a
 legislator, I have greeted with great enthusi-
 asm all of the reports of our task force.
 I have also looked with expectation toward
 the administration for additional programs
 of improved educational techniques, and ad-
 vancement of the start well-begun in Project
 Head Start. But even after continuous prod-
 ding by educators and legislators 1 and after
 a White House Conference on Education, no
 further steps have been announced as being
 under consideration.  And there is a great
 need for such additional steps.
 One of the most pressing problems in edu-
 cation today is that of the high school drop-
 out.  Knowledge of its existence is legion, but
 solutions of It are not nearly so commonly
 spoken of. The conventional strategy is to
 dissuade the potential dropout from the act
 in an 11th-hour plea which offers him job-
 training, a work-while-in-school plan, and
 other inducements to remain in school. until
 graduation. But these measures do not even
 come close to eliminating the problem: even
 the dissuaded dropout is likely to raise a
 family in which the whole dropout cycle will
 repeat itself.
 In a recent data survey of Maryland school
 dropouts, it was found that the fathers of
 63 percent of the dropouts attended school
 for no more than 9 years, and that, of the
 mothers, 57 percent never went past the 9th
 grade either.2  The dropout's problem is
 obviously not one of making a ruinous choice,
 but rather, of succumbing to forces which
 have troubled him for years.   Forces such
 as antipathy toward school, fear of learning,
 dislike of academic disciplines.  And these
 do not develop in the 1 or 2 years before the
 majority  of  dropouts  leave  school  after
 grades 10 or ll.
 The key to this problem's solution lies not
 In action on the high school or junior high
 school levels, but rather in the elementary,
 or grammar school.  By the time the drop-
 out hears ballplayers, politicians, and edu-
 cators urge him to stay in school, it's too
 late.
 What is the dropout like?  A composite
 portrait might run something like this:  a
 quiet boy, about 16 or 17 years old, living
 with his parents.  His parents live together.
 His father is likely as not an unskilled or
 semiskilled  laborer,  or  a  merchant, who
 never finished high school.   He has no job
 outside of school, takes little or no part in
 athletics or extracurricular activities. He
 has average or below average mental ability,
 and his achievements in school, are less than
 normal.   He makes poor grades, usually
 flunking up to four subjects in the term
 prior to dropping out.  He always moved
 ahead with his class;  he was never "left
 back."    He dislikes school, teachers, and
 doesn't feel comfortable in a classroom.  He
 hates to read.  He is afraid to speak in class.
 He panics during exams. Neither parent can
 help him, so he Is alone.  There are few
 books at home; his parents don't like to read
 either. He is afraid, and very much alone in
 his fear. His parents are against his dropping

 out, but it makes no difference to him at
 that point*
 So the dropout is alone, and fears learning,
 and hates to read.  And he drops out, still
 alone, and very much afraid.
 I believe, in agreement with many,proini-
 nent educators, that this fear of learning is
 the basis for the dropout problem.  I fur-
 ther concur in the opinion of many educa-
 tors that a lack of reading ability is the
 cause of this fear of, learning.   Statistics
 bear this out. in that same Maryland study
 previously mentioned, 36 percent of all drop-
 outs read on a third to sixth grade reading
 level, and 10 percent read on a level below
 the third grade.
 All studies of this problem indicate that
 the most noticeable trait of the dropout is
 his hostility to and fear of learning.  Read-
 ing is the key to learning.  When the child
 cannot read with ease, he becomes annoyed,
 frustrated, and-finally-actively hostile to
 reading and learning.  And then he drops
 out.  This frustration builds from year to
 year from the time the child begins to learn
 to read in the first grade .5
 Most educators in the field agree that if a
 child's reading disability is not identified and
 corrected by the fourth grade, there is a good
 chance that he or she will drop out of high
 school before grade 11.
 In order to remedy this condition by at
 least making an attempt to break the vicious
 cycle of the dropout, I would urge the
 House Republican Task Force on Education
 to immediately begin considering the pos-
 sibility of a summer :remedial program for
 children in grades 1, :3, 3, and 4 to correct
 reading disability and to provide an en-
 riched educational experience for children
 who,  if  otherwise left alone,  would soon
 become    very much  alone and very much
 afraid.
 I propose  that  this  program  be  called
 Project   Prevention, inasmuch as it will-
 hopefully-prevent a high incidence of drop-
 outs.
 This program would be of from     six to
 eight weeks' duration during the summer
 months, being conducted by regular qualified
 elementary schoolteachers in the existing
 school structures across the Nation.  It would
 be administered by individual school dis-
 tricts, under the supervision of the respec-
 tive State departments of education.  The
 Federal Government would provide the funds
 necessary for the project upon submission
 of a suitable plan of action to the U.S.
 Office  of  Education  by  State authorities.
 It would be an educational rather than a
 poverty program, although a good many of
 those it would help are in the low family in-
 come category.
 Let it be clearly understood that under no
 circumstances would any of the provisions
 of the civil rights bills of 1957. 1960, and
 1964 or the voting rights bill of 1965 be
 abrogated if the program functions properly.
 No segregated schools,  or  school  districts
 under indictment by a, Federal grand jury
 for a civil rights violation, would be eligible
 for funds.
 The basic purpose of the program would be
 to correct reading and related deficiencies
 before the critical fifth year of schooling.
 This would be accomplished by a basic cur-
 riculum of remedial help in reading and
 speech.  Special training programs must be

 Mr. Speaker, the remarks by the Sur-

 Robert B. Brown, on the occasion of the
 recommissioning of the U.S.S. Repose
 AH-16 in San Francisco, Calif., on Octo-

 effort that is being made, to say nothing

 history of the Repose and hospital ships
 in general, to say nothing of close sup-

 the world. I think all will be interested:
 REMARKS BY REAR ADM. ROBERT B. BROWN,
 MEDICAL  Cosvs,  USN,  SURGEON  GENERAL
 AND CHIEF, BUREAU OF MEDICINE AND SUR-
 GERY AT COMMISSIONING OF U.S.S. "REPOSE"
 (AH-16), SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF.
 It was with great personal as well as pro-
 fessional pride and gratification that I re-
 ceived Secretary Nitze's invitation to speak
 at the commissioning of the U.S.S. Repose.
 It has been my privilege to serve on three of
 our fine hospital ships-two in World War
 II, and one, this very one, in Korea.  Mr.
 Nitze's invitation reached me in Hawaii as I
 was returning from a visit to our medical
 facilities in Vietnam and the western. Pa-
 cific, more firmly convinced than ever of the
 great contributions a hospital ship will make
 to the medical support of Our important
 military operations in southeast Asia.
 The concept of a floating hospital is not
 a recent one; in fact, hospital ships can be
 traced back to 1741 when the English fleet
 invaded  Cartagena.   Commodore  Preble
 gave the American Navy its first hospital
 ship during the war with Tripoli.  When the
 fleet left Sicily in 1803, the U.S.S. Intrepid
 was left behind to serve as a hospital. The
 fleet returned 2 months later, and the In-
 trepid resumed her place as a ship of the
 line:  True, this first hospital ship was cre-
 ated by designation rather than planning,
 but a hospital ship nonetheless.
 Regulations for hospital ships were pub-
 lished in 1818, but it was not until the Civil
 War that these vessels again appeared with
 the fleet.  Perhaps the most famous of this
 era is the Red Rover, captured from the Con-
 federates and converted to a Navy hospital
 ship.  Commodore Foote described her as
 "the most complete thing of the kind that
 ever floated * * * the icebox holds over 300
 tons.  She has bathrooms, laundry, elevator
 for the sick from the lower to the upper deck,
 amputating room, nine different water clos-
 ets, gauze blinds to. the windows to keep the
 cinders and smoke from annoying the sick,
 two separate kitchens for sick and well, a
 regular corps of nurses, and two water closets
 for every deck."
 There followed a succession of hospital
 ships, converted from liners, each an im-
 provement over its predecessor,  When the
 U.S.S. Relief joined the fleet in World Wat I,
 it was the first ship of our Navy which had
 been constructed at the outset for hospital
 purposes.
 At the start of World War II, the Navy
 had two hospital ships in commission, 'the
 Solace and the Relief.  The Solace was at
 Pearl Harbor when the Japanese made their
 infamous attack and she served most capably
 in Caring for casualties, At the height of
 World'War II the Navy manned a fleet of 18
 hospital ships and included In these were
 the 6 of the Haven class, of which the Re-
 'pose is one.  These shops 'were designed and
 built from the hull up as 800-bed modern
 hospitals.
 Three of these fine ships served during the
 Korean war, the Repose, the Consolation, and
 the Haven. Each was equipped with a hell-
 copter landing platform, a recommendation
 of Vice Adm. Joel T. Boone, one of our most
 distinguished    naval    medical    officers.
 Casualties could now be flown directly from
 the battlefront to a floating hospital facility
 minutes after they were wounded.  Initial
 evacuation  by  helicopter,  immediate and
 thorough professional care on the hospital
 ship, and further evacuation to shore-based
 hospitals by trained aeromedical teams, un-
 doubtedly saved hundreds of American lives.
 When the Haven was placed in the reserve
 fleet in 1957, to function as a dockside hos-
 pital at Long Beach, it marked the first time
 since the Civil War that the U.S. Navy lacked
 the capability of a complete and modern
 floating  hospital,  a  medical  facility  that
 could be underway to an area of need within
 a few hours after the call for help went forth.
 When the Repose sails for Vietnam she not
 only will be adding another illustrious chap-
 ter to her long career of humanitarian serv-
 ice, but her new "facelifting" will provide
 American servicemen with the finest and
 most advanced medical treatment in history.
 Scores of men working around the clock at
 this shipyard have completely overhauled the
 gallant veteran of World War II and Korea.
 They have probed, painted, and polished her
 until she looks like new.  And she is liter-
 ally better than ever.
 The Repose is provided with the most re-
 cent hospital equipment and supplies and
 with a superbly qualified staff.  Her medical
 spaces are designed and located to afford
 centralized functions and to guarantee max-
 imum patient-care benefits.  She Is truly a
 modern diagnostic and treatment facility.
 Her helicopter pad can receive the heavier
 craft now in use.  If the weather precludes
 patient  transportation by air,  ambulatory
 patients can come aboard by way of one of
 four ladders and electrically driven hoists
 will bring litter patients aboard.
 There are two crews aboard the Repose:
 the crew responsible for the operation and
 maintenance of the ship is commanded by
 Captain Maher and includes 16 officers and
 200 enlisted personnel; the 750-bed hospital
 is commanded  by  Captain  Engle,  and  is
 staffed by 24 physicians, 3 dentists, 7 Medical
 Service Corps officers, 2 chaplains, 29 nurses
 and  250 hospital corpsmen    and  dental
 technicians.
 In addition to providing the basic facili-
 ties and capabilities of a large modern hos-
 pital, the Repose will carry several innova-
 tions to frontline diagnosis and treatment.
 For years the Navy has pioneered in the pres-
 ervation of blood by freezing.  As yet we
 have not used frozen blood in Vietnam but
 we will have the capability for storing and
 reconstituting frozen blood aboard this ship.
 I wish to emphasize that this Is an addi-
 tional means of meeting peak requirements;
 it is a supplement not a replacement for the
 effective whole blood program that has been
 and is the responsibility of the Army medi-
 cal laboratory in Japan.  Frozen blood can
 be stored for an indefinite period of time
 and reconstituted, ready for use, within a
 matter of minutes.
 The Repose will carry a portable pump-
 oxygenator,  an  artificial       heart,  with  the
 trained personnel to utilize it. The feasi-
 bility and importance of repairing damaged
 blood vessels in the arms and legs in forward
 medical facilities was definitely established
 during the Korean war.  We believe it should
 now  be  determined whether  a front-line
 capability to artificially support the circula-
 tion of the patient and do direct surgery on
 the heart (and the large vessels connected to
 it) is also important.
 Aboard the Repose will be the most mod-
 ern laboratory equipment.  Included in the
 advanced diagnostic techniques available is
 the one which utilizes an antigen-antibody
 reaction and a fluorescent dye to rapidly
 for the treatment of certain types of infec-
 tion including tetanus and gas gangrene.
 Finally, the Repose will afford an interest-
 ing opportunity for the staff to participate
 in the civic action program.  When the work-
 load permits, the doctors, nurses, and corps-
 men will be able to go ashore, into the vil-
 lages, to help and train the local people to
 solve their medical problems.  When it can
 be done without interfering with our pri-
 mary mission, care and treatment of the sick
 and injured members of the Armed Forces,
 we will make the Repose facilities available
 for training selected Vietnamese doctors and
 nurses.  Civic action activities are winning
 for us many new and valuable friends; they
 also provide professionally rewarding outlets
 for  our  medical  department  personnel.
 Naval medical personnel are already partici-
 pating in civic action programs with AID-
 USOM,  at the station hospital                                                                                                                                          in  Saigon
 and with the Marines.
 In closing, I express my appreciation to all
 of those who have so capably planned and
 accomplished the rebuilding of the Repose.
 My congratulations and best wishes go with
 the splendid crews that have been selected

 Mr. ELLSWORTH.  Mr. Speaker, on
 October 14, I introduced a bill, H.R.
 11600, to establish a system of Federal-
 State tax sharing.  As I pointed out at
 that time, under the formula of this bill
 about $2.5 billion would be returned an-
 nually to the States under present condi-
 tions and the amount would grow as the
 .tax base grows. The State governments
 are given complete control over expendi-
 ture of this revenue.  Under the bill's
 formula Kansas, for example, would re-
 ceive about $24.5 million which could be
 used for any project approved by the
 State.
 I rise today to point out to my col-
 leagues the part played in the introduc-
 tion of this legislation by my own con-
 stituents. Last June, when most of those
 responding to my periodic poll favored
 the Federal Government sending a por-
 tion of its revenues to the States, I de-
 cided it was time for tax-sharing legis-
 lation to be drafted.  This important
 bill is directly in line with the wishes
 of the people of the Third District.  I
 am bringing this to the attention of the
 House of Representatives because I be-
 lieve it to be evidence that there can be
 meaningful interchanges between Con-
 gressmen and constituents on vital legis-
 lative issues.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE ,         October 19, 1965
 Mr.  CLEVELAND. Mr. Speaker, on
 next, Sunday, October 24, there will be
 ceremonies in Peterborough,' N.H., to
 mark the 200th anniversary of the birth
 of the Reverend Abiel Abbot who, in
 1832, led the founding of the first, tax-
 supported, free public library in the
 world.  Up to that time, free public
 libraries were maintained by private
 charities  and  organizations  such  as
 churches, privately endowed universities,
 monasteries, corporations, and individual
 patrons.                            -
 Under the leadership of Abiel Abbot,
 however,,a new era in library science and
 public policy was begun on April 9, 1833,
 when the town of Peterborough, at Mr.
 Abbot's urging, voted to establish a public
 library supported by public funds.  This
 action placed the Peterborough Town
 Library in a unique class as the first
 library in the world not only to be pat-
 ronized by all the people but also sup-
 ported and managed by all of them.
 Mr. Abbot was a truly remarkable man,
 filled with a sense of public service which
 he pursued indefatigably to the last-
 ing benefits of his fellow man then and
 now.
 Born. in Wilton, N.H,, December 14,
 1795, he came to Peterborough in 1827
 when he was 61 to become the minister
 of the Unitarian Church.   He was a
 leader in many efforts to improve the
 community and the original library he
 founded was primarily for children.
 He also created and made available to
 the townspeople a ministerial library and
 a Sunday school library. He was a inem-
 ber of the school committee and founded
 a county common school association and
 helped to establish a normal school. Mr.
 Abbot also worked with the Lyceum
 movement which was a sort of adult edu-
 cation program.  He headed the Peter-
 borough Tree Society, which planted
 many shade and fruit trees in the town.
 He conducted numerous experiments in
 agriculture and was a noted historian.
 During the active years of his minis-
 try--until 1839-and during his retire-
 ment years-until his death at 94 in
 1859-he gave generously of his time and
 money to numerous worthy causes.
 Sunday's ceremonies will be conducted
 under the auspices of the Peterborough
 Historical Society and the principal
 speaker is to be Mr. Samuel Abbot Smith,
 of Chelsea, Mass., a great-great-grand-
 son of Abiel Abbot.
 It is an honor and privilege to have
 this opportunity for paying tribute in the
 House of Representatives to the memory
 of so influential a man as the Reverend
 Abiel Abbot. That his work continues to
 flourish and grow, enriching the whole of
 our society is due in large measure to the
 leadership of Mrs. Charlotte Derby, presi-
 dent of the Peterborough Historical So-
 ciety. She has done a magnificent job in
 organizing this tribute and bringing be
 fore the public knowledge of the life of
 Abiel Abbot and his pioneering work in
 Peterborough.
 THE   SECOND   DUBLIN   CONFER-
 ENCE-A   DECLARATION                     FOR
 WORLD PEACE
 (Mr. CLEVELAND (at the request of
 Mr. HALL) was granted ;permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Speaker, dur-
 ing the first week of October, when Pope
 Paul was in New York to issue his elo-
 quent appeal for world peace and moral-
 ity before the United Nations, another
 event of great significance to the cause
 of world peace occurred in Dublin, N.H.
 This was the Second Dublin Confer-
 ence held just 20 years after the First
 Dublin Conference once again under the
 leadership  of  the  distinguished  Mr.
 Grenville Clark.  A very distinguished
 company of 54 men and women gathered
 under the general chairmanship of Pres-
 ident Kingman Brewster, of Yale, for the
 purpose of reviewing the troubled state
 of the world after 20 years of seeking
 international order through the United
 Nations.
 The reports of the work of the Second
 Dublin Conference were blanketed by the
 publicity given to the Pope.  Therefore,
 I take this opportunity of inserting in the
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an excellent ac-
 count of the conference which appeared
 in the Peterborough Transcript, an edi-
 torial from the Transcript, the text of
 the declaration of the conference as pub-
 lished in the Transcript, and a column
 by the distinguished commentator Max
 Freedman, which appeared in the Wash-
 ington Sunday Stai' on October 10:
 DUBLIN  DECLARATION  SEEKS END  TO  WAR-
 SUPPLEMENTS                                                                                      POPE'S    MESSAGE-WORLD
 PEACE PLAN NEARLY UNANIMOUS
 In the echoes of Pope Paul's thunderous
 world peace message the previous day, the
 Second  Dublin       Declaration  was released
 Tuesday morning in the Alexander James
 studio, where  the  Dublin  conference had
 been meeting since early Saturday.
 Almost a supplement to the Pope's plea
 for peace to originate in the hearts of man,
 the statement etched the outlines of "an
 effective world organization to prevent war."
 Of the 54 conferees, 52 announced that they
 would sign the declaration.  "The other two
 may sign at any time, for all I know," said
 conference secretary Grenville Clark.
 In 1945, 30 of 48 delegates signed the First
 Dublin Declaration.
 Mr. Clark held out hope that the con-
 ference's conclusions would encourage more
 interest  in  the problem  of  reaching and
 maintaining peace.
 Sunday the group sent a greeting to. Pope
 Paul,,  emphasizing  their common  concern
 with world peace through universally appli-
 cable law.
 The  first  declaration    was  presented to
 President Truman, congressmen, leaders of
 other nations and U.N. delegates.   Before
 such  distribution  of  the second declara-
 tion, however, Mr. Clark announced he would
 make soundings of the "efficacy of the docu-
 ment- In other parts of the world," and if the
 response was favorable, a Third Dublin Con-
 ference might convene in 3 or 4 months.
 Several conferees were critical of the decla-
 ration's approach, even while praising it.
 W. H. Ferry, onetime Manchester and Con-
 cord newsman, now vice president of the
 Center for Democratic Institutions, Santa
 Barbara, Calif., told his colleagues that the
 document  was  hampered  by  a  "made  in
 America" .imprint.
 "HEARTS OF MEN"
 He challenged whether the message would
 reach the "hearts and minds of men," an
 aspect also emphasized by clergymen at the
 conference.
 Edgar A. Snow, author and expert on Com-
 munist China, who had flown in from Ge-
 neva, attacked the document's special men-
 tion of Red China and was instrumental in
 having a reference to China toned down.
 Although  urging  a  strengthened  U.N.
 charter to implement its recommendations
 (with another world body to replace the U.N.
 if it failed), the declaration pointed out six
 U.N. deficiencies.
 Its first, point is that nations having one-
 fourth the population of the world are not
 in  the  U.N.,  an  obvious  suggestion  that
 China should have U.N. membership.
 Mr. Snow punctured more than one myth
 in  the  5-day  peace  discussion.   Although
 most Americans don't believe there is a force
 in the world such as "American national-
 ism," or "Imperialism," as Russia and China
 term U.S. military activities, many nations
 "shiver in an atmosphere of oppression and
 fear" of American interference in their af-
 fairs.
 OUTSIDE TWO-THIRDS
 World federalism is held in suspicion in
 the two-thirds of the world-China and the
 underdeveloped,  nonwhite  nations-which
 is on the "outside" of the rich North At-
 lantic community, Mr. Snow emphasized.
 These nations have just gained their in-
 dependence and they are not going to sur-
 render their precious sovereignty to a world
 government, he said.  The Chinese have just
 found their national unity for the first time
 in 300 years.
 Mr. Snow said that war was not in China's
 interest,  because the Chinese  are  at last
 solving their centuries-old problems, espe-
 cially in agriculture.
 What the "outside" two-thirds of the world
 wants and needs are (1) security for its vari-
 ous  national  sovereignties  and  protection
 from outside interference, (2) the means to
 catch up quickly with the advanced third
 of the world.
 CALL FOR DEVELOPMENT
 The declaration calls for a world develop-
 ment agency, which would answer the sec-
 ond need, although the call is not so strongly
 stressed as some conferees wished.
 The Dublin statement also calls for the
 freedom for nations to have their own re-
 volutions,  unless  their  internal  conflicts
 threaten world peace.
 Mr. Snow pointed out that the present
 tendency to charge into a country and pre-
 vent overthrow of an established government
 by a militant minority would have prevented
 the American, French, and Russian revolu-
 tions from occurring.
 The peace document was produced by a
 conference drafting committee, which went
 into the early morning hours on two occa-
 sions to polish up the controversial and high-
 ly important language involved.
 THE DRAFTERS
 Stanley A. Weigel, judge of the U.S. district
 court in San Francisco, was chairman of the
 drafting group, the members of which were
 A. J. G. Priest, professor of law, University
 of Virgina Law  School;  Abraham Wilson,
 lawyer and counsel for United World Fed-
 eralists, New York; George C. Holt, columnist
 and executive director, New England branch,
 United World Federalists; Robert, H. Reno,
 Concord lawyer; Charles Bolts, executive vice
 president, Viking Press, New York, and Louis
 B.  Sohn, Bemis professor of international
 law, Harvard University Law School.
 Consultants included Norman Cousins, Sat-
 urday Review editor;  John K. Jessup, Life
 magazine chief  editorial  writer;  James P.
 Warburg,  author,  Greenwich,  Conn.,  and
 Gerard Piel, publisher, Scientific American.
 In ex officio roles were Mr. Clark, Mr. Brew-
 ster, and Thomas H. Mahony, Boston lawyer.
 HIGHLY PRAISED
 The first draft was highly praised by a
 number of conferees  including Mr.  Clark,
 who termed it "a superb document," present-
 ing "a superbly balanced consensus of views."

 of communication; 14 and this problem was
 periodically reexamined during the years
 which followed.2
 In New York City (as in other cities) Is
 the board of education turned its attention
 to the Puerto Rican child because communi-
 cation had to be established, and (in this
 context)  the most ambitious study of the
 educational problems presented by the Puer-
 to Rican migration became (for New York
 City) "a 4-year inquiry into the education
 and adjustment of Puerto Rican pupils in
 the public schools of New York City * * * a
 major effort * * * to establish on a sound
 basis a citywide program for the continuing
 improvement of the educational opportuni-
 ties of all non-English speaking pupils in
 the public schools." 17
 If  the major emphasis of  "The Puerto
 Rican Study" was to have been the basic
 problem of language (English), its objectives
 were soon extended to include the equally
 important areas of community orientation
 and acculturation.  The study's objectives
 were summed-up in three main problems:
 1, What are the more effective ways (meth-
 ods) and materials for teaching English as
 a second language to newly arrived Puerto
 Rican pupils?
 2. What are the most effective techniques
 with which the schools can promote a more
 rapid  and  more  effective  adjustment  of
 Puerto Rican parents and children to the
 community and the community to them?
 3. Who are the Puerto Rican pupils in the
 New York City public schools? 18
 For each of these problems, "The Puerto
 Rican Study" made detailed recommenda-
 tions (problem III, largely an ethnic survey,
 resulted in a profile of  characteristics of
 pupils of Puerto Rican background and fused
 into problems I and II) 1D
 PROBLEM I: HOW EFFECTIVELY TO TEACH ENG-
 LISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
 "The Puerto Rican Study," concluded that
 an integrated method (vocabulary method;
 structured or language patterns method; and
 the  functional  situations  or  experiential
 method) was to be employed, and it devel-
 oped two series of related curriculum bulle-
 tins, keyed to the prescribed New York City
 course of study 2?   But in the course of its

 considerations, it dealt with the ancillary
 (and vital) need "to formulate a uniform
 policy for the reception, screening, place-
 ment and periodic assessment of non-English
 speaking pupils." 21   It recommended (until
 such time as the Bureau of Educational Re-
 search may find or develop better tests or
 tests of equal value)   the use of the USE
 test-ability to understand spoken English;
 the Gates reading test-primary and ad-
 vanced; and the Lorge-Thorndike nonverbal
 test. It proposed, too, three broad categories
 of class organization;  considered the need
 of  adequate  staffing  (substitute  auxiliary
 teachers [SAT]; Puerto Rican coordinators;
 school-community  coordinators  and      other
 teaching  positions  [OTP]; and       guidance
 counselors, particularly in the senior high
 schools), and found essential the "coordinat-
 ing [of] efforts of colleges and universities
 * * * to achieve greater unity of purpose and
 effort in developing both undergraduate and
 graduate programs for teachers who will work
 with non-English speaking pupils." 22
 PROBLEM II:  HOW TO PROMOTE A MORE RAPID
 AND MORE EFFECTIVE ADJUSTMENT OF PUERTO
 RICAN PARENTS AND CHILDREN TO THE COM-
 MUNITY AND THE COMMUNITY TO THEM.
 In its recognition of this problem, "The
 Puerto Rican Study" struggled with provid-
 ing answers to the basic anxieties and pre-
 occupations of a group of people beset with
 problems of housing, adequate employment,
 health, and "assimilation."  That the study
 found difficulty in providing answers is per-
 haps explained in its inability to relate the
 answers it found most effective to the man-
 date of the school.  If it was possible to re-
 vise curriculums and discern the problems
 implicit in the learning experience of the
 Puerto Rican child, it remained an altogether
 .different matter to attempt the solution of
 broad  socioeconomic  problems,  or to  at-
 tempt the amelioration of community ills.
 In essence, the following statement suggests
 how far the schools have retreated from the
 ,community:  "On  the  relation  of Puerto
 Rican parents to schools, 'The Puerto Rican
 Study' holds that because Puerto Rican par-
 ents are preoccupied with problems of learn-
 Ing English, finding apartments, finding em-
 ployment, and with problems of providing
 their families with food, clothing, and proper
 health protection, they are not ready to set
 a high priority on their children's school
 problems.  The schools can't wait until they
 are ready." 22
 If "The Puerto Rican Study" is not thought
 of as a finished guide to the solution of the
 problem it investigates but rather as a be-
 ginning, it must be characterized as the best
 assessment  of  the  educational  challenges
 which the Spanish-speaking child poses to
 the American school.  In this sense, it is
 both a guide and a blueprint for effective
 reform.
 IV. A POSTSCRIPT
 Basically, the Puerto Rican child is not a
 newcomer to the American school.  In many
 ways he presents himself to a school and
 a society whose very nature is heterogeneous
 and variegated and to which the non-Eng-
 lish-speaking child is no stranger.  In this
 sense, the acquisition of English for the
 Puerto Rican child (if necessary and inevi-
 table) is not a great problem; certainly, it is
 soluble  problem  to  which  the  American
 school brings a rich and successful experience
 and "The Puerto Rican Study" affirms how
 successful and resourceful American schools
 can and have been.    What is more important
 to the Puerto Rican child (and to American
 society) is the process of acculturation.  How
 does the Puerto Rican child retain his iden-
 tity? his language? his culture?  In sub-
 stance this remains the crucial problem, and
 21 See summary, supra, p. 3.
 21 Ibid., p. 5.
 29 Ibid., p. 7.
 in this crucial context, the role of the school
 in American society needs to be carefully
 assessed.  If the Puerto Rican child is sinned
 against today, the tragedy lies in the con-
 tinued assault against his identity, his lan-
 guage, and his cultural wellsprings.  In this
 sense, his experience is not fundamentally
 different from that of millions of other chil-
 dren to whom the American school was a
 mixed blessing.  This is in no way a depreca-
 tion of the egalitarianism of the American
 "common school," but rather a reaffirmation
 of the loss of the great opportunity that a
 free society afforded its schools to nurture
 and treasure the rich and varied traditions
 of its charges.  The "melting pot" theory Is
 at best an illusion measured against the
 realities of American society,  and a true
 discernment of its strengths 24
 In another light, the Puerto Rican child
 is the creature of his social context:  Its
 opportunities or lack of opportunities.  If
 his needs are to be met, they can only be
 effectively met insofar as the needs of this
 context are met.  A school which is not
 community- oriented is a poor school.  If this
 is so for the middle-class suburban school,
 it is even more so for the urban school which
 is the heir of the myriad complexities of a
 rapidly deteriorating central city.  More im-
 portant than the Puerto Rican child's lack
 of English, is the lack of that economic se-
 curity and well-being that relates him to a
 viable family structure.  If the Puerto Rican
 child's major disenchantment does not re-
 sult from the segregated schools into which
 his poverty has placed him,25 still one would
 have to deplore the school's inability to cope
 with the alienation that segregation spawns,
 and the bitter destitution that poverty brings
 to its children.  Perhaps, the Great Society
 really emerges from a strengthening of the
 school by its joining hands with all the
 creative agencies of the community.
 V PROGRESS IN VIETNAM
 Mr. CANNON.  Mr. President, re-
 cently, I had the rare opportunity to
 visit extensively is southeast Asia on be-
 half of the Armed Services Committee
 and the Preparedness Subcommittee of
 which I am a member.
 Yesterday, I made preliminary com-
 ments on some aspects of the trip which
 impressed me, and I am preparing a
 more detailed written report. However,
 I do feel I can assure the Members of this
 body that the tremendous cost of the
 Vietnam war in both manpower and
 money is not being expended vainly and
 without results.
 My overall impression is that we are
 making progress there and I have the
 feeling  of  cautious  optimism  about
 achieving  our  objective  in  Vietnam
 which is to use our military might to
 reach a peaceful, negotiated settlement
 at the conference table.
 I traveled extensively in many areas
 where combat operations were involved
 on land, sea, and air, and I came away
 in unhesitating admiration of the qual-
 ity of our fighting men and of their abil-
 ity to satisfactorily perform their mis-

 The census of 1950 began the recording of
 second generation Puerto Ricans (those born
 on the continent to Island-born parents) and
 counted 76,000; in 1960, the figure stood at
 272,000, so that by 1960 3 out of every 10
 Puerto Rican residents in the United States
 were born in the States.
 Although, there has been a dispersal of
 the migration outside Greater New York City,
 the overwhelming number of Puerto Ricaxis
 are New Yorkers; the 1960 census showed

 of the U.S. total).  New York City's propor-
 tion had dropped from 88 percent in 1940 to
 83 percent in 1950 and to 69 percent In

 American economy the dispersion will un-
 doubtedly continue?

 encourages nor discourages migration.  As
 an American citizen, the Puerto Rican moves

 complete freedom.  if his movement is vul-

 reference to the economy on the mainland.

 grants, converted them from rural to urban
 people, relieved the island of some of Its

 speaking and nurtured by a different culture,

 II. PUERTO RICANS AND MAINLAND SCHOOLS
 The Puerto Rican journey to the main-
 land has been (and continues to be) the sub-
 ject of a vast literature!  For the most part,
 the Puerto Rican child reflects a context of
 bitter deprivation, poor housing, high unem-
 ployment, and a record of disappointing edu-
 cational achievement.  It is the poverty con-
 text to which the Puerto Rican community
 has been relegated in our cities that explains
 its problems and graphically underscores Its
 poor achievement in the schools.  Not only
 is the Puerto Rican child asked to adapt to
 a cultural ambience which is strange and
 new, he remains further burdened by an the
 negative pressures of a ghetto milieu which
 educators have discerned as inimical to even
 the most rudimentary educational acconl-
 plishment?
 How the Puerto Rican child has fared in
 the mainland schools Is best illustrated in
 the experience  in  New York  City,  where
 Puerto  Ricans  have  the  lowest  level of
 formal education of any identifiable ethnic
 or color group. Only 13 percent of Puerto
 Rican men and women 25 years of age and
 older in 1960 had completed either high
 school or more advanced education.  Among
 New York's nonwhite (predominately Negro)
 population,  31.2  percent  had completed
 high school; and the other white population
 (excluding Puerto Ricans) did even better.
 Over 40 percent had at least completed high
 school!
 In 1960, more than half-52.9 percent-of
 Puerto Ricans in New York City 25 years
 of age and older had less than an eighth
 grade education.  In contrast, 29.5 percent
 of the nonwhite population had not finished
 the eighth grade, and only 19.3 percent of the
 other Whites had so low an academic prepara-
 tion'
 If the schools in New York City were to
 correct all of this (the numbers in the second
 generation who have reached adult years is
 still small, only 6.4 percent of persons 20
 years of age and older in 1960), there is still
 evidence that Puerto Rican youth, more
 than any other group, Is severely handicapped
 grants (largely European), it has received lit-
 tle study.  See F. Cordasco and L. Covello,
 "Educational Sociology: A Subject Index of
 Doctoral Dissertations Completed at Ameri-
 can Universities, 1941-83," N.Y., Scarecrow
 Press, 1965. Of over 2,000 dissertations listed,
 only a few clearly concern themselves with
 the non-English immigrant child, or gen-
 erally with the educational problems of the
 children of immigrants.

 Senior, "The Puerto Ricans," Chicago, Quad-
 rangle-Books, 1965, which includes an exten-
 sive  bibliography.  See  also  Christopher
 Rand, "The Puerto Ricans," N.Y., Oxford,

 Rican in New York and Other  Sketches,"

 but invaluable documented study of Puerto
 Ricans in New York City is that of C. Wright
 Mills, Clarence Senior, and Rose Kohn Gold-
 sen, "The Puerto Rican 'Journey,' N.Y., Har-
 per, 1950.

 tical indexes of Puerto Rican poverty (and
 the related needs)  are best assembled In

 ment Project," N.Y., the Puerto Rican Forum,

 in achieving an education in the New York
 City public schools.  A 1961 study of a Man-
 hattan neighborhood showed that fewer than
 10 percent of Puerto Ricans in the 3d grade
 were reading at their grade level or above.
 The  degree  of  retardation  was  extreme.
 Three in ten were retarded 11/2 years or more
 and were, in the middle of their third school
 year, therefore, reading at a level only ap-
 propriate for entry into the second grade.
 By the eighth grade the degree of retarda-
 tion was even more severe with almost two-
 thirds  of  the  Puerto  Rican  youngsters
 retarded more than 3 years10
 Of the nearly 21,000 academic diplomas
 granted in 1983, only 831 went to Puerto
 Ricans and 762 to Negroes, representing only
 1.6 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, of
 the total academic diplomas.  In contrast,
 Puerto Ricans received. 7.4 percent of the
 vocational school diplomas, and Negroes, 15.2
 percent.  For the Puerto Rican community,
 these figures have critical significance since
 Puerto Rican children constituted in 1963
 about 20 percent of the public elementary
 school register; 18 percent of the junior high
 school register; and in keeping with long
 discerned trends, Puerto Rican youngsters
 made up 23 percent of the student body in
 vocational schools and 29 percent of that in
 special (difficult) schooled
 Clearly, the critical issue for the Puerto
 Rican community is the education of its
 children, for the experience in New York
 City is a macrocosm which illustrates all the
 facets of the mainland experience.
 III. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO MEET THE NEEDS
 OF PUERTO RICAN CBU,DREN
 In the last decade a wide range of articles
 have reported special educational programs
 to meet the needs of Puerto Rican children; 19
 although many of these have been of value,
 the more ambitious theoretic constructs have
 largely come from the school boards and
 staffs which, have had todeal with the basic
 problem of communication in classes where
 a growing (and at times preponderant) num-
 ber of Spanish-speaking children were found.
 As early as 1951 in New York City, a mayor's
 Advisory Committee onPuertoRican Affairs
 turned its attention to this major problem

 by the Research Center, Columbia University
 School of Social Work.
 11 "Puerto Rican Community Development
 Project," p. 41, and tables, pp. 43-44.
 12 The situation would not be significantly
 different in other cities where the Puerto
 Rican community is encapsulated in pov-
 erty, e.g., Camden, N.J., Philadelphia, Chi-
 cago.  A different dimension would be added
 in the educational problems presented in
 those areas where Puerto Rican migrant
 workers, contracted for agricultural labor,
 live for varying periods of time.  The best
 source of information on the Puerto Rican
 agricultural migrant worker is the Migra-
 tion Division, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
 See footnote No. 3, supra.  The New Jersey
 Office of Economic Opportunity completed a
 study of the needs of migrant workers in that,
 State In terms of its projected programs. The
 report  ("Herdman Report")  has  not yet
 (October 1965) been released.

 Sion. I do not believe, from what I saw,
 that freedom can be bought cheaply in
 that troubled part of the world, but I
 believe  we  are inspiring  confidence
 among our ? SEATO allies and that our
 enemies and our friends know that we
 mean what we say and that we are not
 afraid to fight to keep our commitments.
 The distinguished Senators from Ohio
 and Maryland, Senator Youso, and Sen-
 ator BREWSTER, with whom I was as-
 sociated, looked long and hard into re-
 ports of shortages of ammunition, boots,
 and other equipment, and were unable
 to substantiate any claims of deficiency.
 On the contrary, it seemed to me that
 our boys were being supplied with the
 finest materiel available and the equip-
 nent was suitable for accomplishment of
 their mission.
 I found morale extremely high but
 one question continued to arise wher-
 ever we were able to visiting the fighting
 men. It was one of concern, disappoint-
 ment, disillusionment, and sometimes
 anger over the student demonstrations
 and the mockery of draft cards which
 has been so much in the news of late.
 I could not help but wonder what
 our enemies must think, let alone what
 our friends wonder when they learn of
 these outrageous misuses of the priv-
 ileges of citizenship.
 Of course, I attempted to explain that
 these vulgar and sickeningly unpatriotic
 gestures were the rare exceptions and
 not the rule among our youth and on
 our campuses. I still believe that, but I
 do not think we can minimize the dam-
 age and misunderstandings that these
 wanton acts provoke.
 The magnitude of our effort in help-
 ing the South Vietnamese achieve both
 military and political stability is truly
 impressive. American ingenuity is being
 demonstrated every day in the construc-
 tion of airfields, ports, communications
 networks, and the coordination of all
 these factors in a manner which will in-
 spire confidence and create the neces-
 sary morale to sustain the people of that
 troubled country.  It is true that the
 performance of our allies in this fight
 has so far been disappointing, but I hope
 that in due time they will be inspired,
 as were all of us on this visit, with the
 example of the South Korean nation,
 which sent a division, including marines,
 to South Vietnam, and plans to step up
 its fighting personnel there to 20,000
 men.
 It seems to me, Mr. President, that
 each clay brings additional strength to
 our resolve to strive toward an honor-
 able peace without weakening our de-
 termination  to  discourage aggression.
 As a result of this trip, I am convinced
 more than ever before that our active
 presence in southeast Asia is the only
 acceptable course, and the correct one
 .for this Nation.

 Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware.  Madam
 President, may I ask the Senator from.
 Louisiana if I am correct in my under-
 standing that these are technical amend-
 ments only?
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  They are
 purely technical.  They correct language
 that should be corrected.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 question is on agreeing to the amend-
 ments of the Senator from Louisiana en
 bloc.
 The amendments were agreed to en
 bloc.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The

 AMENDMENT NO.  474
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  Madam President, I
 ask the clerk to state an amendment
 which I have at the desk, but before the
 clerk reads the amendment, let me say
 that substitute numbers should be in-
 serted at the appropriate places, because
 the original pagination followed the orig-
 inal bill.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The

 "SEc. 10. Section 213 of the Sugar Act of
 1943, as amended, is amended to read as
 follows:
 "'IMPORT FEES
 'SEC. 213. (a) Except as hereinafter pro-
 vidW, as a condition for importing sugar
 into the United States under this Act from
 any foreign country, an import fee, com-
 puted as provided in subsection (b), shall, be
 paid to the United States by the person
 applying to the Secretary for entry and re-
 lease of such sugar.  Payment of such fee
 shall be made in accordance with regulations
 promulgated by the Secretary.  This sub-
 section shall not apply to sugar imported
 from the Republic of the Philippines or from
 any country in the Western Hemisphere
 (other than any possession, protectorate, or
 dependency of France or the United King-
 dom).
 "'(b) The import fee under subsection (a)
 with respect to any auger imported into the
 United States under tlJ,s Act shall be an
 amount (computed on a per pound, raw
 value basis) equal to the amount by which
 the domestic price for raw auger on the date
 of importation exceeds the higher of--
 " ' (1) the world market price for raw sugar
 on the date of importation (determined by
 the Secretary and adjusted for freight to
 New York, insurance, and customs duties
 imposed by the United States), or
 11 1 (2) the average world market price for
 raw,sugar during the 15-year period preced-
 ing the year of importation (determined by
 the Secretary and adjusted for freight to New
 York, insurance, and customs duties and im-
 port taxes imposed by the United States).
 " "(c) The import fees received by the Sec-
 retary under subsection (a) shall be covered
 into the Treasury into a special fund to be
 known as the Alliance for Progress Fund.
 There  are  authorized  to  be  appropriated
 from such Fund, solely for the purposes of
 the Alliance for Progress, such amounts as
 may from time to time be provided by ap-
 propriation Acts.' "
 ANALYSIS OF AMENDMENT
 Mr.               DOUGLAS. Madam President,
 the amendment which I have suggested
 would not affect the domestic beet and
 cane sugar programs, nor would it affect
 the allocation and payment on sugar with
 respect to the Philippines, which is regu-
 lated by treaty.
 The amendment would not impose an
 import fee on any, sugar coming from
 the Western Hemisphere with the excep-
 tion of the French colonial possessions
 and the British colonial possessions; but
 it would impose an import fee on sugar
 corning from countries outside the West-
 ern Hemisphere and on what comes from
 the British West Indies and the French
 West Indies.
 In all, the amendment would impose
 import fees on 471,98;1 tons allocated to
 countries outside the Western Hemis-
 phere and on the 126,017 tons allocated
 to the British West Indies, and British
 Honduras.
 The French West Indies are included in
 the tabulation under "French" and out-
 side the Western Hemisphere, which is a
 printer's  error.  It  would,  therefore,
 apply to approximately 598,000 tons out
 of the total.
 The amendment would levy this import
 fee on the difference between a 15-year
 moving average of the world price, which
 would be 4.22 cents, plus the shipping
 cost and insurance cost of about half a
 cent a pound, plus the tariff of five-
 eighths of a cent, or a total of approxi-
 mately 5.3 cents a pound.
 The present price is $6.85, so there
 would be a return of approximately one-
 half cent a pound or $30 a ton, or on just
 short of 600,000 tons, about $18 million,
 if my arithmetic is correct.
 That money, of course, would not be
 appropriated automatically.  We have
 no authority to appropriate it now, but
 it would go into a fund, and we would
 authorize appropriations from that fund
 for the Alliance for Progress.
 LATIN AMERICA BETTER OFF UNDER AMENDMENT
 I point out that Latin America would
 come out much better under the plan
 which I am suggesting than under the
 plan proposed by the Committee on
 Finance, for Latin America would re-
 ceive everything which it would other-
 wise get.  The independent countries of
 Latin America would be receiving every-
 thing they would, be getting under the
 administration bill, the Senate bill, or
 the I-louse bill.  In addition, they would
 be getting the import fees collected from
 suga-r imported from outside the hemi-
 sphere.  This money would go to the
 common people of Latin America instead
 of to the rich landlords, as is contem-
 plated in the bill proposed by the Com-
 mittee on Finance.
 First, I wish to take up the question
 as to what economic responsibility, if
 any, in the form of sugar subsidies we
 have to countries outside the Western
 Hemisphere.  I know of none.  We as-
 sume no automatic military or economic
 protection over them.
 Australia is an independent country,
 and an extremely prosperous country.
 They do not need aid.  They would not
 ask for aid.  They would be offended if
 aid were suggested.
 Formosa is a republic, to which we no
 longer give economic aid.
 South Africa is a country to which we
 owe no obligation.  As the great gold-
 producing area of the world it needs no
 artificial stimulants. I believe it pro-
 duces at least two-thirds of the gold
 supply of the world. It has enough pur-
 chasing power to buy materials from the
 rest of the world.
 With respect to India, I have always
 supported aid to India. I believe that I
 was the first Senator to come to the sup-
 port of Senator HUMPHREY over a decade
 ago when he began his campaign first, to
 give wheat to India, and then, when he
 was prevented from doing that, to sell
 wheat to India in soft currency terms.
 That is putting food in the mouths of
 Indians.
 But this proposal would take nutri-
 ment away from the mouths of Indian
 children.  It calls on India to export
 sugar and deprives its own people of
 sugar. It may be too much sugar.
 This is supposed to be one cause for
 American obesity.  But the Indians are
 not troubled, or very few of them are
 troubled, with obesity. They have trou-
 ble with malnutrition and they need all
 the-calories they can get from the sugar
 which we would take away from them.
 We would be taking away nourishment
 of sugar from the mouths of Indian chil-
 dren in order to put money in the pock-
 ets of Indian landlords.
 As to the Fiji Islands, which are al-
 lotted 35,489 tons, I believe Senator FUL-
 BRIGHT is quite correct when he says that
 all the sugar in the Fiji Islands is owned
 by one big Australian company.
 There are the Mauritius with about
 15,000 tons. I am told we have a track-
 ing station there.  We can buy sugar
 from them but buy it at the 15-year-
 average world price.
 WHY HELP SOUTHERN RHODESIA?
 Then, there is Southern Rhodesia,
 which is down for 6,000 tons. Earlier to-
 day I mentioned the fact, which is known
 to all, that Southern Rhodesia is in a
 critical period in which the white su-
 premacy government representing some
 250,000 white settlers in Rhodesia is
 threatening to secede from the British
 Empire. The British Government is car-
 rying out the policy previously an-
 nounced by the Tory government, name-
 ly, that they will resist with all methods
 short of physical force the declaration
 of independence and in effect will apply
 economic sanctions to Rhodesia if they
 carry through this program.
 In the United Nations a few days ago,
 Ambassador Goldberg proposed that we
 should condemn Rhodesia if it attempted
 to secede from the British Empire. Mr.
 Goldberg clearly foresaw the possible in-
 flammatory effects of such a secession,
 the aim of which would be to impose
 the white rule of 250,000 white people
 upon 4 million blacks, for an indefinite
 future, which might touch off a racial
 struggle through all of Africa, including
 South Africa and the new black republics
 of Central Africa.
 I believe Ambassador Goldberg's po-
 sition is correct. I am very. glad that the
 United Nations, by a vote of 107 to 2, ap-
 proved the resolution. I was cheered also
 by the fact that press dispatches from
 London indicated that the U.S. Govern-
 ment was alining itself with the British
 Government in its opposition to Rhode-
 sian secession.  There is the possibility
 that, faced with British opposition, faced
 with the United Nations opposition, and
 faced with the American opposition, Mr.
 Smith will have second thoughts and that
 his white supremacy party will not force
 secession.
 They are going through a period of
 agonizing reappraisal, so to speak, in
 Salisbury, Rhodesia, and in other sec-
 tions of that country.
 We say to them: "Enter into the
 charmed circle.  We will give you 6,000
 tons of sugar with a subsidy, at the pres-
 ent time, of $72 a ton, and, on present

 produce, even though we do not produce
 an acre of that product in Louisiana,
 because I believe that every farmer is
 entitled to a decent living.
 Mr. BASS.  I agree wholeheartedly
 with the Senator from Louisiana.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  I have sup-
 ported and will continue to support meas-
 ures which will help every farmer in
 every part of this country, whether the
 crop he produces is a great amount or
 very small compared to those grown in
 Louisiana. Fortunately, under the Sugar
 Act, and the amendments to it, we have
 kept sugar under such complete con-
 trol-
 Mr. BASS.  It is a monopoly.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  It has been
 under control.  There area great num-
 ber of companies which produce sugar
 but they are completely controlled. We
 not only control the acres the farmer can
 plant, but we also control the amount of
 sugar he can produce. So that there is
 control on both ends. In other commodi-
 ties, the farmer can plow on more fer-
 tilizer using less acreage, and produce
 more wheat, or corn-
 Mr. BASS.. Or tobacco.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  Or cotton;
 and he can sell it. But in sugarbeet and
 sugarcane areas, no matter how much
 the farmer fertilizes or increases his
 produce, if he produces more he is stuck
 with it.
 Mr. BASS.  He can'feed it to the cat-
 tle, which cannot be done with a com-
 modity such as tobacco.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  Yes, he can
 feed it to the cattle, but it is expensive
 to feed it to cattle.  They cannot eat
 sugarcane. It must be squeezed out and,
 by the time it has been processed, it be-
 comes a most expensive feed.
 Mr. BASS.  Let me capsule what I
 wish to say, because I wish to impress
 upon the Senator from Louisiana-who
 Is one of the leaders not only in the
 Senate but also in handling sugar legis-
 lation-that we in Tennessee would like
 to have a sugar quota, and I hope that
 the, Senator will use his influence with
 the powers that be who distribute quotas
 to try to see if he cannot get one for
 Tennessee.  We would like to produce
 sugar down there.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  I shall be
 glad to cooperate in every way I can, with
 the understanding that it does not come
 off the Louisiana quota.
 Mr. BASS.  I understand completely.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  We could
 take it off the quota of South Africa or
 the Fiji Islands, or some other country,
 perhaps, so that we could give a quota to
 Tennessee.
 Mr. BASS. I have the greatest respect
 for the refining industry, as I have for
 all other industries, but they do not have
 a vote on the Senate floor, so that we do
 not have to worry too much about that.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana. The Senator
 would be surprised how many votes they
 have in the House of Representatives.
 Mr. BASS. -I worked on this kind of
 legislation in the House for 8 years, so I
 understand a little of the mechanics in
 the committee there, but we wish to
 please them now.
 No. 195-14
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Let me say
 that I should like to be helpful In what
 the Senator is seeking to achieve, with
 the understanding that I would not want
 to prevent us from having a sugar in-
 dustry, or the necessary sugar legisla-
 tion.  That is one of the factors with
 which we sometimes have to contend.
 We have to get the various elements of
 the industry together, in order to get a
 Sugar Act passed at all in Congress.
 Mr. BASS.  There is a way we can
 restrict to a degree the influence of the
 refineries in distributing quotas.
 There is one thing that disturbs me,
 and since the Senator has brought it up,
 I should like to say, regarding the cri-
 teria established by the Department in
 issuing quotas under the 1962 act, that
 the Department stated that, if Tennessee
 could get a mill that would process and
 manufacture sugar, it could get a quota.
 In my opinion, this is largely strictly up
 to the refineries, because they can say to
 the Department, "We do not wish to go
 to this area and build a factory."
 By that action, they could veto the
 establishment of a new sugar quota.
 This should be reversed.  The Secretary
 should say to a factory producing sugar
 in a given area, "If you do not wish to
 go in and manufacture it, then we are
 going to move you out from where you
 are and you will not have any authority
 to manufacture, because this business
 of  controlling  the  establishment  of
 quotas should not be in the hands of
 the refiners."
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  The last
 time we passed a sugar act in Congress
 it was done because we were then able
 to bring in new areas and increase the
 acreage. We did it in that bill.
 Mr. BASS.  That is correct.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  So far as
 this Senator is concerned, when we are
 in a position to expand acreage, I would
 expect to vote to take in new producing
 areas; but in a bill such as this, where
 those of us from the cane producing
 areas have been asked to take a 13-per-
 cent cut, we cannot be expected to be
 favorable to bringing in new producing
 areas.
 Mr. BASS.  I can understand that
 under present circumstances, but I hope,
 if the growth factor changes the situa-
 tion, the Senator will help us do some-
 thing along that line.
 I appreciate the courtesy of the Sena-
 tor from Oregon in yielding to me.  I
 know he has an important message to
 deliver.  I shall listen to him with in-
 PROTESTS  AGAINST  VIETNAM
 POLICIES
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, the agi-
 tation in today's news about the nature
 of the Vietnam protests and the action
 of the U.S. Government to suppress
 them is indicative of the use of a straw
 man by both sides.
 The youthful protestors who ignore the
 many means of peaceful and orderly
 protest open to them under the first
 amendment to the Constitution, are af-
 fording to the entire Nation the oppor-
 26419
 tunity to dismiss all dissent from Gov-
 ernment policy as lawless, reckless, and
 bordering on sedition.
 The near hysteria with which these
 demonstrations are being met by Gov-
 ernment officials suggests that they are
 anxious to tag all dissent as lawless,
 reckless, and bordering on sedition.  To
 bring the full weight of Government pol-
 lice power down upon a few noticeable
 individuals can, they hope, spread dis-
 repute to the whole idea of dissent or ob-
 jection to a policy in Vietnam that is
 producing not peace but only war and
 the prospect of more war.
 I do not doubt that the agitators on
 the one hand and their prosecutors on
 the other serve each other's purposes
 quite well.  Many of the youths about
 whom the public has been reading so
 much in recent days have for their pur-
 pose little more than agitation, lead-
 ing to jail. There are ample laws on the
 books to deal with anyone who evades or
 resists the draft, and these young men
 know that perfectly well.  If that is
 their chosen means of expression, the
 law will deal with them.
 And the administration, too, needs an
 extremist and violent faction against
 which to act, for then it can act with
 something like public support.  No one
 can condone violation of the law in the
 form of evasion or resistance to selective
 service.  For those who are bona fide
 conscientious objectors, the law permits
 an alternative to combat service.  But
 the right to violate selective service laws
 because of a disagreement with the use
 to which they are put cannot gain sup-
 port or approval in this country.                                                                                                   There-
 fore, the administration is safe in crack-
 ing down on that type of dissent from its
 Vietnam war. I expect that in the weeks
 ahead, the Nation will be treated to a
 vast public relations campaign that will
 seek to create the impression that any-
 one who questions what is being done in
 Vietnam is a draft evader, or is the tool
 or dupe of Communists, or trying to fur-
 ther Communist objectives. A few pros-
 ecutions and a barrage of high-level
 statements will be central features of the
 campaign.
 It is in these terms that the admin-
 istration thinks it can best consolidate
 public support for its war.
 RIGHT OF PROTEST IS PROTECTED BY
 CONSTITUTION
 In this situation, it is well for those of
 us who believe our Vietnam policy is aid-
 ing the Communist cause in the long run
 to remember that there ample means of
 registering protest, means that are pro-
 tected by the first amendment to the
 Constitution.
 These means have been protected time
 and again by the Federal police power in
 the last decade when they were used in
 connection with civil rights.  They take
 the form of peaceful, nonviolent protest.
 It is the sound of feet marching in pro-
 test, the use of the right of peaceful as-
 sembly, and of petition that are pro-
 tected not only by the Federal courts,
 but by the same FBI and Justice Depart-
 ment that are now investigating the vio-
 lation of draft laws and other forms of

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE         October 19, 1965
 illegal or violent action In connection
 with Vietnam demonstrations.
 What America needs to hear is the
 tramp, tramp, tramp of marching feet,
 in community after community, across
 the length and breadth of this land, in
 protest against the administration's un-
 constitutional and illegal war in South
 Vietnam. Those protests must be within
 the law. Those protests must not violate
 the law.  But the administration must
 also act in keeping with the rights of the
 protesters under the first amendment.
 Let me say to the administration that
 it owes a responsibility of seeing to it
 that, under the guarantees of the first
 amendment, the legal rights of the pro-
 testers are protected. I know there will
 be :incidents. That always has happened
 from time immemorial when people have
 protested against what they considered
 to  be  unsound  government  policies.
 Those who violate the law must be held
 accountable to the law. But also I fore-
 warn the administration that it cannot,
 because of the actions of some of these
 demonstrators who may be law violators,
 breach the rights of the legitimate pro-
 testers; that it has the obligation to see
 that the rights of the legitimate pro-
 testers are protected, even though the
 Government itself is violating the Con-
 stitution of this country.
 Beyond that, there, are the rights of
 dissent that are exercised in political
 debate, open and public forums, and
 eventually at the ballot box.
 I say to this -administration that it
 should keep its eye on the ballot box, for,
 In my judgment, there will be an exercise
 of public opinion at that ballot box in
 1966 and 1968, if this administration does
 not reverse itself in its policy of interna-
 tional outlawry, that will awaken this
 administration to what I think is a great
 miscalculation on its part, if it thinks
 that at the grassroots of America the
 people want war and not peace.
 These are means of protest and dissent
 that cannot be squelched by Federal
 police power.  I am satisfied that the
 longer the war in Vietnam fails to pro-
 duce peace, the more these methods of
 dissent will be used by the American
 people, no matter how much the Federal
 authorities try in the meantime to dis-
 credit opposition by condemning and
 campaigning against those who conven-
 iently provide a grounds for criminal
 prosecution.
 Those means should be used.  They
 should be used by an American people
 that wishes to abide by the rule of law.
 They should be used by people who be-
 lieve their Government should itself
 abide by the Constitution of the United
 States, which permits war to be pursued
 only upon a declaration of war by Con-
 gress, and by people who believe that the
 United States must take the lead in
 furthering, not destroying, the rule of
 law in relations among nations.
 It can hardly be wondered at that an
 administration that engages in war In
 violation of the means outlined by the
 Constitution is met with protests taking
 the form of yiolation of the draft laws.
 But jungle law is usually met by more
 jungle law.  This will be true not only
 here at home, but among the nations of
 the world, who we the United States In
 flagrant violation of the United Nations
 Charter.
 PEACEFUL PROTESTS SHOULD CONTINUE
 These events of illegality being coun-
 tered by more illegality should not deter
 the rest of us from continuing our quest
 for a return to the procedures of the
 Constitution and the United Nations
 Charter.  We have ample means for
 making our views known.  There is no
 need to resort to violence or violation of
 the law.
 Some weeks ago I said as much to a
 group of young people who were orga-
 nizing a Vietnam war protest in my home
 State of Oregon.  They were planning a
 sit-in at the Portland post office last
 February, and while I recognize their
 status as adults able to choose their own
 course of action, I commented as I shall
 read.
 At the time of the Incident I discussed
 it on the floor of the Senate, and I dis-
 cussed it last Friday in my speech on the
 floor of the Senate, but I did not have
 the telegram in my possession at the
 time.
 As I said last Friday, the U.S. district
 attorney in Portland, Oreg., called me
 to report what these students were doing.
 He pointed out that it would be neces-
 sary for him to arrest them because, at
 5 o'clock, he would have to close the
 building where they were protesting. He
 told me that he did not like to have to
 arrest them because that arrest would
 be on their record all through their
 adulthood, and he did not think that
 they realized the great mistake they were
 making.
 He said:
 I think they might listen to you.
 I said:
 I am not going to establish the precedent
 of involving myself in every protest in which
 some of the protesters move outside the law
 and do not stay within the framework of
 their legal rights.  But I will send, through
 you, a telegram to them, if you will read it,
 stating once and for all my position in re-
 gard to my dedicated belief that no pro-
 tester has the right to violate the law.
 I shall read the telegram.  I do not
 know if it has had any effect on them
 as to their subsequent conduct, but the
 fact is that subsequent to reading the
 wire they left the building and proceeded
 thereafter to continue their protest with-
 in the law.  The telegram reads as fol-
 lows:
 I am concerned over the reports of com-
 mission of unlawful acts by a group of young
 people In Oregon in an attempt to dramatize
 their disagreement with U.S. policy in Viet-
 nam.
 The use of so-called "civil disobedience"
 techniques  is  not  only  inappropriate  but
 also  highly  ineffective  in  bringing about
 changes in national  policy in a constitu-
 tional democracy.                                                          Students have a right
 freely to publicize their views in a lawful
 manner and may perform a service in mak-
 ing a reasonable presentation in an attempt
 to influence public opinion.  But irrespon-
 sible and unlawful actions do not contribute
 to intelligent discussion of the issues and
 can only hurt the cause which is propounded-
 I do not doubt that the flouting of the
 Constitution and the United Nations Charter
 by the administration through its Vietnam
 policy will breed much more disrespects for
 the draft laws and for the obligations of
 citizens to stick to peaceful means of protest.
 A country that takes the law into its own
 hands is no example for its citizens to do
 differently.
 But there is no justification, in my
 opinion, for any young man in this coun-
 try to violate the law by burning draft
 cards, or by defying the draft; then the
 youth who is able to establish that he is
 a conscientious  objector within  the
 meaning of the existing law is not exempt
 from a substitute service.
 Let there be no mistake.  The Senator
 from Oregon holds no brief for these law
 violators who are using these means of
 protest against our war policies in South
 Vietnam.  I condemn it.   To those who
 protest within the law I say you must
 not be dissuaded by the scofflaws be-
 cause we are going to have extremists in
 our administration who "'ill smear the
 lawful along with the unlawful.
 But there are many Americans who
 recognize where such a course is going
 to take this country if it continues In
 its course of action.  Many of us recog-
 nize that it is this country that has the
 most to gain in world affairs by adher-
 ing to a standard of respect for the
 United Nations and for International
 agreements and insisting that others do
 the same.  To the extent that we depart
 from that standard in our international
 conduct, we damage our long-range pur-
 poses and objectives.
 We are fighting in Vietnam without
 benefit of a declaration of war.  That
 alone cannot help but breed disrespect
 for our domestic laws among those who
 disagree with the policy.  But we are
 fighting that war in violation of the
 United Nations Charter, and that is going
 to breed disrespect for peaceful settle-
 ment of disputes among all nations, not
 the least of them the new nations of the
 world we are so anxious to influence and
 to guide in the ways of adherence to the
 rule of law.
 EFFECT ON MORALE OF U.S. FORCES
 Much will be heard, and has already
 been heard, about dissent at home hav-
 ing a demoralizing effect upon American
 forces fighting in Vietnam.  This argu-
 ment has nothing to do with the right-
 ness or wrongness, or success or failure,
 of a policy, but is supposed only to shut
 off comment.  If it does, then the su-
 premacy of the military over the civilian
 in government will truly be established
 in this country.
 I hope the time will never come when
 the wisdom of sending American soldiers
 into a war situation will become a for-
 bidden subject of discussion.  I hope the
 time will never come when the purpose
 of sending American soldiers into battle
 will be a forbidden topic among the
 civilians who support them and who
 may eventually have to join them.  I
 hope the time will never come when the
 objective to be achieved by war is no
 longer a fit matter of debate, because if
 it is, the men who think they have gone
 10,000 miles away to serve American
 interests will have gone in vain.
 I repeat my position In connection
 with supporting the fighting men in
 South Vietnam.

 There have been Senators who have
 said, "Are you not pretty much boxed in,
 because You are in a position where you
 will have to vote against appropriations
 for the war in Vietnam?"
 I have.said that I shall vote for ap-
 propriations for the war in Vietnam only
 because it is my trust and duty to provide
 the maximum protection for our troops
 In whatever situation they find them-
 selves.  They are not there on their voli-
 tion but on the volition of their civilian
 I shall continue to protest the war. I
 shall continue to vote against giving the
 President any vote of confidence for
 what I think is his inexcusable course of
 action involving us.in the war in South
 Vietnam in the absence of a declaration
 of war.
 That has been my policy.  I voted for
 the defense appropriation bill.  I voted
 against the President's two requests for a
 vote of confidence. Although it was
 concealed, he frankly admitted that he
 sent up the request to compel a vote of
 confidence, and said at the time he did
 not need the $700 million, because he had
 transfer power.  When he sent a bill
 based upon his need to finance the war
 in South Vietnam, I voted for the appro-
 priation bill, but at the same time I filed
 again what I am filing this afternoon,
 my protest to his course of action in
 southeast Asia.
 I repeat that protest, because it needs
 to be repeated, in view of the tremendous
 propaganda drive that is being conducted
 against those of us who are protesting
 the outlawry of our Government, the vio-
 lation by our Government of our Consti-
 tution, the violation by our Government
 of the United Nations Charter.
 The propaganda, of course, continues
 to mount.  However, the senior Senator
 from Oregon will continue to protest, in
 the hope that at long last my country
 will return to the rule of law and that
 my country will return to keeping its
 pledges to its ideals in regard to the
 settlement of disputes that threaten the
 peace of the world through existing pro-
 cedures which are designed to promote
 settlement by peaceful means, rather
 than by bullets.
 That is the position which I ' stated
 last night at Princeton University, which
 I stated last Saturday in my own State,
 and which I have stated over and over
 again across the country, and will con-
 tinue to state.
 The views of those who are protesting
 the administration's course of action will
 never receive the attention or the em-
 phasis that the propaganda of the ad-
 ministration, coming out by the reams
 from the Pentagon and the State Depart-
 ment and the White House, receives on
 the desks of American editors-the same
 editors who are remarkably silent on the
 censorship that has been imposed upon
 American war correspondents to a de-
 gree never before experienced in the his-
 tory of American Journalism and Amer-
 ican foreign policy.
 I can well understand why the guilty
 consciences of so many editors cause
 them to follow the propaganda line of
 the administration.
 But there are some who do not, and I
 shall have something to say about editors
 who have demonstrated that they un-
 derstand the importance of preserving
 another great constitutional freedom in
 this country-the freedom of the press.
 I shall discuss them briefly before I fin-
 ish.
 I wish to make clear once more my
 views as to why this administration is
 not declaring war.  There are two main
 reasons, as I have said many times.  The
 administration knows that to ask Con-
 gress for a declaration of war would start
 a historic debate at the grassroots of
 America.  The  administration      would
 soon come to recognize that the Ameri-
 can people want peace, not war.
 Second, a declaration of war would
 completely change the international law
 relationships immediately with every
 noncombatant nation in the world. The
 administration knows that.  The admin-
 istration knows that those relationships
 with every other country would change
 overnight, if war were declared, because
 then the United States would be treated
 as a combatant.  Other countries would
 have to deal with us as a combatant.
 That would cause great changes in trade
 policies.  It would cause great changes,
 for example, In the relationship between
 the United States and the British Com-
 monwealth in North Vietnam, and be-
 tween the United States and Canada in
 North Vietnam.
 It would change the relationships be-
 tween the United States and France,
 the United States and Italy, and the
 United States and every other country in
 every area of the world that could be con-
 sidered an area of the war. In my judg-
 ment, that, probably more than any-
 thing else, is of great concern to the ad-
 ministration.
 But that does not justify the President
 of the United States making war with-
 out a declaration of war.  That is why
 there is a need, not only for the offi-
 cials of the executive branch of the Gov-
 ernment, but for Members of Congress,
 as well, to reread that great war mes-
 sage of Woodrow Wilson of April 2, 1917,
 when he came before a joint session of
 Congress and read his recommendations
 for a declaration of war, stating in the
 message that he was without the con-
 stitutional authority to make war in the
 absence of a declaration of war. He was
 right. That is why I have recommended
 that officials of the executive branch of
 the Government and Members of Con-
 gress again read the great war message
 of Franklin Delano Roosevelt following
 Pearl Harbor, when Franklin Roosevelt
 also pointed out that without a declara-
 tion of war he was without authority to
 make war, and recommended his rea-
 sons for asking for a declaration of war.
 That, from the very beginning of this
 historic debate, has been the position of
 the senior Senator from Oregon.
 The effort to suppress debate about
 the Vietnam war is taking increasingly
 blatant forms. One reason why the talk
 about morale has become necessary is
 the lack of general support for the war
 at the grassroots of America. The only
 time support for the war can be gained
 26421
 is when it is described as forcing the
 Vietcong to negotiate. But they are not
 negotiating; and that calls for a scape-
 goat.
 Read the polls. Read the interesting
 semantics.  Read the way the questions
 are put in the polls, with a subtlety that
 is easily detected.  The person ques-
 tioned is left with the impression that
 the administration's policy is the way to
 attain peace.
 A part of the burden of the argument
 of the senior Senator from Oregon is
 that making war will never attain peace.
 In my judgment, there is no battle in
 South Vietnam that the American mili-
 tary force we have there, which is now
 taking over the war, cannot win.  As I
 have said many times, we are shooting
 fish in a barrel.  Our so-called opposi-
 tion is without an air force, it is with-
 out a navy, it is without heavy artillery,
 it is without tanks. Of course it cannot
 possibly stand up to American military
 force.
 But when we finish winning, when we
 finish leveling, when we finish devastat-
 ing South and North Vietnam, will we
 have won a peace?  I am satisfied that
 history will say that we have removed
 for decades the possibility of winning a
 peace.  History will show that after all
 the military victories which we shall
 win, and after that time has passed, we
 shall still have to occupy, occupy, and
 continue to occupy areas of Asia. Then,
 sooner or later, we will be driven out.
 That may occur 25 or 50 years from now.
 But I do not want to leave that herit-
 age to future generations of American
 boys and girls. That is why I have been
 urging the stopping of the killing.  I
 have been urging multilateral support
 for peacekeeping.  I have been urging
 that we bring in multilateral forces. I
 think we have been reduced now, with
 the failure of SEATO, and with the ap-
 parent impossibility of reconvening the
 14-nation conference that established
 the Geneva accords in the first place, to
 resorting to the Security Council of the
 United Nations, and from there, if there
 should be a veto, to the General As-
 sembly. I am confident that if we have
 to go to the General Assembly, we will
 get an overwhelming majority of sup-
 port                                                                                                for  peacekeeping  operations  in
 South Vietnam.
 I believe that that will lead, first, to
 a cease-fire, and then to the establish-
 ment of some form of administration
 for that area of the world, which can be
 called, for want of a better description,
 a United Nations trusteeship.  But it
 will provide for a termination of hostili-
 ties. That Is what the war hawks in the
 United States do not like. That is what
 the nationalists in the United States do
 not want. It is interesting how we talk
 about nationalism in Asia but so little
 about America's own nationalism.
 Mr. President, our operations in south-
 east Asia are operations based upon na-
 tionalism, and nationalism, in my judg-
 ment, has no place in our foreign policy
 when It comes to the course of action
 which we are following in southeast
 Asia.

 If we accept it on a multilateral ap-
 proach, and change the status from that
 of warmaking to peacekeeping, of course
 the Communists will have a voice in the
 determination of operations  during a
 period of time, for however many years it
 may take to finally determine what kind
 of system of government shall prevail.
 Yes.  I, too, would like to wishfully
 think the Communists off the earth. I,
 too, would like to go to sleep some night
 and wake up in the morning and have a
 dream come true during the night that
 there are no more Communists.  How-
 ever, they happen to be an ugly reality.
 We are not going to wishfully think them
 out of existence. We are never going to
 be able to shoot them out of existence,
 for the more shooting we do, the more
 Communists we make.
 The U.S. shooting in southeast Asia,
 in my judgment, has increased the num-
 ber of Communists in the world by the
 millions.
 The underdeveloped areas of the world,
 with their mass of ignorant, illiterate
 people, with their youngsters and, in
 many instances, their starving people,
 with their diseased children, and with
 their longevity of 30 to 35 years do not
 intend to permit the United States to
 shoot its way into dominion and domi-
 nation over any segment of Asia.
 If we have not learned what the
 French, the British, the Dutch, and the
 Belgians and the other colonial powers
 have learned from the pages of history
 'at such a great cost in blood and ma-
 teriel, then, let me say most respectfully,
 'that we do not wish to learn.  However,
 I believe that we have a trust, and I
 think that our trust is to keep faith with
 our ideals.  Our trust is to practice our
 professings about morality.
 We are a great people to ring church
 bells.  However, we had better be on
 guard that the church bells do not start
 tolling the decline of America.  I want
 to ring the church bells, too, but I want
 to ring them in jubilation over our prac-
 ticing of the spiritual teachings from the
 pulpits of those churches.
 In my judgment, we cannot reconcile
 America's foreign policy in South Viet-
 nam with Christianity, nor, for that mat-
 ter, with any other religion that believes
 in one Supreme Being.
 IC will not be silenced in his constant
 plea for peace as a substitute for the
 jungle law of military might that the
 United States is practicing in southeast
 Asia.
 :[n my judgment, the only time that
 support for the war can be gained is
 when it is described as forcing the Viet-
 cong to negotiate.  However, they are
 not negotiating. That calls for a scape-
 goat in the administration's propaganda.
 It is an American characteristic that
 when a U.S. foreign policy fails to achieve
 its goal, someone here at home must be
 blamed for it. We had to find Americans
 to blame for the takeover of China by
 the Communists, and then for the take-
 over of Cuba by Castro. By our stand-
 ards, nothing abroad ever happens unless
 some American or group of Americans
 -wills it.  If an American policy flops, it
 is only because it was sabotaged by some-
 one in the State Department, or was de-
 signed to fail in the first place, or was
 frustrated by some other Americans.
 Today, we are seeing the failure of the
 "peace through war" policy in Vietnam
 being blamed upon those Americans who
 simply disagree that peace in Asia can
 be achieved by a unilateral American war
 effort. The longer the war is stalemated,
 the more blame will be placed upon those
 who thought it was misconceived in the
 first place.
 But I am confident that the good sense
 and judgment of the American people
 will recognize that we are alone in this
 war in Asia, and that despite all our
 claims that we are saving Asia from com-
 munism, not a single major Asian coun-
 try is fighting with us.
 When the Pope made his appeal for
 peace, he did not make it to the Pen-
 tagon, or even the White House.  He
 made it to the United Nations. Many of
 the phony sophisticates in high office are
 given to nodding at speeches like that of
 Pope Paul, and intimating that while the
 Pope had to say all that churchy stuff, it
 is really a question of who has the power
 to make their views prevail in the world.
 That is the attitude of the war hawks.
 That is the position of the warmongers.
 Like Stalin before them, many Americans
 are wont to ask how many divisions the
 Pope has.
 But I do not believe that Pope Paul
 came to this country on a fool's errand.
 I think he knew the right place to come,
 the right words to say, and the right ap-
 peal to make to further the cause of
 peace. The United States stands outside
 theframework of the United Nations to-
 day. Until we get back in it with regard
 to Vietnam, we are not furthering the
 cause of peace any more than the Com-
 munists are.
 It is regrettable that those who be-
 lieve in lawful protest under the first
 amendment are bound to be smeared by
 two forces in this country.  The first
 force is the small group of agitators or
 outright Communists who undoubtedly,
 whenever we have a situation of protest,
 would seek to termite their way into
 the - foundation.   However, our  FBI
 knows who they are.  Our intelligence
 service knows who they are.
 They are such a small minority that
 those of us who believe that we have a
 trust and a duty to carry on our life
 under the first amendment must con-
 tinue the protest.  The senior Senator
 from Oregon intends to so continue.
 Then, of course, we are smeared by the
 rightists and extremists within the ad-
 ministration and outside the administra-
 tion who would seek to create the im-
 pression that, unless one bends his knee
 at the altar of the political expediency
 of this administration and sanctions
 what he considers to be wrongful acts
 in the field of foreign policy, he is guilty
 of some kind of sedition.
 I have been called names before, and
 I have never surrendered to ad hominem
 arguments, and I do not intend to do so
 on this occasion. I intend to continue,
 short of a declaration of war, to protest,
 in the hope that, at long last, my ad-
 ministration will change its course of
 action and proceed to lay this whole
 threat to the peace of the world before
 the Security Council and call upon it, as
 the charter provides, to take jurisdic-
 tion over this threat to the peace of the
 world in Asia.
 The general thesis of my remarks ap-
 pears in an editorial published in this
 morning's Washington Post entitled:
 "Demonstrators and the Law."'
 I shall read certain excerpts from the
 editorial and then, when I close, I shall
 have the entire editorial printed in the
 RECORD.
 The editorial begins:
 The Department of Justice is properly in-
 terested in and concerned about the possi-
 bility of a Communist conspiracy to, obstruct
 the operation of the draft law.  It ought to
 conduct an appropriate investigation, make
 arrests where warranted, and institute pros-
 ecutions where required.
 The senior Senator from Oregon agrees.
 The senior Senator from Oregon wants
 to make very clear that where one can
 advance proof to show that we have
 those-not only Communists, but any-
 one else in the list of protesters-who are
 seeking to violate the law, they should
 be investigated and prosecuted.
 The editorial continues:
 The law is quite clear on the responsi-
 bilities of registered citizens, and burning
 draft cards and illegally avoiding service is
 not an acceptable way of expressing disagree-
 ment with Government policy.
 The senior Senator from Oregon wants
 the RECORD to show that he agrees. How-
 ever, that is a long way from the posi-
 tion taken by some that it would silence
 lawful protest. It is a long way from the
 position taken by-some that no one should
 exercise the constitutional right under
 the first amendment to protest a foreign
 policy of his Government that he thinks
 is a grossly mistaken foreign policy.
 The editorial continues:
 What it ought not to do is to continue il-
 legal defiance and perfectly lawful demon-
 stration.  Nor should it use the fact that
 many of the weekend marchers against the
 war in Vietnam are known Communists to
 discredit the marchers who simply differ with
 Government policies, without being disloyal
 to the country.
 Madam President (Mrs. NEUBERGER in
 the chair), I seriously doubt that many
 of the marchers are known Communists,
 and, if they are, let the FBI present the
 evidence.  I have no doubt that there
 probably was a, sprinkling of them among
 those marchers, but it is easy to build up
 to the false conclusion that because peo-
 ple march in protest to the foreign policy
 of this Government--within the law-
 that they are honeycombed with Com-
 munists.
 The editorial continues:
 Surely  the  overwhelming  number  of  the
 demonstrators . were  not  Communists  and
 many probably withered at their association
 with  Communists  in  the  demonstrations.
 The coercive power of Government law-en-
 forcement agencies must not be used to in-
 hibit disagreement and dissent when the ex-
 pression of that dissent is limited to per-
 fectly lawful means.
 The  senior  Senator  from  Oregon
 agrees and heartily applauds this wise
 observation by the editorial in the Wash-
 ington Post.
 The editorial continues:
 Approved For Release 2003/10/14: CIA-RDP67B00446R000300140005-9

 As a practical matter, the Government
 should be careful to avoid giving the demon-
 strations the attention that ought to be re-
 served for major threats to national unity.
 Demonstrations as large as those held over
 the weekend could be mobilized to protest
 the manufacture, of straight pins on almost
 any pleasant autumn day.  The dissent in
 the country is relatively minor; but the Gov-
 ernment risks exaggerating its significance by
 reacting too strongly.
 I say most respectfully that in my
 judgment, the administration is over-
 reacting as a means of silencing all ob-
 jections to its policy.  The soundings at
 the grassroots of America indicate that
 the dissent is of great proportions, from
 coast to coast.
 The, editorial continues:
 After a long and searching examination of
 the courses available in South Vietnam, the
 overwhelming majority of the American peo-
 ple have come to the conclusion that there is
 no acceptable alternative to the policy the
 Government is pursuing.
 I do not think the Washington Post
 could be more mistaken, Madam Presi-
 dent. In fact, even the polls, with their
 slanted and weighted consideration in
 favor of the administration's position,
 show a close division in this country in
 regard to public opinion vis-a-vis the
 administration policy in South Vietnam.
 The Post says:
 That majority is bound to be impatient
 with critics of that policy whose credentials,
 like those of the Communists, will not stand
 examination. It is likely to resent and prone
 to overreact to extremists who imply that
 their own country is indifferent to considera-
 tions of humanity.  But whatever the ma-
 jority's resentment, it must tolerate criticism
 from those who, in good faith, have a differ-
 ent point of view.
 And so it must. And so, also for the
 sake of discussing a hypothesis, and ac-
 cepting what I consider to be an unsound
 major premise factually, let us assume
 that a majority favors the administra-
 tion's policy at the present time.  One
 of the precious safeguards of freedom in
 this Republic is that a minority must
 not be suppressed in its lawful right to
 change into a majority. This great for-
 eign policy issue is in a state of flux.
 This is one Senator who believes that
 when the American people get the facts-
 and this administration has not started
 to give the American people the facts
 about the war in South Vietnam-when
 they get the facts, in my judgment, an
 overwhelming majority of the American
 people will repudiate the administra-
 tion's policy.  I believe the repudiation
 will start at the ballot box in 1966, and
 continue at the ballot box in 1968. And
 it should, unless this administration
 changes what I consider to be its illegal,
 unconstitutional course of international
 outlawry in South Vietnam, along with
 the Communist nations, which are like-
 wise engaged in outlawry, in their pros-
 ecution of a war. What they should be
 doing on both sides is submitting the
 issues of that war to the council table,
 under the procedures provided for in the
 United Nations Charter.
 Until we are willing to try it, I do not
 accept the argument of those who say it
 will not work. We will never know until
 we try to make it work.
 Madam President, I ask unanimous
 consent that the entire Washington Post
 editorial be printed in the RECORD at this
 point.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Washington Post, Oct. 19, 19661
 DEMONSTRATORS AND THE LAW
 The Department of Justice is properly In-
 terested in and concerned about the possibil-
 ity of a Communist conspiracy to obstruct
 the operation of the draft law.  It ought to
 conduct an appropriate investigation, make
 arrests where warranted and institute prose-
 cutions where, required.  The law is quite
 clear on the responsibilities of registered citi-
 zens, and burning draft cards and illegally
 avoiding service is not an acceptable way of
 expressing disagreement with Government
 policy.
 What it ought not to do is to confuse
 illegal defiance and perfectly lawful demon-
 stration.   Nor should it use the fact that
 many of the weekend marchers against the
 war in Vietnam are known Communists to
 discredit the marchers who  simply differ
 with Government policies, without being dis-
 loyal to their country.   Surely the over-
 whelming number of the demonstrators were
 not Communists and many probably writhed
 at their association with Communists in the
 demonstrations.  The coercive power of Gov-
 ernment law-enforcement agencies must not
 be used to inhibit disagreement and dissent
 when the expression of that dissent is limited
 to perfectly lawful means.
 As a practical matter, the Government
 should be careful to avoid giving the demon-
 strations the attention that ought to be
 reserved for major threats to national unity.
 Demonstrations as large as those held over
 the weekend could be mobilized to protest
 the manufacture of straight pins on almost
 any pleasant autumn day.  The dissent in the
 country is relatively minor; but the Govern-

 is no acceptable alternative to the policy the

 bound to be impatient with critics of that
 policy whose credentials, like those of the
 Communists, will not stand examination.  It
 is likely to resent and prone to overreact
 to extremists who imply that their own coun-
 try is indifferent to considerations of human-
 ity.  But whatever the majority's resentment,
 it must tolerate criticism from those who, in
 good faith, have a different point of view.
 This toleration will be misconstrued in
 North Vietnam.  The officials of the National
 Liberation Front may misinterpret the open
 expression of opposition as a sign of weak-
 ness and division in this country.  It is, on
 the contrary, a sign of strength and unity
 in the country.   The National Liberation
 Front must be made to see that.  Perhaps the
 best way to make this understood would be
 more manifestations of public support for
 the Government's policy that would show
 how united the people of this country are
 behind the Government's determination to
 defend the people of South Vietnam against
 conquest from the North.  It is a better al-
 ternative than any sort of repression of law-
 ful and orderly dissent.
 TRIBUTE TO THE ST. LOUIS POST
 DISPATCH AND THE YORK GA-
 ZETTE AND DAILY
 Mr. MORSE. Turning to another but
 somewhat related matter, Madam Presi-
 dent, I said earlier that I would have
 something to say about some courageous
 editors in America.
 The two newspapers I now mention are
 not the only two which meet the test of
 objectivity and journalistic courage, but
 I know of no two newspapers which I
 would be more inclined to suggest for this
 year's Pulitzer Prize in American jour-
 nalism.  One is that great newspaper,
 the St. Louis Post Dispatch; the second
 is a much smaller but most remarkable
 newspaper for its objectivity, for its pres-
 entation of facts, for its journalistic
 courage-a little newspaper up in York,
 Pa., known as the York Gazette and
 Daily.  I have referred to some of its
 editorials in the past.
 I again pay high honor and tribute to
 the editor of that newspaper, Mr. Hig-
 gins, for I know of no editor in this coun-
 try more daring, more objective, or more
 factual than the editor of the York Ga-
 zette and Daily.
 This afternoon I wish to pay my trib-
 ute once again to the editors of the St.
 Louis Post-Dispatch. On October 14,
 1965, they published an editorial dealing
 with our Latin American policy. I con-
 sider it to be completely sound.  It is
 highly critical of the administration.
 Criticism of the administration is due.
 The editorial, entitled "Lame Rebuttal,"
 reads as follows:
 [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch]
 LAME REBUTTAL
 The Johnson administration would do well
 to stop trying to defend its intervention in
 the Dominican Republic, and start develop-
 ing a hemisphere policy based on something
 more substantial than confused and frantic
 anticommunism.  That is the conclusion we
 draw from Under Secretary of State Mann's
 lame reply to the FULBRIGHT critique of the
 Dominican adventure.
 Mr. Mann did not rebut, he confirmed the
 main points of Senator FULBRIGHT's analysis,
 one of which was that President Johnson in
 this case was the victim of bad advice, poor
 judgment,  and  immature  understanding.
 The Under Secretary exhibits symptoms of
 all three.
 Senator FULBRIGHT concluded, from a care-
 ful study of the facts, that President John-
 son's advisers exaggerated the danger of a
 Communist takeover of the revolt in Santo
 Domingo last April.  He offered evidence to
 support his view.   'Tain't so,  replies Mr.
 Mann; but the evidence he offers is simply
 that all the President's advisers were con-
 vinced that a danger was clear and present.
 There is no argument that the advisers
 were convinced.   The question is whether
 they were correct, and we suspect that Juan
 Bosch will have the last word on that.  He
 has declared that American intervention cre-
 ated more Communists than ever were in-
 volved in the attempt to restore his consti-
 tutional government,  and we expect                                                                                                                                               that
 history will bear him out.
 The basic Issue, however, is not the extent
 of Communist Involvement, but Mr. Mann's
 implicit assumption that Communist involve-
 ment somehow gives the United States an
 automatic license to put down a Latin Ameri-
 can revolt by the unilateral use of American
 armed force.  How can any such doctrine
 possibly be squared with the principle, which
 Mr. Mann himself claims to support, that
 unilateral intervention is illegal under the
 OAS charter and that nonintervention is the
 keystone of the inter-American structure?
 The administration appears to contend
 that any Communist activity in Latin Amer-
 ica must by definition represent intervention

 by a Communist state. But no evidence has
 been presented of any substantial Involve-
 ment in Santo Domingo of Cuba, China, Rus-
 sia, or any other Communist government.  If
 such evidence had existed, the proper re-
 sponse would have been collective action
 under the OAS charter and not unilateral
 action by the United States.  Our Govern-
 ment simply does not have the right to set
 itself up as the sole judge of what kind of
 revolution or reform our . Latin. American
 neighbors shall be permitted. Attempts to
 play this role can only alienate us steadily
 from the peoples of the hemisphere.
 Senator FULBRIGHT was profoundly right in
 saying that the policy followed in Santo Do-
 mingo, consistently pursued, would make the
 United States "the enemy of all revolutions
 and therefore the ally of all the unpopular
 and corrupt oligarchies of the hemisphere."
 When will our leaders learn that, quite apart
 from international law and the treaty obli-
 gations that argue against such a policy, pur-
 suing it in an age of social revolution means
 deliberately choosing the losing side?  There
 are going to be social revolutions in Latin
 America and elsewhere, whether we like it
 or not, and the surest way to encourage
 Communist capture of them is to aline Amer-
 ican armed power everywhere on the side
 of the status quo.                 -
 Madam President, I completely agree
 with the premises stated in the editorial.
 On the very day the tickers began to tell
 the story of the sending of American
 marines to the Dominican Republic, and
 of the story of the protests from Chile,
 Ecuador, Venezuela, and Peru, some of
 our best friends among democratic gov-
 ernments have charged us with inter-
 vention.
 If the marines were being sent in for
 the limited purpose which the Presi-
 dent had announced, he had a right to
 send them in, and sending them in did
 not constitute intervention under the
 meaning of the term in international
 law. For the announcement of the Presi-
 dent was that the marines were being
 sent in to evacuate American nationals
 when the Government of the Dominican
 Republic was supposed to have an-
 nounced to the American Government-
 and we did not know wlirat was subse-
 quently disclosed at the 'Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee hearings on this sub-
 ject--that it could not give protection to
 American nationals.  We did not know
 then, as the Senator from Arkansas [Mr.
 FtrLBRIGHT] has since brought out, that
 the American Ambassador suggested to
 the military junta in the Dominican Re-
 public that such a message be sent.
 Madam President, some of us con-
 sider that course of action to be entirely
 inexcusable on the part of the American
 Ambassador in the Dominican Republic.
 Subsequent events have shown that
 we went far beyond evacuating Ameri-
 can nationals, and that we did take part
 in the revolution.  History will so record.
 :Many editorials published in the St.
 Louis  Post-Dispatch  have  rightfully
 pointed it out.  The Senator from Ar-
 kansas [Mr. FULBRIGHT], chairman of
 the Foreign Relations Committee, has
 also pointed it out.
 :f have agreed with him, as I stated in
 a major speech the day following the
 Madam President, this is another area
 of great controversy in the field of
 American foreign policy.  As I stated
 Friday, and as I repeat today, I hope
 that the American Secretary of State,
 before he arrives in Rio de Janeiro on
 November 17, will clarify our policy, be-
 cause Under Secretary of State Mann, In
 his speech at Los Angeles the other day,
 did not clarify it but only added con-
 fusion to an already very confused
 situation.
 Nevertheless, I said on that day that
 we had the right to send in our marines
 under international law to bring out
 American nationals when we had been
 advised that the government of that
 country could not protect their lives.
 If Senators will read my speech, they
 will see that although I defended my
 President in the sending in of the ma-
 rines to evacuate American nationals, I
 also pointed out that it should not take
 long.  I also pointed out that it would
 not require many marines to do the job.
 I also warned the Johnson administra-
 tion that If it went beyond that purpose,
 It would become involved in the revolu-
 tion itself and would be guilty of inter-
 vention.  Further, by participating In
 any aid to the revolution, it would be In
 violation of the Rio de Janeiro Treaty
 and the Charter of the Organization of
 American States.
 Madam President, what we need be-
 fore the Secretary of State goes to Rio
 do Janeiro is a clear-cut statement from
 the State Department that we stand
 foursquare on our commitments under
 the Rio de Janeiro Treaty, the Charter of
 the Organization of American States, the
 agreement at Punta del Este, and the
 Washington Agreement of Foreign Min-
 isters of 1964.
 We need this clarification In order to
 reestablish the confidence of the world
 in us; a confidence which has been badly
 shaken by events following passage in
 the House of Representatives of the un-
 fortunate resolution which has created
 grave doubts in Latin America as to
 exactly what our position is on the issue
 of intervention.
 Madam President, I close by saying
 that I am never happy to find myself in
 a critical posture in relation to my Gov-
 ernment on foreign policy.  However, I
 take some solace from the fact that if
 we were to add up all the issues on Amer-
 ican foreign policy, it would be found
 that I am, In an overwhelming majority
 of the issues, in agreement with the
 administration.
 But, in the area of Latin America, and
 in the area of southeast Asia, I find my-
 self in substantial disagreement on a
 great many issues.
 Madam President, there is an area for
 agreement, and I see some trends of such
 a prospect within the developing policies
 of the administration.  I pray that I am
 right in my hope that in the not too
 many months ahead we shall find our-
 selves of one mind again.
 I believe that I see a growing recogni-
 tion on the Hart of the a
 dminlstrat n..
 .
 Arkansas on the floor of the Senate, not bassador Goldberg at the United Nations,
 so many days ago, in which he expressed  that every support must be given to him
 criticisms of our Dominican Republic     as lie seeks to carry out what we have
 policy.                                  been led to believe are the clear instruc-
 tions of the President of the United
 States, to see what can be done by way
 of conversations and diplomatic nego-
 tiations with members of the United
 Nations, and particularly with members
 of the Security Council, to find a way
 to bring an end to the killing in south-
 east Asia, the ending of the bombing,
 the adoption of a ceasefire, the promul-
 gation of an administrative policy that
 will lead to the setting up of a United
 Nations trusteeship.
 There are some straws in the diplo-
 matic winds that indicate that an analy-
 sis is being made of that approach.  If
 I am correct in my understanding-and
 I am not merely acting on the basis of
 straws taken from the blue sky, but this
 understanding is based on conversations
 I have had in regard to this matter with
 high people in the administration-I
 believe there is some hope.
 I trust that every diplomatic channel
 will be exhausted to the end of bringing
 of the hope into fruition.  I am satisfied
 that we must end the war in southeast
 Asia, but on a basis that will protect the
 millions of people there from what I
 think would be history's worst blood bath
 if we left the parties to themselves in
 southeast Asia.  Now that we have been
 a party to the creation of that situation,
 we cannot leave the situation to the par-
 ties themselves.                                                                                               That Is 'why I have
 never, in my speeches of protest, advo-
 cated that we withdraw abruptly from
 southeast Asia, but that we change our
 own status and get others to come in
 with us to keep the peace.
 I would return to that ideal, the pro-
 posals of Franklin Roosevelt, for a trus-
 teeship over Indochina by the United
 Nations. I hope my administration will
 proceed to do everything it can, within
 the framework of the United Nations, to
 attaining that ideal.
 THE PUERTO RICAN CHILD IN THE
 AMERICAN SCHOOL
 Mr. WILLIAMS of New Jersey.  Mr.
 President, I recently received a most in-

 1.  THE  MIGRATION
 In 1960 some 900,000 Puerto Ricans lived
 in the United States including not only those
 born on the island but also those born to
 Puerto Rican parents in the States.  Until
 1940, the Puerto Rican community in the
 United States numbered only 70,000, but by
 1950 this had risen to 226,000, and over the
 decade to 1960, the net gain due to migration

 CLARIFICATION   AND  IMPROVE-
 MENT OF STATUTES AFFECTING
 VA DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE
 AND SURGERY
 Mr.              YARBOROUGH.  Mr.  Presi-
 dent, I introduce, for appropriate ref-
 erence, a bill to clarify and otherwise
 improve chapter 73 of title 38, United
 States Code, relating to the Department
 of Medicine and Surgery of the Veterans'
 Administration,  and  for  other  pur-
 poses.  As the title indicates, the pur-
 pose of this legislation is to accomplish
 a number of perfecting changes in the
 law governing the Department of Medi-
 cine and Surgery in the Veterans' Ad-
 ministration, which, within the Veterans'
 Administration, administers the hospital
 and medical care program for veterans.
 Many of the proposed amendments
 concern improvements in terminology,
 or are mere clarifications in language to
 reflect current conditions or circum-
 stances. Some of the amendments pro-
 posed would, however, involve substan-
 tive changes in the law which experi-
 ence has demonstrated to be desirable.
 Except for the proposed authority in
 section 9, to pay the expenses of part-
 time and temporary full-time physicians,
 dentists, and nurses while attending pro-
 fessional meetings, there would be no ad-
 ditional expenditure of public funds re-
 sulting from the enactment of the pro-
 posed legislation. The cost of section 9
 would be minimal.
 The bill would also amend section
 5004 of title 38, United States Code, to
 provide express statutory authority for
 the Veterans' Administration to estab-
 lish, operate, and maintain parking fa-
 cilities in conjunction with the hospitals
 and domicillaries it operates.  Basic au-
 26339
 thority for the operation of such facili-
 ties exists, but in general terms.  The
 proposed amendment would spell out
 this authority and also specifically au-
 thorize the collection of reasonable fees,
 under certain circumstances, from em-
 ployees, visitors, and others using the
 facilities, as well as providing certain
 operational refinements.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the bill be printed at this point
 in the RECORD.
 The VICE PRESIDENT.  The bill will
 be received and appropriately referred;
 and, without objection, the bill will be
 printed in the RECORD.
 The bill (S. 2666) to clarify and other-
 wise improve chapter 73 of title 38,

 ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPEND-
 ENT FEDERAL MARITIME ADMIN-
 ISTRATION
 Mr. MAGNUSON.  Mr. President, in
 recent weeks a number of proposals have
 been advanced, and some subsequently
 withdrawn, with the announced purpose
 of assisting and promoting the U.S. mer-
 chant marine. I do not care at this time
 to comment on all the proposals that
 have been made by Government officials
 and committees and by several associa-
 tions representing maritime labor and
 management. It is rather clear that this
 adventure of initiating proposals and
 new ideas has not come to an end. The
 President of the United States,, has
 promised a new maritime policy and a
 special subcommittee of the President's
 Maritime Advisory Committee Is now
 busy at work on additional maritime
 proposals.
 I have no panacea to suggest to the
 Advisory Committee, but I do believe that
 it will be necessary for those who make
 further recommendations to realize the
 importance of including a meaningful
 program of assistance and moderniza-
 tion for our domestic merchant fleet and
 our American. shipyards.
 The desperate condition of the domes-
 tic trade has been fully documented in
 Senate Commerce Committee hearings,
 yet this essential segment, which In the
 past has involved a fleet larger than that
 in our foreign. trade, has been admittedly
 and by design ignored in Government
 studies made to date.  The problem of
 the U.S. coastal, Great Lakes, and off-
 shore trades to Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and
 Alaska represents to me one of the most
 serious facing our American merchant
 marine. It can no longer be ignored.
 Neither can our shipyards and essen-
 tial American suppliers to shipyards be
 ignored. The Government spends over a
 billion and one-half dollars annually in
 private American shipyards and Ameri-
 can private operators in the foreign and
 domestic trade spend -annually another
 quarter of a billion dollars. Therefore, I
 believe it should be obvious that the im-
 provement and modernization of our
 shipbuilding capability offers possibilities
 for competitive improvement and cost re-
 duction to the Government and industry
 as significant as the modernization of our
 merchant fleet.
 Much could be advanced for improving
 the competitive position of both our do-
 mestic  fleet  and American shipyards
