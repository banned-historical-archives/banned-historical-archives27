				 	nature  and  also  related  to  the  search  for  and  selection  of  facts.    	Although
				 	the  reviewed  subject  undoubtedly  exists  independently,   	and  at  times  has  its
				 	own  motivating  forces,   	the  work  of  the  special  services  is  ultimately  noth-
				 	ing  more  than  a  continuation  of  the  policy  of  the  corresponding  governments
				 	by  other  means.    	However,   	in  many  instances   	this  work  is  of  such  a  nature			   	=
				 	that  these  governments  officially  and  apparent~y  convincingly   	disavow.    	For		     	~
				 	this  very  same  reason,   	even  forgetting  the  understandable  secrecy,  one
				 	feels  a  lack  of  facts  which,  as  is  known,   	is  the  very  air  of  the  researcher.
				 	It  is  like  trying  to  catch  your  breath.    	Rather  it  is  like  breathing  the
				 	fumes  of  a  poisoned  atmosphere  for  probably  in  no  other  sphere  of  state  ac-
				 	tivities  in  the  West  is  disinformation  so  often  resorted  to.
				 	But  it  is  imperative  to  investigate  this  sphere.    	It  is  complet~ly  impos-
				 	sible  to  understand  the  present-day  world  without  considering  the  activi-
				 	ties  of  the  special  services,   	in  the  given  instance  the  U.S.   	CIA  as   	these
				 	activities  have  involved  all  mankind.    	This  is  no  exaggeration.
				 	The  father  of  American  espionage   	(yes,  yes,   	this  sector  has  grown  up  so
				 	much  that  it  has  acquired  fathers),  A.  Dulles,   	energetically  ended  the				 	~
				 	work  of  his  life  "The  Craft  of  Intelligence"  with:    	"The  military  threat
				  	in  the  nuclear  missile  age  is  well  understood,   	and  we  rightly  spend  bil-
				  	lions  of  dollars  to  offset  it.    	This  should  be  our  attitude  to  all  the  as-
				  	pects  of  the  secret  war....    	The  last  thing  we  should  do  is  to  place  fet-
				  	ters  on  our  intelliger..ce.    	Its  iunctions  of  defense  and  information  are
				  	essential  in  the  age  of  exceptional  and  constant  danger."1    	There  is  much
				  	worthy  of  note  in  this  reasoning  both  as  an  indication  of  the  value  of  in-
				  	telligence   	(no  less  than  the  intercontinental  missiles  and  the  thermo-
				  	nuclear  bombs)   	as  well  as  the  semantic  import  of  what  was  said.					     	_
				  	A  knowledgeable  person  who  in  the  past  was  the  main  liaison  officer  for
				  	the  pentagon  with  the  CIA,   	F.   	Prouty,   	in  a  rare  moment  of  truth  in  the
				  	middle  of  the  1970's  at  the  end  of  Vietnam  and  on  the  threshold  of  Water-
				  	gate,  wrote  precisely  about  these  words  of  A.  Dulles:    	"The  concluding,
				  	final  notion  of  the  book  by  the  old  boss  is  the  best  example  of  how  the
				  	intelligence  community  feels  it  necessary  to  live  in  the  nuclear  age.
				  	They  want  us  to  have  the  most  expensive  and  developed  intelligence  system
				  	which  has  the  capability  of  automatically  parrying  everything  that  seems
				  	a  threat  to  them.    	Although  Allen  Dulles  did  no~  say  this  in  his  book,
				  	his  concept  of  intelligence  would  provide:    	10  percent  conventional  in-
				  	telligence  and  90  percent  secret  subversive  activities.    	In  other  words,
				  	we  should,   	in  the  notion  of  Dulles,  be  busy  around-the-clock  throughout
				  	the  world,   	countering   	'all  aspects  of  the  secret  war.		By  this  he  implies
				  	interference  into  the  internal  affairs  of  other  countries  regardless  of
				  	whether  they  know  of  or  permit  this.    	The  United  States  has  been  engaging
				  	precisely  in  this  in  an  ever-increasing  degree  starting  from  the  interven-
				  	tion  in  Berlin  and  Iran  in  the  1940's.    	The  culmination  point  of  this  way
				  	of  action  was  the  terrible  catastrophe  in  Vietnam,  where  the  question  be-
				  	gan  with  a  major  operation  by  intelligence  forces,   	and  then  entered  the
				  	stage  of  secret  subversive  activities,   	inevitably  leading  to  outright  war-
				  	fare  in  the  Johnson  era."2

					 	It  is  easy  to  see  why  such  clear  thoughts  had  come  t~  F.  Prouty.    	He  was
					 	writing  in  1973,  when  the  United  States  with  dissatisfaction  was  estimat-
					 	ing  the  costs  of  the  war  in  Vietnam.    	Different  estimates  were  given,  and
					 	having  analyzed  them,  R.   	Sig�ord   	(in  an  unpublished  dissertation  "The
					 	Rhetoric  of  the  Vietnam  War:    	Presidents  Johnson  and  Nixon,"  written  at
					 	the  University  of  Minnesota  during  the  year  the  book  by  F.  Prouty  was  pub-
		 	-				lished)   	concluded:    	"No  matter  how  the  estimates  are  tallied  the  direct
					 	and  indirect  cost  of  the  war  in  Vietnam  for  the  United  States  in  dollars
					 	and  cents  was  approximately  350  billion  dollars."3    	Expensive!    	Of  course,		    	-
					 	as  befits  the  ultrapragmatic  United  States,   	*_he  human~lives,   	and  above  all
					 	the  Vietnamese,   	are  not  counted.
					 	In  1978,  when  the  shock  was  over,   	the  former  CIA  Director  W.   	Colby  calmly		     	_
					 	explained  that  in  the  1970's,   	the  expenditures  on  the  CIA  subversive  ac-
					 	tivities  "had  rapidly  declined.    	The  CIA  has  cut  its  expenditures  on  polit-
					 	ical  and  paramilitary  operations  to  sucii  a  degree  that  expenditures  on
		 	`				subversive  activities  which  had  burdened  down  the  CIA  budget  and  had  taken
				    	~    	up  over  50  percent  of  it  in  the  1950's  and  1960's  had  declined  to  less
					 	than  5  percent."    	What,   	a  reduction  of  expenditures  on  these  purposes?
					 	Certainly  not.    	Expenditures  on  subversive  activities  had  simply  begun  to
					 	be  accounted  for  in  other  items.    	No  less  a  person  than  W.   	Colby  himself
					 	pointed  out  how  the  CIA  had  reached  such  a  state:    	"The  expenditures  for
					 	virtually  all  political  and  paramilitary  operations...were  assumed  by  the
					 	Pentagon,"  while  "financing,   	for  example,   	for  Radio  Free  Europe,   	Radio
					 	Liberty  and  Fund  of  Asia  is  determined  by  the  State  Department  and  Con-
					 	gress."4    	A1,1  of  this  was  also  described  by  W.   	Colby  in  his  life's  work
					 	"Honorable  Men.    	My  Life  in  the  CIA"  his  wordy  and  poorly  written  memoirs.
					 	For  the  title  he  used  a  statement  by  a  peer,   	his  predecessor  in  the  posi-
		 	'				tion  of  CIA  Director  R.   	He1ms  who  at  the  beginning  of  the  1970's  publicly
		 	'				assured  those  who  doubted  the  virtues  of  the  department:    	"You  should
					 	trust  us.    	We  are  honorable  men."    	It  happened  that  a  very  short  time  lat-
					 	ter  Helms  was  indicted  by  the  legislative  body,   	the  Congress,   	for  perjury,
					 	and  for  which  an  ordinary  American  would  be  held  firmly  and  for  a  long
					 	time  in  prison.    	But  the  leaders  of  the  CIA  are  a  caste  of  untouchables
					 	for  the  laws  of  the  overseas  "democracy."    	When  Helms  was  still  summoned
					 	to  court,  his  lawyer  and  he  argued  decisively  against  punishment,   	for  "it
					 	would  leave  a  scar  for  all  his  life."    	The  court  accepted  the  request,			   	_
					 	having  fined  Helms  in  Ncvember  1977  for  a  sum  of  $Z000  on  surprising					_
					 	grounds.    	Instead  of  the  grounds  of  "perjury,"  it  created  a  misdemeanor
					 	not  provided  for  by  the  criminal  code,  na~ely  a  reticence  to  give  "com-
					 	plete,   	exhaustive  and  accurate  evidence"  to  Congress.
					 	As  was  maliciously  pointed  out  by  the  magazine  NATION  on  19  November  1977,
					 	in  the  person  of  Helms  the  authorities  were  protecting  themselves,   	for  if
					 	he  had  so  desired  at  the  unheld  "trial  the  former  CIA  director  could  have
					 	provi~ed  an  enormous  pile  of  dirty  laundry  for  legal  washing.    	Among  other
					 	thing:a,   	the  bespotted  shirts  of  Henry  Kissinger  cculd  have  been  held  up
					 	for  universal  review."    	Released  from  ths  courtroom  with  just  a  symbolic

			    	For  the  CIA  it  is  nothing  less  than  a  question  or  honor  to  successfully

			    	exists  for  this.    	But  we  are  digressing.
			    	There  is  no  more  profound  misapprehension  than  to  present  the  CIA  as  just
			    	an  intelligence  and  counterintelligence  body.    	No  matter  what  corrections
			    	Colby  would  try  to  make,   	the  correct  propo;:tion  would  be  the  one  given  by
			    	F.  Prouty  in  referring  to  the  auth~rity  of  A.   	Dulles.    	Intelligence  in  the
			    	direct  sen~e  probably  comprises  10  percent  or  a  little  more  than  the  con-
			    	cerns  of  the  CIA.    	If.  this  were  not  the  case,   	then  there  would  have  been
			    	no  reason  at  all  to  set  up  the  CIA.    	In  the  United  States,  as  we  will  see
			    	below,   	t::ere  are  more  than  enough  intelligence  agencies,  and  according  to
			    	rough  estimates,   	there  are  about  10.    	G.  Kennan,  a  politica'~  thinker  by
			    	calling,   	a  diplomat,   	and  as  a  second  job  an  intelligence  a,s~,ent,   	quite
			    	rightly  pointed  out  in  his  book  "The  Cloud  of  Danger.    	Current  Realities
			    	of  American  Foreign  Policy"   	(1977):    	"Intelligence  per  se  has  been  a  nor-
			    	mal  function  of  states  long  before  the  rise  of  the  Soviet  Union  or  the
			    	United  States,   	and  it  is  the  purest  utopia  to  hope  for  its  complEte  dis-
			    	appearance.    	E~ut  everything  should  have  its  limits."    	What  are  they?    	"I
			    	myself  have  witnessed,"  writes  Kennan,   	"how  the  AmErican  intelligenca
			    	authorities  time  after  time  carried  out  or  endeavored  to  carry  out  opera-
			     	tions  which  not  only  directly  undermined  Soviet-American  diplomatic  rela-
			     	tions,  but  the  very  possibilities  of  achieving  better  mutual  understanding
			    	between  the  two  governments."6    	This  is  but  a  mere  shadow  of  what  must  b e
			     	stated  on  the  question  of  the  policy  carried  out  by  Washington  through  the
			     	CIA.
	  	=		   	This,   	of  course,   	is  not  just  intelligence.    	The  CIA  has  been  entrusted  with
			     	the  job  of  conducting  so-called  "psychological  warfare,"  and  conditionally
			     	90  percent  of  the  resources  of  the  giant  department  goes  for  this.    	"Psy-
			     	chological  warfare"   	in  the  official  manuals  of  American  intelligence  is
			     	defined  as  follows:		Coordination  and  use  of  all  means,   	including  moral			   	-
			     	and  physical   	(including  military  operations  by  the  regular  army,  but  uti-
			     	lizing  their  psychological  results)  by  which  the  enemy's  will  for  victory
			     	is  destroyed,   	and  its  political  and  economic  possibilities  for  this  are
			     	undermined;   	the  enemy  is  deprived  of  the  support,  aid  and  syu-~pathy  of  its
			     	allies  and  neutrals  or  is  prevented  from  receiving  such  support,   	aid  or
			     	sympathy;   	the  will  to  victory  of  our  own  people  and  their  allies  is  main-
			     	tained  or  increased;   	the  support,   	aid  and  sympathy  of  neutrals  is  main-
			     	tained  and  increased."~
			     	The  listed  methods  of  "psychological  warfare"  are  tantamount  to  the  at-
			     	tempts  to  undermine  the  state  system  of  a  state  selected  as  its  target,
			     	and  ultimately  overthrow  it.    	Espi~nage  is  the  product  and  subsidiary  of

				     	in  the  republic  lying  across  the  Atlantic,  the  dominant  American  political

				     	only  the  form  of  government  existing  in  the  United  States  as  the  only  pos-
				     	sible  one  and  one  superior  in  all  regards.    	Hence  from  reasor.s  rooted  in
						this  American  political  tradi~ion  there  is  an  inevitable  permanen~  conflict
				     	between  the  United  States  and  the  rest  of  the  world.    	The  functional  role
				     	of  the  CIA  is  to  do  everything  to  resolve  this   	conflict  in  favor  of  the
				     	L'nited  States.

				     	highest  honor  for  an  American  ~ournalist  is  to  be  in  with  the  presidential

		 	-		  	what  they  wanted  or  on  what  was  in  temptation's  way,  but  rathEr  basically

				   	ing  nature,  but  inevitably  passed  through  the  seive  of  careful  political
				   	censorship.
				   	This  quarry  was  also  the  subject  of  an  unprecedented  hunt  organized  not

				   	and  American  intelligence,   	and  the  attempts  using  human  guinea  pigs  to

				    	is  an  essential  part  of  the  work  to  establish  this  contr.ol  on  the  broadest
		 	-		   	scale.    	At  least  dissidents  in  the  United  States  are  warned  by  this  of
				   	what  awaits  them.    	However  the  general  purpose  of  all  this  is  much  broad-
				    	er,   	that  is,   	to  intimidate  the  world,  having  shown  who  is  guarding  the
				    	class   	rule  by  capital.    	And  particularly  outside  the  borders  of  the  over-
				    	seas   	"democracy."

		 	-		   	judgments  worthy  of  the  t~tle  has  commented  on  the  "investigations"  organ-
				    	ized  on  Capitol  Hill:    	"The  reports  on  them  underwent  rigid  censorship.
				    	The  Senate  committee  was  rather  frank  about  the  legal  violations  and  ex-
				    	cesses  of  the  FBI,  but  was  almost  flattering  in  some  of  i~s  assessments
				    	of  the  CIA....    	'The  best  thing  in  this  is  that  it  is  over,'   	said  the
				    	senator  from  Tennessee  H.   	Baker  on  the  question  of  the  15-month  investiga-
				    	tion,   	when  the  great  moment  of  its  completion  had  arrived.     	'We  have
				    	finished  and  we  have  conducted  the  investigation  without  causing  any  dam-

				    	for   	the  Americans  themselves  who  are  perfectly  aware  of  what  awaits  those

					    	certainly  not   	all  of  them  did.    	Without  having  committed  an~?  crimes  or
					    	misdeeds,   	they  felt  the  hot  clutches  of  the  special  services  which  had
					    	reached  them  in  the  jungles.    	For  the  zealots  of  American  "democracy,"
					    	the  collective  protest  by  leaving  the  United  States  was  already  a"con-			  	-
					    	spiracy"  with   	all  the  ensuing  consequences.    	As  a  result  there  was  the
					    	real  prospect   	of  again  ending  up  in  the  clutches  of  "law  and  order,"  and				.
					    	virtually  everyone  preferred  to  end  his  life  in  November  1978.    	These  were
					    	the  next  victims  of  "psychological  warfare."
					    	The  subversive  activities  of  the  CIA  are  carried  out  in  many  directions.
					    	In  our  times,   	in  all  probability,  without  abandoning  other  means,   	the  CIA
					    	is  making  a  special  effort  in  the  area  of  ideology  vis-a-vis  the  USSR  and
					    	the  other  soc ialist  countries.    	The  choice  for  focusing  attention  on  this
					    	aspect  of  "psychological  warfare"  was  made  for  a  number  of  reasons  which				-
					    	in  part  do  no t  depend  upon  the  will  of  the  agency  leadership.    	Why?    	It
					    	would  be  worth  our  while  to  investigate.
					    	It  would  be  r undamentally  wrong  to  represent  the  United  States  as  a  coun-		     	-
					    	try  where  the   	forces  of  darkness  are  in  unch~llenged  control.    	There  ~re
		   	~				people  there  who  realistically  view  the  situation  in  the  world  and  are  in
					    	favor  of   	good   	relations  with  the  USSR.    	They  make  no  secret  of  their  con-
					    	victions.    	The  strategists  of  "psychological  warfare"  are  endeavoring  to
					    	undermine  the   	influence  of  these  circles  which  is  tangible,   	in  focusing
					    	efforts  in  the  ideological  sphere.
					    	Let  us  endeavor  to  take  up  precisely  this  aspect  in  the  activities  of  the
					    	CIA.    	It   	is  completely  impossible  to  fully  disengage  it  from  the  overall
					    	picture  of  the  subversive  activities  carried  out  by  the  Western  special
					    	services,   	and   	for  this  reason  other  questions  will  inevitably  be  touched
					    	upon.
					    	The  first  of  these  is  why  the  CIA  was  set  up  in  1947.    	Neither  sooner  nor
					    	later.    	And  how  this  can  be  traced  from  the  American  sources  which  have
					    	generally  been  used  for  the  writing  of  this  book.

					 	[Article  by  Ernst  Genr~:    	"Bei~jing--Washington"]
					 	[Text]    	Many  co~nentators  in  the  capitalist  countries  have  viewed  the
			=		     	rapprochement between  Bei~ing  and  Washington  almost  as  an  "epoch-making"
					 	event  which  in  the  future  should  alter  the  entire  international  situation.
					 	In  December  of  1978,  when  the  United  States  took  the  decision  to  establish
					 	diplomatic  relations  with  the  PRC,  the  influential  West  German  mag~.zine
					 	DER  SPIEGEL  wrote:    	"The  alliance  between  America  and  China,  regardless  of
					 	all  the  phrases  accompanying  it,  represer~ts  a  classic   	'coup  in  the  system
					 	of  alliances,'   	a  coup  in  the  balance  of  forces  which  has  existed  hitherto-
					 	fore  and  comparable  with  the  end  of  hostility  between  the  Hapsburgs  and
					 	the  Bourbons  in  the  middle  of  the  18th  century  or  t:~e  animosity  between
					 	England  and  Russia  at  the  beginning  of  the  20th  century."    	The  chairman  of
					 	the  CCP  Central  Committee,  Hua  Guofeng,   	stated  at  a  press  conference  on
			-				this  question  that  it  was  an  issue  of  an  "historic  turn."1    	The  chief  or-
					 	ganizer  of  the  deal  on  the  Chinese  side,  the  deputy  chairman  of  the  CCP
					 	Central  Committee  and  deputy  premier  of  the  PRC  State  Council,  Deng
						Xiaoping,   	is  depicted  in  many  organs  of  the  Western  press  as  almost  some-
			-				thing  like  a  modern-day  Talleyrand  or  Bismaxck.
						At  the  same  time,   	in  the  capitalist  world  the  question  is  often  asked  of
						precisely  what  encouraged  the  U.S.   	administration  and  the  government  in
					 	Bei~ing  at  the  end  of  1978  to  move  openly  towaxd  one  another?    	The  opinion
						has  been  voiced  that  this  deal  is  the  handiwork  of  the  present  Chinese
						leadership  which  in  1976  replaced  the  "Gang  of  Four"  which  was  close  to
						Mao  Zedong.    	At  the  same  time,  there  is  nothing  unexpected  in  the  agree-
						ment  between  the  PRC  and  the  United  States.    	It  cannot  be  considered  that
						the  rapprochement between  these  states  started  only  in  the  197ots.    	The
						roots  of  the  deal  go  much  deeper,  to  the  middle  of  tfie  19~+O~s,  when  the
						Maoist  headquarters  were  in  Yenan,  the  center  of  the  Special  Shaanxi--
						Gansu--Ningxia  Region.
						The  mutual  attraction  of  the  two  sides  was  clearly  apparent   	even  then.    	It
						took  almost  three  and  a  half  decades  to  bring  things  to  an  end,  but  the

					basic   	incentives  of  the  partners  were  the  same  in  the  1940's,  in  essence,
					as  they  are  now.    	Both  the  Maoists  and  the  United  States  proceeded  pri-
					marily  from  their  covert  anti-Soviet  and  expansionist  plans.    	And  the  con-
					tacts  were  established  regardless  of  the  fact  that  at  that  time  the  United
					States  officially  was  most  closely  linked  to  the  Chinese  government  of
					Chiang  Kai-shek  which  was  in  Zhongqing  [Chungking]  and  hostile  to  Yanan.
					On  22  July  194~+,  an  American  mi~sion  arrived  in  Yenan  ~d  it  was  met  at  the
					airport  by  a  band  and  the  leadership  of  the  CCP  headed  by  Mao  Zedong.    	The
					mission  included  the  political  advisors  of  Gen  J.   	Stilwell,  the  commander
					of  the  American  armed  forces  in  China,  Burma  and  India,  and  the  senior
					staff  officers  of  the  U.S.  military  attache  in  Zhongqing.    	The  talks  start-
					ed  immediately.
					P.  P.   	Vladimirov  who  at  that  time  was  in  Yenan  and  had  an  opportunity  to
					watch  events  at  the  Maoist  headquarters  wrote  in  his  diary  after  a  night-
					time  conversation  with  Mao  Zedong  that  the  chairman  of  the  CCP  Centr~l  Com-
					mittee  now  intended  to  basicall.y  side  with  the  United  States  and  EYigland
					and  was  counting  on  the  fears  of  America  and  Great  Britain  vis-a-vis  the
					Soviet  Union.    	"And  this  fear  should,  in  his  opinion,   	force  these  states'
				 	into  a  slow  but  sure  rapprochement  with  the  Special  Region.    	Mao  Zedong					"
					and  his  supporters  clearly  proposed  to  blaclflnail  the  A11ies  with  the  myth
				 	of  the  aggressiveness  of  the  USSR  which  supposedly  was  drea.ming  of  absorb-
				 	ing  China  (particularly  Manchuria)....    	The  chairman  of  the  CCP  Central
				 	Committee  not  only  intended  to  receive  arms  and  drive  out  Chiang  Kai-shek,
					but  also...exclude  any  effective  involvement  of  the  USSR  in  settling  the
				 	Far  East  ~2oblem.    	And  generally  to  neutraii:ze  any  diplomatic  efforts  of
				 	the  USSR.
				 	The  American  mission  remained  almost  2  months  in  Yenan.    	In  August  19~+~+,
				 	accorda.ng  to  Vladimirov's  notes,  Mao  Zedong  told  him  "We  are  thinking  of
				 	changing  the  name  of  our  party.    	To  call  it  not   	'Communist,'  but  rather
				 	something  else.    	Then  a  better  situation  will  exist  for  the  Special  Region,
				 	particularly  among  the  Americans.i3    	It  was  not  a  question  of  a  merely  for-
				 	mal  change  of  the  name.    	Mao  let  the  Americans  understand  directly  that  the
				 	party  headed  by  him  no  longer  needed  to  be  considered  Marxist-Leninist,  and
				 	that  he  agreed  to  turn  it  into  one  that  was  bourgeois-nationalistic  in				 	'
				 	spirit.
				 	On  23  August  194~+,  the  member  of  the  American  mission,  the  intelligence-
				 	agent  diplomat  J.   	Service,  spoke  with.the  chairman  of  the  CCP  Central  Com-
				 	mittee.    	As  Service  stated,  Mao  said:    	"Chinese  and  American  interests  are
				 	very  similar  and  compliment  each  other.    	They  agree  with  one  another  eco-			   	_
				 	nomically  and  politically.    	We  can  and  should  cooperate....    	America  does
				 	not  need  to  fear  that  we  will  not  cooperate.    	We  should  cooperate  and  we
				 	need  P~nerican  aid.    	That   	is  why  it  is  so  importar.t  for  us  to  know  what  you,
				 	the  Americans,  are  thinking  and  planning.    	We  cannot  take  the  risk  of  caus-
				 	ing  your  dissatisfaction,   	and  we  cannot  take  the  risk  of  any  clash  with
	     	y		  	ouu.i4    	This  was  said  by  Mao  Zedong  36  years  ago,  when  in  his  dealings  with
				 	Moscow  and  in  public  speeches  he  took  great  pains  to  show  his  unswerving
				 	friendship  with  the  USSR.

						very  practical  motives,  the  comtnunists  are  not  counting  on  Soviet  Russia
						being  able  to  play  a  ma~or  role  in  China."5    	At  the  end  of  September,
						Vladimirov  commented:    	"Mao  Zedong  considers  the  Soviet  Union  too  bled
						white  by  the  struggle  against  Nazi  Germany...and  for  this  reason  is  r_ot
						going  to  burden  himself....    	For  him  the  chances  with  the  Americans  axe
						much  more  preferential,  and  he  is  earnestly  forcing  a  partnership  on  them.
						For  Mao  it  is   	indisputable  that  at  present  the  fate  of  the  Far  East  and
						China  is  bei:~g  d.termined.    	And  the  chief  arbiter  is  thE  i}nited  States

		    	'		   	far  he  has  gone  in  his  promises,  guarantees,   	assurances  and  candor  border-
						ing  on  treachery."6
						Contacts  continue  between  the  Maoists  and  the  Americans.    	On  5  October  194~+,
						a  new  group  of  Americans  arrived  in  Yenan  headed  by  the  U.S.  military  at-
						tache  in  China,  Col  M.  Depaas  and  the  emissary  of  American  intelligence,
						the   	"surgeon"  D.  Armstrong.   	'They  also  were  met  at  the  airfield  by  Mao
						Zedong  a.nd  Zhou  Enlai.    	Finally,  on  7  November,  the  personal  representative
						of  the  U.S.  President  and  the  former  minister  of  defense,  Gen  P.   	J.   	Hurley,
						showed  up  at  Mao's  headquarters.    	"T'ne  purpose  of  the  Hurley  mission,"  com-
						mented  Vladimirov,   	"was  not  merely  to  impel  the  S~ecial  Region  to  begin
						active  operations  against  the  Japanese,  but  rather  to  drive  a  wedge  between
						the  CCP  leadership  and  Moscow."~
						A  draft  agreement  was  signed  by  both  parties.    	The  contents  of  the  talks
					'		became  known  to  Vladimirov.8  "The  authentic  texts  will  scarcely  ~ee  the
						light  of  day,"  he  commented.    	"Everything  has  been  spelled  out  there.    	The
						chairman  of  the  CCP  Central  Committee  has  offered  America  an  alliance,  an
						unshakable  alliance,  he  has  guaranteed  the  independence  of  Yenan   	from  the
						political  course  of  Moscow,   	and  so  forth.....    	For  weapons  and  an  alliance
						with  the  United  States,  Mao  Zedong  has  guaranteed  to  re,ject  the   	~ties  with
						Moscow.'    	On  14  November,  Hurley  informed  Mao  of  his   	'profound  satisfaction
						with  the  results  of  the  talks'   	which  had  been  characterized  by  a~brilliant
						spirit  of  cooperation.'    	He  advanced  the  hope  that  this  spirit  would  be
						strengthened  after  the  victory  over  Japan,  and  expressed  gratitude  to  Mao
						for  his   	'wise  letter'  to  the  U.S.   	President  in  which  he  hoped  to  realize
						the  dream  that  after  the  war   	'the  two  great  nations   	(Chinese  and  American)
						would  always  move  forward  shoulder  to  shoulder  in  building  peace  throughout
						the  world'."9
						The  notes  quoted  here  by  P.   	P.  Vladimirov  are  affirmed  by  the  actual  materi-
						a1  from  the  American  side.l~    	The  Amerfcan  ,journalist  T.  White  who  was  in
				     	Yenan   	in  the  summer  of  194~+  and  at  that  time  was  a  representative  of  the
						Luce  press  organization,  wrote  that  he  had  participated  in  "the  great  plan
						of  testing  out  the  possibilities  of  an  alliance  between  America  and  the
						Chinese  coiranunists."    	For  this  purpose  he  held  talks  with  his  "old  friend"

	     	_		  	(in  China.--E.G.).
					These  were  the  plans  of  the  Maoists  in  191+4  and  19~+5�    	At  that  time  they
					di.d  everything  "to  establish  for  them  (the  Americans.--E.G.)  the  correct-
					ness  and  necessity  of  an  alliance,"  convincing  them  "of  the  complete  na-
					tional  independence  of  the  CCP,"  in  l.etting  them  understand  in  every  pos-
				 	sible  way  that  "the  isolation  of  the  USSR  in  the  Far  East  meets  not  only
					American  interests."12    	Nevertheless,   	tne  hopes  of  the  Maoists  at  that  time
					did  not  come  true,  but  not  due  to  their  fault,  but  rather  obviously  as  a
					result  of  the  feaxs  of  the  U.S.  President  F.  Roosevelt.    	Regardless  of
					all  their  promises,  the  White  House  and  State  Department  still  could  not
					believe  that  Mao  Zedong  was  seriously  ready  to  abandon  communist  ideas  and
				 	switch  over  to  the  Western  ca.mp.    	At  that  ti:me  this  seemed  improbable  even
					to  the  overseas  politicians.
					Ultimately  it  was  decided  in  Washington  that  the  risk  of  a  political  and
					military  alliance  with  Yenan  was  too  great  and  it  was  preferable  to  con-
					tinue  betting  on  Chiang  Kai-shek.    	According  to  the  data  of  the  same  White,
					the  influence  of  the  extreme  reactionary  J.  McCarthy  could  also  be  felt.
					The  American  authorities  restricted  themselves  to  a  statement  that  the				  	-
					weapons  supplied  by  them  to  the  Chiang  Kai-shek  axmy  were  to  be  used  only
					to  fight  against  Japan.    	"But  still,"  Vladimirov  wrote,  "Mao  Zedong  did
					not  exclude  circumstances  under  which  the  White  House  could  alter  its  atti-
					tude  toward  the`'~Special  Region.i13    	~'he  CCP  leadership  was  hoping  that
				 	among  the  Americans  there  would  be  persons  "with  sober  views'~  and  that  they
				 	also  would  be  found  in  the  higher  U.S.   	administration.    	The  final  decision
				 	was  deferred  in  Washington,  but  the  "Chinese  caxd"  continued  to  be  kept  in
				 	reserve.    	The  duality  of  U.S.   	policy  in  China  remained  in  force.    	And  they
				 	also  were  waiting  in  Bei~ing.
				 	Moscow  knew  much  of  what  was  being  done  in  Yenan�    	But,  proceeding  from  the
				 	realities  of  waxtime  international  relations,  and  in  paxticulax  the  rela-
				 	tions  of  the  USSR  with  the  United  States,  caution  was  observed.    	Mao  Zedong

				 	taken   	into  account.    	The  party  was  not  homogeneous,  and  its  leaders  and
				 	functionaries  held  different  positions.    	In  1944,  Mao  Zedong  had  still  not
				 	been  able  to  completely  suppress  the  opposition  and  subordinate  the  party
				 	to  his  sole  power.    	In  the  USSR  hope  had  not  b~en  lost  that  the  healthy
				 	elements  within  the  CCP  could  promptly  prevent  the  treachery  of  the  Maoist

		 	-				Liberation  Army   	(PLA)  for  such  a  campaign,  having  ensured  a  rapid  victory
					 	for  it.    	But  Mao  wanted  the  Soviet  troops  to  begin  the  offensive  outside
					 	of  Manchuria  into  the  territory  of  North  China.I4
					 	Certainly  at  that  time  Mao  could  not  count  on  direct  support  in  Washington,
					 	particularly  as  support  was  still  being  given  to  Chiang  Kai-shek.    	As  is
					 	known,  Mao  Zedong  in  those  days  was  known  to  voice  such  statements  as  it
					 	would  be  better  if  China  did  not  have  diplomatic  relations  either  with  the
					 	USSR  or  the  United  States.ls    	It  was  cleax  that  in  a  concealed  form  an  ac-
		 	~				cent  was  being  put  on  the  disengaging  of  the  Maoists  from  the  USSR  which
					 	had  been  the  sole  and  natural   	ally   	of  the  Chinese  revolution.    	Obviously
					 	the  "American  card"  which  had  been  kept  in  the  hand  since  194~+  was  to  be			 	-
					 	played  later.    	As  it  turned  out,  this  was  done  by  Mao  Zedong  5  years  later.
					 	In  1949,  when  the  PLA  equipped  by  the  weapons  which  had  been  turned  over  by
					 	the  USSR  from  the  crushed  Japanese  aru~y  began  to  crush  the  Chiang  Kai-shek
					 	troops  and  Mao  had  been  established  in  Bei~ing,  the  secret  attempts  to  come
					 	to  terms  with  the  United  States  were  resumed.    	Upon  instructions  of  Mao
					 	Zedong,  this  time  the  initiator  was  Zhou  Enlai  who  was  appointed  to  the
					 	position  of  the  PRC  minister  of  foreign  affairs.    	From  documents  which  were
					 	declassified  by  the  U.S.   	State  Department  in  August  1978,   	it  can  be  seen
					 	that  in  1949  Zhou  Enlai  in  a  strictly  confidential  manner  turned  to  the
						United  States  with  a  request  to  help  China  conduct  a  policy  "independent
					 	of  the  West  and  the  Soviet  Union."    	Having  established  contact  with  Ameri-
					 	can  representatives  in  Bei~ing,  he  requested  that  his  message  be  turned
					 	over  to  the  highest  American  officials.    	Here  he  categorically  demanded
						that  his  name  not  be  mentioned,  warning  that  otherwise  "he,  of  course,			    	-
						would  deny  this  message  in  the  most  decisive  manner."
					 	In  this  note  Zhou  Enlai  also  recommended  that  the  Americans  proceed  from
						the  view  that  "China  still  is  not  a  capit~.list  nation,  and  if  the  policy
						of  Mao  Zedong  is  carried  out  correctly,  it  will  not  become  a  communist
						nation  for  a  long  time  to  come."16    	In  other  words,  the  same  bait  was
						thrown  to  the  Americans  as  in  19~+4,   	that  is,  the  abandoning  of  communist
						principles  by  the  Maoists.    	To  the  amazement  of  Mao  Zedong  and  Zhou  Enlai,
						the  deal  fe11  through  this  time.    	According  to  official  American  data,  the
						proposal  of  the  Chinese  caused  debates  in  the  State  Department  but  "finally
						was  re,jected."    	Under  President  H.   	Truman  the  White  House  obviously  felt
						that  for  U.S.   	interests  it  was  much  safer  to  rely  on  the  secure  U.S.  posi-
						tions  in  Japan  and  Taiwan  than  to  carry  out  a  risky  game  with  Bei~ing.
						The  armed  U.S.   	intervention  which  started  subsequently  in  Korea  finally
						assured  the  dominance  oF  this  viewpoint  in  Washington.    	As   	is  known,  the
						co~nander  of  the  American  Armed  Forces  in  the  Far  East,  D.  MacArthur,  pro-
						posed  to  the  U.S.   	goverru,~ent  that  Manchuria  be  bombed.    	Things  went  so  fax
						that  the  U.S.   	Secretary  of  State  J.   	Du11es,  in  meeting  Zhou  Enlai  in  195~+
						at  the  Geneva  Foreign  Ministers  Conference  on  Indochina,   	even  refused  to

				    	Beijing  and  Washington  were  apparently  irreconcilable  enemies.    	But  this
				    	was  only  an  appearance.    	In  deep  secrecy,  a  new  stage  was  already  being
				    	planned  in  Sino-American  relations.
				    	It  is  not  difficult  to  understand  the  reasons  for  the  unrestrained  desire
				    	of  Bei,jing  to  come  to  terms  with  the  United  States.    	For  Mao  Zedong  and
				    	the  people  around  him,   	it  was  not  merely  a  question  of  splitting  the  United
				    	States  away  from  Chiang  Kai-shek.    	And  not  even  to  drive  a  wedge  in  the
				    	relations  between  the  PRC  and  the  USSR,  to  suppress  the  internationslists
				    	in  tne  CCP,  and  thereby  strengthen  their  dictatorship  in  it.    	ror  Mao  the
				    	main  thing  was  to  prepare  ahead  of  time  for  a  policy  aimed  at  establishing
				    	the  hegemony  of  China  to  the  south,  north  and  west.    	This  was  primarily  the
				    	essence  of  his   	secret  adventuristic  plans.    	As  was  subsequently  substanti-
				    	ated,  the  basic  directions  for  the  expansioni.stic  policy  in  Asia  were  set
				    	by  Mao  several  years  before  World  War  II,  probably  soon  after  his  promotion
				    	to  the  post  of  the  CCP  leader  at  an  enlarged  meeting  of  tne  Politburo  of
				    	the  CCP  Central  Committee  in  Zunyi  in  1935  and  the  start  of  his  conflict
				    	with  the  Comintern.    	~ren  at  that  time,  Mao  Zedong,   	in  talks  with  the
				    	American  journalist  E.   	Snow,   	spoke  of  cla~ms  on  the  Mongolian  People's
				    	Republic  and  the  hopes  for  the  "return"  to  China  of  Korea,   	Indochina,  Burma
				    	and  other  Asian  countries.
				     	In  Yenan  they  considered  that  the  USSR  would  not  tolerate  the  hegemony  of
				    	any  power  in  Asia,  and  for  this  reason  began  to  look  for  a  suitable  ally
				     	against  the  USSR.    	Hence  the  siding  of  the  Maoists  with  the  United  States
				     	in  spite  of  the  then  constant  assurances  of  Mao  and  his  supporters  of  their
				     	loyalty  to  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  world  communist  movement,  ard  in  spite
				     	of  the  Soviet-Chinese  treaty  of  friendship,  alliance  and  mutual  aid  signed
				     	on  14  February  1950.    	When  in  1944,  Mao  had  held  talks  in  Yenan  ~-th  Col  D.
				     	Barret,  Gen  Hurley  and  other  envoys  from  Washington,  he  was  clearly  pro-
				     	ceeding  from  his  own  plans  for  a  great  emp~.~e.    	Fqually  obvious  were  the
				     	motives  which  even  then  caused  Washington  to  think  about  building  bridges
				     	to  the  Maoists.    	The  economic,  political  and  strategic  interests  of  the
				     	overseas  imperialists  were  forcing  them  this  wa,y.
				     	Among  the  American  monopolies,  even  from  the  beginning  of  our  cer.tury,  a
				     	definite  delimitation  could  be  observed  in  terms  of  the  main  area  of  their
				     	activities.    	A  significant  portion  of  the  large  businessmen  was  interested
				     	primarily  in  expanding  in  Western  Europe,  Latin  America,  and  later  also   	in
				     	the  Near  East  and  Africa.    	Another  very  influential  grouping  of  large
				     	business,   	in  particular  in  the  U.S.  Far  West,  preferred  to  channel  its
				     	capital  investments  and  hence  its  expansionistic  drives  chiefly  toward
				     	Eastern  Asia  and  the  Pacific.    	Their  plans  were  based  on  the  fact  that  in-
				     	vestments  in  these  regions,  due  to  the  vastness  and  the  "youth"  of  the
		  	-		   	local  maxkets,  the  cheapness  of  the  labor  force  and  the  abundance  of  un-
				     	touched  natural  riches,   	should  bring  a  significantly  higher  profit.
				     	The  "Pacific"   	school  of  American  imperialists  had  prepared  for  decades  for
				     	ex~ensive  expansion  in  Asia.    	Even  at  the  beginning  of  t~e  1900's,  their

				    	the  future  history  to  a  greater  degree  will  be  determined  by  our  position
				    	on  the  Pacific  facing  China  than  by  our  position  on  tne  Atlantic  facing
				    	E~zrope . " 19
	    	_		     	The  progratn  of  "facing  Asia"  was  also  supported  by  a  small  portion  of  the
				    	American  military,   	and  particularly  among  the  higher  naval  officers,  and
				    	du~ing  the  years  of  World  War  II  also  the  generals  who  had  fought  in  the
				    	Pacific  area.    	In  these  circles,  the  main  ene~}r  was  initially  seen  to  be
				    	Japan,  and  later  the  USSR.    	During  the  war  years,  the  gi�ren  grouping  had
				    	as  members  such  prominent  figures  as  the  above-mentioned  generals,  D.
				    	MacArthur  and  J.   	Stilwell,  the  chief  of  the  U.S.  A_~-my  General  Staff,  and			 	~
				    	subsequently  Secretary  of  State  Gen  G.  Marshal~,  the  commander  of  the  Amer-
				    	ican  troops  in  China  and  the  chief  of  staff  of  Chiang  Kai-shek  Gen  A.
				    	Wiedemeyer,  and  others.    	This  group  of  extreme  militaxists  considered  the				-
				    	main  goal  of  American  policy  at  that  time  in  the  Paci�ic   	zone  to  be  not
				    	only  a  victory  over  Japan,  but  also  the  establishing  of  American  control
				    	over  China.    	The  threads  from  it  stretched  to  the  State  Department  and  to
				    	the  persons  around  President  Truman.
				    	The  lar~e  monopolies  comprised  the  actual  core  of  these  forces.    	Prior  to
				    	World  War  I,  they  had  even  attempted  to  turn  China  into  an  American  feif,
				    	driving  out  the  European  imperialist  competitors  there.    	In  1905,  T.  Roose-
				    	velt  proposed  that  after  the  Russo-Japanese  War,  Manchuria  be  turned  over
				    	formally  to  China,  but  in  fact  putting  it  "under  the  leadership  of  the
				    	Powers."    	Of  course,  American  leadership  was  meant.    	The  same  thing  was  pro-
				    	posed  for  the  Chinese  Eastern  Railroad.Z~  Behind  this  proposal  was  a  grandi-
				    	ose  financial  plan.    	The  railroad  magnate E.   	Harriman  who  had  participated
				    	in  paying  for  the  expenses  of  the  election  campaign  of  T.  Roosevelt  pro-
				   	posed  creating  a  gigantic  around-the-world  railroad  and  seaway  which  would
				    	cut  across  America,  Asia,  Europe  and  the  two  oceans.    	It  was  clear  tha.t
				   	the  same  plan  for  establishing  American  domination  over  China  underlay  the
				    	Harriman  plan.
				    	Because  of  Japanese  resistance,  the  plans  were  not  carried  out  at  that
				   	time.21    	However,  the  idea  of  an  actual,  although  concealed  seizing  of
				   	China  by  the  United  States  and  thus  the  creation  of  a  great  American  Pacific
	    	-		 	.    	empire  continued  to  ferment  in  the  minds  of  the  overseas  monopolists,  gen-
				   	erals  and  politicians  who  were  convinced  that  ir.  this  manner  the  United
				   	States  could  achieve  world  hegemony.    	The  financial  support  for  these
				   	circles  was  the  California  Eank  of
													America,  the  largest  bank  in  the  capital-
				   	ist  world  which  even  at  the  end  of  the  1940's  began  to  open  up  its  branches
				   	in  various  Asian  countries  and  invest  large  amounts  of  capital  there.22
				   	Even  previously,  the  same  forces  had  undertaken  a  significant  political

			     	achieve  the  old  plans  by  a  completely  unexpected  means.

	   	_		 	considering  the  economic  and  strategic  interests  of  the  "Pacific"  school
			     	of  American  imperialists.    	In  September  194~+,  :iervice  asked  Mao  Zedong				  	~

			     	capital  to  be  invested  ir_  China"  and  how  he  would  consider  the  idea  of

					over  Iarge  industrial  complexes."    	At  that  time  Service  came  to  the  con-

					clus~on  that  the  CGP  leadership  was  a    	completely  snitable  partner"  for  the
	    	~		 	United  States.23    	~'ighteen  months  later,  on  1  February  1946,  being  in
					Beijing  as  t-he  personal  representative  of  Truman,  Gen  Marshall  transmitted
					to  Washington  the  contents  of  his  talk  with  Zhou  Enlai.    	The  viey*point  of
					this  Maoist  politician  was  formula;ed  by  Marshall  in  the  following  manner:
					"When  we   	(the  Chinese.--E.G.)   	say  that  we  should  follow  a  different  path
					(that  is,   	away  from  the  USSR  and  toward  the  United  States.--E.G.),  we  Yiave
					in  mind  that  we  want  to  adopt  the  American  model  of  democracy  tznd  science,
					and  we  desire  above  a11  to  carry  out  agrarian  reforms,   	industrialization
					and  the  development  of  the  individual  in  our  country,   	in  order  that  we  can
					build  an  independent,  free  and  successfully  functioning  China."24    	The
					Americans  were  amazed  heaxing  such  assertions.
					"In  these  talks,"  co~nented  Vladimirov,   	circumstances  which  were  new  to  me  were
					revealed.The  Americans  did  not  doubt  the  feasibility  of  a  solid  alliance
					with  Mao  Zedong.    	They  even  were  not  concerned  by  the  Communist  Party  as
					the  leading  force  in  the  Special  Region,   	and  possibly  even  for  the  future
					China.    	It  was  extremely  important  for  them  that  the  CCP  be  "independent
					and  fr~e  of  Moscow."    	This  already  presupposed  definite  nationalistic  as-
					pects.in  the  CCP  policy.    	In  a  word,   	'nationalistic  socialism'   	in  the
					Special  Region  or  in  China  was  to  the  liking  of  Washington....    	Character-
					istically  here  these  desires  were  not  rebuffed.    	Horsetrading  was  underway.

				   	The  new  contacts  between  Beijing  and  Washington  started  when  the  Maoists
				   	were  trying  to  receive  maximum  economic  aid  from  the  USSR.    	As  is  known,
				   	after  the  wax  the  USSR  granted  the  PRC  easy  credits  for  a  total  of  around
				   	2  billion  rubles,   	it  helped  China  in  building  more  than  250  large  indus-
				   	trial  enterprises  which  became  the  backbone  of  Chinese   	industry,  and  turned
				   	over  gratis  24,000  sets  of  scientific  and  technical  specifications  valued
				   	at  many  billions  of  dollars.27    	None  of  this  prevented  the  Maoist  politi-
				   	cians  from  continuing  to  seek  a  deal  with  the  United  States  behind  the  back
				   	of  the  USSR  and  precisely  against  it,  as  well  as  against  the  other  Asian
				   	peoples.    	The  carrying  out  of  the  plan  dreamed  up  in  Bei,jing  of  creating
				   	a  Chinese  superpower  in  Asia  by  that  time  had  already  started  in  practice.
				   	Direct  contacts  with  the  United  States  were  resumed  in  1955�    	Meetings  be-
				   	tween  the  Chinese  and  U.S.   	ambassadors  were  held  in  Geneva  and  later  in
				   	Prague  and  Warsaw.    	On  the  Chinese  side,  again  the  condition  was  imposed  of
				   	keeping  the  content  of  the  talks  the  strictest  secret.    	Publically  the
				   	Maoist  leaders  continued  to  attack  American  imperialism  and  stress  the  fact
				   	of  Chinese  friendship  with  the  USSR.    	In  speaking  on  8  September  1958  at  a
				   	session  of  the  PRC  Supreme  State  Council,  Mao  Zedong  stated:    	"If  the  monop-
				   	olistic  clique  of  America  continues  to  carry  out  its  policy  of  aggression
				   	and  war,   	inevitably  the  day  will  come  when  the  peoples  of  the  entire  world
				   	will  pass  a  death  sentence  against  it  and  carry  it  out.i28    	In  the  same
				   	year  at  a  conference  in  Chengdu,  he  said:    	"We  must  be  friendly  with  the
	   	-		     	USSR  and  with  all  the  People's  Democracies,  with  the  communist  parties  and
				   	working  class  of  different  nations,  we  must  work  for  internationalism,  and
				   	learn  what  is  positive  from  the  USSR  and  other  countries."29
				   	The  double-dealing  game,  the  same  as  was  at  one  time  practiced  by  the
				   	Chinese  mandarins,  was  not  interrupted  for  a  single  day.    	Maoist  diplomacy
				   	was  directed  by  Zhou  Enlai  who  was  clearly  specialized  in  intrigues  with
	    	~		     	the  West.    	P.   	P.   	Vladimirov,  even  during  the  war  years,   	commented  that  Zhou
				   	"keeps  to  the  Americans  like  an  old  acquaintance"  and  that  "precisely  he  is
				   	prep~,ring  all  the  most  crucial  foreign  policy  actions"  during  the  talks.30
				   	Mao  Zedong  at  this  time  preferred  to  keep  in  the  shadows  obviously  endeavor-
				   	ing  to  keep  the  alibi  of  the  "communist"  ideologue  for  himself.    	And  the
				   	more  the  nationalistic  and  empire-building  moods  developed  in  the  Maoist
				   	upper  clique,  the  more  its  plans  counted  on  an  alliance  with  the  United
				   	States.    	The  one  was   	inseparably  linked  with  the  other.    	The  Americans  were
				   	amazed  how  steadily  a  bridge  was  being  built  toward  them  from  the  other
				   	side.    	Nevertheless  years  were  to  pass  before  the  concluding  of  a  deal  be-
				   	tween  the  PRC  and  the  United  States.

					Among  the  problems  discussed  at  the  talks  were,  for  example,  the  question
					of  the  war   	in  Vietnsm  and  control  over  atomic  weapons.    	Mutual  understand-			   	~
					ing  was  reached  on  the  issue  that  in  response  to  a  guarantee  for  Chinese
					inviolability  by  the  U.S.   	armed  forces,  China  would  not  undertake  broad  in-			 	-
					tervention  in  the  Indochinese  war.    	Washington,   	in  turn,  promised  not  to
					support  the  Taiwan  puppet  Chiang  Kai-shek,   	if  he  decided  upon  armed  actions
					against  Mainland  China.31    	In  other  words,  careful  preliminary  preparations
					were  underway  for  a  genera.l  dea1.    	The  interests  of  the  parties  and  the
					possibilities  of  their  coinciding  or  drawing  together  were  discuased  in  all
					detail.
					On  l~+  January  1962,  the  former  U.S.  President  Eisenhower,  under  whose  aegis
					the  talks  Y~ad  been  carried  out,   	in  commenting  on  the  deterioration  of  re-
					lations  between  the  PRC  and  the  USSR,  openly  stated:    	"We  are  pleased  by
					the  development  of  these  differences."
				 	In  instructions  to  the  American  embassies,  the  White  House  pointed  out:
				 	"Although  the  United  States  cannot  do  anything  to  deepen  this   	split   	(here
					Eisenhower  was  not  saying  what  he  thought.--E.G.),  we  should  at  least
				 	avoid  steps  which  could  contribute  to  the  eliminating  of  it."32    	Literally
					the  same  notion  was  repeated  by  Senator  H.   	Jackson.    	"The  central  problem
					which  we  must  keep  in  mind  that  we  should  do  nothing  which  could  bring  the			  	-
				 	Russians  and  the  ^hinese  closer  together....    	The  most  valuable  thing  we
				 	have  is  the  split  between  the  Soviet  Union  and  Red  China."33    	This  was  the
				 	voice  of  the  American  military-industrial  complex  with  Jackson  being  con-
				 	sidered  the  leading  representative  of  it  in  the  Senate.    	Subsequently  the
				 	ideas  of  H.  Kissinger  came  down  precisely  to  this  same  formula.
				 	On  i3  December  1963,   	now  under  President  J.   	Kennedy,  the  assistant  U.S.
				 	Secretary  of  State  for  Far  Eastern  Affairs,  R.   	Hilsman,  made  a  statement
				 	on  the  readiness  of  the  United  States  to  keep  "doors  open"  for  talks  with
				 	the  PRC  on  improving  relations.    	Here  it  was  stressed  that  the  U.S.   	govern-
				 	ment  was  fully  determined  to  keep  these  doors  open,  since  such  a  develop-			   	_
				 	ment  of  events  "could  be  for  the  good  of  our  country."    	On  this  question
				 	the  NEW  YORK  TIMES  on  1C  December  1.973  commented:    	"This  statement  has  not
				 	altered  policy,  but  it  has  changed  the  position  of  Washington."    	In  the
				 	following  year,  President  L.   	Johnson  received  an  in~vitation  from  Bei~ing
				 	to  visit  China.    	Later  the  Secretary  of  State  D.  Rusk  in  one  of  his   	speech-
				 	es  let  it  be  known  that  talks  with  China  were  of  much  greater  significance
				 	than  might  be  assumed  from  their  coverage  in  the  press.    	On  the  other  side,
				 	in  speaking  with  members  of  the  Japanese  Diet,  the  PRC  Minister  of  Foreign
				 	Affairs  Chen  Yi  emphasized  that  China  would  long  ago  have  broken  off  talks
				 	with  the  United  States  if  they  were  not  considered  useful.34    	This  was
				 	said  regardless  of  the  fact  that  the  armed  intervention  by  the  United
				 	States  was  already  occurring  in  Vietnarn.35    	The  interruption  in  the  Sino-
				 	American  talks  made  at  that  time  by  Beijing  for  purely  tactical  considera-
				 	tions  did  not  have  any  particular  consequences.
	    	-		   	On  12  July  1966,  President  Johnson,  in  speaking  before  the  council  of
				 	school  graduates,  laid  out  a  new  "Asian"  doctrine  of  the  United  States.

					 	He  emphasized  that  Asia,  and  in  particular  its  southeastern  part,  was  a
					 	"sphere  of  U.S.   	interests,"  and  that  the  country  would  use  Americe.n  mili-
		 	_		     	tary  might  there  in  the  future.     	Thus,  Johnson's  "Pacific"  doctrine  in			    	-
					 	essence  differed  little  from  the  doctrine   	(of  the  same  name)  of  T.   	Roose-
		 	_		     	velt  which  had  been  proclaimed  at  the  be~inning  of  the  1900's.    	In  the
					 	same  speech,  Johnson  came  out  for  "a  truce  between  the  states   	(the  United
					 	States  and  PRC.--E.G.)  which  call  themselves  enemies,"  and  for  creating
					 	in  the  Pacific  basin  and  in  Asia,  under  U.S,   	aegis  "an  international  com-
					 	munity  of  law  and  order,"  in  which  "Mainland  China"  was  also  invited  to
		  	~		     	participate.36    	Characteristical ly  precisely  during  the  same  days  a  rabid
					 	anti-Soviet  campaign  ~~as  organized  in  China,  and  this  reached  the  point  of
						mass  outrages  in  front  of  the  building  of  the  Soviet  embassy  in  Beijing.37
		 	-		     	Clearl,y  neither  event was  an  accident.
						At  the  end  of  1966,   	in  Washingt on  at  the  State  Department  a  special  consul-
						tative  ~omraission  was  set  up  on  Chinese  problems.    	It  included  such  promi-
						nent American  sinologists  as  D.   	Barnett,  one-time  deputy  assistant  secretary
						of  state,  and  F.   	Straus  the  former  U.S.  Ambassador  to  Cambodia  who  had
						lived  11  years  in  China  and  had  repeatedly  met  with  Zhou  Enlai.38
					 	In  the  1960's  the  entire  reactionary  camp  in  the  United  States  had  already
					 	converged  on  the  idea  of  the  importance  of  a  rapprochement  with  China,   	if
						one  disregards  the  "Taiwan  lobby"  which  had  been  bought  off  by  Chiang  Kai-
					 	shek.    	But  the  influence  of  this   	lobby  which  at  one  time  was  very  signifi-
						cant  in  Washington  F!&S  steadily  declining.    	The  former  American  Ambassador
						to  Japan,  E.  Reischauer,  wrote:     	"If  representation  oF  the  two  Chinas  is
		 	_		     	impossible,  then  we  should  recognize  that  the  loss  by  Taiwan  of  its  seat
					 	in  the  United  Nations,   	in  a11  probability,   	is  less  harmful  to  American
		 	.		     	general  interests  than  the  continuation  of  our  veto  against  Beijing."   	TYie
						sa.me  Reischauer  made  the  proposal  of  removing  American  nuclear  weapons			    	~
						from  the  island  of  Okinawa,  and  thereby  clear  the  path  for  further  talks
						with  Beijing.39    	The  special  assistant  of  President  Johnson,  B.  D.   	Moyers,
						called  for  the  abandoning  of  the   	"rhetoric"  which  had  accompanied  the  dis-
						cussion  of  China  in  the  United  States,  and  assuming  a"correct  position"
						for  the  purpose  of  reaching  agreement  with  Bei~jing.40
						In  a  secret  document  sent  out  in  February  1967  to  the  American  overseas
						information  centers,   	it  was  stat ed  that  for  the  United  States  it  was  desir-
						able  that  "Mao  and  his  group  still  remain  in  power,"   	since  "their  ma,in  ef-
						forts  were  directed  against  the  USSR,"    	Here  it  was  also  pointed  out  that
						if  the  future  ruler  of  China  (obviously,  after  the  death  of  Mao.--E.G.)  be-
						gan    	to  direct  his  main  efforts   	against  the  USSR,"  then  he  could  count  on
		 	_		     	the  tacit  support  of  the  United  States.41    	In  January  1968,  President

				 	Was:~in~ton  was  now  ready  to  make  concessions.    	irlhy?    	Obviously  because
				 	Beijing  by  that  time  had  been  able  to  convince  the  United  States  of  its
				 	anti-Soviet  ideas  and  plans.    	j+Rzen  in  March  1969,  the  Maoists  organized  an
				 	armed  clash  in  the  region  of  ~he  Ussuri  River  and  somewhat  later  announced
				 	their  claims  to  1.5  million  m'   	of  t~rritory  in  Eastern  Siberia  and  the
				  	Soviet  Far  East,  this  gave  k'ashington  a  decisive  push  to  come  to  terms  with
				  	Bei~ing.    	Precisely  fx�om  that  time,  the  U.S.  President  R.   	Nixon,  the  Secre-
				  	tary  of  State  W.  Rogers  and  ather  prominent  American  officials  began  to
				  	snea.k  more  and  more  frequently  of  the  U.S.   	desire  to  improve  relations  with
				  	the  PRC.    	The  trade  restrictions  on  Chiria  were  eased,  and  the  permanent
				  	alert  of  the  U.S.   	Seventh  Fleet  in  the  Strait  of  Taiwan  was  canceled.
				  	These  were  major  decisions  which  could  bode  for  much.    	The  Americari-
				  	Chinese  talks  soon  produced  concrete  results.    	At  the  Plenum  of  the  CCP
				  	Centi�a1  Committee  in  August  1970,  certain  data  on  these  talks  were,made
				  	public  for  the  first  time.    	Then  the  fundamental  change  under  way  in  the
				  	foreign  policy  course  of  China  toward  a  rapprochement  with  the  United
				  	States  was  also  announced.42    	In  April  1971,   	Zhou  Enlai,  had  a  meeting  with
				  	American  athletes   	in  Beijing,   	emphasized  that  it  was  a  question  of  a"new
				  	page  in  Sino-American  relations.i43    	In  October  of  the  same  year,  the
				  	assistant  of  President  Nixon  on  Nationa.l  Security  Affairs,  Kissinger,   	sud-
				  	denly  appeared  in  the  PRC  capital.    	He  announced  that  China  was  an  "im-
				  	portant  ball  in  the  game  of  forces  on  the  arena  of  world  politics."44
				  	On  21  February  1972,  Nixon  accompanied  by  Kissinger  and  Rogers  arrived  in
				  	Beijing.45    	This  visit  which  was  held,   	regardless  of  the  absence  of  diplo-
				  	matic  relations  between  the  two  countries,  excited  the  Western  press.    	Only
				  	now  did  the  capitalist  world  truly  understand  the  importance  of  those  talks
				  	which  had  been  underway  for  years  between  the  PRC  and  the  United  States.
				  	Nixon  was  received  by  Mao  Zedong,  and  at  a  banquet  in  Shanghai  announced:
				  	"At  present  our  two  peoples  hold  in  their  hands  th~  future  of  the  entire			    	-
				  	world.~~`~6    	TJo  other  American  president  had  made  such  a  statement  about  re-
				  	lations  with  another  state.    	At  a  banquet  in  Bei~ing,  Nixon,   	in  replying
				  	to  Zhou  Enlai,   	stated:    	"What  we  are  doing  here  should  change  the  world.
				  	We  have  been  brought  together  b,y  the  fact  that  we  have  common  interests
				  	which  exceed  all  differences.i47    	The  talks  which  had  been  resumed  in  1971
				  	by  Zhou  Enlai  this  time  were  held  in  secret.    	Journalists  estimated  that			    	-
				  	during  the  time  that  the  U.S.   	President  was  in  China,  he  met  a  total  of  ~+0
				  	hours  with  Zhou  Enlai.48    	It  was  pointed  out  that  the  Chinese  side  did  not				-
				  	feel  it  necessary  to  condemn  American  aggression  in  Vietnam  which  was  grow-
				   	in~  stronger  at  that  time.    	Kissinger  returned  from  Bei,jing  convinced  that
				  	the  Sino-American  talks  were  worth  the  effort.    	Diplomatic  relations  be-

				   	of  a  clash  between  the  United  States  and  the  USSR,  China  wou~.d  help  the
				   	Americans.    	The  WASHINGTON  POST  at  that  time  wrote  that  China  was  tne  best
				   	assistant  of  the  United  States  on  the  world  scene.    	Regardless  of  its
				   	rhetoric,  it  was  acting  to  strengthen  tlle  American  presence  in  South  Korea
				   	and  ,Japan,  the  Philippines  and  in  Thailand;   	it  was  restrainin~  North  Korea
				   	and  North  Vietna.m;   	from  time  to  time  it  was  also  helping  in  the  United
		 	_		  	Nations.
				   	The  same  thing  was  affirmed  by  the  American  specialist  on  Chinese  affairs,
				   	S.   	Spector.    	In  the  summer  of  1.976,  he  visited  the  PRC,  and  drew  the  fol-
				   	lowing  impression  from  his  trip.    	The  Bei~jing  leadership  was  insisting  on
				   	the  maintaining  of  an  American  presence  in  Asia,   	it  was  in  favor  of  an  in-			 	-
				   	crease  in  the  U.S.   	naval  forces  in  the  Indian  Ocea.n,  and  expressed  disap-
				   	pointment  over  the  U.S.   	defeat  in  Vietnam.
				   	In  August  1977,  now  under  President  J.   	Carter,  the  U.S.   	Secretary  of  State
				   	C.   	Vance  stated,   	after  meeting  Hua  Guofeng  and  Deng  Xiaoping  in  Bei~in~,
				   	that  "a  very  serious   	exchange  of  opinions  on  many  questions,  both  global
				   	and  bila.teral,"  had  been  held,  and  the  Washington  administration  viewed  the
				   	establishing  of  ties  with  China  as  one  of  its  central  tasks.56    	In  speaking
				   	on  television,  Senator  Jackson  proposed  that  large  batches  of  American
				   	weapons  be  delivered  immediately  to  China,  and  a"more  reliable  defense"
				   	created  in  the  PRC.57
				   	On  18  May  1978,  the  NEW  YORK  TIMES  wrote  on  the  question  of  the  talks  which
				   	had  been  conducted  in  Beijing  by  the  presidential  assistant  on  national					-
				    	security  questions  Z.   	Brzezinski,  that  he,  like  no  other  of  the  American
				    	officials  is  interested  in  a  clash  between  China  and  the  Soviet  Union."
				    	In  October  of  the  same  year,  the  American  Secretary  of  Energy  and  the  for-			 	_
				   	mer  CIA  Director  J.   	Schlesinger  arrived  in  the  capital  of  the  PRC,   	as  well
				    	as  the  prominent  CIA  specialist  on  China  G.   	Lilly.58    	Finally,  on  15  Decem-
				   	ber  1978,  a  Sino-American  agreement  was  concluded  on  the  establishing  of
				    	diplomatic  relations.    	Two  days  before  this,  Deng  Xiaoping,   	in  an  inter.view
				   	with  the  American  journalists  Novak  and  Evans,  celebrated  the  concluding  of
				    	an  "alliance  against  the  polar  bear."59    	In  essence,  Deng  merely  repeated
				    	what  Mao  Zedong  and  Zhou  Enlai  had  been  assuring  the  Americans  since  194~+,60
				    	What  are  the  prospects  of  the  Sino-American  "alliance"?    	Who  ultimately
				    	will  gain  in  the  deal  between  these  forces?    	At  present,  the  balance  is
				    	clearly  on  the  side  of  the  United  States.    	Although  the  Americans  at  times
				    	make  certain  enticements  to  Beijing,  the  Maoists  are  making  more  substan-
				    	Lial  concessions,  foregoing  the  national  interests  of  China.    	An  example  of
				    	this  would  be  the  fate  of  Taiwan  which  after  all  the  "warm"  Sino-American
				    	meetings,  actually  remains  a  U.S,   	outpost  off  the  very  shores  of  the  PRC.
				    	Recently  Deng  Xiaoping  let  it  be  known  that  this  politically  and  strategi-
				    	cally  important  island,  where  the  Chiang  Kai-shek  forces  still  maintain
				    	their  base,  had  been  surrendered  to  the  United  States.    	It  can  be  asserted
				    	that  Taiwan  is  to  be  turned  into  something  akin  to  an  American  semidominion.

				  	But  certainly  it   	is  not  merely  a  question  of  Taiwa.n.    	The  Chinese  have  also
				  	made  other  concessions  to  the  United  States,  including  in  the  economic
				  	area.    	The  serious  contradictions  which  exist  between  the  PRC  and  the
				  	United  States  after  the  diplomatic  deal  between  Bei3ing  and  Washington  are
				  	not  disappearing~.    	They  are  merely  moving  deeper  into  their  relations.
				  	One  has  merely  to  recall  the  obvious  clash  of  the  long-range  U.S.  and
				  	Chinese  interests  in  the  region  of  the  Pacific,  where  the  Americans   	are
				  	acting  together  with  Japan  and  where  the  Maoists  also  have  their  plans.		 	~

				  	against  the  US5R,   	sooner  or  later  can  become  a  question  of  disputes  between
				  	them.
				  	Undoubtedly  the  American  imperialists  in  the  future  will  do  everything  to
				  	direct  PRC  policy  along  their  own  lines.    	But  the  Maoists,  in  turn,   	axe
				  	counting  on  settling  scores  with  the  Unit ed  States  in  the  future.   	With
				  	good  reason  the  head  of  the  department  of  the  CCP  Central  Committee  and
				  	later  the  Politburo  member  and  deputy  premier  of  the  PRC  State  Cour.cil,
				  	Geng  Biao,  on  21+  August  1g76,   	in  speaking  before  the  students  of  the
				  	Bei,jing  diplomatic  academy  and  in  talk'ing  about  the  "two  superpowers,"
				  	stated:    	"In  order  to  survi~re  we  should  first  of  all  side  with  one  to  be
				  	victorious  over  the  other....    	At  the  ~iven  moment,  let  th~  United  States				_
				  	protect...the  shores  of  the  East  China  Sea  so  that  we  can  concentrate
				  	greater  forces  to  offset  the  northern  power....    	When  we  feel  that  the  time
				  	has  come,  we  will  tell  Uncle  Sam:     	'Be  so  kind  as  to  pack  up'."61    	In  other
				  	words,  the  double-dealing  game  is  being  played  by  both  sides.    	Each  is  hop-
				  	ing  to  win  out  over  the  other.
				  	The  main  thing  is  that  both  the  American  imperialists  and  the  Chinese
				  	nationalists  are  dreaming  of  world  hegemony.    	In  coming  to  terms  wit h  one
				  	another,   	neither  for  a  minute  is  forgetting  his  own  and  in  some  places
				  	overlapping  aims.    	But  to  endeavor  to  achieve  world  domination  in  our  era
				 	means  to  come  into  an  irresolvable  conflict  with  life  itself.    	History  has
				  	already  shown  this  once  and  for  all.    	As  for  the  i~unediate  results  of  the
				  	deal  between  Washington  and  Bei~ing  for  the  present,   	one  thing  is  cleax.
				  	In  striving  for  world  hegemony,   	China  has  presently  become  the  defacto
				  	junior  partner  of  the  United  States.    	And  everything  points  to  a  continua-
				  	tion  of  this   	in  the  immediate  future.    	Bei~ ing  itself  has  set  out  on  this
				  	path.

											     	Introduction
				   	In  recent  years  the  struggle  of  the  populax  masses  in  the  Latin  American
				   	countries  for     	total    	national    	liberation  and  the  consolidation  of
		  	-		 	sovereignCy  has  acquired  increasing  scope.    	A  characteristic.   	feature
				   	of  this  struggle  at  the  given  stage  is  that    	it     	is     	carried	   	'
				   	over  with  increasing  frequency  into  the  area  of  international  relations,
				   	into  the  area  of  diplomacy.
				   	In  particular,it  is  worth  noting  that  the  governments  of  a  number  of
				   	Latin  American  countries    	which  have  started  to  carrp  out  socio-economic
				   	transformations  and  to  conduct  a  policy  to  liberate   	.their  countries
				   	frora  the  dominance  of  the  i.mperialist  monapolies    	are  making  broad
				   	use  of  diplomacy  to  ensure  successful  advancement  toward  these  goals.
				   	As  a  result,   	the  role  of  the  Latin  American  countries  in  the  interna-
				   	tional  arena  has  increased;their  ties  with  the  USSR  and  the  other
				   	socialist  countries,   	as  well  as  their  cooperation  with  the  developing
				   	countries  of  Asia  and  Africa,  have  expanded.
				   	These  positive  shifts  in  Latin  America  have  become  possible  thanks
				   	to  the  interaction  of  a  number  of  global,  regional  and  domestic
				   	factors,   	thE  most  prominent  of  which  are  the  fundamental  changes
				   	i.n  the  alignment  of  class  forces  in  the  world  arena  in  favor  of
				   	socialism,  which  is  exertino  an  ever  deeper  i.nfluence  on  the  course  of
				   	world  events;   	the  rise  of  the  national-liberation  struggle  and  the
				   	successes  of  the  progressive,  anti-imperialist  forces  in  Asia  and
				   	Africa;   	the  victory  of  the  revolution  i.n  Cuba,  which  has  led  to  a
				    	significant  strengthening  of  the  anti-imperialist  struggle  in  the
				   	Western  hemisphere;   	and  the  aggravation  of  the  conflicts  between
				    	the  Latin  American  countries  and  the  USA.    	The  persisCent  efforts
				   	of  the  USSR  and  the  other  countries  of  the  socialist  alliance  led
			     	�     	to  the  turn  away  from  the  Cold  War    	and.toward the  relaxation  of
				    	international  tension  and  this,as  well  as  the  tendency,  which  has
				    	developed  in  the  world,   	toward  the  further  easing  of  tension,   	toward
				   	normalization  and  the  development  of  inter-government  ties  on
				    	the  basis  of  equal  rights  and  mutual  advantage,  have  created  favorable
				    	conditions  for  the  further  struggle  of  the  developi.ng  countries,
				    	including  those  of  Latin  America,   	a  struggle  which  supports  the
				    	application  to  international  relations  of  the  principles  of  sovereign
				    	equality   	and  noninterference  in  internal  aff airs.    	They  have
				    	increased  their  aspiration  "toward  the  strengthening  of  political  and
				    	economic    	independence,"I  which  L.I.  Brezhnev  talked  about  in  the

					  	At  the  present  time  the  aspiration  toward    	economic  and  political
					  	independence  is  manifested  not  by  individual  countries  of  the  continents   	it
					  	is  a  policy  which  is   	characteristic  of  many  Latin  American  coun~:ries
					  	acting  in  a  coordi.nated  mannero    	This  exerts  a  serious  influence  on
					  	the  state  of  inter-American  relations,   	on  the  relations    	of  the  Latin
					 	American  countries  with  the    	USA  and  the  other  imperialist  powers,    	on
					  	the  strengthening  of  ties  with  the  developing  countries  of  Asia  and
					 	Africa,   	and  on  the  determi.nation  of  independent  positions  of  the  cont3.-
					 	nent's  countries  with  regard  to  the  basic  international  questions,    	The
					  	tendencies  toward  the  conduct  of  a  sovereign  foreign  policy  expand
					  	the  opportunities  for  the  further  development  of  cooperation   	between
					  	the  Latin  American  states    	on  the  one  hand  and  the  USSR  and  the  other
					  	socialist  alliance  countries  on  the  other  hand.
					  	The  development  of  these  tendencies  i.n  I.ati.n  America caused  a
					  	crisis  of  imperialist  "bloc  diplomacy,"  on  which  the  United  States
					 	had  counted  for  many  years  in  order  to  preserve  and  strengthen  the
					  	dominance  of  American  imperialism  in  this  part  of  the  globe,
					 	The  forces  of  i.nternational  and  internal  reaction  are  currently  doing
					  	everything  in  their  pcwer  to  hamper  the  conduct  of  an  independent
					 	foreign  policy  and  diplomacy  by  the  Latin  American  countries.    	However,
					 	the  tendencies  toward  the  assertion  of  an  independent  line  in  relations
					 	with  other  states  are  growing  stronger  thanks  to  the  broad  democratic
					 	forces  i.n  the  continent's  countries,  which  are  fighting  ever  more
					 	decisively  to  strengthen  these  tendencies,   	as  well  as  to  the  support
					 	which  they   	receive  from  the  socialist  nations  and  from  the  progressive
					 	regimes  in  Africa  and  Asia.
					 	The  present  monograph  is  devoted  to  a    	study  of  the  present-day  dip lomacy
					 	of  the  Latin  American  countries,   	and  primarily  of  the  tendencies
					 	~oward  the  conduct  of  an  independent  line,   	a  tendency  which began
					 	to  be  manifested     	in    	the  early  sixties  i.n  the  diplomatic  activities
					 	of  these  countries.
					 	Thus   	the  discussion  in  this  work  will  concern  primarily  the  official
					 	activities  of  the  governments,  which  express  the  views  and  interests
					 	of  the  patriotically  inclined  forces  wi.th  regard  to  the  implementation
		 	-				of  the  basic  goals  of  their  foreign  policy,  goals  which  consist  of
					 	persistently  and  efficiently  contributi.ng  to  the  consolidation  of
					 	the  sovereignty  and  economic  indep endence   	of  their  countries.    	In
					 	this  regard,  particular  attention  will  be  devoted  to  the  so-called
		 	-				diplomacy  of  economic  development,  that  is,to  the  solution  of  a  number
					 	of  the  economic  problems  of  the  Latin  American  countries  by  means
					 	of  diplomacy.    	In  view  of  the  great  economic  dependence,  which  the
		 	_				countries  of  this  region  still  have  on  foreign  monopoly  capital,  and
					 	of  the  enormous  economic  difficulties  which  they  are  experiencing,
					 	the  La~in  American  countries  attribute  particulaxly  great  significance
					 	to  the  "diplomacy  of  economic  development"  (in  a  number  of  these  cotm-
					 	tries  it  has  been  officially  declared,  for  example,  that  the  mai.n  task of
						their  diplomatic  service  lies  in  the  search  for  new  overseas  markets  for

				 	In  addition  to   	the  analysis  of  the  diplomatic  activities  of  the  progressive
		 	_		 	regimes,   	this  work  contains  an  examination  of  the  characteristics  of  the
				  	diplomacy  of  the  bourgeois-reformist  governments  which  are  in  power  in  a
				 	number  of  Latin  American  countries,   	as  well  as  the  nature  of  the  diplomacy
				  	of  the  reactionary  regimes,   	and  their  attempts  to  weaken  progressive
				  	movements  on  the  continent.
				  	As  for  the  time  frame  of  the  study,   	it  encompasses  the  period  beginning  in
				  	the  late  fifties,   	i.e.,  from  the  victory  of  the  Cuban  revolution  up  to  the	     	,	     	�
				  	present  day,   	inasmuch  as  it  is  in  this  period  that  the  tendency  toward  in-
				  	dependence  in  the  diplomacy  of  many  Lati.n  American  countries  has  manifested
				  	itself  most  clearly.
				  	An  investigation  of  the  new  tendencies  in  the  diplomacy  of  the  Latin  Ameri-
				  	can  countries  has  all  the  more  significance  in  that  these  tendencies,  like
				  	all  the  foreign  policy  activities  of  the  countries  in  this  region,   	attract
				  	the  concentrated  attention  of  politicians  and  scholars  in  the  capitalist
				  	countries;   	they  are  becoming  the  object  of  widespread  study  and  analysis.
				  	In  this  regard,   	certain  prominent  statesmen,   	politicians  and  scholars  in
				  	the  USA  and  other  western  countries  are  attempting  to  distort the  essence
				  	of  these  tendencies  or  to  completely  ignore  them.
				  	Western  authors  frequently  attempt  to  view  the  emergence  of  these  tendencies
				  	in  isolation  from  the  social  development  and  political  conditions  which
				  	have  been  established  in  a  given  country;   	they  attempt  to  represent  them
				   	as  a  simple  consequence  of  the  rapid  but  uneven  economic  development  of
				   	the  Latin  Americ~   	countries  in  the  postwar  years  ('the  achievement  of  the			    	_
								 	~
				   	age  of  majority  )  or  as  the  manifestation  of  traditional  nationalism  in
				   	these  countries  and  the  long-standing  mistrust  of  their  "rich  and  powerful
				  	northern  neighbor,"  caused  by  the  "previous  interventionist  policy  of  the
				   	USA  in  relation  to  Latin  America,    	as  a  reaction  to  mistaken,   	infl.exible
				   	policies  of  past  U.S.  governments,   	or  as  a  mutual  "misunderstanding"  which
				   	ha s  taken  root,   	etc.   	2
				   	At  the  same  time  a  number  of  UoS,  government  figures  and  historians  attempt
				   	to  mini.mize  in  general  the  significance  of  Latin  America  in  the  political
				   	life  of  the  present-day  world  and  to  downplay  the  role  of  the  diplomacy
				   	of  the  Latin  American  countries  in  international  relations.3
				   	The  facts,   	however,   	say  the  opposite:    	the  role  of  the  Latin  Americ,an  coun~
				   	tries  in  world  economics  and  politics  is  already  significant  now;   	it  is
				   	invariably  growing  and  wi11  continue  to  grow  in  the  future,    	This  is  recog-
				   	nized  by  government  officials  and  representatives  of  big  business  in  the
				   	West.    	For  example,   	according  to  Paul  Martin,  Canada's  former  secretary  of
				   	state,   	the  main  argument  that  convinces  him  that  "Canada  must  develop  clo-
				   	ser  relations  with  Latin  America  is  the  prospect  for  the  development  of				 	_
				   	this  continent;  before  the  end  of  this  century  Latin  America  will  become			     	-
				   	one  of  the  most  inFluential  regions  of  the  world."4    	The  president  of  Italy,
				   	Giuseppe  Saragat,  went  even  further  in  his  evaluation  of  the  prospects  for
				   	the  development  o�  Latin  America.    	Upon  returning  from  a  trip  to  South  Amer-

				   	American  countries  that  "by  the  end  of  the  century  this  comparatively  little-
				   	known  group  of  countries,  which  does  not  now  receive  the  necessary  atten-
				    	tion,  wi11  acquire  political  wei,ght  and  economic  might  which  Europe  will
				   	envy."6
				   	The  great  and  ever  growing  significance  of  Latin  America  is  also  recognized
	   	_				by  the  USA.    	In  1971,  Orville  Freeman,  who  was  then  the  U.S,  secretary  of
				   	agriculture,  noted,  for  example,   	that  Latin  America,  with  a  population
				   	expected  to  reach  600  million  and  gross  annual  production  expected  to  reach
				   	$300  billion  by  the  end  of  the'century  "is  too  big  a  market  to  i.gnore."~
				   	A  committee  composed  of  prominent  representatives  of  U.S.  business  and
				   	scientific  circles  and  headed  by  Saul  Linowitz,  former  U.So  representative
				   	to  the  OAS,   	studies  the  status  of  relations  between  the  USA  and  Latin
				   	America  and  periodically  publishes  the  results  of  their  investigations;
				   	in  its  December  1976  report,   	the  committee  came  to  the  following  conclu-
	  	-				sions  about  the  role  of  Latin  America  in  the  contemporary  worlds    	"With
				   	time  the  significance  of  the  Latin  American  countries  will  inevitably  in-
				   	crease.    	A  number  of  of  the  leading  Latin  American  co~mtr ias  which  are
				   	among  the  most  powerful  and  successful  countries  of  the  Third  World    	will
				   	exert  a  significant  influence  on  the  development  of  the  international  eco-
				   	nomie  order...   	The  Latin  American  countries  will  be  able  to  i.nfluence  to
				   	a  large  degree    	the  state  of  international  trade;   	they  will  play  a  central
				   	role  in  the  solution  of  the  food  problem  on  a  worldwide  scale..,"8
				   	These  conclusions  arise  directly  from  the  experience  of  American  monopoly
				   	capitalo    	It  is  well  known  that  the  United  States  accounts  for  about  40  per-
	  	_				cent  of  the  trade  by  the  Latin  American  countries  and  this  trade  brings  the		   	-
	   	_				United  States  from  $500  to  $900  million  in  income  per  year.    	Direct  private
				   	American  capital  investxnent  in  the  Latin  American  countries  reached  $15
				   	billion  in  1970,   	amounted  to  60  percent  of  all  foreign  capital  i.nvestment
				   	in  this  region  and  brought  in  net  income  of  $1.5  billion  per  year,9    	In
				   	subsequent  years  this  interest  has  increased  even  more.    	In  1973  private
				  	American  capital  investment  reached  $16.4  billion,  while  in  1975  it  amounted
				   	to  $22.2  billion.    	The  U.S.  monopolies  appropriate  one-fifth  of  the  gross
				  	national  product  of  this  region  and  one-third  of  its  income  from  export.
				   	The  total  amount  of  resources  which  thep  pump  out  of  Latin  America  greatly
				   	exceeds  the  influx  of  new  investmentsolo    	It  is  extremely  revealing  that
				  	Latin  America  remains  a  very  important  source  of  income  for  the  American
				  	monopolies;   	they  obtain  here  45  percent  of  their  profits  from  overseas
				  	activities.ll
				  	The  significance  of  Latin  America  as  the  main  source  of  many  raw  ma,terial
				  	and  agricultural  products  for  the  USA  has  grown  wi.th  the  current  raw  mater-

				  	tin    	concentrate,  96  percent  of  the  ba~cite,  34  percent  of  crude  petroleum

			     	Thus,   	the  significant  role  of  the  Latin  American  cotmtries  in  the  world				  	-
			     	economy  and  politics  is  not  a  cause  for  doubt.    	However~    	the  U.So  press
			     	periodically  contains  materials  which  assert  that  Latin  America  is
			     	supposedly  not  of  substantial  significance  in  the  world  economy  and
			     	world  politics,   	as  a  result  of  which   	.the  interests  of  American  diplomacy
			     	in  this  region  are  limited.    	The  position  of  Nixon~   	who  carried  out
			     	the  so-called  policy  of   	benign  neglect,    	is  cited    	as    	an
			     	example  of  the�secondary  role  which  Latin  America  supposedly  plays
			     	in  UoS.  policy.
			     	It  is  perfectly  obvious  that  claims  of  this  kind,  like  U.S,    	government
			     	policy  itself    	at  certain  periods,  has  been  designed  primarily  to  mask  the
			     	true  interests  of  the  USA    	in  Latin  America,   	to  cover  up  the  actual
			     	goals  of  American  diplomatic  activity  in  this  region  and  its  scale,
					to  draw  away,   	if  only  for  a  little  while,   	the  attention  of  the  Latin
			     	American  and  world  community.    	And,   	clearly,   	it  i.s_no  accident  that
			     	American  politicians,   	scholars  and  jo~nalists  have  been  persis~ent  in
					their  efforts  to  disseminate  various  versions  of  the  idea  about  the
					"limited  i.nterests"  of  American  diplomacy  in  the  Latin  American  countries
					at  precisely  the  time  when  American  state  organs  and  private  corporations
					had  begun  to  develop  furiously  their  activities  to  organize  a  conspiracy
					against  Popular  Unity  i.n  Chile  and  to  "destabilize"  the  situations  in
					other  Latin  American  coimtries  which  had  begun  to  implement  a  policy
	    	,		 	independent  of  the  USA.
					The  situation  in  Lati.n  America,   	the  foreign  policy  of  the  countries
					in  this  region,   	and  especially  the  new  tendencies  in  their  diplomacy
					attract  as  well  the  concentrated  attention  of  the  leading  capitalist
					countries  of  Western  Europe    	and  Japan;   	they  view  the  Lati.n  American
					countries  as  markets  and  capital  investment  spheres  important    	for
					themselves,   	and  they  attribute  great  significance  to  the  strengthening
					of  th~ir  political  influence  in  these  countries,  which.leads  to  the
					exacerbation  of  imperialist  conflicts  i.n  Latin  America.    	The  USA
					and  the  other  imperialist  powers  attempt  to  actively  drive  a  wedge
					in~o     	the  tense  struggle  which  is  being  carried  out  between  the
					progressive  and  reactionary  forces  in  many  Latin  American  countries
					on  the  issue  of  the  direction  which  their  diplomatic  activities  should
					takea    	As  a  result,   	the  situation  in  these  countries  is  becomi.ng  more
					acute  and  complex,   	and  it  is  essential  to  take  this  into  account  when
					studying  the  characteristics  of  diplomacy  of  the  i.ndividual  Latin
	    	-		  	American  countries  and  groups  of  countries  on  this  continent,
					Although  all  the  states  of  this  region  should  be  included  in  the
					category  of  developing  cotmtries  which  follow  the  capitalist  path
					(socialist  Cuba  is  naturally  an  exception~),  their  domestic  and

					 	are  undertaken  by  radical  urban  strata  of  the  petty  bourgeoisie,

					 	bourgeoisie.

					 	and  the  state  interests  of  any  given  country,   	even  some  of  the.reactionary

				   	Nonetheless,   	the  main  factor,  which  in  the  end  determines  the  interna-

				    	lies  in  the  irreconcilable  and  the  ever  worsening  conflicts_between

				    	inevitably  leads  to  the  growth  of  tendencies  toward  independence
				    	in  their  diplomacyo    	Despite  the  furious  opposition  of  imperialism
				    	and  its  allies  in  Latin  America,   	these  tendencies  are  gathering
				    	strength  as   	the  Latin  American  countries  become  more  and  more  convinced				  	_
				    	that  independent   	diplomacy  serves  to  protect  their  national  interes~s.
				    	Speaking  at  the  33d  session  of  Lhe  UN  General  Assembly,  A.A.  Gromyko,
				   	member  of  the  CPSU  Central  Committee  Politburo  and  USSR  Minister  of
				   	;Foreign  Affairs,  evaluated  the  role  and  position  of  the  Latin  America
				    	countries  in  international  life,   	saying:    	"Let  us    	turn  to  one  more
				    	continent--Latin  America.    	Its  role  i.n  world  affairs  is  growing --and
				    	this  is  especially  noteworthy--the  Latin  American  countries  are.   	_
				    	attempting  to  an  ever    	greater  degree  to  speak  with  an  independent				     	,

				    	the  world.    	This  is  a  positive  and  important  factor  in  international
				    	life. "14
				    	The  process  by  which  the  new  tendencies  in  the  diplomacy  of  the  Latin
				    	American  countries  are  strengthened  was  unleashed  against  a  background
				    	of  historically  conditioned  features  of  the  diplomacy  of  the  Latin
				    	American  countries,  features  which  have  left  their  own  noticeable
				    	imprint    	on  this  process.    	For  this  reason  the  analysis  ~hich  this  work
				    	provides    	of     	~he   	development  of  these  tendencies  is  preceded
				    	by  an  examination  of  the  specific    	features  common  to  Latin  American
				    	diplomacy  as    	well  as  of  the  features  characteristic  of  the  diplomacy
				    	of  individ ual    	countries  in  this  region  because  it  is  i.mpossible
				    	without  consideration  of  these  features  to  correctly  understand
				    	either  present-day  Lati.n  America.n  diplomacy  or  the  new  tendencies  which

				   	And  despite   	the  fact  ~hat  a  large  number  of  countries  on  this  continent
				   	are  still  dependent  on  the  USA,   	and  although  extremely  reactionary
				   	pro-i.mperialist  reg imes  continue  to  exist  in  Latin  America,  progressive

				   	countries  of  other  regions  of  the  world  are  comi.ng  through  more  and  more
				   	clearly  in  the  diplomatic  activities  of  many  Latin  American  countries.
				   	This  process,  which  reflects  the  objective  demands  of  .the  national
				   	development  of  the  Latin  American  countries,   	the  increased   	influence
				   	of  the  anti-i.mperialist  forces  in  these  countries  and  the  realities		     	~

				   	although  with  the  difficulties  and  complications  which  are  inevitable
				   	under  the  circumstances  of  Latin  America.
				   	The  growth  of  the  tendencies  toward  independence  in  the  diplomacy	    	~
				   	of  the  Western  hemisphere  countries  is  reflected  more  and  more
				   	strongly  in  the  situation  i.n  the  OAS  and  throughout  the  entire
				   	inter-American  system,  and  it  is  accompanied  by  an  increased  level
				   	of  participation  by  the  Latin  American  countries  in  the  world  arena.
				   	In  a  report   	to  the  25th  CPSU  Congress,  L.I.  Brezhnev  talked  with
				   	exhaustive  clarity  about  the  USSR's  relation  to  this  process:
				   	"We  support   	the  aspiration  of  these  countries  for  the  consolidation of
				  	their    	political  and  economic  independence,   	and  we  welcome  their
				   	increased  role  in  i.nternational  life, "15
				   	These  words  reflect  the  firm  confidence  of  the  Soviet  Union  that  in  a
				   	situation  of  detente  the  future of   	i.nter-American  relations  will
				   	be  found  in  a  new,   	indeper~dent foreign  policy  and  diplomacy  founded  on
				   	principles  of  peaceful  coexistence  and  that  the  countries  of  Latin
				   	America,  which  have   	embarked  on  a  path  of  anti-imperialist  struggle,  will
				   	have  every  opportunity  to  persistently  and  consistently  carry  out
				   	this  line,   	to  develop  comprehensive  cooperation  with  the  socialist
				   	alliance  and  with  the  progressive  anti-imperialist  regimes  of  o ther
				   	conti.nents,   	to  apply  forever  these  principles  to  the  practice  of

				 	ceremonies  marking   	the  250tY?  anniversary  of  the  Academy  of  Sciences  of  the
					USSR,   	"are  called  upon  to  help  the  party  find  the  best  possible  solutions

				 	further  evolution  of   	the  party's  Leninist  nationality  policy  and  the  strength-

				 	scholarly  achievements  in  the  study  of  problems  associated  with  national
				 	development  and  nationality  relations  is  one  of  the  most  important  means  of
				 	accomplishing  the  tasks  ahead  of  Soviet  historical  science~    	Such  analysis
				 	makes  it  possible  to  summarize  what  has  been  done,   	to  idantify  "bottlenecks"
				 	and  problems  still  unresolved  in  our  researches,   	to  direct  the  efforts  of
				 	our  specialists  tpward  further  study  of  those  aspects  of  the  problem  most
				 	urgently  requiring  attention,   	to  establish  the  need  for  new  studies  on  the

				 	It  should  be  pointed  out  that  Soviet  historiography,   	the  science  of  histor-
				 	ical  science,  has  made  a  considerable  stride  forward  in  its  development  over

			   	C~ne   	cannot   	reply   	to   	these   	questions   	affirmatively.     	`I'he   	novel's

			   	Therefore,   	the   	author   	goes   	considerably   	further   	than   	"artistic

				   	"Praporonostsi",   	"Tronka",   	"Tsyklon"   	or   	other  works  by   	the
				  	writer.     	l3ecause   	this   	novel   	is   	not   	an   	ordinary   	occurrance
				  	in   	the   	socialist   	realism  literature,   	and  among  Oles'   	Honchar's
				  	novels   	it   	is   	completely   	organic,   	essential   	and  innovative   	from
				  	many   	viewpoints.     	The   	essence   	of   	the   	innovation  will   	be
				  	perceived  by   	literary   	critics   	in   	time,   	but   	some   	aspects   	may			   	-
				  	be   	discuss~d   	even   	today.

				  	generation,   	about   	our   	time,   	its   	troubies   	and  achievements".6
				  	Oles'   	Honchar's   	creativity   	is   	a  brilliant   	example   	of  how
				  	generously   	the  wealth   	of   	our  native   	language   	may   	be  utilized,
				  	how   	it   	may   	be   	polished  artistically   	in   	order   	to   	be   	returned
				  	to   	the   	people   	again.     	He   	knows  how   	to   	find.the   	right   	companion-

				  	of   	the   	language   	resources.
				  	Critics   	talked  about   	the   	evolution   	of  Oles'   	Honchar's   	style
				  	for   	the   	first   	time   	back  in   	the   	1950's.	    	In   	reviews   	of
	  	-				novels   	"Ze~,,ya  Hude"  ~T.,he   	Earth   	Resounc~7,   	"Tavriya"   	and
				  	"Perekop"  LCross-Ditc~i/  we   	can   	read   	that   	the   	poetical   	quality,
				  	excitement   	so   	peculiar   	to   	"Praporonostsi'.'   	now  give   	way   	to
				  	"ordinary"   	realistic  writing,   	in  which   	the   	lyric-romaritic
				  	origin   	(as   	the   	foundation   	of   	poetical   	qualities)   	is   	expressed
				  	only   	in   	the   	form  of   	insignificant   	drops.     	A  little   	later
				  	conclusions  were   	made   	that   	the   	author  would  inevitably   	reach
				  	the   	path   	of   	"pure"   	narrative   	realism.    	However,   	this   	"prognosis"
				  	did  not   	materialize.     	But   	the   	author's   	style   	did  not   	remain
				  	unchanging,   	it   	developed   	continually.     	The   	artist's   	poetic
				  	thinking  acquired  a   	deeper   	meaning:     	from   	the   	externally
				  	effective   	poetic   	qualities   	the   	author   	dired.ted  himself
	  	-				towards   	internal   	poetry  which  has   	become   	organi.   	to  his
				  	realistic   	prose.     	"speaking   	of  poetic   	qualities,   	wrote  Oles'
				  	Honchar  himself,   	we   	mean   	first   	of   	all   	its  high   	emotional
				  	load,   	a   	deep  philosophical   	thought...   	Poetical   	qualities   	should
				  	be   	evident   	in   	the   	design,   	the   	approach   	to   	the   	theme,   	and  all

				  	Thus   	the   	poetical   	qualities   	of   	a  work  are   	already   	in   	its
				  	design,   	in   	the   	approach   	to   	the   	theme.     	The   	novel   	"Tvoya  Zorya"
