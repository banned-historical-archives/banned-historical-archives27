 #65                             Commentary             13-26 October 1965
 Principal Developments:
 25X1X6
 1.
 this period cites a CPSU emissary as declaring to a closely aligned Western
 CP that Chinese dogmatism must be combatted as an "aggressive danger" not
 only to unity of the WCM but to world Zeace itself:   China is attempting
 to precipitate a world war in which the USA and USSR will destroy each other
 and leave China on top.
 2.   Simultaneously, the U.S. Embassy Moscow cites "striking" evidence
 of "increasing Soviet willingness to air dispute with Chinese, both in pub-
 lic and private," in a series of recent developments, including:
 a.   Brezhnev-Kosygin remarks to visiting Danish Prime Minister
 Krag "went further than any such statement we have seen by responsible
 Soviet leaders";
 b.   Omission of reference to "eternal friendship and cooperation"
 between Soviet and Chinese people from slogans for October Revolution
 holiday (see Chrono, Oct. 24);
 c.   Revelation in Soviet press of Chinese/Albanian "slander and
 attacks" against Soviets at Warsaw WFTU Congress (Chrono, Oct. 8-22);
 d.   Extensive treatment in Soviet press of Prague meeting com-
 memorating 30th anniversary of Seventh Comintern Congress which has
 stronger anti-Chinese flavor than Moscow's meeting on the same subject,
 earlier in the month.
 3.    The Soviets suddenly cancel their invitation to Cambodian Prince
 Sihanouk to visit Moscow during the forthcoming 7 November October Revolu-
 tion holiday on the grounds that the leaders would be "too busy" to see him:
 they deliver the blow while Sihanouk is in Pyongyang after having been in-
 volved in the strongly anti-Soviet Chinese celebration of the CPR's 16th
 anniversary (#64), which leads to assumption by most that the cancellation
 is a reprisal.   However, the Italian Communist correspondent for L'Unita in
 Moscow speculates that the invitation was canceled because the CPSU decided
 to convene an urgent Communist summit meeting in Moscow to bolster unity
 and coordinate action to cope with the new situation in Asia.   In a remark-
 ably candid speech in Phnom Penh, Sihanouk describes the anti-Soviet treat-
 ment to which the Chinese subjected him during his Peking visit.

 4.   Indonesia becomes a new open issue in the Sino-Soviet conflict.
 The Chinese, giving unqualified support to the PKI and, to the "30 September
 Movement" with its story of trying to save the country from a CIA-supported
 "Council of Generals," openly attack the Indonesian Army and "rightwing
 forces" now ruling the country in a series of official notes, authorized
 statements and press comments.   They also criticize Soviet media treatment
 of events.   The Soviets, while expressing serious concern at the continuing
 reprisals against Communists, implicitly acknowledge that "some Communists"
 might have been involved in the original coup attempt and dissociate them-
 selves from the Chinese-oriented PKI leadership.
 5.   In a bitter, all-out political fight, the Chinese succeed in forcing
 a last-minute (1 Nov.) indefinite postponement of the Second Afro-Asian Con-
 ference scheduled for 5 November in Algiers.   In the process, they accuse the
 Algerians of distortion and trying to impose their own will on others.   Fore-
 most supporters of the Chinese campaign are recently rewarded Cambodia and
 Pakistan, while N. Vietnam, N. Korea, Tanzania, Mali and Guinea also push for
 postponement for various reasons of their own.   The turning point apparently
 comes as the Indonesians drop their insistence on following the original
 schedule.   (Detailed coverage will follow.)
 6.   The 2-week WFTU Congress in Warsaw is characterized by continuous
 acrimonious clashes between Soviet and Chinese forces, and further develop-
 ment ofindependent tendencies among the European elements.   The "voting
 machine" (as the Chinese call it) adopts resolutions somewhat more "liberal"
 than in previous years, -- and the North Korean and North Vietnamese, who
 had voted with the Chinese last year, now abstain, leaving only the Albanians,
 the Indonesians, and a few Africans to avert total Chinese isolation.   (De-
 tailed round-up will be forthcoming.)
 7.   There is a series of further suddenly called bilateral high-level
 meetings on unannounced subjects among Soviet-oriented ruling parties:
 Brezhnev to Prague; Gromyko to Cuba and East Germany; and Zhivkov to Bucha-
 rest and Moscow.
 8.   The Yugoslavs again produce the pithiest Communist criticism of the
 Chinese:   a 24 October Kristl article in Zagreb Vjesnik -- "The Great Leap
 Backward."
 Significance:
 Much of the evidence outlined above can be interpreted as forecasting
 a Soviet decision to launch a new phase of more determined and open action
 against the Chinese on the grounds that Peking has exceeded the bounds of
 ideological opposition and now threatens not only the WCM but world peace
 itself.   It may be that a Moscow summit meeting of Soviet-sympathizing par-
 ties in conjunction with the 7 November holiday will formally launch this
 new phase.  However, we would note that:
 a.   The evidence is still far from conclusive.

 b.   It is unlikely that the present Moscow Leaders will return,
 even partly, to the shoot-from-the-hip type of polemical warfare Khrush-
 chev indulged in.   If there is any noticeable change in Soviet tactics,
 we would anticipate only a slightly increased aggressiveness, evident
 more in political activity than in polemics.
 In any case, it now seems clear that the Chinese are suffering some
 significant setbacks in the very field on which they chose to do battle:
 the Afro-Asian-Latin American complex.   There is not yet any indication
 that the Chicom leaders are learning their lessons:   on the contrary, out-
 bursts like those of Lin Piao and Chen Yi and the Chicom posture in the
 Indonesian crisis indicate a further hardening of their ultra-aggressive
 line.   The question remains whether these Chinese blunders can be utilized
 by the Soviets and other CPs for their own gain or to what extent all this
 will (or can be made to) produce a general weakening of Communist influence
 in the developing areas.

 961.                          NEW CRACKS IN THE
 WORLD COMMUNIST LABOR FRONT:
 The Warsaw WFTU Congress
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  The proceedings of the Sixth Congress of the World
 Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) show how the Soviets find it increas-
 ingly difficult to maintain control of the policy and administration of
 this most significant of all international Communist front organizations.
 The divergent views of the dissenting Communist blocs were repeated over
 and over again in both the open and closed sessions held in Warsaw, Poland
 from 8 to 22 October.   The Chicoms, Albanians and Indonesians led those
 fighting the "revisionist" policy and program proposed in Secretary Gen-
 eral Saillant's report.  They took issue with both the report's adherence
 to the tenets of Soviet foreign policy and its response to the demands of
 the proponents of polycentrism.  However, the Soviet willingness to com-
 promise in favor of the latter group did not extend to all the concessions
 demanded by its spokesman, the Italian CGIL (Confederazione Generale Ital-
 iana del Lavoro).   Further, positions expressed by many delegates, notably
 the Yugoslavs, Rumanians and even the hitherto quiescent Poles and French,
 suggest that backing for the CGIL platform is growing stronger.
 Three groups:   their positions
 The Chicom group wants no accommodation with the West and feels trade
 unions in non-Communist countries should be instruments of the centralized
 Communist organization; WFTU.  They reject Soviet reliance on the princi-
 ple of peaceful coexistence, asserting there can be no coexistence with
 capitalism.  They maintain that revolutionary change and class struggle
 must be the only basis for a unified struggle against capitalism and its
 offspring, colonialism and neo-colonialism.   Labor unions must be used to
 foment revolution both in the West and the underdeveloped areas.   In sum,
 as the Indonesian delegate bluntly stated, they subordinated tactic to
 strategy.
 The Soviets, on the other hand, favor using a more flexible tactical
 approach  {.united front" or "Trojan horse").  They are working for in-
 creased contact and cooperation between WFTU and other (non-Communist) in-
 ternational labor organizations and call for the development of regional
 labor organizations:   ostensibly, because labor in different areas of the

 Approved For Release 19.0.1.1.0.1.1-M.  IA-RDP78-03061A000300050004-1
 world faces different problems; in reality, because the old approach to
 the labor target has become increasingly unproductive.  However, they
 are not willing to relinquish their control of international Communist
 labor which is maintained through the current WFTU organizational struc-
 ture.  They also continue to use WFTU organs as forums for Soviet for-
 eign policy and to expound the economic successes of bloc Socialism.
 The Italian-led bloc wants more independent action for national
 trade unions and more regional autonomy.   This would mean freedom to
 devote greater attention to their own interests, most important of these
 on the regional level, working within the context of the European Eco-
 nomic Community (EEC).   They would also deal more intensively with the
 special needs of labor and labor unions, in other words a divorce from
 the preoccupation with world politics and a recognition that Socialism
 as it operates in the Communist bloc (principally the Soviet Union) may
 not offer the only or the best solutions for workers in other parts of
 the world.   They also want a reorganization of WFTU itself, that would
 implement their position on the highest levels of international Communist
 organization in the labor field.
 Mainifestations of the three-way split at the Congress
 The program for WFTU collaboration with non-Communist labor and
 WFTU's position toward labor in capitalist and underdeveloped countries
 represents a Soviet compromise in favor of the Italian bloc (see Unclassi-
 fied Attachment T.   The Soviets bowed to polycentrism saying individual
 differences can exist, but all cannot be incorporated in the WFTU program.
 In Congress discussions Korea and Indonesia opposed the program; Rumania
 said it would abstain from voting.   The vote endorsed the Soviet position
 but was not unanimous.
 The Chicoms opposed also the solidarity or unity appeal, called for
 acceptance of the unanimity rule in Congress voting and were against the
 resolution on WFTU finances, which undoubtedly means they will continue
 to abstain from contributing to the WFTU coffers.  Last year the Chicoms
 received blanket backing from their traditional bloc of supporters.  This
 year North Vietnam (DRV) and North Korea seemed to shift away from the
 Chicoms.   In this context, it is also noteworthy that the DRV and the Na-
 tional Liberation Front of South Vietnam acknowledged Soviet support in
 Vietnam.
 The Soviets with support from Saillant and the Polish trade union
 head Loga-Sowinski chastised the Chicoms by stating that constructive
 differences are acceptable but extremist sectarian stands are not.   The
 Chilean and Argentine delegates were conspicuous among those following
 this line.   Soviet delegate Pimenov's comment on 21 October characterized
 the Soviet refusal to be baited.  He said that Soviets would not follow
 the Chicpm example of open polemics.  However, on the final day the

 Q 16                                                        (961 . Cont. )

 Soviets abandoned this position when they entered into verbal name call-
 ing with the Albanians, each labeling the other "hooligans." A sharp ex-
 change between Indian trade union leader, Dange, and a Chicom delegate
 further increased the polemics on the final day.  During the course of
 the Congress Soviet and Polish media played down the dispute but finally
 admitted it.   In contrast Unita (Italian Communist Party organ), Rumanian,
 Albanian, Czech and Chicom coverage was far more frank.
 The latter group does not share the same motivation for revealing
 this recent example of the Sino-Soviet argument.  The Chicoms refuse to
 cover up their quarrel with the Soviets realizing that this would be tan-
 tamount to capitulating to the Soviet position.   The polycentrists, who
 agree with neither the Soviets nor the Chicoms, publicize the Chicom point
 of view because to do so increases the Soviet discomfiture:
 Peking's refusal to heed Moscow's demands lends courage to others who
 desire to assert their opinions.  Their positions are certainly no
 more acceptable to Peking than the Soviet line; for example, when de-
 legates such as the Rumanians or Venezuelans found themselves with
 the Chicoms in opposition to the majority, it was not because they
 shared the Chicom premise.
 The more Peking appears at odds with Moscow the greater Moscow's
 need to. curry favor in other sectors of the Communist camp, likewise
 the better the polycentrists' chances of obtaining concessions from
 the Soviets.   There can be little question that the Soviets' perform-
 ance at this congress leaves the polycentrists with every reason to
 exploit all ways of applying pressure and suing for change.
 On the problem of WFTU organization, theSoviets again postponed a vote
 on the WFTU statute, obviously unwilling to give up tight organizational
 control; likewise the composition of the slate of new WFTU officers suggests
 that the Soviets will be able to continue to run the show much according to
 their own dictates.   They also continued to contrast the progress of the
 Socialist bloc and intra-Bloc cooperation (CEMA) with the alleged economic
 stagnation of capitalism which they say remains a slave to the profit motive.
 They focused on schisms in EEC and conpetition between EEC and other "mo-
 nopoly" capitalists, notably the U.S.   In the trade union sphere they cited
 ICFTU (International Confederation of Free Trade Unions) failures, parti-
 cularly in Latin America.   To the polycentrists in and outside the Bloc this
 continuation of the old line must appear somewhat in conflict with the new
 WFTU program, and certainly the maintenance of the myth of a single model
 of Socialism must irritate them.
 The Soviets have not abandoned their excessive preoccupation with po-
 litical matters as an examination of the content of the final appeal will
 verify (see Unclassified Attachment).  As has become customary at front
 gatherings, they emphasized U.S. imperialism principally in Vietnam in order

 to achieve a kind of artificial unity.   In this case, the consensus
 looked even more contrived since they resorted to linking U.S. actions
 with West German revanchism, trying to benefit from widespread legiti-
 mate denunciation of World War II Nazi atrocities.  Although passage
 of the resolution condemning imperialism (e.g., U.S. in Vietnam, Cuba,
 the Dominican Republic; South Africa, West Germany, and others) was
 the only show of unanimity attained on any important issue, it is note-
 worthy that the Yugoslavs, the Rumanians and Italians were absent from
 the opening exhibition on Vietnam; the speech of the Rumanian delegate
 did not mention Vietnam; Yugoslav trade union president Vukmanovic was
 restrained compared with the congress norm.
 The chorus of bloc and non-Bloc delegates taking exception to the
 standardized Soviet approach was subtle but highly provocative:
 The Poles' Loga-Sowinski criticized WFTU's concentration on poli-
 tical affairs to the detriment of genuine trade union work.  He cited
 a recent meeting of the international fisherman's affiliate as a case
 in point.  The Poles also expressed dislike of the concept of WFTU as
 one centralized organization.
 An international conference of all world trade unions and a new
 trade union organization were proposed by several speakers, notable
 the Yugoslavs.
 The Italian CGIL announced during the Congress that there was a
 split within its membership on whether to stay in WFTU.
 The Rumanians protested the use of the majority rule.  They felt
 that, if unanimity were attained in all matters, WFTU would be pro=
 hibited from engaging in certain activities without the consent of all
 members, and the equal rights of all members would be ensured.  They
 also rather obliquely inferred that WFTU did not seem to be accomplish-
 ing anything very tangible where it should be doing so, presumably in
 the area of trade union activity.
 At the end of the conference, even the French CGT (Confederation
 Generale du Travail) seemed to have moved closer to the Italian posi-
 tion.  The Congress welcomed an agreement between the CGT and the CGIL
 that would give fresh impetus to the development of unity among the
 working masses of the Common Market countries.

 PEOPLES SOLIDARITY CONFERENCE
 SITUATION:   The Communist-dominated Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity
 Organization (AAPSO) is now attempting to establish stronger links with
 Latin America.  AAPSO's Fourth Conference in Winneba, Ghana (10-16 May,
 1965) decided in principle that a three-continent conference should be
 held in Havana, Cuba in January 1966.  This decision was disputed between
 Soviets and Chicoms.   The next (fifth)`AAPSO plenary will be held in
 Peking in 1967 -- which means that, at least for the moment, AAPSO seeks
 to create a Latin American adjunct rather than a full extension and fun-
 damental change of its total structure.*
 The Afro-Asian-Latin American Peoples Solidarity Conference, now
 scheduled to convene in Havana 3-10 January 1966, has been mentioned favor-
 ably'by Moscow in connection with the 1-2 September meeting of the prepara-
 tory committee, chaired by the exiled Moroccan Communist Mehdi Ben Barka,
 in Cairo, where AAPSO is headquartered.   Cuba expresses pleasure at the
 prospect of the Conference:   the Cuban education minister, appointed na-
 tional preparatory committee chairman, called the prospective conference
 a "historical accomplishment of prime importance."  The Conference will
 coincide with the celebration of the seventh anniversary of the Cuban re-
 volution.
 The subject of a three-continent conference kept recurring at AAPSO
 meetings since December 1961.   The third AAPSO Conference, held in February
 1963 in Moshi, Tanganyika, had endorsed the idea in a resolution.   Moscow
 at the time showed little enthusiasm at the prospect, while Cuba expressed
 delight and Peking accused those who did not "dare oppose imperialism" of
 trying to undermine the proposed conference.   The Soviet and Chicom posi-
 tions are somewhat reversed today:   some interpreters felt that, at Winneba,
 the Soviets sought to have the Havana meeting replace what would normally
 be the next AAPSO Conference in an effort to minimize Chicom influence in
 AAPSO.

 The preparatory committee'srresolution states that the final list
 of Conference members will be established by the preparatory committee
 Chairman (Ben Barka) and the AAPSO Secretary General (Youssef El Sebai,
 Egypt) in consultation with the AAPSO secretariat for the representa-
 tives of Africa and Asia, and with the six representatives from Latin
 America on the Committee* for the American continent.   The resolution
 also says that the Chairman and Secretary General would transmit to the
 organizations concerned all suggestions which would help them to ful-
 fill their respective missions; invitations are to be dispatched under
 the responsibility of the Chairman, the Secretary General and the host
 country.   A report on the invitation question will be submitted to the
 preparatory committee during its forthcoming meeting in Havana before
 the Conference.
 The difficulty of selecting organizations to attend the non-govern-
 mental conference was acknowledged by Ben Barka during a visit to Cuba.
 Havana reported him at the end of September as saying that he would
 shortly send invitations to "nations" which should send the "most re-
 presentative and popular" delegations.  According to Ben Barka, "nations"
 invited should be represented by a delegation of five, and "organizations"
 invited must be consistently anti-imperialist and should set aside any
 differences among themselves; where several anti-imperialist organizations
 exist, national committees should be formed to select delegations.
 Reportedly, some 100 nations will attend as well as 50 "observerr'de
 legations" (A list of observer delegations which attended the Winneba
 AAPSO Conference is contained in an Attachment).  Efforts to achieve unity
 at the national level before the Conference are likely to run into road-
 blocks over the question of which revolutionary movements will be repre-
 sented as "official delegations.
 *Latin American "countries" represented  on the preparatory committee
 are:   Cuba -- represented by a member of its ruling party; Chile -- by the
 Frente de Accion Popular (FRAP), the left-wing but legal united front de-
 feated in the last Chilean presidential elections; Guatemala -- by the
 guerrillas of the Fuerzas Armadas Rebeldes (which started life as a front
 of three movements believing in violence); Mexico -- represented by the
 Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (a faction-ridden organization which
 incorporates Communists and other militant left-wingers including followers
 of General Lazaro Cardenas); Uruguay -- the Frente Izauierda de Liberacion
 (a legal Communist-dominated electoral front); and Venezuela -- the Frente
 de Liberation Nacional (the political organization corresponding to the
 communist guerrilla movement, and linking the CP with the militant Leftist
 Revolutionary Movement -- MIR).

 The representation issue was raised at the Cairo meeting when the Chicoms
 objected to some of the (pro-Moscow) Latin American groups Cuba proposed.
 The furor over invitations seems to have led to the potentially explosive
 decision that it would be left to the revolutionary groups in each Latin
 American country to decide who should represent them in Havana.   This
 leaves the fractionalized Latin American Communist and pro-Communist groups
 open to pressure from both Moscow and Peking.   It also puts Cuba in the po-
 sition of having the final say, since Cuba is the official host and must
 extend the formal invitations -- presumably therefore the Cubans will en-
 dorse those groups or parties favored by Moscow and thus further deterio-
 rate their relations with the Chicoms.
 The agenda (see Attachment) agreed upon in Cairo concentrates on at-
 tacks against "imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism," demands for
 greater economic rights for underdeveloped countries, and attempts to in-
 tensify "all forms" of the "revolutionary struggles" of the peoples of
 Asia, Africa, and Latin America.   While representational, procedural, and
 substantive factors will as in other fronts bring the Sino-Soviet conflict
 to the fore, the Conference organizers will focus on condemning the U. S.
 in every aspect of its foreign policy.   (See Attachment, Appeal issued in
 Cairo)
 In the four part agenda, the section dealing with economic, social
 and cultural solidarity proposals is most susceptible to Soviet exploita-
 tion and to Chinese counterattack.   These Sino-Soviet roles may well be
 reversed in discussions on the sections dealing with liberation struggle
 and with such specific issues as Vietnam, Santo Domingo, and Palestine.
 The nuclear weapons issue, as a subheading under liberation struggle, is
 particularly likely to be controversial.   But, on precedent, compromise
 resolutions of a clearly anti-American and militant character will proba-

 959.                  COMMUNIST CHINA'S FOREIGN POLICY;
 No Change in Sight
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:   China's recklessness and bellicosity were dramatically
 - and authoritatively - illustrated in September 1965 by the widely pub-
 licized statements of China's Defense Minister Lin Piao (who claimed that
 peoples' wars in Africa, Asia and Latin America are the logical prelude
 to world-wide Communist revolution) and China's Foreign Minister Chen
 Yi (who invited the US, the British, Japanese, Indians - and even Soviet
 "puppet troops" to attack China tomorrow so that they could be thoroughly
 wiped out).   These statements from men in high places are menacing and
 irresponsible, but they reveal nothing new despite the furor created in
 the world press.   China's basic commitment to violence goes clear back
 to the birth of the Chinese Revolution when it was nurtured in the hard-
 ships endured by Mao and his hunted followers in the Yenan Caves.
 Violence pervades Communist China's view of the entire globe - she
 advocates starting revolutions where they can have only destructive re-
 sults, (e.g., Congo (L), Burundi, Somalia, Indonesia); she will help to
 destroy any existing socio-political structure - including responsible,
 orderly government (e.g., Malaysia, Thailand) - to serve her own aims.
 There is no room in China's lexicon for peaceful coexistence (even as a
 means for subversive destruction of free countries); her only way is force
 of arms and violent subversion.   Chou En-lai's ill-advised proposal to
 African leaders that "Africa is ripe for revolution" is the verbal counter-
 part to CCP actions.
 Mao's infamous statement that there would still be 300 million Chinese
 left after a nuclear war perfectly embodies the quality of the concern this
 China feels for mankind.   Mao's statement does something else - it points
 up once more Chinese ignorance of the meaning of modern warfare.   Peking's
 insistence that the spiritual atom bomb (Mao's concepts plus the will of
 the people) will prevail, only highlights China's attempts to rationalize
 her failure to catch up on the nuclear front.   This stress on the spiritual
 atom bomb will undoubtedly decrease in direct ratio to the number of suc-
 cessful nuclear tests China attempts.   Talk of the spiritual atom bomb is
 deceptive in another fashion, too:   for China's foreign policy is not spir-
 itual in any sense of the word.

 China's viwes on promoting revolution on a world scale, as most
 recently outlined by Lin Piao, offer food for thought for those inter-
 ested in the welfare of their own countries as well as their own skins.
 It should be required reading for those who view recent CPR setbacks
 with any complacency.   The much quoted quip, "China is willing to fight
 to the last Vietnamese" wryly illustrates that although China regularly
 asserts the need for sacrifice in war, she never specifies just who is
 going to make that sacrifice.   It will certainly not be China in behalf
 of any of her so-called allies such as the North Vietnamese.  Not only
 has China avoided making any direct commitment to join the war in Viet-
 nam -- she has fought consistently against a negotiated settlement of
 the Vietnam conflict.   A negotiated settlement could mean a cessation
 of death, pillage, blookshed.   This, according to her own doctrine, is
 not of interest to China.
 The Chinese would like to bring about the same unsettled situations
 in other parts of the world so that they could exploit those they are
 "helping."  Certainly the "help" China is giving Pakistan in the quarrel
 with India over Kashmir is no more than egging on Pakistan to act the
 monkey's
 paw
 for China.   This Chinese "help" can only result in bringing
 confusion
 and
 bloodshed to the Indian subcontinent.  Aidit had a right

 the  official  Soviet tourist  organisation from above.
 He told us that the system of proletarian
 dictatorship had been officially declared
 dead, and replaced by " the State of the
 whole people." However, in his view, these
 were empty wards, for the people as a
 whole did not exercise power now any more
 than in the past.  Moreover the machinery
 of the dictatorship was still being main-
 tained and used to keep down those with
 dissenting views.
 He believed that the party should be
 organised in such a way as to give expres-
 sion to the true feelings and views of the
 people. He now thought that the press and
 radio were tlhae vreatures of a power clique,
 Instead of being the free instruments of
 popular opinion.  He wanted the trade
 unions to have reaq power to act on behalf
 of the workers. But he wanted all these
 changes to be accomplished constitutionally
 and legally by the Communist party itself,
 and believed that it was the duty of every
 true Communist to open the eyes of his
 comrades to the need for change.
 Sputnik attached to us a student interpreter
 named Eugene Belov. We called him
 Zhenya for short.
 We spent a great deal of time arguing
 about politics with him. We are not very
 politioa4'1y minded, but we do believe in
 the Western democratic way of life. Zhenya
 was very concerned about our political
 ignorance, and talied in every way to make
 as understand that communism was the
 best possible political system.  When we
 pointed out to him various things in the
 Soviet Union that did not appear to bear
 this out, he was always ready with a strong
 counteraarguanent.
 Often, although we knew we were right,
 his replies were so well argued than we just
 had .to leave it at that. Zhenya was recog-
 nised by all his Soviet student friends to
 be the very model of a good Communist.
 Sometimes, when we got into a political
 argument with one of the other Russian
 students, and appeared to be winning, .they
 would tell us : " Go to Zhenya, he will put

 letter to you, Mr Kosygin, making the
 same appeal, and adding that if he should
 again get no reply, he would feel bound as
 a Communist to try to obtain further
 publicity for his ideas. He proposed to do
 this by distributing to the embassies o
 the Communist countries in Moscow copies
 of his proposals.
 At this point the four of us left Masco
 to go on to Tokio for the rest of our
 holiday. When we returned, Zhenya was
 not at the airport to meet us, as he had
 promised. We went to his home, where we
 were told by the neighbours that Zhenya's
 parents and younger brother had been
 taken away by the police.  They did not
 know What had happened to Zhenya, but
 we found this out later. Zhenya was due to
 be attached as an interpreter to another
 foreign tourist group, and was told to
 report for a medical examination prior to
 this. He did, and he was declared to have
 gone mad, and put away in a lunatic
 asylum.
 Not surprised
 Sirs, we do not believe that Zhenya was
 mad when we knew him, and we cannot
 believe that he went mad during the few
 weeks we were away, without giving any
 prior indication to his friends that he was
 mentally troubled. In trying to find Zhenya
 in Moscow, we met a number of respectable
 Soviet citizens who were not at all surprised
 by our story. Some of them knew of cases
 when people who had become " politically
 unstable " were treated as if they were
 mentally unstable.

 Below
 A. Russian student friend
 of four  young  British
 people who  have   just
 returned from a holiday
 in the Soviet Union has
 been put in a Russian
 lunatic asylum for expres.
 sing unorthodox political
 opinions-that the Com-
 munist Party ought to be
 more democratic and that
 -,there must be freedom of
 the press and of trade
 unions in Russia.
 The  young  British
 people, whose circum-
 stantial                       account of  the
 affair is given in their open
 letter to the Kremlin on
 par 12, are laumcbing a
 national campaign to
 secure the release of their
 friend, Zhenya B e 1 o v.
 Previous reports of this
 kind of thing in Russid"
 were  not  always  fully'
 believed,  but  this time
 there is no room for doubt.
 The four ask all, those
 who   are  horrified  and
 distressed by the fate of
 Zhenya Belov to join them
 in their campaign.
 ZHENYA knew he was play-
 ing with fire and even told
 us he thought he might be
 arrested, but this did not deter
 him because he believed he
 was doing the right thing.
 He said that. as he was not
 married, no-one else would suffer
 if he got Into trouble with the
 authorities.
 He certainly did not think that
 the police would take it out on
 his parents and younger brother.
 It  may  well  be  that  when
 Zhenya was taken away they
 kicked up so much fuss that the
 police. decided to take them
 away too.
 When we drove up to their
 house in our search for Zhenya
 we were surrounded by excited
 neighbours who made it quite
 clear, with every appearance of
 sympathy, that the family had
 been taken away by the police.
 Our appeal is launched quite as
 much on behalf of Zhenya's
 family as of Zhenya himself.
 He was one of the few Soviet
 students  privileged  to  have
 travelled abroad-he served in
 Cuba as an Interpreter in 1962-3,
 during the Cuban missile crisis.
 He  greatly admires Dr Fidel
 Castro-
 Left-wing support
 We hope that Communists and
 people on the far Left Will take
 an especially active part in our
 campaign, because their pleas; on
 behalf of Zhenya are likely to be
 more effective.
 Ours Is certainly not an anti-
 Soviet or anti-Communist cam-
 paign. The October Prisoner of
 the Month Appeal Is also being
 made on behalf of two other
 prisoners associated with univer-
 sity youth-a professor In Chiang
 Kai-shek's  Taiwan,  imprisoned
 for  encouraging free political
 discussion among his students,
 and an Algerian student leader,
 believed to be a Communist,
 imprisoned after the fall of Ben
 Bella.
 This is In accordance with the
 policy of Amnesty International,
 des1gned to *void political bias.
 We hope that people who arer
 so  often  stirred  by  political
 persecution in RlydLt wing dic.
 tatorships will also be moved by
 their conecdence to try to help
 Z'benya.Aelov.
 (Signod)t ll NHAEL DRCKLEY.
 IF I had read this story in a
 newspaper, I doubt if I.
 would have done anything to
 help.
 I might have thought that it
 was an anti-Communist propa-
 ganda stunt, or that the facts
 were .none too clear, or that it
 did not concern me personally.
 The fact is, I have heard vaguely
 about things like this before but
 I have never really quite believed
 that they could happen,.
 I have been only moderately
 interested In politics. I have just
 graduated in philosophy at Bed-
 ford College, London, and much
 of  my  correspondence  with
 Zhenya was about what he des-
 cribed   as                                                                                       materialism  and
 idealism-materialism had all the
 answers, and ?ideaLi'm was a dirty
 word to desci1ibe what most of
 us in the West believe an.
 But Zhenya was honest. He
 really did believe, passionately,
 that the materialistic view of
 history was the only correct one,
 and that Communists  had  a
 mission to make all others think
 as they themselves thought.
 He has a very sharp Intellect,
 and at the same time he is gay,
 warmhearted. kind, sensitive to
 the suffering of others.  When
 he was talking about " the mis-
 deeds  of  imperialism  in the
 colonies" he was really con-
 cerned about the privations of
 the ,people in the under-developed
 countries.
 But above all Zhenya as one of
 us. a young man in a difficult,
 complicated world who has tried
 hard to find the right answer.
 All he was looking for was truth.
 And then they put him away,.
 It makes me shudder to think
 of him locked up in a madhouse.
 This could indeed maim him for
 life. Try to Imagine yourself in
 that position--alone  against a
 mighty Power, with your whole
 still before you, yet obliged
 to live out the rest of your days
 in a mental straitjacket.
 Can  you  imagine  yourself
 locked up in a madhouse because
 somebody did  not like your
 views ?  Would you not want
 everybody to rally to your help

 Excerpts from Novak and Evans' "Inside Report" Column
 of 26 October 1965 issue of The Washington Post
 CPYRGHT
 One small fact dramatizes the precipitous decline in Red China's
 international prestige today:  Peking's sudden, almost hysterical about-
 face against going ahead with the second Afro-Asian conference now
 scheduled to begin in Algiers on Nov. 5.
 Last summer when a coup d'etat threw out Ahmed Ben Bella as Algerian
 dictator, the Chinese were beside themselves not to let the coup force a
 postponement of the Afro-Asian conference.  With the United States then
 under growing world pressure to end the war in Vietnam, Chinese Communists
 saw the conference as a "Hate U.S.A." field day.  Red China lost, however.
 The conference was put off to November.
 But what has happened now?  Wherever the Chinese Communists still
 have political credit in the bank, they are frantically lobbying to
 postpone as long as possible the Nov. 5 conference.  As one diplomat of
 a neutralist African nation told us:   The Chinese know that any anti-
 imperialist resolution coming out of the conference would hit them as
 well as you."
 ....The political ground already had been cut out from under Peking
 when an abortive coup d'etat, backed by local Communists, rocked Indonesia
 on Sept. 30.  China's public conduct following the failure of the Indo-
 nesian coup has hardened resistance to Peking.
 The Chinese have made no pretense of disinterest in Indonesian
 affairs.  The stridency of Peking's reaction has amazed neutralist coun-
 tries.  A few days ago, for example, China sent off diplomatic notes
 angrily defending her insulting refusal to lower the Chinese flag to
 half-staff in Djakarta in memory of six Indonesian generals assassinated
 in the Sept. 30 coup attempt.
 These events in Asia ... are far better known than a second, more
 subtle reason for China's pressure to postpone the Algiers conference:
 Peking's heavy-handed power politics in the newly independent African
 states.
 China's African target is the east coast -- the part of Africa
 closest to Peking and  f u r t h e s t  from Moscow.  Significant Chinese
 "diplomatic" and "cultural" missions have been planted in a dozen African
 countries, but their clandestine political activities have aroused the
 suspicions of one country after another.

 ... In Burundi, it is commonly assumed by African politicians that
 China has been at least partially responsible for several violent efforts
 to overthrow the government.  Even though the Chinese mission (inflated
 far beyond normal size; was expelled from Burundi early this year, the
 latest assassination attempt on the Prime Minister last week is linked
 by some to Chinese intrigue.
 Underlying the rising apprehension over Chinese troublemaking was
 the red flag stat'ment made in Tanzania by Foreign Minister Chou En-lai
 last June that "conditions in Africa are favorable for revolution."
 "Chou scared the pants off every new African nationalist leader with
 those words," a U.S. specialist asserts.  One month later, Prime Minister
 Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya kicked out the New China News Agency, which was
 operating as a front for Chinese espionage.
 Another signal of growing resentment against China is the failure
 thus far of the Organization for African Unity, now meeting in Ghana's
 capital of Accra, to devote much attention to the war in Vietnam.

 FOR THE FIRST SOLIDARITY CONFERENCE
 OF PEOPLES OF AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA
 (Havana, 3-10 Jan.; 1966)
 We, the representatives of anti-imperialist organizations, forming the
 Preparatory Committee for the First Afro-Asian-Latin American Peoples'
 Conference, meeting in Cairo, September lst and 2nd, 1965 have de-
 cided upon the invitation of the United Party of the Cuban Socialist
 Revolution, to convene this historic Conference in Havana from January
 3 to 10, 1966.
 Solidarity among the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America has long
 been a reality and the coming Conference can be regarded as the climax
 of a movement which has been gaining strength along with the develop-
 ment of the national liberation struggle throughout the three continents.
 The global strategy of the imperialists who claim the right to rule the
 world constitutes a challenge to the peoples of the three continents.
 The concerted attacks launched against national independence, sovereignty,
 progress and peace as witnessed in the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, the
 Congo and Palestine and elsewhere are a clear evidence of this strategy.
 That is why this Conference will be an appropriate action to counter
 this challenge.
 The peoples of the three continents deeply realize the imperative charac-
 ter of the solidarity that should bind them and the need to co-ordinate
 their struggle against the common enemy, that is U.S. imperialism.  The
 Afro-Asian Solidarity Movement has always felt this need. In spite of
 all imperialist intrigues attempting to isolate it from Latin America, the
 movement has worked relentlessly for the realization of our common  as-
 pirations.  Likewise the liberation movements and the popular organiza-
 tions of Latin America, have succeeded to break the "tete-a-tete" with
 imperialism.
 There is a strong bond which binds the peoples of the three continents.
 They have all faced the same problems and the same dangers, namely
 oppression, exploitation, aggression and armed intervention.
 The Preparatory Committee calls upon all peoples of the three continents
 to spare no effort for the success of the first Conference of the Peoples
 of Africa, Asia and Latin America.  The Conference will mark a new phase
 in the common struggle against imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism
 and for complete  national liberation, social progress and for world
 peace.  When the U.S. imperialists attempted to invade Cuba, all the people
 of Africa, Asia and all peace and freedom loving peoples rose izp against
 that barbaric act.  The victorious Cuban Revolution, that put an end to
 the reactionary rule, and is continuously checking U.S. imperialism, is
 a guid.ng light and an example to the peoples of Latin America and of the

 Approved For Release 1999/09/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300050004-1
 Cuba has shown that revolution is possible, even 90 miles from the coast
 of the U.S.A., that the people can carry out the revolution, and that no
 force in the world is capable of standing in the way of the people's move-
 ment for liberation.
 The fact that our Conference is held in Havana during the 7th Anniversary
 of the Cuban Revolution, is in itself a tribute to the heroic people of
 Cuba,
 As seen from the agenda adopted by the Preparatory Committee, the Havana
 Conference will be an opportunity for all popular anti-imperialist organi-
 zations, in Africa, Asia and Latin America to exchange views on their ex-
 periences in the struggle for liberation and reconstruction waged by our
 peoples,  Our solidarity will emerge strengthened and our determination
 of common action would be enhanced.
 We are living a decisive stage of our history; colonialism suffers its
 death throes under the blows of the liberation struggle of formerly en-
 slaved peoples.  As long as imperialism  survives, the exploitation of
 peoples and men will continue.
 Our peoples, exploited, humilated, subjected to misery and condemned to
 stagnation for centuries, possess however immeasurable riches which have
 only served until now to provide welfare and opulence to imperialist
 exploiters and a handful, of privileged persons.  We are determined to
 put an end to this contradiction which has been the source of so much
 suffering to humanity, there is no greater force than the determination
 of the peoples to win their freedom and independence and to win peace.

 chauvinistic big-state policy of the present Soviet revisionist
 leaders.... Another question is the recommendation that the unions

 This is how differences and controversies within the WFTU originated.
 "...peaceful coexistence is the foreign policy of the socialist

 countries forced the WFTU to laud this fraud ...They even openly

 speak falsely..."

 "...The experience of the class trade unions of France,
 Italy, Japan and other countries enrich the world trade union
 movement with new forms and methods of struggle.  The road toward
 unity necessitates the patient and constructive search for mutually
 acceptable terms, the broadening of cooperation, and the  develop-
 ment of joint action to defend the interests of the working people."

 Italy, Luciano Lama, Warsaw PAP International (13 October)
 "...The voting on the subject of CGIL remaining in the WFTU
 was not unanimous -- 25 comrades in favor -- 10 against. ...All
 feel the need for establishing closer, deep, strong ties with
 other trade union organizations in the capitalist, socialist,
 and newly liberated countries... where it does not affect the class
 aspects of their policy."
 Poland, Ignacy Lgga-Sowinski, Warsaw PAP International (15 October)
 "...Each of our national organizations has and implements
 its own program.  The WFTU program cannot be the sum of these
 programs.  It is also not true that the present line of the WFTU
 reflects the position of one central trade union organization.
 It is almost certain that a different line introduced to the 6th
 Congress by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions will not be
 and cannot be the WFTU line in the future.  The method of adopting

 M.    Comrade Krasucki from CGT and Comrade Lama from the CGIL
 gave us a beautiful example of creative and constructive dis-
 cussion in their speeches...
 "...too much eagerness among some delegates flattering
 faulty points of view and unjustified and irresponsible attacks
 against one or the other great federation, have done the worst
 service to the cause of unity...
 "...Professional problems in the activity of WFTU interna-
 tional affiliations, in the cooperation with specialized trade
 unions, call for much more attention than previously..."
 4rand, Ignacy Loga-Sowinski, Warsaw Domestic Service (8 October)
 "...WFTU rejects the fatalistic idea about the inevitability
 of war.  War can be prevented.
 "The WFTU put forward two imperative principles required
 for implementation of the policy of peaceful coexistence. ...non-
 interference in the domestic affairs of other countries. ...com-
 plete freedom of choice by every nation of its political princi-
 ples and system.
 "...necessary for ICFTU to change its present methods of work.
 Also correct is the attitude of the WFTU which...does not treat
 the ICFTU as a uniform force of militant anti-communism or a
 tool of the cold war, since our view is that the membership of
 WFTU, the ICFTU and the International Federation of Christian
 Trade Unions cannot and should not constitute an obstacle for
 trade union cooperation..."
 "...Bearing in mind the importance of this WFTU Congress
 attended by all affiliated organizations, we consider  that it
 would have been particularly apt and useful if the reports make
 a more thorough-going analysis of the concrete activity of the
 WFTU...and...executive bodies.  This would enable a clearer view
 of the good results as well as shortcomings.

 "...cooperation regardless of ideological orientation is the
 only way leading to the elimination of misunderstanding, to broad
 trade union cooperation, and to the formation of wide foundations
 for a new world trade union organization -- would primarily have
 to respect the right of  every trade union independently to choose
 the forms of its activity.  Each trade union  also would inde-
 pendently decide in which actions to participate. ...no question
 of a majority and a minority...the difficulties now confronting
 the international trade union organization would be solved.
