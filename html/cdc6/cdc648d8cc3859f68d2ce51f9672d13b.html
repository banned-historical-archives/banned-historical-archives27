 The demonstrations on April 5, which seemed designed to put pressure on the
 party's left wing to ease up on its campaign against Teng Hsiao-ping, instead
 precipitated his removal from office.
 The Central Committee announcement that Teng Hsiao-ping has been dismissed
 from all his positions inside and outside the party specifically links this move to the
 demonstrations on April 5. The left successfully seized this opportunity to bring
 more serious charges against Teng.
 The announcement indicated that the events of Monday had changed the
 situation-Teng's case "turned  into" one requiring  punishment rather than
 persuasion. In contrast to this unequivocal indictment, a party directive issued in
 late February or early March indicated that Teng was at that time in a relatively
 good position to survive the attacks on him. It reportedly stated that Teng was not
 to be "struck down" and that his case was different from those of party leaders
 purged in the recent past.
 The wide international coverage of Monday's events clearly angered and
 embarrassed Mao and the left, and may have enabled them to win the support of
 moderates on the Politburo for the removal of Teng.
 Teng is obviously completely out of the succession sweepstakes, but he retains
 his party membership and has been given a chance to make amends for his errors.
 Teng's removal does not appear to be an unqualified victory for the party's left
 wing. Although the decision on his case was "unanimous," indicating his supporters
 abandoned him, concessions from the left may have been involved. One such
 concession could be that the announcement on Teng is to mark the end of the
 current political campaign. Indeed, the editorial published Tuesday seemed more
 sharply focused on Teng alone than any previous articles, and the reappearance on
 April 7 of Politburo member Li Hsien-nien, one of Teng's staunchest supporters who
 had been absent from public view since mid-January, suggests that other supporters
 of Teng will not suffer.
 The appointment of Hua Kuo-feng as premier and as first vice chairman of the
 party may also be part of a compromise solution. Hua is not in the leftist camp and
 was attacked by leftists in 1974. There is also some evidence that he may have been
 subject to indirect attacks from the left during the campaign against Teng. In any
 event, his elevation to first vice chairman of the party, a spot left vacant with the
 death of Chou En-lai, suggests that the removal of Teng will not necessarily allow
 the leftists to increase their influence significantly in the top leadership. Hua was
 promoted over Wang Hung-wen, a young party leftist who had been next in line for
 the first vice chairmanship.

 The appointment of Hua to the premiership, together with the reappearance of
 Li Hsien-nien, the parity's leading economic specialist, suggests that the government
 will continue to pursue with little change the ambitious economic policies set by the
 moderates in recent years. Indeed, the preservation of moderate policies on a broad
 range of issues has undoubtedly been foremost in the minds of moderates in the
 leadership.
 Teng's backers may have agreed to drop their support of him once they were
 assured that the relatively moderate Hua would become premier and would be
 promoted to a position in the party of sufficient stature to give him a major say in
 policy issues. Hua's new party position, leaving him second only to Mao, gives him
 that stature.
 Hua is closely identified with the effort to modernize agriculture and, when he
 was acting premier, he frequently indicated there would be no change in China's
 foreign policy. Others in the leadership, who may have opposed the abrasive Teng
 for personal reasons but did not differ with him over policy issues, may now close
 ranks with those who personally supported Teng, thus giving the moderates a major
 voice in policy matters.
 Apart from the factional opportunities and disabilities arising out of Monday's
 disturbances, the leadership as a whole was probably considerably shaken by the
 demonstrations. Although they may have been encouraged by some officials, the
 demonstrations revealed a depth of popular feeling about the late premier Chou
 En-lai and the policies he stood for that has no real precedent since the communists
 took power. Large-scale demonstrations apparently were confined to the capital, but
 pro-Chou manifestations also took place in the past week elsewhere in China.
 To some extent, this outpouring of feeling was made possible by the continuing
 uncertainty about authority in Peking: Hua Kuo-feng were merely an "interim"
 acting premier, Teng Hsiao-ping remained under attack but was not out of the
 picture, and the leftists had not been able to impart momentum to their campaign of
 denigration. Most leaders may have believed that a decisive display of authority,
 indicating the upper levels of the regime could contain their differences, was in
 order. All were also undoubtedly acutely concerned about the image of confusion
 and unbridled rivalry that was being presented to foreign observers, particularly in
 the Soviet Union.
 The decisions of April 7, however, certainly do not provide a long-term
 solution to China's leadership problems. The People's Daily editorial of April 6
 acknowledged-for thE! second time-that the Central Committee of the party
 remains split. Given the depth of public sentiment revealed on Monday and the
 relatively powerful position of the moderates in positions of authority throughout
 the country, a "backlash" against the left is still a real possibility. Another round of
 struggle is almost certainly in the cards, perhaps even before Mao dies.

 The current situation is still fluid, and further changes in the leadership may be
 decided at the leadership meetings now under way in Peking. Further indications of
 the present pecking order may be available in a few days, but a new leadership
 lineup may not be fully revealed until May 1.

 Syria has kept several patrol boats on the naval blockade of Tripoli and may
 now be using helicopters to support the blockade and its forces inside Lebanon.
 A source of the US defense attache in Beirut says helicopters have been
 assisting a Syrian ground force that crossed into northern Lebanon on Tuesday. The
 force, reportedly dressed in uniforms of the Syrian-controlled Saiqa fedayeen
 organization, was described as being about brigade size-which could include as
 many as 2,000 troops-with some 100 to 150 vehicles, including armored personnel
 carriers.
 Damascus has moved larger numbers of Syrian regulars into Tripoli instead of
 into central or southern Lebanese cities presumably to minimize the chance of an
 Israeli countermove. The attache's source reports that the mission of the Syrian
 force appears to be to control the area between Tripoli and the air base at Kleiat.
 The Syrians may calculate that the Israelis, albeit apprehensive, will continue to
 tolerate a gradual buildup of Syrian regular forces inside Lebanon if they are
 disguised as fedayeen and do not have armored units with them.
 Damascus hopes that Tel Aviv will continue to act with restraint, knowing that
 the blockade and infusion of forces in the north will deny arms to the leftist and
 Muslim militias. Syria will also be able to exercise greater restraint over the forces of
 rebel army leader Ahmad Khatib, which are well represented in the Tripoli area.
 With this show of force in the north, Syria probably intends to convince the
 Lebanese leftists that they must push ahead with plans to replace President
 Franjiyah, and avoid sparking a new round of heavy fighting. The danger is that it
 might fail to intimidate the leftists, and cause Damascus to misjudge the limits of
 Israeli tolerance for a similar move in central or southern Lebanon.

 A French government spokesman announced yesterday that Georges Gorse, a
 former minister and diplomat, will leave for Lebanon today on a "fact-finding"
 mission but emphasized that he is not charged with carrying out a mediation effort.
 One person was killed in Horns, Syria, early this week when police broke up a
 demonstration organized by the Muslim Brotherhood in support of the Palestinians
 in Lebanon and in protest against Syria's relatively even-handed role in trying to
 negotiate a settlement.

 Trade unionists have reacted negatively to Chancellor of the Exchequer
 Healey's proposals for a 3-percent wage limit, but they have not rejected the plan
 outright.
 Union leaders met with Healey yesterday in probably the first of many
 bargaining sessions over the government's pay policy. Difficult negotiations lie
 ahead, but a compromise will probably emerge by June that will satisfy union
 members and help slow the rate of inflation.
 A Trades Union Congress official told US diplomats in London that while
 union leaders had been aware for weeks that Healey intended to offer tax relief in
 return for wage restraint, they were genuinely shocked by his 3-percent restriction.
 Inflation is currently running at an annual rate of 17 percent.
 Len Murray, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, described Healey's
 offer to cut taxes in exchange for a union promise to limit wage demands as only "a
 starting point." He also said the unions would produce their own figures on just
 what the tax cuts would mean to the average worker.
 Unions representing skilled blue collar and well-paid white collar workers
 object to a 3-percent limit. These unions have been particularly annoyed by the flat
 rate wage increase that has brought their members closer to the average pay scale.

 Turkish government and military leaders are generally pleased with the new
 US-Turkish defense agreement and expect little trouble in obtaining parliamentary
 approval, provided the pact is also approved by the US Congress.
 The government has been assisted by the negative Greek reaction to the
 agreement. National Salvation Party Deputy Chairman Emre underscored this by
 asserting the Greek reaction is "proof enough it is a good agreement," and this
 apparently is the attitude of many Turks.
 Opposition leader Bulent Ecevit has all along expressed doubts about Prime
 Minister  Demirel's handling of the defense agreement negotiations. He has
 apparently concluded, however, that the agreement meets enough of Turkey's needs
 to warrant ratification. While Ecevit claims he could have obtained better terms and
 concluded an agreement sooner, he apparently will instruct his party to vote
 favorably on the agreement.
 The Turks are still concerned about approval of the agreement by the US
 Congress. Prime Minister Demirel is no doubt aware that his shaky coalition might
 come apart if the Turkish parliament approves the pact only to have it defeated in
 the US. Therefore, he may try to stall formal parliamentary consideration until after
 the US Congress acts.
 The negative Greek reaction to the agreement has given Demirel's coalition
 government a significant boost, but the Prime Minister realizes he needs US
 Congressional approval of the agreement to cement his gains. To improve prospects
 for US ratification, the Turks may devote more energies to lobbying efforts. More
 tangible actions, such as significant concessions on Cyprus, are not likely in the near
 future.

 South African Prime Minister Vorster is scheduled to arrive in Israel today for a
 short visit at his initiative. There is no indication what Vorster wishes to discuss with
 Israeli officials, but he will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Muller.
 During the 1960s, the relationship between the two countries was at a low level
 because of Israel's efforts to foster relations throughout black Africa. South African
 and Israeli relations have prospered in the period since the October 1973 war, which
 all but erased Tel Aviv's diplomatic presence in black Africa. Both governments have
 raised their diplomatic missions to embassy level and fostered close economic and
 cultural ties.
 Nevertheless, the Israelis view the Vorster visit with some concern and
 apparently agreed to the trip only after constant prodding from Pretoria. Tel Aviv
 fears the visit will disrupt its present low-key but vigorous efforts to re-establish ties
 with black Africa. The Israelis are downplaying the visit by describing Vorster as a
 "guest of Prime Minister Rabin" rather than announcing the visit as an official one.
 The Israelis almost certainly will be watching for African reactions to the visit
 during the meeting of Arab and African foreign ministers that opens in Dakar on
 April  19.  The  meeting  is  intended to bolster Afro-Arab cooperation.

 President Neto has reportedly made an offer to settle differences with the
 National Union.
 In exchange for an end to guerrilla activities, Neto indicated he would accept
 members of the National Union into the Luanda government. The offer would
 exclude National  Union  leader Savimbi, however, from  any discussions or
 participation in the government. National Union officials have said they are willing
 to negotiate, but only after foreign troops are removed from Angola. Thus,
 prospects for reconciliation are poor at this time.
 An advance force of Popular Movement and Cuban troops was in position
 around the Angolan side of the Cunene hydroelectric project on April 5. The arrival
 of Cuban forces in southern Angola was confirmed by South African defense forces.
 Construction on the hydroelectric project resumed on April 6 after the South
 African government and the Popular Movement agreed to guarantee the security of
 construction sites, workers, and machinery. The two governments reportedly also
 agreed to respect each other's borders and to establish check points to control
 workers as they transit the area.
 South Africa will probably continue its defensive preparations along the
 Namibian border. The arrival of more Cuban and Popular Movement forces will
 increase the possibility of  minor clashes in the area.

 Prime Minister Somare on March 26 presented a compromise package to
 parliament that would reestablish provincial government for Bougainville within
 Papua New Guinea.
 Somare rejected provincial government for Bougainville a year ago, but is now
 calling the proposal the last chance to settle the Bougainville secession problem
 without a confrontation. Bougainville, whose large copper mines are the main source
 of the country's foreign exchange, tried to secede last September and was the scene
 of civil disorders in January.
 Major features of Somare's package, which are to be completed by December,
 include:
 --Revocation of the order last year to suspend provincial government in
 Bougainville.
 --A provincial election within 30 days of the revocation order.
 --Transfer of various payments frozen since last year.
 --Establishment of a joint committee to allocate powers between Port Moresby
 and Bougainville.
 --Amendment of the constitution to allow the establishment of provincial
 governments as districts become ready.
 Parliament's reaction to the plan was favorable, and the package will probably
 be approved. The most ticklish issue remains the allocation of powers between the
 provinces and the central government. Despite Somare's genuine desire for an
 amicable settlement, long and bitter sessions are expected before the issue is
 resolved. The outcome of the Bougainville talks could set a precedent for similar
 arrangements with other regional groups.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA-EGYPT: Czechoslovakia will end all arms deliveries to
 Egypt when current agreements expire in 1977, according to a senior Czechoslovak
 diplomat in Cairo. Czechoslovakia still has an estimated $2 million in ammunition
 and ground force equipment to deliver. During the last five years, Czechoslovakia
 has provided Egypt with modest levels of ground force materiel, including armored
 personnel  carriers and  medium tanks.

 IRAN-CUBA: Iran has broken diplomatic ties with Cuba over a publicized
 meeting last month between Cuban Premier Castro and the leader of the outlawed
 Iranian Communist Party. Formal relations between the two countries were
 established only 14 months ago. The two men met in Moscow while attending the
 Communist Party congress. Press accounts of the meeting included statements of
 support by Castro for the Iranian party. Despite efforts by Cuba and the Iranian
 communist leader to minimize the significance of the meeting, the Shah regards the
 incident as a gross intervention in Iran's internal affairs.
