 Annex
 Scope Note
 This National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) was requested by the Department of State and Pacific
 command. It discusses how relations between China and Taiwan will develop in the next three
 years--toward greater tension and hostility or toward cooperation and accommodation? We
 selected this time frame because it encompasses the presidential election in taiwan in March
 2000, the US change of administration in January 2001, and a new Party Congress in China that
 should he held in 2002.
 The key assumption;, which we will hold constant throughout the period of this Estimate,
 ?       Neither side experiences fundamental change in its political system or major domestic
 upheaval.
 4       The US global superpower role and the US alliance structure in the region will not
 change radically.
 The cross-Strait military balance has been examined in other Intelligence Community studies,
 particularly NIE 98-05,China's Conventional Military Forces: Current Status and
 1-'ulure Capabilities (1998-2008), June 1998. Consequently, we will focus primarily on the
 strategic political and economic factors of cross-Strait relations, noting the military factors when
 relevant to this analysis. Later this year we will publish a National Intelligence Estimate on
 China's Strategic Priorities and Behavior.
 In the text when we use the term "China," we are referring specifically to the People's Republic
 of China (PRC). When we use the term "Taiwan." we are referring to the authorities on Taiwan,
 who prefer the term "Republic of China."
 In assessing the objectives and perceptions of both Beijing and Taipei, we have used a variety of
 I reporting. The available information provides a strop
 evidentiary base for our conclusions.
 t.'hl?onolo y of Cross-Strait Develo2mentsL_J
 Key Judgments
 The most likely outcome in cross-Strait relations over the next three years is a dynamic and tense
 environincnt. Tension is likely to remain high or rise, and rising tension increases the chances of
 Inilitary incidents.[j
 We judge that, over the period of this Estimate, chances are better than even that China will
 conduct a major military exercise near Taiwan as it did in January-March 1996. Also, chances
 are better than even that there will be small-scale incidents between the military forces of China
 and Taiwan ranging from an accidental air incident to the seizure by Beijing of a lightly manned
 offshore island. We judge chances are very low, however, that Beijing will actually follow
 through with large-scale combat operations, such as invading Taiwan or a heavily defended
 offshore island, conducting missile attacks against targets on Taiwan, or blockading Taiwan with
 air or naval forces.
 We assess chances of major sustained conflict are low because:
 A full-scale military assault presents formidable materiel and human costs with a large
 risk of failure for China.
 ? l)olnestic factors on both sides will contribute to a tense atmosphere but also will bound
 the risk each side is willing to take to gain its objectives. Taiwan's new leaders will try to
 avoid antagonizing China to the point it would disrupt Taiwan's economy and stability.
 To avoid arousing criticism within the Politburo, Chinese leaders will appear firm in
 dealing with Taiwan, but they will be wary of bold moves that could backfire and play
 into the hands of political opponents.F1
 a China's perceptions of international actors-notably the power and influence of the United
 States-will constrain China's behavior.
 We see prospects as likely for generally increasing tension because:
 China sees trends on Taiwan as unfavorable and is concerned that time will run out on its
 reunification objectives. China will be inclined to continually weigh coercion as well as
 military power as principal means of dealing with separatist sentiment in Taiwan.
 Taiwan will continue to press its desire for increased international status and freedom of
 action from China. The controversy that erupted over Lee Teng-hui's assertion of a
 "special state to state relationship" with the mainland illustrates Taiwan's approach.fl
 Key Drivers
 We assess key drivers that will determine relations across the Strait will include:
 Internal Politics
 Taiwan is a hot-hutton issue within the Chinese leadership and leaders cannot afford to appear
 "soft" on Taiwan. Leaders on Taiwan would risk loss of popular support if they were perceived
 as jeopardizing Taiwan's security.
 Legitimacy and Respect
 Beijing perceives the Taiwan issue as an internal matter and expects the international community
 to accede to its wishes on Taiwan and adhere to "one-China" policies (that most countries have
 formally accepted) because it is an emerging great power that deserves status, respect, and, on
 the question of Taiwan, deference. Taiwan perceives it should have international legitimacy
 because it is a democracy with economic power.
 Legacy
 Leaders on both sides of the Strait perceive their personal legacies will be enhanced if they can
 make progress on dealing with the other side. But their key objectives are incompatible.
 Perceptions and Expectations of the United States
 US policies are significant to the attitudes of both sides. China sees Washington as encouraging
 Taiwan's separatist stance but also calculates that it can restrain US actions in support of Taiwan.
 Taiwan perceives it has strong support in the US Congress and media for its objectives. Both
 sides will increase efforts to test the current or a new administration in Washington-Beijing by
 pressing the United States on arms sales, Taiwan by looking for additional security guarantees.
 China: Options Against Taiwan)
 Concerns for the United States
 In the situation of worsening tensions, we have identified potential responses to crisis by China
 including restraint, saber rattling, and punishment of Taiwan
 Exercise Restraint
 Military pleasures range from returning to normal military deployments along the Strait to
 conducting small-scale, Taiwan-focused exercises on the Strait. Diplomatic activity would range
 from toning down rhetoric against Taiwan's leaders and maintaining longstanding efforts to limit
 Taiwan's international activity. Economic measures would include encouraging Taiwan to
 resume the "three links."
 Rattle its Saber
 Military measures would range from large-scale force deployments opposite Taiwan to
 deploying an out-of'-area ground, airborne force to Fujian province (opposite Taiwan).
 Diplomatic measures would range from canceling talks between cross-Strait negotiators to public
 hints at the need for a reunification timetable. Economic measures range from warning other
 countries of economic consequences of continued engagement with Taiwan to closing the Strait
 to shipping with lengthy military exercises.
 Punish Taiwan
 Military measures range from bombarding a Taiwan-occupied island to seizing such an island.
 Diplomatic measures would include demanding an immediate cessation of US arms sales to
 Taiwan. Economic measures would range from spreading rumors in the Taiwan business
 community that military action is impending to blockading a key Taiwan port.
 China could attempt to blockade or invade Taiwan, but Beijing recognizes this would risk war
 with the United States. In our judgment, such a war is highly unlikely during the period of this
 Estimate because of the reasons stated above.)    I
 Movement Toward Reconciliation
 Less likely, we assess, is a situation in which the various drivers interact to bring about an
 amelioration of tensions across the Strait. For example, economic interaction is seen by both
 sides as important, and economic interdependence could create more favorable conditions for
 political and military restraint. Also, the desire for legacy could cause leaders on both sides of
 the Strait to resume unofficial talks, hold secret talks, or even less likely, hold a summit to make
 progress on outstanding differences. In this outcome, China most likely would reduce its reliance
 on the military option and seek to engage Taiwan increasingly through economic, social, and
 political intcraction.fl
 Discussion
 Introduction I
 Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's 9 July 1999 declaration that cross-Strait ties are a "special
 state-to-state relationship" and Beijing's sharp verbal reaction--combined with the thus-far small-
 scale military posturing across the Strait--is the latest in a series of moves and countermoves
 across the Taiwan Strait ongoing since 1991 (see inset). In our view, Lee's statement was as
 much designed for Taiwan's coining presidential election as for cross-Strait or international
 effect. Beijing has interpreted his statement as a further push for Taiwan's independence and has
 reacted vehemently. The ensuing crisis could worsen, especially if Beijing feels compelled to
 resort to greater military pressure to persuade Taiwan leaders to moderate Lee's statement and to
 influence Taiwan's March 2000 presidential election.
 A key issue for the United States is whether tensions can be contained in cross-Strait relations, or
 whether they will move toward military conflict. US interests also would be affected favorably
 by a shift toward accommodation, which we see as much less likely.
 What China Wants
 The PRC's long-term objective is reunification. Within the time frame of this Estimate, Beijing's
 goal will be to prevent further Taiwan steps toward permanent separation. Using Deng
 Xiaoping's "One Country, Two Systems" formula, Beijing states that Taipei can have a high
 degree of autonomy but must recognize it is part of "one China." Beijing's vision of a unified
 China, however, is not clear. China tends to identify more clearly that which it will not tolerate--
 for example, a Taiwan formal declaration of independence--than precisely what Beijing wants.
 China's strategic objective stems directly from its perceived "century of humiliation," wherein
 superior powers--Western countries and Japan--carved out spheres of influence and controlled
 Much of China's economy, politics, and social affairs. Territorial unification became a symbol of
 the Chinese revolution for both nationalists and communists. Today, the Chinese Communist
 Party sees its own legitimacy as entwined with its ability to show progress toward the goal of
 reunifying Taiwan with the mainland. Taiwan's status also is a deeply emotional issue for many
 Chinese leaders and citizens.If
 Beyond this, China perceives Taiwan as a security problem. Chinese officials fear that Taiwan
 might develop closer military cooperation with a foreign military power such as the United
 States or Japan. Some Chinese officials have stated, for example, that Japan could cooperate with
 Taiwan in posing a barrier to China's regional and global influence. Some Chinese leaders point
 to the military alliance between Taiwan (the ROC) and the United States prior to the
 normalization of US-China relations on 1 January 1979. The PRC also wants to eliminate
 Taiwan as a base for subversion in case of domestic turmoil on the mainland.
 We assess Beijing over the next three years will:
 Try to limit EIS support for Taiwan, particularly by pressuring Washington to cease, or at
 least reduce, ands sales to Taipei.
 Continue to seek to undercut Taiwan's international standing by competing with Taipei
 for diplomatic recognition, seeking to reduce even further the small number of states that
 recognize Taiwan as a legitimate government.  China's approach was clearly manifest
 when in February it vetoed a UN Security Council resolution continuing UN
 peacekeeping forces in Macedonia because the Macedonian Government established
 diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
 Beijing perceives that such US support encourages the island to assert its dejure
 independence; by eroding US support, China thereby hopes to reduce the potential for
 Taiwan to move toward permanent separation from the mainland.
 Oppose 'l'aiwan's membership in international bodies in which statehood is required,
 including the United Nations, and try to circumscribe the amount of influence Taiwan has
 in organizations in which it is a nonstate member.
 Continue to insist on the "three links" (direct shipping, communications, and air
 transportation) with Taiwan as steps toward political reunification."- China's leaders also
 will encourage rapidly growing economic ties to Taiwan as both a source of growth and
 employment in China and as a means of developing a constituency in Taiwan favorable
 to reunification. Beijing also insists that the reunification process begin with "political
 talks to end the state of hostilities," in addition to the "technical" confidence-building
 talks between unofficial representatives that have proceeded off and on since 1992.
 1 Jse rhetoric, political, and military actions to seek to move Taiwan leaders and voters
 away from taking steps toward greater independence.
 What Taiwan Wants
 Taiwan's principal objective is to determine its own future, with future options including de jure
 independence, or, alternatively, some type of formal accommodation with China. Taipei wants to
 make these decisions on its own without bowing to pressure from China or others. For the period
 of this estimate, we assess Taiwan will continue to try to maximize its freedom of action while
 benefiting economically from growing cross-Strait trade and investment. Taiwan wants to avoid
 accceptance of the PRC's concept of "one China" and has offered its own framework for cross-
 Strait ties.
 China-Taiwan: Divergent Views on Cross-Strait Relations
 China's View El
 Both sides should adhere to the principle of "one China."
 Taiwan, is port of China. China's territory and sovereignty cannot be separated.
 China should be unified under the formula of "one country, two systems."
 Trvo sides should negotiate peaceful reunification step by step beginning with political talks on
 cessation of hostilities.
 Prefers peaceful ramification but will not renounce right to use force.
 Taiwan's View El
 There is no "one-China" now.
 Taiwan and the mainland are separate and equal "states.
 Unification could come gradually after political democratization and economic reform on the
 mainland.
 .Substantive discussions to improve cultural, trade, and economic ties are mutually beneficial.
 Political talks ore acceptable if China accepts Taiwan's "state-to-state"formula.
 Mainland nuist reciprocate Taiwan's 1991 renunciation of force.
 Divergent Views
 We assess Taiwan, in pursuit of its strategic objective will:
 Continue to promote its international identity. Besides competing with Beijing for
 diplomatic recognition in developing countries, Taiwan will use "pragmatic diplomacy"
 to seek to enhance ties to the United States, Japan, European, and other developed
 countries. Taiwan will view responsible participation in the international community as
 strengthening its case.
 Take into account--while trying to shape--popular opinion in the formulation of its
 objectives. As an emergent democracy, Taiwan's leaders are heavily influenced by public
 attitudes, and polls suggest that Taiwan's people do not favor either unification with the
 mainland or a formal declaration of independence that would bring down the wrath of
 Beijing. Public opinion strongly supported Lee's assertion that Taiwan's political status
 was equal to that of China, but the Taiwan public remains highly sensitive to threats to
 prosperity and stability.F-l
 The View From Beijing
 China on balance secs political and social trends as unfavorable to achieving its objectives as
 Taiwan remains separate, and shared bonds gradually dissolve. Taiwan's democratic evolution
 has strengthened Taiwan's de facto independence, particularly as Lee Teng-hui has asserted
 Taiwan's status.
 Beijing is particularly concerned that the United States supports Taiwan's continued separation
 from the mainland, as is evidenced by political and military support, including arms sales to
 Taiwan. China, for example, has vociferously decried Theater Missile Defense (TMD) for
 Taiwan, especially because Beijing recognizes the political implications of TMD. Wang Daohan,
 former Mayor of Shanghai and China's chief negotiator with Taiwan's representatives, told a
 visiting US delegation that TMD "would completely change the strategic equation between the
 United States, China, and Taiwan." Similarly, Chinese officials have observed that China could
 handle the military challenge of TMD by building more missiles, but that TMD would
 nevertheless weaken the deterrent that China's missile threat poses to Taiwan's international
 activities. Other information indicates that China intends to mount an all-out diplomatic
 offensive against TMD, specifically TMD involving Taiwan.
 Despite unfavorable trends, however, Beijing does perceive that it has been able to arrest to some
 degree Taiwan's path to independence.
 Chinese leaders believe the 1996 missile tests discredited the platform of the Democratic
 Progressive Party, which supported an independent Taiwan, and that the numbers of
 those on Taiwan who advocate a declaration of de jure independence have declined.
 China sees its military buildup opposite Taiwan as restraining calls for independence on
 the island.
 China has been able to block Taiwan's attempts to gain formal international recognition.
 China was heartened by President Clinton's statement in Shanghai in June 1998 that the
 United States would adhere to "three no's" (no support for Taiwan independence, no
 support for one China/one Taiwan, and no support for Taiwan representation in
 international bodies where state membership is required) in dealing with Taiwan. China
 also reacted favorably to US statements and diplomatic efforts reaffirming a one-China
 policy after I,ee's 9 July statement.
 ?  Beijing also is pleased with the expansion of trade and investment across the Strait;
 Chinese officials believe greater economic interdependence builds a sympathetic
 constituency for reunification on Taiwan.
 Beijing nevertheless believes its efforts are only a holding action. Such efforts have constrained
 Taiwan's freedom of action, but its sense of a separate identity grows and its appeals for US
 support persist. And, in this view, time is not on China's side. China's power and influence are
 limited, which undermines its ability to achieve its objectives. Thus, a challenge for Beijing is to
 come up with a more effective means of reaching its goals.
 'rite View From Taipei
 Taiwan's view, as compared to that of China, is somewhat more optimistic. Taiwan believes that
 it has healthy security relations with the United States and that problems in US-China relations
 generally work to Taiwan's advantage (although Taipei also says that a sharp downturn in US-
 China relations is not good for Taiwan because that leads Beijing to harden its approach to
 Taiwan). Taiwan also perceives that its international standing, even in the absence of formal
 recognition, is relatively good.
 Taiwan has expressed interest in TMD, primarily because it provides political advantages and
 would huild a closer military and intelligence relationship with the United States
 Still, in Taipei's view, not all trends are favorable. Taiwan relies heavily on the United States but
 perceives that on important issues, the United States will side with China against Taiwan's
 interests. Taiwan also recognizes that Beijing has been able to restrict its international presence.
 Taipei knows that it is vulnerable to punitive PRC missile attacks and that the long-term military
 balance is unfavorable, with much of Beijing's military modernization aimed at preparing to deal
 with Taiwan crisis scenarios.
 Key Drivers
 We assess several key drivers will interact in various ways to produce different dynamics in
 cross-Strait relations over the next three years but primarily will interact to sustain or increase
 lension.fl
 Internal Politics
 No Chinese leader can afford to appear to be "soft" on the Taiwan question. In the early 1980s,
 Deng himself came under criticism for suggesting that Taiwan could be put on the back burner
 while China improved relations with the United States. In the era of no paramount leader,
 Chinese officials must he even more cautious about any statement that would lead to criticism
 and open the door to attacks from political opponents.
 nature 01 '1110 Taiwan issue, there is little divergence of opinion on the need for progress toward
 reunification. (C)
 On Taiwan, where leaders are democratically elected, there is little support for reunification with
 the PRC. Rather, polls show strong support for maintaining Taiwan's current status in the face of
 Chinese pressure. Consequently, any leader who pushed hard for reunification probably would
 be defeated in an election. Nevertheless, no leader wants to aggravate Beijing to the point that
 China decides to strike with military force. In sum, this key driver is likely to pull China and
 Taiwan in opposite directions.
 Desire for Legitimacy and Respect
 Beijing sees itself as an emerging great. power in and a legitimate member of the international
 system. It is developing its economy, political influence, and military capabilities. A permanent
 member of the UN Security Council, China deems it deserves status, respect, and, in the case of
 "Taiwan, deference. Perceived attempts by Taiwan to separate itself from China are seen as
 causing a "loss of face" for China, a threat to China's sovereignty, and a possible precedent for
 oilier regions of China. China's leaders will respond accordingly. For example, China insists that
 Taiwan not cuter the World Trade Organization before China does.
 Meanwhile, Taiwan has achieved democracy and economic prominence and believes it is equally
 entitled to legitimacy in the international community. Taiwan declares that it must be treated as
 an equal by China and that it will never consider reunification until China democratizes. Leaders
 in "Taipei cal I attention to Beijing's lack of respect for human rights while pointing to themselves
 as responsible members of world society.
 China-Taiwan: Decisionnuakh  for Cross-Strait Isues
 Legacy
 Top leaders of both China and Taiwan see "progress" in their respective views of the Taiwan
 question as enhancing their personal reputations. Both incumbent presidents have offered
 proposals for dealing with the situation across the Strait. Jiang presented an eight point proposal
 in 1995 and Lee responded with a six-point proposal shortly thereafter.
 Jiang probably calculates that his legitimacy and stature will be best served by making progress
 toward the goal of reunification while trying to avoid major conflict. Lee, however, sees his
 legacy as requiring an enhancement of Taiwan's status. Both want to avoid war, but beyond that
 their goals are mutually incompatible. Although Lee will step down as Taiwan's president, he
 will remain head of the ruling KMT. KMT candidates probably will be reluctant to directly
 challenge Lee's personal legacy; furthermore, any Taiwan leader may have difficulty taking back
 some of Lec's declarations and positions as China has demanded.fl
 Respective Military Priorities
 Beijing has been building its military capabilities for scenarios of conflict on Taiwan. The
 Intelligence Community has assessed that Beijing has begun a long-range program to develop
 forces that, in a Taiwan crisis, would be able to deter or delay US military forces if US
 intervention seems likely or inflict losses if US intervention actually occurs.rl In the interim,
 Beijing will use its military" capabilities to intimidate Taiwan, which will maintain a state of
 tension across the Strait.
 Taiwan, nneanwhile,~                has been building its forces to complicate Beijing's
 planning. Taiwan also will conduct modest training timed for political impact that probably will
 contribute to tension.
 Perceptions and Expectations of the United States
 US policies are significant to the attitudes of both sides. The perceptions and expectations of the
 United States by both China and Taiwan are likely to continue to contribute to tension across the
 Strait. Both expend great efforts to influence opinion in the United States and are seeking
 advantage in the conning US election. China, on one hand, sees Washington as supporting
 Taiwan's indefinite separation, including through the supply of arms; on the other hand, China
 believes it can alternatively threaten and cajole the United States on the Taiwan issue. Taiwan
 knows that it has strong support in the US Congress and media and that it has been effective in
 exerting influence Oil the United States to provide political and military support. Both sides will
 try to get at each other through the United States. For example, Lee Teng-hui issued his "state-to-
 state" comments in part because he believed that the low state of US-China relations following
 the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade offered an opportunity=
 Both sides will increase efforts to test the current or a new administration in Washington.
 Taiwan, for example, could press for US legislation similar to the Taiwan Security Enhancement
 Act to strengthen its position vis-a-vis Beijing. Beijing could demand additional concessions by
 the United States on arms sates.)
 Regional Factors
 Many PRC officials believe Japan secretly plans to expand its influence on Taiwan, and Beijing
 will be wary of Japan's approach to the island. Beijing sees Japan's cooperation with Washington
 in the defense guidelines as an element of Tokyo's designs. China repeatedly warns that such
 US-Japan cooperation will produce instability in the region. The degree to which US-Japan
 discussions and military exercises imply a Taiwan scenario will cause China to respond by harsh
 rhetoric and perhaps military exercises of its own.
 Moreover, the situation on the Korean Peninsula will affect cross-Strait relations. North Korea's
 policies are likely to continue to cause the United States and Japan to worry about instability in
 the region and heighten defense cooperation, including over a regional TMD. This situation will
 heighten China's anxieties about the implications for Taiwan.
 China hopes to use Hong Kong as a model of success in its one country, two systems" formula.
 "Taipei will point to problems in Hong Kong as reasons why it should not accept Beijing's
 enticements.
 The Potential for Conflict

 The most likely outcome in cross-Strait relations over the next three years is a dynamic and tense
 environment. Tension is likely to remain high or rise, and rising tension increases the chances of
 military incidents. Also, Beijing could posture for large-scale military operations in an attempt to
 Intimidate Talwan1
 We judge that, over the period of this Estimate, chances are better than even that China will
 conduct a major military exercise near Taiwan as Beijing did in March 1996. Also, chances are
 better than even that there will be small-scale incidents between the military forces of China and
 Taiwan. We judge chances are very low, however, that Beijing will actually follow through with
 large-scale combat operations, such as invading Taiwan or a heavily defended offshore island,
 conducting missile attacks against targets on Taiwan, or blockading the island with air or naval
 forces.
 China has the capability to conduct large scale combat operations, but we think the
 chances are very low because Beijing knows such operations would not necessarily be
 successful in achieving its objectives. Such operations probably would be
 counterproductive because they would be costly in casualties, could destroy Beijing's
 regional economic interests, and could invite third-party intervention.
 Certain circumstances will cause the key drivers to increase tensions leading to incidents of
 armed clashes short ofwar.F-I
 Shifts in Internal Politics. TO counter domestic instability in China, especially if caused by
 economic deterioration, Beijing could provoke a wave of nationalism leading to an even harder
 line toward Taiwan. Or, in the case of Taiwan, friction among rival political parties could cause a
 leader to calculate that he can gain popular support by emphasizing Taiwan's separate status.0
 Escalating the Desire for Legitimacy and Respect. Following the reversion of Macao, China
 could decide to press more vigorously on Taiwan by tightening the diplomatic noose. China
 could warn small countries that have relations with Taiwan that they will suffer consequences in
 the future, such as loss of trade or political retribution in the UN. Or, Taiwan could issue new
 statements that infuriate China.F-I
 Misconstruing US Intentions. China could misconstrue US statements criticizing Taiwan's
 policies as a lack of will to defend Taiwan from attack. Conversely, Taiwan could misconstrue
 pro--'Taiwan/anti-Beijing statements of US officials or legislators as tacit support for moves
 toward de jure independence.E1
 Regional Problems. Several situations would exacerbate tensions across the Strait, including
 deterioration on the Korean Peninsula that raises prospects for US intervention in contravention
 of China s interests or a decision by Japan to upgrade ties to Taiwan.
 `Red Lines r
 ( iron has e stablixlied certain "red lines, " that if Taiwan crosses, will cause a significant change
 in policy from peaceful reunification to use of force. These red lines are general in nature and
 Beijing's use olforce is likely to vary depending upon the situation. Among the "red lines" cited
 by Beijing include:
 A Taiwan formal declaration of independence, or Taiwan's holding a referendum or
 moth/ring its Constitution to establish independence.
 l'orei,~n support for proindependence forces in Taiwan.
 Taiwan's development of nuclear weapons together with a delivery system capable of
 threatening the mainland.
 a Widespread social instability or unrest on the island.
 We believe that at some point Chinese leaders would perceive Taiwan participation in a US-
 Spoii.sored TMD program as "foreign intervention in China's internal affairs. " This could
 become a "red line" issue that would elicit a military reaction, but we do not know what level of
 US participation in a Taiwan TMD program would bring about such a PRC response.
 Beijing's Options
 In tense cross-Strait relations, Beijing has several options (see China: Options Against Taiwan
 fora full range of options), many of which would be worrisome for the United States:
 Exercise Restraint. Military measures range from returning to normal military
 deployments along the Strait to conducting small-scale Taiwan-focused exercises on the
 Strait. Diplomatic activity would range from toning down rhetoric against Taiwan's
 leaders and maintaining longstanding efforts to limit Taiwan's international activity.
 Economic measure:; would include encouraging Taiwan to negotiate the "three-links."
 ? Rattle its Saber. Military measures would range from large-scale force deployments
 opposite Taiwan to deploying an out-of-area ground, airborne force to Fujian province
 (adjacent to Taiwan). Diplomatic measures would range from canceling talks between
 cross-Strait negotiators to public hints at the need for a reunification timetable. Economic
 measures range from warning other countries of economic consequences of continued
 engagement with Taiwan to closing the Strait to shipping with lengthy military exercises.
 s Punish Taiwan. Military measures range from bombarding a Taiwan-occupied island to
 seizing such an island. Diplomatic measures would include demanding an immediate
 cessation of US arms sales to Taiwan. Economic measures would range from spreading
 rumors in the Taiwan business community that military action is impending to
 blockading a key Taiwan port.
 China could attempt to blockade or invade Taiwan, which Beijing recognizes would risk war
 with the United States. In our judgment, such a war is highly unlikely during the period of this
 Estimate because of the reasons stated above.l
 Factors That Could Ease Tensions
 Although less likely in our view, several drivers could interact to bring about an amelioration of
 tensions across the Strait.fl
 Economic Interaction
 Economic interaction between China and Taiwan has been impressive (see chart). According to
 Chinese statistics, total trade has grown to $20 billion annually. More than 40,000 Taiwan
 businessmen have invested in the mainland, amounting to about 20 percent of outside
 investment. Taiwan data indicate that the PRC is Taiwan's third-largest trading partner and 42
 percent of Taiwan's overseas investment is in China. fl
 China sees the investment not only as important for developing its economy but also for
 facilitating integration between the two entities and building a constituency for reunification on
 the island. Taiwan's view is more mixed. Taiwan officials stated that, if the PRC share of total
 Taiwan overseas investment rises above 60 percent, the PRC would use this dependence to
 squeeze Taiwan at the negotiating table. At the same time, many Taiwan officials see the island's
 prosperity resting heavily on closer economic interchange with the mainland.
 Although we recognize the possibility of economic friction, on balance we judge economic
 factors will be a force for moderation. Taiwan will continue to place restrictions on cross-Strait
 economic flows, but Taiwan businesses probably will continue to channel money indirectly to
 the mainland through offshore banks. Meanwhile, China will try to promote greater trade and
 investment from Taiwan.
 Shifts in Other Key Drivers
 We assess changes could occur in other key drivers that would move China and Taiwan toward
 greater accommodation:
 Following Taiwan's presidential election in March 2000, domestic politics on both sides
 could shift. A new 'Taiwan leader could soften Taiwan's approach by agreeing to
 negotiate the three Iinks. Beijing could calculate that a softer line toward Taiwan was in
 its interests. Leaders on both sides could conclude that resuming ARATS-SEF contacts
 would improve communications, confidence, and predictability between China and
 Taiwan. Although we think it unlikely, leaders could hold secret talks, or, even less
 likely, agree to a summit meeting to try to ease tensions.
 ? The two sides could conclude that economic interests warrant a reduction of military
 tensions.
 Greater stability in t1S-China relations could improve cross-Strait ties as well. Beijing's
 fear that Washington was secretly fostering an independent Taiwan probably would ease.
 Bottom Line
 On balance, we assess that the key drivers are more likely to combine to sustain and exacerbate a
 tense atmosphere across the Strait. Important constraints--notably US and international support
 for regional stability--will act against a major conflict, but provocative tactics and greater use of
 military signaling will heighten the prospects for accidental or intentional armed clashes.
 Timelines
 We doubt that the PRC has set a deadline for achieving reunification. Nor has it devised a
 timetable with specific accomplishments along the way. Nevertheless, a variety of reporting
 indicates that Beijing has become more anxious about achieving concrete progress toward
 reuni ica11o11.
 We assess that Beijing's sense of urgency will be influenced by China's broader strategic
 perception of how well it is faring in other key objectives. Economic growth, greater stability in
 US-China relations, international reputation, and political stability are of importance to China's
 leaders, and progress on Taiwan will be viewed in this context. Chinese gains in these other areas
 may cause Beijing to decide that it has more time to deal with the Taiwan issue.
 Taiwan has no timeline, but intends to preserve its options. Nevertheless, the Presidential
 election next year could produce a departure from Taiwan's present approach. Although Lee's
 preferred successor, Vice President Lien Chan, is unlikely to deviate significantly from Taiwan's
 present course, other potential successors, notably former Taiwan governor James Soong, have
 raised other options. Soong, for example, reportedly has discussed the possibility of moving
 more directly to negotiate with China on the three Iinks.fl
 Outlook Beyond Three Years
 The dloanlie situation across the Strait over the next three years, including presidential change
 in Taiwan, China, and the United States, precludes effective estimating about likely outcomes
 beyond ibis time fi-anae. Nevertheless, the Intelligence Community agrees that some of the trends
 discussed in this Estimate are likely to persist well beyond the three years covered by his
 Estirnate.F-1
 Srrch.factors as nationalism, demographics, face, and the personalities of leaders will continue to
 influence developments across the Strait, as will the perceptions of both sides that they are
 entitled to international recognition and support.7
 We agree that economic links will continue well beyond three years. We note that even during
 past periods of crisis these links have not diminished. We are uncertain that such links would
 lead to political integration in greater China. F1
 We think China's power in the region will grow, but the power of others in the region, including
 Taiwan, probably also will grow.
 Although ire believe unification between China and Taiwan is not likely over the next ten years,
 we think the possibility of progress on China's request for three links is good and perhaps some
 progress on CBMs, including military CBMs across the Strait, as well. All of these can be
 achieved, however, without concrete progress toward political unity. The main issue, in our
 view, will be whether Chinese nationalism or Taiwan assertiveness and manipulation leads to
 confrontation, or whether enl,i 'htened statesmanship on both sides decides to capitalize on the
 benefits of peace and stability.
 What if We Are Wrong?
 Our overall view is based on two assumptions: no fundamental political upheaval in China or
 Taiwan and no change in US global superpower status or alliance structure in the region. Major
 political upheaval in China is the more probable of the assumptions to come under challenge.
 Although highly unlikely, China's twentieth century history suggests significant political change
 cannot he ruled out. Over the next three years, serious economic problems, combined with a
 leadership succession crisis in Beijing, could lead to a popular uprising or a change in regime. A
 new, more nationalistic regime could define Taiwan's liberation as the cornerstone of its
 legitimacy. Such a regime almost certainly would increase the pressure to resolve the Taiwan
 situation. Alternatively, a more democratic government in China could adopt a more
 accommodating approach to Taiwan.
 Political radicalism in Taiwan leading to a formal declaration of independence or, less likely, a
 decision to reunify with China also are plausible. In either event, the US reaction would be
 critical. Such countries as South Korea and Japan would~m sure the US response in assessing
 the strength of their alliances with the United States.
 Disruption of the US alliance structure could occur if the Korean peninsula was suddenly
 reunified. A reunified Korea would involve complex interaction between the United States and
 China, as well as Japan, that would influence developments with respect to Taiwan. Similarly,
 situations that undermined the US-Japan security relationship could affect Taiwan's security. For
 example, Japan, concluding the United States is withdrawing militarily from Asia, could decide
 to create an independent nuclear arsenal. Such a decision almost certainly would bring about an
 unfavorable Chinese reaction, perhaps including increased military pressure on Taiwan. Though
 highly unlikely, such developments almost certainly would cause both China and Taiwan to
 reevaluate their tics to the United States.
