 CURRENT INT   IGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 February 1959
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 THE GERMAN QUESTION
 In his speech at Tula on
 17 February, Khrushchev adopted
 a defiant attitude toward the
 Western powers' determination,
 reaffirmed in their notes of
 16 February,  to uphold by all
 appropriate means their communi-
 cations with Berlin.   This con-
 tinues the Soviet efforts to
 confront the Western powers with
 an apparent choice between meas-
 ures to enforce their right of
 access to Berlin--which might
 involve a risk of war--or con-
 cessions to Soviet demand.
 Khrushchev said Soviet
 troops in East Germany are not
 there to play games and re-
 peated previous public Soviet
 warnings that "if anybody should
 start shooting,  this would mean
 the beginning of war."
 The Soviet premier in his
 Tula speech also sought to dis-
 courage any belief that Western
 access to Berlin could be main-
 tained by an airlift if the land
 routes are closed.   He asserted
 that East Germany would obtain
 full sovereignty by the conclu-
 sion of a peace treaty--either
 with both German states or a
 separate treaty with East Ger-
 many--and would vigorously re-
 buff any encroachment on its
 territory by land, air, or
 water.
 Khrushchev's stress on
 East German sovereign rights
 guaranteed by inter;:iat ional law
 after a peace treaty is signed
 seems to imply either that the
 East Germans would refrain from
 attempting to exercise controls
 over Allied access which had
 been relinquished by the USSR
 until after a peace treaty is
 signed or that Moscow plans to
 conclude a separate peace treaty
 prior to or simultaneously   .
 with transfer of controls to the
 East Germans.
 Khrushchev's tough line on
 negotiations with the West sug-
 gests that the USSR will promptly
 carry out its announced inten-
 tion                                                                     to transfer controls and
 sign a separate treaty if the
 West rejects the Soviet pro-
 posals on Berlin and a treaty
 signed by both German govern-
 ments.  There may be a transition
 period following a transfer of
 controls during which East German
 authority would be exercise:! in
 such a way as to avoid a force-
 ful Western reaction and to gain
 more time to maneuver the West
 toward de facto recognition of
 the East German regime.   Khru-
 shchev ridiculed the Western
 formula of "no concessions with-
 out counterconcessions" and
 said, "We...have nothing to
 concede.   We made our proposals
 without bargaining."
 Moscow's apparent belief
 that its threatening posture on
 Berlin will generate growing
 popular pressures on Western
 governments to move toward at
 least de facto recognition of
 East Germany was reflected in
 Khrushchev's favorable reference

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 February 1959
 in his Tula speech to Senator
 Mansfield's proposal for direct
 negotiations between the two
 German governments on unifica-
 tion of both Berlin and Germany.
 He said such proposals "merit
 attention" and declared "it
 would be possible to reach
 agreement with people who take
 such sober positions."
 East German Views
 Anticipating the Western
 notes of 16 February, a Neues
 Deutschland editorial on"l
 e ruary'insisted that both
 German states must not only
 sign a peace treaty but also
 participate in the negotiations.
 "We don't want a finished prod-
 uct," said the editorial,-,"in
 ultimative form, as was the
 case  with  the  Versailles
 Treaty, presented for our sig-
 nature."  Nor does East Ger-
 many want to participate merely
 as "archivists and consultants,"
 but as a "delegation of a sov-
 ereign German state represent-
 ing the cause of the nation."
 In a further effort to
 enhance its claim to interna-
 tional recognition, the East
 German regime, following the
 turnover of access, controls,may
 seek on the technical level a
 civil air agreement with West
 Germany.   Ambassador Bruce be-
 lieves this is especially likely
 if the Western carriers present-
 ly operating to Berlin cease to
 fly because of Soviet refusal
 to guarantee flight safety. Such
 a development would result in
 pressures on the Western gov-
 ernments to seek an accommoda-
 tion with East Germany permit-
 ting their airlines to continue
 Service.   The East German re-
 gime would probably feel that
 any financial loss it might
 suffer thereby would be more
 than compensated for by a gain
 in its international stature.
 Macmillan Visit
 The Soviet leaders appar-
 ently believe that British views
 on Berlin and Germany and the
 likelihood of British elections
 this year can be exploited to
 weaken Western unity.
 the USSR considers Britain
 ~h"elweakest link" in the West-
 ern front and may attempt to
 drive a "hard bargain" during
 Macmillan's visit.
 Moscow probably feels that
 the prime minister's desire for
 a "peacemaker" role, together
 with the pressure of British
 public opinion for a relaxation  25X1
 of tension, makes him particu-   25X1
 larly vulnerable on the German

 "very evasive" reply to a ques-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 February 1959
 a counterproposal to Moscow of-
 fering to establish a United
 Nations commission to supervise
 the exercise of human rights
 and freedom of political ac-
 tivity in both East and West
 Germany.   They feel such a com-
 mission, if active for a "num-
 ber of years,"  could pave the
 way for a German federation.
 Bonn would also consider legal-
 izing the Communist party, out-
 lawed since 1956.   German of-
 ficials claim that the plan has
 "official" but not "governmen,
 tall' approval.
 Bonn Foreign Ministry of-
 ficials have also indicated that
 a German federation, with wide
 powers given to the individual
 states in the economic and so
 cial lields, would be worth
 "examining."  Such "informal"
 ideas are apparently a part of
 a continuing effort by some
 German diplomats to probe West-
 ern reactions to new approaches
 to unification.
 Bonn has strongly supp-crted
 the participation of both East
 and West German representatives
 in the proposed foreign minis-
 ters' conference despite criti-
 cism in NATO that the West may
 be confronted with a high-rank-
 ing East German delegation.
 Bonn intends to claim the
 right to address the meeting,
 although sitting in the "second
 row."    Adenauer may feel that
 in view of constant reports of
 new Western approaches to the
 German question, such as Sena-
 tor Mansfield's proposals, Bonn
 can no longer afford to be ex-
 cluded from any high-level dis-
 cussions.   By participating as
 a member of the Western team,
 Bonn hopes to establish a claim
 to equality with the United
 States,   Britain,   and  France
 in  any   talks  on  Germany,
 European security, or disarma-
 ment.
 Moscow acted quickly to
 gain the propaganda initiative
 following  the  breakdown  of
 talks in Tehran on 10 February
 by releasing on the next day
 the text of the 14-page memo-
 randum the Soviet negotiators
 handed to the Iranian foreign
 minister before their departure.
 The memorandum's step-by-step
 account of the talks apparently
 was designed to prepare the
 ground for retaliatory pressure
 on Iran.  This pressure prob-
 ably will be intensified dur-
 ing the final stage in Iran's
 negotiations on a bilateral de-
 fense agreement with the United
 States, which may be signed be-
 fore 21 March.
 In his speech on 17 Feb-
 ruary Khrushchev made a more
 explicit attack on the Shah
 than in his statements last No-
 vember; while he asserted that
 the Shah could not "save his
 throne" by a pact with the
 United States, his statement
 that "We shall see to it that
 the people of Iran understand
 our attitude correctly"   ap-
 parently presages intensified
 attacks on the Shah's regime.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 February 1959
 The Soviet premier also repeats
 charges that the Shah:'.s decision
 to conclude a bilateral defense
 agreement with the United States
 will "entail the turning of Iran
 into an American military base."
 A Pravda article on 14 Feb-
 ruary contended that the Soviet
 Union did "everything possible"
 to meet Iran's wishes,,-and charged
 Tehran with following a "double-
 dealing, perfidious" policy de-
 s'igned to deceive the Iranian
 public.   Soviet warnings have
 stressed that a "turning point"
 has been reached in USSR-Iranian
 relations, and that the Soviet
 Union "cannot overlook such
 hostile action" by Iran as the
 signing; of a bilateral defense
 pact with the United States.
 Articles on 17 February in
 the Soviet military newspapers
 Red Star and Soviet Fleet`,at-
 t Ic'T a US-Iran an bilateral
 defense agreement, charging
 that Iran's armed forces atre
 losing their independence` and
 that American bases are being
 set up in Iran "for attacking
 the Soviet Union."  The Soviet
 press and radio,, as well as Mos-
 cow's 10 February memorandum,
 charge that the Shah's regime
 does not represent the Iranian
 people, and Soviet media at-
 tempt to portray important seg-
 ments in the country as opposed
 to the Tehran government.
 Moscow claims that "several
 prominent Iranian generals" have
 spoken in favor of removing all
 foreign advisers and have de-
 clared that if American troops
 enter Iran, the Iranian Army
 "will disband as a mark of pro-
 test."  Pravda warns that Tehran's
 policies will bring the rulers
 of Iran to an inevitable d.own-
 fall--either through flig)at, as
 in the "Cuban fashion," or through
 destruction, as in the "Baghdad
 style."
 The Soviet leaders see such
 propaganda, if not effective in
 dissuading Iran from signing a
 bilateral agreement, as prepar-
 ing a public rationale for So-
 Viet counteraction when the bi-
 lateral  agreement is  signed.
 As yet, however, Moscow has
 dertaken no move other than pr:.;v-
 aganda against the'Tehran regime.
 The Iranian Government,
 placing full responsibility for
 collapse of the negotiations on
 the'USSR, is trying to counter
 Soviet charges through a vigor-
 ous diplomatic and propaganda
 effort.   At a session of the
 Iranian Senate on 14 February,
 Foreign Minister Hekmat expressed
 the government's determination
 not to be intimidated.   He
 also  has  threatened  to
 suppress  TASS bulletins is-
 sued in Iran.   Radio Tehran
 has warned that Iran will pub-
 lish                                                      a "bulky  catalog" of
 Soviet, misdeeds if Moscow does
 not cease its broadcast attacks.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 February 1959
 irritation with Qasim over the
 cancellation of an order to
 suspend a Communist paper was
 the source from which the res-
 ignation actions might have
 sprung, departed from Baghdad
 for New Delhi, ostensibly to
 put in order affairs he had
 left there when he was Iraqi
 ambassador to India.
 There are rumors that Kha-
 lid Bakdash, the Syrian Commu-
 nist leader who spoke for the
 Arab Communists at the 21st par-
 ty congress in Moscow last month,
 has returned to Baghdad, a move
 which would strengthen the local
 Communist-movement and would
 alarm the UAR authorities, who
 are continuing to harass local
 Communists in Egypt and Syria.
 Nasir probably is still
 concerned over the situation in
 Syria.    He is scheduled to visit
 Damascus about 22 February, ac-
 companied by Yugoslav President
 Tito, immediately after an "im-
 portant" political speech in
 Cairo.
 There remain pockets of
 political resistance in Syria
 to the UAR concept and to Egyp-
 tian domination of it.   There
 are a number of Syrian Army of-
 f icers who, retired, transf erred,
 or  in  effect  demoted by,
 Cairo's orders, form a poten-
 tial core of dissidence.   For-
 mer chief of staff Bizri, whose
 whereabouts is unknown but who
 may be in Iraq, has been at-
 tempting to exploit these ele-
 ments.   Landowners are still re-
 sisting the agrarian reform law;
 a slowdown in agriculture is af-
 fecting a large part of the econ?-
 omy.                                                      The scheme for a "nation-
 al union" to replace the old
 political parties has bogged
 down in the face of unanimous
 opposition from the party organ-
 izations which, although legally
 abolished, continue to subsist.
 Although none of these dis-
 parate elements yet show signs
 of linking up, their disgrun-
 tlement'is a standing threat to
 Nasir's prestige.   Adding to UAR
 concerns is a possible renewal of
 activity by a Communist party
 with funds and personnel from Iraq.
 UAR propaganda organs, pos-
 sibly seeking to distract atten-
 tion from the UAR's failure in
 Iraq and the grumbling in Syria,
 are now concentrating on the in-
 creased flow of Israeli immi-
 grants coming from Eastern Eu-
 rope, especially Rumania.   One
 press line is that the movement
 of these people is the result
 of an arrangement made by Soviet
 Deputy Premier Mikoyan with the
 United States, and that it fore-
 shadows another effort by the
 great powers to divide the Mid-
 dle East into spheres of influ-

 involving activities of Wheelus

 of former Premier Ben Halim in
 "enslaving" the country by sign-

 Although the government

 issue of neutralism generally
 and the air base specifically.
 Even Libyan provincial officials
 now are pressing their own claims
 to consideration in the negotia-

 these forces tend to create an
 atmosphere favorable for more

 The possibility of a final

 only  a  few   far-right  con-

 denouncing the government for
 following "a.policy of surrend-

 In Greece, the government
 was aided by the initially fa-

 leading Greek Cypriots.   Spokes-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 February 1959
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 The split between Cambodian
 Premier Sihanouk and General Dap
 Chhuon, military commander in
 northwestern Cambodia, has come
 increasingly  into  the  open.
 Sihanouk, who recently returned
 from a week's visit in Indonesia,
 apparently now is  aware  that
 Chhuon has been plotting a move
 against him.  He is probably un-
 certain of the extent of Chhuon's
 support among the 28,000-man
 Cambodian military establishment
 --beyond the three battalions
 Chhuon controls in Siem Reap
 and Kompong Thom provinces and
 elements in the palace guard--
 and seems anxious to avoid a
 direct showdown at present.
 Defenses in the Phnom Penh
 area have been strengthened,
 while Sihanouk is attempting to
 undercut,Chhuon's position by
 such devices as recalling army
 equipment from his military
 region, ostensibly for routine
 exchange.   A key question is
 the attitude of General Lon
 Nol, opportunistic chief of
 staff of the Cambodian armed
 forces and concurrently defense
 minister in Sihanouk's reshuffled
 cabinet.  The cabinet changes
 announced on 18 February  ap-
 parently are part of Sihanouk's
 spreading witch hunt  against
 officials suspected either of
 collusion with antigovernment
 elements or of being too inept
 to cope with the "present deli-
 cate situation."
 The premier may be planning
 a full-blown expose of the Dap
 Chhuon plot, implicating the
 United States as well.   In an
 interview in Indonesia on 14
 February, Sihanouk specifically
 accused Vietnam's representative,
 Ngo Trong Hieu, of being "the
 head of foreign subversion in
 Cambodia."  He also said, "It
 is not the Communists who are
 attacking us but SEATO dollars
 and weapons."  Sihanouk extolled
 Peiping's friendship toward Cam-
 bodia and labeled fears of Chi-
 nese Communist subversion "sheer
 nonsense."  He claimed there
 was not a.single Chinese agent
 in Cambodia.
 Peiping, satisfied  with
 its growing prestige in   Cam-
 bodia since Phnom Penh's recog-
 nition last summer, now looks
 forward to increasing its in-
 fluence.  Peiping is continuing
 its efforts to convince Sihanouk
 that closer ties with Communist
 China will improve the stability
 of his regime but will not ex-
 pose him to Chinese domination.
 Such an emphasis would also
 serve to promote Peiping's ef-
 fort to "prove" to Other coun-
 tries of Southeast Asia that
 neutrality is profitable and
 entails no risks.
 TUNISIA'S RELATIONS WITH FRANCE
 Tunisia's relations with
 France are again deteriorating
 sharply as the attitude of the
 government hardens.   Indignant
 because the De Gaulle govern-
 ment failed to make some con-
 cession to alleviate Tunisia's
 financial difficulties--caused
 in part by the devaluation of
 the French  franc. in December--
 the Tunisian Government now
 seems to be tacitly encourag-
 ing anti-French feeling stim-
 ulated by two recent border
 violations and the discovery
 of a French espionage network.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 February 1959
 This feeling probably will
 mount, and carefully controlled
 anti-French demonstrations may
 be permitted.
 Although border incidents,
 including fatalities, are not
 uncommon, they usually are soft-
 pedaled by the Tunisian Govern-
 ment.   The controlled press,
 however, has extensively re-
 ported the shelling by French
 Army units in Algeria of a Tu-
 nisian village west of Kasse-
 rine on 8 February--pointing
 out that it occurred just one
 year after the French air
 strike against Sakiet Sidi
 Youssef--and the strafing on
 14 February by Algeria-based
 French fighter planes of a Tu-
 nisian locust control team
 farther south, near Nefta.
 Many Tunisians will con-
 sider the second border inci-
 dent a harsh response to Presi-
 dent Bourguiba's unusually con-
 ciliatory statements toward
 France in his weekly radio
 talk shortly before.   The talk
 concerned the discovery of an
 extensive French espionage net-
 work operating  out  of  the
 French Embassy in Tunis. At
 about the same time Bourguiba
 offered during an interview to
 meet De Gaulle to discuss mu-
 tual problems, including an
 Algerian settlement.
 The incident provided
 Bourguiba with a new opportu-
 nity to pose as champion of Al-
 gerian independence.   He told
 press correspondents on 17 Feb-
 ruary that unless peace were
 realized in Algeria by 17 June--
 the first anniversary of the
 agreement to withdraw all
 French military forces from
 Tunisia except those at Bizerte
 and to provide for the negotia-
 tion of a provisional agreement
 regarding the base--Tunisia may
 not permit France to retain the
 'base at Bizerte.
 Paris is taking a tough
 line because Tunisia has re-
 fused   to permit the French
 consul in Tunis to see two Al-
 gerian employees of the embassy
 held on espionage charges.
 Bourguiba's recent claims to a
 part of a French petroleum con-
 cession area in the Sahara and
 his announced intention to buy
 all foreign-owned farm lands
 have also irritated the French
 Government, which now is not
 prepared to meet any of Bour-
 guiba's demands.
 Nevertheless, Bourguiba
 probably will insist that the
 staff of the French Embassy in
 Tunis, which numbers 650 per-
 sons, be reduced and may also
 demand that some of the 20,000
 French Army, Navy and Air per-
 sonnel at Bizerte be withdrawn.
 The Tunisians probably will
 simultaneously seek new arms,

 19 February 1959
 The Soviet delegation to the
 Geneva conference on the sus-
 pension of nuclear tests has en-
 deavored this week to improve
 its negotiating record in the
 event the talks break down.   On
 17 February the Soviet delegation
 accused the West of not wanting
 an agreement and warned that
 negotiations may collapse if the
 United States and Great Britain
 do not change their positions.
 The chief Soviet delegate claimed
 that  Anglo-American  rejec-
 tion of a Soviet proposal for
 staffing of control posts proves
 that the United States and 'Brit-
 ain  are interested only in
 sending the maximum number of
 "foreign agents" into the USSR
 for espionage purposes, not in
 ending nuclear weapons tests.
 On 18 February the Soviet
 delegate underlined this warn-
 ing, charging that US and Brit-
 ish  tactics of insisting that
 discussion be limited to topics
 they specify has created an
 "almost hopeless situation."
 He said this means the West
 wants to maintain the conference
 "in a state of impasse,."   There
 have been no indications,   how-
 ever,  that the USSR will take
 the initiative in ending the
 negotiations.
 The Soviet delegation's
 publication on 7 February of
 its statement on the talks has
 been directed toward blurring
 key issues on which its posi-
 tion is comparatively weak,
 while at the same time main-
 taining the appearance of being
 willing to negotiate all issues.
 In an effort to show that the
 USSR holds the initiative in
 the talks,  the Soviet delegate
 last week ;pressed for detailed
 Western views on the four key
 issues of voting procedure in
 the control commission,  dura-
 tion of a treaty, staffing of
 control posts, and composition
 of the control commission.   On
 the last issue, Moscow formally
 proposed that the control com-
 mission be composed of three
 Western and three bloc members
 and one neutral.
 Discussion centered pri-
 marily on the issue of control-
 post staffing.   The Soviet dele-
 gates, claiming that the Anglo-
 American proposals for interna-
 tional staffing would not guar-
 antee against either suppression
 or fabrication of evidence, main-
 tained that the post should be
 staffed by nationals of the host
 country supplemented by "con-
 trollers" from the "other side."
 The Soviet team charged that the
 Western plan fails to ensure
 "mutual control" or guarantee
 to the host country that its
 national security would not be
 prejudiced by improper activities
 on the part of control personnel--
 activities which would "create
 tension and promote the cold
 war."
 On 11 February the Soviet
 delegate implied that any further
 negotiations on the key question
 of voting procedures in the con-
 trol commission must await pres-
 entation of the "Western atti-
 tude."   He intended thereby to
 create the impression that the
 Soviet delegation is ready and
 willing to discuss this issue,
 but is being frustrated by con-
 tinued Western refusal to intro-
 duce a specific counterproposal
 to the Soviet draft article
 listing subjects requiring unanim-
 ity among the three nuclear
 powers.
 During the forthcoming visit
 of Prime Minister Macmillan to
 Moscow,  the Soviet leaders will
 probably probe for possible

 Budget and Treasury Ministries,

 conservative former Budget
 Minister Pella.
 Instead, Pella was given
 the Foreign Ministry, where he
 may endeavor to improve rela-
 tions with Eastern Europe in
 order to promote greater bloc
 trade; he may also encourage
 expansion of Italian economic
 relations with the Near East.
 The new government, nevertheless,
 will probably continue Italy's
 pro-NATO policies.
 Such a compromise cabinet
 can be expected to accomplish
 little in the way of positive
 legislation.   It will not carry
 out the reform legislation
 called for in Fanfani's pro-

 and the Rome area appears lit-
 tle more than wishful thinking.
 POLITICAL SITUATION IN CEYLON
 Recent developments with-
 in Ceylon's Parliament and
 Prime Minister Bandaranaike's
 Sri Lanka Freedom party (SLFP)
 have defined the rivalry be-
 tween leftist and relatively
 moderate elements in the coun-
 try more sharply than at any
 time since Bandaranaike's coali-
 tion government took office in
 April 1956.   The strong stand
 which the SLFP's relatively
 moderate wing is taking for
 the first time against the par-
 ty's leftist elements could
 eventually create a rift in
 the SLFP and the ruling coali-
 tion impossible for Bandaranaike
 to bridge.   Such a development
 would isolate and further weak-
 en Bandaranaike and would pro-
 vide the basis for new party
 realignments.
 At the SLFP's recent ex-
 ecutive committee meeting, the
 party's moderate elements over-
 ruled the prime minister and
 unanimously elected a strong
 anti-Communist as party general
 secretary to succeed the left-
 ist incumbent..   They also em-
 phatically rejected a proposal
 that the government coalition
 ally itself with the Communist
 and Trotskyite Lanka Sama Samaj
 (LSSP) parties to defeat the
 United National party (UNP),
 formerly the ruling party, in
 the Colombo municipal elections
 tentatively scheduled for next
 November.   This conflict has
 also been reflected in the cab-
 inet, with the renewal of
 strong opposition by SLFP cab-
 inet members to the far-leftist.
 minister of agriculture.
 The campaign of the rela-
 tively conservative UNP since
 September to revive its organ-
 ization and regain its former
 popularity apparently has met
 with some success, and this
 could hasten a polarization of
 the island's political groups.
 Both the LSSP and the Communist
 party have admitted that the
 UNP would benefit most from
 elections at this time.   If the
 UNP's fortunes continue to
 rise, the party could provide
 the rallying point for moderate
 government members who judge
 their political positions jeop-
 ardized by the weakness and
 factionalism in the Bandar-
 anaike government.

 BURMA
 The Burmese Parliament
 seems about to amend the Con-
 stitution to permit General Ne
 Win to stay on indefinitely as
 prime minister.  As now writ-
 ten, the Constitution forbids
 nonmembers of Parliament, like
 Ne Win, to stay in'office for
 more than six months at a time.
 Ne Win's six-month term was
 not due to expire until April.
 He tendered his resignation to
 Parliament on 13 February, how-
 ever, stating it would be im-
 possible to prepare the coun-
 try for elections by April as
 he had hoped and inviting Par-
 liament to devise alternative
 arrangements.
 He announced he could not
 be induced to return as prime
 minister unless the constitu-
 tional restrictions on the
 length of his tenure were lift-
 ed.                  Ne Win's statement con-
 veyed the unmistakable impres-
 sion that whatever Parliament's
 formal arrangements for a suc-
 cessor government, the army in-
 tended to retain a substantial
 voice in the national policy
 sphere.
 Former Prime Minister U
 Nu's "clean" faction of the
 Anti-Fascist People's Freedom
 League (AFPFL) had opposed un-
 til the last minute an exten-
 sion of Ne Win's term beyond
 the April deadline. During the
 week-end recess of Parliament,
 however, the faction reluctant-
 ly agreed to go along with Ne
 Win's request, probably thus
 eliminating opposition to the
 proposed amendment except from
 the predominantly Communist Na-
 tional United Front and perhaps
 a sprinkling of non-Communist
 mavericks.   Nu has declared
 that his party hereafter will

 to oppose army "oppression."

 However.bitter the pill

 19 February 1959
 Hanoi and Peiping have been
 strongly critical of the Laotian
 Government's renunciation on 11
 February of the restrictive 1954
 Geneva accords.   In response to
 these pressures, Vientiane on
 18 February attempted to clari-
 fy its action by explaining that
 its earlier statement had mere-
 ly recorded the facts:   Laotian
 commitments under the Geneva
 accords  had  been  completed.
 There was no intention, it in-
 sisted, of changing Laotian pol-
 icies but, similarly, there was
 no further basis for applying
 the accords to the country.
 It appears unlikely, how-
 ever, that this explanation will
 quiet foreign criticisms.   Com-
 munist sources assert that the
 accords are binding on the en-
 tire Indochina area until they
 all have been fulfilled and
 there has been a political set-
 tlement in Vietnam.
 Internally, Premier Phoui
 is faced simultaneously with
 growing discontent among. the
 conservative elements of his
 government. He fears that the
 faembers of the conservative
 Rally of the Lao People (RLP)
 will soon serve him with an
 ultimatum to supply the execu-
 tive and ambassadorial posts
 he  promised  in  return for

 the Alliance wins the election.
 The two largest components
 of the Alliance--UMNO and the
 Malayan Chinese Association--
 seem to be losing some popular
 support and are torn by intern-
 al friction and mutual suspi-
 cion.   Probably of most concern
 to Rahman are reports that the
 Malay voters are apathetic and
 that UMNO is losing ground to
 the Pan-Malayan Islamic Associa-
 tion among rural Malay Moslems,
 traditionally the backbone of
 UMNO strength.
 Rahman believes. strongly
 that a large majority is needed
 to achieve his goals of elimi-
 nating the Communist threat and
 building racial harmony.   A
 two-thirds majority is required
 in the new House of Representa-
 tives to amend the constitution
 and provide safeguards with
 which to replace the "emergency
 regulations."  The steady prog-
 ress: toward eliminating the
 Communist terrorist threat is
 likely to force the government
 to declare an early end to the
 emergency, possibly this year.
 Rahman believes such a declara-
 tion would leave the federation

 to control Communist subversive
 activities.

 JAPANESE - SOUTH KOREAN CRISIS
 The Japanese Government's
 formal decision to proceed with
 the voluntary repatriation of
 Koreans to North Korea, over
 Seoul's strong objections, has
 created a new crisis in Japa
 nese - South Korean relations.
 The decision apparently ends
 the negotiations for normaliz-
 ing relations, and the Rhee gov-
 ernment is threatening to Step
 up seizures of Japanese fishing
 boats, to suspend trade, and to
 intercept any repatriations ves-
 sels.   Japan has intimated it
 might be forced to strengthen
 its protective patrols in the
 fishing areas, which could lead
 to clashes between South Korean
 and Japanese vessels.   It might,
 if necessary, refer the matter
 to the United Nations.    Both

 sides appear to be trying to
 keep the dispute under control.
 The Japanese Government's
 decision to act unilaterally on
 the repatriation issue probably
 stems from South Korea's in-
 transigence in the negotiations
 and a desire by the Kishi gov-
 ernment to avert a major domes-
 tic political problem before
 the upper-house elections in
 June.  Other factors, such as
 the problem of internal securi-
 ty, the expense of maintaining
 many destitute Koreans, pressure
 on the labor market, and Japan's
 vulnerability to charges of
 violating human rights also
 entered into the decision.
 In a rare display of una-
 nimity for South Korea, both
 administration and opposition
 leaders have endorsed nation-
 wide demonstrations protesting
 Tokyo's decision.
 The new anti-Japanese cam-
 paign may revitalize President
 Rhee's waning popularity, and
 give him an opportunity to di-
 vert international attention
 from the political crisis pre-
 cipitated by the administra-
 tion's use of force on 24 De-
 cember to enact legislation
 inimical to the opposition Demo-
 cratic party.   It might even
 lead to a compromise of the
 domestic political crisis.
 Japan has requested the
 International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) to screen and
 transport the applicants, who
 may   number  up to 100,000. A
 rejection  of  the request  by
 the ICRC   would  force  the
 Japanese Government to allow
 the Japanese  Red  Cross  to
 deal directly  with  the North
 Korean  Red Cross, as already
 requested  by  Pyongyang.  The
 North Korean Government  has
 thus far  failed  to reiterate
 an offer made in September 1958
 to provide transportation and
 guarantee a livelihood for all
 returnees.
 ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF THE SOVIET 21ST PARTY CONGRESS
 The Soviet Seven-Year Plan
 was approved by the 21st party
 congress without significant
 change.   Long-term objectives
 remain the "further consolida-
 tion of the economic and defense
 might of the USSR on the basis
 of the priority development of
 heavy industry."  The consumer
 still takes a back seat to the
 investment program, but, accord-
 ing to Khrushchev, the next 10
 years will show that the USSR
 leads the world in improving
 the material welfare of its
 citizens.
 This will result, he said,
 from accomplishing the goal of
 surpassing American ~production
 in agriculture in 1965 and in
 industry by 1970.   In his cal-
 culations, however, Khrushchev
 overstates the present position
 of Soviet industrial output rell-
 ative to  US output, thus arriv-
 ing at the early date of 1970,
 and he may be underestimating
 future US growth rates,   Calcu-
 lating Soviet industrial output
 at present at 40 percent of that
 of the United States, not 50 per-
 cent as used by Khrushchev, and
 assuming a slightly higher rate
 of growth for future American
 industrial output, Soviet indus-
 trial output would be about 60
 percent of that of the US by 1970.
 The new nations of Africa
 were advised to look at the rate
 of economic growth in the United
 States, compare it with growth
 rates in the USSR and China,
 and then decide to adhere to one
 system or the other.   Khrushchev,

 gress, and the  whole  Soviet

 propaganda machine are sparing
 no effort to extol the bloc's
 faster rate of economic growth,
 confident this will persuade un-
 committed nations to "choose
 socialism."
 Khrushchev's ebullient but
 almost certainly fallacious
 prognosis that the Communist
 bloc will produce more than half
 of the world's industrial out-
 put by the end of seven years
 was amplified by the vice pres-
 ident  of the Academy  of
 Sciences, Ostrovityanov, who
 stated that this projected level
 of output would bring about a
 situation in which the bloc
 would occupy a leading position
 in international exchange and
 monetary turnover.
 Ostrovityanov said Commu-
 nist countries,  whici now trade
 among themselves on the basis
 of world market prices, will
 begin gradually to set their
 own prices based on production
 costs in the socialist camp.
 The Soviet ruble,  he felt, will
 begin to enter the arena of the
 international market and grad-
 ually  crowd out the dollar.
 To do this, however, the
 bloc must be able to provide
 quality goods in adequate quan-
 tities at competitive prices.
 There is no sign that.Soviet
 leaders plan soon to make the
 ruble a freely convertible cur-
 rency.  Khrushchev recently said
 that if such a plan were con-
 templated, he would probably
 advise against it.
 M.. G. Pervukhin, former
 planning expert and quondam
 member of the opposition to
 Khrushchev, was charged with
 espousing policies which the
 USSR had to subsequently re-
 verse--such as favoring hydro-
 electric over thermal power,
 favoring coal over petroleum,
 and permitting only slow growth
 in chemicals.  While there may
 be some truth in these charges,
 certainly the primary reason
 for Pervukhin's present dis-
 grace is his opposition  to
 Khrushchev's plan for the re-
 organization of industry.  His
 detractor at the congress, pres-
 ent, planning chief Kuzmin,
 charged that Pervukhin had de-
 rogatorially referred to an al-
 leged "organization itch" of
 Khrushchev.
 Khrushchev repeated at the
 congress his statement   that
 serial production of ICBMs had
 been successfully organized,
 and in a speech in Ryazan just
 after the congress he again
 made this remark and added that
 Western observers, having given
 the matter second thought, have
 decided to agree with him.   Seri-
 al production, in normal Soviet
 usage, would mean producing
 standardized missiles at a planned
 rate  for  delivery-,  to opera-
 tional units, and presumably,
 this is what Khrushchev has in
 mind.  Although for some items
 a "mass production" stage fol-
 lows "serial production," this
 is probably inapplicable to
 ICBM production.
 Minister of Defense Mali-
 novsky and Deputy Chairman Usti-
 nov of the USSR Council of Min-
 isters also made noteworthy
 statements on rocket develop-
 ment.   Malinovsky said Soviet
 ICBMs could reach any part of
 the world, and precisely any
 spot because they are very ac-
 curate.   He also said the armed
 forces have been equipped with
 a whole series of military bal-
 listic missiles: intercontinen-
 tal;  short=, medium-,  and lo-*
 range continental;  and a whole
 group for tactical purposes.
 Ustinov--apparently re-
 sponsible for overseeing the mili-
 tary production programs--said
 the USSR is now "serially pro-
 ducing military rockets of all
 types and purposes  which, in
 the hands of Soviet armed forces
 ...wadll  give   a. worthy rebuff
 to any aggressors and adventur-
 ists."                 (Prepared       25X1

 EAST GERMANY IMPORTS DUTCH WORKERS TO REDUCE LABOR SHORTAGE
 About 90 Dutch  workers
 went to East Germany on 1 Feb-
 ruary to take jobs in the East
 German shipyards at Warnemuende
 in  spite  of  the    protests
 of local unions and warnings
 by Dutch Government officials.
 A Rotterdam firm, contracting
 with East Germany to supply la-
 bor for a one-year period, ad-
 vertised locally and received
 about 1,000 applications. The
 workers--under contract for a
 five-week period which is re-
 newable after a week's leave
 to return home--are to receive
 a generous wage compared with
 the Dutch  and  East  German
 scales, a major part of it in
 foreign exchange.
 Apparently other workers
 from Western Europe, particu-
 larly West Germans, will be
 brought to East Germany, and
 the opportunity to propagandize
 the East German provision of
 jobs for the unemployed in "cap-
 italist" states will be exploit-

 CHU TE LIKELY TO SUCCEED MAO TSE-TUNG AS GOVERNMENT CHAIRMAN
 The British Embassy in
 Peiping reports that Chu Te's
 candidacy for the chairmanship
 of the Chinese People's Repub-
 lic was being discussed as
 early as mid-January by "street
 committees"--the local citizens'
 organizations which normally
 would prepare public opinion
 for such changes.   Similar ex-
 planations:atthe grass-roots
 level followed Mao Tse-tung's
 decision last December to re-
 shortage, the regime risks in-
 creasing discontent among ship-
 yard workers, who have succeeded
 to date in resisting regime ef-
 forts to raise work norms. The
 East Germans may be concerned
 that the Westerners will be
 more efficient. Officials appar-
 ently plan to reassure East Ger-
 man workers on this point or
 have the Dutch workers adjust
 their efforts.
 The East German radio re-
 cently mentioned that there is
 a labor shortage of as much as
 115,000 persons in the country.
 These shortages are partly caused
 by the large number of refugees
 fleeing  to the West and to the
 fact that some industries,
 starved for up-to-date equip-
 ment, require more labor than
 they should.  Refugees number
 200,000 or more persons a year,
 the majority of whom are in the
 productive or potentially pro-
 ductive age group, presenting
 the regime with a very serious
 linquish his largely ceremonial
 government post.
 The 72-year-old Chu, the
 present vice chairman and a re-
 spected party elder, is a logi-
 cal choice to succeed Mao in
 the government job in April.
 Chu has been described as a
 sort of "lubricating oil" among
 the leadership--a man who would
 be willing to remain a figurehead
 and permit the real political
 power to lie elsewhere.

 The naming of Chu to the

 Liu is chairman of the standing

 PEIPING SHIFTS EMPHASIS IN RURAL WORK
 Peiping's agricultural
 programs apparently have been
 undergoing a re-evaluation in
 a series of national agricul-
 tural conferences since December.
 Peiping apparently has been forced
 to  recognize -:.that  the, com-
 pulsive pursuit of some of its
 agricultural program has not
 been sound.  Peiping almost cer-
 tainly overestimated the success
 of its experimental plots last
 year.   Based on these question-
 able successes, a number
 started to withdraw impor-
 tant acreage from production and
 SECRET
 ernment.  There is as yet no in-
 dication that either Liu or Chou
 will relinquish his government
 post at the congress.
 Chu has  been closely as-
 sociated with Mao since the
 early days of the party and prob-
 ably ranks next to him in popu-
 larity.   Regarded as the "grand
 old man" of the Chinese Communist
 Army, Chu commanded Peiping's
 armed forces from 1928 to 1945,
 and nominally until 1954.   He
 now is an elder statesman of the
 regime, occupying a number of
 senior party and government
 posts in which he acts primarily
 as a spokesman for Mao.
 Mao's decision to step down
 as government chairman apparent-
 ly had considerable impact on
 the average Chinese, who Peiping
 admits was unable to understand
 the "logic" of the decision.
 Concern over this popular reac-
 tion appears to have been an
 important factor in the delay
 of the congress from January--
 when it was originally scheduled
 --to April.  The discussion of
 Chu's candidacy at the local
 level appears to be the regime's  25X1
 first major effort to build up
 Mao's successor in the govern-
 ment.
 to farm greatly increased areas
 by methods used on last year's
 experimental plots.   This drive
 now has been shelved until na-
 tional yields reach more than
 ten times the 1958 level.
 It is evident that last
 year's spectacular iron and
 steel drive, whatever its suc-
 cess, brought some dislocations
 to the rural economy.  At its
 height last October, this drive
 took up to 25 percent of the
 rural labor force away from press-
 ing,  harvest and planting tasks.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 February 1959
 Apparently this was too much,
 even for China's labor-rich
 economy.   Crops lay unharvested
 in the fields, and normal trans-
 portation and distribution chan-
 nels were disrupted.   Peiping
 now describes its iron and steel
 program in rural areas as one
 to produce "more and better
 iron and steel with less man-
 power."
 Manpower is also to be
 taken away from water-conserv-
 ancy projects, which were
 highly publicized last winter,
 and from deep plowing, which
 the regime now finds expedient
 to restrict.   Peiping says that.
 it will be satisfied if deep
 plowing--which in most in-
 stances has meant manual dig-
 ging of the soil to a depth of
 several feet--is completed on
 only one third of the cultivated
 area and to a depth of one
 foot or only seven or eight
 inches.
 Rural manpower thus re-
 leased is to be employed for
 the most part in tasks directly
 connected with actual cultiva-
 tion.   At least half of a com-
 mune's labor force is to be
 devoted to work in the fields;
 one fourth is being devoted to
 the current campaign to expand
 the production of fertilizer.
 More attention is to be paid
 to what Peiping describes as
 "sideline" occupations--such as
 forestry, fishing, and the pro-
 duction of meat and vegetables.
 Peiping has urged this "diver-
 sification" on the communes and
 has even suggested that the
 communes should look to this
 source for higher income.
 Peiping at the same time
 has been at pains to point out
 that it definitely is not a-
 bandoning its plans for a bigger
 and better "giant leap forward"
 in agriculture this year.   The
 "tempo" of labor activity is
 to be stepped up, not just by
 lengthening the working day--
 Peiping acknowledges that a
 "man cannot last long without
 eating and sleeping"--but also
 by improving tools and organi-
 zation and thus raising labor
 productivity.
 It is apparent, however,
 that the immense labor require-
 ments of this year's leap for-
 ward will not be met by such
 measures alone.   The regime has
 in fact told its rural cadres
 that the "efficient measures"
 used in last year's mass labor
 campaigns should again be used.
 THE SITUATION IN CUBA
 The provisional Cuban Gov-
 ernment has assumed an appear-
 ance of greater unity with the
 appointment of Fidel Castro as
 prime minister.   Nevertheless,
 the lack of administrative ex-
 perience and organizational
 ability among many top officials
 will probably continue to limit
 the administration's effective-
 ness.   Castro will dominate the
 government, as he did before his
 position became official, and
 all authority and policy will
 emanate from the cabinet instead
 of the president.   Castro him-
 self, however, has no government
 experience and has demonstrated
 little political or administra-
 tive ability.
 The government is confronted
 with pressing financial, social,
 and labor problems which will

 quickly test its competence.
 The regime has already lost s me
 prestige and popularity because
 of delay in tackling these prob-
 lems.  Criticism, particularly
 from certain special interest
 groups such as labor and busi-
 ness, will become sharper if de-
 cisive measures are not initi-
 ated quickly.  Certain political
 groups with no voice in the gov-
 ernment, such as the followers
 of former President Carlos Prio
 Socarras and members of the Rev-
 olutionary Directorate, which
 have already demonstrated some
 opposition to the Castro move-
 ment, will try to exploit any
 further weakness or delay in the
 government program.   The admin-
 istration will probably give
 priority to land reform, long
 one of Castro's particular inter-
 ests.
 The first cabinet meeting
 under Castro's leadership, held
 on 17 February, launched an aus-
 terity program with a decree cut-
 ting cabinet salaries in half
 and another directed against
 graft among government officials.
 If enforced, these measures will
 be revolutionary to Cuba's try.-
 ditionally:~corrupt politics.
 Measures were also taken to re-
 open Havana's gambling casinos
 in order to avert a threatened
 hotel employees' strike and to
 bolster Cuba''s lagging tourist
 trade.
 There is no indication of
 a letup in Castro's "campaign
 against dictatorships," although
 activities against the Dominican
 Republic, Haiti, Nicaragua, and
 Paraguay have apparently not pro-
 gressed beyond the planning stage.
 Plotting will undoubtedly con-
 tinue, and members of the Castro
 movement will probably offer ma-
 terial aid to exile groups.   The
 antidictatorship propaganda cam-
 paign is now being directed at
 the Organization of American
 States (OAS), and both the Cuban
 ambassador to the OAS and Foreign
 Minister Agramonte are attempt-
 ing to have all countries under
 dictatorship expelled from mem-
 bership.   Cuba has threatened to
 withdraw from the, OAS if its
 plan is rejected.
 THE NEW VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT
 Venezuelan President Romulo
 Betancourt, inaugurated on  13
 February, has organized a coal-
 ition cabinet without Communists
 which apparently is acceptable
 to the three major left-of-cen-
 ter parties--his own Democratic
 Action (AD), the Republican Dem-
 ocratic Union (URD), and the
 Christian Democratic COPEI. For-
 mation of a coalition government
 fulfills one of the basic provi-
 sions of a unity pact signed by
 the three groups prior to the
 December elections.   None of the
 ministers is known to beunfriend-
 ly to the United States, and
 Betancourt has indicated he will
 not make any further precipitate
 changes in the relations between
 the government and the foreign
 oil companies such, as the issu-
 ance of the income-tax decree of
 last December.
 The 14-member cabinet--in-
 eluding four holdovers from the
 outgoing junta government--has
 three members each from the URD
 and COPEI but only two from the
 AD.   The  AD  members, however,
 hold the Ministries of Interior
 and of Mines and Hydrocarbons,
 the most important political and
 economic posts.   Moreover, the
 six politically "independent"
 members appear to g,.ve the cabi-
 net a strong AD orientation as
 well as considerable prestige

 with the AD.  The sixth, a re-
 nowned medical specialist and
 nephew of a prominent Venezuelan
 pro-Communist, is a technical
 appointee to the Ministry of
 Health.
 The URD, which polled a
 large vote last December in Cara-
 cas, where Betancourt has only
 limited support, received  the
 posts of labor, communications,
 and foreign relations.   The new
 foreign minister, Ignacio Arcaya,
 is president of the URD and seems
 more moderate in his views  on
 US-Venezuelan relations than his
 key party leaders.   Since these
 officials are likely to be con-

 problems, Betancourt may have

 also depend on the willingness
 of the URD and COPEI to sacri-

 the sake of unity, since govern-

 be credited to AD and thus fur-

 Members of the new govern-

 struggles over patronage, and
 beset by a divergence of re-

 man executive in which the oppo-
 sition by law has one third
 of the seats.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 February 1959
 The most disabling diffi'
 culty is the patronage split
 which places the NP's  three
 "ruralist" councilors, headed
 by Benito Nardone, in opposi-
 tion to the three "old-line"
 members.   The "old-line" group
 is controlled by 85-year-old
 Alberto Herrera, long-time NP
 boss, who holds no office but
 is determined to run the govern-
 ment from behind the scenes.
 Herrera has evinced no sign of
 placating the third important
 faction, the Blanco Democratic
 Union,   a  business-oriented
 group which, while not repre-
 sented in the nine-man execu-
 tive, won almost half the NP's
 51 seats in the 99-man Chamber
 of Deputies.
 The most urgent problems
 confronting the new government
 are the skyrocketing federal
 debt, the nation's decreasing
 productivity, and the increas-
 ing trade imbalance.   The gov-
 ernment debt has nearly doubled
 since 1954, chiefly as a result
 of inefficient state monopolies
 and welfare-state activities,
 while the gross national product
 has decreased in absolute as
 well as per-capita terms.   For-
 eign earnings from Uruguay's
 chief exports, wool and meat,
 were cut in half between 1953
 and 1957, partly because  po-
 litically inspired subsidies

 profitable channels.

 Prime Minister Verwoerd of
 the Union of South Africa has
 recently made  proposals  to
 strengthen white supremacy  by
 eliminating any African repre-
 sentation in Parliament                       and
 stimulating tribal differences.
 This is unlike~y, however, to
 improve South Africa's reputa-
 tion abroad, to  satisfy  the
 Africans, or to prevent even-
 tual racial disorders.
 Verwoerd proposes to es-
 tablish five areas, based on
 major tribal groups, in which
 the Africans would be allowed
 to exercise local control and
 to govern through a reconstitut-
 ed tribal hierarchy.   Each area
 would have a native secretary
 general with direct access to
 the white minister of Bantu de-
 velopment who would appoint him.
 The area would have a governing
 body, subject to the veto power
 of the minister, and a white res-
 ident commissioner general.   It
 would appoint an envoy to the
 national government.
 Although Verwoerd apparent-
 ly envisages autonomous Bantu
 states as entities within  a
 "Commonwealth of South Africa,"
 with the eventual withdrawal of
 white administration from the
 African areas, his proposals
 are unlikely to lessen the bit-
 ter racial tension within South
 Africa.
 Verwoerd has also asked
 Parliament to abolish the pres-

 tives in South. Africa's T63-mem-
 ber House of Assembly.                       This
 would eliminate the Africanb'
 last remaining token say in the
 legislature controlling their
 lives.
 The incumbent Nationalist
 party apparently believes that
 these proposals constitute "posi-
 tive" apartheid which would en-
 able the Africans, with limited
 financial aid from the govern-
 ment,  to develop their own in-
 dustries.   The government has
 already proposed a Bantu In-
 vestment Corporation Bill with
 an official share capital of
 $1,400,000 to stimulate econom-
 ic_: development 'in the native
 reserves.
 The Verwoerd government has
 virtually ignored the problem
 of the urbanized Af ricai ,  in
 line with the apartheid theory
 which aims at returning the
 Africans to their rural tribal
 groups.   Furthermore,  the pro-
 posals do not face up to the
 economic realities of South Afri-
 can life.   The economy depends
 on non-European labor for about
 90 percent of the working force,
 the native reserves can barely
 provide for the 3,000,000 Afri-
 cans now living in these rural
 areas, and the $1,400,000 in-
 vestment fund now envisaged ap-
 pears inadequate when compared
 with the $280,000,000 develop-
 mental aid considered a mini-
 mum by an official commission
 which'studied the problem re-
 cently.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 KHRUSHCHEV IN ACTION--THE DECEMBER PARTY PLENUM
 The Soviet party central
 committee met in plenary ses-
 sion on 15 December 1958 for
 the sixth time in a year and
 the second in two months.   In
 many respects the five-day
 session was unique.   In con-
 trast to the usual secrecy
 surrounding plenums,  the de-
 cision to hold it and the sub-
 jects for discussion were an-
 nounced publicly a month in
 advance.  Moreover,  the Soviet
 press and radio gave a day-by-
 day account of the proceedings,
 and a "stenographic report" of
 the plenum was published in
 book form a few weeks later.
 Thus there is some ques-
 tion as to just how typical the
 proceedings of this plenum
 were,   but when due allowance
 is made for the purpose behind
 all the publicity,  there still
 remains a reasonably reliable
 picture of Khrushchev and his
 central committee in action.
 Many of the particularly re-
 vealing parts of the plenum
 were omitted from Soviet press
 and radio accounts;  the follow-
 ing analysis,  therefore,  is
 based on the stenographic re-
 port and concentrates on the
 material that was not pub-
 lished at the time.
 Cult of Personality
 The strongest over-all
 impression regarding the plenum
 is that it was primarily de-
 signed to enhance the leader
 .mage of Nikita Khrushchev as
 the focus of loyalty or obedi-
 ence of the Soviet people and
 the model for subordinate
 leaders.   Although he moved
 rapidly after Stalin's death
 to seize control of the es-
 sential elements of power in
 the Soviet Union,  Khrushchev
 has been slow to use propaganda
 media deliberately to create
 an idealized picture of himself
 as the powerful paternal author-
 ity in Soviet society possess-
 ing all human virtues and no
 human frailties. The December
 plenum marks the first serious
 attempt to develop this leader
 image.
 This plenum was not a work-
 ing body in the sense that it
 heard,  discussed,  and formally
 approved new policies.   Khru-
 shchev said that "the work of
 our plenum will evidently con-
 stitute a political accounting
 by the party to the people on
 the condition of agriculture."
 Agriculture was chosen as the
 topic for discussion, presum-
 ably because it provided the
 ideal media in which to develop
 the Khrushchev leader image.   It
 is the field Khrushchev knows
 most about,  the field in which
 his policies have been active
 for the longest time and in
 which he feels they have been
 demonstrably successful.
 The volume of praise for
 Khrushchev at the plenum was
 unprecedented.   Nearly every
 speaker made a point of sin-
 glinghim out for eulogy or spe-
 cial recognition,  and the bulk
 of this praise was for him per-
 sonally--not,  as generally
 theretofore,  in his capacity as
 first secretary,  "head" of the
 party presidium,  or premier.
 The strongest praise came from
 Moscow Oblast First Secretary
 Kapitonov,  who called Khru-
 shchev }'a paragon of the
 Leninist style of leadership."
 Most speakers,  however,  related
 their praise to Khrushchev's
 specific policies, advice, or
 accomplishments in the agricul-
 tural sphere.
 An effort was evidently
 made to keep the praise within
 the bounds of realism,  to make
 it appear genuine,  as applying
 to a flesh-and-blood person--

 ?  "If Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev had listened
 to the doubters even alittle bit, then we would'not

 not to a superhuman being.   The
 stereotyped superlatives of the
 Stalin era, "omnipotent"  or
 "infallible," for example, are
 conspicuous by their absence.
 But as speaker after speaker
 added his bit of praise, an un-
 mistakable image of charismatic
 leadership emerged and the new
 "cult of personality" was car-
 ried one step closer to reali-
 zation.
 Attack on the Antiparty Group
 In volume of words and ex-
 travagance of invective,  the at-
 tack at the plenum on the "anti-
 party group" was the sharpest since
 the initial campaign following
 the group's defeat in June 1957.
 This fact, plus the appearance
 of J3ulganin to confess to a role
 of "nominal" leader of   the
 group, led some observers to
 conclude that denunciation of
 "antiparty" opposition to Khru-
 shchev was the real work of
 the plenum.   Read in the con-
 text of the full proceedings,
 however, the criticisms of the
 antiparty group are clearly
 seen to be there for the pur-
 pose of dramatically under-
 scoring Khrushchev's victorious
 leadership, as well as of em-
 phasizing the wisdom of his pol-
 icies and the deep debt of grati-
 tude the Soviet people owe him
 for saving them from the "dis-
 astroust"  policies of the de-
 feated leaders.
 The major speeches at the
 plenum all follow much the same
 outline:
 1) praise for the policies
 of Khrushchev   ("The outstand-
 ing occurrence in the life of
 the people was the September
 1953 central committee plenum
 which accepted, on the report
 of N.  S.       Khrushchev, the his-
 torical decisions on agricul-
 ture");
 2)        comments on efforts
 of the "antiparty group" to
 frustrate Khrushchev's policies,
 and the struggle and victory
 of "good" over "evil" ("I was
 amazed at the great work,  the
 will power, the patience, and
 the decisiveness which Nikita
 Sergeyevich Khrushchev dis-
 played when he struggled against
 the antiparty group and resolute-
 ly routed out their antiparty
 intrigues"); and
 3)  a portrayal of the im-
 provement of agricultural con-
 ditions in the speaker's bail-
 iwick since September 1953 and
 a discussion of what is being
 done to fulfill the "wise pol-
 icies of Nikita Sergeyevich" to
 further increase agricultural
 production and improve condi-
 tions in the countryside.
 The "antiparty group" is
 thus a symbol of the futility
 and danger of opposing Khru-
 shchev's policies,   a symbol
 of obstacles overcome, and an
 affirmation of his right to lead.

 NNOW,      SECRET
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 February 1959
 The Plenum at Work
 The plenum was obviously
 carefully planned.   There is
 virtually no sign of spontane-
 ity in any of the speeches and
 none at all of debate.   Except
 for Khrushchev's irrepressible
 interjections in many of the
 speeches, the whole proceedings
 were sca.rsely, distinguishable
 from the completely stereotyped
 Supreme Soviet sessions,  in
 which carefully prepared speeches
 grind. through   to   preordained
 unanimous   conclusions  and
 only minor changes for the sake
 of appearances are made in the
 government's proposals.
 If the December plenum is
 any guide, the meetings of the
 central  committee  are  much
 larger forums than previously
 supposed.   In addition to the
 full and candidate members of
 the central committee, the
 members of the central audit-
 ing committee were also pres-
 ent.   Sixty-seven speakers came
 to the rostrum during the five-
 day session,  but only slightly
 over half of these were mem-
 bers of the central committee.
 The others were collective
 farm chairmen, tractor brigade
 leaders,  lower echelon party
 workers, and two speakers who
 were not even members of the
 party.
 The general impression
 conveyed by the stenographic
 report is that the central com-
 mittee plenum has become just
 another public forum for the
 transmission of Khrushchev's
 ideals, personality, and drive.
 It has evolved from the mori-
 bund institution of Stalin's
 later years,  through a period
 in which it was an occasional
 arbiter in disputes that could
 not be resolved in the party
 presidium,  to its present sta-
 tus--a sort of "Supreme Soviet"
 of the party.
 A Secret Session?
 Although billed as a steno-
 graphic report, the published
 volume does not include a ver-
 batim account of all that went
 on at the plenum.   Part of one
 of the minor speeches was clear-
 ly paraphrased,  and the report
 on the work of the editorial
 commission was not given.   The
 major omission,   however,  re-
 lates to the leadership shake-
 up that had taken place in the
 Turkmen Republic just a few
 days before the December plenum
 convened in Moscow, and suggests
 that a "secret session" of the
 plenum was held to consider the
 matter.
 In the Turkmen shake-up,
 First Secretary Babayev and an-
 other secretary,  Durdyyeva, were
 dismissed for "gross mistakes
 in their work"; Dzhuma Karayev
 was elected new first secretary.
 Karayev reported to the plenum
 in Moscow on the affair,,  but
 his remarks were summarized with
 the statement, "Comrade Karayev
 then went on to dwell on cer-
 tain questions of intraparty
 work."
 It was later revealed that
 Babayev has been ousted from
 the all-union party central com-
 mittee, presumably at the De-
 cember plenum.   Babayev is the
 only person other than the orig-
 inal-Jour of the "antiparty
 group" to be ousted from the
 central committee since the So-
 viet 20th party congress in
 February 1956.   The secrecy sur-
 rounding his ouster indicates
 that there are still some func-
 tions of the central committee
 too sensitive for public scrutiny.
 Khrushchev in-Action
 Khrushchev delivered the
 opening report and the conclud-
 ing address,  and his name and
 spirit dominated every speech.
 As the stenographic report re-
 veals, he dominated the pro-
 ceedings in other ways as well.
 Beginning with the first speak-
 er and continuing throughout
 the plenum, he interrupted
 speech after speech to inject
 a thought, make a correction,
 or call the speaker to task.

 Over half of the speeches were
 interrupted in this way.   In
 some cases the interruptions
 were so extensive that the

 of corn has done much to promote the high yield of
 this crop in all kolkhozes of the oblast.

 GITALOV:  Our land is steppe and and zone.
 KHRUSHCHEV:  I know.  IPve been in your steppe.

 And IN not criticizing you.        I only want you to
 produce more.

 but I cantt answer exactly because I spent three
 and a half months in America during this period.
 KHRUSHCHEV: Now you probably don't understand
 Ukrainian any more.
 logue between the speaker and
 Khrushchev.
 There is little question
 that this is one of Khrushchev's
 ways of working.  He has abso-
 lute confidence in his own
 knowledge and judgment, and is
 impatient with others.   He
 seems to feel an inner neces-
 sity to push things along by
 injecting the force of his per-
 sonality and authority into
 the discussions.  He is much
 more disposed to argue and ex-
 plain a point, however, than
 simply to order a certain pol-
 icy carried out.
 SE.HTCHAS17YT (Komsomol secretary):  It is our
 opinion that we should proceed to establish certain
 nonworking days for students (working on kolkhozes),
 additional leave, and other advantages.
 KHRUSHCHEV:  I think we should be careful about
 offering paid nonworking days to the workers because
 this could be used to advantage not only by the young
 men wht want to study but also by those who do  not
 want to work.
 SEMICHAS`THY: Then, perhaps they could be select-
 ed on the basis of recommendations by public organi-
 sations.
 KHRUSHCHEV:  Even recommendations may not help
 much either, as everyone has an in-law or a brother
 and everybody will recommend.
 When RSFSR Deputy Minister
 of Agriculture Yurkin complained
 of an administrative disagree-
 ment over the use of sugar beets,
 Khrushchev said:   "I'll advise
 you what to do with the sugar
 beets the plants can't process.
 fatten hogs and get very good
 lard.'   Yurkin objected that it
 was a problem of commodity pro-
 duction, whereupon Khrushchev
 explained,  "Comrade Yurkin, pork
 --that is also commodity pro-
 duction.   If the sugar plants
 cannot process the beets,  let
 the hogs process them and con-
 vert them to lard.   That will
 be commodity production."
 The argument continued in
 much the same vein until Yurkin
 acknowledged that sugar beets
 should be regarded both as a
 raw material for sugar produc-
 tion and as a product for fat-
 tening cattle,   Then Khrushchev
 said,  T,See, we were agreed."
 HUSTAFAYEV (Azerbaydzhan party secretary, pro-
 posing a system of fees for pasturing of individual-
 ly owned livestock):  With this money it is possible
 to establish an intercollectivefarm monetary fund
 and build intercollective farm roads and water lines.
 KHRUSHCIiEV:  Comrade Ilustafayev, we are not
 raising objections against reformation of the coun
 tryside, but you are introducing an incorrect pro-
 posal.  h'hat you are talking about is a tax: it is a
 penal policy and is not appropriate for us.  Hdu.cu:
 ttve work must be introduced among the population.
 It is necessary, first of all, that the Communists
 working in the village be actual examples in this
 matter.
 JrUSTAFAYEV:  Right, Plikita Sergeyevich, but to
 make use of this possibility takes time.
 YHRESHCIIEV:    Roy is more time needed?   Forty-
 one years of Soviet power have passed.   This is suf-
 ficient time.
 In this exchange, however, Yurkin
 had the last word.   He answered,
 perhaps more bravely than wise-
 ly,  "Agreed, except about the
 sugar plants."  The stenographic
 report notes that this sally was
 greeted w~;h laughter from the
 hall.
 Khrushchev's compulsion to
 be the center of attraction was
 made clear by the occasional
 irrelevance of his remarks. Most
 of his interruptions, however,
 show him off in a better light.
 Some of his interjections seem
 to have been planned together
 with the speaker to enable him
 to makes point.   This appears
 to Piave been the sole purpose

 for one speech in particular--
 that of Dubkovetsky, a kolkhoz
 chairman from the Ukraine. It
 was the shortest speech at the
 plenum, consisting of little
 more than an introduction and
 a dialogue with Khrushchev.
 Khrushchev:   "Fedor Ivan-
 ovich, what is the percentage
 of corn to the over-all area
 planted to grain crops at your
 kolkhoz?"
 Dubkovetsky.   "Almost 30
 percent."
 K:   "And if corn were to
 take up one half of that area?"
 D4   "We could do that by
 cutting down on other grain."
 K:   "Perhaps wheat?"
 D.   "We. get 2,200 pounds
 of wheat per acre."
 RUDEIJIO  (a rayon party secretary):  Practice
 in applying the new:nethod shows that the best com-
 binatton of manual labor and machines is achieved in
 the larger field teams.   Therefore, the kolkhozes are
 currently employed in adding to the staff of these
 field teams.

 Pysin hastily replied:   "We will
 do this, of course, Nikita Ser-
 geyevich, and will certainly
 correct the situation."
 Taken as a whole,  Khru-
 shchev's interruptions contrib-
 uted to a picture of him as
 wise, paternal, benevolent,
 firm but reasonable, accessible,
 and human--all elements in the
 leader image he is trying to
 develop.
 Khrushchev's Pet Project
 Khrushchev may have chosen
 to discuss agriculture at the
 plenum for purposes other than
 consideration and approval of
 new departures in agricultural
 policy, but he is not one to
 pass up a good opportunity to
 plug some of his pet projects.
 and do a little pre-21st party
 congress thumping for fulfill-
 ment of Seven-Year-Plan agri-
 cultural goals.   The plenum re-
 port provides a unique gauge of
 the intensity of Khrushchev's
 obsession with corn as an agri-
 cultural panacea.   He not only
 seized every opportunity to
 extol the merits of corn but,
 when no obvious occasion pre-
 sented itself, he created one.
 He interrupted speech after
 speech, many times completely
 out of context, to question or
 badger the speaker about corn,
 and he was particularly impa-
 tient with any mention of ob-
 stacles.
 Khrushchev obviously feels
 that the merits of corn are still
 insufficiently appreciated.
 When one secretary asserted,  "In
 our attitude toward corn, none
 of us are skeptics," Khrushchev
 replied, "There are still many;
 they have only begun to talk
 less."  One kolkhoz chairman,
 evidently paying close attention
 to Khrushchev's sales pitch,
 offered sage counsel to the
 skeptics:   "The only place corn
 won't grow is where party and
 government organs underestimate
 its tremendous-political sig-
 nificance."
 From these interchanges,
 as well as from other aspects
 of the plenum, there emerges a
 clearer picture of Khrushchev
 bent on obtaining his agricul-
 tural goals through party per-
 suasion, drawing out local ini-
 tiative and resources, and
 creating competition among the
 agricultural areas.   His un-
 bounded enthusiasm for corn and
 his faith in the presence of
 vast untapped agricultural re-
 sources permeated the plenum
 and certainly leaves the impres-
 sion that he is genuinely con-
 fident that the major agricul-
 tural goals of the Seven-Year
 Plan can be achieved.

 The East European regimes

 September, and October 1958 to

 implications of the Chinese com-
 mune experiment.                             Factual ac-
 counts of the experiment were
 presented sporadically by their
 mass media during this period,
 but authoritative commentary
 was almost nonexistent.
 The communes,  as initially
 built up by Chinese propaganda
 media, had to East Europeans in
 general an Oriental, rather in-
 human aura about them which,
 even to confirmed Communists,
 did not make them appealing as
 an example to follow in Commu-
 nist development.   This reaction
 of the ordinary people was also
 true, if to a slightly lesser
 degree, of liberally inclined
 Communists.   Western press re-
 ports in October that Polish
 Communists were "appalled" at
 the degree of regimentation and
 conformity in the communes were
 probably accurate.
 Yugoslavia
 Yugoslavia played up for
 its own purposes those aspects
 of the communes--their mili-
 tary appearance, their expropri-
 ation of private property, and
 their disruptive effect on fam-
 ily life--which were most likely
 to be distasteful to the satel-
 lites.   The Yugoslavs were, of
 course, influenced strongly by
 China's actively hostile role
 in the bloc dispute with Bel-
 grade.   Nonetheless, Belgrade
 concluded that its approach would
 find a sympathetic audience not
 only among the Eastern European
 people, but also among eien.3nts
 of the Communist parties who
 still favored liberal policies.
 President Tito spoke on 23
 November of the "military com-
 munes," claiming the experiment
 had little in common with Marx-
 ism, and contrasting the Chinese
 approach with the humanitarian-
 ism and material incentives
 which were a part of the Yugo-
 slav "road"  By early December
 the Yugoslavs were goading the
 satellite regimes, calling at-
 tention to their lack of com-
 mentary on the Chinese program
 and adding that this was the
 first time that an important

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 February 1959
 Satellites Reserved
 The satellite regimes,
 nevertheless, continued to act
 with reserve. Only in Poland
 did any commentary appear which
 might have been construed as
 critical.   The Polish youth
 organ Sztandar Mlodych said in
 mid-September: "it is difficult
 to foresee the implementation
 of this resolution....   Even a
 most fanatical disciple of de-
 centralization must admit that
 during a certain historical pe-
 riod, centralism was a useful,
 nay,  an indispensable thing."
 Such criticism appeared to
 reflect a more conservative
 Cctnmunist outlook, which took
 the scheme to task because it
 implied that an important phase
 of development of the Soviet
 model would be skipped.  This
 may have paralleled similar mis-
 givings in the Kremlin about the
 experiment.   Even doctrinaire
 Communists thus reacted unfavor-
 ably to the communes, preferring
 for the most part to look for
 inspiration to the less radical,
 more Western-ori. OL& C.ed example
 of the Soviet Union.
 The satellite leaders had
 good reason for their cautious
 approach to the commune ques-
 tion.   If the Chinese approach
 to."building Communism" were to
 be accepted by Moscow and its
 application encouraged in East-
 ern Europe,  it could be deduced
 that radical basic policy changes
 were in order, especially in
 agriculture.   This prospect was
 unlikely to be greeted with en-
 thusiasm by the party leaders,
 particularly in Poland and Hun-
 gary.
 Stalinists'  Reaction
 This was by no means the
 case, however, among all Commu-
 nist leaders in Eastern Europe.
 To many of the Stalinists in
 the Eastern European parties,
 the hard-line,  forced-draft,
 radically leftist approach of
 the Chinese "great leap forward"
 evoked a favorable response.
 Many of these Stalinists approved
 the spirit of the Chinese ap-
 proach and saw in the program
 features which they could use
 to justify their own views on
 domestic policies, as well as
 to criticize their less zealous
 opponents.
 During the October 1958
 plenum of the Polish United
 Workers'  (Communist) party,
 prominent members of the "Nato-
 lin" faction of the party seized
 on certain features of the Chi-
 nese Communist experiment to
 justify their criticism of Go-
 mulka's domestic policies. Cer-
 tain industrial techniques in
 use in Communist China were re-
 ferred to with the implication
 that Poland's industrial policies
 would benefit by emulation.
 The Stalinist Stanislaw
 Lapot, refuting an argument Go-
 mulka had often used to support
 his agricultural policy, said
 that the experiences of several
 bloc countries--and "especially
 the People's Republic of China"
 --showed that active collectivi-
 zation did not necessarily en-
 tail a decrease of productivity
 in the early stages.   The serious-
 ness of these attacks is re-
 flected in Gomulka's summation
 at the end of the plenum in which
 he insisted that the Chinese
 achievements were not applicable
 to Poland.
 Although there is little
 direct evidence of similar ac-
 tions by Stalinists in the other
 satellites, they too probably
 seized on the Chinese program
 to support their arguments.
 In Hungary, Kadar has been
 under pressure from his Stalinist
 opponents for a sharp increase
 in collectivization and the em-
 ployment of coercive measures
 against recalcitrant peasants.
 Following a party meeting in
 Budapest to discuss the regime's
 agricultural policy,  Kadar denied
 on 25 January that Hungary was
 ready for a "big, swift leap

 forward" in agricultural collec-
 tivization.   His terminology
 suggested that during the de-
 bates the Hungarian Stalinists,
 like their Polish counterparts,
 had drawn on the Chinese Commu-
 nist approach to support their
 attacks against him.
 Bulgaria
 The general "hard-line"
 spirit of the Chinese Communist
 program held considerable ap-
 peal for the Bulgarian leaders,
 most of whom were entirely sym-
 pathetic to a  walinist-type
 approach.   Not the least enthu-
 siastic of these was former
 party chief Vulko Chervenkov,
 who led an official delegation
 to China in October, and whose
 speeches and official statements
 at the conclusion of his visit
 reflected clear,  although guard-
 ed,  enthusiasm for the Chinese
 program.
 In early November the Bul-
 garian leaders launched a rad-
 ical new economic program which,
 while primarily inspired by and
 based on Soviet experience,  also
 reflected inspiration from the
 Chinese Communist experiment.
 The Soviet-type amalgamated
 collective--not the Chinese com-
 mune--was adopted as the basic
 unit of the Bulgarian program,
 but the program was described
 in Chinese terminology such as
 forward progress by "leaps and
 bounds," and used Chinese tech-
 niques such as "voluntary" mass
 labor and fixed periods of pro-
 ductive labor for party and
 government officials.
 Thus,  although there is no
 evidence that the Bulgarian pro-
 gram ever was consciously mod-
 eled on the Chinese example,
 during the initial period of
 confusion and lack of clear
 ideological guidance from Mos-
 cow,  the Bulgarian leaders may
 have seized overly hastily on
 the spirit and some of the fea-
 tures of the Chinese Communist
 program which they felt would
 help their own scheme along.
 Bulgarian party leaders were
 themselves confused at this
 time over the extent to which
 the Chinese example should be
 emulated.   Even before party
 boss Zhivkov launched his pro-
 gram, overly zealous local Com-
 munist officials mistakenly
 anticipated what it would entail
 by taking it on themselves to
 organize certain "communes,"
 one of them avowedly on the Chi-
 nese Communist model.
 Despite this initial burst
 of excessive zeal, however, once
 the Chinese Communists began to
 tone down their approach and the
 Soviet attitude on the communes
 became clearer, the Bulgarian
 leaders, by speeches and articles
 in publications,  emphatically
 denied Chinese Communist influ-
 ence in their program.   They
 stressed that the Chinese program
 was applicable only to Chinese
 conditions, and conversely that
 the new Bulgarian economic pro-
 gram was based exclusively on
 the Soviet model.   Analysis of
 a subsequent reorganization of
 the administrative structure in
 January reveals that although
 certain Chinese-type features
 may have been included,  the re-
 organization was indeed based
 primarily on Soviet practice.
 Some of the other satellites
 adopted certain features of the
 Chinese Communist program during
 this initial period.   Albania,
 Bulgaria,  and East Germany adopted
 the practice of voluntary labor
 by party and government function-
 aries, and East Germany went
 even further by requiring that
 military officers serve in the
 ranks for a period of one year.
 At the East German central com-
 mittee meeting of 15-1.7 January,
 moreover, party leader Ulbricht
 strongly emphasized the necessity
 to develop a "communal spirit"
 in East Germany,

 Chinese retreat was in process

 19 February 1959
 and the Soviet attitude was
 clarified, the satellite press,
 both in reportage and authorita-
 tive commentary, came out in
 faithful reflection of the So-
 viet line.   The communes were
 discussed extensively, but it
 was always stressed that they
 were applicable only to China.
 Peiping's View
 Although the Chinese claims
 in July and August 1958 appar-
 ently were not consciously in-
 tended as a direct challenge to
 Moscow in its role as bloc ideo-
 logical preceptor, Moscow's cool
 reception of the initial Chinese
 claims and the sparse comment
 which marked East European sat-
 ellite treatment of the communes
 probably made it clear to the
 Chinese by late October that
 they did not have a friendly
 audience,
 In the interest of improv-
 ing relations with Moscow and
 the rest of the bloc, Peiping
 began to restrict the applica-
 bility  of the communes to China
 --a propaganda treatment which
 became more pronounced following
 Soviet Ambassador Yudin's speech
 in Peiping on 6 November.   He
 reminded the Chinese that in-
 dustrial production, rather than
 forms of rural collectivization,
 was the key prerequisite for
 beginning the "transition to
 Communism."   In  subsequent
 statements likely to receive
 international publicity, Peiping
 stressed that China was still
 in the stage of "socialist con-
 struction" and dropped the claim
 that the commune movement had
 brought the country to the verge
 of the "transition to Communism:'
 The Chinese retreated dras-
 tically in subsequent public
 statements on the ideological
 significance of the communes,
 and recent comments indicate
 that Peiping's public line for
 the time being--as reflected in
 Chou En-lai's statements at the
 Soviet party congress--will be
 to encourage the rest of the
 bloc to follow the Soviet ex-
 ample in Communist development.
 Moscow's View
 Moscow probably saw in the
 extravagant claims which the Chi-
 nese attached to their communes
 --the implication that they had
 discovered a special and uni-
 versally applicable form of
 social organization--a potential
 threat to its ideological leader-
 ship of the Communist bloc. This
 leadership has always rested on
 the claim that Soviet experience,
 by virtue of its length and re-
 sults, must serve as the basic
 example for all other Communist
 parties; acceptance of Peiping's
 pretensions would clearly have
 tended to undermine this article
 of faith.
 Moscow's displeasure with
 the communes is probably more
 directly related, however, to
 fears of the unsettling influ-
 ence which the Chinese develop-
 ment might have in Eastern Eu
 rope, where political ambitions
 and economic conditions might
 render the Chinese example at-
 tractive to certain elements,
 Moscow has yet to express
 any enthusiasm for the communes,
 but whatever their future in
 China and their effects on Sino-
 Soviet relations, Moscow appar-
 ently succeeded in persuading
 the Chinese to scale down their
 claims in the interests of sta-
 bility in Eastern Europe and to
 publicize this retreat at the
 Soviet 21st party congress.
 Chou En-lai stressed that China
 would follow a common road based
 on Soviet experience and empha-
 sized the applicability of the
 communes only to China, referring
 to this four times in one sen-
 tence.  His comments were rein-
 forced by the advice of Soviet
 Ambassador Yudin, who stated at
 the congress that all Communists
 who are "willing to understand
 what Communism is" should study
 the  documents  of  the  con-.
 gress.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 February 1959
 Following this display of
 Chinese support for  the  re-
 affirmation of Soviet ideologi-
 cal leadership, the satellite
 leaders  assembled in Moscow
 could have few illusions that
 they would be able to cite Chi-
 nese precedents to justify their
 views on  domestic  policies.
 Moreover,   the Staiini3ts in
 the satellite parties, many of
 whom were not in Moscow but
 nevertheless received the mes-
 sage via bloc media, must have
 realized that, for the present
 at least, it would be dangerous
 to look to Peiping rather than
 to Moscow for ideological in-
 spiration against their polit:-   25X1
 cal opponents, especially when
 these opponents had Moscow's
 endorsement.
 The South Korean economy
 in 1958 advanced at a far slow-
 er pace than in the previous
 year and was marred both by a
 resumption of inflation and a
 precipitate decline in the rate
 of increase in gross national
 product.   Several major factors
 indicate that this situation
 may worsen in 1959.   General
 concern with short-run prob-
 lems, however, tends to obscure
 the broader problem of South
 Korea's almost complete depend-
 ence  on foreign aid--it now
 is receiving one fifth of all
 American foreign economic
 grants--and its continuing
 failure to pave the way for
 substantial reduction or termi-
 nation of such aid.
 Although agri-
 cultural and indus-
 trial production has
 increased, it may
 soon be overtaken by
 population growth.

 Budget and Fiscal Operations
 The South Korean national
 budget for 1959 is nominally
 balanced at $780,000,000.   In re-
 ality,  there will be at least
 a $30,000,000 deficit.   In all
 probability, this shortage will
 be made up through issuances of
 currency and will be accompanied
 by credit expansion, with conse-
 quent inflationary results. The
 resort to monetary expansion, a
 course the government prefers
 to improving tax collections or
 increasing  production, is a
 major cause of financial insta-
 bility in South Korea and may
 be even more attractive in the
 future when domestic revenue
 will be required to replace aid

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 19 February 1959
 Military expenditures,
 which constitute 36 percent of
 the budget, in effect are fi-
 nanced   entirely    with funds
 generated by the domestic sale
 of aid goods.   Customs and for-
 eign-exchange taxes, which pro-
 vide another 19 percent of reve-
 nues, derive primarily from aid
 imports.   Thus, aid finances
 more than half of the govern-
 mental budget.
 In 1957 the wholesale price
 level, which had increased to
 more than 230 times that  of
 1947, was brought under control
 temporarily as a result of cur-
 rency stabilization and the ar-
 rival of considerable aid goods.
 However, the price rise was re-
 sumed in the latter half of 1958
 and by the end of the year to-
 taled 8,8 percent over the pre-
 vious year, according to the
 Seoul wholesale index.   Further
 inflation is expected in 1959,
 A cardinal factor in this
 inflation is the penchant for
 speculation among South Korean
 businessmen and financiers,
 which helps to explain the seri-
 ous lack of private long-term
 investment.
 The government's failure
 to adhere to a program of limit-
 ing currency and credit expan-
 sion in 1958 was the immediate
 cause of the renewed price rise.
 This expansion of money supply,
 amounting to 32 percent by the
 end of the year, stemmed from
 increased bank loans--many of
 them designed to assist the
 Liberal party's preparations for
 the 1960 elections--from doubled
 wages for government and mili-
 tary personnel, and from rice
 loans to farmers.
 Significantly, prices in-
 creased despite bumper grain
 crops which depressed "'food
 prices about 18 percent during
 the year,  but not enough to
 overcome price increases in oth-
 er basic consumer commodities.
 A survey taken by a major Korean
 newspaper indicated that the
 farm population, which constitutes
 70 percent of total population,
 was afflicted not only with gen-
 erally increased consumer prices,
 but also failed to meet produc-
 tion costs because of the de-
 pressed prices for grain.
 Grain Production and Consumption
 South Korean grain produc-
 tion--consisting of a barley-
 wheat-rye crop in early summer
 and a rice crop in autumn--is
 increasing and is generally be-
 lieved to equal or exceed pre-
 World War II levels.   The bumper
 1958 rice crop set a postwar
 record.

 However, production is not
 keeping pace with the population
 growth.  Total population is
 about 2:;,000,000 and is increas-
 ing at the rate of 2 percent an-
 nually.                                                        Per capita rice con-
 sumption, which in 1958 was 125
 kilograms and still above prewar
 levels, is declining.   Agricul-
 tural research, with an eye to-
 ward combating crop disease and
 increasing yields, has been
 virtually ignored by the govern-
 ment, and grain imports, which
 constitute 20 percent of  total
 consumption, are increasing,
 with heavy dependence on Ameri-
 can surpluses,

 Rice is South Korea's best
 potential export.   During the
 late stages of the Japanese oc-
 cupation of Korea, more than
 1,000,000 tons were exported
 annually.   In the postwar,  pe-
 riod, rice shipments from South
 Korea, the major producing area,
 have been limited to 90,000 tons
 to Japan in 1950.   A 5,000-ton
 sale to Okinawa recently was
 concluded, and South Korean of-
 ficials finally are contemplat-
 ing a rice export program which,
 however, would require the sub-
 stitution of cheaper grains in
 the Korean diet.
 Marine production is the
 nation's major source of protein
 and also frequently is cited for
 its export potential.   Average
 annual production from catches
 in South Korean waters during
 the period. 1936-1940 was approx-
 imately 630,000 metric tons.
 Estimated production in 1958 was
 only 62 percent of this.   Post-
 war consumption per capita is
 down severely, and marine ex-
 ports were valued at slightly
 more than $2,000,000 in 1958.
 There are several reasons
 for the postwar shortfall. Fish-
 ery resources, especially sar-
 dines, in Korean coastal waters
 have been depleted.   The Japa-

 nese, during their withdrawal
 from Korea in 1945, took with
 them a major portion of the
 Korea-based fishing fleet, and
 refrigerating  .  and    canning
 facilities were destroyed in the
 Korean war,
 The present South Korean
 fishing industry, which employs
 2 percent of the labor force and
 contributes only 1 percent of
 the gross national product, lacks
 boats,  ;filled manpower, and
 processing facil.,.ties.   It also
 suffers from a continuing lack
 of capital investment for re-
 habilitation.   Like agriculture,
 however,  fisheries development
 has been secondary to industrial
 development.
 Industry
 Industrial development,
 while advancing gradually, 'ias
 been unbalanced, with the result
 that some industrial and manu-
 factured products exceed demand,
 a few meet demand adequately,
 while most production is unable
 to keep pace with the market
 growth.
 By the end of September 1958
 the general production index had
 risen 80 percent above the 1955
 base.  The greatest progress had
 been achieved in the manufactur-
 ing sector, but South Korea's
 heavy dependence on imported raw
 materials has not been reduced
 appreciably.
 Textile production, which
 requires imports averaging $30,-
 000,000 annually, exceeds domes-
 tic demand but cannot compete
 pricewise in foreign markets with-
 out government subsidy. Tungsten
 concentrate production is cur-
 tailed due to a lack of foreign
 markets, but sales prospects for
 1959 have improved.   The supply
 of anthracite coal exceeds re-
 quirements, so that the industry
 is depressed generally and sev-
 eral mines have been shut down.
 Electric power production
 is not quite adequate to meet
 present requirements, but con-
 struction of additional power
 facilities is contemplated.
 South Korea also hopes to become
 self-sufficient in chemical fer-
 tilizers on completion of a three-
 plant construction program in
 1962.
 Elsewhere domestic produc-
 tion prospects are much less

 proximately $375,000,000 annual-

 narrowing this gap is twofold--
 expanding exports and, through
 the development of local indus-

 domestic  and  foreign  raw ma-
 terials, reducing the need for
 imported  finished  and  semi-

 The gradual reduction of
 American aid automatically will
 reduce imports, but the country
 will continue to require a high
 level of imports to maintain
 its industry and present stand-

 rice exports in late 1959 and
 in future years could be siz-

 more between the port of entry

 price fluctuations from area
 to area,   In both rural and
 urban areas,  too,  there are in-

 Prospects
 Despite the industrial de-
 velopment that has taken place,
 the South Korean economy re-
 mains predominantly agricultural,
 Economic activity involves wide-
 spread financial speculation,
 and the considerable sums of
 available private capital are
 utilized for "quick-money"
 schemes rather than for long-
 term investment.   In one sense,
 this problem is largely psycho-
 logical, reflecting general
 pessimism about the future of
 the economy and the country.
 SECRET
 Prospects for foreign invest-
 ment in South Korea are poor.
 In some instances, indus-
 trial projects--as well as
 fiscal programs--seem too large
 and too complex for the coun-
 try's physical, human, and fi-
 nancial resources.   Even some
 small,  logically conceived
 enterprises, designed to reduce
 the import burden, have failed
 because private investors were
 not forthcoming.   The extreme
 shortage of managerial, techni-
 cal, and labor skills is a
 serious liability.
 The caliber of top Korean
 economic officials has improved
 markedly in the last three years,
 offering hope for at least limited
 progress in the immediate future.
 However,the basic handicaps which
 the country faces cast strong doubt
 on its ability to maintain the    25X1

 the long run without substantial
