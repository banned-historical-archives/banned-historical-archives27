 Summary
 Information available
 as of 20 October 1985
 was used in this report.
 China's Party Conference:
 The Waning ofhe
 Ancien Regime)
 From 12 to 24 September, the Communist Party of China held an
 unprecedented series of meetings that together constitute a major mile-
 stone in Deng Xiaoping's decadelong struggle to restructure the party
 leadership. In two plenary sessions of the Central Committee and an
 extraordinary conference of party delegates, Deng managed to significant-
 ly weaken the conservative party old guard, promote his allies to the top
 party organizations, reduce the influence of China's senior military
 officers, and win a new party endorsement of economic reform.
 Specifically:
 ? One-quarter of the 210-member Central Committee, including 10 of the
 27 members of the Politburo, resigned.
 ? Ninety-one younger leaders were named full or alternate members of the
 Central Committee.
 ? Six new members joined the Politburo-five for the first time and one
 promoted from alternate-and five were added to the Secretariat.
 ? The Central Committee approved guidelines for the 1986-90 Five-Year
 Plan that strongly reaffirm the reformist course of economic policy.
 We believe Deng accomplished most of his short-term objectives at the
 meetings:
 ? The balance of forces in the Politburo and the Central Committee has
 shifted to the reformers.
 ? The influence on decisionmaking of the party's old guard, and especially
 its military contingent, has been significantly reduced.
 ? The leading reformers placed proteges on both the Politburo and
 Secretariat. Hu Yaobang put three on each body and Zhao Ziyang one.
 ? Serious economic performance problems, and growing conservative criti-
 cisms of reform policies, were not allowed to derail the economic
 development program approved in 1984.
 Despite these important gains, the meetings did not resolve all of Deng's
 short-term political problems. His most forceful conservative critics,
 namely Chen Yun and Peng Zhen, remain on the Politburo and will try to
 restrain political and economic reform plans. Party conservatives maintain
 a strong foothold in the propaganda apparatus and will continue to insist on

 justifying economic policies on strict ideological grounds. Moreover, it
 appears that the reformers did not get all the top appointments we believe
 they had sought. In particular, there has been no confirmation that the
 September sessions endorsed Deng's succession plan, which calls for Hu
 Yaobang to replace Deng as chairman of. the party's Military Commission
 and Hu Qili to succeed Hu as General Secretary.
 Over the long term, the leadership changes Deng put in place at the
 September meetings will assume greater significance. In our view, the
 meetings mark a major turning point in the generational transfer of power.
 Although the old guard remains influential, little now bars the way to
 consolidation by the successors on the Politburo and Secretariat. We also
 believe the restructured party. leadership will be more energetic and
 flexible than its predecessor, and better able to carry out its decisionmak-
 ing functions.
 Deng is changing the social and ideological base of the party. The
 reconstituted Central Committee heralds the ascendancy of the polytechnic
 institute graduates over the peasant activists, soldiers, and intellectuals of
 the older generation. The new leaders are more sympathetic to Deng's
 brand of "socialism with Chinese characteristics": free of 19th-century
 dogma and able to absorb the technologies and ideas of capitalist countries,
 while maintaining the party's dominance in all political matters.
 The resounding vote of confidence in economic reform policies contained in
 the five-year-plan guidelines means that Beijing will continue its trial-and-
 error approach to economic development-reducing the role of central
 planning, refining its use of macroeconomic levers to control the economy,
 yet permitting greater individual initiative and free market activity. The
 debate over the optimum development strategy will persist, and reform
 policies must continue to show gains to stave off conservative critics, but we
 believe the reformers have an extended mandate to make bold changes in
 China's economy. The conservative tone of major leadership speeches at
 the party conference indicates that more attention will be paid to the
 ideological dimension of the reforms, perhaps at the cost of some confusion
 within the economic bureaucracy and among foreign investors.

 The reduction in military influence achieved at the meetings puts control of
 the armed forces more securely in civilian hands than has been the case in
 decades. We believe Deng will seek to follow up these gains by making
 more changes in the military hierarchy, bringing forward a younger, more
 politically pliant high command better able to carry out effective military
 modernization.
 Finally, the September meetings set the stage for what will probably be
 Deng's last effort to resolve the succession issue. We expect Deng to press
 for his second-stage succession arrangements and make further prepara-
 tions for his retirement. We believe he will try to carry the remaining
 members of the old guard into retirement with him, probably before the
 scheduled 13th Party Congress in 1987.

 China's Party Conference:
 The Waning of the
 Ancien Regimen
 From 12 to 24 September, the Communist Party of
 China held an unprecedented series of meetings de-
 voted to resolving longstanding personnel problems
 and to laying down guidelines for the Seventh Five-
 Year Plan (1986-90). Altogether, there were four
 separate sessions:
 ? A Central Committee work conference, 12-16 Sep-
 tember, at which the general agenda for the meet-
 ings was probably presented and discussed in vari-
 ous forums.
 ? The Fourth Plenary Session of the 12th Central
 Committee on 16 September, which accepted 65
 resignations from the Central Committee and ap-
 proved a resolution to hold a national "Conference
 of Party Delegates."
 ? The Conference of Delegates itself met from 18 to
 23 September, approved the addition of 56 full and
 35 alternate members to the Central Committee,
 heard major speeches from the party's five top
 leaders, and adopted a resolution on guidelines for
 the coming five-year plan.
 25X1           ? The Fifth Plenum of the revised Central Committee
 convened on 24 September, elected a new Politburo
 and Secretariat, and approved personnel changes in
 other party bureaucracies. F_~
 The meetings are a major milestone in Deng Xiao-
 ping's decadelong struggle to restructure the party's
 leadership and change its method of decisionmaking.
 The September sessions must be viewed, however, not
 only in light of Deng's reconfiguration of the balance
 of political forces within the leadership, but also in
 terms of their long-run implications for the continuity
 and stability of the political and economic reforms
 Deng has set in motion.nn
 Since his return to power in 1977, Deng has had to
 work with a Politburo not of his own choosing, and
 one that did not fully support either his ambitions or
 his policy preferences. Composed of a melange of
 Maoist holdovers, aged soldier-politicians, old-line
 economic planners and administrators, and provincial
 bureaucrats who benefited from the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, the Politburo essentially stood between Deng and
 his larger goals of political and economic reform.
 Even after he achieved a position of dominance in
 1978, Deng constantly had to compromise, bargain,
 cajole, and maneuver the party old guard to attain his
 ends-a politically costly and time-consuming process
 that Deng mastered but realized he had to change.
 Since 1978, Deng has sought to ensure the continuity
 of his political and economic reforms by securing
 powerful positions for his chosen political heirs. Deng
 has been motivated all along by the traditional goal of
 Chinese statesmen, the search for national wealth and
 power. In our view, Deng well understood his poten-
 tially historic role and single-mindedly has forged his
 ideas into policy. The most pressing, and politically
 most volatile, issue was the personnel question: Deng
 and his allies had to find the appropriate lever to pry
 long-serving, undereducated, and ideologically rigid
 officials away from their posts. To do this, the
 .reformers required a corps of younger, better educat-
 ed officials who could take over the hidebound bu-
 reaucracy and bring it into line behind Deng's policy
 initiatives.
 Deng in effect has sought to change both the sources
 of party legitimacy and the class basis of the party
 along pragmatic lines. Under Mao, the party had
 grown accustomed to justifying its leading place on
 doctrinal grounds: it once was sufficient to argue that
 the Chinese Communist Party, as the keeper of
 ideological truths and backed by the coercive force of
 the state, must be followed. Deng and his supporters

 The persistence of the old guard has been Deng's
 most powerful obstacle. Although their influence
 does not appear to have been exercised in a concerted
 way-that is, they never discernibly acted in league
 to block Deng-each prominent party conservative
 has been associated with a particular target of the
 reformers and presumably has provided support to
 those who battled reform at lower levels: Chen Yun
 and Li Xiannian with the Stalinist planning bureau-
 cracy, Peng Zhen with the public security and legal
 apparatus, Deng Liqun and Hu Qiaomu with the
 propagandists and professional party workers, Ye
 Jianying and other senior soldiers with old-line
 commissars and commanders within the tradition-
 steeped military. Seldom initiators of policy pro-
 grams themselves, old-guard leaders seemed more
 concerned to ensure that reforms never got to the
 point of negating certain important "revolutionary"
 concerns, such as party spirit, self-sacrifice, central
 control, social order, or the party's leading role.
 Old-guard support extends deep into China's bureau-
 cracy, where personal interests have always played a
 larger role. To a considerable extent, Deng created
 the problem by rehabilitating hosts of local officials
 deposed during the Cultural Revolution. Initially
 part of Deng 's solution to the problem of Maoist
 policies, they became part of the problem: once
 rehabilitated, they felt entitled to "lifetime tenure, "
 and resisted reformist calls to promote younger,
 better educated leaders. They also refused to imple-
 ment reform measures they could not understand or
 feared would be quickly overturned if the political
 line changed.
 Within the state bureaucracy, Stalinist planners
 found the new policies unpalatable. Motivated, in our
 view, by fears for their job security, and limited by
 ideology and narrow experience, they insisted that
 Deng's policies courted economic disaster. Used to
 administering a command economy and society and
 to solving problems by slapping on additional con-
 trols, they saw little virtue in the relaxation of
 restraints and harped instead on how things could
 fall apart without strict adherence to a comprehen-
 sive blueprint that all could see and judge in advance.
 Political and ideological cadres at all levels of the
 party also saw their positions jeopardized by Deng 's
 emphasis on technical competence, managerial abili-
 ty, and pragmatism in decisionmaking. First in the
 countryside, and later in the urban centers, 'political
 workers" under the Deng-Hu regime found them-
 selves with less and less to do and were continually
 buffeted by reform, rectification, and the threat of
 replacement. As reformers pronounced with increas-
 ing frequency that government and economic admin-
 istration should be freed from the interference of
 party nonspecialists, political functionaries seized
 upon episodes like the "spiritual pollution" drive of
 1983 as opportunities to reassert their authority and
 discredit the reforms.F___1
 Finally, the middle and upper ranks of the Chinese
 military have long been a concern of Deng and his
 political allies. Although the senior soldier-
 politicians have generally gone along with Deng's
 policies, several have never been comfortable with Hu
 Yaobang's outspokenness and his often strident advo-
 cacy of reform. In our view, the list of the officers'
 concerns was led by career anxieties-having come to
 expect lifetime tenure in service, Deng placed them
 under increasing pressure to retire in favor of younger
 commanders and commissars.)

 recognized that, in the aftermath of a long train of
 policy debacles, the party's standing had plummeted,
 and that, to avoid a situation comparable to that of
 the Polish party, it must demonstrate, through exper-
 tise, its ability to rule. The reformers proposed to turn
 the country over to the experts and to disentangle
 politics from routine administration. For many party
 The policy views of Deng and his coterie of young
 reformers were also deeply disturbing to the party's
 old guard (see inset). To many, Deng's policies of
 promoting material incentives, encouraging peasants
 to seek profits and "get rich," loosening social con-
 trols, and opening China to Western influences were
 prescriptions for disaster and called into question the
 party's commitment to socialism. As Deng steadily
 progressed in implementing economic reform policies,
 the tension between socialist values and pragmatic
 economics came into sharper focus.F_~
 The battle has been waged on an almost annual basis
 during the Deng era, and in each case the old guard-
 fighting against what its leaders perceived as the
 waning of the Communist vision of the future-made
 a stand and lost. Although the pragmatic politicians
 generally won the issue-related battles, they were not
 able to end the war, because the old guard maintained
 its strong position in the leadership.
 Thus, when Beijing announced at the Third Plenum in
 October 1984 that an extraordinary conference of
 party delegates would convene to "readjust" the
 Central Committee, Politburo, and Secretariat, it was
 widely recognized within the leadership that the
 conference could well be "the last battle." That is
 what made the stakes so high.
 25X1                    the leadup to the September sessions
 was marked by intermittent tension and often heated
 exchanges within the top party leadership. The Octo-
 ber 1984 decision to hold an extraordinary conference
 put the entire party on notice that Deng intended to
 pack the top party organs with younger supporters
 and would use the rejuvenated leadership to endorse
 an effective follow-on to the radical reform prescrip-
 tions of the October plenary session. A comprehensive
 personnel overhaul in the provinces, economic prob-
 lems, official corruption, and strains within the Polit-
 buro added to the pressure of the impending confer-
 ence. F   I

 To set the stage for the conference, the reformers
 embarked upon a wave of leadership reorganization.

 nounced that 40 percent of all managers and some 70
 percent of party committee personnel in China's key
 enterprises did not pass muster and would be replaced
 by the end of 1985. In the spring of 1985, Hu
 Yaobang told foreign reporters that Beijing would
 complete by midsummer the replacement-begun in
 1983-of approximately 70 percent of the top central
 and provincial leaders. Between April and August, 23
 new party and government chiefs were appointed in
 16 provinces, fulfilling Hu's prediction. Hu had also
 noted that 900,000 officials had retired through April
 and that, by yearend, he expected some 1.1 million
 more to do so. Finally, Hu publicly disclosed in April,
 while on tour in New Zealand, that the Army planned
 to reduce its ranks by some 1 million men by the end
 of 1986.
 Economic Woes
 While pressing forward aggressively on personnel
 questions, however, the reformers were facing mount-
 ing economic difficulties. In his work report to the
 March 1985 session of the National People's Congress
 (NPC), Zhao Ziyang somberly conceded that prob-
 lems in implementing the October party decision on
 urban reform, although anticipated, had been surpris-
 ingly severe. He acknowledged that inflation, rapidly
 declining foreign exchange reserves, overextension of
 rural credit, and excessive investment in capital con-
 struction late last year required abrupt corrective
 measures.n
 Official Corruption
 By connecting reports of increasing official corruption
 to the expansion of economic reform, conservatives
 further strengthened their critique of Deng's policies.
 Although the reformers had initiated a crackdown on
 economic criminals in October, too many enterprising
 spirits saw opportunities for windfall profits. Begin-

 Succession has posed a perennial problem for China's
 Communist leaders. Mao Zedong repeatedly at-
 tempted to establish a stable line of political heirs,
 only to reconsider and undo his work in every case
 but one. When Mao died in 1976, the question of his
 immediate successor was finally resolved when Hua
 Guofeng, a darkhorse, added the post of party chair-
 man to the premiership he assumed upon Zhou
 Enlai's death. Hua, of course, was to fare little better
 than Mao's earlier appointees and followed them into
 political oblivion. F__-]
 Sinking Hua, Raising Hu. By the time of the land-
 mark Third Plenum of the 11th' Central Committee
 in December 1978, Deng Xiaoping's succession plan
 consisted of two parts: dislodging Hua and establish-
 ing the leadership credentials of Hu Yaobang. The
 careers of Deng and Hu have been closely entwined,
 with Deng consistently exercising a careful steward-
 ship over his protege's rise (Hu was named to the
 Politburo at the Third Plenum). Deng 's progress
 against Hua, and his parallel effort in favor of Hu,
 can be seen in a series of steps taken between 1980
 and 1982:
 ? February 1980: A plenary session of the Central
 Committee named Hu General Secretary and rees-
 tablished the party Secretariat, which took over
 day-to-day party affairs from Hua and the
 Politburo.
 ? September 1980: Zhao Ziyang replaced Hua as
 premier at a plenary session of the National Peo-
 ple's Congress, a move that, according to Western
 media sources, had been secretly announced to
 party members several months earlier.
 ? December 1980: Following a series of high-level
 meetings, a specially convened party work confer-
 ence endorsed Deng 's choice of Hu as party chair-
 man and Deng himself as head of the party Mili-
 tary Commission. Publicly, however, Hua
 continued to hold both titles.
 ? June 1981: A plenum of the Central Committee
 formally demoted Hua to last-ranking member of
 the seven-man Politburo Standing Committee, and
 designated Hu party chief and Deng chairman of
 the Military Commission.
 ? September 1982: The 12th Party Congress demoted
 Hua to mere member of the Central Committee, a
 position he continues to occupy. The position of
 party chairman was abolished in favor of party
 general secretary, which Hu assumed. F__]
 Enter the "Third Echelon. "In the spring of 1982,
 Deng and his allies began a series of organizational
 reforms within the party, government, and military
 that represented the first concerted assault on the
 founding gerontocracy that had monopolized the top
 posts. Deng and Hu began to tout the goal of creating
 a generation of younger, better educated, politically
 reliable successors, which in 1983 they ultimately
 labeled China's third echelon. (Thefrst echelon
 consisted of older leaders like Deng who were no
 longer physically capable of working long hours but
 nevertheless remained the source of broad policy
 guidelines. The second echelon-relatively younger,
 more vigorous men like Hu and Zhao-were the
 main executors of policy.) Bureaucratic reform was
 pressed down through the provincial level in 1983,
 and in 1984 the first stage of party rectification lent
 added force to the organizational effort.
 The turnover in ministerial- and provincial-level offi-
 cials provided graphic evidence of progress in bureau-
 cratic rejuvenation. Of 40 ministries and state com-
 missions, 35 had new ministers by the end of 1983.
 Another wave of changes was in place by 1985, and 15
 ministries reshuffled in 1981-83 again received new,
 generally younger and better educated leaders. Simi-
 lar changes occurred in the party bureaucracy. In

 Secret
 China's 29 provincial-level administrations, Deng and
 company completed a virtual total turnover of party
 secretaries, governors, and department chiefs by mid-
 1985. The overwhelming majority of the new officials
 were third-echelon leaders in their forties and fifties.
 Progress in the military was slower in coming but
 similarly sweeping when it arrived. A meeting of the
 party Military Commission in May-June 1985 pub-
 licly confirmed a million-man demobilization and
 began the process of mustering out thousands of
 superannuated or under qualified officers, merging 11
 military regions into seven, and promoting a host of
 third-echelon officers who for years had been denied
 headroom by their elderly predecessors.F__-]
 A New Succession Package. Since the December 1978
 plenum, when Hu was named a member and Zhao
 Ziyang an alternate member of the Politburo, Deng's
 succession plans entailed passing party primacy to
 Hu and state authority to Zhao. In the early 1980s,
 Deng himself had often stated that he hoped to retire
 by 1985. As China's third-echelon leadership rose in
 prominence, however, we believe Deng recognized that
 a Hu-Zhao leadership would itself be only transition-
 al and that the logic of establishing a third echelon
 had to be extended to the topmost leadership. Conse-
 quently, when Hu Qili was brought into the Secretar-
 iat at the 12th Party Congress in September 1982, he
 was widely spoken of as Hu Yaobang's successor.
 Similarly, when Li Peng and Tian Jiyun were made
 vice premiers in June 1983, they automatically be-
 came favorites to succeed Zhao as premier, with Li
 conceded the inside track due to his superior party
 credentials.
 In the spring of 1985, rumors of a "third-echelon
 succession" began circulating in Beijing and Hong

 in turn would be replaced as general secretary by Hu
 Kong.
 Qili. On the state side, Li Xiannian was reported
 ready to retire as president in favor of Zhao, and Li
 Peng would be promoted to premier.
 Although the September sessions produced no public
 declaration on the leadership plan, the shuffle was
 probably discussed and perhaps ratified for imple-
 mentation at a convenient future date. As reported,
 the proposed plan advances reform goals in several
 important ways:
 ? It puts in place a leadership group committed to
 reform and young enough to be able to see plans
 through, and does so while Deng is still healthy and
 powerful enough to oversee its consolidation of
 power.
 ? It lessens the likelihood of a messy power struggle
 over succession to Hu Yaobang.
 ? It helps establish the principle of limited tenure in
 office.
 ? It eases conservative concerns about Hu Yaobang,
 who has been a lightning rod for antireform criti-
 cism and who has often alienated members of his
 own reform coalition by his impulsive actions.
 ? It advances important institutional changes
 wrought by Deng, particularly civilian control of
 the military.
 ? It furthers Deng 's efforts to clearly separate party
 and government authority and prevent one individ-
 ual from acquiring too much power. F__1

 Why a Conference of Delegates?
 The party constitution empowers party congresses,
 held every five years, to name the Central Committee
 and plenary sessions of the Central Committee to
 elect the Politburo, Secretariat, and Military Com-
 mission. Procedurally, there seemed no pressing need
 to resort to the extraordinary formality of a national
 "conference. " The plenary sessions alone could have
 endorsed the Politburo and Secretariat changes and
 accepted the resignations of Central Committee mem-
 bers. As in the past, vacancies among the full mem-
 bers of the Central Committee could have been filled
 from the list of alternates.
 The only previous national party delegates conference
 was held in 1955, and the parallels between 1955 and
 1985 are instructive. The earlier session also dis-
 cussed the five-year plan as well as sensitive person-
 nel questions involving "adjustments" to the Central
 Committee and Politburo-namely, the purge of the
 "Gao Gang-Rao Shushi antiparty clique"-and fea-
 tured then party Secretary General Deng Xiaoping in
 a starring role (as Mao Zedong's spokesman in the
 battle against Gao and Rao).n
 In our view, Deng's advanced age and the desire of his
 political heirs to consolidate the succession before his
 death were the strongest motivations for convening a
 spring of 1985, Beijing had to mount a campaign to
 eradicate so-called unhealthy tendencies-the in-
 volvement of officials in such activities as exploiting
 their status for profit, purveying obscene videotapes
 and magazines, and black-market-currency specula-
 tion. Much of the criticism focused on the Special
 Economic Zones, and the Shenzhen zone opposite
 Hong Kong in particular, which not only had pro-
 duced disappointing economic results after heavy
 investment but had also become the locus of a wide
 variety of corrupt practices.
 Leaders Under Fire
 The reform group, and especially Zhao and Vice
 Premier Tian Jiyun, reportedly drew fire from party
 conservatives for the economic setbacks.
 called for Zhao's resignation.
 special conference this year. Although Deng needed
 only a Central Committee plenum to secure the
 changes he needed on the Politburo and Secretariat,
 he could not touch the Central Committee itself
 without convening a party congress. The next party
 congress was scheduledfor 1987, and Deng may have
 reasoned he could not afford to wait that long to
 work his desired personnel changes. Moreover, for
 institutional reasons, Deng almost certainly wanted
 to preserve the timetable and, for the first time in
 party history, bring the congress in on schedule.
 Article 12 of the party constitution permits the
 convocation of special conferences "to discuss and
 decide upon major problems that require timely
 resolution." The overhaul of the Central Committee,
 which would bring Deng 's succession arrangements
 close to completion, certainly posed a "major prob-
 lem."Furthermore, the lack of restrictions on who
 may attend a special conference-as opposed to a
 formal party congress, which must "elect" delegates
 through specified procedures permitted the reform-
 ist Secretariat to select some 300 "at large" dele-
 gates, thereby guaranteeing Deng majority support at
 the meeting.F__-]

 Heated Exchanges
 In this charged political atmosphere, the leadership
 began convening preparatory meetings to finalize the
 agenda of the September conference. From mid-July
 to early August the top leaders retired to the resort
 city of Beidaihe to caucus on readjusting the party's
 upper echelon. Meetings on the five-year-plan guide-
 lines were simultaneously under way at several loca-
 tions throughout China.F--]
 Despite the heightened tensions, the summer prepara-
 tory sessions completed their work of choosing Cen-
 tral Committee retirees and replacements, and Deng
 brought the conference in on schedule. In his speech
 to the conference, Hu Yaobang disclosed that he

 The Seventh Five-Year-Plan proposal strongly reaf-
 firms the leadership's commitment to comprehensive
 economic reform, while calling for containment of
 currently overextended capital investment, and urg-
 ing an end to the thorny problems associated with
 excessively high growth rates. According to the pro-
 posal, the plan's three primary goals-in descending
 order of importance-are to lay the groundwork for
 comprehensive economic reform, continue the devel-
 opment of China's woefully inadequate economic
 infrastructure, and improve living standards. The
 proposal does not provide a detailed- abstract of the
 plan, but instead outlines a series of reform-oriented
 economic policies to be implemented during the plan
 period (1986-90). The Seventh Five-Year Plan itself
 will be formally, approved next-spring by the National
 People's Congress. n
 By making economic reform its major goal, the
 Seventh Five-Year-Plan proposal is an unprecedented
 Chinese economic planning document. The proposal
 urges the increasing adoption of economic levers and
 the use of "guidance planning" (a new term used by
 Chinese economic policy makers to denote an infor-
 mal dialogue between government and producer, es-
 tablishing flexible and probably nonbinding output
 targets) to replace much of the traditional "manda-
 tory "planning process. The document conveys the
 distinct message that the Chinese leadership is now
 prepared to apply the principles of economic reform
 to virtually every sector of the economy. Specific
 reforms underscored in the proposal include:
 ? Expanding enterprise decisionmaking powers and
 relaxing the state's control over their economic
 functions.
 ? Making greater use of such economic levers as
 monetary and fiscal policy and strengthening the
 nation's banking, auditing, and statistical systems.
 ? Completing price reform by 1990, the last year of
 the plan period.
 ? Continuing China's "open policy" of expanding
 foreign trade, promoting increased foreign invest-
 ment in the special economic zones, and making
 greater use of foreign borrowed funds.
 ? Creating a social safety net to minimize reform-
 related personal hardship. F-]
 China's reformist policy of opening to the outside
 world will, according to the proposal, remain a key
 policy objective. The proposal emphasizes that ex-
 ports are to have priority over imports, targeting
 exports to grow by 50 percent during the plan period
 and imports by 40 percent. During the 1986-90
 period,, Beijing will try to strike a delicate-and, thus
 far elusive-balance between central control over and
 decentralization of foreign trade decision making
 authority. Economic levers such as pricing, exchange
 rates, and customs duties, the proposal states, are to
 be expanded; and, as management skills improve in
 local enterprises, increasing power is to be delegated
 gradually by Beijing to the localities.n
 The few specific growth targets referred to in the
 proposal are not ambitious. Overall economic growth
 is planned to increase at a 7 -percent average annual
 rate, with agricultural output growing by 6 percent
 and industrial production by 7 percent. The planned
 average annual growth rates for the six other indus-
 trial commodities mentioned in the proposal range
 from 2.5 to 6 percent. Judging from the strong
 performance of the Chinese economy during the Sixth
 Five-Year Plan (1981-85), Beijing will have little
 difficulty meeting these new output targets. Similar-
 ly, we believe that the proposal's call for raising per
 capita personal consumption by an average yearly
 rate of 4 to 5 percent is conservative.

 himself had headed the blue-ribbon search commit-

 Committee members. The communique of the Fifth
 Plenum noted that the Politburo Standing Committee
 had proposed the new Politburo and Secretariat mem-
 bers, with the implication that the selections repre-
 sented specific preferences of each of the Standing
 Committee members rather than a broader reflection
 25X1           of party opinion. The nominations then went before
 the Politburo and Secretariat for "repeated delibera-
 tion."
 With the results foreordained, the September meet-
 ings convened to rubberstamp the leadership
 decisions:
 ? On 12 September, delegates assembled in Beijing
 for four days of preliminary caucuses, where pre-
 sumably they received and discussed the results of
 the Beidaihe conferences.
 ? The Central Committee that had been elected in
 1982 met for the last time on 16 September in the
 Fourth Plenum. According to the communique is-
 sued after the one-day session, the Fourth Plenum:
 - Agreed to convene the party conference of
 delegates on 18 September.
 Discussed and "adopted in principle" a party
 proposal on the Seventh Five-Year Plan and
 agreed to submit it to the impending conference
 (see the inset on the plan proposal).

 Inspection Commission permanent secretary Wang Heshou. The
 Foreign Policy: Not on the September Agenda
 Not surprisingly, given the heavy domestic political
 content of the September meetings, foreign policy
 questions received very little attention. Only Li
 Xiannian spoke at any length on foreign policy, and
 he invoked largely standard themes of opposition to
 hegemonism, reunification with Taiwan, and opening
 to the outside world. In our view, Chinese foreign
 policy has been in a quiescent phase, not only because
 the leadership was devoting more attention to inter-
 nal politics, but also because Deng is relatively
 content with the overall direction and achievements
 of his foreign policy.
 ? From 18 to 23 September, nearly 1,000 delegates-
 including the members and alternates of the Central
 Committee, members of the Central Advisory and
 Discipline Inspection Commissions, and more than
 300 at-large delegates chosen by the Secretariat-
 assembled for the National Conference of Party
 Delegates. The conference:
 - Heard speeches by all five members of the
 Politburo Standing Committee: (in order of
 their appearance) Hu, Zhao, Deng, Chen Yun,
 and Li Xiannian (see appendix A for highlights).
 - Adopted the party proposal on the five-year
 plan.

 the Central Advisory Commission, and 31
 members to the Discipline Inspection

 the 12th Central Committee. The plenum:

 The Central Committee is not a "working body" in
 any real sense. Party convention decrees that all
 party decisions be issued in the name of the Central
 Committee, and the party bureaucracy invariably is
 termed the "organs under the Central Committee. "
 When the committee actually convenes, usually once
 a year, it formally constitutes China's highest deci-
 sionmaking body. At all other times, however, the
 power of the Central Committee devolves upon the
 Politburo, which itself meets only upon the invitation
 of the General Secretary, Hu Yaobang. When the
 Politburo is out of session, its Standing Committee-
 also convened by the General Secretary-makes the
 decisions that are the basis of Chinese policy. Unless
 the decisions of the Standing Committee are placed
 before the Politburo for additional deliberation, the
 committee's guidelines are transmitted directly to the
 Secretariat-again, presided over by the General
 Secretary for action.
 If the Central Committee is not a true legislative
 forum, why did the reformers press for its overhaul?
 ? Central Committee composition represents the bal-
 ance of political forces at a given point and simulta-
 neously serves as the pool from which party; state,

 The Central Committee 2
 The new appointments to the Central Committee
 continue the trend toward younger, better educated
 ' The calculations below are based on a 210-member Central
 Committee. We cannot identify organizational affiliations for four
 alternate members, however, and therefore have based our calcula-
 tions on the 129 known of the 133 total Central Committee
 and military leaders will be drawn. When the
 committee is overhauled, the party is sending a
 powerful signal of political trends to lower levels.
 ? Central Committee actions are understood by party
 members as the most authoritative expressions of
 party consensus. Membership confers admission to
 the party elite and, perhaps most important, grants
 access to the party bureaucracy. With this access
 comes the institutional prerogative to state one's
 views during the preliminary stage of upper-level
 policy deliberations. As the Central Committee has
 become more broadly representative of the party's
 upper echelon, it has provided the party leadership
 with a better "sense of the party" and consequently
 has become more important in policymaking.
 ? Although issues are never decided on the basis of a
 Central Committee vote, such a procedure may
 conceivably be used in the future. (Deng hinted in
 1980 that he wanted to conduct party business on
 precisely that basis.) Should a question ever be put
 to a Central Committee test, the reformers must

 technocrats that began at the 1982 party congress.
 Approximately 19 percent of the 343-member body is
 made up of first-time members. According to Beijing,
 the 64 new members and alternates average 50 years
 of age, and three-quarters "have received higher
 education"-meaning a college degree or training at a
 technical school or military staff school (see appendix
 C for a listing of the new Central Committee mem-
 bers).
 Deng and his allies continue to recognize the prov-
 inces as a promising training ground for the new
 generation of leaders. By our count, at least 30 of the
 new appointees and 11 who were promoted- from
 alternate to full membership work in China's 29
 provincial-level jurisdictions. Provincial members (ex-
 cluding regional military representatives) now com-
 prise some 39 percent (132 members) of the total

 Central Committee, compared with the central party
 and government's 34 percent (116 members). All 10 of
 the provincial secretaries appointed this year who
 were not already full members gained that status, as
 did nine new provincial governors. Four more gover-
 nors made the alternate rolls.
 The significant decline in military representation on
 the Central Committee is evidence of Deng's progress
 in easing the soldiers out of important political posi-
 tions. Although 13 officers were named to the com-
 mittee-nine full and four alternate members-their
 numbers are more than offset by 26 military retirees,
 cutting the Army representation from 22 percent to
 approximately 16 percent (56 members). Significant-
 ly, of the 13 new members, 10 are commanders or
 military technocrats and only three are political offi-
 cers, a further boost to the prestige of professional
 fighters, who in the past have often been outranked in
 party standing by commissars within their units.
 Political compromises are apparent in the composition
 of the Central Committee. According to our analysis
 of the 210 full members, some 41 are anomalous
 holdovers-officials without functional responsibil-
 ities who could have retired but did not. The greatest
 number of these members, 18, are former provincial
 officials. Nine are former ministers or demoted Polit-
 buro members who hold honorary posts on the Na-
 tional People's Congress Standing Committee. Six are
 former regional military commanders. F--]
 The "Leading Organs"
 Politburo. We believe that the departure of 10 Polit-
 buro members-eight of whom were in their seventies
 or eighties-and the addition of six younger members
 presages the return of that body to a more active
 policymaking role. Deng had earlier attempted to
 bypass opposition on the Politburo by making the
 Secretariat increasingly responsible for policy formu-
 lation, and in 1982 Deng may have sought to elimi-
 nate the Politburo entirely from the party Constitu-
 tion. Streamlined to 20 members plus two alternates,
 the Politburo now seems a more credible deliberative
 body.F__-]
 Although the reorganized Politburo spans the entire
 spectrum of Chinese politics, in our analysis, the
 reform group now holds a slim but absolute majority
 (see the table). Such Deng stalwarts as Wan Li, Xi
 Zhongxun, and Fang Yi have been reinforced by the
 leading lights of the younger generation. Because the
 reformers face no cohesive, determined opposition
 bloc on the Politburo but rather a loose collection of
 conservatives, moderates, and swing votes, we judge
 their plurality to be stronger than the bare numbers
 indicate.
 The ranks of conservative party elders have been
 drastically thinned, but the most important players
 stayed on. Chen Yun and Peng Zhen remain to voice
 their reservations about the course of reform. We
 expect the propaganda czar Hu Qiaomu also to
 generally line up with the traditionalists, who proba-
 bly secured. his retention on the Politburo. Deng may
 also find some use for Hu-the party's leading theore-
 tician-in preparing acceptable Marxist justifications
 for his reforms.)
 We believe other members of the old guard have more
 or less thrown in their lot with Deng. The ailing Li
 Xiannian has evidently overcome his earlier reserva-
 tions, and since October 1984 has publicly supported
 the reforms. Yang Shangkun and Xi Zhongxun have
 long been considered loyal supporters of Deng, and
 have vigorously pushed reform and restructuring poli-
 cies. Army Chief of Staff Yang Dezhi owes his
 current prominence to Deng and has seldom departed
 from Deng's line, despite his age and conservative
 background.F--]
 Yu Qiuli, director of the Army's General Political
 Department, presents a question mark. Yu was Minis-
 ter in Charge of the State Planning Commission
 under Hua Guofeng and has been regarded as a
 lukewarm reformer. Yu was a compromise choice
 when he took over the military post in late 1982, and
 we believe that he does not see eye to eye with the
 reformers on all issues. Yu has strongly supported
 Deng's military professionalization program, however,
 and has brought the Army's propaganda apparatus
 into line behind Deng's policies. In the role of military
 personnel director-part of his functions as chief

 We see the promotion of Vice Premier Yao Yilin from
 alternate to full Politburo membership as a mixed
 blessing for the reformers. Although Yao has actively
 promoted China's economic reform program, he has
 been an associate of both Chen Yuri and Li Xiannian
 since the 1950s, when he worked in the finance and
 commerce sectors. His recent public comments criti-
 cal of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone lend
 further credence to our belief that he will serve as a
 voice for moderation in reform.)
 Deng seems to have yielded little ground in the
 Politburo in exchange for the promotion of five lead-
 ing members of China's "third echelon":
 ? Hu Qili is well known as Hu Yaobang's close
 associate, the presiding member of the Secretariat
 ? Qiao Shi, another Hu protege from the Communist
 Youth League, directed the party Organization
 Department during the sweeping 1984-85 reorgani-
 zation of the central and provincial party apparatus.
 His rise to the Politburo is almost certainly in part a
 reward for faithful services rendered. He was pro-
 moted to full membership on the Secretariat as well.
 ? The elevation of Foreign Minister Wu Xueyian, a
 third Hu crony, marks the first time since 1972 that
 the foreign minister has been on the Politburo. In
 our view, this reflects the increased attention ac-
 corded China's foreign affairs and accords Wu the
 same party standing as his Soviet counterpart.

 Hao Jianxiu, yet another Hu Yaobang protege and
 the only woman on the Secretariat, was promoted
 from alternate member. As a former model textile
 worker and Minister of Textile Industries, she may
 share some responsibility for China's light industrial
 sector. Otherwise, she has been associated with issues
 that the party generally regards as suitable for wom-
 en, such as birth control and youth work. F_~
 Wang Zhaoguo, at 44 the youngest member of the
 Secretariat, currently heads the office responsible for
 party documents and leadership protection. He joined
 the Central Committee in 1982 after having been
 "discovered" by Deng Xiaoping, whom Wang had
 impressed in a briefing. Wang is also a former
 Communist Youth League worker-he was CYL first
 secretary for two years-with ties to both Hu Yao-
 bang and Hu Qili. F---]
 Like Hu Qiaomu on the Politburo, Deng Liqun is a
 conservative whose reputation was sullied during the
 spiritual pollution episode, and he has continued to
 voice open criticism of the ideological inconsistency of
 reform policies.
 media reports predicted that Deng would be
 forced off the Secretariat at the September sessions,
 and the fact that he survives suggests to us that Chen
 Yuri protected him. Nonetheless, Deng alone among
 Secretariat members has no substantive bureaucratic
 authority, having been removed in July as head of the
 Propaganda Department. F__1
 In our analysis, Chen Pixian plus two concurrent
 Politburo members, Yu Qili and the newly appointed
 Li Peng, straddle the fence between the reformers and
 Deng Liqun. Chen has presided over the internal
 security apparatus since 1982, but now apparently has
 been supplanted by or shares that responsibility with
 Qiao Shi, who in July was identified as secretary of
 the party's Political and Legal Commission. Chen has
 generally been a presumed supporter of Deng Xiao-

 that Chen had fallen out with Deng and was slated for
 retirement. Although he remains on the Secretariat,
 his relatively low ranking on that body in our view
 indicates that he too was barely protected from
 Deng's Achievements
 In our view, Deng gained most of what he had set out
 to accomplish. The September party meetings were
 the most impressive display to date of Deng's political
 facility and must also be considered a victory for the
 organizers, Hu Yaobang and Hu Qili. Looking back,
 we are struck by the persistent and methodical ap-
 proach of the reformers, who since 1980 have built on
 each incremental gain to win additional advantages:
 first by creating a proreform Secretariat, then moving
 through a series of central party and government
 changes paving the way for provincial personnel
 shifts, and finally moving back to the center to fill the
 Central Committee with newly appointed national
 and provincial officials. F__1
 Reformist Consolidation. We believe the balance of
 party power now rests with the reformers, and it
 would be exceedingly difficult for a small group of
 leaders to upset Deng's accomplishments. Under pre-
 sent institutional arrangements, to reverse the refor-
 mers' advantage the conservatives would have to
 follow the path Deng laid out: take control of the
 Standing Committee, put a new Politburo and Secre-
 tariat into place, and dismantle both the policies and
 the broad leadership net that has been built over the
 past three years. Once Deng is gone, it is doubtful
 whether there would be any old guard leader possess-
 ing the prestige, political power, and personal stamina
 to see those changes through.' F__-]
 ' The situation is not, as some may argue, analogous to the
 circumstances following the Ninth Party Congress in 1969, the
 highwater mark of the fleeting leftist/military dominance of China.
 Unlike the trends represented at the Ninth Party Congress, Deng's
 changes have been gradual, not convulsive, and have been broadly
 supported from within the party.F__1

 A Significantly Weakened Old Guard. The unprece-
 dented retirement of a quarter of the Central Com-
 mittee is a key event in Deng's effort to rejuvenate the
 party leadership, an important precedent that reform-
 ers can point to in encouraging others to step down.
 The number of Politburo leaders who most consistent-
 ly have resisted Deng in recent years is reduced, in
 our view, to two-Chen Yun and Peng Zhen (even
 party propagandist Hu Qiaomu, lately a critic of some
 aspects of the reform program, is a longtime Deng
 associate). Moreover, Deng succeeded in preventing
 Peng Zhen from replacing Ye Jianying on the Stand-
 ing Committee. F_~
 Military Reform. The waning of the old guard is
 symbolized by the departure of seven senior soldier-
 politicians from the Politburo-including the ailing
 octogenarians Ye Jianying, Nie Rongzhen, and Xu
 Xiangqian, former chief commissar Wei Guoqing,
 and former Shenyang Military Region Commander
 Li Desheng. This and the substantial reduction of
 military representatives on the Central Committee
 fulfill Deng's intention to distance the military from
 the the center of political power and lay a foundation
 for a more professional military establishment. F
 Party Rejuvenation. As a result of the massive retire-
 ment, the reform triumvirate of Deng, Hu, and Zhao
 has been able to cast the Central Committee in a
 reformist image. The Central Committee's "class of
 1985"-younger, better educated, and proreform-
 symbolizes the changing official culture and the
 movement within the party from a backward-looking
 traditionalism toward a more pragmatic, technocratic
 future. F-1
 Proteges Promoted. The leading reformers placed
 proteges on both the Politburo and the Secretariat.
 Hu Yaobang put three on each body and Zhao
 Ziyang one.F_~
 Economic Reform. Despite the widely publicized eco-
 nomic difficulties of the past year, the Central Com-
 mittee endorsed a new five-year-plan proposal that
 constitutes a ringing endorsement of the open-door
 policy and expansion of market style reforms, while
 yielding virtually nothing to Deng's critics.F__-]
 What Deng Did Not Get
 We believe that Deng's gains at the conference were
 not won without cost. There are several areas where
 Deng clearly was forced to compromise with more
 conservative elements of the party. Generally, his
 concessions leave his programs intact, but provide
 ample opportunities for leaders with differing views to
 continue to challenge the reforms on pragmatic and
 ideological grounds.=
 Remaining Critics. In our view, Deng intended nei-
 ther to stifle nor to eliminate his opposition. As
 though to balance his progress toward party rejuvena-
 tion, the generational pecking order remains largely
 intact within the Politburo and, most important,
 within its Standing Committee, the dominance of
 which was confirmed in September. Five octogenari-
 ans continue to sit on the Politburo, and three on the
 Standing Committee. Two of the conservative old
 guard-Chen Yun and Peng Zhen-almost certainly
 will fill the role of Deng's "revolutionary conscience,"
 unable perhaps to reverse the present course of policy
 but surely able to affect the manner in which the
 reforms are presented and ultimately implemented.

 were promoted. Younger leaders such as the new
 heads of the Propaganda and Organizations Depart-
 ments did not even attain alternate-member status on
 the Secretariat. It also is a measure of continuing
 conservative strength, as well as Deng's talent for
 compromise, that such erstwhile critics of reform as
 Hu Qiaomu and Deng Liqun held their seats.F_~
 Succession. Although it is unclear whether Deng won
 endorsement of his overall succession package at the
 September meetings,
 People's Congress.
 Ithe sessions proba-
 bly discussed the shuffle, and may have endorsed it as
 a future measure.' The planned party shifts-Deng to

 may await a future plenary session or even the 1987
 party congress for public announcement. The pro-
 posed state shifts, which include the retirement of Li
 Xiannian as President of the People's Republic, Zhao
 Ziyang's assumption of the presidency, and Vice
 Premier Li Peng's promotion to Premier, may occur,
 as early as next spring's session of the National

 eng in-
 tended to hand over the Military Commission chair-
 manship to Hu Yaobang by the fall of 1985. Although
 the September meetings would have been the most
 convenient venue for the transfer, it did not take
 place. Deng's apparent decision to wait for a better
 time to further adjust the military leadership suggests
 that he remains concerned over the senior officers'
 loyalty to reform. He also may have calculated that
 foisting Hu, still viewed by some senior soldiers as
 ' At least twice in the recent past, the party has done precisely that:
 both cases involved Hua Guofeng. The decision to replace Hua as
 premier in 1980 was disseminated in party channels months before
 the event, and, in December of that year, a party work conference
 endorsed Hua's demotion six months before Hu and Deng formally
 assumed his party and military commission chairmanships.F_~

 alienate some senior soldiers. We believe that Deng
 intends to take the final step in arranging his succes-
 sion by transferring military authority, thereby assur-
 ing that someone who shares his views is in charge of
 the military when he dies.F__-]
 Ideological Constraints. Deng's injunction to the
 party conference to bone up on the Marxist classics as
 a necessary antecedent to successful reform was
 prompted, in our view, by a conservative backlash
 against the recent tendency to disparage orthodox
 Marxism. The reformist critique of Marxism reached
 a high in a Renmin Ribao commentary of 7 December
 1984, which declared that "Marxism cannot solve our
 problems" (it was subsequently amended to read
 ". . . all our problems"). F
 When in the past Deng has nodded to his putative
 opposition by expressing conservative views-as in the
 spiritual pollution episode-his views have been mis-
 represented as criticism, and the reform program has
 suffered setbacks. It seems likely that party conserva-
 tives again will seize on Deng's orthodox themes to
 justify their own agenda and may press for a crack-
 down on "liberal" writers and artists or for a mini-
 campaign to eliminate "bourgeois" economic prac-
 tices. Although such swings tend to be short lived,

 they create an atmosphere of intolerance for foreign
 goods and ideas and slow reform momentum.=
 Longer Term Outcomes:
 Old Cleavages Reexamined
 In our judgment, the September meetings did more
 than advance the reform program and readjust the
 topmost leadership. The outcomes reflected potential-
 ly much larger changes in China that, if followed
 through, may alter how problems are approached and
 power is exercised. The ancien regime is giving way to
 a new generation of leaders who have a different
 concept of the roles of the party and military, and a
 more innovative-albeit still highly bureaucratic-
 approach to economic development. Deng has made a
 strong start, but these differences will continue to
 affect politics as long as the old guard retains some
 influence.)
 The Generation Gap
 All of the party's aged officials have regularly and
 routinely endorsed the policy of leadership rejuvena-
 tion, but most have balked when confronted with the
 prospect of actually retiring. In our view, however, the
 September meetings mark a major turning point in
 the generational transfer of power. Although not
 denying the considerable remaining influence of the
 party's old guard, little now bars the way to consolida-
 tion by the successors on the Politburo and
 Secretariat.
 The new Central Committee establishes what in fact
 is a shift in the social basis of the party leadership.
 The early revolutionary leadership consisted mainly of
 urban intellectuals and peasant revolutionaries who
 remained in power through the first three decades of
 Communist rule. The reconstituted Central Commit-
 tee heralds the ascendancy of the polytechnic institute
 graduates. Deng popularized the idea that policies
 should be judged by practical results, not necessarily
 by ideological soundness. By implication, he has asked
 that the new leaders he has elevated be similarly
 judged. In our view, the early results have been
 favorable for the reformers, and there appears to be a
 broad base of support for Deng's program and the
 new leaders both within the party and among the
 populace. F_~
 Yet, no single event can patch over the substantial
 breach between the new and old in China. The
 passing political generation worked under difficult
 circumstances to establish a set of institutions they
 believed in, and many resent the message of reform-
 that those institutions were seriously flawed. The
 reformers must demonstrate that new institutions-
 such as the retirement program, the separation of
 party from government and economic work, and the
 nationalization of the Army-can work and at the
 same time retain distinctively Chinese Communist
 characteristics.
 In our view, Deng has co-opted a large body of
 opinion by redefining what those Chinese characteris-
 tics are-namely, an innovative socialism not
 hemmed in by doctrinal concerns, able to tap the
 technical superiorities of capitalist economies, but
 maintaining the decisive authority of the party in all
 political matters. Moreover, Deng gambled that mate-
 rial well-being in retirement, plus a generous distribu-
 tion of honorary posts, would satisfy most of the
 oldtimers. Events suggest that he calculated correctly.
 Reformers Versus Planners
 Since the earliest stages of reform, China's economic
 policy makers have been sharply divided into two
 camps: those who championed the orthodox Stalinist
 approach of tight central planning and macroeconom-
 ic control by administrative command; and advocates
 of decentralization, greater reliance on market forces
 to determine production, and macroeconomic control
 through such policy levers as taxation, interest rates,
 and floating prices. The new leadership mix favors the
 reformers, who heavily outnumber the oldline plan-
 ners on both the Politburo and the Secretariat. In a
 clear signal to advocates of central planning, the
 planning minister was left off the Politburo, recon-
 firming a decision in 1983 that for the first time left
 the planning chief off the Chinese Politburo.'F
 6 In 1983, Yao Yilin, then a Politburo alternate, was relieved as
 Minister-in-Charge of the State Planning Commission and his
 replacement was not promoted in party standing to the Politburo.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/03/01 : CIA-RDP86T00590R000300560002-0
 We believe the debate will continue, but the odds
 favor Deng and his allies: twice in the past year they
 have secured authoritative Central Committee en-
 dorsement of their reform agenda. Reformers will
 continue to tout China's improved economic perfor-
 mance, attributing it directly to policy changes like
 the greater role permitted market forces and entrepre-
 neurial energy, while simultaneously seeking to refine
 macroeconomic levers to maintain control. Devotees
 of more comprehensive planning remain in the top-
 most leadership, however-in particular, Chen Yun
 and Li Xiannian (neither of whom is closely involved
 in the detailed workings of the economy) and Yao
 Yilin, who probably is Chen's own chosen successor.
 Problems in policy implementation will inevitably
 occur, and traditional planners will seize on these
 difficulties as fresh evidence to support their advocacy
 of stricter controls over all economic activity. In our
 view, they will be fighting a rearguard action-
 attempting to slow the advance of reform without
 great hope of turning the program back. F___]
 The victories of the reformers in strategic planning
 must nevertheless be translated into battlefield gains:
 many of the reformers' policy proposals remain un-
 tested, and the changes they have promoted in eco-
 nomic institutions have yet to be consolidated. More-
 over, as the tentative remarks of Deng and Zhao
 demonstrated last spring, the reformers understand
 the need for caution: they are certain of their analysis
 of China's economic problems but are wary of the
 magnitude of their prescribed changes and the eco-
 nomic forces those changes may unleash. We believe
 they must compromise on their boldest experiments-
 such as the Special Economic Zones and wage and
 price decontrol-not only to resolve the problems that
 crop up, but also because they recognize that Chen
 Yun and like-minded officials will step up the political
 pressure if things go awry.F__-]
 Civilians Versus Soldiers
 The retirement of seven military representatives from
 the Politburo is significant as a symbol of the continu-
 ing clarification of political and military roles in
 China. Deng long ago decided to institutionalize the
 principle of restricted military participation in the
 highest leadership councils, and the September meet-
 ings are convincing evidence of his success. Civilian
 control of the military appears more secure now than
 at any other time. The only career soldiers remaining
 on the Politburo are the Chief of Staff, Yang Dezhi,
 and the Beijing Military Region Commander, Qin
 Jiwei, who is only an alternate. Other Politburo
 members who hold principally military jobs are Yang
 Shangkun, the presiding vice chairman of the Mili-
 tary Commission, and Yu Qiuli, chief of the General
 Political Department, both of whom must be consid-
 ered civilians in military uniform.
 We believe that Deng may again seek to establish the
 principle of a national, rather than a party, Army. In
 1982 he unsuccessfully attempted to nationalize the
 Army by creating a State Military Commission under
 the NPC to supplement the party Military Commis-
 sion. The state Commission was indeed established in
 the 1982 Constitution, and its leadership named-
 precisely the same leaders named to the party Mili-
 tary Commission at the 12th Party Congress-but it
 was never made operational. Evidently, the senior
 soldier-politicians were unwilling to give up their
 "glorious tradition" as the party's own army.)
 Deng has now drastically cut Army representation on
 the Politburo and erased it entirely from the Standing
 Committee. Moreover, the retirement from the Cen-
 tral Committee of the Minister of National Defense,
 the Commander of the Navy, and the Director of the
 General Logistics Department, plus many other pres-
 tigious military figures may presage another attempt
 to move the military out from under direct party
 command. By subordinating the military to the gov-
 ernment, Deng would be seeking to accomplish at
 least two things: redefining the relationship of the
 PLA to both the party and China, ending the special
 claims the military has been able to make by virtue of
 its historically close relationship with the party; and
 taking an additional step toward military profession-
 alism.)

 ? Although some senior soldier-politicians may still
 oppose Hu Yaobang's assumption of the Military
 Commission chairmanship, the reduction in military
 representation in the top party bodies should ease
 the way for Deng to pass that post to Hu.
 ? The resignation from the Central Committee of five
 top Military Commission officers suggests that a
 reorganization of the committee's leadership is like-
 ly soon. Deng will certainly take that opportunity to
 promote younger, better educated officers to the
 Army's core leadership. Ultimately, this may help
 25X1           clarify several aspects of China's defense policy-
 from defensive deployments to acquisition of foreign
 weapons-long muddled by the old soldiers' rever-
 ence for outdated Maoist concepts. F___]
 Finally, the reduction of military representation in the
 top party organizations, in our view, implies at least
 two additional developments that affect the party
 Military Commission:
 approved last year is still on track, but adjustments
 will continue to be made to counter inflation, overin-
 vestment in capital construction, revenue shortfalls,
 corruption, and the foreign trade imbalance. More-
 over, the leadership is likely to be more sensitive to the
 need to provide ideological justification for its policies,
 and will seek to ensure that all reforms are cloaked in
 the appropriate socialist garb, even if this creates
 confusion within China's trade bureaucracies and
 among foreign investors. F_~
 We believe Deng's achievements at the September
 meetings are best viewed as a confirmation of trends
 and policies he has initiated over the last 10 years,
 rather than as an immediate portent of new directions
 to be taken. The restructured leadership will be more
 energetic, flexible, and pragmatic than its predeces-
 sor, and in the long run it probably will be more
 willing to consider bold departures from socialist
 orthodoxy. Its actions will be tempered for some time,
 however, by the continued presence of powerful con-
 servative voices, specifically in the persons of Chen
 Yun and Peng Zhen, and by the need to consolidate
 and develop policies already undertaken.=
 The economy ranks high on the agenda. We expect
 the Chinese to continue their efforts to modernize the
 economy through a combination of socialist adminis-
 trative controls and free market demand management
 techniques. Deng's depiction of economic reforms as
 an "experiment" is apt, in that reformers have a set of
 goals, but not a detailed or set plan on how to achieve
 them. The five-year plan adopted at the meetings
 indicates strongly that the urban reform program
 Party rectification remains nominally high on the
 political agenda, but received remarkably little atten-
 tion during the party meetings. In fact, the extensive
 discussion in the conference speeches of official cor-
 ruption points to how ineffectual the rectification
 process has been at the middle and lower levels of the
 party. Deng alone among the meetings' main speakers
 referred to rectification as an appropriate means to
 deal with persistent problems in party work style, and
 a forum of the party's rectification commission held at
 the same time reflected his concerns. We expect that
 the issue will be brought to the fore again, in a
 concerted effort to cleanse the party of its wayward
 elements.F----]
 We expect Deng to continue to press for his second-
 stage succession package, and sooner rather than
 later. Hu Qili and Li Peng will play increasingly
 prominent roles in the leadership, preparatory to
 formally taking over leadership positions, perhaps
 next year. Hu Yaobang played a somewhat subdued
 role at the September meetings, but he is still a
 crucial player in the transition to a younger leader-
 ship. If he does indeed succeed Deng as chairman of
 the Military Commission, one of two paths is open to
 him: either to serve as an interim chairman, possibly
 until the 13th Party Congress in 1987, and then to set
 a solid precedent by retiring; or to set himself up on
 the Military Commission as China's principal political
 broker, in much the same fashion as Deng has done.
 In fact, Hu's ultimate course may already have been
 laid out for him in the bargaining that preceded the
 conference of delegates.F_~

 The most difficult transition still to be accomplished,
 however, is Deng's own. Deng has so dominated the
 Chinese political scene since 1978, and the reform
 "vision" is so much his own, that it is difficult to judge
 what the program will be like without him. Deng has
 been indispensable to the successive victories that the
 reform coalition has won. The irony now is that, if the
 program is to survive his passing, he must truly retire,
 allowing his chosen successors to establish their au-
 thority independent of his. We believe that Deng
 recognizes this, and fully intends to step down. He is
 not likely to do so, however, unless he is joined by old-
 guard stalwarts Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, and Li Xian-
 nian, none of whom has yet indicated any interest in
 retirement. In our judgment, it will take another
 demonstration of Deng's unique political skills to
 bring this off. Before the 13th Party Congress, sched-
 uled for 1987, Deng will probably make one last
 attempt to lead China's founding revolutionaries off
 the political stageF__-]

 Appendix A
 September 1985 Party Delegates Conference
 Extracts From Major Speeches
 Collective Leadership
 Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee [1978], all major policy de-
 cisions of the central leading organs have been made collectively, with the
 revolutionaries of the older generation steering the course.
 Work of the Delegates Conference
 The Third Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee [1984] considered that the
 proposal concerning the Seventh Five-Year Plan had a vital bearing on the
 national economy. It also considered that organizational matters-in particular
 the election of additional members to the central leading bodies-must be taken
 very seriously. For these reasons, the session decided that a national conference
 should be convened.
 The work of drafting the five-year-plan proposal was presided over by Comrade
 Zhao Ziyang. To seek opinions on it, a meeting was held last July with some 200
 participants. In line with the proposal to be adopted by the conference, the State
 Council will work out the Seventh Five-Year Plan and submit it to the National
 People's Congress next spring.
 Regarding the organizational question, last May the Central Committee set up a
 working group composed of Comrades Xi Zhongxun, Bo Yibo, Song Renqiong, Yu
 Qiuli, Qiao Shi, Wang Heshou, and myself. The group drafted a resolution on
 ways of further effecting the succession of new members in the leading central or-
 gans. It also approved the requests of some veteran cadres to resign from the
 central organs and prepared a list of candidates for election to those bodies.
 Leadership Rejuvenation
 During the last two or three years, many veteran comrades have asked to resign
 from the central organs. It is in response to the needs of the party's cause that most
 veterans have retired; it is also in response to the needs of the party's cause that a
 few have remained. Our long struggles have produced a number of very
 experienced veteran revolutionaries who enjoy high prestige both inside and
 outside the party and both at home and abroad. It is the common desire of the en-
 tire party membership and of the people of all our nationalities, and in their
 fundamental interest, to keep these veteran revolutionaries in the top leadership of
 the party.
 In 1979 the Central Committee raised the question of promoting persons of ability
 and political integrity and making the leadership younger. Since then, leading
 bodies from top to bottom have undergone two major readjustments. Consequent-
 ly, the readjustment for younger leadership is nearly completed.

 Endorsement of Reforms
 It has been almost seven years since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central
 Committee. These seven years have been one of the best periods of economic and
 political development since the founding of the People's Republic.
 Zhao Ziyang             Seventh Five-Year-Plan Proposal
 The document was drawn up after a year of deliberation under the direction of the
 Secretariat of the Central Committee and the State Council. It is not the Seventh
 Five-Year Plan itself but a set of proposals for the plan. Instead of listing a whole
 series of quotas, the proposal deals with only a few major ones that have immediate
 bearing on the overall situation. Two of the distinct features are its emphasis on
 development strategy and on principles and policies, which represent an important
 new approach to planning. Once the proposal is adopted by the conference, the
 State Council will use it as the basis for drafting the actual Seventh Five-Year
 Plan.
 Planned Growth Rates and Budget Deficits
 The gross value of industrial and agricultural production is expected to increase at
 an average annual rate of 7 percent and that of the GNP at an even higher rate. A
 sustained 7- or 8- or even 10-percent growth rate over such a long time is rare in
 the economic development of any country. A similar situation has occurred only in
 a few countries and regions during the economic takeoff stage.
 A small deficit does not matter much and should not be taken as the primary indi-
 cator of how the country is faring financially and economically.
 Tasks of the Plan
 There are three main tasks in the period of the Seventh Five-Year Plan: 1) to cre-
 ate a sound economic and social environment for the smooth progress of structural
 reform; 2) to speed up the construction of key projects; and 3) to continue to
 improve the people's living standards. The first task is most important.
 The plan can be divided into two stages. In the first two years, the emphasis will be
 on controlling social demand to solve the problems of overly rapid growth rates, ex-
 cessive investment in fixed assets, and sharp increases in consumption funds.
 However, the main drawback is that people may not pay much attention to this ef-
 fort, and these problems may even run out of control. Reform should focus on im-
 proving macroeconomic control while stabilizing the economy. We must continue
 price reform and develop better economic levers, such as interest rates, tax rates,
 and exchange rates. In the last three years, price reform will be completed, tax and
 banking reforms will be established, and investment in construction will be
 increased in accordance with the circumstances.

 Role of Market Forces in Regulating the Economy
 In reforming the economic structure, we must do the following things: 1) further
 invigorate enterprises, especially state-owned large and medium-sized ones; 2)
 further expand the planned socialist commodity market and gradually improve the
 marketing system; 3) gradually relax the state's direct control over the economic
 operation of enterprises in favor of indirect controls, such as economic, legal,
 and-if necessary-administrative measures.
 The task confronting us is that while improving microeconomic operations and
 mechanisms we must.exercise more effective indirect control over macroeconomic
 operations. In other words, we must give a greater regulating role to economic
 levers and improve economic legislation and supervision.
 Only when we make a success of indirect macroeconomic control can we
 coordinate it with the reforms that are under way, and only then can the conditions
 be created for greater flexibility with regard to enterprises. The extent to which we
 relax direct microeconomic controls and the measures we take for that purpose
 must be suited to the state's ability to exercise more effective indirect control and
 must be coordinated with such control.
 Dealing With Anticipated Problems
 During this period, a host of problems will arise in the process of creating a
 favorable environment for reforms. There are two keys to solving these problems:
 first, to enhance the economic efficiency of enterprises and to make them better
 able to earn more foreign exchange through exports. Technological transformation
 should be conducted; however, it is even more urgent to raise operational and
 management skills.
 The second key is to earn more foreign exchange to strike a balance of payments.
 As a developing country, China will suffer shortages of foreign exchange for a long
 time. We must work out a development strategy and systematic foreign trade
 policies. We should make full use of the special economic zones, open cities and re-
 gions along the coast, develop an export network, and we should earn more foreign
 exchange through tourism and labor export.
 Building Socialist Civilization
 We must build the "two civilizations" simultaneously, steadfastly adhering to the
 four principles, opposing corruption by bourgeois liberalism, capitalism, and other
 decadent ideologies. We must improve the socialist legal system and our political
 and ideological work so that our "spiritual civilization" complements and expedites
 our material civilization.
 Deng Xiaoping            Progress of Reforms
 The period since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee [1978]
 has been a crucial one. For many years we suffered badly from one major error: we
 still took class struggle as the key link. Since the Third Plenum, we have
 accomplished two things: we have set wrong things right, and we have launched
 comprehensive reforms. The current good situation would not have come about if
 we had not corrected the erroneous "left" mistakes and shifted the focus of our

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/03/01 : CIA-RDP86T0059OR000300560002-0
 work to developing the economy. At the same time, if we had not adhered to the
 four principles [upholding the socialist road, the people's democratic dictatorship,
 the leadership of the Communist Party, and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong
 Thought], we would have gone from correcting "left" mistakes to "correcting"
 socialism and Marxism-Leninism.
 In the reform, we have consistently followed two fundamental principles. One is
 the predominance of the socialist public sector of the economy; the other is
 common prosperity. The use of foreign investment funds in a planned way and the
 promotion of a degree of individual economy are serving the development of the so-
 cialist economy. We still have to work out specific rules and regulations by trial
 and error.
 The Seventh Five-Year Plan
 It is projected that, during the period of the plan, the annual growth rate will be
 7 percent, a figure on which the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau has
 unanimously agreed, and which may be exceeded in practice. If the growth rate
 were too high, that would create many problems. We must control the scale of in-
 vestment in fixed assets and see that capital construction is not overextended.
 Socialist Civilization and Party Work Style
 Although much work has been done to build a socialist society that is both
 culturally and materially advanced, we must admit that so far the results are not
 very satisfactory, mainly because it has not had the serious attention of the entire
 party membership. We exert ourselves for socialism not only because socialism
 provides conditions for faster development of the forces of production than
 capitalism, but also because only socialism can eliminate the greediness, corrup-
 tion, and injustice that are inherent in capitalism. In recent years, some evil things
 that had long been extinct after liberation have come to life again. Material
 progress will suffer delays and setbacks unless we promote cultural and ideological
 progress as well. Today, some comrades no longer have a clear understanding of
 this truth.
 At present, we must first concentrate on bringing about a fundamental improve-
 ment in party conduct and in general social conduct. In consolidating the party, we
 must succeed in four tasks: achieving unity in thinking, improving party conduct,
 strengthening discipline, and purifying the party organization. We should greatly
 strengthen and never weaken ideological and political work as well, and support
 the work of cadres in this field. Ideological, cultural, educational, and public
 health departments should take social benefit as the sole criterion for their
 activities and so must the enterprises affiliated with them. In our propaganda
 work, we must firmly oppose bourgeois liberalism and publicity that favors taking
 the capitalist road. It goes without saying, however, that we should adhere to the
 policy of "letting 100 flowers bloom." With regard to erroneous ideological
 tendencies, we should adopt a policy of persuasion and education, and refrain from
 political movements and "mass criticism."

 Promotion of Young Cadres and the Need for Theoretical Study
 The succession of new cadres to old and their cooperation have been going on fairly
 well over the past few years. I once said that younger age and professional
 knowledge alone are not enough. To these must be added a fine work style. I hope
 you will serve the people wholeheartedly. We often say that the succession of new
 cadres to old provides the organizational guarantee for the continuity of our
 party's policies. It means the continuity of the domestic and foreign policies of
 independence, democracy, legality, opening to the outside world, and invigorating
 the domestic economy, which we will by no means change.
 Now I would like to propose a new requirement-the study of Marxist theory, a
 requirement not only for new cadres but for old ones as well. Some comrades may
 say: What immediate use is there to studying Marxist theory? Comrades, this is a
 misconception. Marxist theory is not a dogma, but a guide to action. We must find
 time in our busy schedules to study Marxist theory. Only thus can our party keep
 to the socialist road and build socialism with Chinese characteristics until the
 realization of our ultimate goal-Communism.
 Statement of Support
 I support the proposal of the Central Committee for furthering the succession of
 new members to old in the leading central organs, its proposal for the formulation
 of the Seventh Five-Year Plan, and the speeches delivered by members of the
 Standing Committee of the Political Bureau.
 Promotion of Younger Leaders
 Promoting young and middle-aged people to leading posts by the tens of thousands
 to reinforce the leading bodies at all levels is an important task that our party has
 stressed repeatedly over the past few years. This system will ensure that there will
 be an orderly succession of cadres in the Communist Party from generation to
 generation.
 Problems With Agriculture, Rural Enterprises
 We must continue to pay attention to grain production. Thanks to the contracted
 responsibility system, agricultural production has increased. The media have for
 some time exaggerated the number of "10,000-yuan households." Actually, there
 are not that many. Our media's reports are divorced from reality.
 Some peasants are no longer interested in growing grain. They are not even
 interested in raising pigs and vegetables, because in their opinion there can be "no
 prosperity without engaging in industry." Town and township enterprises should
 be developed. The thing is that the call of "no prosperity without engaging in
 industry" is heard much louder than that of "no economic stablility without
 agricultural development." Feeding and clothing 1 billion people constitutes one of
 China's major political and economic challenges, for "grain shortages will lead to
 social disorder."

 The Nature of China's Economy and the Role of Planning
 The socialist economy must be developed proportionately and in a planned way.
 We are Communists. Our goal is to build socialism. The general orientation for re-
 structuring the urban economy is correct, but we are experimenting with concrete
 measures for its implementation. We must look carefully before taking each step.
 The planned economy's primacy and the subordinate role of market regulation are
 still necessary. Planning consists of both mandatory planning and guidance
 planning. Both involve the planned use of economic regulators. Guidance planning
 is not the same as market regulation. Market regulation involves no planning,
 blindly allowing supply and demand to determine production. Planning is the
 essence of macroeconomic control. Only by doing a good job of macroeconomic
 control can we stimulate the microeconomy and make it dynamic but not chaotic.
 Proper Economic Growth Rates
 The proposal of the Seventh Five-Year Plan sets annual industrial and agricultural
 growth rates at 7 and 6 percent respectively. These are respectable. And although
 they may be surpassed during this period, there is no reason to set them higher.
 Comrade Deng Xiaoping once mentioned China's excessive industrial and agricul-
 tural growth rates, saying, "It sounds good, but contains disturbing elements." I
 agree with this. As the saying puts it, "More haste, less speed."
 Party Conduct, Ideological Work, and Corruption
 Improving party conduct remains a major task of the entire party. Leading cadres
 at all levels, particularly senior ones, should set good examples. There's no such
 thing as retirement when it comes to setting good examples. I hope that the party's
 senior leaders will set a good example in educating their children, who absolutely
 must not use their parents' positions in pursuing personal power and interests and
 becoming privileged.
 We must intensify ideological and political work and preserve the prestige of the
 party's departments in charge of this work. There are now some people, including
 some party members, who have forsaken the socialist and Communist ideal and
 turned their backs on serving the people. Some of them have become rich by
 unlawful means such as speculation and swindle, graft, and acceptance of bribes.
 In their dealings with foreigners, they have no consideration of personal or national
 dignity. These problems can be attributed to the relation of ideological and
 political work and the decline in the function and authority of departments in
 charge of such work. We should take this as a lesson. Party organizations at all
 levels should conduct ideological and political work in earnest and safeguard the
 authority of those departments.
 Adherence to democratic centralism is a principle prescribed by the party
 Constitution. All decisions on important issues must be made by the collective
 after complete discussion to avoid mistakes and unnecessary detours and to
 achieve better results.

 Li Xiannian                   Economic Tasks
 The essential task for the historical stage of socialism is to develop the productive
 forces and ensure the planned and balanced growth of the national economy. Since
 this year's economic growth rate has been excessively high, it will not be easy to re-
 duce it to normal next year. Our comrades must-keep in mind our party's fine tra-
 dition of seeking truth from facts and maintaining close ties with the people, and
 check the tendency found in some areas to make false reports that mislead the
 leaders. We should actively expand trade with foreign countries and use the
 foreign exchange thus earned to import necessary and useful advanced technology,
 equipment, and materials to further socialist modernization in a realistic manner.
 Ideological and Political Work
 Ideological and political work must be intensified during economic construction
 and structural reform. Regions and units that have overlooked ideological and
 political work in recent years should strengthen it immediately and seriously. We
 must step up education in ideals, social conduct, discipline, and law, and combat
 the corruption of capitalist and feudal. ideologies, bourgeois liberalism, egotism,
 and putting money above all else.
 The Opening to the Outside and Foreign Policy
 We cannot modernize behind a closed door. The basic tasks of construction and re-
 forms at home determine that we will follow an independent, peaceful, and open
 foreign policy. It is in the interests of all people to oppose the arms race, preserve
 world peace, and expand international exchanges in all areas. We must make
 further efforts to unify the mainland and Taiwan by peaceful means.
