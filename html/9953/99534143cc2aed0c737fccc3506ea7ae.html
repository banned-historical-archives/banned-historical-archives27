 SECTION l,s  S'I  NARY OF FAR EAST 7REN` DS AND DEVELOPMENTS
 India, Australia and the Philippines continue to be concerned over [k5?
 withdrawal-from-rJapan story despite official denials (pe 3).  SCAP seeking
 Western Hemisphere trade to balance Communist gains in Asia (p, 3),
 Development of Soviet military bases in northern Korea has probably
 begun (p? 3).     A UN Military Observer Group in Korea would not deter
 Communist attempts to overthrow the Republic of Korea (p.. 4).  Low produc-
 tion levels and currency inflation continue as trends in Korean economy
 (p. 4) o
 This vmek the victorious Chinese Red armies continued to sit calmly
 on the north bars of the Yangtze River while MAO Tse-tung and the Central
 Committee waited to see what LI Tsung.-jen could deliver (pa 5). In
 Nationalist China Acting President LI, in addition to his peace efforts,
 is attempting to undermine the Generalissimo's influence by countering
 political maneuvers (pm 5)Q  Recent Communist broadcasts indicate that the
 Red High Command regards with disfavor the recent Lanchou conference on
 consolidation of Nationalist strength in the Northwest and views current
 Nationalist-Soviet negotiations as a threat to Communist expansion in the
 Northwest (p. 6).  Meanwhile TANG En-po, Nationalist Commander in Shanghai,
 is attempting to extract a GY #300,000,000 "protection aesesment  from
 Shanghai buainnaamen (pa 6).
 Siamea declaration of a state of national. emergency in the face of
 Southeast Asia unrest is believed to be an effort to divert attention from
 domestic political disunity (p. 8).
 The issue of Coohinchinaas status in a unified Vietnam has apparently
 become such a delicate* political problem that the French Government has
 decided to abandon its proposal to present a treaty with former emperor
 Bao Dai to the French National Assembly for ratification prior to his
 return to Indochina (p. 8).

 with areas outside of Northeast Asia continue on an accelerated basis
 probably in an endeavor to decrease Japan's reliance upon its "natural"
 markets in that now Communist-dominated area. As part of this endeavor,
 SCAP has requested the US State Department to explore the possibilities
 of Japanese trade with Central and South American countries.
 Japan can offer all typos of textiles, capital goods equipment, heavy
 and light machinery, metal products, glass and porcelain ware, rubber
 goods, canned foods, enamelxrare and truchs in exchange for needed rice,

 (See B/FE teehly 24 Dec. 48. - 4 Jan. 49)    To date Soviets have been
 observed in Chinna  o, Haeju, Hungnam, Chongjin and Wonsan.  Appearance of
 USSR naval personnel in Chongjin and Tons= is particularly significant
 and may indicate that the Soviet-Democratic Peoples' Republic naval co-
 operation treaty already is being carried out.  Under the terms of this
 agreement, the ports of Chongjin, Wonsan and Yonghung Bay are to be made
 available to the Soviet fleet as bases.  t7ork was to begin in March 1949

 observers along the 38th parallel probably would not deter the aggressive
 irtenticna of the Democratic Peoples' Republic,,  They might introduce a
 stabilizing element and possibly act as a slight deterrent to all-out
 civil czar, hoa vor, if US troops yore vithdrann from southern Korea.  The
 presence of UN military observers in southern Korea would also assist in
 mitigating the adverse psychological reaction to a US troop withdrawal
 in southern Korea.
 The principal secretary of the United Nations Cormissio+n on Korea
 (UNCOK) has requested US views on the desirability and practicability of
 sending foreign military observers to Koreas, He h  not presented the
 idea to other members of TLCOK when he approached the US representative,
 but probably a majority of the members would favor the idea after becom-
 ing acquainted pith the situation along the border and with the impossi-
 bility of reaching a solution for the unification of Korea,
 Economic deve     n s,  The Korean economy suffered further decreases of
 industrial production and increasing currency inflation during January.
 Electric power output decreased to the lowest point since June 198,
 resulting in further decrease in the meager production of manufactured
 goods,  Increase in coal production during January may allow greater
 power output during February and a consequent slight improvement in the
 production of critical industrial goods.
 Currency inflation continued to increase an the government overdraft
 pith the Bank of Chosen enlarged from 39.8 billion to 42.5 billion
 during the month.  President Rhee, rrith slight knocrledge of finance,
 believes that the Bank of Chosen is at fault in continuing to issue
 currency, and that a simple cure for inflation is to hold circulation
 at its present level.  However, it trill be impossible to stop the increase
 of currency circulation until Rhee's government can achieve a balanced
 budget.  The rice collection program and the many urgent projects of the
 new government require expenditures far exceeding revenues deposited by
 the Government in the Bank.  Although the American Mission in Korea
 (ALIIK) is assisting officials of the Korean government in planning methods
 to increase revenue, to collect accounts receivable owed to the Govern-
 ment from sales under the Civilian Supply program, and to establish a
 reasonable government budget, the currency circulation probably will
 continue to increase and roach 55 billion = before the seasonal decline

 Communists mark time, wait to see what LI can deliver.  The lull
 in the Chinese Communist military offensive, which has halted at the
 north bank of the Yangtze for the past few weeks? is by no means the
 result of military incapacity. While the delay may be in part due
 to a need for rest, regrouping, and resupplying, the reasons are primarily
 political. The Communists are absorbing China by a methodical process
 of acquisition, consolidation, and extension; they have nothing to
 lose, and much to gain, by avoiding the responsibility for administering
 new areas until they are thoroughly prepared to discharge it.  In
 the past, when the Communists were confined to a relatively small
 area, administration was not difficult; but territorial gains of the
 past several months have greatly complicated their problems, and the
 administration of all China, if it were forced upon them at once,
 would be too much for their own personnel to handle,  It is probably
 for this reason that the Communists have insisted upon regional
 capitulation rather than a "national" settlement, and have made every
 effort to induce the administrative personnel of the major cities to
 remain on the job.  The present delay gives the Communists time to
 absorb Tientsin and Peiping, and to profit from their experience in
 those cities.  It permits a clarification of the situation in the
 enemy's camp:  i,e., to determine what forces, if any, Acting Presi-
 dent LI Tsung.jen can or will deliver to the Communists, and what
 forces will remain at large and hostile, and the best means for dealing
 with both groups.,  In addition, the various Nationalist factions will
 presumably continue to sabotage one another and weaken still further
 the over-all anti-Communist effort.  Thus, while the occupation of those
 cities--notably Shanghai"=with especially complex problems will be
 delayed for weeks and perhaps for months, there is no reason at all
 to believe that the Communists have altered their announced intet.tion
 to push south of the Yangtze and proclaim a National Government of
 China within the present year,
 LI-CHIANG split destroying Nationalist unity.  The split in
 Nationalist ranks between the followers of  retired" President
 CHIANG Kai-shek and Acting President LI Tsung-jen has assumed such
 proportions it threatens all semblance of unity in the National Govern-
 ment.  The LI and CHIANG groups are split on issues of peace maneuvers,
 reforms, and'theActing President's refusal to follow the Cabinet to
 Canton.  In addition, LI's efforts are now directed toward the reduction
 of CHIANG's influence throughout Nationalist China,  LI has gained
 some political support in the Yangtze area and probably will be backed
 by the largest group in the Legislative Yuan, which has decided to
 convene in Wanking shortly,,  However, his attempts to compromise with
 the recalcitrant SUN Fo Cabinet or to facilitate possible organization
 of a satisfactory new one will be fraught with difficulty,,  SUN is

 under fire in legislative circles and may resign?
 LI's efforts to win over prominent right-wing generals may not
 prove successful.  CHANG Fa?kuei, popular Kwangting leader who has
 in the past opposed CHIANG several times, thus far has not accepted
 his recent appointment as Commander-in..Chief of the Nationalist Army.
 Although CHANG would be acceptable to PAI Chung-hsi, he probably would
 not be able to keep the Vhampoa generals in line. Recent changes in
 the Hupeh provincial administration have replaced CHIANG supporters
 with men loyal to LI and PAI Chung-hsi,  In trying to combat CHIANG's
 control of Szechwan. LI is apparently supporting Governor LIU Won"
 hui of Sikang, former warlord Governor of Szechwan, who has  moved
 troops into the province as a countermove  against the entry of HU
 TaLng-van's Nationaliat troops from Shensi, recently ordered by CHANG
 Chun, a loyal friend of the Generalissimo.  LI is also considering
 a challenge to CHiIANG's control of Taiwan, which the latter has been
 preparing as a refuge of last resort.  In a transparent bid for US
 support, LI has informed US officials that he is contemplating the
 replacement of Governor CHEN Cheng with General SUP. Li" jen, former
 Commander of the US-trained New First Army, with the idea of making
 that island a basis for constructive Sino=US cooperation,.  Despite
 such efforts by LI, there is only a very slight prospect that he will
 be successful in overcoming CHIANG's influence and in consolidating
 Nationalist China under his leadership.
 Chinese Communist Reaction to formation of northwest bloc.  The
 Chinese Communists regard with disfavor the recent Lanchou conference
 on consolidation of Nationalist strength in the Northwest, and see
 in the current Nationalist--Soviet negotiations in Sinkiang a threat
 to Communist expansion into Northwest China.  Recent Chinese Communist
 broadcasts suggest that the Communists may be mapping a drive into
 territory now held by the forces of HU Tsung-nan and MA Pu-fang in
 south Shensi and east Kansu.  A new Communist radio station, identifying
 itself as the "Northwest Radio" was intercepted on 7 February, broad-
 casting a program entitled "Calling Northwest Guerrilla Units."  Three
 days later the Northwest Radio advised Natio?ialist forces in the North-
 west to surrender, and announced the coming "annihilation of HU Tsungcnan9
 MA Hung"hwei and MA Pu-fang,"
 According to late reports,, elements of HU Tsur.g-non's troops are
 being transferred  to Szechwan9 and Nationalist Northwest forces con-
 sider southern Kansu indefensible.  The forces of Communist General
 P_~:N.: Teh.huai, now located northeast of Sian, therefore may be capable
 of advancing westward as far as Lanchou, but are not likely to move
 any farther for the time being,

 Shanghai  Mayor K, C. 4Vu told the industrial guilds on 17 February
 that GY 4300 million (US 4160,000) must be subscribed for January.
 This rather simple protection racket is, of course, based on the
 threat that without his "squeeze" TANG ]napo cannot guarantee order
 among his troops.  In the last few days Shanghai has witnessed parades
 of armored cars, and military police are scattered throughout the city;
 if such tactics do not intimidate the merchant guilds, TANG kph-po
 will probably resort to some violence to make his extortion .ucceed.
 The foreign community, largely American and British, is very concerned,
 but past experience with emergency military "taxation" indicates that
 not much pressure will be brought on independent foreign firms, although
 guild members like the British tobacco firms may not be able to aa',.id
 the responsibilities of their guild membership.  It is evident that
 TANG intends to profit from his stay in rich Shanghai, and that the
 monthly "protection assessments" will increase sharply as the Qom-
 munists move closer.

 SIAM
 ~Ae
 N: tional eater  ao  declaration believed cover for domestic unrest,,  The
 cvernment last Thursday proclaimed Siam to be in a state. ol" nat anal
 emergency.  The announced reasons for this step are (1) the crises in neigh-
 boring countries, (0) the unrest resulting from the irresponsible Siamese
 press, and (3) the report of a mutual assistance agreement between Ho Chi
 Minh and Mao Tse-tung,  Although the decree very probably embodies the
 alarm with Which many Siamese view chaotic conditions in China,, Burma,,
 Malaya and Indochina,, the compelling factor behind it probably is Premier
 P:;tbulse fear that domestic political opposition forces are effective ".y
 c: ,anizing to stage a coup d'etat.
 Early this month Phibul extended placating overtures to supportora of
 ex-Premier Pridi,, presumably in an effort to encourage their collaboration
 with him to achieve political unity.  It appears likely that these nogoti-'
 ations failed.  Thus. In the face of a possible threat to his regime,
 Phibul may have felt it expedient to inoreasor the controls necessary for
 the maintenance of his power?
 French alter plan for Bao Dais return.  The issue of Cochinchina"s status   r'Bs
 in a unified Vietnam has apparentlybecome such a delicate political
 problem that the French Government has decided to abandon its proposal to
 present a treaty with former Emperor Bao Dai to the French National
 Assembly for ratification prior to his return to Indochina;.  Cochinehina
 is still legally a French colony, and the defeat of legislation required
 in the treaty to permit unification with the protectorates of Tonkin and
 Annam as an integral part of a unified Vietnam might cause the collapse
 of the entire French plan for solving the Franoo-=Vietnamese problem?  There
 fore, a now formula for changing the status of Cochinohina and ratification
 by the French Assembly, based on Article 75 of the French Constitution,
 will be substituted.  This approach which envisages the signing of a treaty
 but not its ratification,, will require that Bao Dai return and establish
 his regime at an early date.  Subsequently, a favorable vote x3.1l be

 stated Republican intention to comply with the SC order may be confused by
 the demand of its "Emergency Government" in Sumatra that the 1947 Linggadjati
 Agreement be used as a basis for settlement rather than the SC resolution
 of 28 January 1949.  The Linggadjati Agreement specified more liberal
 conditions from the Republican point of view.

 advantage of the US import quota established for Philippine sugar.  Although
 the Trade Agreement permits up to 952,000 short tons of Philippine sugar to
 be imported duty free into the US annually, Philippine exports have only
 amounted to approximately 2448000 short tons in 1947 and 570,000 short tons

 exporters who are benefited by the Trade Agreement,

 based upon economic considerations, but he warned that "political arguments"

 SECTION III,  DIGEST OF IMPORTANT STUDIES AND ESTIMATES
 *OVERSEAS CHINESE-TOOLS OF COM IUNIST EXPANSION
 The serious prospect of a Communist-,dominated China brings into sharp
 focus the role of the overseas Chinese communities,  Overseas Chinese total
 over 9,000,000 persons and the more important and affluent groups are
 iboated,in Southeast Asia   Some two to three million 'Chinese'reside in Siam,
 1,700,000 in Malaya, 1;200,000 in the Netherlands East Indies, 400,000 in
 French Indo-China, 190,000 in Burma, 120,000 in the Philippines, and 90-000
 in British Borneo,  These people nurture their ties with the Motherland,
 operate cohesively as a race and in many instances claim dual citizenship.
 At present they reflect the political differences which exist back home,
 but should a Communist government come into being,, Communist expansion in
 the Far East can be hastened and the impact on the peripheral areas of
 Southeast Asia can be almost immediate,,
 Overseas Chinese Issues
 The millions of Chinese settlers are industrious, hard-working, and for
 the most part law-abiding citizens.  They are largely unassimilable.  Their
 virtues give them wealth, power and prestige in the local community much out
 of proportion to their numerical strength,  Their success as colonizers and
 their unassimilability quite naturally make them suspect as the potential
 instruments of an aggressive Chinese foreign polioyo  No government of
 China could be unaware of this potentiality.
 Today, a growing and a proud Chinese Nationalism aspires to a position
 of leadership in the Far East.  There is already a growing feeling of concern
 by the governments and peoples of Southeast Asia regarding Chinese penetra-
 tion; this feeling is particularly noted in connection with the problems of
 Chinese immigration. Chinese schools and Chinese secret societies,  The
 additional danger, now, of Chinese Communist infiltration presents a threat
 to the sovereignty of the small nations of Southeast Asia.
 Chinese Control of Overseas Chinese
 The Chinese Nationalist Government, when it first came into power,
 organized an "Overseas Chinese Affairs Commissioe to control and exploit
 Chinese communities abroad.  A Communist Goverment of China would undoubtedly
 retain this organization, which at present operates on a Cabinet level?  The

 to China during the Sino-Japanese hostilities0  If continued, they could

 likely to be almost bankrupt.

 The political struggle which is going through its decisive stage in
 China very definitely has its extension in Southeast Asia.  Although the
 Kuomintang organization and secret societies in Southeast Asia are strong
 and well entrenched and exert their influence on the side of the MMtionalist
 Goverment, they do not appear to be as powerful as one might roasc,nably
 assume, considering the relative economic affluence of the Chinese overseas
 community.  In Malaya, for example, Chinese Communist influence is spreading
 to the point where it might well be considered the focal point for the
 expansion which is being assumed throughout Siam, the Philippines, and
 Indonesia.  Reports also suggost that official liaison has been established
 between the Chinese community in Malaya and the Communists In Manchuria
 and North China.  Should the Chinese Communists convene a People m8 Consult-
 ative Conference as a prelude to the establishment of a new Goverment in
 China, it is likely that the Communist program in the Par East will follow
 a pattern resembling the prevent Cominform in Europe.  Alreadys, a surprising
 number of wealthy Chinese merchants in Malaya have identified themselves
 in some form with Communist Party interests,  Far from being idealistiev
 thin action is presumed to be motivated by a desire to be in step with
 Communist ascendancy when and if it prevails in Southeast Asia.
 Conclusions:
 Although some elements of the Kuomintang may go underground, the
 Overseas Chinese communities in general are expected to serve effectively
 the interest of a Communist--dominated government in China..  In the meantime,
 present Chinese Communist elements in Southeast Asia are expected to con-
 tinue their efforts at gaining political control of the Overseas cormum&ties,
 and operate in concert with armed resistance movements now contesting the
 authority of various governments in Southeast Asia,
 In support of theee probable developments, there is the very serious
 likelihood that a cessation of hostilities in China will make vast stocks
 of military equipment available almost immediately.  This material assistance
 to the resistance movements in Southeast Asia might well upset the present
 delicate balance of power now being held by the 1ostern Powers in the Far
 East and adversely affect the availability to the Western Powers of South-
 east Adams tin, oil, tungsten and rubber,

 A} NA LOUISE MRA6SKED B
 The arrest in Moscow of Anna Louise Strong, an American journalist
 long notorious as one of the most enthusiastic and simple-minded?partisana
 of the Soviet order, and her deportation as "a notorious agent.ooinorimin-
 ated in espionage and subversive activity against the Soviet Union,"' was
 probably occasioned in large part by Miss Strong's recent pronouncements
 on the Chinese Communists.  It was Miss Strong's misfortune, which must
 have come as a great shook to one who had successfully eluded the Soviet
 3eourity polio* for these 30 years? to have been looking in the opposite
 direction on the day the Party line changed,
 There are at least three potentially explosive issues between the'
 USSR and the Chinese Communists:  the questions of deference to Moscow,
 Soviet designs in the border areas, and leadership of the revolution. in
 Asia.  In her recent boo's, Dawn in China, serialized in the Party press
 of the satellitm and some oc    co ma, Miss Strong offered a con-
 struotion of events, in regard to each of those issues, which could prove
 extremely embarrassing to the USSR in its future relations with the Chinese
 Communists
 According to Miss Strong, the Chinese Communists "acquired an expire
 in Manchuria" almost solely through their own efforts; while Soviet forces
 did capture the cities. that contribution was nullified by the fact that
 they installed his (CHIANG Kai_shekie) appointees0,s.and protected them
 there for months."  Not content with more obstructionism, the USSR
 attempted to sabotage the province economically:  "Manchuria was blockaded
 on three sidos000Not only no arms came over. but not even peaceful traded"
 As if that were not bad enough: "What help did Lin Piao get from the
 Russians?  According to Lin Piao:  No troops, no weapons, no advisers,
 nothingAP"  Even more scandalous, if not downright counterrevolutionary:
 "From the Russian-protected cities liiang's officials instigated a civil
 war against the farmers of the countryside0Q,0They (the Soviets) saved
 these officials from the Manchurian people."  (Infacte the Soviet with-
 drawal was so managed as to allow the Chinese Communists to occupy
 Manchuria and, to 'capture4 enormous quantitites of Japanese materiels
 While Miss Strong?s version is false, that has been the Soviet official
 version since V'J Day, and the USSR might be expected to be greatful to
 Miss. Strong for continuing to foist it upon the public0  But there is"
 another factor.  Up to the accession to power of a Communist movement, the
 USSR denies any'except ideological connection with it; but,, with the success
 of the movement, the problem is no longer one of assisting the movement
 to power, but primarily that of ensuring its fidelity to the USSR,  At
 that time, the USSR seeks to impress upon the leaders of the movement the
 view that the movement is obligated for its success almost exclusively to
 the USSR; thus Miss Strong, in advancing at this time the thesis that the
 Chinese Communists owe nothing to the USSR, is doing the USSR a genuine
 disservice,)

 Miss Strong's book makes Soviet designs in the border areas appear '
 particularly nefarious, in that, by her account, the USSR did not assist,
 in fact impeded, the Chinese Communists in those regions.  In Miss Strong',
 reports, the Soviets refused to cooperate even in the operation of the
 Manchurian railway network in which the USSR is a treaty partner,  Miss
 Strong, asking a group of Chinese railway workers why they did not get
 lubricants and spare parts from the USSR, learned that "'?   didn't oven
 asks  We knew they would refuse0 "  In addition to the above, which might
 be construed by a hostile reader as indicating that the workers" fatherland
 is both ungracious and pauperized, Miss Strong's account goes so far as to
 reflect unfavorably on Soviet economic theory itself.  She writes of the
 moderate Chinese Communist land reform that "every family felt the stimulus
 of free enterprise, knowing that there was freedom at last to advarwev.,"
 Still worse, after the Chinese Communist refusal to admit their debt to
 the Soviet economy,, either in fact or in theory, it appears that they
 would not even grant the supremacy of Soviet arilitary strategy.  The
 Chinese Communist victories have "come from a unique organization of the
 armed forces and a remarkably realistic strategy worked out by Mao Tse-tung
 s.,"  Most incredible of all, the Chinese Communists were not always
 meticulous in acknowledging their obligation to their own spiritual
 ancestors.  At a ceremony celebrating the founding of the Chinese Republic,,
 there "were no pictures of Marx, Lenin, Stalin..."  And to Mao himself
 Miss Strong attributes a remark which is highly suspects  "'The fight is
 between democracy and anti-democracy, not between Soviet and anti-Soviet.'"
 (Actually, the above, while true in part, no more represents the complete
 picture than did Miss  Strong's account of Sino-Soviet relations in
 Manchuria; Miss Strong's trnasgression is not in having told falsehoods,,
 but in advancing falsehoods which are no longer useful,)
 While the above is in itself obviously sufficient to transform Miss
 Strong into a running-dog of American imperialism, Miss Strong's most
 appalling heresy occurs in regard to Chinese Communist relations with
 other countries in Asia,  Miss Strong writes that Chinese Communist "methods
 of war are being eagerly studied by insurgent armies in south.and east Asia.
 It is to Mao Tse-tung and to Communist China, much more than to present-day
 Moscow, that the national revolutions of Indonesia, Indo-China, Burma,
 look for their latest, most practical ideas.  Mao's strategy was made to
 fit such people."  Apart from the question of whether that is the fact, it
 is atrociously inappropriate to suggest it as the fact; Chinese Communist
 theoreticians, led by Mao, have time and again called for an Asian federation
 ("We should hold our destinies in our own hands"), and it has doubtless
 occurred to the Kremlin that the Chinese Communists might attempt to be the
 captain instead of the Kremlin's faithful lieutenant.
 'Miss Strong's book apparently was approved for publication, in March
 19489 by the Soviet authorities themselves.  Now, howover, after the
 defection of Tito, the USSR simply cannot afford to encourage the attitude,,

 particularly among the Chinese Gomlmaniats, Which Miss Strong"s articles tend
 to encourage.  That attitude, one of sufficient self-aggrandizement, or
 perhaps simply self-respect, to consider ona$s own regime capable of
 independent action,, and to comply with Soviet policy only when it seems
 to the national advantage, would be a major disaster to the USSR if it
 should appear among the Chinese Communists,  By denouncing Miss Strong as
 an enemy of all right-thinking peoplegs democrats--it is interesting
 that the USSR has done this publicly rather 'than privately--the USSR has
 in fact advised the Chinese Communists that Miss Strong must not be made
 welcome in Communist China; if the Chinese Communists do permit Miss
 Strong to visit and report upon them, it would seem that the insubordination
 which the USSR fears has beoame not merely a potential threat but a melan-
 choly stubborn fact,
