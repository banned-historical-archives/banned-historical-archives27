 China: Tensions in Tibet Continue
 Summary
 The upsurge of nationalism, especially among younger Tibetans,
 suggests that sporadic violence against Chinese in Tibet will continue.
 Tibetan exiles have sought to capitalize on recent unrest to win
 international sympathy and support for their cause, and may even be
 encouraging the violence. Beijing is likely to respond with a two-track
 approach. On the one hand, the authorities will crack down on dissidents
 and impose restrictions on the activities of monasteries. But Chinese
 leaders probably will also continue their liberal religious and minority
 policies toward Tibet to deflect international criticism and ultimately pacify
 the population. In our view, any prospect of defusing these tensions over
 the short term lies in a negotiated agreement between the Dalai Lama and
 Beijing, but such a settlement seems no nearer now than when unofficial
 talks between the two sides began in the late 1970s.

 The Depths of Tibetan Discontent
 The recurring unrest in Tibet since last fall graphically illustrates that Tibetans
 remain fervently nationalistic and hostile toward the Chinese. The hostility is reinforced
 by continued Chinese dominance of the bureaucracy, the modern sectors of the
 economy, and higher education despite the fact that the Chinese make up only 5
 percent of the population.
 Although Tibetan representation in the government and the party has steadily
 increased since 1980, many Tibetans view those in official positions as coopted by
 Beijing. This includes the Panchen Lama--second only to the Dalai Lama in the Tibetan
 Buddhist hierarchy but considered by many Tibetans to be a Chinese puppet. We
 believe many Tibetans saw his trip to Tibet in January--which coincided with other
 moves by Beijing to pacify the population--as a thinly disguised attempt to legitimize
 Chinese actions in the province. As a consequence, his call during the visit for greater
 autonomy in Tibet and his admission that police had fired on rioters in October only
 increased Tibetan resentment.
 Tibetans continue to resent the restrictions placed on monks and the destruction
 of temples and monasteries during the Cultural Revolution. In a meeting with US State
 Department officials in December, Chinese officials acknowledged that Beijing has
 established a limit of roughly 10,000 monks for Tibet.  Beijing claims limitations are
 necessary to ensure enough manpower to develop the region economically, and to keep
 the population from declining. To circumvent these quotas, many young Tibetans have
 little choice but to become "unofficial" monks, financially supported by their own
 families rather than the monasteries, further fueling resentment. In addition, although
 Beijing provides 80 percent of the funds for the restoration of temples and monasteries
 destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, only 234 out of some 2700 reportedly have
 been reopened.
 Tibetan Opposition Activity
 According to a contact- of the
 US Embassy in Beijing, the Dalai Lama's security office had sent a few monks from India
 to. each of the major monasteries in Lhasa last fall to encourage anti-Chinese activities.
 We do not know whether the Dalai Lama was aware of this.  His security office has
 acted in the past without his knowledge--in January 1987, it sent four or five Tibetans
 to Lhasa to try to assassinate Tibet party leader Wu Jinghua, according to a State
 Department contact.

 A Profile of the March Violence
 Rioting broke out in Lhasa on the morning of 5 March during the closing
 ceremony of the Great Prayer Festival, a holiday in which Tibetan monks
 traditionally reaffirm their authority over the secular government. The day
 before, Beijing admitted that a Tibetan dissident had died in prison last fall, and
 agitators may have suspected it would take little to spark mob violence in the
 large crowd. According to Western press and State reporting, several monks
 began shouting slogans in support of the Dalai Lama and calling for
 independence. They were joined by about 2,000 pilgrims from a crowd
 reportedly as large as 25,000.  Monks pelted police with rocks from the rooftops
 of the Jokhang Temple, and, according to Chinese press reports, destroyed
 vehicles and attacked a police station and office of the state-run Buddhist
 Association. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and stormed the
 temple, arresting over 200 monks.  Sporadic violence continued throughout that
 day and into the next.  Although the Chinese press acknowledges only five
 deaths, unconfirmed press reports suggest as many as 16 monks may have
 died.
 Lhasa authorities believe a majority of the populace supported the rioters
 and responded in force. Chinese police set up roadblocks around the city and
 carried out several sweeps of Lhasa's downtown and major monasteries,
 arresting perhaps 100 more Tibetans. To prevent further outbreaks of violence
 on the 10 March anniversary of the-1959 Tibetan uprising, authorities used Army
 troops dressed in police uniforms as reinforcements.
 US Consulate sources in Lhasa report that the situation after the rioting
 was worse than even news reports indicated:
 Although tensions
 remain high, foreigners in Lhasa report normalcy is slowly returning and some
 tourists have been allowed to visit temples and monasteries. Unconfirmed
 reports from the Western press state many monks remain in hospitals and, as
 they recover, are being sent to prison.
 The Dalai Lama and Tibetan exile leaders have clearly sought to capitalize on the
 unrest to attract international, including US Congressional attention, to the Tibetans'
 plight. Tibetans staged demonstrations in Washington, India, and several European
 capitals after the disturbances last October and again after the unrest in early March. In
 addition, they have fed a mix of fact and fiction to sympathetic Western political figures
 and journalists to turn public opinion against the Chinese and generate pressure on
 Beijing to make concessions (see appendix A).

 . Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama and Beijing have resumed their on-again, off-again
 dialogue,                               The Dalai Lama's elder brother, Gyalo Thondup,
 has made at least two trips to China since the unrest last October. According to the US
 Consulate in Hong Kong, another new unofficial channel may be opening though T.C.
 Wu, a Chinese Communist in the colony.
 We believe the
 five-point peace plan the Dalai Lama publicly floated last fall is a ploy to garner
 international support for the Tibetan cause and put Beijing on the defensive. It may also
 be in response to Tibetan exiles' perceptions that Beijing has hardened its stance since
 the first official negotiations in 1982. The plan seems deliberately ambiguous on the key
 issue of Tibetan independence (see appendix B).
 We cannot rule out that the exiles believe they can force Beijing to grant
 independence.  But we think it more likely that they are seeking to prod Beijing into
 granting real autonomy in exchange for nominal Chinese sovereignty.  Neither of the
 two official negotiating teams sent by the Dalai Lama in 1982 and 1984 demanded
 independence.  They sought instead expansion of the Tibet Autonomous Region to
 include Tibetan areas of Sichuan, Qinghai, and.Yunnan Provinces, and asked for an
 autonomous status similar to what Beijing has offered Taiwan.
 Tibetan exile leaders, however, may be at odds over how far to push the
 independence issue.  Some of the Dalai Lama's advisers apparently sympathize with
 Tibetans who favor total independence and oppose any negotiated settlement with
 Beijing. According to a contact of the US Embassy in Beijing, the Dalai Lama's cabinet is
 increasingly dominated by "fanatics" who will settle for no less than complete
 independence. In addition, the Tibetan Youth Congress, an exile group based in India,
 has periodically called on India to recognize that its own foreign policy interests demand
 an independent Tibet. One TYC member told a State officer last fall that "it might
 become necessary" to resume an armed struggle against the Chinese.
 Beijing's Quandary
 Beijing has few, if any, satisfactory options for defusing tensions over the short
 run. Beijing has repeatedly offered to recognize the Dalai Lama as a religious leader and
 to appoint him as a vice chairman of China's National People's Congress--a government
 position, it said, requiring residence in Beijing.  Recently, the Panchen Lama suggested
 the Dalai Lama could live in Tibet if he would return from exile.  The Dalai Lama
 predictably has rejected the offer, probably believing--quite rightly--he would be
 discredited by his followers if he accepted--just as the Panchen Lama has compromised
 his standing in Tibet by cooperating with the Chinese.
 In any. case, the renewed unrest in March underscores the failure of Beijing to
 mollify the populace by restoring temples, granting more religious freedom, and building
 roads, schools, hospitals, and some industries. Chinese leaders probably see no
 alternative to continuing these policies if for no other reason than to show the outside

 world they are making a reasonable effort to accommodate the interests of the Tibetans
 and other ethnic minorities. They probably also hope these policies and the economic
 improvements weaken the loyalty of the Tibetan population to the Dalai Lama.
 In the meantime, we expect the Chinese to increase repression to deter further
 violence. They have already arrested several hundred monks, according to press
 reports, and will probably impose even tighter restrictions on the operations of Buddhist
 monasteries.
 The Future:  More Negotiations, More Violence
 In our view, any success at defusing tensions in Tibet in the short term lies with
 a negotiated agreement between the Dalai Lama and Beijing.  Without the support of the
 Dalai Lama, Beijing's rule over Tibet will not appear legitimate to the Tibetans.  Such a
 settlement, however, is unlikely to be soon.  The Dalai Lama has refused Beijing's offer
 to live in Tibet and has insisted that his five-point plan must form a basis for
 negotiations.  Meanwhile, Beijing fears the Dalai Lama's visit to Europe this spring will
 generate greater popular support and is preparing a propaganda campaign to counter
 negative publicity.
 We expect Beijing to continue overtures to the Dalai Lama, again partly to show
 the international community that it is willing to reach an accommodation. But because
 the gap between their positions is so wide, the two are unlikely to reach a compromise.
 Beijing is not prepared to grant anything approaching real autonomy to Tibet because:
 ? The Chinese military, which still regards the area as strategically vital and
 probably fears undue Soviet or Indian influence, would firmly oppose the move.
 ? Chinese leaders fear such an agreement would encourage not only the Tibetans
 to seek full independence but other minorities located in equally sensitive
 strategic areas along China's border with the Soviet Union to make similiar
 demands.
 ?      Reform leaders, the architects of the liberal minorities policy, feel vulnerable
 enough on economic issues and are not about to give their critics an opening by
 making concessions on Tibet.
 Therefore, given the upsurge of Tibetan nationalism, especially among young
 monks, further sporadic outbreaks of violence seem inevitable. Although the heavy
 police presence and increased surveillance over the monasteries have restored an
 uneasy calm, several Tibetans have vowed to resume protests once the tourist season
 picks up later this month, according to state reporting. Chinese officials, meanwhile,
 fear monks have shifted their tactics to sabotage and assassination. Authorities were
 seaching for two men believed to be on suicide missions in mid-March.

 Appendix A
 Both Beijing and the Tibetan exiles have published historical accounts and
 statistics supporting their claims. Given the lack of independent observers in Tibet, and
 the remoteness of the region, the gathering of objective data is nearly impossible. The
 problem is further complicated because the two sides often use different boundaries for
 Tibet and different time frames without providing any definitions.
 For example, the Tibetan exiles claim there are 6 million Tibetans worldwide.
 However, China's 1982 census--performed under UN auspices--shows that China had
 3.82 million ethnic Tibetans.  In 1986, Chinese figures claim 4 million Tibetans, which we
 believe is fairly accurate.  Tibetan exiles are estimated to be only 100,000 worldwide,
 making the claim of 6 million appear grossly inflated.
 Tibetan exiles also demand an end to Han Chinese migration into Tibet, and
 allege that 1 million Chinese now live in the province.  According to State reporting,
 there are only about 70,000 to 80,000 Chinese civilians in Tibet, and we estimate
 perhaps another 60,000 troops, most stationed near the Sino-Indian border.  According
 to officials from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Beijing sent between 150,000
 and 200,000 Han to Tibet during the 1960s and 1970s. Partly out of the realization that
 a large Chinese presence in Tibetan cities contributes to Sino-Tibetan tension and partly
 because Chinese are unwilling to endure the hardships of life in Tibet, Beijing allowed at
 least 80,000 of these settlers to leave by 1981, which has caused a shortage of doctors,
 engineers, and other professionals.
 We are unable to substantiate Tibetan exiles' accusations that over 1 million
 Tibetans have died under Chinese rule. According to Chinese statistics, the number of
 ethnic Tibetans in China decreased from 2,775,622 in 1953 to 2,501,174 in 1964, but in
 1960-61 there was a serious famine in most of China, and the national population fell by
 1.3 million.  Given the fighting and emigration relating to the Dalai Lama's flight to India
 in 1959, the border war of 1962, and the famine, a decrease in Tibetan population of
 some 275,000 seems quite possible. But the claim that 1 million Tibetans died because
 of "political instability, imprisonment, and widescale famine," seems improbable.
 We are unable to confirm or deny the charge that Beijing has used Tibet as a
 dumping ground for nuclear waste.  We have no information on nuclear facilities in Tibet
 other than planned development of small and medium-scale electric reactors to increase
 Tibet's power production.
 In our view, exile accusations that the Chinese are destroying Tibetan culture
 have some truth. China has built roads, schools, hospitals, power plants, office
 buildings, and hotels; improved transportation, agriculture, and education; and brought in
 some industry. But this modernization has been superimposed upon traditional Tibet,
 which was pastoral, agricultural, and intensely religious. Furthermore, China's university

 system is slanted toward the Chinese; learning Chinese and adapting to Han culture is
 necessary for Tibetans to move up within the system. The challenge that faces
 Tibetans, both within and outside China, is how to preserve their unique culture and
 traditions in the face of an ever-changing and modernizing world.

 Negotiations Between Beijing and the Dalai Lama
 Communications between Beijing and the Dalai Lama opened in 1978 after a
 20-year hiatus, when China agreed to allow a delegation of Tibetan exiles in India to
 visit Tibet. The move followed the Dalai Lama's announcement that he would give up
 demands for an independent Tibet if he were convinced Tibetans were happy under
 Chinese rule. During 1979 and 1980 the Dalai Lama sent four "fact finding" missions to
 Tibet and nearby provinces. Three of the missions contained members of the Dalai
 Lama's family, and the fourth, representatives of Tibetan exile communities outside India.
 In May 1982 the Dalai Lama sent the first of two official negotiating teams to
 Beijing. They met with the Panchen Lama and the Director of the United Front Work
 Department, as well as with other Chinese officials concerned with minority policies.
 According to Embassy reporting, the Tibetans laid out three conditions for the Dalai
 Lama's return to China:
 ? The Tibetan Autonomous Region must be enlarged to include the Tibetan
 minority groups in Sichuan, Qinghai, and Yunnan.
 ? Tibetans should be offered something similar to the nine-point proposal
 previously made to Taiwan.
 ? Tibet would accept Chinese sovereignty, but the area should be demilitarized and
 made into a zone of peace.
 The Chinese indicated they would be willing to discuss the first condition, but
 predictably objected to the others. The United Front director asked the Tibetans to
 scale down their demands, but only offered in return to give the Dalai Lama an
 ambiguous position commensurate with his status.  Beijing later publicized the visit,
 rejecting the first condition and not even mentioning the third.
 In October 1984 a second Tibetan negotiating team visited Beijing.  The Tibetans
 again tabled their three demands and raised new concerns, including the alleged arrest
 of 1,000 Tibetans during the anticrime campaign in 1983 and the Han migration into
 Tibet. This time, according to State reporting, the Chinese outlined a five-point policy
 pubicly, which the Tibetans regarded as a hardening of their position. The Chinese

 ? The Dalai Lama must have confidence in China's political stability and its
 minorities policies.
 ? The Dalai Lama should forget about the events of 1959 and be "frank and sincere"
 in discussing Tibet's future.
 ? China would welcome the Dalai Lama's return to contribute to national unification
 and modernization.                                     -
 ? If the Dalai Lama returned to China, the Communist Party would recommend that
 he be elected a vice-chairman of the National Peoples Congress, and "it is
 suggested that he not go and live in Tibet"'
 ? When the Dalai Lama returned, he would issue a statement to the press.
 The.Chinese also hinted that a visit to Tibet by the Dalai Lama would be inappropriate.
 Beijing refused to allow.another Tibetan fact-finding mission to visit Tibet in
 1985. Although unofficial contacts between the two have continued, primarily through
 the Dalai Lama's elder brother Gyalo Thondup, we believe the Dalai Lama probably hopes
 to force Bejing back to the negotiating table officially. A representative of the Dalai
 Lama told State officers in 1985 that the Dalai Lama refused to let the issue of his own
 return eclipse the more important matter of the future of Tibet, and rejected Beijing's
 five conditions for his return. To pressure Beijing, the Dalai Lama tabled his own five
 point peace plan during his visit to Washington last September. It calls for:
 ? Abandonment of China's population transfer policy, which threatens the existence
 of the Tibetans as a people.
 ? Respect for the Tibetan people's fundamental human rights and democratic
 freedoms.
 ? Restoration and protection of Tibet's natural environment and the abandonment
 of China's use- of Tibet for the production of nuclear weapons and the dumping of
 nuclear waste.                                               -
 Chinese press has been tougher on this point, implicitly stating the the Dalai Lama
 would not return to live in Tibet, and Chinese officials recently explained to a State
 Department officer that the Dalai Lama's residence in Beijing is indeed implied in this
 point. Speaking at a 4 April press conference, however, the Panchen Lama stated that
 the Dalai Lama-could in fact reside in Tibet.

 ? Commencement of earnest negotiations on the future status of Tibet and of
 relations between the Tibetan and Chinese peoples.
 Although the plan does not call for Tibetan independence, and the Dalai Lama has
 avoided such an appeal in his public statements, Chinese officials have told State
 officers that it is clearly implied in his demands for the withdrawal of Chinese troops
 and the status of Tibet as a nonnuclear area.
 During his visit to Beijing last October, Gyalo Thondup received a letter from
 Deng Xiaoping to deliver to the Dalai Lama, according to a contact of the US Embassy in
 Beijing.  The letter was remarkably conciliatory, and in it Deng reaffirmed a 1979 pledge
 that all issues were negotiable except Tibetan independence.  Deng also apologized for
 the lack of progress in negotiations.
 Thondup returned to Beijing in late December with the Dalai Lama's response, but
 apparently no agreement was reached.  An official of the United Front Work department
 told a State officer that no progress had been made on any outstanding -issue and that
 there were no future formal or informal contacts.
