 VIETNAM
 In Vietnam, you might say that the overall military
 picture remains the same as when we last reported to
 you in June.   It has been enlarged in every dimension
 and intensified, but the basic fact is unchanged:   We
 retain the initiative.
 So far, improved intelligence and quick spoiling opera-
 tions against Communist concentrations have kept the
 enemy from mounting any successful offensive during
 this summer's monsoon season.
 Since early July, a number of major spoiling operations,
 from the vicinity of Saigon to the Demilitarized Zone
 in the north, have disrupted the plans of Communist
 elements up to divisional strength.
 They have inflicted heavy casualties on Communist regu-
 lars.   The figure for Communists killed in action has
 been averaging more than 1,000 a week for the past two
 months.
 The Communists, however, still have the capability to
 engage allied forces in strength, and to overrun district

 towns and isolated camps.  Our Order of Battle figures
 for the enemy show 105,314 men in the main combat force,
 which includes about 45,000 North Vietnamese regulars.
 (We also carry totals of 103,600 guerrillas and 17,550
 combat support troops.)                            t,,J
 As of August 8, US strength in South Vietnam was 288,961
 men, and the South Vietnamese armed strength totaled
 700,545.
 We believe that Communist strategy will be to continue
 hit-and-run attacks and ambushes wherever the terrain and
 relative troop strength favor  the enemy.  The Viet Cong
 will probably avoid prolonged battles as much as they
 can,  in an effort to preserve and increase their strength
 through infiltration and recruitment.
 (Political Situation)
 As for the internal political situation, it seems to
 me that the suppression of the Buddhist dissidence last
 spring has left Premier Ky's government in a considerably
 stronger position.
 The Buddhists continue their opposition, and remnants of
 the so-called "struggle forces" are still active in the
 northern provinces.   They do not appear to be strong

 The Ky government is beginning in earnest to prepare for
 the holding of constitutional assembly elections on 11
 September.   Some candidates have been disqualified on
 political grounds, mainly for clearly identified Commu-
 nist or neutralist ties.   The government seems to be
 making serious efforts, however, to keep the election
 essentially honest.  There are reports of considerable
 public skepticism on this score.
 We also have some evidence that the Viet Cong, who have
 called for a boycott of the elections, may try to disrupt
 them by stimulating disorders.

 (North Vietnam)
 To summarize the air war in the north---
 We have stepped up the pace of our bombing, concentrating
 on POL facilities and devoting a greatly increased number
 of sorties to armed reconnaissance against lines of com-
 munication.
 As of August 5, our air strikes had destroyed or heavily
 damaged 61   rcent of the total North Vietnamese POL
 capacity.
 This, of course, is bound to affect the enemy capability
 for moving men and supplies.  Nevertheless, materiel
 continues to roll through Laos into South Vietnam at a
 level sufficient to sustain the enemy's current operations.
 This is the first year that the Communists have been able
 to move trucks through Laos during the rainy season, be-
 cause of improved road surfaces and the proliferation of
 bypasses.   Where the road is blocked,  swarms of porters
 apparently shuttle the loads through the jungle.

 In July, an all-time high of 193 surface-to-air missiles
 were launched at American aircraft, but only three planes
 were shot down.

 The North Vietnamese appear determined, however, to con-

 parties to get negotiations started.   In mid-July Ho
 Chi Minh issued an order for what he called "partial
 mobilization." This was probably intended both to let

 (MAP, NIGERIA)
 NIGERIA
 We view with some concern the upheaval in Nigeria.   It has brought
 about the disintegration of the army.   There is also a real possibil-
 ity of a formal break-up of the country into basic tribal components.
 This revolt,  and its predecessor last January, reflect the antagonism
 between the predominant Moslem tribes in the North, and the more
 Negroid peoples along the coast--some Christians, more animist or
 pagan.   The coastal tubes are better educated,  fill the top civil
 service and army jobs, but the Northern Moslems had the votes, and
 dominated the Federal government.
 In the January revolt,  southern military elements killed or deposed
 a number of northern political and military leaders.   Their revolt
 was taken away from them by southern General Ironsi, who restored
 order but put in a military government.
 Ironsi tried to end the regional antagonisms by working for a uni-
 tary state.   In the course of bringing this about, he enabled num-
 bers of the coastal Christian Ibo -(EE-boe)  tribesmen to take over
 good civil service jobs in the Moslem north.
 This time, the northern officers revolted and killed several hundred
 Ibos, including many officers.   Ironsi was probably killed too.   The
 vendetta continues in the north, and the Ibos who were moving in are
 fleeing for their lives.

 The Ibo officers were key men in the 10,000-man Nigerian
 Army.   Without them, the army for now has virtually ceased
 to exist as a cohesive, effective organization.   Disci-
 pline in what remains is very shaky.   Even northern of-
 ficers have only limited control over the men.
 The police force of 18,000 has remained aloof and intact.
 However, it could not cope with any disturbances involving
 military personnel.
 The army chief of staff, Lt. Col. Gowon, reluctantly as-
 sumed power on 1 August with the nominal consent of the
 remnants of Ironsi's regime.   Gowon, the top ranking north-
 ern officer, was apparently not involved in staging the
 mutiny.
 Gowon has promised to honor all of Nigeria's international
 commitments.   He is personally well-disposed toward the US.
 Gowon was initially inclined to go along with northern ex-
 tremists who favor immediate northern secession.   However,
 he was dissuaded from this

 Gowon has formally reinstated the old federal system.
 He has ruled out the unitary government solution.   His
 pronouncements are aimed at orderly negotiations among
 regional representatives to see if they can agree on
 some new basis for continued association.  Negotiations
 are already under way at the regional level.
 Important civilians are being brought into Gowon's pro-
 visional regime and he has promised the earliest possible
 return to full civilian rule.   This is a necessity be-
 cause there are not enough army officers left to run
 the country.
 Gowon's succession and program have, however, not yet
 been accepted by the oil-rich Eastern region.   The seces-
 sionist sentiment is running strong there.   Eastern Mili-
 tary Governor Ojukwu is insisting on definite information
 about his fellow Ibo Ironsi (probably dead) and about
 other missing Eastern military personnel.   He also wants
 the northern troops which predominate in the army unit
 based in his region transferred to the North.   He is also
 demanding all eastern troops brought home.
 in the end, the East's course seems likely to be finally
 determined by Ibo civilian leaders who have not yet been

 (MAP)
 I want to alert you to the possibility that the situa-
 tion in the Congo may be returning to our critical list.
 The immediate trouble centers on a mutiny by troops from
 Tshombe's home province of Katanga.                  When Tshombe was still
 premier, he moved these units from their home grounds into
 northeastern Congo.
 Now they are homesick, hostile to the regular army command
 and dissatisfied over low pay and hard work.   They are
 afraid that new regular army units may have orders to dis-
 arm-  them.   On July 23,  they mutinied, and seized most of
 Stanleyville, which the Congolese now call Kisangani
 [KISS-on GHAN-eel.
 There is some reason to:suspect that the mutiny could be
 part of a larger plot by Tsh.ombe and Belgain financial inter-
 ests to put Tshombe back in power.
 Some of the Belgian mercenaries in the area appear to be
 siding with the mutineers.  Most 'of the-mercenaries in the
 northeast are French,  and have remained neutral..:.  Other
 Katangan units in the northeast are leaving their posts,
 moving toward Stanleyville.

 Premier Mulamba arranged a cease-fire during his two-
 week stay in Stanleyville, but there is no evidence of
 any effort to  deal with the issues which touched off
 the mutiny.
 Our concern is that the  wrangling of the Katangans,
 the mercenaries, and the regular army units could cre-
 ate an opening for renewed activity by the so-called
 Simba rebels, who have been broken up and driven back
 into the bush.
 We have no indication of any concerted new rebellion,
 and we do not believe that nearby countries are eager
 to resume their support of the Simbas.  There are some
 reports, however, that small gangs have ventured back
 into the territories left uncovered by the movement of
 Katangan units toward Stanleyville.
 In any event, President Mobutu seems to face his
 greatest challenge since he took over last November.
 The mutiny undermines the strong-man image he has been
 cultivating, and again exposes the undependability of
 the Congo Army.
 His running vendetta with Belgium almost led to a
 break in relations last week.   It has cooled off for

 Another country we have to keep on our warning list
 There were violent student demonstrations in June in
 Panama City and Colon, the two major urban centers.
 These again pointed up the alarming speed with which
 minor incidents can turn into crises of major propor-
 tions.
 The disorders were the worst since the anti-US riots
 in January, 1964. The immediate cause was the death of
 a Communist student.   The intensity has to be at-
 tributed to the growing unrest in the cities over
 rising unemployment,  the high cost of living, and
 inadequate housing.
 The only uniformed security force in Panama is the Na-
 tional Guard, which numbers about 4,200 men.   It is
 a disciplined and fairly competent organization, and
 has been able so far to deal promptly with civil dis-
 orders.

 So far, however, the disturbances have pretty much come
 in one city at a time.   If there were prolonged and
 widespread disorder,  the National Guard probably could not
 restore order without outside help--meaning US troops
 in the Canal Zone.
 President Robles and his aides have a recent $3-million
 loan from the US for several urban development pro-
 grams which might ease some of the worst pressures
 in the cities.   It is doubtful, however, that enough
 can be done in time to stem the growing discontent of
 much of the population.
 President Robles has been unable to accomplish the ex-
 tensive social and economic reforms he promised during
 his campaign.   The oligarchy which dominates the po-
 litical and economic life of the country is resisting
 any reforms which would reduce its economic hold.

 Robles heads a shaky coalition government, made up of
 parties affiliated with this oligarchy.   He has had to
 perform a balancing act to allocate very scarce re-
 sources.   Robles is also hampered by the maneuvering of
 several cabinet members and top aides who are presiden-
 tial aspirants.   Some of his supporters have already
 pulled away, and Robles' political position will probably
 continue to weaken as he approaches the end of his
 term in October 1968.
 The Communists control sizable student organizations.
 These are likely to be in the forefront in any outbreak
 of demonstrations against the government or against
 the United States.   But it is an oversimplification to
 call this a Communist menace.  At just about every
 point along the political spectrum in Panama, there
 are self-seekers or subversive elements who have
 a capacity to exploit the government's difficulties.
 They are constantly looking for a favorable opportunity
 to challenge the regime.
 Opposition  leader Arnulfo Arias continues to be the
 most acute threat to the Robles government.   Charging
 that the present regime is "illegitimate," Arias has
 successfully exploited a popular feeling that the

 promised reforms are being blocked by a concerted
 plot to keep the country's wealth in the hands of a
 few.
 Given widespread discontent, particularly in the urban
 areas, Arias and his followers could probably trigger
 serious disorders at any time and wear the government
 down through mob action.  Arias appears to be waiting
 for popular pressures to create the right psychological
 environment; he has warned that the announcement of a
 canal settlement could provide his Panamenista Party
 with an appropriate opportunity.
 Arias has served notice that he will oppose any canal
 settlement that the Robles government might negotiate.
 He claims it would be a sell out to the United States.
 After almost one and a half years of negotiations,
 the canal talks appear to be deadlocked.  Nevertheless,
 Robles has stated publicly that a new treaty will be
 signed some time next year.   In private conversations,
 both the president and Foreign Minister Eleta have
 warned that the negotiations are in danger of becoming
 enmeshed in the campaign for the 1968 presidential elec-
 tions.
 Pressure on the government to demonstrate some prog-
 ress in the canal talks will mount when the National
 Assembly convenes in October.

 We told you last June that a purge was under way in the
 leadership of Communist China.   The turmoil there has
 subsided a bit, for the time being anyway, and the pic-
 ture of what happened is a bit clearer.
 CHINESE LEADERSHIP
 (CHART, CHINESE LEADERSHIP)                        flwx~~
 It has become apparent that there has been a major shake-
 up in the party leadership just below the inner circle of
 men around Mao.   The victims are all accused of having
 opposed Mao's views, but we strongly suspect that the
 charges against some are trumped up, and that they are
 casualties of a power play.    The most likely hypothesis
 sems to be that when Mao fell sick, the possible-succes-
 sors began maneuvering for position.   The winner seems
 to have been Teng Hsiao-ping (DUNG SHYAOW-PINGI  the.Sec-
 retary-General of the Central Committee.

 In the actual case in China, the purge has hit Peng,
 who was Mayor of Peking; the powerful army chief of
 staff, who was also responsible for secret police af-
 fairs;                      and the headrof the party's vital propaganda de-
 partment.
 Mao Tse-tung showed up several times in the past month
 in meetings with foreign visitors.   There seems to be
 little doubt that he still dominates the leadership.
 How long he will last is another question, however. We
 are convinced he was seriously ill for part of the time
 he was completely out of public view--nearly six months
 from last November to May.

 The re-emergence of Mao in the past month coincides with
 several developments suggesting that there is a new bal-
 ance in the politburo.  The clearest indication of this
 was the announcement during July of new appointments
 to the party secretariat, the army's general staff, the
 propaganda department of the party, and the Minister
 of Culture.
 This new equilibrium may be fragile, however.  Events
 over the past months must have intensified antagonism
 and mistrust among the surviving leaders.  The possi-
 bility has increased that when Mao finally does go,
 the succession will be disorderly and marked by fac-
 tional struggles and purges.
 It is still far from clear whether the recent political
 struggle inside China will lead to major changes in pol-
 icy at home or abroad.   Since there has been no altera-
 tion in the basic hard-line character of the ruling group,
 we foresee no abrupt change in the policy of implacable
 hostility to the US.

 MAHON BRIEFING
 INDONESIA
 We believe that the new 27-man Indonesian cabinet, in-
 stalled on 28 July, further strengthens General
 Suharto and downgrades President Sukarno.
 Suharto heads the cabinet as chairman of the "cabinet
 presidium."  The core of the government is still the
 triumvirate--composed of Suharto who remains commander
 of the army, Foreign Minister Adam Malik  [MAHL-IK], and
 the Sultan of Jogjakarta  [JOG-JAH-KARTAH]  who super-
 vises economic and financial matters.
 With Sukarno's power now effectively reduced, the In-
 donesian Government's major problem is the country's
 seriously deteriorated economic situation.  We think
 that Indonesia's economic plight may become the na-
 tion's make-or-break political problem unless effec-
 tive remedial action can be developed.
 The Indonesian economy continues to be marked by de-
 clining production, galloping inflation (six-fold
 price increases in six months), a complete lack of
 foreign exchange reserves, and a foreign debt far

 beyond the country's ability to repay.   The saving
 factor in Indonesia has been the subsistence agri-
 cultural economy.   This covers about 75 percent of
 the nation.   Even the level of subsistence has fal-
 len consistently.
 Indonesia wants to reschedule payments on its inter-
 national debt  ($2.4 billion).   The price for Indone-
 sian readmission is supposed to be a payment of
 about 47.5 million dollars.   The IMF has suggested
 some of the creditors might advance this sum.   There
 has not been an enthusiastic response.   Indonesia.
 hopes that a token payment might open the door for
 re-entry.
 It also wants outside help in working out a domestic
 program of economic stabilization.   It has agreed
 with Western creditor nations that debt reschedul-
 ing.should be approached on a multilateral basis.
 A formal conference for this purpose is scheduled
 for Tokyo in mid-September.
 Over and above debt rescheduling,  Indonesia hopes
 for direct economic assistance.   To this end it
 has applied for readmission to the International
 Monetary Fund and the World Bank.   It looks toward

 return to the United Nations next month.
 The three-year confrontation with Malaysia, which

 about to be formally ended.   The Malaysian deputy
 prime minister and Indonesian Foreign Minister
 Malik expect to sign an agreement for ending hos-
 tilities in Djakarta this week.      1/
