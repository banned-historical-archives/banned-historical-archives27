 TRANSMISSION OR REVELATION OF WHICH IN ANY MANNER TO AN
 UNAUTHORIZED PERSON IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.
 GENERAL
 1.   France favors Japan?s association with Paris COCOM.-  Ac-
 cording to the French Foreign Office, France favors  Japan's
 association with the Paris COCOM, and believes that the estab-
 lishment of a COCOM in the Far East would be a "political
 blunder."  The French are opposed to raising the question of
 Japan's relation to COCOM with the Consultative Group unless
 the United States, Britain and France coordinate their position
 in advance.   (S Paris 7644, 9 June 52)
 Comment.-  The British, who have indicated "surprise" at
 French wwi ingness to conduct tripartite talks with Japan before
 approval of the Consultative Group of COCOM, maintain that it
 is preferable for this group to be consulted before conducting
 any talks with Japan.
 2.         Norwegian deplores failure to consult within NATO on re-
 plies To Soviet noes.-     member of the Norwegian NATO  a ega-
 on  n an informal conversation has expressed surprise at the
 lack of discussion or consultation by the,US, Britain and
 France with other NATO countries on the Soviet note exchanges,
 pointing out that the future of Germany can hardly be con-
 sidered strictly a tripartite affair.- The Norwegian hoped that
 in the forthcoming third Western reply consultation would not
 again consist merely of presenting the other NATO representa-
 tives with copies of the tripartite message a few hours before
 its public announcement.
 Special US Representative Draper reports that some other
 delegates are similarly concerned and he believes the Norwegia

 permanent representative might raise the question in the
 North Atlantic Council.  He names the British and French as
 "stumbling blocks" to NATO consultation on Soviet note ex-
 changes.   (S Paris POLTO 1362, 7 June 52)
 Comment-.  This Norwegian complaint reflects continued
 annoyance,on the part of the smaller NATO countries at what
 they consider excessive big three domination.
 ,  Ukrainian Party Secretary sent to Lvov Oblast   On the
 .30th of May Pravda   ra ny announced the replacement of
 Ukrainian Central Committee Secretary Z. T. Serdyuk by N. D.
 Bubnovskii.   Serdyuk was appointed First Secretary of the Lvov
 Oblast, probably in the role of trouble-shooter, inasmuch
 as .failure of ideological work and `the existence of bourgeois-
 nationalism in the Lvov area continue to be criticized.   (R
 Moscow 1930, 3 June 52)
 Comment:   Serdyuk was made a secretary of,the Ukrainian
 Party awe time of the.reLappointment of Politburo member
 Khruschev as First Secretary of the Ukraine at the end of
 1947.  He has been a member of the Ukrainian Politburo and
 Orgburo at least since 1949 and there have been no indications
 of official dissatisfaction with his work which would make
 his transfer to Lvov appear as a demotion.   It is a common
 Soviet practice to send rising party leaders to sensitive
 oblasts needing special supervision.
 Since the war the area in which the Lvov Oblast is
 located has been a troublesome center of Ukrainian nationalist
 sentiment and partisan activity, and through the spring of
 1952 it was the scene of extensive MGB operations.
 4.         Hungarian army now estimated at 190 000.  The US Military
 Attache n fldu apest now est ma es   e.strength of the Hungarian
 People's Army at 190,000.   The new figure is based  on  induc-
 tion of the class of 1932, processing for refresher training
 of the heaviest reservist groups seen to date, and lack of
 any evidence that earlier classes have been released.   (S

 FAR EAST
 25X1 C
 Soviet Union reportedly to repatriate 180,000 Japanese
 POW's:   Japanese Diet _mem er Mrs-Tomi-Kora,,who attended
 Tie Moscow Economic Conference and the Peiping preparatory
 "peace" meeting without' government sanction, has quoted "an.
 -authoritative Soviet source" as stating that the USSR will
 propose the return of 180,000 Japanese POW's if Japan signs a
 "separate" peace treaty with the Soviet Union.   Japanese
 officials expressed doubt that the report is accurate.   (R
 FBIS Tokyo Kyodo, 9 June 52)
 Comment:  The Japanese Government estimates that there
 are only  7-,637 of its nationals still alive in the USSR,
 China and North Korea.  The USSR has consistently maintained
 that all Japanese, except for a few hundred war criminals,
 have been returned.
 These facts cast extreme doubt on the Soviet source's
 reliability.  Publication of Mrs. Kora's report in Japan,
 moreover, is likely to weaken her. endorsement of the Soviet
 ?peace" campaign.
 6.          No strong pro-ghee sentiments demonstrated in Korean
 provinces:    mer can o;   cis s, reporting on political  eve-
 opmm ems from South Korean provincial centers., generally
 confirm that.Rhee has little genuine popular local support in
 his campaign against the Assembly.  They add that petitions
 and demonstrations are attributable primarily to oppressive
 tactics by the official and quasi-official organs subordinate
 to the President.   (C Pusan 1312, 8 June 52)
 Comment:  Rhee has publicly proclaimed that his over-all
 campaign against the: National Assembly reflects the "will of
 the people."  Only recently was the "Communist plot" theme
 introduced to justify his dictatorial actions of late May and
 early June.
 Rhee's chief henchman rumored as
 next ROK Defense
 Minister:.
 Yi. Pom-soI,present Minister of Internal     a rs
 and Rhee's executive in the current political imbroglio,

 Comment:  Yi Pom-sok's assumption of the defense post
 may be an attempt of Rhee and his supporters to forestall an
 apparent development of anti-Rhee sentiments in high ROK army
 circles.  Yi Pom-sole is already generally credited in Pusan
 with having nearly complete control over the Defense Ministry
 and the Prime Minister's office as well as his own position.
 8          Radio Free Japan again  hails Mao and ignores Stalin:
 Radio -Wee, Japan  the the c an,es ine station apparently  orated
 in North China, on 4 June broadcast to Japan a May Day message
 to Mao Tse-tung from a government workers' organization in
 Japan.  The message concluded with a "Banzai to Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung, the glorious star of peace and liberation of the
 Asiatic peoples."   (R FBIS, 6 June.52)
 Comment:  Radio Free Japan hailed Mao a week ago as
 "stare" and "glorious leader" and did not mention
 Comrade Stalin.   In the international Communist formula, en-
 dorsed by Peiping itself, Stalin is the leader of the peoples
 of the world and Mao only of the.Chinese people.   It is of.
 some interest that this view has not been expressed on Radio
 Free Japan.
 9,         Economic depression in China reported:_  Eye-witness
 accounts. from several recent arr va s  n Hong Kong give a
 picture of economic depression on mainland China which con-
 tradicts Communist claims that the economy has recovered from
 the effects of the anti-bou?geois campaign.
 A source from Tientsin reports that economic deteriora-
 tion there is "indescribable."  Half the personnel in govern-
 ment trade organs, he asserts, have been purged, and the
 remainder are fearful of assuming responsibility.
 Another report from a former resident, of a town in East
 China states that business there has been at a standstill for

 weeks and that the number of beggars is greater now than in
 Nationalist times.   (S Hong Kong 3212, 6 June 52)
 Comment:  Economic initiative among private businessmen
 and offs of government economic organizations has been
 paralyzed by Peiping's campaign against the bourgeoisie.
 Peiping's current propaganda,; acknowledging the "temporary
 difficulties now encountered in production and business,"
 declares, however, that this campaign is "basically concluded"
 and states that the regime will grant loans and orders to
 business enterprises.   It is too soon to assess the effective-
 ness of these new efforts to restore commercial confidence.
 10.           Communists imply they may close British consulates in
 China:       o   c a    .Hess  ommun st news agency s at orney
 in Hong Kong has intimated that if the British close down its
 office there, the Peiping regime may retaliate by closing
 British consulates in China,
 The lawyer's threat is taken seriously by the British
 Foreign Office, which has directed that notes explaining the
 British position be delivered to Peiping and to the agency's
 manager in Hong Kongo    (S London 5579, 7 June 52)
 Comment:  The agency, ordered in April to register
 under t-e colony's press ordinance, claimed exemption on
 grounds of being a state agency,   The deadline for registra-
 tion has been extended twice.
 The Communists are aware that other state agencies,
 such as USIS, are registered,  Peiping apparently hopes by
 stalling and threats to induce the British to back down.
 110         Chinese Com  nist Party plans to rehabilitate expelled
 members:                                                                e
 Chineg-e Communist Party (CCP) has arranged to rehabilitate
 the majority of its members expelled or placed under party
 supervision during the recent campaign against corruption,
 waste and bureaucracy.
 Members placed under party supervision for minor offenses
 will in most cases enter party schools for training.   Expelled
 members who have more than ten years membership and are not'
 charged with countermrevolut3.onary.acts, in most cases will
 be sent to party schools or to "production" work, and may be
 restored'to membership after three years:

 Comment:  Thousands of party members, including an alter-
 nate mem er of the Central Committee, were casualties of the
 P"san fan" cammpaign o
 Chinese press accounts of the campaign suggest that many
 or most of the party casualties were chosen almost at random
 as scapegoats to assume the general guilt.
 12.          Top official in Central-South China "loses face":  A
 Chinese  ommun s  newspaper reports    a   ens Tzi-RUI, Vice
 Chairman of the Central-South China government, in February
 submitted a public confession that he had. been "bureaucratic"
 in delaying prosecution of a complicated case'during the recent
 campaign against corruption, waste and bureaucracy.
 25X1A
 Comment:  Teng is the 30th-ranking member of the Party's
 Centres   ommittee,and Deputy of its Central-South Bureau and
 Political Commissioner of the Central-South Military Area.
 He is one of the top two officials in the region and the
 highest.par?ty member in China to be publicly rebuked during
 the campaign. Teng"s loss of face evidently did not lead to
 the loss of his-position, however, as he was still active in
 the Hankow area in March.

 promotions are being prepared.  Opponents of Chiang like
 General Sun Li-jen will be deprived of their trusted
 subordinates.
 Chiang has also proposed to reorganize the ground
 forces into separate area commands, responsible directl  to
 him rather than to the chief of the ground forces.
 Comment:  Although no effective opposition to Chiang
 Kai-seksts among Nationalist leaders, his elder son is
 disliked by Kuomintang members.
 The redrganization of the Nationalist Army, suggested
 by the US Military Advisory Group, will necessitate some
 officer transfers. The Generalissimo apparently plans to
 use this opportunityto retire those officers who oppose
 him and his son.

 Former Cambodian premier arrested:  The Cambodian
 Governmen   as arrested former preen er Yem Sambaur on charges
 of plotting against the internal security of the state.
 Sambaur was pinked with the distribution of "dissident"
 tracts two years ago,   (Paris AFP, 9 June 52)
 Comment.   Sambaur, a prominent and able politician, is
 the second former Cambodian premier to run afoul of local
 authorities..  The first, Son Ngoc Thanh, went underground
 and is believed to have escaped to Thailand.
 These development underscore the growing political
 unrest in Cambodia, and it will be interesting to observe
 the future career of the present premier, who is known to be
 very close to Thanh.

 17.,  Li Mi's difficulties reported:  The American Embassy in
 Bangko  has been re  a  y imm orme  that General Li Mi,
 commander of the Chinese Nationalist forces in northeastern
 Burma, was forced to leave Bangkok because his subordinates
 were contacting him there and insisting on more money or
 arms; in addition, his relations with Police Director General.
 Phao have been "temporarily severed."  The source also claims
 that Li may seek refuge in Chiengmai, in northern Thailand.
 (S Bangkok 2615, 7 June 52)
 Comment:  There is no information to confirm this report.
 25X1 C
 The Nationalists' need for arms is questionable, since
 they have recently been inactive and
 to be well-equipped.
 Chiengmal, which would appear to hold no special attrac-
 tion for Li Mi, is an unlikely sanctuary.
 Unrest among Burmese minorities noted:  The American
 Embassy repots    a  Me- new   n s er~     The Chin Affairs,
 who was appointed over Chin objections, was ostracized during
 a recent visit to the Chin area.    Similarly, the Kachins held
 a protest rally when the Minister visited their part of the
 country.  Meanwhile, a large demonstration was held in Taunggyi,
 capital of the Shan State, against the activities of the Shan
 States Administrative Enquiry Commission.   The Embassy comments
 that these incidents illustrate the Burmese Government's
 failure to enlist the loyalty of ethnic minorities.   (S Rangoon
 1182, 6 June 52)
 Burmese official again rejects Communist overtures:  The
 Burmese Home   mister  as aga n reject,   ommun st peace
 feelers,. and has challenged the insurgents to surrender or
 die.   The American Embassy in Rangoon comments that these
 repeated rejections appear to indicate the Burmese Government's
 growing confidence in the "face of Communist desperation."
 (S Rangoon 1182, 6 June 52)
 Comment':  The government's attitude toward  the Communists
 has been hardening and its military campaign against the in-
 . surgents has been pressed with unusual vigor.  Although the
 failure to obtain significant aid from China must be dis=
 heartening to the $tirm'ese Communists, it is still not clear
 whether their peaceIfeelers are an indication of "desperation"
 or a tactical maneuver ordered by higher authority.

 Syria have been carrying on a secret fund-raising campaign',

 NEAR EAST - AFRICA
 Communists reported raising money in Syria to support
 resistance in Algiers':  Agents of- Communist organizations in
 a group of Communist Party
 emissaries from Algiers have been in Syria since 15 April
 Comment:  There have been no other reports to indicate
 that Communist organizations in Syria are carrying on this
 particular activity.
 Communist activity in Algeria has featured propaganda
 urging solidarity with the people of Tunisia, and work stoppages.
 Because of the watchful surveillance of French authorities,'
 Communist organizations in Algeria do not present an important
 threat to internal stability.
 North African nationalists appear to have taken step
 toward greater cooperation:    Leading nationalist representa-
 tives from  Morocco,    ger a, and Tunisia formed a new 'commission
 in Cairo last March to collect and disseminate information
 concerning the Tunisian problem,

 on the Tunisian case for the use of favorably disposed United
 Nations delegates in the Security Council, and to have made
 efforts to collect photographs and eye-witness accounts of
 incidents in Tunisia discreditable to the French authorities.
 Comment:  Representatives of these nationalist parties in
 Cairo  axF ye wormed common organizations before, but their effec-
 tiveness'has been weakened by internal disagreements and the
 strong-tendency of each nationalist party to pursue an inde-
 pendent policy.

 sive demonstration:  The a  en ance:            at. a United  ront
 rally on   June at the Natal provincial capital of Durban far
 exceeded expectations, and is considered by the American
 Consul to have been an impressive display of white opposition
 unity and determination to fight the Malan government "at
 every step."  There was no violence, and the speeches decried
 any move toward secession from the Union. by Natal, stronghold
 of the opposition.   (C Durban 25, 7 June 52)
 Comment-  The Nationalist Government has stirred up great
 hostility recently by empowering Parliament to judge the con-
 stitutionality                                of its own acts, thus imperiling certain
 guaranteed rights.   The United Front, formed in mid-April by
 the opposition political Parties and the Torch Commando, a
 vigorous 200,000-member veterans' group, seeks to defeat the
 Nationalists in next year's general election.  The United
 Front wants to avoid violence, but the Torch Commando, which
 is organized along military lines and has access to weapons,
 could take the lead in armed resistance should the government
 attempt the forcible suppression of such demonstrations.

 delivery of iron ore unless coal prices were reduced.
 Sweden had asked Denmark to delay talks with the Poles, since
 Sweden was in a stronger position to force down Polish prices.
 (C 1396 Stockholm, 5,June 52)
 Comment:  Poland's willingness to sell at reduced prices
 indicates difficulty ,in disposing of surplus coal.   This diffi-
